[46:19] you know I was thinking about that song
[46:20] and I put it in the queue we'll sing it
[46:22] maybe at the end he touched me and all
[46:24] the joy that flood my soul something
[46:25] happened and now I know he touched me
[46:28] and made me whole you know there's
[46:30] something about how you can never really
[46:32] fully describe what happened when he
[46:34] touches you when he changes your life
[46:37] you know
[46:38] um you know we watched a few I'm not
[46:39] putting a plug in for this but you know
[46:41] if you watch it good but you know we
[46:42] watched a few uh episodes of The Chosen
[46:44] and one of the First episodes was with
[46:47] Mary Magdalene and you know she's
[46:48] possessed with those demons and
[46:49] Nicodemus couldn't do anything he had no
[46:52] power just having a dead formal religion
[46:53] but then Jesus came her way and and and
[46:56] and after those demons that came out of
[46:58] her she's a totally new person and your
[47:00] Nicodemus was um you know came and found
[47:03] her to see really what happened and you
[47:05] know you know she just said you know I
[47:07] was one way
[47:09] and then he came and now I'm another way
[47:11] you know and it's the same thing with
[47:13] you and I I trust when you've really met
[47:15] the master you're one way maybe you're
[47:18] religious maybe in the world maybe
[47:19] whatever more just sitting in a message
[47:21] Pew you know knowing all the doctrine in
[47:23] your head but not knowing him but then
[47:25] he came and now you're another way where
[47:28] the word is a reality he's a living
[47:30] reality in your life you know so but you
[47:32] know
[47:33] yeah I know that was just drama but we
[47:35] could never really describe what
[47:36] happened
[47:37] you know brother Brown would speak about
[47:39] the third pull and when he was talking
[47:40] about the third poll you know he'd speak
[47:42] about the three manifestations of his
[47:44] ministry the first one where he take the
[47:46] People by the hand he'd see what was
[47:48] wrong with them by uh bumps and things
[47:50] which would happen in his hand he'd tell
[47:51] them what's wrong Faith would rise he'd
[47:53] pray for them they'd be healed and then
[47:54] the second phase was Ministry where he'd
[47:56] be able to discern the thoughts and
[47:57] Tents of the hearts of the people he'd
[47:59] call people out by name addresses and
[48:01] specific things you know call them out
[48:03] what was wrong and then we know that was
[48:04] the high priest being revealed through
[48:06] the prophet but then the third pull of
[48:08] his ministry was a was it more of a
[48:10] mysterious thing because he tried to
[48:11] explain those gifts you know the
[48:13] manifestation of God to the people and
[48:15] it just caused a lot of carnal
[48:16] impersonations but when he saw a vision
[48:18] of the third pull he said it was like a
[48:20] a wooden building on the platform a
[48:22] little wooden building it was like a big
[48:23] massive Church there's a wooden building
[48:25] and people would would would would line
[48:27] up one by one they'd gone to this wooden
[48:29] room and they'd walk out they came and
[48:31] crippled or maimed or whatever in
[48:32] wheelchairs and things they'd walk out
[48:34] totally whole and a and a person would
[48:37] be standing if they came through and
[48:39] they you know she'd ask them what
[48:40] happened to you in there and they said I
[48:42] don't know but something happened and
[48:44] brother Graham said you know the pillar
[48:45] of fire said I'll meet you in there
[48:47] and so it's a mysterious thing when God
[48:49] changes someone because it can't be it
[48:51] can't be you know it can't be
[48:52] manufactured it's not like one testimony
[48:55] has to fit everyone you know we don't
[48:56] have to have all the same kind of
[48:58] testimony the main thing is he meets you
[49:00] and when he meets you he doesn't just
[49:02] anoint you but he lives in your life and
[49:04] he changes you forever where once we
[49:06] were maybe walking life spiritually
[49:08] crippled spiritually hope maybe people
[49:10] had to literally pack us amen around
[49:12] we're spiritually Dead We once were dead
[49:14] and trespasses and sins but then we came
[49:17] into that little room we had a we had a
[49:19] one-on-one meeting with God himself and
[49:21] God touched us amen that's incredible we
[49:24] think any you know because that leper
[49:25] said if thou will
[49:27] and you think about who he came to he
[49:29] didn't just come to a prophet he didn't
[49:31] come to a religious leader he didn't
[49:32] come to one of the scribes of the
[49:33] Pharisees or whatever more but he came
[49:35] to the very Messiah God made flesh and
[49:40] there he was he says if thou will here's
[49:41] the Fountain of healing the Fountain of
[49:43] restoration the Fountain of eternal life
[49:45] he says if thou will
[49:47] you can make me clean and of course the
[49:49] Lord's or you're the Lord's heart is I
[49:51] will he came in faith and he and Jesus
[49:54] touched him see it's one thing for us to
[49:57] touch him but it's one thing for him to
[49:59] touch us now we know when both happened
[50:01] when faith when faith gets a hold of him
[50:03] something's got to happen amen and when
[50:06] he touches us well something's got to
[50:07] happen I remember when he touches us
[50:09] there's a purpose for it he doesn't just
[50:11] change our lives and then we just kind
[50:13] of wander on haphazard but he puts us on
[50:15] a road he puts us on a path now this
[50:18] word touch here
[50:19] it means to properly this from the
[50:22] Strong's Concordance it means properly
[50:24] to attach oneself
[50:25] that is that is that is to touch so so
[50:28] when the Lord touches us he actually
[50:30] attaches himself to us it's not just a
[50:33] touch like this he actually attaches
[50:35] himself where where it's no longer just
[50:37] us walking alone but it's us and him
[50:38] walking together amen and the and the
[50:41] and the root meaning or the reflexive uh
[50:43] reflective reflexive of this word is to
[50:46] properly fasten two and that is
[50:48] specifically to set on fire I mean so
[50:51] when he touches someone he sets them on
[50:53] fire they don't start they don't
[50:55] understand some religious Christian
[50:57] culture wandering along but something
[50:59] happens where a flame of Eternal God
[51:01] steps into that person's life and
[51:03] they're not just dormant but you know a
[51:05] potential but it's actually a
[51:07] manifestation of God where where all the
[51:09] words you know brother Brahm says it's
[51:10] like the word can just lay in someone's
[51:12] life all the right teaching and the
[51:14] right approach to God the white rated
[51:16] dress all these different things all the
[51:17] teaching of the scripture can be laying
[51:18] there but it's like a candle it can be a
[51:20] perfect candle the wick can be perfect
[51:22] the you know you know the wax can be
[51:24] perfect and and you can know all all
[51:26] about how bright it can shine but once
[51:28] it's lit that's the thing that makes a
[51:30] difference and it's the same thing with
[51:32] you and I we can have the word laying in
[51:33] us all your race and you know Sunday
[51:35] school incredible teachers in there can
[51:37] teach us incredible things that you know
[51:38] we can hear incredible sermons but it
[51:40] takes the lighting of the candle a fire
[51:43] experience where God where God touches
[51:45] you and sets you a flame Hallelujah and
[51:48] from that moment we are never the same
[51:51] Now isn't incredible I was I was
[51:53] thinking about this this phrase you know
[51:55] I get phrases jumping to my into my
[51:57] heart as I'm thinking about you know
[51:58] surfaces and so on and and and one of my
[52:01] favorite chapters in the whole Bible is
[52:03] Ephesians chapter 2. that's my chapter I
[52:07] love your the whole book is incredible
[52:08] but I love chapter two and
[52:12] uh there's a there's a phrase where
[52:14] where in in verse 12 maybe we'll start
[52:16] reading from verse 10 here
[52:18] um he says now for we are his
[52:20] workmanship
[52:21] praise God
[52:23] Hallelujah I'm under construction
[52:26] but it's not some construction company
[52:28] that's going under you know that's
[52:30] that's way behind schedule way over
[52:32] budget no no I'm on time I'm under
[52:34] budget Hallelujah and there's no half
[52:37] you know you know there's no remedial
[52:38] work what God does is perfect right and
[52:41] he does it perfectly every time amen
[52:43] where his workmanship created in Christ
[52:45] Jesus unto good works which God hath
[52:48] before ordained that we should walk in
[52:49] them so God ordains he you know it's
[52:51] hard I find it hard to start somewhere
[52:53] and stop somewhere in the scripture
[52:54] because really we'd just start from
[52:56] Genesis 1 1 and have a good time all the
[52:57] way to the amen at the end but even you
[53:00] know and especially this chapter too
[53:02] because I love the first part of it but
[53:03] you know so so we're God God ordained
[53:05] that we should walk in Good Works but he
[53:08] had to touch Us in order for us to do so
[53:10] wherefore remember that ye and times
[53:12] past Gentiles In the Flesh you are
[53:14] called uncircumcision by that which is
[53:16] called the circumcision and the flesh
[53:18] made by hands now that at that time now
[53:21] this is the phrase that jumped into my
[53:23] heart that at that time
[53:25] we were without Christ being aliens from
[53:27] the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers
[53:29] from the covenants of Promise having no
[53:31] hope and without God in the world now
[53:34] some people will take this as a
[53:36] dispensational thing that well before
[53:37] Calvary we're without the covenants of
[53:39] Israel we were aliens from the household
[53:42] of God all those things but to me yes
[53:44] that is true but to me this is a
[53:46] personal scripture because it was once a
[53:48] time when I was having no hope and
[53:50] without God in the world
[53:52] one time in life I had no hope you know
[53:55] what happened you know I remember when I
[53:57] was about 18 had you know totally lost
[53:59] in the world and we were living in
[54:01] American Samoa and a and a hurricane
[54:03] came through came around the South part
[54:05] of the island and where my parents lived
[54:07] it was it was like lava you know a big
[54:09] lava shelf and there's about this much
[54:11] soil so when this hurricane came through
[54:13] you know all the trees blew blew over
[54:15] apart from the coconut trees and so the
[54:18] next morning
[54:19] um I had this blunt machete and I had to
[54:21] cut my way through our driveway so my
[54:23] dad could get on his motorbike and go
[54:25] see if his work was still intact because
[54:27] it used to manage he used to be a
[54:29] engineer chief engineer at a tuna
[54:30] Cannery and so he had to go see if the
[54:32] place was still standing because you
[54:34] know you'd look at the island afterwards
[54:36] and then you know you see a valley like
[54:37] just so here on you know the side of
[54:39] Stokes Valley one side of the of the
[54:41] hills was just twigs and the other side
[54:44] is looks like totally untouched and
[54:45] people lost lost roofs all kind of
[54:47] things happened I'd never been in a
[54:49] storm where there's been so much noise
[54:50] and so much water in the air
[54:52] and anyway
[54:53] I'm cutting my path you know a path
[54:56] through these Fallen trees because
[54:58] everything fall over apart from the
[54:59] coconut trees it's still gusting I don't
[55:00] know how much and there's all these
[55:02] coconut trees and you know coconut trees
[55:04] have coconuts and coconuts are hard and
[55:07] they're up there and it's gusting like
[55:09] crazy and you know all I could do was
[55:12] sing every every every hymn that I heard
[55:15] you know you know at church I mean I
[55:18] mean I mean at boarding school of the
[55:19] chapel but I had no hope I was scared
[55:21] that these coconuts one of them's gonna
[55:23] I'm gone
[55:25] I'm still here but you know what I mean
[55:27] but you know but I had no hope I had no
[55:29] assurance that if a coconut hit my hit
[55:31] my skull you know my next moment I'm in
[55:33] glory I had nothing
[55:35] I was without God in the world but that
[55:37] was at that time
[55:39] I remember there came a time when he
[55:40] touched me
[55:41] Hallelujah where where God came on the
[55:44] scene and it's incredible thing you know
[55:46] where you think he can do it but then
[55:48] after he's done it amen where our faith
[55:51] Rises and God comes and touches you and
[55:52] changes your life amen so there came a
[55:55] time that at that time see we were
[55:57] without Christ and I trust this is your
[55:59] testimony but now you're not without
[56:01] Christ you're with him in the world Amen
[56:03] that you're not an alien from the
[56:05] Commonwealth of Israel you're not a
[56:07] stranger from the covenants of promise
[56:09] but you've become one with that Covenant
[56:10] of promise and you don't have no hope
[56:13] but you have hope and we know Bible hope
[56:16] is not hope like I hope something's
[56:18] going to work out but Bible hope means
[56:20] an expectation with pleasure so you have
[56:23] an expectation I know my redeemer liveth
[56:25] I'll stand that day with him upon the
[56:27] Earth amen so those skin worms the saw
[56:30] this flesh yet in with this in this
[56:32] flesh with these eyes I shall see God
[56:33] Amen and we're not without God in the
[56:35] world but we're with him he said I'll
[56:37] never leave the nor forsake thee
[56:39] Hallelujah so to me that's an incredible
[56:41] thing
[56:43] Hallelujah that one time I was without
[56:45] God but now I'm with him I was once shut
[56:47] off from him without hope but now I have
[56:49] hope
[56:50] amen so now there's moments in life
[56:53] where that they greatly impact us
[56:56] yeah and and this is not just even with
[56:57] God this can just be in the world people
[56:59] get impacted by moments I remember when
[57:02] I was sitting in fourth form uh science
[57:04] class and and the teacher drew a diagram
[57:06] of an atom on the board that impacted me
[57:09] because I ended up studying science at
[57:11] University being in that field but you
[57:13] know but you know it can be a it can be
[57:14] a moment like that it can be words it
[57:16] can be an atmosphere it can be a song
[57:17] you know all those things are moments
[57:20] that can touch someone's life and put
[57:21] them on a path now if you take that in
[57:24] the natural but we are we can we can
[57:27] take it into the into the supernatural
[57:29] enter the Eternal you know Abraham who
[57:33] became Abraham was like any other
[57:35] ordinary man
[57:36] until God called him that's what made
[57:38] the difference he wasn't special he
[57:40] wasn't richer than everyone else he
[57:42] wasn't smarter than everyone else he
[57:43] didn't have the best family than anyone
[57:45] else he was an ordinary man he was a Joe
[57:47] average
[57:48] but then God called him and that's what
[57:50] made him special that's what made the
[57:52] difference it's the same thing with you
[57:53] and I there's nothing special about us
[58:00] some people are looking at me like hold
[58:01] on
[58:03] we're just like anyone else if you think
[58:06] you're more special than the next guy
[58:07] you've got it all wrong it's the grace
[58:09] of God that saved you it's the grace of
[58:11] God that found you it's the grace of God
[58:13] that keeps you amen we're not special
[58:15] anyone else it's just God found us
[58:16] that's what made the difference amen we
[58:18] had nothing that too married what he has
[58:20] done for us amen there's nothing that we
[58:22] have in our personality it's not like I
[58:24] like this personality I don't like this
[58:26] one so I'll save this one no it doesn't
[58:27] work that way God is Sovereign in his
[58:29] election and is choosing amen so Abraham
[58:32] was like anyone else but God called him
[58:34] and that's what made the difference now
[58:36] it's amazing when you think it's just
[58:38] such a small phrase in the scripture
[58:40] now the Lord said unto Abraham get the
[58:43] out of thy country and from thy Kindred
[58:45] and from my father's house into a land
[58:47] that I'll show thee and I'll make thee a
[58:50] great nation I'll bless thee it'll make
[58:51] thy name great and thou shall be a
[58:54] blessing and I'll bless them that bless
[58:56] them curse thee that curse him that
[58:58] curses thing and in thee shall all the
[59:01] families of the earth be blessed now I'd
[59:03] know how long that took me to read it
[59:05] wasn't very long but that moment that
[59:07] moment when God's word touched Abraham
[59:10] changed his whole life change it from
[59:12] living in the you know or the child is
[59:15] whoever he was living in that time maybe
[59:17] an idolater or whatever he was and may
[59:20] to put him on a path to walk with God
[59:22] that's how powerful when God's word
[59:24] touches you and I am amen it changes our
[59:27] whole life it puts us on a path from
[59:29] just being a religious person to Walking
[59:31] with God there's a big difference
[59:32] between those two things I mean the
[59:34] world is full of religion but those
[59:36] Walking with God is a totally different
[59:37] thing God never intended that we'd have
[59:39] religion he'd intend that we'd know him
[59:41] and walk with him and numb according to
[59:43] his word that's what he's always wanted
[59:45] to have a personal relationship with you
[59:48] and I Hallelujah so God spoke to Abraham
[59:51] his word impacted him it he touched him
[59:54] and it set him on another path
[59:56] and it was more than a path to Canaan
[59:59] though that was part of it it was more
[1:00:00] than just a path to the promised land
[1:00:03] and you know all those things because
[1:00:04] when God touches somebody it gives them
[1:00:07] Direction it gives them purpose you know
[1:00:09] we should never get to a place where we
[1:00:11] think we're just occupying time we're
[1:00:13] occupying weeks I'm looking forward to
[1:00:15] Christmas or New Year wherever you know
[1:00:16] no we're not here just occupying time
[1:00:19] God puts us on a specific path and we're
[1:00:21] here for a purpose now when God touches
[1:00:24] someone as I said ignites a fire in
[1:00:26] their soul Hallelujah once I just you
[1:00:30] know like the woman of the well God
[1:00:32] touched her by his word and once he's
[1:00:35] just occupying time maybe thinking this
[1:00:37] is just how my life is going to be but
[1:00:38] but but when she was touched by the
[1:00:41] master I mean she ran into a city saying
[1:00:43] come see a man who told me all I ever
[1:00:45] did is it's not the very Messiah amen so
[1:00:48] she was touched and her life went on a
[1:00:50] totally different path her Lisa
[1:00:52] Abraham's life went on a totally
[1:00:53] different path and it was more than just
[1:00:55] a Canaan
[1:00:56] because because when Abraham met God
[1:01:00] as as the Apostle Paul would ride in The
[1:01:03] Heroes of Faith in Hebrews chapter 11.
[1:01:05] it says by faith when God touches you
[1:01:07] gives you Faith he gives you revelation
[1:01:10] police I thank God for the Master's
[1:01:12] touch he imparts with us touchy in Parts
[1:01:15] Revelation and parts Faith Amen to by
[1:01:18] faith Abraham when he is called to go
[1:01:20] out into a place which he should after
[1:01:22] receive an inheritance obeyed he went
[1:01:25] out not knowing whether he went by faith
[1:01:27] he so adjourned in the land of promise
[1:01:29] as in a strange country dwelling in
[1:01:31] Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The
[1:01:33] Heirs with him of the same promise
[1:01:36] you know we can we can have Fellowship
[1:01:38] about the same promise Hallelujah for he
[1:01:41] looked for a city which had foundations
[1:01:43] whose Builder and maker is God see think
[1:01:46] about here's this man now he's living
[1:01:48] he's living you know he comes into the
[1:01:50] promised land and God says this is all
[1:01:52] yours but he's not looking for a
[1:01:54] physical City anymore you see it see
[1:01:56] when God touched him he put him on a
[1:01:58] path not just for a natural walk see see
[1:02:01] this is not the end you know our our
[1:02:04] future is not here our future is there
[1:02:07] right and if someone gets touched by the
[1:02:09] master of his word becomes alive to them
[1:02:11] they realize I'm just a pilgrim I have
[1:02:14] no continuing City amen I have one
[1:02:16] that's Eternal but upon this Earth I am
[1:02:19] just passing through amen so he was
[1:02:21] walking around on the very place in New
[1:02:24] Jerusalem was going to rest upon we'll
[1:02:26] rest upon amen he was walking in that
[1:02:28] very area because he but he was looking
[1:02:31] maybe he had journey to one place and
[1:02:33] someone would ask him you know what are
[1:02:35] you doing here I'm looking for a city
[1:02:37] anybody asked well there's no City
[1:02:39] around here you know you just passed a
[1:02:41] few he said no no I'm not looking for
[1:02:42] those cities
[1:02:43] I'm not looking for Sodom or Gomorrah or
[1:02:45] any natural kind of city I'm not looking
[1:02:47] for those cities what kind of city are
[1:02:49] you looking for I'm looking for a city
[1:02:50] whose Builder and maker is God can you
[1:02:53] tell me where it is there's a hunger
[1:02:55] there's a longing I want to be in that
[1:02:56] place see because when he touches you he
[1:02:58] puts a hunger in you for that land oh
[1:03:01] Leah so you know you know it's one big
[1:03:03] thing you know he's touched you as that
[1:03:05] one you live according to his word you
[1:03:07] love his word because that's him there's
[1:03:09] also a longing you want to go to that
[1:03:11] land
[1:03:12] Hallelujah see I trust we can just just
[1:03:14] change our perspective today doesn't
[1:03:16] matter what's going on in life you may
[1:03:18] have troubles up to your eyeballs and
[1:03:20] over your eyeballs but I trust you're
[1:03:22] looking for a sitting whose Builder and
[1:03:24] maker is gone
[1:03:25] see he was looking for that New
[1:03:27] Jerusalem amen he is looking and the
[1:03:29] reason he is looking for that Heavenly
[1:03:31] city is because he met the king of that
[1:03:33] City amen he met Melchizedek after he
[1:03:36] came back from rescuing Abraham um
[1:03:38] rescuing lot now we know Melchizedek was
[1:03:41] not just a natural King where the
[1:03:44] Apostle Paul would describe him in
[1:03:45] Hebrews chapter 7. he says this
[1:03:48] melchized the king of Salem preached the
[1:03:50] most high God who met Abraham returning
[1:03:52] from the slaughter of the Kings and
[1:03:54] blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a
[1:03:56] tenth part of all first being by
[1:03:58] interpretation king of righteousness and
[1:04:01] also after that king of Salem which is
[1:04:02] king of peace now he begins to describe
[1:04:05] him here without father without mother
[1:04:07] without dissent having either beginning
[1:04:08] of days nor end of life but made like
[1:04:11] unto the Son of God abideth a priest
[1:04:13] continually so you know there's a lot of
[1:04:15] thoughts in the world about this
[1:04:17] Melchizedek some think well he is just a
[1:04:18] natural King but the Apostle Paul says
[1:04:21] he didn't have a father or mother
[1:04:22] beginning a days or end of life so he's
[1:04:24] Eternal and the only one that's Eternal
[1:04:26] is God and then other people think well
[1:04:28] he's a priesthood but we just read here
[1:04:30] no he's not a priesthood he's a man amen
[1:04:32] but he's not just a natural man but he's
[1:04:34] God himself came and after Abraham had
[1:04:37] had had got back as Fallen brother then
[1:04:40] then Melchizedek came and and served him
[1:04:42] the first ever symbol of communion of
[1:04:44] the bread and the wine showing that
[1:04:46] after the battle's over amen you get to
[1:04:48] commune with the Lord and and it shows
[1:04:51] that actually because remember many
[1:04:52] people think well that's going to be in
[1:04:53] the new heavens and you and new earth
[1:04:55] sure it will be or the Millennium sure
[1:04:57] it will be but really when you when you
[1:04:59] get the Battle of your own self
[1:05:01] see when you get yourself whipped out
[1:05:03] amen and let the Lord take over your
[1:05:05] life then he comes and communes with you
[1:05:09] Hallelujah
[1:05:10] now brother Brian would would preach a
[1:05:13] service at the near the end of his
[1:05:14] ministry Ministry who is this
[1:05:17] Melchizedek now to me the very title of
[1:05:19] that's very important because he doesn't
[1:05:21] say who was that Melchizedek but who is
[1:05:23] present tense this Melchizedek and then
[1:05:26] he begins to describe how how our lord
[1:05:29] Jesus through the through the Old
[1:05:30] Testament condescended down through
[1:05:32] various forms and he became flesh and
[1:05:35] and and on his descension down he was
[1:05:37] Melchizedek in a uh in a theophanic form
[1:05:41] right then he became flesh in Jesus
[1:05:43] Christ because we know that the god of
[1:05:44] the Old Testament is the god of the new
[1:05:46] right he's not a separate God right
[1:05:48] amen so so this Melchizedek is still
[1:05:51] alive today
[1:05:52] he's still present today because
[1:05:54] Melchizedek became Jesus Christ not a
[1:05:56] different God he's the same God just
[1:05:57] changing form and then he had asked the
[1:06:00] question now if I have preached the
[1:06:01] truth let him come forth now and
[1:06:03] vindicate it to be true and then there's
[1:06:05] people in the audience and then he calls
[1:06:07] out a woman or a man he says and he
[1:06:08] begins to describe their life and what
[1:06:10] what need they have and it's specific
[1:06:12] and accurate I don't have it on me right
[1:06:13] here but then he asked the question well
[1:06:15] who did they touch he said they didn't
[1:06:17] touch me he said there's no point
[1:06:18] touching me I'm like any other man but
[1:06:20] and you know and they're 30 feet from me
[1:06:22] who did they touch he said they touched
[1:06:24] the high priest because he's the high
[1:06:26] priest Can Be Touched by the feeling of
[1:06:28] our infirmity amen so he's saying that
[1:06:30] the high priest was there revealing
[1:06:32] himself through brother Branham the same
[1:06:33] Jesus Christ was revealing himself
[1:06:35] through brother Bradham and he is our
[1:06:37] high priest now he can still be touched
[1:06:39] by the feeling of our infirmity like the
[1:06:41] woman with the blood issue touched him
[1:06:43] physically but it was her faith that
[1:06:45] touched them because many other people
[1:06:47] thronged and bumped into him you know
[1:06:48] like the soldiers would slap him and
[1:06:50] beat him there in Pilots Jasmine Hall
[1:06:52] and mock them and different things but
[1:06:53] their touch did not get any healing
[1:06:55] their touch got no Deliverance because
[1:06:57] they had no faith in their touch rights
[1:06:59] are the same thing with you and I we've
[1:07:00] got to believe when we call upon his
[1:07:02] name amen that he's more than able to do
[1:07:05] that which we have asked Hallelujah like
[1:07:07] she did she came to a place she said
[1:07:09] well I've just got to touch him I
[1:07:10] believe I just get a hold of him and our
[1:07:12] faith can get a hold of him today
[1:07:15] amen
[1:07:16] it can change our lives now
[1:07:19] praise the Lord and then and then he
[1:07:21] would show this now show the
[1:07:22] condescension of God in that way he says
[1:07:25] we just bypassed our theophany so he
[1:07:27] skipped around
[1:07:28] you know the same way Jesus knew all
[1:07:31] things because he was theophany then he
[1:07:32] became flesh now we were with God in the
[1:07:35] mind of God we have eternal bodies
[1:07:37] waiting for us already we'll get to that
[1:07:38] right but we bypassed our theophany and
[1:07:41] became flesh and that's why when we when
[1:07:42] we're born in this world we didn't know
[1:07:44] who we were
[1:07:45] we had spiritual Amnesia right we
[1:07:47] thought we were from New Zealand or
[1:07:48] Africa or wherever right but then one
[1:07:50] day God came our way and he touched us
[1:07:52] and he opened our eyes amen and changed
[1:07:55] us and we never been the same just like
[1:07:57] the woman at the well she thought well
[1:07:58] I'm a Samaritan this is who I am this is
[1:08:00] you know you know this is my culture
[1:08:02] this is my Villages where our fathers
[1:08:03] used to worship and all these different
[1:08:05] things this is her identity but Jesus
[1:08:07] came to him saying no that's not your
[1:08:09] identity that's who you think you are
[1:08:11] but I want you to know who you really
[1:08:13] are in my mind and that's why he opened
[1:08:15] her heart amen opened her understanding
[1:08:17] and then then her eyes came open and so
[1:08:20] this is Messiah now when you see Messiah
[1:08:23] there's a reason you can see him in your
[1:08:25] days because you're part of Messiah
[1:08:26] you're part of the word amen that's
[1:08:28] that's way that's why we can see him and
[1:08:30] his Word is Alive with us today
[1:08:32] Hallelujah because why we're part of him
[1:08:35] that should make us happy
[1:08:37] you're having a bad day one part of God
[1:08:39] that's all right he's my father he'll
[1:08:41] take care of me he knows what I have
[1:08:43] need of amen he is my Hallelujah then I
[1:08:46] was rejoicing in this because uh so
[1:08:49] Genesis so so after after Abraham uh
[1:08:52] meets Melchizedek
[1:08:54] it says Genesis 15 1 and after these
[1:08:57] things
[1:08:58] the word of the Lord came unto Abraham
[1:09:00] in a vision saying fear not Abraham I'm
[1:09:03] thy Shield
[1:09:04] and thy exceedingly great reward maybe
[1:09:08] you want to put that up can you put that
[1:09:09] up Genesis 15 and 1. you think about
[1:09:11] this here he is here's Abraham he's got
[1:09:14] all these servants he's just got locked
[1:09:16] back and he's just had he said communion
[1:09:18] with God and different things he says no
[1:09:20] fear not
[1:09:21] I'm thy I am my I'm my shield I'm your
[1:09:25] protection
[1:09:26] that that word Shield you know there's a
[1:09:29] root meaning of it it means you know I'm
[1:09:30] your I'm your hedge I'm your protection
[1:09:33] I'm your Shield I'm your protector
[1:09:35] earlier so so who who can we fear if
[1:09:38] God's our Shield he's the best armor
[1:09:40] there is is the armor of God he says I'm
[1:09:42] thy Shield so our Shield is a person let
[1:09:45] me just let the full armor of God is the
[1:09:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost we have the
[1:09:48] armor on the inside holy we don't
[1:09:50] physically pick up a weapon and a shield
[1:09:52] and now no it's it's it's in amen it's
[1:09:55] internal I was going to say it's EQ um
[1:09:58] it's Eternal but it is eternal because
[1:09:59] it's God but it's internal right because
[1:10:01] it's the Holy Ghost on the inside and
[1:10:03] the exceeding great rewards Abraham's
[1:10:06] reward was God this way it's such a
[1:10:08] longing I'm looking for the city who's
[1:10:10] building maker is God Amen because he's
[1:10:13] looking for this one who was his reward
[1:10:15] now this word reward I just I love
[1:10:18] looking into definitions of words and
[1:10:20] you know it just makes me happy amen so
[1:10:22] this word reward it's a payment of
[1:10:24] contract
[1:10:26] so he's he's our payment
[1:10:28] I remember remember the wages of sin are
[1:10:30] death so everyone's going to get paid
[1:10:31] something but the gift of God is eternal
[1:10:34] life
[1:10:34] right so so people will work for the
[1:10:36] devil and get wages which is death right
[1:10:39] but but he he just gives us eternal life
[1:10:42] without money or price we don't have to
[1:10:44] work for it we just got to accept it
[1:10:47] amen so it's a payment of contract it's
[1:10:50] a salary it's a fear f-a-r-e right you
[1:10:54] know like like you've got to get a bus
[1:10:55] fare or a plane what we call a plane
[1:10:57] ticket but a plate but you know so so
[1:10:59] it's a payment to get from one place to
[1:11:01] another place oh there we go from this
[1:11:03] place to to heaven right so here's our
[1:11:06] fear he paid it all that down Calvary we
[1:11:09] don't have to pay nothing to get in a
[1:11:10] Rapture he's already paid it for us amen
[1:11:13] it also means a maintenance
[1:11:15] at least it's not just a guy from this
[1:11:16] world to the next world but it's our
[1:11:18] maintenance he is our maintenance what
[1:11:20] he sustains us and keeps us every day
[1:11:23] Hallelujah he is our maintenance
[1:11:25] Hallelujah we think oh Lord you know we
[1:11:28] get so scared you know we need to get it
[1:11:29] out of our minds that we're going to
[1:11:30] fall away into unbelief
[1:11:32] right you got to get to a place I trust
[1:11:34] you've got to a place in your Christian
[1:11:36] walk that he saved you to keep you he
[1:11:39] didn't save you to lose you amen so he
[1:11:41] is your maintenance he will maintain you
[1:11:44] every day that's why he calls you in the
[1:11:46] morning come up a little higher I want
[1:11:48] to spend yo you get a burden on your
[1:11:50] heart I need to pray I need to read the
[1:11:51] word I know you're ever longing why
[1:11:52] because he wants to he wants to just
[1:11:54] pour himself in more and more
[1:11:56] Hallelujah and also by implication it's
[1:11:59] a compensation
[1:12:01] you know the one day when we're over on
[1:12:03] the other land he'll come out the great
[1:12:05] and his great majesty and physically
[1:12:07] wipe every tear from your eye
[1:12:09] hello just just one Glimpse one glimpse
[1:12:12] of him will just pay it all not that I'm
[1:12:15] even looking for a reward you understand
[1:12:16] but just one glimpse of that great king
[1:12:18] I think often you know because you know
[1:12:20] when he when he came in his glorified
[1:12:22] form there to the disciples he had he
[1:12:25] still had the male male prince in his
[1:12:27] hands and his feet and his side and you
[1:12:29] just see yeah yeah often think about yo
[1:12:31] we're up in eternity he's just perfect
[1:12:33] Blue Sky there's not a shadow anywhere
[1:12:35] it's just glorious and we say Let's go
[1:12:37] see him and he'll walk over the hill
[1:12:39] there we see him maybe in the distance
[1:12:41] he just waves his hand and you see that
[1:12:43] now put in his head you know it's him
[1:12:45] anyway totally we just saw this now
[1:12:47] Jesus
[1:12:48] Hallelujah
[1:12:50] just one glimpse
[1:12:52] just one wave
[1:12:53] he's our benefit
[1:12:55] he's our price
[1:12:57] he's our reward
[1:12:59] but also the last meaning of this word
[1:13:01] is he is our worth
[1:13:04] we are not worthless
[1:13:06] we are not worthless we are the apple of
[1:13:09] his eye if the devil ever tries you to
[1:13:11] think you're worth nothing he's lying to
[1:13:12] you amen you are worth more than see
[1:13:16] when you buy something you put a greater
[1:13:18] value at what you're buying that the
[1:13:20] money you have right otherwise you'd
[1:13:22] never buy it if you went to go buy a car
[1:13:25] or whatever and then you said no it's
[1:13:26] not worth it I'll keep my money while
[1:13:28] you put your money at greater value than
[1:13:29] the car but if you do the other way
[1:13:31] around you say well it's worth it I need
[1:13:33] to buy I really need those I'm going to
[1:13:34] pay more if I have to well you put
[1:13:36] greater value on the car or whatever
[1:13:37] than the money now Jesus put more value
[1:13:39] on you than his own life that's why he
[1:13:42] died on Calvary amen if he did not think
[1:13:44] you're a value he would never have
[1:13:46] purchased your salvation but because he
[1:13:48] purchased your salvation he put your
[1:13:50] life you at greater value than his own
[1:13:53] life
[1:13:54] How Great Is Our God that's what he
[1:13:56] thinks about you and I
[1:13:57] listen we are not worthless we are worth
[1:14:00] a lot even as brother bran would try and
[1:14:02] put it into a quantity one soul is worth
[1:14:04] more than ten thousand worlds
[1:14:08] hallelujah amen to anyone who's truly
[1:14:11] been touched by God seeks that Heavenly
[1:14:13] City they have a hunger and a draw
[1:14:15] towards that place above all things sure
[1:14:18] we have a desire to get married have
[1:14:20] children have a job different travel all
[1:14:22] those different things but above all
[1:14:24] we want to see him we want to go to that
[1:14:27] Heavenly place and the Apostle Paul
[1:14:30] would speak of it in second Corinthians
[1:14:31] 5. he says for we know that of our
[1:14:34] Earthly House of this Tabernacle were
[1:14:36] dissolved we have a building of God a
[1:14:38] house not made with hands Eternal in the
[1:14:40] heavens he's saying basically I have we
[1:14:43] have a house we have a body to step into
[1:14:44] it's already there right it doesn't it's
[1:14:48] not being built it's not under
[1:14:49] construction that body is already there
[1:14:51] that that as soon as you're the last
[1:14:53] heartbeat here will be the first
[1:14:55] heartbeat over there right Hallelujah
[1:14:58] we'll just step Last Breath here first
[1:15:00] breath over we just go from here to
[1:15:01] there before we realize it amen we have
[1:15:04] a building of God a house not made with
[1:15:06] hands Eternal in the heavens you know if
[1:15:08] that really anchored into our hearts all
[1:15:10] fear would go all worry would go we
[1:15:13] would not worry about what man could do
[1:15:14] to us what the government what if we
[1:15:16] wouldn't we wouldn't be afraid of
[1:15:17] anything amen and yeah but the reason
[1:15:19] you you know way the reason we receive
[1:15:22] the Holy Ghost is because you have that
[1:15:24] house
[1:15:26] Hallelujah so the reason you received
[1:15:28] the Holy I just want to say it again the
[1:15:29] reason you've received it because many
[1:15:31] times you think am I going to make it
[1:15:32] Jesus already made it for you right but
[1:15:35] the reason he seals you into this
[1:15:36] Kingdom to the day of your Redemption is
[1:15:38] because you have that house I mean just
[1:15:40] like the reason like you know your
[1:15:42] brother Ben would say about the woman at
[1:15:44] the well compared to the scribes and
[1:15:45] Pharisees now the woman of the well
[1:15:47] received the Lord because she had
[1:15:50] representation in heaven right so she
[1:15:53] had so so on the earth she was you know
[1:15:55] she was a sinner she was Outcast of her
[1:15:58] Village no one wanted her you know she
[1:16:00] was had a bad name but in heaven she had
[1:16:02] representation she had a body Eternal in
[1:16:05] the heavens already if I put it that way
[1:16:06] right so when the light struck her she
[1:16:09] said I know your Messiah right her life
[1:16:11] was changed she was touched by the
[1:16:13] master because she had representation in
[1:16:15] heaven but the scribes and Pharisees
[1:16:17] morally they looked fine they were
[1:16:19] religious people they would have been
[1:16:20] revered on Earth but when that same
[1:16:24] Light Came their way they turned them
[1:16:26] down and the reason is I didn't have the
[1:16:27] representation in heaven
[1:16:30] so thank God we have representation in
[1:16:31] heaven you say well that's not fair I'm
[1:16:33] just happy I'm saved you know you got to
[1:16:35] look at a different way I'm just happy
[1:16:36] I'm a Believer today
[1:16:38] amen
[1:16:40] for unless we groan
[1:16:42] earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon
[1:16:45] with our house which is from heaven
[1:16:47] if so be being clothed we should we
[1:16:50] shall not be found naked now why do we
[1:16:52] earnestly want to be clothed now are
[1:16:54] there possible answers this for that we
[1:16:56] are in this Tabernacle do groan being
[1:16:58] burdened not that we should be unclothed
[1:17:01] see many people just want to leave the
[1:17:03] world because they have too many kids of
[1:17:05] Life wearing them down
[1:17:07] but that's not what the Apostle Paul
[1:17:08] says is the reason but clothed upon that
[1:17:12] mortality might be swallowed up of life
[1:17:14] now he would chat brought us for the
[1:17:17] self same thing as God who also hath
[1:17:20] given unto us the earnest of the spirit
[1:17:22] therefore we are always confident
[1:17:24] knowing that while we are home in the
[1:17:26] body we are absent from the Lord for a
[1:17:29] walk by faith and not by sight we are
[1:17:31] confident I say and willing rather to be
[1:17:33] absent from the body to be present from
[1:17:36] a present with the Lord see saying in
[1:17:38] other words this is my interpretation
[1:17:40] the reason that we have a burden to go
[1:17:43] is because not that the cares of Life
[1:17:45] are so bad we just want to be with him
[1:17:48] amen that's why I want to be closed Amen
[1:17:51] in in in immortality right because
[1:17:53] because we want to be where he is why
[1:17:56] because we've met the king of that City
[1:17:58] amen we've had a meeting with that same
[1:18:00] Melchizedek has come to you and I I
[1:18:03] trust he has he's changed your life
[1:18:06] Hallelujah
[1:18:09] amen now what I love about the Lord is
[1:18:11] he didn't just die
[1:18:13] raise again go up into heaven
[1:18:15] and that's it
[1:18:17] but he gave he he returned back with
[1:18:20] evidence of that new land just like
[1:18:22] Caleb and Joshua would return back with
[1:18:25] the grapes with the other spies as Hat's
[1:18:27] a good land let's go now we know that
[1:18:29] heaven does not type the promised land
[1:18:31] in this way because there's not there's
[1:18:33] no Wars in heaven right but there's
[1:18:36] fighting and different things here when
[1:18:39] you receive the Holy Ghost but I want to
[1:18:40] use an example they came back with
[1:18:42] evidence because the other people never
[1:18:44] went to that land but they returned back
[1:18:45] with these grapes and the things of the
[1:18:46] land saying it's a good land and so when
[1:18:49] the Lord Jesus when he rose from the
[1:18:50] grave triumphed over hell death in the
[1:18:52] grave then he he brought back evidence
[1:18:54] of that new land personally to your own
[1:18:56] and that evidence is the baptism of the
[1:18:59] Holy Ghost amen let's see no no I just
[1:19:02] want to read this I feel like always I
[1:19:03] jump ahead of myself but he says there
[1:19:05] you are heir of all things air of
[1:19:07] eternal life air of divine healings this
[1:19:09] is you I'm talking about you right now
[1:19:11] oh heir of Salvation purchase of God
[1:19:13] born of his Spirit washed in his blood

[1:19:18] praising My Savior all the day long
[1:19:20] perfect submission alls at rest and my
[1:19:23] savior am happy and blessed watching and
[1:19:25] waiting and looking above filled with
[1:19:27] his goodness and love Hallelujah there
[1:19:29] you are this is my story and this is my
[1:19:31] song I'm an ear of Salvation what is
[1:19:33] salvation something that's
[1:19:35] excuse me given to you it's a gift I'm
[1:19:38] an ear of Salvation what kind for
[1:19:40] eternal life salvation for my soul
[1:19:42] salvation for my body salvation for my
[1:19:45] from my weariness salvation for
[1:19:47] everything God made me air of everything
[1:19:49] through Christ and he died and Rose and
[1:19:52] returned back and brought the evidence
[1:19:54] and poured it out upon us
[1:19:56] o my glory o my he says so when he pours
[1:19:59] out the Holy Ghost into your life he's
[1:20:01] giving you he's returning back evidence
[1:20:03] of that land that we're going to that's
[1:20:06] why God gives us the Holy Ghost sure has
[1:20:08] to give us overcoming power and I'll
[1:20:10] walk upon the Earth right as to be the
[1:20:12] inner teacher within us right it's to
[1:20:14] guide us into all truth amen because
[1:20:16] it's God in us right amen the hope of
[1:20:18] glory but it's also evidence that
[1:20:20] there's a land to go to because we're
[1:20:22] going to realize this once we die it's
[1:20:24] not just there's nothing and this is it
[1:20:26] right no there's an eternal land that
[1:20:29] we're going to dwell in we're going to
[1:20:30] be embodies we're never going to get old
[1:20:32] we're going to be sick of weary no
[1:20:33] troubles there no Sorrows amen but we've
[1:20:36] received the evidence that the land is
[1:20:38] there
[1:20:39] Hallelujah aren't you glad amen when he
[1:20:41] said actually there's more to it than
[1:20:43] this is more than just religion and
[1:20:44] trying to learn Doctrine and things but
[1:20:46] no there's a resurrection power that
[1:20:48] comes into the believer
[1:20:49] Hallelujah so he's brought back that
[1:20:51] evidence that's why when you when he
[1:20:53] touches you he's giving you evidence you
[1:20:56] have a home beyond the river I got a
[1:20:58] home Over Yonder Hallelujah on the other
[1:21:01] Shore
[1:21:03] amen what I love about yo I would say in
[1:21:05] Ephesians that you know it's the when we
[1:21:07] receive the Holy Ghost when you seal
[1:21:09] with that Holy Spirit of Promise it's
[1:21:11] the earnest of our inheritance until the
[1:21:13] Redemption of the purchase possession
[1:21:15] unto the praise of his glory that's
[1:21:17] Ephesians 1 13 and 14. so that's the
[1:21:19] earnest or the down payment of our
[1:21:22] inheritance Hallelujah so we receive
[1:21:24] that down payment because there's more
[1:21:26] to come well why does that mortar come
[1:21:28] well there's a change of the body
[1:21:30] there's a fullness of adoption
[1:21:32] Hallelujah yo so so even even Divine
[1:21:34] Healing is the earnest of the
[1:21:36] Resurrection
[1:21:37] Hallelujah where God would Supernatural
[1:21:39] heal someone it's showing that's a down
[1:21:41] payment saying there's more because you
[1:21:43] know the the resurrection of the Dead
[1:21:45] Saints and the transformation of these
[1:21:47] bodies is going to be the massive
[1:21:49] biggest moment of Divine Healing the
[1:21:51] world has ever seen
[1:21:53] I mean we're gonna go from old to young
[1:21:55] again
[1:21:56] Hallelujah but it's actually more than
[1:21:58] just going from old to young again
[1:22:00] because if we just go young again we can
[1:22:02] get old again
[1:22:03] right but it's actually a Breaking of
[1:22:05] the cycle and I just want to say that
[1:22:06] the cycle of of of of of of life and
[1:22:09] death actually has begun to be broke in
[1:22:11] the believer's life amen when they when
[1:22:14] the apostles win 120 in the upper room
[1:22:16] in the book of Acts received the Holy
[1:22:17] Ghost there was a cycle of of of death
[1:22:21] had been broken in them because they had
[1:22:23] eternal life in their souls right amen
[1:22:25] so and and unbelief was changed into
[1:22:28] faith so there's a change of a cycle you
[1:22:31] see the cycle in the Old Testament of of
[1:22:33] of Revival and death but it's unbelief
[1:22:35] still governing the people because they
[1:22:37] were given a law because the blood of
[1:22:39] bulls and goats could never change their
[1:22:41] hearts that they could walk with God in
[1:22:42] a way that pleased him but under the
[1:22:45] blood of Jesus Christ he changes our
[1:22:47] nature that it becomes his nature so
[1:22:50] there's a change of a cycle going on now
[1:22:52] now if he has to change our hearts from
[1:22:55] unbelief to Faith now if you've received
[1:22:58] the Holy Ghost he's done that
[1:23:00] right if you're a Believer today he's
[1:23:02] done that who's a Believer who's a
[1:23:04] Christian who's a Christian right so so
[1:23:06] he's changed you from doubting the word
[1:23:08] to believing the word
[1:23:10] amen so he's beginning to change the
[1:23:11] cycle because remember God God works
[1:23:14] from the inside out
[1:23:15] because remember the last change we're
[1:23:17] going to experience is the change of the
[1:23:18] outside of these bodies right but he
[1:23:21] changes he starts on the inside from
[1:23:23] from from sin and unbelief to Faith and
[1:23:26] he works outwardly
[1:23:27] praise our God now if we look at Abraham
[1:23:30] and Sarah you know when they were when
[1:23:33] they were well up in years
[1:23:35] it's amazing that after after the
[1:23:38] visitation you know you know Abraham had
[1:23:40] had his visitation but Sarah was still
[1:23:43] doubting the promise but because she was
[1:23:45] part of the promise God had to visit her
[1:23:48] and turn her heart from unbelief to
[1:23:50] Faith you know maybe for yo you have
[1:23:52] those 25 years you begin to just get
[1:23:54] annoyed at Abraham every month he would
[1:23:56] ask her how are you feeling any
[1:23:57] different you know we're gonna have the
[1:23:59] baby and maybe she just got annoyed
[1:24:02] first Year's excitement they just become
[1:24:04] annoying because she was getting older
[1:24:06] she was getting sicker he was getting
[1:24:07] older they were both impossible to have
[1:24:09] the child I mean but but Abraham you
[1:24:12] know became stronger in faith because he
[1:24:14] had been touched by the master amen and
[1:24:16] when God touches someone he makes them
[1:24:18] stronger in faith the promise becomes
[1:24:20] more real and I trust that the Rapture
[1:24:23] you being translated from this world to
[1:24:25] the next has become more real from when
[1:24:27] you first believed it's become more of a
[1:24:29] reality that that that land that you're
[1:24:31] going to is more real than it was when
[1:24:33] you first met God why because you become
[1:24:36] stronger in the promise as you've been
[1:24:38] feeding off the Lord have been feeding
[1:24:40] off the word you become stronger amen as
[1:24:42] you walk with him but you see now that
[1:24:44] Sarah had to have a visitation and so in
[1:24:48] Genesis 18 God came down in flesh with
[1:24:51] two angels and he came and he spoke to
[1:24:53] Abraham and he said according to time of
[1:24:56] life you're going to have the promise
[1:24:57] son and and Sarah was in the tent behind
[1:24:59] him laughed at you know you know within
[1:25:01] himself but the Lord discerned her
[1:25:03] thoughts and said why did Sarah laugh
[1:25:06] according to the time of life you'll
[1:25:08] have the promised son now
[1:25:11] at this stage they were young
[1:25:14] in their bodies
[1:25:16] shortly after I don't have it here but
[1:25:17] Genesis yo yo you know there's two
[1:25:20] accounts where two kings one who want to
[1:25:22] marry Sarah
[1:25:24] no with the first account she was so
[1:25:27] Abraham was 75 when God called him so
[1:25:30] Sarah was a bit younger than that so
[1:25:32] she's well up in there she's basically
[1:25:33] Grandma already and and and and and what
[1:25:36] you know the king of Egypt wanted to
[1:25:38] marry her
[1:25:39] so she was already physically young
[1:25:41] because you think about it why would a
[1:25:42] king want to marry a grandma to have a
[1:25:44] child to continue his life
[1:25:46] that doesn't humanly make sense but
[1:25:48] because she was she looked young and
[1:25:50] beautiful right she wanted he wanted to
[1:25:53] marry her
[1:25:54] but in the law and then even Abraham
[1:25:56] told her you know tell her that you know
[1:25:58] tell tell everyone that you're my sister
[1:25:59] otherwise they'll kill me to get you and
[1:26:01] that was kind of true because they were
[1:26:03] half brother and sister but you know a
[1:26:05] white lie is still alive
[1:26:07] and then we come down to Genesis 20 so
[1:26:09] after after God comes down inflation
[1:26:11] Genesis 18 discerns the thoughts of you
[1:26:14] know Sarah's heart just like he did in
[1:26:15] this day that same God came down and
[1:26:17] revealed the thoughts of Hearts of
[1:26:19] people in this day and turned her heart
[1:26:21] from unbelief to Faith she was young but
[1:26:24] you see this is why God had to make her
[1:26:26] make us more than just make us young
[1:26:27] again he's going to changes in such a
[1:26:30] way that we can take a Rapture no if we
[1:26:32] can read this in Genesis 21 to 5 and
[1:26:35] Abraham journeyed from thence towards
[1:26:38] the South Country and dwell between
[1:26:39] kadish and sure and sojour in in Graham
[1:26:44] and Abraham said to Sarah his wife she's
[1:26:46] my sister and abimelech the king of
[1:26:48] Greer sent and took Sarah but God came
[1:26:51] to a blimelich in a Dream by night and
[1:26:54] said and behold Thou Art but a dead man
[1:26:56] for the woman which thou has taken she
[1:26:58] is a man's wife but a blimelich had not
[1:27:02] um come near her and he said Lord will
[1:27:05] thou slay also a righteous Nation
[1:27:08] but he said unto me she is my sister and
[1:27:11] she even herself said he is my brother
[1:27:13] in the Integrity of my heart and infancy
[1:27:15] of my hands have I done this
[1:27:19] so basically the next day he's going to
[1:27:21] marry Sarah
[1:27:22] and God intervene saying hold on
[1:27:25] this woman that you're going to marry
[1:27:26] tomorrow she's actually married to this
[1:27:28] man and so he's all he's all distraught
[1:27:31] because how can this be but they said
[1:27:32] they're siblings
[1:27:34] so here she was 90 odd years old
[1:27:38] why would he marry grandma
[1:27:41] to have a child
[1:27:44] see God had made them young again
[1:27:47] but you see even just making them young
[1:27:49] again couldn't break the cycle where
[1:27:50] they couldn't have a child
[1:27:52] because when that young man couldn't
[1:27:53] have children so God had to do more than
[1:27:56] just make them young again to fulfill
[1:27:58] the promise and it's the same thing with
[1:28:00] our own bodies God has to make us more
[1:28:02] than just young again also even he has
[1:28:04] to make us more than just how Adam and
[1:28:06] Eve were in the garden
[1:28:07] because Adam and Eve if we remember Adam
[1:28:10] and Eve though they were Eternal they
[1:28:12] were living in the garden in Paradise
[1:28:14] With God they had an ability to fall
[1:28:17] so God would have to change us that we
[1:28:19] go back even beyond that that we go
[1:28:22] young again but we cannot fall now
[1:28:26] as I said this starts from the inside
[1:28:28] out
[1:28:30] and just bear with me if my voice just
[1:28:31] completely breaks well we'll just we'll
[1:28:33] just quit and sing but yeah until then
[1:28:35] let's just let's just go up go uphill in
[1:28:37] a low gear now God has to change us from
[1:28:41] the inside out right so now here's the
[1:28:43] makers in such a way that we cannot fall
[1:28:46] into unbelief sure we'll have our ups
[1:28:48] and downs and our troubles and our
[1:28:50] sorrows we're not exempt from those
[1:28:51] things being Christians right but he has
[1:28:54] to change our souls that we'll always
[1:28:55] believe his word is Right amen that
[1:28:58] above all things this whole word is true
[1:29:00] and it is right and our attitude is
[1:29:02] always God is always right our reasoning
[1:29:05] is not right God is right and that's a
[1:29:07] good way to know that you know you're
[1:29:08] surrendered to God is that you take his
[1:29:10] word above your reasoning I mean you
[1:29:12] take you take yo his word above your
[1:29:15] imagination you actually take all those
[1:29:17] things and say that's second to God's
[1:29:19] word amen so now see so he had the
[1:29:23] changes on the inside that when we get
[1:29:25] there we cannot fall
[1:29:27] amen so in John 5 and 24 Jesus is a
[1:29:31] power when we're touched by God he says
[1:29:33] unto you he that heareth my word and
[1:29:37] believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:29:38] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:29:40] condemnation but his pass from Death
[1:29:43] unto life now that condemnation is the
[1:29:45] great white Throne judgment so God is
[1:29:48] saying that him that really hears my
[1:29:50] word and believeth on him that sent me
[1:29:51] hath everlasting life so they receive
[1:29:54] everlasting life right there amen when
[1:29:56] God opens your heart you hear his word
[1:29:58] more than in here but his word touches
[1:30:01] you like it touched Abraham amen then
[1:30:03] you have everlasting life see this is
[1:30:05] not just a yo giving a sinner's prayer
[1:30:08] kind of a thing in others when you give
[1:30:10] your life to God his word has an impact
[1:30:12] who's been impacted by the word of God
[1:30:14] Amen he changes you amen that you have
[1:30:17] everlasting life he says you shall not
[1:30:19] come into condemnation so in other words
[1:30:22] every man woman and child stands at a
[1:30:25] Crossroads upon the Earth they can
[1:30:27] either to go in a Rapture or they can go
[1:30:30] to the great white Throne judgment
[1:30:31] because remember everyone's going to go
[1:30:32] to either too and actually both end in
[1:30:35] the same place because the Saints will
[1:30:37] judge the world with Christ right amen
[1:30:39] so you know you know so so everyone will
[1:30:41] end up in the judgment will either be
[1:30:43] before the bar being judged or be on the
[1:30:46] Judgment seat with Christ judging the
[1:30:47] world right but but there's two ways to
[1:30:49] get there there's one either that this
[1:30:51] happens that that that that we actually
[1:30:54] hear the word means understand it not in
[1:30:56] here but in here believe of him that
[1:30:57] sent me and then you receive everlasting
[1:30:59] life I'm laboring this because I want
[1:31:01] you to never minimize you you've met God
[1:31:04] because there's always you know they can
[1:31:06] always come a fear into people's hearts
[1:31:08] am I going in a Rapture well based on
[1:31:10] the scripture if you really believe
[1:31:12] you're what your your life has been
[1:31:13] changed by his word I mean something in
[1:31:15] you says the word is right I may not
[1:31:17] understand it but it's my it's true amen
[1:31:20] and what happens is instead of standing
[1:31:22] at that Crossroad and actually God
[1:31:24] actually destroys that road that you can
[1:31:27] go to the Judgment that you go to the
[1:31:29] great white Throne judgment to be judged
[1:31:31] ah I trust this makes sense because
[1:31:33] remember if God has revealed himself
[1:31:35] like he spoke his word touched Abraham
[1:31:37] put him on a path into Glory his word
[1:31:40] has touched you right and he put you in
[1:31:43] a path into a Rapture cycle not to go
[1:31:45] the white Throne judgment I mean judge
[1:31:47] according to your works but to go and
[1:31:49] judge the world with Christ
[1:31:52] amen that makes me excited because that
[1:31:55] means I cannot go to the condemnation I
[1:31:57] cannot be standing before uh an an Angry
[1:32:00] wrathful judgeful God at the right
[1:32:02] Throne judgment
[1:32:03] because I cannot go there because I have
[1:32:05] everlasting life now because he's
[1:32:07] allowed me to believe his word it's
[1:32:09] changed me
[1:32:10] and his past from Death unto life so
[1:32:13] right now
[1:32:14] as you're sitting here
[1:32:16] if you really know him not in a
[1:32:18] religious way but you really know him
[1:32:20] you have everlasting life right now and
[1:32:23] you've passed from Death unto life right
[1:32:25] now
[1:32:26] hallelujah amen so he changes from the
[1:32:30] inside out amen that change now begins
[1:32:32] to work from here outward
[1:32:35] oh look you may say well that's just a
[1:32:37] Baptist kind of a scripture that you're
[1:32:39] quoting John 5 absolutely not that's a
[1:32:41] bright scripture I mean that's just not
[1:32:43] a dry-eyed confession I believe mentally
[1:32:45] and therefore no no there's a
[1:32:47] transformation of a life
[1:32:48] amen amen
[1:32:50] Hallelujah
[1:32:52] praise the Lord I'm kind of losing where
[1:32:54] I am no see so he has to change us that
[1:32:58] we cannot fall because remember
[1:33:00] overcoming is not taking away the thing
[1:33:03] that causes you to fall that's not
[1:33:04] overcoming that's just taking away the
[1:33:06] temptation but overcoming is a change of
[1:33:08] nature that a Thing Once came I guess
[1:33:11] you made you fall it can't make you fall
[1:33:13] anymore because your Nature's been
[1:33:14] changed right so so the so the main
[1:33:17] reason so the reason that we will not
[1:33:20] fall or we cannot sin you know once
[1:33:22] we're in a new body it's not because the
[1:33:24] devil's done away with
[1:33:25] that's that's not the reason no the
[1:33:28] reason is these changes in such a way
[1:33:29] that we cannot accept his life like Eve
[1:33:32] did and his changes in such a way now
[1:33:35] that we cannot accept his lie on the
[1:33:37] side Hallelujah that we will take God's
[1:33:40] word because remember my sheep know my
[1:33:41] voice a stranger thou not follow so if
[1:33:44] we are his sheep we know his voice the
[1:33:46] voice of the word and we cannot follow a
[1:33:47] stranger
[1:33:48] Hallelujah that makes me enthused amen
[1:33:51] because he's so so he's going to change
[1:33:53] us not just to be young again
[1:33:56] but change our bodies that we can
[1:33:58] actually meet the Lord in the air just
[1:34:01] like Abraham and Sarah he didn't just
[1:34:03] make them young again but he had to
[1:34:05] change their bodies not just young but
[1:34:08] they could have the child they could
[1:34:09] actually receive the promised son and is
[1:34:11] that what and but that all started when
[1:34:14] they turned their hearts when God turned
[1:34:15] their hearts from unbelief to Faith In
[1:34:17] The Promise
[1:34:18] amen that's why it says in Hebrews 11
[1:34:21] that by faith Abraham Sarah received
[1:34:24] strength as she conceived seed judging
[1:34:26] him as faithful whom is promised
[1:34:28] Hallelujah
[1:34:30] praise the Lord amen so we can look into
[1:34:32] this so we can say God you're so good
[1:34:34] that you come and touch people
[1:34:36] amen that you still that you still come
[1:34:39] and change lives
[1:34:40] amen remember because once once upon a
[1:34:43] time I'm just gonna I'm just gonna kind
[1:34:44] of wrap this up with this thought here
[1:34:46] we're going to continue in Ephesians 2.
[1:34:48] I just love this chapter
[1:34:49] he says now he says but now in Christ
[1:34:53] Jesus who sometimes were a far-off or
[1:34:55] made Night by the blood of Christ for he
[1:34:57] is our peace who have made both one hath
[1:34:59] broken down the middle wall of partition
[1:35:01] between us having abolished in his flesh
[1:35:03] the enmity having the law of
[1:35:05] Commandments obtained in ordinances for
[1:35:07] to making himself of Twain one new man
[1:35:09] so making peace and that he might
[1:35:12] reconcile both unto God and one body by
[1:35:14] the cross having sland the enmity
[1:35:16] thereby and came and preached peace to
[1:35:19] you which is afar off and to them that
[1:35:21] will nigh for through him pardon me we
[1:35:24] both have access by one Spirit unto the
[1:35:26] father now therefore we are no more
[1:35:28] strangers and foreigners but fellow
[1:35:30] citizens with the Saints and with the
[1:35:32] household of God and are built upon the
[1:35:35] foundation the apostles and Prophets
[1:35:36] Jesus Christ himself being the Chief
[1:35:38] Cornerstone so we are the household of
[1:35:41] faith where the household of God I was
[1:35:43] going to finish with this thought so now
[1:35:45] any any nation has a certain spirit
[1:35:48] you come to New Zealand there's a kiwi
[1:35:50] Spirit go to Australia there's an
[1:35:51] Australian Spirit you go to different
[1:35:53] countries around the world and and the
[1:35:55] people are governed by that Spirit even
[1:35:57] different causes have gone Global and
[1:36:01] that Spirit has spread around the world
[1:36:02] you take like you know decades ago when
[1:36:05] Communism spread people from different
[1:36:07] nations receive that same Spirit they
[1:36:10] became the same kind of people why
[1:36:11] because that movement went Global they
[1:36:13] became a household of something
[1:36:15] different now when God touches you or me
[1:36:18] we become the household of God
[1:36:22] so if we are the household of God we
[1:36:25] speak different we act differently than
[1:36:26] the nation we're born in
[1:36:28] I mean that's why we can be the United
[1:36:30] Nations and we can speak the same kind
[1:36:32] of way we can have the same kind of
[1:36:34] language of Faith amen the same kind of
[1:36:37] the same kind of spirit the spirit of
[1:36:39] God
[1:36:40] hallelujah amen the weekend you know we
[1:36:43] can speak peace we can speak faith we
[1:36:45] can have the same goal what is that goal
[1:36:48] I met the maker of that City
[1:36:51] Hallelujah and what's our goal say tell
[1:36:54] everyone come with me
[1:36:55] come with me come seek a City who's
[1:36:59] building maker is God why are you
[1:37:01] seeking that kind of a city is it
[1:37:03] because the world's so bad no because he
[1:37:04] touched me I met the king of that City
[1:37:07] and I want to go be in that City I want
[1:37:09] to see I want to see the king of that
[1:37:10] City
[1:37:11] amen so I trust it was once upon you
[1:37:14] know I just take it in this butchered
[1:37:16] way one time you were one way
[1:37:19] and you knew he could do it but then he
[1:37:22] came and did it
[1:37:23] holy and now you're no longer the same
[1:37:25] blind Bartimaeus would would Beg by the
[1:37:28] gates of Jericho and he knew God could
[1:37:30] do it brother Brown would dramatize and
[1:37:33] say you know his mother would sit him on
[1:37:34] his knee and tell him about the great
[1:37:35] stories that happened in his City
[1:37:38] amen how how Jericho's walls came
[1:37:40] tumbling down with Joshua how the Jordan
[1:37:43] became a dry land as the when the ark
[1:37:45] went into it and you know when Elisha
[1:37:47] and Elijah crossed supernaturally than
[1:37:50] Elisha you know then Elijah went up in a
[1:37:52] you know Chariot of fire that Elijah
[1:37:54] came back with his mantle smother Jordan
[1:37:55] again crossed back over and incredible
[1:37:57] things happen in that City
[1:37:59] and then he began to think if only I
[1:38:01] lived back in those days
[1:38:03] you know so he knew Jehovah God could
[1:38:05] give a sight back
[1:38:07] but then one day the master came his way
[1:38:10] where there's a hunger God will meet
[1:38:12] that hunger so he knew it could be done
[1:38:14] then it was done then he could Marvel
[1:38:16] the rest of his days he did it I'm just
[1:38:18] taking uh Christine's phrase and
[1:38:20] Elizabeth he did it Hallelujah and then
[1:38:22] while we can Rejoice he did it how did
[1:38:24] he do it I can't really describe it but
[1:38:26] he changed me and he changed my desires
[1:38:29] he threw them Heavenly that now I want
[1:38:31] to go be where he is
[1:38:32] never let the devil try and Rob you off
[1:38:34] that that's Eternal God did you know
[1:38:36] Abraham went through a lot of trouble
[1:38:37] but he said I'm still looking for that

[1:38:40] because I met the king of that City amen
[1:38:42] I trust that that's our highest desire
