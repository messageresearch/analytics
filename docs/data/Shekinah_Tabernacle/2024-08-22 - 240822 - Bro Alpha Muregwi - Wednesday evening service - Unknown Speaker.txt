brother sister hallelujah what could happen hallelujah praise the lord the holy spirit moving over every heart that's been regenerated became a new creature in christ jesus all sins under the blood hallelujah i was listening in the morning the prophet was preaching in the message in his presence he says as soon as we enter into the presence of the lord the first thing that you see is your unworthiness as soon as you enter into your presence of the lord you see your sins they pop up hallelujah oh lord i want to be in the presence of the lord tonight so that he can take off all the just

just enter in the presence of the lord tonight your problem that you're facing will be over tonight that black fleeting state that you are my brother you'll be out of it tonight hallelujah amen glory to god amen sins under the blood as we speak right now brother sister your unconfessed the sin is out of the blood that's right but if you want your sins to be in the blood just confess them right now they will be all hidden under the blood that is why when the presence of the lord comes down it can pick it up and can say there is a sister in here hallelujah who's not living right and proper why because your sin is floating on top of the blood that's right and the spirit of the blood can pick it up yes yes and this is the time that's right the devil you've been playing for quite too long playing around with the children of god but devil your time is over we are coming for you right now wherever where you are hiding the spirit of the lord who sets you the spirit of the lord will pick you up brother sister i believe the time of ananias and safira is over brother you've been lying out towards the holy spirit for quite a long time but i believe the holy ghost has taken the corner there is a corner amen you have played teach enough hallelujah you have you have you ever played hypocrisy for quite a long time now brother this is the time when all sins will be picked up yes amen you will not enter through the door brother when you're having your sins hallelujah when the holy ghost comes down it will pick up all those little things blood let's say lord while is this still today may you please forgive me lord i promise you oh god as soon as i get out of this room i'll go and see my precious brother i'll go and see my brother sister i'll go and return all those things that i stole i'll repent of everything that i've done wrong oh amen hallelujah a humble and a contrived spirit you will not despise hallelujah i feel the presence of the lord is in this place he can do anything my brother tonight he can feel you tonight he can visit you tonight just let all those things away from you just agree to let off and let the blood come and wash you let the blood come and wash you till you are clean hallelujah he said come let us reason together though your sins be red as scarlet is ready to forgive you even if you kill somebody even if you are putting brother he's ready to forgive you he's ready to give you another start hallelujah he's ready to give you another start he's ready to start a new fresh patch with you amen hallelujah oh my god hallelujah praise the lord he is free my brother he wants us to welcome you back he wants to have a communion with you tonight hallelujah he wants to have the preeminence in your life but those sins i don't have enough time i could have read you another quote where the prophet says your unconfessed sin can cause this church to utterly fail one man with a stolen babylonian garment caused the death of 36 soldiers when there was a promise of god from god that none of your soldiers will die that's right hallelujah but after 36 soldiers were dead then joshua called for a hold and he said there's something wrong here there is a promise god promised me that none of my soldiers will die but these 36 that are dead now what's happening yes why our sick not being healed brother andy why our young people not receiving the holy ghost why are we why our families continue on breaking down when there is a promise of the lord there is something wrong there is something wrong why can't people live holy lives there is something wrong we need to cast our loss amen yes hallelujah we need the spirit of prophecy to come and pick up all those little things we need the power of god to come and pick up all those little things do you know the presence of the lord wants to fill this house right now but there's some blocking things that are holding that's right there's someone who's still holding something from the world in his life that's right but this is the time we say goodbye old world goodbye old world she kinda will never be the same again we will never be the same okay new zealand pride will never be the same again all hatred has been put away oh oh back by the spirit have been put away we let the holy ghost move yes amen every sin is now under the blood every sin is now under the blood that's why you can't pray enough because your sins are popping up they are blocking you that's why you can make a breakthrough oh lord that's right hallelujah that's why the bible says in the days of ely hallelujah there was no open vision what happens when there is no open vision they sin seeing tabernacles in the church but once samuel came back as a prophet brother all the restoration came back there was no sin and we need the spirit of the lord back in the church once again we want the holy ghost himself to come down and raid once the holy ghost is here you will never come in the house of the lord with your death today we still have the young people that come to church after playing dirty in the world then they come they come and do whatever they do here and we think they're brothers but inside they're rotten dead oh lord hallelujah we think we've got sisters we've got young young young leaders but they are all mothers already but we don't know about it but they are doing it that's why though some of us they can't receive the holy ghost but they've been repenting all their lives they've been doing everything right but there's one lady there's one boy there's one mother there's one father who's not living right oh jesus but we want the holy ghost to move tonight we want the power of the holy ghost to calm down hide us all of our sins under the presence of the lord we need to bask our life in the presence of the holy spirit say lord search my heart set my soul if therefore there is anything that's wrong in my life lord just pull it out of me lord just let it out of me let god help you hallelujah humble your life enough hallelujah a humble and contrived spirit he will not despise amen that's right glory thank you father praise the lord it's a prayer meeting tonight praise the lord i feel we can just finish it up here may the lord bless you saints how many won the presence of the lord tonight how many wants the spirit of the lord hallelujah if you had finished that if you managed to finish ah the code the prophet will say in the presence of the lord where there is no sin no cigarette smoked no short hair no short dress the presence of the lord who were moving in that place that's the place that we want tonight my brother this is what we want when we get into the presence of the lord we just simply dive in the presence of the lord but today is so hard a thing to come to church because you have lose that joy oh i want to cry like david that day lord create in me a clean out of god and renew a right spirit within me renew a right spiral within me cast me not away oh god from thine presence oh god that's my desire lord yes lord i might have sinned but cast me not away from that process renew a right spirit within me renew the right spirit within me brother he is still on the throne interceding for you he's still the lamp he's still the lamp run for the message run for the message he's still there to our taunt for you he's our attorney he can represent you hallelujah he's ready to forgive you right now if you can only confess your sins if you can let go the prophet says let go and let god have his own way say lordy am i i'm your child i'm your daughter yes lord i've been slacking in my christian walk but lord i need to break bust out myself lord help me once again i need to come back to the fold lord i need to come back in that night lord i want to be in your presence hallelujah i want to stay in your presence oh god i will not die in your presence hallelujah he's here tonight as musicians if they can play us a good music hallelujah you get each and everyone if you want to come to the altar it's up to you you want to make your place an older up to you but we need to reach unto the lord we cry our sins out unto the lord cry and boohoo and say lord i will hold on to the horns of an altar lord i am identified with my sacrifice tonight hallelujah like the children of israel brother when they are done wrong they will take a lamp they will drag it to the temple do it during daylight brother sister they would take it to the temple they were identified with their sacrifice and when they get to the altar and the lamp was being cut a sinner would embrace the lamp and you'd feel the blood coming out of the lamp then you feel that blood coming out of the lamp then in his mind you'd think that was supposed to be me dying but the lamb has died in my place brother elam died in your place why do you want to remain a sinner when god has made a way for you to get out of the sinful life amen the blood of the lord
