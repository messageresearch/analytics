again and I believe that's what we are going to accomplish here is that we're going to get ourselves out of the way and the living God is going to meet us and every time that he does it's always awesome and it's always it always changes us and makes us better because that's what God does and it's so wonderful to be in in a place in an atmosphere where the spirit of God can be welcome and we're going to have a really good time at this camp it's going to be a really good time yes sir and so Amen now we've just got to do a few um formalities before we start the service so we've the um

Now is the time amen the devil I say maybe one day one time when you get good enough for long enough some you know some nonsense no now's the time amen so don't I'm not trying to pressure anyone but

the baby that was that was shown to be dead and she went to the meeting and she pushed through everyone to get to the prophet not to contact him but the contact of God revealing himself through amen

seats cuz we've got a little special for you tonight before we start and then we're going to sing it through once and then you guys are going to join in the second time who was here at the last camp hey heaps of you wow cool good okay so last year what was the theme song that we rang you know we did a song every start of every service [Music] lift up your head lift lift up your head so you gates let the king of glory make him and so so it kind of worked we just that just became our theme song and some of the brethren that came hadn't actually heard it so they they brought it back to their church and sang it there and and and um in the fellowship back in Wellington we always call that the camp song you know let's sing the camp song and um and then we thought well that would that's a nice thing to do that it kind of encapsulated the camp and when every time we sing it we think about the camp and the atmosphere and the good times that we had and we thought we would do something similar um but then we thought well we won't do the same song though because I don't know it was a good song but God keeps growing and moving you know he builds on top of everything and keeps going so um so so the the team and I actually have put a song together and you wouldn't have heard this one before cuz this is a new one and it sort of all came together and we feel that it came together for the camp so so this is going to be our our camp song and we believe that it will be a blessing to you guys and I'll just bring up the words i'll read you through the words and the song is about being free it's tying in um the Jubilee how when you know when the man when he went to slavery if he had debts and things he couldn't pay and he got sold into slavery there was a certain after 50 years he could go free and you know I'll just read through these these vers these verses here then we'll talk a we bit so the verse one is years and years I labored toil and tears were my meat since my deaths took me prisoner sold me to slavery but every day that I toiled the jubilee was drawing closer the 49th year was the longest year then I heard the trumpet sound and when I heard the jubilee I walked free amen i walked free and I ain't going back to slavery because Jesus has set me free amen and then this then the second verse is years I spent in confusion i had eyes but couldn't see the enemy had me stumbling in darkness spiritual slavery but then I heard the prophet speaking i heard the voice behind the voice he opened up the word and let the light shine in said "You can all go free." And when I heard the jubilee I walked free i walked free amen and I ain't going back to slavery because Jesus has set me free and you know we've heard that Jubilee call you can all go free free from and it's not just a oh let's just say it it's a good feeling free from any complex free from anything that's not of God you can go free from it you can all go free just claim it it doesn't matter how much of a burden you had upon you just walk out say "I'm free."

Hallelujah it's not the condition you're in it doesn't matter the life you've lived or what battles you wrestle with he doesn't look at that he looks beyond that he looks at the seed in you hallelujah so don't worry about what condition you're in amen if there's a deep there's a deep to respond to that deep hallelujah and don't let the devil cloud it and say "Well you don't deserve it you're not worthy." Well of course we're not worthy i can say that's the one thing I agree with the devil on is I'm not worthy but my opinion and the devil's opinion doesn't come into it it's God's opinion amen if God said before the foundation of the world I have called him or her she's going to come all that the father has given me already given will come to me and also all that come to me i'll know why it's cast out hallelujah the devil say you're not predestinated you don't belong to God that's a lie hallelujah and just just say Jesus I come cuz you said if I come you won't cast me out and the reason there's a longing he put that longing there that's not your ambition and your longing that's God's longing hallelujah that God has ordained these meetings cuz he wants fellowship with you he wants to talk to you he wants to you know have a relationship with you this message is not a religion it's a it's a marriage relationship a love relationship between us and God that's right hallelujah and that's why we're here if you've never entered into that relationship you know you may see people rejoice and shout and say "What are those people on about?" Just just open your heart for a second god needs one second and he'll change you forever if you're willing to let him do it brother Ram says in doors and a door he says just open the door and then he'll come and do it so you don't reform yourself you open the door and he transforms you amen this is not some Catholic religion if we do certain things to get certain places just give it all just open every door and he will rearrange you hallelujah and if he does the work it's eternal amen so amen let's just sing this i love this chorus i'm amazed that you love me amen let's just lift our hands and worship the Lord as just our brother Tim comes amen let's sing this a time or two i'm amazed all that you love me i'm amazed yes I am how you came to your graious and my sins are washed they're all washed away all my sins are washed away let's sing that again together oh I'm amazed that you love me i'm amazed how you care through your preious blood I found pardon and my sins are washed they're all washed away my sins are washed away oh let's sing it one more time with all of our hearts i'm amazed yes Lord that you love me oh I'm amazed how you came through your preious blood i found pardon and my sins are washed they're all washed away my sins are washed away hallelujah amen are you glad for that tonight amen you can have your seats for a moment thank you that's all the singing that we'll do for now greet you all in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ it's good to be here in New Zealand and uh uh to experience the country the people and especially God's people for the first time down in this part of the country i know some of you have been to Canada uh God's country and uh how many have been to Canada amen quite a few of you how many have we met before how many have met me before amen nice to see you again and uh those of you that haven't met me before my name is Tim Dodd as you've heard I come from Cloverdale and I bring you greetings greetings from brother Ed Bisll who said to bring these greetings to the saints down here and express his love and appreciation and all the saints in the church send their greetings and the different ministers that we have there it's an honor to be here and I want to thank brother Ben for the invitation he has uh uh graciously invited me to participate with you in this camp meeting and I guess for all of us to participate together with the Holy Spirit is really what it's all about we've come together to set aside the weekend that as our brother said that God might speak to us we the gift is just a mute instrument it's just the man is just a vessel and he can only yield himself to the Lord but it takes God to come on the scene and do something for us this weekend you believe that and uh we certainly want him to do that with all of our hearts this weekend uh I want to just say that I I've been taking a few pictures here and there as we've gone along the way and send some to my wife who sends her greetings and uh she said "Next time you go to New Zealand if there is a next time maybe when I'm done preaching there won't be a next time." But you know if there is a next time you know then we just She says "You got to bring me with you." She just so appreciated what she's seen uh by way of internet i was talking to brother Donaldson uh who we visited it visited with the other day and I said "You know it must have been hard back in the day i I remember when I first started out traveling and going into countries like India and and into African countries and you used to have to to search around for an internet cafe to try and send an email home and you'd have to sit there and type it out and send it off and and your family would get it eventually and they'd reply but uh now we have these cell phones and it's just instant communication and connection so it's not so hard as it used to be uh although we all like to be at home but there was a day when the message was new uh and I I just want to say something about that when it was just after God had sent a prophet and there were those that were traveling in the in the places that had never heard the message and you know they didn't have even internet cafes there was no internet back there they were traveling without cell phones they were breaking ground for us that we who have come in in this what looks like the last generation that we might have an easier road to travel and so we certainly appreciate those old saints that have plowed the ground for us amen and if and if you are here from that generation God bless you richly and but we've come to a time now that we believe we're the iniquity of the Amorites is just about full the world has turned into a a very uh wicked place and uh the devil has brought his Satan's Eden to his perfection but as the devil took a woman out of God's Eden to corrupt God is taking a woman out of Satan's Eden to perfect and so we praise God for that tonight are you looking forward to the word how many are hungry tonight amen how many are expecting tonight amen let's stand together and take our Bibles and turn to the book of Revelation chapter 6 sorry to make you stand and sit down i didn't know how long it would take me to get all the butterflies in order i'm sure they're not all in order but we want to just uh trust the Lord that he will direct us this evening the way that we should go we have a lot on our uh people say a lot on their forks uh preachers like to say we have a lot on our forks a lot of hay in our wagon we got a Chinese brother at home Brother Murphy Wong he says "We have I have a lot on my chopsticks." And uh and so we we have different means of eating but we're all eating the same thing amen we're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man let's bow our heads together in a word of prayer wonderful heavenly father you are the author of life and you're the giver of every good gift lord nothing happens in this world but what you know of it and you allow it oh God though we find Satan doing many evil things but Lord you have allowed it all for a purpose in the midst of it all Lord you are bringing about a redemptive purpose lord we are so honored to be living in the last days this is the most glorious age the greatest age when you would come in the fullness of your word for Lord you are the word that is right in the midst of your people tonight you are the one that discerns the thoughts and intents of every heart Lord and Father with all of my heart I want to just get myself out of the way and I believe that that is the prayer of everybody that's here we don't want our thoughts to be in the forefront Lord we want the distractions the labors of the day the travels everything that we put in to get to this place lord it's not about the the suppers it's not about the fellowship it's not about the what might happen during the daytime it's the central theme of it all is right now lord may you come in the power of your word may you look upon our hearts knowing what we have need of and direct the minister according to the way that you would desire it tonight amen we yield ourselves to you Lord the speaker and the hearer asking Father that not our will but your will be done lord I remember many years ago praying that those very words and it changed the course of my life and Lord now tonight we pray that your will would be done we ask Lord your blessing upon the reading and the speaking of your word in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen revelation chapter 6 and we'll read from verse 7 i want to just read a little bit on the fourth seal we're not speaking on the fourth field but I want to speak about captured by love delivered from hell and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth beast say "Come and see." I would stop there and say "We know that the fourth beast is the fourth anointing yeah the lion the ox the man and the eagle are the four anointings the eagle being the anointing of the Lord that flew out in the opening of the seals to combat the antichrist spirit in our age all right so it was the eagle that screamed "Come and see." Amen and I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth amen the Lord add his blessing to the word you may be seated i hope it's all right this is a camp meeting i can take my jacket off make myself at home amen now I want you to if you would my brother put that slideshow up for me right away and I want to just uh look for a moment on uh a few things just to bring it to your attention as a bit of a foundation uh this evening and I believe that the Lord has a mind for these meetings i believe that he knew I would be here and he knew that you would be here and he prepared me and he prepared you and because he's the one that wants to meet with us we are so fortunate to live in this time this seal is our seal it's it's the we we see the devil exposed he's given a name and his name is death if you give me I'll just point at you and you can do that that's great and when he had opened the fourth beast the fourth uh the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth beast say "Come and see." And I looked in a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and I want you to notice that now because now this one who was a master of disguise hiding himself so subtly in the seven church ages till even under the first seal he was a white horse rider and many throughout the ages thought it was Christ right he was he was disguising himself but he but he was moving in subtlety within the church and that and he be what began first as a as a a spirit and then become a doctrine and on into the church and how he began to sew different things so that there was two vines growing within the framework of the church but in the last days the two vines would be exposed and the bride would be able to discern the difference between the true vine and the false vine and she would be able to withstand the false vine and by doing so she would become an invincible army amen all right now it's so it says here him that sat on this horse was death and hell followed with him i got my clicker there at the back i'm just practicing with a finger here all right says "And it's," and I want to read out of the amplified it says "And its writer's name was death and Hades the realm of the dead followed him closely." All right so now this puts a little bit different perspective on it not necessarily to believers but from the King James it it shows us that that this one who was whose name was death there was a region that was following him it's a region of those that are lost that are eternally separated from God because that's what hell is hell was created for the devil and his angels and those that the devil takes captive is the ones that he takes to hell but now when he rides out in this hour as he's moving in this generation his name is death and a hell or Hades the region of the dead is following him closely all right now in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 the apostle Paul picks this up we realize the book of revel revelation was a series of visions that was seen by John and on the aisle of Patmos over the course of two years and many times that's why people cannot uh catch the continuity of the book of Revelation because they're different visions it's not all one vision so John saw a vision of Christ in the midst of the church john saw a vision of the seven church ages john saw a vision of the throne and the and the lamb redeeming the book john sees the vision of the opening of the seal so you see it's a series of visions and John just happens to record them in the way that he sees them but now in 1 Corinthians 15 Paul by the same Holy Spirit that gave John the vision is that right he's now seeing the end time and he describes it here and he says "Behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed praise the Lord for this corruptible must put on incorruption amen i like the uncction of the Holy Spirit there this corruptible must put on incorruption every day of your life you ought to have that attitude this corruptible must put on incorruption it doesn't have a choice because I have received the word of the Lord this corruptible must put on incorruption this mortal must put on immortality amen so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory so now here's the Apostle Paul caught up in the spirit in the last days maybe not by vision like John was precisely but he's still in the same anointing and he catches it on this last verse and he says "Oh death where is thy sting oh grave Hades the regions of the lost where is thy victory?" So Paul describes the victory in this hour the final victory which is the body change and he says "Death and hell can have no victory over us." Amen we're living in that generation hallelujah where hell is riding out in this in this realm and we realize that we're we're combating something here all right all right here we go brother Brandham said makes this statement he says there's a certain person said to me he said "I believe you're an antichrist." I said "If amen." Brother Brandham says I said "If that would be pleasing to my Lord that's what I want to be." Don't get too many amens when we read that one do we he says "I want to be whatever he wants me to be." How many would say amen to that i love him and if he should cast me into hell I will still love I still will love him if I go with the same spirit that I have now he's talking about the same attitude that he has now and then he says "He looked at me kind of strange probably kind of like you're looking at me right now." And and so Brother Brandham was saying you know it doesn't matter because I'm so in love with God if he would cast me into hell I would still love him and many times we look at ourselves and say I wonder if we could measure up to that but if you're here tonight full of the Holy Ghost loving the Lord I will say you have already measured up to this amen because you are living in hell that's right death has ridden out and hell follows after him hello you're living in the re in the time where the scripture says it would be hell upon the earth where demon powers would be streaming forth where 200,000 thousand or 200 million spiritual demons more than ever before would be moving back and forth in this earth taking the deceived and turning them against the elect turned against the Jews in the natural and turned against the bride and the spiritual so we realize we're right now living in a region where there's hell all around us it's Satan's Eden it's bombarding us over the media it's bombarding us where in the in the stores i I was sitting today i had to check out of my hotel before Brother Ben arrived and he was busy running some errands and so I was sitting in the lobby and they're they're sitting in the hotel lobby they're bombarding the lobby with rock and roll music i'm thinking I don't want to sit in this atmosphere and so I checked my bags with them and I said I'm going to go for a walk i'll come back when brother Ben arrives and so I went down for a walk down the street but there was hell down the street everywhere you look there's hell on every side i went into the coffee shop and there was hell playing over the loudspeakers everywhere that I walked around and it isn't just New Zealand it's Canada too america too it's every nation in the world wherever you go it's hell on every hand but though he cast me into hell I will still love him hallelujah doesn't matter that the music of hell is playing on every hand I still love him and I hate that music you know I used to love rock and roll music right i used to love it when I was in the world and actually when I was in the denomination is where I came from and I had a taste for rock and roll music used to play it all the time but when God changed my life when the word came by my way what I once love I now hate i cannot stand to hear those kind of things anymore whereas once it was the the diet that I fed upon what happened i once walked according to the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience and we all did but God who is rich in mercy came by my way and brought me in the midst of hell into his presence thank you Lord amen so that I can see hell on every hand i I was I was reading the news the other day and and uh I was uh there was they were talking about a show found out it was a television show all I knew was was that it was a show because it had been in the news quite often and it was quite popular and uh and so I won't tell you the title of it i don't know if I even remember the title of it but they were they were always talking about this in the news so So I was reading this article and they had a a clip and they call it I think a trailer i thought a trailer was something you pulled behind a vehicle but they had a trailer that uh is like a I don't know how you describe it's a series of scenes a short little clip of the scenes that are in the show all right and so they had it in the article because it's on the internet now you get print you get pictures you get video you get whatever you want and so I thought you know I'm going to I'm going to look at this short video i don't want to look at the whole show but I'll look at the short video because everybody's talking about this show i want to see what they're talking about it was about a two-minute video i guess that's two minutes and just a short video and uh and so as I I clicked play I could only take about 30 seconds of it and I had to shut it off it wasn't immoral uh as far as nudity or anything like that but it was violent and vile and corrupt and I it just shocked me and I don't think I'm that naive in the world but it just so shocked me so much i thought it ought to be against the law to even portray what they're portraying in a video it ought to be a criminal act what is it the people have gone insane hell is upon the earth their minds are being prepared for the tribulation time where they'll they'll come in the imagination of their thoughts they'll go to totally insane because they'll imagine that they're seeing giant creatures and things city blocks wide and as brother Brandham describes it it'll be a it'll be a mental thing in their minds what is it it's the very things they're seeing in their movies right now the statistics are that over half the population United States are on some kind of anxiety medication over half the population listen New Zealand's no different i was talking to the brothers they say New Zealand has one of the highest suicide rates in the world beautiful country like this and has everything going for it what is it it's insanity and it's hell that's bombarding the minds of the people and you're in the midst of it but though we're in the midst of it I'll still love him thank you Lord i will still love him it doesn't matter what happens I'll still love him amen that's right amen so you're here amen praise the Lord here we are let's get used to it not get used to hell but used to the fact of where we are and what it means all right now we realize we've come through seven church ages and uh you know we use this terminology and I'm going to put some terminology up here not to discuss it but just to this brother is very sick right now all right we're going to pray for everybody bow your heads heavenly Father Lord we just lay hands upon our brother in the name of Jesus Christ lord I ask that you will come on the scene and restore him oh God lord he's perhaps overheated but Lord right now in the midst of your people Lord may the healing virtue that was loosed at Calvary come upon his mortal body lord in Jesus Christ's name we lay hands upon him and you said these signs would follow them that believe if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover so we rebuke this illness in the name of Jesus Christ for the glory of the kingdom of God amen and amen hallelujah hallelujah how you feeling not good take him to the back there get him some fresh air you're right maybe it's another brother help him out there amen amen he'll be fine just get him some fresh air and some water amen the word Hallelujah heals amen all right so now we've come through seven church ages and we realize that we've arrived at the Leodysian age and you know we we can talk about all the seven uh messengers and the seven ages and all of those kind of things and it's and it's terminology that we use in the message we realize that in the Bible that there's five comeings of Elijah and and uh they're coming the last one is coming to Israel but we've come in the time of the fourth coming of Elijah which is brother Brandham and how that his ministry was sent in this last days to turn the hearts of the children back to the father we know that that we've come through three exoduses and we're in the third exodus the first exodus was Israel coming out of Egypt the second exodus was the church coming from law to grace the third exodus is the exodus we're in i'm showing you all these things for a reason we're in the fourth seal as I already said under the fourth anointing we could talk about the day of the Lord the shout voice and trumpet how that perilous times is come when men shall be lovers of themselves more than lovers of God you know that's that's one almost that we could stop on and talk about how that we're in a narcissistic age you know how that that uh uh how many knows what narcissism is all right narcissism actually comes from a Greek it's a Greek term that comes from the story of Narcissus and Narcissus was a a man that was cursed by the gods to fall in love with himself and so when he when he happened to come across a pool of water you know he he he looked into the pool of water and he saw him his own reflection and you know he was so in love with his own reflection that he immediately had to take a picture of himself and post it on Facebook amen narcissistic men shall be lovers of their own selves more than lovers of God amen heady high-minded false accusers etc etc we're living in those kind of times oh maybe you never heard about Facebook but that's the kind of time that we're living in as it was in the days of Lot as it was in the days of Noah that's the hour that we're living in then when Lot's day when they ate they drank they married they were given in marriage which things in themselves are not bad but when those are all that people think about that's when it becomes evil and they're all the people's minds was on their daytoday lives and you know it can get that way amongst believers hello it can get that way to the job consumes our thoughts and then the family and and marriages and what's going to happen with our life and you know young girls are so worried about you know who am I going to marry and boys are worried about you know who's going to be the right one for me listen the thing you need to worry about is being the right one not finding the right one amen god will do the finding if you'll do the being amen amen as it was in Lot's day as it was in Noah's day we could talk about a bride age and how that we've come not beyond seven church ages we're still in Leodosa if we talk about time but in the midst of Leadyia a church a bride has been called out of a church and we realize even there was a prophet that said "I no longer call you church but I call you bride." And if we could only realize and I'll maybe speak about that in another service but it wasn't the voice of a prophet and that's why it's not the gift it's the voice that's speaking through the gift it wasn't a man that was saying "I no longer call you church i call you bride." It was the bridegroom that was saying "I no longer call you church i call you bride." Amen what an age to be living in where the where brother Brandham said there'll be another Ephesian age so we'll come right back to the beginning the original word but there'll be a great falling away in this age and you know we could go on and on and on and talk about all these things but the important part is this part you're here all right regardless of what's going on around you you're here and furthermore God is here and that's why the Apostle Paul picks it up in Romans chapter 8 and he says "What shall we then say to these things if God be before us who can be against us all right israel Kadesh Barnea had a similar issue there's a lot of distractions to rob them from the inheritance that laid right before them do you realize that the word has been revealed the mystery of God is finished i think we realize that as believers i'm speaking to believers amen and that all the promises or the full word of God is in effect there's nothing that's not in effect absolutely and the mystery of God being finished the lamb redeeming the book has brought the title deed back not for angels but for the human the human race the sons and daughters of God to have an inheritance so like Israel was at Kadesh Barnea we are standing right with the title deed within our hands we are called to possess all of it all right but look at what Israel had just been through just for a moment they had seen the two signs that God had given Moses supernatural ministry that attracted their attention and then they rec they they were in the midst of Egypt uh under bondage but there come 10 plagues upon Egypt the last plague of course being death and they were there to see all of these catastrophic events that were there in uh uh Egypt and we realize that as believers we are in birth pains or and I say we we're in the midst of an earth with birth pains this birth must give way this earth must give way by birth to another civilization there's going to be a people come upon the face of the earth that the earth was made for the earth was not made for what's on it right now this is Satan's corruption of the creation but the righteous in the millennium time will walk out upon the ashes of the wicked and so we see where that like Israel were standing at just such a moment you know they they had just come through the passage of the Red Sea they had been on the other side where it looked like they were trapped and how that God likes to bring his people into situations where he can show his power and show how much he loves them you know you'd never know him as as a healer if you didn't get sick amen that's right you never knew him as a deliverer if you never were in bondage you never knew him as a savior if you were never lost and so God wants to reveal himself in certain ways so Israel were trapped by the Red Sea but God supernaturally opened the Red Sea and then closed it upon the Egyptians that were pursuing them there they ran out of water not a good thing but God sent Moses to strike the rock and they already drank water from the rock supernatural mana from heaven they run out of food but God sent me food from heaven to supernaturally appear every morning they had been to the mountain and they had seen his presence on the mountain and so they experienced all of these things and and they they saw the Ten Commandments come from God on the mountain and the tabernacle was established there by the mountain and and they they also had already seen some things that were not very good miam was smitten with leprosy dayan and Kora was still in their midst they had had a pl a couple of plagues already amongst themselves and so this has all happened in the space of two years all right now let's stop for a minute we often read the Bible and just kind of glaze over this if all of these things had happened in New Zealand in the last two years I would be speaking to a shell shocked people come on and they didn't have the Holy Ghost but God was expecting by this time in the space of two years hello in the space of two years God was expecting that they would receive the message by faith and be able to possess the land my so here they were at at Kadesh Barnea but the important thing was this right here forget about everything else that has happened sometimes we need to realize that right within the message forget about everything else that has happened forget about everything that's taken place that though a thousand fall on your right hand and 10,000 on your left it will not come nigh thee amen you will be an overcomer because there are ordained to be overcomers in this age you're still with me this this evening israel was there try this finger again there it is god was there and Joshua had a revelation joshua had a revelation if the Lord delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it us amen a land which flowth with milk and honey if the Lord delight in us now let's bring it into the third Exodus if the Lord delight in us it doesn't matter that we're living in hell if the Lord delight in us it doesn't matter that there's been a great falling away if the Lord delight in us it doesn't matter what opposition we have if the Lord delight in us he will bring us into possess the full inheritance of his word thank you i think that's the end of those slides take your Bibles and turn with me to Numbers chapter 14 if you would i want to just look at this thought of Kadesh Barnea for a little bit because if we see some of the things happening here it will help us to understand because the spirits don't die spirits don't die the devil takes his man but he leaves the spirit amen god takes his man but he leaves the Holy Spirit all right so now in Numbers chapter 14 is where we find Israel rejecting the promised land and uh I'm going to pick it up here at uh if we go from uh verse one we would read we won't read it but we would read about how that the congregation was all upset at Moses and Aaron and the leaders because they brought them to this land they said "Have you made us to die?" and they want to take a make a captain to take them back to Egypt so there was a spirit of rebellion moving amongst the people and they wanted to go back to Egypt and Joshua stands up and says to them the scripture that I read if the Lord delight in us then he will bring us into the land and give it us a land which flowth with milk and honey and verse 10 it says "But all the congregation bade stoned them with stones and the glory of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel." And the Lord said unto Moses "How long will this people provoke me and how long will it be heir they believe me for all the signs which I have shown amongst them i will smite them with the pestilence and disinherit them and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they." So now notice what God is saying here says "Moses just step out of the way here i'm going to kill everybody else and I'm going to raise up a new nation out of you." All right and Moses said to the Lord "Then the Egyptians shall hear it for thou broughtest up this people and thy might from among them and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land for they have heard that thou Lord art among this people that thou Lord art seen face to face and thy cloud standeth over them and thou goest before them by daytime in a pillar of cloud and in a pillar of fire by night now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man then the nations that have heard of the fame of thee will speak saying Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore unto them therefore he has slain them in the wilderness and now I beseech you let the power of my Lord be great according as thou hast spoken saying The Lord is long-suffering of great mercy forgiving iniquities and transgressions and by no means clearing the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation then he says "Pardon I beseech thee the iniquity of these people according unto the greatness of thy mercy and as thou has forgiven this people from Egypt even until now." And the Lord said "I have pardoned according to thy word." Now this is a powerful passage because God says "Step out of the way Moses." And Moses doesn't move he says "Lord I'm not going to let you kill them if you're going to kill him you're have to going to go you're going to have to go through me and he begins to speak back to the Lord under the uncction of the same Lord so it's God's love speaking to God's justice now which one prevailed the love was greater than the justice all right so Moses was a type of Christ and we know God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son so Jesus Christ was the love of God that was projected into the world whose blood speaks better things than that of Abel which blood cried from the ground for justice all right so Abel's blood cried unto God god came down and judged Cain jesus blood cried unto God and God forgives hallelujah and so that's why as believers we want to accept what God is has given us of the blood of Jesus Christ now Moses representing Christ here in chapter 14 there's a rejection if we would read further in the chapter you find out that the children of Israel God says to them "All right I've pardoned you but the generation that said they're not able to possess the land they're going to die in the wilderness." Now I want you to look at verse 15 or chapter 15 I mean and verse one now God has just finished saying this generation will die in the wilderness the very next statement and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when you come into the land of your habitations which I give unto you all right now here's God saying "These people will not possess the land." And the next sermon that Moses preaches under direct order of the Lord preaches about "You're going to go in and possess the land." Amen now what's taking place here that generation did perish in the wilderness so what exactly is God doing here he's beginning to direct Moses to point his message to the next generation all right so he's this generation is rejected but God doesn't stop Moses from preaching says "Moses you're still preaching the word you're still laying the word in there but these people have a stony heart these people won't be able to receive it but there's a generation coming up under them and that generation is going to receive my message that generation is going to possess the land that generation is going to believe she's the bride that generation is going to believe this message is for her amen that generation is going to accept what I sent even though the previous generation couldn't enter fully into it because they still had Egypt or Egypt flowing through their minds but there's a generation that has grown up now that says we're more than able to possess all that God has given us amen amen all right so let's look at this just a little bit further here we're going to chapter 16 now the historians say between chapter 15 and chapter 16 is actually 20 years i don't know whether it is or not but that's what the historian says there so there's a space of time here between God speaking to Israel in chapter 15 and chapter 16 where Dayan and Kora rise up we'll start at verse one now Kora the son of Ishar son of Kath the son of Levi and Dayathan and Abram the sons of Ilab and Anne and the the son of Paleth and sons of Reuben took men and they rose up before Moses with certain of the children of Israel 250 princes of the assembly famous in the congregation men of renown all right let's stop for a minute now from Egypt to Kadesh Barnea is two years from Kadesh Barnea to here they say is 20 more years so the message is 22 years old all right so now after 22 years in the message there become those that begin to rise up in the message which the Bible calls as men of renown men with names men who try to gather a following after themselves all right and who do they rise up against they rise up against Moses and so they begin to interpret the message to the people if I could say it that way and uh and they say to Moses in verse three "And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and said unto them you take too much upon yourself seeing all the congregation are holy every one of them and the Lord is among them wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the Lord?" And when Moses heard it he fell upon his face all right now maybe you put this slideshow up there called standing in the gap i just I just I was looking at these statement these statements these scriptures when I came across the statements that brother Brandham read immediately after reading the scripture in the message standing in the gap where he reads out of numbers chapter 16 and verse 3 and 4 and it begins to describe what's going on in the feelings of God and the attitude of God towards this now you can go ahead and start that and Uh brother Brandon begins to say "Yeah go ahead give me the first one." Of this time that we're speaking or reading of course we all understand that it was when Dayan and Kora had decided that they would interfere with the commission that God had given to Moses saying "You ought to let the whole congregation do such and such they're all holy." All right now what was the attitude or the statement that Brother Brandon makes he says "It isn't just that they're they're they got another idea or they have an idea but they're actually interfering with the commission of God they're interfering with what God is doing in that hour." There's a great exodus going on and they were getting in the way rather than stepping back and letting God do what God was going to do they gathered men of renown in other words there was a genuine lack of humility and they felt that they all had ability and there was maybe no arguing with their ability but their actions begin to cause interference in the plan of God for that age now the Bible we know says that no flesh will glory in his presence nobody going to rise up and say I got an idea or I got the ability we know when Moses was down in Egypt and says thought that he had the ability even when he was called to deliver the children of Israel all he could produce was one dead stinking Egyptian he had to get that ability beat out of him on the backside of the desert till he could come into contact with the presence of God in the pillar of fire in the burning bush and feel like he was not able to do it and God could tell him "You're just in condition now that you can do it." It's when you think you can't do it that finally I can use you because God's strength is made perfect in our weakness all right so Moses we find that he falls on his face give me the next one please brother says "And God commanded Moses to lead the people to the promised land." And they said "You take it upon yourself to do too much you that try to make yourself the only one in the bunch that's God." And he say so well actually Moses didn't make himself that it was God that made him that you know God sent a prophet in this hour with a message he didn't make himself that he didn't give himself a gift he didn't he didn't cause uh the attraction that gathered the people together that was so supernaturally vindicated you know sometimes uh God has a way of showing us the vindication even though we've never been there i was raised to the age of 22 years old and I had never heard the name William Brown until somebody witnessed to me about the message and then when I told my parents about it I found out that my mother was healed in brother Brandham's meetings isn't that an amazing thing but not believing the message as a matter of fact being very much against the message for various reasons I won't go into but when I was very young in the ministry I I uh was working with in business working in some consulting helping some business people and they were starting a business and they they asked me to leave the job I was working at and come and work in their business and we were sitting down at a lunch table and and uh the brother said to me or the man said to me and I could tell he was kind of a charismatic Christian and he said "We want you to come work for us when we get this business up and running and I said 'Well I already have a job and they said 'Well we want you to leave that job and come work for us and and where they were wanting to run the business was different town than I was living in and I said 'Well I live over here in this town well they said well what's wrong with this town and and I was kind of avoiding the issue and I said well I've got commitments over here in this town and and they said well what kind of commitments and so finally I thought okay here we go i said well I pastor a church over here i said "This job is just a secondary job for me but I I'm a pastor of a church." And they the fellow said to me he says "Oh what do you believe?" I thought "What am I going to tell him how far are we going to go here?" I So I started with the simple part i said "Well we we believe the Bible." And he said "Well everybody believes the Bible what specifically do you believe?" And I said well I said ' Have you ever heard of the name of William Brandham oh he says they make him God those were his exact words i said well I don't know who they are or what they do but I don't make him God i believe he was the fulfillment of Malachi 4 a prophet sent in the spirit of Elijah to turn our hearts back to the original word and I said that's I believe he fulfilled that scripture and uh he said and so we talked a little bit the other fellow was 7th Day Adventist he expressed his opinion and then the Seventh Day Adventist got up and left the table to get some more food from the buffet and the fellow that originally was talking with me and said that they make him God he said to me surprisingly said "I was in brother Brandham's meetings." I was shocked and I thought "Well I wonder what he saw." And he I didn't ask him but he just began to volunteer god has a way of doing things he says "I was in his meetings in Saskatchewan." He says "And when he stepped up to the pulpit," he said "It was like a wave of the Holy Spirit went out over the congregation." He says "People got up off their CS got out of their wheelchairs threw down their crutches." He said "And he hadn't even begin to speak yet." That was the vindication of God that walked with this generation the first generation ran into another fellow one time and he said he was in brother Brandham's meetings in a place called Grand Prairie which is where I was pastoring and uh he was an older fellow and uh we had done some advertising to to try and uh find out if there's any of the people left that were in the meetings that Brother Brandon was there and we offered free books and he replied and got some free books and we got in contact with him and wasn't a believer wasn't even baptized correctly never could get even get him to see true water baptism but unsolicited this was his testimony he says I was in William Brandham's meetings I think it was 1951 or 53 in Grand Prairie Alberta and it's not recorded but there is there is actually uh advert adverisements that we've seen of the meetings in the local newspaper and uh he said I was suffering from heart trouble he says and William Brandham at the end of the service he says he called me out he says I was kind of scared but he says I looked up he says and when I looked up I saw the pillar of fire over his head you see God has a way of telling you these things are the truth when other people want to say they never happened but God raises up witnesses that are not even followers of this message to bear witness what God did in our day this message is supernaturally vindicated god had commanded Moses to lead the people to the promised land god commanded brother Brandham to do what he did amen let's go to the next one but he says "And this displeased God so much until he told Moses "Separate yourself from among them i'll just kill the whole bunch and start a new generation with you." See Moses I want you to catch this now moses was the love of God that was present and manifested here on the earth but the wrath of God was right there it so displeased God you know that God it's not just words that displease God we can make mistakes we can say things wrong but it was the attitude behind it you know God hates even the Bible talks about seven things that God hates that are abominations like a proud look a lying tongue heart that devises wicked imaginations a false witness that speaketh lie he that sweth discord amongst the brethren those are things that God hates it's not error alone that God hated it's the spirit behind the error we were all in error one day but God came by our way our God who is rich in mercy and and you could argue even looking back here and say you know there were innocent people that were caught up in it but God wasn't judging their actions he was judging the spirit that was behind it which spirit was already judged and reserved in chains of darkness and was trying to manifest itself on the earth amongst the believers all right now standing in the gap he goes on he says "Now today if God was going to liquidate the people he says brings it to today and there was a time when God had gotten tired of fooling with our sin we constantly going wrong who would stand like Moses today for the people where would we find a person that would stand or could stand that God would accept like he did Moses?" All right so if God would accept Moses what if Moses wasn't there if God would accept Brother Bram what if Brother Brandham isn't here where do we stand where is a person where is a people that's willing to stand in the gap give me the next one please moses own life on earth meant so much to God till it stayed the wrath of God and watch this next statement and God would not cross over Moses i want you to catch how God operates here because there was a time when God was angry with Israel but yet being angry with Israel in I think it's 1 Samuel or 2 Samuel chapter 24 God could not cross over David and so he inspired David or allowed the devil to inspire David to make a mistake and go and number the people if you actually read the scripture it wasn't David that God was angry with that caused the plague it was the children of Israel that God was angry with but he allowed the devil to trick David into going and numbering the people and thereby God could cross over David and bring a plague into Israel so you see there was a man in that day that God would not cross over but God would allow him to make a mistake to loose the wrath of God amongst the people all right I'm getting to a point here next one please there was all this always was a puzzle to me till one day in the revelation of the scripture there came this thought to me see Moses in act in every was every way substituting he was a type of Jesus Christ thank you see there there's no Moses attitude was not that he was elite but what that God was elite all right I know you're listening closely here there was a people that needed redemption just like he needed redemption moses knew his place now a as we read and I want you to take your Bibles still if you have them open in Numbers chapter 16 here now what happens in verse we could go to verse uh 20 and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron saying "Separate yourselves from amongst his congregation that I may consume them in a moment." And they fell upon their faces and said "Oh God the God of spirits of all flesh shall one man sin and thou be wroth with all the congregation." And the Lord spake unto Moses saying "Speak unto the congregation get yourself up from the tabernacle of Kora Dayan and Abram." Now God is going to judge the leaders that led the rebellion and the earth opens up we know and the swallows them up so the leaders now of the rebellion become swallowed up but that's not the end of it i want you to jump down with me to verse 41 but on the tomorrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron saying "You have killed the people of the Lord." Oh my so God dealt with Dayan and Kora now the the people seeing the supernatural who did they blame it on moses and Aaron and they say it's your fault that Dayan and Corin Byram died so that now the spirit that was on the leaders never left but now begin to move into the people and begin to say oh you know it's Moses and Ara you know what a terrible age to be living in but what a tremendous age to be living in you know in the beginning as the rebellion rose up I can well imagine that there were some people that were saying what got into Dayan and Cora how could they do this how could they rebel against Moses they they it's a terrible thing they've done and there are other people that were saying "What got into Moses and what got into Aaron?" They used to be good leaders now they've fallen and and you know they've fallen from God's grace they had never fallen but the people's attitude become twisted by a demonic spirit all right and so now God says in in verse 42 he says "And it came to pass when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron that they looked towards the tabernacle of the congregation and behold the cloud covered it and the glory of the Lord appeared." And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation and the Lord spake unto Moses "Get you up from among the congregation that I may consume them as in a moment." And they fell on their faces now watch what happens now and Moses said unto Aaron "Take a sensor put fire therein from off the altar," what the altar of incense and put on incense and go quickly unto the congregation and make an atonement for them for there is wrath gone out from the Lord the plague has begun all right now what's taking place here why couldn't Moses stand in the gap anymore moses couldn't stop the plague now the people had rebelled and God says "Step aside i'm going to consume all the people." But Moses says "There's still a man that can stand in the gap there's somebody that can take the sensor of prayer and can stand between God and his wrath." Who was this man was a man that had been positionally placed in the priesthood all right now I'm not reflecting that to five-fold ministry but I'm actually reflecting it to the bride of Jesus Christ because we have come to placing time we have come to an hour where God wants his people to take their position for they and they only have the ability to stand between the wrath of God and their loved ones amen so there was a plague that had already started but Moses said to Aaron "You've got the position to stand in the gap you have to do it you've got to take the sensor you've got to run with the sensor you've got to bring the incense you've got to offer up the prayers you got to get into position you got to take your place in the body of Jesus Christ you got to recognize who you are run and stand before the plague strikes your loved ones for it's already started i can say in this hour we can see it even within the ranks of the message it's already started but let there be a people raise up with prayer raise up with position raise up with revelation and understand their position in the body of Jesus Christ hallelujah there was a woman by the name of Esther my youngest daughter's name is Esther and death was be was about to ride out through the land the decree had been made all the Jews would be killed hmon had convinced the king to make the decree and h had deceived him into doing it and now now there was going to be all the Jews were slaughtered and Morai said took his his niece Esther sent a message to Esther and says "You must go into the king and you must convince him to reverse the decree you are the only one that stands between us and death you are the bride of the king and if you don't take your position don't think you're going to escape but rather God will raise somebody else up in your place to take that position because it is a position that must be filled and Esther sent back the message to the you can read the book of Esther when you go home or when you go back to your rooms and Esther sends back the message to Mori and says "But the law says that it that nobody can go into the presence of the king unless they're invited and if they go in not being invited they'll they're they'll be killed unless the king holds out the scepter." All right so now the scepter representing of course the righteousness of the king and and uh Esther but she said but you fast and pray for three days and get all the people to fast and pray for three days and I'll fast and pray for three days with my maids and then I will go in and then she says if I perish I perish you see no greater love has a man than this that he lay down his life for his friends and so here's Esther coming not yet realizing her position and this is what I I'm getting to tonight is that not fully realizing her position but realizing she's the one that's got to do something and so she goes into the king and the king holds out his scepter and and and uh and then she touches the end of a scepter is receiving his mercies and and so he he had called out who was in the court and everybody had tried to convince Esther don't go in there but she knew she had to do it she didn't know why she didn't know her position and and so she goes into the presence of the king and the king accepts it now I want you to catch this very closely the details of the conversation are not recorded in the Bible but they're actually recorded in the book of Josephus and so how that Josephus describes the meeting there between the king and Esther and he says the king said to Esther because he saw that she looked fearful and weak because she had been fasting remember for three days and she was scared for her life and he says why do you look so fearful and she said "Because the law says that nobody can come into the presence of the king unless they're invited." And the king's reply is that law applies to everybody except you now just a minute here that's God's word it's hidden in the scriptures it's hidden between the lines but it's a love letter to us that God is trying to convey something to his bride you don't have to wait to be invited to come into the king whatever the request is you can come into the presence of the king anytime you desire amen i no longer call you church i call you bride see there was three different types of women in in in that are mentioned in the book of Esther there's virgins concubines and the bride all right the virgins are the ones that have never had an experience with the king they've never come into the presence of the king they're being washed with with with uh uh perfumes and odors and and baths and uh cleanse you know that's the way it is when you're dealing with sinners you're trying to wash them in the water of the word you're trying to get them cleansed you're trying to accept the righteousness of Jesus Christ get them to receive what God's done for them and and they got to go through a sanctification process that's the virgins but once they come into the presence of the king then they have an experience with the king but if they're not the bride they go to the house of the concubines and in the house of the concubines is all the women that have been in the presence of the king but are not the bride all right now we can certainly type that in this hour and realize there's a lot of people that have had experience with God but they never say receive the love letter from the king that says "You're my bride." God sent his message just exactly for his bride not for the world only his bride can receive that amen but now what would it be sister if you got a love letter from your husband how many wives have we got in this place all right now what would it be if your husband was away and he sent you a love letter and you took that love letter and put it on the shelf i wonder if he loves me i I I wonder what he thinks about me i I know he's a far away right now but I wonder if he's thinking of me well he sent you a letter it's called the message of the hour amen he's in that letter he's telling you he loves you in that letter he's telling you how much you mean to him in that letter he's telling you he can't live without you in that letter and so the king there's the king with Esther now she comes into the presence of the king now she hadn't come in for 30 days because she had not been invited now now I hope you can catch this without me going into detail here but I want you to realize the concubines had to be invited but the queen did not have to be invited all right so now I want you to catch this now what she's actually doing is thinking of herself as a concubine instead of thinking of herself as the queen that she is that the beloved of her beloved yeah and so as a result she's not taking her position the way she ought to take her position she's fearful she's scared there's death in the land and she's the only one that can stop it hallelujah oh let me just bring it right down home there's death that wants to strike our families but you're called to stop it there's death that's that's trying to strike it might be a sickness it might be unbelief it might be all kinds of things happening broken relationships whatever more but God has equipped you as the bride of Jesus Christ to come into his presence at any time and say "Lord I have need of your grace." Lord I have need of your hand in in this hour hallelujah oh how how the king loved her she says uh he says "Well what's your request?" She says "Come to my house for a feast i invite you for a feast of wine." That's what we're doing tonight we're having a feast of wine what's wine stimulation of revelation praise the Lord lord come into our feast of wine tonight lord come down and make yourself known amongst us lord reveal yourself in our midst and so he comes down and he comes to King of Hazarus comes to Esther's house and Hmon is there and and you know anywhere there's church the devil goes to and so there you know there he's he's visiting her and he finally says okay Esther this isn't all for no reason what's your request oh and she gets up all of her boldness she says my request is that you come again tomorrow night praise the Lord Hallelujah You know sometimes we're fearful to ask but Lord I just want to be in your presence lord I just want to be near you lord I just want to feel how much you love me and you know there she invited him oh I I love the story it's so It so matches Ruth you know what i can't You can't preach about God without preaching about love my Bible says "God is love." All right so now now here's here's Esther and she's she's uh moved to invite him the next night now what happens to the king all right now now think about this the king has just been with Esther and he's going to be with Esther tomorrow night and that night as he goes home from the feast the Bible says he can't sleep i wonder why come on brothers he's thinking about Esther he can't sleep i wonder what her request is tomorrow i wonder I wonder how it's going to go tomorrow his mind is on his bride you say "Oh is that so brother?" Go to the book of Ruth you know there she is she lays down at his feet and she says "You're a near kinsman." And he says "There's one nearer than I." She says "Yes but you're a near kinsman." And and she he gives her six measures of barley she goes home naomi says "Where'd you get those six measures of barley?" I got them from Boaz oh he says "Sit down and rest." Cuz he won't rest until he finishes the work of redemption hallelujah god is not resting in this hour he's up and active cuz he's got a bride that's on his mind he's been waiting thousands of years for this time hallelujah amen brothers how many brothers ever traveled away from your wife all right first day you leave goodbye honey you know it's all nice and and you you just go on your way and maybe for work or whatever more it might be and you know you're around her so much but now you're away a little bit maybe it's a little bit novel you know and you you get a chance to read more than you used to read you're by yourself more the kids aren't going to bother you you know everything's all left behind and you're kind of off on your own next day goes by and you know it's kind of yeah this is all right third day goes by fourth I don't know how long it lasts everybody's different fifth day goes by sixth day goes by pretty soon it gets pretty tired and then it's like man I wish I was home man I can't wait to get back home i I was I was at the end of two weeks of long meetings brother Ben I was over in Africa and and uh it was before the time of cell phones and I was off in Africa and uh uh I had I preached about I don't know 14 15 times i don't remember what it was and it was I was at just about the last meeting and I was kind of feeling sorry for myself as preachers are apt to do about every time they preach and uh and so it was after another service and uh so I think I had one service left and I was kind of feeling bad about myself and all of that and I I was just crying out to the Lord Lord I'm sorry i just I'm sorry for feeling bad i I just miss my wife and I miss the family and you know I sure wish I my wife was here and you know it'd be so much easier if she was here and I was just kind of whining and complaining before the Lord i don't think that's scriptural and the Lord spoke to my heart because I said you know I've been waiting two weeks to see my wife they spoke to my heart says but I've been waiting 6,000 years i thought "Oh God forgive me here I am can't hardly stand two weeks and the Lord's been thinking about you for 6,000 years amen lord's been thinking about this age for 6,000 years there'll come an age that it won't be going to the marriage it will be marriage time it will be bride time hallelujah just like Esther and Ahazarus ahazarus realized uh you know that that was the most the greatest thing that was on his mind i couldn't help but think what a Hazarus was thinking for 30 days while she was thinking she had to wait to be invited i didn't know I was going to speak about marriage tonight but you ever get that way brothers and sisters where you feel like I'm waiting for him to make a move but I'm waiting for her to make a move but I'm waiting for him to make a move 30 days goes by nobody's made a move i'm not talking about you know the natural way of life i'm just talking about moving in affection towards one another you know brother Brandham said that that our marriage and the scripture says our marriage is a type of the heavenly the invisible union between the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride you know I'll I'll say it this way and I hope it doesn't apply to anybody here but if it does you you take it as an encouragement for you that I believe if our earthly marriages are not fulfilling then I sincerely doubt that the invisible union is really fulfilling like it ought to be if what we have between us and God is not reflected between us and our wife then we've missed something somewhere all right got a little quiet on that one i think I'll face this direction praise the Lord talk to the screen esther said "If I perish I perish." See death was moving through the land and Esther had to take her position death was in the ranks of Naomi and Ruth but Ruth had to take her position death was in Israel but Aaron had to take his position death is riding through the land now but the bride must take her position the word is life and anything that is against the revelation of God's word is death it's not just false doctrine but that which seeks to undermine the channel of God's revelation are you still with me oh my we got to bring this to a close i'm sorry i didn't realize it was so late praise the Lord we got lots of meetings so we'll we'll try and I I found a way in now I got to find a way out all right you know there are so many things that to to come against God but there's only one people that can stand for God we've come to the bride age we've come to the time you see God's a bride age is not just a title to describe an era no it's a description of a relationship that God has moved into with his church this is now bride time this is now maturity time this is now the time of the greatest joy that there ever was but death is riding through the land if there ever was a time to be heavenly minded it's this age because the eagle rises above the things of this age the rat race that we call the world conspires to keep us bound in this world to keep us tied down like it tried to keep Esther tied down like it tried to keep Aaron tied down all of that you've got to take your position that let me just say this now there are many things that we could call hell on earth let give me just a few minutes to talk about this and then we'll close all right i'm here and I'm not going to deal with this again in another service is this all right the Bible says about an adulterous woman her house is the way to hell going down to the chambers of death there's never been an age Brother says one of the great plagues of the last days would be the immorality of women i'm sure that doesn't surprise you everywhere you see it you don't have to go uh you don't have to go anywhere really wherever you look praise the Lord not in this room but wherever you look whether it be walking down the street whether it be uh going to work amen brothers wherever it might be you know you've got to guard yourself against the immorality because it's death that's presenting itself in the way of an adulterous woman all right he says "But he knoweth," talking about a man that going into her says "He knoweth that the dead are there and that her guests are in the depths of hell." You see it's not we could talk about pornography and as soon as I say that every brother in this place knows exactly what I'm talking about but it's not pornography it's lust the Bible doesn't name pornography it names lust all right and is it an addiction they they have a term now called sex addition addiction sex addiction i can't even say it right and and so they've got this term to describe it it is an addiction because anything that is a demon possession is an addiction cigarettes is an addiction because it's a demon amen drugs is an addiction because it's a demon lust can be an addiction because it's a demon and I'm not talking about normal relations between a man and a woman but we've reached an age where the un where people have an unsatiable sexual appetite and now I said that to say this brothers it's hell on earth it's not something to be desired young men run away from it flee youthful lust the scripture says it's not some oh it's enticing to the eyes yeah sure it is but you're looking into the pit of hell brother Brandham said Hollywood is the pit of hell and Hollywood presents itself as something attractive or this exciting movie or that great thing that's happening or whatever more but you're actually peering into the pit of hell and the devil's desiring to grab a hold of you and pull you into there amen we know first Peter chapter 3 speaks about Christ suffering and going to pre and preaching to spirits in prison which sometimes were disobedient when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was preparing you know we often think about this age has gone on a long time but Noah worked on the ark for 120 years preaching the same message preacher of righteousness there's only one way there's only one message you get into the ark or you're lost you get into Jesus Christ or you're lost jesus Christ is always the word revealed for his day and you get into the word revealed for your day or it's lost oh brother Tim I heard that before if you'd have been in Moses in Noah's day you'd have heard it for 120 years oh I heard him preach before oh there he goes again going off on that ark as being as though he's the only one that hears from God that's right he was the only one that heard from God he was the only one that had the message of escape and God has sent a message of escape in this hour because hell is upon the earth and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man brother Brandham talks about his own self and the things that he saw on the earth when or things that he saw as he descended into hell as as a child just 14 years old as he was dying his blood was pumping out of his body and his life was escaping from his body and he went down into hell he says I heard things and I saw things that were so hideous he says it would make a burning hell a pleasure compared to that whatever you do he says don't go there now let me let me just I'm saying it this way for a reason because he in 19 I think it is 63 or 64 he says I was sitting in JC Penney he says "And all of a sudden my mind goes back to when I was 14 years old and saw those things in hell and recognized they're now on the earth they're now right around it's no wonder people are taking anxiety medication it's no wonder their minds are going crazy because the whole age is descending into hell but I'll go back to my original thought though he cast me into hell I will still love him." Amen hell or the regions of the lost is a place where people are locked away from the presence of God brother Aram said there was no mother there no father there no God there now listen that doesn't mean there aren't mothers that go there or fathers that go there he's saying there's no relationship there there's no love there there's no connection there nobody means anything to anybody else that's why the woman that wouldn't repent in church when God dealt with her used those words she says "I could see my mother's soul fry in hell and laugh at it." Why because when you go into that region there's no mother there's no father there's nobody that means anything to you you're just entirely separated from God but let me tell you here tonight if you've got just a twinge of a twinge that says "I want God," it's because God is dealing with you amen amen the Holy Spirit is moving upon your life desiring you to do what brother Tim what do I got to do just surrender yourself just yield yourself to God and say "God I hear you calling me Lord forgive me of my sins lord I want to give my life to you i want to surrender it to you Lord i don't want to go the way of hell i don't want to be swallowed up in this regions of the lost that is all around us i don't want to be swallowed up in this video stuff anymore these video gangs and this internet and these computer things that held me captive i want to be set free tonight amen he's a deliverer tonight he was a deliverer in Noah's day he sent a message to deliver the people he was the one that Abraham followed when he came down and destroyed Moses or destroyed Sodom rather and he delivered Lot and his family out of the city of Sodom but his wife was too much in bondage she He said "Don't look at those things don't look back." But she had to look back to what her former desires were and she turned to a pillar of salt she was eternally lost why but God sent a deliverer to deliver her with a message get out of this city he was the one that spoke to Moses to deliver the children of Israel out of Egypt he's the one that was in the camp in the wilderness that the children of Israel were led by he's the one that was with David he's the one that took away all sin from them that believed he is our righteousness he is our peace he is our joy he is our salvation he is our everything he's our mother he's our father he's our sister he's our brother he's a love that is greater than any power the world knows he's a peace that passes all understanding he's the one that comes into the one that is welcoming him because he stands at the door and knock and if anyone will open to me I will come in and s with him i will make myself known to him oh somebody said "Well I don't understand God i don't understand the message i don't know how it fits together Brother Tim." That doesn't mean anything he's the one that's here tonight that's able to open our understanding to someone that'll say "Lord open my understanding tonight lord let me see things the way you see things i'm here at the camp." You know you might be a young person that was forced to be here because your family's here maybe you're distracted on a lot of other things but God knew you would be here he came by your way this weekend said "I want to meet with you cuz I've got something for you and I'll give you something that's more satisfying than anything that's out there in the world." Amen you see it's not a matter of I got to get rid of this i got to get rid of this no you just get Christ say "Oh brother Tim how I can't give this up." No don't worry about giving that out just receive Christ as Christ comes in the world goes out you got some more of the world you get more of Christ and more of the world leaves get more of Christ more of the world leaves amen listen when I first came into the message of the hour I just begin to feed upon the word and feed upon the word and feed upon the word and as I begin to feed upon the word after a few months all of a sudden I look back and go "Where'd all the things of the world go?" What happened to the music I I I used to listen to what happened to the unclean things I used to look at what happened to to the problems that I had in my life my all of a sudden they weren't there anymore why because Christ had come in and when Christ comes in the world goes out amen i I got a law that I call the law of worldliness listen you can't the the Bible says that the world is enmity to God all right you can't love the things of the world and love God too all right so you got God at one end of the spectrum and you got the world at the other end of the spectrum and it's just a law the closer you get to God the further away you get from the world but it's also a law the closer you get to the world the further away you get from God that's right make sure we we tune up our lives tonight and be headed in the right direction lord I'm here to get closer to you there's an anointing in this hour that is sent to combat death in hell amen there was a spirit that wrote the word hallelujah i never thought about it till just studying this afternoon it was a prophecy about Jesus Christ but a lot of prophecies have a double meaning and I think this prophecy has a meaning for us as well and the prophecy is for thou will not leave my soul in hell thou will not suffer thy holy one to see corruption for this corruption must put on incorruption this mortal must put on immortality oh Lord you won't leave my soul in hell there's coming a body change there's coming a reality of the word that's in me one day when the last member comes in and the bride recognizes who she is there's going to be a quickening take place in my life and all that I believe will come a living reality and all of a sudden this old body will be turned young again hallelujah it's not that I'm worried about getting old listen saints if I died tomorrow I'd be the happiest man that's right listen to live is Christ to die is gain don't feel sorry for me if I cross over on the other side i feel sorry for yourselves well you might not feel sorry for yourselves but you know but nevertheless in all of that you know I'm not worried about crossing over on the other side that's where I want to go that's where I want to be that's what I want to partake of that's what my thoughts are i was traveling with a young man to some men's meeting he asked me he said "Brother Tim the body change must mean more to you than it does to me [Laughter] praise the Lord brother you're about to get an education i said "Buddy let me tell you something it's not that I'm sick or tired or old but the reason I'm looking forward to a body change is because I've experienced a lot of things in my life and I know that is does not fully satisfy the deep calling in here when I was young I just wanted to get my driver's license i thought if I just get my driver's license that'll satisfy me come to find out it didn't satisfy me i just wanted to get graduated and get a job and make some money and I got graduated and I got a job and I made some money and I found out that didn't satisfy me i thought you know maybe I'll just find the right woman and I found the wonder most wonderful woman and and and there uh I was united to her in holy matrimony and we had a wonderful relationship for 30 years until the Lord took her home but yet in the midst of all that I'll say that wasn't a full satisfaction of the deep calling that laid within many times as sisters you say "If I could just get married and have some children and have a family and a home and a car and whatever more like that," and pretty soon the sisters that are amongst us that got married and had children and raising children and have a home and have a car and all that goes with that you pretty real pretty soon realize that didn't really answer everything within us why because we're the seed gene attributes of God we were predestinated to be in the image of God and there's a tabernacle called this corruptible body that's stopping us from being everything that we are meant to be but one moment in a twinkling of an eye one of these days that's all going to change hallelujah then the eternities are going to break open and we're going to be able to trans transfere the the different spheres and transverse them and all travel throughout this realm and another realm and on into heaven and back into this realm and all those kind of things that we're going to be able to be like we were meant to be amen why because this mortal must put on immortality thou will not need my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption hallelujah david says "I will praise thee oh Lord my God with all my heart i will glorify thy name forever more for great is thy mercy toward me and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell." Hallelujah hallelujah don't you think the woman at the well was living in a hell on earth her life was hell all right let's just be sober for a moment and come to a close a lot of times we go through events in our life and it seems like we are in hell on earth seems like there's no way out the circumstances have encompassed us and we just have to endure but God never puts us through anything that doesn't have a purpose and I can say that tonight and maybe if the Lord wills in the days ahead I'll share a thing or two that you know everything is for a purpose and God chastises with a loving hand all right but here was this woman that was living with a sixth man as Jesus said you've had five husbands and the one you're living with now is not your husband brother that's hell on earth some women have one husband and it's hell on earth i'm not talking about any sisters here but I'm talking about you know here this woman went from one to the other to the other to the other to the other what was she looking for just a little heaven on earth just a relationship that worked somebody that loved her somebody that cared for her that's all she wanted but but her lot seemed to be just hell on earth to top that off the denominations looked down at her and then and said "You know there's no hope for you there's nothing we can do for you you you've done messed up your life so bad that you're I'll I'll share some testimonies maybe tomorrow uh from the message of the hour but you you've messed up your life so bad there there's nothing we can do for you don't even come to church like like you you've so far gone really we haven't got nothing for you." And so along comes a man along comes the love of God expressed on the earth is there a man that can stand in the gap for this woman oh there's a man that can tell this woman listen there's you she said you know we know when the Messiah comes we know there's coming a message we know there's coming a last days we know there's coming a listen i I I the hour cometh and now is that they that worship the father must worship him in spirit and in truth she she says "I perceive you're a prophet." And you know I've got it all backwards and mixed up I realize but he he says he says she says "I perceive you're a prophet." We know when the Messiah comes he'll be a prophet and he says "I am he that speaks to you." Amen now what happened here's a woman that everybody had written off and said there's no hope for her and all of a sudden the Bible says she dropped her water pot hallelujah she says "I don't need this old life anymore." This kind of things don't bother me no more this this labor of life doesn't bother me anymore she ran into the city and got the attention of the entire city and said "Come see a man who told me all things is not this the very Messiah?" I could say "Is not this the message of the hour is not this the me the messenger that was sent to forrun the second coming of Christ is not he the one that was sent to bring God's grace to this generation and show them it doesn't matter how far gone the world thinks you are if my word comes by your way that's all you have need of." Hallelujah that's everything we have need of tonight he's the deliverer that's on the scene tonight brother Brandham talked about his own prison and he said "Oh he said he talked about losing his wife and losing his daughter." And he says "Oh dear God I'm sorry that I did what I did you took my wife my darling from me now you're taking my baby oh God please don't take my little girl i love her with all my heart i'll serve you i've done all I know to do except go when you told me to go down there i said "Please don't take my baby." I said "I love her take me instead of her," he says then he says "Oh God I don't know why you're tearing me up like this." Said "Lord I I I don't I don't know i've done all that I can do it's not my will now let thy will be done and he says I laid my hand on her head he says the angels of God come picked her up carried her away he says God let me go with them then don't let me stay here any longer i don't want to stay listen what he says now but God in my heart there's something that I love you no matter what you've done I love you they said I lifted my hands to him how is it that a man could come to such a level of surrender of love to the Lord Jesus Christ job said "Though he slay me yet I will trust him." Amen but I will maintain my own ways before him brother Adam Ram said "If he should cast me into hell I will still love him." Finally in the message Hidden Life he says "Have you come into the place?" He says "Have you ever come to the place in your life where Christ meant more to you than all the arguing you could do about your church has Christ meant more to you than all the world why don't you just bow your heads while I read this i want you to listen to it and I want you to think of yourself as the musicians come he says "I don't mean from an emotion or a mental workup i mean from the depths of your heart that something's settled in there that something's taken place and you don't know how it come but you're hid away and your whole motive is to serve Jesus Christ have you entered into that place my dear brother have you come into that place where you don't care what anyone says not to go out and act smart but till the love of God is so anchored in you that you can't see nothing else your whole motive is to do the will of God love for everybody flowing free from everywhere he says "What a place to live." That's the hidden place that's the place where we got to come to my brethren that's the place where God reveals his secret things that's the place where God does the placing and the calling as our heads are bowed you know that chorus there is none like you no one else can touch my heart like you do you just play that softly for me while our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed I preached longer than I expected to tonight it's the first service we're tired we're weary but let's not end the service and just go out of here and just say "Well that was a nice thought that was a nice scripture some nice quotes put together." Let's approach it right now and say "Lord where do I stand?" Have we come to that secret place that hidden place to where it doesn't matter what anybody says we'll love him anyway doesn't matter what happens in our life we love God anyhow it doesn't matter what trial we are in the midst of we can still say Lord not my will but thy will be done maybe you're here tonight and you want to say "Lord in your presence tonight as I feel your presence so near I just want to surrender myself aresh to you Lord." Maybe you'd like to surrender yourself for the first time before God and we don't really have a lot of altar space or anything but why don't you just do it in your seat why don't you just stand to your feet and say "Lord I'm standing in a surrender tonight i'm standing with my arms raised i want you to come Lord Jesus and come and take complete control of my life and let your word have the preeminence in my life this weekend as we're gathered around your word and we're with saints of like precious faith lord I want you to have the preeminence for Lord I want to confess tonight that nobody can touch my heart like you do Lord there's nobody like you oh God as people are standing all over the place I want to say to you my sinner friend if you're here tonight confessing Christ desiring Christ for the first time don't look for an emotion look for a decision say "Oh God I am making a conscious decision tonight i'm giving my life unreservedly to you." And the God who sees your heart will come down and accept your sacrifice heavenly Father Lord you see every hand that is raised in you lord you see every life that is represented oh God Lord you're
