[39:39] sins Lord you became us that we might
[39:42] become like you Lord Jesus you left all
[39:45] your glory Lord and you you died the
[39:48] most cruelest death that there was not

[39:56] only way for us Lord Jesus and we
[39:59] what we want to give you praise and
[40:01] glory for that Lord we just thank you

[40:09] the year Lord Jesus because we were
[40:11] always grateful of what you've done for
[40:12] us Lord but and this time when we
[40:14] recognized Lord that there was a time
[40:17] when you died it was a time and in
[40:21] relation to our time of here on earth
[40:23] thought there was a time when you died
[40:25] Lord and then there was a time when you
[40:27] rose again Lord Jesus and today Lord is
[40:30] the resurrection day Lord when different
[40:33] ones went to find you in the tomb Lord
[40:35] and they got a report saying he's not

[41:38] everyone doing this morning good feels
[41:40] like a nice um like a little family
[41:43] environment this morning nice and like
[41:44] we can all be quite a place you know you
[41:47] can sort of move up to the front and
[41:48] maybe you can sit in the seat there you
[41:51] wouldn't otherwise get to sit in think
[41:53] about that you know when you when when
[41:57] there's just a regular church so ever
[41:59] seen the regular people come they kind
[42:01] of have beer you know that's their spot
[42:03] it's not really bare spot but they
[42:04] always go and sit in that spot so you
[42:06] can't really take that spot maybe when a
[42:09] visitor comes they don't know who's the
[42:11] spot is and they go a certain someone
[42:12] else's spot and then the other person
[42:13] thinks oh there's someone in my spot but
[42:15] it's not really this one but you're at
[42:17] Liberty today to take the spot you've
[42:19] always wanted to take but someone else
[42:22] is being here apart from like the
[42:23] regulars like you know this seat here is
[42:25] taken but I saw you there before in the
[42:29] front was that you Shannon with you I'm
[42:31] not a narc I must okay prays a little
[42:34] bit um it doesn't really matter about
[42:38] these things really does that that's
[42:39] just a human that's a human thing that
[42:41] we do humans operate a certain way and
[42:42] they kind of we're creatures of habit
[42:44] you know we just have actually do things
[42:46] a certain way I always try and change it
[42:49] like I'm a regular at the subway and um
[42:51] Rima Tucker and I always go there and
[42:54] get like a coffee in a subway and after
[42:56] about a month of getting the same thing
[42:58] like every second morning they they they
[43:01] they say to me their usual and I'm like
[43:03] that now that let's change it and then
[43:06] you know I'll mix it up just to advise
[43:08] you feel like you're stuck in a rut you
[43:09] know if you you reckon if you're doing
[43:11] if you're just doing the same thing you
[43:13] feel like you feel like you're getting
[43:14] old and like you know this but we're not
[43:20] getting old we're actually getting
[43:22] younger our spirits are getting younger
[43:23] you know the more we receive Christ into
[43:25] our life the more younger our spirit
[43:27] becomes we don't Christians don't get
[43:30] old their body just as telling you lies
[43:31] because it's not getting old their
[43:34] spirits wherever I have them are freshly
[43:35] like a five year old they've got the
[43:37] enthusiasm towards life of a five year
[43:39] old I love little children they're so
[43:42] positive towards life you know they're
[43:43] so excited about things you know you you
[43:46] say we're going to go to the park and
[43:47] yes if you had a cent you know we we
[43:51] don't get as excited when we get older
[43:52] but unless we're a Christian we do we
[43:54] get excited about waking up and doing
[43:56] life amen praise the Lord okay I've got
[44:00] a I've got a funny thought here this
[44:03] morning it's not so much of an Easter
[44:05] message because last week brother Ben
[44:07] said he'll preach the eastern message
[44:08] okay so he took Easter last week so okay
[44:12] so this week the you know my story I'm
[44:16] just like the spare tire sort of
[44:17] ministry when brothers go they they get
[44:20] the answer you know that after the new
[44:22] modern cars have those little biscuit
[44:24] tires on them the small ones that are
[44:25] not really designed as a spare tire and
[44:27] they're designed to you put the thing on
[44:29] and you drive 40 kilometres from there
[44:31] to the nearest station to get a change
[44:35] you know that's the not like the old
[44:37] days the spare tire was as good as the
[44:38] new tire you know you could it didn't
[44:40] matter if you had the spear or the new
[44:41] tire on it was all the same you could
[44:42] you know go for it but so I'm one of
[44:44] those little spare tires
[44:45] but the thought that I've had this
[44:47] morning as a thought called horses s I
[44:51] just get this little seems to do it that
[44:53] way I had this funny of this thought of
[44:55] horses so I've just been looking into
[44:57] the subject of horses has been okay it's
[45:03] been add quite an interesting little
[45:06] subject for me to look into and I think
[45:08] I always get more out of the subject
[45:10] then maybe you guys do because I
[45:12] research it look into it and I get a lot
[45:14] out and I hope that you'll be blessed in
[45:17] a way from this okay we're going here
[45:21] David we
[45:28] got one last little technical hurdle to
[45:30] get over and then we've had a successful
[45:32] run is that I'm
[45:39] see if this guy
[45:43] you see if these are the batteries man I
[45:44] think these um
[45:47] they are triple A's
[45:52] who's had a good week had a good week
[45:55] praise the Lord
[46:02] we're gonna we'll stand up this morning
[46:04] we'll just read the verse bring the next
[46:05] one up Dave well they're getting that
[46:06] ready
[46:07] okay the scripture I've got which is not
[46:10] overly related to the topic and yet it's
[46:12] just one about horses that I I like and
[46:15] it's probably to me the scripture is a
[46:17] very balancing scripture in my own life
[46:19] if you're dealing in natural and
[46:20] spiritual things I like this scripture
[46:23] here and it's proverbs 21 verse 31 and
[46:29] it says the horse is prepared against
[46:31] the day of battle but safety is of the
[46:32] Lord you know like this in our in our
[46:35] natural life there's certain things that
[46:37] we have to you know we do and we think
[46:39] we arrange things and that but you know
[46:41] we've got to make sure we keep in
[46:42] context all the time that that it
[46:46] doesn't matter what we can do or how
[46:48] well we think we've got things arranged
[46:49] and everything's going to work out all
[46:50] right
[46:51] it's not really the case we prepare
[46:54] these things in our life we get things
[46:55] ready and we think we've got things
[46:56] organized but you know safety is of the
[46:58] Lord if we think our we've prepared all
[47:00] this therefore everything's going to be
[47:01] all right
[47:02] that's wrong we prepare these things but
[47:06] safety is of the Lord the overall
[47:07] victory is because of the Lord not
[47:09] because of anything not because we've
[47:10] prepared everything to go well
[47:18] okay let's try that one again
[47:21] okay we might have
[47:26] right it's all you Dave
[47:29] okay let's just pray this morning once
[47:32] more Lord we just thank you for your
[47:33] word Lord and we just thank you Lord we
[47:36] thank you for how you pre-ordained all
[47:38] things Lord Jesus before the foundation
[47:40] of the world Lord and we just commit
[47:42] this thought to you we've come at your
[47:43] word Lord to you and we just pray you
[47:46] take full control of the service in
[47:47] Jesus name Amen Rob this you can take
[47:50] your seats again this morning when I do
[47:53] that you go yeah okay stay on here
[47:55] so now horses who likes horses amazing
[48:01] creatures they're horses they're such
[48:03] great graceful animals and I thought
[48:06] I'll get some pictures of horses up here
[48:07] and I could probably look at pictures of
[48:10] horses all day they're just so nice to
[48:12] look at like they're so well designed
[48:14] the Lord's design this amazing creature
[48:17] it looks like it just looks beautiful
[48:21] these ones here running horses they just
[48:24] have some sort of like a graceful
[48:26] element to them of horse
[48:30] another one and if they're running it's
[48:32] always better a and like and the water
[48:34] you see there what is going up like we
[48:36] would run through water and not look as
[48:37] good as a horse
[48:38] well like imagine a sheep running
[48:40] through water you know or a cow wouldn't
[48:42] look as gracious as a horse like a
[48:44] giraffe but a horse just has a it's got
[48:48] a presence about it you know it's been
[48:50] it's a design of God that's been
[48:52] designed in a special way
[48:54] you know just it's got this something
[48:58] about it and it's actually been designed
[48:59] with humans and mind I more so than I
[49:01] think any other creature like when God
[49:03] made a giraffe or an elephant he wasn't
[49:05] really thinking you know they're gonna
[49:06] be a real buddy of me and although
[49:08] people do have drafts and they write
[49:09] elephants in that but there's creatures
[49:11] like a like a horse or like a dog that
[49:13] kind of have been in a way maybe even a
[49:16] cat but I'm not too fond of cats but
[49:21] they've been designed with people in
[49:23] mind you know I think God had people in
[49:25] Rome and he designed a horse he had
[49:26] people in mind he didn't just have our
[49:29] this thing we just go unnoticed like a
[49:30] skank you know that all these funny
[49:34] little creatures you know they don't
[49:36] really have much of a bond but horses
[49:38] horses have a bond they've just got
[49:41] something special about them and I think
[49:44] after doing this and you're looking at
[49:45] the horses for a week I kind of get to
[49:46] like horses I think I must get me a
[49:48] horse one day by the end of it yeah I
[49:51] like this one doesn't he look amazing
[49:53] he's just
[49:55] but you wonder what he's thinking
[49:56] sometimes they what's that horse
[49:57] thinking they portray this idea of what
[50:00] they're thinking but and I think they're
[50:01] actually portray they're thinking what
[50:04] they're portraying but I'll show you
[50:05] that later on
[50:10] okay so
[50:13] so now about two summers ago two
[50:16] Christmases ago something happened to me
[50:17] at Christmas time I became a cowboy so I
[50:26] was given this authentic american-made
[50:29] cowboy hat for Christmas and I became a
[50:33] UH that was me I was a real cowboy who's
[50:37] wanted to be like a cowboy you watch
[50:38] little all the boys like yeah you know
[50:41] you're watched when you're young you
[50:42] watch cowboy movies you think man I'm
[50:44] gonna be a cowboy and I'm big but most
[50:47] of us never quite get the array but we
[50:49] we just hang on all the way through life
[50:50] we're gonna be a cowboy one day you boys
[50:53] are still got hope man you're young you
[50:54] can do it but I finally got there when I
[50:57] got this hat you know so I became is
[50:59] that what makes you a cowboy there's a
[51:02] few little like minor details like that
[51:06] I don't that I lack like horse saddle
[51:12] boots Spurs pistol workless ooh cows any
[51:16] sort of horse riding experience or any
[51:18] sort of farm job
[51:20] hey but aside from all those minor
[51:22] details we'll call them I'm actually I'm
[51:25] a cowboy I've made it because I've got
[51:27] the Hat hey the real head and as a
[51:31] result because this sort of cowboy you
[51:34] know runs in the family all my children
[51:36] are now you know they're all cowboys and
[51:39] cowgirls too so we've got a real strong
[51:42] family tradition of you know so if you
[51:44] wonder where I'll get my authority to
[51:46] speak on these things about horses it's
[51:47] because I'm
[51:49] quite clearly a horse person right but
[51:54] well but luckily luckily somebody in the
[51:57] family we finally made it someone in the
[51:59] family finally actually managed to get
[52:02] their hands on a horse which was my
[52:04] daughter Hannah
[52:05] we actually prayed that the Lord would
[52:06] provide a horse and the Lord provided
[52:08] this horse here for Hannah so she's
[52:11] actually so we're kind of our where
[52:13] we're us it's within grasp now this
[52:16] whole cowboy thing as long as I can that
[52:18] right-handers horse so Hannah's got this
[52:21] this little horse here
[52:23] I think I'm pushing the button but I'm
[52:25] not so now now this is where the thought
[52:30] comes from this idea of horses so so
[52:33] here's his Hannah's horse called our
[52:37] Missy right just and the paddock in
[52:41] there a landlord which lives over the
[52:44] back we were talking to him about horses
[52:45] and his wife as a quite a good horse
[52:47] rider she's done horses all her life in
[52:49] and we got talking about the horse and
[52:53] we were looking at the horse and this
[52:54] picture here and we asked ourselves one
[52:59] question which would which is maybe not
[53:02] a question usually asked but when you
[53:03] ask it it's kind of obvious you think
[53:04] why didn't I think of that question
[53:05] before
[53:06] why don't houses do that and the
[53:08] question that we wondered was why
[53:10] doesn't the horse just jump over the
[53:12] fence and go wherever it wants to go
[53:14] have you ever thought that about a horse
[53:16] my horses can jump most horses and most
[53:20] of the fences that get built and not
[53:23] like a deer fence like if you see a
[53:26] paddock with deer and they've got to
[53:27] build these fences you know as high as
[53:29] the wall there because the deer will
[53:31] just jump over the fence they have this
[53:32] nature they just jump jump you don't get
[53:34] away get away even tame deer will just
[53:36] jump over fences but horses you'll build
[53:39] a fence this way and they were just
[53:42] 90% of the time now there are there are
[53:44] exceptions but and as a general rule
[53:46] horses will just stay in the paddock
[53:47] they just even if they're a show jumper
[53:50] like it and they're used to jumping six
[53:52] foot high fences he'll just they won't
[53:54] jump this fence and and he said you know
[53:57] it's a funny thing with horses they're
[53:59] horses they they're actually they're
[54:04] actually quite lazy and I read you a
[54:06] quote from a horse person they've
[54:07] generally a they're quite lazy but B
[54:09] they don't really have a strong willed
[54:12] to do things like that in the if so and
[54:16] this a rider gets on the back and says
[54:17] through this go and jump that fence and
[54:19] and enforces that's well upon the horse
[54:21] the horse burn it just says hey why put
[54:25] effort in to try and jump the fence it
[54:26] doesn't have enough will to jump the
[54:27] fence therefore we just stand the
[54:29] paddock it's made that way it's not it's
[54:33] well as designed that it unless you
[54:35] really tell it to it doesn't want to go
[54:36] and jump this fence that's how a horse
[54:38] is designed it's a very it's like a
[54:41] servant type of an animal we're in this
[54:44] it gets told to do something and put an
[54:46] effort and it will just sit back and
[54:48] actually quite lazy I'll read this so
[54:51] this is actually from a horse person to
[54:53] to explain what I mean and it it sums up
[54:57] reason they'll be ok so this lady says
[54:59] horses are naturally pretty lazy animals
[55:01] and this they have a really good reason
[55:03] they won't see a need to jump out of
[55:05] their enclosure now here's the small
[55:07] proportion that that do of course this
[55:10] doesn't apply to every horses if your
[55:12] horse some horses just really want to be
[55:13] with your buddies and work very hot past
[55:15] your fences other horses see many jump
[55:16] him for no reason but actually these
[55:19] horses aren't the Grand Prix jumpers
[55:21] horses that are trained to jump big are
[55:23] trained to listen to their riders if the
[55:24] rider isn't telling them to use all the
[55:26] energy and jump over the fence why
[55:28] bother
[55:29] it's like someone asking you to run
[55:31] cross-country 50 miles or 100 kilometres
[55:34] at a run some people would do this just
[55:37] because they love it but most people
[55:38] wouldn't go anywhere near it and this it
[55:40] was some big prize at the end right it's
[55:43] the same so you're saying it's the same
[55:45] with horses though so now we begin to
[55:50] you understand the concept of horses
[55:52] they're as it's powerful and strong as
[55:54] they are they've got so much energy
[55:57] harnessed inside them that that is and
[55:59] they're such fearless animals and yet
[56:02] they're actually quite lazy at the same
[56:03] time and this someone harnesses their
[56:05] energy and makes them go forward and use
[56:08] it they just won't use it they will just
[56:10] you know oftentimes you walk part yeah
[56:12] when do you when do you see a horse and
[56:14] a paddock running around and when you
[56:16] see it standing most of the time you
[56:18] just see them standing there right now
[56:20] and then you'll see them gallop but they
[56:21] generally just stand around now there's
[56:24] a reason why I want to show you this
[56:25] because this is a first type that I want
[56:27] to get into so is anyone know this song
[56:30] I'm not gonna base my doctrine on a song
[56:31] but this is a concept do you never know
[56:34] the song there's something within me got
[56:37] a hold of the reins no uhit's just a
[56:41] Christine would not if she was here she
[56:43] knows all the old songs so this may be
[56:46] these some of these songs were written
[56:47] back and like if you take back a while
[56:51] ago when a lot of people would sail on
[56:52] ships you know then a lot of the songs
[56:54] were about ships and you know going into
[56:56] new lands and and the wind blowing and
[56:58] storms in it because men and women were
[57:00] used to going on ships and so that was
[57:02] how they talked a lot of these songs but
[57:03] but there are a lot of songs about the
[57:05] rains you know likes Jesus the Lord
[57:07] taking the reins of our heart you know
[57:09] that something's got a hold of the reins
[57:10] and typing us to a horse cuz these
[57:12] people would have rented a lot of horses
[57:13] and they understand you know I control
[57:15] this horse and I take it where I wanted
[57:16] to go therefore I want to be the same
[57:19] with the Lord he can take the reins of
[57:20] my heart and direct me where that I want
[57:22] to go so this is actually quite a nice
[57:24] loooong maybe we'll introduce it to the
[57:26] church one day right but now so I want
[57:29] to type the first thought about a horse
[57:32] as that
[57:34] and the type of you and I we're actually
[57:38] we are quite you know we've got a lot in
[57:40] us we've got a lot of talents we've got
[57:41] a lot of ability to do things but you
[57:44] know we're actually I'm not going to say
[57:46] we don't do anything but we're actually
[57:47] quite lazy and we won't really do much
[57:49] right we just sort of sit around but
[57:56] I'll let you know that when we get to a
[57:58] certain age no one remains unbroken you
[58:00] know you get a broken wild horse that
[58:01] does its thing nobody in this world
[58:03] remains unbroken
[58:04] no-one's a wild horse free spirit of no
[58:07] one's riding me and I know every horse
[58:09] gets broken by somebody something right
[58:12] that's why there's so much turmoil in a
[58:14] teenager's life far beyond that time
[58:16] because here's this horse that's coming
[58:18] to the age of accountability in a sense
[58:20] someone wants to hop on that horse and
[58:23] use it for themselves to write it use
[58:26] all the use someone wants to use the
[58:28] talents that that person's got they want
[58:30] to use the energy they've got they want
[58:31] to use their abilities and this this is
[58:34] God or Satan as after that to take
[58:36] control of that horse and that's what's
[58:38] that's what happens in in and out in our
[58:41] lives
[58:41] someone once someone is going to break
[58:44] us in and write us now we may change
[58:46] riders later and we might get this Satan
[58:49] and then later on we think they would
[58:50] know we don't want you and we let the
[58:51] Lord come and take control but only you
[58:53] know in every person's life somebody has
[58:56] got the reins of your heart and is
[58:58] riding you we say well I'm my own person
[59:00] I control my own thoughts every thought
[59:03] you have was given by somebody whether
[59:06] it be the Word of God or Satan's
[59:08] thoughts we're governed by thoughts and
[59:10] those thoughts of the reins that guide
[59:11] our life because it's thoughts that
[59:13] guide our life and God's Word is just a
[59:15] thought we read on a paper but it's just
[59:17] his thought and it's taking that thought
[59:19] in our mind and letting that thought
[59:20] Gladys net thought will guide us through
[59:22] life and the spirit that is associated
[59:24] with that thought will guide us through
[59:26] life therefore it's the same with
[59:28] satan's thoughts what you're anti God
[59:29] they say you can do this and do these
[59:31] other things the negative things and the
[59:33] same spirit that gives those sorts will
[59:35] also guide you it's this
[59:38] so I've got the scripture here just to
[59:40] explain about a horse at some 32:9 SBE
[59:43] not as the horse or as the mule which
[59:45] have no understanding that's us
[59:48] whose mouths must be held with bit and
[59:50] bridle s that come nigh unto thee now I
[59:53] don't want to downplay what humans are
[59:54] but we all know that's the truth now we
[59:58] get type like sheep all are like sheep
[1:00:00] have gone astray you know God doesn't
[1:00:01] really give us much wisdom B says has
[1:00:05] any lack wisdom let him ask of me and
[1:00:07] I'll give them wisdom you know so now we
[1:00:09] can become wiser than that but it's only
[1:00:10] by the wisdom that God gives us and
[1:00:12] ourselves that we're left to ourselves
[1:00:13] where do we garner wisdom from you know
[1:00:17] where do we gather it from so the
[1:00:19] scripture here is what I wanted to which
[1:00:21] which portrays the the type of a horse
[1:00:24] Romans 6:16 says know you're not there
[1:00:26] to whom he yield yourselves servants to
[1:00:28] be his servants he are to whom ye obey
[1:00:31] whether of sin unto death or of
[1:00:34] obedience unto righteousness see so he's
[1:00:38] saying whichever person you let ride you
[1:00:40] and control you that's the best that's
[1:00:43] their going to take you where they want
[1:00:44] to go I go where I want to you know you
[1:00:46] don't you get led we get lit around and
[1:00:49] you know and and we've got so much
[1:00:53] energy within us to do things right
[1:00:55] we've got a lot of energy we're actually
[1:00:57] very powerful creatures
[1:01:00] and God uses man and soda Satan because
[1:01:04] we've got powerful ability to go and do
[1:01:06] things but same as a horse a horse is
[1:01:09] very powerful but you see even in the
[1:01:10] paddock myself but just stand there not
[1:01:12] won't do anything you get a writer get
[1:01:13] on that horse and say right this is what
[1:01:15] we're going to do that horse will go day
[1:01:17] in day out day in day out we can week at
[1:01:19] year in year out for that writer doing
[1:01:21] whatever the writer since brought to do
[1:01:23] now and I want to say this Christians
[1:01:26] aren't the only ones that do great
[1:01:27] things
[1:01:28] non-christians do as well but they're
[1:01:30] because someone's using the energy their
[1:01:32] talent to do a great thing for him for
[1:01:34] his kingdom and and the Christian lets
[1:01:37] God come and control us and use our
[1:01:39] talents use our skills use everything
[1:01:41] that we've got for his kingdom use the
[1:01:42] strength that we have and I've got a few
[1:01:46] stories about some horses just to just
[1:01:50] to type like you know maybe see yourself
[1:01:52] in the picture or just to get just to
[1:01:54] get the example that these horses that
[1:02:01] we're going to talk about generally if
[1:02:02] they didn't do this they would have been
[1:02:03] sitting in a paddock somewhere doing
[1:02:05] nothing and they didn't actually choose
[1:02:07] one day right I'm gonna go out and do
[1:02:08] this thing someone came up to them and
[1:02:10] said right I want to take you and we're
[1:02:11] gonna go and do this and I think I like
[1:02:14] conflict stories because they and times
[1:02:16] of conflict that seems to bring out
[1:02:18] something in people that it brings out
[1:02:19] quite strong situations yeah this one no
[1:02:22] wars are nice I don't agree with wars
[1:02:24] whatsoever I think there I'm glad and
[1:02:26] hearing there be no wars cuz Wars cause
[1:02:28] so much trouble down the line so much
[1:02:30] pain for generations and generations our
[1:02:33] war causes but for this story this is
[1:02:36] the actually the Korean War this is in
[1:02:39] the fifties and so so these these um
[1:02:44] these guys they they were using these
[1:02:48] certain these sort of guns and they took
[1:02:51] they took big um rounds of ammunition
[1:02:54] and these guns were up on hills cuz they
[1:02:57] would shoot across to the enemy on the
[1:02:58] other side and the the Americans had a
[1:03:01] big job of getting these big
[1:03:05] bullets ammunition things up to where
[1:03:08] there where the guns were and I guess
[1:03:11] one soldier could maybe take one of
[1:03:13] these things and he'd have to walk it
[1:03:14] all the way up and come back down take
[1:03:15] another one up because they were very
[1:03:16] heavy so they thought okay this is too
[1:03:18] much work for us and it's slow process
[1:03:21] and we're using a lot of resource
[1:03:21] getting these these guys these things up
[1:03:24] here so they so they said right let's
[1:03:27] hit with one a guy came up with an idea
[1:03:29] to just go and buy a horse and we'll
[1:03:30] just we'll train this horse to bring
[1:03:34] this ammunition so they're gonna they
[1:03:38] were going to strap these um we're just
[1:03:40] gonna call them big bullets right we're
[1:03:41] gonna strap them onto the what do you
[1:03:42] call them rounds yeah there must be a
[1:03:46] name haven't been in the army so don't
[1:03:49] know big bullets and so this horse could
[1:03:53] get four or six of these things on it so
[1:03:55] so they stake they got this horse and
[1:03:57] they started training this horse to to
[1:03:59] have the pack settle on it and you know
[1:04:04] run this ammunition but they were
[1:04:06] training the horse that when it heard a
[1:04:07] when it heard a big shot it would go
[1:04:09] down and you know get down into a bunker
[1:04:11] and different things and the soldiers
[1:04:12] with the humor their head they they
[1:04:14] called it hoof camp you know say we
[1:04:17] humans have boot camp so they said we're
[1:04:18] gonna take the horse through hoof camp
[1:04:20] okay so they they trained this horse
[1:04:23] excellent and and and this horse would
[1:04:27] go a few kilometers with this with these
[1:04:30] this ammunition on his back and go to
[1:04:32] the the wherever the gun wasn't come
[1:04:34] back and and this horse would do this
[1:04:36] all day they said they trained this
[1:04:37] horse to to firstly to not worry about
[1:04:41] the the gun fire what after a few times
[1:04:44] of a lot of explosions the horse would
[1:04:46] there'll be explosions all around and
[1:04:49] the horse would just be rummaging
[1:04:50] through the the soldiers bags trying to
[1:04:52] find some food you know after a while
[1:04:54] but this horse formed quite a bond with
[1:04:57] these soldiers and that the soldiers
[1:04:58] they all like the source after a while
[1:05:00] before they sent it out and it would it
[1:05:02] would just have free reign within the
[1:05:04] camp you know they could just go through
[1:05:05] round the camp and the soldiers would
[1:05:06] feed it all their rations all the time
[1:05:08] there'd of a feed coke and feed it
[1:05:10] lollies and feed all these things and it
[1:05:12] would go and sleep on whichever team
[1:05:13] that wanted to sleep in we just walk in
[1:05:15] a tent sleep in there one day I think it
[1:05:17] one guy had all these some speech
[1:05:19] the thing that his family has sent over
[1:05:20] some spiritual lolly had a big beggar
[1:05:22] than the source just eight haulers
[1:05:24] lottie's but but they treated this horse
[1:05:26] well there's a lesson in that these
[1:05:27] soldiers treated it well it was a no one
[1:05:29] was allowed to ride it that was a it was
[1:05:31] one of the buddies you know and they
[1:05:32] weren't to just must treat it they would
[1:05:34] you know if it wanted food they give it
[1:05:35] food and it just had free rein within
[1:05:37] the camp and they all like the source
[1:05:40] it's probably as biggest achievement was
[1:05:46] firstly what they what they would do is
[1:05:48] they would take the horse and show it
[1:05:50] once weird had to go and then come back
[1:05:52] and once it knew the way once then it
[1:05:54] would just do it by itself all day
[1:05:55] walking back and forth all day one day
[1:05:58] it made 51 trips back and forth during a
[1:06:01] three-day battle and one day it made 51
[1:06:04] trips back and forth to this this some
[1:06:06] gun and it would carry ammunition up and
[1:06:09] then they would strap winded soldiers on
[1:06:10] ass back and it would carry them back
[1:06:11] down and it made 51 trips back and forth
[1:06:13] all day this horse went back and forth
[1:06:16] in it it had obviously helped the army
[1:06:18] to keep shooting and then it brought
[1:06:20] back wounded soldiers and they this
[1:06:26] sauce over its course of a Slifer got
[1:06:28] promotions its name was sergeant
[1:06:30] reckless then I think it got corporal
[1:06:33] sergeant or it sort of they they did
[1:06:34] special ceremonies for the source but I
[1:06:37] think these guys meant it they like hey
[1:06:39] man this horse was actually he he fought
[1:06:41] as hard as we did you know he helped us
[1:06:44] and then win the war furnace they wanted
[1:06:46] to get it back to America
[1:06:48] and they had to fill out a lot of
[1:06:50] paperwork to do so and then they they
[1:06:52] put it on the list of goods to go onto a
[1:06:54] ship and
[1:06:56] and then when they got to the ship the
[1:06:58] captain of the ship see there's no way
[1:07:01] that horses coming on here because his
[1:07:02] ship had just won the cleanest ship for
[1:07:04] two years in a row he see there's no way
[1:07:06] the horse is coming in their shed and
[1:07:07] unless they said you signed for it horse
[1:07:09] and all its belongings but it was called
[1:07:11] sergeant reckless he obviously didn't
[1:07:12] read all the fine print so he had to
[1:07:14] take on the sauce and it actually
[1:07:16] vomited all over his dick but but then
[1:07:20] it then a winner went back to America
[1:07:22] they just let it retire and they they
[1:07:25] were feeding it goodies but I think the
[1:07:26] vet said oh only one cup of coke per day
[1:07:28] for the source because it was yeah so
[1:07:31] that horse would have just been sitting
[1:07:34] somewhere doing nothing right but and it
[1:07:37] didn't actually want to go and do all
[1:07:38] those things that didn't say I want to
[1:07:40] do that but it but someone came up to it
[1:07:43] and said I'll take that horse and and
[1:07:44] and let's go and do this thing and then
[1:07:47] as a result that horse did all these
[1:07:48] things that's the same in our life we
[1:07:50] don't decide I'll go and do these things
[1:07:52] the Lord comes to us and says this is
[1:07:54] what we're gonna go and do I've got one
[1:07:56] more this this is Gallipoli World War
[1:07:59] one now they these next one so this it
[1:08:07] was a horse called Bell and this was an
[1:08:09] Australian horse and he tracked the time
[1:08:16] back in Australia this horse was a very
[1:08:18] fiery horse and nobody could ride it so
[1:08:21] in one of the I guess the drafting
[1:08:24] stations where guys would come to sign
[1:08:26] up to go to the war they would use this
[1:08:28] horse to test out each person's horse
[1:08:30] riding skills I say you say can rode a
[1:08:32] horse all right
[1:08:33] um bring out bill and they would ride
[1:08:36] try and try and ride bill you know and
[1:08:38] if they could sort of stay on there for
[1:08:39] 30 seconds it was okay
[1:08:41] one guy stayed on there for two minutes
[1:08:43] they said yet you've you're you can come
[1:08:45] with us
[1:08:45] they found that later he was 14 he's 14
[1:08:49] year old boy saying they were growing
[1:08:50] him in but that was the longest anyone
[1:08:52] had stayed on the source for was two
[1:08:53] minutes they just he was a strong world
[1:08:55] he wouldn't let anybody ride to him you
[1:08:57] couldn't tame him he was just he was
[1:08:59] just angry and didn't like anyone but he
[1:09:01] was a really strong horse he looked
[1:09:03] strong and I think that's what kept
[1:09:06] every when these guys keeping him they
[1:09:08] thought well if nothing else he'll just
[1:09:09] be a pack horse you know we'll load
[1:09:11] things on them he'll go up and down and
[1:09:13] that's what we use them for cuz nobody
[1:09:14] can ride him so
[1:09:16] so that's what they did an Engel up
[1:09:18] early and World War one they had
[1:09:19] hundreds thousands and thousands of
[1:09:21] horses that they use all around the
[1:09:22] place and so a place like Gallipoli
[1:09:24] would be a horse would just can't
[1:09:26] supplies up the hill and come back down
[1:09:28] and and this horse was very strong and
[1:09:31] it would just do this all day and while
[1:09:35] they were there about seven kilometers
[1:09:37] away there was a maybe the the where the
[1:09:41] British were and they had to get news
[1:09:42] back and forth to tell them let them
[1:09:44] know Heather there's another camp to let
[1:09:45] them know how the war if it was going
[1:09:47] because it was before they had radio
[1:09:48] shows either a pigeon or a horse rider
[1:09:51] so but sometimes they would need to
[1:09:52] bring mail letters back and forth and it
[1:09:54] was probably letters for the soldiers as
[1:09:56] well but they would come to this other
[1:09:57] camp and then they would have a guy
[1:09:59] write on a horse to the main camp and
[1:10:01] the soldiers would always put bits on
[1:10:03] you know if the soldier would be shot on
[1:10:06] his way there or not because that the
[1:10:08] enemy tooks will be at the top and they
[1:10:10] would be shooting at the sky running
[1:10:11] along the beach yeah with the horse and
[1:10:13] that was always the bit will he make it
[1:10:15] will he not so they wager on if the guys
[1:10:17] going to make it through but one British
[1:10:21] quite a well quite a good horse rider he
[1:10:24] for some reason these guys all wanted to
[1:10:26] ride the horse to take the mail through
[1:10:27] you know risk getting shot but they they
[1:10:29] all sort of you know through the name
[1:10:31] out of the Hat yes I'm the guy that gets
[1:10:32] the ride and bring the mail I wouldn't
[1:10:35] want to do that if you know half the
[1:10:36] guys get shot but that's what they did
[1:10:37] and then so they said right you can ride
[1:10:39] bill as well because they just thought
[1:10:41] you know and so when people who heard
[1:10:43] they are riding bill this guy was gonna
[1:10:45] ride bill and he thought he could do it
[1:10:46] cause he was a you know good jockey
[1:10:47] they made a bit will he will the ride a
[1:10:50] tune up there will the horse and rider
[1:10:52] tune up there or will just the horse
[1:10:54] tune up there you know there was what
[1:10:56] they see with this one with Bill and
[1:10:58] sure enough after a while the horse
[1:11:01] chucked the guy off but then he carried
[1:11:03] on to the station so the mal got three
[1:11:05] but the guy unfortunetely didn't make it
[1:11:08] they say when he got to the station he
[1:11:11] the horse got shot along the way and and
[1:11:17] yet there was a um there was a guy there
[1:11:19] and he'd heard about this horse and had
[1:11:23] and didn't like anyone or anything like
[1:11:25] that but but he you know this guy
[1:11:27] started to he befriended the horse and
[1:11:30] he started going to it and bring it
[1:11:31] little treats and just being nice to it
[1:11:32] he was he was a they call him now a
[1:11:35] horse whisperer because back then I
[1:11:36] think people would just must treat the
[1:11:37] horses a bit but he started being real
[1:11:39] nice to the source and bring it treats
[1:11:40] and go and visit it and looked after its
[1:11:42] wounds and over time this horse learned
[1:11:44] to trust this man and so much so that
[1:11:48] after a while he would let this men
[1:11:50] right on him but nobody else if he
[1:11:53] no-nos tried to hop on bill he'd kick
[1:11:54] them off but as soon as this man did he
[1:11:56] could he could ride him and I think
[1:11:58] that's the way the Lord does it with us
[1:11:59] and even the most stubborn angry
[1:12:01] strong-willed people you know the Lord's
[1:12:03] got away - well his unconditional love
[1:12:06] to reach down and touch our hearts you
[1:12:07] know till we're even the even the most
[1:12:09] strongest strong world of people will
[1:12:11] submit to the Lord that's how the Lord
[1:12:12] can do it so now this man had convinced
[1:12:17] they would go from Gallipoli over to
[1:12:19] Egypt and they were going to fight in
[1:12:21] the and the campaign there and so this
[1:12:25] man was going there - and he asked if he
[1:12:26] could take bill on that campaign with
[1:12:28] him and so he was able to take bill on
[1:12:31] that campaign and this was the one where
[1:12:34] the light horsemen Australian light
[1:12:37] horsemen took Beersheba which was
[1:12:39] essentially the start of Israel coming
[1:12:41] back - to the children of Israel because
[1:12:44] the British got it then they gave it to
[1:12:45] Israel so the the that was the last
[1:12:48] major campaign but bill didn't write a
[1:12:51] net campaign he wrote in another
[1:12:52] campaign but they would essentially line
[1:12:55] up on their horses and make a charge on
[1:12:57] guns and you know hopefully they get
[1:13:00] they get to the place before they'll get
[1:13:01] shot and they can go on fire it was a
[1:13:03] wee bit harder I think than the old
[1:13:04] times where the guys only had arrows and
[1:13:06] Spears they had least Hansa getting shot
[1:13:08] but these guys were going against
[1:13:09] machine guns so after this the horses
[1:13:11] weren't used as much in battle but they
[1:13:13] were in this campaign so over the course
[1:13:17] of a night that's one heavy night of
[1:13:19] fighting day and night
[1:13:20] that this is how strong bill was that
[1:13:22] this guy wrote him all night but I think
[1:13:24] was 17 hours just all-around or you know
[1:13:27] 24 hours a whole day another hall
[1:13:30] another general over the course of one
[1:13:31] light went through 17 horses because
[1:13:33] they were just getting too exhausted but
[1:13:34] this horse just went and went and went
[1:13:36] but when the sky was and amongst all the
[1:13:40] battle he saw there were 4 soldiers the
[1:13:42] next one he saw there were there were 4
[1:13:44] soldiers their horses had been shot and
[1:13:45] they were just out in the open
[1:13:46] so this go on top of Burrell he went
[1:13:49] over and picked up these four soldiers
[1:13:50] so one stood and once stirrup me held on
[1:13:53] another one stood on one stirrup and
[1:13:55] held on the other side and another two
[1:13:56] guys hopped on his back so this horse
[1:13:58] was carrying five people and they were
[1:14:00] all holding on for the source and this
[1:14:02] horse ran a few kilometers and took
[1:14:04] these guys back to the the medic station
[1:14:07] and then this guy dropped them off and
[1:14:09] carried on that's how strong and and how
[1:14:11] much Willis was had and after while the
[1:14:14] the guy actually got shot in the leg
[1:14:16] Michael got the things the name was he
[1:14:18] got shot in the leg and the horse notice
[1:14:19] after a while that he wasn't getting any
[1:14:20] commands from the source from the rider
[1:14:23] so he actually turned around and went
[1:14:24] back to the medic station and dropped
[1:14:26] them off at the medic station and this
[1:14:29] guy this guy loved go the next one but
[1:14:32] he lost his leg in the process but the
[1:14:33] horse saved his life so this is probably
[1:14:36] one of the most famous Australian war
[1:14:38] horses but this horse didn't want to do
[1:14:41] anything like that
[1:14:41] he had no interested in people riding
[1:14:43] him were doing anything you know but
[1:14:44] when this guy showed him a bit of love
[1:14:46] in and he submitted his will to this guy
[1:14:49] then then he did these things next one
[1:14:51] they've made this um this guy's made a
[1:14:54] big bronze
[1:14:56] thank you out about I just sort of show
[1:14:58] you that it's quite interesting okay
[1:15:02] next one now I just want to read you
[1:15:04] this this is think about this quote as
[1:15:06] we go through something else this is
[1:15:08] just this is why a person that wrote
[1:15:09] about another popular horse but I just
[1:15:11] want to get the idea of this and I'll
[1:15:13] explain to you something later on he
[1:15:15] says we can be too sentimental but what
[1:15:17] has been obvious I think and
[1:15:18] particularly the reaction I've had about
[1:15:20] warrior because he was doing a display
[1:15:22] abouts Wars because horses can't speak
[1:15:25] there's a noble uncomplaining
[1:15:27] inspirational stoic isn't about the
[1:15:29] horse going about his work it doesn't
[1:15:32] have a choice but will go and work for
[1:15:33] you and in many cases die for you it's
[1:15:36] kind of sums up the way that we would
[1:15:37] think that a horse is like they just
[1:15:39] they're quiet they just go and do their
[1:15:40] thing all day every day and they seem to
[1:15:43] just do it
[1:15:44] uncomplainingly all right now wanted to
[1:15:47] tell you if your other stories ever want
[1:15:48] to go to something else this is brother
[1:15:51] Brandon beyond the curtain of time I
[1:15:52] think he liked this horses and that's
[1:15:56] got him in a bit of trouble cuz people
[1:15:57] said well there's no horses in heaven
[1:15:58] you know but he said hey my horse was
[1:15:59] there when I went there that's what I
[1:16:01] saw
[1:16:01] he said well isn't this wonderful and
[1:16:03] then I thought isn't that wonderful I
[1:16:04] heard something Nick oh like a horse I
[1:16:07] looked around and my little saddle horse
[1:16:09] that I used to ride little prince I
[1:16:11] thought so much of him he was here
[1:16:13] standing there by me and put his head
[1:16:15] over my shoulder to hug me like I used
[1:16:17] to give him sugar you know I think he
[1:16:19] had a good bond with us or skim a little
[1:16:21] bit of sugar I put my rounder arm around
[1:16:23] him I said Prince I knowed you'd be here
[1:16:31] next one
[1:16:34] this is an amazing story if you can take
[1:16:36] into context what we've talked about
[1:16:37] horses have a nature of if you love them
[1:16:41] they know it and they actually love you
[1:16:42] back they can sense the way you're
[1:16:44] feeling and and they you can break a
[1:16:46] horse and buy by force and it will
[1:16:48] actually its will will be broken by
[1:16:50] force too but that's the way many people
[1:16:52] used to do it but you can break it in by
[1:16:53] love and they will be broken in and
[1:16:55] submit to and say okay there's these two
[1:16:57] different ways you can do it and this is
[1:16:59] an amazing story this one rather BMC is
[1:17:01] I've walked I used to do a lot of riding
[1:17:02] I've rode for many years and roundup and
[1:17:04] so forth and I walked into wild horses
[1:17:07] and some here in a few minutes he'd have
[1:17:09] his he had laid over my shoulder I just
[1:17:11] put a blanket on him and walk him around
[1:17:13] a little with a blanket on him why were
[1:17:15] the blanket on him then throw the saddle
[1:17:17] on him then the first thing you know I'd
[1:17:19] be riding him along see he loves you and
[1:17:21] if he and if you really love him he
[1:17:23] knows it this is a completely wild horse
[1:17:25] now he's saying that he could actually
[1:17:27] go there and just love the source and it
[1:17:30] would just come over to him and he would
[1:17:32] just show love to it and the horse will
[1:17:34] let him ride it a wild horse that's what
[1:17:37] he said that's the way that horse is a
[1:17:44] I'm gonna tell you one more story just
[1:17:47] real quick this is a there was a an
[1:17:50] Indian guide and he was he had actually
[1:17:53] gotten he went to a different area in
[1:17:55] the states where he didn't usually go
[1:17:57] and he was having this horse got lost at
[1:17:59] and it was summer and there wasn't much
[1:18:01] water and they were trying to find water
[1:18:03] and then he walked the horse you know
[1:18:06] they were going going down a path and he
[1:18:10] thought you know this main path will be
[1:18:12] with the water as it'll be down this way
[1:18:14] so so he was he was walking down and
[1:18:16] then as they were walking down the path
[1:18:19] this horse started to want to go down
[1:18:23] this little side path and this man
[1:18:26] thought no the main way to water is down
[1:18:27] this main path so he was pulling the
[1:18:29] horse back and the horse woman want to
[1:18:31] go and he would bigger Spurs into the
[1:18:32] horse and make it want to go down this
[1:18:35] other way and I'm just going to
[1:18:38] paraphrase it for the sake of the story
[1:18:39] so he was digging his Spurs into it
[1:18:42] trying to get it to go down the certain
[1:18:44] way and it wouldn't go in
[1:18:46] almost to a point where where he was um
[1:18:49] the horse was like always falling
[1:18:51] underneath the guy you know and it was
[1:18:53] the side was bleeding from the Spurs
[1:18:55] bring the next one
[1:18:59] I read this and the horse knew also it
[1:19:01] was on the child to water had God gives
[1:19:03] unsink to the dumb beasts and down the
[1:19:04] trail that went finally a few turned off
[1:19:06] to one side just the rear a few off the
[1:19:08] beaten path the horse wanted to turn
[1:19:09] that way but coy thought different he
[1:19:11] tried to keep it in the main blaze trail
[1:19:13] and he started down and the horse would
[1:19:14] not go he spurred it in a nick and
[1:19:16] started the other way and it started
[1:19:17] rearing up she was too weak to back him
[1:19:19] off so he started pulling the Spurs to
[1:19:21] it again until he cut the horse next one
[1:19:23] so excited to get to water his life
[1:19:25] would be spared until the horse stood
[1:19:27] quivering bleeding he looked down look
[1:19:29] down there and she was quivering like
[1:19:31] that and almost falling under him and he
[1:19:33] looked down it here and seen the blood
[1:19:35] on her side he was a Christian and he
[1:19:36] see it to a source he said I've heard
[1:19:39] that that wild beasts had an instinct
[1:19:41] that don't look like that little bitty
[1:19:43] bunch or that path turned off there
[1:19:45] would be going to water it looks like
[1:19:47] this great path here would lead to where
[1:19:49] they go constantly for water but see it
[1:19:52] if you've cared me faithful this far
[1:19:54] I'll follow your instincts oh I think of
[1:19:56] that about Christ the way to destruction
[1:19:59] is posted and blazed all the way but
[1:20:00] there is a narrow road that leads to
[1:20:01] life few there will be they find it only
[1:20:03] not instinct but the Holy Spirit will
[1:20:05] turn you aside to their order of life I
[1:20:07] think it's brought me safe thus far I'll
[1:20:09] take up the rest of the way though sorry
[1:20:11] one before that so now the carry on the
[1:20:14] story so he went down this path and he
[1:20:16] found water this is a true story they
[1:20:18] down that little path they found water
[1:20:19] and the horse and him were jumping in
[1:20:21] the water and drinking and then after a
[1:20:23] little while he heard a yell from some
[1:20:25] from some guys and just down but from
[1:20:28] them was some old gold miners you know
[1:20:29] rugged old gold miners they see and they
[1:20:34] they saw these guys were hungry that the
[1:20:36] guy on his horse so they they gave him
[1:20:37] some food and then after a while they
[1:20:39] said to the guy here and I have some
[1:20:41] some whiskey and he said to them oh no
[1:20:44] thanks I don't I don't drink and then
[1:20:47] the guy said Knight have some whiskey
[1:20:48] you know what these guys are like and he
[1:20:51] said no no I've never drunk I don't
[1:20:53] drink and he said oh you can eat our
[1:20:56] beans but you can't drink our whiskey is
[1:20:57] that what it is you know and so this man
[1:20:59] started getting angry at him and after a
[1:21:00] while you pulled out his gun he said
[1:21:01] you're gonna eat them without drink the
[1:21:02] whiskey you're gonna die you know you've
[1:21:04] got two options you know I know you do
[1:21:06] good as you know
[1:21:07] there was nothing wrong with me so and
[1:21:13] his name was Corey I think he when he
[1:21:18] realized it was all up he said look okay
[1:21:19] I was gonna I'm not gonna drink the
[1:21:21] whiskey but just before you shoot me I'm
[1:21:23] gonna tell you why I don't do it he said
[1:21:25] my my mother when she was where before I
[1:21:29] live she told me that my father he died
[1:21:32] at a gambling table with a pack of cards
[1:21:33] in his hand in a in a whiskey you know
[1:21:36] and that was the life he loved and and I
[1:21:39] made a promise to my mother that I'd
[1:21:40] never touch the stuff she said that's
[1:21:41] the way your father went don't touch it
[1:21:43] so I made a promise to it and I'm not
[1:21:45] about to break it now kept it all my
[1:21:47] life through and I'm not going to break
[1:21:48] it now and then the man says I won't
[1:21:51] that slats going to be then and then he
[1:21:54] had the gun in one hand I guess the
[1:21:55] pistol and the whiskey and the other and
[1:21:57] just says he was going to do something
[1:21:58] shot rang out and one of the other guys
[1:22:03] that are sitting down with them and the
[1:22:05] camp had shot the bottle out of his hand
[1:22:06] with his gun and this man said look I
[1:22:09] made the same promise to my mother years
[1:22:11] ago but I hadn't kept it you know and
[1:22:13] I've just gone down this road
[1:22:14] he said now we're not gonna touch this
[1:22:16] man and this is a true story that man at
[1:22:18] that place did all those men to Christ
[1:22:20] there they all surrendered to the Lord
[1:22:22] there and you know that started from a
[1:22:24] horse thinking I'm gonna go this way but
[1:22:26] that was actually God directing it to go
[1:22:28] the certain way that's the way God's
[1:22:30] made a horse now so now we're going to
[1:22:33] go into a few a few horse stories that
[1:22:36] are really quite interesting and brother
[1:22:38] Aaron talks about these abut this is the
[1:22:40] bureau
[1:22:41] and his army chasing after the children
[1:22:44] of Israel so they all come to the Red
[1:22:45] Sea we know the story and and there's a
[1:22:47] pillar of fire there by day and night
[1:22:49] the sifrits or two and then God opens up
[1:22:51] the Red Sea that's what happened and the
[1:22:53] children of Israel went across and then
[1:22:55] when they were near the other side the
[1:22:57] God moved away over and then the
[1:23:00] Pharaoh's army with the horses see it
[1:23:01] okay now is their chance I find this
[1:23:03] amazing we're going to run through that
[1:23:05] and catch these guys I find that amazing
[1:23:08] that you know if you see a ridge if you
[1:23:10] see a seedpod and people walk across
[1:23:13] I say look you guys could go on me out
[1:23:16] of here this no no this is there
[1:23:19] something more happening here but these
[1:23:20] guys the heart was so hard and they said
[1:23:22] get them and now we're gonna run through
[1:23:24] this open sea this is beyond belief
[1:23:27] right now I'm gonna read you a quote
[1:23:30] from brother Branham next one notice
[1:23:33] walking light-footed and here comes the
[1:23:34] pretenders behind them these fellas
[1:23:36] coming along these Egyptians all loaded
[1:23:38] down and we find out their their wheels
[1:23:40] broken and they got drowned you know
[1:23:42] what God did he scared them horses them
[1:23:44] horses no they were doing wrong they
[1:23:46] were packing a bunch of sinners across
[1:23:48] the path why don't we even have horse
[1:23:50] since they knowed they were wrong
[1:23:52] please saying I'll read the scriptures
[1:23:54] and I'll explain to you
[1:23:55] Exodus 14 says and the Egyptians pursued
[1:23:59] and went and after them to the midst of
[1:24:00] the sea even all Pharaoh's horses and
[1:24:02] his chariots and his horsemen and it
[1:24:04] came to pass that in the morning watch
[1:24:05] the Lord looked through the host of the
[1:24:06] Egyptians through the pillar of fire and
[1:24:09] off the cloud and troubled the hosts of
[1:24:11] the Egyptians and took off their chariot
[1:24:13] wheels that drove them heavily that they
[1:24:16] drove him heavily so that the Egyptians
[1:24:17] he let us flee from the face of Israel
[1:24:19] for the Lord fighters for them against
[1:24:22] the Egyptians so the Lord troubled the
[1:24:25] hosts but the only ones that recognized
[1:24:27] that were the horses they were troubled
[1:24:29] they were spooked they were probably
[1:24:30] running this way in that way the
[1:24:31] Egyptians because their hearts were hard
[1:24:33] and they didn't feel this troubling from
[1:24:35] God they just pursued on unaware that
[1:24:37] God was troubling him but the horses
[1:24:40] were sensitive and they they were
[1:24:41] frightened and spooked and run this way
[1:24:43] and probably the chariots were moving
[1:24:44] around smashing into each other and
[1:24:46] everything's dad to fall apart because
[1:24:47] the horses were spooked next one we read
[1:24:51] the Quran from this quote them horses
[1:24:53] know they were doing wrong there was
[1:24:54] packing a bunch of centers across the
[1:24:55] path why don't we even have horse since
[1:24:57] they know they were wrong there was an
[1:24:59] old mule packing a backslidden prophet
[1:25:01] one time he got scared of the angel he
[1:25:02] could see the angel Balaam and these
[1:25:04] horses know they were doing wrong and
[1:25:06] the Bible said and that makes it right
[1:25:07] after Bobble see that the Bible said
[1:25:08] that he frightened Pharaoh's horses they
[1:25:10] were so long going they didn't know this
[1:25:12] is the Egyptians they were so long going
[1:25:14] they didn't know but the horses know
[1:25:16] knew more than they did
[1:25:18] may we have a sense like a horse those
[1:25:21] to recognize when the Spirit of God is
[1:25:23] troubling us about something thanks
[1:25:25] ma'am
[1:25:26] so now this is an interesting story this
[1:25:28] one who knows the story of Balaam now
[1:25:31] and the context of horses now now I want
[1:25:34] to read you the passage of of Balaam
[1:25:36] right in the context of the
[1:25:37] understanding of horses but I've changed
[1:25:39] their word ass or donkey their horse
[1:25:41] because it's kind of it's the same thing
[1:25:42] but just for what we're doing here it's
[1:25:44] like saying a chihuahua and a Great Dane
[1:25:47] you know there's still a dog they just
[1:25:48] look slightly different so he was
[1:25:50] actually unlike had more of a donkey
[1:25:51] thing but they've got the same the same
[1:25:53] thing so I've just put horse okay let's
[1:25:56] read through this and God's anger was
[1:25:58] kindled because he went and the angel of
[1:26:00] the Lord stood in the way for aniversary
[1:26:02] against them so Balaam has been going
[1:26:04] against God and he's going to go and
[1:26:05] prophesy that they against the children
[1:26:07] of Israel he was going right and and God
[1:26:10] was angry with him because he didn't
[1:26:11] want him to go that way to do that this
[1:26:13] is where we pick the story up now Balaam
[1:26:17] he was riding upon his horse and two
[1:26:19] other servants with him and the horse
[1:26:22] saw the angel of the Lord and the way
[1:26:24] and his sword drawn in his hand and the
[1:26:27] horse turned aside out of the way and
[1:26:29] went into the field so he's walking
[1:26:31] along on his horse and only the horse
[1:26:33] sees its angel with a sword draw him
[1:26:35] because that's God doesn't want Balaam
[1:26:36] to go that way and the horse turns aside
[1:26:38] right
[1:26:45] and Balaam smoke the horse to turn her
[1:26:47] back into the way go in the right way
[1:26:49] what are you doing but the angel of the
[1:26:52] Lord stood in the path of the vineyard a
[1:26:54] wall being on this side and a wall on
[1:26:56] the other side and when the horse saw
[1:27:00] the angel of the Lord she thrust herself
[1:27:02] against the wall and crushed Balaam's
[1:27:04] foot against the wall and he smote her
[1:27:06] again stupid horse and the angel of the
[1:27:11] Lord went further and stood in a narrow
[1:27:13] place where there was no way to turn
[1:27:15] either to the right hand or to the left
[1:27:18] and when the horse saw the angel of the
[1:27:20] Lord she fell down under Balaam fell
[1:27:23] completely down said I'm not going any
[1:27:25] further
[1:27:26] and he smoked the horse with a staff now
[1:27:30] as far as I can read and my research and
[1:27:33] the Bible as he ever another time where
[1:27:37] an animal has spoken to a person
[1:27:39] oh yes different no this so there's one
[1:27:44] aside from that thank you so from that
[1:27:50] after that in the whole of the Bible
[1:27:52] that horses have unique place in the
[1:27:54] Bible because there are things that only
[1:27:56] your horse has ever done and from my
[1:27:58] understanding aside from the serpent
[1:28:00] there's been no times where an animal
[1:28:02] has actually spoken to a person this
[1:28:04] might sound strange but this is what
[1:28:05] happened right and the Lord opened the
[1:28:09] mouth of the horse in then the horse
[1:28:11] said unto balaam what have I done unto
[1:28:14] thee that thou has smitten me these
[1:28:15] three times now Balaam has an argument
[1:28:19] with his horse and Balaam said unto the
[1:28:22] horse because thou has mocked me I would
[1:28:25] there were a sword in my hand for now I
[1:28:28] would kill thee
[1:28:29] and the horse answers back and a horse
[1:28:32] said unto balaam am I not thine horse
[1:28:34] Epona which thou has ridden since I was
[1:28:37] dying unto this day
[1:28:39] he's saying you've had me since I was
[1:28:42] little every took morning you've woken
[1:28:44] me up of I've you know you've ridden on
[1:28:46] me every day I've just served you
[1:28:47] faithfully every day he said was I ever
[1:28:51] want to do so unto thee he's saying I've
[1:28:53] I've we've been with you for years
[1:28:55] carried you around have ye ever done
[1:28:56] this to you before if I ever done this
[1:28:58] to you before and then Balaam's about to
[1:29:02] lose an argument with a horse because
[1:29:06] Balaam said no now that I think about it
[1:29:11] no this is strange you've never done
[1:29:14] this before what's the problem you lost
[1:29:17] an argument with a horse then the Lord
[1:29:20] opened the eyes of Balaam and he saw the
[1:29:22] angel of the Lord standing in the way
[1:29:24] and a sword drawn in his hand and he
[1:29:25] bowed down his head and fell flat on his
[1:29:27] face
[1:29:29] and the angel of the Lord said unto Him
[1:29:32] wherefore has thou smith and nine horses
[1:29:34] these three times
[1:29:36] behold I went out to with Stanley
[1:29:37] because there was perverse before me and
[1:29:39] the horse saw me and turned it from me
[1:29:41] these three times unless he had turned
[1:29:43] from me surely now also I had slain Lee
[1:29:46] and saved her life and Balaam said unto
[1:29:48] the angel of the Lord I have sinned for
[1:29:50] I knew not that they are stood us and
[1:29:53] the way against me now therefore if it
[1:29:54] displeased as they all get me back again
[1:29:56] next one and the angel of the Lord said
[1:29:58] unto balaam go with the men but only the
[1:30:00] word that I shall speak unto thee that
[1:30:02] shall speak so Balaam went with the
[1:30:04] princes of Balak
[1:30:06] interesting game may we be like a horse
[1:30:10] while there but that's the only time
[1:30:12] that I've that I know now go to the next
[1:30:15] one I've got this quote here again
[1:30:16] because now what this guy talked
[1:30:17] described about a horse we've actually
[1:30:19] had this unique insight to get into the
[1:30:21] mind of a horse because the horse spoke
[1:30:23] right we've had a persona Reedus quote
[1:30:26] again we can't be to submit since we
[1:30:27] know what's been obviously I think here
[1:30:29] particularly the reaction I've had about
[1:30:30] warrior because horses can't speak
[1:30:32] there's a noble uncomplaining
[1:30:34] inspirational stark ISM about the horse
[1:30:36] going about its work it doesn't have a
[1:30:38] choice but will go and work for you any
[1:30:39] many cases die for you they pretty much
[1:30:41] summed up their horse correctly because
[1:30:43] Balaam's horse didn't say look I'm sick
[1:30:45] of riding for you if you're gonna beat
[1:30:46] me I'm out of here
[1:30:47] but just see I've done this all my life
[1:30:48] have I done this before no it wasn't it
[1:30:51] actually didn't complain or anything it
[1:30:52] just I just kept on it wasn't gonna
[1:30:55] change anything it was just gonna stay
[1:30:56] there and take whatever it had to take
[1:30:57] but it was it was just saying have I
[1:30:59] done anything right I'll go next one
[1:31:02] I've got another unique thing of a horse
[1:31:06] can you think of another animal in the
[1:31:08] Bible that and the natural sense that
[1:31:10] God has made a supernatural example of
[1:31:16] it and the natural aside from a
[1:31:18] prophetic vision like prophets would see
[1:31:19] visions right but but in terms of
[1:31:22] actually seeing a natural animal and a
[1:31:24] supernatural state aside from a horse I
[1:31:27] can't think of any other and this the
[1:31:29] taboo thinks of one well we're talking
[1:31:31] about this I can't think of any any
[1:31:33] other animals that the Lord has actually
[1:31:35] and essentially in public outside of a
[1:31:37] vision was a horse I want to read you
[1:31:40] this one this is Elijah and Elijah was
[1:31:42] following Elijah
[1:31:43] and it came to pass and Elijah was going
[1:31:47] to go and Elijah he lied she was going
[1:31:48] to go and he'll I sure knew that and the
[1:31:50] Bible says and it came to pass when they
[1:31:52] were gone over that Elijah sit down to
[1:31:53] Elijah asked what I shall do for thee
[1:31:55] before I be taken away from there and
[1:31:57] he'll I she said I pray thee let a
[1:31:58] double portion of thy spirit be upon me
[1:32:00] and he said there are there has asked a
[1:32:02] hard thing nevertheless if thou see me
[1:32:04] when I'm taken from the head shelby say
[1:32:06] unto thee but if not it shall not be so
[1:32:08] so Elijah is not going to take his hands
[1:32:10] off Elijah so they're walking and it
[1:32:13] came to pass as they still went on and
[1:32:15] talked that behold there appeared a
[1:32:17] chariot of fire and
[1:32:19] a fire imparted in both asunder and
[1:32:22] Elijah went up by a whirlwind into
[1:32:24] heaven and Elijah Elijah saw it and he
[1:32:26] cried my father my father the chariot of
[1:32:28] Israel and the horsemen thereof
[1:32:29] so I've been god-like sources he made
[1:32:32] himself a one out of fire a supernatural
[1:32:35] one to come down you know he could have
[1:32:37] just carried him up in some other form
[1:32:38] but he thought now I'm gonna make a
[1:32:39] horse and a chariot and I'm gonna have a
[1:32:42] horse and a chariot come down and pick
[1:32:43] him up he did it twice actually any
[1:32:46] light any in in that time then birth to
[1:32:49] the next one this is Elijah when he was
[1:32:52] with them his seven I think it was gazer
[1:32:54] yeah and the the Syrians were were after
[1:32:58] them and had encamped about the city we
[1:33:01] picked it up here and he said go and spy
[1:33:03] where he is we where Elijah is the king
[1:33:05] of Syria that I may send and fetch him
[1:33:07] and I was told him saying behold he is
[1:33:09] in Dothan therefore scenting he thought
[1:33:11] the horses and chariots and a great host
[1:33:13] and they came by night and compares the
[1:33:15] city about and when the servant of the
[1:33:18] man of God was risen early and gone
[1:33:19] forth behold and host encamped the city
[1:33:22] both with horses and chariots in other
[1:33:24] words they came during the night and the
[1:33:26] morning when he woke up he went looked
[1:33:27] outside and all around the city were the
[1:33:29] horses and chariots of the Syrians and
[1:33:32] next one and a servant said unto him a
[1:33:35] last my master how shall we do and he
[1:33:37] and Elijah said fear not for they be
[1:33:40] more with us
[1:33:42] well they that be with us are more than
[1:33:44] that be with them and Elijah prayed and
[1:33:47] said Lord I pray the open his eyes that
[1:33:49] he may see and the Lord opened the eyes
[1:33:51] of the young man and he saw and behold
[1:33:53] the mountain was full of horses and
[1:33:55] chariots of fire around about Elijah I
[1:33:58] just think that's amazing that you know
[1:34:00] the Lord of all the things he could have
[1:34:01] made he makes the horse and I think
[1:34:03] there's the only times in the Bible
[1:34:05] where he makes a supernatural being of a
[1:34:07] natural animal it's a horse can you
[1:34:09] think of me we might be onto that one
[1:34:12] but there's something about a horse this
[1:34:16] is something about it this is my last
[1:34:18] point that I want to bring up my last
[1:34:19] type you know the three horses in the
[1:34:23] book of Revelation you've got the white
[1:34:24] horse red horse the black horse now
[1:34:27] they're actually four but the fourth
[1:34:29] horses essentially the fourth or says
[1:34:30] the three all together so that's a the
[1:34:33] Trinity of these horses there are four
[1:34:35] but the fourth one of these three and
[1:34:37] the the you know if we've if we've read
[1:34:41] the seven seals we know that is that the
[1:34:44] white horses you know that they had the
[1:34:46] rider and then I'll just read yukos the
[1:34:49] next one I read this quote first
[1:34:51] notice a change of color of these horses
[1:34:54] same rider change of color of horses and
[1:34:57] a horse as a beast and a beast and the
[1:34:59] Bible under a symbol represents a power
[1:35:01] the same system on another color power
[1:35:04] from the innocent white to the bloody
[1:35:05] Red Sea watch him now he's coming now a
[1:35:07] horse and this sense is representing a
[1:35:09] power so once again this something has
[1:35:13] got energy and something else is going
[1:35:15] to harness the energy and use it right
[1:35:17] and Satan uses this he uses these
[1:35:19] different powers to work his will upon
[1:35:21] the earth to overcome the saints so that
[1:35:24] so the horses are typed again is this
[1:35:26] beast that's got power but it won't just
[1:35:28] use its power it would just sit around
[1:35:30] but this the Antichrist came on it and
[1:35:32] the first one was the the white one it
[1:35:35] was a spiritual power it came and like
[1:35:37] spiritual you know an innocent and the
[1:35:38] rider was upon it the second one was a
[1:35:40] political power when it went and he
[1:35:42] threw the Roman Empire when it killed
[1:35:44] all the Christians who slayed people the
[1:35:46] third one you could say was probably
[1:35:47] more financial because you know barley
[1:35:50] for a you know that the scales net it
[1:35:52] was it was more but
[1:35:53] the enemy used use these powers and God
[1:35:58] typed them as horses so you used these
[1:36:00] different horses next one now he rode on
[1:36:05] his white horse cunning there he then he
[1:36:08] was then he was give power he took peace
[1:36:10] slaughtered the millions that's the red
[1:36:12] horse that's what he was going to do as
[1:36:14] soon as he rode on through and he still
[1:36:16] does it now here he is about honors
[1:36:18] black horse now coming forth Dark Age
[1:36:20] that was the time just about the time
[1:36:22] after the church got set up and gone in
[1:36:24] power they smothered out everything else
[1:36:25] the Roman system and went through about
[1:36:28] hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[1:36:30] years and every and every reader knows
[1:36:32] as what every reader knows is the dark
[1:36:34] ages heavenly knows that so we're
[1:36:35] talking about the dark ages where that
[1:36:36] the church had full control over the
[1:36:39] over the basically everything and you
[1:36:41] could you couldn't really serve the Lord
[1:36:43] the way he wanted to there was too much
[1:36:44] control over the whole thing it was a it
[1:36:46] was a real dark time that was that the
[1:36:48] power that was represented in this black
[1:36:50] horse
[1:36:51] one more I just want to say this because
[1:36:55] I've got a better type than this right
[1:36:56] but I just have to go through this one
[1:36:58] notice the Antichrist now is on a pale
[1:37:01] horse mixed colors a horses of beasts
[1:37:02] that represents of power his power has
[1:37:04] all mixed up why it's politics it's
[1:37:06] natural powers it's religious powers its
[1:37:08] theme and powers it's all kinds of
[1:37:10] powers mixed together a mixed pale horse
[1:37:11] and mixed pale horse was he's got all
[1:37:14] kinds of power and that's what he's
[1:37:15] doing today he's on this pale horse
[1:37:17] using all these different types of
[1:37:19] powers to to to achieve his goal of just
[1:37:23] to wipe out the Saints and to take
[1:37:25] control
[1:37:26] he's on this pale horse with religious
[1:37:29] power financial power all these
[1:37:30] different powers you know spiritual
[1:37:33] power all these different ones is he's
[1:37:35] the Antichrist as as on his own horse
[1:37:38] because he needs to any some sort of
[1:37:40] he's got this desire he needs that power
[1:37:42] to run that through to now want to
[1:37:44] change course slightly here he's a quote
[1:37:47] now want to say something here you might
[1:37:48] not believe this but I looked it up to
[1:37:49] be sure there's only one original color
[1:37:52] everything else is mixed oh there's no
[1:37:55] one original color and that's white how
[1:37:57] many knows that there is only one
[1:37:58] original color
[1:37:59] anything else is mixed Christ is on a
[1:38:01] solid white unadulterated word from the
[1:38:04] beginning
[1:38:04] amen amen every color would be white of
[1:38:06] some chemistry hadn't broken into it
[1:38:07] amen glory every church will be standing
[1:38:10] on the Opera on the Apostolic doctrine
[1:38:12] of the word of God and confirming it if
[1:38:13] you didn't have Creed's or denominations
[1:38:15] and mixed into it then you are oh
[1:38:17] brother Evans I feel good right now yes
[1:38:19] sir yes sir next only one original color
[1:38:22] that's white it never mixed with
[1:38:24] denominations of Creed's no sir and
[1:38:26] remember his Saints their clothes and
[1:38:27] white robes not mixed with denomination
[1:38:29] in Creed's now we find out the
[1:38:31] denominational Creed's here is what you
[1:38:35] got your mixed color but this is the
[1:38:37] original color he's writing it's talk
[1:38:38] about a horse now original color is
[1:38:40] honest people and they've been dipped in
[1:38:41] blood
[1:38:42] that cleanse that gum and it sent it
[1:38:44] right back you're on to see that's right
[1:38:47] go the next one I want to just I'm gonna
[1:38:49] work this for a little bit and I want to
[1:38:51] show you my point now now we we saw the
[1:38:54] through the three horses right the first
[1:38:55] one was white but it wasn't really what
[1:38:57] it was a deceptive it was deceptive this
[1:39:00] is about the same way Satan deceives
[1:39:02] people was white red black you know like
[1:39:04] he deceives with shows it's all okay
[1:39:06] makes it look good makes it look like
[1:39:08] it's all okay let young people us find
[1:39:10] out where everything is gonna be fine
[1:39:11] you'll have fun you'll like this and a
[1:39:14] spiritual sin so this doctrines fine
[1:39:15] don't worry about it's all good you know
[1:39:16] you'll be happy he he comes in
[1:39:18] deceitfully and then reared as when he
[1:39:20] gets you and then black is gone that's
[1:39:22] the this is the order that he goes and
[1:39:24] this is how his power works and this
[1:39:26] grand scheme of the world or just down
[1:39:28] into our into our lives he does the same
[1:39:30] way with us if we if we get this Evo him
[1:39:35] and that white that we're talking about
[1:39:37] like this source here so I wanna read
[1:39:38] this one from Corinthians it says but
[1:39:40] what I do that I will do that I may cut
[1:39:43] off occasion from them which desire
[1:39:45] occasion that we're in their glory they
[1:39:47] might be found even as we talk about
[1:39:48] these people for such are false apostles
[1:39:51] deceitful workers transforming
[1:39:53] themselves into the apostles of Christ
[1:39:55] and no Marvel for Satan himself is
[1:39:57] transformed into an angel of light
[1:39:59] therefore it is no great thing if his
[1:40:01] ministers also be transformed as the
[1:40:02] ministers of righteousness whose end
[1:40:04] shall be according to their works so
[1:40:06] when we see a white horse in this
[1:40:07] context we're not talking a pure white
[1:40:09] pure horse we're talking deception right
[1:40:12] this that's what we're talking about
[1:40:14] this Satan can transform himself into an
[1:40:15] angel of light and deceive people but
[1:40:17] that's the source here
[1:40:19] now when I was looking into this I got
[1:40:21] slightly sidetracked and I just want to
[1:40:23] run through this for five minutes
[1:40:24] because I just thought this was so
[1:40:25] amazing I knew this before but looking
[1:40:27] into it it was I looked at the
[1:40:29] callewaert because I sinking in maybe I
[1:40:31] wanted to look into colors you know
[1:40:32] because there's something about the
[1:40:33] color white a true color white
[1:40:35] so I actually I ended up going to the
[1:40:38] light spectrum which is you know the
[1:40:39] colors that are in light I think Isaac
[1:40:42] Newton when he discovered this I think
[1:40:44] he had a Jubilee because he was a
[1:40:45] Christian he would have thought this is
[1:40:46] amazing
[1:40:47] you know the these these scientists back
[1:40:49] in those times most of them were
[1:40:52] Christians now so who's had it who's
[1:40:55] done a prism at school you know your son
[1:40:57] a light through it you do a prism it's
[1:40:59] cool I think this is amazing you shine a
[1:41:03] white light white light then to a prism
[1:41:06] a prism what a prism does is that it
[1:41:09] essentially reflects all those lights
[1:41:12] and they're different colors have
[1:41:13] different wavelengths and so it bounces
[1:41:14] off one side and off the other side and
[1:41:16] the different wavelengths of colors
[1:41:18] cause the colors to separate out so
[1:41:20] short or color that red has a certain
[1:41:23] wavelength and the up one and the other
[1:41:24] side has a longer wavelength so it
[1:41:26] separates out the colors now I'm not a
[1:41:27] physicist but that's just it's the way
[1:41:30] that this thing works so when it comes
[1:41:31] out the other end now people always
[1:41:33] thought that I it looks like that
[1:41:36] because the prism is kind of disrupting
[1:41:37] the white and it's making some other
[1:41:38] some other color it's making these
[1:41:41] colors appear but but Isaac Newton
[1:41:43] realized no there's a there's a color
[1:41:45] called white and all these colors
[1:41:47] actually mix together in it and it's the
[1:41:51] color is white but then these colors
[1:41:52] come out of that color so if you mix all
[1:41:55] those colors together and paint you
[1:41:56] wouldn't get what would you write but
[1:41:59] you mix all these light spectrum colors
[1:42:00] together and you'll get what I just
[1:42:02] think that's amazing and there's seven
[1:42:04] colors it's not six it's not 8 it's not
[1:42:06] 10 this 7 there's seven colors you know
[1:42:09] people try and argue about God but the
[1:42:11] more you look into it God's everywhere
[1:42:12] you know and you know what he what Isaac
[1:42:15] Newton did after there was he said
[1:42:17] actually there's no color black and the
[1:42:19] light solution is no black black doesn't
[1:42:20] exist he did away with black before that
[1:42:24] maybe they had black b/c no there's no
[1:42:25] black with black
[1:42:27] he didn't even put whitening but white
[1:42:29] as a combination of all of those colors
[1:42:31] and that's pure white you know it these
[1:42:33] colors come out of white you know but
[1:42:34] there's no black black black doesn't
[1:42:37] exist go Nixon now if you if you guys
[1:42:39] want to do a like a science experiment
[1:42:41] to confirm this you can actually you
[1:42:44] have to do it a certain way you've got
[1:42:45] to get a torch three torches and got to
[1:42:47] put three different cell phones over
[1:42:48] them colors and you've got a shot and
[1:42:50] onto a point and the middle point where
[1:42:52] these three combined will be white
[1:42:53] amazingly well that's how they make your
[1:42:55] computer RGB of the three colors but
[1:42:57] they your white color comes from mixing
[1:42:59] these colors together you wouldn't think
[1:43:01] this would happen but when you when it's
[1:43:02] all together it's white
[1:43:03] I think God's amazing right go your next
[1:43:07] one but I just want to tell you about
[1:43:08] these colors so they so so why is it you
[1:43:11] didn't see blacks not a color and it's
[1:43:13] not a color it's only the absence of
[1:43:15] light that causes everything no matter
[1:43:17] what it is to go black that's what
[1:43:19] that's what that's what black is it
[1:43:22] that's it's it's only there because
[1:43:24] light is taken away and the more light
[1:43:26] you take away from something they're
[1:43:27] more blacker things up here there's a
[1:43:29] lesson and that might sound simple but
[1:43:31] there's a major lesson and that the more
[1:43:33] light you take away the more blacker
[1:43:34] that thing actually becomes it's like
[1:43:38] that in our own lives with the light of
[1:43:39] God and their own lives it's like that
[1:43:40] in a spiritual sense when the light of
[1:43:41] the word of God comes even from a
[1:43:43] fellowship from a people the more the
[1:43:44] light is taken away the more blacker
[1:43:46] what is in there becomes just like this
[1:43:48] that's the principle of this whole thing
[1:43:50] black is just the absence of light of
[1:43:53] white and a light since next one and I
[1:43:58] just I just when I was thinking that the
[1:44:00] scripture came up which which doesn't
[1:44:02] say this specifically but when you think
[1:44:03] about it Solomon the wisest man in the
[1:44:05] world he was essentially saying this
[1:44:07] thing in the natural this may not seem
[1:44:10] like it connects but it does it says in
[1:44:12] Proverbs it says all the days of the
[1:44:14] afflicted are evil but he that is of a
[1:44:16] merry heart has a continual feast right
[1:44:19] and and in terms of you know affliction
[1:44:23] and that comes from Satan when when you
[1:44:26] know when we when we even when we drift
[1:44:28] away you know and we we have less of God
[1:44:30] we we start to get afflicted but someone
[1:44:33] that's that's if you're walking in a
[1:44:34] place of it you can type a flexion to
[1:44:36] like you know essentially a void of
[1:44:38] light because we're there's light and
[1:44:40] is not really a flexion right when you
[1:44:45] get into that state this isn't a natural
[1:44:47] sense in our lives we can actually
[1:44:49] things we can be looking at the same
[1:44:51] situation but comprehending it
[1:44:52] definitely because of our flexion that's
[1:44:54] why people can be next year saying life
[1:44:56] is them and you can be there saying
[1:44:58] praise the Lord I'm so happy right
[1:44:59] that's because you've got light in your
[1:45:02] life and you're actually looking out at
[1:45:03] every situation things are seeing color
[1:45:05] and you see so many beautiful things but
[1:45:07] if someone can be next to you looking at
[1:45:09] the same thing and but if they're if
[1:45:11] they're in darkness all the days of the
[1:45:14] afflicted are evil because they can't
[1:45:15] they won't they win there's darkness it
[1:45:17] just makes everything everything appear
[1:45:21] dark you not I mean yeah this you know
[1:45:23] life is such a beautiful thing when we
[1:45:25] walk with the Lord we see God everywhere
[1:45:26] we see it just it's so vibrant it's so
[1:45:28] full of color but you can't have color
[1:45:30] without light Caesar you take away God
[1:45:32] you lose life loses all its color that's
[1:45:35] why today people are getting more and
[1:45:36] more depressed because they've pushed
[1:45:38] out light and they're losing all the
[1:45:39] color they're just becoming so down and
[1:45:41] afflicted that's just darkness it's
[1:45:43] things that should be light a dark
[1:45:45] because it's a lack of color it's a lack
[1:45:47] of light it just that's what's happening
[1:45:49] so now this is my point now we want to
[1:45:53] now the white that we're talking about
[1:45:54] the light the white is this white we're
[1:45:56] not talking about this deceptive white
[1:45:57] like yeah the other horse was even
[1:45:59] though it's appeared like a white horse
[1:46:00] not it's not a true white horse right
[1:46:03] there's what brother BMC is here but
[1:46:05] we're now Lord appears here on earth
[1:46:07] he'll be riding on a snow white horse
[1:46:09] and he'll be completely fully the
[1:46:12] Emmanuel the Word of God incarnate and a
[1:46:14] man
[1:46:16] that's just how much different there is
[1:46:18] in them that's the difference of them
[1:46:19] notice the Antichrist is on a pale horse
[1:46:22] mixed colors a horse as a beast that
[1:46:23] represents a power his power is all
[1:46:25] mixed up why it's politics its national
[1:46:29] powers its religious powers its demon
[1:46:31] powers it's all kind of powers mixed
[1:46:32] together a mixed pale horse was he's got
[1:46:35] all kinds of powers but when Jesus comes
[1:46:37] it's on one solid color horse the word
[1:46:40] amen
[1:46:41] so now we're gonna type this now to this
[1:46:44] white horse that Christ is on is the
[1:46:46] word it's just pure it's not its it was
[1:46:49] the it was a white horse back then it
[1:46:51] didn't change to a red horse and a black
[1:46:52] horse it was a white horse back then
[1:46:54] it's been a white horse all the way
[1:46:55] through it's been the same all the way
[1:46:56] through pure not going to change it's a
[1:46:58] one solid white horse the word now keep
[1:47:01] that type in mind next one notice well
[1:47:04] this group is writing making this else
[1:47:05] ready to stomp out everything that won't
[1:47:07] agree with him there's another group
[1:47:09] being made ready after a while so the
[1:47:10] pale horse and all that demons are
[1:47:12] coming in being right really after all
[1:47:15] revelation 19 the next time the churches
[1:47:16] said she comes also not exactly upon
[1:47:18] horses but the Bible says he was on a
[1:47:19] white horse and the host of heaven was
[1:47:22] following him upon white horses that
[1:47:23] right so now Christ is riding on the
[1:47:26] white horse of the word the pure word
[1:47:28] that's the power that's carrying him and
[1:47:30] then he and then of us when when we
[1:47:32] appear in Revelation rather I'm saying
[1:47:34] we are type we're on that same white
[1:47:36] horse so we were riding upon the same
[1:47:37] word the white horse of the word that
[1:47:39] that that's the power that we have to
[1:47:41] move forward
[1:47:42] amen one more quote here they're
[1:47:45] gathering now to do it bringing up
[1:47:46] subjects from the four corners of the
[1:47:48] earth riding pale sickly sickly
[1:47:50] three-colored mix horse amen now in
[1:47:52] Revelation 19 not only is he going
[1:47:54] is he getting ready but Christ is
[1:47:55] getting ready to meet him the battle is
[1:47:57] going to be hot and here be Christ in
[1:47:59] Revelation 19 crisis get as gathered his
[1:48:01] not from the four corners of the earth
[1:48:03] because he's going to be a little bitty
[1:48:04] remnant was he doing he's gathering them
[1:48:06] from the four corners of heaven we'll
[1:48:07] get him souls under the Alpha tomorrow
[1:48:09] night and you'll see whether it's right
[1:48:10] or not four corners of heaven on a snow
[1:48:12] white horse he also has a name not death
[1:48:16] but the Word of God life amen
[1:48:17] God wrote on his thigh here the Word of
[1:48:19] God that's the only life because God is
[1:48:21] the only source of eternal life there is
[1:48:22] Zoey that's right
[1:48:24] and here and he has got life riding on a
[1:48:26] white horse and here is the man with
[1:48:28] three different powers mixed up called
[1:48:30] death gathering his earthbound delegates
[1:48:31] in crisis gathering his heaven-born
[1:48:33] subjects Saints he has got death road on
[1:48:36] whom Christ got life Road on him those
[1:48:39] with them are on white horses also white
[1:48:41] horses of the word and they are called
[1:48:44] the chosen before the foundation of the
[1:48:45] world amen they're the faithful to the
[1:48:47] word a mean fuel I like that call chosen
[1:48:50] before the foundation of the world and
[1:48:51] then faithful to the word by their
[1:48:53] choosing all simulated with new wine and
[1:48:55] oil
[1:48:56] you mean just riding right along coming
[1:48:58] down to meet them so that's the power
[1:49:00] that we have right as the power of the
[1:49:03] word that's the white horse that we
[1:49:04] wrote on that's who that's that's that's
[1:49:07] what all the saints all through the ages
[1:49:08] have written on the white horse of the
[1:49:10] word now yeah you can say this not I
[1:49:13] want to say the words lazy but you think
[1:49:14] about the word of God in this sense what
[1:49:17] does it do when no one's using it it
[1:49:20] just sort of it doesn't just go out and
[1:49:22] it just sits there but we gone right on
[1:49:25] that white horse of the word you know
[1:49:26] and it will take us through it will meet
[1:49:28] any enemy now want you know keep that in
[1:49:30] mind I want to read this last scripture
[1:49:32] about these horses about what our horse
[1:49:33] is like this is one of my most favorite
[1:49:35] scriptures in the Bible because it's
[1:49:37] it's powerful okay the next one and this
[1:49:39] concept oh I sorry keep going Dave oh
[1:49:43] sorry
[1:49:46] that one so I read this one here and
[1:49:47] then we'll go to the next one and we're
[1:49:49] near fears of white horse he has the
[1:49:50] word then to mix anything with there any
[1:49:52] kind of creed add one word to it take
[1:49:53] one word away from it is to pervert the
[1:49:55] whole thing
[1:49:55] oh my keep me with my word Lord that's
[1:49:58] this other horse the perversion is this
[1:49:59] other horse mixed and all changing not
[1:50:02] God
[1:50:02] don't mix anything with it just keep it
[1:50:04] the white horse keep it pure all the way
[1:50:06] through next one now this is the
[1:50:08] scripture I want to read and keep this
[1:50:09] in mind as you're thinking you're on
[1:50:11] your white horse of the word you know
[1:50:12] you this is this is the thing that you
[1:50:14] have to bring you forward
[1:50:16] God's talking to JoVE and he says hast
[1:50:18] thou given the horse strength as their
[1:50:21] clothed has NIC with Thunder Kenz
[1:50:24] they'll make him afraid as a grasshopper
[1:50:26] the glory of his nostrils is terrible
[1:50:29] next one he poor earth and the valley
[1:50:32] and rejoices and his strength he goeth
[1:50:34] on to meet the armed men he mock us at
[1:50:37] fear and is not a freighted neither
[1:50:40] turneth he back from the sword the
[1:50:44] quiver Ratliff's against him the
[1:50:46] glittering spear and the shield he
[1:50:48] swallows the ground with fierceness and
[1:50:50] rage
[1:50:50] neither believeth he that is a stet it
[1:50:52] is the sound of a trumpet next one he
[1:50:56] SAS among the trumpets ha ha
[1:50:58] and he smell us the battle afar off the
[1:51:01] thunder of the captains and the shouting
[1:51:04] now let me say this
[1:51:07] the Word of God if you hop on that word
[1:51:10] of God that word of God is fearless
[1:51:13] it'll ride into any enemy anywhere
[1:51:16] anytime hit on it's not going to turn
[1:51:20] back at any point it's got this fearless
[1:51:23] attitude about it you think about it if
[1:51:25] you've got a situation if you've got
[1:51:26] some sort of something you need healing
[1:51:29] for you can get on this word of God
[1:51:31] Horse and it will just take you straight
[1:51:32] towards that thing regardless no fear
[1:51:35] you've got a family issue something
[1:51:36] something that that you think you know
[1:51:39] it seems big this word of God it's not
[1:51:41] worried by a single thing it's got no
[1:51:44] fear if you put that horse towards it
[1:51:45] and go towards it it's got no fear
[1:51:47] whatsoever that's the type of a horse
[1:51:50] that will just go right towards that I
[1:51:52] think any situation you've got in your
[1:51:53] life of thisor if you've got a financial
