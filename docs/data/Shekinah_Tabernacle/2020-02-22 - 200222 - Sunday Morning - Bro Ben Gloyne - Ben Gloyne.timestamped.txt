[46:13] and we're going to read from verse 44
[46:16] here
[46:18] and we're going to read down to verse
[46:20] 51.

[46:40] matthew 24 and verse 44 therefore
[46:46] therefore
[46:47] be also ready for in an hour
[46:50] for in such an hour as you think not the
[46:53] son of man cometh who then is a faithful
[46:55] and wise servant whom his lord hath made
[46:58] ruler over his household to give them
[47:00] meat and due season blessed is that
[47:03] servant whom his lord when he cometh
[47:05] shall find so doing
[47:09] verily i say unto you that he shall make
[47:11] him ruler over all his goods but and if
[47:14] that evil servant shall say in his heart
[47:16] my lord deliath is coming and shall
[47:18] begin to smite his fellow servants and
[47:20] to eat and to drink with the drunken the
[47:22] lord of that servant shall come in a day
[47:24] when he looketh not for him and in an
[47:27] hour that he is not aware of and shall
[47:29] cut him asunder and appoint him his
[47:31] portion with the hypocrites there shall
[47:33] be weeping and gnashing of teeth and
[47:36] then we're going to go to revelations
[47:37] chapter 10. i'm going to read the last
[47:39] portion of this chapter we're going to
[47:41] read from verse 7 down to the end of the
[47:43] chapter of um down to verse 11.
[47:47] i believe it's very important that we
[47:48] look into the scripture we're ordained
[47:50] to fulfill as uh brother ahmad was
[47:53] saying on wednesday thoroughly enjoyed
[47:55] that service that um we need to know
[47:56] where we are in the scripture
[47:58] uh if we don't know where we are we need
[48:00] to find where we are you know there's no
[48:02] point having a map if you don't know
[48:03] where you are on the map
[48:04] you know so and we know that this
[48:06] message is opened up reveal to us where
[48:08] we are on the map of god's great plan
[48:10] so revelations 10 we're going to read
[48:12] from verse 7 down to verse 11. he says
[48:15] but in the days of the voice of the
[48:16] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[48:18] sound the mystery god shall be finished
[48:21] as he has declared to his servants the
[48:22] prophets and the voice which i heard
[48:25] from heaven spake unto me again and said
[48:27] go and take the little book which is
[48:29] open in the hand of the angel which
[48:30] standeth upon the sin upon the earth and
[48:33] i went unto the angel and said unto him
[48:35] give me the little book and he said unto
[48:37] me take it and eat it up and it shall
[48:39] make my belly bitter but it shall be in
[48:41] my mouth sweet as honey and i took the
[48:44] little book out of the angel's hand and
[48:46] ate it up
[48:47] and it was in my mouth sweetest honey
[48:49] and as soon as i had eaten it my belly
[48:51] became bitter and he said unto me thou
[48:53] must prophesy again before many peoples
[48:56] and nations and tongues and kings
[48:59] amen let's just bow our heads in a word
[49:01] of prayer this morning if you ever need

[50:29] anoint speaker and hearer one more time
[50:31] we ask for your glory amen
[50:34] amen god bless you may have your seats
[50:36] this morning so i want to um i i trust
[50:40] this will tie together in some fashion
[50:42] but i was sitting there on wednesday
[50:43] night and i got a bit of paper i started
[50:45] scribbling down some notes and you know
[50:46] i want to talk about the danger and the
[50:48] delay
[50:50] there seems to be a delay
[50:52] as as the you know peter would say in in
[50:55] um uh one of the epistles of peter he'd
[50:58] say that you know there'd be scoffers
[51:00] would rise in the last time saying where
[51:02] is the sign of his coming the world's
[51:04] just gone on as it has
[51:06] and people would say the same thing
[51:07] today they'd say well we've had wars
[51:09] before we've had rumors of wars before
[51:12] we've had economic trouble before we've
[51:14] had nations rise before whether that
[51:16] we've had nations fall before we've had
[51:18] pandemics before
[51:20] so it's just going to continue on
[51:22] but we know in the scripture that there
[51:24] is three woes in the book of revelation
[51:26] and a woe equals a world war we've had
[51:28] two already the third one's coming that
[51:31] third one will be a nuclear one but then
[51:33] that third one the bride will be the one
[51:35] absent from the battlefield we won't be
[51:37] here we're going to be taken off the
[51:38] earth before that ever happens but as we
[51:40] see what's going on in europe and around
[51:42] the world you know it's it's marching
[51:44] that way the tension's building the
[51:46] tension's rising something's got to give
[51:49] somewhere just like the uh you know in
[51:51] the earth there's a tectonic plate
[51:52] there's a pushing there's a force but
[51:54] eventually something slips and an
[51:56] earthquake happens
[51:58] and we are in the fulfillment of
[52:00] prophecy but we have prophecy to fulfill
[52:03] you know we're not here just just
[52:04] haphazardly we're not here just to
[52:07] occupy time
[52:08] we're not here just to live life
[52:10] but we're here to fulfill scripture and
[52:12] i can say this actually everyone will
[52:14] fulfill a portion of scripture but it
[52:16] depends what part you want to fulfill
[52:18] there's some parts we don't want to
[52:20] fulfill i don't want to fulfill being
[52:22] thrown into the lake of fire i don't
[52:23] want to fulfill going to the great
[52:25] tribulation i don't want to fulfill
[52:26] being left behind those parts are not
[52:28] for me that's not in my script i mean my
[52:31] script is i'm going in a rapture
[52:33] and if god is ordained i'm going in a
[52:35] rapture he'll give me a faith to take
[52:37] that rapture i mean we're going to
[52:38] understand that this is not a natural
[52:41] this is not a christianity is not a
[52:42] natural thing we work it out with our
[52:44] mind and try our best with our mind our
[52:46] human ability it's not that it's god's
[52:48] ability
[52:49] amen that's the thing that counts now
[52:51] i'm so glad when god when god you know
[52:54] the bible is a book of prophecy
[52:56] it's not just a book of history it's a
[52:58] book of prophecy and every scripture
[53:00] actually in the bible speaks of today
[53:03] and so but when god prophesies something
[53:05] he doesn't just throw it out there
[53:07] hoping someone will catch it one day and
[53:09] say that sounds like a good idea and i'm
[53:11] going to do it no when he prophesies a
[53:13] word he knows exactly who's going to
[53:14] fulfill it he knows exactly the season
[53:17] it's going to happen he knows exactly
[53:18] the conditions are going to be upon the
[53:20] earth he knows every minute detail of
[53:23] how it's going to happen i mean when
[53:25] isaiah would be inspired he'd say behold
[53:27] a virgin shall conceive god didn't just
[53:30] throw it out there hoping one day a
[53:31] virgin will believe this word and we'll
[53:33] fulfill it mary was part of that
[53:35] prophecy she was part of that she was
[53:37] the prophecy right her name wasn't
[53:39] specifically put in that because because
[53:42] the lord could have spoken through
[53:44] isaiah behold a virgin named mary shall
[53:46] conceive and it shall be by the holy
[53:49] ghost and the romans are going to be in
[53:51] charge of this nation the romans weren't
[53:53] even a nation then when isaiah spoke it
[53:55] but he's gonna say there's gonna be a
[53:56] power from from from italy they're gonna
[53:58] come and take over most of the world
[54:00] they're gonna be the world power of the
[54:01] day and you know there's gonna be all
[54:03] this going on and you know you're not
[54:04] gonna be your own nation anymore there's
[54:06] gonna be a woman called mary she's gonna
[54:08] be raised in nazareth right and she's
[54:10] going to have a visitation of an angel
[54:12] and she's going to believe his word
[54:14] because he's going to say to her you're
[54:15] going to fulfill this prophecy i'm just
[54:16] speaking he could have said all that
[54:18] but he didn't say that he just said a
[54:20] virgin shall conceive because he knew
[54:22] that that prophecy is fulfilled when
[54:24] when faith or revelation anchors into a
[54:26] predestinated person
[54:28] and she was that woman there wasn't
[54:30] another one it was her
[54:32] amen i'll say about the rapture there's
[54:34] not another one it's you
[54:36] i mean you've got to take a real person
[54:37] off if there's going to be a translation
[54:39] of a living people you're going to say
[54:40] that's me he's talking about not just
[54:42] someone else it's me
[54:45] hallelujah
[54:47] amen when god would tell abraham
[54:50] that that his seed was going to sojourn
[54:52] in a strange land and that'd be
[54:53] afflicted 400 years then he was going to
[54:55] bring them out with a mighty hand moses
[54:57] was part of that
[54:59] i'm just basically going to want to i
[55:00] was going to repeat what i said about
[55:02] mary but i want to emphasize this he
[55:03] could have told he could have told um
[55:06] abraham abraham your seat's going to go
[55:08] down into egypt
[55:09] they're going to be there 400 years
[55:12] it's going to come to a point where
[55:13] they're where the male babies are going
[55:15] to be thrown to the crocodiles in the in
[55:17] the nile and they're going to be you
[55:19] know they're going to be used as slaves
[55:21] but in that season they're going to cry
[55:22] out to me
[55:24] and uh and a husband and wife are going
[55:26] to begin to pray
[55:28] amram would pray after he got beaten in
[55:30] the field he'd come and pray and his
[55:31] wife would say you know jehovah would
[55:33] say you know why don't you let someone
[55:35] else pray tonight someone's got to pray
[55:37] if no one else is going to pray i'm
[55:39] going to pray if no one else is going to
[55:40] have a burn to see this fulfilled amen
[55:43] i'm going to have the burden and then
[55:44] the angel came to the house and said
[55:46] you're going to have the promised son
[55:47] and by faith they hit him hallelujah and
[55:50] abraham could have been told all those
[55:52] things you know he's going to be called
[55:53] moses and and his mother's even going to
[55:56] put him in an ark and throw him down
[55:58] into the nile it seems like it's a death
[55:59] sentence but but in the unseen realm
[56:02] there were angels lining the nail
[56:04] i mean gabriel the prophet told us
[56:05] actually stood on that little basket and
[56:07] whenever a crocodile came along he would
[56:09] push its nose down amen and and and and
[56:12] that and that you know that ark didn't
[56:14] just just wander half-passively down the
[56:16] aisle it had a path
[56:18] because it had a destination amen it was
[56:21] outside of moses control where he was
[56:23] gonna end up and he was predestinated to
[56:24] be raised up in pharaoh's palace and
[56:27] many times we think we're just going
[56:28] through life and it's out of our control
[56:30] and everything it's under god's control
[56:32] it's under god's control we may go
[56:34] through some whirlpools or some hard
[56:35] times but we'll come out of them i mean
[56:37] because we've got a predestinated
[56:39] destination but you've got to believe it
[56:41] if you believe it your whole life will
[56:43] be this is for me
[56:44] amen sir he so abraham could have been
[56:47] told by that told that by god
[56:50] he could have fulfilled the details of
[56:51] the red sea crossing that was all in the
[56:53] prophecy
[56:55] the death angel coming the blood being
[56:56] applied the nile turning to blood
[56:59] god could have told them all that
[57:01] because in god's mind that was how it
[57:03] was going to be fulfilled
[57:04] and it was fulfilled exactly as god
[57:06] ordained it to be
[57:07] so now here we are in this time
[57:10] and
[57:11] we have to look at it the same kind of
[57:13] way
[57:14] where where where it's being prophesied
[57:17] there'll be a bride in the end time
[57:19] as god started the church he's going to
[57:21] finish the church because he he's the
[57:23] alpha and the omega so how he started
[57:26] the church on the day of pentecost is
[57:27] how he's going to finish the church i
[57:29] mean so the church started in power
[57:31] demonstration of the holy ghost politics
[57:34] wasn't known among them they were one
[57:36] heart one mind one accord i mean one
[57:38] burden hallelujah being led by the
[57:41] spirit of god it was god's organization
[57:43] it was god's government it wasn't man's
[57:45] idea that's how the church started being
[57:47] filled with the holy ghost that's how
[57:49] the church started and they walked in
[57:50] power they were hated by the world but
[57:52] they didn't care because they knew where
[57:54] they were going
[57:55] i loved that quote uh there it said you
[57:57] know this world is not our home
[57:59] we're just so journeying through
[58:01] amen that that that we would call other
[58:04] citizens amen from darkness into light
[58:07] hallelujah so this was this was their
[58:09] burden and this is how the church
[58:10] started and this and if god started his
[58:12] church that way he's gonna finish his
[58:14] church that way i mean he's gonna finish
[58:16] with the same kind of people he had in
[58:17] acts chapter two he's gonna have the
[58:18] same kind of people today
[58:21] amen there's a prophecy of the bride
[58:23] tree being restored
[58:25] hallelujah there's a whole subject in
[58:27] itself but you know the prophet would
[58:28] preach a sermon the restoration of the
[58:30] bride tree and it wasn't just to make
[58:32] people excited he was declaring
[58:34] what you saw in the bible
[58:36] of the believer is being manifested
[58:38] again today there's a restoration so
[58:40] there's what was there in the beginning
[58:42] is it's not being replaced it's being
[58:44] restored the same life the same fruits
[58:47] of the spirit the same overcoming power
[58:49] the same faith
[58:51] as in a people
[58:52] hallelujah and he would go to ezekiel
[58:54] and he'd speak about the four strangers
[58:56] of the dry bones being restored and the
[58:58] last part of that stage is when when
[59:01] when ezekiel was said to prophesy son of
[59:03] man and he prophesied that life would
[59:05] come into the bone life would come into
[59:07] the army and then brother ram said you
[59:09] know he would just say prophesy son of
[59:11] man he got all look you're excited at
[59:13] that point the reason he was is because
[59:14] he was realizing the spoken word was
[59:17] being preached that had power in it i
[59:20] mean to bring life into the church
[59:22] hallelujah
[59:23] amen so here we are living under that
[59:27] you know we get worried about the
[59:31] we shouldn't get so caught up we should
[59:33] be aware of what's going on in the world
[59:35] but that's not the main sign that the
[59:38] end is coming
[59:39] the main sign is the bride's come to her
[59:41] position
[59:42] because nothing can happen until she's
[59:44] ready and taken out hallelujah nothing
[59:47] can happen until we're ready
[59:50] amen
[59:51] hallelujah
[59:53] now
[59:54] it's amazing
[59:56] to me
[59:59] how
[1:00:00] even when prophecy is fulfilled
[1:00:04] the devil makes great effort to explain
[1:00:06] it away
[1:00:08] the ministry of jesus you know i just i
[1:00:10] just marveling to myself last night
[1:00:12] thinking about this there were roman
[1:00:14] soldiers that were standing guarding
[1:00:16] jesus's tomb
[1:00:18] they were there for three days
[1:00:21] no nothing went happening nothing was
[1:00:23] going on there was a guard there change
[1:00:25] of century every whatever time the the
[1:00:27] tomb was sealed
[1:00:28] but then the angel lord descended
[1:00:31] and when he descended it says there was
[1:00:33] a great earthquake
[1:00:34] now to me that great earthquake wouldn't
[1:00:36] have just been felt by the gods it was a
[1:00:37] great earthquake
[1:00:39] if maybe it would have
[1:00:40] just me it would have woken up the chief
[1:00:42] priests
[1:00:43] had woken up the high priest well it
[1:00:45] would have woken up the sanhedrin maybe
[1:00:47] they were asleep in their beds in their
[1:00:49] finery thinking that they had gotten rid
[1:00:50] of this jesus but then there was this
[1:00:52] earthquake and they woke up
[1:00:54] and then shortly up so and then if we
[1:00:56] just go into those soldiers
[1:00:59] it says their great fear came upon them
[1:01:01] and they fell down as dead men this was
[1:01:04] the experience they had so they saw an
[1:01:06] angel come down a mighty angel come down
[1:01:09] they're experiencing a great earthquake
[1:01:11] they are filled with fear
[1:01:13] and then they fall down as dead men and
[1:01:15] then they run for their lives
[1:01:17] this was not a calm experience
[1:01:20] this would have been a very emotionally
[1:01:22] traumatic engraved in their minds
[1:01:24] forever kind of experience
[1:01:26] and then so
[1:01:28] just to dramatize a bit you know there's
[1:01:31] a chief priest he feels a great
[1:01:33] earthquake
[1:01:34] maybe he just you know
[1:01:36] oh well that's unusual then he rolls
[1:01:38] over goes back to sleep
[1:01:40] and next few minutes after is a knock on
[1:01:42] his door
[1:01:43] master rabbi there's some soldiers to
[1:01:46] see you
[1:01:47] you know and then here's these you know
[1:01:48] because it says the century of the watch
[1:01:50] came
[1:01:51] and they would have run in there
[1:01:53] and they would have reported what had
[1:01:54] happened this wasn't just another day
[1:01:56] this wasn't just another guy duty they
[1:01:58] had seen something they'd never
[1:02:00] experienced before and they'd never
[1:02:01] experience again
[1:02:02] hallelujah and so they would have run in
[1:02:04] there distressed
[1:02:06] trouble maybe all the color had gone
[1:02:08] from their faces they fell down as dead
[1:02:10] men
[1:02:11] and then so they begin to tell him about
[1:02:13] the events of the mighty angel come down
[1:02:15] there's a great earthquake and maybe in
[1:02:17] his mind he thought oh that's what woke
[1:02:19] me up
[1:02:21] so he knew what they were talking about
[1:02:23] and then and then you know they'd say
[1:02:24] well this angel came down the great tear
[1:02:26] of phil was so even now we're shaking in
[1:02:28] our boots from what happened to us and
[1:02:30] we fell down as dead men we ran here to
[1:02:32] tell you what happened and then he just
[1:02:33] said
[1:02:34] take this money
[1:02:37] tell everyone
[1:02:38] that the disciple stole his body
[1:02:41] and
[1:02:42] and he said if anyone you know says
[1:02:44] anything about it we'll we'll back you
[1:02:46] up we'll preserve your lives and it said
[1:02:48] that that was noise abroad
[1:02:50] you know from that day
[1:02:52] how could you live with that
[1:02:54] how could you ever live
[1:02:57] with that experience
[1:02:59] and television i know that the disciples
[1:03:01] stole his body
[1:03:02] what happened there in judea with this
[1:03:05] oh no the disciples stole his body and
[1:03:07] the coins are rattling in your pocket
[1:03:10] so the devil will go into great
[1:03:12] so he explained away he explained away
[1:03:15] the ministry of our lord
[1:03:17] he'll explain away prophecy being
[1:03:19] fulfilled today
[1:03:21] he will do it
[1:03:23] even you know the devil even uh is is so
[1:03:26] busy
[1:03:28] that that before the truth ever gets to
[1:03:30] a place
[1:03:31] there'll be a bad name associated with
[1:03:33] it before it gets there
[1:03:34] the apostle paul would end up in rome
[1:03:37] and
[1:03:38] and the jews would come to him and say
[1:03:40] we want to know this is an acts 28 we
[1:03:42] want to know what you think about this
[1:03:44] sect that's spread everywhere we know
[1:03:46] that everywhere it's spoken against
[1:03:49] so the truth haven't even got to the
[1:03:50] romans to the to the jews in rome
[1:03:52] but yet already a bad name had been
[1:03:55] associated what do you what do you think
[1:03:56] of this cult what do you think of this
[1:03:58] movement it's spoken everywhere against
[1:04:01] so the devil will do this kind of thing
[1:04:02] but i'll say but to the elect
[1:04:05] all that won't matter
[1:04:07] but to the elect amen that won't matter
[1:04:10] that won't change
[1:04:11] amen god fulfilling it in their lives
[1:04:15] amen that's what i said you know we've
[1:04:18] had
[1:04:19] we've had economic problems before
[1:04:22] we've had pandemics before don't don't
[1:04:24] let it harden us against the fulfillment
[1:04:27] of prophecy
[1:04:28] you know we don't want to be caught up
[1:04:31] in that bracket
[1:04:33] because you see here
[1:04:35] this servant that we read about and i'll
[1:04:37] and i'll come to revelations 10 soon the
[1:04:39] servant we read about he said in his
[1:04:41] heart the lord delays his coming so he
[1:04:43] didn't he didn't he didn't proclaim it
[1:04:45] out loud he just began to think
[1:04:48] he's he's lingering
[1:04:50] there's a delay i thought he would have
[1:04:51] come back by now and you know you see it
[1:04:54] the danger and the delay is that the
[1:04:56] devil gets in and tries to get the
[1:04:58] people off the course from what they
[1:04:59] started that's why how we start is how
[1:05:01] we should finish
[1:05:03] how we start is how we should continue
[1:05:05] well how do you start in your first love
[1:05:07] god's everything a total abandonment to
[1:05:10] god come what may i love him i want
[1:05:13] everyone to come in he's the greatest
[1:05:14] thing there was you know and but the
[1:05:17] devil tries to put discouragement and
[1:05:19] fear and disappointment in our way that
[1:05:21] we won't continue how we started but the
[1:05:24] holy ghost is here to take all that out
[1:05:26] of us
[1:05:27] right remember when the enemy came
[1:05:29] against the apostles and you know they
[1:05:31] were dragged before the sanhedrin and
[1:05:33] they were told don't preach in his name
[1:05:35] anymore and i think they were beaten i
[1:05:36] think it's more than one occasion but
[1:05:40] on one occasion they just went and they
[1:05:41] had a prayer meeting
[1:05:43] and god filled them and shook the place
[1:05:45] and filled them with boldness to
[1:05:46] overcome what the devil tried to put
[1:05:48] upon them
[1:05:49] because he wanted to disable their faith
[1:05:51] i say god remember god is here to enable
[1:05:53] us
[1:05:54] this is not us just trying to be a
[1:05:56] believer no no all of heaven's behind
[1:05:57] you
[1:05:58] irrespective of how you feel about
[1:06:00] yourself all of heaven is backing you up
[1:06:03] we're ambassadors for christ
[1:06:05] an ambassador speaks for their nation
[1:06:08] all of that nation is behind them you
[1:06:10] think when the ambassador of the united
[1:06:11] states goes to a country all over all of
[1:06:14] the army the equipment the weapons the
[1:06:17] military force of america is behind that
[1:06:19] person
[1:06:20] that's just a natural army how about the
[1:06:22] whole host of heaven
[1:06:24] amen is behind you that's why when
[1:06:26] elijah said about you know you know
[1:06:28] gehazi his servant went out saw the
[1:06:30] syrians and kept around the you know
[1:06:32] city he yo he begin to panic
[1:06:34] you know he runs in you know we're going
[1:06:36] to die
[1:06:36] we can't get out they're going to get us
[1:06:38] you know and then no doubt elisha
[1:06:40] because he knew that heaven was backing
[1:06:42] him up he knew he was an ambassador for
[1:06:44] heavens in an unseen realm
[1:06:46] god's armies were around him so he just
[1:06:48] said lord open his eyes he didn't pray
[1:06:51] that the angels would come they were
[1:06:53] already there the angels were already
[1:06:54] the army was already around right but
[1:06:57] but gehazi's eyes had to come open to
[1:06:59] realize they already were there
[1:07:02] i prayed this morning may our eyes come
[1:07:04] open
[1:07:05] that we wouldn't look at the natural
[1:07:07] things of the world but we'd realize
[1:07:08] actually i'm
[1:07:10] the the greatest military force known to
[1:07:12] man or known to hell
[1:07:15] is actually around me
[1:07:17] hallelujah
[1:07:18] remember gehazi was full of fear he was
[1:07:20] worried he was troubled but the angels
[1:07:22] were still around him
[1:07:24] hallelujah
[1:07:26] amen
[1:07:28] praise the lord so this so the servant
[1:07:30] began to say in his heart the lord
[1:07:33] delays his coming now well we'll just go
[1:07:35] back to that soon but you see it's the
[1:07:37] delay
[1:07:38] where where the devil tries to derail us
[1:07:40] from where we're going and you can see
[1:07:41] that in the scripture
[1:07:43] you know where where the apostle paul
[1:07:45] has to address something basically in
[1:07:47] every church
[1:07:48] in the corinthian church i mean they had
[1:07:51] signs and wonders following but they
[1:07:52] begin to bring in a bit of respect of
[1:07:54] persons and they allowed sin to be in
[1:07:56] the church and paul says you know it's
[1:07:58] even things that the gentiles don't do
[1:08:00] you're allowing
[1:08:02] you know how that man was sleeping
[1:08:03] basically with us coming adultery with
[1:08:05] his mother-in-law or something
[1:08:07] you know or stepmother-in-law whatever
[1:08:09] it was but but because of a respected
[1:08:10] person's things they just allowed the
[1:08:12] sin
[1:08:13] and so the devil brought that into to
[1:08:15] derail them and then they begin to form
[1:08:17] clicks saying well some say they're of
[1:08:19] paul some say they're apollo some say
[1:08:20] they're of christ you know this is the
[1:08:23] ministry i like to follow so basically
[1:08:25] it's whatever ministry there christ well
[1:08:27] i just read the bible i don't go to
[1:08:29] church i listen to tapes that's christ
[1:08:31] bring it into today i do this so it was
[1:08:33] factions being formed they didn't start
[1:08:35] that way
[1:08:37] but the devil tried to because of the
[1:08:39] delay
[1:08:40] right he tried to derail them the
[1:08:43] galatian church did not start legalistic
[1:08:46] they started in the power of god when
[1:08:48] the apostle paul asked the simple
[1:08:49] question he said he said did the spirit
[1:08:51] come to you
[1:08:52] by keeping the law or hearing by you
[1:08:55] know faith cometh by hearing
[1:08:58] so they didn't start that way but
[1:08:59] because of the delay people we when we
[1:09:01] lose our focus that's when a winner when
[1:09:04] a deviation of a walk can come in
[1:09:07] that's why we should finish how we start
[1:09:10] and we should continue how we start
[1:09:12] hallelujah and so so the apostle paul
[1:09:15] but remember they were believers
[1:09:17] the galatians were real believers the
[1:09:19] corinthians were real believers right
[1:09:21] the thessalonians were worried he said
[1:09:23] don't be you know because they were all
[1:09:25] troubled because people had been writing
[1:09:26] war bringing out new doctrines saying
[1:09:28] well you know the resurrection's past
[1:09:30] this has happened whatever you know to
[1:09:32] overthrow the faith of some
[1:09:34] but you know so there was fear
[1:09:36] controlling them but the apostle paul
[1:09:39] addressed it
[1:09:40] he says don't be troubled by by by
[1:09:43] literal by spirit let's just read it
[1:09:45] second thessalonians let's just read
[1:09:46] this book because i feel like i'm not
[1:09:47] quite
[1:09:49] getting there but it's very
[1:10:00] now so second thessalonians 2 and 1
[1:10:03] now we beseech you brethren by the
[1:10:05] coming of our lord jesus christ and by
[1:10:07] our gathering together unto him that ye
[1:10:09] be not soon shaken in mind
[1:10:12] or be troubled neither by spirit nor by
[1:10:15] word nor by letter as from us as that
[1:10:18] day of christ is at hand and he begins
[1:10:20] to talk about the um mystery of iniquity
[1:10:23] working and the antichrist all those
[1:10:26] things right but he says don't be
[1:10:27] troubled by these things so they were
[1:10:29] living under a fear they were troubled
[1:10:32] what was what was the purpose of that to
[1:10:34] try and derail their walk are you
[1:10:36] following me
[1:10:37] right so so
[1:10:40] this is what happens in the delay
[1:10:42] but the lord allows these things to
[1:10:44] happen because he wants to test our
[1:10:45] faith
[1:10:46] he wants to give us victory he wants to
[1:10:48] give us reasons to worship him more he
[1:10:51] wants to give us reasons to praise him
[1:10:52] more that's why he allows the devil to
[1:10:54] come in like this that we can praise him
[1:10:56] all because you know if you've never
[1:10:58] been healed by god you can't worship him
[1:11:00] as healer if you've never been saved you
[1:11:02] can't worship him with savior you can
[1:11:03] know he's to save you in your head but
[1:11:05] when you realize
[1:11:06] i was lost but now i'm found i was blind
[1:11:08] but now i see i was bound now i'm loosed
[1:11:10] you can worship him you can praise his
[1:11:12] great name i mean every revelation he
[1:11:14] pours in you can wash him because he
[1:11:16] pours in that revelation hallelujah so
[1:11:18] the devil you know the devil doesn't win
[1:11:22] everything the devil is allowed to do
[1:11:24] turns into praise to god that's how it
[1:11:26] should be it shouldn't make us bitter it
[1:11:28] should just make us praise god more
[1:11:30] hallelujah everything should just just
[1:11:32] produce a worship
[1:11:34] out of our lives
[1:11:36] hallelujah
[1:11:37] you say well i don't know how to worship
[1:11:39] on this one just praise him
[1:11:41] give him glory
[1:11:42] hallelujah
[1:11:44] and one day you'll see
[1:11:46] but everything sickness comes in
[1:11:47] financial trouble whatever it is it's
[1:11:49] that god would get praise
[1:11:52] hallelujah amen so we can just praise
[1:11:55] the lord amen amen so there was so in
[1:11:58] the delay there is danger
[1:12:01] but that danger should produce praise
[1:12:04] so i'm not trying to you know you got to
[1:12:06] twist it round i'm going through this
[1:12:08] real big battle it's all right wait till
[1:12:11] you get to the other side i just
[1:12:12] actually just start praising him now
[1:12:15] praise him praise him now not just not
[1:12:17] just after the victory praise him in the
[1:12:18] victory i mean praise him in the trial
[1:12:21] hallelujah
[1:12:22] amen to change change your whole
[1:12:23] thinking now so so this this servant
[1:12:27] he he said in his heart the lord
[1:12:29] delayeth his coming
[1:12:31] and then
[1:12:33] he shall it says in verse 49 and shall
[1:12:35] begin to smite his fellow servants
[1:12:38] and to eat and drink with the drunken
[1:12:42] so we know this is a parable right so
[1:12:44] he's saying that now because because it
[1:12:46] appears that the lord delays is coming
[1:12:48] but the reason he delays is coming is
[1:12:50] that all of god's children must come in
[1:12:52] amen
[1:12:53] amen he could have come i know how many
[1:12:56] years ago we know all the scriptures
[1:12:57] here and everything i mean all the
[1:12:58] prophecies here but he he it's actually
[1:13:01] the mercy of god that there is a delay
[1:13:04] hallelujah
[1:13:07] praise the lord
[1:13:08] and so
[1:13:09] but the thing is because there appears
[1:13:10] to be a delayed this evil servant it
[1:13:12] says actually now he says well he's
[1:13:14] delaying his coming so the diligency
[1:13:17] that he started with begins to wane
[1:13:20] because he thinks now he's got time
[1:13:22] and when he thinks he's got time his
[1:13:24] focus begins to shift
[1:13:26] his
[1:13:27] his focus went from serving the lord out
[1:13:29] of a pure heart to now he begins to
[1:13:32] smite his fellow servants so in in
[1:13:34] today's language he now
[1:13:37] where initially he could look past the
[1:13:40] faults of his fellow servants
[1:13:42] right because of his love and diligence
[1:13:44] serving god out of a pure heart he
[1:13:46] couldn't look beyond their troubles no
[1:13:48] more then he'd begin to smite them then
[1:13:50] he got mad at them then he wouldn't
[1:13:51] forgive them then he would the spread
[1:13:53] gossip around murder their character
[1:13:56] that smiting some smiting a fellow
[1:13:58] servant dragging down this church
[1:14:00] dragging down this ministry dragging
[1:14:01] down this person dragging down an office
[1:14:03] in the church whatever it is disrespect
[1:14:05] you know spreading an attitude that is
[1:14:08] smiting a fellow servant
[1:14:10] we don't want to be smiters or fellow
[1:14:12] servants we're here to smite the devil
[1:14:15] amen push the battle and smite the devil
[1:14:17] that's why we're here so we don't we
[1:14:18] ever want to lose our focus if your
[1:14:20] focus is everyone else's problems
[1:14:23] then i'd say you've actually been
[1:14:25] derailed
[1:14:26] you've actually that the delay the
[1:14:28] danger and the delay has actually
[1:14:30] distracted you
[1:14:33] but you can get back on the road
[1:14:35] hallelujah
[1:14:36] amen but yeah like the scripture says
[1:14:38] that we are not ignorant of satan's
[1:14:39] devices
[1:14:40] so this is one of his devices so so this
[1:14:43] evil servant
[1:14:44] begins to smite his fellow servants
[1:14:48] as i've said and to eat and drink with
[1:14:51] the drunken now we know in the bible
[1:14:54] there as we know there's literal
[1:14:55] drunkenness
[1:14:56] right
[1:14:57] but there's also a spiritual drunkenness
[1:15:01] now if we go to revelation i believe at
[1:15:03] 17
[1:15:05] we'll see that there is
[1:15:09] well i'll show you this world is drunk
[1:15:14] if we go to revelation 17
[1:15:16] and we're going to just read verses
[1:15:19] 1
[1:15:21] and we're going to go down to verse
[1:15:24] 6.
[1:15:27] and there came one of the seven angels
[1:15:29] which had the seven vials and talked
[1:15:31] with me saying unto me come hither i'll
[1:15:34] show thee the judgment of the great
[1:15:35] that sitteth upon many waters now
[1:15:37] we know the book of revelation is a
[1:15:39] symbolic book
[1:15:40] it's a book of symbols the symbols
[1:15:42] actually interpret themselves now
[1:15:44] when it speaks of a woman in the bible
[1:15:46] it speaks of a church
[1:15:48] and there's many waters as people's
[1:15:49] multitudes nations and tongues okay and
[1:15:53] with whom the kings of the earth have
[1:15:54] committed fornication and the
[1:15:56] inhabitants of the earth have been made
[1:15:58] drunk with the wine of her fornication
[1:16:01] so
[1:16:03] so he carried me away in the spirit into
[1:16:05] the wilderness i saw a woman sit upon a
[1:16:07] scarlet colored beast full of names of
[1:16:09] blasphemy having seven heads and ten
[1:16:12] horns and the woman was arrayed in
[1:16:13] purple and scarlet color and decked with
[1:16:15] gold and precious jewels and pearls and
[1:16:18] having a golden cup in her hand full of
[1:16:20] abominations and filthiness of her
[1:16:22] fornication and upon her name was
[1:16:24] written i mean upon a forehead i was
[1:16:26] written
[1:16:27] was a name written mystery babylon the
[1:16:29] great the mother of harlots the
[1:16:30] abominations of the earth and i saw the
[1:16:33] woman drunk with the blood of the saints
[1:16:34] and with the blood of the martyrs of
[1:16:36] jesus and when i saw her i wandered with
[1:16:39] great admiration and the angel said unto
[1:16:42] me wherefore does thou marvel i will
[1:16:43] tell you the mystery of the woman and
[1:16:45] the beast and the carrot that carries
[1:16:47] her carryeth her which had the seven
[1:16:49] heads and ten horns
[1:16:52] the beast which our source was and is
[1:16:54] not and shall ascend out of the
[1:16:55] bomberless pit and go into perdition and
[1:16:57] they that dwell on the earth shall
[1:16:59] wander whose names were not written in
[1:17:01] the book of life and the foundation of
[1:17:02] the world when they behold the beast
[1:17:04] that was and is
[1:17:07] and is not and yet is now we're just
[1:17:09] going to finish there but you can read
[1:17:11] the whole thing but but this is a power
[1:17:13] remember we're actually all cow brothers
[1:17:15] we're actually all sisters
[1:17:17] because we're all women in the bible
[1:17:18] we're a church
[1:17:19] right so this church has actually power
[1:17:22] to actually cause the kings of the earth
[1:17:25] to commit fornication with it now this
[1:17:26] is spiritual matters right and the whole
[1:17:29] world becomes drunk with the one of her
[1:17:31] fornication now we won't read it but but
[1:17:33] if if we continue on in revelations 18
[1:17:36] is the judgment of this great hall we
[1:17:37] know this is the catholic system and
[1:17:39] she's a mother of harlots the
[1:17:40] denominations are the daughters of the
[1:17:43] catholic church because they live they
[1:17:44] don't live pure to the word
[1:17:46] they live by their creeds they love
[1:17:49] their creeds more than the bible
[1:17:51] right so but but this power has made so
[1:17:54] it's not the people in the churches it's
[1:17:55] the system that binds them
[1:17:57] it's the system that's bad it's not the
[1:17:59] people right many good genuine people in
[1:18:01] there but it's the system that holds
[1:18:03] them down it's that religious spirit
[1:18:04] that holds them down but you see it's
[1:18:06] actually made this system has made the
[1:18:08] world drunk
[1:18:10] and in revelations 18 there's a judgment
[1:18:12] of the great and there's one where
[1:18:14] where where she's burnt with fire and
[1:18:16] then there's a second one where she's
[1:18:18] cast like a millstone into the water
[1:18:21] there's actually two babylons we know
[1:18:22] that don't we two mystery babylons one
[1:18:24] is rome
[1:18:25] and one is los angeles
[1:18:27] so one is burnt with fire the russians
[1:18:29] are going to drop a bomb on it brother
[1:18:31] brown says that there'll be some fanatic
[1:18:33] drunk russian will push a button and
[1:18:34] then there will go
[1:18:36] right it'll be destroyed but then the
[1:18:38] los angeles is going to slip into the
[1:18:39] sea
[1:18:40] as it has been prophesied
[1:18:42] so so
[1:18:44] because many people say well how's the
[1:18:45] world drunk
[1:18:47] if people aren't even religious
[1:18:49] well it's because there's two babylons
[1:18:51] there's the religious babylon and
[1:18:52] there's the entertainment world babylon
[1:18:55] that's why so people are drunk
[1:18:58] by these two systems
[1:19:01] and so this is what it means by this
[1:19:02] evil servant being able to eat and drink
[1:19:05] with the drunken
[1:19:06] so they get under the influence of that
[1:19:09] spirit
[1:19:10] why because the lord they said in their
[1:19:12] heart the lord the lasers coming
[1:19:14] so they instead of being focused on what
[1:19:16] they're here to do
[1:19:18] they get sidetracked begin to be
[1:19:20] critical of everyone
[1:19:22] and then they start and then they begin
[1:19:24] to feed off the wrong things
[1:19:26] because remember everything has a spirit
[1:19:28] and everything has an intent
[1:19:30] just like i heard brother kaido digs he
[1:19:32] was um he was he was speaking to some
[1:19:34] youth and he's talking about samson and
[1:19:36] delilah and you know samson would say um
[1:19:39] sorry delilah would say to samson but
[1:19:41] you love me tell me where your strength
[1:19:43] is
[1:19:44] you say you love me why won't you tell
[1:19:45] me your secret and basically delilah's
[1:19:47] saying to samson tell me how i can
[1:19:49] destroy you if you really love me tell
[1:19:51] me how i can destroy you that's what
[1:19:53] she's saying so the intent of her
[1:19:55] question was tell me how i can kill you
[1:19:58] i want to get paid for this
[1:20:00] and that's what the devil does he'll
[1:20:01] project something out there on social
[1:20:03] media whatever it is
[1:20:04] and but there's an intent behind what
[1:20:07] he's doing just like music there's
[1:20:09] intent behind the music
[1:20:11] right different genres have different
[1:20:13] spirits country western music has
[1:20:15] depression pop and stuff has lust rap
[1:20:17] has murder and anger all those different
[1:20:19] genres they have different spirits so
[1:20:21] there's an intent behind the music
[1:20:23] there's an intent behind stuff that's
[1:20:25] pushed down our throats on social media
[1:20:27] different things on youtube you know
[1:20:29] there's good in those platforms but
[1:20:31] don't get drunk on the evil
[1:20:34] is it taking you from god is it bringing
[1:20:36] you closer to god does it bring god into
[1:20:38] your house or does it bring the devil
[1:20:39] into your house i want god in my house
[1:20:42] that's why i love living over the street
[1:20:44] here because god visited us so many
[1:20:45] times
[1:20:46] that's what made it home
[1:20:48] hallelujah
[1:20:50] and that's what cal man you know what i
[1:20:51] mean but but but that's what makes home
[1:20:53] special
[1:20:54] of course it is the people my wonderful
[1:20:56] family but it's when god comes in
[1:20:58] because we want a place where he feels
[1:21:00] welcome he can come and have a break
[1:21:02] hallelujah amen so so this world is
[1:21:06] drunk
[1:21:08] amen
[1:21:10] it is staggering under an
[1:21:12] intoxication
[1:21:14] now
[1:21:15] it's amazing well
[1:21:17] now if we look at natural drunkenness
[1:21:19] if i have a
[1:21:20] there are some there are many things
[1:21:23] that alcohol does to the body
[1:21:26] right
[1:21:27] many things
[1:21:28] one is
[1:21:30] you can't so so here's a few physical
[1:21:32] effects
[1:21:33] you can't see straight
[1:21:36] you can't see straight if you're drunk
[1:21:37] trust me i've been there
[1:21:39] been there done that wish i never did
[1:21:41] but hey god richard mercy that's the
[1:21:43] main thing
[1:21:44] i'm not that guy anymore praise the lord
[1:21:46] but so you can't see straight
[1:21:48] your focus is all out
[1:21:50] amen now now keep in mind the spiritual
[1:21:53] application right so when you're sober
[1:21:55] minded when you have the mind of christ
[1:21:57] you can see straight you can see things
[1:21:59] for what they are your vision is not
[1:22:01] distorted it's not blurred you know your
[1:22:04] picture doesn't move like this now you
[1:22:06] can see straight
[1:22:07] right so so if your
[1:22:10] people are drunk with the world under
[1:22:12] intoxication of the spirit of this world
[1:22:14] their vision gets blurry
[1:22:16] i could say they actually can lose their
[1:22:17] vision
[1:22:18] you know where there is a where no
[1:22:20] vision is a people perish
[1:22:23] amen the challenge you know the
[1:22:25] challenge can be to run this race with
[1:22:27] patience that's what the apostle paul
[1:22:28] said this is not a sprint this is not a
[1:22:31] sub 10 second dash
[1:22:33] this is a marathon
[1:22:35] but the lord has made us to run this
[1:22:36] marathon he's built you to do it
[1:22:40] amen
[1:22:42] so your vision gets bl blurry
[1:22:46] someone who's drunk can't walk straight
[1:22:49] they stagger
[1:22:51] back and forth that's why i used to be a
[1:22:53] test i know but still is if people are
[1:22:54] pulled over by the cops they say now
[1:22:56] walk down this line
[1:22:58] and they do but the line keeps moving
[1:23:01] so what happens is if you're sober
[1:23:03] minded you can walk straight in the
[1:23:05] middle of the road of the word
[1:23:07] right neither legalism
[1:23:10] neither liberalism but divine love is
[1:23:12] driving you
[1:23:13] right you walk straight down
[1:23:16] amen so you don't try and justify
[1:23:18] yourself saying you're better than the
[1:23:19] next person and you don't say well who
[1:23:21] cares because it's all grace don't turn
[1:23:22] grace into disgrace amen but it's divine
[1:23:25] love motivates your christian walk so
[1:23:27] it's not thou shalt not you know thou
[1:23:29] shalt not do this no because i love him
[1:23:32] i want to please him
[1:23:34] amen
[1:23:37] so you can't walk straight your speech
[1:23:39] becomes slurred
[1:23:42] amen
[1:23:43] some of you know exactly what i'm
[1:23:45] talking about you can't speak normally
[1:23:47] you jumble your words they slur so you
[1:23:50] can't speak like the word would speak
[1:23:54] right it becomes incoherent people can
[1:23:56] try and put scriptures and quotes
[1:23:58] together to try and fight a battle but
[1:24:00] if they're drunk and they just slur and
[1:24:01] mix and it makes no to them it makes
[1:24:03] sense
[1:24:05] who's that who was ever back then what
[1:24:07] you're saying you make perfect sense and
[1:24:09] someone says you made no sense
[1:24:11] no in my heart i was making perfect
[1:24:13] sense no what is that your speech is
[1:24:15] slurred
[1:24:17] right it's not actually the mind of
[1:24:18] christ speaking the word forth it's
[1:24:20] carnality and just your because your
[1:24:22] vision is slurred you can't walk
[1:24:23] straight i mean i mean your speech is
[1:24:25] slurred your vision is blurred you can't
[1:24:26] walk straight
[1:24:28] amen
[1:24:30] we want to speak
[1:24:31] because remember the the voice of god is
[1:24:34] in the bride
[1:24:36] the voice of god is in the bride again
[1:24:38] amen not just a preacher but lived
[1:24:41] voices where the word puts on flesh in
[1:24:43] you and i
[1:24:45] brother braham said that the world will
[1:24:47] hear direct
[1:24:48] through the bride as it did at pentecost
[1:24:51] what was that god filling a people
[1:24:53] speaking his word forth that's why this
[1:24:56] word must become one with you i mean
[1:24:58] it's not just pushing play listening to
[1:25:00] a message no that word message must
[1:25:01] become flesh where you become the
[1:25:04] manifestation of the message that's the
[1:25:06] purpose of it where you become the
[1:25:07] manifestation of the word amen where you
[1:25:10] become a lived voice that's why god
[1:25:11] wants to empty us of the world and fill
[1:25:13] us with himself that you can shake this
[1:25:15] world
[1:25:16] amen that's what god wants to do that's
[1:25:18] our calling
[1:25:20] you say well i may not be a very good
[1:25:21] witness don't worry about that
[1:25:23] you just live true and love the lord
[1:25:27] amen remember the lord would say well
[1:25:29] done my good and faithful servant he
[1:25:31] didn't say well done
[1:25:33] my good and successful as you thought
[1:25:36] you'd be successful servant
[1:25:38] well done my good and faithful
[1:25:40] [Music]
[1:25:42] amen
[1:25:43] you know i'm glad that we are not called
[1:25:45] to do what some of the prophets did in
[1:25:47] the bible one had to land aside so many
[1:25:49] days and the other side so many days i
[1:25:51] think it was ezekiel or one of the
[1:25:53] prophets you know the lord actually
[1:25:55] wanted him to take um flour and stuff
[1:25:58] and make cakes with human dung
[1:26:00] as a physical representation of what he
[1:26:02] thought of the people god was saying
[1:26:03] about the people and ezekiel said this
[1:26:05] is too much i can't do it so he says
[1:26:07] okay just just use animal dung instead
[1:26:09] one of the prophets had to walk naked
[1:26:11] through the street all these different
[1:26:12] kind of things they were assigned a
[1:26:14] living sign to the world
[1:26:16] i'm glad we don't have to do those
[1:26:17] things
[1:26:18] right but we're still a living sign
[1:26:20] we're still a living voice they their
[1:26:22] their lives and what they did preach to
[1:26:24] the world
[1:26:25] amen and we are here to be lived voices
[1:26:28] and we'll get into that soon
[1:26:30] amen now
[1:26:32] when
[1:26:33] when someone is drunk
[1:26:35] they're not so sensitive
[1:26:37] to the cold like they used to be
[1:26:40] their feeling becomes numb
[1:26:43] they're not as sensitive so so if
[1:26:45] they're sober they walk out and it's
[1:26:46] cold they'll say no it's too cold to
[1:26:47] need a jacket
[1:26:49] same person same condition as drunk go
[1:26:51] out i'm fine
[1:26:53] so the atmosphere of the world
[1:26:56] doesn't bother a person who's drunk when
[1:26:59] it when it's cold you're following me
[1:27:01] right says the same thing in the
[1:27:02] spiritual climate someone who's drunk
[1:27:04] with the world the spiritual climate of
[1:27:07] the world does not affect them like if
[1:27:08] they are sober-minded
[1:27:12] we do not want to become numb
[1:27:14] to this world
[1:27:15] we don't want to become different know
[1:27:17] it's amazing i think it's in hosea i
[1:27:18] don't have it in my notes but the lord
[1:27:20] says to hosea i've sent the sword to
[1:27:23] speaking about israel i sent the sword
[1:27:25] to this city
[1:27:27] and i've sent rain on this right one and
[1:27:29] withheld it from this city i've seen to
[1:27:31] famine here not to this one but he says
[1:27:33] yet my people will not return to me
[1:27:37] so all of those things did not stir the
[1:27:39] people up
[1:27:41] for them to come to the right senses and
[1:27:42] say hey we should something's wrong
[1:27:45] something spiritually wrong in our lives
[1:27:48] we need to return to the lord so he says
[1:27:50] no those things actually don't grip a
[1:27:52] people to wake them up
[1:27:54] it takes the word of god it takes the
[1:27:56] anointing of this message to wake up
[1:27:59] people up that don't realize you're at
[1:28:00] the end but don't despair there's a way
[1:28:03] out of here which is a rapture i've gone
[1:28:05] to prepare a place for you and if i come
[1:28:07] again receive you unto myself where i am
[1:28:09] you shall be also so that's not you know
[1:28:11] what i love about the parable of the
[1:28:12] wedding feast
[1:28:14] there's three calls go out
[1:28:16] the first two the people make excuses
[1:28:18] you know i bought some land
[1:28:21] i married a wife just well okay you
[1:28:23] bought some land it'll be there when you
[1:28:24] get back i married a wife just bring her
[1:28:26] with i've got some oxen i haven't tried
[1:28:29] them don't you see what yeah was it 12
[1:28:31] year old cause a lot of oxen wouldn't
[1:28:32] you go inspect them before you you know
[1:28:35] they'll be there when you get back
[1:28:37] you know
[1:28:38] god makes it in such a way there's no
[1:28:40] excuse not to come but yet they still
[1:28:42] turn him down so he just says to his
[1:28:44] servants get the good and the bad
[1:28:47] so i'm glad that you know when he sit
[1:28:49] down the bad i'm like i can come
[1:28:52] hallelujah hallelujah i can come
[1:28:55] and then but but the nice thing is you
[1:28:57] can be bad
[1:28:58] so so who's in that range of good and
[1:29:00] bad
[1:29:03] wow where's the angels take off your
[1:29:05] angels wings for a second we're all
[1:29:07] human
[1:29:08] right
[1:29:10] i'm in that bracket
[1:29:12] i wasn't good i was wretched and
[1:29:14] horrible i was in the bad basic get the
[1:29:16] good and the bad i fit i fit the
[1:29:18] criteria
[1:29:19] i got my invitation so i came
[1:29:22] hallelujah but then when you come to the
[1:29:23] door which is christ says hold on i'm
[1:29:26] going to wash your feet
[1:29:27] wash all the muck of the world off you
[1:29:29] amen holy wash all the muck of the world
[1:29:31] off you and then i'm going to anoint you
[1:29:34] that the stench of your old life is gone
[1:29:36] you know what i love i maybe i shouldn't
[1:29:38] go into it but you know god can make it
[1:29:40] in such a way that your accuser can be
[1:29:43] living right next to you but he is
[1:29:45] silenced
[1:29:46] amen the woman who was caught in
[1:29:48] adultery
[1:29:49] her accusers brought her before the
[1:29:52] before the lord says we've caught her in
[1:29:54] the very act
[1:29:56] where was the man
[1:29:57] if they were really scripturally right
[1:29:59] they would have brought both of them
[1:30:01] and then the lord jesus ignores no she's
[1:30:03] she knows she's guilty
[1:30:05] she was there when it happened
[1:30:08] she knows she's worthy of death
[1:30:10] but then yet the lord he doesn't answer
[1:30:12] them he just begins to ride in the sand
[1:30:14] and he just says then without sin let
[1:30:16] him cast the first stone
[1:30:19] so now
[1:30:20] from the elders to the youngest their
[1:30:21] conscious gets a hold of them and they
[1:30:23] know what they have done they were going
[1:30:25] to drop their stones
[1:30:26] and they walk away
[1:30:28] and then the lord says woman where are
[1:30:30] your accusers it says there's none lord
[1:30:32] he says neither do i condemn thee go and
[1:30:34] sin no more now the devil if he was
[1:30:36] honest
[1:30:37] he would he would admit he's a liar
[1:30:40] he's a murderer he's full of pride he's
[1:30:43] arrogant he's wicked
[1:30:46] if he was honest
[1:30:48] he's not honest but if he was honest his
[1:30:51] conscience would actually grip him and
[1:30:52] say
[1:30:53] yeah i did it
[1:30:55] i did it
[1:30:57] but now you think about that woman
[1:31:00] those those priests knew her address
[1:31:03] they knew where she lived
[1:31:04] maybe they're in the same village or
[1:31:06] town she was in
[1:31:07] and so the next day
[1:31:09] she goes walking along
[1:31:12] doing her thing
[1:31:14] maybe comes across one of those ones who
[1:31:16] wanted her stoned
[1:31:18] in this silence
[1:31:20] why because the lord
[1:31:23] had had had given her a pardon
[1:31:27] but those priests and pharisees didn't
[1:31:29] get the same pardon
[1:31:31] and they could maybe try and bring up
[1:31:33] the same accusation
[1:31:34] but she said hold on
[1:31:37] hold on
[1:31:38] your own conscience convicted you and
[1:31:40] you walked away
[1:31:42] you did not receive the same pardoning
[1:31:44] grace i did
[1:31:46] their voices were silenced yet they were
[1:31:48] walking around where she lived
[1:31:51] you know we're going to tell the devil
[1:31:53] to shut up
[1:31:54] we're going to tell him
[1:31:56] you have no right to hold my past
[1:31:58] against me
[1:31:59] i receive pardoning grace where's yours
[1:32:03] he ain't got none he can't get any
[1:32:07] amen maybe i'll bring that out some
[1:32:09] other time i was just thinking about
[1:32:10] that because you know rahab's accusers
[1:32:12] or rahabs the men that rahab slept with
[1:32:15] before jericho fell they all died when
[1:32:17] the walls came down
[1:32:19] right so there was no physical evidence
[1:32:22] that she had her former life
[1:32:24] that was under the blood of bulls and
[1:32:25] goats but under the blood of jesus
[1:32:27] christ if i put it this way i hope it
[1:32:29] comes out right
[1:32:30] your past can still be walking around
[1:32:34] but if the lord has judged you sinless
[1:32:37] then you can walk on amen you're not
[1:32:39] under the condemnation anymore
[1:32:41] amen maybe that was a bad segue but you
[1:32:44] know we're free the blood of jesus
[1:32:45] christ is lucius from all sin
[1:32:47] hallelujah so now
[1:32:50] so yeah so
[1:32:52] if you're a person who's drunk the
[1:32:53] garden the cold they don't become as
[1:32:55] sensitive as they are to the to the
[1:32:57] atmosphere like they used to be
[1:32:59] now
[1:33:00] a drunk person's reality becomes
[1:33:02] distorted you cannot think straight
[1:33:06] you cannot think how you were when
[1:33:07] you're sober
[1:33:09] your reality becomes distorted now
[1:33:13] this world's reality is very distorted
[1:33:17] you think about
[1:33:18] the cataclysmic event that's about to
[1:33:21] take place on the world
[1:33:24] and yet people are doing all kinds of
[1:33:26] everything else
[1:33:28] trying to just think they'll just
[1:33:29] somehow get through it
[1:33:32] we have a way of escape
[1:33:35] you're
[1:33:36] a person who's drunk their inhibitions
[1:33:38] go
[1:33:40] the things they wouldn't do when they're
[1:33:42] sober they begin to do when they're
[1:33:43] drunk
[1:33:45] so the things that people never used to
[1:33:46] talk about watch
[1:33:48] do listen to
[1:33:51] when they are sober
[1:33:52] when they get drunk with this world they
[1:33:54] do things that they'll never used to do
[1:33:58] a person who's drunk has big mood swings
[1:34:02] they can either be very depressed or
[1:34:04] happy or violent outbursts can come out
[1:34:07] because they're drunk
[1:34:09] so they don't so they're no longer just
[1:34:11] you know calm and collected level-headed
[1:34:14] having a discussion just like a violent
[1:34:16] outburst can come out especially when
[1:34:18] it's against something they are drunk
[1:34:20] with
[1:34:24] this is all con symptoms of someone
[1:34:25] who's drunk
[1:34:26] i trust you're not under the influence
[1:34:28] today
[1:34:31] but then the sad thing is that people
[1:34:33] who who who get used to being drunk it's
[1:34:36] how they interact with others
[1:34:38] so they need that in their hand to
[1:34:40] become naught become normal that they
[1:34:42] can talk to people
[1:34:46] i'm not talking about just drinking a
[1:34:48] liquid with alcohol in it
[1:34:50] i'm talking about
[1:34:52] devices
[1:34:53] it can be anything that you can be drunk
[1:34:56] with
[1:34:57] right you need this to talk to people
[1:34:59] you can't just have a conversation you
[1:35:01] can't have a normal relationship why
[1:35:02] because you've got to interact via
[1:35:04] something else
[1:35:07] i trust we're all sober today
[1:35:10] amen so we don't want to have big mood
[1:35:11] swing yeah so so these are all symptoms
[1:35:13] of someone who's drunk
[1:35:15] they smite their fellow servants
[1:35:17] and they're becoming they come under the
[1:35:19] influence of what's going on in the
[1:35:21] world
[1:35:24] now
[1:35:26] you know we have a mandate today
[1:35:30] this is someone who's drunk with the
[1:35:32] world
[1:35:34] shall i go through it again they can't
[1:35:35] walk straight their speech becomes
[1:35:37] blurred their vision gets blurry they're
[1:35:39] not sensitive to the cold or whatever
[1:35:41] like they used to be i mean their
[1:35:42] reality becomes distorted
[1:35:45] you know any reality that's contrary to
[1:35:46] the word of god is a distorted reality
[1:35:49] their inhibitions you um go
[1:35:52] they have big mood swings violent
[1:35:54] outbursts
[1:35:55] and they need to be drunk to be able to
[1:35:57] interact with others
[1:35:58] they need that thing to be able to live
[1:36:01] a normal life functioning alcoholics
[1:36:03] they call them
[1:36:06] but we're not called to be filled to be
[1:36:08] drunk with this world
[1:36:10] we're called to be drunk on the holy
[1:36:12] ghost
[1:36:13] amen that we can be drunk every day in
[1:36:15] the holy ghost till we leave this earth
[1:36:17] hallelujah we're unfortunately people
[1:36:20] because the the big trouble in this day
[1:36:22] is a mental health crisis
[1:36:25] and that's around the world
[1:36:27] a mental health crisis you know i
[1:36:29] remember when bernie and noelia first
[1:36:30] came here from argentina and i and i
[1:36:33] told them about how our suicide rate is
[1:36:35] what are the highest in the world and
[1:36:36] they couldn't believe it because to them
[1:36:39] this is utopia this country
[1:36:42] so why do we have everything but yet
[1:36:44] there's a mental health problem
[1:36:46] because people are crying out for some
[1:36:48] satisfaction
[1:36:49] to live some kind of life and it doesn't
[1:36:52] fulfill really what's within them even
[1:36:54] normal family dynamics are broken
[1:36:57] you know
[1:36:58] a big problem with addiction is the
[1:37:00] reason people get addicted to something
[1:37:01] is because actually they have they they
[1:37:03] lose the ability to relate and interact
[1:37:06] with even their family
[1:37:08] that's how why people go into addiction
[1:37:13] but we have
[1:37:14] a different course
[1:37:17] we are not like though i
[1:37:19] i trust that i'm looking at a group of
[1:37:21] people
[1:37:22] that have not said in their heart the
[1:37:23] lord delays is coming
[1:37:26] and that they have not begun to smite
[1:37:27] their fellow servants and to eat and
[1:37:29] drink with the drunken this world is
[1:37:30] drunk it's staggering
[1:37:32] it's staggering left and right all over
[1:37:34] the place
[1:37:37] because the lord will come in a day when
[1:37:40] when there's some people are not looking
[1:37:42] for him
[1:37:43] they can be going through the motions
[1:37:44] they can be coming to church they can be
[1:37:46] saying all the right thing but in their
[1:37:48] heart they're not looking for him
[1:37:50] you know i heard brother ron spencer say
[1:37:52] about his um his father that just passed
[1:37:54] on here's a believer as a preacher there
[1:37:56] in america
[1:37:57] and his father would say that every day
[1:38:00] he's looking for the coming of the lord
[1:38:02] and then
[1:38:04] the last day he was upon the earth
[1:38:06] brother ron spoke to him
[1:38:08] and
[1:38:09] and his father said i'm looking for the
[1:38:10] coming of the lord today and i believe
[1:38:12] he's coming for me today
[1:38:14] two hours after that phone conversation
[1:38:16] the lord took him home
[1:38:19] i believe we should have that kind of an
[1:38:21] attitude
[1:38:22] oh but i've got all these plans and all
[1:38:23] these things i need to do
[1:38:25] the lord the lord's schedule is
[1:38:27] different to our schedule
[1:38:30] we should we should be focused if he's
[1:38:32] not coming today because remember in the
[1:38:33] delay
[1:38:35] in the delay some people get the
[1:38:37] derailed or distracted
[1:38:39] but some people their faith gets
[1:38:40] stronger in the delay
[1:38:42] abraham had a delay of 25 years
[1:38:45] and his faith got stronger every day
[1:38:48] hallelujah he got stronger in faith
[1:38:52] he staggered not at the promise of god
[1:38:53] but was
[1:38:54] fully persuaded god was able to do that
[1:38:56] which he had promised hallelujah so his
[1:38:59] faith got stronger in the delay
[1:39:02] amen we're the sons and daughters of
[1:39:03] abraham are we not
[1:39:05] amen so now
[1:39:08] john would
[1:39:09] john would be here in revelations 10 now
[1:39:12] i want to go into i want to go into very
[1:39:14] quickly now we have
[1:39:16] we have a mandate to fulfill that's a
[1:39:19] trending word so i looked it up
[1:39:21] mandate is an official order or
[1:39:23] commission to do something that's what a
[1:39:24] mandate means so if we're under a
[1:39:27] mandate we've been given a commission or
[1:39:30] an official order to do something
[1:39:32] now our commission is the great
[1:39:34] commission
[1:39:36] it is the great commission that
[1:39:37] commission is not going to finish until
[1:39:40] our bodies are changed
[1:39:42] that's when we know it's done but until
[1:39:44] then we are fulfilling the great
[1:39:46] commission
[1:39:47] so we're under a mandate now we know
[1:39:49] revelations 10 we didn't read the first
[1:39:51] part of it but in the first part we have
[1:39:53] a mighty angel coming down
[1:39:54] rainbow over his head is the covenant
[1:39:56] angel the angel of the covenant which is
[1:39:58] jesus christ and angelic form he comes
[1:40:00] down to the earth
[1:40:02] and he has an open book in his hand now
[1:40:04] that book was closed in revelations 4
[1:40:06] and 5. that's the book of redemption
[1:40:08] we're part of that deed right it's
[1:40:10] everything adam lost from the fall but
[1:40:12] but but we are part of that book because
[1:40:14] brother brown would tell us um in the in
[1:40:16] the breach message he'd say that that
[1:40:19] that act of of of the lamb taking the
[1:40:21] book is as the same as boaz claiming
[1:40:24] ruth
[1:40:25] hallelujah
[1:40:26] amen so so he's taken the book he's
[1:40:29] loosed the seals and then now he comes
[1:40:31] down
[1:40:32] and he gives that word to a seventh
[1:40:34] church age messenger that's why i read
[1:40:36] that verse seven in the days of the
[1:40:37] voice of the seventh angel all the
[1:40:39] mysteries of god should be finished
[1:40:40] right so what's already in the bible
[1:40:42] will be made revealed it's not adding to
[1:40:44] the bible it's not taking away it's just
[1:40:46] revealing what's in the scripture
[1:40:48] amen so now brother ram says that that
[1:40:50] mighty angel coming down
[1:40:52] what will happen when the seventh angel
[1:40:54] is on the earth that's already come and
[1:40:55] gone
[1:40:56] but since christ himself has come down
[1:40:58] now
[1:40:59] i mean to gather a bride to himself this
[1:41:01] is the mandate we're living under this
[1:41:03] is what this is why we're here amen and
[1:41:06] then john now john in revelations 4 and
[1:41:09] 5 it says that no man was found worthy
[1:41:12] to even look upon the book
[1:41:14] he went much because he knew that if no
[1:41:16] one could take back that title deed of
[1:41:18] redemption that actually all of
[1:41:20] creation's in jeopardy
[1:41:22] no man said there were angels there they
[1:41:24] were found you know gabriel would have
[1:41:25] been worthy michael wormwood any of the
[1:41:28] angels because they'd never fallen but
[1:41:29] no man there's a call there has to be a
[1:41:32] man as adam forfeited eternal life there
[1:41:35] had to be a man come and redeem it back
[1:41:37] right so so john was weeping but then
[1:41:39] but then and but then an elder came to
[1:41:41] him and said weep not john
[1:41:43] for the land of the tribe of judah has
[1:41:45] prevailed he's been found whether he's
[1:41:47] wrestled with and overcame how did he do
[1:41:49] that he wrestled with in the garden of
[1:41:51] gethsemane he said not my will but thy
[1:41:53] will be done
[1:41:54] he he submitted his own flesh his own
[1:41:56] body to the will of god for his life and
[1:41:58] he went to calvary victorious the
[1:42:00] victory has won that day or that night
[1:42:02] or that morning in gethsemane and he
[1:42:04] went to calvary for you and i he took
[1:42:06] our sins upon his shoulder i mean he
[1:42:09] purchased with his own blood it wasn't
[1:42:11] the blood of a jew it wasn't the blood
[1:42:13] of a gentile that was the blood of god
[1:42:15] that was shed upon the earth the highest
[1:42:17] price that could be paid amen because
[1:42:19] the highest value that god could esteem
[1:42:21] to any object is you
[1:42:23] hallelujah
[1:42:25] amen then he went down to hell
[1:42:27] amen the devil remembers this moment
[1:42:29] amen satan lost the keys of hell death
[1:42:31] in the grave he ascended up victorious
[1:42:34] amen rising triumphant of every sin
[1:42:36] every every devil every every doubt
[1:42:38] every situation battle
[1:42:40] you know what i love brother armand was
[1:42:42] giving that prophecy about hell
[1:42:45] you know israel will come into the land
[1:42:47] and they'll come into the land of the
[1:42:48] amorites jebusites different arts
[1:42:50] and i just rejoice because god is
[1:42:52] prophesying i'm gonna give bring you
[1:42:54] into direct conflict
[1:42:56] with your enemy i'm going to bring you
[1:42:58] into direct conflict with that thing
[1:42:59] which hinders you i'm going to bring you
[1:43:01] into direct conflict with your enemy but
[1:43:03] i will consume them
[1:43:05] hallelujah so sometimes we just yeah
[1:43:07] life is going fine but then we come up
[1:43:10] against an enemy maybe it's a spirit
[1:43:12] from our past maybe it's some pain maybe
[1:43:14] it's some generational curse that's come
[1:43:16] down but god's saying i'm bringing you
[1:43:18] into conflict with this thing not for
[1:43:20] you to wallow and say i'll never
[1:43:22] overcome it but for you to know this
[1:43:23] thing's coming to an end i'm in the
[1:43:25] cycle of sinners broken in your life by
[1:43:27] the blood of jesus christ hallelujah i'm
[1:43:30] bringing you into conflict with the sin
[1:43:31] but it's gonna die
[1:43:33] hallelujah and what did joshua do after
[1:43:35] that great battle he got the kings those
[1:43:37] kings those nations that hid themselves
[1:43:39] in a cave whatever it was brought them
[1:43:41] out and he got the captains of israel he
[1:43:43] said put your
[1:43:45] put your foot on the neck of your enemy
[1:43:47] i want you to feel what it's like
[1:43:50] to have dominion over this thing i want
[1:43:52] you to experience this i want you to
[1:43:53] remember this moment because if you've
[1:43:55] conquered this one you'll conquer the
[1:43:57] next one
[1:43:58] hallelujah amen serve you so if god has
[1:44:01] overcome one thing in your life have
[1:44:02] confidence the next thing's gone down
[1:44:04] and then the next thing's going down
[1:44:06] then the next thing's going down it was
[1:44:08] lust went down then then pride will go
[1:44:10] down the next whatever it is amen that
[1:44:12] thing's gonna fall
[1:44:14] hallelujah
[1:44:15] amen
[1:44:17] amen i enjoyed that on wednesday amen so
[1:44:19] now
[1:44:20] john as he said john whipped much but
[1:44:23] then he said no the lamb the lander that
[1:44:25] not the lion of the tribe of judah has
[1:44:26] prevailed and when he looked he saw a
[1:44:28] bleeding bloody lamb
[1:44:30] step forth from eternity hallelujah
[1:44:33] that's our king that's our lamb
[1:44:35] amy took the book and all the elders
[1:44:37] everyone threw down their crowns
[1:44:39] hallelujah and actually we're in that
[1:44:41] scene
[1:44:42] because it's all the redeemed through
[1:44:43] the ages worthy of thou amen you've
[1:44:46] prevailed amen to loose the seals with
[1:44:48] your own blood you've redeemed us back
[1:44:49] to god
[1:44:51] hallelujah
[1:44:52] but then now i said john wasn't worthy
[1:44:54] to take the book or even look upon it
[1:44:56] because no because john was in the scene
[1:44:57] too
[1:44:58] but then john is now commanded in
[1:45:00] revelations chapter 10 to take that same
[1:45:03] book and to eat it up
[1:45:05] hallelujah now john is a symbol in the
[1:45:08] book of revelation himself we understand
[1:45:10] that so john represents the bride of
[1:45:13] christ down through the ages because
[1:45:15] after the church ages are done in
[1:45:17] revelations 4 1 john says now that same
[1:45:20] voice that spoke with me i looked up and
[1:45:22] there was now a voice from heaven a
[1:45:24] doors open says come up hither
[1:45:26] and that speaks of the rapture of the
[1:45:28] church which is the dead in christ and
[1:45:30] those which are alive and remain will be
[1:45:32] raptured at the end of the age
[1:45:35] right so one man in a vision represents
[1:45:37] a whole body of people
[1:45:38] amen so now john is now told to take
[1:45:41] this book and eat it up and he's told
[1:45:44] it'll be sweet in your mouth isn't the
[1:45:46] word sweet to talk about
[1:45:47] isn't a great thing to talk about the
[1:45:49] goodness of god but it'll be belly in
[1:45:50] your but it'll be bitter in your belly
[1:45:53] why is that because it will purge things
[1:45:55] out of your life that don't need to be
[1:45:58] there
[1:45:59] hey man you have a real good healthy
[1:46:00] meal after you've been living off junk
[1:46:02] food your belly gets a bit bitter
[1:46:04] why because is it purging out all this
[1:46:05] stuff i mean it's like the word i've
[1:46:08] just become ingested you talk about the
[1:46:09] sweetness of it i mean there's a there's
[1:46:12] a bitterness in here and a sweetness
[1:46:13] here sweet because it's great to talk
[1:46:15] about the goodness of god but it's
[1:46:16] better because it's purging things out
[1:46:18] if the word cuts you left and right
[1:46:20] that's that's like the same thing it's
[1:46:23] purging things out that we don't need
[1:46:25] hallelujah so so he took the book
[1:46:27] but now then he ate the book but then
[1:46:29] that's not the end of it he says thou
[1:46:31] must prophesy again now if we go into
[1:46:33] history we see john after the isle of
[1:46:35] patmos never fulfilled that he went to
[1:46:38] ephesus he passed to the church and he
[1:46:39] died of old age the only apostle to do
[1:46:41] so and so this is now it's actually a
[1:46:44] prophecy knowing that the book of
[1:46:46] revelation is a book of prophecy amen
[1:46:48] speaking of an end time people
[1:46:51] that will become one with the lord jesus
[1:46:53] christ
[1:46:54] and will prophesy again now the word
[1:46:57] prophesy means to speak under
[1:46:58] inspiration so it's not to say something
[1:47:01] different but to say the contents of the
[1:47:03] book
[1:47:04] hallelujah to preach to live the
[1:47:07] contents of the book so in that book is
[1:47:10] redemption
[1:47:11] hallelujah in that book is healing
[1:47:14] remember it's christ revealed right
[1:47:16] brother braham says that the opening of
[1:47:18] the seals reveals christ
[1:47:20] amen so in the book is healing in the
[1:47:22] book of redemption i mean and and the
[1:47:24] book is redemption and the book is the
[1:47:26] forgiveness of sins
[1:47:28] it's all it's all in christ right amen
[1:47:31] in that book as a rapture
[1:47:33] hallelujah in that book is dominion over
[1:47:36] satan
[1:47:37] and that book is as dominion over every
[1:47:39] evil spirit
[1:47:41] hallelujah
[1:47:42] and that book is actually dominion over
[1:47:44] nature everything adam lost is restored
[1:47:46] now right now oh one day it'll happen
[1:47:48] we're waiting for a surge of the holy
[1:47:50] ghost to make it live it's happening
[1:47:52] we're here right now the former and
[1:47:53] latter reign are running together
[1:47:55] hallelujah
[1:47:57] amen in in that book is all those so now
[1:48:00] we are mandated
[1:48:03] we are commissioned
[1:48:04] to preach the contents of the book
[1:48:07] so we're preached we're sorry we're
[1:48:09] mandated to preach or to live out amen
[1:48:14] the contents of the book the revealed
[1:48:16] word which is christ that's our mandate
[1:48:19] that's what we're here to do
[1:48:20] we are commissioned to do it now if
[1:48:22] you're commissioned to do something
[1:48:24] you'll be given the ability to do it
[1:48:26] amen you will not just be left there and
[1:48:28] say no now you work it out no that's not
[1:48:30] a right commission if someone's
[1:48:32] commissioned
[1:48:33] you're given the tools
[1:48:34] you're given the ability
[1:48:36] amen and the reason you are called to do
[1:48:38] the job is because you have the ability
[1:48:40] to do the job even if you realize you
[1:48:42] may not realize you're able to do it but
[1:48:44] actually deep within you you have it
[1:48:46] amen
[1:48:48] so we are here
[1:48:50] brother braham said that there is a
[1:48:52] cycle of revival and death
[1:48:55] but that cycle will come to an end in
[1:48:57] the end time
[1:48:58] amen
[1:49:00] amen where is no longer revival and go
[1:49:02] down to death and there's another
[1:49:03] revival no that cycle is to be broken
[1:49:08] it would say in revelations 3
[1:49:11] where the lord would the complaint
[1:49:13] against this age and i'm gonna i'm gonna
[1:49:15] close just after this thought
[1:49:16] i behave i'll behave
[1:49:19] there is there is
[1:49:21] he says because they are neither hot nor
[1:49:23] cold but lukewarm i'll spew the out of
[1:49:24] my mouth
[1:49:25] now we know that in the scripture
[1:49:28] because some people say well if you're
[1:49:30] lukewarm god will spit you out of his
[1:49:32] mouth so he'll
[1:49:33] you're not part of him anymore
[1:49:36] but it's that but in the bible we're
[1:49:37] engraved in the palm of his hands we're
[1:49:39] in his bosom but we're never in his
[1:49:41] mouth the word is in his mouth
[1:49:43] right the word of god is in in the mouth
[1:49:46] of god so when god says that you're
[1:49:48] neither hot nor cold but your lukewarm
[1:49:49] will spew the out of my mouth spew the
[1:49:51] out of my mouth that means that you'll
[1:49:52] no longer speak for me
[1:49:54] you'll speak for yourself or speak for
[1:49:56] your church whatever you no longer speak
[1:49:58] for me
[1:50:00] but in order to preach the contents of
[1:50:03] the book to prophesy again
[1:50:05] we are not here to speak or live our own
[1:50:08] opinion
[1:50:09] we're here to speak or live the word
[1:50:13] above all things
[1:50:14] amen above all things we're here to
[1:50:16] speak that's why we should edify one
[1:50:18] another in love
[1:50:20] that's why we should build up one
[1:50:21] another we're all on the same team
[1:50:23] there's not the government and the
[1:50:25] opposition and the greens and the
[1:50:26] whatevers no no we're all on the same
[1:50:28] team right we're all in the same body
[1:50:31] towards the same goal wanting to do the
[1:50:33] same thing
[1:50:35] amen
[1:50:36] amen but if we're here to live you think
[1:50:38] about now if you've received salvation
[1:50:41] if you've received mercy you will extend
[1:50:43] mercy because in the book you've
[1:50:44] received the book i mean if you receive
[1:50:46] pardoning grace you'll impart pardoning
[1:50:49] grace amen if the lord has forgiven you
[1:50:51] you will forgive others amen if you've
[1:50:53] received divine love and divine love is
[1:50:55] in you remember divine love is a person
[1:50:57] it's christ
[1:50:58] right if he is in you then divine love
[1:50:59] will be extended
[1:51:01] hallelujah hey why because you've become
[1:51:03] one with the book
[1:51:05] amen
[1:51:07] he says now
[1:51:08] he says a momentary consideration of
[1:51:10] church history
[1:51:12] will prove how accurate this thought is
[1:51:14] that thought is that you know he says
[1:51:15] i'll spew the out of my mouth because
[1:51:17] you no longer speak for me in the dark
[1:51:19] ages the word was almost lost entirely
[1:51:21] lost to the people but god sent luther
[1:51:24] with the word the lutheran spoke for god
[1:51:26] at that time but they organized and
[1:51:27] again the pure word was lost for
[1:51:29] organization tends towards dogma and
[1:51:31] creed and not the simple word they could
[1:51:33] no longer speak for god the god sent
[1:51:35] wesley
[1:51:36] and
[1:51:37] god sent wesley and he was the voice
[1:51:39] with the word in his day the people who
[1:51:42] took his revelation from god became the
[1:51:44] living epistles rather known of all men
[1:51:46] for their generation when the methodist
[1:51:48] failed god raised up others and so it

[1:52:28] the fastest hundred in the world ten
[1:52:30] seconds on a bad day about nine
[1:52:32] something but they live for that one
[1:52:34] moment their whole life what they eat
[1:52:36] what they do all their focus their sleep
[1:52:38] their whole routine is because of one
[1:52:40] moment just for one moment
[1:52:42] amen now we should live for one moment
[1:52:45] what's that moment when the holy ghost
[1:52:47] sweeps through the people and you see
[1:52:48] your bodies change you become young
[1:52:50] again or the children now 18-21 that's
[1:52:53] the moment we should be looking for
[1:52:55] hallelujah that is what we should be
[1:52:56] living for and we should be living in
[1:52:59] such a way that whosoever will let them

[1:53:19] spirit or my spirit or something
[1:53:20] ridiculous like that no the whole
