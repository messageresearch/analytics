[26:40] amen on that day did king hazarus give
[26:42] the house of haman the jew's enemy unto
[26:44] esther the queen
[26:45] and mordecai came before the king for
[26:47] esther had told what
[26:49] he was under her and the king took off
[26:51] his ring that he had taken
[26:53] from haman and gave it unto mordecai and
[26:56] esther
[26:56] set mordecai over the house of haman and
[26:59] esther spake yet again before the king
[27:01] and fell down at his feet besought him
[27:03] with tears
[27:04] to put away the mischief of haman the
[27:06] agagite and his device
[27:08] that he had devised against the jews
[27:10] then the king held out the golden
[27:12] scepter towards esther so esther arose
[27:14] and stood before the king and said if it
[27:17] please the king and if i have found
[27:19] favor in his
[27:20] sight and the things seem be right
[27:22] before
[27:24] before the king and i be pleasing in his

[27:34] destroy
[27:35] the jews which are in all the king's
[27:37] province

[27:40] the evil that shall come
[27:41] unto my people or how can i endure to
[27:44] see the destruction of my kindred
[27:46] then the king of hazara said unto esther
[27:48] the queen and to mordecai the jew behold
[27:50] i have given esther
[27:51] the house of haman and him they have
[27:54] hanged upon the gallows because he laid

[28:17] sivan on the three and twentieth day
[28:20] thereof and it was written according to
[28:21] all that mordecai commanded unto the
[28:23] jews
[28:24] and to the lieutenants and the deputies
[28:26] and rulers of the provinces

[28:45] king's ring and sent letters by post on
[28:47] horseback and riders on mules camels and
[28:50] young
[28:50] uh drummadiers if that's how you say it
[28:52] wherein the king granted the jews
[28:54] which are in every city to gather
[28:56] themselves together and to stand for
[28:57] their
[28:58] life to destroy to slay and to cause to
[29:00] perish all the power of the people and
[29:02] province

[32:21] we thank you lord

[32:24] way in our midst lord in jesus christ's
[32:26] name
[32:26] amen amen god bless you friends you may
[32:29] have your seats tonight
[32:30] um i'd like to you know i feel like it's
[32:33] wednesday so you just kind of jump in
[32:34] there you get done and you go home kind
[32:35] of thing but
[32:36] you know not that we want to be quick
[32:37] but um i want to talk about the
[32:40] the the ordained position that we have
[32:42] in this time
[32:43] now esther you know we read there in the
[32:45] book of esther where
[32:46] where haman had been hung and then all
[32:48] of all of the
[32:50] you know house of haman had been given
[32:51] to esther and um but but really the most
[32:54] important thing that she received was
[32:55] the king's ring
[32:57] i mean receive that segment because that
[32:59] signet if you know any law
[33:01] you know in the old days a law could
[33:03] only really have the
[33:04] um authority behind it if it was sealed
[33:07] with the king's seal
[33:08] you know anyone could write a lot of
[33:10] things they could ride it to sound like
[33:12] the king they could maybe
[33:13] trick a lot of people without that seal
[33:15] underneath the bottom of that document
[33:16] it was null and void
[33:17] it had no impact it had no weight behind
[33:20] it but if the king signed anything to
[33:22] law and put his seal behind it then the
[33:24] whole of the kingdom was behind that
[33:25] seal
[33:26] amen so now that power had been given
[33:28] into esther's hand
[33:30] i meant to can you i'm kind of like in a
[33:32] big echo chamber here you know
[33:34] can you kind of de-echo this it's kind
[33:36] of you know
[33:38] you know but but now that authority had
[33:40] been given to esther and in reality it
[33:42] was always her
[33:44] hers to use right but now she had to
[33:47] actually
[33:47] take what she had that was really her
[33:50] rightful uh
[33:50] possession and now put it into action
[33:53] it's the same thing with you and i
[33:55] we're now we're living in a time not
[33:57] just to talk about
[33:58] who we are but put into action who we
[34:00] are amen is the bride of jesus christ so
[34:02] now
[34:03] we could read here in haggai chapter 2
[34:05] where
[34:06] where there's a prophecy speaking of
[34:08] zerubbabel we know that haggai was
[34:11] one of the prophets when when the temple
[34:13] in jerusalem was being restored
[34:15] and uh he would say to uh you know
[34:17] haggai 2 and 21 he'd say speak to
[34:19] zerubbabel governor of judah
[34:21] saying i'll shake the hemos in the earth
[34:23] and i'll overthrow the thrones of
[34:24] kingdoms
[34:25] and i'll destroy the strength of the
[34:27] kingdoms of the heathen i will
[34:29] overthrow the chariots and those that
[34:30] ride in them and the horses and their
[34:32] riders shall come down
[34:34] every one by the sword of his brother in
[34:37] that day
[34:38] i saith the lord of hosts
[34:41] will i take thee o zerubbabel my servant
[34:44] the son of
[34:45] shetheal saith the lord and make thee as
[34:48] a signet for i have chosen thee saith
[34:50] the lord
[34:51] of hosts now we know scripture has
[34:53] compound meaning we know that there was
[34:55] a literal zerubbabel the governor of
[34:57] judah but
[34:57] if you look into the scriptures ruble
[34:59] also speaks of the lord jesus christ
[35:01] where
[35:02] where zechariah had the had the uh
[35:04] vision of you know
[35:05] you know zerubbabel will we'll we'll
[35:07] we'll we'll begin the building and then
[35:09] then the headstone he'll bring forth the
[35:11] head
[35:11] stone with crying's grace grace under it
[35:13] speaking of the gentile bride will be
[35:15] built by god
[35:17] it's not man's building we're not man's
[35:19] handiwork amen we're god's handiwork
[35:21] we are the handiwork of the lord jesus
[35:23] christ we are his masterpiece
[35:25] he's been molding us maybe for some
[35:27] years or maybe just a few moments but as
[35:29] long as we're on his wheel
[35:31] as long as we're being shaped into the
[35:32] image of his word that's a good thing
[35:34] amen so and whatever god starts he's
[35:36] going to finish right he doesn't just
[35:38] there's no two hard basket for god he
[35:40] doesn't have one in heaven
[35:41] it's not in his workshop hallelujah you
[35:43] may think you're a difficult case it
[35:45] don't
[35:45] it doesn't matter to god he doesn't have
[35:47] difficult cases
[35:48] hallelujah so now this cerebral
[35:52] wasn't just speaking to the governor of
[35:54] of judah but speaking
[35:56] prophesying of the lord jesus christ
[35:58] where there'll come a day where god will
[36:00] shake heavens and earth
[36:02] and this cerebral world will become a
[36:04] signet
[36:06] so now it's going to be god is going to
[36:08] put you know
[36:09] put his full authority behind the word
[36:12] like never before sure we saw it in a
[36:14] brief
[36:15] span of time after pentecost where you
[36:17] know god
[36:18] spoke directly to the world through the
[36:20] church and brother ram said that the
[36:23] world will hear direct from god as they
[36:24] did at pentecost because we're being
[36:26] returned back to the faith of the
[36:27] fathers
[36:28] hallelujah so now this signet hallelujah
[36:31] which is our lord
[36:32] is now placed on the hand of the bride
[36:35] we're going to put some things
[36:36] we're going to put some things into law
[36:38] if i can put it that way
[36:40] because remember jesus said to his
[36:42] church whatever you bind on earth shall
[36:43] be bound in heaven
[36:45] whatever you loose on earth shall be
[36:46] loosed in heaven so the power to bind
[36:49] and loose the devil is placed in the
[36:50] hands of the bride of jesus christ
[36:52] amen it's placed in your hands tonight
[36:54] amen so we should put that power into
[36:56] action
[36:57] right instead of letting that you know
[36:59] like a mosquito at night you just hear
[37:00] this
[37:02] that's like the devil he's annoying
[37:05] right he's real annoying you know
[37:07] maybe from the tropics we get a bit
[37:08] scared maybe it's got dengue fever or
[37:10] malaria but it's just
[37:13] but when you get sick of it after a
[37:15] while instead of just rolling over and
[37:17] saying well if it fill up boys you know
[37:19] i'm sleeping
[37:19] but when you get sick of it that's how
[37:21] the bride has kind of been
[37:22] let the devil beat her around this way
[37:24] that way you've got to live with your
[37:25] problems
[37:26] live with the spirit live with this
[37:28] trouble you know but there's a time when
[37:29] you
[37:30] get sick of it you turn the light on or
[37:32] actually i say there's a man standing
[37:34] present that can turn on the light
[37:35] and you say now where is that annoying
[37:37] mosquito and you just go
[37:40] you know and you just kind of wipe them
[37:41] away and you know he's done
[37:43] that's how we should be with the devil
[37:45] right instead of letting him just buzz
[37:47] around
[37:48] yeah yeah we have the power to squish
[37:51] them
[37:52] what's that power the power to bind them
[37:54] or to lose them hallelujah
[37:56] i mean so but that authority is in the
[37:58] bride of christ
[38:00] it's in it's in the power remember life
[38:02] and death is in the power of the tongue
[38:04] you know you know your tongue is the
[38:05] most supernatural element
[38:07] that you possess hallelujah even
[38:10] even words of unregenerate men are very
[38:12] powerful
[38:13] how about the redeemed of the lord
[38:18] amen so now esther had to
[38:21] so i'm still kind of echoing here yeah
[38:24] you'll get it don't worry there's so
[38:26] many buttons behind that i think it's
[38:27] scary
[38:28] man you can fly 747 after you master
[38:30] that thing
[38:31] anyway so but you know that power is in
[38:35] the bride of christ now
[38:36] esther had to put into law because the
[38:38] king said i cannot reverse what haman
[38:40] did
[38:41] but now a new law can be written now we
[38:44] know that haman's demise if you read the
[38:46] book of esther
[38:47] all began to happen after the king could
[38:49] not rest
[38:51] and he called for the records of the
[38:52] kingdom to come and when the records
[38:55] came
[38:55] open then they then haman begin to make
[38:58] his downfall because the kingdom records
[39:00] came open and then there was
[39:01] and it was written in there how mordecai
[39:03] saved the king's life
[39:04] so it's when the book came open that's
[39:06] when haman began to make his fall
[39:09] i mean the plan was already in motion
[39:10] before the book came open because
[39:12] remember jesus even said
[39:13] when the disciples were sent out with
[39:15] power and authority to cast out devil
[39:16] his head
[39:17] i beheld satan fall from heaven as
[39:19] lightning so
[39:20] jesus was saying even as the church was
[39:22] given that power to cast out devils even
[39:24] before pentecost
[39:25] satan began to fall right but now has
[39:28] come the full
[39:28] time of his fall because because the
[39:31] prophet told us
[39:32] when satan is cast out the bride goes up
[39:35] hallelujah so there's actually a
[39:37] reversal now instead of him being in
[39:39] charge
[39:39] he gets cast the earth and now we go
[39:41] into our rightful position
[39:43] amen in heaven but we must understand
[39:45] but we are seated now together in
[39:46] heavenly places in christ jesus right
[39:48] now
[39:49] amen so don't don't don't put this off
[39:52] in a future thing it's
[39:53] right now louis so
[39:56] a signet as i said it's a small seal
[39:59] especially one set in a ring
[40:01] and it's used instead of a signature to
[40:03] give authentication to an official
[40:05] document
[40:06] hallelujah so we have been given this
[40:09] now who understand who's who
[40:11] who's following me don't be you know
[40:13] because the devil you know the devil
[40:15] wants you to make you think you you have
[40:16] no
[40:16] power you have no authority you have no
[40:19] business trying to tell me what to do
[40:21] who are you to you know come against me
[40:23] and you know try and try and make me get
[40:25] back well we have that barren authority
[40:27] just like the prophet said you can take
[40:28] the smallest policeman on the force he
[40:30] can be literally a two by four
[40:32] and his hat falling over his ears and
[40:34] things but let him go out on the street
[40:36] once
[40:36] blow that whistle hand up that you know
[40:38] hold up that hand and the biggest truck
[40:40] that could just run him over flat has to
[40:41] stop
[40:42] because all the city is behind that man
[40:45] hallelujah you know all of all of heaven
[40:47] is behind you
[40:48] oh yeah this is not us trying to fight
[40:50] the devil in our own ability it's god
[40:52] behind us backing us up
[40:54] hallelujah we're even even moses you
[40:56] know you know moses when he stepped into
[40:58] egypt and he said let my people go and
[41:00] he began to plague
[41:01] he began to plague egypt he's let frogs
[41:04] and flies
[41:04] know he lifted up the staff to different
[41:06] things that wasn't him making those
[41:08] things come to pass that was god in him
[41:10] hallelujah but he was determined he had
[41:12] enough grit amen israel was getting out
[41:14] of here
[41:15] doesn't matter how much pressure the
[41:17] devil puts on amen he
[41:18] is going to have to let go eventually
[41:20] that's the same thing with you and i
[41:22] said hallelujah so when the book came
[41:25] open then
[41:26] then haman's demise begin to come
[41:29] come come into motion if you go ready
[41:31] hallelujah so now
[41:33] as i said as in haggai it said this will
[41:36] happen
[41:37] when he says i'll shake the heavens and
[41:39] the earth
[41:40] now if we turn to hebrews 12
[41:43] because haggai was speaking of a future
[41:45] time and even the apostle paul would
[41:47] pick it up
[41:48] and he'd say see that ye refuse not him
[41:50] that speaketh
[41:52] for if they escape not who refused him
[41:54] that spake on the earth
[41:55] much more shall not we escape if we
[41:58] turn away from him that speaketh from
[42:00] heaven whose voice then shook the earth
[42:03] but now he hath promised saying
[42:05] yet once more i shake not the earth only
[42:07] but also heaven
[42:09] and this word yet once more signifieth
[42:11] the removal of those things that are
[42:13] shaken
[42:14] as of things that are made but those
[42:16] things which cannot be
[42:17] shaken may remain now
[42:20] i think i don't know if it yeah it's
[42:22] probably pretty clear to a lot of us you
[42:24] know if you just look at current events
[42:25] this world is shaking
[42:27] this world is falling apart yes we have
[42:29] the greatest technology
[42:31] probably since the flood you know we
[42:33] have you know we have
[42:35] ways of doing things that they never had
[42:37] even 10 years ago
[42:39] but yet we don't have any answers for
[42:40] anything mental health problems are an
[42:42] all-time high the prophet said this will
[42:44] be a
[42:44] age of mental health problems you know
[42:47] but we have all the drugs we can you
[42:48] know all the all the help we can get all
[42:50] those different things but yet mental
[42:52] health problems have skyrocketed
[42:53] i mean suicide rates have gone through
[42:55] the roof you know poverty even is really
[42:58] bad you know people can
[42:59] can can have a belly full of food but
[43:01] there's no nutrition
[43:03] you know the you know nature's falling
[43:04] apart governments are falling apart
[43:07] the whole world's falling apart why
[43:09] because it's the shaking of those
[43:11] he's shaking heaven and earth but he
[43:14] signified the removing of those things
[43:17] that are shaken because there's a lot of
[43:18] things that we see around us they won't
[43:20] be here in the millennium
[43:22] they're going to be taken away praise
[43:24] the lord hallelujah
[43:26] amen thank you amen i'm glad about that
[43:28] but those things
[43:30] which cannot be shaken may remain
[43:33] amen even uh because so what's what god
[43:36] has been doing is he's been taking our
[43:38] confidence off of man
[43:40] and nations and how even you know
[43:42] anything a man can do
[43:44] but we thank god for everything man can
[43:45] do but he's taking our ultimate
[43:47] confidence off those things and putting
[43:49] it on the word of god
[43:51] sure we go to the doctor we get
[43:52] education we do all those things but our
[43:54] ultimate confidence rests on the word of
[43:56] god does it not
[43:57] i mean just like brother brown he would
[43:59] preach against a lot it he would preach
[44:01] against education but the reason he'd
[44:02] preach against it is because people
[44:04] would rely on the education and forget
[44:06] god
[44:07] that was why he was against it did he
[44:09] take the education take god hey praise
[44:11] the lord that's all good but just don't
[44:12] kick god out
[44:14] and and and whatever you do amen
[44:17] so there is a shaking heaven and earth
[44:20] is being shaken but those things that
[44:22] cannot be shaken may remain the only
[44:24] thing that can remain
[44:24] in this hour is the word of god is a
[44:27] people built into his image
[44:30] that's why we have a kind of stability
[44:31] that the world doesn't have
[44:33] hallelujah amen
[44:36] wherefore so because of this we're
[44:38] receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[44:40] moved
[44:41] let us have grace whereby we may serve
[44:44] god acceptably with reverence and godly
[44:46] fear
[44:47] for our god is a consuming fire
[44:50] hallelujah so we're living in this hour
[44:52] you know there's you know there has to
[44:53] be just like the book of ephesians if
[44:55] you read it
[44:56] you know paul would call them saying
[44:58] you've been you know
[44:59] you heard the word of truth you know you
[45:01] believed your seal to the day of your
[45:03] redemption
[45:04] you know but then he says now let's
[45:05] press on to the high calling in christ
[45:07] where we've grown to the statue of the
[45:08] fullness the image of christ hebrews 4.
[45:11] but if you read church history they aim
[45:12] at that then they relax
[45:14] and then eventually that drift will
[45:16] continue down into a dark age but now
[45:18] the prophet says we've come to another
[45:19] ephesians again so we've come back round
[45:22] again i've probably been saying these
[45:23] things for
[45:24] you know i've you know i've said this a
[45:25] bit but i want to emphasize these things
[45:27] so
[45:27] now i've come back to that ephesians
[45:29] again but now there's a there's
[45:30] there's a people on the earth that god
[45:32] uses to break that cycle
[45:34] of revival and death where they don't
[45:36] just aim at and say yes lord i'm going
[45:38] to become exactly like you by your grace
[45:40] and then just drift
[45:42] but they actually surrender themselves
[45:44] completely to the word and believe it
[45:45] and they go
[45:46] all the way in and became made into his
[45:47] very image into the fullness of christ
[45:50] and we're living in that time and it's
[45:52] god's divine favor and grace upon you
[45:54] that causes that to happen
[45:55] you know caleb and joshua just like the
[45:57] rest of the spies really
[45:59] but they received a revelation of the
[46:01] land was theirs that's the only thing
[46:02] that made the difference between the two
[46:04] groups
[46:04] they both saw the same giants the same
[46:06] problems the same land the good things
[46:08] and the bad things
[46:09] but two received a revelation when they
[46:11] heard moses preaching that you're going
[46:12] to go and take the land they received a
[46:14] revelation
[46:15] i mean that that was their inheritance
[46:17] but the others didn't receive that
[46:18] revelation so the only difference
[46:19] between us and you say anyone else is
[46:21] divine revelation
[46:23] hallelujah that's why we should say
[46:25] thank god you've become real to me does
[46:28] it become real to us all
[46:29] hallelujah you remember that time that
[46:31] hour when you met him you know brother
[46:33] graham says it's like branding cattle
[46:36] hallelujah you take a hot iron i don't
[46:38] know if they do it anymore like this
[46:39] they got it tags but yo
[46:41] we used to have my great uncles branding
[46:43] irons used to be buy our fire
[46:44] at home but i think my parents still
[46:46] have them
[46:47] they would never use when i was alive
[46:49] you know but you know but yeah
[46:51] they put that thing in a stool they take
[46:52] that red hot iron that brand you know
[46:55] branded side and that let it go go kinky
[46:57] you know kicking and stomping and
[46:59] snorting because they got a lot of pain
[47:00] they you know jumped around the corral
[47:02] but they knew who they belonged to and
[47:04] yes the same thing with you and i
[47:06] trust when you met god you may be a lot
[47:08] of snorting and crying and shouting and
[47:09] whooping and
[47:10] you know but but by the end of it you
[47:12] knew who you belong to
[47:14] hallelujah and you're carrying now a
[47:16] sickness
[47:17] hallelujah amen hallelujah now
[47:22] if we take the parable of the prodigal
[47:24] son
[47:26] we see when he came to himself now now
[47:28] we are all in this parable
[47:30] i trust you're not the older brother or
[47:32] the other brother that just
[47:34] that wasn't happy to see grace extended
[47:36] to someone i trust you're not that
[47:37] category and you're the prodigal son
[47:40] amen because that who uh who has been
[47:42] forgiven much loveth much
[47:44] i mean so if god has really forgiven you
[47:46] then grace can be extended because grace
[47:47] was received
[47:48] amen but if grace was never received it
[47:50] cannot be extended to someone
[47:52] else and just and your life will be full
[47:53] of criticism of other people
[47:56] but so here he is he's a man who who
[47:59] takes his inheritance spoils it you know
[48:01] it goes to a far country
[48:02] spends it all but he's sitting in a pig
[48:04] pigpen and he comes to himself
[48:07] he realizes my father's servants have it
[48:10] better than me
[48:11] hallelujah who knows the story i love
[48:13] these stories i love the parables there
[48:15] you go
[48:16] i enjoy it so so he comes and brother
[48:18] bram says actually the angel lord came
[48:20] into the pig pen
[48:21] and brought him to his right mind
[48:23] because remember not one of us could
[48:25] actually come to our right mind in our
[48:26] own selves
[48:27] it wasn't actually you and your humanity
[48:29] or me just decided one day
[48:31] i'm going to be a christian
[48:34] you should have been a big amen right
[48:36] there it's not us it's not
[48:38] within man the bible says to seek after
[48:40] god it's not actually within us humanly
[48:42] to seek after him but god had to put
[48:44] something within us
[48:45] that at his predestined moment something
[48:47] goes
[48:48] there's got to be more to life than this
[48:50] there's got to be more to it than this
[48:52] you know
[48:52] and god begins to move maybe you're
[48:54] raising the message maybe you came out
[48:55] of the world like
[48:56] like myself but something in you just
[48:58] says there's got to be something
[49:00] and god and that's god that's the only
[49:02] lord coming to you coming to your right
[49:03] mind you begin to walk
[49:05] hardly you begin to find yourself
[49:06] walking in the scripture in familiar
[49:08] places
[49:08] and then finally you come to a place
[49:10] where the father steps out
[49:12] but then because of our past we think
[49:14] there's no way we could be restored to a
[49:15] son
[49:16] of god we're just going to be a
[49:17] second-class citizen in the kingdom
[49:19] but god don't want second-class citizens
[49:21] in his pride his bride is meant to be a
[49:22] joint heir
[49:24] that's what he wants with you and i am
[49:25] we're never meant to be servants we're
[49:27] meant to be bride we need to be family
[49:29] amen and and we had to come to
[49:31] realization because
[49:32] we always were family amen you do not
[49:35] become a son or a daughter by the new
[49:37] birth you already were
[49:38] and the reason you're a son or daughter
[49:40] is you can get born again
[49:42] hallelujah so he comes back in his heart
[49:44] he's thinking i'm not worthy to be a
[49:46] son i'll just be a servant he comes back
[49:47] to his father and he says to us father
[49:50] you know i've sinned against heaven
[49:51] against you i'm not worthy to be your
[49:53] son
[49:53] but then yeah the father's not
[49:55] interested in his you know how he feels
[49:57] about what he did
[49:58] he says no i want to restore my son he
[50:01] was lost but now he's found i'm going to
[50:03] restore him back to sonship again
[50:05] so he calls his servants and says yo get
[50:07] the best robe
[50:08] get the ring holy what is that a signet
[50:10] hallelujah the father's ring put it on
[50:13] his hand signifying here's authority
[50:16] him speaking is the same as me speaking
[50:19] if the bride has surrendered to god amen
[50:21] she's speaking the same as him speaking
[50:23] brother ram said if you you just get a
[50:25] spirit-filled
[50:26] spirit-led man or woman of god speaking
[50:28] the word of god across their lips is the
[50:30] same as deity speaking
[50:32] every mountain has to go nothing can
[50:34] stand before that man or woman
[50:36] i happen to believe that amen hallelujah
[50:40] you know where brother brown would quote
[50:42] constantly the scripture
[50:44] he that believeth on me the works that i
[50:46] do he shall do also
[50:48] and that's not just for the prophet
[50:49] that's for the bride of christ
[50:51] what ye say you know if two agree on
[50:54] earth i'll do it
[50:56] amen if you speak to this mountain do
[50:58] not doubt and say because of the sea
[51:00] it shall be done and it's not just talk
[51:03] about figurative things talk about
[51:04] literal things
[51:05] getting rid of literal devils i mean
[51:07] literal sickness literal problems
[51:09] i believe it we're here to fulfill that
[51:12] scripture say lord fulfill that
[51:14] scripture in my life
[51:16] amen you say well that's quite a
[51:17] challenging thing it's not challenging
[51:19] because god is the one who actually
[51:20] fulfills it it's not your ability that
[51:23] makes the world come to pass all we have
[51:24] to
[51:24] surrender to it say lord come and live
[51:27] hallelujah
[51:29] amen that's why we should be rugged in
[51:31] our faith amen
[51:33] all things are possible to them that
[51:34] belief you know many times we say
[51:36] there's nothing impossible with god but
[51:38] but jesus said all things are possible
[51:40] to them that believe that means there's
[51:41] nothing impossible with you
[51:44] hallelujah amen so he comes back you
[51:49] know his father
[51:50] is not interested in in him wanting to
[51:52] be a servant because of his past just
[51:54] like the lord he doesn't care
[51:55] really about what we've done he just
[51:57] wants us home
[51:59] that's all he's interested in he he
[52:00] doesn't care whether he knew where we'd
[52:02] go
[52:04] he wasn't surprised whatever pig pen you
[52:06] woke up in
[52:07] he wasn't shocked he's you know god is
[52:09] not having an emergency
[52:12] his program is rolling right on he's not
[52:15] he's not worried
[52:16] he's not saying how's this all going to
[52:18] come together he knows exactly how it's
[52:20] come together
[52:21] you know i think i've said it here but
[52:22] yeah i kind of marvel at these things
[52:24] you know in a war
[52:25] if you can actually get within the
[52:27] intelligence of the enemy
[52:29] you've got them like the uh allies they
[52:32] got the enigma
[52:33] code breaking machine and they found out
[52:34] what the nazis doing and what the
[52:36] japanese were doing
[52:37] they got within their code system so
[52:38] they could actually decipher their
[52:40] communications find out what they're
[52:41] doing
[52:42] and that's a big part of it that's how
[52:43] they won the war now you think about god
[52:46] imagine this is an enemy because this is
[52:48] what the devil does
[52:49] the devil said i'm going to fight this
[52:51] guy yeah now
[52:52] this guy he knows all things
[52:56] he knows when the enemy's going to do it
[52:58] how he's going to do it why he's gonna
[52:59] do it we're exactly down to the
[53:01] finite pico second
[53:05] which is one of the smallest museums of
[53:06] time right
[53:08] you know when when when natural armies
[53:10] fight they kind of guess well i think
[53:11] the enemy will do this in this time
[53:13] frame and this is yeah there's a
[53:14] plus or minus of a guesstimation right
[53:17] right it can be a good guesstimation but
[53:18] god knows exactly
[53:20] when the enemy's going to do this and
[53:22] this and how he's going to do it and
[53:23] exactly and
[53:24] he's never guessing he knows exactly and
[53:26] that's the kind of enemy
[53:28] the devil says i'm going to fight and
[53:29] beat
[53:31] the devil is deceived how can you ever
[53:33] defeat an enemy who knows exactly when
[53:35] you're going to show up
[53:36] the methods you're going to use the
[53:37] tactics you're going to use how how can
[53:39] you beat that kind of enemy you can't
[53:42] hallelujah so we have nothing to fear
[53:46] amen sometimes you say i don't really
[53:49] understand what's going on well i just
[53:51] say the footsteps of the righteous audit
[53:52] of the law
[53:54] see everything's actually going okay
[53:58] hey i can't remember who said it but the
[54:00] other bride's in good shape
[54:02] hallelujah i think we're in good shape
[54:03] hey the blood makes us in the best shape
[54:05] hallelujah amen so the father then
[54:09] you know the son tries to say he says in
[54:11] luke 15 21
[54:12] and the son said unto him father i have
[54:14] sinned against heaven and in thy
[54:15] sight and am no more worthy to be called
[54:17] thy son
[54:18] but the father said to his servants
[54:20] bring forth the best robe
[54:22] we have the best robe and she would be
[54:24] as grounded unto her that she'd be
[54:26] arrayed and fine
[54:27] and clean and white for the fine linen
[54:29] as the righteousness of saints this is
[54:30] revelations 19.
[54:32] amen see let us be glad and rejoice and
[54:34] give honor to him for the marriage of
[54:36] the lamb has come
[54:37] we're living the scripture do you know
[54:39] and his wife had made herself ready
[54:42] and to her she was granted she should be
[54:43] a raid and fine linen clean and white
[54:46] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[54:47] of saints so this is the best robe
[54:50] hallelujah this is not us trying to get
[54:52] in a white throne judgment by our works
[54:54] that no that's not that kind of thing
[54:55] i mean but this is the best robe we have
[54:57] you're wearing it right now
[54:59] i don't know if you i don't know if
[55:00] you're aware but you know when you wake
[55:02] up you're dressed
[55:03] when you go to bed you're dressed you're
[55:05] dressed all the time in this
[55:07] hallelujah that makes me happy i don't
[55:09] know about you it should you know
[55:10] thank you and put on him a ring on his
[55:14] hand and shoes on his feet
[55:16] so what is that now that's the to me
[55:18] that's the father's ring
[55:19] whatever he says is as if i'm saying it
[55:23] hallelujah hallelujah
[55:27] amen even even if saying isaiah 61 and
[55:29] 10 oh greatly rejoice in the lord
[55:32] my soul shall be joyful in my god for he
[55:34] has clothed me with the garments of
[55:35] salvation
[55:36] he hath covered me with the robe of
[55:38] righteousness as a bridegroom decath
[55:40] himself with ornaments
[55:42] and as a bride adorneth herself with her
[55:44] jewels
[55:45] hallelujah amen the scripture tells us
[55:48] we are joint is
[55:49] yes and if children then heirs is of god
[55:52] joint is with christ
[55:54] if so be we suffer with him that we may
[55:57] also be glorified
[55:58] together amen now this word joint air it
[56:02] actually denotes
[56:03] a union it means cohere but it but but
[56:06] it denotes a union in the greek
[56:08] amen so we're joining us but we're uni
[56:10] we'll become one with him
[56:12] amen hallelujah now
[56:16] if we look into this where where it says
[56:18] in ephesians 4 and verse 13 grieve not
[56:21] the holy spirit of god whereby we are
[56:23] sealed to the day of redemption
[56:25] and that word sealed it means to stamp
[56:28] for security or for preservation
[56:31] hallelujah so we have been we've
[56:34] received and this
[56:35] this word also means with a signet or
[56:37] with a private marks not only have we
[56:39] got a signal in our hand
[56:40] but we're being sealed with a signal god
[56:43] says this
[56:44] is my bride she is part of me
[56:47] devil no trespassing you can't take
[56:49] their souls you can't take their faith
[56:51] in me
[56:52] i remember he has a right to your mind
[56:54] he has a right to make you sick
[56:55] make you trouble but he can't touch that
[56:57] soul amen so just because you have mind
[57:00] bells doesn't mean you're not a
[57:01] christian
[57:02] doesn't mean you're not an overcomer you
[57:03] know there's going to be a lot of
[57:04] battles before this war is finished
[57:06] i mean but the conclusion is victory is
[57:08] certain
[57:09] i like how brother paul says that
[57:11] victory is certain hallelujah so we know
[57:13] we're on the winning side you know
[57:14] i've been thinking a lot about you know
[57:16] i wonder when you know
[57:18] in wars you take great great conflicts
[57:20] when the losing side realizes they can't
[57:22] win
[57:24] you know it may not look like it on the
[57:26] outside but there comes a time when
[57:28] one side realizes we don't have the
[57:30] manpower we don't have the firepower we
[57:32] don't have the resources we cannot
[57:33] sustain this conflict
[57:35] and the devil's got to come surely to a
[57:37] point he won't say it on the outside
[57:40] remember like get in here you know
[57:42] gideon had a dream where that well you
[57:43] know that thing rolled into the camp of
[57:45] the enemy
[57:46] and i know actually the enemy had the
[57:47] dream who knows the story gideon went
[57:49] down to search out the camp
[57:50] and then he's there and the other had
[57:52] two guards of the enemy camp saying i
[57:54] had a dream last night what was the
[57:55] dream well
[57:56] this thing rolled down to camp but it
[57:58] destroyed the whole camp and you know
[57:59] and then the other guy interpreted the
[58:00] dream saying well actually that's
[58:02] gideon's going to destroy us basically
[58:04] it didn't they didn't show it on the
[58:05] outside but actually their their defeat
[58:07] had already been foretold
[58:09] hallelujah you know and then even even
[58:12] rahab would give the report to the spies
[58:14] of of of the morale of the
[58:16] soldiers of jericho on the outside that
[58:19] their helmets on their weapons ready
[58:21] though they're on the battlements ready
[58:22] to fight
[58:23] but she told the spies the hearts of all
[58:25] the men have actually
[58:27] melted gone all because of you
[58:31] hallelujah so the devil may look like a
[58:33] tough burly fellow on the outside but on
[58:34] the inside he's gone
[58:37] hallelujah how do you break an army you
[58:39] break its spirit
[58:41] yeah sure it can bluff a lot but if you
[58:43] break its spirit it's gone
[58:45] hallelujah and we our enemy is a he's
[58:47] got a broken spur
[58:49] amen sure he'll bluff it to the end
[58:51] he'll bluff it all the way to the lake
[58:53] of fire when he's thrown in but hey
[58:55] he must realize surely we read in the
[58:58] scripture he's been cast down to the
[58:59] earth i think we didn't read that
[59:00] actually the next verse there in
[59:02] revelations 12 but he's come down to the
[59:04] earth with great angers he knows he has
[59:06] but a short
[59:07] time now wouldn't you think if you're
[59:10] going to win
[59:11] that you wouldn't run out of time
[59:14] right but he knows he's got a short time
[59:17] so
[59:18] he knows actually it's it's it's
[59:21] victory ahead but not for me but he
[59:24] doesn't show that
[59:25] that's why the prophet always told us
[59:27] you've got to call the devil's bluff
[59:29] you've got to call us bluffs how many
[59:31] times will the prophet stand and say
[59:33] satan
[59:34] my lord jesus defeated you that down
[59:36] calvary
[59:37] sure you don't mind me but you mind the
[59:39] one that's you know
[59:40] has sent me and the blood of jesus
[59:43] christ defeated you that day you're
[59:44] still a defeated being take your hands
[59:46] off god's property
[59:47] and the devil had to take his hands off
[59:49] god's property amen and that same
[59:51] authority to cast the devil out is in
[59:53] the bride of christ today
[59:54] amen hallelujah the apostle paul would
[59:58] write in the book of ephesians i'm
[1:00:00] trying to
[1:00:02] get through this ephesians 3 8 it says
[1:00:04] unto me
[1:00:05] whom less and least of all saints is
[1:00:07] this grace given
[1:00:09] that i should preach among the gentiles
[1:00:11] the unsearchable riches of christ and to
[1:00:14] make
[1:00:14] all men see what is the fellowship of
[1:00:16] the mystery which from the beginning of
[1:00:18] the world hath been hidden god who
[1:00:20] created all things by jesus christ
[1:00:22] to the intent that now unto the
[1:00:25] principalities and powers in heavenly
[1:00:27] places might be known by the church
[1:00:30] the manifold wisdom of god so the
[1:00:33] apostle paul is saying that now is a
[1:00:35] time
[1:00:36] that you're going to know all the powers
[1:00:38] in heavenly places at your disposal
[1:00:40] amen the prince of powers and powers in
[1:00:42] heavenly places might be known by the
[1:00:44] church the manifold wisdom of god now
[1:00:46] we know when god teaches anything it's
[1:00:49] not just theory
[1:00:50] it's it's practical so god wants to
[1:00:53] prove to you your position
[1:00:54] amen he wants to prove to you the power
[1:00:57] and dominion you have over satan all the
[1:00:59] hordes of hell
[1:01:00] amen that's why he sent but the reason
[1:01:03] that he would do this
[1:01:04] is not that you would just rejoice that
[1:01:06] the devils are subject to you like the
[1:01:08] apostles said when they came back when
[1:01:10] they were
[1:01:10] anointed by the lord to go and cast out
[1:01:13] devils
[1:01:13] they don't rejoice and this really but
[1:01:16] rejoice that your names are written in
[1:01:17] heaven
[1:01:18] hallelujah so now now the manifold um
[1:01:22] the principals and powers in heavenly
[1:01:23] places might be known by the church
[1:01:26] ultimately is that our names are written
[1:01:27] in heaven
[1:01:29] right and because our names are written
[1:01:31] in heaven
[1:01:32] then the devil must be subject unto us
[1:01:34] amen
[1:01:36] hallelujah well what about judas sure he
[1:01:39] was given that authority but he didn't
[1:01:40] go all the way to pentecost
[1:01:42] what about those who have gone all the
[1:01:43] way to pentecost
[1:01:45] right hallelujah because of your seal to
[1:01:48] the day of your redemption then
[1:01:49] therefore
[1:01:50] you are sealed until you get where into
[1:01:52] glory
[1:01:54] you are sealed to the day of your until
[1:01:56] you get to your destination
[1:01:58] and nothing can break that seal remember
[1:02:00] brother kaidra at that camp you says
[1:02:01] it's like
[1:02:02] you know the devil can do this to you
[1:02:04] and he can do this to you you know and
[1:02:06] he can do all kinds of things but
[1:02:08] that seal's still there amen you know
[1:02:10] brother braham said that a man or woman
[1:02:12] can be so surrendered to god till even
[1:02:14] the devil doesn't know what to do with
[1:02:15] him
[1:02:16] that means i'll plague them with this
[1:02:17] i'll give them this sickness i'll give
[1:02:19] them this trouble
[1:02:20] trouble in the family trouble from their
[1:02:21] past trouble in this whatever
[1:02:23] sickness cancer trouble all these things
[1:02:26] but then somehow this person because
[1:02:28] they stay surrendered to god
[1:02:29] they just go through it you know
[1:02:32] we may not necessarily you know when i
[1:02:34] used to sail when i was young
[1:02:36] we didn't i didn't surf every wave
[1:02:38] sometimes i submarined through a lot
[1:02:40] but the boat was still there i was still
[1:02:42] alive
[1:02:44] so sometimes we may not crest every wave
[1:02:46] sometimes we may submarine right through
[1:02:47] it
[1:02:48] but that's all right as long as we come
[1:02:49] out the other side and god will cause us
[1:02:51] to come out the other side
[1:02:53] amen hallelujah amen praise the lord
[1:02:57] you know you come to a realization you
[1:03:00] know my dad always told me when i was
[1:03:01] getting my sea legs said
[1:03:02] the worst thing that can happen is you
[1:03:04] just get wet
[1:03:06] you know everything's all right and you
[1:03:08] come to a front
[1:03:09] yeah that's right actually well there's
[1:03:11] a few other things but you know
[1:03:13] but you know really god has our lives in
[1:03:15] his hands
[1:03:16] when you really think about this great
[1:03:18] god that made all things
[1:03:20] hallelujah created time and space and
[1:03:22] you know for ordained you you know
[1:03:24] i love it where he speaks to job you
[1:03:25] know job has all these questions on his
[1:03:27] mind he doesn't know what's going on in
[1:03:29] his life and
[1:03:30] god doesn't come down and address those
[1:03:32] he says where were you
[1:03:34] when i created the you know you know
[1:03:36] laid the foundation of the world and the
[1:03:38] sons of god
[1:03:39] you know sang for joy and you know and
[1:03:41] you know and he's trying to get job to
[1:03:43] see job
[1:03:44] you were with me and not just with me
[1:03:46] you were in my mind
[1:03:48] when i made all things when the lamb was
[1:03:49] slammed before the foundation of the
[1:03:51] world amen
[1:03:52] when that lamb was slaying your name was
[1:03:55] written on the book of the lamb
[1:03:56] amen before the foundation of the world
[1:03:58] amen you're part of me job
[1:04:00] i saw you rejoicing i saw you praising
[1:04:03] god yeah i saw you being your being
[1:04:04] thankful rejoicing to having victory
[1:04:06] over the enemy
[1:04:08] hallelujah and what does this message
[1:04:10] come to do it's come to get us to see
[1:04:12] that we have come from god we're going
[1:04:13] back to god i mean that's why brother
[1:04:16] brown the last part of his ministry he
[1:04:17] had
[1:04:18] he you know he'd use this phrase you're
[1:04:20] a predestined seed gene of god
[1:04:22] amen and he used it quite a lot the last
[1:04:25] yo 1965 i believe in there
[1:04:27] because he's trying to get the bride to
[1:04:28] see you're predestinated so your destiny
[1:04:31] is predetermined
[1:04:33] yep what what is that destiny to him
[1:04:35] that overcometh
[1:04:36] will sit on my throne with me as i sat
[1:04:39] down on my father's
[1:04:40] throne so our destiny is we're going to
[1:04:42] come through life but we're
[1:04:43] made to be an overcomer you know people
[1:04:46] are just built a certain way
[1:04:47] you know you take a first 15 team the
[1:04:50] prop is built to be a prop
[1:04:52] right the lock is built you know he's up
[1:04:54] here the props out here
[1:04:55] you know the fly half is here but
[1:04:57] they're all but they're but their body
[1:04:59] shape
[1:05:00] they're built to be that position you
[1:05:02] know you see world
[1:05:03] class rowers are uh this big kind of
[1:05:06] this why they're just machines but
[1:05:08] they're built to be rowers
[1:05:09] and normally if it's the one that's got
[1:05:11] a cox on the end who just says stroke
[1:05:13] stroke
[1:05:13] you know they aren't these big mammoth
[1:05:17] people they're these little buddy
[1:05:18] fellows but they're built to be a
[1:05:21] right who's following me you know we're
[1:05:24] built a certain way
[1:05:25] we've got certain qualities that the
[1:05:27] devil don't know nothing about
[1:05:29] i mean certain qualities and i'm not
[1:05:30] talking about physical qualities i'm
[1:05:32] talking about
[1:05:32] in our soul kind of qualities and to be
[1:05:35] part of this word
[1:05:36] amen hallelujah we've been built to do a
[1:05:39] job
[1:05:41] amen that job is to be a serpent bruiser
[1:05:43] all the days of our life
[1:05:45] hallelujah amen
[1:05:48] according now sorry we're going back to
[1:05:50] um ephesians 3 and 10 to the intent that
[1:05:53] now unto the principalities and powers
[1:05:55] in heavenly places
[1:05:56] might be known by the church and the uh
[1:05:58] the manifold wisdom of god
[1:06:00] according to the eternal purpose which
[1:06:03] he purposed in christ jesus our lord
[1:06:05] in whom we have boldness and access with
[1:06:07] confidence by the faith of him
[1:06:09] it says in ephesians 2 but god who's
[1:06:11] rich in mercy
[1:06:12] for his great lover and he loved us even
[1:06:15] when we were dead in sins hath quickened
[1:06:17] us together with christ
[1:06:18] by grace ye are saved and has raised us
[1:06:21] up together
[1:06:22] and made us sit together in heavenly
[1:06:24] places in christ jesus so he's actually
[1:06:26] made us to sit in this position
[1:06:28] this is not us saying i want to sit in
[1:06:29] heavenly places in christ jesus no god
[1:06:32] says i'm going to make you sit there
[1:06:34] i mean and this this heavenly places
[1:06:37] if you look in the book of ephesians
[1:06:38] it's also the same word where it speaks
[1:06:41] about high places
[1:06:42] so when it says in ephesians 10 i mean
[1:06:44] sorry ephesians 6 and 10
[1:06:46] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:06:48] lord and the power of his might put on
[1:06:50] the whole armor of god
[1:06:51] that ye may be able to stand against the
[1:06:53] wiles of the devil for we wrestle not
[1:06:55] against flesh and blood
[1:06:57] but against principalities against
[1:06:59] powers against the rulers of the
[1:07:00] darkness of this world
[1:07:02] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:07:04] places now that word high place is the
[1:07:06] same as
[1:07:06] heavenly places so what happened is adam
[1:07:09] and eve were in heavenly place in christ
[1:07:10] jesus but then they fell
[1:07:12] the devil took their place as a god over
[1:07:15] the earth
[1:07:15] but now the roles are being switched by
[1:07:17] the blood of jesus christ right the word
[1:07:19] has actually literally taken us
[1:07:21] from being the devil's whipping boy to
[1:07:24] now we are the head and he's the tail
[1:07:26] amen hallelujah so the devil's been
[1:07:30] squatting
[1:07:31] in heavenly places in our place of power
[1:07:33] and authority
[1:07:35] but now there's a people on the earth
[1:07:36] who are kicking him out of that place
[1:07:38] i mean that's why you know that's why
[1:07:40] there's always opposition when you go
[1:07:42] and take a promise of god
[1:07:44] there's always opposition you've got
[1:07:45] sickness in your body the devil tells
[1:07:47] you no you can't have it
[1:07:49] all you got you know you want to find
[1:07:50] peace for your soul he says no you can't
[1:07:52] have it
[1:07:52] you need the baptism the holy ghost says
[1:07:54] no you can't have it what's that as the
[1:07:55] devil trying to kick you out of getting
[1:07:57] into that position
[1:07:59] amen but we've got to recognize we have
[1:08:00] a god who wants us in that place
[1:08:03] he said i will i i i wish above all you
[1:08:05] prosper in health
[1:08:07] hallelujah didn't he say that amen and
[1:08:09] he said all that the father has given me
[1:08:12] will come to me
[1:08:12] and all that comes to me i'll know why
[1:08:14] it's cast out so it means all that come
[1:08:16] to me i'm going to give the holy ghost
[1:08:17] to
[1:08:17] amen that's how i read the scripture
[1:08:20] amen but the devil try and say it's not
[1:08:21] for you
[1:08:22] you've gone too far you've done done too
[1:08:24] much wrong how can you you know you have
[1:08:26] no right to it but that's just the devil
[1:08:28] trying to kick you off your promise
[1:08:30] amen just like a nested there was a lot
[1:08:32] of enemies that still had authority to
[1:08:34] try and kill them but
[1:08:35] they had to write another law amen that
[1:08:37] they could actually defeat their enemy
[1:08:39] amen hallelujah i'm gonna um he says in
[1:08:42] god of this evil age
[1:08:44] and the entire word of god and complete
[1:08:46] was headed up in a body called jesus
[1:08:48] christ
[1:08:48] and their god made me pay for my sins
[1:08:51] and am there
[1:08:52] then he rose me raised me up with him in
[1:08:54] the resurrection
[1:08:55] and now we are seated with him with
[1:08:57] power and authority over
[1:08:58] every devil say every devil
[1:09:02] we have power and authority over every
[1:09:04] devil oh
[1:09:05] if we could only believe what god has
[1:09:07] given i believe our eyes are coming open
[1:09:09] though
[1:09:10] but if you're not seated there you don't
[1:09:12] have it and if you but if you're seated
[1:09:13] there and don't believe it and afraid to
[1:09:15] move it you'll never use it
[1:09:16] but if you are seated there you will use
[1:09:18] it for your ordained to do
[1:09:20] what you do yeah just like i just comes
[1:09:23] to mind you know the testimony of
[1:09:25] christine's sister melanie
[1:09:26] seeking the holy ghost she went for you
[1:09:28] know alter calls and things so many
[1:09:30] times and
[1:09:30] you know she's so hungry to you know but
[1:09:32] she was afraid that the devil would try
[1:09:34] and come and get her
[1:09:35] you know if if he you know if she ever
[1:09:38] said get behind me satan
[1:09:39] yeah and then there was one time where
[1:09:41] where elana ran into christine's room if
[1:09:43] i get this wrong you can you know she'll
[1:09:44] line this out later but you know
[1:09:46] you know yeah alana had just given her
[1:09:48] heart to the lord
[1:09:50] and then something happened and she
[1:09:51] comes into christine's room says i'm not
[1:09:52] going to be a christian anymore
[1:09:53] i'm not going to be a christian anymore
[1:09:55] and then christie says well do you want
[1:09:56] to pray i don't know if god's real and
[1:09:58] you know and then she just said without
[1:09:59] thinking do you want to pray and then
[1:10:00] they begin to pray the prince of god
[1:10:02] came down
[1:10:03] and they were shouting and rejoicing and
[1:10:04] melanie was sharing christine's room
[1:10:06] she got up started praying and she was
[1:10:08] seeking the holy ghost but
[1:10:10] you know the devil was there to try and
[1:10:12] stop her receiving it
[1:10:14] and so she was afraid that if if so
[1:10:17] melanie was afraid
[1:10:18] that if she ever said satan get behind
[1:10:20] me satan will just grab her
[1:10:22] but she had to overcome that fear and
[1:10:23] say satan get behind me i'm going to get
[1:10:25] the holy ghost yo because the devil was
[1:10:26] telling her
[1:10:27] you won't get it you've done this many
[1:10:29] times you're not going to get it and she
[1:10:30] said satan get behind me in the name of
[1:10:32] jesus christ the holy ghost fell on her
[1:10:34] and made her a new creature
[1:10:35] why the devil was squatting on her
[1:10:37] promise and she had to cast him off the
[1:10:40] promise to get the promise
[1:10:42] hallelujah amen that's what we've got to
[1:10:45] do too
[1:10:46] yes i've been walking with the lord for
[1:10:47] a long time you've still got to cast the
[1:10:49] devil off your promise
[1:10:50] there's more promises to obtain amen and
[1:10:53] we're going to keep kicking the devil
[1:10:54] off until these bodies are changed
[1:10:58] that's right amy we're gonna put into
[1:11:00] law put it into action just like esther
[1:11:02] had to
[1:11:03] i mean she can just sit there with a
[1:11:05] signet ring and say well someone else
[1:11:07] will do it no
[1:11:07] she was placed in a position to save her
[1:11:10] people
[1:11:12] hallelujah amen and that's how we've got
[1:11:15] to be you know
[1:11:16] people say well i've done too much wrong
[1:11:18] i can never return brother ram says if
[1:11:20] you're a son you have a right to return
[1:11:22] if you're a son and daughter of god it
[1:11:23] doesn't matter what you've done where
[1:11:25] you've gone what you've said what you've
[1:11:26] done
[1:11:27] he said if you're a son and daughter of
[1:11:28] god you've got a right to return
[1:11:30] you've got a right to a jubilee you've
[1:11:32] got a right to come back have you got a
[1:11:33] right to meet the living god because
[1:11:35] you're a son or daughter of god
[1:11:36] nothing can keep you from the promise
[1:11:38] hallelujah so we have a right you say
[1:11:40] i've gone too much well no no
[1:11:42] even the apostle paul said i was a
[1:11:43] blasphemer i made others blaspheme put
[1:11:46] them in prison did great havoc against
[1:11:48] the church
[1:11:49] but god did not change his mind about
[1:11:50] the apostle paul amen
[1:11:52] hallelujah
[1:11:55] if he's made up his mind about you he
[1:11:57] doesn't change his mind about you he
[1:11:58] cannot change his mind about you
[1:12:01] amen even if your past is very much
[1:12:03] still alive
[1:12:04] yeah god don't even attribute it to you
[1:12:07] if you've got the new birth
[1:12:08] hallelujah when when when abraham
[1:12:11] was told by god to take isaac and go off
[1:12:14] from up up
[1:12:15] up on the mountain he said take your son
[1:12:18] your only son
[1:12:20] now hold on let's just go back to that
[1:12:22] view
[1:12:23] we could say hold on god what about
[1:12:25] ishmael
[1:12:28] abraham is the biological father of
[1:12:30] ishmael
[1:12:31] they could do a dna test right
[1:12:34] but that was abram's son it was the same
[1:12:38] body
[1:12:39] but he was a different man right but his
[1:12:42] name was change and that
[1:12:43] h is actually the breath of god was
[1:12:45] breathing to abraham
[1:12:46] so abram was changed to abraham the
[1:12:48] breath of god was breathed and that's
[1:12:50] what the h
[1:12:51] represents and so his name was changed
[1:12:54] because he received a new birth
[1:12:56] heller so when his name was changed his
[1:12:58] past wasn't attributed to him anymore
[1:13:01] it was attributed to abram it wasn't it
[1:13:04] could not be attributed to abraham
[1:13:05] because he was a new creature in christ
[1:13:08] hallelujah that's why god said take your
[1:13:11] son isaac your only son and go offer him
[1:13:13] up on the hill
[1:13:14] but ishmael was running around talk his
[1:13:16] pass go talk to him
[1:13:19] hey dad how you doing think about it
[1:13:22] you say well yeah my past is very much
[1:13:24] alive and god's mind is dead
[1:13:26] yes amen hallelujah amen
[1:13:29] hallelujah so you know we don't we don't
[1:13:32] need to worry about
[1:13:33] our past we're new creatures in christ
[1:13:35] jesus if the devil tries to bring that
[1:13:37] thing up again no no you've got to kick
[1:13:39] him off
[1:13:40] say satan i'll tell you where you're
[1:13:42] going satan you can't be born again
[1:13:44] satan there's no blood for you you've
[1:13:46] got no atonement you've got no advocate
[1:13:48] you've got no high priest like me
[1:13:50] hallelujah and you have a right to kick
[1:13:53] the devil off
[1:13:54] now i'm just going to leave it there but
[1:13:56] i just want to just put it to you
[1:13:57] who's got the ring on their finger amen
[1:14:00] brother ram said that we
[1:14:01] actually received a wedding band of
[1:14:03] unmerited pre-destiny grace before the
[1:14:06] foundation of the world
[1:14:08] hallelujah so you've got the signet ring
[1:14:10] already on you didn't even realize it
[1:14:14] amen the lord said whatsoever ye say
[1:14:18] amen whatever you loose on loose in
[1:14:21] earth shall be loosed in heaven while
[1:14:23] you bind another shall be bound in
[1:14:24] heaven
[1:14:25] if you say to this mouth if two agree on
[1:14:28] earth concerning anything
[1:14:30] i'll do it he says i will not withhold
[1:14:33] anything from them that walk uprightly
[1:14:35] amen well is that up rightly based on my
[1:14:38] performance and
[1:14:40] and and my thought pattern over the date
[1:14:41] no the blood of jesus christ makes us
[1:14:44] walk uprightly
[1:14:46] hallelujah it's not us trying to obtain
[1:14:48] some nirvana state in our own ability
[1:14:50] and then now we can we can stomp on
[1:14:52] every devil that comes against us no
[1:14:54] it's god that places in the places us in
[1:14:56] that position
[1:14:57] yes sir but we have to use that position
[1:15:01] hallelujah and this is the season this
[1:15:03] is the bride's hour
