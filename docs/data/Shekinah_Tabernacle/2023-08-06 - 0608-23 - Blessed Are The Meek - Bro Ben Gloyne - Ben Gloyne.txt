friend amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen so we're in for a good day I mean we can't have our cake and eat it too so praise the Lord amen thank you brother Isaac thanks musicians appreciate it amen praise the Lord we're just going to read one piece of scripture before we uh then then you're gonna pray and you can have your seats so we're going to read one so Matthew 5 and verse 5 I'm sure most of us could recite it um verbatim and so the Bible says here blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth now it's not the size of the text it's what's in the text that counts amen the word is eternal so amen so we're just going to read that one scripture there so let's just bow heads in the word of prayer this morning if you ever need you want to raise it uh before the Lord with uplifted hand make your request be known amen let's pray gracious father we thank you dear God that we can truly say we're no longer slaves to fear Lord we're no longer controlled by any element of the devil lord Jesus but we are your children we are your sons and your daughters by your grace and we're so thankful we can bow our heads in your presence Lord and say thank you Lord for saving us for redeeming us oh God finding us calling us out of Darkness to walk with you when we love you with all our hearts today we just want to ask Fathers as we've read your word may you the great author of your word come anoint your word Lord anoint speaker and hear a father may take control of the service Lord any Spirit here that's not of you take it from take it from this room in the name of Jesus Christ o god father may your full Liberty Lord we just want to commit Our Lives into your hands forgive us of our sins and our wrongs Lord May our whole lives be covered in your blood dear God and may have your way father and those who are not here with us this morning Lord be their portion be their strength father Lord if their second body raise them up o god father meet their needs too Lord we love you and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats this morning so I want to talk about meekness and meekness is not a weakness you know some people think you know there is a an element of human meekness which is a weakness because people just get pushed around but we know that true meekness is not is not a negative trait but as the Lord said here blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth so in other words they will go on the Rapture they'll be in the Millennium then they'll go to the new hymns in the earth so we'll adhere it all think so you know just when you read the Beatitudes speaking of the character of a Believer amen so so meekness is a powerful a very powerful attribute to possess now um so that they a Bible dictionary says it's a mildness of disposition a gentleness of spirit it's a meekness so it's not someone that flies off the handle all the time you know someone maybe uh you know driving slow in front of you and just fly off the handle with road rage and that kind of thing that's not meekness that's just road rage but just hey let them drive you know we all want to get somewhere don't we and you want that person to get somewhere too so you know so you know so we shouldn't be too too crazy at this position you know see-sawing from nothing to extremes and you know shouting and jumping and angry and then nothing and then yeah we don't want to be like that we don't want to be like the weather we want to be the same yeah in every situation amen then then a good old Mr Wikipedia said meekness is an attribute of human nature and behavior that has been defined as a elegant and I had to see what that word is it's a mixture of of righteousness and a humility and patience meekness has been contrasted with humility alone and so much as humility simply refers to an attitude towards oneself a restraining of One's Own power so as to allow room for others now we know true humility is letting God's word rule your life amen so that's the allowing room for others whether there's only one other which is God so you let the word of God rule your life that's true humility whereas meekness refers to the treatment of others amen so we want to have a Meek disposition towards one another and not just one another but to anyone we come across in life amen they you know I trusted our that our testimony is that we are a humble Meek people amen which is not a put on it's not a manufactured meekness but it's a but it's a holy ghost meekness I mean where God comes and lives in a person's life now these things are very important because we're living in an hour where the third pool will be manifested the power of the spoken word that is Among Us will will will will take full control amen where it's more than just a you know it's where God because remember everything that was manifested in Jesus Christ power over nature power over the devil power over death all those things amen because he was the he was the second Adam right so he says he displayed everything that the first Adam lost Dominion right but now he'll take a church the second Eve and place her into that position as well but you see the power of the spoken word is not just saying now what do I feel like today let there be McDonald's or let there be a new house or let there be a new car that's not the power of the spoken word the power spoken word is when you're surrendered to God and God speaks through you pray through you that is through you what he wants to do remember when you receive the Holy Ghost it's not you can try calling the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost controlling you amen as the Apostle Paul would say Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ and he was a prison not because he was in a prison but because he was a prisoner to the will of God remember he wanted to go to a certain place but they said the spirit forbade him to go so even even the Holy Ghost he was so surrendered that he didn't even do his own will amen so that's how we want to be amen because now we understand there's a lot of Supernatural in this day not just in Christian Realms but but in different religions is Supernatural but there's things that the devil cannot impersonate and there comes a point like we're just going to speak here here about Moses Moses calling the children of Israel out of Egypt now we know that there were two you know the other court magicians of pharaoh and they did they did Supernatural things and and Paul would write to Timothy about it saying as Janice and jambres were stood Moses so these would resist the truth right but there came a point where The Magicians could not do what Moses could do amen they could throw this um um staffs down turned into snakes while Moses snake swallowed their snakes up and then it turned back into a staff where did their staffs go into his staff right so there's different things they could do but there came a point where they could not impersonate they could not copy what Moses did and so it says here now and The Magicians did so with the enchantments to bring forth life but they could not so there was lies upon man and upon beasts in the magician said unto Pharaoh this is the Finger of God so they realize this is greater than we can even do so there comes a point whether where Satan cannot impersonate a certain thing and and and and that thing that he cannot impersonate is he cannot impersonate the word of God where he can impersonate any gift you know people are you know people who speak in tongues it's not necessarily the Holy Ghost it can be a demon power speaking but we believe in speaking in tongues we believe in Prophecy and different things but what Spirits motivated we believe in dancing but what spirit's motivating the dance you know we believe in the the full manifestations of all the holy spirit because it's in the word but it's got to be the Holy Ghost doing it see amen so so the devil can impersonate anything but he cannot impersonate the third pull I mean he cannot impersonate the word right he cannot impersonate that word because if he could then he'd be a believer if he really believed the word and took God at his word so that's why we've got to stay with the word man shall not live by bread Lumber everywhere that proceeds out of the mouth of God the word must be the Bible must be our absolute it must be our typos it must be our everything not our opinion not culture not ideas but it must be the word of God Amen so Satan can but you see it's not just the ink on paper that he can't impersonate it's actually talk about the character of the word coming into a people the word putting on flesh in a people that's why Jesus died amen that he would wash our sins away but then his his Spirit his life would come into you and I and he'd be the Christian in you and I because that's the only way we can be christ-like if it's Christ himself is in you and I otherwise we're just being a copy or a mimic we're not here to be mimics we're here to be genuine Christians amen so he can impersonate anything but he can't but not that word so he can impersonate any gift he can do all those things but you know shouting speaking in tongues different things but it can still be wrong amen and so the thing he cannot so just like those magicians there in in Egypt they they came to a point they couldn't impersonate what Moses was doing and now it'll come down to a point now that they will not be able to uh impersonate the third pull now the third pull is the power of the spoken word which is just the greater of what we already have I mean so for example there's the five instances of the uh manifestation of the third pool and brother Brown's Ministry we know one was he spoke a tumor out of his wife's side that was the size of a grapefruit she's on the other end of the country in America and the Holy Ghost came down and says speak and it shall be and and he just prayed Lord when she's on the operating table before the surgeon ever cuts her aside now she had a tumor the size of a grapefruit in her inner side when the surgeon goes to cut her may just disappear and the surgeon went to cut and the and the whole thing disappeared and he had to look at X-rays and see it says there's no tumor here anymore so that is just a greater magnitude of laying on of hands anointing with oil see it's just a greater of what's already here right the same with speaking the fish you know life you know different things he did right and now we know that the third pull has been manifested in our midst right we know it's it's it's here right we've seen it manifested amen so but the devil can't impersonate it people will try and impersonate it but it takes the character of Christ in a person because he can't impersonate real Christianity but he tries we know that amen see but you see now and now we're living in a time we'll be where it will be manifested in the fullness of its power so it's very important we keep these things in mind because we gotta we need to have the character of Christ right shall we become newborn babes in the Lord we get birth in the Kingdom by the Holy Ghost we've got to mature and grow that God can have his full Reign who wants goddamn full reign in their life who wants God to take control but it's no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me amen because but the thing is we know that character because remember we we need to have the character of Christ we know character is a victory it's not a gift it's not just given to you now you have the character of Christ it's a victory and that Victory is actually over your own self remember the devil was defeated that down Calvary he's still defeated today he's still a loser today as he was then he's conquered so what now has to be conquered our own human will our own human ability our own human what we want remember Jesus greatest remember Calvary the resurrection was one when the Lord Jesus was in Gethsemane he said not my will but thy will be done see and that and so so because to me the greatest Miracle of the Lord Jesus ever did it wasn't feeding the multitudes it wasn't raising Lazarus wasn't doing all the incredible it was he subjected his own body to the word of God that he had to fulfill remember he was he was fully God but he was fully man right he was the god man but he had to subject these human elements to the word of God and he knew what he had to fulfill right he knew because Moses and Elijah told them about Transfiguration the things he had to accomplish in Jerusalem and remember he said the son could do nothing but what the father shows them and what the and what the father does the son does likewise that means he was led by a vision so he saw Calvary everything by vision and he knew what he was going to suffer but yet he subjected himself to that and it was all prophecy being fulfilled amen so if we want if we want the character of Christ which is fit to rule amen we must have we must be surrendered to the word of God because remember power without character is satanic now I've been speaking the last few services on humility and and and and not being selfish and so on and and I've taken Ezekiel 28 but the other parts after this here but it's amazing here where where the Lord is speaking to the prince of Tyrus there and he's not just speaking to the man but the anointing on the man but look at this it's amazing how how um in verse 3 here it says behold Thou Art wiser than Daniel and there is no secret that they can hide from thee so here's a man you look at Daniel Daniel had such wisdom he saw from the beginning to the end he saw the same things John saw in the Book of Revelation he saw incredible things he's a very wise man he was such a wise man he was he was under the king in Babylon and then when the medes and Persians came and they hired him to run the place too he was a very wise man but you see this Prince of Tyrus was even wiser than Daniel but then what did he do with the wisdom he collected riches he got gold and silver and all these things so he just increased his own kingdom with the wisdom that God gave him he didn't use it for God's benefit he didn't use it for other people's benefit he used it for his own benefit so he didn't have the character to rule he didn't have the character to use that wisdom and so people can be very gifted people they can preach they can sing they can do incredible things but do they have the character to go with the gift that God gave them because remember a gift the gift and calling gifts and calling a guider without repentance so someone has a gift before they repentance has got nothing to do with it that's why there's great gifts in the earth and they're not Christians they're atheists or whatever more very gifted people very wealthy people very famous people very gifted people but what have they done with that gift see so we're going to be we're gonna say Lord take my life whatever you've made me to be Lord may may you just come and live out of my life amen so yeah this man was wiser than Daniel but yet he used it for his own ability and we we must be very careful we never get into that position but we think the Lord use us the way he wants us to be now brother bran would speak in a um in in one place and he's speaking about after the seals have come open he's had a lot of rejection you know from people and different things and and he's saying there's got to be a change and he's speaking to some extra young people he says there's got to be a change in me that I get a feeling back for the people again and so whatever everything that God has there's got to be a change of us to match the word right and that's not just Doctrine that's attitudes that's that's our temperament our character right anything that's not of God that's got to be taken away that God can live see we're all built differently God is not a cookie cutter amen but the thing is there's parts of our nature that got to be taken away family strain's got to be taken away you see family strains of stubbornness or indifference or anger or whatever it is those things are going to be taken out but you're going to let God take it out because sometimes we can say well I'm just born this way this is how I am no maybe in your mind but in God's mind he says no I I want you to match my word but the only way you can match my word is if you yield to me that I can mold you remember he's the Potter and we are the clay it's not the other way around but it's good to feel his hands isn't it molding and shaping and changing and sure it may feel a bit uncomfortable when he pulls the handle around he picks the picks you up and molds you this way oh my you feel the hands of Jehovah in your life but it's good because he's got he's got an image in mind amen that image is you being made in the image of his word amen so he says God will never change the ministry but he'll change the man with the ministry that's what's to be done amen so he's got to change us to match the ministry in the end time amen which is the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ Living living in people because we know when God comes and he does a great change in our lives he's had that experience I mean God's done a great change the person you were you're not that guy no more he's dead you're this this new guy because remember when you meet the Lord really now it's a journey of Discovery who am I Lord what have you made me to be you know and and that's why you walk with God here begins to show you who you are and what he's made you to be and the power of His grace Amen to me his grace just gets greater the more you walk with him the more you appreciate him the more you love him amen Hallelujah Cece we're gonna um look at ourselves and say you know well I believe I've got the Holy Ghost and you see it don't bear and you see it don't bear the fruit of meekness and yield it and kindness and gentleness and forgiveness and so forth then it's time for you to shake out of yourself so you gotta look and say now what's what's producing in my life am I still grumpy at nothing am I still angry have I still got all these triggers in my life that you know people talk about triggers you've got these emotional triggers and your different triggers but but those things should not be triggers that's true you should be triggered and if there's a trigger you say Lord take it out of me even something is completely unrelated with something just tricky just explode or something you go into a shell or something and say Lord take those things out of me amen you know amen Our God's living who's happy today praise the Lord amen do a work remember I preached to me too you know that actually I preach to me and you guys just happen to turn up you know because I want to be made in the image of the Lord I want to bear his likeness amen if he said I'll make you like me you think about him never a man like him there never can be a man like him his character now he was the meekest man but he wasn't a pushover and and we're going to get into that he wasn't something just got like like a plastic but I guess we don't have them anymore these days but you see a plastic bag blowing in the wind that's not meekness that's not real Bible meekness that's just being a plastic bag blown or not we don't want to be like that amen so we gotta see it's the life that lives afterwards after experience that's the main thing amen we can shout we can jump we can speak in tongues we believe in all those things but what happens afterwards what life is produced afterwards see this is this is the main thing you see those who are filled with the Holy Ghost heard the word received it and lived by it amen they could become one with the word and it lived out of them I mean that's the main thing see but you see we're going to have an attitude of meekness even with receiving the word he says here now wherefore my beloved Brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God some people say I just got my holy indignation fired up or whatever you've got to be careful are you sure you know we'll leave that there well you got to be really careful wherefore lab puddle filthiness and souffluidity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls remember so meekness pardon me we heard was now it's it's your relation to others so true meeknesses now what is your relation to the word of God now to me it does time with humility quite a lot but what is your attitude towards the word Lord don't fill my head with a bunch of knowledge change my heart to match your word remember because this is a this is a love letter right it's not it's not laws and history and prophecy only no it's a love letter yeah and the old testament's a love letter too but you've got to receive the spirit of the author then you'll see it as a love leader and you know all those who are married or maybe you know going out with someone or you know courting whatever you know as you walk with the person you fall in love with them and the more you fall in love of them the more you want to be with them and the more you want to match together like this right and it's the same thing especially with us and the Lord the more we walk with him the more we love him and the more we love him the more we want to be like him Hallelujah and it's not us saying you know Jesus you've got to change to match my lifestyle there's no Lord change me to match you Hallelujah amen so eat brother bam says I've had the privilege in my Ministry to meet Great Men King's monarchs potentakes great men and I'd be trembling when I met them for the fear that I might say the wrong thing but I find out that when I come to men who are really which really are big men they are the humblest and the meekness meekest they make you feel like you're a great big somebody but it's that fellow who thinks he's a big man that you can't get along with oh he's just so big you can't touch him that's the way it goes but God the king of heaven so condescending that he will come to the lowest prostitute in the city on this cold night if she'd only asked to the bigger on the street anywhere that there is a need a sincerity towards him God will come there's no one too low that Jesus can't reach and he doesn't just reach down he gets down to their level I'm so thankful about that Hallelujah amen now we know it says about Moses Moses was the meekest man in all the Earth at that time we understand that he was raised in Pharaoh's Palace he had a he had one foot on the throne you could say he could have been the next Pharaoh now we know pharaohs in those days they were gods and flesh they just weren't Kings or pharaohs they were gods and flesh so can you imagine the Persona he had the the the the the the the um atmosphere around him as Prince Moses of you know of Egypt he wasn't a Meek little guy being pushed around he was a he was a God and flesh walking around people you know he led his troops into battle you know because the Royals he did in those days but you see when he met the Lord At The Burning Bush it took that out of him where when he met Christ he became the meekest man in all the Earth amen because that's what happens when Revelation comes into our lives it changes our character the character of Christ begins to be expressed so he was the meekest now most now the man Moses was very Meek above all the Earth which was I mean above all the men which are upon the face of the Earth so he is a very Meek man but you see when he was dealing with the Enemy he wasn't meek amen he didn't go on before pharaoh and say you know walking like this and now would you mind Mr Pharaoh sir you know this is like cruelty and it's not nice what you're doing to my people and would you consider I was just wondering hope you're having a good day no he went in there and said let my people go Amen Let My People Go pharaoh and if you don't I'm gonna plague your kingdom until you have to I'll make you let them go amen and that's why you know Pharaoh you can't see it here but but but on his crown there was there was a cobra right and that signified he was the king and that's why that's why God God turned Moses staff into the serpent is because God was actually showing two two Pharaoh actually to Satan and Pharaoh I can I can loose you and then I can bind you so I loose you I throw you on the ground you become a servant I pick you up you become a staff I can do whatever I want with you and that's what God was displaying through Moses and it wasn't just the Pharaoh it was actually to the enemy to Satan himself I can do what I want with you you have no control over me amen so he said let my people go he said no so I'll plague you no I'll plague you just keep going on and then you know the devil always tries to compromise just take your leave your young or leave your old or leave this one and Moses just said yeah and then and then pharaoh and said just just leave your animals and he said no we're not going to leave one hoof behind we're going to take our old we're going to take our young we're going to take our middle age we're going to take our teenagers we're going to take our parents we're going to take everyone with us we're going to leave this land and go to a Promised Land Hallelujah and that should be if we're Meek like God is Meek this should this should be our attitude towards Satan Satan my children are coming my family is coming my spouse is coming I don't care what's what they're stuck in they're coming out of it amen there were men in mud puts they're all kinds there and all kinds of different slavery but they all came out of that slavery Hallelujah amens that's how we should be this morning amen against the enemies he wasn't Meek with Pharaoh he didn't compromise with the Enemy you know we're not on a peacekeeping mission mission with the devil we're here to conquer this is total war this is total war war against the hordes of hell not against people now against Spirits very different thing but you see now Moses was so meek that he would stand in the gap for his people see this is what meekness can do remember it's your relation to others right so now he saw God basically said to him listen I'm just gonna I'm gonna start with you I'm sick of these guys I see you're sick of these guys I'm sick of these guys I'm going to wipe them out start with you and then he was so Meek he said Lord block mine I'd rather you just block my name out I mean if thou will forgive their sin and if not block me I pray the out of thy book which thou has written so take me out of your book of life Lord man what a prayer what a prayer you think about that basically he's saying destroy me burn me up what a prayer Hallelujah and to me that is if you're really Meek you can intercede you can throw yourself on the breach remember this was Christ in him interceding Hallelujah so if we're really a Meek people would say we won't say well they deserve it or maybe rough them up a little bit Lord you know give them no we're going to throw ourselves in the gap hallelujah it's just like when the I think with the brass serpents is the plague going through Israel you know and then and then and then and then um Moses told Aaron to take the sensor and run between the people because you're standing between the living and the dead and we're going to realize we're standing between the living and the dead this morning I mean those who are spiritually dead those are spiritually alive and we know prayer I mean a sensor speaks of prayer we can stand in the Gap Hallelujah your prayers count people amen you realize your prayers count Hallelujah but you see he's so Meek he said Lord take me out of the whole program Hallelujah amen I trust we have that same kind of spirit in US well I don't know they did this and this and this they may have all done those things and more besides but yet Lord amen forgive them Lord they don't know what they do amen the Lord Peter would say well the Lord Jesus would say through Peter that are Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price now to me that's just not talking about sisters that's talking about brothers too that's a great price to have that you know someone who thinks they're everything you know that Persona of I'm the man I'm the smartest I'm the strongest I'm the toughest I'm the roughest I'm the that's not a Meek and Gentle Spirit see that's not a that kind of personas is no value with God but those who are Meek and quiet Spirit surrendered to the word of God that's great price God says that's that that's very valuable because that's the opposite of Satan's personality I was looking at what's the op I just Google because I because I ask Google things I said what's the opposite of meekness and it said Pride arrogancy we don't want to be in that bracket we want to be a Meek people who's who's with me today you see when the Lord Jesus was baptized now I know I've spoken about these things before but he when he was baptized John said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world and then the Holy Spirit descended upon him like a dove now we know that both of those creatures have the same nature the lamb is the meekest of all the creatures of the earth and the dove is the meekest of all the fowls of Heaven of all the birds of heaven and that's the only way those two creatures could come together or why God symbolize himself as a lamb as a dove because they have the same natures and so in order for the Holy Ghost to rest upon us you think about the Lord Jesus now he fulfilled the scripture he had to fulfill we're here to fulfill the word too yeah not in terms of forgiving Our Lives as a sacrifice like he did but God works through man right God works through a man you see the book of Acts is not the acts the apostles it's the acts of the Holy Ghost and the apostles amen but you see Peter had to become meek here was the rugged fisherman who tried to cut the guy's ear off which looked good but actually it was an an antichrist move because he's trying to stop the word of God being fulfilled but you see God had to take him through that experience up to the upper room to make him Meek Amen to now God could use them when you know when Cornelius is praying in Acts chapter 10 and then an angel appears to him saying saying you know your prayers and arms have come up before God but go get Peter he'll tell you the words of eternal life so he was part of the body now Meek gentle humble Hallelujah where God could speak through and life could be given amen and while Peter has preached them about the Lord Jesus death burial Resurrection the Holy Ghost fell upon the Gentiles there they are sealed into the kingdom amen what eternal life was imparted well I threw a Meek part of the body but can you imagine if Peter was a buzzsaw wolf that would never have the law would never have sinned for him to go do that God couldn't use them in that kind of degree and it's the same thing with you and I if we want the Lord Jesus to not just anoint but abide we're going to become Meek we've got to have his nature and the only way we can have it because remember two Natures can't live in the same house right we're going to be willing to surrender our old nature surrender our past surrender our pain surrender surrender our humanity and say Lord change my nature to be meek and to be humble and to be like your nature and then what so and then and then and then now the holy egos can descend and take over isn't that what we want I mean to just dwell in the sweetness of his presence program season a couple of times he says you know um don't you don't you feel can't you feel that sweet that sweet feeling he says that's God that Meek feeling comes over you that's the presence of God amen and I don't know what's just happened up here that's fine amen we that's broken that's fine I don't need it we need to because remember this world wants to make us hard it wants to make us detached it wants to the problem with this world is there's very little empathy this afternoon but we'll just give you a preview this world has made it that we don't have any empathy anymore and so if there's no empathy there's no care and if they are perfect okay thank you appreciate that yo and and if there's no empathy then I could say the world is not Meek anymore remember this world is is so made that people we could just turn that off actually I don't I don't I don't need it um maybe we will but you know the thing is we we must have care for one another we must have care for our families we must have care for our classmates or for our work colleagues or anyone on the street we must have empathy don't ever become detached that you can't actually enter into someone's burden and feel for them if people are sad then it's good to be sad with them those we mourn with those who mourn we Rejoice with those who Rejoice amen but we should have a feeling but the thing is this world has been engineered that there's actually very little empathy I mean means hearts are not just failing for fear but there's very little care anymore people are worried about their own selves but that's not Christianity we should put others needs above our own selves amen the Lord Jesus put his life very secondarily to yours Hallelujah amen that's how we should be [Music] praise the Lord [Music] Hallelujah amen but you see now if Jesus had the wolf nature the lamb would never I mean the Holy Ghost is a dove could never come and abide on him he had to have the same kind of Nature and it's the same thing with you and I but the problem is we can get into a spot where that lamb nature leaves us in a wolf nature comes back because we're stuck in these bodies right we need these bodies to be changed but we can't walk in a wolf nature whatever triggers us for that wolf nature to come out we need to get rid of that trigger right and it's not a learned behavior to suppress things remember we're not in this impression idea we're in a Liberation and a restoration and a you know transformation this is a Transformation Center that we don't have to just suppress character traits that are bad and try and put them in the cupboard somewhere sweep them under the rug no we don't do that kind of a thing we let God we put it on the Altar and God Burns it out I mean God changes us Hallelujah praise the Lord so I'm just going to try and find this on here amen actually I can drive on here can that go back up actually I don't I feel I do need this sorry because there's some things I I would like to bring out of here but you see Moses Moses was was Meek concerning the people but you see he had a temper problem who knows that he had a temper problem under the blood of bulls and goats he could never get rid of that temper problem because the life of a bull or a goat could never come into a man or a woman and change their nature what remember the blood of bulls got only cupboards and never took sin away so so he lives with that temper problem all of his life amen but but the thing is under the blood of Jesus Christ if he lived under the blood of Jesus Christ that Temple would have been gone why because the life and the blood the Holy Ghost would would have come in him and taken that temper out of him um that's why I'm so thankful as we'll say that we're here there's a Transformation Center where the Holy Ghost of life and the blood of Jesus Christ comes into you and I and changes our nature to match his word Hallelujah amen it was one of the greatest it was one of the greatest things now when the lamb and the dove met together and that same thing amen when when when Heaven and Earth embraced when they took when all the eternities Embrace together and that same thing must happen in you and I why because the Lord Jesus the blood of Christ cleanses us takes our sin nature out of us that he can come and dwell in us just like he dwelled in the days of his flesh there now if you look in the Bible when there's great changes in time there's always a character in the scripture that has the character of Christ that displays a real meekness now we went through Moses he was one of them he was the meekest man in all the Earth after the burning bush experience but then the Lord Jesus would say he'd prophesy the day we live and say as it was in the days of Noah so it'd also be in the days of the son of man they'd eat they drank their married wives they were given a marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also it wasn't the days of lot they'd eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rain fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall have been the day when the son of man is revealed so the Lord Jesus is looking and taking past events and saying these events when you see them repeat on the Earth again you're on the end times there's going to be a junction in time there's going to be a change going on and so now I just want to take in the days of lot because in the days of lot was in the days when Abraham was upon the Earth and Abraham was a was a Meek man he's the father of the faith he was a Meek man now we have this example here where where where where Abraham's herdsmen and lots herdsmen are striving together and so Abraham didn't say it a lot listen lot God called me I spoke to God has God spoken to you a lot has God has God walking with you lot no God called me lot you're just following along you're just getting blessings from walking with me did he do that no he didn't do that he said okay okay buddy I like this because he's like you know trying to calm him down this is Abraham talking a lot Abraham's the older guy there you know and he's trying to say okay no it's all right let's not fight anymore you look up look we're up on this hill have a look around where do you want to live you you choose you get first dibs and then I'll take the rest why did he do that because he was meek why did he do that because he had a visitation of God over and over again because he knew that natural blessings were not the blessing he was after it was not the blessing that was revealed to him it was revealed to him he had received the promised son Hallelujah that's what he was looking for a visitation of God that they could have the promised son that they could have Isaac amen so so in this great Junction here was a man you think you think about Abraham he had a right to being annoyed with lot remember God didn't call lot God called Abraham but Abraham was happy for a lot to come with but there had to come a time where there had to be a separation between them and it wasn't Abraham pushing lot out it was like making a choice but you see Abraham Abraham chose God's way he chose God's way he stayed on the mountain top there wasn't much grass for the cattle but lot a type of the backslidden world the church doesn't believe in the miraculous when it finally come come till those things wound around into God until they had to come a junction there had to be a time for Abraham was heir of the land oh God why can't Christian see blessed of the pure in heart they shall see God blessed are the meek they shall inherit the earth The Junction times at hand for father to show that we're at the end time so in this Junction time because remember Abraham was approaching a time where where Sodom and Gomorrah were going to be destroyed which is an example of this Gentile world is doomed sorry to say but it's doomed right but there had to be a there had to be a man upon the Earth that had the character of Christ in this Junction time aiming to stand in the gap for lot to stand in the gap for those who really weren't visited like he was amen but you see the see the visitation of God did not make Abraham proud if we're proud oh I'm a Believer I know where I'm going I'm going in a rapture look at me I'm better than everyone else you don't you actually haven't met God it's just all in here if it's in here you'll be like Abraham you'll be like Moses you'll definitely be like the Lord Jesus amen amen but if it's all in the head well that's just not going to do you no good but you see there had to be a man here there had to be a man that was willing to give lot the best place see but Abraham the man of God gave lot his choice and taken what was left oh I love that a real believer will give you your choice he's willing to take what's left there's no selfishness in a real believer no not at all amen so that's because why because he's a real believer see Abraham was Meek he was gentle but he wasn't he wasn't too Meek that when when when the kings were fighting and lot was taken captive and all of his people he wasn't Meek in a way that oh that that he just sat back and said well I guess that's just that's just uh lot's portion no he earned his servants who weren't even soldiers and went and got back lot praise the Lord that's real meekness amen the enemy's coming and got my family struck me with sickness struck someone Something's Happened it's let's take the sword of the word let's go after them Amen in prayer and love Hallelujah that's what Abraham did amen who's who's with me today amen we're the children of Faith right amen this is who we are is what the Lord Jesus has made us amen hallelujah you see now you know the whole armor of God we know the whole armor of God is is displayed there in Ephesians right the whole armor of God but how is that armor manifested it's actually the fruits of the spirit it all ties together because the armor of God is not a natural armor we've got a helmet and a sword and a shield somewhere here but that's not I I could never give those to you and say now you've got the helmet of salvation the sword of the spirit of the shield of Faith No they're just toys it's not the armor of God the Holy Ghost is actually the armor of God Amen the Holy Ghost is described in different ways but it is the Holy Ghost is the armor of God and then amen and then but how does this armor work right see it's got to be love D joy peace long-suffering goodness meekness patience gentleness is that right everything's Supernatural there's nothing natural about the armor amen see and so our character must be Supernatural as well a real Supernatural meekness and gentleness amen why but but why do we want to be this way that God can impart eternal life I'm gonna I'm gonna wrap this up soon remember Jesus will say I said you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall they do because they go into my father and whatsoever ye shall ask pardon me in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son so he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater than these why because I go unto my father now so the works that he did what did he do raise the dead heal the sick cast out the Devils control nature cleanse the lepers and all those different things right that's what he did if you believe on him you'll do those works Mark 16 in action is still the general orders of the church amen that is still in manifestation I know some Bibles have a footnote saying that those verses not inspired but I just Rejoice because I've seen it happen so so if it's not inspired and guys still use it what happens if you take the inspired word and use it to but to me it's all inspired amen it's all the word of God but these Greater Works what is the Greater Works the Greater Works is the imparting of eternal life amen amen amen hallelujah amen you know you know you can impartied God can he party eternal life through you I mean Christianity is more than just coming to church and saying you believe in Jesus which is all part of it but essentially God can use you remember you're you're part of his body right here's the head we are the body right and what life comes through the body amen so so we can God can use us to impart eternal life so he says the Greater Works was to have power in the church not only to heal the Sick by prayer cast out Devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to Believers the Holy Ghost was coming and given to the hands of the church to impart life oh that's what Calvary meant it took stupid degraded men and women and lifted them into a place to be Sons and Daughters of God to heal the sick to impart eternal life by giving the Holy Ghost to obedient Believers men who are once unbelievers be made Believers and in part spiritual eternal life Hallelujah Acts chapter 10 what life was imparted amen through the woods of Peter wasn't just Peter speaking those things recounting in a historical event no God anointed it and what they received the Holy Ghost amen how much greater is it to say this sick woman laying here I pray a prayer of faith and she'll be healed that's a great thing but what but that's what he was doing then but greater than this shall you do I'm going to give you power not only to raise him up for a while but to give me eternal life which will be Eternal forever blind poor Richard people how do you miss it don't you see that the greater thing is that's the greatest thing could ever happen was to impart eternal life to people what is eternal life the life that he lived the life that was in him impart that to others can a man do it a Son of God can now that doesn't mean you go around on your own just oh I'm going to give this person eternal life today that's not what he's talking about and that's not what we're talking about what I'm talking about is you're so surrendered to God that God could anoint you to speak to somebody and faith will raise in their hearts and they'll receive the Holy Ghost oh that's a preacher's job no we're all part of the same body amen if you truly have a lamb nature and the Holy Ghost has descended upon you made as Abode and he's living through your life God can use you to impart that life to somebody else you don't have to just say preach them a sermon but you live a life you can speak to them and after you spoke to them you can say where did that come from that was God speaking to that person this is not this is not Pie in the Sky stuff you read it in the book of Acts and we've been returned back to the book of Acts where the Holy Ghost is in the church doing the same things he did back then because he's the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah but what does it take a meek humble gentle loving long-suffering full of love nature with patience that's what we need I'm not saying we don't have it but we're going to look at man Lord Jesus make me more like thee yeah you know after studying these things about Lord I want to be meek I want to be like you Lord I don't want to be angry and frustrated and negative and you know balling people out and just feeling so you know I don't want to be like that Lord change me to match you that you can do what you want to do through me that because remember a testimony of anything God does it's actually not the person it's God doing it it's a testimony of what God did not what the person did see if we put ourselves in any testimony well we've got a wrong we got a wrong motive to begin with amen we must be meek yield and humble that God can live who wants who wants to see God live amen who wants to who wants to have that kind of a nature amen remember but character is a victory not a gift so what is that victory victory over this own self Lord take my nature change it Lord may I die on your altar Lord Jesus that I can be born again that after whatever I don't know what experience may happen to you but then after that moment you'll see a life change where you see the word of God living you see his character manifested amen let's have the musicians this morning please but the meek shall inherit the earth make us more like you Lord [Applause] amen amen let's just stand this morning I mean
