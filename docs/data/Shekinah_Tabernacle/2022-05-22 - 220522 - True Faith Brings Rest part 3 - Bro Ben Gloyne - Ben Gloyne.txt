you all amen great to have everyone here today amen praise the lord amen good to have you here brother jeremy god bless you amen let's just go to the scripture this morning we're going to go to second timothy 1 and 12 and i think i updated the presenter but it might not have updated the queue but um so second timothy 1 and 12. and then we're going to go to acts 27 and then we're going to go hebrews 11 again so we're going to just pick up where we left off on wednesday so 2nd timothy 1 and 12 um says here for the which cause i also suffer these things nevertheless i'm not ashamed for i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day amen hello i know in whom i have believed i trust you have that same uh revelation in your heart now we're going to go to acts 27 as well we're going to go acts 27 and verses 17 to 26 this is a bit of a lengthy reading here but so acts 27 and 17. so in the midst of the storm when the apostle paul's on his way to rome so just notice that here so which when they had taken up they used helps undergirding the ship and fearing less they should fall into the quicksands strike sail and also were driven and we being exceedingly tossed in a tempest the next day they lighted the ship and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship and when neither son nor stars in many days appeared and no small tempest lay on us all hope that we should be saved was then taken away but after long abstinence paul stood forth in the midst of them and said sirs you should have hearkened unto me and have not loosed from crete and to have gained this harm and loss and now i exhort you to be of good chair for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you but of the ship but they stood by me this night the angel of god whose i am and whom i am served saying fear not paul thou must be brought before caesar and lo god hath given thee all them that sail with thee wherefore sirs be of good cheer for i believe god that it shall be even as it was told me amen and let's just go to um hebrews 11 and 1 very familiar scripture amen to us all but we're just going to read that again so hebrews 11 and verse 1 says here so hebrews 11 1 it says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen amen let's bow heads in the word of prayer this morning gracious father we just want to ask lord as we come into your presence lord that you will just do a work in our hearts lord may you just lord i just pray that you'll just manifest your faith in our lives dear god i pray that you'll make a very clear differentiation between human faith and perfect faith and lord we want to walk in perfect faith lord we want to walk according to the faith of the son of god and just want to pray dear god as we've read your word i just want to ask lord it's the same god that lord you spoke to the apostle paul there lord through great storms lord but he told him that this is not going to be the end father he could he could trust in your revelation lord you quicken that to him and father lord we go through the storms of life as well and i just pray to god that may we just realize lord this is not our end we're just going through it lord you're going to take us through for your glory father we want to commit our lives into your hands just pray you would be with us lord bless the reading of your word may bless the hearer and speaker dear god be with those who are streaming as well we ask these things lord for your glory in jesus christ's name amen amen amen god bless you may have your seats amen i want to welcome david here too god bless you bro how you doing good to see you amen we so we get so every um so we're speaking about uh the difference between uh human faith and uh divine faith or perfect faith and true faith well uh if i can call it that uh perfect faith gives gives rest brings rest now the apostle paul was such a man that he could walk by perfect faith now we know he's our example he's the pattern of every true minister down through the age and also his life as a pattern even for the believer where where where god would take him he'd manifest the word for his day he'd sure he'd go through great trials and suffering but i just want you to know from the from the onset real faith does not is not a force field from from trouble now i'm probably going to repeat a bit from wednesday but i want to emphasize these things but you know but really brother brown says when you really meet god that's really when you get on the battlefield that's really where the battle really starts that's where trouble begins but the great thing is when trouble begins there is because you should know a god when you really meet him you know the lord that can defeat every trouble right so so there's a big difference between between human human faith intellectual faith and true faith now true faith is a revelation it is perfect faith true faith is not based on your emotion but it anchors in the word of god that's its resting place human faith is worked out it's manufactured by what a person does or thinks or learns human faith relies on the person's ability to overcome that is mind over matter and it will fail every every once human faith fails it has to fail because only god can be the unfailing one now human faith can be mixed with with revelation and so we've got to be very careful that our human faith does not interject into our revelation now the um peter the apostle had that great revelation where where jesus would ask his disciples who do men say that i am and you know they'd say well you're you're or elias or one of the prophets but then jesus asked him he said but who do you say i am and peter was the one who said thou art the christ the son of the living god and so peter would be told by jesus bless out thou simon by jonah flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my father in heaven so you didn't you didn't work this out by by the consensus of your fellow disciples or what people were saying or even your own mind it was actually god himself revealed it to you sovereignly he says now upon this rock i'll build my church which is that and that rock is the revelation of who jesus christ is the word but you see peter would come to a place where where where where because this human faith was still there because it was it was um before pentecost where where he would jesus would tell him that he he tells disciples many times i'm going to be giving him to the hands of wicked men i'm going to be crucified but on the third day i'm going to raise again and peter would try and withstand that and you know it's amazing how jesus even told peter that that you know before the crows three times because he said i'm gonna go die you know yo i'll go with you he says no before the grows three times you're gonna deny me or you're gonna die deny me thrice but peter peter didn't say no lord may i not fall into this temptation deliver me from it you know no he just he just didn't even answer him and basically what he was saying without saying was i don't believe you even though he had that revelation that jesus was the christ but in his humanity and his pride he thought no i'm going to overcome this in my own ability because he's a big burly fisherman he's a rugged fisherman he's a rugged apostle right but you see god god allowed him to go through that for actually that to be taken out of him so failure failure can be a real good thing because failure god uses failure to take things out of our lives because when we fail we're like lord i failed you know we can't blame no one else we are the you know the underlying or the or the or the same ingredient in every circumstance is you right so you've got to come to that realization actually it's me o lord standing in the need of prayer right it's not the other person it's actually me i need it right so peter had to come to that place where he realized his own human ability was a failure and brother graham says in perk perfect strength perfect weakness we must master the thought of human ability so what that means is we must come to realization it's not our own human ability that will that will make us be believers or help us overcome we cannot do it it takes him it takes him inside us he's the overcomer right so so peter was lifted up and pried there and his pride was speaking that see because it was it was his human faith responded and he tried to speak his outcome in his own human faith i'm going to go die with you i'm going to stand everyone else will remember i'm going to stand i'm peter i'm not like john and all these other guys i'm i'm a different stuff but no no he was the same stuff so it was it was this human ability speaking that was mixed with pride and pride is always normally mixed with human faith and he failed miserably now but god's grace stepped in because god didn't want to leave him in that state he was he had the key to the kingdom he had to use them right so so god didn't leave him and i'm so thankful our lord doesn't leave us in that kind of state you know we may feel so broken and disheartened but god wants to work with you and that he cannot work remember he resists the proud he can't work in the pride proud life you know he needs he needs to bring us to a place where we say lord i failed i can't do this i need you and then he says well i've been waiting for you to say that because remember he's a gentleman he doesn't force himself upon anyone we have to be willing to say lord put me on your operating table i mean take your word and just do the surgery you need to do i rearranged my life amen so now so real faith is a revelation it's purely and sovereignly god given and no one can boast that they have it so there's just a recap from wednesday i'm just mixing in a few things now faith is not deciding what you want and then asking for it human true faith is not deciding well i want that lord give it to me that is that is human faith saying you know the name and claim it cut thing out of our humanity it's real faith is what you're lead to believe for it's what the lord leads you to believe or then you claim that right so you say lord lead me to every promise lead me to every promise and whatever arrangement you want to be if it's healing than my family then whatever more but lead me to that promised lord every promise you know by faith it's yours but lord take me to the promise pardon me take me to that promise oh god i mean because you've got to realize every time now we believe we're living in the season of the power of the spoken word manifested are we not amen you know the third pull is here we're not waiting for it to come it's here that power has been released into a bribe by this open word it's here right now right it's right here the former ladder rain are falling where we're living in the season of the bride's revival it's happening right now we're not waiting for it to come it's here i mean because revival is always linked with the opening of the word right and there's no other eighth myth there's no eighth messenger in the scripture we've had the seventh message he's opened the words to the revivals here right so it's all here so we're not looking for something it's here it's already within us oh we need the squeeze no it's already in you that power's already in you amen so now but every time the power of the spoken word was activated or or manifest in the prophet's life it wasn't him that caused it to happen he did not decide when he was sitting in the sitting there squirrel hunting i want i want these squirrels and i want to speak them into existence sure he is pondering on that scripture whatsoever he say right but it was god saying what do you need what are you here for i'm hunting oh well how many squirrels do you want it was god actually saying it to him but he had to respond to the call it wasn't him in his mind saying wouldn't that be cool if that happened that way no it was god given i mean when the little fish was given back its life it was the woods boys were having fellowship on the boat when they are fishing because they just got saved and they were talking about let's go see old sister son so there was a real christian we want to tell her that we've met the same jesus she knows and god came down into their fellowship and manifested the spoken word it wasn't the prophet that ignited it it wasn't even the woods boys that said let's let's let's pray you know let's speak life back into this fish no they were just having fellowship god stepped out into the fellowship and god caused it to happen not one of them made it happen it was god that said i'm going to do this amen now yeah the squirrels god asked them what do you have need of now hattie writes boys their salvation wasn't based on the prophet decided i'm going to give you your voice you know it was actually because she just subconsciously just just blurted out that's nothing but the truth brother branham she couldn't help but say i believe that right and then god stepped into it so it wasn't them that orchestrated it was god that caused it to happen amen the tumor being spoken out of uh sister meter's side and we'll come to that a bit more soon but you know sure they prayed and they prayed and they prayed that it would be done and you know i think it's very important to note that the prophet took his family to the doctor now i mentioned on wednesday i touched it how god can respond in different ways so you know there's like a you know you know like the four living creatures around the throne so there's a line anointing so it's like an instant miracle or it can be the ox anointing where you've got to carry it to death right or it's the man anointing it's man's wisdom right so god uses medicine right god uses different things but god can lead you and then it's also a divine healing we hands are laid upon you anointed with oil and you shall recover so but we don't want to be in such a way that god you have to answer me according to what i think is best no you can have it your way jesus it's the reason i had brother isaac sing that song you know you can have your your way jesus so whatever way so i think it's important to note that that she was gonna get the surgery right she was booked in she was you know she saw the specialists all those different things so they were going that way but then the lord and his great sovereign grace you said speak what you will and it'll be done right so but but it wasn't the prophet that caused it to happen it was god that caused that to happen amen now who's who's ever heard of the um of the healing of uh i think it's donnie morton it was it was actually published in reader's digest now this was a boy a little child that that that that had a bad um uh head cancer or something he wasn't very good well we'll be running around the church later don't you i hallelujah when the spirit of lord moves upon my heart i dance like david dance glory to god hallelujah so here was this well i'll just read the account of it he says now now so i was talking to someone says that about about a prayer line so this father and mother got their child into into the meeting they they came all the way from winnipeg um canada i think this is down in california where it happened he said now as i was talking to someone there's brother brahm in the prayer line i happened to hear it and i seen that father go away and i said what's the matter he said he didn't have a prayer card then something said to me bring him back so i said bring him here and the father came up and tears running down his face needed shaving he walked up and here's the here's the readers die here's the reader's digest said see i asked no questions but looked straight to the face of the baby i told the baby where it was from it had been to mayo's clinic and all about what was the matter with it how sick it had been and everything and so the father started crying and started to leave and said he started off the platform and he turned around he said that's right sir he said but will my baby ever live i said that i can't say i said just a moment i seen a vision appear i said you won't want to believe this because mayos and hopkins both said that the operation couldn't be performed on that brain but i'll tell you what you do you tomorrow you just go ahead with this baby within three days you'll be going to meet a black-headed woman on the street and that woman's going to ask you what's the matter with the baby and when and then she's going to tell you of some little country doctor out here that can perform that operation and you won't want to believe it because mayo's turned it down and said it's impossible to be done but that's the only chance your baby has through the power of god the mercy of god and that operation well you think well why didn't god just heal it right there the power of god was there yeah the lord discerned what was wrong and what where the child had been where it was from why didn't it just take the cancer away god works how he wants to work but it's through the power of god the mercy of god and that operation see now if you believe me to be his prophet do as i tell you it's like putting the figs on hezekiah and so forth he said he turned around and said thank you walked off two or more days had passed he was down on the street one day and a lady walked up said what's the matter with your baby i said it's got a brain disease and he was going on talking like that says they thought it was awful bad you know and she and he said just in a few minute minutes something taken place she said sir i know someone who can do that operation he said lady look mayo brothers give it up and said it can't be done see the man up here was praying for it named brother brahman said he had a prayer for the baby he said wait a minute blackhead black-headed wearing a gray um coat suit said that's her said where is that doctor and she told him um they took him up there and the doctor performed the operation the baby got well see now that came through the reader's digest you see and mayo brothers called me in on an interview for he said reverend branham what did you do for that baby i said nothing i never touched it i only told what god told me to tell it the man obeyed it caesar god god works through many different avenues but we're going to be open to what if that what if that father was just disappointed but i want him healed now i don't want to have some operation he would never have got it you see so we need to be sensitive to the leading of the holy ghost we can't just put god in one box as god cannot be boxed amen hallelujah now faith is not an imagination faith is not something you work out it's not a you know it's it's something you really possess it's just as real as you coming to church today in your car in your automobiles just as real as you're sitting in the church it's just as real as you hear my voice it's a substance not an imagination not an emotion but something that you have and it comes to you by the hearing of the word of god and that only faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god that puts it back to where your faith is then it's not in some individual it's not in a man it's not an organization it's not a group of people it's in god because god is the word see your faith is in god now i think it's very important when we realize where faith come from but it's also very important we realize where unbelief comes from now unbelief is caused by a demon spirit anointing a person and the unbelief in that spirit goes into the person and they disbelieve the word of god but if you take the opposite of it where does faith come from the holy ghost overshadows a person and the faith that was in god that said let there be sun moon and stars and created the universe now comes into the person and they believe the word amen so if you're feeling cold and different not listening to what's going on totally your mind is somewhere else i say what is anointing you amen because because god won't make you think about tomorrow or the next day or whatever your problem is he'll get you focused on him amen so it depends who you entertain in your seat this morning i'd entertain the lord say lord faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god here is the lord increase my faith amen now i want to read this because we've got to realize we're here for a purpose we're here for a divine purpose now this may be a bit scrambled leg style but we're going to get somewhere so but i just want you to realize we're we need to look beyond the now we need to look beyond the circumstances of now and and brother bam says and i know my redeemer liveth he says and god did not make a tree just to see if he could make a tree he made a tree for a purpose and god did not make you and i just to see if he could do it he made us for a purpose therefore there is a purpose of all of us being here you're not here just to be another human being you're here because god made you for some purpose you're not just here to eat the food that god growed you're not just here to live in the house that man made or wear the clothing that someone fashioned you're here for a specific purpose no matter how little you are how big you are how important you are how unimportant you are you're here to serve a purpose just as my finger is here to serve a purpose my nail on my fingers for a purpose my eye every part of our bodies is to serve a purpose and it was not put here just to see if what it would look like when it was put here but it was put here to serve its purpose it was god's divine plan to do so and if we were here for some purpose now listen to this this is this should help us we should be running amen where's william release him now this is the time there is nothing that can destroy us until god's purpose is fulfilled nothing can harm us until that purpose that god has put us here for has been made manifest no matter how much trouble we have how much heartache or sorrows that we go through all of these are reasons and there's a reason for it i mean so we didn't just be put here just to be put here because we could be put here we're put here for a purpose and so if we have a divine purpose then we still that purpose still must be fulfilled if it has been fulfilled then we'll be taken home right we you're here for a purpose we're not here just to occupy time right but you're here for a divine purpose now we'll have troubles on the road but faith doesn't look at the trouble we'll have heartache on the road but faith doesn't look at the heartache amen faith looks at the promise looks at the end and so the apostle paul he went through a lot of trouble now as i said in the beginning faith does not give us a a a force field that keeps trouble away it does not it actually brings trouble close because that troubles used to develop a character actually to develop the word in your life to bring it forth amen that that we mature that we grow we become stabilized you know we say well i've i've faced this before you know lord i know you delivered me then you'll deliver me again i believe you will however you do it i don't know but yeah it gives a trust it gives a rest amen faith does maturity does now so we're here for a purpose right so now the apostle paul knew he was there for a purpose if we could just go into that ship there it wasn't a small storm it wasn't a gentle breeze gusting it was a big storm they fit they thought we're toast we're going to the bottom you know we're done we're cooked we're throwing everything overboard we can we've done everything we can but the apostle paul's in his cabin i don't know maybe he was holding on and you know as as the boat's pitching and rolling but he was in contact with god because he said lord you told me before this is not my end this storm is not my end this trouble is not my end this boat is not my end i'm getting off this ship i mean because you said i'm going to be a witness in rome you said amen i'm going to be a witness there i'm not in rome yet so therefore this ship i can't go down with the ship i mean so he looked beyond his circumstances and he looked to where he was going to end up now we've got to be to have the same kind of eyes of faith i mean we may be in a storm pitching rolling trouble on every hand trouble in the family trouble with finances trouble in relationships whatever it is they say lord this is not the end you said i'm going in a rapture your word says my family's coming with me you said every divine promise is mine this is not the end of my journey lord i don't believe it is lord jesus you're going to take me through hallelujah we should that yo that's how we should believe shouldn't we and if the lord takes us home obviously it's our time and we can rest well we've done our course so we can't lose either way hallelujah but you know you've got to look beyond i was looking at the um maybe i'll bring it out and you know in the future but you know what season lady ocean uh it says that you're poor richard miserable blind and naked and that blindness is actually linked with pride so the reason this world can't see beyond the now is pride and i say the problem is many believers can't look beyond the now because of pride pride manifests in many different ways having a pity party can be pride it's all about me you know worshiping trouble worshiping self you know that's that actually caused the blindness to come on we don't want to be a proud people want to be a humble people you can have it your way jesus whatever's going on my life fall apart lord you can have it your way hallelujah because we need to come to a place where we recognize that that how our life is going perceived by us isn't but does not is not a reflection of god's approval he says the cloudy skies and storms of life are no sign of god's disapproval neither are the bright skies and still water signs of his love and approval oh but i thought you know if i give my life to him everything will go well no this is not how this works you know even even i think paul and um like i remember who was with him was telling the thessalonians you know these thessalonians just been birthed into the kingdom and they began to preach them through great you know great tribulation you enter into the kingdom of god you didn't sign up for a picnic here boys you're here for a battle you're here you have a rugged faith god's going to prove what's in you what he's put in you by the baptism of the holy ghost amen yo yo and we're the same way it's a great tribulation we're going to enter into the kingdom of god hallelujah you know if we could if we only saw out our time upon the earth i doubt any of us would sign up for this but to get it comes past the curtain of time yet say lord i don't want to bypass any of it even i think the prophet was asked one time he saw a trouble come out and god said do you want to bypass that he says no lord i'll surrender i'll go through it so may the lord give us grace that that wherever he leads us we'll say lord here i am reporting for judy i love you lead me through hallelujah amen his approval of any of us is only in the beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us oh yes how shall we know we shall know because he said so and manna and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit placing us as sons how do you know he loves me he told me and didn't just tell me he brought me to himself amen and then you manifested it by bringing it bringing me to himself that's how i know jesus loves me because he revealed himself to me he called me i had to surrender to the call but there was a time i said lord i'm coming i don't care what my friends say i don't care about all that you know peer pressure is a real thing and it held me back for a couple of years because i'm afraid to lose my friends but then the lord just keeps calling and you just get so sick of this being up and down and enough religion to make you miserable say lord here i am hallelujah i think that's you god god's grace brings us to that place praise the lord what about my best friend or bffs whatever don't worry about them if you want to help them serve god and god will get a hold of them you know that's how we should believe for it amen so he said so and he manifested that he loved us because he brought us to himself so you know we should never have a question does god love me have you been gathered to him have you been brought to him hallelujah well then he loves you he said so but he proved it he called you by his grace amen you know we should just let off the pressure i've got so many burdens no the problem is people get so burdened down with things they can't enjoy god is because they're holding on to the burdens we should give them to him cast your cares upon him because he cares for you oh but what about this and this and this don't cast him upon him i mean we shouldn't be all crippled down and we can't even rejoice and be happy no more we can't let god touch us because we're holding on to our burdens you know who's ever carried enough stuff they can't see where they're going you know that's like that with burdens and trouble you know god wants to say yo he's there just pass them in but you're carrying them like this you can't see where you're going and you know there's a step but you you start stumbling around and put them down give them to him he's the one who sorts it out he's the he's the burden sort of router that's his new job title yeah he'll take care of you but you got to give it to him and not just say but then hold on to it you know it's like sometimes you pass it pass something to someone and they don't let go he's like give it to me who's ever had that you know pass it here give it here like little child you know give me that they got to give it to you but they're still holding on and you gotta like you know william there's like a spoon give it here it goes here you gotta kind of twist his arm and there we go thank you very much for passing that to me yeah but that's how we are with god lord i got these problems i know lord don't you care i do give them here give them to me oh but lord don't you understand i do understand i went through it myself i i'm in humanity i was in humanity like you are i know it's like this suffer loss and hardship and heart i can be misunderstood and rejected and despised and i understand it more than you do you know so someone looks at you funny and you feel so like cut off from the world and you think you're the you know but then the lord jesus the whole world he died of a broken heart i don't mean this to be ridiculous but who's i don't see anyone in this room who suffered that because no one's died here let alone have a broken heart but you see you know he yeah we think the devil tries against i think no one understands us no one cares but you got to give it to him you're going to give it to the lord see he see the devil basically what he does but by that he's but trying to tie your burdens or your trouble your pain to you so you can't let go of it no no the lord cares but you've got to cast your keys upon him does he love me yes he told me what is this message sent to do it's actually meant to tell you jesus loves you that was the reason malachi 4 came i love you with an unfailing love i've come to redeem you i'm going to carry you away i'm going to take i've already taken your sins away that down calvary but you're going to receive it by faith but i have come to prepare you because you've got a place at the wedding supper table that's why this message came amen so oh does he love us yes of course he loves us he sent this message your way he sent himself more than god sent a prophet no god says this is a god-sized job mighty angel descends christ himself in angelic form want to gather you to himself to carry you far away hallelujah why because that mighty angel is the anointing of the holy ghost in the end time hallelujah with that open book in your life you'll manifest every promise and the last great one of those promises the change of the body amen and then so sometimes we struggle does he love us you know the devil comes along says he doesn't love you and as i've said before it's the devil trying to put his experience on you the devil knows nothing of god's love because he's just a servant all he is is a servant he's just someone hired basically he's not part of the family you know god's love and affection and care and you know compassion and worry concern was never upon him he got fired right he's still kicking it he's still upset about that you know but he got fired right he's under our feet i mean so why why on earth should we listen to a fired servant no no he got fired you just got to call security the the holy ghost i mean to kick him off the premises you can even say devil i'll escort you off the premises hallelujah amen so he said so and now and how do i prove my love to him who wants to know that everyone's interested i'm sure by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass so yes we believe what he said but now we've got to actually conduct ourselves with joy well how that's not humanly possible well i know two brothers that were in prison they preached the mighty service but by the end of that they weren't escorted to their nice hotel room and you know no no no god said no i've got a different hotel room for you tonight because there's a predestined seat in that prison house so sometimes the lord will put us in a put us in a trial and a hardship and we feel like we're in a prison house but that's because someone else is in that same kind of state but they need to know him and the reason is you get into that is because it's someone that you can actually get a hold of and that you wouldn't ordinarily get a hold of just like paul and silas i don't read in the bible where they actually took a tour of prisons unless they were actually escorted to that tour by soldiers right but they would never have gone near the philippine jailer unless they got thrown into that prison and sometimes we get thrown into things because there's someone in that that's associated with that trial that needs to be free amen so so paul and saw us they could have sat there feeling sorry for themselves poor me why this happened lord but you're the great jehovah of miracles you're the almighty god that part of the red sea and did all incredible things and they could have shared testimony after testimony of what he did in their lives and felt sorry but no they said silas yes paul hallelujah we know he loves us because he said so we know he loved us because he called us you know as a pharisee of the pharisees i was dead against what i'm doing right now but he called us amen he's shown us love hallelujah and you know what silas what paul that this joy that i have the world didn't give it to me the salvation i didn't learn about the salvation at gamalie's feet i didn't learn this i didn't receive the holy ghost that was with moses it was now and me i didn't receive it by learning and being a pharisee god gave it to me hallelujah they begin to sing and they begin to shout they begin to testify so amen even in that hardship and that trial they conducted themselves with joy hallelujah now was that a learned behavior absolutely not because learned behavior doesn't bring god on the scene it's good to have learned behavior but you gotta let god anoint that loom behavior it's gotta be from your heart it should be burning from your heart i mean salvation should be burning from your heart amen this is how we should be like jeremiah said one day i'm not going to preach anymore but he couldn't but he had to open his mouth because he's like fire shut up in his bones i mean so what you know al this message should be burning on our hearts jesus lives the tomb is empty not because it's just empty because he resurrected out of that tomb i mean he's alive forevermore this bible lives amen he's the same god today he can save anyone he wants to do anything he wants to there's no case too hard for god it should be burning hallelujah god can help anyone any situation any state amen he saved me how do you get it burning just think about what he's done for you if he's done if he's just called you that's incredible thing because it's not naturally within man amen to seek after god god put it in you come to me my child i'll give you eternal life that's god given that's enough to tear up the whole world [Applause] hallelujah that's why brother ram said if you don't know what to say just say how your candle got lit i mean because that will produce a real heartfelt witness and because man is looking for something real they're not looking for something learned they're looking at something real not on here but in here hallelujah when you begin to witness someone maybe you feel led to say about the seals it's bursting from your heart or the church as it's bursting from your heart it's not a learned thing and something just comes out hallelujah about all about malachi 4 any promise of today it's not in here it comes out here it's not oh i should say this now and this no no it just comes out amen should be fire shut up in our bones hallelujah but the devil doesn't want that fire he fights that fire brother said all hell is against this revelation what christ and the people once again the word put on flesh amen but you see we can conduct ourselves with joy in the midst of the trial hallelujah well a big part of that is don't lean on how you're feeling you know it says in psalms 27 maybe we'll just read that actually i wasn't gonna you know these things i just think i'll i'll bring that out next time but i guess you know what's the saying about how people say i'll do it tomorrow but the answer is well today was yesterday's tomorrow you know so yep now psalm 27 this is the condition of of of of people who are ready for the rapture brother brown preach this text this is his opening scripture psalm 27 we'll start from verse one and um and so he didn't go to first thessalonians four as the background for the rapture he went here showing this is the state that we would be in when we're rapture ready amen he says now the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid now this should be revelation right not just nice scripture but no he is the strength of my here's my light and my salvation the reason i can see is god i mean my salvation is of the lord i mean it wasn't something i did it wasn't just the church i go to no god save me god called me he lightened up my path that i can see i mean that this world's falling apart but i'm not falling apart i'm just continuing on loving the lord hallelujah whom shall i fear well no one is the answer the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid it's amazing how fear comes in this is this is the condition that people will be because he's why why is he saying about fear and being afraid because there's a fearful time this is a fearful time but we are not ordained a man to live under that fear there's no fear in this world that is actually meant to be our portion amen we are here not to be afraid but to be fearless why because our god is god he's the king of glory he'll look after you has he looked after you this far he'll look after you the rest of the way amen so we are anointed you know what i love brother graham says about the um we'll come here but you know brother bram says about the you know four anointings down through the church ages we know we're under the eagle anointing but he'd speak about the martyrs and the oxides different things he said they were anointed that way that's all they could do they were they lived by that anointing they couldn't help but just give themselves as a living sacrifice amen so they lived under that anointing and that's all they could do and under the man age anointing the same way so now the anointing in the age will make the people live a certain way they can't help it i mean so the bride is under an eagle anointing we can't help but see what we see we can look above politics look above what's going on in the world look above economics we can look above all those things because we're anointed aiming to look through what the word says about us and what the word says about this time and we can walk fearless hallelujah he says they couldn't help but live that give their lives because that's what the anointing they were under that's the same thing with you and i hallelujah amen when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell no you know the you know the real enemy we have you know the devil is actually not our main enemy he's been defeated right he's been he's been conquered but the guy that is your biggest enemy is the person you look in the mirror at and that's not your spouse when they're standing next to you it's you it's you right it's you it's not the guy next to you or the woman it's it's you brother ham said the biggest enemy i have is william branham if i can get him out of the way god can do things that william brown knows nothing about amen so to me when it speaks about when my enemies come against me sure we can say that's the devil because he's our enemy there was a time he came against us we stumbled and fell in sin he was our task master he was a he's a horrible task master he'll make you think that it's actually good to serve him he's a liar but then there came a point where where god took that slave mentality off us revealed to us that we are sons and daughters of god and the devil's under our feet then that same devil comes back but then the results are very different he is expecting this will be easy just like shamga yeah the philistines come along well we're just going to get his crop again that's what happened last year this will happen this year it's amazing he's you know you know they they sent 600 soldiers to one farmer but the devil knows what's in you just like the philistines really i think subconsciously they knew what was in though shamgar didn't know what was in him until finally there was enough boot steps stomping up the road and it actually activated a faith within him when he looked at the looked at the state of his family and how they're all skinny and you know their clothes were ragged and now they're going to face another winter and you know the philistines going to take you know all the crops you know what i like about a true son or daughter of god the trial they're in lifts faith into them actually activates their faith in a great way it brings god when the enemy comes in like a flood i'll raise up a standard that's god's anointed word in you hallelujah so they're stomping up the road and then he begins to realize i'm a circumcised son of abraham i'm living in my inheritance amen and and and my god told my forefathers one will chase a thousand kill chase ten thousand now he did not stop and say now fellas for philistines can you number off you're like some kids going you know on a class trip number one no no no he he just took his ox code brother i said he jumped out the window and he killed one after another after another i mean that was a different season because he realized what he already was he did not become a circumcised son of abraham when he realized it he already was that was by his birth amen and by our new birth we need to realize we're sons and daughters of the king i mean so so there's a time that devil came against you you stumbled and fell but then just like shamgar when he realized who he was then those enemies laid dead at your feet hallelujah amen but there's another set of enemies that we have which are our five senses which is our emotional realm as well that is the enemies of faith what we see can be an enemy right what we see remember we don't look to what we see we look to the promise of god just like um i think it was one of the bother bosworth brothers their son was actually dying in hospital and you know you know his his vital signs got so low you know no one had actually come back from that point and they called brother brown men to come pray for him and brother and prays for the boy and then and then and then the mum and dad yo brother bob's worth one of them because he was two bosses with brothers said to his wife you know this is so wonderful our son's gonna live in there and they're both hugging each other and crying and rejoicing and praising lord and then the nurse is just like what's got what and and she's just kind of shocked like what's wrong with these what's wrong with these parents and then and then he says to her i mean she says to him rather um excuse me you know your son's dying you shouldn't be acting this way you know look at his vital signs his heart rate and pressure all those things no one ever has come back past this before and you know he just said to her you know look you're looking at what your instruments tell you and that's perfectly fine because they're good things but we're looking beyond that to the promise of god and they said you know his prayers have never failed once and what happened the boy was healthy well and strong married had kids you know because she was looking by what she saw they were looking beyond what they saw to faith by faith to the promise i mean so so what we see can be an enemy what we feel can be a big enemy it can be a big enemy you know feelings can shut down deliverance it can it can actually shut down god working with us you know it's amazing how um especially men you know their wives or their or their or their girlfriends before they get married you know they can start having a conversation and the conversation get quite emotional and then for some reason the men think it's just it's just their wife or their girlfriend manipulating them with emotion because they get emotional about talking about certain things and they just shut down the whole conversation now let me ask you a question what was she doing when when she looked into your eyes with tears of love saying i love you was that emotional manipulation no that was genuine love brothers also amen sisters they have been too you know you see it wasn't a manipulation to try and get you to think and do a certain thing no but the thing is people thinkers especially men i'll say this we get very uncomfortable talking about emotional things things that you know we get uncomfortable when when emotion comes into a conversation sometimes and the main reason is that is because we get uncomfortable talking about it because quite often it's us that need to change and we're not willing to talk about what we need to do brother say amen i'll say amen on behalf of every man in this church amen and then so what people say is no woman you're skiing emotional and they shut down the conversation but what is actually on its road is was deliverance of something so we can't just shut down things because oh it's emotional manipulation no no no no don't don't go yo our walk is not an emotionless walk a marriage without emotion is dead there's serious trouble there so you know we are built with emotion this should not be shocking to anyone you know we are emotional creatures if you actually shut down your emotions it's actually the devil disabling part of you oh but this is no but but but we just walk by the word brother yeah yeah we do but god never sent this message to shut us down emotionally right so we can't you know so that can many times be because i found christie and i have had serious conversations and the more uncomfortable i feel the more healing and you know the more deliverances brought he said i'm not enjoying this but it's good for me you know so we can't just say no no shut that down you know that's not right you're just manipulating me no no it's not that way amen now no one expected that just then but there it is you've got to be willing if you're uncomfortable talk about it until it's seen through don't just no no no no it's not manipulation you know i actually think you know the person you you marry 100 of the time wants the best for you i think they actually have your emotional physical spiritual welfare enviro uh you know in mind normally yeah no is that a shock you know is that is that is that um controversial it shouldn't be so you can't just say oh that's manipulated no it's not actually because there's things in us that need to be dealt with things from our upbringing from our nature from our culture things that are contrary to the word of god they need to come out oh yes and how do they come out i just you know i just need to hear that preach no no fellowship is all part of it talking one-on-one being vulnerable in conversation with your spouse amen so so feelings can beat us down that way they can be our enemy to shut down or they can beat us down the other way by we feel on cloud nine we're actually ready lord today's the day i'm ready lord hallelujah the morning went well the miracle of miracles the kids got out the door at the right time there's no squabbles not world war three you know everything was fine there was harmony in the house everything we're ready lord we're ready because you feel good right and then the next day it's like polar opposite you know you're just thankful blood wasn't shed you know by the time the school drop-off's done you're just thankful that you got through and lord what's wrong with me yesterday i felt so happy and so rejoicing in you and no what's happening is you're riding on emotion remember god gave us emotion but we shouldn't be led by emotion faith is not emotion sure emotion comes with faith right but faith is not emotion so so the devil can use our emotions against us amen and you know anyone with half a half a pulse knows what it's like to be led by emotion the wrong way that's why you've got to subject everything to the word of god amen and we'll come to that probably another time but you know so these five senses can be our enemy and we can stumble and fall against them our emotional realm can be our enemy but faith looks beyond it you know the apostle paul in that storm no doubt there would have been a real you know you know the devil puts fear upon us who's experienced that he puts real fear on us we christine and i were down in christchurch when the first earthquake struck there's a few years ago now there you know some so we lived in a little one-bedroom mezzanine apartment and and we lived down a quiet street but but before the earthquake struck as you people all know you know sometimes you hear a noise before it shakes and it was like a freight train was coming right through our place and in the place of finally up and down it wasn't just a gentle somehow we got down to our front door we started praying and you know all within me wanted to open my eyes and look around because it was you know but i said no i'm not going to look i'm going to pray because my help cometh from the lord my help is not going to come by observing the building right and god came down and we had one of the greatest prayer meetings we ever had right in that moment amen we had another time the first house we're here in freckleton grove there was a there was a demon spirit in the house and the first one of the first times we prayed against that there was a real fear came on me when i was praying and i didn't accept that fear i said satan how did you try and put your fear upon me and you know and and then after we prayed christine said oh you felt that too but you know sometimes we get oh i'm scared like it's yours it's not yours the fear is not yours it's the devil's fear but he tries to put it on you to try and your faith to pull you back say no i may feel this but i don't accept it i accept the promise amen so we're going to go beyond how we feel right but faith brings feelings right because anything without emotion is dead you bury it amen so faith brings love faith brings joy revelation revelation brings love revelation brings joy revelation brings peace you feel peaceful right amen you feel those things but you see faith is not based on those things but it brings those things amen so he says here about divine healing divine healing is not based on some emotion it's not based upon laying on of hands or some feeling or strange feeling or sensation it's based upon a faith in a work that was done for you by jesus christ at calvary it's a finished product see you may come and get hands laid upon you you may get oil be anointed with oil because that's according to the word but your faith is actually in it's done right i mean just like you know we can have such a great time at a camp but you know our faith shouldn't just be based on the emotional high of a camp it's got to go beyond that that that after you leave that atmosphere that atmosphere goes with you in your everyday life right you your faith is greater than the feeling amen now real faith so i'm just trying to sometimes my notes well probably a lot of time they don't make sense my sentences i try and put in here amen no real faith does not swing like a yo-yo or a pendulum it stays right on course now your emotions may swing but that doesn't mean that you don't have faith right you'll have trouble but that doesn't mean that you don't have faith now i was going to read that yes that's what i was going to do here so the apostle paul as i said i just want to emphasize this again real faith does not is not a force field from trouble here's the apostle paul it's in galatians 2 and 20 i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me so he's saying the life i now live i live by the faith of the son of god it's not my own faith it's not my intellectual faith or anything it's actually god's own faith the same faith that when he spoke his word let there be sun moon and stars and he believed and it was so that same faith the apostle was living by but then if we could go to second corinthians 11 we can see uh the the time that the apostle paul had because real faith does not keep hardship away we look at the apostle paul he says um says ii corinthians 11 23 are they ministers of christ i speak as a fall i am more and laborers more abundant and stripes above measure and prisons more frequent and death deaths off so this is this is his this is his experience how is your christian experience paul i'm going to tell you so this is like you know who wants to be a missionary this is this is his experience of the jews five times received i 40 stripes save one thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a night and a day i've been in the deep in journeys often in perils of waters and perils of robbers and perils of my own countrymen imperials by the heathen and perils in the city and perils in the wilderness and perils in the sea and perils among false brethren in wariness and painfulness and watchings often and hunger and thirst and fastings often and cold and nakedness beside those things that they are which are without which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches now i'll say this a lot of people they'll just get to the first part of this list and quit if it's just human faith they'll give up they said lord but i thought you'll be in me and i'm an overcomer and they'll never be no no no no no but you see the apostle paul he had all this trouble but he never quit he never gave up he knew he was there for a purpose right sure he got stoned and beaten all this trouble but his life was still within him he had not finished his purpose yet amen it should be the same thing with us because remember he had real revelation it wasn't a nice idea that he became an apostle was god said separate to me paul and barnabas right so he could he could go through all these things but yet keep going hallelujah how about you and i we come into difficulty you know it's like brother ram said about these serophenician woman who came to jesus her her daughter was grievously vexed for the devil she had she was perseverant she had real revelation faith if she just got to jesus then then her daughter will be well but you see brother em said she had trouble she had difficult but her faith did not well what was her difficult well jesus said you know i'm not sent to you difficult you know it's not me to give the children's bread to the dogs she had difficulty so in her humanity she had difficulty but her faith had no difficulty so if she was just going by her feelings she'd say and i thought this was the man of galilee who did nothing but good and i've come to him in my time of need and look at his response how dear how dare him i've come all this way i have this great need he's healed others why won't he yo he spoke to the centurion who was a gentile like me and see you'll go receive as you believe and here i am he's calling me a dog what a racist this guy is how dear what a sexist oh woman of dogs and all these things you know so she and her flesh she had difficulty right but her faith knew no difficulty because her faith went through those problems right her faith wasn't willing to take no for an answer because her faith it had already been revealed to her when he says the word she's going to be well it was already revealed she wasn't going and saying i hope this works she knew it was going to work it was revealed see so she had difficulty but her faith had no difficulty you know listen to perseverance brother speaks about it i mean so if we have real faith we may have difficulty we may have obstacles but our faith will take us through those things the apostle paul's faith took him through being in prison being beaten being shipwrecked being stoned all those kind of things his faith he he had difficulty but his faith did not why because his revelation was i'm going to rome i'm going to run to be a witness amen so we're going to be the same i trust that our faith is the same kind of faith you know what brother ram said about you know we think of the martyrs in the dark ages we think man the faith they had to stand stand in the colosseum all the lions and the beating and the everything that they suffered no doubt they would see someone crucified oh yeah that's the pastor the other day but they didn't quit that faith was rugged you know and brother am said the same faith that they had to overcome there is the same faith you have to live daily in this world hallelujah we're going to realize the faith we have is powerful the faith we have made the worlds i mean the faith we had amen brought the resurrection and the faith we have they had to overcome amen but it depends what you lean upon see you go by emotion you'll be defeated or or reasoning in there but if you go by faith take how you feel everything back to the word look beyond what you see amen amen so paul was bouncing up and down in that storm but god said he's going to rome that was it that was his absolute his absolute wasn't the storm his absolute wasn't the chains his absolute wasn't what all the other sailors and things were saying in their panic and their fear and their trouble no his absolute was the angel of god said you're going to rome god told me i'm going through him that was his absolute i mean i trust that we have the same kind of absolute i mean god's speaking to us god revealing himself to us we're going to get through we're going in a rapture amen we're going to have an absolute not we can't just have shifting sands of our ideas and our emotion that will come upon us and we'll stumble and fall i mean but we have an absolute of a revelation of the word of god we will be victorious remember it doesn't take away the trouble faith does not take away the trouble amen but faith gives you a way to overcome the trouble to go through the trouble hallelujah you know the apostle paul one time you know he he he blinded what the magician you know i think was on the island of crete or malta you know he said you child to the devil you'll be blind for a season right but then after that he was in another place and the someone the coppersmith ran him out of town did he say lord where's my faith gone no he just sold you wrong don't let disappointment keep you disappointed keep going on with god amen hallelujah now here we are he says now you see somebody else so this speak about perfect faith this is brother brown preaching perfect faith he says now then when god by his word not by what someone else did what someone else said but by what god's word said he said let every man's word be a lie and mind be true now you see somebody else do something by a worker act of god or a promise of god and many of them say i can do it too it's an imagination and when they do they find them wrecking up out there somewhere it's got to be a substance now it is potentially a faith it is something that you could bring you up to a faith it is potentially like you've asked me for an oak tree and i give you an acorn potentially you have an oak tree but it hasn't produced itself yet but when it really brings itself out it's an oak tree and when you imagine that god does this but when it's revealed to you it's faith then a perfect faith that cannot fail so testimonies are good because it builds faith but when you say oh i can do that too but it's not revealed that's just imagination right so we need to say lord reveal your promises to me man not just be it's good to imagine the promise of god amen and the devil puts negative things in your mind oh this is going to happen and this is happening and it causes your imagination to go it always goes downhill to destruction is really the end before the credits roll right so he puts things in your imagination so why not so to me it's good to imagine what god could do but don't take that as a leading right take it as god revealing his word to you and that's the leading because if god's revealed it to you he will cause it to come to pass like elijah mount carmel he wasn't wondering is this going to work is my bluff and my bravado going to hold out no he went there and he and after the sacrifice was prepared he prayed said lord may the people know that thou art god and i've done this according to your word so he saw by vision exactly what was going to take place he stepped into the vision he wasn't guessing is the fire going to fall is it going to rain he knew it would happen it was revealed to him see that was his absolute in the circumstance it's going to be the same thing when god reveals his word reveals the promise i mean then we can walk with confidence because when it's revealed then perfect faith cannot fail it's a faith then see see that's the reason these visions are so tremendous to me because it's been proved right every time see and i know that he promised that and he promised it in his word and here he comes and promises it for this day therefore you know where you're standing when he said so see it that gives me a faith because he never does nothing contrary to his written word see and if it was contrary to the word i couldn't have faith in it brings it back again to the word see faith in hearing the word of god you must hear the word god's word is that all sufficient word it's all you of need of is his word now faith being the substance and in there we find out in hebrews what faith was and what those uh did who had faith see there's many times that people have faith today and tomorrow they haven't got it the next day there's something and something else but when god once anchors it and you see it there's nothing ever going to make you move from it hallelujah so nothing can make paul move from it shipwrecks beating stonings trouble distress naked peril sword nothing could move him from that face because it was revealed to him and when this message is revealed to you that the lord himself reveals it to you nothing can move you from it doesn't matter what critics say trouble says doubt say atheists say whatever says religious spirits say nothing can move you from it because it's been revealed amen i pray that's why we should pray for lord reveal your word to me don't just stuff my head with it lord put it down in my soul that it lives and is alive i mean because we have received the faith once delivered to the saints of revelation we've received it amen it is in the building right now it is in your heart moving amen that faith that was once given to them is given to you although that's why we can say lord reveal yourself to me and make your promises alive that's why it's so important you know i bet i bet you the devil will put you say i'm going to read the bible i'm going to go read yo pray and the devil gives you a to-do list of things that you need to do what's he trying to do because he knows that faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god he's seen it down through the ages he doesn't want to admit it but if he actually told the truth once he'd say this works it defeated me here defeated me in moses time and joshua's time and david's time down through the apostles time the prophet's time i've been whipped down through the ages because of the faith once delivered to the saints he knows the damage it's done to him he still carries the bruise in the scars he still doesn't have the keys to his own house he can't find him right so he tries to keep us from it amen she said lord may we just re and i'm talking to myself very much so may we rearrange our lives that we can actually drink in the promises of god hallelujah meditate upon them read them enjoy them not in a stress way saying oh i've got to remember this and no no you know you know what builds faith love builds faith you want you want more faith love and more he says here and speak to the rock how simple how simple when you just believe god's word and take him at what he says isn't it simple just love if you love him love in your heart for god will create faith [Music] love in your heart for god will create faith who wants more faith love him from your heart it will create faith i mean just just just enjoy his word just lord i'm so thankful i can read i've got psalm 31 thank you lord i can read that thank you lord so amazing what you said through dave just just just enjoy him he'll produce a greater love which will produce a greater faith amen now i'm going to read this our lord jesus was our example i'm going to read two more no i was going to read this now and and then i'll hit pause and we'll continue on another time now now here's our example now everyone knows this quite very well but but see he says g see real faith is subconscious it's not something consciously in your mind it's down in your heart that's real faith right so jesus no matter if he was in a storm and in the and the gal was knocking the boat from one side to the other or you're standing in a face of a mess of demons if he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he walked right on just as calm as quiet as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear or anything around him so down in his heart he didn't have those things right so so when so when i'm reading this it says that he was unconscious of it that doesn't mean he had these blinkers on like this and didn't see it or didn't hear it see remember real faith is not an absence of the enemy real faith is proven in the presence of the enemy just like david said thou set a table before me in the presence of my enemies amen you know my hair with oil my cup runs over for joy so god sets a table for his bride in the presence of the devil come to devil i invite you to this feast you're not eating don't touch the food now don't hurt the oil on the wine but he allows your enemy to come when you're feasting on the word of god so faith is not an absence of the enemy it actually is proven in the presence of the enemy amen if i can put it that way see so he was simply unconscious or fear or anything around him that's right whatever was going to happen or or whether it wasn't going to happen he knowed it was going to happen because god said so he didn't say oh have i prayed through i wonder if i fasted long enough i wonder if i did this he just walked right on see unconscious that's right see he didn't say have i done enough for for for the father to do anything no no he just walked right on work because he's walking in perfect faith he knew who he was no that doesn't mean we shouldn't pray and fast right but he wasn't scared of his own ability to bring the promise of god to pass because he was just walking trusting fully surrendered he just walked right on unconscious that's right he believed that that god said was truth the word must be fulfilled and he knowed what his life was to fulfill them that's right and you're here to fulfill it too we're here to fulfill the word we're here to fulfill the word first thessalonians 4 revelations 19 the marriage of the lamb has come that's right here right now going on and his wife has made herself ready unto her was granted she'd be right in fine linen and clean and white the rices of saints i mean we put on he says here's the wedding gown here's my righteousness put it on at fencing you'll find it's tailor-made hallelujah for your for your inside man not for this physical man but the inside man this fits me just well hallelu you know i remember um brother ron peterson he um this is years ago in christchurch he came over the dedication of the church the first time and he related this dream he had when he was gathered around the throne and you know the crowns were being given out and his name was called yeah everyone's there rejoicing and you know and then and then you know it goes up before the lord and the lord puts the crown upon his head and he's thinking in the dream i wonder how he knows my hat size you know it fits so well and then and then and then other names are called out and then and then brother brown's name's called out and they're looking around where is he and he's actually i hope i don't get this wrong but he's like walking the other way because he feels so unworthy and two brothers had to pick him up by their arms pick him up and put him down and before the lord and the lord put the crown on his head and then before he even stood up he said no lord this is all you and then as soon as he did that this emotion just came over everyone came up brother ron saying that's so true and they put their crowns down before the lord it's like this big pile of crowns was just formed and formed the law was at the top of it and all this glory of the lord just swept over all the people hallelujah but you know he thinks how does the crown fit i mean how does the lord know well it's made for you hallelujah hallelujah this this word fits us just right amen and you're here to fulfill it too just walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism you'll get criticism but walk unconscious of don't let it bother you don't let fear drag you down of course the devil's gonna try and disable our walk that shouldn't be a shock you know we should be very aware of that but just walk unconscious of it i mean walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious unto the world walk as you walk in christ walk with him not paying any attention the right or left hand just keep moving on if something comes up in the church walk with god see don't if something comes up in the church fellowship with that walk with god right if sickness strikes walk with god don't worship the sickness just keep walking with god if the neighbor don't like you walk with god just keep on walking with god see enoch one day walked like that you know what he had done he walked all the way home with god just as far up the road he didn't want to come back anymore amen walk with god doctor says you're going to die walk with god yeah doctor says you can't get well walk with god that's all for god has promised i'll never leave you nor forsake you i'll be with you to the end of the world he took an oath and by that covenant that he give you he would confirm it just walk with god then he says you'll have your ups and downs don't worry you've got you've got to go through briar patches over sharp rocks over bluffs down over hillsides up up mountains over waters but walk with god yes sir there's so many hills to climb up with you've heard the old song but how little will seem when you get to the end of the way my my just look at there all that's been look back at your footprints it won't be very much when we get to the end of the way so no matter what comes up walk with god stay with his word trouble comes up strife just walk with god amen i'll leave i'll leave you with this one quote it's the most powerful thing i've ever known of is as a committal commit thy ways unto the lord commit your thinking to him if you're sick and the doctors can't help you no more then just commit your case to god and act like it's already done something will have to take place it's just can't keep from it because god is a creator so perfect faith commits its way to the lord right it's a real committal that is real faith if you've got real faith this morning just commit all things commit your ways to the lord you'll have your ups and downs hardship whatever more but keep walking with god amen the apostle paul walked with god hallelujah he walked to the chopping block one day he didn't fear the chopping block amen he said i've got a crown laying up before me and all that love is glorious appearing so let's just keep walking with god let the revelation of the word govern your life not your emotions not your memories not your affections whatever just let god guide you and he will see you through and when your enemies come up against you they will stumble and fall remember it's not that him that wins the battle it's him that wins the war is the victor right napoleon won a lot of battles but he lost waterloo lost it all right the devil may have won a lot of battles against you but the war's not over pick up your sword charge don't accept no retreat no surrender but it's he that wins the war is is the victor amen so let the lord win
