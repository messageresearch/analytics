[0:00] and I wear pretty frail human beings
[0:02] really we we think we're tough but we're
[0:04] not really
[0:05] and the older we get the more we realize
[0:08] we're not very really that tough at all
[0:10] physically or mentally
[0:12] really
[0:14] but
[0:15] the Bible says he will keep him in
[0:17] perfect peace whose mind has stayed on
[0:19] him
[0:21] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[0:23] their strength
[0:24] now I don't know how these things work
[0:25] but when you do them they work
[0:28] and how that's all that matters if it
[0:29] works do it if God says it works it
[0:31] works so we're happy to be here tonight
[0:34] we've got a good um
[0:36] program on
[0:38] in terms of
[0:41] that I think the Lord is going to be
[0:42] present with us and feel welcome to be
[0:44] in our midst we've got um some good
[0:46] singing some items and we're looking
[0:49] forward to a good word tonight
[0:51] and I believe that we will all leave
[0:52] here better than the way we were when we
[0:55] came and and more closer to the Lord and
[0:58] that's what we're after
[1:00] amen now just before we get into it I've
[1:04] got a few announcements to make
[1:08] um
[1:09] the first one here we've got a there's a
[1:12] few little berries around
[1:14] that I think some of the little fellas
[1:16] were deciding might be good for lunch
[1:18] but I don't think that they are
[1:20] and um one of the sisters saw a little
[1:23] guy
[1:24] beginning to have a chew on some of
[1:25] these we took a photo of it
[1:28] you can't eat these things
[1:30] so if you're a little fellow don't eat
[1:31] these things they're laying around on
[1:33] the concrete and that sort of thing so
[1:35] they're a little red berry
[1:41] so little guys or parents look out for
[1:43] those things and don't eat them
[1:46] I mean
[1:48] um
[1:48] we've got the the dinner setup
[1:53] uh was a wee bit messed up so
[1:56] I think dinner was set to be said to be
[1:58] at 5 30 and then the guys preparing the
[2:01] dinner were there at 10 past five twenty
[2:03] minutes early but the dinner was
[2:05] actually five so the guy's preparing had
[2:07] to be there at
[2:09] 20 months before that
[2:10] so ignore the schedule dinner is at five
[2:13] o'clock so if you've got the dinner set
[2:15] up you've got to be there 20 minutes
[2:16] before that otherwise when you get there
[2:18] dinner's already being served and you
[2:19] didn't set it up if you didn't who did
[2:22] was it set up it's a all by yourself
[2:28] brother that's taking the taking one for
[2:30] the team
[2:31] amen
[2:32] um now the other one is the swimming
[2:34] pool
[2:35] um this is just for the Camp's sake
[2:37] I think today and I was the same we sort
[2:40] of left our children there and said to
[2:41] you know brother Andrew look after my
[2:42] children I'm going to go and go for a
[2:43] walk or something but apparently if your
[2:46] child's in the pool under 16 you have to
[2:48] be there looking after it you can't I
[2:50] can't just tell someone else to look
[2:51] after my child and I think half of the
[2:53] children in there there were probably
[2:54] four parents on the pool and about 30
[2:56] children and I'm pretty sure they didn't
[2:58] have that many kids each
[2:59] hahaha
[3:01] so
[3:02] yeah that's just the way that the camp
[3:03] works if something happens then the camp
[3:05] is quite liable for that
[3:07] and brother Cuban asked me to bring the
[3:09] youth to the front but
[3:11] they're already here
[3:13] our surround sound system is here
[3:15] amen
[3:17] okay and now
[3:20] I'm going to ask someone to open a
[3:22] prayer this evening and I don't know who
[3:24] it's going to be
[3:25] but
[3:27] this is something I heard from Perry
[3:29] green
[3:31] when he visited New Zealand he said he
[3:33] went down to invercargill and he
[3:35] preached
[3:36] maybe at the Wharf he just preached and
[3:38] he said because the Bible says
[3:40] that after you've received the Holy
[3:42] Ghost you know go and bring this word to
[3:45] the outermost part of the earth and he
[3:46] sort of did his um
[3:48] geographical math and realize well if
[3:49] I'm in New Zealand I go down to there
[3:51] that's technically from where it was
[3:52] spoken that's the uttermost part of the
[3:54] earth so he thought he fulfilled the
[3:55] scripture
[3:56] uttermost part of the Earth
[3:59] and I think he might be right because
[4:00] we're a wee bit lower than um I think
[4:02] it's South America Chile and that sort
[4:03] of that but there so I want to find out
[4:06] here
[4:07] whichever brother is closest to the
[4:09] uttermost part of the earth you're going
[4:11] to pray
[4:14] so now
[4:15] if you're from South Island can you
[4:17] stand up
[4:18] and we'll just work our way down
[4:24] the brothers okay so anyone in there's a
[4:26] little town called I think it's Nelson
[4:33] Nelson can sit down is it
[4:36] is it you
[4:37] okay they know so is he the uttermost
[4:39] part brother Jason you're the outermost
[4:41] part of the Earth
[4:44] really has he really
[4:52] were they in Europe man
[4:56] come up brother no no come on that's all
[4:58] good no up here
[5:16] dealer Jesus I just want to thank you

[1:04:48] Lord you said because there are two or
[1:04:51] three here that believe
[1:04:53] that you would come in the midst of us
[1:04:55] Lord
[1:04:56] I'm convinced father that there are more
[1:04:58] than two or three that believe
[1:05:01] and you know it better than I do Lord
[1:05:04] father as we approach your word tonight
[1:05:06] we've sung the songs of Zion we have
[1:05:09] looked to you Lord we've made our
[1:05:12] requests known we've entered in with
[1:05:14] expectations even now is Lord we're
[1:05:18] approaching you in prayer there might be
[1:05:20] somebody that says Lord you know what I
[1:05:22] have need of tonight father there's no
[1:05:24] secrets hidden from you you are the
[1:05:27] discerner of every thought and intent of
[1:05:30] every Heart Lord
[1:05:31] Lord you divide asunder between Soul and
[1:05:34] Spirit you make known your will and your
[1:05:37] purpose for our lives and so Lord as we
[1:05:39] yield ourselves to you we I just want
[1:05:42] Lord to let us go aside of any
[1:05:45] thought that I might have how this
[1:05:47] service would go
[1:05:49] Lord you know
[1:05:51] we've the people have had a full day
[1:05:55] they might be a little bit tired
[1:05:57] we've sung many songs
[1:06:00] we've listened to some wonderful
[1:06:01] specials
[1:06:03] but Lord we want to say we're never too
[1:06:06] tired for you Lord
[1:06:09] and Lord you know our endurance as far
[1:06:11] as what the human body can endure
[1:06:14] so Lord you just direct the service
[1:06:16] tonight the way that you would want it
[1:06:18] as our brother said out of the realm of
[1:06:20] human instrumentality or control
[1:06:23] May the Holy Spirit Lord may you just
[1:06:27] brood over us have your perfect way we
[1:06:31] ask your blessing upon the reading of
[1:06:33] the word and the hearing of it For Your
[1:06:35] Glory
[1:06:36] in Christ's name amen
[1:06:39] amen thank you musicians how many
[1:06:41] appreciate the musicians
[1:06:43] amount
[1:06:48] hey man let's take our Bibles and turn
[1:06:50] to the first Epistle of Peter
[1:06:58] I enjoyed the message this morning
[1:07:01] and uh
[1:07:03] brother Ben it seems like every time he
[1:07:05] got going on a vein he found himself uh
[1:07:10] strangely
[1:07:11] sidetracked that was me
[1:07:16] I had to stop him a few times lest he go
[1:07:20] in a direction that I was planning on
[1:07:21] going in tonight or tomorrow morning and
[1:07:24] uh and so I there was times where he
[1:07:27] started on a vein and I said I'm not
[1:07:28] saying Amen to that
[1:07:31] that's true but it's in my notes too
[1:07:35] the Lord has a mind for this weekend
[1:07:37] amen
[1:07:38] and we're so thankful that God is the
[1:07:41] one that's in control it doesn't matter
[1:07:43] who's standing behind the desk it
[1:07:46] matters who's standing behind the one
[1:07:47] that's standing behind the desk
[1:07:50] amen First Peter chapter one and let's
[1:07:53] read from verse 3 if we could
[1:07:56] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:07:58] Lord Jesus Christ which according to His
[1:08:01] abundant Mercy has begotten us again
[1:08:04] unto a lively Hope by the resurrection
[1:08:08] of Jesus Christ from the dead I don't
[1:08:10] want to carry on unless you miss that
[1:08:12] there because sometimes the Bible uses
[1:08:15] different terminology for the same
[1:08:17] phrase begotten us again means to be
[1:08:20] born again
[1:08:21] all right so he has birthed us again or
[1:08:24] we have been born again unto a lively
[1:08:28] Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:08:30] from the dead comma
[1:08:33] to an inheritance incorruptible
[1:08:38] undefiled and that fadeth not away
[1:08:42] reserved in heaven for you
[1:08:45] all right that word Reserve means
[1:08:48] preserved by guarding
[1:08:51] all right so there has been an
[1:08:52] inheritance that has been guarded
[1:08:55] all right but now we have come to the
[1:08:58] age where it is no longer reserved in
[1:09:01] heaven
[1:09:02] but now it has been claimed by the lamb
[1:09:06] who paid the price who alone was worthy
[1:09:09] to redeem the book what was the book it
[1:09:12] was the book that Adam lost
[1:09:14] and now has been claimed by the land
[1:09:17] back for the for the bride his bride the
[1:09:21] Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:09:23] who are kept by the power of God through
[1:09:27] faith unto salvation ready to be
[1:09:30] revealed when in the last time what time
[1:09:36] are we living in the last time amen the
[1:09:38] Lord had his Blessing to the word you
[1:09:40] may be seated
[1:09:43] reserved in heaven
[1:09:45] revealed in the last time
[1:09:48] I want to speak about the revealed
[1:09:50] inheritance in our attitude towards the
[1:09:53] revealed inheritance
[1:09:55] because the inheritance and inheritance
[1:09:58] is not something that you earned
[1:10:02] an inheritance is something that was
[1:10:04] given to you by virtue of a birth
[1:10:08] and the Bible says here that we were
[1:10:09] begotten again to an inheritance many
[1:10:13] times people think well you know I just
[1:10:15] need to get saved and be born again and
[1:10:17] you know then I've Got My Ticket punched
[1:10:19] for the Rapture or I know that if I die
[1:10:22] I'll go to heaven because after all we
[1:10:24] want to be in heaven we don't want to be
[1:10:26] in hell and with and the same stands
[1:10:28] true tonight you want to be sure you
[1:10:30] make it to glory and you want to be sure
[1:10:32] you don't wind up in Hell there is a
[1:10:35] heaven and there is a hell
[1:10:37] am I the only one that believes that
[1:10:39] amen there is a heaven and there is a
[1:10:41] hell
[1:10:42] amen and so we realize that that's often
[1:10:45] where we go to as Christians but but now
[1:10:48] in the last days there's been a further
[1:10:51] revelation of the word as our brother
[1:10:53] spoke this morning the revelation of the
[1:10:56] sons of God that the whole of creation
[1:10:58] was groaning and travailing for
[1:11:02] all right something's not plugged in
[1:11:04] here you want to check that for me
[1:11:13] thank you
[1:11:16] we're there now testing
[1:11:19] yes you adjusted
[1:11:23] testing one two three is that better
[1:11:26] that's I can hear myself now
[1:11:30] praise the Lord no wonder you weren't
[1:11:31] saying amen
[1:11:36] put your hand over here and say we can't
[1:11:37] hear you brother Tim
[1:11:38] all right
[1:11:41] an inheritance
[1:11:42] reserved in heaven
[1:11:45] but revealed in the last time
[1:11:48] an inheritance that we didn't earn
[1:11:50] but an inheritance that we were born to
[1:11:54] not just born to be a Christian not just
[1:11:57] born to be be uh to make it to heaven
[1:12:00] but as our brother said this morning uh
[1:12:03] that we are the whole of creation was
[1:12:05] groaning and travailing waiting for what
[1:12:08] the revelation of the sons of God the
[1:12:12] time when the Revelation would come what
[1:12:14] it really meant for Sons and Daughters
[1:12:16] of God to really be in the mind of God
[1:12:19] because you know the Bible talks about
[1:12:21] it in the book of I believe it is job
[1:12:23] where God says to job where were you
[1:12:25] when I laid the foundations of the world
[1:12:28] tell me if you can where were you when
[1:12:30] the morning Stars sang together and the
[1:12:33] sons of God shouted for Joy God was
[1:12:35] describing something there and asking
[1:12:37] job if he could if he could know that in
[1:12:39] other words God said in my mind way back
[1:12:42] before there was a universe I saw the
[1:12:45] sons of God shouting for Joy I saw that
[1:12:48] there would come a time when in
[1:12:50] accompaniment to the morning stars that
[1:12:53] they would be rejoicing over the
[1:12:55] Revelation that I give them
[1:12:57] my sometimes we think oh it was an
[1:12:59] incident no it was in the mind of God
[1:13:01] before the foundation of the world and
[1:13:03] God saw it there and God said to Job do
[1:13:05] you understand these things job didn't
[1:13:07] understand them but now in the days of
[1:13:09] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:13:11] shall begin to sound all the mystery is
[1:13:14] finished
[1:13:15] amen and so here we are now we have we
[1:13:18] have come to the realization this is the
[1:13:20] hour of the revelation of the sons of
[1:13:23] God where God has revealed what it is to
[1:13:27] be an attribute of God manifested in
[1:13:30] this age praise the Lord
[1:13:33] amen is anybody excited about living in
[1:13:36] this age
[1:13:38] amen I hope you're not too tired tonight
[1:13:41] but it's so it's it's an inheritance now
[1:13:43] what it was it was something that Adam
[1:13:46] had
[1:13:47] that if we could fully realize what has
[1:13:50] been put into the hands of the Bride
[1:13:51] that it was lost by Adam by the Fall In
[1:13:54] the Garden of Eden and I know this is
[1:13:56] simple to most of you but it's just so
[1:13:58] we're all on the same page
[1:14:00] even though we got to be in one mind and
[1:14:02] one Accord amen
[1:14:04] and so is Adam Lost In the Garden of
[1:14:06] Eden it went didn't go into Satan's
[1:14:08] hands but it went into the hands of the
[1:14:11] original owner it went into the hands of
[1:14:14] God reserved in the heavens but in the
[1:14:17] last days Revelation 5 the lamb would
[1:14:20] step forth to claim the book to redeem
[1:14:23] the book John was told there was a voice
[1:14:27] that went out and said who's worthy to
[1:14:29] open the book and to loose the seals
[1:14:31] thereof and to look thereong and then
[1:14:34] and John said there was nobody found
[1:14:36] worthy in heaven or on Earth or under
[1:14:37] the Earth and John wept because nobody
[1:14:40] was worthy now what a difference it was
[1:14:42] John weeping versus what God saw in the
[1:14:47] beginning when he said the sons of God
[1:14:48] shouted for joy
[1:14:51] now John was weeping but the angel said
[1:14:54] wheat not John
[1:14:55] for the lion of the tribe of Judah has
[1:14:58] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[1:15:01] the seals thereof and John turned and
[1:15:03] saw a lamb as it had been slain and he
[1:15:05] took the book and John rejoiced he says
[1:15:08] I Rejoice so much still Heaven hurt and
[1:15:11] that those that are on the earth hurt
[1:15:12] everybody heard I think we heard John's
[1:15:15] voice
[1:15:16] amen why because John was rejoicing just
[1:15:19] like God saw in his mind before the
[1:15:22] foundation of the world that when this
[1:15:24] Revelation is made known those that
[1:15:27] receive the revelation will rejoice
[1:15:33] now it's only in this last time as we
[1:15:35] said last night bride time
[1:15:37] not and uh we certainly heard this
[1:15:40] morning that the bride is taken from
[1:15:42] every age but not every age is the
[1:15:44] bright age
[1:15:45] only in the last time when the book is
[1:15:47] redeemed does the church change to bride
[1:15:50] form or in other words the form that all
[1:15:53] of them down Through the Ages wanted to
[1:15:55] get into really as brother Branham said
[1:15:58] we're an advanced Lutheran Church
[1:16:01] come on we're an advanced Methodist
[1:16:04] Church
[1:16:05] we're an advanced Pentecostal Church
[1:16:07] what has happened in the last days if
[1:16:09] Luther would have carried on he'd
[1:16:10] arrived at this point today if Wesley
[1:16:13] would have carried on he had arrived at
[1:16:14] this point today but it was reserved for
[1:16:17] his bride in this hour
[1:16:22] now let's just look for a moment back at
[1:16:24] the at what it was that was lost the
[1:16:26] inheritance
[1:16:29] as we look back at the Garden of Eden
[1:16:31] and brother Branham describes it in a
[1:16:33] couple of places
[1:16:34] and he says
[1:16:36] in the beginning
[1:16:38] the Holy Spirit began to brood over a
[1:16:41] bleak desert
[1:16:43] when there was nothing and had never
[1:16:45] been nothing but the Holy Spirit was
[1:16:47] sent from God
[1:16:49] not an intellectual
[1:16:51] see now he's saying it's it's a brooding
[1:16:54] of the holy spirit it's not an
[1:16:55] intellectual power
[1:16:57] that's why you know science today is
[1:16:59] looking to try and get to Mars
[1:17:02] to try try and create some Colony over
[1:17:04] there and try and try and put Humanity
[1:17:07] on there maybe reclaim Mars or something
[1:17:09] it'll never work because they're doing
[1:17:12] it by intellect
[1:17:14] it's got to be done by the Holy Spirit
[1:17:17] all right so the Holy Spirit brewed it
[1:17:19] over the Earth the Holy Spirit was sent
[1:17:21] from the presence of God to make love
[1:17:24] over the Earth and he stretched his big
[1:17:27] wings around the earth and began to make
[1:17:29] love or to brood coup over the Earth
[1:17:32] I can see calcium and potash coming
[1:17:35] together
[1:17:36] and a little Easter lily stood up
[1:17:39] the Holy Spirit brewed it out of the
[1:17:41] earth and he kept brooding and as he
[1:17:43] crude and brooded I began to see trees
[1:17:46] come up and birds begin to fly from the
[1:17:49] Earth
[1:17:49] animals begin to walk
[1:17:52] and he then he kept chewing
[1:17:55] and a man come up called Adam
[1:17:58] hallelujah what was God doing he was
[1:18:01] manifesting his thoughts
[1:18:04] he was expressing his love
[1:18:07] the attributes the predestinated
[1:18:09] attributes that he had in his mind
[1:18:11] before the foundation of the world you
[1:18:14] were in his mind before the foundation
[1:18:16] of the world and God couldn't live
[1:18:19] without you being manifested and that's
[1:18:22] why he did what he did that's why he
[1:18:25] made a creation that's why he made a
[1:18:28] universe that's why he brewed it over
[1:18:30] the Earth that's why he made a Garden of
[1:18:32] Eden that's why he put his son in that
[1:18:35] Garden of Eden because we were in his
[1:18:37] mind
[1:18:39] Hallelujah he had us in his thoughts
[1:18:42] Desiring to fellowship with us
[1:18:47] he says he goes on in power
[1:18:49] transformation 1965 he says now we find
[1:18:51] everything in order
[1:18:53] God spoke it he said let there be let
[1:18:55] there be and let there be a need and let
[1:18:58] there be beautiful flowers let there be
[1:19:00] my son in my own image stand over there
[1:19:02] in the Garden of Eden and let his bride
[1:19:05] stand by his side oh how beautiful what
[1:19:09] that was and the father he was a father
[1:19:11] you see so there come his own children
[1:19:14] coming forth and he made a paradise for
[1:19:17] them
[1:19:19] God loves to do things for his children
[1:19:26] we were represented there in the Garden
[1:19:28] of Eden
[1:19:30] the title deed that the lamb redeemed
[1:19:33] had our name on it
[1:19:35] but before the lamb redeemed it it was
[1:19:37] the hand of him that sat on the throne
[1:19:39] but before it was in the hand of him
[1:19:41] that sat on the throne Adam had it
[1:19:45] yeah so we were represented there in the
[1:19:47] Garden of Eden
[1:19:49] and our our the we were the thoughts of
[1:19:51] God that was expressed and put into the
[1:19:53] hands of Adam but Adam fell and so we
[1:19:57] came by the permissive will of God we
[1:19:59] came by the way of sexual desire rather
[1:20:02] than by the spoken word and that's why
[1:20:04] we have to be born again
[1:20:06] because that's which is born of flesh is
[1:20:09] flesh and that which is born of spirit
[1:20:12] is spirit and so we were born first by
[1:20:16] flesh desire but then we have to be
[1:20:18] reborn and being reborn by the spirit of
[1:20:21] God that brings us back to our
[1:20:24] inheritance
[1:20:25] all right so I want you to catch now
[1:20:28] that down Through the Ages that man by
[1:20:31] the new birth since the book of Acts
[1:20:33] because we've been in a day of Pentecost
[1:20:35] since the book of Acts we've been in the
[1:20:37] Feast of Pentecost all down through
[1:20:39] seven Church ages the Holy Ghost as as
[1:20:42] Peter said on the day of Pentecost the
[1:20:44] promise is unto you and to your children
[1:20:47] and them that are afar off even as many
[1:20:50] as the Lord Our God shall call and so
[1:20:52] there was a there's been a a baptism of
[1:20:55] the Holy Ghost down Through the Ages the
[1:20:57] problem was that it didn't produce what
[1:20:59] it was meant to produce and so they you
[1:21:02] see if they didn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:21:04] in any age then they don't have the
[1:21:07] resurrection
[1:21:09] but they had to have Resurrection Life
[1:21:11] to go into the ground and so brother
[1:21:13] Branham saying there was Holy Ghost
[1:21:15] filled Believers in every age and as
[1:21:18] that that
[1:21:19] comes and they're looking at that but
[1:21:21] the power of the Holy Ghost was bound by
[1:21:24] Creeds and dogmas down through the
[1:21:27] church ages now what that means is that
[1:21:28] it was bound by teaching all right now
[1:21:32] let me just um
[1:21:35] let me just read you something here
[1:21:38] brother random says if you've got the
[1:21:40] Holy Ghost
[1:21:41] he says the power that will raise us up
[1:21:43] is in us now
[1:21:45] we are now in Heavenly places we are now
[1:21:48] in the power of the Resurrection
[1:21:50] then he says if there wasn't a law to
[1:21:52] that Sons and Daughters would create
[1:21:54] them a world to go out here and go live
[1:21:56] a private life on it
[1:21:58] that's how much power is in every holy
[1:22:00] ghost-filled believer how many Holy
[1:22:02] Ghost Field Believers We Got Tonight
[1:22:05] amen so the power that's in you is
[1:22:07] enough power to create because God
[1:22:10] created by Divine love that's the
[1:22:12] greatest power that there is that is the
[1:22:15] Holy Ghost
[1:22:16] as a prophet of God was caught on the
[1:22:18] other side and the angel told him said
[1:22:20] this is what you taught was the Holy
[1:22:22] Ghost this is divine love
[1:22:24] all right so Divine love or the Holy
[1:22:27] Ghost is the greatest power there is
[1:22:28] that's what comes into the Believer by
[1:22:30] the new birth all right so that coming
[1:22:32] into our lives puts a power within us
[1:22:35] that if there wasn't a law to it that we
[1:22:37] would speak a world into existence and
[1:22:39] go and live on it brother Branham says
[1:22:40] you have the power in you to do it if
[1:22:42] you've got a shadow of the power of God
[1:22:45] in you you got power to do it he says
[1:22:48] that's what power is in the church now
[1:22:50] but it's controlled by Allah and that
[1:22:53] law is not the keeping of a bunch of
[1:22:54] Commandments it's a law of faith
[1:22:58] are you with me
[1:22:59] in other words it's governed by
[1:23:01] revelation
[1:23:02] and as much word as God reveals to you
[1:23:05] that's as much as you can believe that's
[1:23:07] as much of the power of God that is
[1:23:09] loosed right within the believer let me
[1:23:12] just stop here for a moment and say
[1:23:13] you've got enough
[1:23:15] of God if you
[1:23:18] get in you to heal every sickness
[1:23:23] you got enough power of God within you
[1:23:25] to defeat every devil
[1:23:28] but the problem is we get ourselves in
[1:23:30] the way
[1:23:31] you see it's actually it actually has to
[1:23:33] do with the clogging up of our Spirits
[1:23:35] or our minds the reasoning memory
[1:23:37] conscience imaginations and and those
[1:23:40] kinds of things why because in our mind
[1:23:42] is the greatest battle ever fought
[1:23:43] and the devil's objective is to try and
[1:23:46] clog up the channels through which God
[1:23:48] wants to bring the power of the Holy
[1:23:50] Ghost or the power of divine love but
[1:23:53] the object of the word is to clear those
[1:23:56] channels
[1:23:57] and lose the power of God within the
[1:24:00] life of the believer
[1:24:02] God has one objective and that is to
[1:24:04] bring sons of God to the power that they
[1:24:07] were always meant to be because what
[1:24:09] Adam displayed there in the Garden of
[1:24:11] Eden my Divine Love by Perfect Faith by
[1:24:14] by the power of an amateur Creator the
[1:24:17] second Adam came back and showed us once
[1:24:19] again
[1:24:20] then he was the love of God in the
[1:24:22] fullness of its power and he displayed
[1:24:25] what US of God was meant to be I wonder
[1:24:28] if it's at all
[1:24:31] at all possible to to turn it off
[1:24:32] because I that means I can't walk over
[1:24:34] here I just get blinded when I do it and
[1:24:36] I I Feel Like That Old Black preacher
[1:24:38] that brother Brown knew he saw a preach
[1:24:40] he says you ain't got enough room up
[1:24:41] here for me to preach
[1:24:43] praise the Lord
[1:24:45] he says he says that's what power is in
[1:24:47] the church now but it's controlled by
[1:24:50] Allah
[1:24:51] oh it's gonna you're gonna turn that off
[1:24:52] well I'm gonna need that in a little bit
[1:24:55] so so now we have a paradox
[1:24:59] all right uh when I needed I guess
[1:25:02] you'll turn it on I'm sorry I shouldn't
[1:25:04] have said nothing
[1:25:06] he says
[1:25:07] that's what power is in the church now
[1:25:09] but it's controlled by a law
[1:25:12] and that law is not keeping a bunch of
[1:25:14] Commandments it's the law of Faith Jesus
[1:25:16] said all things are possible to them
[1:25:18] that believe
[1:25:20] if you can believe it whatever God will
[1:25:23] lead your soul to believe that is yours
[1:25:28] no he says whatever God will lead your
[1:25:31] soul to believe not whatever your flesh
[1:25:33] will lead your mind to believe
[1:25:36] amen a lot of people take take all
[1:25:39] things are possible to them that believe
[1:25:40] and try and put it in a fleshly context
[1:25:42] well praise God I'm going to believe God
[1:25:44] for a Mercedes
[1:25:46] or I'm going to believe God for a
[1:25:48] million dollars I'm going to believe God
[1:25:49] that I'm going to win the lottery that's
[1:25:51] just the flesh but whatever God leads
[1:25:53] your soul to believe because that power
[1:25:56] lays within your soul and it must come
[1:25:58] by the revelation of the word you won't
[1:26:00] find the revelation of the word giving
[1:26:02] you a Mercedes or giving you a million
[1:26:04] dollars or those kind of things now if
[1:26:06] you needed it God would give it to you
[1:26:09] praise the Lord I haven't met anybody
[1:26:11] yet that needed it matter of fact most
[1:26:13] people are like the Rich Young Ruler
[1:26:14] they need less of it
[1:26:17] praise the Lord you got a few amens on
[1:26:19] that I was scared I wasn't going to get
[1:26:21] any
[1:26:24] every place The Souls of your foot can
[1:26:27] set upon by faith God gives it to you
[1:26:30] amen it's yours you possess it if you
[1:26:33] can find the key to this law of faith
[1:26:36] that opens it to you
[1:26:38] if you're a son or daughter of God
[1:26:41] listen now if you're a son or daughter
[1:26:43] of God
[1:26:45] that never leaves you
[1:26:47] it's with you all the time
[1:26:50] but your faith gets away from it
[1:26:53] but it's still there
[1:26:56] see that's what was a problem down
[1:26:58] through the church Ages was that their
[1:27:01] faith or their Revelation got away from
[1:27:04] the power of God that was within them
[1:27:06] you see the devil's desire was to take
[1:27:09] the word out of the hands of the people
[1:27:11] but God said in the last days I will
[1:27:14] restore saith the Lord
[1:27:19] are you with me so far
[1:27:23] now I always tell people when you quit
[1:27:25] pulling I'll quit preaching
[1:27:27] all right so as long as you pull I'll
[1:27:30] preach if you pull till two in the
[1:27:32] morning I'll preach till two in the
[1:27:33] morning
[1:27:34] all right
[1:27:36] and I hate to say it but I doubt you can
[1:27:38] do it
[1:27:41] but doubt your doubts amen
[1:27:43] if you can do it all things are possible
[1:27:46] to them that believe
[1:27:48] amen praise the Lord now brother Branham
[1:27:50] says Christ in Christ the mystery God
[1:27:52] revealed he says now what's a threefold
[1:27:54] purpose
[1:27:55] we realize God has a Redemptive purpose
[1:27:58] and he's had it down through six
[1:28:00] thousand years and we are the the
[1:28:02] fortunate ones that get to live in the
[1:28:05] last days at the climax of it all
[1:28:07] he says what's the threefold purpose to
[1:28:10] manifest himself in Jesus Christ to come
[1:28:13] into the body of Jesus Christ to have
[1:28:16] the preeminence to what restore back
[1:28:19] Eden bring back what was lost
[1:28:23] he goes on and says another place Christ
[1:28:25] the second Adam in life redeems his
[1:28:28] bride from death and now on his way back
[1:28:31] to the original
[1:28:33] Eden restoring back his bride in
[1:28:37] Fellowship back with God again as
[1:28:39] husband and wife to the Garden of Eden
[1:28:42] Christ and his bride all right I want
[1:28:45] you to notice that now because when as
[1:28:47] we're dealing with this subject we we
[1:28:49] deal with a marriage relationship
[1:28:51] because even as Paul said in the book of
[1:28:53] Ephesians chapter 5 he says I show you a
[1:28:55] mystery
[1:28:56] you see it's a mystery in the church the
[1:28:59] mystery of a husband and a wife the
[1:29:01] mystery of how the husband's the head of
[1:29:03] the wife he says and the and the wife
[1:29:05] should submit herself to the husband and
[1:29:07] the husband should love his wife and
[1:29:08] give himself for and the wife should
[1:29:09] honor her husband he says but I speak
[1:29:12] concerning Christ in the church
[1:29:14] amen it's a mystery to that age they
[1:29:17] were so close to it but it was still a
[1:29:19] mystery why because the full mystery
[1:29:21] would only be made known in the last
[1:29:23] days of how God would regard his church
[1:29:26] as his wife and all the rights that
[1:29:29] would be bestowed upon her because that
[1:29:32] because of an inheritance and because of
[1:29:34] the restoration that is given back to
[1:29:37] the church
[1:29:38] all right now you see the message did
[1:29:40] not come
[1:29:41] to reveal the messenger
[1:29:46] the message in the messenger are one
[1:29:48] you can't separate them when God sends a
[1:29:51] message he sends it by a messenger and
[1:29:53] so there's no disregarding or
[1:29:55] discounting the messenger but it but
[1:29:57] nevertheless it's that's not the reason
[1:30:00] that God sent the message it was not to
[1:30:03] reveal who the messenger was it was to
[1:30:05] reveal who this bride was
[1:30:08] amen the the commission of the messenger
[1:30:10] was like an Eliezer go and get a bribe
[1:30:13] for Jesus Christ
[1:30:15] and as the prophet of God takes that
[1:30:18] subject in end time messenger and end
[1:30:20] time seed sign and a couple of messages
[1:30:22] just before the opening of the seals he
[1:30:25] turns to his commission is to go and get
[1:30:28] a bribe just before the opening of the
[1:30:31] word comes to get that bride just before
[1:30:34] the very equipment comes to the message
[1:30:36] to go out he says he's looking for
[1:30:38] character a character that'll stand
[1:30:40] still long enough to be clothed by the
[1:30:43] Garment of the word
[1:30:44] and then he says Lord let another place
[1:30:47] says Lord let that be mine the crowning
[1:30:49] of my Ministry that you might allow me
[1:30:51] to dress your bride in the wedding
[1:30:54] Garment of the word and so as God's
[1:30:57] moving his thoughts he's moving his
[1:30:59] Prophet he's moving his whole plan now
[1:31:01] it's been unfolding down Through the
[1:31:03] Ages all that was in God he would pour
[1:31:05] into Christ all that was in Christ he
[1:31:08] would pour into the church but in order
[1:31:10] to come to the third part of his
[1:31:11] Redemptive purpose that is Christ in the
[1:31:14] bride like Adam and Eve would be United
[1:31:15] as husband and wife and they would walk
[1:31:18] out together in another Millennium time
[1:31:20] in the in another Garden of Eden
[1:31:23] Hallelujah that's God's purpose so what
[1:31:26] has he done in the opening of the word
[1:31:27] well the lamb comes forth we know
[1:31:30] Revelation 5 and I trust you if you
[1:31:32] don't know it you can read it or study
[1:31:34] it and it's the end time turning of
[1:31:36] events the Turning of the corner
[1:31:39] you know we're not building a wall God's
[1:31:41] not building a wall he's building a
[1:31:43] house
[1:31:44] and it takes you know anybody can lay
[1:31:46] bricks down but it takes a stone Mason
[1:31:48] to turn a corner
[1:31:50] and God sent a stone Mason in the
[1:31:52] messenger of the last age that would
[1:31:55] identify you see it's something's taken
[1:31:57] place in heaven and there's got to be
[1:31:59] somebody identifying it's got to be a
[1:32:02] prophetic Vision to identify what's
[1:32:04] taking place in Heaven by speaking it on
[1:32:06] the earth it's just like when the Book
[1:32:08] of Revelation was written it had to be a
[1:32:10] prophet go out on the Isle of Patmos to
[1:32:12] catch the unfolding of events in a
[1:32:14] series of visions and then identify them
[1:32:17] or write them in a book of Revelation it
[1:32:19] had to be a prophet that could see those
[1:32:21] things and then record them and in the
[1:32:23] last days it had to be a prophet to see
[1:32:25] the events of this hour and interpret
[1:32:27] them by speaking them on the earth that
[1:32:29] a bride would catch it and specifically
[1:32:32] that a bride would catch who she is it
[1:32:34] will bring a response in her because in
[1:32:36] Revelation chapter 5 the cry went out
[1:32:39] who's worthy to open the book and who's
[1:32:40] worthy to loose the seals and the lamb
[1:32:43] stepped forward and I'll just give you a
[1:32:45] couple quotes out of the breach message
[1:32:46] from my poor memory and a lamb step
[1:32:49] forth where did he come from he come
[1:32:51] from the eternities
[1:32:52] he come from his father's throne
[1:32:55] where he's been making intercession for
[1:32:57] seven Church ages but he's moved from
[1:32:59] his his intercessory work now he's moved
[1:33:01] into his claiming work because he's got
[1:33:03] a purpose in it his purpose is not to
[1:33:05] end up just claiming a bride his purpose
[1:33:07] is that he would Rule and Reign on the
[1:33:09] throne of David forever
[1:33:11] so he's coming from his father's Throne
[1:33:14] praise the Lord he's going to his own
[1:33:16] throne but there's a son of man Ministry
[1:33:19] in between and in order to accomplish
[1:33:21] that he's gotta he's got to come now and
[1:33:24] brother random makes a statement he says
[1:33:25] he cries with a loud voice says when a
[1:33:29] lion roars who is he is the lion of the
[1:33:31] tribe of Judah
[1:33:33] she identifies he opens the book he
[1:33:36] takes the book as the lamb
[1:33:38] but he was called The Lion of the tribe
[1:33:40] of Judah is that right
[1:33:42] but now he comes he changes form in
[1:33:44] morphe in Revelation chapter 10 he
[1:33:46] appears as the mighty angel
[1:33:48] it's Christ with the Covenant aimed with
[1:33:51] the Covenant rainbow over his head he
[1:33:53] descends from heaven and cries with a
[1:33:55] loud voice and when he cries
[1:33:57] with a loud voice the Bible says as when
[1:34:00] a lion roar
[1:34:03] what is he doing he's identifying
[1:34:04] himself I'm the lion of the tribe of
[1:34:06] Judah but he hasn't fully turned into
[1:34:09] that form so he's in a process now in
[1:34:11] these last days what is the process he's
[1:34:14] cried he's called he sent a message he's
[1:34:17] called for his bride to come stand by
[1:34:20] his side
[1:34:22] you see because according to the law of
[1:34:24] adoption his brother Branham explains it
[1:34:27] he says Isaac could not inherit
[1:34:29] everything that Abraham had until he was
[1:34:32] married
[1:34:34] Isaac was a type of the promised son
[1:34:37] and so Christ could not inherit all
[1:34:40] things until he takes a wife
[1:34:43] and so he comes from his father's Throne
[1:34:46] takes the inheritance opens the book
[1:34:48] calls for his wife to come stand by his
[1:34:51] side because she has joined heirs with
[1:34:54] him
[1:34:57] praise be to God
[1:35:06] now inheritance means a lot because in
[1:35:08] inheritance there's got to be an owner
[1:35:14] there's got to be someone take
[1:35:15] possession of it
[1:35:17] when God made
[1:35:19] the heavens and the Earth
[1:35:21] the Bible says God said let there be
[1:35:24] light and there was light
[1:35:26] God called the daylight the light day
[1:35:28] and the Darkness night and he and God
[1:35:30] saw that it was good
[1:35:32] God separated different parts of
[1:35:35] creation and he said second day it was
[1:35:37] good third day he made more things it
[1:35:40] was good fourth day fifth day begins to
[1:35:42] bring up botany life and animal life and
[1:35:44] all those things it was good it was good
[1:35:47] then the Sun the moon the stars it was
[1:35:49] good but then he made man
[1:35:52] and then the the Bible says
[1:35:56] as he made man there and God saw
[1:35:59] everything that he had made and behold
[1:36:02] it was very good
[1:36:06] why well how does it change from good to
[1:36:09] very good because man's here
[1:36:12] it's because God made an inheritance but
[1:36:15] when someone is there to possess the
[1:36:17] inheritance then it's very good
[1:36:20] all right
[1:36:21] so now if we go to Genesis or rather to
[1:36:24] Exodus chapter 3 we don't have to turn
[1:36:26] with me but God says to the children of
[1:36:28] Israel he talks to them about an
[1:36:31] inheritance we left them off at kadish
[1:36:33] barnia last night and and uh how that
[1:36:36] God was dealing with them but as they as
[1:36:38] God promised them this land he said to
[1:36:41] Moses I've come down to deliver them out
[1:36:43] of the hand of the Egyptians and to
[1:36:45] bring them out of that land unto a good
[1:36:48] land
[1:36:49] a land unto a an a large and unto a land
[1:36:53] flowing with milk and honey
[1:36:55] and he describes that to them and then
[1:36:57] Israel comes out uh of Egypt goes
[1:37:00] through the Wilderness the 10 the 12
[1:37:02] Spies went over and of course 10 of them
[1:37:05] brought back an evil report but Joshua
[1:37:08] and Caleb looked at it differently than
[1:37:10] everybody else God said it was a good
[1:37:12] land the tens five says it's okay but
[1:37:16] there's Giants in Walled cities in the
[1:37:18] land and we're not able to possess it
[1:37:20] but Joshua and Caleb they they said as
[1:37:24] they rent their clothes they speak to
[1:37:26] the children of Israel and these are the
[1:37:27] words they said the land which we pass
[1:37:31] through to search it is an exceeding
[1:37:34] good land
[1:37:36] now what's taking place here's the ones
[1:37:40] to whom were meant to possess it
[1:37:43] and so they who had an inheritance God
[1:37:46] promised it to Abraham after he
[1:37:49] separated himself from lot lift up your
[1:37:50] eyes look to the north the South the
[1:37:52] East and the West I give you this land
[1:37:54] to you and to your seed and and and
[1:37:56] those that will come after you and so it
[1:37:58] was a promise it was an inheritance it
[1:38:01] was in the possession of the lineage of
[1:38:03] Abraham but now as they come in and spy
[1:38:06] out the land the ten spies don't look at
[1:38:08] it Through The Eyes of ownership
[1:38:11] but Joshua and Caleb as as Caleb later
[1:38:15] came back to Joshua and he said now
[1:38:18] Moses told me wherever my footsteps land
[1:38:21] I will have that as a possession Joshua
[1:38:25] give me my mountain
[1:38:29] amen it was an exceeding or a very good
[1:38:33] land for them because it was their land
[1:38:37] all right now the boy now down Through
[1:38:40] the Ages I could say it this way I guess
[1:38:42] this has been called the good book
[1:38:45] it's been a good gospel it's the good
[1:38:48] news
[1:38:49] that's what gospel means it's the good
[1:38:51] news but in the last days God takes the
[1:38:54] seal off the book
[1:38:55] in the last days God reveals the
[1:38:57] Mysteries that's hidden right within the
[1:38:59] book
[1:39:00] in the last days God brings it to the
[1:39:02] attention of the people and what does
[1:39:04] those people say Do they still say it's
[1:39:06] good news I say it's very good news
[1:39:10] I say this message is a very good
[1:39:12] message
[1:39:13] because it's not just anybody's message
[1:39:16] I take personal possession of this
[1:39:18] message this is not jeffersonville's
[1:39:21] message this was not William branham's
[1:39:24] message this is not a Church's message
[1:39:27] this is my message
[1:39:30] God wrote a love letter and he wrote it
[1:39:33] to me
[1:39:34] amen you've got to put your name there
[1:39:36] you got to claim it as a personal
[1:39:38] possession though a thousand fall on
[1:39:40] your right hand and ten thousand on your
[1:39:42] left it's not going to come now you
[1:39:44] because it's your land
[1:39:48] oh it's Marvel at the great warriors of
[1:39:50] Israel even to the modern era of Israel
[1:39:52] the great warriors that are in the land
[1:39:54] are the ones that say are not
[1:39:56] questioning if we can win the battle but
[1:39:59] how do we win the battle
[1:40:02] there's never a doubt in their minds
[1:40:04] saying oh I think we might lose this one
[1:40:06] no it's not a question of whether we win
[1:40:08] or lose it's just how are we going to
[1:40:09] win amen that ought to be the attitude
[1:40:11] of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:40:13] I mean we've read the last chapter in
[1:40:15] the book it's not whether we're going to
[1:40:16] win or lose we've already won because
[1:40:19] we're married to the mighty conqueror
[1:40:22] we are Mrs Mighty conqueror
[1:40:24] Hallelujah he's already won the battle
[1:40:27] and we're possessing it with them
[1:40:29] brother Bradham says it manifested sons
[1:40:31] of God he says now we're getting over
[1:40:33] into the book of Ephesians now the same
[1:40:36] way he's positionally placing the church
[1:40:38] where they belong
[1:40:40] Joshua placed them in the natural land
[1:40:42] now the holy spirit is placing the
[1:40:44] church positionally in the land
[1:40:47] in the position that they belong in
[1:40:50] their inheritance
[1:40:53] amen so I want you to catch that now
[1:40:56] it's our inheritance
[1:41:06] so the Garden of Eden speaks of the
[1:41:10] marriage relationship
[1:41:13] that's what we're going to
[1:41:18] but we we're going to the Garden of Eden
[1:41:21] but we have arrived at the marriage of
[1:41:24] the Lamb
[1:41:26] all right we're not going to the
[1:41:28] marriage we're not in boaz's field
[1:41:31] anymore we are in boaz's house
[1:41:35] amen we have been pregnated by the word
[1:41:38] of the hour
[1:41:39] we have received the word and it is
[1:41:42] created life within me I was thinking
[1:41:44] brother Ben was preaching this morning
[1:41:47] on the grave clothes and I thought you
[1:41:49] know
[1:41:50] only those that are dead need Grave
[1:41:52] clothes
[1:41:54] and and the reason they need Grave
[1:41:57] clothes is to hold the body together
[1:42:00] because there's no life in the body
[1:42:03] and if they did wrapped tightly in the
[1:42:05] grave clothes excuse me for saying it
[1:42:07] wait eventually their arm's gonna fall
[1:42:09] off
[1:42:10] eventually the parts of their body are
[1:42:12] going to fall away
[1:42:13] I'll bet they so they wrap them up tight
[1:42:15] to keep that all in one like sarcophagus
[1:42:18] but those that are alive don't need
[1:42:21] Grave clothes
[1:42:23] it's the life that means we don't need
[1:42:26] it and the Life coming into the body
[1:42:29] means that all the denominational Creed
[1:42:32] and all of the things that bound the
[1:42:34] church before can all fall by the
[1:42:36] wayside why because the life has come
[1:42:40] into the church through a marriage Union
[1:42:43] all right so we have arrived at the
[1:42:45] marriage of the Lamb the lion has called
[1:42:47] for the bride to come stand by his side
[1:42:51] amen
[1:42:57] amen are you still with me
[1:43:00] and to have America
[1:43:02] doesn't mean to be in marriage
[1:43:07] all right I just want to
[1:43:12] just bring you a thought here
[1:43:15] how many married couples have we got
[1:43:16] here
[1:43:20] Tony can I use you and your wife versus
[1:43:22] apple
[1:43:23] would that be all right is your wife
[1:43:25] would your wife be able to handle that
[1:43:26] she's not too shy is she all right why
[1:43:28] don't you come right up here okay
[1:43:33] all right now what's taking place as I
[1:43:36] said is the marriage Union between
[1:43:37] Christ and the church it's not shining
[1:43:39] so come right over
[1:43:41] amen
[1:43:44] now
[1:43:46] as the as the
[1:43:49] as Christ is moving to his throne the
[1:43:52] Throne of David
[1:43:54] the Bible talks about in the
[1:43:57] Philadelphia Church age he that has the
[1:43:59] Key of David
[1:44:01] and those of you that are familiar with
[1:44:02] that phrase will know where I'm going
[1:44:04] with this but as the Key of David
[1:44:07] represents something because it
[1:44:09] describes in the Bible that the key of
[1:44:12] the House of David will I lay upon his
[1:44:14] shoulder and None Shall shut and he and
[1:44:18] he shall shut and None Shall open and so
[1:44:21] this key uh which is represented by the
[1:44:25] son of David he said he alone has the
[1:44:28] use of the key for he alone opens and
[1:44:30] shots no man has the right but Christ
[1:44:32] himself but where is the key it's not in
[1:44:35] his hand it's not in his pocket it's on
[1:44:37] his shoulder all right so the shoulder
[1:44:40] represents something here and he and
[1:44:43] brother Branham goes to Isaiah 9 6 and
[1:44:45] says the government shall be upon his
[1:44:47] shoulder all right now catch this now
[1:44:49] because on the throne of David there's a
[1:44:52] government
[1:44:53] all right to him that overcometh in the
[1:44:56] last days will I grant to sit with me
[1:44:58] where
[1:44:59] in my throne
[1:45:01] all right so there's there's a
[1:45:03] transition that's taking place in the
[1:45:05] church now and he says what does it mean
[1:45:07] he says the phrase government upon his
[1:45:10] shoulder comes from the marriage
[1:45:12] ceremony of the East all right now
[1:45:16] sister this is clean all right
[1:45:20] I'm going to just give this to you for a
[1:45:22] moment this is a veil would you hold
[1:45:24] that
[1:45:25] now hold that just kind of so it partly
[1:45:27] covers your face don't let them see you
[1:45:29] now
[1:45:30] now we're just going to pretend you're
[1:45:32] not married yet okay and so there's a
[1:45:36] marriage ceremony of the East that has
[1:45:38] the bride is walked up the aisle or
[1:45:41] whatever way they did it in the East and
[1:45:43] she comes to her bridegroom
[1:45:45] now she has something that she has to do
[1:45:50] all right it's not all him he's paid the
[1:45:53] price he's a worthy man he's a Kinsmen
[1:45:57] Redeemer he fits all the types in the
[1:45:59] shadows but now she has the part that
[1:46:01] she has to play because this male
[1:46:03] represents something
[1:46:05] it represents the Virgin sea of the
[1:46:08] woman that she has kept herself from all
[1:46:12] other men and that's what the church has
[1:46:14] represented because they have had to
[1:46:17] have that attitude down Through the Ages
[1:46:20] and that attitude has been I'm keeping
[1:46:23] myself until the time that Christ
[1:46:25] Returns the churches staying pure the
[1:46:27] churches is staying uh apart but now
[1:46:30] she's come to a time in her life we'll
[1:46:32] go back to the Natural she's kept
[1:46:34] herself apart but she's coming to the
[1:46:36] light in the time of her life now that
[1:46:38] that attitude has to change
[1:46:41] she can't come to the marriage and come
[1:46:44] to her bridegroom and say
[1:46:46] don't touch me
[1:46:48] don't you come near me I'm keeping
[1:46:50] myself
[1:46:51] I've been taught all my life to keep
[1:46:52] myself
[1:46:54] don't you come near me
[1:46:56] that wouldn't be a bride would it
[1:46:58] that'd be a virgin
[1:46:59] all right but now in the marriage
[1:47:01] ceremony in the ceremony she would take
[1:47:04] this Veil and she would lay it upon his
[1:47:07] shoulder you may do that
[1:47:10] all right just like that
[1:47:12] and that brother Branham says represents
[1:47:14] something he says when the bride has
[1:47:16] been committed to the groom she takes
[1:47:18] off her veil and places it over the
[1:47:20] groom's shoulders signifying that not
[1:47:23] only is she under his Dominion that she
[1:47:27] has transferred her rights to him
[1:47:31] hello
[1:47:32] amen that's why we're liking unto Lambs
[1:47:35] all right we lay down ourselves
[1:47:37] willingly willingly be shared of all our
[1:47:39] rights and responsibilities and
[1:47:41] everything says she transferred her
[1:47:43] rights to him that he is the head
[1:47:46] but also that he Bears the
[1:47:48] responsibility all right now she's not
[1:47:51] just saying I give you my rights you're
[1:47:53] my head but now she's also saying you
[1:47:56] have a responsibility here you never had
[1:47:58] before
[1:48:00] amen you have a responsibility and the
[1:48:03] care he Bears the responsibility and the
[1:48:05] care and that he
[1:48:07] and he alone
[1:48:09] not her father
[1:48:12] come on when we when I I've married two
[1:48:15] daughters off so far when I walk those
[1:48:17] girls up the aisle and they ask the
[1:48:19] question who gives this woman to be
[1:48:21] married to this man and I say her mother
[1:48:23] and I do that's it my responsibility is
[1:48:26] over
[1:48:27] now I even say it this way Brothers if
[1:48:29] you want I often say to in marriage
[1:48:32] counseling I said you got seven years
[1:48:35] and then to blame it on the father
[1:48:38] what the woman is because seven years is
[1:48:41] a cycle but after seven years you've had
[1:48:43] the opportunity to mold her in your
[1:48:44] image she's all yours
[1:48:47] don't blame her family
[1:48:51] all right it's your fault what she is
[1:48:54] after seven years that's just the number
[1:48:56] maybe I plucked out of thin air but I
[1:48:57] think it has some background to it
[1:49:01] he Bears the responsibility and they
[1:49:03] care and he and he alone no one else no
[1:49:08] other man no other power has any right
[1:49:12] and responsibility
[1:49:14] amen so she's signifying something here
[1:49:17] oh ketchup Saints may the Lord open our
[1:49:19] eyes to this when the bride comes down
[1:49:22] to the last days and she comes to the
[1:49:25] marriage Union let us be glad and
[1:49:27] rejoice
[1:49:28] for the marriage of the Lamb has come no
[1:49:30] wonder there's a rejoicing because now
[1:49:32] she's not wondering anymore he is the
[1:49:34] man see the man he is the man and
[1:49:38] because he is the man no other man has
[1:49:40] any rights no other man has any
[1:49:42] responsibility and no other power has
[1:49:44] any rights over her Amen in the church
[1:49:47] giving herself as a bride to Jesus
[1:49:50] Christ she's acknowledging no other
[1:49:52] power has any rights over me
[1:49:54] the devil has no rights over me the
[1:49:57] enemy has no control over my life
[1:49:59] anymore I am the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:50:03] amen he says no other powers any right
[1:50:06] or responsibility that beloved is the
[1:50:08] Key of David God being Sovereign he
[1:50:11] foreknew by Divine Cree exactly who
[1:50:13] would be in his bride he chose her
[1:50:17] let me make it personal he chose you
[1:50:22] she or you did not choose him
[1:50:26] he called her now she had a Rite of
[1:50:29] rejection
[1:50:31] he chose her she could have said no
[1:50:35] but she didn't
[1:50:37] that makes her the wife
[1:50:40] you could have said no but you didn't
[1:50:44] that makes you the wife
[1:50:46] amen and so she he called her she did
[1:50:50] not come on her own I wasn't looking for
[1:50:52] a message
[1:50:55] I wasn't looking for a prophet
[1:50:58] I wasn't looking for any of this but God
[1:51:00] came by my way and when he revealed his
[1:51:03] word to me then I believed him he paid
[1:51:06] the price for her she belongs to him and
[1:51:09] to him alone she is Holy committed to
[1:51:12] him amen
[1:51:13] amen and he accepts the obligation amen
[1:51:17] and he and he is her head for Christ is
[1:51:22] the head of the church as Sarah called
[1:51:24] Abraham Lord
[1:51:26] don't use this too much when you go home
[1:51:29] even so the bride is happy for he is her
[1:51:32] Lord
[1:51:33] amen he speaks and she obeys because
[1:51:38] that is her Delight
[1:51:41] amen thank you brother Tony but I might
[1:51:43] need that God bless you thank you God
[1:51:46] bless you give them a hand
[1:51:56] isn't that wonderful
[1:52:00] see
[1:52:03] it's the attitude of the woman that has
[1:52:06] to change
[1:52:08] God's not interested in anybody he's
[1:52:11] only interested in his bride he has sent
[1:52:14] this message not for the world he has
[1:52:17] sent it for his bride
[1:52:19] all right now let me just let me just
[1:52:22] say this here now God is not interested
[1:52:25] brother Branham said in flirters
[1:52:28] all right do you know what a flirter is
[1:52:32] some do some don't all right some don't
[1:52:34] want to admit they know what it is
[1:52:36] all right I use this couple again just
[1:52:39] because I know that that they've been in
[1:52:41] the ministry so they won't be
[1:52:43] embarrassed
[1:52:44] sister
[1:52:46] um I forgot your first name
[1:52:48] Vicky sister Vicki Victoria no just
[1:52:51] Vicky all right sister Vicky I want to
[1:52:53] ask you a question
[1:52:55] all right don't be ashamed now is is
[1:52:57] brother Tony strong
[1:52:59] he is all right
[1:53:01] good for you man
[1:53:02] I got one more question for you
[1:53:05] is he handsome
[1:53:07] he is all right
[1:53:12] all right praise the Lord
[1:53:14] but now how would sister Vicki feel if
[1:53:17] some other sister came up and
[1:53:19] said to brother Tony brother Tony you're
[1:53:22] so strong
[1:53:24] and you're so handsome
[1:53:27] God bless you
[1:53:33] what would you think of that would that
[1:53:34] be all right
[1:53:36] now be honest
[1:53:38] wouldn't be all right would it
[1:53:40] you you it'd be okay okay all you
[1:53:43] sisters you got to go ahead
[1:53:46] no I wouldn't be all right would it no
[1:53:48] you wouldn't want some sister coming up
[1:53:50] and telling your husband how strong and
[1:53:51] how handsome he was why not that's a
[1:53:53] flirter yeah
[1:53:55] see it might be true but it's not their
[1:53:57] position
[1:54:00] you see they're not his wife
[1:54:02] she's his wife and she has the intimacy
[1:54:06] with him and so is it with denominations
[1:54:09] and churches that claim oh God is good
[1:54:12] that's true
[1:54:14] oh he's such a wonderful God yeah that's
[1:54:16] true
[1:54:17] oh his Bible is true yeah that's true
[1:54:19] but when the Mighty God come down in
[1:54:22] this generation and revealed himself
[1:54:25] making himself known then they look into
[1:54:29] the revealed word of the hour and say oh
[1:54:32] I don't like that kind of a god well
[1:54:34] that is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:54:37] well my Jesus lets me cut my hair but my
[1:54:40] the real Jesus doesn't do that
[1:54:43] you see she obeys him because she loves
[1:54:46] him I remember when I first got married
[1:54:49] uh that I told my wife she was a nail
[1:54:52] biter you know what a nail biter is they
[1:54:54] bite their nails back and all the time
[1:54:55] and they're nervous type of people I
[1:54:56] says you know what one thing I hate in
[1:54:58] life is a woman with bitten off nails
[1:55:01] and she's and she said
[1:55:03] okay
[1:55:04] and she quit biting her nails
[1:55:06] what gave her the power to do that
[1:55:11] what entered into her life that never
[1:55:13] entered her life before
[1:55:15] there was a love that entered her life
[1:55:18] and love gave her power where she never
[1:55:21] had power before
[1:55:25] amen When Love Comes into oh I could
[1:55:27] never live like that the message is too
[1:55:29] hard it's not you living it it's love
[1:55:32] that comes in that allows you to live
[1:55:35] the way he loves you
[1:55:38] and there's many that say oh Jesus is so
[1:55:41] wonderful oh he lets me do this he lets
[1:55:43] me live any old way that I want to you
[1:55:45] know he lets me he lets me drink he lets
[1:55:48] me smoke he lets me go to movies all
[1:55:50] those kinds you know what I drink as
[1:55:52] much as I want to too
[1:55:53] I smoke as much as I want to I didn't go
[1:55:56] to movies as much as I want to which is
[1:55:57] to say I don't do those things
[1:56:00] because when his life and nature came
[1:56:02] into me I lost the desire of those
[1:56:06] things
[1:56:08] I could never overcome them on my own I
[1:56:10] was hooked to those things but God's
[1:56:13] love separated me from those things why
[1:56:16] because I am his wife and there's many
[1:56:19] people that look into the message of the
[1:56:21] hour and they don't like it because they
[1:56:24] think it's too hard it's some people
[1:56:26] think it's legalistic it's not
[1:56:27] legalistic
[1:56:29] it's love
[1:56:31] and they think it's this they think it's
[1:56:33] that they think oh you know they're they
[1:56:35] recoil it the Revelation that God gave
[1:56:38] in this hour but there's a bride of
[1:56:39] Jesus Christ that when the word come by
[1:56:42] your way they say that's the Jesus I've
[1:56:45] always been looking for
[1:56:47] amen that's the one that I'm in love
[1:56:49] with As He makes himself known to her
[1:56:52] she loves him more and more every day
[1:56:59] amen
[1:57:01] sister Vicky can I ask you another
[1:57:02] question
[1:57:04] when do you love him more now or when
[1:57:06] you first knew him now
[1:57:10] why it's a growth of a marriage
[1:57:12] relationship
[1:57:16] you you can pay me when we went later
[1:57:22] I call a young couple out in church at
[1:57:24] home just recently and and I was
[1:57:26] preaching on some of these things and
[1:57:28] and I said I called this young couple
[1:57:30] out and and I asked him some questions
[1:57:33] just like that and and they were just
[1:57:35] young you know just just married last
[1:57:37] year and uh one of the deacons stopped
[1:57:39] me after the service he says you owe
[1:57:41] them a supper I said owe them a supper
[1:57:44] they owe me a supper
[1:57:46] I said that was free marriage counseling
[1:57:49] my goodness
[1:57:53] then come to find out the brother come
[1:57:54] up to me later he said brother Tim
[1:57:56] that's the last time I ever prayed
[1:57:58] before a service Lord make this service
[1:58:00] very personal to me
[1:58:09] praise the Lord
[1:58:10] God is good amen
[1:58:15] now the power of the blood of Jesus
[1:58:18] Christ has not diminished one iota in
[1:58:22] 2000 years
[1:58:24] and it is not physical I don't have a
[1:58:26] vial of the blood here tonight
[1:58:29] but the life that was in that blood is
[1:58:32] in this room
[1:58:36] the blessings available to the believer
[1:58:39] has not changed
[1:58:41] in 2000 years the value of one Soul has
[1:58:46] not changed in 2000 years
[1:58:49] the ability of the believer to receive
[1:58:53] the blessings of God has not changed in
[1:58:56] two thousand years
[1:58:58] God's attitude towards the believer has
[1:59:02] not changed in 2000 years
[1:59:05] all of these things remain constant and
[1:59:08] remain the same Jesus Christ the same
[1:59:10] yesterday today and forever you see a a
[1:59:14] church that neglects any part of this
[1:59:18] word has to by Nature say God has
[1:59:21] changed
[1:59:23] because they can't live the book
[1:59:27] but God has not changed in the same life
[1:59:29] that they saw in the book of Acts is the
[1:59:32] same life that's on the scene today
[1:59:35] matter of fact when I was a young man I
[1:59:37] was raised in a denominational church
[1:59:39] and uh I always run away even though I
[1:59:42] felt called to the ministry in the
[1:59:44] church my uh my uh my family has a long
[1:59:47] line of ministers dating back all the
[1:59:49] way to early days of Pentecost and and I
[1:59:52] felt kind of a pull towards the ministry
[1:59:54] but I run away from it because I knew
[1:59:56] that I didn't have what they had in the
[1:59:58] book of Acts I believed it I believe the
[2:00:03] Bible but I didn't have what was in the
[2:00:05] Bible I didn't have what they had so I
[2:00:07] always run away they always tried to put
[2:00:08] me and Slot me into different things and
[2:00:10] I always run away from it and finally
[2:00:12] God brought his word by my way and that
[2:00:15] changed my life you see it takes the
[2:00:17] revealed word of the hour to Quicken the
[2:00:20] elect of the hour
[2:00:22] and only the elect of the hour can be
[2:00:24] quickened and so as God quickened Me by
[2:00:28] his word then I used to walk to work
[2:00:30] every day and and uh listen to a message
[2:00:33] in the little town where I received the
[2:00:35] the message and I won't go into all the
[2:00:37] details of that but I would walk to work
[2:00:39] and and listen to a part of a tape and
[2:00:41] walk home and listen to a part of a tape
[2:00:43] after work and back and forth and and so
[2:00:46] one day I was walking to work and I just
[2:00:48] came up a side street and turned around
[2:00:50] I was working in a bank at that time and
[2:00:52] turned around to go down to the bank and
[2:00:54] and as I was walking down just a half a
[2:00:57] block from the bank God spoke to me
[2:00:58] while I was listening to that table
[2:01:01] and he said you said you would preach
[2:01:04] what I've given you the truth
[2:01:06] I've given you the truth
[2:01:11] and so I knew I could no longer run away
[2:01:14] from the call that God had given me
[2:01:18] you see God is in the business of doing
[2:01:21] things the same way he did it in the
[2:01:23] Bible
[2:01:25] his his attitude is the same he hasn't
[2:01:29] changed it must remain the same or he's
[2:01:32] not God
[2:01:33] he has one purpose that is redemption
[2:01:38] and that purpose of redemption has
[2:01:41] always been contained in that title deed
[2:01:45] God did not change the Plan of
[2:01:48] Redemption he did not have a plan B as
[2:01:51] we know even through Moses life and we
[2:01:53] can see how that Moses uh run away from
[2:01:56] the call of God because he tried to do
[2:01:58] it in his own pal run out in the desert
[2:01:59] but God didn't call somebody else
[2:02:02] he just molded Moses on the backside of
[2:02:04] the desert till he got him in condition
[2:02:06] that he could use him so it is with
[2:02:09] every son and daughter of God that God
[2:02:11] will bring you into the right position
[2:02:13] to receive the word and to manifest the
[2:02:17] word in his hour you see it's only the
[2:02:19] attitude of the believer that has
[2:02:21] changed down Through the Ages nothing
[2:02:23] else has changed God's plan isn't
[2:02:25] changed and God's revelation in these
[2:02:28] last days is to get our attitude back
[2:02:30] towards his word back on track the
[2:02:34] attitude of the sons of God well let me
[2:02:37] just say this brother random takes it
[2:02:39] specifically towards a mental attitude
[2:02:41] here and he says he says may I go on
[2:02:43] record now saying this that I believe
[2:02:45] that the right mental attitude towards
[2:02:48] any Divine promise will bring it to pass
[2:02:52] Jesus said the word is a seed that the
[2:02:55] man sowed he was the man that sowed it
[2:02:57] and the seed put in the proper
[2:02:59] conditions in a Heart full of Faith
[2:03:01] it'll make every promise live
[2:03:05] bring forth what is promised
[2:03:08] he says another place he says it's your
[2:03:10] personal property the very minute that
[2:03:12] you receive it that way then it has to
[2:03:14] come to pass
[2:03:15] all right now in brother brannon's
[2:03:17] Ministry
[2:03:20] the thing that he struggled with was the
[2:03:22] attitude of the people
[2:03:24] towards the healing that God wanted to
[2:03:27] give them
[2:03:28] see brother Branham Discerning the
[2:03:31] secrets that was in the people's hearts
[2:03:33] never healed them
[2:03:35] they were already healed at Calvary
[2:03:39] come on these are these are basic
[2:03:41] principles in the scripture he was
[2:03:43] wounded for our transgressions bruised
[2:03:45] for our iniquities the chastisement of
[2:03:47] our peace was upon him and with his
[2:03:49] stripes we were healed
[2:03:52] amen all healing was paid for and
[2:03:54] completed at Calvary but it's our
[2:03:57] attitude towards the promise that has to
[2:04:00] be changed and God's in the business of
[2:04:03] changing our attitudes and so there
[2:04:05] might be somebody that brother Brandon
[2:04:07] would have to call out see God just
[2:04:09] revealed whatever was necessary brother
[2:04:11] Branham being the vessel that God would
[2:04:13] reveal it to to change the person's
[2:04:15] attitude he might tell them something
[2:04:16] that they went through as a young person
[2:04:18] he would he would he often said you know
[2:04:20] if I need to know what's wrong with you
[2:04:22] he says I contact your spirit
[2:04:24] where is it whatever is wrong with you
[2:04:26] is in your spirit
[2:04:29] what's your spirit it's your mind
[2:04:32] the right mental attitude towards any
[2:04:35] Divine promise will bring it to pass so
[2:04:39] if a prophet of God could reveal where
[2:04:41] the problem is in a person's Spirit he
[2:04:44] could change the attitude
[2:04:47] changing the attitude would loose the
[2:04:49] power of God that's already there
[2:04:52] into their life and produce the healing
[2:04:55] that they were Desiring see it wasn't
[2:04:57] something that they needed to work
[2:04:59] themselves up into young people faith is
[2:05:01] not an emotional workup it's not
[2:05:03] something that you've got to build
[2:05:04] yourself up into faith comes by hearing
[2:05:07] the word as you receive the word of God
[2:05:09] it builds a substance within you and all
[2:05:12] it takes for the Holy Spirit to strike
[2:05:15] that substance will produce the promise
[2:05:19] see some tried to work themselves up
[2:05:21] into Faith by emotion that didn't work
[2:05:23] matter of fact emotion doesn't build
[2:05:26] faith it hinders faith
[2:05:28] one time brother Brian went to a place
[2:05:30] and I don't know why these are not in my
[2:05:32] notes I don't I'm going down this road
[2:05:33] I'm sure it's for somebody
[2:05:35] he went to a house one time and he comes
[2:05:38] into the house of girls in a real bad
[2:05:40] shape little girls very early I think
[2:05:41] it's in the message faith is the
[2:05:43] substance around the earlier messages
[2:05:44] and he says that the girl was in a very
[2:05:48] bad condition and the father he says he
[2:05:50] says was about to cry and he said to the
[2:05:53] father very straightly he says Don't Cry
[2:05:56] says it'll hurt your faith
[2:06:00] what is it what see it's not a human
[2:06:03] emotion is the result of something that
[2:06:05] God does
[2:06:08] human emotion does not attain unto God
[2:06:11] Esau sought a place of repentance with
[2:06:14] tears and found it not
[2:06:17] you see it takes a revelation within the
[2:06:21] heart to produce faith so many times
[2:06:24] people tried to work themselves up to
[2:06:25] you know Miracles don't produce faith
[2:06:29] Miracles actually hurt faith
[2:06:33] I'll explain that one to you it's all
[2:06:35] right
[2:06:37] you know Israel came through the
[2:06:39] Wilderness there wasn't anybody that saw
[2:06:40] more miracles in his room
[2:06:43] the ten plagues The Parting of the Red
[2:06:45] Sea they saw water they received water
[2:06:47] from the rock as I said yesterday they
[2:06:49] ate Manna From Heaven
[2:06:51] they they saw plagues strike they saw
[2:06:53] different things happen supernaturally
[2:06:55] in two years they saw so many miracles
[2:06:58] that they had no excuse but when it came
[2:07:01] time to enter in what was the problem
[2:07:02] the word was not mixed in their heart
[2:07:05] with faith
[2:07:07] it wasn't that they hadn't seen enough
[2:07:09] Miracles you see in the early part of
[2:07:11] brother branham's Ministry he believed
[2:07:13] that Miracle lines would help the
[2:07:15] people's faith and he was actually
[2:07:17] rebuked by the angel of the Lord and
[2:07:20] told don't have those Miracle lines
[2:07:22] because it'll come to pass that people
[2:07:25] won't believe unless they see a miracle
[2:07:28] now is that increasing Faith or is that
[2:07:31] decreasing faith
[2:07:33] no he was hurting the people's Faith by
[2:07:36] trying to produce Miracles night after
[2:07:38] night faith comes by
[2:07:42] hearing what the word of God that's the
[2:07:46] only way for you that faith is for God
[2:07:49] to drop his word into your heart
[2:07:56] right I think I better finish that
[2:07:57] subject
[2:07:58] I thought I would leave that till
[2:08:00] tomorrow
[2:08:02] a man come to Jesus one time come to the
[2:08:05] disciples
[2:08:06] oh I think we better read this take your
[2:08:07] Bibles and turn to Mark chapter nine are
[2:08:09] you still with me
[2:08:11] all right you're still pulling
[2:08:13] praise the Lord
[2:08:18] no
[2:08:20] I've done that to somebody
[2:08:24] Mark chapter 9 and verse 19.
[2:08:27] we find the the man that brought the the
[2:08:29] epileptic case to the disciples and they
[2:08:31] couldn't cure him
[2:08:33] and uh
[2:08:37] we'll pick it up at at verse 16 he says
[2:08:40] what he asked the scribes what ants
[2:08:42] questioning you with them and one of the
[2:08:43] multitude answered and said master I
[2:08:45] brought unto thee my son which has a
[2:08:47] dumb spirit and where's whoever he
[2:08:49] taketh them he teareth him and he
[2:08:50] formeth and gnashes Away with his teeth
[2:08:52] and pineth the way I speak to thy
[2:08:54] disciples that he would cast them out
[2:08:56] they would cast him out and they could
[2:08:58] not
[2:08:59] and he answered and said oh faithless
[2:09:01] generation how long shall I be with you
[2:09:03] and how long shall I suffer you bring
[2:09:06] him unto me
[2:09:08] and they brought him unto him and when
[2:09:10] he saw him straight away the spirit tear
[2:09:13] him and he fell on the ground and
[2:09:14] wallowed forming see the devil likes to
[2:09:16] create a distraction
[2:09:18] trying to try to distract the service
[2:09:20] distract from what uh because that's why
[2:09:22] people fall sick in the service because
[2:09:24] the devil's try to create a distraction
[2:09:26] I've had it happen you know children
[2:09:28] fall off chairs hit their heads on the
[2:09:30] floor whatever more everybody was like
[2:09:32] they've never seen a child fall before
[2:09:35] amen amen everybody feels sorry the
[2:09:39] devil knows how to do it Lord willing to
[2:09:41] speak on atmosphere tomorrow or maybe
[2:09:43] Monday it says and he asked his father
[2:09:46] and he said how long is it ago how long
[2:09:49] is it ago since this came on to him and
[2:09:51] he said of a child
[2:09:52] and often It cast him into the fire and
[2:09:54] into the waters to destroy him but if
[2:09:56] thou can't do anything have compassion
[2:09:57] on us and help us and Jesus said unto
[2:10:00] him if thou can'tst believe all things
[2:10:03] are possible to him that believeth
[2:10:06] it's a famous scripture that we quote
[2:10:08] and straightway the father of the child
[2:10:10] cried out and said with tears Lord I
[2:10:14] believe
[2:10:15] help thou my unbelief
[2:10:18] now this is a powerful scripture because
[2:10:20] it actually loses the secret of faith
[2:10:23] because here the man is it appears to be
[2:10:26] contradicting himself Lord I believe
[2:10:28] help thou my unbelief but in his anguish
[2:10:32] to see the power of God he was willing
[2:10:35] to admit something and that was that he
[2:10:38] didn't have enough faith
[2:10:40] because he's actually saying if you go
[2:10:42] back to the Greek he's saying Lord I
[2:10:45] believe help thou my lack of faith
[2:10:48] now Faith is not believing and believing
[2:10:51] is not faith
[2:10:53] you believe with the faith that you have
[2:10:56] but believing is what you do with the
[2:10:59] substance that you have faith is the
[2:11:03] substance of things hoped for the
[2:11:05] evidence of Things Not Seen but you
[2:11:08] believe with that Faith you in other
[2:11:11] words you focus that faith upon the
[2:11:13] promise of God it takes you to take the
[2:11:17] faith and do something with it you see
[2:11:19] the disciples even wondered why they
[2:11:21] couldn't do it and Jesus told them
[2:11:22] because of your and he uses the same
[2:11:24] word lack of faith it's not that you're
[2:11:27] not believing they believe for this and
[2:11:29] believed for that and they had enough
[2:11:30] Faith oh you say brother Tim is it
[2:11:32] really a lack of faith listen brother
[2:11:33] branham's wife sister Mita had a tumor
[2:11:35] and in her latter years a latter years
[2:11:38] of brother Brown's Ministry rather and
[2:11:40] uh it came up against it because of
[2:11:42] something that she had done wrong and
[2:11:44] the Lord didn't like it and so she the
[2:11:46] little cyst that she had on her ovary
[2:11:48] began to grow into a tumor and you know
[2:11:50] the story became very big and they come
[2:11:52] to the end of it all where brother
[2:11:55] Branham they were putting off the
[2:11:56] surgery putting it off putting it off
[2:11:58] and finally
[2:12:00] he said to he said to his wife he says
[2:12:03] dear
[2:12:04] I guess we don't have enough faith
[2:12:07] for this
[2:12:09] now can you imagine brother Brown was
[2:12:11] saying that
[2:12:12] see sometimes in life you come up
[2:12:14] against something and the problem is you
[2:12:16] don't have enough faith
[2:12:19] faith comes by hearing the word that's
[2:12:22] why it's so important to receive the
[2:12:25] word what God is doing with the
[2:12:27] revelation of the hour is building you
[2:12:30] up into the faith of a Son of God
[2:12:34] because it is the faith of the Son of
[2:12:37] God deposited into the heart of sons of
[2:12:41] God to reproduce that faith in a bride
[2:12:46] okay
[2:12:48] so faith
[2:12:50] is only a revelation
[2:12:53] that's why the Bible says when the son
[2:12:54] of man cometh will he find faith on the
[2:12:56] Earth
[2:12:58] and so the man that was
[2:13:01] that was crawling out here he was at
[2:13:04] being identified I don't have enough
[2:13:07] Faith Lord I'm believing but help thou
[2:13:10] my lack of faith maybe you're here
[2:13:12] tonight and I really don't know why I'm
[2:13:14] on this subject
[2:13:19] but really there's enough power within
[2:13:22] the believer
[2:13:24] to speak worlds into existence
[2:13:27] but what operates that power
[2:13:30] is faith
[2:13:32] and faith is a revelation that only God
[2:13:35] can give
[2:13:37] faith cannot be conjured up or done by
[2:13:42] you that is to say believing is not
[2:13:44] faith we are believers that's what we do
[2:13:47] we believe but faith is a finished work
[2:13:53] faith has muscles on it when Faith
[2:13:56] speaks the devil shuts up I'm just
[2:13:59] giving you little statements right out
[2:14:00] of the message of the hour Lord let
[2:14:03] there be a deposit of Revelation brother
[2:14:05] Brown says the importance of Revelation
[2:14:07] cannot be overestimated
[2:14:10] amen we've got to realize why God is
[2:14:14] bringing his Revelation into the church
[2:14:15] now as I said before this inheritance
[2:14:18] can only come to you by being born again
[2:14:22] but once you're born again then God
[2:14:25] takes and moves you to a realm
[2:14:28] that he supplies everything that you
[2:14:32] have need of through the title deed of
[2:14:34] The Inheritance that the lamb has
[2:14:37] redeemed
[2:14:39] now
[2:14:44] see you've got to have the Holy Ghost
[2:14:48] and the title deed
[2:14:52] a lot of people don't understand that
[2:14:55] it's because you can be in the message
[2:14:56] of the hour and actually understand that
[2:14:59] the title deed is back in the hands of
[2:15:00] the Bride but if you don't have the Holy
[2:15:02] Ghost the devil's just going to laugh at
[2:15:04] you
[2:15:06] and you can have the Holy Ghost which is
[2:15:08] what they had down through seven Church
[2:15:10] ages
[2:15:11] but without knowing what's on the title
[2:15:13] deed you don't know what's available to
[2:15:16] you through the power of the Holy Ghost
[2:15:18] that lays within you
[2:15:21] so it's not just the title deed and it's
[2:15:24] not just the Holy Ghost
[2:15:26] the Holy Ghost is the abstract to the
[2:15:29] title deed all right now you can put
[2:15:32] that slideshow up for me
[2:15:44] I want to explain to you for a moment
[2:15:46] about the abstract title deed and then
[2:15:48] maybe Lord willing will bring this to a
[2:15:50] close depends if you're still pulling or
[2:15:51] not
[2:15:52] yeah now
[2:15:56] is that me that's making that noise
[2:15:59] I do
[2:16:02] sorry
[2:16:04] turn on the pulpit mic all right
[2:16:07] stay at the pulpit is what he says
[2:16:09] all right quit wandering around all
[2:16:11] right
[2:16:13] you got me back for that
[2:16:15] so the abstract title deed I wanna you
[2:16:17] can put the first quote up there as we
[2:16:19] talk about
[2:16:20] what it what we're talking about here
[2:16:22] now it says in whom you also trusted
[2:16:24] Ephesians 1 and verse 13. after that you
[2:16:27] heard the word of Truth
[2:16:31] I'm going to read it off my notes Here
[2:16:33] the gospel of your salvation in whom
[2:16:36] also after that you believed you were
[2:16:39] sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise
[2:16:41] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[2:16:45] all right notice it's not our
[2:16:47] inheritance
[2:16:48] it's the earnest of our inheritance
[2:16:51] until the Redemption of the purchased
[2:16:55] possession
[2:16:56] oh my now just hang on a second
[2:16:58] Redemption what's God's Redemptive plan
[2:17:01] there's only one that could redeem and
[2:17:03] that's Christ until he redeemed the
[2:17:07] purchased possession that's Kinsmen
[2:17:09] Redeemer
[2:17:10] and so when the lamb as a Kinsmen
[2:17:12] Redeemer takes the book out of the hand
[2:17:15] that of him that's set upon the throne
[2:17:16] that's the inheritance that's the
[2:17:19] purchased possession all right so the
[2:17:21] church has had the Holy Ghost as an
[2:17:23] Earnest of The Inheritance until the
[2:17:26] time that the lamb steps forth and the
[2:17:29] time of the Redemption of the purchase
[2:17:31] possession unto the praise of his glory
[2:17:35] and so now what is brother Branham uses
[2:17:38] the term abstract and I want you as we
[2:17:40] go through this I want you to understand
[2:17:41] abstract is actually an American term I
[2:17:43] don't know if you have it here in New
[2:17:45] Zealand it's not something we use in
[2:17:46] Canada which is similarly based on a
[2:17:49] British system
[2:17:50] the abstract is a is a real estate term
[2:17:53] and it's related to a title deed but
[2:17:56] it's not the title deed and his brother
[2:17:58] Branham explained it what you would do
[2:18:00] if you're buying a piece of land it has
[2:18:02] a title but you would have to go and
[2:18:05] obtain an abstract and what the abstract
[2:18:08] does is searches the title all the way
[2:18:11] back to when the title was established
[2:18:14] and make sure that there are no prior
[2:18:17] claims all right so you can have the
[2:18:19] title deed but if you don't have an
[2:18:22] abstract to show with the title deed you
[2:18:24] cannot enforce the title deed somebody
[2:18:27] might say I have a claim on that but
[2:18:29] when you have an abstract with the title
[2:18:31] deed you could present it to the judge
[2:18:34] and say I have a right to this title
[2:18:37] because the abstract says there are no
[2:18:39] prior claims to this title that I
[2:18:42] possess all right so now give me the the
[2:18:45] first quote please
[2:18:46] now brother Brown I'm talking about the
[2:18:48] day of Pentecost he says now here was
[2:18:50] men fishermen Tax Collectors humble
[2:18:52] Little Women just ordinary Housewives
[2:18:54] little virgin girls they were believers
[2:18:57] they were believing that this was the
[2:19:00] truth
[2:19:00] they believe that when Jesus died they
[2:19:03] believed on him and Rose up again from
[2:19:05] the dead they believed that to be
[2:19:08] absolutely the testimony of God and that
[2:19:11] he had quickened him God had quickened
[2:19:13] him Christ to life
[2:19:16] now they go up to the day of Pentecost
[2:19:19] to receive their abstract
[2:19:22] you know what an abstract is it's when
[2:19:25] the deed has been cleared
[2:19:28] next page
[2:19:30] he says God gave Abraham a promise
[2:19:32] Abraham believed God and it was imputed
[2:19:34] unto him for righteousness but he sealed
[2:19:37] the Covenant by the Seal of circumcision
[2:19:39] and God gives you a promise potentially
[2:19:42] that you will receive it and you're
[2:19:44] going to be raised up and this body is
[2:19:46] going to be glorified with them at the
[2:19:48] end time but you see you have to get a
[2:19:51] clearance on that deed and the clearance
[2:19:54] was when everything against it has been
[2:19:56] stripped off and you've got the abstract
[2:19:59] to it you've got the seal it's yours
[2:20:02] everything on it belongs to you just
[2:20:06] hold that there for a moment and so
[2:20:07] brother Brandon these two quotes are
[2:20:09] speaking about the baptism of the Holy
[2:20:11] Ghost that the believer has to get the
[2:20:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost because you
[2:20:15] can get a deed but you've got to get the
[2:20:16] clearance to the deed but when you've
[2:20:19] got the clearance you've got the seal
[2:20:21] it's yours everything on the title deed
[2:20:24] belongs to you that's what they went for
[2:20:26] at the day of Pentecost God sent down
[2:20:28] the abstract they walked out of the
[2:20:30] upper room with the abstract everything
[2:20:32] on the title deed belonged to them there
[2:20:34] was only one problem the title deed had
[2:20:36] not been redeemed yet
[2:20:39] dude partially they had received a
[2:20:42] revelation in their age you say oh
[2:20:44] brother Jim if the book isn't redeemed
[2:20:46] how could they have a revelation of
[2:20:47] anything that was on the book well when
[2:20:49] Elijah was in the cave and complaining I
[2:20:51] alone am laughed the prophet of God said
[2:20:54] God pulled back the cover of the seals a
[2:20:57] little bit and let him see there was
[2:20:59] still seven thousand that had not bowed
[2:21:01] their knee to bail
[2:21:03] what was it the names written on the
[2:21:05] book
[2:21:06] you say and so is it in every age the
[2:21:09] partial Revelation is the names that are
[2:21:12] written on the book until the last days
[2:21:14] when God finishes all the mystery and
[2:21:17] brings the full inheritance into effect
[2:21:20] all right let's just continue to look at
[2:21:22] this give me the next one message rising
[2:21:24] of the Sun
[2:21:26] he says like the Pentecostal experience
[2:21:28] today and the coming of the Holy Ghost
[2:21:29] in This last days was promised is like
[2:21:32] the abstract to a title deed he says now
[2:21:35] you can get a title sure you can get a
[2:21:38] title to a place but that don't say it's
[2:21:39] yours no sir somebody way back Yonder
[2:21:42] should come in and put a claim on it but
[2:21:44] when you get an abstract that shows that
[2:21:46] everything that's ever against it is
[2:21:50] struck off plumbed back from the
[2:21:52] foundation
[2:21:54] and he says is that right I'm telling
[2:21:55] you that's American law and when Amanda
[2:21:58] said he believes the word
[2:21:59] and then when the Holy Spirit comes it
[2:22:03] is the abstract to the title and that
[2:22:07] gives you permission when you have the
[2:22:09] abstract that every bit of that belongs
[2:22:14] to you and everything that's on it
[2:22:17] belongs to you all right now it's not a
[2:22:21] signification that you believe what's on
[2:22:24] it you believe even before you get the
[2:22:27] abstract but what happens when you get
[2:22:29] the abstract it proves ownership
[2:22:33] it proves that it belongs to you that's
[2:22:37] why the woman at the at the
[2:22:39] seraphenician woman that come to Jesus
[2:22:40] she had a revelation or how God had to
[2:22:44] pour Revelation into this woman listen
[2:22:45] it had to come by faith because she's
[2:22:47] come to Jesus and she says you know oh
[2:22:50] son of David have mercy on me my
[2:22:52] daughters previously mixed with the
[2:22:53] devil won't you please deliver her and
[2:22:55] and and Jesus doesn't even say anything
[2:22:59] because she had no claims on him as that
[2:23:01] and so then she says oh son of David
[2:23:03] have mercy on me and he says it's not me
[2:23:06] to take the children's bread
[2:23:08] and cast it to dogs
[2:23:10] is that the statement
[2:23:12] all right now what he's saying is this
[2:23:14] belongs to the children
[2:23:16] why are you trying to lay claim on it
[2:23:20] but God drops a revelation into our
[2:23:22] heart and she says truth Lord now she
[2:23:25] changes her approach it's not son of
[2:23:27] David now it's Lord
[2:23:28] and she says but even the dogs eat the
[2:23:31] crumbs from the master's table now
[2:23:34] here's a couple of Revelations that God
[2:23:36] drops in on our heart and this is more
[2:23:37] Supernatural than sometimes we even
[2:23:39] realize how that God pours into her
[2:23:41] number one don't be offended that you're
[2:23:43] called a dog
[2:23:45] come on
[2:23:46] she doesn't run away and say I'm not
[2:23:48] wearing no she knew she needed what she
[2:23:50] needed this man had
[2:23:52] sometimes we have to realize we you know
[2:23:54] we're in such an instant age we want God
[2:23:56] to give it to us instantly well you know
[2:23:58] we're so used to I hate to say it I
[2:24:01] don't mean to pick on young people but
[2:24:02] maybe I'll just look like this so I
[2:24:04] don't know look at the young people I
[2:24:06] got eight children myself I still got
[2:24:07] two children at home and you know that
[2:24:09] they're glued to these things
[2:24:11] right everything's got to happen
[2:24:13] instantly they they want to text and get
[2:24:15] a text right back and and all of this
[2:24:17] everything's instant instant
[2:24:18] communication is that right
[2:24:20] somebody give me an amen
[2:24:22] you don't have a phone you don't have a
[2:24:25] phone God bless you
[2:24:28] my daughter was just like you
[2:24:32] my daughter was just like you growing up
[2:24:33] she says Dad everybody in their dog has
[2:24:35] a phone I said well if you need a phone
[2:24:37] borrow the dog's phone
[2:24:41] so here is the Sierra Phoenician woman
[2:24:43] and and God struck her heart excuse me
[2:24:46] for saying that but and so she she's
[2:24:48] catching a revelation now and catch what
[2:24:51] the woman is actually catching because
[2:24:53] in the if you look back in the
[2:24:55] underlying Greek words the the word Lord
[2:24:58] and Master is the same word
[2:25:00] and so she's actually saying truth
[2:25:02] master
[2:25:04] but even the dogs eat the crumbs from
[2:25:07] their master's table
[2:25:09] what she's saying is I may be a dog but
[2:25:13] I'm your dog
[2:25:16] Hallelujah
[2:25:18] tell you what she caught a revelation I
[2:25:20] may be a doormat Lord but on your
[2:25:22] doormat
[2:25:23] I may be a nobody Lord but I'm your
[2:25:25] nobody
[2:25:27] amen as our brother said this morning I
[2:25:29] might just be the one at the back of the
[2:25:30] orchestra with a little triangle but
[2:25:32] Lord I'm in your Orchestra
[2:25:36] you're my conductor
[2:25:37] and whatever you say I know that the
[2:25:40] devil has to listen to you praise the
[2:25:42] Lord that woman caught a revelation and
[2:25:44] Jesus says I have not found so great of
[2:25:46] faith
[2:25:48] in all of Israel she had a revelation of
[2:25:51] who she was and she laid claim on her
[2:25:55] part and Jesus couldn't help but heal
[2:25:57] her her daughter was healed from that
[2:25:59] very hour
[2:26:02] Hallelujah why Faith to walk in the
[2:26:05] light that God gave her
[2:26:07] Glory
[2:26:09] say what brother Tim God's only were
[2:26:11] just revealed to me that I've been saved
[2:26:13] and walk in that life
[2:26:15] God's only revealed to me that you know
[2:26:17] I've just been baptized in the name of
[2:26:19] the Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord
[2:26:20] walk in that light
[2:26:22] please revealed to me just a little bit
[2:26:23] well walk in that light well you see
[2:26:25] you're not going to see the whole
[2:26:26] Revelation all at once you just walk in
[2:26:29] the light that he gives you
[2:26:31] and then you become like this woman
[2:26:33] whose record is recorded in the Bible
[2:26:35] for our benefits amen just like the
[2:26:39] little woman with too much she said all
[2:26:40] I got is these two mites but I'm going
[2:26:42] to give God everything I have and Jesus
[2:26:45] stood there he never stopped her he
[2:26:46] allowed her to give it and he said she's
[2:26:48] given more than everybody else
[2:26:51] now I know why the Lord spoke to me the
[2:26:53] other day and share this testimony with
[2:26:55] you
[2:26:55] now now I've come to it I used to think
[2:26:58] about
[2:26:59] well everybody thinks about the lottery
[2:27:02] ever thought about the lottery
[2:27:04] hey you're honest God bless you
[2:27:06] we've all thought about the lottery what
[2:27:08] would it be like if I won a million
[2:27:10] dollars they had just one in the United
[2:27:11] States a billion and a half dollars
[2:27:14] it's just
[2:27:15] I you can't even think in those numbers
[2:27:17] I can't anyway I didn't buy a ticket by
[2:27:20] the way and uh and I've never bought
[2:27:22] lottery tickets since I've been saved
[2:27:23] matter of fact why I had one given to me
[2:27:25] and I gave it to somebody else what
[2:27:26] would people think if a preacher won a
[2:27:28] lottery you know
[2:27:30] and so
[2:27:33] and it wasn't a winning ticket anyway so
[2:27:36] uh
[2:27:38] I was driving by on the way to our camp
[2:27:40] last a couple summers ago where it was a
[2:27:43] youth camp and I was going to speak be
[2:27:44] speaking to the youth in the morning
[2:27:45] about missions and and things and and so
[2:27:48] I
[2:27:49] as I uh was on the way to Camp you know
[2:27:52] I I pulled in for some gas at the gas
[2:27:54] station saw the sign on the window
[2:27:56] lottery so many millions of dollars and
[2:27:58] I don't remember what it was and I
[2:28:00] thought Lord
[2:28:01] you know the numbers
[2:28:03] to that Lottery
[2:28:04] what numbers would win
[2:28:07] how come you never tell nobody what
[2:28:09] those numbers are
[2:28:11] yeah if you I didn't say if you told me
[2:28:13] I'd give it all but I said you know if
[2:28:15] you told somebody that you could trust
[2:28:17] they win the lottery and give it all
[2:28:19] back to you
[2:28:20] and I thought about that you know when
[2:28:22] I'm thinking about it on the way to camp
[2:28:23] and I'm I'm pondering over it
[2:28:26] and then all of a sudden
[2:28:27] something speaks down in my heart and
[2:28:29] says remember brother so and so
[2:28:32] and there's this brother that is is
[2:28:35] actually he was in an automobile
[2:28:36] accident and he's got physical injuries
[2:28:39] because of it he's not in very good
[2:28:41] physical shape but he goes out and
[2:28:43] collects tin cans and bottled cans and
[2:28:46] bottled uh or pop bottles and pop cans
[2:28:49] and that kind of stuff and cashes them
[2:28:51] in for money and gives the money to
[2:28:53] missions
[2:28:54] and he sends me letters and I write him
[2:28:56] back and he might only send five dollars
[2:28:58] or ten dollars and I write him back
[2:29:00] every time he sends a few dollars and uh
[2:29:03] sends me a letter tells me how he's
[2:29:04] doing and his name's Jeff
[2:29:07] he sent me his testimony and how God
[2:29:08] dealt with him and he was actually on
[2:29:10] the radio and because of it and and so
[2:29:13] he just a very positive man and the Lord
[2:29:15] spoke to me says if I
[2:29:18] allowed somebody to give that amount of
[2:29:21] money
[2:29:22] he says then brother Jeff would not give
[2:29:25] his offerings because he would think he
[2:29:28] wouldn't need to
[2:29:29] and then and then where would be his
[2:29:34] reward
[2:29:38] that's why God operates the way he does
[2:29:42] that's why he said about the Widow with
[2:29:44] two mites she has given more than all
[2:29:48] the others
[2:29:49] because they out of their abundance have
[2:29:52] given but she out of her poverty has
[2:29:55] given all that she has don't ever forget
[2:29:59] that when you're giving to the Lord
[2:30:02] there you go all you pastors that's for
[2:30:04] free
[2:30:08] amen
[2:30:10] so he says all my sins are struck out
[2:30:13] all your sins are struck out by the
[2:30:15] blood of Jesus Christ we're still
[2:30:16] speaking about the abstract and the Holy
[2:30:19] Ghost is come as an abstract to the
[2:30:22] title deed that God give me by grace
[2:30:27] by foreknowledge
[2:30:29] the title deed is the inheritance we
[2:30:32] didn't do anything to deserve it it was
[2:30:34] in God's mind before the foundation of
[2:30:36] the world but now he's given us the
[2:30:38] abstract to it next one please
[2:30:41] say I bought a piece of ground I want to
[2:30:43] Anchor this in your hearts I bought a
[2:30:45] piece of ground it isn't yours until you
[2:30:46] got an abstract but if you got an
[2:30:48] abstract
[2:30:49] it shows that everything that ever was
[2:30:52] against that piece of ground has been
[2:30:53] stricken off and then when you become a
[2:30:56] Christian and accept Christ as your
[2:30:59] savior then when God sends down the
[2:31:02] abstract listen to this now it shows
[2:31:05] that no matter what your father did
[2:31:08] your mother did what anybody else did
[2:31:11] your mother Daddy might have been
[2:31:14] drunkards prostitutes
[2:31:19] I guess that does away with illegitimate
[2:31:21] birth doesn't it
[2:31:23] whatever it was every sin is stricken
[2:31:26] off
[2:31:27] you've got an abstract title there's
[2:31:31] nothing can put you off of it
[2:31:34] and look everything that's on that
[2:31:37] ground belongs to you and when you're in
[2:31:41] Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:31:44] every gift of God belongs in the church
[2:31:48] it's an abstract title deed it's yours
[2:31:51] it belongs to you
[2:31:54] and then he says it quickens your mortal
[2:31:56] body all my if we think of it all right
[2:32:00] so that's the abstract it shows up
[2:32:02] there's nothing against you all the way
[2:32:03] back whatever you ever did wrong you got
[2:32:06] the Holy Ghost it's all been stricken
[2:32:08] off there's there's
[2:32:10] the grace of God I was wondering where I
[2:32:12] was going to put this in
[2:32:13] all right
[2:32:15] the grace of God
[2:32:17] I'm gonna flip this now I told you I was
[2:32:19] going to follow the lord tonight
[2:32:21] I'm gonna stop in the middle of that
[2:32:23] slideshow and I'm going to open another
[2:32:25] one
[2:32:26] called expectancy
[2:32:28] I was waiting to know where where I was
[2:32:30] going to drop this in
[2:32:31] but I want to introduce you to two men
[2:32:34] and the grace of God
[2:32:37] and maybe maybe this will help you are
[2:32:39] you still with me
[2:32:40] get a little quieter we'll close as soon
[2:32:43] as we can
[2:32:45] hey man you recognize this man
[2:32:46] on the right that's brother Biscoe but I
[2:32:49] want to introduce to this man on the
[2:32:51] left is uh Brother Thompson
[2:32:54] Alfred Thompson
[2:32:56] Brother Thompson uh uh
[2:33:01] he uh I'm gonna have to read it off the
[2:33:03] screen because I don't have it in front
[2:33:04] of me because I didn't think I was going
[2:33:05] there tonight
[2:33:06] but
[2:33:08] he came to us while we were in Tennessee
[2:33:11] just this last November
[2:33:13] and he told Brother bisco I want to
[2:33:15] share my testimony with you
[2:33:16] brother Alfred Thompson said I was in I
[2:33:19] was in brother branham's meetings

[2:33:43] and I told my friend this is what he's
[2:33:44] telling us in the room here he says I
[2:33:46] told my friend I'm not coming I'm not
[2:33:48] interested the friend kept persisting he
[2:33:51] says I'm not interested he says I I
[2:33:53] because I think that I've sinned away my
[2:33:56] day of Grace
[2:33:57] I've gone too far
[2:33:59] and I I I I God's not interested in me
[2:34:02] so don't even ask me again and as the
[2:34:05] meeting came close the Holy Spirit moved
[2:34:07] on him he just said something moved on
[2:34:09] me and and he he says he decided at the
[2:34:12] last minute to go into the meeting
[2:34:14] give me the next page please
[2:34:20] now here's the actual this instance it's
[2:34:22] recorded 1953 November
[2:34:25] yes November the 8th which was exactly
[2:34:28] the day that he told us the testimony
[2:34:29] November the 8th so it was exactly what
[2:34:33] is that 62 years later
[2:34:36] all right he says how brother Brown says
[2:34:38] how to do sir there's something strange
[2:34:39] about you sir Satan has desire to take
[2:34:42] your life
[2:34:44] you're all Torah you think you've sinned
[2:34:47] away your day of Grace
[2:34:48] you think your life is ruined
[2:34:51] do you love Jesus
[2:34:54] what makes you love him
[2:34:56] man obviously said yes
[2:34:58] before there could be anything to their
[2:35:01] make you love him there has to be a
[2:35:04] Creator to create the love in your heart
[2:35:07] is that right if you'd send away your
[2:35:10] day of Grace you would hate Jesus
[2:35:13] but you love him
[2:35:16] and you're all right
[2:35:18] and the devil's just lying to you
[2:35:20] brother random doesn't know him he's
[2:35:22] telling us the story he said he said
[2:35:24] matter of fact he stood in the room and
[2:35:25] he said I was about to do this
[2:35:28] that was his description he was about to
[2:35:30] commit suicide
[2:35:32] he says and the devil's just lying to
[2:35:35] you you're nervous come here and I'll
[2:35:37] cast him away for you if you'll believe
[2:35:40] do you believe it
[2:35:43] he says bow your head and keep your
[2:35:44] heads bowed everyone till you hear me
[2:35:46] say raise up this is demonology
[2:35:48] almighty God be merciful to the boy he
[2:35:51] stands here and Satan's trying to get
[2:35:52] him to get in this condition to commit
[2:35:54] suicide
[2:35:56] but Thou Art here to relieve the boy and
[2:35:58] to make the evil spirit go how did
[2:36:01] Brother Branham know he was going to
[2:36:02] commit suicide
[2:36:03] what was it God came by his way
[2:36:07] to make the evil spirit go thou has said
[2:36:09] these signs shall follow them that
[2:36:10] believe in my name they'll cast out
[2:36:12] Devils then upon the authority of God's
[2:36:15] word as a Believer I now ask the spirit
[2:36:17] that's on the void of unbelief to leave
[2:36:19] him go out in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:36:22] bother him no more and I set him free
[2:36:25] and may the enemy be bound and leave
[2:36:27] this room and torment no one else in
[2:36:31] Jesus Christ's name amen

[2:36:37] now you can raise your head feel all
[2:36:39] right now son is that right
[2:36:42] devils
[2:36:43] you'd have committed suicide in a few
[2:36:45] days that was on his mind
[2:36:47] he thought he'd send away his day of
[2:36:49] Grace
[2:36:50] and when he come up a real black heavy
[2:36:53] like fog meeting me in the face that's
[2:36:55] devils

[2:37:14] it doesn't matter what the devil's
[2:37:16] trying to tell you was just a boy 22
[2:37:18] years old he was 85 in the room 63 years
[2:37:22] later
[2:37:23] 62 years later 84. he was just a young
[2:37:26] man but he had thought he'd gone too far
[2:37:29] God's not interested but he asked him
[2:37:30] one question he said do you love Jesus
[2:37:33] I talked to a young person the other day
[2:37:35] and I just said
[2:37:36] you know person that had thought you
[2:37:38] know there's no hope for me I said do
[2:37:39] you love the Lord yeah
[2:37:41] do you love his word
[2:37:43] she said yes I said you see you're a
[2:37:46] daughter of God
[2:37:47] you see you wouldn't say that if you
[2:37:49] weren't a daughter of God there's
[2:37:51] something in you that you love the word
[2:37:53] because the word loves you
[2:37:56] amen see it's never never too late and
[2:37:59] it's never too far I want to show you
[2:38:01] one that's even worse here I've never
[2:38:02] met the second one but it's quite a
[2:38:04] testimony
[2:38:06] brother Brown's in a prayer line
[2:38:09] and he says yes sir brother you have
[2:38:11] trouble with arthritis is that what it's
[2:38:14] what is what bothers you isn't that

[2:38:27] Sorrow lots of trouble you're in trouble
[2:38:29] right now isn't that right brother isn't
[2:38:31] that right yeah at one time you wouldn't
[2:38:34] have come in this prayer line
[2:38:36] you as an unbeliever once
[2:38:38] very much critical of religion isn't
[2:38:41] that right
[2:38:42] you've done a great thing along that
[2:38:45] time too something that hurt you
[2:38:48] I believe you rebuked God or cursed with
[2:38:51] God or something
[2:38:53] or done something wrong or didn't you
[2:38:56] how would you think brother by the
[2:38:58] spirit of God is that a tract concerning
[2:39:01] it now hold it right there just for a
[2:39:03] moment I just want to gather your
[2:39:04] thoughts here around this here's a man
[2:39:06] comes in a prayer line
[2:39:08] and brother Brandon begins to discern
[2:39:10] this man has cursed God
[2:39:13] this man has got trouble because of it
[2:39:16] and he's suffering because of Any
[2:39:18] suffering the effects he's paying the
[2:39:21] price for what he did sometime
[2:39:23] previously now most of us as ministers
[2:39:26] would say we're not touching this one
[2:39:29] they're saying that's between you and
[2:39:31] God
[2:39:32] really you know what what I can't help
[2:39:34] you you curse God that's between you and
[2:39:36] him but notice how God's Prophet take
[2:39:39] picks it up here give you the next one
[2:39:41] he says now concerning that it harmed
[2:39:43] you now being that you had that on
[2:39:46] tracks then look this away
[2:39:48] believe with all your heart
[2:39:51] he says you paid dearly for that brother
[2:39:53] you have lots of troubles now nervous
[2:39:56] you have a lot of Home troubles don't
[2:39:58] you
[2:39:59] domestic troubles with your own home is
[2:40:01] that right will you believe me as God's
[2:40:04] servant it's all right for me to speak
[2:40:07] what the Lord says now he's asking him a
[2:40:09] question and the man's got to say yes
[2:40:11] because if he doesn't say yes brother
[2:40:12] random will not make the next statement
[2:40:16] you've had other troubles too don't you
[2:40:19] sexual troubles
[2:40:21] is that right sexual troubles that's the
[2:40:24] only place in the message you'll hear
[2:40:25] brother call brother brother Bradham
[2:40:27] call somebody out with that
[2:40:29] is this man
[2:40:30] that's just my opinion but I think God
[2:40:33] allowed that to make the man suffer a
[2:40:36] little bit because of he had cursed God
[2:40:39] all right but watch what God's going to
[2:40:41] do for him here is that right sexual
[2:40:43] troubles you listen what I mean nobody
[2:40:45] but God Alone knows that better than you
[2:40:48] is that right you believe me with all
[2:40:50] your heart brother let me have your hand
[2:40:53] says let's bow our heads our heavenly
[2:40:56] father there's nothing but what you know
[2:40:59] all about it
[2:41:00] I'm so thankful that you're here tonight
[2:41:03] blessing this poor old brother
[2:41:06] now obviously this man is old suffered
[2:41:09] from what he did when he was young
[2:41:12] having run and slip away to get to the
[2:41:14] service
[2:41:15] so he snuck from where he was into the
[2:41:18] service because he's actually a skeptic
[2:41:20] he's actually published a tract as
[2:41:22] you'll see in a moment that says I curse
[2:41:24] God he says is there a god I cursed him
[2:41:27] is it was the title of the track he says
[2:41:30] Granite Lord he's in trouble
[2:41:32] or he says let me go back this poor old
[2:41:35] brother having run and slip away to get
[2:41:36] to the service but loves you in his
[2:41:39] heart
[2:41:40] after all this
[2:41:43] God reveals to his Prophet this man
[2:41:45] loves God
[2:41:47] he says
[2:41:49] God make a way for him
[2:41:51] granted Lord he's in trouble
[2:41:53] he said that you said that you would be
[2:41:56] near those that are in need God bless my
[2:41:58] brother now as I bless him in thy name
[2:42:01] may all these troubles clear up like a
[2:42:04] cloud leaving from before the sun and
[2:42:07] may he be healed tonight of his
[2:42:09] arthritis and all these other troubles
[2:42:12] Lord listen Saints if God will heal a
[2:42:14] man like this of arthritis don't you
[2:42:16] think God will heal you of arthritis
[2:42:19] Hallelujah if you've got the abstract to
[2:42:22] the title deed don't you think God wants
[2:42:25] to give you what's rightfully yours
[2:42:28] here's this man that did all that he did
[2:42:30] he says Lord and me made a whole new and
[2:42:33] hold tonight in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:42:34] the son of God I ask it amen it's
[2:42:37] another part he says look here brother
[2:42:39] let me see you you feel that you're
[2:42:41] healed don't you you are healed my
[2:42:43] brother
[2:42:44] God bless you and go on your way
[2:42:45] rejoicing and all your troubles are
[2:42:48] going to clear up now and be all right
[2:42:51] God bless you amen that's the end of it
[2:42:55] you can go read those for yourself
[2:42:57] here's a man both of them probably
[2:43:00] thought they went too far
[2:43:03] but God come by their way you can go
[2:43:05] back to that other slideshow please
[2:43:08] God come by their way why because
[2:43:11] there's something written on a Lamb's
[2:43:13] Book of Life that is Unstoppable
[2:43:16] there's a title deed that belongs to the
[2:43:19] Bride of Jesus Christ I don't know
[2:43:21] whether these fellows are in the bride
[2:43:23] but I know that God has an elect that
[2:43:26] have more rights than we might even say
[2:43:28] these men had a right to expect in their
[2:43:31] day but God came by their way and God
[2:43:35] will come by your way
[2:43:37] I want to spend just a few moments on
[2:43:39] these now
[2:43:46] what is the title deed
[2:43:49] Father Brown says it's Redemption means
[2:43:51] all legal possession to all that was
[2:43:53] lost by Adam and Eve
[2:43:55] oh my oh what are that to do to a
[2:43:58] born-again Christian
[2:44:00] it's legal possession to the abstract
[2:44:03] deed title deed of eternal life means
[2:44:07] that you possess everything that Adam
[2:44:10] and Eve lost
[2:44:13] next one
[2:44:14] now watch the title deed of redemption
[2:44:16] of all creation is in his hand and he's
[2:44:18] come to claim it back for the human race
[2:44:20] not claim it back to Angels claim it
[2:44:23] back to the human race which it was
[2:44:25] given for to make Sons and Daughters of
[2:44:27] God again
[2:44:28] bring them back to a Garden of Eden now
[2:44:31] there's where we started at the
[2:44:32] beginning what is the Redemptive purpose
[2:44:34] of God all that was in God he poured
[2:44:36] into Christ all that was in Christ he
[2:44:38] poured into the church that in the last
[2:44:40] days he would unite the church in Christ
[2:44:43] in a marriage Union and they would walk
[2:44:45] out like Adam and Eve into another
[2:44:47] Garden of Eden amen bring them back to a
[2:44:51] Garden of Eden everything they lost the
[2:44:53] whole creation the trees the animal life
[2:44:55] everything else
[2:44:57] now we're getting over into a book of
[2:44:59] Ephesians
[2:45:00] now the same way he's positionally
[2:45:03] placing the church here's the quote that
[2:45:05] I read already where they belong now
[2:45:08] Joshua placed them in the natural land
[2:45:10] now the holy spirit is placing the
[2:45:12] church positionally in the position
[2:45:14] where they belong there inheritance amen
[2:45:21] that's what the title deed is it's a
[2:45:24] it's the revelation of all that always
[2:45:27] belonged to you
[2:45:29] tomorrow I want to deal with sons and
[2:45:31] daughters of God specifically and what
[2:45:33] that means but now let me just
[2:45:36] wrap this up here with just a few
[2:45:38] thoughts
[2:45:41] did you know that what God actually came
[2:45:43] down to do by his message in this hour
[2:45:47] is to change our attitude
[2:45:50] towards what he's done for us
[2:45:53] it's a change of attitude that really
[2:45:56] needs to take place in the body of Jesus
[2:45:58] Christ
[2:45:59] brother Branham makes a statement in
[2:46:00] this in the seven trumpets of the Feast
[2:46:02] of the trumpets he says he says the
[2:46:04] seventh trumpet is to Israel what the
[2:46:06] seventh seal is to the bride and that's
[2:46:09] a key Revelation because if we
[2:46:11] understand that you're still with me
[2:46:13] all right I'll try and wrap this up in
[2:46:14] the next 10 minutes here so just stay
[2:46:16] with me I'll say like one brother
[2:46:18] actually the brother is preaching at our
[2:46:20] camp right now in Cloverdale he says I'm
[2:46:22] about to close
[2:46:25] you know what that means it doesn't mean
[2:46:27] I'm closing yeah
[2:46:30] I'm about to do that though
[2:46:33] all right I just said that to lighten it
[2:46:35] up to make sure everybody was awake
[2:46:37] all right so now here the seventh
[2:46:40] trumpet is to the Jews what the seventh
[2:46:42] seal is to the Gentiles
[2:46:44] and if we know what the seventh trumpet
[2:46:46] means the Feast of the trumpets is the
[2:46:49] calling of Israel to the day of
[2:46:51] atonement
[2:46:52] all right the day of atonement is when
[2:46:54] the sacrifice is made for all the sins
[2:46:57] of the nation in the Old Testament and
[2:46:59] it was done annually but there was a
[2:47:01] greater sacrifice that came the Lamb of
[2:47:04] God to take away the sin of the world
[2:47:06] one sacrifice for all that's why you
[2:47:09] know if if there's somebody here
[2:47:11] struggling I would simply ask you do you
[2:47:14] accept what Jesus has done for you
[2:47:18] it's not what you have done it's what
[2:47:20] he's already done for you
[2:47:22] and so Jesus Paid the price but the Jews
[2:47:25] didn't recognize it but the Feast of
[2:47:28] atonement in the Old Testament is only a
[2:47:31] type of the day of atonement in the
[2:47:33] tribulation time that Israel is called
[2:47:35] to by the seventh trumpet and so the
[2:47:38] seventh trumpet calls them to the day of
[2:47:40] atonement but it's not a new atonement
[2:47:42] they don't receive another sacrifice
[2:47:44] rather it brings their attention to the
[2:47:47] fact that the sacrifice is already paid
[2:47:50] you see they've been living for two
[2:47:52] thousand years since the day of the
[2:47:54] Gentiles started and the day of of God
[2:47:56] dealing with the Jews ended until the
[2:47:58] tribulation time they've been living
[2:48:00] under an attitude that they're looking
[2:48:02] forward to the Messiah they're looking
[2:48:04] forward to what God's going to do
[2:48:06] missing what he's already done for them
[2:48:09] back there but under the ministry of
[2:48:11] Moses and Elijah in the tribulation time
[2:48:13] God will actually change their attitude
[2:48:18] he will change their attitude because
[2:48:20] it's they won't give him a new atonement
[2:48:22] but he will show them it's already done
[2:48:24] for them and they will receive this same
[2:48:27] gospel that you and I have received so
[2:48:30] if the seventh trumpet is a change of
[2:48:31] attitude the seventh seal is also a
[2:48:34] change of attitude
[2:48:36] by the opening of the seals God comes
[2:48:40] down and reveals you always were us of
[2:48:44] God you always were a daughter of God
[2:48:48] and he brings the title deed down to
[2:48:51] show all that Adam and Eve lost is in
[2:48:53] the hands of the Bride now and if you
[2:48:56] bring the abstract with the title deed
[2:48:59] nothing can stop you claiming from what
[2:49:02] is rightfully yours
[2:49:05] it's already yours because God has
[2:49:09] already given to you that's the extreme
[2:49:11] joy of the hour
[2:49:13] brother Branham said in the Mighty God
[2:49:15] unveiled he says since the Holy Ghost
[2:49:17] has come in these last days is
[2:49:19] prophesied and the veil has been rent
[2:49:21] too many people hang to their traditions
[2:49:25] to try to hang to their traditions of
[2:49:27] the fathers and that's why they can't
[2:49:29] see this extreme joy and peace and
[2:49:33] things that the church has today yet it
[2:49:37] is in plain view of those who believe
[2:49:42] Hallelujah
[2:49:43] it's in plain view now I know that I
[2:49:46] know it's really waning here just pinch
[2:49:48] yourself five more minutes because we've
[2:49:50] come to an hour where it's actually the
[2:49:52] marriage of the Lamb the bride has made
[2:49:55] herself ready we've come into position
[2:49:58] to be United to the word why because the
[2:50:00] word has revealed we are his wife
[2:50:04] the word has revealed we are no longer
[2:50:06] church we are bride
[2:50:08] we are no longer just Sinners saved by
[2:50:11] grace we are Sons and Daughters of God
[2:50:13] made in the image of God come back with
[2:50:17] the Holy Ghost abstract to apply to the
[2:50:19] title deed to say everything in this
[2:50:22] book is mine
[2:50:25] it's no longer just a preacher laying
[2:50:27] hands on you yeah
[2:50:29] is no longer a prayer line you can have
[2:50:31] them if you want it's no longer just an
[2:50:33] altar call they're all right in their
[2:50:35] place sometimes we need those things the
[2:50:37] scripture says anoint them with oil and
[2:50:39] all of that that's perfectly all right
[2:50:41] but let me tell you something you have
[2:50:43] the rights
[2:50:45] you have the title team
[2:50:47] if you have received this message and
[2:50:49] you have received the Holy Ghost you've
[2:50:52] got the abstract title to eat to push
[2:50:54] the devil back off your inheritance
[2:50:59] say devil you got no rights on my
[2:51:01] inheritance you're a squatter
[2:51:04] why don't you tell him tonight devil
[2:51:06] you're a squatter
[2:51:08] you've been trying to tell me I need
[2:51:10] this sickness I don't need this sickness
[2:51:12] you've been trying to tell me I'm bound
[2:51:14] to these complexes I don't need these
[2:51:16] complexes
[2:51:18] you've been trying to tell me that
[2:51:19] because of my family or because of the
[2:51:22] way I'm made no my parents my
[2:51:24] grandparents my great-grandparents it's
[2:51:26] all wiped off by the Holy Ghost
[2:51:30] Hallelujah I got the abstract to apply
[2:51:33] to the title deed
[2:51:36] and the devil has no rights in my life
[2:51:39] I can say that no other man
[2:51:42] no other power as any right or
[2:51:45] responsibility over my life because I
[2:51:48] have come into marriage Union with the
[2:51:51] Lamb of God
[2:51:54] the devil is defeated
[2:51:57] rising of the sun brother Bradham says
[2:51:59] all my sins are struck out all your sins
[2:52:02] are struck out by the blood of Jesus
[2:52:04] Christ the Holy Ghost has come as an
[2:52:07] abstract to the title deed
[2:52:09] that God gave me my Grace by
[2:52:12] foreknowledge
[2:52:13] and then he says oh my what are you
[2:52:15] scared about
[2:52:16] no wonder he said fear not
[2:52:19] I am he that was dead and alive again
[2:52:23] and I'm Alive forevermore and have the
[2:52:26] keys of death and Hell
[2:52:28] that's what we preached on last night
[2:52:30] who is he he's your bridegroom
[2:52:33] who is he he's your beloved
[2:52:36] he's the one that's in love with you and
[2:52:38] he's the one you're in love with
[2:52:41] he says in the Patmos Vision he says
[2:52:43] Don't Fear John
[2:52:45] don't fear little flock
[2:52:47] put your name there
[2:52:49] all that I am you are heir to
[2:52:54] say hallelujah
[2:52:56] says all that I am you are Heir too
[2:52:59] I say Amen Lord
[2:53:01] I said I'm putting my name there Lord
[2:53:04] I don't care what the devil says no more
[2:53:06] I'm putting my name in your word
[2:53:09] I believe you sent this message as a
[2:53:11] love letter to me personally
[2:53:14] he says all my power is yours
[2:53:18] that's why it gives you the Holy Ghost
[2:53:20] that's all his power it's laying right
[2:53:23] Within You by the Holy Ghost it's not
[2:53:25] something you got to go get it's already
[2:53:26] in you if you got the Holy Ghost amen
[2:53:29] you just need to claim what is
[2:53:31] rightfully yours
[2:53:34] he says my omnipotence is yours as I
[2:53:37] stand in your midst
[2:53:40] says I have not come to bring fear and
[2:53:42] failure
[2:53:44] but love
[2:53:46] and courage and ability
[2:53:50] Hallelujah receive his love receive his
[2:53:54] courage and receive his ability
[2:53:57] he says all power is given unto me and
[2:54:01] it is yours to use
[2:54:03] you speak the word and I will perform it
[2:54:10] that is my Covenant and it can never
[2:54:14] fail
[2:54:16] Hallelujah who is he is the Covenant
[2:54:19] angel that descended with the book open
[2:54:21] he says this is my Covenant and it's all
[2:54:25] yours
[2:54:27] I give you the power I give you the word
[2:54:29] you speak it and I will perform it
[2:54:32] let's stand together tonight
[2:54:35] Hallelujah
[2:54:38] Hallelujah
[2:54:42] I wonder why the musicians are coming
[2:54:46] because our heads are bowed
[2:54:48] there's only one
[2:54:51] one way the devil can defeat you
[2:54:57] and that is if you don't have the
[2:54:59] abstract
[2:55:02] if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[2:55:05] the devil will just laugh at you
[2:55:09] but you don't have to stay there
[2:55:13] you just have to lay yourself on the
[2:55:15] altar
[2:55:16] with the sacrifice that God gave
[2:55:19] and say I want to be identified with his
[2:55:21] sacrifice tonight
[2:55:23] as our heads are bowed
[2:55:25] and our eyes are closed
[2:55:28] I wonder if there's somebody that would
[2:55:29] be
[2:55:30] just desirous enough to say Lord I need
[2:55:33] your Holy Spirit
[2:55:34] Lord I heard the power of it
[2:55:37] and I know that I need it more than
[2:55:39] anything else oh God and I'm willing to
[2:55:41] surrender everything that I am
[2:55:44] now surrender is an action
[2:55:46] all right it's an action that you got to
[2:55:49] raise your hands
[2:55:51] and the attitude behind your hands has
[2:55:53] to be like a wife to a husband I submit
[2:55:57] myself to you Lord
[2:56:00] it's why the Apostle Paul said about
[2:56:02] marriage it's really a mystery
[2:56:04] concerning Christ in the church when the
[2:56:07] church comes to that perfect surrender
[2:56:09] God sends down the Holy Spirit the
[2:56:13] abstract that gives her a right to every
[2:56:16] blessing in the word would your brothers
[2:56:19] just play I'm amazed that you love me
[2:56:22] as your hands are raised
[2:56:25] your eyes are closed
[2:56:30] I want you to
[2:56:34] say Lord I want you more than anything
[2:56:36] else
[2:56:38] I want you to speak to him tonight
[2:56:43] I want you to ask God because you know I
[2:56:46] can I can have you come up here and lay
[2:56:48] hands on you
[2:56:50] but it's not me laying hands on you that
[2:56:52] gives you the Holy Spirit
[2:56:57] don't fall back with God anymore say
[2:57:00] Lord I'm here
[2:57:02] and you're here and I want you to come
[2:57:04] and fill every fiber of my being
[2:57:07] with your presence tonight
[2:57:09] let's bow our heads together and pray
[2:57:13] Heavenly Father
[2:57:15] Lord you see the hands that are raised
[2:57:17] tonight oh God
[2:57:19] Lord you see the identification that is
[2:57:21] in the midst of your people
[2:57:23] Lord we have labored in your word
[2:57:25] tonight
[2:57:26] Lord we've desired to follow the
[2:57:28] leadership of your Holy Spirit
[2:57:30] but lord it's not up to me to open up
[2:57:33] people's hearts Lord it takes the Holy
[2:57:35] Spirit to do that father and you have
[2:57:38] spoken to them by your word and you see
[2:57:40] the hands that they have identified
[2:57:42] father Lord I need you
[2:57:45] Lord I need you in my life I recognize
[2:57:48] that there's a title deed that's mine
[2:57:50] but now Lord I need the abstract of the
[2:57:53] Holy Spirit to enforce the title deed
[2:57:56] upon the enemy I'm tired of dealing in a
[2:57:59] defeated life I'm tired lord of the
[2:58:02] Heavenly trampling Over Me Lord I'm not
[2:58:05] looking for an emotion but Lord if it's
[2:58:07] emotional that doesn't bother me I'm not
[2:58:10] looking for some kind of a sign but if
[2:58:11] you send some kind of something that
[2:58:13] won't bother me I just want what you
[2:58:15] want long
[2:58:16] I say not my will but thy will be done
[2:58:19] Lord we're praying that with all of our
[2:58:22] hearts and as we sing this song and as
[2:58:25] we open up our hearts to you I pray Lord
[2:58:28] that you'd feel your children Quicken
[2:58:31] their hearts with your Holy Spirit Lord
[2:58:35] we ask it oh God For Your Glory open up
[2:58:39] the windows of Heaven o God
[2:58:41] pour us out a blessing tonight O Lord
[2:58:43] when we open our souls unto the Living

[2:58:48] that you might fill us with love divine
[2:58:52] we come soberly we come with our
[2:58:55] offering
[2:58:56] to lay outside our life down upon the
[2:58:59] altar of the sacrifices
