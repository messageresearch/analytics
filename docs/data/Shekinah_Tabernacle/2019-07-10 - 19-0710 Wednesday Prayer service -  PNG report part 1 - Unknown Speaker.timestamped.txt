[25:12] here Exodus 33 and 18 I mean they mean
[25:20] when we do our there that's what isn't
[25:24] the Lord wonderful amen and he said this
[25:29] is Moses speaking to the Lord and he
[25:31] said I beseech thee show me thy glory
[25:33] and he said I'll make all my goodness
[25:36] pass before thee and I will proclaim the
[25:38] name of the Lord before thee before thee

[25:47] showing mercy upon me hallelujah and he
[25:49] said thou cannot see my face or no for
[25:53] there shall no man see me and live and
[25:55] the Lord said Behold there is a place by
[25:58] me and thou shalt stand upon a rock and
[26:01] it shall come to pass while my glory
[26:03] passes by that I will put thee in the
[26:05] cleft of the rock and shall cover thee
[26:07] with my hand while I pass by and I'll
[26:10] take away my hand and thou shalt see my
[26:12] back parts but my face thou shalt not be
[26:14] shall not be seen now we understand in
[26:16] this day we've seen the face of God but

[33:26] the came to the services I turned up so
[33:31] that I was there Sunday so I preached
[33:34] nine services over the time I was there
[33:37] but after the Sunday night service oh I
[33:39] handed this note and and I don't know
[33:42] who it was from but but she she wrote
[33:44] this note and said it basically to me
[33:46] you know when you're preaching about
[33:47] Ruth and you're preaching about Rahab
[33:49] and you know I could see you talking
[33:52] about me
[33:52] the service was for me and she said I'm
[33:54] a Catholic I'm a sinner I'm lost but I
[33:56] need the Lord
[33:57] anyway she she came to the Frank got
[33:59] prayed for and she got what she needed
[34:01] hallelujah so so she came and lost but
[34:04] went out found hallelujah praise the
[34:07] Lord so um few of these people in the
[34:10] back here are visitors from the
[34:11] settlement as well but a lot of these
[34:13] people gathered from all over the
[34:14] country so here's so here's so these so
[34:19] these this is a small church from a
[34:22] place in Jim boo and so this is the
[34:25] pastor it's brother cop see that brother
[34:29] now the message is quite new in Papua
[34:31] New Guinea about mid mid to late 2000s
[34:34] about 2006 this brother he was telling
[34:37] me his testimony he went to his his why
[34:41] his sister's place and so his
[34:43] brother-in-law
[34:44] so sisters her husband he had a copy of
[34:47] the prophet visit South Africa and this
[34:49] was back in 1991 and so he went to
[34:52] another province met them picked up the
[34:54] book and he said it just impressed his
[34:56] spirit was like Jesus Christ all over
[34:58] again he was amazed so he stole the book
[35:00] from his brother sloth and an ear ear he
[35:04] read it for the next 20 years couldn't
[35:07] find any books
[35:08] contacted voice of God obviously got
[35:10] lost in the mail somewhere you know but
[35:12] he read there for 20 years
[35:14] one book mr. mowett when he said it just
[35:16] spoke to him like nothing else it was a
[35:18] pastor now one of the Pentecostal
[35:20] denominations as well so it's not like
[35:21] he came out of the world and then in
[35:24] 2000 about 13 there was another brother
[35:27] who I'll find the photo of and he was
[35:29] doing some outreach in the local town
[35:30] and and he was using one or
[35:33] Romilly whose charts and picture brother
[35:35] branham on it and so when we and brother
[35:37] cops he saw the photo brother branham he
[35:39] said you know he said to brother Anton
[35:41] come to my church I want you to tell me
[35:43] about this man he became a believer
[35:45] lester's then and there he left his
[35:47] denomination so you know I'm out you
[35:49] know cuz there you can't just leave
[35:50] Church you you know it's a battle you
[35:52] know it's a battle just you can't just
[35:54] quit
[35:55] yeah they won't let you go but the bride
[35:58] has to be let go I mean so just think
[36:01] about 20 years province Africa but
[36:03] that's all ahead but it quick and you
[36:05] know that's what I say
[36:06] cast your bread upon the waters as the
[36:08] Bible says it'll come back to you you
[36:09] know the wood has a life of its own you
[36:11] know sometimes we get a worried how
[36:13] we're gonna witness how's this going to
[36:14] work out God will do it we we serve a
[36:16] supernatural God
