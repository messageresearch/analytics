[36:09] name I just want to sing one more song
[36:11] before we call up you can start playing
[36:13] the
[36:13] [Music]
[36:14] song just before um brother Ben comes I
[36:17] couldn't get the song out of my head
[36:19] this morning as I was driving here and I
[36:21] really wanted to do
[36:25] it
[36:28] and the thought was
[36:30] victory victory such a wonderful thought
[36:33] for victory I started to look up a few
[36:36] word terms of victory in the Bible on
[36:38] the way here and God gave David a great
[36:41] Victory David sought the Lord with all
[36:43] of his heart and he he was a man after
[36:45] God's Own Heart and then and 1
[36:47] Chronicles it says and David put
[36:49] garrisons in Syria Damascus and the
[36:51] syrians became David's servants and
[36:52] brought gifts this translation says thus
[36:56] the Lord preserve David withersoever he
[36:58] went but another version says and the
[36:59] lord gave David Victory wherever he
[37:03] went and then as it it was again in
[37:05] Chronicles it says and he put garrisons
[37:07] in Edom these were all the people that
[37:08] all his enemies that were coming after
[37:09] him eventually they were under his feet
[37:12] now matter where they came from no
[37:13] matter how many there were he fought
[37:15] this one and defeated it fought that one
[37:17] defeated fought that one defeated fought
[37:18] that one defeated and once again it says
[37:21] and the lord gave David Victory wherever
[37:24] he went first Corinthians say says but

[46:50] we're going to go to Revelations chapter
[46:51] 9 this
[46:54] morning
[46:57] amen let's read here Exodus 11 and um
[47:02] 4-7
[47:05] here and Moses said thus sayith the Lord
[47:08] about midnight will I go out into the
[47:10] midst of Egypt and all the firstborn in
[47:12] the land of Egypt shall die from the
[47:14] firstborn of pharaoh that Seth upon his
[47:16] throne even until the firstborn of the
[47:18] maid servant that is behind the mill and
[47:20] all the firstborn of beasts there shall
[47:22] be a great cry throughout all the land
[47:24] of Egypt such as there was done like it
[47:26] nor shall be like it anymore but against
[47:29] any of the children of Israel shall not
[47:31] a dog move his tongue against man or
[47:33] beast till that ye may know that the
[47:37] that the Lord doth put a difference
[47:39] between the Egyptians and Israel there's
[47:42] a difference God puts a difference amen
[47:44] amen then we're going to go to
[47:45] Revelations chapter 9 and we're going to
[47:47] read verses 1 down to verse 12 bit of a
[47:50] lengthy reading but I just trust you um
[47:53] just bear with me and then you'll have
[47:55] your seats and amen so Revelations 9 we
[47:59] know this is tied into Revelations
[48:01] chapter 10 amen with the and the opening
[48:04] of the bottomless pit in Revelations 10
[48:05] the mighty Angel comes down but we just
[48:07] want to talk about uh something here
[48:10] amen Revelations 9:1 and the fifth angel
[48:12] sounded and I saw a star fall from
[48:14] Heaven uh fall from Heaven unto the
[48:16] Earth and to him was given the key of
[48:18] the bottomless pit and he opened the
[48:20] bottomless pit and There Rose a smoke
[48:21] out of the pit as a smoke of a great
[48:23] furnace and the Sun and the a were
[48:25] darkened by reasons of the smoke of the
[48:28] pit and there came out of the smoke
[48:29] Locust upon the Earth so notice this is
[48:31] not a natural smoke and unto him was
[48:34] given power as scorpions of the Earth
[48:35] have power and it was commanded them
[48:38] they should not hurt the grass of the
[48:40] earth neither any green thing NE neither
[48:42] any tree but only those men which have
[48:45] not the Seal of God in their foreheads
[48:48] and to them it was given they should not
[48:49] kill them but that they should be
[48:51] tormented 5 months and that torment was
[48:53] as the torment of a scorpion when he
[48:56] striketh a man and in those days shall
[48:58] men seek death and shall not find it and
[49:01] shall desire to die and Death Shall flee
[49:03] from them and the shapes of the locusts
[49:05] were like unto horses prepared unto
[49:07] battle and on their heads as it were
[49:10] crowns like gold and their faces were
[49:12] the faces of men and they had haar as
[49:14] the hair of woman and their teeth are as
[49:16] the teeth of lions and they had
[49:17] breastplates as it were the breastplates
[49:19] of iron and the sounds of their wings
[49:21] was as the sound of Chariots of many
[49:23] horses running to battle and they had in
[49:25] their taals like under scorpions and
[49:27] there were stings in their tails and
[49:29] their power was to hurt men 5 months and
[49:31] they had a king over them which is the
[49:33] Angel of the bottomless pit whose name
[49:35] in the Hebrew tongue is aaden but in the
[49:37] Greek tongue has its name apolon one wo
[49:40] is passed beho behold there come two
[49:43] woes Hereafter amen so let's just as we
[49:46] finish reading the word let's just bow
[49:48] heads in a word of prayer you want to be
[49:49] remembered in prayer today amen you want
[49:51] to raise your hand to the Lord and let's
[49:52] just talk to let's talk to our great
[49:55] king great gracious father we're so

[50:46] the evil one Lord that you come and have
[50:48] preeminence father may you grant it Lord
[50:50] in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God
[50:53] bless you friends you can have your seat
[50:55] today so I want to talk about we can't
[50:57] sit on the fence anymore there's power
[51:00] you know there's great power in serving
[51:02] God in this day now I just want to
[51:03] before we go back to Revelations 9 there
[51:05] I just wanted to read you a um uh this
[51:07] is from a song little by little by
[51:09] sister Brenda Lewis that's G on to be
[51:11] with the Lord but very very anointed
[51:13] song she would write songs like it'll
[51:15] take a stronger win than this to that uh
[51:18] uh than to keep me from my promises you
[51:20] right it's very powerful music and you
[51:22] know but but there's this one here it
[51:23] says be thou strong and very correct
[51:25] rageous dispossess the inhabitants of
[51:27] your land I have given you this promise
[51:30] and it's time to take a stand amen
[51:33] you've got to drive out your enemies so
[51:35] your loved ones can go free amen and
[51:39] little by little you'll gain the victory
[51:41] amen so there's power there's a reason I
[51:44] mean there's power and separation unto
[51:46] the Lord amen that our loved ones can go
[51:48] free see God is God is wanting you to
[51:50] get into position that God can use you
[51:53] in your position to cast out the enemy
[51:55] out of your friends and loved ones that
[51:57] they can come into their inheritance as
[51:58] well so this walk is not just about
[52:01] ourselves amen it's about the people
[52:03] around you am mean so our Christian walk
[52:05] is very important how it affects one
[52:07] another amen so we've got to drive out
[52:10] the enemies of our land amen now just
[52:12] just just go so so that so those enemies
[52:15] could be fear it could be a depression
[52:17] it could be a little besetting sin you
[52:19] know it could be something that's just
[52:21] hindering your walk you got to drive
[52:22] that Spirit out I mean you've got to
[52:24] take the word of Lord and drive that
[52:26] thing out yourself cuzz the blood of
[52:28] Jesus Christ has given us ability to do
[52:30] so you know never ever I'm just going to
[52:33] jump to this I was thinking about in the
[52:34] study you know some people say it's hard
[52:36] to be a Christian in this day it's hard
[52:38] if you're not surrendered it's hard if
[52:40] you're not under the blood it's hard if
[52:42] you don't have the Holy Ghost it's very
[52:44] hard because it's human ability trying
[52:45] to serve God but if you know him it's
[52:47] easy am mean never ever let the devil
[52:50] get in your mind it's hard to be a
[52:51] Christian in this day no God is too
[52:53] powerful not to be able to walk with him
[52:56] God is too powerful not to be able to
[52:58] serve in him in this day he is the
[53:00] almighty all powerful God he's not an
[53:03] idol he's not some spirit that wanders
[53:05] around with no power he is the
[53:07] undefeatable undisputable champion of
[53:09] the world Amen he is conquered hell
[53:12] death in the grave it is not hard to
[53:14] serve him if you're surrendered but the
[53:15] devil will get in your mind it's hard to
[53:17] be a Christian don't listen to that
[53:18] lying Spirit he's lying to you he's
[53:21] nothing but a bluff you got to kick that
[53:22] devil off your Mountain so your loved
[53:24] ones can go free
[53:25] it is very easy to be a Christian if
[53:27] you're dead to self amen it's time to
[53:30] take a stand I may be repeating what
[53:32] brother Isaac preached at camp but I
[53:33] just want to come in behind that it's
[53:35] time to take a stand there comes a time
[53:38] when you just can't sit on the fence
[53:39] anymore amen there came a time in Egypt
[53:42] where the blood had to be applied amen
[53:44] it was more than just sympathizing with
[53:46] the prophet's Ministry it was more than
[53:48] just talking about the supernatural in
[53:50] the prophet's life but they had to be
[53:52] personally identified with that message
[53:54] amen and the only way to be perally
[53:56] identified was to apply the blood it was
[53:59] no good just to have the lamb around the
[54:01] house no good just to even kill the lamb
[54:03] the blood had to be applied that when
[54:05] everyone walked past your house they
[54:07] didn't need to ask you anything they saw
[54:09] the blood and they knew that you were
[54:11] associated with this Blood religion am
[54:13] mean with the power of the blood they
[54:14] knew you're Associated because your
[54:16] house was speaking to them that the
[54:18] blood was applied and it's time friends
[54:21] to apply the blood amen like never
[54:23] before it's not good enough just to
[54:25] sympathize with the move of God don't
[54:27] sympathize with it get in it amen as
[54:30] brother BR would say in the token
[54:32] talking about it is not enough you got
[54:33] to get under it you got to get under the
[54:35] wood got to get under the blood you got
[54:37] to let God have preeminence in your life
[54:39] cuz it's time to take a stand amen it's
[54:42] time amen for God to rise Sons and
[54:45] Daughters into position amen that our
[54:48] loved ones can go
[54:50] free amen so God would put a difference
[54:52] between the Egyptians and Israel and we
[54:54] live living in that same day now I read
[54:57] this here in Revelations chapter 9
[54:58] because this this has already come to
[55:01] pass as as we read here in the SL I'm
[55:04] just going to jump through these slides
[55:05] back and forth but you know we know the
[55:07] scripture looking at verse 12 here one W
[55:09] is passed behold and here come two woes
[55:11] Hereafter now we know in the Book of
[55:13] Revelation there are three woes and that
[55:15] is world wars amen so so this happened
[55:18] between the first wo and the second woe
[55:20] the bottomless pit was opened up and I
[55:23] got to tell you the reason it was opened
[55:24] up because the devil fell am mean he
[55:27] didn't choose to come and open the pit
[55:28] but he was pushed amen he fell he didn't
[55:31] come down and say here I am he was
[55:32] pushed he's fallen amen and now this now
[55:35] the smoke of this pit now the more you
[55:37] see Smoke Rise the darker the world gets
[55:40] now I remember when we um I think it was
[55:42] 2018 the family and I and N FZ came with
[55:45] us went down to a camp at brother Greggs
[55:47] and we were going through kakura and the
[55:49] place was dead still but it was all
[55:50] Smoky and it was just one fire putting
[55:53] fire into the atmosphere that made this
[55:56] smoke go all over the place it was just
[55:57] I think it was a fire from a farm
[55:59] burnoff or a something you know it
[56:01] wasn't even a big fire but how much more
[56:03] now how much more billowing who's ever
[56:05] seen like an oil well on fire who's ever
[56:08] seen that kind of just all this black
[56:10] smoke just go that's like when the
[56:12] bottomless put opened and the more that
[56:14] burns the more the the smoke comes out
[56:17] amen and we know that this as it said
[56:19] here it darkened amen it darkened and
[56:22] the Sun and the air were darkened in
[56:24] verse two so we know the sun in the
[56:25] Bible represents the True Light of the
[56:27] Gospel so now we're living in a day
[56:29] where it's a very smoky day people can't
[56:32] see the light anymore it's been obscured
[56:34] you know we've even seen remember when
[56:36] there were bush fires in Australia and
[56:38] the atmosphere being affected here amen
[56:40] with the smoke that was carried over and
[56:42] you know but you see so the atmosphere
[56:44] is different in this day than it was 100
[56:46] years ago or if it was even 60 odd years
[56:49] ago the atmosphere has changed because
[56:51] the bottomless pit has come open amen so
[56:54] now the smoke smoke has come upon the
[56:55] Earth that's why people say today what
[56:57] is truth how do you know what truth is
[56:59] you know because why the sunlight has
[57:01] been obscured by the smoke of this pit
[57:03] am mean people just debate the scripture
[57:05] and have an argument they try and
[57:06] fortify themselves behind an argument
[57:08] the reason they do that is because
[57:10] there's smoke got into their eyes
[57:12] there's no reality in the life of God in
[57:14] their life anymore why because the smoke
[57:16] of the pit and and we know Smoke Gets In
[57:18] everywhere right yeah it gets everywhere
[57:21] you can you know you can just be just a
[57:22] little whift of smoke go past you from a
[57:25] or something and it's in your clothes
[57:26] it's in your hair it's in everything
[57:28] amen but remember when Shadrach Meshach
[57:30] and ab this is the power of our God when
[57:32] Shadrach mesek and abedo came out of the
[57:34] furnace they didn't smell like none of
[57:36] it amen why because they knew they're
[57:38] God Amen they weren't fearing the
[57:40] furnace cuz God was able to deliver them
[57:42] Hallelujah so we can walk in this place
[57:44] it can be Smokey ass but we won't smell
[57:46] like the smoke it won't get into our
[57:48] eyes it won't affect us none why because
[57:50] we have the if you have the baptism of
[57:52] the Holy Ghost you have the Seal of God
[57:54] in your forehead
[57:55] Hallelujah cuz remember this thing so so
[57:58] this has happened this has happened what
[58:00] I'm reading is history but it still
[58:01] affects this day because the atmosphere
[58:03] has changed in the world right amen but
[58:06] you see now see see this thing now out
[58:08] of the smoke we read about these demon
[58:10] powers have been released and we can see
[58:12] now that you know you go back a hundred
[58:14] years the world has changed vastly I
[58:17] remember been doing um social studies at
[58:19] school they talked about the 1950s and
[58:21] 60s and the great change that came in
[58:24] New Zealand with culture and everything
[58:26] a vast change why because the bottomless
[58:29] pit was opened am mean there was a there
[58:31] was an article I wish I kept it about
[58:33] the anniversary of when the Beatles were
[58:35] first went to Australia and that one
[58:37] tour changed the whole country changed
[58:38] the culture changed everything why
[58:40] because four demon-possessed men wow
[58:43] took a gift that God gave them and sold
[58:45] it to the devil and released an
[58:46] anointing upon a country and that same
[58:49] thing happened in New Zealand amen
[58:51] that's why those things are from Hell
[58:52] amen don't don't dabble with nothing
[58:55] amen if you dabble you're going to get
[58:56] burnt and you'll find yourself not just
[58:58] burnt but but gripped amen so so we
[59:01] don't want to play with anything amen
[59:04] don't feed the animals what don't feed
[59:06] the devil amen don't give them time amen
[59:09] amen but you see here so the demon
[59:10] powers have come out of this thing and
[59:12] we see the effect of it of the mental
[59:14] health of the country of the world we
[59:17] see people broken and troubled and
[59:19] tormented in their minds mental you know
[59:22] I know this is not new to any of us we
[59:24] know this is this is here but this is
[59:25] why it's happened amen it's you know so
[59:28] so people's minds are greatly affected
[59:30] by these demon spirits of torment and it
[59:33] says but see but it was there in verse
[59:35] four of you put it in yellow there
[59:36] because you see these things are not
[59:38] here to hurt the Natural Earth but it's
[59:41] only those men who do not have the Seal
[59:43] of God in their foreheads that's why
[59:44] it's essential you must be born again
[59:46] you must receive you the Holy Ghost it's
[59:48] not a it's not a good idea it's not a
[59:51] nice thing to say it's a reality amen if
[59:54] you want peace of Mind get the mind of
[59:56] Christ am mean let God come into your
[59:58] life amen then these things they may try
[1:00:00] and trouble you but they won't they
[1:00:02] won't grab you amen because remember
[1:00:04] we're not immune from mind battles but
[1:00:05] when the Overcomer comes in amen you
[1:00:08] surrender him he'll overcome the Mind
[1:00:09] battle amen he'll cast out the evil one
[1:00:12] he'll give you peace he'll give you
[1:00:13] Victory he'll give you a testimony over
[1:00:15] those things amen so it says don't hurt
[1:00:18] the you see so so these things do not
[1:00:21] have dominion over those who have the
[1:00:23] Seal of God in their foreheads you see
[1:00:25] here and symbolically I've got it in
[1:00:27] yellow here against see and on their
[1:00:28] heads where is given crowns like gold
[1:00:31] now a crown represents a Dominion a a a
[1:00:34] position of authority see so they have
[1:00:37] authority to touch those who don't have
[1:00:39] the Seal of God they have authority to
[1:00:41] torment them amen but those who have the
[1:00:43] Seal of God are lifted up above these
[1:00:45] things amen these things do not rule us
[1:00:47] we rule them amen we have the authority
[1:00:50] by the blood of Jesus Christ to cast out
[1:00:52] these Spirits amen that these things
[1:00:54] would not rule us but we'll rule them
[1:00:56] they'll be under our feet we'll not be
[1:00:57] trotten down they'll be trotten down
[1:01:00] Hallelujah so we got to realize you got
[1:01:01] to realize it's time to take a stand
[1:01:03] because you've been given god-given
[1:01:04] Authority am mean to overcome these
[1:01:07] things who's with me this
[1:01:08] morning Hallelujah so this is so we we
[1:01:12] don't need to fear these things we don't
[1:01:14] need to fear this world we don't need to
[1:01:15] fear hell that's right amen if Jesus
[1:01:18] could walk into hell and be victorious
[1:01:21] amen and hell has emptied itself upon
[1:01:22] the Earth we can walk on this Earth and
[1:01:24] Victorious amen our God is too powerful
[1:01:27] to be overcome our God is too able amen
[1:01:31] we do not need to worry about see this
[1:01:33] world is falling because the bottomless
[1:01:35] put has come open it's falling and
[1:01:37] falling you can see every year people
[1:01:39] sadly these Spirits affect them more and
[1:01:41] more by how they address their actions
[1:01:44] tattoos and piercings and all different
[1:01:45] crazy stuff that people do and it's
[1:01:47] unfortunately demon Spirits this world
[1:01:49] is falling but there is one who can
[1:01:51] catch someone who's falling am mean like
[1:01:53] brother Bram saw the vision of his son
[1:01:55] Billy Paul he started smoking going onto
[1:01:57] the wrong crowd he saw him jump out of
[1:01:59] window and him tumbling down laughing
[1:02:02] and tumbling brother Billy Paul is a
[1:02:03] young young man laughing and just just
[1:02:06] falling and falling he's falling with
[1:02:07] the world but then the but then the
[1:02:09] prophet because he was standing in his
[1:02:11] position said catch my son Lord and then
[1:02:13] he saw two great hands as he fall and
[1:02:15] catch him amen and lift him up back from
[1:02:17] where he jumped out of amen that's the
[1:02:19] power of standing in your position amen
[1:02:22] if the prophet went and joined him say
[1:02:23] look I'll with you Billy I'll join him
[1:02:25] with you I'm going to be relevant he
[1:02:27] could never intercede like that I mean
[1:02:28] he' never be able to help a son but if
[1:02:30] you're standing in your god-given
[1:02:32] position and God's timing I mean God
[1:02:34] will catch them and God's timing God
[1:02:36] will get them he knows how far they need
[1:02:38] to go before they come to themselves I
[1:02:40] mean stay in your position have
[1:02:42] confidence in your God don't worry don't
[1:02:44] be distressed don't be discontented God
[1:02:47] is more than able amen my God can do
[1:02:49] anything he can save anyone any place
[1:02:52] anywhere I believe he can go to the
[1:02:54] worst most decrepit person in the world
[1:02:57] that we would think they've crossed the
[1:02:58] line they've gone too far they knew
[1:03:00] better and he can reach that one and
[1:03:02] bring them back amen I believe it amen
[1:03:05] I'm fully persuaded my God can do
[1:03:07] anything that's why we should be strong
[1:03:09] and very courageous Amen to take God at
[1:03:12] his word amen we don't need to back up
[1:03:14] we don't need to just fortify our see
[1:03:16] Israel learned a hard lesson with hamus
[1:03:19] they thought they can just kind of keep
[1:03:20] this thing contained in Gaza and have
[1:03:23] their defenses and put up their walls
[1:03:24] and so basically we can just manage this
[1:03:27] thing boy and put quotes and scriptures
[1:03:29] and all these things and but they but it
[1:03:31] come to bite them real bad and they
[1:03:34] realize they've been pacifying and the
[1:03:36] reason they were pacifying you know
[1:03:38] leaving hamus there is because of
[1:03:40] pressure of what other people will say
[1:03:42] what will the UN say what will the
[1:03:44] International Community say who cares
[1:03:47] about what other people say amen if
[1:03:49] there's a devil on your land you got to
[1:03:51] kick that thing out you have to drive it
[1:03:54] out you have the authority by the blood
[1:03:55] of Jesus Christ you do amen and and so
[1:03:59] they've just come to the point this
[1:04:01] hasn't worked that's we're going to
[1:04:03] dismantle this thing amen it doesn't
[1:04:05] matter what pressure comes on us we're
[1:04:06] going to dismantle this thing whatever
[1:04:08] the cost amen if I'm going to cry out at
[1:04:11] the altar if I'm going to if I going to
[1:04:13] make everything right of whatever I need
[1:04:14] to do I'm going to do it to dismantle
[1:04:16] this this network of tunnels of my life
[1:04:18] the enemy's built amen whatever I've got
[1:04:20] I've got to I got to cry out I got to I
[1:04:23] got to skip some meals and fast whatever
[1:04:25] I need to do Lord just bring me to a
[1:04:26] place where I actually surrender where
[1:04:29] it's not my human ability trying to do
[1:04:30] it but I give up and you take over
[1:04:33] Hallelujah whatever that is Lord God
[1:04:36] Amen they came to this place and they
[1:04:38] that's why they're determined amen we're
[1:04:40] going to dismantle this thing see we
[1:04:42] should never care what other people
[1:04:44] think if we're walking in the word we
[1:04:46] should walk in the word am mean whatever
[1:04:48] God remember where God made a covenant
[1:04:50] with you it's not you making a covenant
[1:04:52] with God many people make promises they
[1:04:54] turn it back it's God's promise to you
[1:04:57] that stands it's God's covenant with you
[1:04:59] remember he you didn't ask him to DN
[1:05:02] Calvary for you you didn't ask him to
[1:05:04] put your name on the L's book of life
[1:05:05] before the foundation of the world you
[1:05:07] didn't ask him those things he did it
[1:05:08] before you even realized amen he did it
[1:05:11] for you
[1:05:12] amen this is the greatest age to be
[1:05:14] alive in Hallelujah this is the greatest
[1:05:17] age to be alive in I'm so thankful I'm
[1:05:19] alive in 2023 I'm so thankful we have
[1:05:22] our strength we have sound mind amen we
[1:05:25] can serve God hallelujah this is the
[1:05:27] greatest time because Time and Eternity
[1:05:30] are blending together Hallelujah Lord
[1:05:32] praise the Lord but it's time to make a
[1:05:35] stand the Devil Makes fences so if
[1:05:39] you're sitting on the fence you're
[1:05:39] sitting on the devil's
[1:05:42] workmanship don't sit on the fence come
[1:05:45] and serve God give your life to Jesus
[1:05:47] Christ let him live in your life don't
[1:05:50] just sit there and say well the what
[1:05:51] could be no let him do it
[1:05:55] as I said there came a point where they
[1:05:56] had to kill the lamb and put the blood
[1:05:57] up to be identified amen and it's when
[1:06:00] you let the Holy Ghost come into you and
[1:06:03] take over your life that's what you need
[1:06:06] that's what we need we need the blood to
[1:06:08] be applied it's no longer just
[1:06:10] sympathizing and knowing Bible stories
[1:06:12] it's when God comes in and changes your
[1:06:14] life I I believe when they applied the
[1:06:16] blood it be more than just a dash on the
[1:06:18] door and L they would have covered the
[1:06:19] whole thing we going to be all covered
[1:06:22] my whole life's got to be completely
[1:06:23] cover by the blood Lord have I Lord are
[1:06:26] there any Stones unturned anything I see
[1:06:28] he'll He he'll tell you we don't have to
[1:06:31] see we don't work out God's leadership
[1:06:32] he tells us his leadership amen and we
[1:06:35] see that when the blood is applied to
[1:06:37] our lives the Holy Ghost has come in
[1:06:40] that's a sign you're under the blood is
[1:06:41] because you have the Holy Ghost because
[1:06:43] it's not a literal blood anymore cuz
[1:06:45] that blood is done and gone Jesus poured
[1:06:47] his life out we don't have that physical
[1:06:49] blood and even if I had that physical
[1:06:52] blood it wouldn't do me any good it just
[1:06:54] be a relic that we' we'd be AED by it'
[1:06:56] be a amazing to see the blood of our
[1:06:57] savior wouldn't it but it's not going to
[1:06:59] get us to Heaven just having the
[1:07:00] physical blood the life and the blood's
[1:07:02] got to come into us right that's how you
[1:07:04] know the blood is applied because the
[1:07:06] Holy Ghost comes in trust that's okay
[1:07:08] some people think oh you have you
[1:07:09] diminishing the blood no I'm magnifying
[1:07:11] the blood because the life in the blood
[1:07:13] has got to come into you and I see Jesus
[1:07:15] died not just to forgive us of our sins
[1:07:17] that the he would dwell in us that was
[1:07:19] his purpose of going to Calvary I want
[1:07:21] to wash your people clean I want to take
[1:07:23] sin nature out of their lives I take all
[1:07:24] unbelief out of their life that I can
[1:07:26] walk in them and I'll I'll be their God
[1:07:28] they'll be my people hallelujah
[1:07:30] hallelujah so it's when the Holy Ghost
[1:07:33] comes in the word he says here now
[1:07:35] speaking from Hebrews 12 amen that the
[1:07:37] New Testament the blood speaks better
[1:07:39] things the blood is speaking then the
[1:07:41] blood has got a voice and the voice of
[1:07:43] the blood is the word hallelujah that's
[1:07:45] what makes it whether it's right or
[1:07:47] wrong the word is identified by the
[1:07:49] voice of the blood the voice of the
[1:07:50] blood is the holy ghost that brings life
[1:07:53] it is life and it brings to life the
[1:07:55] word and quickens it amen so you know if
[1:07:57] you got the holy ghost that it's more
[1:07:59] than just you trying to remember
[1:08:00] scripture but the Holy Ghost takes that
[1:08:02] word and makes it live in your life amen
[1:08:04] that you can forgive you can love you
[1:08:06] can look over faults you can be honest
[1:08:09] you can ask for forgiveness you can put
[1:08:11] things right that's the blood actually
[1:08:13] taking effect you say what about signs
[1:08:15] Miracles and wonders people can have all
[1:08:17] those things and still be a devil and
[1:08:18] not be converted we believe in miracles
[1:08:21] but there's got to be a character
[1:08:22] there's got to be a nature there's got
[1:08:23] to be honest walk Walking honestly with
[1:08:25] all men amen no political agendas and
[1:08:28] twisting things for own ends we don't do
[1:08:30] that kind of thing around here amen
[1:08:31] that's Antichrist that's of the devil we
[1:08:33] just walk with God Amen so it's the when
[1:08:36] the Holy Ghost comes in he quickens the
[1:08:38] word to us and that makes the word
[1:08:41] live Hallelujah now if you you know if
[1:08:44] we could think back in these days there
[1:08:46] would have been a bit of a panic for
[1:08:47] imagine if this is the F maybe this is
[1:08:49] the firstborn here I don't know okay the
[1:08:51] first born's life is in
[1:08:55] so there would have been a panic brother
[1:08:56] BR dramatized it saying you know you
[1:08:58] know finally the blood's in on you know
[1:09:01] night night comes and then there's cries
[1:09:03] throughout Egypt as as the death Angels
[1:09:06] going through neighborhoods and the
[1:09:07] firstborn no doubt would maybe begin to
[1:09:09] panic saying Daddy did you do it right
[1:09:12] daddy did you apply the blood to the
[1:09:14] home Daddy is it really have you really
[1:09:16] followed Moses cuz his life is at stake
[1:09:19] we're going to realize our lives are at
[1:09:20] stake here not just the firstborn every
[1:09:22] one of us our eternal life is at stake
[1:09:25] amen so we been crying out is it okay
[1:09:27] and then you know his dad you know he
[1:09:30] said
[1:09:31] Son calm
[1:09:33] down a Vindicated Prophet has
[1:09:36] come God has over Vindicated him
[1:09:39] remember all the Miracles we have seen
[1:09:41] we have seen God time and time and time
[1:09:44] again and he gave these instructions the
[1:09:46] blood's got to be applied and we've
[1:09:48] followed the word as the word has been
[1:09:50] instructed to us and we've applied the
[1:09:53] blood you've seen what we've done you
[1:09:54] can rest you can rest in this time when
[1:09:58] death is coming through the land you can
[1:09:59] rest cuz you're secure amen and now the
[1:10:03] son could rest he could actually be
[1:10:05] relaxed in this time of death isn't that
[1:10:07] a strange thing amen but no we can we
[1:10:11] can rest see this see see the token if
[1:10:15] you have the Holy Ghost remember our
[1:10:16] token is the Holy Ghost right if you
[1:10:19] have the Holy Ghost it makes you so
[1:10:22] relaxed because you know You' have
[1:10:24] passed from Death to life you know
[1:10:26] you've come according to God's word to
[1:10:28] repent amen of Godly sorrow for your sin
[1:10:31] and forsake it I mean them that confess
[1:10:33] their sin and forsake it shall obtain
[1:10:35] Mercy it says in the Old Testament
[1:10:37] you've been baptized in the name of
[1:10:38] Jesus Christ you've been you've received
[1:10:40] the Holy Ghost you're relaxed
[1:10:43] now cuz it's no longer you being the
[1:10:45] Christian anyway you've entered into
[1:10:47] rest so it's no longer you trying to be
[1:10:49] the believer no he comes in and he's the
[1:10:51] believer out of your life that's why why
[1:10:53] we enter into rest because it's no
[1:10:55] longer I that liveth but Christ that
[1:10:56] liveth in me see the Apostle Paul on the
[1:10:59] road to Damascus entered into rest he
[1:11:01] was trying to learn and and you know
[1:11:03] absorb all the quotes and try and be
[1:11:05] some big preacher and all these things
[1:11:07] try and be a big shot in the church but
[1:11:09] then when he met God Amen he entered
[1:11:11] into true spiritual rest and he stayed
[1:11:13] in that rest until the day he left this
[1:11:15] Earth amen and it should be the same
[1:11:17] thing with you and I there should be
[1:11:19] such a rest now we can have trouble I'm
[1:11:21] not talking about emotional trouble now
[1:11:22] I'm talking about spirit ual rest I mean
[1:11:24] where God comes in you know you've met
[1:11:26] him he's turned your heart all you want
[1:11:28] to do is serve the Lord you love him
[1:11:29] with all that you are God's done a work
[1:11:31] right amen you can see him changing you
[1:11:33] you're going from glory to glory what
[1:11:35] you were you're not amen he's made you
[1:11:37] more like his word all the time
[1:11:39] who's I just told you your testimony
[1:11:42] praise God Amen God's there's there's
[1:11:45] nothing in this world that you want amen
[1:11:46] you just want him you want to serve him
[1:11:48] you love him what's God's done a work
[1:11:50] just keep walking in that just keep
[1:11:52] walking in that amen but you can rest
[1:11:54] now that God has done a work amen and if
[1:11:57] he's done a work you can rest now that
[1:11:59] doesn't mean you get LAX relaxed and LAX
[1:12:02] are two different things CU like I said
[1:12:05] about the Apostle Paul he became relaxed
[1:12:07] he entered into rest on the road to
[1:12:09] Damascus but he didn't sit there yeah he
[1:12:11] said Lord lead me he went here and he
[1:12:13] did what God told him and he went here
[1:12:15] he did what God called him to do and
[1:12:17] that's what he
[1:12:18] did right so so he didn't just sit there
[1:12:21] and do nothing no he was led by the
[1:12:23] spirit that's right if he had to make
[1:12:24] some tents for a season he made tents
[1:12:26] amen then when that finished he went
[1:12:28] somewhere else he was resting in God's
[1:12:30] timing and Leadership and he had
[1:12:31] confidence in it but if you don't have
[1:12:34] that rest amen you're trying to do it
[1:12:36] all yourself you just you might just be
[1:12:37] shooting the breeze you hit something or
[1:12:39] you'll just be hitting the breeze right
[1:12:41] but the sons of God led by the spirit of
[1:12:43] God Amen so it makes you so relaxed amen
[1:12:47] praise God praise the Lord amen but you
[1:12:50] see now so we're living in in a time
[1:12:54] where I said these Spirits have come
[1:12:57] into the
[1:12:58] world right we have dominion over them
[1:13:02] now those Spirits were if we you if you
[1:13:05] study the Feast of the trumpets message
[1:13:06] brother Brown tells us that you know
[1:13:09] those demon powers were loose first upon
[1:13:11] the Jews in a persecution that's why
[1:13:14] there was a holocaust went on all those
[1:13:16] things demon Spirits got into got into
[1:13:18] Hitler and you know um um himler and
[1:13:21] different ones got into molini got into
[1:13:24] those ones to kill the Jews and so what
[1:13:27] happens what happens against the Jews in
[1:13:29] the natural and now H those same spirits
[1:13:31] come against us in the spiritual amen
[1:13:34] that's why that's why the devil wants to
[1:13:36] come in and make us cold formal and
[1:13:38] Powerless a he wants to make us with a
[1:13:40] mule religion where we do a lot of works
[1:13:42] but there's no life in those works I
[1:13:44] mean he wants to take the joy out of the
[1:13:45] church wants to take your shout away
[1:13:47] wants to make you just a prisoner in a
[1:13:49] CH concentration camp where you don't
[1:13:51] get fat and flourishing on the word and
[1:13:53] we should be spiritually fat amen we
[1:13:55] should be real fat on the word amen we
[1:13:57] should roll into this place spiritually
[1:13:59] and roll out amen and say where's the
[1:14:01] next meal I enjoyed that one I want more
[1:14:03] Hallelujah we don't want to be these
[1:14:05] emaciated little kind of anemic kind of
[1:14:07] poor Christians that just get the wind
[1:14:09] blows and we get pushed around by waves
[1:14:11] of Doctrine and nice ideas now we should
[1:14:13] be fat and flourishing amen it's like
[1:14:15] brother Ram tells the story of the two
[1:14:16] farmers they each had a barn one had a
[1:14:19] big fancy Barn big Steeples amazing kind
[1:14:21] of barn amen but there was just a bunch
[1:14:23] of weeds in the bar the farmer didn't
[1:14:24] tried to feed them good none and you
[1:14:26] know there's a Cal went in there for a
[1:14:27] winter and then the neighboring property
[1:14:29] there was this old kind of bar the
[1:14:31] shingles were falling off the roof
[1:14:33] didn't look like much but the farmer put
[1:14:35] real good hay in there real good alal
[1:14:37] for real good things he knew that will
[1:14:38] fatten a calf out and then a c went in
[1:14:40] there and then you winter passed and
[1:14:42] then this and then this nice fancy Barn
[1:14:44] you know there's a button was pushed and
[1:14:45] the doors went real nice and fancy but
[1:14:48] this little crippled old calf walked
[1:14:50] staggered out maybe leaned against the
[1:14:52] fence trying to make it like this and
[1:14:54] then the and then the old old bar maybe
[1:14:56] the door fell off and this big fat round
[1:14:58] calf came jumping and kicking and
[1:15:00] snotting and hollering and this
[1:15:02] emaciated one just looked at him said
[1:15:04] that's such
[1:15:06] fanaticism right no he was fat and round
[1:15:08] way CU he' been feeding on some good
[1:15:10] food Hallelujah so but the devil doesn't
[1:15:13] want us to feed on good food he just
[1:15:15] wants to diminish the word into just a
[1:15:17] real two-dimensional nothing just say a
[1:15:20] sinner's prayer you we got to have more
[1:15:21] than a sinner's prayer amen now you got
[1:15:23] to really die out and be born again let
[1:15:25] God live and then every promise becomes
[1:15:27] true and you just amen get fatten around
[1:15:30] spiritually praise God I like food by
[1:15:33] the way naturally Spirit yeah I see a
[1:15:36] curry I just get
[1:15:37] happy praise the Lord you know you see
[1:15:40] food who has that kind of a thing you
[1:15:42] see some better it just makes you happy
[1:15:44] praise the Lord and so surely when we
[1:15:46] see this come open it should make us
[1:15:48] happy Hallelujah why cuz it served up
[1:15:50] for you and I to
[1:15:52] enjoy
[1:15:54] amen praise the Lord but you see the
[1:15:56] bride will walk with the word which is
[1:15:58] Christ it must be an agreement not the
[1:16:00] ecclesiastical system but the word you
[1:16:02] have to agree with the word to walk with
[1:16:04] the word Jesus said so it makes it right
[1:16:07] see a devil gets into a person because
[1:16:09] they agree with that demon they open a
[1:16:11] door that's in the negative if you want
[1:16:13] the Holy Ghost agree with the word you
[1:16:15] open a door he comes in you've got to
[1:16:17] just agree with the word it's not
[1:16:18] complicated it's really not just yes
[1:16:21] Lord Lord take my life I agree he'll
[1:16:24] take you over am right amen so you see
[1:16:27] we got to walk but you see all these
[1:16:29] lying Spirits are around but if we walk
[1:16:31] with the word we'll walk independent of
[1:16:33] what what the popular opinion is amen
[1:16:36] Micaiah would Micaiah would be brought
[1:16:38] before um Ahab and Jehoshaphat I think
[1:16:40] it was you know and and he had come late
[1:16:43] to the meeting cuz he wasn't invited but
[1:16:45] the day before there were 400 prophets
[1:16:47] that Ahab had and they prophesying go
[1:16:49] take ramoth gillad for the Lord's with
[1:16:51] you and they got really enthused am mean
[1:16:53] they ran around the church even the
[1:16:54] leader you can't quite or maybe you can
[1:16:56] but you know this guy made some two sets
[1:16:58] of horns he's the leader of the
[1:17:00] organization saying by these amen you're
[1:17:02] going to push the syrians out of the
[1:17:03] country they got really excited amen but
[1:17:06] what were they doing they were walking
[1:17:07] with a lying spirit because the prophecy
[1:17:10] of Elijah had to be fulfilled amen a pro
[1:17:12] and Elijah prophesied that ahab's blood
[1:17:15] would be licked by dogs right so so God
[1:17:18] was now orchestrating events that the
[1:17:19] words of Elijah would be fulfilled and
[1:17:22] so now K was told by the because you
[1:17:25] know Jehoshaphat he you know he saw the
[1:17:26] 400 he saw their one Accord and all
[1:17:29] their excitement he says to Ahab but do
[1:17:32] you have one
[1:17:33] more and no doubt Ahab kind of shifted
[1:17:36] on his throne and just looked at him for
[1:17:37] a minute and
[1:17:38] said what there's 400 here
[1:17:42] bro they've all got you know they're all
[1:17:44] one Accord did did you not see the
[1:17:46] excitement and feel the atmosphere and
[1:17:48] the charge in the room but have you got
[1:17:50] one more yeah I got one more but you
[1:17:52] know he preach he's not in tune with the
[1:17:55] rest of the ministry he does what he
[1:17:57] wants to do he always prophesies against
[1:17:59] me but he was walking with the word you
[1:18:02] see and then so when when when one of
[1:18:04] the guys went to go get M says now
[1:18:06] listen you've been out of Fellowship for
[1:18:08] a long time you know you want to come
[1:18:10] back in now this is the convention right
[1:18:11] you want to speak at this convention you
[1:18:13] got to say the same things this is what
[1:18:14] brother so and so's been saying brother
[1:18:16] so and so and you know those things can
[1:18:18] be such a shot across the bow to try and
[1:18:19] get you to say certain things right but
[1:18:21] he said no I'll only say what God puts
[1:18:23] in my mouth and so that night he prayed
[1:18:25] he saw a vision of Heaven that lying
[1:18:28] Spirit up there and coming into all
[1:18:29] those things and then so you know the
[1:18:32] rest of the story Ahab was killed in the
[1:18:34] battle all those things were done but
[1:18:35] you see he walked with the word he did
[1:18:37] not walk with the ecclesiastical
[1:18:40] system we're an independent woman folks
[1:18:43] amen that's a quote the bride is an
[1:18:45] independent woman we're not hooked up
[1:18:47] with anything but the word of God praise
[1:18:49] the Lord
[1:18:51] amen hallelujah now these Spirits we
[1:18:55] know will continue here and go into the
[1:18:57] Great Tribulation but we don't need to
[1:19:00] fear going into the Great Tribulation
[1:19:02] amen we're we're fighting a victory
[1:19:04] we're fighting a battle he's already won
[1:19:07] amen but you see now we do not need to
[1:19:10] go through the Great Tribulation to be
[1:19:11] per to be perfected amen amen it says
[1:19:14] what has it done in cunningness he said
[1:19:16] he came in like flatteries what has he
[1:19:17] done he's bringing the Protestant
[1:19:18] ecumenical council of the world churches
[1:19:21] and the spirit of the Antichrist both on
[1:19:23] them bringing them to the slaughter just
[1:19:25] like he did the other in the hour to
[1:19:26] call the bride how he loosed in the
[1:19:28] ecclesiastical Church Spirit loosed upon
[1:19:31] what not upon the denominations but upon
[1:19:33] the brides those same spirits that came
[1:19:35] against the Jews and the Holocaust that
[1:19:37] are now fighting them through humus amen
[1:19:40] those same spirits come against us in a
[1:19:42] spiritual manner that's why we've got to
[1:19:44] be very aware amen anything that tries
[1:19:46] to take our joy tries to chain us to
[1:19:48] something that's not the word of God
[1:19:51] we're got to we're got to withstand that
[1:19:52] thing amen amen now every promise of God
[1:19:55] is here for the believer everything of
[1:19:57] the old New Testament Church is has been
[1:20:00] restored every gift every sign every
[1:20:04] Miracle everything Hallelujah has been
[1:20:08] restored so we never want to come cold
[1:20:10] formal and Powerless that's not our
[1:20:12] that's not a that's not my part of the
[1:20:15] scripture right it's time to make a
[1:20:17] stand amen if you stand for God God will
[1:20:19] stand for you Hallelujah I trust
[1:20:21] everyone's happy today amen now he says
[1:20:24] see loosed upon see not upon the
[1:20:26] denominations but upon the bride but
[1:20:28] here you'll get it the bride will not go
[1:20:30] through that time this is the Great
[1:20:31] Tribulation the Bible says not the
[1:20:33] church will but not the bride can't you
[1:20:34] see ministers can't you see Brethren you
[1:20:36] say the church has to go through the
[1:20:38] persecution the Perfection of it the
[1:20:40] blood of Jesus Christ perfects the bride
[1:20:42] remember he took our judgment on Calvary
[1:20:45] he didn't take some of it he took all of
[1:20:47] it the full penalty of sin he took upon
[1:20:51] himself for you and I the full penalty
[1:20:53] not just the down payment not just part
[1:20:55] of it but all of it am mean all of the
[1:20:57] wrath of God that we should have
[1:20:59] received he took that down Calvary he
[1:21:01] stood as a breach between amen God and
[1:21:03] us hallelujah to take out our punishment
[1:21:06] thankes praise God it's the blood of
[1:21:08] Jesus Christ perfects the bride amen a
[1:21:10] man who chooses a wife don't put her
[1:21:12] through a lot of punishment he's already
[1:21:14] found Grace too with her and she has
[1:21:16] found Grace with him he engages to her
[1:21:18] and if there is anything he'll keep her
[1:21:20] from every place to turn her hand his
[1:21:23] grace is so great upon them hallelujah

[1:21:59] can't immigrate anywhere this is where
[1:22:02] we came from this is where we're staying

[1:23:12] do you do you look into the promises of
[1:23:14] God you listen to the message that's
[1:23:16] lighting it because the word illuminates
[1:23:18] your life that you can see where you've
[1:23:20] opened the door troubles coming where it
[1:23:22] actually illuminates the situation I
[1:23:24] think too many times we sit in our own
[1:23:25] heads trying to figure things out that's
[1:23:28] not lighting a candle that's just
[1:23:29] sitting there with in your own head no
[1:23:30] light a candle listen to the word
[1:23:32] prayerfully open the scripture start
[1:23:34] reading through God will direct you to
[1:23:36] the answer Hallelujah then you can
[1:23:38] redeem back that which the devil's taken
[1:23:40] from
[1:23:41] you

[1:23:45] amen praise God and so will it be upon
[1:23:49] the bride and so it is on the bride we
[1:23:51] unworthy creatures is deserving of hell
[1:23:53] but his grace holds us through it
[1:23:55] hallelujah look at how many lost and
[1:23:57] blind how many how many Sinners was
[1:23:59] there in the world they are I got saved
[1:24:01] God saved me for a purpose and I'm
[1:24:03] determined by his will to do that
[1:24:04] purpose I don't care what anything else
[1:24:06] goes I want to do it amen so what does
[1:24:09] that you say well I'm not a preacher
[1:24:10] whatever no no our purpose is to stand
[1:24:13] in our god-given
[1:24:14] position right it'll have different out
[1:24:17] outworkings according to where you are
[1:24:18] in the body but our purpose all of us is
[1:24:20] to stand and our god-given position
[1:24:23] that's right Lord
[1:24:25] amen cuz we got to realize the Lord is
[1:24:28] able to keep us from falling the world
[1:24:30] is falling but he's able to keep us from
[1:24:33] falling remember he's the strong hands
[1:24:35] that lift us up he's the strong one that
[1:24:37] holds us amen so we don't need to fear
[1:24:39] this world of gross darkness no the
[1:24:41] light has come to you and I amen that
[1:24:44] this smoke may be around us but it's not
[1:24:45] going to get in US amen it may be around
[1:24:47] us but this we got I have it can't get
[1:24:49] in our eyes amen so he is now unto him
[1:24:53] that is able to keep you from falling
[1:24:55] and to present you faultless before the
[1:24:57] presence of his glory with exceeding Joy
[1:25:01] amen he's you think we're going to be
[1:25:02] happy that day he's got exceeding Joy
[1:25:04] amen he's not just yep he's not Bravo
[1:25:07] he's going to he's going to be dancing
[1:25:09] the most I think Hallelujah why because
[1:25:11] he because we're actually his love gifts
[1:25:14] am praise God Hall amen but you see now
[1:25:19] Abraham see Abraham knew the power of
[1:25:21] his position that's right there were
[1:25:24] people around him that caused him a lot
[1:25:25] of trouble but that didn't knock him out
[1:25:28] of his position remember when God called
[1:25:30] Abraham he didn't call lot but lot went
[1:25:33] with him lot got a lot of blessings from
[1:25:35] being with Abraham I believe the reason
[1:25:36] he had so much cattle in these things is
[1:25:38] because because of Abraham's blessing
[1:25:41] fell upon him see we can just our lives
[1:25:43] the Holy Ghost within us can bless
[1:25:45] people around us and they might not even
[1:25:47] realize the power of the blessing but
[1:25:49] you see lot got in trouble a couple of
[1:25:51] times
[1:25:53] one time he got caught up in a war and
[1:25:54] he got taken away captive now because
[1:25:56] Abraham was called by God he knew that
[1:25:58] God made a covenant with him and he
[1:25:59] stood in that position amen he could arm
[1:26:02] his servants and go get his family back
[1:26:05] praise God because he stood in his
[1:26:06] position see he did not follow lot to
[1:26:09] try and save lot he walked with God and
[1:26:12] saved lot see there's a big difference
[1:26:14] you say well I've got to be all things
[1:26:15] to all men no Jesus did not become you
[1:26:18] know he did not become a drunk to try
[1:26:20] and win the drunk he went to the Sinners
[1:26:23] but he didn't become a sinner to win
[1:26:24] them amen that's right oh we're going to
[1:26:26] be relevant no you just be a loving warm
[1:26:29] friendly Christian right and people will
[1:26:31] know that you have a genuine love for
[1:26:33] them people feel if you know who knows
[1:26:35] that you know people know if you
[1:26:37] actually have a love for them you just
[1:26:38] be a warm loving open Friendly Christian
[1:26:41] they say something you know or or maybe
[1:26:43] you just drop something in you know and
[1:26:45] see where it leads if you feel a door
[1:26:47] closed you stop talking about the Lord
[1:26:49] but you just be a warm loving Christian
[1:26:51] that they that they know
[1:26:53] if if they have a question they can come
[1:26:54] to you and you're not kind of all kind
[1:26:56] of weird about talking about the
[1:26:57] greatest thing that's ever happened to
[1:26:59] you right but it's natural to talk about
[1:27:01] the Lord to them right but you see so so
[1:27:04] he armed so he armed his servants
[1:27:06] because he was walking with God and he
[1:27:08] got lot back but now there came but now
[1:27:11] there came a another trouble that
[1:27:13] happened as there was Strife between
[1:27:15] lots herdsmen and Abraham's herdsman
[1:27:18] because they had so much cattle and
[1:27:20] sheep and different things that the land
[1:27:21] could not sustain them I'm just I'm not
[1:27:24] yeah this from Genesis now so Abraham
[1:27:26] said to lot you take where you want to
[1:27:28] go and I'll take the other part so lot
[1:27:31] looked and saw the well watered Plains
[1:27:32] of Sodom and he and he said well that
[1:27:34] looks good I'm going to go there and
[1:27:37] then Abraham took the other part right
[1:27:38] so there was a separation now now so
[1:27:41] there came a point now in in Abraham's
[1:27:44] Journey that he could not arm his
[1:27:47] servants like before and go get L out
[1:27:49] because God came down and visited lot
[1:27:53] right I mean Abraham and told Abraham
[1:27:56] what he's going to do he's going to go
[1:27:57] burn Sodom up now if you look at if you
[1:28:00] look at
[1:28:01] lot lot lot lot went down to Sodom he
[1:28:05] was a righteous man compared to the
[1:28:06] sodomites right but then that living
[1:28:10] there it just vexed it he was vexed with
[1:28:13] the filthy conversation of the wicked
[1:28:15] for that righteous men dwelling among
[1:28:17] them and seeing and hearing Vick's
[1:28:18] righteous soul from day to day with
[1:28:19] their unlawful Deeds now let me ask you
[1:28:22] a question what was the power of Lot's
[1:28:24] testimony to them yeah it didn't impact
[1:28:26] them at all didn't even impact his
[1:28:28] sons-in-law yeah when you when the two
[1:28:31] angels came down to bring them out and
[1:28:32] you know God would you know lot would
[1:28:34] say we've got to leave you got his
[1:28:35] family we got to leave this place he
[1:28:37] going to get burned up his own
[1:28:38] sons-in-law laughed at him they made fun
[1:28:41] of him saying such a ridiculous thing
[1:28:43] seemingly but it was God right but you
[1:28:45] see so his his testimony had no impact
[1:28:49] wow by being down in Sodom and you see
[1:28:52] and you see people that are you know
[1:28:53] Christian people nominal people
[1:28:55] seemingly good Christian people and
[1:28:57] they're just vexed about how evil the
[1:28:58] world has become and that's all they
[1:29:01] talk about that's all they focus on it's
[1:29:02] hard being a Christian today look at the
[1:29:05] world's getting more evil look at all
[1:29:06] the trouble on every hand look at all
[1:29:07] and all they see is the negative side
[1:29:10] amen now what good would have been
[1:29:12] Abraham if he went down and joined lot
[1:29:14] down in Sodom because two lots would
[1:29:17] have just had more of a conversation
[1:29:18] than one among themselves they would not
[1:29:21] have been able to help one another if
[1:29:23] lot was a whole group of people and they
[1:29:25] just were talking about these things it
[1:29:26] wouldn't have helped them right he
[1:29:28] needed someone who wasn't even because
[1:29:30] even lot we're going to realize he
[1:29:32] hinded Abraham's
[1:29:35] walk after this happened after they
[1:29:37] separated then God said look at north
[1:29:39] south east west this is all yours so lot
[1:29:42] was actually a hindrance to Abraham's
[1:29:45] Faith right but Abraham never gave up on
[1:29:48] lot but the power that Abraham had to
[1:29:52] help lot was was Abraham Walking with
[1:29:55] God so we got to realize we don't put
[1:29:58] people in categories we got to realize
[1:29:59] just stay in your position you will help
[1:30:02] no one joining them becoming like them
[1:30:05] okay you can only help friends family
[1:30:06] loved ones whoever it is by staying in
[1:30:09] your position and walking with the word
[1:30:10] that's the only way you can help anyone
[1:30:13] amen so so they were vexed they were
[1:30:15] your lot was troubled down in Sodom but
[1:30:17] nothing nothing he did or said helped
[1:30:20] the city at all sadly
[1:30:22] right and so now so Abraham did not
[1:30:25] follow him down there but yet when God
[1:30:28] came his way what was what was Abraham's
[1:30:31] burden what about if you find 50
[1:30:33] righteous in the city will you say he
[1:30:35] came it down to 10 I believe if he
[1:30:36] combed it down to less Sodom Gomorrah
[1:30:38] wouldn't have been burnt up right but he
[1:30:41] he was interceding for his family with
[1:30:43] God and because he was separated unto
[1:30:45] God see there's power and separation
[1:30:47] we're going to get into it soon well
[1:30:48] maybe we're already into it but you know
[1:30:49] there's power and separation and you see
[1:30:51] he stayed in his position and and lot
[1:30:55] was brought out of Sodom he didn't walk
[1:30:57] out himself he didn't come to a point
[1:30:58] and say I'm sick of this stuff let's
[1:31:00] quit let's go let's go back farming
[1:31:02] again no he was stuck in this rut he
[1:31:04] couldn't get out of himself and people
[1:31:07] who are stuck in sin blinded by the
[1:31:08] world they can't get out themselves they
[1:31:10] need a stronger one to come down and get
[1:31:12] a hold of them well how can that take
[1:31:14] place you staying in your position
[1:31:15] interceding for them and God can go get
[1:31:17] a hold of their
[1:31:19] life Hallelujah you take Peter in the
[1:31:21] prison he was stuck in the inner prison
[1:31:23] he couldn't get out but they're having a
[1:31:24] prayer meeting at John Mark's house and
[1:31:26] an angel came and loosed him and Peter
[1:31:28] thought he was in a dream when he was
[1:31:29] woken up by the angel all these things
[1:31:31] but when he came out of this came out of
[1:31:33] the prison he realized man that wasn't a
[1:31:34] dream I just got loosed amen hallelujah
[1:31:37] so amen why because they were
[1:31:39] consecrated to the word they consecrated
[1:31:41] to God God could move on on his
[1:31:45] behalf amen but you see lot is looking
[1:31:47] for all the wrong things they want see
[1:31:50] every nation or every movement they want
[1:31:52] a Superman they want an anointed Messiah
[1:31:55] Amen to to to push their own agenda amen
[1:31:58] Russia wants a Superman amen the
[1:32:01] America's looking for one the Eastern
[1:32:03] world's looking for one the un's looking
[1:32:04] for one America thought they had one and
[1:32:07] Trump because they're trying to bring a
[1:32:08] religious political move to restore
[1:32:10] Christianity to the world you'll never
[1:32:12] do it you'll never do it amen all it
[1:32:15] does is entangle people to take them to
[1:32:17] the battle of Armageddon that's all it
[1:32:18] does unfortunately I mean just like the
[1:32:20] Jews there before the destruction of
[1:32:22] Jerusalem those religious political Jews
[1:32:24] were the ones that caused that
[1:32:26] Revolution against the Romans they were
[1:32:28] the ones that caused the temple to be
[1:32:29] destroyed those were the ones that
[1:32:31] caused actually those Romans to come and
[1:32:32] slaughter them
[1:32:35] all Russia's looking for a messiah that
[1:32:37] anointed brains that knows how to
[1:32:39] conquer out of space for them beat ion
[1:32:41] to the Moon they want to conquer the
[1:32:42] world but you see the bride has received
[1:32:45] their Superman we've received our
[1:32:48] anointed Messiah the word amen we have
[1:32:51] our super man we're not looking for an
[1:32:52] anointed one to come and save the day
[1:32:54] he's already turned up amen he's already
[1:32:56] just like with Abraham he turned up
[1:32:58] before lot ever went down into Sodom and
[1:33:01] Abraham was walking with them praise the
[1:33:04] Lord amen but you see now when people
[1:33:07] are looking for a messiah like this they
[1:33:09] actually turn God into an Aaron boy but
[1:33:12] you see when they ask these things what
[1:33:13] is those things looking for a Superman
[1:33:15] to save the
[1:33:17] day see when they ask these things ask
[1:33:19] for this they don't ask as Jesus asked
[1:33:22] you try to make God like an Aaron boy
[1:33:24] Lord you do this for me you do that for
[1:33:25] me and you go do that tell them what to
[1:33:27] do Jesus said when you pray pray like
[1:33:29] this manner Our Father which art in
[1:33:31] heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom
[1:33:33] come thy will be done who finds where we
[1:33:36] do that you're always wanting God to run
[1:33:39] errands for us or do something for us
[1:33:40] but when we're willing to say thy will
[1:33:42] be done commit ourselves to him commit
[1:33:44] our ways to him all that we are
[1:33:46] committed to him that's when God will
[1:33:48] move when you're willing to let him work
[1:33:50] on you not you work on
[1:33:52] him who wants God to work on them
[1:33:56] hallelujah amen amen hallelujah now you
[1:34:00] see Abraham separated himself from lot
[1:34:05] and God's word calls for a total
[1:34:07] separation from unbelief God's word
[1:34:09] calls for it right because God wants us
[1:34:12] to get into position that God can use us
[1:34:14] to our full capacity who wants that a
[1:34:18] okay some of you do amen hallelujah I'm
[1:34:21] glad some do amen but you see we got to
[1:34:23] separate to the word that God will do
[1:34:25] what he wants to do in our lives amen
[1:34:28] amen but you see see there's power and
[1:34:30] separation there's power and separation
[1:34:32] who knows that I'm probably preaching to
[1:34:34] the choir but there's power and being
[1:34:35] separated to the Lord see the devil say
[1:34:38] there's see he always says there's the
[1:34:39] you can't you can't and you can't you
[1:34:42] can't do this you can't do that you
[1:34:43] can't see this you can't watch this you
[1:34:45] can't and the reason he's giving you the
[1:34:47] count is he wants you to do those things
[1:34:48] he can jump in your life and destroy you
[1:34:50] right see see 100 years ago 60 years ago
[1:34:53] people would struggle with short with
[1:34:55] your short skirts that' be a struggle
[1:34:57] now it's with drugs and pornography you
[1:34:59] know these demons are a lot more in this
[1:35:01] day so but you can't sit on the fence if
[1:35:04] you sit on the fence those things will
[1:35:05] get you but if you're sealed in the
[1:35:07] devil sealed out amen so if you're
[1:35:09] sealed in by the Holy Ghost the devil's
[1:35:10] sealed out right so we don't want to
[1:35:12] just sit on the fence
[1:35:15] now the mother of Samson was told that
[1:35:19] she should be separated to God God
[1:35:22] because the son that she would have
[1:35:24] would start to deliver Israel from the
[1:35:26] hand of the Philistines see so it wasn't
[1:35:28] just God putting some Grievous burden
[1:35:31] soall upon her for the sake of it but he
[1:35:34] is telling her you separate unto me a
[1:35:37] deliverer will be borne out of you and
[1:35:39] it's the same thing with the church it's
[1:35:40] the same thing with our lives if we're
[1:35:42] separated unto God the Del not a
[1:35:44] deliverer the deliverer the Lord Jesus
[1:35:47] Christ will be birth into manifestation
[1:35:49] in our lives amen then he will begin to
[1:35:51] work work and deliver from every unclean
[1:35:53] spirit amen so so that's what he was
[1:35:55] told now now really what was set before
[1:35:58] her that day was life and
[1:36:01] death amen as it say in Deuteronomy here
[1:36:04] I call Heaven and Earth to to record
[1:36:06] this day I've set before you life and
[1:36:08] death blessing and cursing therefore
[1:36:10] choose life that both thy and thy seed
[1:36:13] shall live that thou mayest love the
[1:36:16] Lord thy God and thatou mayest obey his
[1:36:18] voice and that thou mayest cleave unto
[1:36:19] him for he is thy life and the length of
[1:36:21] thy days that thou mayest dwell in the
[1:36:23] land which the Lord swear unto thy
[1:36:25] fathers to Abraham Isaac to Jacob to
[1:36:28] give them amen so so these two things
[1:36:30] were set before her life and the law of
[1:36:32] life and the law of death you say well
[1:36:35] but that's Old Testament well the
[1:36:37] Apostle Paul would say this in Romans
[1:36:39] that the righteous of the law might be
[1:36:40] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[1:36:42] flesh but after the spirit for they that
[1:36:44] are after The Flesh do mind the things
[1:36:46] of the flesh but they that are after the
[1:36:48] spirit the things of the spirit to be
[1:36:49] kindly minded as death
[1:36:52] so to be kindly minded is not just a bad
[1:36:54] idea it's not just a headache it's not
[1:36:56] just some regret it's death I mean but
[1:36:59] to be spiritually minded is life and
[1:37:02] peace Lord so you can't be you can't be
[1:37:04] kindly minded and have life and peace
[1:37:07] those things do not overlap am mean the
[1:37:09] devil wants you to think it is but you
[1:37:10] can't have life and Peace by being
[1:37:12] kindly minded right now to be
[1:37:15] spiritually minded is not just to post
[1:37:17] nice you know have nice scriptures
[1:37:19] around your home and read the Bible from
[1:37:20] time to time and pray those things are
[1:37:22] all good but to be spiritually minded is
[1:37:24] have the Holy Ghost the mind of Christ
[1:37:26] in
[1:37:27] you everyone's gone real quiet on me are
[1:37:30] we but this is this is true right you've
[1:37:33] got to have you've got to have the mind
[1:37:34] of Christ to have life and peace amen
[1:37:37] because the spiritual because the caral
[1:37:39] mind sorry is enity against God for is
[1:37:41] not subject to the LA of God neither
[1:37:43] indeed can be so when that we are in the
[1:37:47] flesh so they that are in the flesh
[1:37:49] cannot please God right say but I'm in
[1:37:52] this body yeah you're in this body but
[1:37:53] what's what's motivating your life is it
[1:37:56] your carnal natural thinking you're born
[1:37:58] with or is it the mind of Christ
[1:38:00] directing
[1:38:01] you
[1:38:03] hallelujah amen you see now Samson was
[1:38:06] born Samson's parents separated to the
[1:38:08] promise and they got life but now every
[1:38:11] generation must walk with God see the
[1:38:15] younger generation cannot ride the
[1:38:17] coattails of the older and and and just
[1:38:19] feed off their Revival okay but every
[1:38:22] generation has a right a chance at the
[1:38:24] word of God to see signs and W wonders
[1:38:27] and miracles and God moving in power
[1:38:30] every generation has that right that's
[1:38:32] why we have Camp that's why we have
[1:38:33] church to create an atmosphere that
[1:38:35] every generation will meet God we'll
[1:38:37] know him in power we'll know him in the
[1:38:39] reality of his word amen that's what we
[1:38:41] want for our children don't we we want
[1:38:43] them to be filled with the spirit amen
[1:38:44] them to have test them to that that when
[1:38:47] we read the Bible read the book of Acts
[1:38:48] we say that's my daughter that's my son
[1:38:51] that's my spouse an ongoing testimony
[1:38:54] not just a one- Time testimony an
[1:38:55] ongoing testimony of God's hand in their
[1:38:58] lives Hallelujah see so Samson Samson
[1:39:03] realized he was born amen he had to
[1:39:05] realize he was born to conquer the
[1:39:08] Philistines but you see he came to a
[1:39:11] point where he thought he could do
[1:39:13] whatever he could dabble with wherever
[1:39:15] he wanted and he'd be okay but there's
[1:39:18] always there's always a too far now that
[1:39:21] doesn't mean there's not a way back but
[1:39:23] there's a way are too far right so he
[1:39:26] came to a point where where Dela
[1:39:29] Bewitched him by emotional manipulation
[1:39:34] to do what she wanted we don't want to
[1:39:36] do that amen amen but but you see so she
[1:39:40] he was deceived by the brother would say
[1:39:43] a deceived Church by the world said
[1:39:45] Delila is the world and Samson's the
[1:39:47] church and so now what happened is he
[1:39:50] did not stay in his position separated
[1:39:52] to God the first thing see see you never
[1:39:56] ever want to let the devil take your
[1:39:59] Covenant get between you and your
[1:40:00] Covenant with God Amen this is what
[1:40:02] happened with with with him he couldn't
[1:40:04] take the pressure anymore life got too
[1:40:07] hard but he allowed it to happen but
[1:40:09] that pressure of her constantly tell me
[1:40:11] your secret tell me this I thought you
[1:40:13] love me should be no secrets all this
[1:40:15] manipulation got too much so he thought
[1:40:18] I'm just going to quit and tell her cuz
[1:40:20] I want peace
[1:40:21] no you know it's like with Hamas someone
[1:40:24] I heard Ben Shapiro say it in a debate
[1:40:26] just a short clip he said now if if
[1:40:29] Israel laid down their weapon now if
[1:40:30] hamus laid down their weapons there'd be
[1:40:32] peace if Israel laid down their weapons
[1:40:34] there'd be a holocaust
[1:40:36] again right and people are saying you
[1:40:38] got to make peace you got to make peace
[1:40:40] in the natural they can't because the
[1:40:43] enemy will just keep taking and taking
[1:40:45] and taking and in the spiritual we can't
[1:40:47] make peace with the devil cuz he'll just
[1:40:50] take and take and take and put out your
[1:40:53] eyes you can't see the promises no more
[1:40:55] and take the power of God out of your
[1:40:57] life that you can't overcome anymore and
[1:41:00] make you a laughing
[1:41:01] stalk because you got to realize before
[1:41:04] he revealed his secret to her he
[1:41:07] overcame whatever she tried to bind him
[1:41:09] in yeah right so certain trouble came in
[1:41:12] the power of God Came Upon him loosed
[1:41:13] him from that trial you know something
[1:41:15] else happened loosed them right but then
[1:41:18] when he actually surrendered to her
[1:41:22] manipulation and we know the devil
[1:41:24] bobbed off his Covenant cut off his hair
[1:41:28] just like a woman as a Nazarite that's a
[1:41:29] sign of a Nazarite separated woman unto
[1:41:31] the Lord see you got to ask a question
[1:41:33] you take Christine's testimony of of why
[1:41:35] she didn't cut her here the anointing
[1:41:37] that came down that that preserved her
[1:41:39] life not once but twice what good would
[1:41:41] have been done to her if she cut her
[1:41:43] here and that man came in with a knife
[1:41:45] in the shop or or or stole the knife out
[1:41:47] of the shop she would have been dead she
[1:41:48] wouldn't be here right now I would not
[1:41:49] be married we would not have children
[1:41:51] right and what good would it have been
[1:41:53] if that pressure kept coming after that
[1:41:55] first testimony and she said well I'm
[1:41:57] just going to cut it anyway and this
[1:41:59] she's walking through the park that man
[1:42:00] with the four men and the dog she she
[1:42:03] probably wouldn't have be here anymore
[1:42:04] but because she stayed under that
[1:42:06] Covenant with God because she saw the
[1:42:08] angel showed her 1 Corinthians 11 saying
[1:42:10] this is why amen there's Angelic
[1:42:13] protection that whenever the enemy came
[1:42:15] along the enemy Was Defeated I mean when
[1:42:17] the enemy came to take her life he he
[1:42:19] couldn't touch her doesn't matter the
[1:42:21] circumstances that were facing her
[1:42:23] couldn't touch her so you got to realize
[1:42:24] it's the same thing all of us are under
[1:42:26] a covenant with God we cannot let the
[1:42:29] pressure of the world get too much that
[1:42:31] we'll cut off that promise amen we got
[1:42:33] to keep the promise cuz God will anoint
[1:42:35] that promise amen and come on the scene
[1:42:38] when when we even think it's
[1:42:41] impossible Hallelujah but you see now he
[1:42:44] Samson surrendered told her his secret
[1:42:48] and he didn't even realize the spirit of
[1:42:50] God Departed from him he wasn't even
[1:42:53] conscious that the Lord had gone and
[1:42:56] then when she said you know the
[1:42:57] Philistines are upon me he said I'm just
[1:42:59] going to do it like you I'm just going
[1:43:00] to free myself like before God's going
[1:43:02] to come down he's going to
[1:43:03] supernaturally deliver whatever more
[1:43:05] they didn't even realize that Spirit was
[1:43:08] gone he left his position of
[1:43:12] separation and look what it cost
[1:43:15] him look what it cost him he couldn't
[1:43:18] free himself so you got to realize that
[1:43:20] out the Lord Jesus is the
[1:43:23] Overcomer but yet he don't play games
[1:43:26] you know if we you know that's why the
[1:43:29] Bible says don't grieve the Holy Ghost
[1:43:30] whereby your seal to the day of your
[1:43:32] Redemption he'll just take his flight up
[1:43:34] into the rafters and he knows the
[1:43:36] condition that we need to get into
[1:43:38] repent wow right just like Samson he
[1:43:41] didn't lose the Covenant
[1:43:43] permanently but he lost it for a season
[1:43:46] cuz he had to come to a point where he
[1:43:48] said once more Lord where the death the
[1:43:51] self that he should have done in the
[1:43:53] beginning not just give his strength to
[1:43:55] God but his heart to God give his whole
[1:43:56] being to him which he should have done
[1:43:58] in the beginning he came to a point just
[1:44:00] once more Lord I'm willing to die with
[1:44:02] my enemy I don't care what this cost me
[1:44:04] I want to be restored cuz he felt those
[1:44:07] he felt that Covenant grow back in his
[1:44:08] life of those locks amen he felt and
[1:44:11] then he didn't even know if God would do
[1:44:12] it but he just called onto God once more
[1:44:14] and I believe it wasn't like a drama
[1:44:16] that you see pushes like this he just he
[1:44:18] just would have gone like this and they
[1:44:20] would have fell like a bunch of toys toy
[1:44:23] blocks amen but you see he when he came
[1:44:25] to that point just once more amen
[1:44:29] God came on the scene again so if Samson
[1:44:33] stayed in his position the whole
[1:44:36] time what could he have done what could
[1:44:39] he have done he killed more in his death
[1:44:40] in his life sure but what could he have
[1:44:42] done in his life now what about you and
[1:44:44] I maybe I'm just going
[1:44:47] to maybe just going to wrap it up there
[1:44:51] now I want to come to one more thing
[1:44:54] come to one more
[1:44:56] thing someone who's separated to God the
[1:44:59] word of God can flow through them if
[1:45:01] Samson St stayed separated to the Lord
[1:45:04] that word could have continued to flow
[1:45:06] through his life but he cut off that
[1:45:08] Covenant that's why you got to if you
[1:45:09] backslide you got to repent and come
[1:45:11] back to God you got to repent brother BR
[1:45:13] say it's even harder to repent and come
[1:45:15] back to your backl than when you first
[1:45:17] come that's what he said but you got to
[1:45:19] you you got to be willing to die out to
[1:45:20] those things amen see the Christian
[1:45:22] that's separated from the caral things
[1:45:24] of the world living in Christ Jesus
[1:45:25] where the word can flow through them
[1:45:28] amen a kind see a real believer is worth
[1:45:30] more than a 100 caral Believers amen
[1:45:32] he's comparing lot to Abraham but hey
[1:45:34] lot was still part of the program amen
[1:45:36] because of God's grace right but you see
[1:45:38] now we have we have
[1:45:43] the you say well okay I'm going to
[1:45:46] anyway I feel like I got a lot of hey
[1:45:48] but we're just going to wrap this up now
[1:45:50] people say but there's no all these
[1:45:53] things you believe are just added to the
[1:45:55] Bible yeah it's just an extra thing it's
[1:45:58] just adding to the word no it is the
[1:46:00] Bible right someone asked me a couple of
[1:46:03] weeks ago someone who's an alcoholic
[1:46:05] said to me you know oh yeah I know why
[1:46:07] brother Braham said that you shouldn't
[1:46:09] shouldn't drink and we and we've
[1:46:11] discussed it before he he was saying
[1:46:13] basically it's because of his upbringing
[1:46:15] because of what he saw when he was
[1:46:16] growing up you know packing the water to
[1:46:18] the still seeing drunk drunk woman and
[1:46:21] all these different things parting with
[1:46:22] men they shouldn't have been all that
[1:46:23] stuff that's the reason he preached
[1:46:24] against drinking I said no the Bible
[1:46:27] says a drunker will not enter into
[1:46:29] heaven so it's not oh brother braham's
[1:46:31] opinion it's the scripture right and all
[1:46:34] the things we believe are in the word we
[1:46:37] do not have like the Mormons another
[1:46:38] testimony of Jesus Christ no it is the
[1:46:41] testimony of Jesus Christ it is the
[1:46:43] Bible right and so now that's where God
[1:46:45] wants us to stay is in his word just
[1:46:49] like someone would say to brother br he
[1:46:50] says see a lovely person the other night
[1:46:52] talked to me come put out their arms
[1:46:53] around me said brother Braham I want to
[1:46:55] ask you something said if you just
[1:46:57] compromise a little this stuff that
[1:46:58] you're talking about I said what said
[1:47:00] all this baptism the churches of Chicago
[1:47:03] and all around us want you so bad but
[1:47:05] they're afraid you'll mention I said
[1:47:07] sure I'll mention it certainly I'll
[1:47:08] mention it well that's not the only
[1:47:10] thing they got against you I said then
[1:47:12] they're not um then they're not got
[1:47:15] against me pardon me I wasn't the one
[1:47:17] that said it God said it okay I
[1:47:19] challenge any of to come prove it wrong
[1:47:21] see said while you come you ought to
[1:47:24] agree and make Fellowship that's the
[1:47:26] same thing they wanted to do to him amen
[1:47:28] God don't compromise no sir he doesn't
[1:47:30] compromise he said now brother BR I want
[1:47:31] to ask you something did the angel of
[1:47:33] the Lord said we all believe the angel
[1:47:35] of the Lord did the angel of the Lord
[1:47:36] tell you this I said I don't care what
[1:47:39] the angel of the Lord would say if the
[1:47:41] angel Lord if he will say that but if he
[1:47:43] said something contrary he wasn't the
[1:47:45] angel of the Lord am mean I said
[1:47:48] regardless of what Angel anything said
[1:47:49] Paul said though an angel from heaven
[1:47:51] preach any other gospel to you let him
[1:47:53] be a cursed amen so these people were
[1:47:56] looking for a supernatural being to come
[1:47:57] and confirm the word did he say it if he
[1:47:59] said it I'll believe it but brother said
[1:48:01] if that angel said anything contrary to
[1:48:03] this written word forget it it's not the
[1:48:06] angel of the Lord you see but people
[1:48:08] will go after Fantastics all the time
[1:48:10] but we're going to stay in the word cuz
[1:48:13] this is our covenant with God Amen see
[1:48:16] but God backs up his word it's his word
[1:48:18] I said it's the word of the Lord sure
[1:48:20] all I ever know was taught to me by him
[1:48:22] I never went to a seminary or school
[1:48:24] that comes from him but I said whether
[1:48:26] it's contrary if it's contrary to that I
[1:48:28] wouldn't believe him because that's
[1:48:29] God's word first everything else be a
[1:48:31] lie God's word stay with it amen so the
[1:48:35] things we believe they are they are not
[1:48:38] added to the scripture this message is
[1:48:40] not another gospel it is the gospel of
[1:48:42] the Bible amen restored back in power
[1:48:45] and in truth amen hallelujah that's
[1:48:48] right so what should we do should we be
[1:48:50] all caught up with what everyone else is
[1:48:52] doing no Peter wanted to be caught up
[1:48:55] with what would happen to the man who
[1:48:56] who who who would not taste death but
[1:48:58] would see the coming of the
[1:49:00] Lord and Jesus saith unto him if I will
[1:49:04] that he T till I come but what is it to
[1:49:05] thee follow thou
[1:49:07] me all these things going on people
[1:49:09] doing different things what is it to
[1:49:10] thee follow him you want to help those
[1:49:13] people follow the word amen you want to
[1:49:16] see God intercede or God help those
[1:49:18] people follow the lord walk with him
[1:49:21] don't follow lot down to Sodom and try
[1:49:22] and get him out no let God you stay in
[1:49:25] your position and you watch the
[1:49:27] miraculous come into action amen it's
[1:49:29] absolutely essential we stay in our God
[1:49:32] given position don't be like Samson
[1:49:34] putting it putting your head on the lap
[1:49:36] of the world Amen don't be like that
[1:49:38] amen stay like Abraham Hallelujah this
[1:49:42] is what we're called to
[1:49:45] friends the Lord has made a difference
[1:49:47] between the world and the believer amen
[1:49:50] and it's because of the
[1:49:52] blood aren't you glad the blood can be
[1:49:54] applied aren't you glad the Holy Ghost
[1:49:56] can come in then now you are a walking
[1:49:58] billboard of God's Saving Grace he's
[1:50:00] called you to a high and holy calling
[1:50:03] and remember he doesn't call you to it
[1:50:05] to make you work it out yourself he lead
[1:50:06] you to that position amen so just keep
[1:50:09] walking with God don't be caught up in
[1:50:11] what everyone else is doing what is it
[1:50:13] to thee follow thou me amen what's going
[1:50:16] to happen to that what is it to thee
[1:50:18] follow thou me and let God come on the
[1:50:21] scene amen let's just finish there let's
