foreign foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] God bless you everyone welcome here this evening it's a great privilege to see all of your smiling faces here just before we get started and before the power of God moves upon this place in a powerful way we just have to run through a few formalities so this is one of the cap facilitators and she is going to take us through a few things about the camp so I'm going to give you that and I'll hand it over to you yeah I get the pleasure of all the boring stuff um just fire stuff in here um if there is an evacuation at camp and hopefully there won't be we had one two weeks ago so hopefully that was our first one in 50. hopefully it's another 50 before we get the next one but out on the field is where you go if you need to evacuate because of a fire or any other thing that you need to evacuate for um just be aware of the fact that the lake is not a great place for swimming so if you want to swim it's the swimming pool um yes I've noticed everyone's been really you guys that have been on Colleen for following that rule the tire swing is four people if you are needing to use the laundry while you're here at the weekend and there is an ironing board and iron and the laundry it's next to the A-frame building kind of opposite the tire swing in the playground um one of the washing machines works with a two dollar coin the other one you'll need to find me in the office to get a little token that will work it that's the one that's in the corner and also the dryer needs a token um [Music] um what else oh that one um [Music] it's still feeding back um most that around if you're in The Roundhouse building upstairs is actually really only a fire escape it's not um something that you want to race around if people open their Windows they become a danger and people can hurt themselves on them so there's something there and be aware of where the fire exits are when you're in the buildings and here there are some behind the curtains here which someone will flick open if you needed to get out and over there when you're in the dining room there are three different exits that you can use there and if you've got any hassles over the weekend just um find bean and he can get a hold of me or I do have the camp phone number and there is um on the sign outside the office there's a number there but yeah the basic things you need to know is just where to go in an emergency um your kids will all know what to do on an earthquake what are you going to do drop cover hold um not not initially maybe it depends where you are you want to um stay away from glass and so if you can be near a wall um and then unfortunately with those things they just make it up as you go along but we'll be around if anything like that happens um we've never had anything fall down yet so that's pretty cool um yeah and you've got any questions just contact one of the organizers and they can contact me um [Applause] thank you I am now going to call up brother Cuban [Music] good evening Saints lovely to see all of you big smiles everyone happy to be here praise the Lord uh this weekend set aside for some great things so if you come expecting the harder you pull the more you're going to get so don't feel shy I saw brother Marvin where are you walking in with the crutches brother claim it this is the week for

make sure that we're sleeping in the right dorms young brothers and sisters that are staying up late to play games sitting in the um dining hall and fellowshipping that's all welcome but we don't want anyone straying off and going in the dark the places a bit unsafe around the lake so we just want to stay within the confines of of the of the grounds that we're using just to keep everyone safe in the mornings every morning we're going to have a prayer meeting that's going to be held in the old chapel if you're not early we'd love to see you the more the merrier if we come prepared and we come

than the clouds there's no kitchen duties Amen to that I no washing of dishes the only thing we ask is when you finish with your plate put your plate into the right area and your cups and your knives and forks and everything else will be done there's no no one to be allowed in the kitchen unless you are asked to come to assist but that's going to be very rare it's going to be like hence teeth

have any dietary requirements anything that you didn't bring up please speak to Brother Andy or sister Bronwyn and they will take care of that for you if you left any song items any specials and and this is the the hardest box to fall now you'll be quick to come to brother Isaac that's behind me and put your name down so you can get a slot it's filling up very fast so if you see him straight after this service will put you in [Music] I just see my my good pastor walks up the back uh Pastor Ben if you could stand up please that's my pasta amen [Applause] you made it so good to have you I think that's about all for the for the formalities oh the sorry one more one more this is this is a hard one for you guys so the toilets that we have in the back are for moms or ladies and children under five or boys under five I'll say but boys over five dads are going to take them across across the bridge that you came in and to your right hand side there's a men's toilet so boys over five and Men please use the toilet from the outside of the facility we leave this for the ladies um yeah it's unfortunate that they we the tall is quite small so therefore we're splitting this please forgive us for that um maybe we'll make it up the next time there's talk about building more toilet facilities um yes I just want to say welcome again and God bless you all and have a wonderful time amen I'll follow brother Ed brother Ed's going to open up in prayer for us [Music] God bless you all most important we need to invite our maker our friend Our Redeemer our lover the one that's broken off all the chains made us a way let's walk this walk now as brother kibin said let's go a little higher if you can close your eyes and Empower your hearts oh Lord it's such an honor to stand here among precious friends brothers sisters Lord that's pulling in this right in the same channel Lords is coming from so far to come and give their little light Lord to come be a part of something magnificent something that will never be be able to repeat it Lord we invite you to come Lord to make all this happen Lord it is not the decor it's not the people Lord we are here for one one thing only Lord that you can come down you sup with us Lord you sit Lord you come close to us so we can hear Lord your gentle whisper Lord revealing the secrets Lord that you have for us Lord we pray that you speak with every heart as as my sons pray through this through this weak Lord they they ask that not one heart will leave here unchanged Lord and we we are praying not only for these people sitting in here but we pray for the Blessed hand that's that's keeping this Campground running so that we can come back Lord and if I can say in my own words [Music] um Lord may they give themselves Lord in everything and every aspect Lord every corner nook and cranny of that heart Lord we we had that spiritual census Lord that can also be surrendered not only this physical vessel Lord but come in and and work within that spiritual realm Lord I pray for the take team I pray for the music musicians Lord that everything run according to your Sovereign will Lord may we walk this walk and may every step every day just be closer and closer to you and Lord if if we don't even make it to Sunday praise the almighty God lord when we come and you take us home Lord that is we are waiting for that day and we miss you my Lord I pray that you be with every heart I pray for safety Lord I pray that you be with the kids as well your aim my your angels just be a camp around this this little facility Lord in our peripheral because we can't be everywhere and watch everything Lord be just there for us as well and have that have that Sovereign Grace upon us we pray you open up now the hearts and let the expectation rise and Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord foreign God bless you everyone it's so good to be here this evening you can um you can stand let's let's kind of get let's get warmed up I had on my heart to bless you from the Lord because I believe we serve a good God we serve a god of love we serve a God that doesn't have any ill feeling or animosity in his heart at all towards us at all it's all just love and it's all to build us up to enrich us that's the god that we're approaching and that is here amongst us this evening and there's going to be a great atmosphere of love and an outpouring of the Holy Ghost upon every service when we're fellowshipping outside when we're in here when we're out in the in the hall in the park anywhere we are the Holy Ghost is going to move in a powerful way in these services and God wants to bless us abundantly and we believe that we are Sons and Daughters of God and I believe that I'm speaking and looking at Sons and Daughters of God this evening that's who you all are and if anything tells you otherwise it's a lie it's not true you're all Sons and Daughters of God and it's by the Divine Purpose of almighty God that you're here this evening it's not by an accident but God wants to bless each and every one of you in a powerful way you're going to leave this place changed anything you need of you're going to receive at these meetings and and I want to say this we believe that we are Sons and Daughters of God sometimes when we speak we speak as a as a man or a woman whatever we we are and yet other times we speak we speak as if it's the Oracles of God as if we're actually the mouthpiece of God you know Jesus when he was here he is at one point he whipped he whipped like a man but then when he said Lazarus come forth that was God speaking and if you if I could be so bold as to speak a blessing upon you this evening and it comes from Ephesians but I'm going to paraphrase it like it's like the Lord speaking to you because it's all for us when Paul says I would desire that God would do this for you it's like God's saying I want to do this to you so this is Ephesians 3 17. to 20 and it says I this is a rainbow receives this from the Lord to you I dwell in your hearts by faith and you will be rooted and grounded in love and you will be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and you will know my love which passes knowledge and you will be filled with all the fullness of God because I am able to do exceeding abundantly above all that you ask or think according to my power that works in you and you will say I receive it praise the Lord turn around and greet your brethren say hello and let's praise the Lord this evening amen [Music] God bless you

amen I just want to read one uh one scripture it says here and we know that all things work together for good for them that love God to them that are called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he did also he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified amen you said it we believe it that is done and you're gonna believe he's already done it for you I mean not one day but now amen it is done it is done hallelujah what shall we say then to these things if God before us and make a person with God before me who can be against me what complex what pain what Spirit what indecisiveness whatever it may be what can be against you if God be for you Hallelujah you know we had a promise we had a tongue's interpretation in our first ever prayer meeting as a church this is over 10 years ago and the Lord said if you remain humble my word will continue to go forth from this place in my and I'll bring my people and they'll find rest and that rest is the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and I believe this is why we have these kind of meetings that if you need rest for your soul you can find it here in his presence Hallelujah whatever you have need of he's here to meet your need we believe he's here for Hallelujah I just want to say thank you so much for coming it's great to see your smiling faces you know I walked in here I was blown away by the place but it's so light and I believe it's because the presence of God is in his children amen so we're here you know welcome we have brother Chris Moritz from Canada coming to speak the word of God to us we never it's gonna be tremendous I'm excited I get emotional but I'm just excited because God can do anything he can do anything there's nothing impossible without God so I believe that you know he's bought a he's bought a surrendered vessel a gift for you across the sea to speak to you so whatever your need is I believe God can have a personal conversation with me for this whole service you believe that for yourself too so we love the Moritz family we love them for coming all this way so God bless you amen so let's sing um let's think I'm amazed that you love me as brother Chris comes but you know I there's such an atmosphere in this place already we don't do icebreakers here that's done we don't device Breakers we just have Jubilee time Hallelujah praise our god this is singer I'm amazed that you love me this is a brother Chris comes tonight amen are you amazed he loves you he washed all your sins away [Music] I'm Amazed that you love me I'm amazed how you care Through Your Precious Blood I found Garden and my sins are washed they're all washed away all my sins are washed away I'm amazing [Music] through your presence and my things they're all locked away all my things away one more time are you amazed and I'm amazed now you're not on me how you care through your preference [Music] amen let's give the Lord a hand clap tonight amen praise the Lord they never free he's washed our sins away amen you know God when he forgives when he washes our sins away he doesn't remember them you know we have this tendency to to pick up on them and you know and and remember them and you know we have scars we carry around but our God my brown sister when he's washed us when he sees us through the blood amen he sees us as a spotless virtuous woman amen and so we're thankful for that tonight that we can worship him we can praise him for what he has done I'm amazed at what he has done for me amen when when he could have picked so many people amen he picked you and me huh what a privilege we have to stand in his presence tonight amen so we just want to greet you tonight in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen we just are so thrilled to be here with you I'm just humbled to be standing here I thought maybe that um you know that brother Cadre and uh brother Ben made it back in time you know maybe I thought it was off the hook but but here we are amen but I trust you've come expecting to hear and you just pull through the vessel amen God knows how to speak he can use a donkey to speak he can surely use someone like me amen but it's our expectations amen our attitude amen do you believe the Lord Jesus Christ is here in our midst and why do you believe that because he said so whoever two or three are gathered Amen in his name there I am and their midst and he is here tonight I feel his presence here tonight I just so excited for what the Lord's going to do for us this weekend amen amen praise the Lord thank you musicians we're gonna go right into the word tonight uh speak on a little subject this evening of Breakout you know last time I was here uh we were just coming right into that covet season and it was quite a an interesting time a time that we have not seen before there was no manuals written for a time like that you know for for us as Believers we have not seen those things before and and yet all of a sudden you know somebody turned to switch and we had to isolate and we had to not gather any more in our churches so we see how quickly things can change you know overnight the whole world can be subdued by something and how God would allow those things and and I believe God has Has Lifted those restrictions for us so that we can gather like this again so you know we don't know if God's lifted them for just a season amen so that we can can come and gather and we can just finish do the fine final touches amen just a little finishing touches maybe there's a soul here that will be saved tonight we don't know but God's allowed us to gather like this to have the preaching of the word go forth for you to sit there and sit under the preaching of the word so you know we just want to say God whatever you want to do tonight amen have your way with us this evening and and so we just know it was a very surreal time every flight we took out of here was the last flight the flight we took out of New Zealand it was the last flight out of New Zealand you know so um it's just a real a privilege and a miracle if you think about it to be back here standing here preaching in New Zealand again and I know we've gone through a very interesting time a very dark time for a lot of people and Believers don't like to be isolated and separated we like Fellowship there's strength and fellowship amen as we feel here tonight so so we're happy that we can have this time together I was told this is a Labor Day weekend so I'm not sure that if we're allowed to work like this brother Ben you know but here we are but we're just laboring for the Lord tonight and you know I felt just right at home I had to give myself a pinch when our brother was praying in that uh in that Heavenly language amen God bless you brother you sure made me feel at home tonight and your brother praying in Africans it was not tongues it was it was every language of his own kind amen so amen we're going to turn in our Bibles to the book of Hebrews chapter 12. we just say hello from Canada yeah a little church there in in Alda Grove Living Word Fellowship we greet you they wanted to be sure that we extend our greetings to you just an extension of the family of God amen amen Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 1. and so this evening I want to speak on the subject of a breakout uh you know we have we have come to a place my brother and sister where we come to the very end of our dispensation the Gentile dispensation we're we're the last generation we're the last group of people you know we're making our way out of here there's a great Exodus coming up amen and uh one of these days we'll wake up and everything will change it'll be a different feeling in the air you know we'll just step from this Dimension into another dimension our bodies will be changed and so we we recognize that we just have you know maybe a week left or maybe we have a month left or maybe we have a year left that we don't know but we realize that we are still here for a reason and so we want to just focus on our on our own lives tonight and this evening I want to just encourage you in the word and if we can just look at our own lives and and say Lord what is it left that I need to be doing in my life Lord Lord I don't want to get caught up in an idea or some you know we get we can get caught up in church cultures and things you know we get caught up in family cultures or or pick up the spirit of our nation you know we can get caught up in all kinds of things or Instagram or being influenced by all these things but you know we're Eagles and we want to break out a little bit tonight and then we want to break into higher places and to do that we have to be able to recognize the condition that we're in amen that is that is so very important that you as an individual I as an individual I can look at myself and stand in the mirror of God's word and recognize the condition that I'm in amen and tonight I just want to be humble I want to say Lord if there's something in your word that doesn't please you know if there's something in my life that doesn't please you that doesn't reflect this word a hundred percent Lord help me tonight amen because I want I want to get out amen I want a body change so that's what really the thought is for this breakout tonight Hebrews 12 and 1. very well known scripture is very much for our time when we read these words here is literally penned for you and I it says wherefore seeing we are also compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and led us with patience run the race amen that is set before us verse two looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God Amen let's just bow our heads one more time and if you have just a need on your heart this evening just let it be known with an uplifted hand God sees every hand he sees beyond that hand he sees right to the heart of the matter tonight so just lift it with faith tonight and say Lord I have a need if you would speak to me through this weekend Lord I'm believing that you are here I recognize that you can answer that need our precious Heavenly Father Lord we just humble ourselves before you as we bow our heads to the dust of the Earth from Once We Come O Lord we know and recognize that you're our maker you're the author and finish of our faith oh God you raise us up for such a time as this Lord and so Lord we Look to You Lord we want to just sit us a little while around your table tonight Lord and have you break bread with us Lord as as Esther had those men come Lord and and and tell her exactly how the king liked it Lord and and his his likes and dislikes of Father we want to be dressed in your righteousness tonight so Lord we humble ourselves before you Lord that he would speak to us Lord your word would have an effect Upon Our Lives Lord Lord and you Penn down these words Lord because he knew there would be a people at the very end of the Gentile dispensation in the darkest time oh God Lord but yet a light Lord in our hearts oh Father and and we read these words and know that you had an uh a purpose in having them pen down Lord that there's a great cloud of witnesses oh Lord that we are running a race Lord that we are to set aside these things Lord that hinder us father tonight we ask that the the one Lord that panda those words Lord would Inspire us tonight Lord let those words have an effect Upon Us Lord let your Holy Spirit make these words live in our lives tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you may have your seats we we have seen many times as they would you know run races and and do relays and things like that you know you don't see the the runners preparing at the starting lines you know with backpacks and and you know loading up themselves and you know they're gonna you know they got their hiking boots on and you know they got all this gear on though that's not what race Runners do right no race Runners they shed as much as they can shed you know even the food that they eat they eat very specific food because because they know that they don't want any excess weight amen they want they want to have just exactly what they have need of for the race and and so we see how that Paul was admonishing the church let us lay aside every weight in other words he was recognizing that there was there were certain weights being attached to our lives and my brother and sister this these can be you know anything from emotional things to complexes you know you can see somebody who comes to church and they're joyful they're excited you know and they're happy to sing praises and then as the time goes by you see that they're not as happy as they used to be and you know what's happened is that a bomb went off in their lives a spiritual you know disaster something happened or maybe they were disappointed in someone or something or you know maybe they didn't have their hands Shake but you know something happened and in their mind it was a great thing and and so it affects the way that they live and that becomes a weight to their worship it becomes a way to their walk with the Lord and you know they're not growing as they used to grow and you know the devil is very good at these things I want to tell you tonight the devil is very subtle these very Sly he's very smart this is his this is his craft he knows how to add little weights on and you know sometimes you don't even realize that he is hanging little weights onto you you know it's like we were fishing out on the Fraser River and and we just throw these lines out you know we don't even have to put a lure on the end of that line you just put a hook out there and that and then you put a weight on there and you just let it bounce along the riverbank like that you know because eventually those salmon are going to swim up River there because they they need to go up that river to spawn and so you know but they're gonna eventually get tangled up in these hooks you know so even that you know the devil knows sometimes you don't even need a lure you know you just throw a line out there because they're gonna pass by this way and you know sometimes we pass by somewhere and we hear music or we hear this thing or or that thing and before you know it we're falling into that trap again and you know and if we're not careful you know we'll find ourselves in a place where we're beating ourselves up and saying I'm not worthy and you know and and so forth but my brother and sister once you are saved by the blood of Jesus Christ once you're sealed into the kingdom amen with your seal until the day of your Redemption and we need to remind ourselves of that but yet we make mistakes yet we carry scars in our lives and yet we go through things in our life that hinder our walk with the Lord but I want to tell you tonight that God has made a way of Escape for us amen you haven't lost your salvation but what he has done is he's telling you that by his holy spirit he'll make he'll make a way for you amen you can stand up again I mean that's why that's why we're soldiers you know this is not a flowery bed of ease we're soldiers in a battle we are race Runners amen we're fighting something here right man God's given us the right tools and you know we expect to get a few scars along the way amen but it doesn't mean that we're defeated we get up again and we Face another day by the grace of God why because his mercies are new every morning oh my we can preach tonight amen hallelujah so to break out is that what I'm saying tonight is to break out we want to break out from our fears you know covert has brought a real cloud of fear you know everybody's watching someone if you notice that you know somebody had to cough over here you know whoa whoa hey you know it's instantly you know the devil has trained us right he he cultures us he trains us to see things a certain way and you know he might use Instagram so that he can train us to see things a certain way and you know it'll affect the way we are around one another and you know the way we we treat one another even you know maybe I'm not going to shake his hand today because I saw that you know you know I'm just being honest right but they they what are they doing they're training the way we think and if we're not careful this happens in our spiritual walk also things can happen in our lives that train us and it's before you know it you know you don't even want to go to a church anymore because of the things that have happened now let's see let's be honest huh amen but you know my brother and sister God is greater than all those things he's great in those things we have a right we have a righteous believer does the body of Christ to break out upon the promises of God break out upon our freedoms and break on upon the things that God has given to us amen amen we don't have to live under those things anymore so to break out is a violent and a forceful break from a restraining condition or situation this can be in your family you know maybe you grow up in an environment that that restrains you it just seems to suffocate you or hold you down you know in in military terms this is actually a a military military maneuver it means to escape you know a general might see that his army is going into a situation and and and they're gonna they're gonna walk right into a trap you know the Scouts have come back and said this is not a good situation you might think you you outnumber the enemy but I'm telling you we have seen more numbers and they're approaching and they're surrounded you and so that General will give a command and that command is is not like it's not a negative thing my brother and sister to break out it means to to force a way out of the situation it means to break left or break right or find a way out of the situation why because there's certain death if you keep going the way that you're going and see so it's to preserve life that he would give a command to break out oh my God it is to avoid capture in the interest of preserving life to redirect you know we could be going a certain way in our lives you know and and maybe you you know you start listening to certain music or watching certain movies and you know that starts there and then you then it starts to kind of get worse from there and and you know it just gets a little easier to do it the next time maybe it's smoking or drinking or whatever it may be you know you can fill in the blanks tonight but whatever those things are my brothers you find yourself going down a certain pathway and it but it might feel you know like you cannot get out of the situation you know because this flesh is so easily uh affected by those things it's so easily entertained you know it's you know because we get bored yeah yeah I know I know you know in its first world countries that we live in we get bored and we have idle idleness that sets in and you know those long rainy days you know we start to think you know and the mind starts to be idle and you start to go down a certain way of thinking and you know you start to read books or this or that and my grand sister before you know it you're wasting all your time away and you can find yourself on a down a certain uh path of Destruction you know like the prophet talks about marijuana can lead to from marijuana to cigarettes from cigarettes to hard drugs and he talks about all these things how the devil knows how to set the traps and before you know it you're in this trap and you don't know how to get out of it right because it's so tempting it it seems to just have a grip on you and you don't you feel ashamed to even maybe tell somebody and I want to tell you as a message believer we're not all perfect okay we just need to be honest with each other I mean we all need God in our lives amen it's Grace we need his love and we need to pray one for another don't ever think that you don't have a right to reach out to somebody and say hey I need help you know go to your pastor go to a deacon and say Hey listen I'm struggling with something you need to help me break out of here I'm not strong enough for this thing amen we we have each other for that reason so redirect amen fight back my brown sister I'll give you a scripture for that the Bible says resist the devil and he shall flee you have you have every right to fight against that thing you know I I have a right to be happy Satan I don't have to be under this this depression I don't have to be under this this feeling I don't have to be sick anymore amen I don't have to wait for those things I don't have to feel good I don't have to uh you know be dictated to about my emotions Satan I resist you the name of Jesus Christ amen you have a right you know this comes right out of the chapter of The Heroes of Faith and it focuses right down on us all eyes are on us there's a cloud of witnesses watching tonight the prophet says it like this that we are to break loose right from the message looking at the Unseen we are to break loose and lay aside every Fetter now so let us cast aside every unnecessary weight and the things that entangle us let us run a race looking away from all the distractions huh it's so easily distracted this day huh looking only unto Jesus Christ who brings our faith to a maturity and to a perfection amen so we are to realize tonight let's let's recognize what we're what we're dealing with we are to realize that we're in a battle this race that he's talking about it's a Warfare against the flesh it's a struggle between right and wrong it's life and death amen in Warfare people get weary and there are casualties and so the Bible encouraged us to do the following if we read down there in chapter 12 and verse 12 it says then wherefore lift up the hands which are hanging down and the feeble knees amen you know from the this is right after the chapter of the heroes of the faith and then it talks about us and we're running a race and laying aside all our Fetters and chains and and breaking loose from those things and then it says then go and lift up the hands amen lift up the hands which hang down and in the feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed it says follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fail in the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up may trouble you and thereby many be defiled oh my bitterness I want to encourage you tonight if you have a bad feeling or you have this off feeling and it's something you can't shake maybe somebody's wronged you or maybe it's something in your history whatever it may be tonight there's a root of bitterness you have a right to break free from that thing and the way we break free from that thing my brother and sister is you take that thing that's in your heart and you say Lord I'm not strong enough I don't want to carry this thing anymore it's hindering my walk with you Lord amen Lord I'm giving it to you tonight it's that simple just lay it on him cast your burdens upon Him amen because he cares for you amen he's stronger anyway amen so cast your burdens upon him tonight amen unless there be any fornicator he says or profane person as Esau as they saw who for one more soul of meat sold his Birthright for you know that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears what a warning yeah huh what a warning what what made Esau give up his Birthright he was hungry you know that doesn't sound like a big deal tonight you know we've all been fed well today man brother Ben and Sister Christine are incredible hosts we are we are fed up hey man we have been well taken care of Amen so tonight we don't necessarily you know we listen to that and we go wow that's really odd you know for Esau to say that but for Esau that was a real hiccup in his walk huh it became such an issue huh that it was that he would sell his Birthright for this you know either he didn't value the birthright or you know whatever the reasons may have been my brother and sister but something happened to Esau that it hindered him from seeing the value in that Birthright and was willing to sell it for just a moment of satisfaction you know and we think of the things we do maybe during the day we have to be so careful that we sell you know we we we can have these wonderful moments in God's presence we can walk with the god with God we can walk with a with a living God we can have experiences with him and he can heal us and and teach us all things in his kingdom and we can have all these wonderful things and the blessings of God and yet we sell it off for what huh yeah for what oh my so we see how important it is for us to be vigilant to be vigilant to be spiritually awake we need to be awake my brother and sister amen no matter how dark our situation may get we must remember that he's always with us Psalms 23 says yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me don't get our eyes off of those things because it will get dark life will get tough you know you'll get disappointed things will happen in a lot our walks and our lives where you know it hurts maybe I'm the only one tonight huh but we go through experiences and they hurt huh we get disappointed whether it's in our governments whether it's in food you know whatever it may be our vehicles you know we get in there one day and it doesn't start up like it's supposed to start up right you're disappointed you know things happen right you know spiritual walk these little things can happen but you know if we're not careful they can start to add up and cause us to be weary you know we can even be serving God and become weary and serving God weary and well doing right so we got to be careful then we don't get caught up in something that that brings us down and and lower and lower and lower and before you know it it's become a real bad situation where you need intervention you have a right to break out of those things I want to tell you a story of of the Battle of Stalingrad I don't know how many of you know the the Battle of of Stalingrad it was a major turning point in World War II and we find out that the German Army made a massive assault on the Soviet Union pressing in and they had that Blitzkrieg approach you know where they were moving in really quickly and and the Soviet Army had to back off and back up and back up and and you know I want you to start thinking now off this German Army it's the sixth Army and and remember six cents for the number of men right this flesh so this the sixth Army is pressing and pressing and man they're doing good right we're on enemy territory right and we're making our way to Moscow and you know we're doing great and you know we're going to win this thing and man we've got all the air support and and you know we are we're Invincible right and so what are they doing they're pressing towards Moscow and and right before they get to Moscow they get a command to turn down to Stalingrad so they they make their Maneuvers down into Stalingrad and you know now things are starting to get a little bit interesting because why Stalingrad are not Moscow well Stalingrad is a matter of pride right because Stalin was the leader of the Soviet Union at the time and so it was it was a matter of Pride you know this city was named the was named after the leader of the Soviet Union and you know so for for Hitler this became a matter of Pride I'm going to take his glorious City from him right and so we started to see all this carnality getting into this this thing because it wasn't a really as great a strategic Point as maybe Moscow would have been but anyway we see this Army moving down and everything's going great huh you know it's like it's like when he first become a Christian everything's going great you know man I'm just defeating the enemy on every front I have joy unspeakable and you know it's just great but then a change comes and the Lord says well we're going to move you this direction you know so anyway this Army moves down there and and it's a big change in command and all these things and and they start to press down into selling ground and the battle now goes beyond just military strategy you know it becomes it becomes this carnal thing between these two leaders and I want you to notice how this when this carnality sets into the strategy it affected everybody it wasn't just Hitler and Stalin who would be affected by this but it affected everybody everybody that was under the chain of command becomes affected by their carnal approach this would become be a significant defeat for for the Germans but it would cost them terrible casualties and as we move into this battle you can go read all the details for yourself if you're cared to do so you'll find a terrible thing started to happen and the casualties started to to rise on both sides and great loss of life and and people are starting to ask the question is this worth it is this battle really worth the cost and the Soviets forced the Germans into close quarter combat so now watch the Germans were doing great and everything was happening very quickly and they were moving in there had a great supply line behind them and and lots of ammunition but you see the Soviets were playing a trick right they had these guys figured out you know we can't we can't match them right on long range combat so what are we going to do we're going to draw them in so we're going to keep retreating keep retreating right just back up ever ever so little every ever so now and then right and make them think that they're winning so we're just going to keep backing out backing up and we're going to draw them right into close combat why do they do that so that the Germans can't use their advantage of air support against the enemy so now they've lost the advantage of air support they're not going to use the long-range guns anymore why because they're afraid they're going to hit their own guys so you see the enemy is drawing them in right he's he's playing this game with them now you see this very smart and so this Army the sixth Army is moving in and and now it's all it's becoming brutal the combat is close combat it starts to become really personal up in the face you know they said that those battles those skirmishes were fought in stairwells and in living rooms and in across the streets and in cafes and I mean it became really personal you know at this point you would think that the German commanders would start to realize we're losing our advantage we're too far deep into enemy territory here you see they've lost the edge on the on the on the attack but they didn't realize that a trap was being set you know the German Commander's name was man stain which is a man or a one who lives on Stony ground you know Mark 4 and 16 tells us that these are they likewise which are sown on Stony ground yeah who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness they're excited happy right but have no root in themselves in other words they don't allow that they have no way of allowing that that word to penetrate to the soul there's no good ground here so they endure for about a time see they they walk the walk for a while they go to church and church attendance is up Ty's paying is good you know all these things are wonderful But as time goes on it just kind of starts to fade yeah it says they endure for a Time afterward when Affliction or persecution arises for the words sake immediately they are offended interesting how this man's name is is the same he's in command of this Army think of this now moving in this battle isn't really a great a great strategic Advantage for them other than Pride so it's a carnal battle Yeah it's become a carnal thing a personal thing and yet he knows that the battle has changed it's gone from long range from him having the advantage to him being basically pulled into a trap close call to combat and on top of all that the Russian winter is setting in and the German Army was not prepared for it you know my brother sister we can find ourselves walking down this road sometimes you know it's we realize okay this is bad right this is not good this I shouldn't be here and then okay you know we'll just keep going for whatever reason you know I'm strong enough I'm gonna maybe I'll be in there to save somebody else or whatever it is and then you know even see the the snowflakes coming and you know the Winter's setting in and no I'm still strong enough for this even though you're not dressed for that you know that's why I say my brother and sister you know weekend weekend in our spiritual walks go through the same things you know we can get hurt and we go through the same things because the winter can set in in your spiritual walk right and you have a choice all the time my brother and sister and I say this With all sincerity all the while if you get hurt you have a choice on how you're going to receive or treat that hurt and I want to remind you that somebody bigger than you that can handle that hurt it's even bigger you know you might say well my heart you know my heart is so depressed I'm so hurt well the Bible tells us that God is bigger than our heart amen that's scriptural so I want to just show you by this let's carry on with the story here the Soviet Army now has become this massive counter assault they've got them right where they want them and in the meantime there's a secret maneuver taking place the Soviet Army is moving around the North the German Army is not aware of this at this point but see this is the master plan of the Soviet Army to bring them in close and box them in close quarter combat start picking them off Winter's coming the the picture is perfect for the Soviet Army this maneuver by the Soviet Army results in the German Army being cut off and surrounded almost 300 soldiers cut off from the supply from the supply line over and over the German Commander manstein was advised by his men that they should break out this becomes the very critical part of this story here so as this is happening they're noticing I mean the guys around manstein man stain by the way happens to be a Christian but you know he's he doesn't he he's he's following orders from Hitler right but his men around him they see what's going on you know this is bad this is bad on every front and they're telling him give the order to break off why are they telling him to break out to preserve life we're not going to win this fight here we need to break out to preserve life get away from here change the environment change the scene change the tactics amen like the prophet says right if you're going a certain way and you just keep falling you keep you keep making a certain mistake he says make a 180. he says do something different amen break out but Hitler tells them to hold on don't retreat right they tried everything they tried air drops to supply them but everything was failing until the German Commander was told even not to surrender at at all cost don't surrender Hitler even promotes the commit into the command him from Commander to field Marshall you know it's amazing how the devil can do that right you're failing your life is falling apart but he's patting you on the back huh you're gonna be okay you know we go to church miserable we go home miserable and and yet we're patting ourselves on the bat saying I can handle this I'm gonna be okay promoting ourselves oh my goodness look at the the mindset of this right so it reminds him also that field Marshals have never ever surrendered in the history of the German army right putting pressure on now right you know you're you you got this he doesn't have it but you know you've got this another Germany Army German Army has tried to help them but it was too late eventually they were forced into surrender you know 91 000 Germans were taken prisoner in this combat 91 000 you know it's even worse than that is that only 5 000 ever returned to Germany three thousand went in but only five thousand came out of there you see failure to break out cost them more than what they could ever have afforded what were their reasons that they weren't allowed to break out think of it tonight yeah what were the reasons what was so important that they would not break out stubbornness Pride you know because of them not breaking out severe issues with set in just look at these these issues that they had attrition lack of the right kind of food unrest brother Ben was talking about arrest for our souls but you know these guys they couldn't sleep because the Soviets would come in with medieval style tactics and weapons and just just to scare them just to keep that chaos going so that they couldn't communicate properly and all these things and just keep them afraid keep them on the edge all the time always awake always worrying always panicking unrest instability confusion fear doubt and worries these are all the issues that come in with not breaking out you see the essential problem with not being able to break out is called this it's a loss of freedom of maneuverability yeah not having the freedom to move oh my if you if you're in a place tonight where you don't have that freedom to move you don't have that freedom to be joyful you don't have that freedom of your health whatever it is the devil's got you in a in a box somewhere I'm telling you give the command tonight call on the law call on the Lord tonight say Lord I want to break out tonight amen send the Angels down amen Hallelujah see it means to be stuck or to be cut off and to think that people would reason in their minds and think that they're okay you see don't blame other people for the position or condition that you're in you just start with yourself the prophet says it's in the message thirst he says the Revival ought to begin right in you how many here wants a Revival Amen Let it begin with you don't wait for the next person right don't wait to feel good don't wait for your emotions to catch up amen you have a right to have a Revival amen if you seek him you will find him if you're not gonna store he will open it unto you amen so you have a right to those things let the Revival begin in you and I want to encourage you tonight don't let the Revival be founded on emotions let the Revival be based on the word of God when you approach him my brother and sister say Lord you said if we believe on the Lord Jesus Christ die on our house shall be saved amen build your Revival your personal Revival build it on the word because I can never fail [Music] that'll never fail it'll never fall it will never give way my brother and sister start your Revival with a word oh my when you begin he says to thirst for God there might not be another member of the church wanting that Revival he says if it breaks out in you it'll break out in other places see but he says you know you neglect that thirst when you're thirsty go get a drink of water right we're thirsty you know we live in an age in a day where if we're thirsty man we we can reach out here go there go to Starbucks drive-throughs go to the grocery store you know we we feed ourselves when we're thirsty well spiritually if you're thirsty tonight don't neglect it break out don't upon the promises another quote for you the seed is not air with a shock 1965. he says don't be afraid to break out upon the promises of God don't be afraid to break out amen praise the Lord just tell you another little story here this evening you might say well how do I do that how do I break out what does this look like you see it doesn't matter if you're young or old God put something inside each and every one of us I don't want you to underestimate who you are yeah what God has placed inside of you amen you know it talks about that bird that is in that shell and if I could put a little egg here tonight and just place it right here on the pulpit you would look at that shell and you would be thinking well that's interesting you know it's not a very strong shell maybe you know if it's a if it's a chicken egg or something like that you know it's not very strong maybe but that shell has become a womb it's become an environment or it's become an atmosphere for something inside right and you know we might look at that and we could talk about that all day long about that environment that it's in if we could talk to the little uh you know animal that's on the inside you know we could ask it questions how is it in there oh it's nice and warm and cozy in here and you know and it feels good and man every day it's the same right just you know so consistent and you know it's great and but you know if it's if it wants to grow something needs to happen you know yes and sometimes we can be in our Christian walk my brother and sister and and we can we can end up in an environment like that where where it's like you know this is good I'm good up to this point I'm comfortable here right I'm comfortable and I can I can manage this you know I can manage my habits and I can manage my my church life and I can manage my friends and you know and kind of comfortable in my little shell it's warm here you know but you'll never grow so you have to recognize that you know you have to break out of that environment but you know you could come to that little bird and you know sometimes it feels like that maybe brother Ben can relate to that you can preach to that little bird in that shell you know hey A little birdie in there you need to come out of there you know and and you could tell it and all these things but you know that bird God has done something with that bird that in its instincts in its makeup that there's a season that'll be just right there will become a time when it's just right for its birth amen and so we as Ministry we just you know we bring the eggs to church so to speak they right we try and bring him into another atmosphere so they can hear hey there's something going on out there hey there's there's rejoicing there's Victory you know they they talk about all kinds of colors of trees and you know things I've never seen before in this environment but I want to know what they're talking about that's that's out there in that other environment you see so there's a there's a deep that's calling to a deep now right it starts to come into another place and see maybe flashes of light and and maybe it can feel you know the mother come and sit over the egg and know that there's something much bigger than itself out there you know that there's there's a desire now to grow you know but it's amazing how that it is here's here's what's really important this is what I really want to stress tonight it's so important that that little chick breaks out of that egg on his own now you might say brother Chris that that's cruel that's really cruel you know because that that's that's hard you know that's that's a hard thing for that little bird to do this little neck and it's this little Beacon oh poor little thing right it's cruel it's it's messy it's gonna be a hard thing to do and how does he know where to Peck and and what to do in there right oh my brother and sister we can rely on God for these things God God put an instinct he put something inside that little bird right that knows what to do and he and he made his beat just the right kind of tip you know and the right kind of strength and the right kind of everything and we can just have faith in God that those things will work amen you know in our own lives he says greater is he that is in you so whatever situation we find ourselves in he knows what he made us off amen he knows what material we have inside of us he knows the instincts that we have like Esther said I was made for such a time as this huh God had complete confidence in Esther he had complete confidence in Moses and all the characters of the Bibles the heroes of the faith that we read about because he put something inside of them and he knew at the right season at the right time they themselves would be able to Peck through that little shell to break out upon the promises of God you know there was denominational shells huh come on my brother sister denominational shelves you know but God knew that there would be a voice there would be an eagle flying overhead amen and that they're deep calling to a deep and there would be something inside that little egg amen a little life that needed to be birthed something had to come forth amen but God had confidence that the way he made that little bird he's the author and finisher of our faith he had complete confidence and what I'm saying tonight is for each and every one of us wherever we are in our walks of life wherever we uh find ourselves this evening God knows that you can make it amen he knows you're made of the right stuff huh you know we sometimes we come to church and we say oh if he can just preach just the right sermon or if I can get just the right kind of feeling down my spine or just the right kind of song service and all the music was too fast or it was too slow or you know we start to get into that realm well it's not about those things it's it's that was a distraction sometimes amen it's about what God has done in here and here you can recognize God you made me you're my maker you knew every complex I would have you you knew the environment I would be born into you know the family traits I would have but God you made me and you made me strong enough by your Holy Spirit to break out upon the promises of God you are strong enough tonight why do you think he told Joshua be thou only very courageous and strong don't fear don't don't despair don't don't dismay for the Lord that God is with thee wherever thou God oh my I'm feeling good tonight amen the prophet says it like this in the message once more he says oh I think now to be conscious of the spirit that is near us he says that light he says let's break out of the shell of the hour break out of the shell of the hour we're living in and the time and be conscious of the spirit of God that is now Among Us oh my we just take a moment and just think about that you know I don't know maybe your reasons for coming to camp why you're here or maybe what you're feeling or thinking just right now but can you just for a moment just break out of those things and if we can become conscious of his his presence that is right here tonight right here right amongst us just break out of the Fashions the Hollywoods the cares of this life our finances just break out long enough to to hear and speak to hear him touch somebody to have a move in our lives just become still long enough say Lord move upon my situation Prophet says it like this he says oh there's people today it's just like this a man dying on the doorsteps of a doctor's office when that doctor in the building has the cure for his disease but he refuses to take it if the man has a disease and the doctor is secure for it and the man may lay on the doctor's doorsteps he says but if he refuses to take his medicine he will die right there on the doorstep you can't blame the doctor the doctor would give him the medicine that would cure him if he'd only come and take it but it isn't the doctor's fault he's got the remedy but the man's too stubborn to take it then whose fault is it [Music] so it is today he says that many people die in front of the church on the steps in the pews die in their sins because they refuse to accept God's bonds that is in Gilead it's not worth it I just want to tell you tonight it's not worth it whatever trick the devil's playing on you whatever happens he's got you fixed in whatever's going on in your life I want to tell you tonight it's not worth it it's not worth it the devil's it's got you in a trap amen and there's Messengers that come by your way and telling you you're going to die here that you got to stop this battle this battle is going nowhere this this course of action you've taken it's taking you nowhere it's only going to end up in misery you're going to end up without Friends The Devil is a destroyer a deceiver and a liar break out of your situation and then you can be sitting in church pews and feeling good about yourself and all those things and living whatever kind of a life there's going to come a day my brother and sister where you're not going to be able to do that anymore break out of it you're strong enough to break out of it tonight you know what you do is just maybe raise a hand huh just raise a little hand tonight say Lord I'm breaking out I want to break out I was I'm an eagle I'm not a chicken I'm an eagle I'm made to soar up there in the Heavenly not to be Earthbound and caught up here in the Affairs of this world and so forth I made an eagle I want to be up there in the heaven leaf I wanna I want my wings to be spread out tonight and maybe just flutter my wings a little bit and feel the the faith building up remember that eagle and maybe I'll just close with this musicians can come but you remember that eagle that was there and the prophet was there and the squirrel was there and we get that scene you know that eagle was sitting there and watching the scene in the presence of the Prophet there you know this beautiful bird and hear the squirrel or chipmunk is going at it you know right just going crazy right Instagram and whatever else false news and you know all kinds of doctors reports and whatever it may be you know the cares of life just just going at it 100 miles an hour and you know that eagle is caught up in that atmosphere and their brother Branham is a hunter right and his gun is laying right there on the side and here this Eagle finds himself in this situation there's a hunter and the rifles right over here but he wasn't afraid see he he wasn't caught up in the environment because it comes from another environment my brother we are now living in Heavenly places even though we are caught up in this place and we have to live here and we have to work here and do these things but we are spiritually in Heavenly places see we are actually in a Rapture age a bright age we're actually in a whole another atmosphere where the Devil comes by our way we have the word for those things amen that's how we press forward that's how we break out is you just keep speaking the word just like Moses did you're right I've commissioned you just speak the word and go forward not ego's sitting there and brother Brown says you know what what causes you to be that way huh I love this story because that's you and me you know he says what causes you to be that way I could grab my gun here and and so forth I'm a Hunter you know yeah that eagle wasn't afraid he just looked at him looked at the little chipmunk you know maybe just checking in on how things are going on down here you know just checking in on the signs of the times and you know just you know all the chatter cheddar chatter that's going to you know just because he's making ready for another kind of flight you know and the prophet says it like this he says I know why you're not afraid and I'm paraphrasing so forgive me but he says he says this phrase in there he says that eagle has has has something in him right he's built a certain way he has a power to take him from that atmosphere that environment to another atmosphere and he says that eagle just flexes his wings a little bit like this right just you know he's just and that's maybe what we're doing tonight we're just flexing our wings a little bit and he and he says it like this he says that ego is just checking making sure every feather is laying just right that's what we're doing tonight we're just checking up huh in this atmosphere tonight we're just we're just flexing our our wings a little bit amen we're just checking making sure that every feather is laying just right because we're going to take our flight one of these days anyway we're gonna break out of here amen praise the Lord that eagle knows that what God has done for him can take him out of that environment see God by his grace made him a certain way God by his grace gave him a certain eyesight he gave him a certain instincts he gave him a set of wings and in a moment that eagle can transport himself out of that atmosphere see that is the gift we have that's the anointing that's upon this age and I'm so thankful my brother and sister because you know the cares of this life can get pretty heavy you know this covert thing has has changed people it's changed the way people live and it's changed our governments and you know it's taking that good feeling away huh but you know we don't have to live there we don't live on on the whims of our of of this world we are we are an eagle we're Eagles that change our atmosphere we live in Heavenly places even though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we don't fear no evil why because we are living in another atmosphere why because God has made a way of Escape where we can break out amen we can go and live in Heavenly places and while this world is going into chaos my brother and sister we don't have to live like them we don't have to fear like them amen we we have breaking out of those things and you know it came by a voice and the prophet said that that bride when she was marching out he saw that vision and he said she was getting out of line you know he gave a reason for why she was getting out of line he said they were watching the world go into chaos just watching the world go into chaos and it was causing her to step out of line and then he shouted and he said get back in line in other words break out right I'm thankful for a voice I I feel like that voice was was for right now get back in line you know the the token message [Music] what did he say we we do when we applied the token [Music] you know it was sometimes we have it so complicated and so you know but he says you create an atmosphere that's amazing in this day and age we live in the darkest age that we live in you mean God has put something inside of us that we can create another atmosphere we can live in another environment think about it but that's what's going to bring our loved ones in right he says you just create an atmosphere of love he says and they will come right in oh my but see we have to break out first we if we're not in an atmosphere if we're not living see and we can be living in our minds in our imaginations and all these things we can be living in some very dark places but it's not where you ought to be God has a better place for you tonight so I want to encourage you tonight break out of those things break out of Despair break out of depressions break out of fear break out of insecurities and complexes or habits you know how you do that you know he might say brother Chris I just can't seem to overcome this habit of mine next time it comes up you just say I resist you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you know what he might come back he might come back maybe next week you know because this weekend we're going to feel strong we're going to feel Faith rise up you know and then and then Tuesday comes and Wednesday comes and and he's back there he you know he doesn't pay attention he doesn't listen very good right but you keep telling him I resist you you might fall again even but you tell him Satan I resist you and you know the more you do that the stronger you're going to get and you feed on that word right Faith cometh by hearing see God's given us all the tools and they're not emotional things they are they are real things my brother and sister real things tangible things that God has given us like like David of old said Lord teach my hands to do war against the enemy he's taught us in our day how to do war against our enemy but let's use the tools he gave us the word amen gave us his word you can resist that devil you can fight against him you can the prophet said we can create worlds and go live on them by what we say what is that we can create another environment oh my God another environment I'm going to encourage
