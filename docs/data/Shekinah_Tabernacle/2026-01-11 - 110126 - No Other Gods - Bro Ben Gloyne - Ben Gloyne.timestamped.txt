[4:40] Good morning.
[4:42] Welcome to the house of God this
[4:43] morning.
[4:46] Good morning, brother
[4:54] I can walk. Look at this.
[4:58] Last week when I took my um I came
[5:00] without my moon and I could walk around
[5:02] a bit. I wanted to sing the song um
[5:07] name above all names because in the
[5:09] verse it says um you know the
[5:13] the deaf will hear. Then it says the
[5:14] lame will walk.
[5:17] And I think um Sister Stephanie started
[5:19] playing it after the service that we
[5:21] ended up playing it. And the first song
[5:23] I'm going to do this morning, which I
[5:25] didn't actually think about,
[5:27] it's a song called Jubilee. And I
[5:28] believe the chorus says that when I
[5:30] heard the Jubilee, I walked free.
[5:33] So I'm going to walk free this morning.
[5:35] You know, it doesn't matter what doesn't
[5:37] matter what is upon us. If the word of
[5:40] God, if there's something in our life
[5:42] that's
[5:43] that we've been given something better
[5:45] according to the word of God, then we
[5:47] can walk into that,
[5:49] you know, like any promise of God that
[5:50] that is if we don't have it, we we are
[5:54] given authority to walk into that and to
[5:57] possess it. So yeah, if you if I want to
[6:00] encourage you all today and and in your
[6:02] life, if there's there's any don't don't
[6:05] be afraid to take God at his word and to
[6:08] step into any promise of God that you
[6:09] believe is for your life and for you and
[6:11] and don't let any complex hold you back
[6:13] or anything. There's a often thought
[6:16] about a sermon I wouldn't mind preaching
[6:17] one day and it's called don't take it to
[6:18] the grave because when you get when
[6:20] you're young you you you look at older
[6:22] people when you're a little young fell
[6:24] and you think oh they've got it all
[6:25] together
[6:27] then you get older and you realize
[6:29] actually we don't have it all together
[6:30] and and and it's a scary thought when
[6:32] you see people that are young and you
[6:34] see them old and you see them the same
[6:35] if same sort of complex or something and
[6:37] then you start to realize okay that will
[6:39] be my lot unless I if I if I don't deal
[6:42] with something in my life it's It's not
[6:44] just going to go away. Like if it's a
[6:46] complex or something wrong or something
[6:47] I'm not possessing, it's not just going
[6:49] to somehow miraculously not be there.
[6:51] It's going to be there unless it's not
[6:54] there, unless it's gone. You know, and
[6:56] the reality dawned on me one day. I
[6:58] thought there's things I don't want to
[6:59] walk this whole walk and then take
[7:00] something to the grave. I know it's not.
[7:01] We're not talking about my my where I
[7:04] end up on the other side. I'll still end
[7:06] up there, but I don't just want to I
[7:07] don't want to have something in my life
[7:08] that I in my life that I take to the
[7:10] grave. And it was a powerful thought
[7:12] that I thought in myself. I thought, I'm
[7:14] not taking this thing to the grave. So,
[7:15] I started looking at my own life and
[7:16] looking at complexes and things that
[7:18] might hold me back. And I thought, I'm
[7:19] not taking one of them to the grave.
[7:21] They're not they they they're going to
[7:23] go to the grave now. And I'm going to
[7:25] live without it in my life. I'm not
[7:27] taking it to the grave. All I want to
[7:29] take to the grave with me are good
[7:30] things. I just want to be lay on my
[7:32] deathbed and have good thoughts and good
[7:34] things and not think, oh, I wish I had
[7:35] have gotten rid of this, wish I had done
[7:36] that. I lay on my deathbed and be happy.
[7:38] Say, I lived a full life. Like Paul
[7:40] said, I finished my course. I kept the
[7:42] faith. I want to be happy. I don't I'm
[7:44] not having any regrets on the at the
[7:47] end. Let's stand this morning and just
[7:49] commit the service to the Lord. Lord
[7:51] Jesus, we thank you, Lord, that in you
[7:53] all your promises are yan. Amen. Lord,
[7:55] that you came to set the captives free.
[7:57] Lord, the lame that they could walk, the
[7:59] blind, they could see, the lost, they'll
[8:00] be found. Lord, the sinner, they be made
[8:02] whole, the the sick are healed. Lord,
[8:04] the broken are restored, the families.
[8:07] Lord, we just thank you that we come to
[8:08] the almighty God this morning. the God
[8:10] of restoration, the God of hope, the God
[8:11] of peace, the God of life, Lord, the God
[8:14] of good things. So, we just pray you'll
[8:16] bless our service this morning, Lord.
[8:17] May faith rise in our midst, Lord, as we
[8:20] push back what just all are always lies
[8:23] of the enemy that would hinder us in
[8:25] some way. And we can we can sometimes
[8:27] take those lies and let them latch into
[8:28] our life and then it affects how we
[8:30] live. It affects our actions. It affects
[8:32] what we do. But Lord, we thank you that
[8:34] we can be free this morning, Lord. And
[8:36] we can let your spirit and your word
[8:37] come deep down into our heart, Lord, and
[8:39] and search us and try us, Lord. As David
[8:41] said, see if there be some wicked way in
[8:43] me, Lord. And if there's just the enemy
[8:45] loitering around in our in any part of
[8:47] our life, we want that to be exposed so
[8:48] we can we can walk, Lord, we can replace
[8:51] his lie with your word, with your truth,
[8:53] Lord, and walk in that, Lord. So, I
[8:54] would just pray a blessing upon each
[8:55] mind this morning, a blessing upon each
[8:57] heart, a blessing upon each spirit,
[8:59] Lord. May the Holy Ghost come and move
[9:00] in each each life and each heart here
[9:02] this morning. Bless brother Ben as he
[9:03] ministers your word, Lord. Lord, we're
[9:05] just expecting a great outpouring of the
[9:07] Holy Ghost this morning, Lord, as we
[9:08] come gathered in your name. And you said
[9:10] we're two or three together in your
[9:12] name. There you are in the midst, Lord.
[9:13] So, we just want to commit this um
[9:14] service to your hands in Jesus wonderful
[9:16] name. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[9:20] Give us a count, bro.
[9:27] Years
[9:34] and years I labored.
[9:38] Toil and tears were my me
[9:42] since my dad has took me prisoner.
[9:47] Sold me to slavery.
[9:52] But every day that I toil,
[9:57] the jubilee was drawing closer.
[10:01] The 49th year was the longest year.
[10:07] And then I heard the trumpet sound.
[10:10] And when I heard the jubilee, I walk
[10:15] free. I walk free. Oh yes, I walk free.
[10:20] When I heard the jubilee, I walk free
[10:25] and I going back to slavery
[10:30] because Jesus has set me free.
[10:38] Years are spent in confusion.
[10:43] I had eyes but couldn't see.
[10:47] The enemy had me stumbling in darkness,
[10:53] spiritual slavery.
[10:57] But then I heard the prophet speaking.
[11:02] I heard the voice behind the board.
[11:07] He opened up the word and let the light
[11:10] shine in.
[11:12] said, "You can all go free."
[11:16] Oh, when I heard the jubilee, I walk
[11:20] free. Oh yes, I walk free. I walk free.
[11:26] When I heard the jubilee, I walk free.
[11:31] And I going back to slavery
[11:36] because Jesus has set me free.
[11:43] But Jesus has set me free.
[11:49] Jesus has set me free.
[11:53] And he whom the son sets free.
[11:59] He is free. It Jesus has set me. Jesus
[12:05] has set me free.
[12:09] Jesus has set me free.
[12:14] And he whom the son sets free,
[12:19] he is free indeed.
[12:23] When I heard the truth, I walk free. Oh
[12:28] yes, I walk free.
[12:32] I walk free. When I heard that you
[12:36] believe I walk free and I go back to
[12:41] slavery
[12:43] because Jesus has set me free.
[12:50] When I heard when I heard that you
[12:55] are free. Oh yes I free.
[13:00] I want free. When I heard you believe I
[13:05] was free and I ain't going back to
[13:09] slavery
[13:12] because Jesus has set me free
[13:17] because Jesus has set me free.
[13:24] Amen.
[13:28] When I'm in need, call on the Lord
[13:33] and he heals me. Yes, he helps me. He is
[13:38] faithful
[13:40] and true. Won't forget his own.
[13:46] My companion,
[13:49] my best, the only true God. There's no
[13:53] one greater.
[13:55] Wonderful savior.
[13:58] Jesus the lion of Judah.
[14:02] How God how God is the man. His strength
[14:07] never fail.
[14:09] Go through the fire just to save a
[14:12] sinner. Yes, he is a mighty. He says he
[14:16] is angry
[14:19] to guide me.
[14:22] There is no song too powerful. Our God
[14:25] cannot handle how God in simplicity will
[14:29] be. You me came down from his glory gave
[14:34] us
[14:36] the greatest love story.
[14:41] When you're in trouble,
[14:43] Jehovah is the great forome
[14:48] as he owns. Fight your battle.
[14:53] Oh yes, he will stand for you.
[14:59] Your victory will come the way that you
[15:02] think it should. But my great Jehovah
[15:06] just loves a paradox to stay in your
[15:09] position. Watch the miraculous
[15:13] come into action.
[15:17] How God is the man. His strength never
[15:21] fail. He'll go through the fire just to
[15:24] save a sinner. Yes, he is a mighty.
[15:29] He sends his angel
[15:32] to guide me.
[15:35] There is no powerful act that God cannot
[15:39] handle. How God in simplicity
[15:43] reveal you and me came down from the
[15:46] glory and gave us the victory.
[15:50] Greatest love story.
[15:54] When you're in trouble,
[15:57] Jehovah is with great son as he only
[16:04] fight your battle.
[16:06] Oh yes, he will stand for you.
[16:14] You can't the way that you think it
[16:16] should. My great Jehovah
[16:20] just loves the paradox. Stay in your
[16:23] position and watch the miraculous
[16:27] come into action.
[16:30] Our God, our God is

[16:41] is a mighty

[16:46] to guide me.
[16:50] There is no something powerful that God
[16:53] cannot handle. That God in simplicity
[16:57] revealed to you and me. Came down from
[17:00] his glory and gave us
[17:04] the greatest love story. Came down from
[17:07] his glory.
[17:09] came down from his glory and gave us the
[17:12] ring. It's the greatest love story.
[17:29] For anyone who's ever seen a mountain of
[17:33] their sins, justice is here.
[17:40] For anyone who's ever felt the hand of
[17:43] heaven reach down through this
[17:48] and try
[17:51] any life that once was empty now finds
[17:54] itself alive and full of song
[17:58] victory song.
[18:01] Then you'll understand the reason for
[18:04] the way the saints of God may carry on.
[18:09] When I shout,
[18:12] when I shout, no, I'm shout from a heart
[18:16] that's been washed clean. When I run,
[18:19] know I'm running from a past that's been
[18:22] redeemed to the world my praise. There's
[18:26] just no telling what you're going to do.
[18:31] In that moment, Jesus gets a hold of
[18:35] you.
[18:39] For anyone who knows the hope, he keeps
[18:43] us moving on through pain.
[18:50] for anyone who knows they have a future
[18:54] and a hope beyond the grave.
[18:58] Every life's a different story. Every
[19:01] life's a different story. How he brought
[19:04] us out of darkness into light.
[19:11] No, there's no way to keep us silent.
[19:14] Every breath of a chance to testify.
[19:22] When I shout, I'll shout from a heart
[19:26] that's been clean. When I run, I'll run
[19:31] from a cross
[19:34] to the word of m.
[19:36] There's just no telling what you're
[19:39] going to do.
[19:41] In that moment, Jesus gets a hold of
[19:45] you.
[19:47] When I shout,
[19:49] oh when I shout, no I'm shouting from a
[19:53] heart that's been washed clean. When I
[19:56] run, know I'm running from a box that's
[19:59] been redeemed to the world might look
[20:03] crazy. There's just no telling what
[20:06] you're
[20:09] in that moment. Jesus gets old of you.
[20:15] My heart raised. My heart raised my
[20:21] name.
[20:22] Let's testify.
[20:25] Let's testify.
[20:28] Oh my.
[20:31] My name teaching. Let's testify.
[20:36] My race.
[20:39] Oh yes. My
[20:41] race my
[20:43] sh
[20:47] my
[20:49] race my
[20:52] race my
[20:54] sh
[20:58] when I
[21:00] when I
[21:05] was when I know I'm not my heart
[21:11] to the world.
[21:14] There's just no telling what you're
[21:17] going to do.
[21:19] In that moment, Jesus gets a hold of
[21:23] you.
[21:25] When I shout,
[21:28] when I shout, I'm sh from a heart that's
[21:32] been washed clean. When I run, now I'm
[21:35] running from a past that's been redeemed
[21:39] to the world. It might look crazy.
[21:42] There's just no telling what you're
[21:45] going to do.
[21:47] Oh, in that moment, Jesus gets a hold
[21:52] of you.
[21:55] And you can take your seats this
[21:56] morning. We have a testimony from um
[21:59] Sister Marian. if you could come up and
[22:01] if we could get her a microphone.
[22:14] God bless everyone. Um I'm really
[22:17] excited to share this testimony to all
[22:21] of you. Um um last month um we're we're
[22:27] a bit struggling with John's um job um
[22:32] because the um he's working as a soul
[22:36] trader nowadays and he's working with
[22:39] some of the roofing companies
[22:42] and the the machine that he's using is
[22:45] not on his own. So the one that the
[22:48] machines that he's using is taken away
[22:51] from him because there's no if there's
[22:54] no job with that company um he needs to
[22:57] return the machine and we tried to to to
[23:04] do something to have his own machine. We
[23:08] tried to have a um bank loan with on his
[23:12] name under his name but um he got
[23:15] declined. So we tried again to get an
[23:20] application under my name but I also got
[23:23] declined because they said I'm only
[23:26] casual at work. So um we feel
[23:31] frustrated, we feel stressed and I told
[23:35] m to him um just keep on praying. Maybe
[23:40] the Lord has his own way. And then new
[23:44] year came. We're still still praying
[23:48] that maybe God, he has his own way. And
[23:53] then last week um we got a call from one
[23:58] of um my son's friend and he said that
[24:03] his auntie wants to get his roof fixed.
[24:08] So we go there and he got the quotation
[24:12] and all and then he got the deal
[24:16] and then
[24:18] um um from last week as well
[24:23] um he got the partial payment for it. So
[24:28] he got the sort of money and then
[24:32] yesterday he also got another job with
[24:36] the with on his own and
[24:40] and we think that
[24:43] it's also um enough to buy his own
[24:46] machine. Not just one but two machines
[24:49] that he needs for his job. And I'm
[24:52] really really grateful to the Lord that
[24:56] he declined the bank loan that we tried
[24:59] to apply because this is on his way that
[25:04] oh you don't have to work to pay every
[25:07] week or monthly for the loan. I will
[25:09] give you the money that you need for his
[25:14] job. And that's I'm ve very very
[25:17] grateful to the Lord. And
[25:20] yeah, so he got his um he's able now to
[25:25] get his own machine. He don't have to
[25:27] worry to to borrow from another company.
[25:31] And that's all. Thank you so much.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. We just trust in
[25:44] the Lord. He always undertakes. Amen.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; Let's um let's stand this morning.
[25:50] Let's worship the Lord.
[26:01] Some say I call on my imaginary
[26:06] friend.
[26:10] When I call upon you, Jesus,
[26:15] some call me weak because I say that I'm
[26:19] not strong.
[26:24] And all my strength comes from Jesus.
[26:29] But Jesus, I
[26:32] I won't be ashamed.
[26:35] Take you by the hand.
[26:38] to take you by the hand.
[26:44] No, I
[26:46] I won't be ashamed
[26:49] to take you by the hand.
[26:53] To take you by the hand.
[26:59] Lead me. You're much higher. Lead me.
[27:04] You're much wiser. Lead me.
[27:09] Wherever you'll take me, I'll go
[27:15] through the fire. I'll go through the
[27:19] valley. I know you know my way back
[27:24] home.
[27:26] We've all had days when life has brought
[27:30] us to our knees.
[27:36] But there will praise you Jesus.
[27:40] Though we can't see your face is telling
[27:44] us you're here.
[27:50] That's why we praise you Jesus.
[27:55] Jesus I
[27:58] I won't be ashamed.
[28:02] Take you by the hand.
[28:05] Take me by the hand.

[28:20] Take you by the hand.
[28:25] Lead me. You're much higher. Lead me.
[28:31] You're much wiser. Lead me.
[28:36] Where you take me, I will
[28:42] fire. I
[28:48] know you know my way back home.
[28:54] When the earth shake and roll
[28:57] and the ocean cross their mouth
[29:01] and all around there's nothing left.
[29:08] When the stars fall from the sky
[29:12] and the mountain away,
[29:16] you're lost and still
[29:25] you're
[29:34] where you take me. Power

[30:24] home.
[30:36] Well, Jesus
[30:38] paid it all.

[39:41] Rudolph. Good to have you here.
[39:44] Amen. Amen. I just feel so good after
[39:47] those songs. Don't you? Amen. Let's uh
[39:49] let's turn in the scripture uh this
[39:51] morning. We're going to go to Exodus uh
[39:54] chapter 20. Going to read a couple of
[39:55] verses here. Then we're going to uh go
[39:57] to Joshua chapter 10.
[40:01] Um
[40:07] good to see Omar Robin. God bless you.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Good to see you. God bless you. Amen.
[40:12] Welcome.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Great to have you. Amen.
[40:18] Amen. Exodus 20 and 2 and 3 uh says this
[40:21] here. I am the Lord thy God which
[40:24] brought thee out of the land of Egypt,
[40:25] out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt
[40:28] have no other gods before me. And then
[40:31] we're going to go to and I pray the Lord
[40:32] will tie these all together because in
[40:34] my mind they they do. But we're going to
[40:36] go to uh Joshua 10 and verses 24 and 25
[40:41] and read a couple of um
[40:44] scriptures here and then one verse in
[40:46] Acts 23.
[40:50] So Joshua 10 and 24
[40:53] 25 says, "And it came to pass when they
[40:55] brought out those kings unto Joshua."
[40:57] This is the five kings that were in the
[41:00] cave uh that Joshua called for all the
[41:02] men of Israel and said unto the captains
[41:04] of the men of war uh which went with
[41:07] them, "Come near, put your feet upon the
[41:08] necks of these kings." And they came
[41:10] near and put their feet upon the necks
[41:12] of them. And Joshua said unto them,
[41:14] "Fear not, nor be dismayed. Be strong
[41:16] and be of good courage. For thus shall
[41:19] the Lord do to all your enemies whom I
[41:21] mean against whom you fight. Amen. What
[41:24] a what a great promise. And then just
[41:27] just one more. You don't need to turn to
[41:28] it, but just Acts 23 and 11. This is the
[41:31] Lord speaking to to Paul. It says in the
[41:33] and in the night following the Lord
[41:35] stood by him and said, "Be of good
[41:37] cheer, Paul, for as thou hast testified
[41:40] of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear
[41:42] witness also at Rome."
[41:46] Amen. So let's bow our heads in a word
[41:48] of prayer this morning. And as always,
[41:49] not out of tradition, but if you want to
[41:51] be remembered in prayer, say, Lord, you
[41:52] just want to slip your hand up, say,
[41:53] Lord, come by my way today. Amen.
[41:56] Almighty God, we just want to thank you
[41:58] so much. We can come together as Lord,
[42:00] in this fashion, Lord, to praise and
[42:02] worship you. And just want to pray, dear
[42:03] God, that you'd come and touch all of
[42:05] our hearts as we've read your great
[42:07] word. I pray you'd anoint it now. Speak
[42:09] to our hearts, Lord, change our lives,
[42:11] Lord Jesus. Lord, we're so thankful we
[42:13] can let you change our lives. that you
[42:15] transform us, mold us, and shape us. So
[42:17] may you be glorified in our midst today.
[42:19] We also want to remember those who
[42:20] couldn't be here today. Be their
[42:21] portion, Lord. If they Lord, if they be
[42:23] sick in body or traveling, just heal
[42:25] their bodies, Lord, and keep them safe
[42:26] on the road. And we just want to just
[42:28] want to plead your blood over us as a
[42:30] people, Lord. Protect us, Lord. Keep us
[42:31] under the shadow of your great wings and
[42:33] have your way this day in Jesus Christ's
[42:35] name. Amen. Amen. God bless you,
[42:37] friends. You can have your seats this
[42:39] morning. So I want to speak if I could
[42:41] take a
[42:43] uh take a title or just a thought here
[42:45] uh just from this uh third verse here in
[42:47] Exodus 20 that thou shalt have no other
[42:50] gods before me and and my my question I
[42:54] want to ask you this morning is what is
[42:57] your ultimate what is your god? Uh
[43:00] because
[43:02] a a god can be anything. You know the
[43:05] English word God, it just means an
[43:06] object of worship as brother Brand
[43:08] breaks it down and he says you know your
[43:10] car, your job, your family, even your
[43:13] church, your yourself can be your God.
[43:16] It be the thing that that you worship.
[43:18] Now worship when we think about it often
[43:20] we think about like the song service
[43:22] here we raise our hands we feel blessed
[43:25] you know you know we we we view that as
[43:27] worship and it is it is worship in a way
[43:30] but worship is more than that. Worship
[43:32] is more than uh you know coming before
[43:36] an idol like the pagans do and bowing
[43:38] themselves down but you know worship uh
[43:40] even though that is a form of worship
[43:42] but worship is really what you allow the
[43:46] thing you worship is a thing you bow
[43:47] down to the thing you give first place
[43:50] in your life now I pray well I believe
[43:52] I'm preaching to the choir this morning
[43:54] but I pray that that our the thing we
[43:58] worship is the Lord Jesus Christ his
[43:59] word so not not our imaginations, not
[44:03] our conscience, reasoning, affection.
[44:04] This is where I'm going to go with this.
[44:05] You know, more than just, you know, none
[44:07] of those things, but the thing that
[44:09] actually has the final say in our lives
[44:11] is his word. Amen. It's not our opinion,
[44:14] not what we think, not what's trending
[44:16] or #th this on social media, whatever,
[44:19] whatever. Not none of those things, but
[44:21] it's his word has the final say because
[44:23] the thing that has the final say in your
[44:25] life is the thing you actually bow down
[44:27] to. Now, the first time the word worship
[44:30] is ever used in the Bible is in Genesis
[44:32] 22 where where God tells Abraham to take
[44:35] his son, his only son Isaac, and go
[44:37] sacrifice him on a mountain that he has
[44:39] shown. And Abraham said unto this young
[44:42] man, um I mean unto his young men, abide
[44:44] ye here with the S, and I and the lad
[44:47] will go yonder and worship and come
[44:48] again to you. This is the first time the
[44:51] word worship is used in scripture. Now
[44:53] there had been worship all the way from
[44:56] Eden even before Eden in heaven down
[44:58] into this point. But this is the first
[45:00] time this word is used. And what does it
[45:02] means? It means to prostrate
[45:04] especially reflectively in homage to
[45:07] royalty or God to bounce oneself down to
[45:10] crouch to fall down to humbly beseech to
[45:13] make obstinence to do reverence to make
[45:16] to to stoop to worship. So it's a it's a
[45:18] surrender to something. So it's more
[45:21] than just an ex what what the expression
[45:23] is because that can be many different
[45:25] forms. People can used to lay themselves
[45:28] down on a church floor and prostrate
[45:29] themselves like this and they call that
[45:31] worship and we say this is worship and
[45:34] running and dancing can be worship.
[45:36] Every there's many forms of worship but
[45:38] what worship is is what you give
[45:40] yourself to. Okay. So this is this is
[45:43] where where we read in that uh you know
[45:45] the first commandment there is thou
[45:47] shalt now have have no other gods before
[45:49] me. So, so God is saying here, you can't
[45:52] have anything else that has the final
[45:54] say in your life. You need to bow. You
[45:56] need to surrender to me that I have the
[45:58] final say that God is our absolute. Now,
[46:01] I'm just going to go slow today cuz I
[46:03] want you to think about this because,
[46:04] you know, the spirit of man can be so
[46:06] deceptive. The heart is evil. Who can
[46:08] know it? You know, there's many, many
[46:10] devices in our lives that even
[46:12] subconsciously we can we can outwardly
[46:14] say we're Christians and outwardly say,
[46:16] "Yes, I believe the message and go
[46:18] through all the motions." But when it
[46:19] comes down to challenging moments in our
[46:21] life, what do we really show we worship?
[46:25] You see, now this is this is very uh
[46:27] important. And as I'm speaking to you,
[46:29] I'm speaking to me cuz because what has
[46:31] the final say in my life? Is it me or is
[46:34] it God?
[46:35] Right? And so now the now so the thing
[46:38] you worship is your absolute. It has
[46:40] your final say. Uh it has the final say
[46:43] in your uh in your life. Now the word
[46:46] absolute it means it's free from
[46:48] imperfection. It means it's perfect.
[46:50] It's free or relatively free from
[46:52] mixture. So it's pure. It's something
[46:54] that's absolute. It's something that's
[46:56] been governed by or characteristic of a
[46:58] ruler or authority completely free from
[47:00] constitutional or other restraint. So
[47:02] it's absolute power. So that's something
[47:05] so someone that something that's got
[47:06] absolute power has the final say.
[47:08] Doesn't matter what others say, what
[47:10] protests, people beseech or you know
[47:13] appeal that that person or being has the
[47:16] final say. And there's a lot of things
[47:19] in our lives, but there's one thing that
[47:21] will have the final say, right? So yeah,
[47:24] and it's also something that's absolute
[47:25] has no restriction, expect uh uh
[47:28] exception or qualification. It's an
[47:30] absolute requirement and absolute
[47:32] freedom. That's something that's
[47:33] absolute. It's not restrained in any
[47:34] way. It controls. Now, brother Brown
[47:37] preaches the sermon or he preaches it a
[47:39] few places uh you know absolute or an
[47:42] absolute. He says but the word absolute
[47:44] is an ultimate and therefore I think
[47:45] that everyone should have an ultimate.
[47:47] So we got some we all actually have
[47:49] something whether we realize or not that
[47:50] has the final say in our lives. Okay, if
[47:52] we're honest we all have something you
[47:55] know and and every great achievement
[47:57] that's ever been achieved there has been
[47:59] an absolute behind it. No matter what it
[48:01] is it's had an absolute behind it. And
[48:03] every person in order to achieve
[48:05] something has to first have the absolute
[48:07] and that's the final wine back through
[48:10] this back through the other till you
[48:11] come to that absolute or the amen or or
[48:14] the ultimate uh of what your you've got
[48:17] something you have to tie to. In other
[48:19] words, it's a final tying post to every
[48:23] achievement. It's somewhere. It might
[48:24] wind back through different things till
[48:26] you get to that tie post, but there is
[48:28] the amen to all of it. There must be
[48:31] such a thing. You cannot go on through
[48:32] life without having one. So if our
[48:35] absolute is the word of God, things will
[48:37] go through our reasoning and our
[48:39] conscience and our affections, but it'll
[48:40] wind through all those things and it
[48:42] will finish on your absolute. So if your
[48:45] absolute is the word of God, you may be
[48:47] feeling down. You maybe feel like what's
[48:49] the point in trying? I might as well
[48:50] quit being a Christian. All this
[48:52] reasoning, see all that all that
[48:53] decision will be going passing through
[48:55] all those things. But if you're a
[48:57] Christian, Amen. Then your final the
[48:59] thing that has the final say in that
[49:01] decision is no. I've been bought with a
[49:03] price. I mean the blood of Jesus Christ
[49:05] is more than enough. It's not him that
[49:07] falls at him that gets back up. Amen.
[49:09] I'm going all the way. The Lord Jesus is
[49:11] my king. You know, so your absolute is
[49:13] actually what God has said. He's he his
[49:15] thoughts towards me are of peace and
[49:17] I'll come to an expected end. Right? So
[49:19] if our absolute is that doesn't matter
[49:20] what goes on in our spirit realm,
[49:23] troubles up and down, reasoning,
[49:24] emotion, all those things. If our final
[49:27] if the final typost is the word of God,
[49:30] everything will come back to that. But
[49:31] if our if our typost is our reasoning or
[49:34] our conscience or our memory, all those
[49:36] things, that thing will have the final
[49:38] say in our lives. Now, I believe I'm
[49:40] looking at a people as I said that the
[49:42] that the final say is is the word of
[49:45] God. Now, our lives will really prove
[49:47] what our absolute is. Okay? So as as we
[49:50] um you know we could read here in in uh
[49:53] Philippians because not everyone's God
[49:55] is God. Even he'd say in Philippians 3,
[49:58] now for many walk to whom I have told
[50:00] you often and now tell you even weeping
[50:03] that they are the enemies of the cross
[50:05] of Christ whose end is destruction whose
[50:07] God is their belly and whose glory is in
[50:10] their shame who mind earthly things. So
[50:12] these people they are they are I think
[50:15] uh Paul's not just talking about
[50:16] unbelievers. He's talking about people
[50:18] who are in the ranks of Christendom. But
[50:20] he said that their God or their absolute
[50:22] is not God. It's their own belly. It's
[50:24] it's it's whatever you know. So, so it's
[50:26] whatever furthers their own personal
[50:28] cause is what they'll push. And how how
[50:31] sadly we can see many places where where
[50:33] where where people's God is their own
[50:35] belly. They'll build a ministry around
[50:37] furthering themselves as opposed to
[50:39] furthering the kingdom of God. And it's
[50:42] those who mind so and they who mind
[50:44] earthly things. So you can see that
[50:45] whoever these people are, their absolute
[50:47] is not the word. Are you all following
[50:48] me this morning? Amen. So you know you
[50:51] we must have we must have an ultimate
[50:55] and or an absolute and that thing is the
[50:58] thing we worship. Now the power you live
[51:01] by is depending on what your absolute
[51:03] is. That's how strong you can live if I
[51:05] put it that way. That's the power that's
[51:06] in your life. Now if we look at if we
[51:10] look at uh just say in your your in the
[51:13] natural sense every game must have an
[51:15] absolute or an umpire. Okay. Every game
[51:19] must have an umpire. If you don't have
[51:21] an umpire that game when there's when
[51:24] there's anything that's controversial it
[51:26] will descend into chaos and that game
[51:28] will not be completed. So so there has
[51:30] to be an absolute in every game. Doesn't
[51:32] matter if it's football, rugby, soccer,
[51:34] cricket. In this in this instance,
[51:36] everything must have an absolute. Now,
[51:39] this is this is very important because
[51:41] the absolute in a game of cricket is not
[51:43] the players on the field, right? So, you
[51:46] let's just put you in a cricket game. If
[51:48] you've played, if you've never played,
[51:49] you're now the batsman, you know, facing
[51:52] facing a bowler there and you're out in
[51:54] the middle. Your absolute is not the um
[51:57] opposing people on the field, right?
[51:59] Your absolute is not even you. You know,
[52:02] your absolute is not you. People say,
[52:03] "Well, I've just got to go find my
[52:05] heart." Well, you're finding the wrong
[52:07] absolute. We should be seeking after the
[52:09] word of God, right? So, so here is here
[52:11] here we are. We're playing and so, so
[52:14] the absolute on that field is not the
[52:16] opposing team. It's not you. It's not
[52:19] even those people in the stands. And
[52:21] it's certainly not the armchair coaches
[52:23] who think they could do a better job
[52:25] because let's be honest, if they could
[52:26] do a better job, they would have been on
[52:28] the field. But they didn't make it.
[52:30] Amen. But then they think they know all
[52:32] about the game and the ins and outs.
[52:33] See, as brother Brandham, No, no, no, it
[52:35] wasn't Brother Bram, but um um was it
[52:37] Theodore Roosevelt, Teddy Roosevelt made
[52:40] this speech about the man in the arena,
[52:42] and he says, "It's not about the people
[52:44] on the outside that counts. It's the man
[52:45] in the arena that matters." And so,
[52:48] people can criticize all they want. They
[52:49] ain't in the arena. They ain't on the
[52:52] field. Amen. They're not pressing the
[52:53] battle for the word of God. They're just
[52:55] criticizing and writing blogs and and
[52:57] and and just complaining about things.
[52:59] Their opinion doesn't matter. The our
[53:02] absolute opinion is what matters. It's
[53:04] not what they say. It's not what the
[53:05] opposing fans say. It's not what anyone
[53:08] in the stands say. It's the absolute on
[53:10] the cricket field is the umpire.
[53:13] Amen. And it's exactly the same thing
[53:15] with you and I. Our absolute in our life
[53:17] is not ourselves. It's not the devil.
[53:21] It's not the critic. It's not the world.
[53:23] Our absolute is the word of God. Now,
[53:26] you know this umpire here, if he says
[53:28] it's a no ball, it's a no ball. If he
[53:31] says it's wide, it's wide. If he says,
[53:34] you know, the person's out, he's out. If
[53:36] he doesn't say it, it doesn't happen.
[53:41] Right? Doesn't matter how loud the
[53:43] opposing the opposing team, the fielding
[53:46] team appeal, who are they appealing to?
[53:48] They're not appealing to the batsman to
[53:49] go. They're appealing to the absolute on
[53:51] the field, which is the umpire. And they
[53:53] can they can appeal as loud as they
[53:55] want. They can get as as emotional as
[53:57] they want. But the thing is if that
[54:00] batsman's not trained, if they don't
[54:03] realize the umpire is the absolute on
[54:05] the field and you know maybe maybe they
[54:08] go to block a ball and maybe it doesn't
[54:09] hit their hit their bat but maybe
[54:11] strikes their back pad and the wicket
[54:13] keeper catches it. So they hear a you
[54:15] know they hear a noise. They're
[54:16] appealing the you know the field. Now
[54:18] now who's going to be the absolute to
[54:20] that batsman? Is it the sound he hears?
[54:22] Is that his absolute and then he just
[54:24] walks? Or is it or is it the feeling? Oh
[54:27] yes, I did actually hit that ball cuz I
[54:28] heard a sound. Is it is it his emotions
[54:30] that are going to dictate whether he
[54:32] stays or he or he walks off the field
[54:34] that he got out? See, an untrained
[54:36] batsman will go by his emotions and his
[54:38] emotions or his feeling or what he hears
[54:40] is his absolute. But a trained batsman
[54:42] will not do that. They will stay there
[54:44] until they see the decision of the
[54:46] umpire because they're trained that the
[54:48] absolute on the field is not how they
[54:50] feel. It's not what they've heard. It's
[54:52] not what the opposing team is saying. It
[54:55] is what the umpire says. That's the only
[54:57] thing that matters. And it's exactly the
[54:59] same in our Christian walk. It's not
[55:00] about how you feel. Our feelings are not
[55:03] our absolute. It's not what we hear.
[55:05] That's not our absolute. What we see
[55:06] with our eyes is not our absolute. It's
[55:08] not what the enemy is telling you. The
[55:10] other team, right? It's what the umpire,
[55:13] the word of God says.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the decisions there has got
[55:18] nothing to do with
[55:21] the other team, the batsman. It's the
[55:24] umpire.
[55:25] What's your absolute
[55:28] in terms of worship or what has the
[55:29] final say? The umpire has the final say.
[55:32] The word has the final say. You see? So
[55:36] it and and it doesn't matter how
[55:38] controversial his call is, he has the
[55:40] final say. Same thing in the Christian
[55:44] life. He says, "No matter what your
[55:46] experience is,
[55:48] then if you if something in you tells
[55:50] you that the Bible isn't true, that the
[55:53] power of God, apostles, prophets, and
[55:54] teachers, and pastors, and the gifts of
[55:56] the spirit just isn't the same as it was
[55:59] when it flowed through them apostles at
[56:01] Pentecost, there's something wrong with
[56:03] your absolute. There's something wrong
[56:04] with what you're worshiping." Amen.
[56:06] Because our God is the same yesterday,
[56:08] today, and forever. So, our absolute
[56:11] doesn't change. It's like a cricket
[56:13] umpire. He doesn't change his decisions
[56:15] because the rules of the game don't
[56:16] change. The word doesn't change. So the
[56:19] so the so the umpire will give his
[56:21] decisions based on the rule book. Right?
[56:23] And the Holy Ghost will give his
[56:25] decisions based on his word. Amen. Cuz
[56:27] he wrote his word. So if there's
[56:29] something within you telling you that
[56:31] the word is not true today, yes, it was
[56:33] with brother Brandham and yes, the
[56:34] apostles and we can see that and God
[56:36] moved in great power. But things are
[56:38] different now. That's a wrong absolute.
[56:40] Amen. Because our absolute is the same
[56:42] yesterday, today and forever. Amen. It
[56:44] has to tie. See, it says it has to tie
[56:46] to denominational creed instead of God's
[56:48] Bible when he but when he said both
[56:50] heavens and earth will pass away, but my
[56:52] word will never fail. Watch what your
[56:55] absolute is. So, we must be very careful
[56:59] to to look at what what is what is what
[57:02] is the final say in our life. Is it is
[57:05] it money? Is it popularity? Is it is it
[57:07] what are we worshiping? What are we
[57:09] giving ourselves to? What has the final
[57:11] say? You see your, you know, your
[57:15] feelings, if your feelings have the
[57:16] final say, then you'll live by the power
[57:19] of your feelings. Your feelings will
[57:20] motivate your life. You see, and then
[57:22] what will happen is you say, well, I
[57:24] don't feel to do something.
[57:27] I I need the right feeling. And that
[57:30] becomes your absolute. Or I need a
[57:32] feeling to do it. And then now you're
[57:34] now you're now actually hamstrung by
[57:36] your feelings. I need a feeling to start
[57:38] something and I need a feeling to do
[57:40] something. But what is it? But that
[57:42] means you're worshiping your feelings.
[57:44] They have the final say. So for example,
[57:46] in the Bible, if it says that you should
[57:48] get baptized in the name of the Lord
[57:50] Jesus Christ for the remission of sin,
[57:52] that's the Bible. Now, now if the Bible
[57:53] is your absolute, it's not how you feel.
[57:55] You obey the word, right? Or it says you
[57:57] must forgive those who have wronged you.
[57:59] I don't feel to. Well, your feelings are
[58:01] dictating to you what to do. I need to
[58:03] feel that it's right to, you know, to to
[58:05] to talk to that person and to forgive
[58:07] them first and whatever more. Well, then
[58:09] your feelings are running your life. But
[58:11] the Bible says when you pray, forgive,
[58:13] right? So if my absolute says when you
[58:15] pray forgive, I'm going to forgive.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Right? So what is what is running your
[58:20] life? And it doesn't matter how loud
[58:22] your feelings are, doesn't matter how
[58:24] strong and real they may be. What is
[58:26] your absolute?
[58:28] You see, so we should never, you know,
[58:29] we should never run, you know, because
[58:31] let's be honest, friends, if we all ran
[58:33] our life by our feelings, what kind of
[58:35] chaos would we be in?
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Where would we be? It would be a in it
[58:39] would be a crazy story where we'd turn
[58:41] up. But that's why we're so thankful we
[58:44] don't we don't worship our feelings. We
[58:47] worship the Lord, the word, right? You
[58:50] know, like you know, your memories
[58:51] memories can be an absolute to someone.
[58:54] They will, you know, have a bad
[58:55] experience with something and they'll
[58:56] let that bad experience control their
[58:58] life. I heard brother Isaac, I was
[59:00] streaming as I was coming here and you
[59:01] said you you want to break, you know,
[59:03] God to break every complex. You want to
[59:04] take it to the grave or take it to the
[59:06] rapture. Well, you know, a complex can
[59:08] come from a memory, something that
[59:10] happened. Now, is that going to become
[59:12] our absolute? Oh, bad. You know, this
[59:14] bad thing, and I'm not degrading any bad
[59:16] thing that's happened to anybody, but
[59:17] are we going to let that thing be our
[59:19] absolute that it rules our life? Or are
[59:21] we going to smash that thing? Are we
[59:23] going to let the word of God bear
[59:24] absolute and overcome that thing?
[59:27] Amen.
[59:30] Amen. If you can read in that scripture
[59:32] something that Christ has ordained or
[59:34] commissioned us to do and because of
[59:36] some twisting around, if you let if if
[59:38] someone would tell you that that was for
[59:40] the disciples or someone else, then you
[59:43] don't hold on to that, then Christ is
[59:45] not your absolute. That person who led
[59:48] you out of the way is your absolute. But
[59:50] if that word Christ still holds, then
[59:52] then he's your absolute. You mustn't let
[59:54] anything stir us out of the way of the
[59:56] word. See, so the so for example with my
[59:59] cricket example, the fielders would
[1:00:01] become the batsman's absolute if they if
[1:00:04] he if if the batsman believed their
[1:00:06] appeal and he walked, right? If he
[1:00:08] didn't wait for the umpire's decision
[1:00:10] and he just walked, then then who led
[1:00:12] him from who led him from the wickets?
[1:00:14] It wasn't the umpire. It wasn't what
[1:00:16] really happened. It was the emotion of
[1:00:18] and the reasoning of the fielding team.
[1:00:21] And so anyone who leads us away from the
[1:00:24] word of God actually becomes our
[1:00:25] absolute.
[1:00:27] But if the Holy Ghost is your absolute,
[1:00:29] you won't give the word for nothing.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; You won't trade it because that is has
[1:00:33] the final say in your life. Praise the
[1:00:36] Lord. I'm so glad we can be like that,
[1:00:37] aren't you? Amen. That he has the final
[1:00:40] say. Now, I'm just sorry for a bit of
[1:00:43] reading. But you see, but what really
[1:00:45] happens is our greatest enemy is
[1:00:47] ourselves.
[1:00:49] This is really I want to come down to
[1:00:50] cuz I want to go beyond money and and
[1:00:53] entertainment, you know, all these other
[1:00:55] gods.
[1:00:56] What about in you? You know, Brother
[1:01:00] Brandham would say, "The greatest enemy
[1:01:02] I have is William Brandham. If I can
[1:01:05] just get that guy out of the way, then
[1:01:07] God can do things William Brandon knows
[1:01:08] nothing about." So, we got to be honest,
[1:01:10] friends. Satan was defeated on Calvary.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Hell was conquered. Every demon in hell
[1:01:17] has been conquered. We face a defeated
[1:01:19] foe.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; So the only one that needs to be
[1:01:21] conquered is actually you and I. We need
[1:01:24] to let the word of God conquer
[1:01:25] ourselves. I mean, that's where the
[1:01:27] battle lays. I mean, our our enemy is
[1:01:29] defeated. Sickness is defeated. I mean,
[1:01:31] every demon of torment's been defeated
[1:01:33] that day on Calvary. And God is here to
[1:01:35] enforce his victory upon them in our
[1:01:38] lives. But the thing is, we have a free
[1:01:40] moral agency that we have to give our
[1:01:42] self-will over to the Lord that now we
[1:01:45] we don't get in the way anymore. We are
[1:01:47] our own worst enemy whether we like it
[1:01:50] or not. It's not your spouse. It's not
[1:01:52] your siblings. It's not your parents.
[1:01:54] It's not your school. It's not your job.
[1:01:57] It's not the economy. It's not Trump.
[1:01:59] It's not anyone like that. Actually,
[1:02:01] your greatest enemy is you. It's the
[1:02:03] person in the mirror you look at most
[1:02:06] mornings or every morning depending on
[1:02:08] what gender you are or a lot of times in
[1:02:10] the morning. But that person, if you can
[1:02:13] get him out or her out of the way, then
[1:02:16] God can step in and do things you know
[1:02:18] nothing about. I mean, you may read
[1:02:20] about it in the scripture, but you can
[1:02:21] see God step in. Cuz remember, the same
[1:02:24] God in the prophets, the same God in
[1:02:25] you. The same God in the Lord Jesus
[1:02:27] Christ is the same God in you. Same God
[1:02:30] in the disciples is the same God in you.
[1:02:32] Amen. So he can do the very same things
[1:02:34] through your life. We cannot let a
[1:02:37] restriction be upon our God and what he
[1:02:39] can do.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why Joshua would would take
[1:02:43] those uh five five kings out of the cave
[1:02:46] after the great victory where God did a
[1:02:48] great paradox there and made the sun and
[1:02:50] moon stand still and you know those you
[1:02:52] know and and then and then what happened
[1:02:54] is he brought them out and he told his
[1:02:56] told his men, "Put your feet on the neck
[1:02:58] of your enemies." And because God was
[1:03:00] God was showing through that
[1:03:02] symbolically, this is this is the
[1:03:04] dominion you're going to have in your
[1:03:06] inheritance. I mean, your enemy is not
[1:03:08] going to be running around. He's not
[1:03:09] going to be afflicting you. But you are
[1:03:11] going to win this victory because God's
[1:03:13] already given you the land. And you are
[1:03:15] going to put your foot on his neck.
[1:03:18] Amen. To show you have complete dominion
[1:03:20] over him. Amen. So, well, you say, "Why
[1:03:24] haven't you put the devil under there?"
[1:03:25] Well, he's already been conquered. It's
[1:03:28] you. It's your feelings have to be
[1:03:30] conquered.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; They can't run you anymore. Well, I feel
[1:03:34] happy. Well, I'm going to be happy. I
[1:03:35] feel down. I'm going to be down. And
[1:03:37] this person said this and I imagine that
[1:03:39] you No, you got to you got to take your
[1:03:41] feelings subject to the word of God.
[1:03:43] Amen. You cannot let them rule you.
[1:03:45] Amen. You cannot be tossed to and fro.
[1:03:47] That doesn't mean you become a robot. We
[1:03:49] all have feelings and God wants us to
[1:03:51] have feelings. God wants us to be uh not
[1:03:53] detached and just be robots. We weren't
[1:03:56] made to be robots, but you were to take
[1:03:58] every feeling and and bring it subject
[1:04:01] subject to the word of God. I don't feel
[1:04:04] like serving God today. Who who gave you
[1:04:06] that feeling? Where's that feeling
[1:04:08] coming from? I mean, there's no feelings
[1:04:10] in your soul, but I'll just say that
[1:04:11] feeling didn't come from your soul.
[1:04:13] Didn't come from the spirit of God.
[1:04:15] That's the enemy trying to see if he can
[1:04:16] drag you around. Don't live below your
[1:04:19] privileges by by by by serving and
[1:04:22] bowing down to your feelings
[1:04:24] or your reasoning.
[1:04:26] Oh, you know, there's so much reasoning
[1:04:28] in the world today. Don't live by your
[1:04:30] reasoning. I know I've got a canary
[1:04:32] brain. I don't trust it.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; I'll be honest. This two in has only got
[1:04:37] me into trouble.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; It's God that got me out.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; So, my absolute is not going to be my
[1:04:42] thinking.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And of course, you're thinking you
[1:04:47] if all of these things if they line up
[1:04:49] with the word of God, you keep them. But
[1:04:51] if it's contrary, you get rid of it,
[1:04:53] right? So if my reasoning matches the
[1:04:56] word, I'm going to go with that reason
[1:04:57] cuz that's godly counsel. Right? If my
[1:05:00] feelings go with the word, then I'm
[1:05:02] going to go with those feelings. Well,
[1:05:04] what are those feelings? A godly sorrow
[1:05:05] for sin, a real reverent sincerity,
[1:05:08] that's a feeling. I'm going to go with
[1:05:10] that. I'm not going to throw that away.
[1:05:12] I'm not going to say that's contrary. If
[1:05:14] I think of the Lord and I feel that way,
[1:05:15] I'm going to keep that feeling.
[1:05:17] Soberness, that's a feeling, right? If
[1:05:21] my reasoning is is is telling me that
[1:05:22] the word isn't true anymore, I'm going
[1:05:24] to throw that reasoning aside,
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; right? But but if my reasoning is
[1:05:28] actually no, he is the same yesterday,
[1:05:30] today, and forever. He can do anything
[1:05:33] at any time. He can do it like this.
[1:05:35] There's nothing too hard for my God. I'm
[1:05:37] going to keep that reasoning. Amen. If
[1:05:39] my reasoning says actually all things
[1:05:41] work together for good. Those who are
[1:05:43] who love the Lord and are called
[1:05:45] according to his purpose. Amen. Then
[1:05:47] therefore my reasoning is Lord you are
[1:05:49] actually this is working for my good. So
[1:05:50] I'm going to keep that reasoning. Amen.
[1:05:52] I'm not going to throw it away. I'm
[1:05:54] going to keep that reasoning. And the
[1:05:55] same thing with my memory. Amen. See see
[1:05:57] the devil loves to bring up memories of
[1:05:59] our failures of our past. But you've got
[1:06:01] to update that story back to where the
[1:06:03] devil got defeated. He got dethroned. I
[1:06:06] mean now Christ is the king of your
[1:06:07] life. You've been washed in the blood of
[1:06:09] the lamb. Every sin has been taken care
[1:06:11] of. Amen. That's a good memory,
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; right? Or you go into memories of when
[1:06:16] God delivered you, God counseledled you,
[1:06:19] God guided you. Those are good memories.
[1:06:22] But all the memories of all the trouble,
[1:06:23] hurts, and pains of the past. I would
[1:06:25] take that and say, "I'm not living by
[1:06:27] those memories anymore. This is a new
[1:06:28] day. This is a new year. This is a new
[1:06:31] day to walk with the Lord. I'm gonna I'm
[1:06:33] gonna lay those things like even Paul
[1:06:35] would say forgetting the things which
[1:06:36] are in the past. Amen. So don't be don't
[1:06:39] be a slave to your past. Amen. No. Be a
[1:06:41] be a love slave to the word of God. Let
[1:06:44] let your let your let your memories be
[1:06:46] God. You fulfilled your word over and
[1:06:49] over and over again and keep with them.
[1:06:52] Amen. Your affections. If my affections
[1:06:55] are on the Lord. Lord, I love you. Lord,
[1:06:57] you're amazing. You're the best thing
[1:06:59] that's ever happened to me. I'm so
[1:07:01] thankful you found me, Lord. I'm so glad
[1:07:03] your word is true. I'm so glad we're not
[1:07:05] just looking back and oh, I wish I could
[1:07:07] be back in the book of Acts, BUT LORD,
[1:07:08] YOU'RE WRITING A book of Acts in this
[1:07:10] day. OH, I WISH I COULD BE BACK IN 1960s
[1:07:13] where the prophet was here. No, but
[1:07:14] you're the same God today. I'm so
[1:07:16] thankful. I'm not just looking through a
[1:07:17] rearview mirror and wishing one day. No,
[1:07:20] my affections are Lord, you're the
[1:07:21] resurrection, the life today. You're
[1:07:23] present today. You're more than able
[1:07:25] today to fulfill your word. Amen. You're
[1:07:28] so faithful. You're true. You're so
[1:07:29] glorious. You're so lovely. I'm going to
[1:07:31] stick with those affections.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Any affection that takes me from the
[1:07:37] word of God that makes me want to bow
[1:07:38] down to something else. I'm going to I'm
[1:07:40] going to kill that thing.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; It ain't worth it. Because if you love
[1:07:43] the Lord with all your heart, soul,
[1:07:44] mind, and strength, you'll love your
[1:07:46] neighbor as yourself. You'll love your
[1:07:47] family. You'll be a useful person. Amen.
[1:07:51] Imaginations. Those are a big one.
[1:07:55] If my imaginations
[1:07:57] are contrary to the word of God, I'm
[1:07:59] going to get rid of it. I'm not going to
[1:08:01] live in a false world, I'm going to I'm
[1:08:04] going to I'm going to say, "Lord, put
[1:08:05] that under my feet." If my imaginations
[1:08:08] are God moving in power, the Holy Ghost
[1:08:11] coming among us. Amen. Where we have a
[1:08:14] camp meeting every Sunday, every
[1:08:16] Wednesday, and can be ministered in
[1:08:18] different ways. Our brother Mach
[1:08:19] preached such a masterpiece on
[1:08:20] Wednesday. God just dealing and
[1:08:22] speaking. I so loved it. Amen. Or it can
[1:08:24] be very dynamic. It doesn't matter how
[1:08:26] it comes. It really doesn't matter. It's
[1:08:28] God feeding his people. Amen. And that's
[1:08:30] what I look for. And God comes out and
[1:08:32] anoints his word and the pillar of fire
[1:08:34] moves and touches our lives. Amen. I can
[1:08:37] imagine that cuz I've seen it happen
[1:08:40] over and over again. Amen. You get into
[1:08:42] trouble and you begin to imagine, Lord,
[1:08:44] you can get me out. You've done it
[1:08:46] before. Lord, you'll do it again because
[1:08:47] you're the same God today as you were
[1:08:49] back then. Amen. You can imagine those
[1:08:51] things. But some kind of imagination
[1:08:52] that someone hates you, someone doesn't
[1:08:54] like you. You know, you can build a
[1:08:56] whole false world by a wrong
[1:08:59] imagination,
[1:09:00] someone doesn't shake your hand. One
[1:09:03] service, two services, three services,
[1:09:04] and you think, man, that person really
[1:09:06] doesn't like you. And you don't know
[1:09:08] what they're going through. They got to
[1:09:09] rush off and do something, and they, you
[1:09:10] know, they're in this big comp uh not
[1:09:12] complex, but, you know, trial and
[1:09:14] trouble, all these things. But you get
[1:09:16] in your mind this imagination, man, that
[1:09:18] brother or sister, they've really
[1:09:19] changed. You know, I must have done
[1:09:20] something wrong. and you know what's
[1:09:22] wrong with them and but it's just an
[1:09:23] imagination.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; You got to go beyond those imaginations.
[1:09:26] Remember, we're all human.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Okay, some of us is we're all human. We
[1:09:33] can we have misunderstandings.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; It's part of being human. But don't let
[1:09:38] that misunderstanding become an
[1:09:40] imagination.
[1:09:41] Amen. Throw those things down. Amen. As
[1:09:44] it second says in 2 Corinthians, for the
[1:09:47] weapons of our warfare are not carnal,
[1:09:48] but mighty through God to the pulling
[1:09:50] down of strongholds. Where are those
[1:09:52] strongholds? In the human spirit,
[1:09:54] casting down imaginations. Amen. And
[1:09:57] every high thing that exalts itself
[1:09:58] against the knowledge of God and
[1:10:00] bringing into captivity every thought to
[1:10:02] the obedience of Christ or the knowledge
[1:10:04] of Christ. See, that's within your
[1:10:06] power. You control your thought life.
[1:10:09] You control if you're em, you know, if
[1:10:11] you're governed, if you worship your
[1:10:13] emotions or not. that's placed in in our
[1:10:16] hands what we think about. See, God when
[1:10:19] you you know a Christian does not um
[1:10:21] isn't a person that doesn't think. It's
[1:10:23] just a blank. That's not a believer. A
[1:10:26] believer actively thinks, right? Thinks
[1:10:29] about life, thinks about what they're
[1:10:31] going through, thinks about the promises
[1:10:32] of God, thinks about their family,
[1:10:35] thinks about the church, thinks about
[1:10:36] their friends, and you know, but but
[1:10:37] it's a highlevel thinking. It's not a
[1:10:40] low-level thinking of, you know, just
[1:10:41] some empty thing that they're chasing.
[1:10:43] We should have higher level thinking
[1:10:45] about life, right? You know, we
[1:10:47] shouldn't just be thinking about, you
[1:10:48] know, like brother Bam says and thinking
[1:10:50] man's filter. Many people they just
[1:10:52] thinking about their next drink or
[1:10:53] another woman they can chase. That's
[1:10:54] very low level, right? That's just in
[1:10:57] the world. Do eating dog. We should have
[1:10:58] higher level thinking than that. Amen.
[1:11:01] Praying for one another, meditating on
[1:11:02] the word, thinking about how can I how
[1:11:04] can I make my family better? How can I
[1:11:07] be a better better uh believer? How can
[1:11:10] I how can I help my community better?
[1:11:13] Right? Those kind of thoughts, you know,
[1:11:15] how can I, Lord, show me where I where
[1:11:18] my secret faults are,
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; mold and shape me, Lord, meditating on
[1:11:22] his promises, those kind of things. But
[1:11:24] anything else that exalts itself above
[1:11:25] the word of God, you have the power to
[1:11:28] arrest that thing, lock it up, and throw
[1:11:30] away the key.
[1:11:32] Amen. We have that power. Praise the
[1:11:36] Lord. I'm so thankful we do. that we're
[1:11:38] not just this, you know, helpless,
[1:11:41] helpless person, but God's given us
[1:11:43] strength.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. If the Holy Ghost is in you, you
[1:11:46] have power to bring every thought
[1:11:48] captive. Now, an imagination here,
[1:11:50] casting down imaginations. The root word
[1:11:52] of this, well, well, it says it's
[1:11:54] reasoning, but that word there that that
[1:11:56] that this word uh logos, if that's how
[1:11:59] you say it, I'm not Greek, so don't look
[1:12:01] at me. Um, the the root word of that
[1:12:03] means to take an inventory. That's your
[1:12:06] imagination. when your your imaginations
[1:12:08] are, you're actually taking stock of
[1:12:09] things. You're compiling facts. You're
[1:12:12] compiling things and putting it together
[1:12:13] as a picture. See? So, you've got to you
[1:12:16] got to take those things and you've got
[1:12:18] to bring them if they're contrary to the
[1:12:19] word, you got to bring them captive.
[1:12:22] Don't let your mind run wild. You say,
[1:12:24] "Well, I'm a deep thinker and I always
[1:12:25] cross bridges before I get to them."
[1:12:27] Well, stop doing it. Brother Bram says,
[1:12:28] "Stop it.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Stop it. Control your thoughts." You
[1:12:31] know, because the devil always make you
[1:12:33] cross bridges and it's never positive.
[1:12:36] Who's ever had that thought process? It
[1:12:38] always ends up in just some basically a
[1:12:39] big crater and smoke and and fire and a
[1:12:42] big train wreck and it's just that's
[1:12:44] incredibly bad. You don't need to let
[1:12:47] your thoughts go that way. You don't
[1:12:49] need to.
[1:12:51] We should be able to by now because you
[1:12:53] should be able to look at your thinking
[1:12:54] say, "Now I know where this thinking
[1:12:56] gets pear-shaped. Turn left instead of
[1:12:58] right." then
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; take it back into the word of God and
[1:13:02] you'll find your thinking doesn't end up
[1:13:04] in a big crater and smoke and debris and
[1:13:06] terrible things. It actually ends up in
[1:13:09] the promises of God in the reality of
[1:13:11] God. That's where your thinking ends up.
[1:13:13] So you have the power to take every
[1:13:15] thought captive,
[1:13:17] every imagination. You got to take
[1:13:19] inventory. Well, how do you take
[1:13:20] inventory with the word? Take every
[1:13:22] promise of God and accumulate it.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; And that will actually build faith in
[1:13:26] your life. You actually take inventory.
[1:13:28] You can take every promise that God has
[1:13:30] fulfilled and you will you say that can
[1:13:32] take a long time. It's a good time well
[1:13:34] spent. Amen. Cuz you spend now till the
[1:13:37] rapture accumulating promises when it
[1:13:40] becomes real in your heart. I think
[1:13:41] that's a good way to spend our time.
[1:13:44] Praise the Lord. It will change your
[1:13:45] life. It will bless everyone around you.
[1:13:47] Amen. It will change the atmosphere in
[1:13:49] your home if you look at the promise.
[1:13:50] You take an inventory of the promises of
[1:13:52] God. Amen. like um like David, you know,
[1:13:56] you before he died, you know, he uh uh
[1:13:59] here in 1 Chronicles, they were they
[1:14:01] were gathering all the material that
[1:14:03] Solomon needed for the temple and and
[1:14:05] and and David gave basically everything.
[1:14:09] Then the people gave a free will
[1:14:10] offering gladly. And then David would
[1:14:12] say, "Oh Lord our God, all the store
[1:14:14] that we have prepared to build thee and
[1:14:16] house for thine holy name cometh of
[1:14:19] thine hand and is all thine own. I know
[1:14:22] also my God that thou tryest the heart
[1:14:25] and has pleasure in uprightness. As for
[1:14:27] me, in the uprightness of my heart, I
[1:14:29] will willing, I have willingly offered
[1:14:31] all these things. And now have I seen
[1:14:34] with joy thy people which are present
[1:14:36] here to offer willingly unto thee. Oh
[1:14:38] Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and of
[1:14:40] Israel our fathers. Keep this forever in
[1:14:42] the imagination of the thoughts of the
[1:14:44] hearts of thy people, and prepare their
[1:14:46] heart unto thee.
[1:14:49] So what David's praying is Lord keep
[1:14:52] this in their imagination what they've
[1:14:54] just done for the next phase of what's
[1:14:56] going to happen because there's going to
[1:14:57] be hardship there's going to be trouble
[1:14:59] there's going to be trials unexpected
[1:15:01] things but keep this moment keep the
[1:15:04] feeling of this moment keep the
[1:15:05] atmosphere of this moment alive in their
[1:15:07] imaginations when they realize that what
[1:15:09] God has begun he will complete amen so
[1:15:12] keep in your imag keep in your
[1:15:14] imagination how God found you and what
[1:15:16] God's done in your life and how he saved
[1:15:18] you and every promise he's fulfilled in
[1:15:20] your life. Keep that in your
[1:15:21] imagination. Amen. What does it do? It
[1:15:23] keeps faith alive. Amen. It keeps the
[1:15:26] promises. It It doesn't let them go
[1:15:28] stale in your heart. It keeps them alive
[1:15:30] and fresh. Amen. It's just like Paul
[1:15:32] would tell the Philippian jailer,
[1:15:33] "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:15:35] thine and thy house shall be saved." And
[1:15:37] brother Ram takes that. He expands it.
[1:15:39] Says, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:41] for thy house." So the same faith that
[1:15:43] you were given to believe for your own
[1:15:45] salvation now apply that to your family
[1:15:47] and see and that's how you apply the
[1:15:49] token. Amen. So what do you do? You keep
[1:15:51] the you keep the reality of what God did
[1:15:53] in your life alive and then now Lord you
[1:15:56] saved me Lord. I have no idea how you
[1:15:58] did it. It seemed in such an imp such an
[1:16:00] impossible case. Amen. I was going
[1:16:02] against the tide. I was going against
[1:16:04] you as fast as I could. But God you
[1:16:05] turned my heart some way Lord. And I
[1:16:07] know you did it for me. You'll do it for
[1:16:09] them Lord. And your promises oh true.
[1:16:11] I'm so thankful for your blood. What's
[1:16:12] that doing? You're keeping that as an
[1:16:14] imagination alive.
[1:16:17] Praise the Lord. Now, as I said before,
[1:16:20] your senses, uh, everything if it if it
[1:16:24] doesn't agree with the word, then throw
[1:16:25] it away. But if it agrees with the word,
[1:16:27] go for it. So, if you've got senses,
[1:16:29] you've got senses, see, taste, feel,
[1:16:31] smell, and hear, they're all right. But
[1:16:33] don't you trust them unless they agree
[1:16:34] with the word. That's all right. But if
[1:16:37] they disagree with the word, don't
[1:16:38] listen to them. Now, imaginations,
[1:16:40] conscience, memories, reasons, and
[1:16:42] affections, they're all right if they
[1:16:43] agree with the word. But if your
[1:16:45] affection doesn't agree with the word,
[1:16:46] get rid of it. You'll blow a flu right
[1:16:48] quick. See, if your reason disagrees
[1:16:50] with the word, get away from it. That's
[1:16:51] right. The engine in your if your
[1:16:52] memory, if your imaginations, if your
[1:16:54] conscious, anything disagrees with that
[1:16:56] what's on in on the inside, get rid of
[1:16:59] it. What's on the inside? The Holy Ghost
[1:17:02] is on the inside. Amen. Because the word
[1:17:05] of God is more than just ink on paper.
[1:17:07] The word is Christ, the Lord himself.
[1:17:10] Amen. So, so if any of those things
[1:17:12] disagree with what's on the inside, get
[1:17:15] rid of it. And I think we've all had
[1:17:17] those feelings, just that warning bell
[1:17:18] comes up. You start thinking in a
[1:17:20] certain way and it grieves you. Right?
[1:17:24] And to me, the reason it does that, it's
[1:17:26] not just the fact that maybe your
[1:17:27] thoughts are negative, but it's actually
[1:17:28] God saying, "I don't like that.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; I don't want that in my temple. I don't
[1:17:33] want that kind of thought pattern in in
[1:17:35] your life and I'm in you. So, so what's
[1:17:38] God telling you? You need to disagree
[1:17:39] with that thinking
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; and cast it aside.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; See, because we walk by faith and not by
[1:17:46] sight. Amen. So, we walk by revelation.
[1:17:50] This is if the revelation of the word is
[1:17:52] your absolute, you're worshiping the
[1:17:54] right God.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; You have the right idol, if I can put it
[1:17:57] that way. You have the right God you're
[1:17:59] bowing down to. He and if he's your
[1:18:01] absolute then you will walk by the power
[1:18:03] of your absolute. Amen. So we walk by
[1:18:05] revelation. We don't walk by memory. We
[1:18:08] don't walk by feelings. We don't not by
[1:18:10] imaginations not by reasoning. Not by
[1:18:12] what we see, feel, taste, smell, or
[1:18:14] hear. We walk by faith, by revelation.
[1:18:18] And revelation has got to be our
[1:18:20] absolute where the light turns on. Amen.
[1:18:23] When the spirit of truth comes, you see
[1:18:24] it's such a it's such a thing. Jesus
[1:18:27] said when the spirit of truth has come,
[1:18:29] he'll lead you and guide you into all
[1:18:30] truth. He will be your absolute. And so
[1:18:33] what does it so what that means is when
[1:18:36] the so the spirit of truth is God
[1:18:37] himself, the Holy Ghost. And when he
[1:18:39] comes into your life, what does he do?
[1:18:41] He illuminates the scripture. He brings
[1:18:43] it all that it makes sense. See, this is
[1:18:46] this is what we need. More than just a
[1:18:47] teaching, but God to quicken the word to
[1:18:50] our souls. You know, it's like um you
[1:18:52] know, it's like brother brother Ed
[1:18:53] Biscll, you know, when he was when he
[1:18:56] was there, you know, with brother
[1:18:57] Brandham and before he went hunting with
[1:18:58] him, he heard things that brother
[1:19:00] Brandham was teaching. He just didn't
[1:19:01] understand any of it. Thought the
[1:19:02] serpent seed, what a wild idea and
[1:19:04] didn't want to talk about those things
[1:19:06] and you know, so so when he was hunting
[1:19:08] with him, he wasn't like actively
[1:19:10] believing, yes, this is this is Malachi
[1:19:12] 4 and this is this is God doing these
[1:19:14] things. No, he was very skeptical. And
[1:19:16] also at that time, you know, the healing
[1:19:18] revival had basically just just gone
[1:19:20] downhill. Other, you know, you know,
[1:19:22] other ministries had gone into
[1:19:24] intellectualism or they gone into
[1:19:26] prosperity. And so he see so this is Ed
[1:19:29] Biscll's testimony. He said he just saw
[1:19:31] the whole Christian world just seem to
[1:19:32] kind of just just fall apart and all he
[1:19:34] wanted to do is hide up in the
[1:19:36] wilderness somewhere and just and just
[1:19:37] escape all this confusion. And then so
[1:19:40] he was hunting with brother Brandham and
[1:19:42] you know they begin to and you know and
[1:19:44] there's a brother bisc said if he
[1:19:45] bypasses Genesis 4 you know and then
[1:19:48] Adam you know I mean I mean and then
[1:19:50] Adam knew his wife and she conceived you
[1:19:52] know you know and she had Abel and all
[1:19:53] these things um he's just going to he's
[1:19:56] just going to um he's just going to walk
[1:19:59] away. So he wasn't there actively
[1:20:01] believing but then I was sitting on the
[1:20:03] log and brother Bram said you know when
[1:20:04] we were writing back here you know he
[1:20:06] came to me there and said you got three
[1:20:08] questions and and the questions that
[1:20:11] brother Bram gave them was exactly the
[1:20:13] importance in in in brother Biscll's
[1:20:15] heart and they begin to speak about
[1:20:17] those things and begin to speak about
[1:20:19] serpent seed and brother Ed said I
[1:20:21] didn't understand it but he said he
[1:20:22] wasn't just gulping it down he was very
[1:20:24] skeptical because of everything that was
[1:20:25] going on and then brother brother Bram
[1:20:27] said to him brother Eddie I'll pray for
[1:20:28] you you just pray and God will show you.
[1:20:31] And then he found himself under how much
[1:20:33] how many weeks later or whatever time
[1:20:35] later and he's reading 2 Corinthians and
[1:20:38] it says, you know, that you know, I've
[1:20:40] espoused you. I have godly jealousy over
[1:20:43] you. I've espoused you as a chasteed
[1:20:46] virgin to Christ, but I fear least as as
[1:20:48] as the serpent begiled Eve. So another
[1:20:51] spirit will do that to you. And and he
[1:20:53] just saw it from the Genesis to
[1:20:55] Revelation. What happened? The spirit of
[1:20:57] truth came to him and illuminated the
[1:20:59] whole word. And this is really what you
[1:21:01] need is that spirit of truth to come. I
[1:21:04] trust we're all focusing just about now.
[1:21:05] You know, for the spirit of truth to
[1:21:07] come and illuminate the scripture. Amen.
[1:21:10] See, that's what we walk by. And that
[1:21:12] becomes our absolute goes beyond
[1:21:14] reasoning, what you hear, arguments,
[1:21:17] whatever more. No. And that becomes the
[1:21:19] final say in your life. And that's how
[1:21:21] we walk. Amen. By by faith, by
[1:21:24] revelation, not by sight.
[1:21:27] Amen. We're just going to change this a
[1:21:28] little bit here. Now,
[1:21:32] you see what happens is if people don't
[1:21:33] have the Lord as their absolute, then
[1:21:36] they're going to have something else.
[1:21:36] And as I read earlier about how their
[1:21:39] God is their own valley. Now, we were
[1:21:41] talking the other day at home about
[1:21:42] about Christian politicians.
[1:21:45] Okay? Christian politicians. Now, I'm
[1:21:47] not talking about politicians who are
[1:21:49] Christians, okay? In in governments. I'm
[1:21:52] talking about Christians who are
[1:21:54] believers, but they're politically
[1:21:56] minded. So, they're always they're
[1:21:58] always trying to they're always trying
[1:22:00] to uh gain influence by arguments, good
[1:22:04] talking, you know, that you know, it's
[1:22:06] not by substance. And that's what I've
[1:22:07] got here from Jude that their clouds,
[1:22:09] they are without water. Now, if you've
[1:22:12] ever been in a drought and you see a
[1:22:14] cloud come over and there's no rain in
[1:22:16] that thing, it can't it can't quench
[1:22:19] that drought. It's just it looks good.
[1:22:22] It can maybe sound good, you know, but
[1:22:25] there's no substance in it. There's no
[1:22:27] water to refresh. There's nothing in
[1:22:28] that cloud that can that can help
[1:22:31] anybody. And it's like a Christian
[1:22:32] politician. They have no Holy Ghost to
[1:22:35] feed the people. They've got no power of
[1:22:38] God within their words to actually feed
[1:22:39] the sheep and feed the lambs. And you
[1:22:42] see this is this is a very sad thing
[1:22:44] because they're absolute because a
[1:22:45] politician's absolute is reasoning. It's
[1:22:48] their own selfish motives. You know,
[1:22:49] everyone in parliament, they're not one
[1:22:51] big unified group. You know, you see a
[1:22:53] party begins to collapse and troubles
[1:22:55] and they go down in the polls. What do
[1:22:57] the other members of the cabinet do?
[1:22:58] They begin to get their knives out. How
[1:23:00] can I become the prime minister? How can
[1:23:02] I become deputy? I want to be the
[1:23:04] minister of finance. I've been waiting
[1:23:05] all my life and now's my chance. I'm
[1:23:07] going to because the economy that
[1:23:09] they're not unified. It's not like if we
[1:23:11] fall, we all fall together. It's like,
[1:23:13] no, who can we push off the boat that I
[1:23:15] can take their place? That's Christian
[1:23:17] politicians, too. They're trying to
[1:23:18] murder the influences of people by
[1:23:21] talking and debate and argument, but
[1:23:23] they have nothing to feed the people.
[1:23:25] They won't that they will never say
[1:23:27] things straight. A politician is so
[1:23:30] teflon coded they'll they'll be asked a
[1:23:32] very simple question and 20 minutes
[1:23:34] later you've just heard a bunch of uh
[1:23:36] word salad. It's just just just be
[1:23:39] straight.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Just be honest. What do you think about
[1:23:42] this current well blah blah blah blah
[1:23:43] blah blah blah blah blah. No, no, no.
[1:23:45] And and and a Christian politician will
[1:23:47] stand in a pullpit or be in a fellowship
[1:23:49] and they'll never say things straight.
[1:23:51] They'll say things in a roundabout way
[1:23:52] that you'll be guessing, well, what are
[1:23:54] they really meaning? Because they have
[1:23:56] nothing to feed you with. Amen. But a
[1:23:58] real But a real Christian will can say
[1:24:01] things straight. Amen. They will say
[1:24:03] things. Yeah. The prophet wasn't a
[1:24:05] politician. He did not say things in a
[1:24:08] roundabout way. He said it very direct.
[1:24:10] Amen. And what will they do? They will
[1:24:12] murder the influence of godly people.
[1:24:15] to to make themselves look less bad, to
[1:24:17] try and try and satisfy their own
[1:24:19] conscience, and they will explain away
[1:24:21] the supernatural, explain away what God
[1:24:23] is doing because it doesn't further
[1:24:25] their own ends.
[1:24:27] And what does this spirit do? It
[1:24:29] actually pinches the very life out of
[1:24:31] the church. See, when I read this, you
[1:24:33] know, if God sent the Messiah, he'd be
[1:24:35] exactly word by word of the Bible,
[1:24:37] exactly what he was at the first time,
[1:24:38] the cry of the word. When you see
[1:24:40] politicians and everything else pinching
[1:24:42] out the very life of the church, to me,
[1:24:44] that's not the government. It's people
[1:24:46] within the church pinching the life out.
[1:24:48] See, there's a there's a saying, you
[1:24:49] know, back in the sailing days, you
[1:24:51] know, you know, there'll be two ships
[1:24:52] coming along and they're going to fly
[1:24:53] their colors. What team are you on? What
[1:24:56] nation are you fighting for? You know,
[1:24:58] but a politician will be, oh, yeah, I'm
[1:24:59] kind of for it and yes, and you know, he
[1:25:01] made mistakes here and this is a problem
[1:25:03] and you know, and they talk in a
[1:25:04] roundabout way. Are you for the word or
[1:25:06] against the word?
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Strike up your colors. You know, let's
[1:25:08] be honest about it. But you see, what
[1:25:11] happens is it pinches the very life out
[1:25:13] of the church.
[1:25:16] You see, a cloud without water, you can
[1:25:19] see it very much in election year. It
[1:25:21] becomes a lolly scramble of promises.
[1:25:24] All promises are no substance. Well, if
[1:25:26] you vote us in, we'll do this and we'll
[1:25:27] do this and and they give promises to
[1:25:29] try and get the biggest demographic of
[1:25:31] votes, but there's no substance in it.
[1:25:33] You know how many how many governments
[1:25:36] they promise things and it never
[1:25:38] happens,
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; but oh yeah, if yeah, they're going to
[1:25:41] do it. And and they say, "Well, you just
[1:25:43] misunderstood us last time. This year we
[1:25:45] really do it." You know, YOU
[1:25:48] WE'VE CHANGED. GIVE US ANOTHER CHANCE.
[1:25:51] You just misunderstand me. No, there
[1:25:53] should be a track record. I'm talking
[1:25:55] about believers. I'm not I'm not even
[1:25:56] talking about the beehive. I'm talking
[1:25:57] about believers. A track record should
[1:25:59] stand for something. someone who's been
[1:26:01] solid in and out, you know, in ter up
[1:26:04] and down in terms of good times, bad
[1:26:06] times, but they're a solid Christian.
[1:26:08] They're a believer and they've just
[1:26:10] become more like Christ and God has
[1:26:12] anointed and proved himself in their
[1:26:14] lives. That kind of track record should
[1:26:15] stand for something. But a to but a
[1:26:18] politician will try and explain that
[1:26:19] away because they have nothing to feed
[1:26:21] the people.
[1:26:23] I mean, they will murder reputations.
[1:26:26] They will try and do those things. Why?
[1:26:28] Unfortunately, they're a cloud without
[1:26:29] water. And unfortunately, the God they
[1:26:31] worship is not the God. Because if their
[1:26:34] God was the word, then there would be a
[1:26:36] cloud with water.
[1:26:38] Amen.
[1:26:41] You take one for example who wasn't a
[1:26:42] politician. Elijah was no politician. He
[1:26:45] was not a cloud without water. Amen. He
[1:26:48] said, "There's fire. The true God will
[1:26:50] answer by fire." The true God answered
[1:26:52] by fire. Amen. He wasn't He wasn't uh He
[1:26:55] didn't give an empty promise of a
[1:26:56] showdown and we're going to do this
[1:26:57] thing. No. He said, "This is what's
[1:26:59] going to happen." And it happened
[1:27:01] exactly that way. Amen. What happened?
[1:27:03] God answered by fire. And then after
[1:27:06] that, he said, "Now I hear the sound of
[1:27:09] abundance of rain." Amen. So, so what
[1:27:12] did he do? He didn't have an empty
[1:27:14] promise that rain was going to come.
[1:27:15] Rain came. Amen. And the reason he could
[1:27:19] stand like this is because his God truly
[1:27:21] was Jehovah like Elijah means. Amen. His
[1:27:24] absolute was revelation. It wasn't
[1:27:26] politics. It wasn't anything else. It
[1:27:28] wasn't his reasoning. It wasn't his
[1:27:30] imagination. It wasn't his conscience.
[1:27:32] It wasn't any of those things. It was
[1:27:34] revelation by the word. Amen. And so
[1:27:37] this is and this is what he did. Now he
[1:27:39] said he said, "Now I hear the sound of
[1:27:41] abundance of rain." And then and then
[1:27:44] finally on the seventh time the pardon
[1:27:46] me, the um servant went out. So I'm just
[1:27:48] trying to wrap up here. He said, "I see
[1:27:50] like I see a cloud like a man's hand."
[1:27:53] And then he told then he told um Ahab,
[1:27:56] you better get down to Jezrael because
[1:27:58] it's going to you know you know because
[1:27:59] there's going to be rain. So his message
[1:28:01] changed. I was thinking about this
[1:28:03] brother Mach on Wednesday about look
[1:28:05] right. So first he said look for fire
[1:28:07] and there was fire. Fire came. Wasn't
[1:28:10] wasn't some empty promise. It really
[1:28:12] happened. Then he said look for a cloud.
[1:28:14] Amen. And the cloud appeared. Amen. And
[1:28:16] then he said now rain's coming and it
[1:28:18] rained. Amen. So there was a shift in
[1:28:20] what was happening. It was the same
[1:28:22] voice, but Elijah had a track record.
[1:28:25] Amen. He said, "No rain or dewy will
[1:28:27] come until I call for it." And there was
[1:28:29] a drought. You know, he got fed by the
[1:28:31] ravens, went to actually Jezebel's um
[1:28:33] homeland and got fed there by the widow
[1:28:35] of Zerapath. And then, you know, all
[1:28:37] those things happened. He had a track
[1:28:39] record of God speaking to him and God
[1:28:41] doing what God spoke to him. And then
[1:28:44] finally, he came down and he, you know,
[1:28:45] they had the um uh show down there on
[1:28:48] Mount Carmel and there was fire. Fire
[1:28:50] came, cloud came, you know, rain came. I
[1:28:53] mean, there was a change in ministry of
[1:28:55] now the rain is coming. I mean, so no
[1:28:58] doubt, no doubt the people of Israel,
[1:29:00] they begin to get their water pots out.
[1:29:02] Amen. But why? Because there's now a
[1:29:04] change going on. I mean, it was no
[1:29:06] longer just, it was no longer just, you
[1:29:08] know, there's a drought and things are
[1:29:10] bad and yes, Jezebel's evil and look at
[1:29:13] it's the mark of the beast and the
[1:29:15] denomination. It went from beyond that.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. It went now. It's going to rain.
[1:29:20] And then now what has happened in this
[1:29:22] day? Actually, let's just let's just go
[1:29:23] here. No, we'll go ahead then we'll go
[1:29:25] back again.
[1:29:27] We had Elijah in this day. We saw the
[1:29:30] fire.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; And it was more than the photograph. To
[1:29:32] me, it's not even the photograph that
[1:29:34] really matters. It's actually what did
[1:29:36] that pillar of fire do in the meetings.
[1:29:38] Even his even his critics said when the
[1:29:40] angel of the Lord came down, there was
[1:29:41] such a holiness that they never felt
[1:29:43] before. It was one of the founding
[1:29:45] members of some churches here in New
[1:29:46] Zealand. It might be Elim. I might be
[1:29:48] totally wrong, but he was he was in some
[1:29:51] of the meetings of brother Brandham. He
[1:29:52] said when the angel of the Lord came
[1:29:53] down, he tried to hide behind the pew.
[1:29:56] That's how that's how awesome that
[1:29:58] presence was. And we were in South
[1:29:59] Africa in 2019 speaking to brother Villy
[1:30:02] Retif and he said when that presence
[1:30:04] came, he got tears in his eyes. The
[1:30:06] awesome presence of God.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; He said if people were ever in that
[1:30:10] presence, I'd never question this
[1:30:11] message again.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what did it do? It came down.
[1:30:15] It healed people. Open the eyes of the
[1:30:17] blind, raise the dead, open the word.
[1:30:20] Amen. Changed people's lives. The Holy
[1:30:22] Ghost was poured out. Amen. And we've
[1:30:23] seen the cloud.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what is it doing now? Now it's
[1:30:27] raining.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Now it's raining. God is pouring out his
[1:30:30] spirit more and more. Amen. So now,
[1:30:32] friends, we got to change what we're
[1:30:34] doing. And I believe already changed.
[1:30:35] Now get your water pot out.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let your expectation rise. Amen.
[1:30:40] Dust off your vessel. Amen. Put it out.
[1:30:42] Amen. INTO THE ATMOSPHERE OF GOD. WHY?
[1:30:44] BECAUSE, AMEN, the fire's come. God's
[1:30:47] proven his word over and over again.
[1:30:49] Amen. The cloud has arrived. Amen. And
[1:30:52] now it's raining. There's an abundance
[1:30:53] of rain. I mean, it's not some trickle
[1:30:56] of the Holy Ghost, some little mist
[1:30:57] THAT'S COME. NO, IT'S A MONSOON SEASON,
[1:30:59] FRIENDS. God is pouring his spirit out
[1:31:01] more and more and more.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our prophet, this message is not a
[1:31:07] cloud without water. No, this message is
[1:31:10] a sound of abundance of rain. And I'll
[1:31:12] tell you what, friends, in 2026, it is
[1:31:14] raining. God is pouring out his word.
[1:31:17] He's quickening his promises. I mean,
[1:31:19] he's making his promises alive. God is
[1:31:21] moving. That's why when we go from our
[1:31:22] first camp to our latest camp, God's
[1:31:24] just turned it up,
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; poured it out more, changed like the
[1:31:28] nozzle on the shower. IT'S JUST GOTTEN
[1:31:30] bigger and greater and greater. And our
[1:31:32] and God is lining our lives up with his
[1:31:34] word more and more and more. Why? Cuz
[1:31:37] there is the It is raining.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If only I went back
[1:31:41] there. even though it's raining now.
[1:31:43] Amen. This is a blessed more blessed
[1:31:45] time to live now than it was, Amen. when
[1:31:47] the message first came. Why? Cuz God has
[1:31:50] given us the spirit of truth to see the
[1:31:52] message in the Bible. Amen. To see that
[1:31:55] to take us back that our me that our
[1:31:57] absolute is this.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. That it's not our
[1:32:02] feelings, our reasoning, someone's
[1:32:04] arguments, their emotions. No, it's the
[1:32:06] word of God is our absolute. And it's
[1:32:08] the word of God that we worship. Yes,
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; we bow down. We don't we don't worship a
[1:32:13] prophet. We don't worship a theory. We
[1:32:15] don't worship some doctrines. We don't
[1:32:17] worship a movement. We worship Jesus
[1:32:19] Christ, the living word. He is our God.
[1:32:22] He is the one we bow ourselves down to.
[1:32:24] He is our He has the final say in all of
[1:32:27] our lives.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And I see I'm sure you
[1:32:31] can see that in your own life that he is
[1:32:33] my absolute.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; It's not my feelings though they're
[1:32:35] there or my reasoning though there or my
[1:32:37] memory, my conscious, my affections. So
[1:32:39] that it goes through all of that that
[1:32:41] comes to the solid rock, amen, of the
[1:32:43] word of God and it settles on there and
[1:32:45] that's where my decisions come from can
[1:32:48] go all different kind of ways but it
[1:32:49] comes down to that absolute of my life.
[1:32:52] I tell you what, if he's your absolute,
[1:32:54] you live by the power of that absolute.
[1:32:56] I mean, if it's reason is your absolute,
[1:32:58] that's as that's as high as you can
[1:33:00] live. Tell you what, my reasoning isn't
[1:33:01] very strong or my memory or my
[1:33:04] imagination, any of those things. But if
[1:33:06] he is your absolute, he is ultimate in
[1:33:08] power. He's unlimited in potential.
[1:33:10] Amen. He can do all things. Amen. He
[1:33:12] does the impossible. Our God can do all
[1:33:15] things. So if he is your absolute, then
[1:33:17] nothing is impossible with you. All
[1:33:19] things are possible to them that
[1:33:20] believe.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Brother Bram said, "The
[1:33:23] dynamics of this church will be a
[1:33:25] refilling of the Holy Ghost." that we
[1:33:27] have worked in a small measure while the
[1:33:29] headstones coming down to unite with the
[1:33:30] body. But when the head and the body
[1:33:32] unites together, the full power of the
[1:33:34] Holy Ghost would would rise her up just
[1:33:36] exactly like that. Even the dead that's
[1:33:39] dead in Christ for hundreds of years ago
[1:33:41] will rise up in the beauty of his
[1:33:42] holiness and take a flight to the skies.
[1:33:44] The dynamics is the Holy Ghost. Amen. So
[1:33:47] what is this now? We are living in the
[1:33:49] season of this refilling. I mean God
[1:33:51] pouring out his spirit more and more. I
[1:33:54] mean why? Because the head and the body
[1:33:55] has become united. Amen. You become one
[1:33:58] with Jesus Christ. You are the body.
[1:34:00] He's the head. You become one unit in
[1:34:02] Christ Jesus the word. Amen. So what's
[1:34:04] he doing? He's pouring out his spirit
[1:34:05] more and more. That's why we love the
[1:34:07] word of God. Amen. And we don't separate
[1:34:10] the dynamics from the mechanics. We
[1:34:11] believe they got to be the same unit.
[1:34:13] Like the atonement. Brother Meshach had
[1:34:15] that wonderful quote about can't people
[1:34:16] see the other side of the atonement?
[1:34:18] It's not just salvation, but it's
[1:34:19] healing. I mean, there's the full
[1:34:21] atonement is what we believe cuz we
[1:34:22] believe the full word. Amen. Salvation's
[1:34:25] in the atonement. We believe that. Amen.
[1:34:27] Forgiveness of sins is in the atonement.
[1:34:28] We believe that. Redemption, healing,
[1:34:30] deliverance, the body change, our
[1:34:32] families coming in, miracles, signs, and
[1:34:34] wonders, THE GIFTS, EVERY PROMISE OF GOD
[1:34:37] IS IN THE ATONEMENT. And we believe the
[1:34:39] whole thing.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have just part of it.
[1:34:43] Now, what was the vindication of? What
[1:34:45] was the vindication of John the Baptist
[1:34:46] ministry? He wasn't a cloud without
[1:34:48] water. Amen. What was his vindication?
[1:34:50] Behold the lamb of God that takes away
[1:34:52] the sin of the world. He didn't say
[1:34:54] anything in a roundabout way. He said,
[1:34:55] "You generation of vipers, you know, he
[1:34:57] didn't he didn't say thing." No, he he
[1:34:59] just said it straight. Amen. Because he
[1:35:01] wasn't a politician. Praise the Lord. He
[1:35:03] had the spirit of Elijah. And what did
[1:35:04] he do? He pointed out the lamb of God.
[1:35:06] So So So what was the vindication of his
[1:35:08] ministry? God and flesh. That was the
[1:35:11] vindication of his ministry. Amen. Now,
[1:35:14] now what was what was the vindication?
[1:35:16] What was the vindication of Jesus'
[1:35:18] ministry? Trying Jerusalem to endure
[1:35:21] with power from on high. So what
[1:35:23] happened after he dead, you know, he
[1:35:25] died, he rose, resurrected, went up into
[1:35:27] glory, sent his holy ghost, what was the
[1:35:29] vindication of his ministry? God in
[1:35:31] redeemed flesh.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the vindication Jesus is
[1:35:35] true. Why? Because God dwelt in his
[1:35:37] people.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. What was the
[1:35:40] vindication of the Apostle Paul's
[1:35:42] ministry? If I have been not an apostle
[1:35:44] unto the others, yet doubtless I am to
[1:35:46] you. For the seal of my apostilhip is
[1:35:48] that ye are in the Lord. That was the
[1:35:50] proof of his ministry. Not that they
[1:35:52] formed churches, not that they believed
[1:35:53] in new doctrine, not that they just
[1:35:55] confessed the cross. No, that they
[1:35:57] received the Holy Ghost. It wasn't just
[1:35:59] those things. It was that God dwelt in
[1:36:01] them cuz that's how you get in the Lord.
[1:36:03] So the So, so the vindication, the
[1:36:05] Apostle Paul's doctrine, his teaching,
[1:36:07] his life, his ministry was God in
[1:36:10] redeemed flesh. Praise the Lord. Now,
[1:36:12] what is the what is the what is the
[1:36:15] vindication of this message? It's more
[1:36:18] than a photograph.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; That's a painted fire, friends. I'm
[1:36:21] sorry. You can't you can't get warmed by
[1:36:22] it. Or a cloud picture. What is the
[1:36:25] vindication? All those things are true.
[1:36:27] I believe those things. BUT WHAT'S THE
[1:36:28] VINDICATION? GOD AND REDEEMED FLESH.
[1:36:31] AMEN. The word put on flesh again in you
[1:36:33] and I. The bride of Jesus Christ
[1:36:34] becoming one with the word. That's the
[1:36:36] vindication. I mean that WE HAVE GONE
[1:36:38] BACK TO THE POWER OF THE Pentecostal
[1:36:40] blessing. Amen. But the doctrine of Paul
[1:36:42] that we're not tossed to and fro
[1:36:44] anymore. We know in whom we have
[1:36:46] believed. Amen. We have the dynamics and
[1:36:48] the mechanics running together. We have
[1:36:50] the full promise.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; That is the vindication this message
[1:36:54] works. I tell you what, you ever have a
[1:36:55] question, ask me my testimony.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; What did it? Reading the Bible and
[1:36:59] listening to brother Baron.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Anglican church shouldn't do it.
[1:37:02] Presbyterian church didn't do it.
[1:37:03] Pentecostal church didn't do it.
[1:37:05] Charismatic church didn't do it. I was
[1:37:06] in those things
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; when I heard good good evening friends.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach on the seal of God
[1:37:11] today. Why why so many people are tossed
[1:37:14] about all those kind of things.
[1:37:18] And it did what it said it would do.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AMEN. YOU SHALL RECEIVE THE
[1:37:23] HOLY GHOST. GOD WILL LIVE IN YOU AND
[1:37:25] CHANGE YOUR LIFE. THE WORD WILL COME AND
[1:37:26] YOU BOOK YOU. AMEN. YOU'LL WALK IN
[1:37:28] POWER. YOU'LL HAVE OVERCOMING POWER.
[1:37:30] YOU'LL HAVE VICTORY. AMEN. You will have
[1:37:32] victory to stand on every neck of the
[1:37:34] enemy.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; I've seen it happen.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Since 2007.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; That's a while now. I'm getting a bit
[1:37:42] long in the tooth. It works and it holds
[1:37:44] and it keeps.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God said, "Amen."
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; And if Christ is your absolute, you're
[1:37:53] tied to him in that manner. No matter
[1:37:56] what anybody says, how hard the
[1:37:57] persecution gets, how bad the storm
[1:37:59] seems to be, how it looks impossible for
[1:38:01] it to happen, if something has if
[1:38:03] something has happened in you that
[1:38:05] Christ becomes your absolute, or any
[1:38:07] promise in the Bible becomes your
[1:38:08] absolute. If you're sick and you're
[1:38:10] praying for healing and something be
[1:38:12] becomes to that, strike that promise in
[1:38:14] the Bible, I've got it. then there's
[1:38:15] nothing gonna wave it from you. Why?
[1:38:18] Because he's your absolute. Now, praise
[1:38:21] the Lord. I'll get to Paul. Well, let's
[1:38:23] just briefly talk about him. He had an
[1:38:26] absolute. Wasn't his learning. Wasn't a
[1:38:29] theory. It was the living God living in
[1:38:32] him. And God said, "You going to Rome?"
[1:38:34] He was going to Rome. Right after this,
[1:38:36] we read it in family prayer. Right after
[1:38:38] this, there's, I think, 40 odd uh Jewish
[1:38:40] men bound themselves under a curse. They
[1:38:42] weren't going to eat or drink till they
[1:38:44] killed Paul. So, as soon as Paul, you
[1:38:46] know, God tells Paul, "P Paul, you're
[1:38:47] going to Rome?" The devil stirs up all
[1:38:49] this trouble. Did it stop him going to
[1:38:51] Rome? Didn't stop him going to Rome. Did
[1:38:53] shipwreck stop him going to Rome? Didn't
[1:38:55] stop him going to Rome. Did getting
[1:38:56] bitten by a poisonous snake stop him
[1:38:58] going to Rome? Didn't stop him going to
[1:39:00] Rome. Cuz God said, "You're going to
[1:39:01] Rome." Amen. So, his absolute was
[1:39:03] greater than what he saw, he felt, he
[1:39:05] heard, his imagination, his reason, HIS
[1:39:07] CONSCIENCE. ANY OF THOSE THINGS. HE
[1:39:09] BROUGHT THAT ALL SUBJECT to the absolute
[1:39:11] in his life was God said, "I'm going to
[1:39:13] Rome,
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; friends. We're going more to Italy.
[1:39:16] We're going to we're going to glory."
[1:39:18] Amen. Through this message, God says,
[1:39:20] "You're going in a rapture." Amen. Your
[1:39:22] body's going to be changed. Amen. So,
[1:39:23] what does that do? That becomes an
[1:39:25] absolute in our life. And it's not
[1:39:27] because I've said it or the prophet said
[1:39:28] it, God told you. Amen. It becomes an
[1:39:30] absolute. So, no matter what happens,
[1:39:32] I'm going to come out the other side in
[1:39:34] an immortal, eternal, glorified body. So
[1:39:37] whatever happens between there and here
[1:39:39] and there, the devil can't stop me
[1:39:41] getting there.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; So let's have the musicians today. But
[1:39:47] aren't you thankful we have an absolute
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; the word of God living in you more than
[1:39:52] our reasoning, more than a collection of
[1:39:54] scriptures or quotes. It's the living
[1:39:56] God who makes those scriptures and
[1:39:58] quotes alive.
[1:40:00] Praise the Lord.
[1:40:03] So I put a summary in
[1:40:06] that in order to truly worship God, one
[1:40:08] must have his word as their ultimate,
[1:40:10] their absolute above everything else.
[1:40:12] That's true worship. What do you what's
[1:40:14] your ultimate in your life? It's got to
[1:40:16] be above their feelings, your reasoning,
[1:40:18] your memory, your affections, your
[1:40:20] imagination. It's got to be above all
[1:40:22] things because whatever has the final
[1:40:25] say in your life is your God. It can be
[1:40:27] you. It can be your heart, can be your
[1:40:29] feelings, can be what others say about
[1:40:30] you. But whatever has the final say in
[1:40:33] your life is what you're worshiping. I
[1:40:37] pray the Lord Jesus Christ has the final
[1:40:39] say in your life. His word rules above
[1:40:43] everything. Amen. Let's stand to our
[1:40:45] feet this morning. So I've kept you a
[1:40:48] bit today.
[1:40:50] Amen.
[1:40:54] Amen.
[1:40:56] He's a wonderful God.
[1:40:58] Like can we sing that song? He makes a
[1:41:00] way. There ain't no way.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Let my Jesus change your life. I love
[1:41:04] that song.
[1:41:16] Are you past the point of weery? Is your
[1:41:20] burden weighing heavy? Is it all too
[1:41:24] much to carry?
[1:41:27] Let me tell you about my Jesus. Do you
[1:41:30] feel that empty feeling? No. Change all
[1:41:35] the ceiling and you're desperate for
[1:41:39] some healing.
[1:41:41] Let me tell you about my Jesus.
[1:41:47] He makes a way where there ain't no way.
[1:41:51] Rises up from an empty grave. Ain't no
[1:41:55] sinner that he can save. Let me tell you
[1:41:59] about my Jesus. His love is strong and
[1:42:03] his praise is free. And the good news is
[1:42:06] I know that he can do for you what he's
[1:42:10] done for me. Oh, let me tell you about
[1:42:13] my Jesus.
[1:42:15] Let my Jesus change your life.
[1:42:21] Hallelujah.
[1:42:24] Hallelujah.
[1:42:27] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:42:31] Amen.
[1:42:33] Wipe away the tears from broken dreams
[1:42:37] and waves and tears until the past
[1:42:41] disappear. Oh, let me tell you about my
[1:42:45] Jesus and all the wrong things that you
[1:42:50] going to do with you.
[1:42:54] working out for you.
[1:43:00] He makes way
[1:43:24] for me. Let me tell you about my
[1:43:29] Jesus.
[1:43:34] Hallelujah.
[1:43:38] Hallelujah.
[1:43:41] Hallelujah.
[1:43:44] Hallelujah.
[1:43:48] Hallelujah.

[1:44:06] Hallelujah.
[1:44:10] Hallelujah.

[1:44:27] Amen.
[1:44:29] For take my cross to count.
[1:44:32] Pay the price of all my guilt.
[1:44:36] Who would care that much about me?
[1:44:40] Let me tell you about my Jesus.
[1:44:45] Oh, he makes the way where there ain't
[1:44:49] no way. He rises up from an empty grave.
[1:44:54] Ain't no sinner that he can't save. Oh,
[1:44:58] let me tell you about my Jesus. His love
[1:45:02] is strong and gracious.
[1:45:05] Jesus
[1:45:08] to do for you what he's done for me. Oh,
[1:45:12] let me tell you about my Jesus.
[1:45:16] My Jesus.
[1:45:21] Hallelujah.

[1:50:49] bow our heads in a word of prayer. And
[1:50:50] if you want to be remembered, say,
[1:50:51] "Lord, I want you to be my absolute. Not
[1:50:54] my feelings, not my conscience, my
[1:50:56] reasoning, affection, memory, none of
[1:50:58] those things. Lord, I want to worship
[1:51:00] you in spirit and in truth. And almighty
[1:51:02] God, you see the hands that have been
[1:51:04] raised. Lord, I place both mine up this
[1:51:06] morning. I want you to be the one I
[1:51:08] worship, Lord. The one I bow down to,
[1:51:11] the one who has the final say in my
[1:51:13] life, in every situation. May it not be
[1:51:16] me, Lord. May it be you, dear God. In
[1:51:19] the name of Jesus Christ, I pray for
[1:51:21] everyone here, Lord Jesus, that you
[1:51:23] would be their absolute Lord. Your word
[1:51:25] would be the foundation they're built
[1:51:26] upon, Lord. That is the is the thing
[1:51:29] that brings, Lord, their reasoning,
[1:51:32] Lord, that the thing that Lord controls
[1:51:33] their entire life is your word. May they
[1:51:36] not live by how they feel or what
[1:51:38] they're going through or what they see,
[1:51:40] but may they live by your word, Lord, in
[1:51:41] Jesus Christ's name. May you be the
[1:51:43] absolute in our lives. We love you,
[1:51:45] Lord. We thank you for this day, Father.
[1:51:47] We praise your holy name, Lord. And
[1:51:49] father, as you told those Joshua told
[1:51:51] those five men to stand on the necks of
[1:51:53] those kings, Lord, I believe, Lord God,
[1:51:55] we're in the season of victory where
[1:51:57] everything that's contrary to your word
[1:51:58] must be under our feet, Lord. And may it
[1:52:01] start in us, Lord Jesus. Lord, we don't
[1:52:03] want to be, Lord, we know we are our
[1:52:05] greatest enemy is us. So, Father, we
[1:52:08] want to be crucified. We want to die out
[1:52:10] to ourselves, Lord. That you can live,
[1:52:13] that you can do things we know nothing
[1:52:14] about. Thank you, Lord. We love you so
[1:52:17] much. Thank you for your blood. Thank
[1:52:18] you for your cleansing flow that makes
[1:52:21] us white as snow that makes us more like
[1:52:22] you. Bless each one here. Father, as we
[1:52:24] go our separate ways, we go out lunch
[1:52:26] and into the week, different things
[1:52:27] we're going through, be with us, Lord.
[1:52:29] Be our absolute and every everyday life
[1:52:31] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, friends. Amen.
