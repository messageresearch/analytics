========================================

[Music] for [Music] than [Music] good morning welcome to church this morning amen it's good to be able to worship God this morning I believe we're in for a great time anytime we meet with God it's always a great time amen amen so and I don't believe that we've met here in vain the Lord said we are two or three are gathered together in my name there I in the midst and I always like the verse in the Bible that where Paul says you know we don't follow cunningly devised fables this is not just a made up thing this is a reality that we can meet the Living God this morning we haven't made all this effort to drive here and set all this up just to for some little occasion but we actually are meeting with the Living God this morning we're in an atmosphere where God can change us and the more that we just accept that and we grasp that and enter by faith then the more we get out of it amen you know because Satan's whole job is to convince us that it's not true that all and to to to make us not enter in by faith but all we have to do is keep entering in by faith and we just receive a blessing you know so so that's the that's the that's the way we're coming this morning and and I believe we're going to um the worship is going to be good the praise and we're going to hear from the Lord this morning in the ministry of the word of God Hey Brother Pedro didn't see you there how are you

standing so he's going to be holding the for so there'll be a service here on Sunday morning amen so God bless you all all those who are traveling up to the convention May the Lord be with you and may and if you're not may the Lord be with you as well so amen so let's just um go to the scripture this morning we're going to go to Luke uh chapter 18 going to read a couple of places here and then we're going to go to Joshua I want to continue my thought from last Sunday about the giban ites and um this is this is a beit uh yeah this will be a bit of a different one but hey here we are so Luke um 18 and: 10-14 says here two men went up into the temple to pray the one a Pharisee and the other a Publican the Pharisees stood and betrayed thus with himself God I thank thee for I'm not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this Publican I fast twice in the week I give tithes of all that I possess and the Publican standing a far off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smoted upon his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner I tell you this man went down to his house Justified rather than the other for everyone that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted amen and we're just going to go to Joshua chapter 9 again as well um going to read here just about these these these deceitful ones and the most deceitful gibian is the one that looks like you it's easy to say about false Doctrine and cold formal spirits and all those things we covered last Sunday but when the Gib knite looks like you it's a different thing and um so Joshua 9 that's kind of where I'm going today this is going to be a bit different I think but anyway Joshua 9 and verses 3 to6 and when the inhabitants of gibian heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to AI they did work uh willly however you say and went and made as it uh made as if they had been ambassadors and took old sacks from their asses and wine bottles old and rent and bound up and old shoes and and clouded um upon their feet and old garments upon them and all the bread of their Provisions was dry and moldy and they went to Joshua unto the unto the camp of gilgal and said unto him and to the men of Israel we become come from a far country now therefore make ye a league with us amen so let's bow our heads for prayer this morning if you want to be remembered just want to raise your hand to the Lord this morning gracious father we're so thankful Lord truly you are the the Great and Mighty almighty God and I pray father you'd open our spiritual eyes to see you in your place where you belong oh God the highest Place Lord I pray you would be exalted in the service as we have come together this morning Lord we truly desire that you'll come and touch our hearts like only you can Lord may you walk the aisles Lord walk every every seat touch every life from the oldest of us to the youngest of us oh God from the speaker to hearer Lord have your way those who are watching Dear God I pray you'll Lord may you just move in great power Lord For Your Glory and we just want to commit the service into your hands may you be with us Lord a very personal way today we thank you for this opportunity we can gather together and Worship You Lord we want to worship you in spirit and in truth so may have your way Among Us Lord we love you we thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats this morning so I want to speak about the idol of a flawed self now these gibian nightes we know they were the reason I'm putting them in the same category of person is because they came in by deception and it's amazing when when when we look at how man man has been made and constructed by God but yet people people will allow Idols to come into their heart and they will worship they will walk their whole life because of an idol now Christine's parents they knew a I could say Christine Stephany and Elana's parents uh praise the Lord reing family reunion I like it amen they knew a man that was a Christian of some sort but this man would never get married uh uh because of how his mother treated him and how his father uh was a distant man and and the whole reason that he refused to get married is because he didn't want to give his parents' grandchildren because it would bring them joy and the Lord spoke to uh Christine's mom and said this man is worshiping the idol of a broken heart now so I could say he had a flawed image in front of him that he was actually worshiping see we understand that Idols aren't naturally made of stone or wood or you know something man constructed physic physically but they are a thing in a spirit that can come in through pain or hurt or whatever it is but there's an idol that can come into the person's heart yet they are Christians but yet they will worship they will walk with God through these things so this man would it's amazing when you think about it he would he would because of because of this Idol of a broken heart he would refuse to even have the idea of getting married he would he would refuse even maybe have conversations with with maybe potential you know spouses he wouldn't he wouldn't enter into conversations with them he wouldn't go into deeper conversations with them he wouldn't allow his heart to come open you know all these things he would cut off a big section of his life just because of this Idol now you say that that that is a great tragedy and to me that is a great tragedy but to me it's also a great tragedy where a where a person can be sitting in church they can be they can be believing this message and they can they can you know be be be a believer but yet on the inside they can be worshiping a flawed image of themselves and this is this is why I said the giban that's the most deceitful one is the one that looks like you and we know that the devil will never put an image in front of us that is of Victory as of peace and joy and everything that the Lord died that we would possess he would never put that in front of us but he will put something that is always degraded always broken remember he is the perverter he cannot create anything new he's not a Creator he'll take what God has made and will pervert it that's why this world is in this chaos that's in is because because the devil took righteousness and brought sin in and brought perversion and so he will bring into our minds a perverted image of what a Christian should be yet yet it may look all all all on the outward fine you may tick a lot of boxes outwardly and speak the part and play the part and do all those things but on the inside there is a very different kind of an idol than you know it's not God on the inside there's a there's a complex that's coming a pain or a hurt or something that that that that man has allowed to enter into a person and um defiles him isn't it amazing when you look at this man see see this Pharisee he wasn't in the temple to worship God at all even though he was standing in the temple and it looked like he was praying but you see he was actually worshiping an image of himself he was he was exalting what he had become and we know as the Bride of Jesus Christ if we truly have the Revelation that we are his bride it makes us very humble people am me because we see his Supreme Grace would reach down his hand way down into the mac andm and darkness of sin and pull us out and wash us and cleanse us and make us new creatures and you know you know you when when you really realize what the Lord has done you cannot be proud you cannot be arrogant at all but it makes you humble and so thankful that God would find you and not just find you but drag you out and deliver you and do a mighty Deliverance in your life and change you forever more but you see this man see this is what Idols do see he says he prayed thus with himself so he separated himself from among the congregation there would have been many people in the the temple but you see he separated himself out from among the Believers because he was worshiping an image that he had crafted of his own self and this is the problem with a legalistic spirit is it will it will exalt itself above someone else it will always try and do more than the next person it's you know the saying of keeping up with the Joneses of you know someone buys a new car you want a new car and different things well this comes right into the ranks of Believers where they try and they say well this family is doing better than mine spirit or this person is doing better than me spiritually so I've got to up my game that's a legalistic idol that's com into someone's heart you know we're not here to compare ourselves with ourselves as the Bible instructs us if we compare ourselves with ourselves we are unwise and I don't believe I'm looking at a foolish people this morning I believe I'm looking at a wise people a wise woman who's filled with the wisdom of God am mean by the baptism of the Holy Ghost so we're not here to to compare ourselves among ourselves or you know try and try and keep pigs because if you look at this man look at all the things he says he's done God isn't even in the picture he's just thanking God basically saying God I'm doing you a service here you know I'm actually doing you a favor you should be thanking me God you should be worshiping me God because because of what I've done look at me I'm awesome this is an idol of a flawed self cuz anything that takes worship from God is an idol and it's flawed amen because he should be the center of our lives he should be the purpose of Our Lives he should be our main he should be our affection he should be our joy he should be our everything amen Our Lives should be so intertwined with him wrapped up in his love amen but you see this man wasn't even thinking about those things no he was exalting what he perceived himself to be and you can see as the Lord would even say this man one went away Justified but the other did not and even this Publican when he said be merciful to me a sinner says here um um Scofield's got a note that I quite like he's saying basically look upon me as you look upon the blood of your mercy seat this is what he's saying in terms of Mercy look at me the same way you look upon the atoning blood look upon me the same way Lord and to me that you should be our hearts cry as well when we come to the Lord say Lord don't look upon me with with you know my abilities and what I do and what I think I am may you just see your blood when you look upon me Lord when you're not even not not even see me but you may just hear my voice through your blood so you see this man had a flawed a an idol of a flawed self now these things are very damaging because Jonah and I want to I pray this would the scripture would just be engraved in our hearts by the Holy Ghost this morning that they that OB observe lying vanities forsake their own Mercy now it's very easy to say lying vanities a sickness and you know trouble and oppression and sure all those things are lying vanities but the biggest lying vanity is when a person will will have an image of a flawed self in front of them where they will they will have an image of what a Christian should be but it's not and they will worship that you see man is made to worship am mean even even even as we because we know that um when when God created man God created man in his own image we know that was originally Spirit man so man was made to be a God we understand that man was was given dominion over over creation he was a God right so so man was made because man was made in the image of God and God is a God he is the god right I know this is very by Elementary but but I want you to think about it God made man in his own image so what that's a spirit to have dominion to be a God over the Earth as brother Bram would tell us that actually man was made to be an amateur or a little God he says but in Genesis 2 when he made man he said I am y a h u j u v uh Yahweh Jehovah what does it mean I am the all existent one who has created something of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or an amateur little one of mine Glory why he gave man Jehovah means he gave man to be an amateur God because he is Father God and he made a man an amateur God so he isn't self-existent anymore he exists with his family Ella Ella Elohim now he is Jehovah Jehovah means the one who exists with his family Hallelujah now God made man to be the predominant over the uh over all the Earth Earth he had dominion and the Earth was man's Dominion is that scripture now if that's his Dominion he was God over the Earth he could speak it would be so he could speak this and it would be so oh there he is god Jehovah the one who once existed in self-existence but now exist with his family and his little ones with him there you are am mean so God made man to be a God so what does that God means an object of worship the English word means that so now man because he has fallen has to worship something now brother Braham tells us you can make anything of God you can make your hobby of God your job your family even your church can be a can be an idol anything but you know really the most deceptive one is when you make yourself a God in your own eyes and that's not always some great Majestic something that's all powerful and all Incredible or inspiring that when you walk into the room the whole room should hush and because you've stepped and you know you're the greatest thing since sliced bread and you know no but it can be a decept a a a fallen flawed self can become an idol on and I think that is the greatest problem that comes especially among Believers actually even even if you look at this world we live in this Mental Health crisis that the world is in what are people looking they look in their own psyche and all they see is darkness and pain and misery and sorrow because they're unconverted and if you look in the human spirit and and the human Spirit or the human nature that is unconverted brother Bram says is worse than an animal so that's why this world is so broken because they're looking within themselves and just seeing no they don't see a remedy they just see problems it's like if you a doctor and you would examine a patient and you had no help for that person then all you'd see would be problems amen but you see the reason there's an examination is because they have an ability to fix something amen and and and we have far greater than human medicine Among Us this morning but we have the Lord God that heals all of our diseases so we have the problem we have the solution rather to every problem but you see what will happen is man will take a complex of pain or defect what they perceive as a defect in their own human spirit and they will worship that and you are what you behold you become what you behold amen as as Brother David Silas said a few uh Easter conventions ago he said you are your ambition so what your ambition is you will become that ambition if your ambition is to float with this world and just Cruise along you'll become that if your ambition is to become the best bum there's ever been on the street you'll become that because you become your ambition but if your ambition is to give your whole life to the Lord to make to give yourself as a Living Sacrifice to let him live no matter what what what capacity whatever that is but let him live you will become that ambition amen if your ambition is Lord I want you to live I want you to manifest your word in my life I want you to prove the power of your blood in my life I want you to be exalted I want you to be worshiped I want you to be adored you'll become that amen but it depends what kind of image you put in front of yourself amen as brother bramwood say when he's um uh I think he's in prayer this is the message the great Shining Light he says although peculiar yet the star was brilliant not brilliant in world's educational worlds of fear but brilliant as sacrifice before the Lord he says we prostrate ourselves as the Magi did in the presence of the king of kings to reflect his light amen and this is what we've been made to we built to do is to reflect his light to this Dying World so you'll reflect something but it depends what you put in front of yourself you see it's it's amazing how you know man if we if I can just find this here he would brother Brown would say about how the blood has never given a person a complex but yet people get complexes he say and and and we're just talking about this Pharisee in the temple but we'll come for we'll Advance further on than that but he says a men educate themselves till they they'll educate themselves away from one another they get complexes you don't get no complex by the blood of Jesus Christ you get love that's where you get love not a complex now that I'm a little bigger than someone else a little B than somebody else and know just a little more than somebody else you just got your arms around everybody and it's a basis of Love through the blood the blood cleanses so I and and I think that's very true I've never seen the blood of Jesus Christ give give anyone a complex I've never seen someone have a genuine salvation experience filled with the Holy Ghost and it's given them a complex I've never seen that in my life but yet man will get complexes and and and the reason is because the devil will put a perverted image in front of them and they will they will want to become for some reason they will think that's the right image to to behold now this Pharisee would would Jesus would say Beware of the scribes which desire to walk in Long robes and love love greetings in the markets and the highest seat in the synagogues and the chief room at rooms at feasts which devour widows houses and for show make long prayers the same shall receive a greater damnation now you think you think if we step back 2,000 years ago and and and we saw these very people that Jesus was actually referring to I doubt any one of them actually had a had an evil intent in their heart I doubt very much they rejoiced at how many widow's houses they devoured that week you know I doubt very much they had a they had a um you know a a certain number that they had to devour in a year you know that they're looking for promotion look I did a 100 this year I'm going to become come a chief Pharisee I doubt very much they had that in their hearts they genuinely wanted to serve God but you see they had an image before them of the more love and affection that you can get the the the more Prestige that you can obtain that you're actually a better Christian but that's but but that is an image of a flawed self because as a man was made to be a God so a fallen man will want worship that's why there's Kingdom Builders you know even in the message they want worship they want to be exalted that it's their name that's the most important one you know and and and and sadly this is because of Fallen man they want to be they want to be acknowledged I want Jesus Christ to be acknowledged I want him to be known I want his name to be known I don't care about my name I really don't my name will help you none none his name will give you eternal life am mean so I'm not interested in recognition I don't care about any of those things I want him to be known that's the one thing that'll satisfy me is people have a like brother BR said the end of the church H book The one thing he has desired is that man and God will have a true spiritual relationship that man will walk according to the word of God and be filled with the spirit that's the end of the church age book that's the whole summation really of his ministry that's what he desired I say Amen to that amen that's what I want to see but you see a you know someone who has a fallen they're actually they're actually worshiping a floored image of themselves they will want to be acknowledged they will want to be Forefront they will want to be you know their Prestige will go before them and you know brother Bram asks a question he says you know when he sees he sees advertising you know the man of the hour the Evangelist Sono is coming to the coming to the city and all these things and he'd say he'd say sometimes he'd say God who are the people coming to see even even his own self he'd say God are they coming to see me or the Evangelist or they coming to see you you you know and I think I think that's the same thing that we need to really you know what do we want to impart to people do we want to impart our personality do we want to impart ourselves to people that's that's a religious spirit that's an image of a flawed self no we want to impart that God would impart himself amen that that you know that he would be known I'm I'm I'm getting somewhere with all this so I just trust you just hold on and you know let's just let's just keep walking for a bit with you through the scriptures so man with was made to be a God and because he's now a fallen he's now in a fallen State either he will be worshiped by someone else or the person will worship themselves amen amen see there's always something that come you know people get a a a a a a distorted idea of what a Christian should be brother Bram would tell a story from from uh this is this is from the um writings of St Martin he saying that there was a bunch of monks in a monastery one day day and there was a young one of them who was kind of irritable you see when someone's worshiping an image of a flawed self they begin to their their mood changes their attitude changes about themselves and towards everyone else that Pharisee in the temple thought he was the top dog oh wow I'm the reason for this Temple look how greater I am what he became yeah I'm glad I'm not like this guy I'm glad I'm not like this family I'm glad I'm not like this I'm glad my children aren't like these children that's a that's an image of a flaw itself he has this image in front he's worshiping that see and one of them was kind of irritable watch this this is a good Parable today he wanted to be something above the rest of them he wanted to show himself Authority bigger something something better all class you know a great big something he had to be classical always wanted the other Brethren you know he had to be different see he no matter what it was he was very arrogant he was the only people on the beach there was no one could touch him now watch what happened he had to have something big he had to compare with the big societ you follow me see so he said he prophesied he said the Lord has made me a prophet also I'm a prophet now there was one identified prophet in the land that was St Martin he was born a prophet but this kid said this young fellow said young monk about 25 years old he said the Lord has made me a prophet I'm going to prove it to you said tonight the Lord is going to give me a big fine robe put it upon me a white robe and sit among you then all of you shall come up to me see and you'll take orders from me see he had the image in his mind this is what he wanted to become he wanted to be greater than everyone else but they that exalt themselves shall be aase right they that humble themselves shall be exalted the greatest among you should be servant of all Lord amen as as our lord Jesus would say now see you'll take orders from me now compare that today see I'll be the head of the organization I'll take care of you the rest of you monks and sure enough that night lights came on in the building so the writings of St Martin says read it it's authentic it's history and the lights come on all the rest watched and here come he had on a white robe standing among them he said see I told you but that's contrary to the word and when he went see isn't that isn't that to me it's a very striking statement it's contrary to the word so you see anyone who's worshiping an idol of a flawed self is contrary to the word amen their character their nature what they say will be contrary it'll be coed with the word but it'll be contrary to the Worden we'll come to that soon and when he went and got the old dean of the college he walked up and down a little bit said son that doesn't sound right he said there's only one way here it is there's only one way for us to know it looks Supernatural boy Pentecost would have grabbed that root Sinker line hook and everything else he said the miracle may seem all right but it doesn't seem right to the word now we have such a person an anointed Prophet by the name of Martin Come go up before him the guy said no no Martin ain't got nothing to do with this said you're going anyhow and they grabbed him by the arm and they took him before man and the robe left him yes amen how far along do people have to go along before they realize the image they've placed in front of them is not right like this like how embarrassed and how ridiculous this guy would have felt but I pray he would have fully completely repented and been born again after this experience right but you see God will allow you to go a certain way for you to realize you're worshiping the wrong thing amen and so now you see we've got to we're just going to jump down because the thing is we can live such a way that when the mercy of God walks in an idol if see an idol will never match the word of God Amen an idol is already contrary to the word of God but an idol can be so big in a person's life that's all they see it's like a filter that they look through and if it doesn't agree with the you if the word doesn't agree with that Idol they will throw the word away you saw it in the life of Jesus you saw it in the book of Acts you see it even in this day man has a denominational Idol they think this is what especially in Jesus's day you can bring it today as well this is who Christ should be you know they had their debates when the Messiah comes he's going to come down you know God's going to push a button and you stairs is going to come down from heaven he's going to step out of the clouds and say here I am you know I'm come to take over he's going to drive the Romans out to sea and all these things he's going to be a mighty conqueror they had an idea or an idol of who the Messiah should be but when he came he was born in a manger not one of the priests or religious people went to see his birth Shepherds went there Magi went there different ones but you see and then what did he do he is a small little Man From Galilee but yet it was God and flesh sir all that God was was now walking among them but you see they had such a such an idol of of of who of who God should be that they couldn't receive him now if you look in the Old Testament there's a lot of things where where God speaks about high places and Groves now a Grove is a is a is a um sacred wood or a Grove of trees that have a special religious importance within a particular culture I say a Grove has to be planted and it's got to be cultivated you see those trees I don't know how old they are but they've been there for a while they weren't just planted yesterday so a Grove that's been placed in someone's heart has been cultivated for years yeah it may be something like that man I shared that sad testimony of who wouldn't get married cuz he didn't want to give his parents grandchildren that's a Grove that's a cultivated idea that's been growing it would have started as a small seed but the devil see what happens is man man will have self fulfilling prophecy in their lives so for example they will they will they will you know they will um they will grow up and they'll get this idea in their minds you know no one likes them no one wants to be their friend no one cares about them and maybe it started from just a small thing in their childhood but it but it becomes it begins to grow it begins to be cultivated and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy where people think well no one cares about them no one will talk to them no one will spend time with them and when they come to church they come to church maybe they'll come to lunch if they do and if they come to lunch they won't join in the conversation they won't enter in they won't they they won't actually put their heart into the discussion and so they'll I'll say look no one's coming to talk to me but what is it it's a self fulfilling prophecy what is it it's an idol they'll look through everything through that idle of No One Cares but yet everyone cares that's right you know to me it's amazing like you think about it where's Dave come here okay here's me no not yet soon okay here I am I have this Idol I yeah I'm worshiping this idea of this flawed self that I'm not no one likes me I got nothing to share I got nothing to put value in you know no one loves me and then and then Here Comes Dave here comes the love of God in flesh to me amen this is Jesus in flesh and he comes to speak to me he come say how you doing say how you doing how you doing you know and then maybe I'll just kind oh you're good but yet I so I have this Idol in my heart no one cares Here Comes God's care Here Comes God's love to me but yet because this Idol is so great I will not allow it to impact me thanks bro appreciate that you see but but that's how rubber hits the road kind of it is think no what God doesn't care no one talks to me it's a self-fulfilling prophecy and people cut themselves off wall themselves away from the love of God right cuz imagine that if I'm actually open actually no people do care that Idol gets smashed down here comes Dave the love of God he begins to talk to me and that conversation changes my whole life amen my whole walk has changed my whole life has revolutionized why because I opened myself up to the love of God my amen beautiful you say that doesn't happen it happens a lot sadly it happens a lot yet the person well I'm a Believer you know I've been baptized I gave my life to the Lord all these things but if I've got that kind of a complex in my life because of my part you know we can't change our past but we can say thank God for the scars thank God for your scars thank you for my scars Hallelujah you know we can it's our perception has to change now you look at this you look at this here is Simon the Pharisee he's invited Jesus Jesus always comes where he's invited right the form he may come in may be different than what you expect he may come in the form of there in David hey if Christ is in you and I that's that's Jesus coming that's Jesus walking on two feet yes sir hallelujah amen amen don't you believe God lives in you the baptism of the Holy Ghost is Christ pouring himself out into the body amen so so so so here he is he invites the Lord the word steps into his house he's not made welcome think it's a complex see because Simon the Pharisee worshiped his Feast he worshiped what he could put on because it became prestigious among the community it became a yearly event of you know the food would get better the entertainment would get better and you and the guests would become more the celebrity it started seist celebrity now it was ala celebrity this was this was the event you know if you got invited to his Feast man you made it you and the up and ups but really you're in the down and outs because all of them could not had such an idol in their heart what they thought a prophet should be what they thought God would do what they thought God how how God would treat people because look at this and so so Here Comes This Woman This Woman didn't have this Idol of a flawed self of a religious flawed self this woman just knew she needed salvation this this woman just knew she needed the love of God she needed to be changed she needed to know her sins could be washed away and she found her way in see if you don't have an idol of a flawed self there'll be no barrier amen it's just you and God and God can talk to you you can talk back to him and he can minister to you and he can meet your need maybe not like this but in time he'll do it amen so you can walk with him so she she saw she looked in the window and saw he's got unwashed feet he's made unwelcome how many people make Jesus unwelcome in their lives I'm talking here I'm not talking out there forget out there what about you and I let's put the Pitchfork down and say God have I made you welcome in my life what 20 million years ago I did forget 20 million years ago what about today he should be you should be on fire more today than you were back then am mean you should be so more happy now than you were back then when he first found you but you see people get this idea of this religious Idol and I'm going to get to it amen amen so here she comes in doesn't have towels for his doesn't have a foot washed Basin God supplies the tears of repentance amen didn't didn't have any perfume you know that that that the Pharisee had went and gave all her earnings amen and Jesus knew where she got it from right but got the be got that Alabaster Box off the top shelf ran because she knew he must be made welcome amen it should be the same thing with you and I we something in our heart say Lord you must be made welcome I will not leave you with unwashed feet in my house in my life in my presence I'm going to wash your feet Lord hallelujah cuz he's been walking through ladyo here and it's been a it's a filthy mess of aay Amen so there's got to be a place where he can have wash feet so she comes in doesn't ask permission but she goes right to him amen and does him such a service what happens now all of these Pharisees aren't going Hallelujah glory to God someone broke through praise the Lord hosana salvation's come to your house Simon isn't this this is the greatest event that's ever happened in this house oh Simon imagine if this was put in the gospels 2,000 years later people read about what happened in your house wouldn't you like a testimony like that amen where where that your testimony of what God did in your house will go around the world hallelujah amen but you see all of their hearts had an idol of a flawed Pharisee religious self so when she came in and started and her worship when she broke that Alabaster Box it filled the whole house it wasn't just a dried dyed prayer in the corner no it would have changed the whole maybe the music stopped all the conversation would have stopped and she's keeping on going she cuz she doesn't care about what they think see an idol of a flawed self is what does the other person think forget that what does he saying amen it's like our lord Jesus well you know brother Bram would give a he's not the Lord Jesus but brother Bram would give an illustration of a man playing a violin in front of thousands in a concert hall and at the end everyone's on their feet giving a standing ovation but he's not looking at their Applause he knows they enjoy it but he's looking up on the balcony to see the master that trained him and when he gives the nod then he then he acknowledges that why because he's been training under his tutorship and then the master looks down and says what everything I've poured into him is now being manifested and should be the same thing with the bride of Jesus Christ Our Lord Jesus should look into our lives and say everything I poured into them of love and joy and peace and faith and overcoming power and victory as being put on flesh in their lives Hallelujah so I'm looking for his Applause I'm looking for his Amen on my life that's the thing that counts amen man's ideas you know Micaiah would be there in front of 400 prophets and you know they had you know that was saying before Mah was brought to the meeting we're all praying this we're all prophesying this if you want to be back in Fellowship Mah you better say the same thing he wasn't looking for their Applause he wasn't looking for their acknowledgement he wanted God's acknowledgement amen and M is a type of you and I the prophet wasn't there but Mah was reading the words of Elijah and knew it had to be fulfilled aab had to fall in battle amen so he wasn't looking for there amen he was looking for God's amen amen so may we be the same way they could not receive what she received because of an idol that is the one of the saddest scenes I've ever seen in my oh it's glorious for her because the Lord said thy sins be forgiven thee go in peace in other words go in my Shalom go in my peace and she walked out Justified she came in one way she walked out another way they sat in their couch scornful they stayed scornful that's right amen yet religious and see look at this here where where Simon here says Behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that uh that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees house brought an alabas the box of ointment and stood At His Feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears that wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the with the ointment now when the Pharisee which had bitten him s it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him for she is a sinner the the image of what he thought a prophet should be was not this it was a false idol in his heart his perception wasn't a Godly perception because if it was a Godly perception he wouldn't be thinking this he'd say glory and he would have he would have been at at his feet it wouldn't have been the footwash flank washing jesus' feet he would have been the foot wash flank let me wash your feet Jesus let me kiss you welcome let me anoint you you know can I where's the best place in this place for you you know let's find you the you know but no he had this Idol of a flawed religious self in his heart so when he came in he couldn't accept it friends we don't ever want to get to a place where God can move he can pour His Spirit out service after service prayer meeting after prayer meeting and it becomes like water offer Duck's back because you know I'm going to we've got to realize that he's the same in power and principle and everything except he's not here in his Corporal body all that he is we can't have this perception of this what we think a Christian should be and what God should be oh he can't do that anymore who said oh you can't get it in your seat who said are you going come up for prayer people preach against prayer lines when when did when did Brother Bram stop having pray prayer lines Jesus met everyone's needs in different ways the s a phenician woman came just speak you know you know my my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil go your way your faith has saved her the Centurion came just speak the word and my servant will be made whole the woman touched the him of His Garment you know one had to go wash the pool of salom all different kinds of ways Jesus met the needs of the people and it should be the same thing with us people need prayer they need prayer they need to be anointed be anointed then get in their seat we need a prayer line whatever it is we have a multi member way that God does things so I think we should do it the same kind of way we should never have a perception in our mind it has to be a certain way a certain place at a certain time it can be anytime any place hallelujah amen he says the Lord add His blessings through his word now many here now just of this just your first night I'm uh we're glad you have uh but how many here your uh your first timers that will say this to God now as the man has said you have risen from the dead you're not in the Corporal body because when that returns to Earth again we'll go with him but his Corporal body sitting there up in glory but a spiritual body in his church amen and by that same Spirit we're all baptized into his body see so his physical body we're going to meet one day in the air that's going to be a glorious time but his spirit is upon the Earth everything he is is here right now apart from his Corporal body amen but we never want to get to a place where where we think he cannot meet our needs or he cannot do pardon me that a that a idol become such a thing that it rules our lives possessions power approval Comfort success Fame religion entertainment yourself pleasure money that yourself should be the biggest one in that we don't want to this kind of an idol now if I can where I am here what does this got to do with you and I it comes into it comes into our lives because we look at our humanity and it be can become Our God this is the idol of a flawed South I'm just kind of actually getting to where I want to talk now and people love this kind of talk like in Romans now this is true I say Amen to it for I was alive without the law once but when the Commandment came sin revived and I died and the Commandment which was ordained to life I found to be unto death for sin taking occasion by the Commandment deceive me and by it slew me wherefore the law is Holy and the Commandment holy and just and good was then uh that which is good made death unto me God forbid but sin that it might appear working death in Me by that which is good that sin by the Commandment might become exceedingly sinful for we know that the law is spiritual but I'm caral sold under sin for that which which I do um for that which I do I allow not and for that and for what I would that do I not for what I hate that I do if then I do that which I would not I consent unto the law that it is good now then it is no more that I do it but sin that dwelleth in me for I know that in me that is that is in my flesh know the differentiation here not in the spirit and his flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not for the good that I would do not but the evil which I would not that I do now if I do now if I do that I would not it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me I find in a law that when I would do good evil is present with me for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see another LW in my members Waring against the LW of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the LW of sin which is in my members oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death how many people stop there because of a perceived deficiency in their own human emotions their makeup complexes pains hurts problems that they perceive that rule them and and they do become something that rules what is it now it's an image of a flawed self becomes an idol because they see well I've got this problem and I've got this human Pro this temperament and you know I've got this complex and I've got this pain and I've got this and it becomes something I've I've I've I've and it becomes a big thing their whole life is actually living through that Idol now if you and and people say well you know I God allows me to keep this just to keep me humble who said that who said that yeah when I look into this image because this is the mirror we should be looking into I mean not an idol of our flawed self or what we think we are this Bible doesn't tell me that I should be you know a lot of you know we are all Billboards we are advertising we're Christian advertising we are a living walking Track we're a living walking Bible what are you advertising you know what because remember the proof of the product is the life you live right that's like any product when it's tested and then then it's proven it's not just a sales speak that you know Pro something it's when it's actually used amen amen and so now what kind of Life are we living are we living this well I've got my problems and my anxiety and you know you put up with my humanity and you know do you live that kind of a Christian Life when the world sees you do they want what you have yes sir Hallelujah do they really want what you have or do they just see rules and regulations and well I'll never you know a false humility of well you know I'm just going through this and i' you know my parents were like this and I've got this kind of temperament and you know this happened to me when I was young and talking about those things is all fine but you don't want it to become the everything in your life that should never be our defining thing am amen my my first birth is not my identification amen it is not my identity you may see a man here with a kiwi accent and whatever whatever but you know that's not who I am amen that that was my first birth God used that to get me here I me but before I ever got here he put a seed Gene of God in my Soul amen and his time appointed amen he revealed himself to me to show me I'm not from New Zealand amen my natural parents I love them to death but they they're not my real parent amen my heavenly father is my father amen I came from God and I go back to God Amen so if you major on the negative all the time what are you doing it becomes an idol it becomes a Grove amen when you think I can never overcome this and well you know we're in these bodies and you know these bodies need to be changed you our human spirit needs to be made new and all these things you know we can live a Victorious life even in these bodies I mean we do not need a body change to be victorious Jesus did not die that we could enjoy the benefits of Calvary after the resurrection no he wanted you in this Earthly pest house that you live in to live a joyful overcoming happy wonderful life that's what he wants that's what he ordained you to be amen he never ordained you to be sad and mopy and depressed and down and pour me and look at me and this is my problem he never ordained you to walk that way if you're walking that way you've got an idol in front of you and it needs to be broken amen because the image in front of you should be the word of God Amen and the more you Behold Him the more you become like him and I've never seen a real Christian be be on the streets of Glory dancing amen and then go down in the dumps and stay there sure we may go through valleys but it's a trajectory up I mean we can look back and say glory to God hallelujah you're fully redem me amen I've been washed in your blood you made be a new creature amen I've got my joy shoes on and I'm dancing all my way up into heaven H why because the Lord Jesus has redeemed you and I amen it's not our Humanity that counts who cares about it just just just get over yourself get over your humanity and walk with God you say but my parents are like this and my you know the new birth breaks that control of that thing the new birth makes you a new creature Amen brother B preached he you know he mentioned a um he mentioned an interview in the message called Paradox and he said there was a a parents of a boy that was going out with a girl and something happened between the boy and the girl and and the parents were shocked they like how could this be so they bring the boy before brother Braham and you know brother Braham begins to talk about their lineage how one's German one's Irish and high tempered and indifferent to religion all these different things he said but you're not like that you are the only two out of your whole families that have met the Lord you'll be made new cre New Creations and in Christ amen and and see you don't have that temperament anymore God has changed you I mean and that's what God must do sure we have some of our temperament we're born with but you know he doesn't change our temperament but our natural lineage does not control us anymore praise God and so even and then he said your son needs the same thing to happen but his father said no he's repented he's been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you know he's he's a Believer and brother Ram says as far as outwardly yes he's a Believer but until God comes and changes him I I recommend that man that boy never get married cuz he will make it hell for that girl there must be a change you see so we should never be focusing you know the gospel see the gospel in these days has been reduced from a life of Joy Victory and overcoming power to a life where we just become aware of human py olical problems wow that's what this message has been reduced to where look at these complexes look at these problems look at these things that hinder no faith needs to come in in a greater measure Faith gives us the victory there one thing to acknowledge a problem it's another thing to make it an idol or to actually make it a trophy on your wall cuz God has delivered you from it brother R says the simplest thing to break a complex is do the opposite so if you're way sinking you'll never make it you're not worthy you you don't mean anything to God you no do the opposite it I am worthy because of what he's done for me I am important to him he died for me on Calvary I my soul is worth more than 10,000 worlds I me I am not indifferent I am not cold you got to you got to break that cycle you got to choose by yourself see Idols see how many Idols did God Smash in the Old Testament using human hands come on now Gideon had to break the idol in his father's house see there's family strains that come down that have got to be broken I mean you can't let those things that affected your fores affect you I mean you because if you do you're worshiping an idol of a flawed self Hallelujah but you I I Believe by the grace of God we can break every Idol I mean we can put the right image in front of ourselves of joy peace love Faith overcoming power forgiveness oh but what about all those things that happened to me I don't know it's for a purpose let God use it amen don't don't live a life of self fulfilling prophecy like that man I said about how he said he'll never get married how many women would have come up to him and been interested in him and how many would he have turned away I don't know but there would have been one that would have been the one it was self-fulfilling prophecy because of what is how's parents raised him we're got to let those things go you can't change your past you can't change what's happened none of us can do it you say but it was so traumatic that can be true amen but let the Lord take it it from you let it become a victory let it become an overcomer you going to see you know look at the thief on the cross he did not one day be a good person then one day he was on the on the cross the only one on the cross that wasn't meant to be there was the Lord the other guys deserved it even one the one who actually got forgiveness said hey stop railing on him we deserve to be here he's done nothing wrong but God ordained his steps to end up there to see the lamb doesn't make human sense but what it made sense in God's Great economy Amen to show it doesn't matter where you've come what you've done amen you look again and see the blood of the Lamb amen it'll change your life am me cuz he did not have that image like the Pharisees had in their hearts looking at the Lord no when he looked again he saw the Lord Jesus for who he really was and he got Mercy his whole life was ordained to end up there you say well I've had a bad run we've all had a bad run of some degree but it's not where you start it's where you finish amen amen so I believe that we should be a Powerhouse of Joy when you really set this because remember the Lord Jesus when he looks at you and I he's not a wrathful judge amen we we are not staring at a at a great white Throne judgment that's right remember the Lord Jesus took our judgment that day on Calvary the Wrath you should have received he received amen he gladly bore it that day on Calvary that you didn't have to go to judgment amen so when he looks at you and I he's not an Angry God he's not a god of wrath he's not a god waiting for you to trip up just to kick you down to Hell he's not that kind of a God no his eyes are full of Mercy his eyes are full of love amen his heart is full of grace for you and I amen he wants us to make it more than anything huj hallelujah amen he wants us to be happy he doesn't want us to be you say well I'm going through a sad time come out of the sad time we have all had sad times but don't stay in it I mean don't let it become an of well this is just how I'm going to be for the rest of my life who said that am mean you got to realize the reason the Lord Jesus comes down in our midst is to really tell us of where we're going Amen brother Braham said at one place I don't have the quote in front of me but when but when the three Hebrew children were in the fire and the Lord you know there's you know brother Brown dramatized it where you know wormwood the angel comes up before the Throne of heaven and you says Master can't you see what they're doing to your three three sons down in Babylon they're about to throw them in the furnace pardon me let me go down I'll drown the whole place I'll wipe Babylon off the map like I did when you told me to in the days of Noah and God said no no wormwood you've been a good Angel you've done exactly what I've asked you to do in the past I can't let you go he stands to attention Gabriel comes and draws his sword says Master can you not see what they're about to do to Shadrach Meshach and Abednego they're going to throw them in the furnace cuz they've made a stand for you he says let me go down there I'll just cut all the heads off and one go I will absolutely annihilate Babylon with one swing of my sword he could have done it don't you think so amen but the Lord said no Gabriel you've been faithful you've been true to me since the day I formed you but I can't let you go down and then so no doubt the angels are wondering them what are you going to do he says this is a god-sized job this is not an angelized go job this is a god-sized job and the wonderful thing about shadra Meshach and abedo is they had no Idol in their hearts of how God should answer them because when when they were standing before King Nebuchadnezzar you know they said well we will not be careful how we're going to answer you you our God May Deliver Us from the furnace he may not but the sum of it is we're not bowing see they did not have an idol about how God was going to answer they said well if we die we die if we don't we don't our lives are in God's hands because when we were young people when we left Jerusalem we said we're going to serve him no matter where he takes us and he's brought us to this moment he's brought us to this predestinated moment amen and they are thrown in the furnace and just as they were thrown in the furnace the Fourth Man stepped in Hallelujah and and brother br says that when when the fourth man was with Shadrach Meshach and abedo he was telling them of their future home he was telling about where they're going to go to he was telling them about what the glories that they were going to enjoy when they crossed the other side Hallelujah he was ministering to them where the end was going to be amen and I think the message of the hour should be poured into us in such a way that we should look at our end amen cuz if we see where we're going amen these Idols will be smashed am mean cuz we'll look beyond the now we won't care about the problems in the past and the whatever no we will look to where we're going because this message has called you to a Rapture that's why the Lord Jesus died on Calvary to transform your bodies Amen to take you into Glory Hallelujah that's why he has come amen so don't look at the now let it be an idol you say well you know I can't take correction smash that Idol they say well you know I just can't put up with anything that's just not according to my view smash that Idol if it's according to the word receive it in the name of Jesus Christ am mean do not let anything come between you and God yeah amen because otherwise God will walk into the room and you won't be able to receive him but if these Idols are all gone you say Lord how how do you want to come do you want to come in the form of David Maron any one of us do you want to come through a song come through Ministry come through prayer Hallelujah Lord however you come Lord I Want Your Presence to come I want you to come and dwell with me and change my life Lord amen I
