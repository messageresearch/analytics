like the people the you get invited to a BRI and you really feel like the people that invited you really want you there you're so happy to be there you know but you know when you go to a an extended family event and you know you're only on the invite list because of your last [Music] name and you'd rather stay home cuz you do not have a good experience cuz they didn't really want you there even

um in early February I was referred by my doctor to have some tests due to some irregular symptoms after two MRI scans I saw a neurosurgeon who said that although my brain was clear not surprise unfortunately there was a mess consistent with cancer in my throat at the base of my tongue which he said was very serious he ordered further tests and referred me to an ear- noos and throat specialist the following day was Bible study I was anointed with oil by Pastor Ben and brother kuin and we prayed for healing in the name of Jesus Christ amen especially during the appointments in the following days the fear and uncertainty fired plenty of unpleasant shots my way I had to keep focusing on him and his promises on Jesus Christ and his promises this brought rest in fully surrendering this whole situation to the Lord 3 days ago on Thursday I was with the earos and throat specialist and he was planning to further investigate the mass in the base of my throat after much poking and prodding he stopped with the scope down my throat and looked puzzled he asked me to confirm my name and then he asked for proof of my ID because in his opinion the throat in the three schemes was a different throat to the one that was sitting in the chair in front of himall his diagnosis was a perfectly healthy tongue and throat with no further followup required so I'm giving testimony of God's healing hand and give all praise and glory to him praise the Lord amen praise the Lord that's the god that we serve this morning you know when we when we fully trust in him and don't doubt Just Surrender it all to the Lord that's when that happens and I I I I I don't feel scared in saying that's when it happens every time because he can't fail so if we surrender and fully believe then that's always the outcome praise the Lord let's stand this morning just Worship the Lord oh sweet Jesus take my life all is failings all is stri you're the only only thing I the done that's right I Surrender

all your honor and glory Lord because we love you Lord we ask you take control we those who are streaming as well Lord we thank you for this opport in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can you can have your seats uh this morning so I want to I want to speak about I really want to continue on from last Sunday about but not so much about the eagle anointing but I want to talk about the uh about how the bride and the spirit say come there's are people who have come into the world that are saying the same thing as the spirit of God now this is very I think it can never be emphasized enough to to say what the word has already declared because you got to look at now there's so many voices in this age there's never been the ability I don't think upon the face of the Earth where I can be standing here I can just hold my phone or sitting in the car or wherever people have their deep and meaningful epiphanies and they and they share it to the world and literally everyone who's connected to the internet can listen to what they're saying and even if they can't maybe understand it in the live stream they can go and put captions on it can be translated into their into their language and it's about 97% accurate so there's so many voices that are that are in this world incredible number of voices and everyone has a soap box they can stand on and say what they think is the right thing to say but I'm so thankful we can we can say what a Vindicated word has already said you know we can we can stand here and we can declare this message Works amen that that it is not the mind of a man as brother Braham said and I pray these things aren't just catchphrases to us but he says you're not feeding on the mind of a man so you're not you're not spirit feeding on his thoughts but you're feeding on the body word of the son of man so you're you're feeding on more than just the ideas of a man from Kentucky but you're feeding on the voice of God Amen that his word would sustain and you and transform Our Lives now we need to say what the spirit says right this scripture is being lived out in this day the spirit and the bride say come so they're saying the same thing that you know it's been ever since the fall man uh God has been wrestling or trying to get man in his hand that man will say the same thing as God says but you know because of man's Fallen nature and how the devil's enticing Spirits the devil's always got man to say something different or add or take away but I believe I'm looking at the choir here this morning that say what the spirit says amen because if you look at what the spirit you know what God has backed up I think we should say Amen too amen because if he's amened it he'll amen it again I'm so I'm just trying to find my feet here um if you don't mind amen see now what is what is um see we we finished off last Sunday speaking about the Welsh policeman being the Welsh Revival so he he embodied that Revival where where the men who are looking for this revival came over from America I think it was they did not need to go to a building to find it but he was the personification of the Revival he was the manifestation of it he says and you as as this policeman would say you're standing in the midst of it cuz I am the Welsh Revival so there has to be a people upon the Earth that they say the same thing the spirit says that it's no longer just ink on paper anymore but it's in a living manifestation so you know brother B makes some statements and and so I'm just going to read a bit here but he says this in the church age book and I tell you if you ever want to um you know instead of Doom scrolling read through the church AE book on your phone you know you'll find a lot more beneficial but he says there it is he's sending a Vindicated Prophet he's sending a prophet after almost 2,000 years he's sending someone who is so far from organization education and the word of religion world of religion there John the Baptist and Elijah of old he'll hear only from God and and he'll have thus sayith the Lord and speak for God he'll be God's mouthpiece And he as it is declared in Malachi 4:6 will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers so back to the original Faith he'll bring back the elect of the last day and they'll hear a Vindicator Prophet give the exact truth as it was with Paul he will restore the truth as they had and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the law and be his body and be his voice and will perform his Works Hallelujah do you see it there's a people that will be his body will do his works and will have his voice amen so there will be a people just like this Welsh policeman they will be the living manifestation of his word in their day so that's why it's so important that we say what the spirit has said amen so he says here a moment momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the dark ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but God sent Luther with with the word the Lutheran spoke for God at that time but they organized again the pure word was lost for organizational Trends towards dogma and Creeds and not the simple word excuse me they could no longer speak for God then God sent Wiley and he was the voice uh with the word in his day the people who took his Revelation from God became living Epistles read in h of all men for their generation when the methodists failed God raised up others and it and so it has gone on through the years until in this last day there'll be another people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age you see this voice has to live it can't just be press play and Obey no God never sent a mechanical VI device to preach the gospel though it was stored on that that we could hear the voice of the message right but it was to be lived amen God never intended that the message stay on tapes and books and bibles just in print form but God has always intended his word be a living manifestation and a living people amen where the voice of God God Thunders out through a Sanctified dedicated life to God I me because we're going to realize that we have power in this day amen we're not just here as sitting ducks or your helpless uh helpless Damsel in Distress no we've been rescued amen we've been purchased we've been gathered we're no longer hidden behind the bars of unbelief and questions of man and the fog and opinions of man no we've been we've been brought down from that Tower amen the dragon's being slain amen we're being delivered amen I trust you have this morning amen so we're no longer Damsel in in distress but our great Prince amen the great king of glory amen who ransomed us now comes and lives in us and he gives the final kick to the devil to his bride to do hallelujah amen because why the work of God will be finished through you and I amen we're not waiting for the prophet to come back he will one day in the resurrection it'll all be over then anyway but you see we're not waiting for someone to come back and type all the Mysteries and make it all clear it's already happened I mean we're not sitting wondering is it true or is it not we've seen him prove it to be true that's why I think so many people who stand on soap boxes on the internet what life do they produce I mean what is the Vindication of what they're saying but you can go back and virtually every message that was recorded and you can hear God come back in behind that and vindicate it over and over and over again it was common knowledge in that day the angel of the Lord was with brother brandham his contemporaries it wasn't something that was just hatched up later they knew it was there CU they experienced that presence of that angel they knew he was with him right so it wasn't a mystery back then they were all well aware of it you see but that same Angel is with his word today amen God always backs up his word amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord see as we come down to this last age I don't have this um the the scripture here but but if we go to Revelations chapter 3 Let's just read something quickly cuz I think we can if there's ever a people that can rest in the ability of God it is us if we ever rest in his ability that God has so Stripped Away man's opinions in this day that we can take the word as it is written and we can have confidence God will produce it how he wants to produce it right amen amen to Revelations 3 and we'll go to this is we know this is for our age but let's just read Revelations 3:14 and unto the angel of the Church of Lady oans uh write these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness the the beginning of the creation of God Amen so when so so so the Lord is declaring the F you know uh he's declaring who he is in this age as the amen so who has the finalist say you know someone who who who gives the amen that's the final Authority he's the chief Authority he's not an opinion he is the he's not even an opinion he's the authority he has the final say I mean he is the absolute and every situation so God is saying this is who I'm this is how I'm going to be made known in this age as the amen amen so now the spirit is going to speak very expressly in this day with full Authority am mean to prove this is me amen this is not see we're not following ideas of man we're not following some tradition that's been handed down and it's dead and it's just a nice idea of culture no we follow the word of God that's living in this day amen remember the spirit and the bride say come okay so so what what whatever the spirit has declared we will say the same thing amen and that's just not an empty paring of it no the life of that word will come into you and I and will manifest it we will be the body of the Lord amen so he says he is the amen so and you he is the faithful and true witness how many times brother B you even preached this message yo he'd say a true witness testimony of a true witness he preached those kind you know and and I think even in that sermon he's just talking about hunting trips and God doing things in the wilderness he says that same spirit is here what is it that's the amen the faith on true witness coming down proving his word to you and I that we can say the same thing as the spirit says you know I'm so thankful we've got something to say in this age amen we don't just have some something hatched up in a Bible School somewhere but we've got a word from God Amen that we can we can declare that it's true is living and I say you are the testimony you're the evidence of it just like the Welsh policeman was the Welsh Revival you say you are the manifestation the proof that this message is Right amen because You' have been brought out of Darkness into light you come out of Darkness into religious Darkness you didn't come out of darkness and stand in darkness no whom the son has set free is free indeed am mean there's a total Deliverance among the people of God it doesn't matter what cage the devil tries to put you and you got to realize no that thing a lying vanity I'm going to say what the spirit says and the spirit says whever the son is set free is free indeed amen that I can do all things through Christ Jesus what strengthens me I'm more than a conqueror that's what the spirit says that's what the bride should say am mean we should that give T testimony and witness of what God has already declared am me because you can only live as high as your testim of of your confession if you confess you're never going to get anywhere guess what you're never going to get anywhere if you confess you never overcome guess what you won't overcome if you confess you're depressed and down and nothing's going to ever come right you're going to live by that because there's power in your in your voice life and death is in the power of the tongue amen if you confess there's nothing to this truth it won't won't affect you like it should amen but if you say yes Lord you're right your word is true you did purchase my salvation on Calvary you're here to deliver you're here to set me free you're here to encourage me Lord You're My Strength you're my shield you're my guide you're more than able Lord you know the way Lord I don't know the way I tell you what he'll come in behind that he'll say amen I will give the amen to your confession amen because why he is the high priest of our profession or our confession so I think we should always confess good even if it looks bad confess good amen it looked bad for it bad you it looked bad for Shadrach Meshach and abedo but they confess look we're not bowing to this image we're not bowing to this thing if we burn we burn if we don't God can deliver but you know it looked bad but they just confessed God's word was right and they weren't going to change their life based on what they were facing they they stayed with the word of God Amen then then what happened the amen walked in the fire with them amen the amen the faithful and true witness testified that they were his amen and even if they burnt they were still his amen the outcome didn't really matter the fact is they made up their mind the amen has spoken in Babylon and said you're my children you're circumcised sons of Abraham I'm going to walk with you amen praise the Lord friends he's still as much alive today as he was then amen this world has been burning seven times hotter amen the pressure's been on but I tell you the equalizer and the Overcomers in the building amen he's in our lives so it doesn't matter how bad things get get don't look at how bad things get you should look at how great your God is amen because remember here's the amen we are not this world is not going to end in complete failure for the believer it ain't going to end in complete failure it cannot cuz it's been prophesied we will overcome amen that we will leave this world triumphant amen we will leave this world not just you know not just surviving overcoming amen because you got to realize you got to come to a place where this you and the spirit say the same thing you see Gideon was threshing weed in secret he was not saying what God had said about the children of Israel he knew he was of the tribe of Manasseh he knew he was the son of Abraham he knew he was in the promised land but he was not confessing what God Said would happen if they followed God in that land and so he was hiding he was afraid he was threshing weed in secret but then the spirit the angel of the Lord came to him and and made him changes confession because when the angel of the Lord spoke to Gideon he said you're a mighty man of Valor I mean and here's a man hiding in secret just trying to survive and hide in caves like they all did but God had to awaken him saying look this is not what I say about you Gideon I call you a mighty man of Valor you're not a weakling you're not a shrimp you're not a loser you're Victorious amen so then what happened is God begin to work in his life to prove to him what he told him when he was threshing wheat what has God done in our Our Lives friends I mean we were thought we were from New Zealand from Africa somewhere from some place and we're just part of that culture part of that thing but then God came down amen into our lives and awaken us saying no you're my bride you're a virtuous woman amen you're bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh life of my life you are part of me amen you're more than a person never ever let anyone diminish to you who you are based on where you're from amen that is of the devil amen you got to realize no I'm a daughter of God I'm a Son of God sure I walk in humility but never let amen what color of your skin people racism is of hell and never ever let that spirit to control you and push you down no we're the children of the most high God doesn't matter what color you are that's irrelevant God's a god of righty he put a SE Gene in the in your soul before the foundation of the world Amen and you operate according to that hallelujah amen we should never knuckle down for no devil telling tell us we're no good we're nothing no that is not the confession of the Bride that's not the confession of the spirit amen that doesn't what God does not say those things about you amen there no second class citizen in his bride amen we're all part of the same body doesn't matter what language we speak where we're from our age that has got nothing to do with it amen we're all one in Christ Jesus so therefore we should walk that way we should talk that way we should treat others that way amen we are not downtrodden we're not nothings we're not no hopers no God has given us hope am mean he's given us expectation he's given us faith I mean to realize that we are not going to end in defeat but we're going to walk out Victorious amen and God has been pouring in Victory after Victory after Victory Amen to prove I'm with you I'm here I'm in charged amen you cannot lose everything's going to come out fine amen you trust in me amen I will carry you through amen I'm your sustainer I'm your keeper I'm your healer I'm your all in all I'm your savior trust in me amen hallelujah because God when God looks at himself he never thinks I can't do it we should hear God's confession about himself I'm the Supreme one I'm the almighty there's none besides me there's no one equal with me amen I made all things by me all things consist amen I'm the sustainer I'm the Redeemer I'm the almighty God hallelujah even angels look dirty in my sight that's how high and holy I am amen but by the blood of Jesus Christ amen he so transforms your life amen that you're as holy as he is Holy you're as righteous as he is righteous amen you're sinless as he is sinless hallu was there a scripture for that absolutely he became sin who knew no sin that you become the very righteousness of God in Christ Hallelujah so when our God speaks about himself and now he's not arrogant he's not boastful he's just saying it it is that as it is he doesn't he doesn't need to talk himself up I mean he doesn't need to try and play himself out he's not a spin doctor he just tells the truth Hallelujah so he knows who he is amen he is not he is not some scared little wimp in the corner that that you got to pluck up some courage to take on the bad guys though he knows who he is amen and it's why it's so important we confess who our God is based on what his confession about himself hallelujah amen has our God ever lost can he lose will he lose no so what should the spirit and the bride say the same thing amen I trust this is real personal today we're going to have a I you know I think we can we we can rest we can cease from our own works we can cease from you know us trying to figure things out and make things happen no we can rest in his ability amen you know you know the Lord's in your corner has you ever seen a wrestling match more than one guy and you got you know there's two in the ring but you know the guy's got to tap out and get the other guy in who's ever seen that kind of thing the guy the guy on the outside of the Ring can do nothing until he gets tapped in that's right he can't do nothing you know he can be yelling at you you yelling at his teammates encouraging him saying just tap me in tap me in I I can get this guy I know how to pin him and make him look like a piece of origami on the mat he can't do nothing until he gets tabbed in how many times do we try and take the Devil by the and he's like he's worse than a slippery eel yeah he's a Slicker of Slickers he's like Mercury you just Quicksilver but you just tap in the Lord one time who's ever who's ever tried to fight a battle let's you know let's all be honest we've tried to work out things tried to make things work and then we just find our face on the M again down discouraged and but then somehow we just get a hand in and we just tap tap the Lord in and then you sit back and and your things just totally unfold and you're carrying the Victor out you think man how did that happen yeah and if you say well cuz I tagged him in Hallelujah he's still the same for us now you got to call him on the scene you got to call him on the scene he's a present help in time of trouble am mean he's not some distant God who's indifferent to what you're going through no see see the what does the Lord say I'm with you I'll never leave thee nor forsake there's probably a probably a scripture I probably refer to every sermon I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee I'm a present help in time of trouble I mean the Lord is NY amen you can't you know we can't think he's some distant thing now we should confess he's with me wherever I go he's with me amen and the hard times he with me good times he's with me this is the this should be the confession of the Bride hallelujah amen praise the Lord I'm so thankful that we can we can we can testify of God how he wants to be testified of cuz we're saying the same thing he's not three people he's not two people he's one person he's the Supreme one amen praise the Lord now we are are we still there okay we'll go to the next one he says yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it as its own mouthpiece So it's talking its own opinions as opposed to the word of God so God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter of Revelation 17 ver verse the F and the bride say come once more the world will head direct from God is at Pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated as in judge strong as in the first age amen so once more he says the the voice of God will be in her yes it is so remember this is where God's voice is going to come from the word of God comes into you transforms your life and it speaks out right it's quite quite a simple thing it comes in then it manifests out hallelujah amen so the so the voice of God is in you brother Braham says that if a a anointed man spirit filled man takes the word of word of God in his heart speaks it across his lips he says it's the same as deity speaking nothing can stand before that man that's what he says I mean so he's saying basically it's not that man speaking anymore or that woman it is God himself taking a vessel of clay using their vocal cords using their lips using their tongue to speak his word through them hallelujah hallelujah this is this is the condition he's put you in by his blood amen amen by the baptism of the Holy Ghost so he says once more the world will he direct from God is at Pentecost I believe this is the this is a time where the world is hearing from God Amen cuz cuz what happened on the day of Pentecost it was the Fulfillment of Prophecy you know when when when the Holy Ghost came down filled them in the upper room they walked out like drunk people amen you know you know you know the uh the the Jews outside were making fun but Peter said no we're not drunk as you suppose but this is that spoken by the prophet Joel amen so now so so so Peter put them back into the scripture saying the prophecy you've read about you've heard about in the synagogues is living right in front of you that we are the embodiment the manifestation of what Joel was inspired to write I mean so now it was the world was hearing direct from God because the world was seeing God put on flesh am mean so was no longer prophecy it was now reality amen so now we can look at you should be look yourself in the mirror and say God by his Supreme Grace has made me the Fulfillment of Prophecy Lord amen you take even acts acts two Real Simple Thing repent be baptized name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises to you to your children those are as far off in New Zealand and as many as the Lord Our God shall call amen so now you have become the embodiment of that word it's no longer a nice idea on to argue about in the scripture because people will debate about baptism all the time it's no longer a debate it's now a reality amen so now what are you now you are the become the voice of God to this world why CU because the world is seeing God manifest himself hallu hallelujah amen I'm so thankful that we that that that God has made us such that we're more interested in living the world than debating it this world is full of debate on the scripture and brother and sisters about this last agage he says he says you have the word you have more Bibles than ever but you're not doing anything about the word except dividing and hacking it into pieces taking what you want leaving what you don't want you're more you're not interested in living it but debating it and I'm so thankful the Lord has made you and I that we're interested Lord I want you to live that's actually all I care about Lord is for you to live in my life am mean you to you to be glorified in my life Lord I'm not interested in debates and arguments and all these things those things don't help no one amen number one helps people is when they see the power of God the sweetness of the Holy Ghost living out of your life that they recognize there's something different about you more than how you dress more than how you talk all those things but there's a life that is coming out of you and they can see this person's more than just religious but there's a presence they love to be around like there's people in our lives friends of ours they're not Christians at all but they love to be around us and I believe it's not well certainly not me but you know maybe it's Christine's cooking and her loveing Hospitality but you know but but but they just love to be around us and I believe it's because the Holy Ghost they're attracted that that they don't know what they're being drawn to but it's God I believe it's the Lord amen and and and I'm sure you've got people in your lives like that they just love to be around you amen they may not see what you see or even have any kind of Faith but there but there's something in them that that that is attracted amen I believe that's one of the greatest things you could ever have is you have a atmosphere around you of the Holy ghost that's different to the spirit of the world amen amen so we're interested we're interested in living it not not debating it am mean you see now this world has its own voice and it declares because if you look here in Revelations 3 again he says because thou sayest I am rich and increase with Goods have need of nothing so there's a so the world is saying one thing but the spirit of God is saying another thing right so so this world is is is speaking but it's not in harmony with the word of God but when a when when anyone amen surrenders their life to the Lord and God fills them with the Holy Ghost then they will begin to say the things that the spirit says I mean you see now this is this is the sad state of this world we live in but God God has God has changed us in such a way that we can see the spirit and the bride are saying come we're saying the same thing now brother says about this the preacher called to live his I mean the I mean the the preachers called to preachers talking about sermons and live it too if you can't live it then stop preaching it but you're supposed to live your sermons he says all right here was voices oh we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices I say we need thousands of lived voices here in the Wellington region I mean the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish am mean yes sir real Christians that's Thunder against the enemy if you want to give the devil a black eye you live this way right it's not much how much you can jump and holler and scream and run and all these things no it's an undefiled it's a pure holy Sweet Life That's the Thunder that shakes the devil I mean the devil don't care how much you can how loud you can Hollow the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you do this or shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil hallelujah amen ain't that powerful amen because yo that's the great secret it's not how much you got in your top two inches that shakes the devil it's a sweet loving holy life that's why it's so important never have any ought against anyone at all ever never have any ill feelings never have any kind of wall hardness but never let that come come into your heart whatsoever always be sweet loving kind never let any or come in whatever you do because that's what because that's the devil's great sneaky tactic as he say if I can just get ought in that person that because of them and what they've done you know it'll become a filter that that person will just will operate through that filter you know like someone for example they get a be in their Bonnet about someone they will look through at everyone else through that filter and that's the thing I'll talk about not necessarily referring to that person but they'll start operating differently based on that filter who's who understands what I'm meaning right so so we should never oh well this person you know they've done this to me or they say this or they believe this therefore I'm going to swing the other way and go to extreme that's that is not the right way to live God has ordained that the word walk right down the middle love and Holiness loving everybody do they agree with you no but you can love them anyway the Lord amen have they been mean to you yeah but you can still love them right you can see see we should you it doesn't matter what people have done to us in our lives we should have it that when we pray for them or you know we should feel sorry for them we should never feel angry or bitter or resentful or or they deserve that they deserve to be here in the tribulation they no we should never have that in our minds we should be Lord I want them in glory land I want them to join the Holy Angel Band too Lord irrespective of what they've done where where you where their current direction is we should never say well they should have done better this is their fault blah blah blah no we should never feel that way we should always have a sweet loving Pure Life cuz that will that's the Thunder that shakes the devil amen because the devil hates that life that's the thing that that's the thing that really shakes him yeah the devil laughs at all kinds of other things but when he sees that life amen because remember the the bride the spirit of the I'd say come but it's a living thing it's more than just saying words cuz anyone can read that scripture but it's got to be manifested it's got to be living amen amen and you got to realize now if you're saying come we know we have a message and if you got a message the reason we can say come is because we got a destination for them right we don't just have an empty just come to a building come to some theology come to this understanding even more than just saying come to God Senter prophit no it's come to The Living Waters come to Christ revealed in this day trust it didn't offend anyone you see because because the message is more than God said to Prophet right you know if the disciples you know if John if the Disciples of John were saying look God sent a prophet and messiah's there they've missed the whole thing right Messiah was on Earth so the purpose of John was to point the the the people to the Messiah and he did but if the Disciples of John just were pointing people to John they they've missed the whole message right and Messiah his word is upon the Earth right now right this message was to introduce Jesus Christ to the world and it's done that did it not introduce Jesus Christ to you amen so we're got a place that people can come come find rest amen even this church when I was really birth you know we that prayer meeting we first had I know pretty much none of us were here back then but you know just a few of us but the you know the Lord repeated a few years ago he said if you remain humble my word will continue to go forth and I'll bring my people here and they'll find rest so in other words if we remain humble a call will go out come come take the Waters of Life freely come find Rest by his great great pools of water and you know come come come lay down under the Shady trees and you know all these things come find rest and we've seen people find rest for their souls amen why cuz the call went out come but there's got to be a humility behind that call it can't be an arrogant call we can't be arrogant thinking we're better than the person on the street we're not better than them we're not better than the people that come here on a Saturday we ain't better than anyone it's God's Supreme Grace that found us it's God's Supreme Grace that keeps us we ain't better than anyone else so never get that in your mind oh we're better than the oh just the nominal church and we're this and what no no forget it who found you you didn't find yourself who keeps you it ain't you who's leading you well it shouldn't be you it's him hallelujah amen praise the Lord I'm just trying to find where I am now there's there's always wait let's see if I can find this here now brother raham speaks about as we read here about that we would be um white rment would be received okay come to me and you know and white Rond that thou mayest be clothed now brother B says that the isav that that that we're called to put on that we can see is free but there but there's a price in those garments because in order to say come to you know in order to say the same thing as the spirit says we're going to be separated to him right we can't be caught up in the things of the world and this is really really boils down to what's going on in our hearts cuz we can look the part we can dress the part we can speak the part but what's going on here right because it's really a separation and here is really the most important thing then it'll be everywhere else right so now he says here he says that there is a price to pay for those garments and that is the price of Separation now many people think of Separation as of I can't do this I can't do that I can't do here that may be part of it but that's not real separation that's a that's a monastery mentality living in some place somewhere you know that's not real separation it's a separation in the heart cuz remember we're separated from one thing but we're separated from one thing to another thing so for example when I was when I was in the world I was separated to the world I thought like the world I partied like the world I drank like the world I gamed like the world I didn't even like the world I was separated to the World by my first birth right but then the Lord interrupted that and said no no no you're separated to the wrong thing you're mine child you're mine my son so what did he do he came into my life I gave my life over to him then he separated my me to him so from the world to him amen now there's a great power in that now there's a call that always go out goes out in every age his um sorry Lily I you I don't have too many pictures today but we'll get to some now okay she says put pictures in so now here they are worshiping the golden Cal then then then Moses comes down from the mountain and he makes this call who is on the Lord's Side I mean so so when before Moses came in with this call there was everyone was mixed everyone was doing their own thing they were worshiping the Cal they worshiping the god of their imagination whatever's hashtag trending on some social media thing but then A call came into the camp who's on the Lord's Side come unto me and something in the sons of Levi said yes amen I'm coming amen so they gathered themselves to Moses why cuz there was a call and God was basically saying I want to put a new garment on you I want to put white garments on you but the cost was they had to separate themselves from what was going on to to Moses amen I tell you that separation is worth it it pays off amen it really pays off because you got to realize you know the devil gets it in your mind well you're just going to be put in a prison and have no fun I'll tell you what friends you ever meet God it's the most fun you ever have in your life it's the most fulfilling joyful life you could ever have cuz I remember many a many a morning any day of the you know any day of the week waking up with a hangover not remembering what I did just full of regret amen but I remember being at camp meetings drunk on the spirit realizing I was drunk on the spirit staring around praising God there wasn't a hangover there was no regret amen it was just all awesome and I wanted more of it hallelujah amen so it depends what you separ it's worth being separated to God Amen it doesn't just pay off in death it pays off in life amen it pays off for every day of your life is worth it amen so never let some enticing Spirit try and tell you there's nothing to serving God there's everything amen there's youo this word is full of reality amen it's it's it's not Theory it's reality amen the moving of the spirit is a real thing am mean for God to transform a life it's a real thing am mean it's more than just a you know more than just a trying to patch up your life no God changes Our Lives Hallelujah now this price yeah you these white garments might yeah you see this is why there's such a thing in this day there's a cause for basically any group under heaven right now there's striving environment anything pollution race gender countries War whatever it is wokeism all these things there's causes what is it trying to do it's trying to break our separation it's trying to it's trying to it's trying to steal white robe off people that's what it's trying to do cuz it's cuz it cost separate you got to be separated from those things to have this white robe right so we can't be caught up in the ideology of this world it doesn't matter how close to home it gets I tell you before Titus came and destroyed Jerusalem it was real close to home to the Israeli you know the Jewish Christians that they were being oppressed by Rome they were living in Jerusalem cuz Jesus said when when the enemy en campuses about the city pray that your flight's not in Sabbath on snowy day and just flee to the hills he prophesied of it right so for the Jewish Believers back then there was a real pressure from their from their unbelieving neighbors because there was a there was this pressure building up we're going to overthrow these Romans look at what they've done to us look look what they've done to your blood kin it was real close to home for those Jewish Believers there I mean they weren't indifferent to it they could relate to the sufferings of their countrymen because they were one of them but they realized they're more than just a Jew they're part of God I mean so so so when all that stuff happened and imagine the pressure maybe maybe your you know your neighbor here Levi comes along he says Benjamin you see what they did to my daughter the other day see what these Romans are doing we're going to have a meeting Benjamin there's an uprising we're getting weapons in we're going to we're going to kill the serpent the words prophesied we're going to be free we're going to be free Jehovah's going to send his Messiah you better be you're either for us or against us Benjamin which one are you look you're one of us you're a circumcised son of Abraham went to the same synagogue we're the same family you better you better side with this otherwise you're a traitor to your nation imagine the pressure they're under but they had white robes on they were separated from those things because they realized God was greater than what was going on and then Messiah told them doesn't matter what they try and do that that place was doomed and I I'm sorry to say it friends this world is doomed no one will make any country great again it's gone but God has given us white ropes to be separated from every pull of this world that we can walk undefiled and white that when the Call Comes we're going home do I am I not sad for this world I'm sad for this world people are dying suffering everywhere but the only answer is not us trying to rebuild a nation or a continent or a group am mean our only hope is the Lord Jesus Christ The Prince of Peace coming amen so if we want to keep these white robs be separated from those things amen sure you pray for those people pray God open their eyes that there's a way out of this place and they're not going to go into a Slaughter you ever look at that you look at a documentary of that Siege of Jerusalem that was a horrible thing that was a horrible thing blood literally rolled out the streets when the Romans butchered everyone it was terrible the things they endured and when I maybe I put it on the WhatsApp I don't know but when I saw that and I just saw the saw the energy of those Jewish people trying to deliver their I bleed I cried for that oh God these people put such an effort into trying to deliver their Kingdom trying to deliver their Capital but you already prophesied it's gone and they gave their lives for nothing we don't want to be in that category I don't know why I've gone this way but here I am we don't want to be caught up in those things it won't help nothing because this world is being prophesied it's doomed well should we plan for the future absolutely should we have Ambitions absolutely should we make have families get married absolutely maybe in 100 years maybe tomorrow but live enjoy life in the Lord don't be don't be in despair with this world's you know what's going to happen God has it in his hand but I'm saying be separated from it don't be pulled by all these things no matter how close to home it is to you you know you can maybe put yourselves exactly in in in that suffering but be separated from it cuz there's power in that separation amen when the angel of the Lord came to came to um uh Manar and his wife came to the wife of Manar about Samson being born and the instructions were that she was commanded to keep herself from from strong drink and all these things amen strong drink and so if I can find it drink not wine nor strong drink no eat uh eat not any unclean thing so be separated and but there was a purpose in that separation it wasn't to make her life hard it was the fact that out of her was going to come a deliverer I mean that would start to break the Yoke of the enemy amen that Samson would be born out of that family and you know what the name man no means rest it means rest so here's a man and his wife living in a chaos of the time of Judges but they're living in rest and he's told be separated and the deliverer is going to come out of you what happens when a church is separated to God what happens when a body of people love the Lord one heart one mind one Accord what happens a the the the deliverer comes forth I mean the Lord comes down begins to set captives Free Break the bands of the Philistines of people's lives break that cruelty of sin off people's lives why because there's are people that are separated because we we see the value of Separation we've seen the power of Separation we've seen what it does amen hallelujah and what did it produce it produce Sam well you say well Samson didn't give his heart to God forget that it brought a deliverer he killed more in his death than in his life amen so he actually died Victorious amen but that's what that's what that's what separation produced he picked up a Jawbone of a of an ass of a donkey he killed a thousand men carried the gates of Gaza and the frames 40 odd miles up a hill he did incredible things why cuz he was separated to God Amen brother R says he wasn't some big muscle Hulk guy Hulk smash kind of a guy he was a little bitty shrimp but he had he was living in that Nazarite vow and that's what gave him the power amen because he was separated to the Lord he was saying or living what the spirit said amen friends if a man under the blood of bulls and goats didn't even give his whole life to the Lord if he could do this how much more people that don't just give part of their lives but have given everything and they're not under the blood of bulls and goats but they're under the blood of Jesus Christ and God doesn't just come and anoint them from time to time but God comes and dwells in their vessel amen how much more what we could do what God could do in you and I amen when we speak his word and God comes in behinds it and amens it amen to prove that it's true prove our life is right oh Lord come live in a greater way Hallelujah I'm going to I'm going to wind up soon but you know here's another one the prodical son when he was raised up in his in his father's house he wasn't separated to to how his father wanted life to be his heart was in the world he wanted to go out and try things and live he thought it so restricted you know you just just working for his father didn't see the value of where he was living so he he took his inheritance he went and wasted it all but then it said then he came to himself he came to himself he realized actually the separation of being separated from the pig pen cuz he cuz his heart caused him to end up in a pig pen and that's where every human heart that's unconverted you end up in a pig pen somewhere it may look fancy may look horrible but it's still a pig pin nonetheless but you see now what he did is he came to himself in the pig pin and he realized to be to be in his father's house to be separated from this thing was far more valuable than trying to just live off this you know the scraps of a pig brother Ram says that the angel of the Lord came into the pig pen and made him come to himself Hallelujah you see the value of a Praying Mom and Dad that's right you see the power of it amen and so he comes home barefoot in rags his father comes and Embraces him you know the son feels he's not worthy to be C called a son anymore he just wants to be called a servant he ain't speaking like his father the spirit and the bride I say is not saying the same thing yet amen the bride I say the son has to come and confess who he is so then so then what does what does this father do he Embraces his son he says bring forth the best robe not just a robe bring forth the best robe amen we're robed with the righteousness of Christ CH it's not just a robe it's not a just a religious thing that we're robed with we're robed with the best robe eternal life the word of God the righteous of Christ amen put a ring on his hand my authority is now in his hand what he says as good as me saying it Hallelujah why cuz now he's he he he he's been separated from the world he's come back to Father's house and now his father knows because he's seen such a change in his son's life he know knows that what his what what his son says is the same as him saying it cuz I say the same thing amen and what has the Lord done cuz remember when we when we really when you think about every trial we've come through every crunch Point what is the conclusion of our whole the matter we come to a place that we confess what God has said is right isn't that right really you know when all the Mind battles go away and we look into the word we go into our source of strength what do we do we begin to to say the same thing the spirit has already said hallelujah amen and what is God showing us teaching Us in those things that he has actually put his ring of authority on your hand amen remember we're not saying what a Bible School says not saying second opinions 8 says we're saying what he has already said amen so now he's got the best robe amen now he's now he's been given this ring of authority and he's got shoes on his feet so now he can walk who's ever ran across stones and bare feet who's ever run yeah I remember so so my grandparents uh live next door to me growing up they had prickles in their grass man they had prickles who knows prickles right we had to we had to kind of map out in our minds where to run to get to their front door it wasn't a straight line it was there and there around the tree and up here because we had to avoid all the prickles but then when we had shoes on I'm gone straight I ain't making these detours these needless detours because I've been dressed in a way that I can walk straight am mean that the that the conditions of the world that I'm walking are not going to make me Veer left or right I mean why cuz I got shoes on my feet and it's the same thing with you and I amen when the Lord has placed shoes on our feet amen that that that we don't have to change our path based on what's Happening from the outside no but because of what's on the inside we can walk straight in the word of God I mean we don't have to vear left or right and worry about what's going oh no this prickle can't get I can see it I know it can affect me but I'm dressed right God has given me the best robe he's put shoes on my feet I mean and the reason I can walk straight is because now I'm saying the same thing as he is hallelujah amen friends we got a message we've got a I was going to wrap up just as the last one all all the pictures little all the pictures the woman at the well went from debating with the Messiah to to declaring come see a man right so her and and the Lord said the same thing here was the bride put into action how long did it take it to be put into action a brief conversation now I haven't I you maybe go read John 4 and see and maybe time yourself from when they start talking to when she starts running just a few minutes just a few minutes in the presence of the Lord amen caus her to drop her water pot drop her old life drop the complexes remember she went to the well by herself cuz she wasn't welcome with the woman so she went as an outcast but then she went back into that same city telling the same people that did not make her feel
