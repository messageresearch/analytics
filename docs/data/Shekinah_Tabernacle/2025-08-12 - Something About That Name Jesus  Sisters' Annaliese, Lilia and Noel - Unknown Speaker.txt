TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Tender as a whisper and louder as we pray. May it hang on my lips for the rest of my lives. There is something in the name of Jesus. It sounds like forgiveness. Sounds like amazing grace. It begins my soul to sing forever. There's just something about that name. We pray it over family. We rise and we sleep. We speak it over sorrow and the soul is given peace. We sing it in the famine or in prosperity. May we never forget that he is all that we need. There is something about the name of Jesus. It sounds like forgiveness sounds like amazing grace. It beggings my soul to sing forever. Is something about thy name? Still know the name. You still have the vow to save. You can empty any name forever. Jesus is your name. There is still no other name. You still have the power to save. You can empty [Music] [Applause] forever. Jesus is your name. It is only about the name of Jesus. It sounds like for you. It sounds like amazing grace. It begs your soul to sing forever. There's just something about that. There's just something about that. Something about thy name. [Music] [Applause]
