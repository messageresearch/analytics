Isaiah 59 read a couple of scriptures here and amen it's good to see everyone here this morning just going to read from um verse verse 19 here I don't have verse 21 on on the slides but we'll go to um we'll read down to verse 21 see you here now so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him and the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob sayeth the Lord as for me this is my Covenant with them sayith the Lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed sayith the Lord from hence forth and forever I me what an incredible promise amen let's let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning as we as we dedicate Our Lives to the Lord amen precious Lord Jesus truly Lord you are everything Lord we adore you this morning we want to praise you lift you up high give you glory due unto Your Name Lord because you are the king of kings and Lord of lords and your name is a name above every name father we just want to commit Our Lives into your hands ask asking that you would anoint speaker and hearer anoint your word Lord come living Our Lives Lord touch our hearts draw us ever closer to you father meet every need here or those who may be streaming Lord I pray you'd be their portion we love you Lord we just want to ask that youd take over lord may your blood cover us all protect us Lord live through US father and have your way in this service Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats uh this morning so I want to I want to continue a bit on from from uh uh last Sunday about how the Lord is our absolute the word of God is our absolute amen above opinion or ideas of man or uh you know our feelings even but but his word is our absolute now if we look into the scripture here I want to speak about the uh the eagle anointing that's coming this day of the Holy Ghost and and we have read here in Isaiah 59 that the Lord actually places the scripture in the end time because he says that so they that fear the name of the Lord from the West so there's a position that's all this is significance you see because Isaiah is standing here prophesying this he's in the East so he's saying that so so so there's something that's going to come from the West that's going to bring the fear of the Lord and His glory from the rising of the sun now we understand that that that we live in a season of a rest restoration of all things that was prophesied in the Bible so there' be a restoration of a bride a church coming back to a true Pentecostal book of Acts life amen with a where the spirit of God doesn't just anoint them but lives in them manifests his word through them so there's so saying this it's from his glory from the rising of the sun now I don't think it was a haphazard thing that brother Bram would preach a sermon it is the rising of the sun saying now that we live in a season where where where there was a night time but now the sun is rising there's a restoration now and me you know it's like there's a reason why the Middle Ages was called the Dark Ages amen because we know the church at um uh you know under persecution you under Rome and all these things went down into the ground for about a thousand odd years and there wasn't a lot of movement of the spirit of God the you know but God said I will restore and then we know that you know Martin Luther and the Reformation came but it would come a but but that was a day of of uh you know man's Creed still mixed in with the word of God but then God said there'll be another day come where where it'll be restoration back to the first day again so when the when so when the prophet said you know he he made the announcement it is the rising of the sun he's saying that now now there's we've gone back to that first day again when the spirit of God Has Come back into the Earth in its full power am mean where the Creeds of man are no longer lifted up but now the word of God is lifted up amen that that everything they had back in the book of Acts has been restored back into the church so we are living in this day amen so so something that would come from the West we could see I'm sorry I'm probably covering a lot of things just as a pre thing but you look at Revival how it went from Jerusalem and went West right and now the gospel's gone to the West Coast of of America now it's gone back East again so something happened what what happened in the west the seal came open the quickening power came back into the church amen but it also says and the Redeemer shall come to Zion so it's not just not just a uh sorry um so so who is Zion now we know Zion speaks of the Bride so so the Redeemer shall come dwell in his people now he says here when this happens then the enemy shall come in like a flood now I was sitting in Sunday School uh this morning and sister Shantel brought this out very well a flood is just a lot of water a trickles not much water so the enemy will come in in a great abundance right so the enemy's always been here we know we know that right but but he says the enemy shall come in like a flood now um we know as Bible readers that if you look into Revelations chapter 9 the enemy comes in like a flood when the bottomless pit comes open and it's it's between the first and second war or the first or second world war the enemy is coming like a flood but the Lord said I'll lift up a standard against him amen so the so the Lord has never left his people people unable to overcome the enemy he's never left us helpless hopeless you know never left us just with an intellectual understanding to try and combat the devil with his Spirit has always been upon the Earth Amen to overcome in whatever age amen and in this age he said the Lord said I'll lift up a standard now when a standard is raised it's placed in a place of preeminence it's lifted high right it's not placed on the ground is lifted High amen and we know standard is a place if you you know look at old medieval battles and things the Roman times they would have standards that the men would rally around and it was a great shame if their standards were captured by the enemy so was a place that they could lift up they could look above the chaos of the battlefield and they could see where their standard was if their standard would retreat they would Retreat if it went forward they went forward with the colors because they had to to protect that standard and where that standard was was was where the men were meant to be now the Lord Has Lifted up a standard in this day he has made his word he's lifted up his word in this end time am mean to make the promises more real make them more tangible make them make them you know I'm so thankful we don't sit here with a spirit of unbelief saying the days of Miracles is passed amen but now we are sitting here with a with a heart saying Lord You're the same yesterday today and forever every promise you've given is Yan amen for this day amen we're not looking for something in the future to come but you've already revealed the truth of your word amen so we're not looking for well I wish I lived back there with the apostles I say thank you Lord that you're the same God back there you're the same God today hallelujah amen so when the enemy comes in like a flood he'll lift up a standard he'll he'll prove his word amen is right it works amen it will be set in a place of preeminence and I trust as Christians this morning his word has a place of preeminence in our lives I mean it's not a it's not a lucky rabbit's foot it's not you know you don't just call upon the Lord when you know you're in trouble you have a time of need but you call upon him all the time because he's number one in your life I remember before I became a Christian it was only in time of trouble I'd really call upon the Lord I remember when my parents lived in American SAR a cyclone came through flattened all the trees where we lived apart from the coconut trees and the next morning after this thing came through we had to go with machetes and and and cut down all the Fallen trees so my dad could get out and go see if his workplace was still there and I remember calling upon the Lord when I'm imagine that you're in this you're in this Cyclones gone through these big massive gusts are blowing through so much noise of the wind going through the trees and the things above you are coconut trees and they're Laden with coconuts one of those things would take you out I was calling on the Lord cutting trees and looking and you know all this but it was he was like a lucky rabbit's foot to me it was only in time of trouble I called upon him right but then after that well I forgot about him went back into my life and back into the world and all these things but you see now when you let him become number one in your life and he transforms your life life changes you fills you with the Holy Ghost he's number one all the time he's not just a god of convenience he's God over everything hallelujah amen so we're living in a day where the standard of the word of God has been has been raised into a place of of of preeminence in our lives this is what this message came to do amen will show that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday yesterday today and forever you know to show that Divine Healing Works show that God has still what he promised in his word to do set gifts in the church come live in the people's lives amen give overcoming power over sin amen it is still right here today praise the Lord amen so Zion we understand as the bride so when the Lord does this he won't just raise up a standard but he'll come living his people he will come to Zion trust he's come to you this morning am mean he lives in your heart he's given you an anointing am mean of his presence amen now we're just going to I thought it was interesting that we sung the Revelation song uh before service now we don't talk about we never you know plan all these things but you know we're just going to go to Revelations chapter 4 because I want to talk about the eagle anointing um that that is upon the church excuse me we're just going to do a bit of reading this morning so we're just going to go to Revelations uh 4 and and two just to set the scene here this is John he's on the spirit of the Lord's day he's caught up amen uh into the throne room of God and he begins to see see as a um symbolically everything up there CU because a book of symbols and a book of Prophecy is the Book of Revelation now in Revelations 4:2 says immediately I was in the spirit and behold there was a throne set in heaven and one sat on the throne and he that was sat um and he that sat was to look upon like Jasper and the Sardine um sardin Stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in the sight like unto an emerald and round about The Throne were 4 and 20 elders and upon the seats I saw four and and 4 and 20 Elders sitting clothed in white rment and they had on their heads crowns of gold and out of the throne proceeded Lightnings and Thunders and voices and there were seven lamps of the fire um of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God now we know that God is one Spirit but it's seven you know God pouring out his spirit in seven different manners right or by measure I should say instead of without measure now here we are and Before the Throne there was set a um a sea of glass like under crystal in the midst of the throne and round about the Throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind now this is important because when we come to the seals and the moving of the Antichrist there's an order that these beasts come out to combat okay this is why I'm reading this and Before the Throne there was this um sorry and the first Beast was like a lion and the second beast was like a calf and the third Beast had a face as a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle okay so keep that in your mind maybe maybe I'll just put this up here we'll just we'll just keep that up shall we just as a picture and then if you in your Bibles you want to go to go to Revelations chapter 6 now it says when the lamb would take the book and open the seals oh sorry here is me leaving this and I'm changing things okay he says uh one of the one of the four boy sorry and and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and behold and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer now if you look at the symbology of this white horse rider and you look at Revelations chap 19 you can go away there's a bit of homework you can see that they they're not the same person because here we've read about a about about a rider he's given a bow no arrows and he and he was crowned and he went forth conquering to conquer but then Revelations 19 we have we have a white horse rider his his his Visage is I mean his vestments are dipped in the you know in the blood of God his name is called the word of God a sharp two-edged sword goes out of his mouth he's crowned with many crowns so one has no your one Crown a bow no arrows No Name the other one has a name the word of God many crowns and it's sharp to it saw comes out of his mouth so the one of Revelations 19 is Christ This one is not this is the Antichrist riding forth but you see before this rider ever rides forth now one of the Beast has come and see okay so now the second one says and I had this and and I opened the second seal and I heard the second beast say come and see now I'm just going to skip down here to to to verse 5 and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast say come and see okay and then now verse 7 and when he opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see now all this is significant now here the first Beast that we read about in Revelations chapter four was a lion so now when the Antichrist Spirit rode forth because John said the Antichrist spirit is already in the world so God never leaves his people unequipped to overcome what the enemy is doing never never never this is you know if you don't get anything out of the serice but that God you've equipped me to overcome in my age amen the anointing of the Holy Ghost You' have poured out in this age is more than enough to overcome my enemy okay so if that's all you get I'm happy about that okay you see so so so the first Beast had the face of a lion okay so so when this Antichrist deceptor Spirit rode forth you know there was a lion anointing of the Holy Ghost went out to combat it amen because you look at Paul he had a he had a real boldness about him even when even when that deceptive Spirit started to influence Peter who is a anointed Son of God filled with the Holy Ghost but he began to withdraw himself you know you know from eating with the Gentiles because Jews had come along he's being influenced by how women to be separated but you see when Paul heard about this and when and and spoke to Peter he was stood him face to face why it was a boldness about him it was a lion anointing to overcome what the white horse rider was doing of course Peter being a Son of God came out of that delusion and begin to and begin to eat with the Gentiles because we're all one body anyway amen but then what happened is is is with the second writer I didn't read it but you know it's now riding a white horse has been given a sharp toyed sword and makes war and all these things and if you look at church history then what happened is is is the Antichrist changed from just a deceptive Spirit now but then that you know that Spirit was crowned by Constantine and then and then the false church had had had political power behind it and there was a great martydom go on all those things so so what what did God give the church to overcome that was a a a beast of sacrifice anointing they gladly gave their lives they gladly went to the arena they gladly got tortured and it wasn't humanly them just their stubbornness saying I ain't going to bow it was an anointing upon them to overcome Hallelujah so so so they gladly gave their lives they weren't afraid of death because they realized that their last breath here would be their first breath over there am mean if you think about it when they went into the arena because it wasn't natural how they died with joy and that they rejoicing saying that were counted worthy I me to suffer like they you know suffer and give their lives if you think about before they went into the you know went into the arena maybe the you know maybe one of them you know this is just me but no doubt you'd see a line out there and something would anoint you and say soon and very soon I'm going to see the one I love this thing is just a gateway to get me to where I want to be I mean whom having not seen yet love hallelujah amen so they were given that Beast of sacrifice anointing of the Holy Ghost to overcome right but then but then what happened is is the um you know to to overcome the next move because what happened is then a black horse rider came forth now it's the same Rider all the time right he just changes how he does things okay and so so then the black horse rider came along with a scale in his hand and a measure of wheat for you know corn and all these things and but but then a voice came from the throne saying touch not the oil and the wine I mean so this is more than just an econom IC thing is actually is actually what happened is the church would say you've got to pay to have salvation you've got to you've got to pay physical money to get anything from God but then God anointed men like Martin Luther and even well before him John whitecliffe and you know they were like no the just shall live by faith it's your faith amen that you know justifies you not the money you pay not the Penance you do but it's your faith in Jesus Christ alone and that still stands today very much Hallelujah but so but but then that voice said from the the throne touch not the oil and the wine so there's no restriction now on the on the on the oil which is the anointing of God I mean because the anointing oil represented the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the scripture so so don't touch that Satan you can't stop that and don't touch the wine which is a stimulation by the revelation of the spirit amen so so so now God actually because God always sets restrictions on his enemy amen with job right job you know God said to Job I mean God sorry Satan said to God about job he only worships you because everything's going fine for him so God set boundaries around Satan Satan you can touch everything he has but not him do you think Satan wouldn't have tried to push against that but he couldn't override God's commandment right and then Satan went uh went back up before God and God basically could have said to him I told you so because he knows the end from the beginning and you know and then Satan says well it's the only reason he still loves you is because he's got his health and then so God said to Satan okay you can afflict them but you can't kill him Satan went to the in you know to the very limit of that but God but he could not override God's commandment Glory we to realize friends that you know sometimes the accuser Goes Up Before the Throne of God and God testifies to his enemy about you saying have you ever have you considered my servant have you considered my bride there's none like them upon the Earth if God could testify of job being a perfect man under the blood of bulls and goats now how much more are people under the blood of Jesus Christ amen that the blood of Jesus Christ does more than just covers sin it annihilates sin it changes our nature amen the spirit of God comes and dwells in you hallelujah amen so remember you're going through a trial you're got to realize the devil's been set restrictions amen he can't override what God has allowed him to do amen and what God has allowed him to do will bring the glory of God into your life hallelujah amen but then you see now it was the wisdom of man with translating the Bible G the Bible into the hands of the people but then we've gone beyond that now to an eagle anointing the prophet tells us when the seals came open the eagle anointing begin to fly now I want you to think about this there's only one of those creatures that that is not Earthbound right all the others are Earthbound they can only see from the vage point they're standing at but an eagle can fly far high and it can see far right so this anointing that we have received of the Holy Ghost makes us see beyond even what other ages have seen right but then also it doesn't just cause us to see now I just want to come back to this I got it here I can find this it does more than just cause us to see it has a voice now how this is written is significant the first three writers it just says come and see I mean I mean mean I mean beasts right but the fourth one says and I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see so this fourth Beast has a voice right now this is important because we got to realize we're not just passive in the battle right we're not just standing here yes I can see you know like we can see from eternity to Eternity amen when this anointing strikes you you can see you came from God you're going back to God am me before the foundation of the world like like job let's look at one Eagle who's sitting in a time of Crisis and God would come down and speak to him say where were you you job when I lay the foundations of the Earth where were you when the morning Stars s together that all the sons of God shouted for Joy what was that job was sitting on an ash Heap but God anointed him to say look job I want you to know where you were in the beginning you weren't when I saw you in my mind job I did not see you as a as a man full of boils losing everything not understanding sitting on an ash Heep this is not how I dang you to be job you're just in a hickey called time and this is what the devil's come against you with but job I want you to realize this is how I saw you singing rejoicing around the Throne of God hallelujah and this how I saw you in the beginning is how how you going to end up in the End Amen because if God ordained us thus we're going to end up that same way sure we'll come through trials and troubles and tribulations and all these things but what God has ordained us to be we're going to end up that way Hallelujah and I just put there Revelation 22:21 it's a last scripture in the Bible right so God causes us to see right before the foundation of the world to the End Amen this is what this prophetic anointing does this why you know yeah I'm so thankful for this time this end time message we have received gives us such a stability that yes I'm in a trial yes all these things are going on but see we're not trying to we're not trying to overcome by the wisdom of man anymore the wisdom of man will never overcome the devil in this day the reasoning of your intellect will never overcome I mean remember Eve fell by reasoning in the garden right she reasoned against the word of God she fell because of reasoning that's why the Bible says cast down reasonings amen don't take see the devil always bring you a question yeah hath God said is it really that way is that really going to be that bad if you do this and this there's reasoning comes along what's that he's trying to get preeminence over your life he's trying to dominate your thinking amen but God has has anointed us that we can realize no matter what we're going through no matter what the struggle is the anointing of God is here to lift us out of that thing that we can see it for what it really is praise the Lord now an eagle can see further than any of these things faith has a long range Vision it's going to drop these things in this is this is how you're built remember an eagle's built to Sea and fly now brother Brown says and why Christ speak he says for you see Faith sees what God wants done oh I hope this goes in faith doesn't look at the present time Faith does doesn't see this here Faith sees what God wants and it works accordingly that's what faith does it sees what God wants and what God wants done and Faith operates through that faith is a long range Vision amen faith is a long range Vision an eagle has a long range Vision right so you're looking beyond the now aren't you thankful you can look beyond the now I mean it don't lower its sights it holds to the Target so Faith becomes how you when you look through eyes of faith when you look through eyes of Revelation it's done in your heart you've you know God has put it in your heart it's happening just like I he about Tamar revelate came from went from a hope so to a no so amen so what what's now faith has long range Vision don't look at the now and whatever you see now no the promis is she's coming home if I could just say it like that amen so Faith holds to that amen that's why it's so important when you're going through a battle get into the word of God and say Lord give me a revelation of your word help me to look through the situation through your word and not just something that I think is nice anchored into my Heart Lord what the promise is then then I can look through that and not through what My Five Senses declare not what my imagination conjures up not what my reasoning says are my affections but I can look through just through your word amen see it's got long range is a telescope it's a binocular uh that you don't look around here you don't use the binoculars to look to see what time it is see you don't use it like that but use binoculars to look away off and Faith does that Faith picks up God's binoculars both of them both sides the Old and New Testament and sees every promise that he made amen and Faith sees it out yonder and Faith chooses that regardless of what the present tense says here he looks at the end he don't drop his sights down to look at this way he looks out yonder and he keeps the cross here dead center on the word that's what faith does that's what that's the faith that's in a man that does those things I say that's the faith that's in a man woman or child that has this Eagle anointing amen looks to the end looks to the promise focuses you who's ever picked up binoculars and they're totally out of focus do you you just stand there and look at it like that just see a big fuzzy maybe two or three things no you you you focus it to what you're seeing is a clear image right and it's the same thing now with you and I you may be looking at the promise and it looks fuzzy it doesn't look like it's you know it doesn't make sense it seems very obscure what do you do you say Lord Focus me to your promise amen don't don't get frustrated at the binoculars amen but let God Focus your focus your binoculars that the promise becomes crystal clear and it jumps off the page amen let's let's let's look at an eagle here there you there's a few I want to come to us I feel like I'm running out of time but you know Abraham was an eagle he looked far beyond what was going on in the land amen when he met the Lord he began to look he met the maker of that City that he was looking for he met mesc and we know mesc was God without beginning a Days end of life without father or mother all these things you know you Paul picks it up makes it very clear he's Eternal the only one who's Eternal is God so Abraham met God he met the king of that City and so after he met the king of the city he be to looking for the city cuz Faith declared it was somewhere amen so he be to walk around the promised land where's that City I'm looking for the city he was an eagle he was looking far beyond because maybe he'd see someone you know talk to someone who didn't have this Eagle anointing and he'd say youo and you know this guy would ask him where are you going I'm looking for a city he look looking for ER you're looking for haran you're looking for Damascus you're looking for you know no I'm looking for a city that God built it's here somewhere and that person would look at Abraham and think that's a crazy old man he was the most sound-minded man in that whole planet am mean because he had an Eagle Vision and he was looking for that City now because he was looking for that City he wasn't caught up in all the Troubles of life it did not rule him it didn't mean he wasn't absent of trouble Abraham had a lot of trouble and strife going on but because he had an Eagle Vision he could look Beyond those things and say those things are just temporary I'm passing through them that's why when there was Strife between Abraham's herdsman and lot's herdsmen Abraham didn't say now listen lot God called me you're just coming here for a meal ticket you just I'm getting blessed and the reason you're blessed is because of me you take you take the second CL you you know you take the other pasture I'm getting the good stuff no he had Eagle Vision so so so when The Strife came up he just said to lot listen lot you just pick where to go I'll go the other way because what his his natural goods and what he had in this life wasn't his identity his identity was in the king of that City amen he was hallelujah amen so so that's why I said sure a lot you have the best but I'll go this way it's fine why cuz he was an eagle am mean he wasn't being caught up in the economics of the age there will be trouble there will be more trouble listen we're Eagles friends don't be troubled see this this whole world wants you to have a a a a Earthbound sight the opinions of man social media the news all these things that ain't Eagle Vision oh but the world's going to be you know people had so much hopes when when our government changed they ain't going to fix the world friends no one's going to fix the world the coming of Jesus Christ will fix this world amen so that's the only thing will help amen eagles look Beyond Hallelujah this got a couple more Eagles I got a couple of examples lilyia said make sure you put in lots of pictures I love my daughter any who here comes um this is this is Caleb and Joshua when they came back from searching out the land they gave the same report that the other 10 spies did but they said more than able to take it so so so Eagle vision sees the obstacles it's not some ostrich Vision that buries its head right Eagle vision sees the problems we don't we don't discount like sickness brother Ram says about a Cancer and you how can I overcome you don't deny you've got it sure you've got it but you got to realize the one in you has already overcome that thing Hallelujah that's real overcoming amen you realize whatever's come into my life the spirit of God within me has already overcome that thing amen cuz remember when he conquered HDE in the grave he conquered every enemy that can be named every enemy in existence has been conquered amen by our Lord Jesus Christ whether it be unbelief sickness depression trouble mind battles whatever it is amen loneliness whatever it is it's been conquered amen by our Lord Jesus Christ am mean so Caleb and Joshua they said yes the walls are tall they are giants they're big there's big all those things but they were looking beyond that I mean they were looking to the promise of God saying but God has given us the land amen but the other 10 spies they weren't they didn't have Eagle Vision they were Earthbound people saying we're grasshoppers in their sight we can never overcome see they were they didn't have the right kind of spirit but Caleb and Joshua did amen and when they were in the wilderness they weren't murmuring and complaining with the rest of Israel because they had Eagle Vision saying we are just passing through this Wilderness amen this is not our end destination sometimes a Wilderness can feel like it's a long time but you get to realize God's going to bring me of this thing I mean I'm not going to be here forever this is not my this is not my lotted Dwelling Place in the word of God but God's given me a land it's a good land of H you have the Holy Ghost moving of milk and honey and promises and the resurrection Hallelujah that's where God's given me that's where I'm going to dwell that's where I'm going to die as in Christ amen so they could look Beyond those things Hallelujah and where where did they end up Landing in their promise praise God they didn't discount the enemy but they said God's given it to to us amen let's go get it now Hallelujah an eagle can look beyond the emotion of what the church is even doing the church world is doing Micaiah would be there was King Ahab and King Jehoshaphat they went out to go they um they they wanted to go get back ramoth Gilead now it's interesting ramth gillad at once belonged to of course Israel the enemy had taken it and ramoth Gilead was a City of Refuge this was a significant loss to the to the Kingdom of Israel and so Ahab and Jehoshaphat they got together they said let's go let's go get back ramoth Gilead and so and so Ahab you know Jehosaphat asked for prophets to come and prophesy and you know Ahab had 400 Hebrew prophets and then so so they started to have a ministerial meeting and they got real enthused man they got excited they were jumping they were you know even the leader there so the guy in the right with his hands raised he's got some horns on his head even the whole leader of the whole church movement I mean made these made these iron horns and say by this you'll push the syrians out of the country they got super enthused but you see Jehoshaphat had a bit of Eagle about him he said thanks Ahab for these 400 prophets they're Hebrew prophets now you go read the scripture but then he says do you have one more imagine the look on ahab's face who maybe would have turned slowly and look at him saying what do you mean one more I got you 400 here man they've said thus sayith the Lord we're going to go get the land but you see Jehoshaphat wasn't quite sure about their discernment and then so some of the servants went to go get there's one more Ahab said I got one more it's called called Micaiah but I hate him he never prophesies good he never preaches me Prosperity but Jehoshaphat said okay well but just go get him so mik is invited and as as Mike is making his way to this big meeting the servant or whoever came to go get him say look this is what's been happening in these Services M's been Dynamic has been powerful you see all the brothers are up and there's Unity the church world has come back together remember there's Civil War I mean there a division you know Israel was divided into two kingdoms look they're they're reuniting amen that that this that the city can be restored that this you the kingdom can go forward an eagle looks beyond that an eagle looks beyond a political religious move this is what this was an eagle can look beyond that Mah said look I'm only going to say what the Lord's told me as the Lord liveth what the Lord saith unto me that will I speak so an eagle can look beyond the emotion and enthusiasm of something it can look well beyond how excited people are and all this Doctrine this truth and all these people get swept up in things he was an eagle so he prayed and he had a vision and in that Vision he saw a lying Spirit Come Out of Hell come up to heaven God was having a conference saying how can I get Ahab to come into battle that the words of my Prophet Elijah would be fulfilled remember Elijah what had you know had been taken up into Heaven by this stage and then so Micaiah came along Ahab you know you know before the king and then Micaiah you know sarcastically said go up the Lord's given you the victory and Ahab said to Jehoshaphat don't you see he always speaks evil against me and so Micaiah said listen I'll tell you what happened last night you got 400 prophets here you're all enthused you're all excited and they put a pressure on me to bow to what they're saying an eagle don't bow Eagle don't bow to human influence you see and this he said look last night I was praying I saw this evil spirit go into heaven because in heaven God was having a God was having a conference saying how can we cause Ahab to fall in battle to fulfill the words of Elijah this lying Spirit went up said I I'll do it can you imagine and then and then to the leader of this Ministerial Association smacked ma in the mouth saying from whence did the spirit of God come out of me and go unto you because because they they they took the anointing that they had received and they thought well this must be God we're all enthused we're here to that the kingdom will go forward but it was a lying Spirit and the problem is they never took their enthusiasm or their influence I mean or their inspiration back to the word of God but Micaiah being a true e um true Eagle could take his vision and subject it to the Prophecies of Elijah and he saw that Elijah's prophecy was Ahab Must Fall in battle that's why he could stand there in spite of all the opposition that he received he could stand there and say no God showed me this and then Ahab said take him into the inner prison and feed him the bread of Sorrow give him the water of sorrow and Mah said if God if I said ever see you again God never spoke to me he was an eagle can we stand like that can we can we subject our own even our own enthusiasm you get all excited about something can you subject it back to the word of God can you bring it back because remember this word is our absolute our feelings are not what other people say is not it's got to come back to the word of God and I guarantee you whatever you're going through in life you will find it in here amen that you can bring it back to your absolute and say well Lord is it is my I'm so excited Lord this is all I want in life but is it according to the word amen so Micaiah being an eagle could take his vision back to the word and say that's it I can stand on this hallelujah amen let's go to an eagle an eagle can live in any condition and walk with God now this is the you know if you go Google Patmos you know Patmos was uh you where John was in prison and it was it was not like the kind of semi- touristy place that is now there's nice hotels all those things but you see back in those days it was a Roman penal colony where where religious uh you uh whoever political prisoners whatever they got put on this island snake infested all these things so John was living in a prison but yet being an eagle he could walk with God being on this island amen Paul was the same way in prison but being an eagle he could he could you know God God gave him most of the New Testament while he was in prison Shackled to a Roman amen so an eagle can an eagle can live everywhere you know I think basically all our problems are first world problems really they're really not that bad we got to have perspective but you see now I'm just going to come back to this I will get to where I'm going I this time I'll get there but you see now in a chicken coup these chickens are Earthbound their wings being clipped they can't fly now we know that uh you know as I spoke about on New Year's Day in a chicken Co there's a pecking order and the pecking order is very important to the chickens right it's all about what you're entitled to people who fight always always fussing and picking each other and trying to bring other people down is because they feel entitled well this is mine I deserve this right Hallelujah Eagles don't live in a pecking order they respect other eagles they eat chickens is right but you see Eagles don't have this kind of picking order they saw they know you know their territories all those things but chicken but you see in a chicken coop like after that service brother Isaac said you know the chicken coop politics are very real to a chicken so not diminishing all these things but it's just a see the problem is is we live in an age of as as it would be written in the Book of Revelation it's the it's the age of Lady OA people's rights that's what lady oia means rights of the people right so everyone feels entitled this is not fair life's not fair how dare this happen to me I deserve better than this that's a that's a modern a modern way of looking at things CU you go back a hundred years if we all got transporter back there we' say man life is not fair and they look at you say what life is life right 10 years old milking cows cooking this working in the field with Dad hard labor all these things those children didn't say life's not fair they say well life is just life right but now it's a big entitlement what can I get that's a ladyo see in spirit right we shouldn't be fussing and fighting about all these things do you have life in your body do you have clothes on your back do you have a roof over your head do you have food amen have you got a sound mind do you love the Lord you got more than enough you're blessed amen so you got those things I'd just be happy everything else is a bonus but at least appreciate the bonuses don't say well I deserve it amen praise God nice food Hallelujah new clothes that's cool but you know don't let those we're not entitled to anything amen actually I could actually say it born in a fallen condition we're entitled to go to hell but God rich in Mercy amen broke the chains of sin off your life amen redeemed you amen before you even realize he purchased your salvation on Calvary amen so because of his blood because of what he's done I'm entitled to Heaven because of what he has done not what I have earned or deserved at all hallelujah amen praise the Lord so don't get caught up in a in a pecking order this person that person this I want this and this is not fair and this person this and forget that stuff I've been purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ everything else is a bonus praise the Lord amen now an eagle this is a this is if I have it this is a South African eagle we used to have the biggest eagle in New Zealand they used to eat MOA but then they went extinct but they're big things okay but this is a um if I have it here somewhere this is a black breasted snake eagle and it's eating a cape Cobra on the wing eagles kill snakes right Eagles are territorial right so the snake isn't actually looking for the eagle the Eagle's looking for the snake amen so uh Eagle's got its territory and it gets a bit hungry and it sees this thing slithering in its patch what's this filthy snake doing on my patch what does it do it swoops down I was I actually watched a video you know the most they say the most poisonous snake in the world is is a is a sea snake you got the black and white banded one they're sea eagles and they swoop down and I saw more than one video and one Talon will crush the head of the serpent the other one will grab the body and up it flies away and eats on the thing Hallelujah same thing with this this is this is this is flying and eating at the same time right but you see now someone who's got an eagle anointing can see the serpent slithering around in its life and it don't put up with it it doesn't Pander that snake it don't feed that snake it don't feed a complex it don't feed a misunderstanding it don't feed or hurt amen come on Amen it don't feed it doesn't give excuse for why snakes in the life you say I was born this way my parents are this way and I've got bad jeans and stuff forget the jeans I mean you've got a jean the Jean seed of God in your soul that's the genan that counts hallelujah amen see you see now a snake though a snake needs something it needs friction to move so even if that snake was alive it couldn't move its body in the air to actually wrap itself around the eagle and come back to earth it needs something to push against it needs friction amen so a snake without friction cannot move now the natural types types are spiritual right am mean so a snake or a spirit needs a hurt or a trauma to work in it needs something to push against right it needs animosity to move it needs it needs a friction needs a it needs a there's a problem there's a resistance there's a trouble going on it needs those things to move and get a tighter grip he me it needs cality to move right it needs a reason to move it needs reasoning to move you take all those things out that snake can't move doesn't matter how big the thing is it ain't going to move right so if you get so sure we've all been hurt we've all had trauma I'm not diminishing anything we've gone through in life people have been through some terrible hard horrible things but God is the Healer God is the restorer I mean God quickening power can bring a healing into that thing amen doesn't matter how deep it may run how young it may have happened to you God can bring a restoration amen that God can use that as a testimony that his power can be manifested Hallelujah like Moses when they came out of the Red Sea they had a they had a good old Pentecostal meeting on the on the on the seashore dancing with the tambourines all these things and they walked for three days without water they came to a place where there was a bitter water of Mara Mara and then so they the children of Israel begin to complain why have we come to this bitter experience in our walk we've just had a great Victory but then Moses was inspired there was a tree on the side of the you know Pond bank or river bank or whatever it was Lake or I don't know you know he cut that tree down and he put it in the water and the water became sweet and Friends there's a cross there's a there's a tree of Calvary amen that you take any trauma any bitter experience you take it to Calvary you truly do it'll become sweet hallelujah how will become sweet you say Lord you brought me out of that thing thing Lord you didn't keep me in that bitter experience lord lord your power is more greater it's become sweet cuz Lord You're My deliverer You're My Healer you're my restorer Lord hallelujah I'm so thankful there's that tree amen Eagle anointing will identify that tree it's not psychology you make psychology with a bitter experience as it becomes more bitter because the depth and the height and the magnitude of it just gets Amplified but if you but if you get inspired by the word of God by the eagle anointing of the word you'll take Calvary mixer with an experience become sweet hallelujah praise the Lord now that snake gives the Eagle Energy to fly hallelujah it's it's a that snake sustains the eagle isn't that strange how can a trial and a trouble and a devil trying to destroy me sustain me it gives you strength like Caleb would say he'd say it's only Rebel not against the Lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bread for us this is an eagle speaking am mean this is an eagle speaking amen these Giants they're bread amen they're going to give us strength amen they're going to sustain us amen they're going to give us power in the battle Hallelujah just like David another Eagle Saul wasn't an eagle he was one of God's children but he didn't have an eagle anointing he had a manage anointing a reasoning anointing because when Goliath came out he began to size them up and and and you know well he's that tall he's that tall I'm this tall no one else is that tall we can't do this that's reasoning kicking in but when David and eagle flew into the camp amen and then he heard the boast of that Philistine what did he do he says who is this uncircumcised Philistine he didn't say who is this giant who's this uncircumcised Philistine that defies the armies of the Living God Amen and then David began to testify to Saul Saul I've been eating a lion came against my father's sheep I killed it Hallelujah gave him strength amen and then a bear came a more powerful animal came in I killed it amen it gave me strength and this uncircumcised Philistine is will be exactly like them I mean every time God gave a testimony into David's life it gave him strength it became bread for him I mean that's why it's important you feel weak Draw on your testimony remember they remember the Bible says they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony what is the word of Our Testimony the word is right the word works the word is true the word is for me and this is what the word is done in my life Hallelujah that will give you strength for the battle amen you say man I've been through a lot I say man you're strong you've been eating some big big loaves of bread hallelujah praise the Lord so that eagle oh where we the eagle lives off the troubles that slither in its territory praise God you see you got a trial in your life Lord you're feeding me you're given me strength Lord that's why it works for your good count it all joy hallelujah amen praise the Lord now we just kind of let's let's just go to um let's go to Revelations chapter 3 quickly now just to go back quickly said the and I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see so we know that that voice is a prophetic message in the end time this end time message is that voice of the fourth Beast right it's the spirit of God speaking forth a message to restore us back to the original Faith right now and and then you tie this in with the church anger says Now Behold I stand there a knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will s with him and he with me so now there's a there's a call coming to this age If any man hear my voice and open the door not just hear his voice so not just oh that was good preaching that was good church service or that was a good message I heard open your door open your heart to there to that voice he will come in and you'll have communion amen so so so there's a voice in this end time now Jesus would say here going back he says I Know Thy works are neither hot nor cold this is the complaint against this age I would that thou were hot cold or hot so then because thou are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth now it says nowhere in the Bible I'm just paraphrasing quickly from the church ages but the Bible does not say anywhere where in the mouth of God we're engraved in his hands we're in his bosom we're in his mind so what's in his mouth his word so what happens now is is is people have replaced the word of God with Creeds and dogmas and they're speaking Creeds and dogmas they're not speaking the word of God because if you speak the word of God then God will confirm that word right so now Eagles speak the word of God they don't speak tradition they don't speak man's ideas they speak the word of God Amen so now this voice now the voice of God now comes into a people right maybe I'm just you're listening okay so the voice of God comes into a people and it's not a voice that's contrary to the Scripture it is a scriptural voice it ties in like brother Braham was asked he said uh you you someone said to him tempting him saying brother Bram with all your experiences and Revelations you could write a new Bible like the seven Thunders all these things it would you know require a new Bible he says no it's already in the scripture you can't add or take away from it it all has to be in the scripture like the revelation of the seven SS it's all in the scripture it's all there we don't have another book we have a book The Bible amen all the Revelation comes from the BC someone was tempting him saying no because if he did that he'd be speaking for himself and not be speaking for God so now he's saying I'll spew the out of my mouth in other words you'll no longer speak for me right so we don't want to be speaking for a church cuz we know a church cannot save anyone it's the word of God that saves people it's Jesus Christ the man the word that saves not the woman the church right so now this Eagle anointing brings the voice of God into you see the voice of God's got to come off books and tapes even off the pages of this word it's got to live in you right God God when the Rapture comes he's not going to Rapture this Bible this will stay here right the message books and tapes are going to stay here but what is he going to do he's going to take living Epistles he's going take men and women that that word God God has transferred that word into them that now the living Christ lives in a people hallelujah so now that voice now is in flesh amen that is the same voice that is the same voice that's called Lazarus from the grave CU remember Jesus said Jesus said I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world right so the Holy Ghost we understand is God right so the same God that was in Jesus Christ being being the God man now came down and dwells in the church right in the Old Testament is a pillar of fire he came and lived in Jesus Christ who was who was Emanuel God With Us paid for our sins and then what happened on the day of Pentecost that same Pillar of Fire came into the upper room filled the church right it's the same God but now living in people are we are we all together so I can so so the Holy Ghost you receive is exactly the same Holy Ghost as was in Jesus Christ as was in the apostles as it's not a weaker Holy Ghost it's not a different Holy Ghost it's the same one amen so now creative power that spoke and brought a man who is already decomposing rotting in the grave amen brought him back to life in a healthy sound well body that same voice of the Resurrection lives in you amen this is very important because remember this Eagle anointing doesn't just cause us to see but it has a voice amen and that voice is where's that voice it's in you amen if you if God truly dwells in you that same voice is in you am mean that's why it's so important you've got to speak to your Mountain not with your human understanding you got to let God get a hold of your life and God take these lips and God speak his word forth that you realize it's not you speaking it's him speaking through you hallelujah amen so the same voice that said Lazarus come forth now comes and dwells in you that's why it's so important amen when there's someone dead in trespasses and sins maybe maybe their life seems to be rotten four days in the grave past Redemption God don't say that amen no one's gone too far someone should have said Amen to that can't we look beyond the human senses that person's Gone Too Deep too long too far who said who says that the devil says that amen but now what does that eagle anointing say all that the father has given me will come and all that come me on no wise cast out amen that's why it's so important when you pray pray with purpose amen pray with anointing amen pray with a burden amen don't be passive in your prayers amen you remember the voice of God from the throne told told the devil when when the devil was trying to touch job the voice of God said this is your restrictions devil and the devil had to obey the voice of God that same voice is in you that's right amen so God wants to use your voice to set restrictions on the enemy I mean what is the principle work of the Church casting out of Satan amen go into all the world preach the gospel cast out Devils you'll speak in new tongues lay hands on the sick they you all those things right but it's to cast out Devils that the spirit of God can come and dwell in someone that voice is in you friends don't put it off on the prophet or someone else no the voice of the Resurrection is in You by the spirit of God that's in you amen hallelujah see people need more than just reasoning I'm just going to close with this thought people need more than just reasoning and arguments about where we should worship see the see the woman at the well she saw Jesus was a prophet but say you know that you know we worship here the Jews say you should worship here and all these things this church this church whatever more it goes beyond that she needed more than that to hear that eagle cry she needed more than that to come out of that cage of her life and and and and fly in the heavenlies with Jehovah God she need more than reasoning of who's right and wrong but she need a messiah to say I am he amen and this is what people are looking for they want to see Jesus Christ real today more than tradition more than an argument more than those things they want to see Jesus Christ real Hallelujah that's why it's so important we can look back and say God you think about God gave us Eagle Vision when we started this church he said if you remain humble amen my word will continue to go forth and I'll bring people here and they'll find rest they'll find rest for their Souls right when we first died just a handful of us God gave us Eagle Vision that that is going to happen amen so now when we went through troubles and trials and hardship whatever more we could look Beyond those things were the troubles there yes was the hardships there yes were things bad sure but we could look Beyond those things say God you have ordained that people will come to this place and they'll find rest for their souls so Lord if you've ordained that we can look beyond the trouble and say God that's what you've said and has he not prom has he not fulfilled that promise has he finished fulfilling that promise he has not finished fulfilling that promise hallelujah amen amen God's done the impossible I'm just going to leave it there but I want you to think about this God has a voice that voice wants to be in you that's not your human understanding trying to work things out and speak things no you let God do it through you amen when you speak to your child speak to your workmate speak to your colleague speak to your whoever say Lord anoint me bypass this thing and speak something that will touch their hearts amen God will do the supernatural amen
