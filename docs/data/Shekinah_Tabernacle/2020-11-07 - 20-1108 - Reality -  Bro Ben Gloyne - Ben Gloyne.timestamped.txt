[9:27] morning amen
[9:29] the weather is not too good out there
[9:30] amen we know how that can affect us
[9:32] but let's just put that aside our
[9:34] troubles our sorrows our trials whatever
[9:36] it is our jobs our work whatever it is
[9:39] shove it to the side say not today not
[9:41] this morning
[9:42] let's listen to our holy hands and say
[9:43] thank you jesus
[9:45] thank you father for that victory amen
[9:48] join me to psalms 146. amen i love the
[9:52] psalms
[9:54] i mean just quickly
[10:04] there is none like you amen psalms 146
[10:10] [Music]
[10:12] it says praise ye the lord praise the
[10:15] lord all my soul
[10:18] while i live will i praise the lord
[10:21] i will sing praises unto my god while i
[10:24] have
[10:24] any being and it says put not your trust
[10:28] in princes
[10:29] not in the son of man in whom there is
[10:32] no help
[10:34] because his breath goeth forth and he
[10:37] returned it to his earth
[10:39] and that very day his thoughts perish so
[10:42] our thoughts are not our own we can't
[10:43] even put our trust in ourselves or any
[10:45] other man
[10:46] and then verse 4 verse 5 says happy is
[10:49] he
[10:49] that had the god of jacob for his help
[10:52] amen i'm sure we all have a testimony
[10:54] this morning of when
[10:55] god supernaturally helped us in our own
[10:57] way
[10:58] that's what we're here to worship happy
[11:00] is he that had the god of jacob for his
[11:02] help
[11:03] whose hope is in the lord his god which
[11:05] made heaven
[11:07] and the earth the sea and all therein
[11:11] is which keepeth truth forever
[11:14] which executed judgment for the
[11:15] oppressed which gave it food to the
[11:17] hungry
[11:18] which the lord lucifered the prisoners
[11:21] verse 8 says the lord opened the eyes of
[11:23] the blind
[11:25] he raises them that are bowed down the
[11:28] lord
[11:28] loveth the righteous the lord preserveth
[11:32] the strangers he relieveth the
[11:34] fatherless
[11:35] the widow but the way of the wicked he
[11:39] turneth upside down
[11:40] and this last verse says the lord shall
[11:42] reign forever
[11:44] even thy god o zion o shekinah
[11:47] tabernacle
[11:48] unto all generations not just for
[11:50] ourselves our children our children's
[11:52] children
[11:53] amen praise ye the lord amen i believe
[11:56] that's what we should be doing this
[11:58] morning
[11:59] amen because he's great he's everlasting
[12:02] there is none like him when we need help
[12:05] he's the only one that we can turn to
[12:08] amen the help might not come today it
[12:10] may not come tomorrow but that promise
[12:12] is yours
[12:13] amen so with that mindset let's just
[12:15] release everything
[12:16] and enter into his presence and worship
[12:18] him with all our beings
[12:20] hallelujah let's buy his in the word of
[12:22] prayer

[29:43] brighter than the sun that's his promise
[29:47] of who we are his bride and this song
[29:50] came to me a few years ago it was
[29:52] actually brother weber was one of the
[29:54] older brothers that had ministered
[29:56] a message and i just looked at the
[29:57] scriptures and things
[29:59] and that's how the song came about um
[30:03] but i'm so glad that we can understand
[30:04] the word of the hour
[30:06] we don't have to fear we know exactly
[30:08] what's going on
[30:09] by his grace and we can shine the light
[30:12] to others

[30:15] meaning to me
[30:18] we are the children of light

[35:28] mentioned he said birthday amen
[35:31] now before i sing this song i just
[35:33] thought i would say this
[35:35] it's strange that i've sung at funerals
[35:38] i've sung at weddings i've sung in
[35:41] church
[35:42] but i've never sung on my wife's
[35:44] birthday
[35:45] amen so
[35:48] it's a special day for her now before we
[35:51] got married
[35:53] i got asthma it really hit me hard
[35:57] i was suffered from asthma so i had to
[36:00] carry a
[36:01] an inhaler in my pocket all the time
[36:05] even in church i just can't breathe i
[36:08] take it out and
[36:10] i have to take a puff so
[36:14] we got married then uh as the bible says
[36:18] there's this expression in the bible
[36:20] that says as if this was a small thing
[36:23] so as if this was a small thing the
[36:26] devil
[36:27] also gave me tb tuberculosis
[36:30] so i was suffering from asthma i was
[36:33] also suffering from tb
[36:35] and my weight went down to 41 kgs
[36:39] kilograms
[36:43] when i went to see a doctor and he
[36:46] diagnosed it
[36:47] he saw my wife privately said how many
[36:49] children do you have sister
[36:51] she told him says this man is dying
[36:56] better get your house in order because
[36:58] from what i can see
[37:00] he's dying but i'm healed i no longer
[37:04] suffer from asthma
[37:05] i don't suffer from tb anymore amen
[37:11] asthma and tb and me we've got totally
[37:15] no relationship we don't mix
[37:19] each time i see tb chase ihstb so each
[37:22] time they see me
[37:23] whether it was in uk they start running
[37:26] because i don't like asthma
[37:28] i don't like tv i keep them on the run
[37:34] amen
[37:42] i'm just putting this song on
[37:45] uh this happens to be my wife's favorite
[37:47] song

[37:51] the
[37:52] that the song don't you

[53:49] today
[53:51] ii corinthians 4 and 15. can you turn me
[53:54] down please uh uh brothers thank you
[53:57] for all things uh for your sakes that
[53:59] the abundant grace
[54:00] might through the thanksgiving of many
[54:02] rebound to the glory of god
[54:05] for which cause we faint not but though
[54:07] our outward man perish yet the inward
[54:09] man is renewed day by day
[54:12] hallelujah for our light affliction
[54:15] is but for a moment take the worst thing
[54:18] you're going through right now
[54:20] class of this light affliction this is
[54:22] what the apostle paul tells us
[54:24] and it is but for a moment it's temporal
[54:26] it worketh for us a far more exceeding
[54:28] and eternal weight of glory
[54:30] while we look not at the things which
[54:32] are seen but are the things which are
[54:34] not seen
[54:35] for the things which are seen are
[54:37] temporal but the things which are not
[54:39] seen
[54:40] are eternal hallelujah and we're going
[54:43] to read one more scripture i just
[54:45] sorry i'm never really good with
[54:46] slideshows because i jump around too
[54:48] much but
[54:50] it says in second corinthians 5 and 7
[54:52] after the apostle paul has told us that
[54:53] we have a
[54:54] eternal body in the heavens waiting for
[54:56] us already he says for we walk by faith
[54:59] and not by sight
[55:01] i say the eternal things are real what
[55:03] you see with these five senses is not
[55:04] actually reality
[55:06] amen anyway let's bow our heads in a
[55:08] word of prayer this morning
[55:10] lord jesus lord truly we can sing from
[55:13] the depths of our heart

[55:19] want you to reign victorious over our
[55:21] over our lives lord that you'd have
[55:24] preeminence lord jesus lord that your
[55:26] word would have first place in our lives
[55:28] oh god and
[55:29] lord your word would be the principle
[55:30] theme of our walking our talking our
[55:32] actions lord everything we
[55:34] do lord may just be your word made flesh
[55:36] and dear god we thank you we can come on
[55:38] these four walls and worship and praise
[55:40] you o god and
[55:41] father we just want to invite you into
[55:42] the service lord i'm just asking may you
[55:45] touch every life
[55:46] dear god i pray you just remove every
[55:48] hindering spirit in the name of jesus
[55:50] christ
[55:50] father may you break every fetter of the
[55:52] enemy satan you're a defeated being and
[55:54] we've come to remind you once again
[55:56] you're still defeated
[55:57] as you were defeated that down calvary
[55:59] you're still defeated today and you will
[56:01] be defeated tomorrow and the next day
[56:02] and the next day
[56:03] but lord jesus we want to thank you lord
[56:05] you're still victorious
[56:07] lord you'll be victorious today you'll
[56:08] be victorious tomorrow
[56:10] lord as eternity rolls on your victory

[56:14] father we want to lift you up and give
[56:16] you glory thank you for purchasing our
[56:18] salvation thank you for washing all our
[56:20] sins away

[56:22] creatures and you oh god thank you for
[56:24] casting the devil out of our lives lord
[56:26] we're so thankful we can stand on his
[56:28] feet o god this morning
[56:30] i pray you bless the word inspire it
[56:31] lord i pray to hearts
[56:33] dear god not your speaker but hearer
[56:35] also lord may you grant it father in
[56:37] jesus christ's name
[56:38] amen amen amen god bless you friends you
[56:41] may
[56:42] have your seats this morning so i want
[56:43] to speak about reality
[56:45] and as i've said that reality is not
[56:48] what you see
[56:50] this is temporal what you feel is
[56:52] temporal
[56:53] what you imagine is temporal it's all
[56:54] going to pass away one day
[56:57] so we want to look at reality now the
[56:58] definition of of reality sorry
[57:01] ignore that we're going this way
[57:04] reality this is i think it's from the
[57:06] cambridge dictionary i just asked mr
[57:08] google this is what he told me
[57:09] the state of things as they are rather
[57:12] than as they
[57:13] are imagined to be now to the christian
[57:16] reality should be the word of god not
[57:19] what you see with your five senses right
[57:21] that is really reality and this is just
[57:23] an example he escaped from reality by
[57:26] going to the cinemas every afternoon
[57:28] i think that's getting a bit outdated
[57:30] some people will say what's a cinema
[57:31] you know i say he went on netflix every
[57:34] afternoon to escape reality
[57:36] or he went on his phone whatever you
[57:38] know but we shouldn't try and escape
[57:39] reality
[57:40] because our reality is good hallelujah
[57:43] we're going to heaven that's reality
[57:45] amen the devil's going to burn that's
[57:47] reality hallelujah so you know
[57:49] the things the state of things is as
[57:52] they are
[57:53] rather than as they imagined are
[57:55] imagined to be
[57:56] now you may say what i'm going through
[57:57] is very seems very very real
[57:59] it's temporal it'll pass it'll change
[58:02] there'll be another season there'll be
[58:04] another spring there'll be another good
[58:06] time harley just because you're in a bad
[58:08] time doesn't mean you'll stay in a bad
[58:09] time
[58:10] i mean we have to walk according to our
[58:12] reality which is the prophecy of the
[58:14] word for
[58:15] us and the scripture right what the
[58:17] message is prophesied the bride would be
[58:19] that's our reality
[58:21] hallelujah you know brother branham
[58:24] would
[58:24] would go into a hospital and he would
[58:26] pray for a a boy who was on the brink of
[58:29] death
[58:29] see it depends what you're looking to
[58:31] which will define your reality
[58:33] he said so so brother i'm said he raised
[58:35] up then the old father looked across at
[58:37] the mother and said oh mother isn't it
[58:39] wonderful it's done
[58:40] done you know as far as he was concerned
[58:42] he said oh i'm so happy
[58:44] said brother brown praise the lord i'm
[58:46] so glad that you prayed the prayer of
[58:47] faith my boy is healed now the little
[58:50] nurse had looked at him real funny
[58:52] and he said praise the lord and tears
[58:54] just rolled down his cheeks and the old
[58:56] mother
[58:56] they got each other in their arms began
[58:58] to hug each other and said oh lord we
[58:59] thank you for healing our boy this was
[59:01] their reality
[59:03] hallelujah remember they're boys on
[59:04] death's door so five senses are
[59:06] declaring one thing but their reality is
[59:08] declaring another thing
[59:10] hallelujah uh and just barely his heart
[59:13] was moving and so the little
[59:14] nurse said sir how can you act like that
[59:17] and your child dying
[59:19] why he said ma'am he's not dying he's
[59:22] living
[59:23] and he said why he said why lady said oh
[59:26] my i i don't understand
[59:30] she said well look sir she said this
[59:32] cardiogram
[59:33] whatever it what uh what uh
[59:36] ever what it i don't know but said when
[59:39] that drops all
[59:40] the way down it's never been known a
[59:42] medical history for the heart to ever
[59:43] come back again
[59:45] said the boy is dying a few more hours
[59:47] and he'll be dead
[59:48] said he's just practically he's
[59:50] unconscious now since yesterday
[59:52] how can you act and be rejoicing look
[59:55] like you wouldn't
[59:56] wouldn't take it so lightly why do you
[59:59] why do we act and rejoice why
[1:00:01] why are we so happy because we're
[1:00:03] looking at something very different than
[1:00:04] what the world looks at so what the five
[1:00:06] senses declare we're looking at faith
[1:00:08] we look at revelation of the word
[1:00:09] hallelujah amen
[1:00:12] oh my hallelujah see look much you see
[1:00:14] he said look my child the old man put
[1:00:16] his arm around that little
[1:00:17] uh other little nurse he said you're
[1:00:19] looking at that piece of machinery
[1:00:21] see because that's all you know to look
[1:00:23] to but i'm looking to a divine
[1:00:26] promise that's right the boys married
[1:00:28] now got a baby
[1:00:30] so that just shows depends on what you
[1:00:32] are looking at
[1:00:33] so you see you must look at god's
[1:00:35] promises no matter what takes place
[1:00:38] look at god's promise not how you feel
[1:00:41] but what god
[1:00:42] said that's the faith of abraham that's
[1:00:44] abraham's faith
[1:00:45] and we are the children of abraham i
[1:00:47] mean so we do not look at what we see
[1:00:49] what we feel what we hear
[1:00:51] we don't look at those things we are
[1:00:52] looking at a divine promise of god
[1:00:54] and i believe the holy spirit's here to
[1:00:56] train us and to teach us look at my word
[1:00:59] keep looking at me look what i said
[1:01:00] about you every situation
[1:01:02] don't care about politics the world
[1:01:04] economics forget it
[1:01:05] i mean that word we have a sure word of
[1:01:07] prophecy we're going in a rapture
[1:01:09] look to that look to every divine
[1:01:11] promise of god
[1:01:13] this is my reality how's your reality
[1:01:16] going
[1:01:18] because there is actually only one
[1:01:20] reality you know in psychology there's
[1:01:22] things called
[1:01:22] um alternative realities right but
[1:01:25] there's only one real reality
[1:01:26] which one are you living in it depends
[1:01:29] what you focus upon
[1:01:33] he says herein faith without works is
[1:01:36] dead
[1:01:37] lucky here friends let me give this
[1:01:39] illustration
[1:01:40] i might have done it before but what
[1:01:41] color is that shirt it's white
[1:01:43] anyone that's got sight knows that
[1:01:45] shirt's white
[1:01:46] you have five senses uh of the body see
[1:01:50] taste feel smell and hear now none of
[1:01:51] those
[1:01:52] senses will declare god that's quite a
[1:01:54] statement isn't it yeah i was thinking
[1:01:55] about that last night that's quite a
[1:01:56] statement
[1:01:57] we can see we can hear feel touch smell
[1:02:00] but none of those senses declare god
[1:02:02] but yet those five senses will run our
[1:02:04] life our emotions will run our life
[1:02:07] our imagination will run our life how we
[1:02:10] feel run our life i'm feeling up today
[1:02:12] hallelujah
[1:02:12] i'm feeling down oh my help me lord
[1:02:14] jesus but that doesn't change our
[1:02:16] salvation
[1:02:17] why do we you know we our reality
[1:02:21] should be the revelation of the word to
[1:02:23] us
[1:02:24] amen but none of those senses will
[1:02:27] declare god when god made man he made
[1:02:29] him in his image the spirit man
[1:02:31] and he put him in five senses to contact
[1:02:33] his earthly home not to contact god with
[1:02:36] those senses don't declare god they
[1:02:38] declare the earthly home
[1:02:40] where the man had to contact his earthly
[1:02:42] home he had to
[1:02:43] see taste feel smell and hear but faith
[1:02:46] is the substance of things hoped for
[1:02:48] the evidence of things not seen you do
[1:02:50] not see it taste it feel it smell it or
[1:02:53] hear it but you believe it
[1:02:55] we take judas garrett he saw a lot of
[1:02:57] miracles
[1:02:58] he saw the devil cast out he saw bread
[1:03:00] and fish multiplied he saw the storm be
[1:03:02] made he was in that storm and it became
[1:03:04] calm
[1:03:05] he saw a lot of things he heard a lot of
[1:03:07] preaching
[1:03:08] so he heard the word he saw the word he
[1:03:10] experienced the word
[1:03:12] but there was no revelation in his heart
[1:03:14] but the other disciples hallelujah
[1:03:16] they heard the word they saw the word
[1:03:18] but there was faith in them that
[1:03:20] declared
[1:03:21] it wasn't their five senses that
[1:03:23] declared who god was to them
[1:03:25] hallelujah it was their faith hallelujah
[1:03:29] glory i'm not going to slow i'm just
[1:03:30] going to keep bouncing
[1:03:32] i'm you know you know the best way to
[1:03:34] wake people up brother kaidre said i'm
[1:03:36] about to close
[1:03:37] everyone says hallelujah now they find
[1:03:39] suddenly awake
[1:03:42] it's faith that really declares who he
[1:03:45] is and we know faith is a revelation
[1:03:48] hallelujah our emotions
[1:03:52] see too many people rely on their five
[1:03:54] senses to get a sense of reality
[1:03:56] they'll take what they see what they
[1:03:58] hear what they feel what they taste and
[1:04:00] they come to a conclusion this is what's
[1:04:02] really going on
[1:04:03] and those things can appear very real
[1:04:05] i'm not discounting
[1:04:07] you know i'm not i'm not discounting any
[1:04:09] kind of situation
[1:04:10] but we will look at our five senses and
[1:04:12] we will come to a conclusion this is
[1:04:14] really what's going on
[1:04:16] he said oh i feel this way so it must be
[1:04:18] so i heard this thing and it must be so
[1:04:20] it must be really a reality and we know
[1:04:22] the devil takes 99
[1:04:24] truth puts one percent error in and it
[1:04:26] becomes a lie
[1:04:28] you know so people hear a lot of things
[1:04:30] like theo and they say oh this is
[1:04:31] how it must be so but those things are
[1:04:34] just
[1:04:35] shifting sands how i feel today will

[1:05:08] sands your imagination will change your
[1:05:11] reasoning
[1:05:11] all those things will change right but a
[1:05:14] wise man
[1:05:15] the foolish man builds his house upon
[1:05:17] the sand
[1:05:18] foolish people build their house upon
[1:05:20] their emotions what they imagine what
[1:05:22] they see what they reason that's
[1:05:23] foolishness
[1:05:24] because it will change but the wise man
[1:05:27] builds his house he digs through that
[1:05:29] sand through the feeling through what
[1:05:31] they imagine
[1:05:32] and they get down to the rock christ
[1:05:33] jesus the word and then they continue to
[1:05:35] spread out the foundation and they build
[1:05:37] their lives upon the revelation of the
[1:05:39] word
[1:05:40] hallelujah i want to be a wise man i
[1:05:43] don't want to be a foolish man
[1:05:44] i want to be a wise man hallelujah
[1:05:47] irrespective of how i feel what's going
[1:05:50] on forget it the word says it i believe
[1:05:52] it let's walk in it
[1:05:54] hallelujah glory
[1:05:57] amen amen
[1:06:01] you can have optical illusions and
[1:06:03] things that looks like it is when it's
[1:06:04] nazi
[1:06:05] but when the picture it could be
[1:06:07] psychology you say
[1:06:09] you see that there and you just keep
[1:06:10] saying yes i believe it and believe it
[1:06:12] so much till you actually think you see
[1:06:14] it
[1:06:15] but you don't see it that's right that's
[1:06:17] psychology but you
[1:06:18] if you just get so mentally pressed
[1:06:20] towards it
[1:06:21] until you just imagine it so imagine it
[1:06:24] till it
[1:06:25] so much till it becomes a reality see
[1:06:28] the devil will try and look make you
[1:06:29] look at a certain thing
[1:06:30] until becomes real to you
[1:06:33] you just imagine somebody hates you once
[1:06:36] and they don't hate you
[1:06:37] but you imagine they do and you just
[1:06:39] keep thinking they don't like me
[1:06:41] and the first thing you'll be shunning
[1:06:43] that person when they don't have done
[1:06:45] nothing wrong to you
[1:06:47] and after a while it becomes so a
[1:06:49] reality to you to
[1:06:50] actually believe that that person
[1:06:52] doesn't like you
[1:06:53] and you'll might ball them out or say
[1:06:55] something to you
[1:06:56] or say something to you for instance
[1:06:58] your wife or your husband or some
[1:06:59] neighbor or something like that
[1:07:01] when that person is absolutely innocent
[1:07:03] of any ill thing
[1:07:04] it's because you just imagine it so till
[1:07:07] it becomes a reality to you now do you
[1:07:09] see what i mean
[1:07:14] hallelujah we've all been there
[1:07:17] you can actually believe something to it

[1:09:43] would become the tiny
[1:09:45] you can't you can't trust by what you
[1:09:47] can't trust by what these five senses
[1:09:49] declare
[1:09:52] here's another picture here's a fully
[1:09:54] grown man
[1:09:56] and these are children this is probably
[1:09:58] the biggest
[1:09:59] whatever eight-year-old in existence

[1:10:04] but in reality he is taller than men
[1:10:08] you know they have things today called
[1:10:10] deep fakes who's heard of deep fakes
[1:10:13] they have videos where they take
[1:10:14] people's faces put it on other people's
[1:10:16] bodies

[1:10:19] like that real person and say this is
[1:10:20] real
[1:10:22] oh but it's on youtube it must be real
[1:10:24] but you can't trust nothing
[1:10:26] you can't trust nothing you can't trust
[1:10:29] what you see you can't even trust what
[1:10:30] you hear
[1:10:34] hallelujah faith is the only thing we
[1:10:37] can revelation in the word is the only
[1:10:39] thing you can trust
[1:10:40] but that looks so real that looked real
[1:10:43] the guy's walking
[1:10:46] it's called a ames room emma's room
[1:10:50] it's not actually built square but your
[1:10:52] eyes tell you it's all plumb and square
[1:10:55] i'm not trusting what i see no more
[1:10:57] that's right
[1:11:00] hallelujah but you see the problem is if
[1:11:04] you focus on the wrong thing you'll
[1:11:05] believe the wrong thing
[1:11:07] brother brown would tell us of this this
[1:11:10] this young lady
[1:11:11] she's a young lady last night in an
[1:11:12] interview she said but she said
[1:11:14] a minister's daughter had some kind of a
[1:11:16] little love affair
[1:11:18] and she got and she had lost her mind
[1:11:20] about it she had gone
[1:11:21] a breakdown a very beautiful young woman
[1:11:24] about 23 years old
[1:11:26] and when she was a little girl of about
[1:11:28] 12 she was in chicago and sitting in the
[1:11:30] meeting or
[1:11:31] elgin it was and sitting in the meeting
[1:11:33] the holy spirit went
[1:11:34] out through the audience and called her
[1:11:36] who she was and said you've got a
[1:11:38] murmuring heart
[1:11:39] the doctor says you can't live to 15
[1:11:41] years old but thus saith the lord you're
[1:11:42] healed and she never felt a heart
[1:11:44] trouble
[1:11:45] since and last night she had a different
[1:11:48] type of a heart trouble
[1:11:50] it was a spiritual heart trouble her
[1:11:52] lover had run off and married some
[1:11:54] other woman and yet she was still in
[1:11:55] love and this boy
[1:11:57] telling that he was in love yet with her
[1:12:00] and his father had caused it
[1:12:02] i said oh nonsense he didn't have to
[1:12:04] marry the other girl he did it because
[1:12:06] he failed
[1:12:06] to have the right kind of love for you
[1:12:08] that's exactly but see
[1:12:10] being all wound up into that the girl
[1:12:12] just sit there in such a stoop
[1:12:15] and like she said oh i know johnny loves
[1:12:17] me i know see
[1:12:18] that's all she could see she lived in
[1:12:20] that little world by herself
[1:12:22] she had formed herself in there so she
[1:12:26] had made her own reality
[1:12:28] the reality of actually the situation
[1:12:31] was this boy johnny didn't love her
[1:12:33] married another woman
[1:12:34] right but she had formed this reality
[1:12:36] because of pain and hurt oh i know he
[1:12:38] loves me
[1:12:39] and she had formed herself in this
[1:12:40] little tiny world and this was her
[1:12:43] reality
[1:12:44] but it wasn't reality are you following
[1:12:46] me
[1:12:47] we can form ourselves in our own little
[1:12:50] world
[1:12:52] let's not form ourselves our own little
[1:12:54] world let's be what the word says we
[1:12:56] should be
[1:12:57] by his spirit we will be that way
[1:12:59] hallelujah
[1:13:00] and i took hold of her hand i said
[1:13:02] listen to me and the lord showed me a
[1:13:04] vision you see
[1:13:05] that she knowed i know nothing about
[1:13:07] that something had taken place some
[1:13:09] transaction between them
[1:13:10] and when that was said then that snapped
[1:13:12] her right quick
[1:13:13] so she was stuck in this little world
[1:13:15] and the lord revealed something that
[1:13:16] snapped her out of it
[1:13:17] sometimes we need a shock holy spirit
[1:13:20] needs to give us a shot
[1:13:21] to get us out of our pity party feeling
[1:13:23] sorry for ourselves whatever it is i'll
[1:13:25] never overcome i'll never be a believer
[1:13:27] get a shock out of that holy we're more
[1:13:30] than able
[1:13:31] the holy ghost has made us more than
[1:13:32] able
[1:13:34] amen now now while you're out of there
[1:13:36] look to calvary there you're looking out
[1:13:38] here and you started
[1:13:40] trying to drink and a minister's
[1:13:41] daughter a pentecostal minister's
[1:13:43] daughter and doing the things that
[1:13:44] you're doing
[1:13:45] trying to drown that sorrow that man and
[1:13:48] that somebody that don't care the snap
[1:13:49] of their finger for you
[1:13:50] i said look to calvary girl that's the
[1:13:53] only way back
[1:13:54] that's reality look that's the only way
[1:13:57] back from wherever we have may have
[1:13:58] formed ourselves unto the only way back
[1:14:00] is to look to calvary
[1:14:02] hallelujah
[1:14:07] now hebrews 11 would tell us by faith
[1:14:11] abraham
[1:14:12] when he was called to go into a place
[1:14:14] which
[1:14:15] he should after receive for an
[1:14:17] inheritance obeyed
[1:14:19] and he went out not knowing whether he
[1:14:20] went by faith he so joined in the land
[1:14:23] of promise as an estranged country
[1:14:25] dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and
[1:14:27] jacob the ears with him
[1:14:28] of the same promise for he looked for a
[1:14:31] city which had foundations whose builder
[1:14:34] and maker is god now if we could go and
[1:14:38] just
[1:14:39] see abraham imagine if we could
[1:14:42] transport ourselves back into
[1:14:44] into abraham we could go back over many
[1:14:46] thousand years and we could go
[1:14:48] to where he was and we could see you
[1:14:50] know we could interview him
[1:14:52] abraham looked like any other man sure
[1:14:54] he was a wealthy man
[1:14:56] but he had the same kind of tent as
[1:14:57] everyone else he had the same kind of
[1:14:58] cattle the same kind of robes on
[1:15:00] same kind of bed maybe you know ate the
[1:15:02] same kind of food
[1:15:03] and we would maybe ask him you know we
[1:15:06] would we
[1:15:06] would maybe go talk to him and you know
[1:15:08] no doubt he would begin to tell
[1:15:10] us you know his life story
[1:15:14] and he's a man who's actually living by
[1:15:16] in a reality
[1:15:17] this man has reality because he met god
[1:15:21] hallelujah and you know no doubt you
[1:15:23] know he would he would begin to tell us
[1:15:25] about you know
[1:15:26] where he lives where he's from and then
[1:15:28] his story would go a little bit deeper
[1:15:30] and he'd say you know
[1:15:31] once upon a time we lived in the uh land
[1:15:33] of er you know my dad
[1:15:34] was you know an idol worshiper came out
[1:15:36] of babylon you know all those things
[1:15:38] tara babble and you know but one day a
[1:15:41] voice spoke to me
[1:15:43] i thought this is where i was from i
[1:15:44] thought this was where i was going to
[1:15:46] die this is where my children maybe if
[1:15:47] we'd ever have them would be and
[1:15:49] you know but but but a voice spoke to me
[1:15:51] a presence came around me
[1:15:53] hallelujah and it said leave this place
[1:15:55] i'll give you another land
[1:15:57] and then i begin to walk and and as i
[1:15:59] walk the same god will come and speak to
[1:16:02] me
[1:16:02] hallelujah my five senses declared a lot
[1:16:04] of things it declared my body was dead
[1:16:06] sarah's body
[1:16:07] couldn't have the child that was
[1:16:08] impossible were well past age
[1:16:10] but a faith came into my heart
[1:16:13] hallelujah faith came into my heart and
[1:16:15] declared to me
[1:16:16] you're going to have isaac oh you're
[1:16:18] going to have the promised son
[1:16:20] and you know there came a day where
[1:16:22] where that same one came to me and said
[1:16:24] your name is no longer abraham
[1:16:26] but it's called abraham you know if we
[1:16:29] could go back there imagine the first
[1:16:30] day
[1:16:31] abraham's just had the meeting with with
[1:16:33] god and said your name is now meaning
[1:16:35] the father of nations
[1:16:38] and then abraham goes down to the
[1:16:39] supermarket
[1:16:41] and his neighbors begin to greet him hey
[1:16:42] doing abram
[1:16:44] and he'd say he'd say no no my name is
[1:16:46] not abram anymore my name is abraham
[1:16:49] abraham what does that mean father of
[1:16:51] nations
[1:16:53] and they would begin to think in their
[1:16:54] mind he has lost his mind
[1:16:57] he's well past having children it's
[1:16:59] impossible
[1:17:01] hallelujah are you following me and he's
[1:17:03] telling us no
[1:17:04] i am the father of nations now the five
[1:17:07] senses would declare this man has lost
[1:17:09] his mind
[1:17:09] but he had not lost his mind he was
[1:17:11] living in reality
[1:17:13] because he was now walking according to
[1:17:15] the promise of the word for him
[1:17:18] hallelujah amen we would think oh boy he
[1:17:21] needs to get a grip with his reality and
[1:17:23] he had
[1:17:24] yeah that's right god had spoken to him
[1:17:26] he had followed that voice now the voice
[1:17:28] said your name is no longer abraham
[1:17:30] oh hallelujah aren't we the same kind of
[1:17:32] way

[1:17:44] you're gonna bring forth a promise son
[1:17:50] amen so god told him that he was having
[1:17:52] isaac
[1:17:53] he actually was now walking in reality
[1:17:58] right yes and he would begin to tell you
[1:18:01] now no no
[1:18:03] imagine this here he is before isaac
[1:18:05] came we had this interview this is what
[1:18:06] he just told us
[1:18:08] and then he would say you know all this
[1:18:10] land is actually mine but i'm just a
[1:18:12] pilgrim and a stranger
[1:18:13] what do you mean you have this land no

[1:18:39] builder maker of the city is god and i'm
[1:18:41] walking to this city

[1:18:45] mind
[1:18:46] he did but he found the mind of christ
[1:18:49] hallelujah
[1:18:51] amen so now his reality was based upon
[1:18:54] the revelation of the word to him
[1:18:57] you're following me oh boy we are the
[1:18:59] children of abraham by faith
[1:19:02] hallelujah so we should live and walk
[1:19:05] exactly the same way
[1:19:06] remember his five senses he felt old
[1:19:09] right he felt old if he ever had a
[1:19:12] mirror he'd see he's old he'd see sarah
[1:19:14] she looks old
[1:19:15] right hallelujah his five seasons
[1:19:18] declared to him he was old
[1:19:21] but he didn't walk according to those
[1:19:22] five senses
[1:19:24] that was not his reality but he really
[1:19:26] did feel old
[1:19:28] he really did see sarah was old and real
[1:19:30] you know you know what i mean
[1:19:32] she was actually old he was actually old
[1:19:34] but that was not
[1:19:36] what he walked according to
[1:19:42] and we are the children of abraham by
[1:19:48] faith
[1:19:52] okay can we can we can i drive
[1:20:00] hallelujah abraham was just an ordinary
[1:20:03] man maybe i'll just read the quotes
[1:20:04] instead of
[1:20:10] now abraham we find out oh here we are
[1:20:15] no this way
[1:20:21] now abraham we find out that didn't
[1:20:24] appear to be find them here about the
[1:20:26] 12th chapter the 11th chapter of genesis
[1:20:28] we find out his father came from babylon
[1:20:30] and abraham was just an ordinary man
[1:20:31] just as you know just as your eye or
[1:20:34] anyone else
[1:20:35] he was getting rather what we would
[1:20:37] think
[1:20:38] aged man he was 75 years old he had
[1:20:40] married his half-sister
[1:20:42] her name was sarah and his name then of
[1:20:44] course wasn't abraham was abram
[1:20:46] and hers was sarai and we find out that
[1:20:49] she was 10 years younger than he
[1:20:51] that made her 65 and he's 75 years old
[1:20:54] they probably he was a farmer lived in
[1:20:56] the valley of china there
[1:20:57] lived an ordinary life he probably went
[1:20:59] out in the daytime got his meat from the
[1:21:01] bush picked berries
[1:21:02] lived that sort of life just an ordinary
[1:21:04] man there was nothing special about him
[1:21:06] but one day god called him
[1:21:08] that's what made the difference when god
[1:21:10] made the call that's
[1:21:11] that's the way it is to any life it
[1:21:14] takes god
[1:21:15] it isn't what you do it's what god does
[1:21:17] see you say i sought god
[1:21:19] i sought god you're mistaken no man
[1:21:21] seeks god god seeks men
[1:21:23] hallelujah see it's not you seeking god
[1:21:25] it's god seeking you
[1:21:27] hardly it's when god makes the call it
[1:21:28] makes you makes a difference
[1:21:30] because he wants to take you out of
[1:21:32] these five senses amen and make you walk
[1:21:34] by faith alone
[1:21:36] hallelujah what was what was brother
[1:21:38] brown's theme song only believe all
[1:21:40] things are possible
[1:21:42] to only believe means you only take
[1:21:44] faith into consideration
[1:21:45] you don't bring faith in how you feel
[1:21:47] that's not only belief
[1:21:49] or faith in what you heard about someone
[1:21:51] that's not only belief
[1:21:52] hallelujah only believers only believe
[1:21:56] aliyah only take god at his word bring
[1:21:58] nothing into consideration but what he
[1:22:00] has said
[1:22:02] hallelujah that's all we need to do
[1:22:08] for the promise that he should be the
[1:22:10] heir of the world was not to abraham or
[1:22:12] to his seed
[1:22:13] through the law but through the
[1:22:14] righteousness of faith for if they which
[1:22:16] are of the law be heirs
[1:22:18] faith is made void and the promise made
[1:22:20] of none effect because the law worketh
[1:22:22] wrath
[1:22:23] for where no law is there is no
[1:22:25] transgression
[1:22:26] therefore it is of faith that it might
[1:22:28] be by grace
[1:22:29] to the end of the promise might be sure
[1:22:31] to all the seed
[1:22:32] not to only which is of the law but to
[1:22:35] that also which is of the faith of
[1:22:37] abraham who is the father
[1:22:38] of us all as it is written i have made
[1:22:41] thee a father of many nations
[1:22:43] before he whom he believed even god who
[1:22:46] quickeneth the dead
[1:22:48] and calleth those things which are not
[1:22:50] as though
[1:22:51] they were oh i don't see it on its way
[1:22:55] it's on its way
[1:22:56] i don't see the promise coming it's
[1:22:57] coming oh it's on its way hallelujah
[1:23:00] hey the prodigal son the father of the
[1:23:03] prodigal son here david revelation
[1:23:05] my son's coming home do you see him
[1:23:06] coming have you heard from him no
[1:23:08] but he's coming how do you know
[1:23:10] rapture's coming it's coming
[1:23:12] it's been revealed hallelujah hallelujah
[1:23:16] amen who against hope believed in hope
[1:23:19] that he might become the father of many
[1:23:21] nations
[1:23:22] according to that which was spoken so
[1:23:25] shall thy seed be
[1:23:27] so he believed he against hope believed
[1:23:29] in hope
[1:23:31] that he might become the father of many
[1:23:32] nations according to that which was
[1:23:34] spoken
[1:23:35] he just took what god said
[1:23:38] he's like this is very elementary no no
[1:23:39] he just took what god said yes
[1:23:41] hallelujah he didn't take his reasoning
[1:23:44] he didn't take anything else he said god
[1:23:46] told me
[1:23:46] that's it hallelujah and being not weak
[1:23:49] in faith
[1:23:50] he considered not his own body now dead
[1:23:53] which was when about a hundred years old
[1:23:54] neither
[1:23:55] yet the deadness of sarah's womb he
[1:23:57] staggered not at the promise of god
[1:23:59] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:24:02] giving glory to god now i just want to
[1:24:04] point out one thing
[1:24:06] if you read the biography of of of
[1:24:08] abraham's life
[1:24:10] there would appear to be a lot of
[1:24:11] staggering he would backslide and go
[1:24:14] into egypt
[1:24:15] he would backslide and go on to korea
[1:24:17] right and his children did the
[1:24:19] isaac did the same thing backslidden
[1:24:21] went out the land
[1:24:22] brother brown would say that that
[1:24:24] affected lot so much that that's why a
[1:24:26] lot ended up in sodom
[1:24:28] amen right and you know he would he
[1:24:30] would he would actually god would come
[1:24:32] down and tell him you're going to be the
[1:24:33] father of nations you're going to have
[1:24:35] the promised son
[1:24:36] and he would roll in the dust and at the
[1:24:38] feet of god and laugh
[1:24:40] at god remember it wasn't just sarah
[1:24:42] that laughed abraham laughed too
[1:24:45] no but but then you take those mistakes
[1:24:47] but the thing is
[1:24:48] because he believed the promise those
[1:24:51] things weren't attributed to him
[1:24:53] because the promise was revealed to him
[1:24:56] his faith
[1:24:56] overrode his his staggering and
[1:25:00] also because he was under the blood of
[1:25:01] bulls and goats now
[1:25:03] hallelujah was just covered sin but then
[1:25:05] when the blood of jesus christ came
[1:25:07] and now the same god that inspired moses
[1:25:10] to write the commentary of abraham's
[1:25:12] life
[1:25:13] was the same god that inspired paul
[1:25:16] to write this about about abraham but
[1:25:19] now you say well shouldn't they be
[1:25:20] saying the same thing
[1:25:21] no because paul
[1:25:24] was inspired he was looking through the
[1:25:26] blood because that blood was attributed
[1:25:29] to abraham
[1:25:30] hallelujah so now when god was looking
[1:25:32] at abraham now
[1:25:33] all of his staggering was actually taken
[1:25:35] out of the way and his faith came to the
[1:25:37] forefront
[1:25:38] and god could actually write about him
[1:25:39] he staggered not at the promise of god
[1:25:41] through unbelief
[1:25:43] yes sir here we are we have our
[1:25:45] staggering
[1:25:47] sometimes we think house is ever going
[1:25:48] to come to pass does that just mean
[1:25:51] how's this ever gonna you know but god's
[1:25:54] determined
[1:25:56] he will get us into a condition to
[1:25:57] believe sarah had to get into a
[1:25:59] condition that she would believe the
[1:26:01] promise
[1:26:02] judge and faithful who had promised
[1:26:04] hallelujah
[1:26:07] amen abraham's reality was not based on
[1:26:10] his five senses
[1:26:13] but they were based on what god told him
[1:26:16] and being fully persuaded that what he
[1:26:18] had promised he was also able to perform
[1:26:21] and therefore it was imputed to him for
[1:26:22] righteousness now it was not written for
[1:26:24] his sake alone
[1:26:25] that it was imputed to him but but for
[1:26:28] us
[1:26:28] also to whom it shall be imputed if we
[1:26:31] believe on him who that raised up jesus
[1:26:33] our lord from the dead
[1:26:34] who was delivered for our offenses and
[1:26:36] was raised again for our justification
[1:26:40] i just want to hammer this reality he
[1:26:42] said why is he going into other things
[1:26:43] you can take this through the whole
[1:26:44] scripture
[1:26:47] then what about us
[1:26:50] moses had to walk in reality
[1:26:54] his reality wasn't pharaoh's palace by
[1:26:57] faith moses when he had come of years
[1:26:59] refused to be called the son of
[1:27:01] pharaoh's daughter
[1:27:02] choosing rather to suffer affliction
[1:27:03] with the people of god
[1:27:05] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[1:27:07] season
[1:27:08] esteeming the reproach of christ greater
[1:27:10] riches than the treasures in egypt
[1:27:12] for he had respect and to recompense of
[1:27:14] the reward
[1:27:15] by faith he forsook egypt not fearing
[1:27:17] the wrath of the king for he endured
[1:27:19] as seeing him who was invisible
[1:27:23] how did he endure he was looking to the
[1:27:24] unseen right he was looking to an
[1:27:27] eternal god
[1:27:28] that gave the promise hallelujah and we
[1:27:30] must be the same kind of people
[1:27:32] amen because he was pointing to you and
[1:27:34] i hallelujah
[1:27:37] now in the exodus not everyone
[1:27:40] saw him who was invisible there's a lot
[1:27:43] of people who
[1:27:45] know what let's just go here first moses
[1:27:47] before
[1:27:48] god called him he would try and
[1:27:51] deliver the people and he killed one
[1:27:53] egyptian that was the success of his
[1:27:55] meeting and he ran
[1:27:56] in terror that was the success of his
[1:27:58] own human ability
[1:28:00] trying to fulfill the word of god in his
[1:28:02] own life
[1:28:03] and he and he fled to the land of midian
[1:28:07] and it says here in in verse 21 and
[1:28:09] moses was content to dwell with the man
[1:28:12] and he gave moses zipporah his daughter
[1:28:14] so here moses was he was ordained to be
[1:28:17] a deliverer he was ordained to take a
[1:28:18] people out of egypt
[1:28:20] but because of his own human failure he
[1:28:22] fled
[1:28:23] and he was content to dwell as a
[1:28:27] shepherd i think brother freddie brought
[1:28:28] this up at camp
[1:28:29] you know he was content to dwell as a
[1:28:32] shepherd in a strange land then actually
[1:28:35] fulfill
[1:28:35] what god had him to fulfill now this
[1:28:38] word content
[1:28:40] it's from you know so from the hebrew
[1:28:42] dictionary
[1:28:44] it's it means through the idea
[1:28:48] of mental weakness properly to yield
[1:28:53] that is to to to take upon to be content
[1:28:56] but through the idea of a mental
[1:28:58] weakness he was willing to live as a
[1:28:59] shepherd admitting
[1:29:02] that was not meant to be his reality his
[1:29:06] reality was to take the people out of
[1:29:08] egypt
[1:29:08] and put them in the promised land that
[1:29:10] was his ordained position in the
[1:29:12] scripture
[1:29:13] remember just because he went and made
[1:29:14] this little world to himself on the
[1:29:16] backside of the desert
[1:29:17] amen doesn't mean god would change his
[1:29:19] mind about moses
[1:29:21] hallelujah but because of situations and
[1:29:23] pressure he ran
[1:29:24] right and he was content that's right
[1:29:27] through basically because of a mental
[1:29:29] weakness
[1:29:30] to yield to just live on the back side
[1:29:32] of the desert
[1:29:33] how many times do i need to say i'm
[1:29:36] about to close
[1:29:38] how many times do we live a substandard
[1:29:42] christian walk because of our own
[1:29:44] disappointments
[1:29:47] if we're living below our privilege
[1:29:49] that's not our reality
[1:29:51] but we can adopt it's amazing how
[1:29:53] adaptable humans are
[1:29:55] we can people can live in any kind of
[1:29:57] condition you go to the eskimos up the
[1:29:59] far north
[1:30:00] go to the tropics you go the far south
[1:30:02] you know wherever
[1:30:03] people can adapt to all different kinds
[1:30:05] of siberia you know whoever's seen them
[1:30:08] you know they had to put fires under the
[1:30:09] engines of their trucks to actually thaw
[1:30:11] them out to turn them on when it gets
[1:30:12] real cold
[1:30:13] they adapt why would you live there
[1:30:15] while they adapted to live there
[1:30:17] we can adapt to live very below our
[1:30:19] privilege
[1:30:20] but why should we adapt to that that's
[1:30:22] not our god-given reality
[1:30:24] our god-given reality is to be an
[1:30:26] overcomer in this age
[1:30:27] and now we know many times we're going
[1:30:29] to be willing to overcome this guy
[1:30:31] it's this guy this actually gets in our
[1:30:33] way this guy trips us up
[1:30:34] we give the devil too much credit are
[1:30:38] you gonna be willing to actually whip
[1:30:39] this guy
[1:30:40] oh it's going beyond my comfort zone
[1:30:41] you've got to go beyond your comfort
[1:30:43] zone
[1:30:43] i feel uncomfortable in this situation
[1:30:45] sometimes you just got to press through
[1:30:47] to grow you've got to go beyond your
[1:30:48] comfort zone
[1:30:52] i don't feel like doing it well you're
[1:30:54] going to l
[1:30:56] is it oh that's shifting sands
[1:31:00] moses had to go out of his comfort zone
[1:31:02] god called him that's right
[1:31:04] hallelujah abide in your calling now as
[1:31:06] i was saying before we went that way
[1:31:09] not everyone that came out of uh egypt
[1:31:11] was
[1:31:12] looking to the unseen for some
[1:31:16] when they had heard did provoke howbeit
[1:31:18] not all that came out of egypt by moses
[1:31:21] but with whom was he grieved 40 years
[1:31:23] was it not with them that had sinned
[1:31:25] now we know sin is unbelief whose
[1:31:27] carcasses fell in the wilderness
[1:31:29] and to whom swear he that they should
[1:31:31] not enter into his rest
[1:31:32] but to them that believe not so we see
[1:31:35] that they could not enter in because of
[1:31:37] unbelief you know god
[1:31:38] actually did not or did not want them to
[1:31:41] die in the wilderness
[1:31:43] right it was actually their choice to
[1:31:44] die in the wilderness
[1:31:46] amen you know
[1:31:50] god gives us a choice god gives us a
[1:31:53] choice he's a gentleman
[1:31:54] what choice you gonna take brother brown
[1:31:56] made a choice to take the heart away the
[1:31:58] narrow way
[1:31:59] he says that was your choosing he had to
[1:32:02] make a choice
[1:32:03] what about you and i
[1:32:06] hebrews 4 and 1. let us therefore so i'm
[1:32:09] just continuing on from the
[1:32:10] what you know what we just read let us
[1:32:11] therefore fear least a promise being
[1:32:13] left of us to entering into his rest
[1:32:16] any of you should come seem to come
[1:32:18] short of it
[1:32:19] for unto us was for unto us was the
[1:32:22] gospel preached as well as unto them
[1:32:24] but the word priest should not profit
[1:32:26] them not being mixed with
[1:32:27] faith in them that heard it now the rest
[1:32:31] we know is the holy ghost that's the
[1:32:32] rest where to enter in who's entered
[1:32:34] into rest
[1:32:35] hallelujah right so but but these ones
[1:32:37] that came out with
[1:32:39] with moses were walking by their five
[1:32:41] senses
[1:32:42] they weren't walking by revelation now
[1:32:44] we know there's the caleb and joshua
[1:32:45] outfit and i found that quote and i like
[1:32:47] it so i'm going to put it up
[1:32:48] hallelujah maybe brother that's why i'll
[1:32:49] talk about the caleb and joshua outfit
[1:32:52] and so so these ones were rejoicing when
[1:32:55] god opened the red sea and did lots of
[1:32:56] things but then when hardship came
[1:33:00] they were actually now because remember
[1:33:02] the word that called them out was the
[1:33:04] word that tried them
[1:33:06] right the same thing that called them
[1:33:08] out was actually to try them to see if
[1:33:09] their faith was genuine
[1:33:11] the scripture says in a different
[1:33:13] translation is that the genuineness of
[1:33:15] our faith would be tried
[1:33:16] and the same message that called us out
[1:33:19] is actually trying us as we walk with
[1:33:21] god
[1:33:22] to prove actually is your faith genuine
[1:33:24] is it a revelation
[1:33:26] that god has called you or is it now
[1:33:28] you're just in this thing because while
[1:33:30] everyone else is doing it
[1:33:31] and the people are nice and the food is
[1:33:33] good and you know all those kind of
[1:33:34] things
[1:33:36] that's not genuine faith genuine faith
[1:33:38] is when faith is tried it comes forth
[1:33:40] god is manifested when the trial happens
[1:33:43] come forth as gold
[1:33:44] right come forth as deity not not as
[1:33:47] this way and the whole congregation of
[1:33:49] the children of israel murmured
[1:33:50] against moses and aaron in the
[1:33:52] wilderness and the children of israel
[1:33:54] said unto them would to god
[1:33:56] we had died by the hand of the lord in
[1:33:58] the land of egypt
[1:34:00] now let's just think about this they
[1:34:02] were slaves
[1:34:06] their sons were taken from them
[1:34:09] and thrown into the nile they cried out
[1:34:12] for deliverance
[1:34:16] we've all read this in the scripture
[1:34:17] right this is where they came from they
[1:34:19] were beaten by task masters they were
[1:34:21] just used that they weren't even counted
[1:34:23] as people
[1:34:23] pharaoh would have esteemed his horses
[1:34:25] greater than the children of israel
[1:34:28] right they were nothing to him they were
[1:34:30] used and abused and killed
[1:34:32] and whatever more didn't matter what him
[1:34:33] to them pharaoh didn't care
[1:34:36] and now they have god has seen a prophet
[1:34:38] down when they could not deliver
[1:34:39] themselves god delivered them
[1:34:42] when we could not deliver ourselves god
[1:34:44] delivered us
[1:34:45] they called upon the lord the lord would
[1:34:47] say to moses in exodus 3 i've heard the
[1:34:49] cries of my people
[1:34:51] so i have come down to deliver them
[1:34:53] hallelujah said god delivered them with
[1:34:54] a mighty hand took them through a red
[1:34:56] sea did incredible things
[1:34:58] that had never been done since the war
[1:35:01] began
[1:35:02] but then they came to a place where they
[1:35:05] actually were hungering
[1:35:07] that they actually desired i wish i was
[1:35:09] still a slave in egypt
[1:35:12] that's insanity they were living in a
[1:35:14] wrong kind of reality
[1:35:17] when we sat by the flesh pots and when
[1:35:19] we did eat bread to the full
[1:35:22] they were being led by their bellies and
[1:35:25] they were not
[1:35:26] satisfied with what do you know how
[1:35:28] incredible it would be i was thinking
[1:35:29] about this last night
[1:35:31] you were you're in the caleb and joshua
[1:35:33] outfit
[1:35:35] you've been eating manna for 40 years
[1:35:37] you're about to go into the land which
[1:35:39] is incredible in itself
[1:35:40] but you're about to go into a land where
[1:35:43] people will never taste manna
[1:35:45] like you did you know except for the
[1:35:46] high priest once a year in the holy of
[1:35:48] holies right
[1:35:49] but you know you'd have a testimony i
[1:35:51] lived on angel's food
[1:35:53] because don't we wonder i wonder what it
[1:35:54] tastes like you know i wonder what how
[1:35:57] heavy it was and you know how it died
[1:35:58] you know we wonder those things don't we
[1:36:00] and they would have a testimony we lived
[1:36:01] on angel's food
[1:36:03] god fed us god looked after us you know
[1:36:05] that'd be incredible thing
[1:36:07] but these people were getting they just
[1:36:09] sick of it
[1:36:11] they're just being unhappy about it and
[1:36:13] when we did eat bread to the fall
[1:36:15] for ye have brought us into forth into
[1:36:18] this wilderness
[1:36:19] to kill this whole assembly with hunger
[1:36:22] now that's what they had in their mind
[1:36:24] they had got it twisted in their mind
[1:36:26] actually we're just on a death march
[1:36:28] they're on a life march they're on a
[1:36:30] master promised land
[1:36:32] they're on to a march to a land where a
[1:36:33] resurrection was going to take place
[1:36:35] that was where they are marching to
[1:36:37] that's why joseph said when when you are
[1:36:39] god will take you out
[1:36:40] when you do take my bones don't bury me
[1:36:43] in egypt
[1:36:44] oh sure there were great tombs in egypt
[1:36:45] there were great pyramids that could
[1:36:47] have been built and put as
[1:36:48] put as you know a lot of things about
[1:36:50] egypt that yo joseph in those things
[1:36:52] but joseph knew there was no
[1:36:53] resurrection in egypt
[1:36:55] even goshen was an incredible place
[1:36:57] well-watered you know place and
[1:36:59] everything there was no resurrection
[1:37:00] there
[1:37:00] he said take my bones bury me in the
[1:37:02] promised land because he knew a
[1:37:04] resurrection was coming out of that
[1:37:06] place
[1:37:07] hallelujah they were marching to a place
[1:37:10] of resurrection
[1:37:12] but yet they said no we're on to death
[1:37:13] much
[1:37:16] they're on a match to life hallelujah
[1:37:20] where are we going we're marching to
[1:37:22] zion beautiful beautiful zion
[1:37:25] we're marching to zion the beautiful
[1:37:27] city of god
[1:37:29] hallelujah but caleb and joshua
[1:37:34] they were actually walking in reality at
[1:37:36] work
[1:37:37] he said we're more than able to take the
[1:37:38] land let's go get it right now
[1:37:41] right now hallelujah not tomorrow let's
[1:37:43] go now
[1:37:44] hallelujah we're more than able god's
[1:37:46] given us the land they weren't murmuring
[1:37:48] they were excited why because they are
[1:37:51] not walking by their five senses
[1:37:53] or what they imagined or how they felt
[1:37:56] or anything they were walking by
[1:37:57] faith hallelujah they actually had the
[1:38:00] real reality
[1:38:02] hallelujah why because it was revealed
[1:38:04] to them
[1:38:05] aren't you glad when god reveals his
[1:38:08] word becomes a living reality every
[1:38:09] promise becomes alive
[1:38:11] hallelujah amen
[1:38:15] israel had not yet received the promise
[1:38:17] but they were on their journey
[1:38:19] and without raising please do not please
[1:38:21] do understand
[1:38:22] that's where you are the nazarenes in
[1:38:24] the pilgrim holiness and so forth fell
[1:38:26] because israel when they came to the
[1:38:27] spot of kadesh barnea
[1:38:29] when the spies went over and said the
[1:38:31] land is great
[1:38:32] but some of them came back and said we
[1:38:34] can't take it
[1:38:35] i say they were standing in one of those
[1:38:37] rooms because their perception was we
[1:38:40] can't take it these ones are giants
[1:38:41] we're grasshoppers in their sight
[1:38:43] and i doubt very much they went to them
[1:38:45] with a questionnaire said can you
[1:38:46] answer these questions you want to take
[1:38:48] a survey are we
[1:38:50] what are we in your site a giants b
[1:38:53] average size or grasshoppers
[1:38:55] they didn't ask them that but that was
[1:38:56] their perception because they were going
[1:38:59] by their five senses
[1:39:00] and not by faith but when caleb and
[1:39:02] joshua went in the land they said i want
[1:39:03] this i want this
[1:39:04] this mountain i want that hallelujah
[1:39:06] they put their order in i want this
[1:39:08] place hallelujah
[1:39:09] why because they are walking by faith
[1:39:12] hallelujah
[1:39:13] amen so you know we don't want to we
[1:39:16] want to walk by the eyes of the word
[1:39:19] glory when the spies went over and said
[1:39:22] the land is great but some of them came
[1:39:24] back and said we can't take it because
[1:39:25] the cities are walled up and they were
[1:39:28] and so forth but caleb and joshua stood
[1:39:29] out and said we are more than able to
[1:39:31] take it
[1:39:32] because of their hallelujah caleb sorry
[1:39:34] i can't quite
[1:39:35] it's getting a bit small amen more
[1:39:38] because
[1:39:39] of the already signed up document
[1:39:40] statements they believed in two works of
[1:39:42] grace justification sanctification
[1:39:44] and could not move any farther and
[1:39:46] listen that whole generation perished in
[1:39:48] the wilderness but
[1:39:49] two that went over into the promised
[1:39:51] land and brought back the evidence that
[1:39:52] it was a goodly land
[1:39:54] and we were more than able to take it
[1:39:56] because it was god's promise our walk in
[1:39:58] reality
[1:39:58] now just say this he's talking about the
[1:40:01] nazarene pilgrim holiness
[1:40:02] they just came up to the second two
[1:40:04] works of grace and stopped
[1:40:06] a lot of message people can do the same
[1:40:08] thing
[1:40:09] they can come up to a place and they can
[1:40:11] intellectually say yes the words open
[1:40:13] all these things
[1:40:14] but when brother bram he would speak of
[1:40:16] quickening power
[1:40:18] so much more after the book came open
[1:40:20] than before
[1:40:22] he said there's no quickening power has
[1:40:24] been released upon the church
[1:40:26] hallelujah but then people actually sit
[1:40:28] back and say no no that's not for me hey
[1:40:30] listen
[1:40:30] i don't care what pentecostalism has
[1:40:32] done to the gifts
[1:40:34] i don't care i don't care what the bogus
[1:40:36] has done i'm just looking at the genuine
[1:40:38] i don't care what they've done that's
[1:40:39] irrelevant to me i'm not walking based
[1:40:42] on what others have done
[1:40:43] or have not done i'm walking according
[1:40:45] to this word
[1:40:46] who cares one of the you know one of my
[1:40:48] favorite scriptures in the bible says if
[1:40:50] we compare ourselves among ourselves
[1:40:51] we're unwise
[1:40:52] so we are foolish if we compare
[1:40:54] ourselves with ourselves the apostle
[1:40:55] paul said it
[1:40:56] so we become foolish if we compare
[1:40:58] ourselves if you compare yourself with
[1:40:59] another brother or sister you're foolish
[1:41:01] if you compare this church with another
[1:41:03] church you're foolish why where to
[1:41:05] compare ourselves with this word
[1:41:06] that's the only thing we're to compare
[1:41:08] ourselves with jesus christ the word
[1:41:10] that's all that matters they can do what
[1:41:12] they do
[1:41:14] right i'm not here to compare
[1:41:18] hallelujah i'm not interested in
[1:41:20] comparing with other people
[1:41:21] we're to compare ourselves with this
[1:41:23] word this is our measuring stick
[1:41:26] amen so let's walk according to this
[1:41:29] word
[1:41:29] amen hallelujah
[1:41:33] amen so let's not stop
[1:41:37] you say well the pentecostals went off
[1:41:38] on the gifts who cares they're still in
[1:41:40] the word
[1:41:41] dancing in the spirits in the word
[1:41:43] brother brown criticized it until he saw
[1:41:44] it happen he started doing it too
[1:41:46] he got under the anointing why do we sit
[1:41:49] back
[1:41:49] why don't we just let god be god
[1:41:52] hallelujah if you're there just crying
[1:41:53] quietly that's fine if you want to shout
[1:41:55] shout
[1:41:56] out be you in the scripture be you and
[1:42:00] the lord
[1:42:04] amen we're more than able to take it
[1:42:08] because it was god's promise they had
[1:42:10] reality
[1:42:11] then instead of people going on
[1:42:12] receiving the holy ghost speaking with
[1:42:13] things receiving the power of god the
[1:42:15] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:42:16] signs wonders miracles they felt that it
[1:42:18] would break down their tradition of
[1:42:20] doctrine
[1:42:20] and what happened to it perished in the
[1:42:22] land
[1:42:23] that's right we don't want to perish
[1:42:25] we're not stopping
[1:42:27] we're not stopping okay sure jordan was
[1:42:30] maybe a nice place to stop but i'm not
[1:42:31] stopping
[1:42:32] sure jericho looked quite nice but i'm
[1:42:34] not stopping i mean surely the garland
[1:42:36] heights is nice i'm not stopping
[1:42:38] jerusalem i'm not stopping i'm getting
[1:42:39] the whole thing every part of the
[1:42:41] scripture's mind
[1:42:42] that every promise that pertains to the
[1:42:44] bride you know what we need to do
[1:42:46] we need to take our marriage certificate
[1:42:50] and look at everything that's allotted
[1:42:52] to us
[1:42:55] instead of looking at everything else we
[1:42:56] should look at this what does it promise
[1:42:58] me
[1:42:59] joy peace to be long suffering
[1:43:03] gentleness meekness faith love divine
[1:43:06] love charity
[1:43:07] brotherly love overcoming power
[1:43:11] so this is my this is actually my
[1:43:13] identity this is who i am this is who we
[1:43:16] should be
[1:43:17] hallelujah gifts of the spirit
[1:43:19] manifesting god living in his church
[1:43:22] oh god make us a powerhouse this is what
[1:43:24] our this is what our pressure be god i
[1:43:25] want to be a bubbling stream
[1:43:27] i want you to bubble out of me and
[1:43:29] bubble out of me and bubble i mean just
[1:43:30] come and live whatever you want to do
[1:43:32] lord
[1:43:32] manifest your word and my life
[1:43:35] hallelujah
[1:43:36] that's how we should be lord live why
[1:43:38] that you'll get any credit i don't want
[1:43:39] no credit it's god
[1:43:41] you know what a testimony is you are
[1:43:43] testifying of what god did not what you
[1:43:45] did
[1:43:45] that's a real testimony hallelujah
[1:43:50] hallelujah now amen
[1:43:53] but the believers the caleb and joshua
[1:43:56] outfit
[1:43:56] i thought that'd be a cool church name
[1:43:58] we'll just leave that there
[1:44:00] where do you fellowship the caleb with
[1:44:02] joshua outfit
[1:44:04] well we'll definitely get a good a good
[1:44:06] a good website name because no one else
[1:44:07] we called it
[1:44:08] the charities you know commission we can
[1:44:10] register that no no
[1:44:12] anyway that was going on to the promise
[1:44:14] they moved on over into the land and
[1:44:16] took the land and settled down in the
[1:44:18] land as a possession and we must never
[1:44:20] stop at justification and
[1:44:22] uh sanctification let's go to the
[1:44:24] baptism of the holy spirit let's not
[1:44:25] stop at believing on the lord jesus
[1:44:27] being baptized
[1:44:28] let's not stop because he cleaned us up
[1:44:30] from a life of sin
[1:44:31] but now pressed on into a position to a
[1:44:34] promise of the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:44:36] for peter said on day of pentecost
[1:44:37] for the promises unto you and to your
[1:44:39] children to them that's far off even as
[1:44:41] many as the lord our god shall call
[1:44:43] this is an adoption by the way we should
[1:44:45] keep pressing till the body's changed
[1:44:48] how do i know i've arrived when this
[1:44:50] thing changes
[1:44:52] so until then let's press the battle
[1:44:54] amen let's take every promise
[1:44:56] let's defeat every devil that comes our
[1:44:57] way i mean let's put him under our feet
[1:44:59] let's recognize who we are
[1:45:00] i mean let's take this word and chop
[1:45:02] through every dart unbelief
[1:45:03] all formal spirits pity party whatever
[1:45:06] it may be pride let's chop through it
[1:45:07] and take every promise of god
[1:45:09] we're ordained to do the job hallelujah
[1:45:13] hallelujah you know jesus spent three
[1:45:16] and a half years trying to get his
[1:45:18] disciples into reality
[1:45:20] you're not fisherman you're not a tax
[1:45:22] collector you're not the woman at the
[1:45:24] well
[1:45:25] you're not mary magdalene who had seven
[1:45:26] devils this is not your reality
[1:45:29] your reality is that you will be the
[1:45:31] people that i'm gonna pour myself into
[1:45:33] and manifest my glory you're part of a
[1:45:35] multi-member body he spent a lot of time
[1:45:37] getting these people into this reality
[1:45:39] hallelujah and their eyes come open and
[1:45:44] they saw
[1:45:45] this is the reality we're to live by
[1:45:47] hallelujah
[1:45:49] we're going to do where are we here we
[1:45:52] are
[1:45:52] now
[1:45:55] but we who believe the word now better
[1:45:59] know and it's his living presence for us
[1:46:00] on this day
[1:46:01] we've separated from dead works and the
[1:46:03] holy ghost comes in to confirm the word
[1:46:05] and make it so
[1:46:06] hebrews 38 proves that to us proves that
[1:46:09] god has raised
[1:46:10] him up for us according to his promised
[1:46:12] word thousands of years have passed 2000
[1:46:14] years almost has passed but what is it
[1:46:16] the token still holds
[1:46:18] that's the holy ghost by the way that
[1:46:20] god raised him up on the third day
[1:46:22] if you've just got the word that's all
[1:46:24] you got but when the token is applied
[1:46:26] then christ is reality to you
[1:46:30] just like he was to abraham just like he
[1:46:32] was to moses just like he was to joshua
[1:46:34] to caleb just like he was to the
[1:46:35] believers all the way down he's a
[1:46:37] reality
[1:46:38] hallelujah and he does today like he did
[1:46:41] then and so it throws it right back into
[1:46:43] their lap again they can't get around it
[1:46:45] god promised it and here it is
[1:46:46] but the token has got to be applied he
[1:46:49] says you take the token
[1:46:52] and you accept his sacrifice blood then
[1:46:54] he gives us life the life of the token
[1:46:57] it's a promised seal ephesians 4 30.
[1:46:59] grieve not the holy spirit of god
[1:47:01] whereby you're sealed into the day of
[1:47:02] your redemption
[1:47:03] then being baptized into him first
[1:47:04] corinthians 12 we become part of his
[1:47:07] body
[1:47:07] and in him as the fullness in him is all
[1:47:10] the sufficient the
[1:47:11] sufficiency that we have need of
[1:47:15] everything i have need of is in him

[1:47:31] on a cigarette to get some kind of
[1:47:33] relief i don't have to go on youtube to
[1:47:34] get some kind of relief
[1:47:36] i can take the lily of the valley he is
[1:47:38] the opium here's the thing that makes me
[1:47:40] walk in the clouds

[1:47:43] hopes he's my rest he's my god he's my
[1:47:45] savior
[1:47:45] he's my healer he has all that i need of
[1:47:48] because i die we

[1:47:52] all
[1:47:52] sufficiency when you when you get to
[1:47:56] that spot
[1:47:56] in your walk when you get to that spot
[1:47:59] that your sufficiency doesn't depend on
[1:48:00] immortal it depends on him
[1:48:03] hallelujah amen isn't it wonderful when
[1:48:06] he becomes your everything
[1:48:07] you can just walk with him and doesn't

[1:49:28] hallelujah that's right amen they rotted
[1:49:31] in jails they were fed to lions they
[1:49:32] were sword asunder
[1:49:33] thou jerk to pieces you can't kill it
[1:49:35] right a church has predestinated those
[1:49:37] he
[1:49:38] foreknew like he did jesus what stopped
[1:49:41] him
[1:49:42] nothing nothing stopped him religion
[1:49:45] didn't stop him
[1:49:46] culture didn't stop him unbelief didn't
[1:49:48] stop him devils didn't stop him
[1:49:50] hell didn't stop him death and couldn't
[1:49:52] stop him roman
[1:49:53] soldiers couldn't stop him the seal of
[1:49:54] the high priest couldn't stop him
[1:49:56] the tomb couldn't stop him nothing could
[1:49:58] stop him because he was predestinated
[1:50:00] able to manifest the victory to take our
[1:50:03] sins away
[1:50:04] nothing could stop him he was called
[1:50:07] those he called he is
[1:50:08] justified those he has justified he has
[1:50:11] already glorified pre-destinated
[1:50:15] hallelujah well what's your reality
[1:50:18] you know our reality is actually based
[1:50:21] on the atmosphere we live in
[1:50:23] brother brown would be hunting one day
[1:50:26] and he would come until there's a bit of
[1:50:28] a storm there's a blow down and he
[1:50:30] looked and this eagle came out
[1:50:31] and was kind of flexing its wings and at
[1:50:34] the same time a little chipmunk came out
[1:50:36] and started barking at him
[1:50:40] and brother brown realized he's not
[1:50:42] barking at him he's barking at that
[1:50:43] eagle
[1:50:44] and now that eagle looked at him and
[1:50:46] brother had his gun
[1:50:48] that eagle wasn't afraid he knew what he
[1:50:49] had he knew what he was
[1:50:51] hallelujah and that eagle looked at that
[1:50:53] chipmunk and just got sick of the
[1:50:54] chatter chatter chatter chatter because
[1:50:56] remember the eagle
[1:50:57] isn't ordained to live on the ground
[1:50:59] he's ordained to live in the heavenlies
[1:51:00] that's his reality is up in the
[1:51:02] heavenlies others he just got sick of
[1:51:04] all the chatter chatter you know we get
[1:51:05] sick of stuff eh
[1:51:07] sick of what the devil does sick of his
[1:51:09] nonsense you know
[1:51:10] forget the chatter chatter chatter of
[1:51:12] the doubt and all
[1:51:13] that's really happening and no no no who
[1:51:15] cares about all that stuff
[1:51:16] spread your wings to the winds of faith
[1:51:18] soar up into your god-given reality
[1:51:22] hallelujah hallelujah hey we are built
[1:51:25] an eagle is built to fly a chipmunk is
[1:51:28] built to bark i'm an eagle
[1:51:31] what are you built to be now brother
[1:51:34] brown tells a story
[1:51:36] uh i don't have it up there we can you
[1:51:38] know anyway
[1:51:40] brother man tells a story of a of an
[1:51:42] orphan girl and
[1:51:43] i'm just going to close on this because
[1:51:45] some people will say well the conditions
[1:51:47] they live in
[1:51:49] actually are greater than their joy in
[1:51:50] the lord by their actions
[1:51:53] they may not say it with their mouth but
[1:51:54] by their actions this is what they do
[1:51:56] and so brother brown would tell a story
[1:51:58] of an orphan girl
[1:51:59] who went to go live on a ranch that was
[1:52:02] owned by the amna company
[1:52:04] hallelujah and she lived with i think
[1:52:06] her uncle and her
[1:52:07] and her cousins three three girls
[1:52:11] and she was actually there not to live
[1:52:13] like her cousins did
[1:52:14] but as a basically a slave and she would
[1:52:18] have to do the dishes
[1:52:19] she'd have to clean up she would have to
[1:52:21] you know do the washing
[1:52:22] do all kinds of stuff and her cousins
[1:52:25] didn't treat her nice her uncle didn't
[1:52:27] treat her nice
[1:52:28] she was destitute and stuck on this
[1:52:30] ranch
[1:52:31] and maybe this is what you thought this
[1:52:33] is my lot in life
[1:52:35] i'm just going to live here i'm going to
[1:52:36] die here this is it but then there was a
[1:52:38] man who came to the ranch
[1:52:40] and he was looking for a wife hallelujah
[1:52:43] you'll know where i'm going just
[1:52:44] enjoy it amen he was looking for her he
[1:52:46] was looking for a wife and
[1:52:47] and and and her cousins thought we're
[1:52:50] gonna one of us is gonna marry this
[1:52:52] this man because he's he's the son of
[1:52:54] the company owner he's very rich
[1:52:57] and so they would dress up they would
[1:52:58] tart themselves up and have big
[1:53:00] parties and stuff and try and grab him
[1:53:02] and you know all that kind of stuff but
[1:53:04] he wasn't looking for just what the five
[1:53:07] senses declared
[1:53:08] he was looking for character he was
[1:53:10] looking for the other part of himself
[1:53:12] and he got sick of their shin good yo yo
[1:53:14] shindigs and carry on
[1:53:16] and he went out one night and she was
[1:53:18] there tipping out the
[1:53:19] bath water or whatever it was and now he
[1:53:22] came into her presence
[1:53:24] and she got scared and he began to say
[1:53:28] to her you know i've come out looking
[1:53:29] for a wife
[1:53:30] and i've been noticing you our lord
[1:53:33] the eye of our lord is upon us
[1:53:36] hallelujah
[1:53:37] and and and he said i've been looking
[1:53:39] i'm looking for character i'm not
[1:53:40] interested in all this carry on i'm
[1:53:42] looking for something real
[1:53:44] hallelujah and he promised her i he said
[1:53:47] i believe you meet the qualifications
[1:53:48] will you marry me
[1:53:50] maybe got down on the knee and did all
[1:53:51] you know and
[1:53:53] and he said in a year's time i'm going
[1:53:55] to come back and get you

[1:53:57] chicago wherever it is i'm going to get

[1:54:00] year
[1:54:01] but in a year's time i'm going to come
[1:54:04] get you
[1:54:05] hallelujah and then he kissed her on the
[1:54:07] cheek whatever more gave the promise
[1:54:09] now you imagine being that girl your
[1:54:12] reality is

[1:54:57] because her reality was changed because

[1:55:02] was going to another land
