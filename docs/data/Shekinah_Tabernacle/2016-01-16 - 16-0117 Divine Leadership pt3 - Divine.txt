that's good amen let's go to uh Luke chapter 17 we'll read from verse 36 down to 37 I'll just read this here so 26-37 of of Luke chapter 17 and as it was and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given a marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed and that day he which shall be upon the Housetop and a stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back remember Lot's wife uh whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it I tell you in that in that night there shall be two men in one bed one shall be taken the other shall be left two women shall be grinding together one shall be taken and the other left two men shall be in the field one shall be taken and the other left and they answered and uh and they answered and said unto him where Lord and he said unto him wheresoever the body is uh thither will the Eagles be gathered together amen let's just bow our heads in word of prayer gracious father gracious Heavenly Father we just want to Lord I'm so glad we can say Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name Lord we're so glad that you've revealed to us that you're our father Lord spirits come into us where I we cry Abba Father my father my father and Lord we want to thank you we can truly say we are amazed that you love us Lord we're amazed that you care Lord we're so glad you you've washed all our sins away Lord we're not stumbling blind in this world but we see where we are Lord we see where we're going we see who we are father we want to thank you for that privilege Lord just to walk with you Lord to feel our hand in yours Lord every day father what a privilege it is Lord and dear God we just pray as we have assembled One More Time Lord I pray you'd come one more time father speak to our hearts Lord may we walk out different Lord may you be the preacher this morning oh God take your word and make it live in front of us Lord I pray father may you give us receptive Hearts attentive AO Lord I pray as well father I pray you bless those who are not here Lord be with them Lord I pray they would Lord you'd gather Lord them Lord to yourself father may they have a little time together and may you just be there as well oh god father we want to commit the service into your hands may you have your way please and in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you may be seated so I want to I want to continue in my thought of of of divine leadership and you may think well that's kind of a unusual text to be reading but we understand that uh you know there is a I want to look into God's leadership in times that Jesus said it would be like when the son of man is revealed so uh so this morning morning I might not even really get into the subject I maybe want to lay a foundation but you see it's important see Jesus in the scripture he was laying out as it was the days of lot as it was the days of Noah so shall it be when the son of man is revealed so you might this may be very foundational to many people but it's very important because he says when you see these conditions upon the Earth then this is a time when I'm going to be revealed and we understand that how the True Believers you know it's important because the same conditions that Noah faced and the same conditions that Abraham and Sarah faced they have come right back around again and we're living in those days again and so if that is true then how the True Believer will be led will be the same today how the make believer acted will be how they act today and how the unbelievers ACT then will be how they act today so you see the same story just repeats itself it's just different people but so so how Abraham and Noah and Sarah were LED will be the same way the Believers LED today how the unbeliever hang around the believer then will be the same way they hang around them today and how the unbeliever is then is how they are today so it's just a it's just history has come around in a circle again and history's repeated itself so I just want to I just want to go to the conditions a little bit you know uh so Jesus that first scripture he read says as it was the days of Noah so shall it be in the days when the um so shall it be in the days of the son of man now let's go to Genesis chapter 6 this is going to be a bit of a Bible study today uh but I want you to just see this is uh this is vital because if we can if we can just you know we've heard I'm sure some of us have heard for years we're in living in the days of lot we're living the days of Noah we see the conditions but we have to go just beyond of well these conditions we got to see how the people lad because if if the believer was led a certain way then they'll be led the same way today amen and the and the the make believer act the same way the unbeliever the same way so it's very important and and so we need to go into these things so let's just read here so Genesis 6 and we read verses 1 to8 and it said and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face the earth and the and daughters were born unto them that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fear and they took them wives of all which they chose and the Lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be 120 years there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men they bear children unto them the same became Mighty Men which were of old men of reown and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the Lord that he made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart heart and the Lord said I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the Earth both man and Beast and creeping thing in the fouls of the year for it repented me that I made them but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord so here's a picture now now but I want to I want to uh just just just look into this a little bit because you know many times we read the scripture we think the days of Noah and we think well there's great violence upon the Earth you know and there you know so so it's wickedness people were evil you know and we and we can see that is true man's imaginations continually evil as it was in the days of Noah we can see that you know it's actually how how the you know you know they married wives you know and then you know you they took them wives all of which they chose so so you know there's a lot of intermar you know marriage and remarriage all these things going on and then man has multiplied it says the first verse when men begin to multiply upon the face of the Earth and you can see you look at world population the world is greatly increased in population you know we can see that man's imagination is evil continually today but the question is what caused it to end up in this condition because you got to look at now what is the cause because if you can go to the cause then if you remedy that you know if you reverse what the cause is then you can undo the effects amen so now the very simple reason that God actually came to a stage where it actually repented him that he made man it grieved him he was you know he's actually sad that he even made man is actually it was the sons of God and what they did caused the world to come into this condition it was the sons of God doing it it wasn't now we understand in in in verse one and and verse two it says that the son you you're the daughters of men and the sons of God those are not Angels pressing themselves into human flesh we understand that the sons of God is from Seth's line and the Daughters of men are from Cain's line and there became an inter you interbreeding going on between God's you Seth's line and and can's line and so it's when it's when these two came together by by them coming together they caused the flood they caused it was the sons of God falling from their position because no doubt Adam would have said stay away from them they are not they are from the serpent a amen they knew it was a blood sin in in the garden amen so they would have said stay away from those they are not they may look human they may be the same they have a soul you know but they're not part of us okay so what but then what happened is there came a time now when the sons of God married into the daughters of men and it caused this fall amen they fell from their position and by falling from their position they actually caused the flood so it wasn't the daughter it wasn't necessarily what Cain's lineage was doing it was the sons of God what they were doing caused caused the flood to come so them falling from their position caused them and then you can see this if we go into second you know you you take Ahab marrying Jezebel because things just cycle around history repeats in Cycles you see Ahab he was an Israelite he was the king there but he married an unbeliever Gentile and she didn't become a Believer like Ruth did when she married Boaz or or Rahab married Salon um yeah yeah Salon or you know they they became Believers but Jezebel brought her religion into bail worship into into Israel and it became sanctioned by the state and they killed all the prophets and then the you know of God and they and they just worshiped ba so what happened is Ahab by marrying Jezebel caused the whole nation to fall amen and then you can see the same thing where the king of Judah which is um uh Jam uh Jarome if if that's how you pronounce it he married so so Ahab was the king of Israel you know you know at that time there were two kingdoms there was Judah and Israel there was a split and so Ahab married Jezebel and that brought in B worship he married the wrong way he didn't marry a Believer and then so that caused she and she didn't become converted she just brought her gods in and and they polluted Israel completely and then now what happened was the king of Judah now uh jihar or however you pronounce it um um I'm sorry he married ahab's daughter and then through her Bale worship came into Judah so by marrying the wrong they fell just like in Genesis 6 the sons of God saw the daughters of men they married them and they fell from their position amen so that actually that actually caused that actually caused the flood because you got to look at oh there's violence there's there's there's multiplication of people there's imaginations evil continually well well that's that's the symptoms but what's the cause how did this begin and that's how it be and then we can see even the same thing let's go to Matthew 24 are you all I trust this is not so out of left field I I trust you can see it in the Bible amen they fell from their position and by them falling it caused the flood so I'm just looking into some some conditions now CU you got to look at what Noah was facing am mean you got to see the conditions that you know you know that he had to he he had to wrestle with and then so Matthew 24 and we'll go to verse 27 so now remember so Matthew 24 the disciples asked three questions when shall these things be the destruction of the Temple when are you going to come and when's the end of the world and then he answers those three questions in that chapter Matthew 24:25 those two chapters and so now let's read from verse 27 down to verse 31 and then we're going to break this down for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth even unto the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be so as it was in the beginning it'll be the same same thing same same Ministry on display for whever the carcasses there will the Eagles be gathered together and then he um it's important when you read prophecy like this in the Book of Revelation and things it's not a linear thing it's like a step letter it goes up and down okay because be because we have had the son of man he has come he has revealed himself and then the Eagles have gathered to the word which is the carcass which is the word and he says immediately so so now he's going to put the in time immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken that sounds a bit vague but this is what it means so he says remember he's talking he's talking to Jews here the apostles were Jews so he's saying immediately after the tribulation of those days and that tribulation is not the Great Tribulation that tribulation is what the suffered there in the Holocaust and and and those times where they were you know you know murdered and massacred and all these things that was a Great Tribulation they went through so that was the tribulation those and then after that the sun shall be darkened now this is all s you know symbolic it's not literally the Sun is going to be a permanent eclipse and all these things but the sun in the scripture represents Jesus yeah yeah it represents the light of the word amen so the Sun so the sun shall be darken so the light of the Gospel will not be able to shine as it has been and then if we go to Revelations chapter 9 and we don't have I don't want to give you too much detail I mean yeah I don't want to give you too much I want to get this thought out clear but you go to Revelations chapter 9 and there's a Angel Falls which is Lucifer himself he's given the key to open the bottomless pit which is hell and smoke comes out of the pit and smoke darkens you know when you try and look through through smoke you can't see things amen you can kind of see it have you ever had a big bonfire and there's a sun there or seen tried to look at the sun through smoke you can see the outline of it but you can't really see it as it as it would be if there was nothing in the way and smoke also gets in everything it blinds people you know you know have you ever had a barbecue whatever or you know a campfire and the smoke just comes into your eyes you can't even see and you know and so this is actually the effects of Hell coming upon the Earth has actually tried to darken out the gospel light shining amen because you think about it if this message came like at ausa Street or even before that before these things happened you think imagine the power it would have upon the whole world Amen why doesn't have the power why it's calling out the elect but it's because there's a blindness going on because something has been released and God's allowed it to happen said Darkness has come up smoke has come up out of the pit and this is what causes the sun to be darken amen and the moon shall not give her light now we understand that the Moon is a representation of the church and the moon doesn't have its own light it just reflects the light of the Sun and we don't have our own light we just reflect him amen so the Moon the Moon shall not give her light so there'll come a time when the church world is totally blacked out and I'll read you something this is in this is in shalom in 1964 and we're taught in the New Testament he says don't fail to get this in the New Testament that we're not of this city Jerusalem on Earth but we are from the New Jerusalem Above So this must be the moon Jerusalem not the New Jerusalem above so the moon representing the church Earthly and isn't it strange that just before the pope took his journey to Jerusalem that the moon and the heavens made a total blackout just a few days before he took it his journey he's coming there also I mean coming here also you know see now it's never been known see like for that to happen but what does it show that this he's he's doing this to win Fellowship as he met on the day after he came into Jerusalem he met the Greek Orthodox hierarchy and what does that reflect Fellowship they wanting Protestants and c and Catholicism joining together which they are doing and will will completely do and we've seen that lived out and God reflected this to us in the moon of a total blackout by his mercy and Grace did any of you see the paper where they took the pictures of the Moon I have it here if it ain't a perfect image leaving out the seventh age which is not yet exactly the way ijw it by the Holy Spirit the church ages there's six of them now these pictures are in the church age book if you want to see them um the six so the six conditions of the Moon how its brightness in the first church age dark in the second third fourth fifth and sixth just the way the Holy Spirit led me to draw them on the board and then identified them with himself on the wall of the Tabernacle two years ago the moon reflects it's uh sorry the moon reflects itself and science again picks up the picture of the church ages just as they picked up the light Yonder and put it in Life Magazine of the opening of the seals of the revealing in the age of the um uh uh um of the seventh angel and the days of his Ministry the seventh messenger the mysteries of God which all the Mysteries has been along the ages should be revealed made manifest it should be at that time and he did it his words don't fail isn't it that a mysterious thing God drawing in the heavens the same thing that they hold same God let me draw on the Blackboard and then by himself there's three times he's perfectly identified it and just before the pope goes into Jerusalem which that was the church Church the Moon is the church represents the church and before the church the shadow of the world crosses the moon and the shadow of worldl ism the shadow of worldliness worldly church has swept across to black out the entire light of the Bible the world got in the light of the reflection do you uh do you understand the world crossed in the light of the Moon and blinded out the sun and the reflection of the Moon that's supposed to be giving light to the Earth it was blacked out and it come and and draw the pictures just exactly like he did by inspiration before it happened so he's explaining when he when he's at the end of the series of the church ages he's I think he's in the revelations there and God came down and the PFI drew the circles of the church changes on the wall of the Tabernacle there's one sermon and right the end you hear a woman scream and it's right then when when God because the whole place saw it you hear a woman scream because she sees it and and God draws that and then later there's there's before the pope first time the pope ever goes to Jerusalem there's there's a there's a lunar eclipse before he goes to Jerusalem and this is why he's talking about the photographs so he so and things happen in heaven before it happens upon the Earth amen so he's saying that the sun shall not give her light I mean to the moon shall not give her light and it's already been shown the moon doesn't give her light anymore amen I'm just and the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the power of the heavens shall be shaken now the Stars the Stars Abraham he saw the sand of the sea and he saw the Stars he said this is how your seed is going to be the the sand of the seashore was the Jews and the stars in heaven were the Gentiles amen yeah you know the story God tells Abraham you're going to be the father of many nations can you number the sand of the sea can you Number the Stars I can't number that's how many you know you know you know you you know they'll be without number yeah so the stars represent Gentiles amen and the Stars falling because the literal stars are not going to fall to the Earth remember stars in heaven they're not these little bitty things they're massive they're not literally going to fall because if they fell if one fell to the Earth we wouldn't even be here so it's not speaking of a literal Stars falling it's Sy it's you know it's all symbolic and so the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken so the stars now so these are meant to be Believers reflecting a light but they fall from their position what sons of God falling the you know from their position again and because the heavens we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so the heaven has been here is a position see he's saying there's going to be Darkness the sun is not going to show her light the Moon is you know you the moon is going to be darkened and the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the of the heavens shall be shaken the church will be shaken and this has already happened amen so so he's saying this is what's going to happen and we say why is the world so bad is because the church has fallen from its position I'm just showing what happened there in the natural there in in in the days of Noah has repeated in the spiritual today this is why the world you know that's the reason the world's in its condition is because the church has fallen from its position am mean who's who's really the you know the voice against the wrong who should really stand up and say no that you know that is a moral that yo that that that we allow that to happen who used to censor things who doesn't censor things anymore who gobbles it up the church does christians do soal and he says this brother BR speaking the influence of another so it's not the you know the reason the world because there is never a vacuum in this life right there is never a void something will always fill the vacuum or fill the void and if so so if the if the church falls from its position something's going to fill that void who's filled the void the devil's filled the void who who dictates the society this is the way it should be the devil does Amen because this scripture has been fulfilled amen you must that it's very important and then so he says in in in in the influence of another he says this um he says they don't know sorry I'll just read this from the beginning don't try to make yourself big like Uzziah so remember Uzziah he was the king he was blessed and he tried to take the priest place but he was a king he had no right to be a priest and so he tried to offer incense before the Lord he was struck with Leprosy so don't try and make yourself big like uzai basically I can do what I want he got in the he said I'll do this anyhow whether you ain't got no business telling me see the priest actually said you shouldn't do this but he just he just went it anyway he would have made himself humble yes Servants of God pardon me he'd never took leprosy if he just humbled himself no um I know that's your job God called you that's your office you go ahead and do it sir I'm very sorry backed off then uh uh there'd be a different writing in this book see see if he actually did that but when he was corrected he got angry you can correct people about something or tell them tell them about their wrongdoing they'll leave the church they won't got um they won't have none go to somebody tell tell woman they shouldn't wear short here well I'll go somewhere where they can wear it and a lady went here not long ago I sent my wife down there was in a meeting she didn't have time to wash her ha and I told her to go to one of them beauty shops and get her hair washed she went over there and that lady didn't even know how to put her hair up she had to twist it up around the top of her head come on said I never did wash anybody's hair with long hair she didn't know anything about it I don't know oh my see they don't know what it's all about why why so so notice the reason he goes why is the world in this it's because of weak pulpits they' have been sitting under that's right it's exactly right the weak pulpits that won't tell the truth they compromise with it so it wasn't so so so he didn't go to oh it's Hollywood and it's influence and this is why they do that now he says it's weak pulpits amen it's weak pulpits they compromise with the truth and that's why the world see the powers of heaven will be shaken amen the moon won't reflect the light anymore why because the church has fallen now I would have been better uh it would have been better if you hear it and you was to talk to one of them they'll get up and blow up and say I'll never hear that Holy Roller again see go ahead youai that's right leprosy well I'd rather have leprosy anytime than that kind of leprosy well that's leprosy of the Soul see so sin in your soul see when you go up and broke out you're right when you broke out again leprosy sin which is worse than leprosy it's leprosy of the Soul Uzziah probably went and slept with his fathers in the Bible said which he was saved because he just did something wrong but when you do it knowing better then you break out a leprosy of the soul and then there's no way to take a uh Lep's soul in you know that go then make yourself little humble yourself because uh uh humble yourself before God recognize don't get all puffed up and blow up search the scriptures and see if it's right see he's saying the reason the world's in this condition is because of weak pulpits amen what is that that is the sons of God falling from their position as it was the days of no so shall it be when the son of man is revealed amen so that's why and we see that Christianity has fallen from where it once was and and and once again it's because of a uniting of with Pagan Darkness just like Ahab and Jezebel and drum did marrying so just as Ahab married Jezebel and drum married their daughter as a uniting of real you say Christianity and Pagan darkness and that's what caused the fall and that's what happened there in the natural there in the days of Noah amen now we have to unfortunate well not unfortunately we have to admit that there's always three classes of people yeah there's Believers make Believers and unbelievers there's always three and now so we see so if we see how so Noah Noah was divinely led we can all agree it's said he found Noah found the grace in the sight of the Lord he received a vision now you going to build the ark I'm going to destroy the Earth but I'm going to give a way of escape to whosoever will let them come so the True Believer is led directly by God from his word amen the True Believer is led directly by God they know the author of the book and the author leads them in his word amen this may be very Elementary but but there's a great dividing line between a real believer and a make believer but remember a real believer at once stage can be an unbeliever then they can be a make believer because they want to believe but then eventually God will make them a Believer but an unbeliever can never be a believer and a make believer can never become a real believer amen and you must understand if the word calls you a lot or calls you a you know some some some make believer remember lot could not have a second birth amen you know you know the make Believers that hung around the ark they could only be make Believers but we have we have the opportunity to receive another birth to make us a Believer amen so we can be born again so we made a Sarah and Abraham amen but lot never had that opportunity Cain could never be birthed amen again to become a real believer he didn't have that opportunity that side of Calvary but but we have that opportunity so there's always three classes of people but as I said the um the believer can at one time be a make believer or an unbeliever I was an unbeliever one time but in me was to be a real believer and then God came across my path and just revealed himself to me and showed hey you're actually a Believer I mean you're not a make believer an unbeliever though you were in those conditions you actually became a real believer and so now we can see lot as it was the days of lot now lot was a make believer amen lot was not Abraham and Abraham was not lot and it's the same thing in Noah's day we say who were the make Believers in Noah's day there would have been people hanging around the ark amen you see it today when California goes in then I'll know the message is true amen they're just hanging around they you know they got the air out they know something's going to take place when California sinks in then I'll RAR come to the Lord I'll give my life that's being a make believer because I believe when that happens it'll be too late amen we'll really know as a prophet when California thinks yeah you will but you'll be outside you don't want to be outside what's that people hanging around the ark people hanging around the place of safety knowing there's a place of safety they just hang around how you doing Noah how's how's the boat going today well I just put in the cross beams and now I put this floor and oh can I help you with that a little bit amen what can I do in church I'm just going to hone a drill down if this is quiet it's fine amen what can I do and then so you know they come and they hang around and they even try and partake of things but they don't when it comes to the crunch they're not willing to step inside amen they're not willing to actually step into the door the door's there hey it was a big door amen no would have had a big door into the ark two by two they went in it would have been a big door even if they just took the baby elephants and you know you know a baby elephant's still a big animal a baby hippo is still a big thing you you know wouldn't have been one of these doors would have been a big door amen just walk in there and and and and stay in there oh yeah we will and they would have thought you know oh now the door's shut God shut the door no or open it when it rains but God shut the door amen but Noah those people weren't led by God to to build the ark they did not have a commission by God to do this but then you see Noah's family had to come under that same vision and so all Noah had to do is just lay the blueprint lay the blueprint in front of his family amen you got to lay the blueprint you know you know no what I said God's told me to build this boat because they would have come a day but it found great you Noah found Grace in the sight of God there would have come a day where where his sons would have come to him what's happened to you you know he would have been he would have been stirred up we're going to build this boat we going to cut some wood I got to you know I got to build this big he would have been stirred up something happened to Noah dad what happened to you what are you doing building boats we we don't even live near water it's going to rain it's never what do you mean it's going to rain God told me it's going to rain and maybe they would have laughed at them to begin with amen hey they were people like we're people amen their family like we have family amen but I believe they would have seen a difference in Noah and so Noah just kept laying the blueprint out God's to do this look at the world and how bad it is we know our God is a righteous God and he's a judge and if he's a judge there has to be a penalty for crossing his word and look at how these people are but they're good people Dad no let's just build the ark and let's give them an opportunity and show them they just need to get in the door when it's finished am me but let's focus building the ark and then eventually because it took Faith to step into that door it took genuine Faith to step into the Ark in that day so his so his sons and their wives had to believe like he believed they had to have the the same faith that he had but remember he had the vision to build it but then they came under that same anointing to build the ark because they believed if they didn't believe they would never have gone to the ark this why you just got to lay the blueprint in front of your family why are we why are we doing these things dad why are we doing these things Mom it's because we're this is an arc of safety amen and love is drawing us into that Ark of Safety amen and we do these things because we love the Lord amen if that's all you can drill into your kids drill it in amen it's important we love him this is why we do this not because of fear I don't live this way because I'm scared I'm going to go to hell I don't I'm not scared I'm going to you know I don't live this way because I'm scared I'm going to go into the tribulation amen because if fear is driving you it won't get you in but if love drives you you pulled in I feel a pull Lord I Surrender my life amen you getting pulled into the ark h there's got to be that love there then that love has to be projected to your family so they had to they had to become Believers like Noah did but the make Believers just hung around the ark amen and there would have been and and and and and there came a separation time because the make Believers would have no doubt acted like Noah's family at a stage amen they would have said yes you know you know you're a prophet of the Lord I believe your word Noah but they only confessed it with their mouth they didn't put their hand to it and actually gone to the ark amen so that was that was the make Believers that he had to contend with and then so Abraham had the same thing with lot amen is this okay so first we have to admit there's three classes of people and I and and this is from God as his own interpret in 64 it meant just exactly what he said as it was in the days of lot so shall it be at the coming of the son of man what about the days of lot let's go back just for a moment and find out what they were doing there were three class of people in the days of lot believer make believer unbeliever remember a make believer can actually you know brother bam he you know gives an illustration that a mule which is a hybrid between a donkey and a horse can outwork a real horse a real thoroughbread horse a mule could outwork a real thoroughbread horse amen so but that is actually just a Hy he says he said modern day Christianity is a mule it's a hybrid religion so it going to appear to do more than a real amen so that's why you never actually look at someone because I just had a feeling oh you think now I'm getting all legalistic remember Lot's wife she undid one part of the wood she became a pillar of salt but remember the make believer many times will be more religious than the believer amen a mule can can can can out horse a horse amen so a make believer a message make believer can out message believer you know can can actually out be out Christian a real message believer amen am amen so don't don't NE look at what people do or what they say they do look at the LI go be no when I say look at the life you got to look at more than just well they do this and they do this and they always come to church and they always do this and they do this that's not what I talk about that's not what I'm meaning I mean look at their look at their life how they are with their family hey they have we all have struggles Abraham had struggles amen he didn't he didn't live on the best part of the land he lived up in the desert parts amen they they had struggles but they were Believers you understand and so don't look at how they look at how they live a Believer but I mean but don't say someone's a real believer because they can out you know they can make you look like you're not even in because some people are very good at that hold on hold on don't but then at the same time don't lean too far and say well I need to do anything but what is your what is your what is your you know what is your motive if your motive is I want to be the best Christian I can be in My Own Strength that is actually that is actually a wrong motive amen because Lucifer said I will be like the most high he said I will be like the most high that was his ambition so if someone has the ambition I will personify this message in flesh amen we all want to be like Jesus but there's a big difference between saying I shall be the bride of Christ then Lord You' have made me the bride of Christ because one is actually Antichrist I will be like the most high that was Satan's ambition I will personify this message I will be the word and flesh the problem with that statement is I I will it's not you will he will amen it's not your ability it's his ability amen because if we're you know if we're not careful we'll start to flatulate ourselves by looking at what we don't do amen but we forget God gives Grace amen he understands when you're busy he understands when you're stressed he understands when you're sick he understands when you're tired he doesn't beat you because you're tired that's not the that's not how God operates he understands that but then he also understands when you're lazy amen he just understands in a different way and he may and he also understands when you just make excuses amen I'm trying to I'm trying to keep it down the middle of the road but if it's if it's love if your homeo of is love why do you pray do you pray because you want to feel some great anointing and be have some great big experience or do you pray because you love him amen do you read your B because you want to see you know Eve the reason Eve fell is because she received Satan's wisdom which is actually ahead of the plan of God Amen yeah she actually thirsted for knowledge and that why she fell you'll be like Gods you know between good and evil that was the that was the carrot but it wasn't the stick the stick was death amen so she actually thirsted after something before God was actually willing to reveal it amen so then now we can actually and if you read spoken words The Original Seed I believe it's in there brother Braham speaks about the same danger the church tries to obtain things before it's God season to reveal it and that's why there's been splits in the messages because because Doctrine has been partially revealed then what happens people grab it and they begin to preach it before it becomes fully mature and it causes division because if you look at we are the vine he is the vine we are the branches he's speaking of a grape vine if you pla grapes before they're fully ripe they're bitter they're sour are they not amen so now people have come and they've plucked Revelation before it's become fully mature and they've preached it and what does it cause bitterness sourness division amen why because what happens is man it's always man's ambition to take this and they want to see more than the next man amen it's always been man's ambition instead of waiting for God to reveal it they try and put it all together and it's oh but where the bride of Christ look down through history you've seen last 50 years it's been happening over and over again why because man has been thirsting for knowledge amen well shouldn't it say that we should understand the breadth and the height and the depth of the love of God Amen it says that no man has seen you know you hasn't even entered into the mind of man what God has revealed or has in stored for them that love him but the spirit SE searches out the Deep things of God absolutely so you should seek these things out but if you're seeking it see I don't know if youve I'm sure this is pretty obvious but man uses this as a weapon and he uses this to dominate other men or women amen so he comes along and says this is what I know and he just learns it and he actually uses that to dominate people and brother B he makes a quote and maybe I'm just jumping waye to myself but he makes a quote he says this isn't trying to to God a service without his um um without his will and he speaks about the conditions of the of the uh you know of the church and he says he says here he says and millions of people spend their money and put in great Crusades and churches all went together great auditoriums and great things and great things taking place why did it fail it's because they never know the hour they're living no wonder Jesus stood and in his heart he wept tears down his cheeks he said Jerusalem oh Jerusalem how often will I have hovered you you as a hen would have brooded you stoned every Prophet I sent to you but you would not but now your hour has come can't you Fe feel the Holy Spirit screaming out from you oh United States and the world how off I would have gathered you but you would not now your hour has come your God of Pleasure your god of Filth your Sodom and Gomorrah God that's come among you even our little kids Beetle haircuts and bangs down their faces little pervert starting out our women are gone beyond Redemption our men has become big sissies walking around with little shorts on and acting like a girl and hair hanging down their necks where're sodomites and the fire and the wrath of God waits for for us you'll know and so and so he's saying actually the whole world is in this condition and how does that come into a religious realm man controlling man amen man dominating man that's actually a sodomite condition in the religious realm I know I'm probably using strong words but you take man because you know a minister if he is preaching his own thoughts or you know if he is preaching either his personality or his own thoughts or his motives that is that is actually his own seed amen a minister is meant to be a unic as in it's not he's just a mailman that just gives you mail it's not him writing the mail it's God writing the mail amen it's not his his thoughts his motives his objectives because of it is that's actually man on man that's man controlling man amen man is this okay you got to think about it real deep because if someone if I come with my own thought we we become into that condition amen but if I come with with with with Not My Thoughts not what I'm thinking and God just comes and speaks that's a very different thing that that's when God is actually delivering the male so he's actually saying that we are and so the church world has become this way is because man has taken his own thoughts he's taken this as a weapon look at all the books I've written look at all the years I've studied and they actually use it to try you know and they control people with their own knowledge why because man thirst for knowledge instead of waiting for God to reveal it well does that mean we shouldn't read and and pray and listen to the message you should absolutely do those things God reveal it you got to let God reveal it amen do your Bible studies look into things absolutely but God put it together you understand so so I'm not preaching spiritual ignorance here dig in dig into the resource we have in this age I mean dig into the word dig down until you get something and then refine it up absolutely but don't just don't thirst for knowledge there's a you know there's a big difference between wanting to know and thirsting for knowledge amen because one has the right objective one has the wrong objective and the wrong objective normally is look at me I know more than you amen so now he says so lot lot hung around remember lot was not called like Abraham was called lot was not even part of the picture but lot decided to go with Abraham and the blessing that fell on Abraham fell on lot cuz there came a time where both their herds were too big and their Shepherds were fighting and then so they had to separate so it wasn't only Abraham being blessed it was Lot was being blessed amen so the make believer can be with right with the believer and they can receive the same blessing amen because they're hanging around the real believer but if but the real but but then what defines the two is the real believer has a in their heart this is the end goal I mean they actually know where they're going they know why they're traveling they know why they're walking this way so so so Abraham God called him said get out of your country go to another country I'll give you the land you're going to be the father of many nations so he had that Divine call and then so he went amen but lot just just tagged along he didn't have that Divine call and so it's the same thing today when God comes to you amen leave your country leave and I'm not talking about physical location leave your condition leave leave the world Amen leave the church you were once in leave that place and I'll show you your inheritance am mean I'll take you into a different land that you know nothing about I mean then God called you and you begin to realize there's more to this than I knew amen and you put down your Sunday school literature and the denominational ideas you pick up the inheritance amen and then God begins to transform you as he transforms Abraham Hallelujah and then so that's a big difference Abraham actually knew where he was going and why he was going and and and that's the same thing with the bride in this hour we know why we're walking the way we walk because we've received a Divine call even it's just God saying you're wrong how do you know God's calling you because you something and you just says I know I'm wrong and then you give yourself to him it's not necessar a big thunder and lightning time but there's something in you says I know and then you just surrender your life amen and then you start the journey Hallelujah so the bright and and that's why the Rapture is becoming a greater reality to us I mean the change in the body is becoming a greater reality is because just like Abraham's promise it started off with there's a land that I'm going to give you and then you and then you're going to be father of Nations and it honed it down where God said no you and Sarah are going to have the promised son and he says now look and then now these are the borders of the land you know you going to be the promise was refining itself self all the way down it's the same thing with us you know you know you walk into the prince of God God calls you and then you know you know you're a sinner and you surrender your life and then he picks up that life and then you begin to find out there's a Rapture and then you begin to find out there's a Rapture call and then you recognize I've heard the call and then you actually begin to recognize I am the Rapture cuz I'm going in it Hallelujah so you know there's always but then lot lot did not have that call and that's why it's vital that you know him amen you you got to know you got to know that you're called amen there's something in your a deep calling to the Deep you got to know that there's a deep there amen now so the so Then There came May so lot just went along and received the blessings that fell upon Abraham now I just got on my notes may we never fall into that bracket amen as I said lot could not be born again and become an Abraham but this s of Calvary the make believer can be birthed and be made a real believer amen and then we can see now we can see lot's condition because when they came that separation time Abraham told lot look up and choose where you want to go in the land and I'll just go the different way and so lot looked down and he beheld the plain of Jordan and all the well watered you you know that were all well watered um and this is before God destroyed s Gomorrah so he said I'm going to live there and then but he said then he pitched his tent towards Sodom so then he so he went to the well watered places but then he pitched his tent in such a way that it was facing Sodom and Gomorrah and even even when he did that it says but the men of Sodom were Wicked and sinners before before the Lord exceedingly so Sodom and Gomorrah were already in its condition when lot came and pitched his tent towards it yeah so unfortunately because Abraham was called lot didn't have what he needed in him to be dragged out of that condition because he started off being separated in the plains and then I don't know how much longer after this he's living in Sodom amen and so the make believer that's why that's why you got to have a real birth Because unless Abraham you know if Abraham did not have the calling he had and did not have the visitations of God that he had he would have ended up in Sodom too he would have because man is man amen whether whether we like it or not oh God has done all this for me unless you've been real change amen I'm so glad for the new birth now so but then it came to him and so maybe maybe he thought you know know remember he was a rich man he had a lot of cattle he had a lot of herds of things but then somehow he thought life in sodum would have been better than life and life out in the fields as a farmer so somehow in his mind he must have reasoned it out maybe I can get a better job down in Sodom maybe I can just help them and and get them to turn from their ways or you know you know he must have he must have reasoned it in some kind of you know maybe I could look after my family in a better way by going down and there but then it came then but then it came to a point where it says in second Peter 2:6 and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them an example unto those that should that that should um that after should live ungodly and delivered just lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked for that righteous man dwelling among them and seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful Deeds so he was actually vexed living in Sodom he was vexed but then the question is now who was he righteous compared to because he wasn't righteous compared to Abraham amen he was a righteous man compared to the sodomites but you see he was in that place but he didn't have what he needed to change them amen he didn't understand the day and hour which he was living in because if he understood the day and hour he would have remained with Abraham amen because there was a time where that city was going to be burned and God himself was going to Vis Abraham and Sarah and they going to have the promised son that was a promise for the age amen so if he really recognized the day he was living in he would never have ended up in Sodom and gomorra he would have stayed up with Abraham and so the place vexed him but he couldn't do anything about it to change them and you see people today are trying to fix the world amen you see people in America they're saying let's save America and we'll make the nation great again and and you know you know especially the conservative right there they're very vexed by the Liberals and they're very vexed by the gay marriage and all these things that have come into the country and that's worldwide there's actually a lot kind of people that are vexed and they're trying to trying to redeem the place trying to make it better but they won't do it and they can't do it amen and sure we should be vexed as well cuz them that seal receive the Seal of God sigh and cry for the Abominations done in the city so we should be vexed about the wrong we should speak about the you against the wrong but we shouldn't let it entangle us amen because he was entang he couldn't get out of Sodom of his own strength you know you read the story The Angel literally grabbed them by their hands and pulled them out the two angels literally grabbed them and pulled them out of the city they were going to stay amen and and and and the fire was about to fall so lot he couldn't he couldn't you know and then you see you see people there as I said they're vexed and that's why be careful what you focus on Amen if you focus on the wrong thing like I you know you know some people get so caught up in you know things like abortion that's a terrible thing of course it is but some people get so fixated on it that's all they see in Life or they see the gay marriage problem they just get so fixated on it that's all they see how wrong the rest of the church world is amen and they just get fixated and they get bitter about life cuz that's all they look at you're looking at the wrong thing if lot looked at the right thing he would have gone up where Abraham was when's mestic coming amen when's the promised son coming Hallelujah he should have been looking at that the promise for the age but because he was a make believer he didn't see the Promise and he didn't I don't think he must not have hung around Abraham long enough or really spoke to him and asked him what's this all about why are we making this road trip amen why didn't he just sit down and say what's this all about I need to know amen he should have done that and if he done that he would not have ended up there I believe that so so he was vexed and he was stuck because because you know lot was sitting by the gate of the city when when the Angels came in and the Gate of the city is very important place in in uh especially in the Old Testament because the Judgment was always at the gate and we can see this with Daniel Daniel and uh Daniel 248 and then uh the king made Daniel a great man and gave him many great gifts and made him rule over the whole province of Babylon and the chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon then Daniel requested of the king and he said Shadrach Meshach and Abednego over the Affairs of the province of Babylon but Daniel sat in in the gate of the king and you can see Absalon when he started his Uprising he went to The City Gate and then he actually caused all the people he said why are you coming here to see the king because of this grievance and this grievance says oh if I was a judge in Israel I'd do things a little bit differently amen and then Boaz when he went to redeem Ruth and Naomi he went and spoke to the elders at the Gate of the city so it was actually an important place so lot wasn't just a Joe average you know in Sodom he was he was the head guy he was one of the leaders of the place that's why he was in the gate so he was a man of great influence but his influence didn't do any good amen even though he wanted it to do good so lot now remember Jesus said remember Lot's wife there's a reason why he said remember Lot's wife and the reason the reason that is so is because Lot's wife she he just had one look back remember here came here came the time where the Angels were going to grab them and pull them out of the city and then the angel said haste thee Escape hither for I cannot do anything till thou be come hither therefore the name of the city was called zoah uh the sun was risen upon the earth when lot entered zoah then the Lord reigned upon s gomor Brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven and he overthrew those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the ground but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt now this this word z z z however you pronounce it the meaning of this remember they were they were people of influence in in in Sodom and Gomorrah they people of influence but this place they escaped to the meaning or the Primitive root of the word is to be small that is to be brought low and it's figuratively to be uh ignorable and that so that's IG n o b e how you pronounce that word and that is to be of of humble origin or social status to be humble amen so they had to flee to a place which was a humble place as actually speaking now that lot and his family had to Humble themselves and bring great people and go and and go down to a humble place you understand they had to Humble themselves not think themselves anything to to escape the fire but then lot Lo uh Lot's wife looked back and Jesus said remember Lot's wife all she had to do you know all she did was look back cuz I told don't look back just run run to that place but she looked back and so this is in this is in Jehovah Gyra part 3 and 62 notice now the so so notice now the word being so important and notice another while we're on it lot Jesus said himself remember Lot's wife if the word isn't so important if reasoning is all right when that angel said to lot and his family go to zor but don't look back and Lot's wife on a little insignificant thing as to turn back and look back but it was contrary to the words you turned to a pillar of salt then you say telling woman about cutting hair wearing clothes God said don't do it you follow the word and lot had no doubt a nice wife but she didn't follow the the Commandments to the word lot Eve was a good woman but she didn't follow the Commandment of the word just reasoned a little with it isn't it reasonable brother Brandon that we should do this I'm an American citizen I have a right to do whatever I want that's my American privilege it's your American privilege but it's not your Christian privilege for by Christian we are a sheep and a sheep ful fits its rights it lays still and let you take away from it all the rights it has but a goat will kick up a storm about it that's right but a sheep ful fits its rights amen so that's why Jesus said remember Lot's wife don't look back amen just run that's all they had to do so lot remember lot escape the fire because of Abraham interceding for him amen and so we we can see people who are you know you know as I said if you I'm not trying to call anyone a lot or a make believer an unbeliever I'm not that's not my interest I'm saying if you feel people in that position you pray for them amen and never come overbearing on people remember Jesus was the meekest lowest person amen and you can only help someone if you actually come underneath them amen you can't say now this is this and this and this and this and this is and look what I know and all they look at look at me that doesn't help anyone amen but if you come underneath them come alongside them amen then you can actually help them you see so Abraham was called lot was not called I just read the scripture and I'll close now remember the righteous so so lot he was vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked but this is such a contrast to Abraham so when when remember God wrote through Peter to write about lot and God wrote through Paul to write about Abraham he says by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive an inheritance obeyed and went out not knowing whether he went and by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwell ding in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the the ears with them of the same promise for he looked for a city which had foundations whose Builder and maker is God through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore sprang there even of one uh and him as good as dead so many as the stars in the sky in multitude and as the sand which are by the sea innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them a far off and were persuaded of them and embrace them and confess that they were strangers and pilgrims in the land for they uh that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from when they came out of they might not have had the opportunity I mean they might have had opportunity to have returned for now they desire a better country that is and Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he has promised them a city that was that was when God was writing about Abraham but then you may say why did Lot's wife turn into a pillar of salt why didn't Sarah be destroyed when she laughed at God in herself amen because because Lot's wife she just un part of the word and she turned into a pillar of salt Sarah doubted the word and she wasn't destroyed why didn't she receive some you know it's because God's grace is so great that if you're part of the Covenant promise amen you may even doubt it amen you may even disbelieve it but God will cause you to believe it eventually that's right amen hallelujah because remember Abraham was called lot wasn't called and if Abraham was called that means Sarah was called amen Lot's wife wasn't called that's why she became a pillar of salt when she doubted amen so if you're part of the promise God will cause you to recognize you're part of the promise because she came to a stage where she judged him faithful that which had promised but before she didn't judge him faithful we're living out here Lot's wife is wearing the greatest Fashions here in SAR they're living it up in the High Life In The City we're out here on the Hills there's no good water our look at the state of our flocks and all the these bad things you know so she thought how's this ever going to happen Abraham are you sure you haven't gone mad look at but then eventually God came and visited her amen remember the revealing of the secrets of the hearts here in Genesis 18 that wasn't for Abraham that was for Sarah amen that wasn't for Abra he already believed but Sarah didn't believe amen how am I going to be what why are you calling me a different name I'm Sarah I'm not Sarah I'm not a princess with God how can I be a princess amen you'll find out one day no doubt Abraham would have thought in his heart why why do I have to call you Abraham what do you mean father of Nations how are you your F you're just Abraham what do you mean call me a different name one day he would have thought one day and then brother said when Abraham was there he knew the visitation was coming and he just kept the spiritual atmosphere around himself and he knew he knew it was coming because Sarah was acting up there was hard in the camp things were going wrong but he says he kept himself in a spiritual atmosphere amen he didn't let those things drag him down into those problems amen and then so he waited and then he saw three men walking Hallelujah then he recognized one was God Amen and then after that meal and then God said where is your wife Sarah she's in the tent behind you you know according to time of life now that's a woman according to time of life you going have the promised son she laughs within herself how can I have the promised son and then God says why did Sarah laugh no I didn't laugh he said yeah you did amen that whole that whole there that whole bit there was for Sarah it wasn't for Abraham but Abraham kept himself in a spiritual atmosphere because he knew his wife needed a visitation amen you may see the same thing because no doubt she would have said why do we have to live up here I'm sick of live 20 5 years you've been telling me about this promise it was so much nicer where we were we're in the because they were from the plains there in there in Iraq M Iraq water well watered Plains and now they're living up on these Hills in Judea or whatever was called 25 years I be look at our cattle why I thought you were a Shepherd you have all these people under you why are we living on this piece of dirt he just kept himself in a spiritual atmosphere amen what a challenge that is and that can be vice versa as well I mean husband what you know but he he knew she needed a visitation and then but then if he responded if he responded you know to her you know shut up woman I'm sick of this I'm Abraham father of Nations God's visited me I'm his Prophet amen would never have happened amen and and that's why we you know things go wrong at home at work your workmates May how's this ever going to happen with you and they get all stressed about it I just think y maybe I'm too relaxed but hey they say you're just too chilled out why should we get stressed about things amen you commit it to God you do your best you don't be you know you you know you know you don't be lazy about it you know Friday at work it's always a stress day but then I realized well it doesn't have to be a stress but everyone has in their mind oh Friday you know everything's going to go wrong and stuff's du and all this stuff I just thought to myself why why do we have to be stressed why do we have to be worked out about you know you know worked up about Friday you don't have to be just because everyone else is you know don't don't go into their realm remember we have something they don't have we actually have the Lord amen and and they all get worked up because they're thinking through this you know you know through the human thinking and sure everything may go wrong it may be a disaster but worry has no virtue faith has virtue amen well why believe because Faith might deliver me or faith might help me what's worry going to do worry causes cancer it causes sickness it causes all kinds of things just forget about it if you've been called just walk with God amen amen we you musicians to come but remember that's the big difference they were divinely LED and they could bear the approach of you know you know you know Abraham could bear their approach of living up in the hills you know having having his flocks not go well you know all those things not go so he could bear their approach cuz he knew the promise was coming am amen amen that's the same thing with us people say you could move here you get a way better job why don't you do this why do you you know Sunday why why do you waste half a Sunday in a place like this you're mad maybe amen but you see you know and you know why do you dress this way it's so hot why do you what you know why are you dressing like this hey sometimes you got to Bear the approach of the word that's right amen you will because if you understand I'm taking a Rapture my God has visited me the god of heavens and earth has come and visited me he says you're part of my elect ones who's leaving this Earth amen amen then you won't get too worried about this stuff who cares if I sweat up a storm I swe up a storm amen who cares if I'm uncomfortable I'm uncomfortable y amen amen doesn't mean you walk around in some big burer saac thing amen but hey you know feel say people look at you say what is wrong with those people we are just pilgrims and strangers amen we have received the promise remember Abraham his whole life his whole life was focused around I'm going to receive the promised son I'm going to have a visitation I'm going to be the father of Nations his whole life was consumed by that thought and he moved his hey he didn't just move down the street he didn't have a plane to get on he had a camel train he had 300 odd armed servants with him you your servants that he armed it wasn't just him and Sarah and lot and his you know wife this was a lot of people moving yes because you have the servants and you have their wives and you have their children amen that's a lot of people 300 there would have been at least okay so if you husband and wife and you have maybe a few kids that's probably nearly a thousand people yeah where are we going road trip this way you know that's that's quite a big thing to do that's not packing the car and driving somewhere and that to find food they can't just go to a BP or a supermarket you know but he was willing to actually take that burden upon himself Amen to actually refocus not just his life all of his servants lives and all these things we're moving this way yes Abraham I'm with you amen it wasn't just a Fly by Night Thing amen but he refocuses life he says I'm going to receive the promised son there's a land that's been given to me amen and that was that side of Calvary how much more this side of Calvary how much more this side of the blood am mean where God doesn't just lead his people but he dwells in his people amen amen because they had overcoming their faith caused them to overcome all their situations and we overcome by our faith as well amen amen amen maybe let's um let's sing uh let's just sing When the Saints Go Marching and I'm a pilgrim and a stranger amen let's just stand shall we whatever you do you say well you just called me a lot today you don't have to stay in that condition that's right amen you can
