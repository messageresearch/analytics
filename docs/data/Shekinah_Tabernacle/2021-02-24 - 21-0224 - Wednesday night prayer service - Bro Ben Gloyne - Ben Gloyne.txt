praise the Lord God bless you trust you feel at home you know we're all one big family around the world aren't we so amen so the scripture here Hebrews 12 and9 uh 12 and 29 for our God is a consuming fire amen amen and we're going to go to Exodus 3 and 1 amen now Moses kept the flock of Jethro's father-in-law could you just turn me down a bit brother Ed please the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to Horeb and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I'll now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I amen let's bow our heads in the word of prayer tonight you have a need on your heart you just lift your hand hands to the Lord in his presence Lord Jesus you see the hands that have been raised and I'm so thankful that Lord we lift our hands to you Lord you are our source of strength you're our source of comfort you're a strong and mighty tower that we run into and is safe you're our shield and our buckler you're our high priest you're our sin offering Lord You're our all in all you're our husband you're our

have your way in Lord in every case may you be glorified Lord when everything's said and done may we just say the Lord Jesus V visited us this night Grant it Lord we invite you here will you come For Your Glory we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats tonight I'd just like to take a uh bit of a short thought thought here about being called to be set a flame now a call there's a reason behind a call and a call is uh it actually draws you you're like if I was somewhere or just say you know someone calls your name you're actually if you respond to that call that their voice draws you to where they are and so there's actually a drawing power in a call it's a force and there's a reason why there is that pull and that pull is that God would call us to set us a flame you know we're not here to just go through the motions of church or a religion this is not religion this is not even nominal Christianity whatever you want to put put it in some kind of box it's not some kind of religion this is God calling but he wants to call us to set us a lame he wants us to be on fire not in our own human ability but it's his holy fire in us so it says in uh Matthew 2 here it says when he arose he took the young child this is Joseph after he had the dream uh where where uh the angel came to and said you can now return back to the promised land he was in Egypt uh and he took the young child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt and there and was there until the death of Herod that it might be fulfilled which is spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying out of Egypt have I called my son so there was a call you know Christianity real the message is not a push amen it's not a forcing it's not a driving it's a pull Amen brother BR spoke about three pulls each one had a pull the third one has a pull that'll pull a bride into the presence of Jesus Christ and that's when the word comes open there's a drawing Jesus even said of himself he says when I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me so there's a pull there's a there's actually a force I say if the word the word should be the thing that pulls us it shouldn't be just fellowship or a church or something you do on a Wednesday and a Sunday there should be a pull towards the Lord Jesus Christ now we know that scripture repeats itself there's actually cycle prophecies come around again and and and it has compound meaning even even this what we just read about out of Egypt I have called my son that was speaking in the Old Testament of Israel coming out of Egypt but then G uh God was calling his greatest son Jesus out of out of Egypt but there was a call there's a pull and a pull has a force and the word of God is actually the most powerful force upon the Earth yes sir remember his Hallelujah so brother Braham would say in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever how many ministers here knows it history church history and prophecy repeats s at least once or twice true you believe look at Matthew 3 out of Egypt I've called I called my son refer that back and see if it wasn't Jacob that was his son too see history repeats itself so we have been called for a reason Moses if you think about Moses now people in this day and age they took about they talk about how people are raised at a disadvantage based on socioeconomic conditions and there if they have two parents or one or your broken family not broken family how rich poor their family is and they talk about the hindrances that has at people obtaining what they could you at what they could become in life now you take Moses the world was at Moses's fingertips he wasn't raised in a slave's home as an Israelite in Egypt he wasn't at the bottom of the barrel or the bottom of the rung he was actually at in the top he was raised in Pharaoh's Palace so there was nothing that he could not get a hold of when he was in Egypt that's right so there's no hindrance there was nothing you know he was he was raised to be potentially the next Pharaoh in Egypt and he could have been that you know he was raised being being being raised in royalty he would he would have been one of the commanders of the army so he was raised in great military knowledge he had a great experience of you know learning all the wisdom of the Egyptians he had everything there was nothing that hindered you know nothing in in humanity you know it's not like he couldn't go to university cuz he couldn't afford it or he couldn't buy a car cuz he couldn't afford it he couldn't go on holiday cuz he couldn't afford it he could do anything he wanted he was raised in Pharaoh's Palace but there was one thing he lacked and that was the key ingredient of his life and brother Braham says he says go down to Egypt to take over going down to take over a oneman Invasion and the silly party did it why he had fa in the God that he had experienced with God who made the difference now in everyone's life it's God that makes the difference it's not our first birth that makes a difference it's knowing god that makes a difference he is greater than every hindrance or obstacle or hardship or trial God is far greater than all those things and he makes the difference amen he didn't need his military training he didn't need his scholarships he needed an experience and the burning bush had what Moses lacked now that word lacked means you basically don't have it if you lack something it's not in your possession it's not yours you're lacking it so everything he had actually it wasn't how he was raised that feet uh uh fit that thing he lacked it was the burning bush had what Moses lacked and it was the main thing now you think about Moses you think about the Egypt could not could not give him what he lacked that's right Pharaoh's Palace could not give him what he lacked all the tutors and the scholarship and the learning could not give what he lacked now this may seem Elementary but I want you to think about it because we can emphasize so much this natural life and sure we should have a career jobs we should plan whatever more buy houses whatever but what we have need of to overcome in this day and age is not in our first birth it's in the pillar of fire amen so now so so all of his scholarship still M left him lacking his position as a prince left him lacking his military training left him lacking and I'll even say his first birth as an Israelite still left him lacking it was the burning bush that was what he needed everything he had need of was in that Pillar of Fire Hallelujah so nothing and his Humanity could stop him getting what he wanted but the thing he needed was in the pillar of Fire the word produces its own life this is in Christ the MYRY God revealed if I just go a bit slow I'm just going to go a bit slow okay so you know the word produces its own life you know sometimes we think that that it has to be a dynamic shouting jumping time for it to be anointed Jesus sat down and taught the people I say that's the most anointed preaching that's ever struck the world the word produces its own life but we know is however God manifests himself praise the Lord now the word produces its own life that Eve swap for personal knowledge see how the church has today through some man's understanding he says Moses had a great understanding of God till he met the burning bush then he saw his failure the burning bush had what Moses lack so he had a great understanding of God and we can have a great understanding of God until we meet God that's right it's good to have an understanding but don't just stay at the understanding meet the god that gives the understanding am amen and then he saw his failure so you know if you really want to see the failure in your life that we have need of in your life get into the presence of God yeah amen because it's good because God doesn't reveal uh what we would call a flaw in our Humanity to just leave that in us and say look you've got a flaw now the reason he exposes something in our lives is we say Lord take this from me mold me and shape me and he'll say sure I'll be waiting for you to ask me the whole time Hallelujah are we not happy about that I thought we'd be real happy he we got the we know the one who can fix us hallelujah doesn't matter what the devil's tried to pour onto us through our upbringing or hardship pain Strife whatever it may be amen but there's something that we we have what we have need of to meet every challenge amen I'm so glad yes now all of now I listed a lot of things before and I'm and and and I'll just go through the list again Egypt couldn't couldn't meet that lack learning couldn't meet it his position as a prince couldn't meet it his military training couldn't meet it and even his first birth as as an Israelite couldn't feel that lack that the pillar of fire had and I may be a bit extreme saying this but all those things I'll say just caused him to backslide and be a runaway Prophet on the back side of the desert because he tried to do it in his own humanity and he miserably failed and there he was for 40 day uh 40 years on the back side of the desert and he basically Al he was ordained to be the deliver deliverer of Israel but he just somehow came to a place in his life said well I might as well forget about that I'm just going to sit here and heard my father-in-law's sheep we must never ever come to that kind of spot in life where we just kind of sit back and say well I guess the victory can never be mine I guess that promise can never be mine I guess I can never be what what God was made me to be we should never think like that you know you may see a lot of opposition in your life just like when the 10 spies 12 Spies rather went into went into the promised land and they said we see Giants Well Caleb just said I see bread Hallelujah he said they're bread to us that's what Caleb said about the cities and the Giants and their armies and their fortifications he says this is just going to be our daily diet bread Hallelujah so you may have a big obstacle a big challenge in your life just call it bread Hallelujah that's what Caleb that you that's the category he put that in so I think that's a good way to be amen man now here was but the thing is with with with with Moses is Moses in spite of all of his failure and is trying to fulfill the promise in his own ability he was living under a promise and God when he ordain something it's going to happen it doesn't matter what the devil tries to do it doesn't matter how much he tries to make it you know many people think it's impossible How could a bride the devil thinks ever come out of my Eden that I've built but God says I'll show you she's going to come and we're marching to Zion that beautiful city of God hallelujah I mean but there he was he was a runaway Prophet but he met God in that Pillar of Fire and he saw it and he said I'm going to turn aside and see why this thing's not burning up because remember fire is a consuming thing amen you give it Fuel and it just burns on hallelujah amen and so there he was and then but then it wasn't just the it wasn't that physical manifestation of the Flames that he needed he needed that voice to speak out to him and that's what we need with this message to hear the voice behind the voice I me to see it's not a Kian speaking 1100 odd sermons this is not just a different move of Christianity or something that people think is control or conservative or whatever it may be this is not that this is the call of God but he calls us that we'll be set a flame so there was there was Moses one moment a backslid and Prophet run away just hiding On The Backs side of the desert but he met the pillar of fire and that and the voice boot said I have come down I've heard the Cry of my people that's why it's good to cry to God that's why it's good you may feel frustrated anger at the Devil just call out to God with that frustration and anger hmon just you know hmon was exposed by the voice of Esther it wasn't the king working it out it wasn't the guards in the palace it was actually a voice of a woman saying this man this wicked man hmon is trying to kill me and all my people we need to open our mouth and say the devil's on my case he's trying to destroy me he's trying to destroy my family amen and the reason that we should do that is because God gets mad Hallelujah that wrath of God we we better turn that wrath against the devil it's a good place to turn it on hallelujah oh but that's judging the Bible says judge righteous judgment yes you know I wish I had a picture of it but there was a meme where where it had Matthew 7 just like in a as like a screenshot you know from a from a phone and then it's just got judge not and then all the rest of the verses just scribbled out and said that's modern day Christianity that's true don't judge that's what the devil says Don't Judge Me no he's judged Jesus says the prince of this you the prince of this world has been judged Hallelujah so we should turn the wrath of God against the devil amen you know Hallelujah the lord loves you and I amen thank you do you know that he loves you and I we're accepted in the Beloved the punishment we should have taken Jesus Took on Calvary for you and I he already took our judgment he already took our punishment hallelujah amen God is not mad at you and I we may disappoint him and but but he'll put us back on the road sure he might correct Us in some kind of way but it's for our good but he's not M he's not waiting to just push a button the trap door opens and you go to hell that's not what he's waiting that's not our God hallelujah but our God is full of Wrath but it's going to be sent against his enemies and the enemy of the Bride is the enemy of God so if the devil's your enemy he's God's enemy amen hallelujah brother Braham says and not quite does not quite verbatim but he says you know the devil better be careful if he comes against one of God's children CU he's got Jesus Christ on his hands Hallelujah amen amen so Moses Moses was ordained by prophecy to do a job we know that Abraham was was uh he was given a promise by God that that his seed was going to sojourn in a Strange Land 400 years I know you know this very well but we just going to go through you know you know go through it one more time you know seed would so journ and a strange 400 years they're going to be afflicted but then I'll I'm going to bring them out with a mighty hand with great substance and so when God was speaking that to Abraham though Moses is was not mentioned to Abraham and God's mind Moses was part of that prophecy and so there was a call the reason that God spoke to him in that burning bush is because there's a call for him to fulfill the next part of the Scripture it wasn't just for him to have a religious experience but there's another part of the scripture to be fulfilled you know who knows who knows that some of this is history some of this is current and some of this is future right and the call call of God the call of God is not to make us historians the call of God is that we are ordained or we're called to fulfill the next part that is the great thing that you're called not to you know anyone in this day and age can say God sent a prophet even the even the Pentecostal charismatic realm that they they discuss brother bam seven major Visions on the internet they can see the first ones are fulfilled they're talking about what's just happened in America and the they're talking about the driverless cars so a lot of people more than what the critics like to think a lot of people know about this message and they discuss it and there and and a lot of them are looking the anointing that was on William brandham it's going to return again I say it already has am mean because that same anointing on him is on the bride Hallelujah just like the same anointing that was on Elijah fell upon Elisha yes sir Hallelujah that same Mighty Angel is now in a bride in a amen multi membered body amen so it's easy to gather around history but we're not here to gather around history we have been called if this is all you get out of this service you say what's the what's the will of God for my life you've been called to fulfill the next part of the word hallelujah Moses you think about the impossibility that Moses in his Humanity faced 8-year-old man no Army behind him one man Invasion that was his job imagine going through the Customs gate I've probably said this before as well purpose of visit fills out the form holiday can't tick that one business yeah I guess he could tick that one visiting relatives yes you know other Invasion or Deliverance or you and then the custom guy looks at that looks at his passport go stamps and pass it thinks what a crazy man do you have anything to declare I'll just call it a stick it was a rod of Deliverance he is packing God's Rod of Deliverance he couldn't wait is it a firearm no you didn't fit in that kind of you anyway but you know they probably thought maybe what a crazy man in this Humanity that was crazy one spear could have endered the whole thing one God could have taken his head off done done and dtin but because he was set a flame by the word that he was ordained to fulfill he was built for the job I mean he went down one man Invasion he fulfilled that word hallelujah amen he came down he said to Pharaoh let my people go and Pharaoh eventually had to let his people go you know he plagued Pharaoh's Kingdom until Pharaoh had to consent Hallelujah it should be the same thing with you and I we should plague the devil's Kingdom amen we should lift our loved ones in prayer Hallelujah we should torment the devil in that way then eventually the devil says well I just have to let them go brother Braham says I think in total Deliverance you can pray in such a way till the devil has to let them go Hallelujah because what was the first sign that Moses did he took this staff he threw it down in Pharaoh's presence we know Cobra represented Pharaoh was on his crown that he had you know and God was telling the devil and Pharaoh I can loose you and I can bind you cuz he loosed it turned into a snake picked it up it was a you you know a stick again and he was telling the devil I can loose you I can bind you I'm on a mission to F fulfill God's word so you better get out of my way and what power's being put in our lives right now and the power of our tongue not to carry a stick around but in the power of the spoken word that's in you and I right now we can bind the devil we can loose the devil we can bind them we can loose them he doesn't come and say can you bind me now you know how about I do this for you no no you can bind them you can loose them it's in the power of your voice Hallelujah so he took Israel out because he was sent a flame now Caleb and there was a lot of people that were called Caleb and Joshua were part of that group you know I've been thinking quite often people get caught up with what other people have done amen and Peter said to Jesus about you know cuz one of the disciples would not taste death till he sees the kingdom come and all these things or you know and then Jesus just said to Peter real simply what is it to you yeah follow me what is it to thee about all this stuff follow thou me and that's really like Caleb and Joshua they could say well what about all these other people that didn't go with what is it to them we're following the promise of the day hallelujah hallelujah the Bible would tell us that Jesus knew why he came to the Earth he says for this cause I've come into the world to be the Lamb of God that would take away the sin of the world now in Hebrews 10: 7 this is the NIV version he says then I said here I am it is written about me in the scroll I have come to do thy will uh your will my God pardon me and this in the King James then said I lo I come in the volume of the book that is written of me to do thy will oh God so so he's basically saying it's written about me in here and I've come to fulfill this this is basically the crack of what he said Moses if it was written down that time he could have opened the scroll and pointed to the deliverer going to take out the people out of Egypt and put them in the promis land says I've come to fulfill this this is talking about me and this is why I'm here and this is why this is why God called me is because I'm here to fill the next part hallelujah amen thank you know the scribes and Pharisees as I said before it's easy to gather around history the scribes and Pharisees were doing that who's read that in the New Testament he says we're Moses disciples and the reason they were Moses disciples is because of tradition it was tradition in the in the you know in Israel that Moses was the prophet that wrote the first five books of the Bible and they had the Psalms and the different prophets but they were the one that followed Moses Moses gave the law so by tradition they were Believers or disciples in Moses but it was not out of Revelation it was just out of tradition and Jesus would even say to themo not think that I accuse you to the father there is one that accuse you even Moses in whom ye trust for had you believed Moses you would have believed me for he wrote Of Me amen but if you believe not his writings how shall ye believe my words see they were gathered around God sent a prophet and they were caught up in Moses the man but they didn't pay heed to what Moses actually taught because if they paid heed to what Moses taught they would have believed Jesus and then it's a and then I can say that it's because they because if you look at the Pharisees they added hundreds of man-made laws and Creeds and dogmas to the law of what he said if they really believed Moses they wouldn't have been adding stuff but they added stuff and they Justified their walk with God by what they added you know it was a strange thing for the Apostle Paul to go by scripture alone in his day it was a strange thing because they had all their midrash and all their Creeds and dogmas what the rabbis taught and all these things and you know but if they really believe Moses they would never have added those things and it's the same thing it's easy to say and believe yes God sent a prophet in this day you even look at the World War II post postor War to Healing Revival that the ministry of brother Bram initiated it's all there church historians say that his ministry was the spare head it's easy to to to say as a historical fact that is true and I'm not trying to do away with that no not at all but what can be done is it just is reduced down to information or that sermon he preached information or this series he preached information it's not information it's Jesus Christ revealing himself and he's called the people to a word to set them a flame because you know our God is a consuming fire yes sir so he is here to consume certain parts of ourselves that need consuming amen hallelujah for us to fulfill the next part of the part of the prophecy now we you know if we just look through the scripture on Mount Carmel God was a consuming fire Elijah would make the challenge he said you call on your God's prophets of Baal I'm just I'm just this not verbatim but I'm just ad liing but we all know the stories really well yes amen I trust for all Bible readers he said you call on the name of your gods and I will call on the name of the Lord and the god that anth by fire let him be God so the true God that answers by fire he's the real one see it goes beyond argument it goes beyond discussion and facts and figures and history and this and this and this no it's got to be the god that answers by fire that one's the real one amen hallelujah well what kind of fire does he does he answer by Holy Ghost Fire amen he says and the god that anth by fire let him be God and all the people answered and said it is well spoken jumping down to verse uh 30 of of First Kings 18 and Elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down why cuz the approach we know an altar is a is an approach to God so that approach to God had fallen into disrepair they had tried to do a man-made way and if you go look at that story there's the priest of Baal they're dancing they're jumping they're shouting and even they try and get in the flesh a little bit more they cut themselves and no doubt sincere people no doubt believing because Baal was the god of fire they believe so no doubt they believe sure he's going to answer by fire otherwise they wouldn't have done it and they put all their heart and their energy into it but not a single not single spark and so he and and so Elijah repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down then the fire and and then then after he had built it and he put the sacrifice on and the wood and the water and all those things he prayed says Lord I've done all this according to your word may all the people know that thou art God and thou has turned their heart back again and then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the sacri burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that that was in the trench and the people said Jehovah the Lord he is God Amen cuz the fire just didn't come down and have a nice Bri you know just didn't do a light searing and make a medium rare kind of offering it burnt up the offering and the wood and the stones and licked up all the all the water and just consumed the whole thing Hallelujah and that's the same thing with you and I now you say well what kind of altar do we fall upon God gives us Revelations they stones and the reason he gives us re revelations in his word is not that we would oh I know this and I know that and I know how this goes together this no no that's not the reason the reason he reveals himself in his word is that you lay yourself upon that Revelation and the fire of God Burns you up amen I trust that's not forign to you and I this is not a lecture theater I've never seen I've never seen a lecture dance around like sometimes we do up here I've sat in maybe too many lectures in my lifetime at University but I've never seen anyone do this right this is not a lecture theater amen a revelation is a stone you got to put those Revelations together then present yourself as a Living Sacrifice on top of it you say well how does that work well repentance is a revelation repentance is not because you get caught I'm sorry I didn't mean to do that actually you did cuz you did it you know so repenting is not because you get busted that's just cuz you get busted right that's not real repentance real repentance is when the Lord moves on your heart it's it's the goodness of God that leads you to repentance and it's that repentance is actually you actually have a Godly sorrow you're genuinely upset Lord take this Faller nature that I have that's caused me to do these things and turn it to you know that's no longer that way and that all it wants is to serve you actually turn from your sin and walk the other way that's that's a revelation even even though brother R says you don't need a revelation to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'll say to really be be be be buried in his name and come forth in uness of not life that actually needs a revelation but to go through the ACT you don't need the Revelation do you understand because if you really have that Revelation I got to be buried in his name Hallelujah buried with him and baptism I come forth a newness of Life all those things are done that will fall on the Altar and be burnt up Hallelujah Jus you know we're here to be living sacrifices and all that's to be done and and and if you really look at the word the word is not disconnected things it's all Jesus Christ you know before you meet the Lord some people they say well here's the Thunders and here's the seals and here's the godhead and here's the church ages and this is how I should conduct myself it's all it's all unrelated things but when but when you meet the Lord you just see one person you see the Lord Jesus Christ and everything hallelujah hallelujah amen if he ever was if he ever was a consuming fire he still is a consuming fire right and he's here to consume up our first nature that we were born with he's here to burn it up amen so he's here to burn out all our sin to burn out all our indifference yes sir to burn burn out all our backbiting to burn out just using church as some background music somewhere to burn out our fussing to burn out all our P parties to burn out all of our pride to burn out all of our depression to burn out all of our unbelief to burn out our old nature to burn out our unforgiveness to burn out our stubborn nature to burn out our own will that we're born with to burn out all of our prejudice to burn out all of our Superstition to burn out all of our malice to burn out all of our Strife all of our fear all of our trouble in the home to burn it all out that's why he's here I just made a list he's here to burn out a lot of things that's what but you've got to put the fuel in the fire for it to burn right so if you don't put that in the fire well how do I put those things in the fire you say you going to be willing Lord burn it out of me am I don't want this thinging anymore you know the devil loves to make us think we own things you know spirits and things come along and and and they make us think a certain way but it never tells you this is how I think thinking I'm a spirit and here I'm just going to put these thoughts in your mind and this is how this is just my thoughts and not your thoughts no he comes along and makes you think this is how you should think he said to burn that out God's had to burn that out our God is a consuming fire Isaiah needed a cleansing one day after he saw the failure of the king king Uzziah was an incredible King but he got his heart got lifted up and pride because God blessed him to such a degree he thought he could do anything and never have any trouble and so decided I'm going to be a priest so he went into the temple who knows the story who reads the Bible right Hallelujah you know he takes the sensor and he goes to try and be a priest and the priests come in behind him say King you're not this is not your office you're a great king but you're never meant to be a priest and and he just thought I'm going to do it anyway and so he goes in goes to offer the incense whatever he was doing and he was struck with Leprosy and he had to run out and he was and he and he died a leper that's why we've got to stay in our calling but you see this this shook the prophet Isaiah because he leaned on the arm of that King and so he went into the temple now this is always the best place when things go wrong the best place to go is into the presence of God when things go wrong he's my source of strength he should be our source of strength amen YouTube not so much amen you know the news not so much what the neighbor says not so much you know my source of strength My Help Cometh From The Lord amen right Hallelujah and then he saw he saw a visit you know he had a visitation of God himself he saw the Lord high and lifted up in the temple now this is just my little mind but I think you know I don't believe he was the only one in the place that Temple was a busy lot of things were going on a lot of sacrifices priests doing their jobs worshippers coming along you know so Isaiah wasn't the only one there but he had a visitation from God hallelujah so you could be sitting in church and you could see Heaven literally opened up and the person next to you could be sitting there wondering when it's all going to end that's true Hallelujah but he had a real need Hallelujah he had to get the he had to get a hold of God I don't know what he was expecting but God normally gives us greater than we expect amen Glory Hallelujah and and then when he saw this he says woe is me for I'm undone because I'm a man of unclean lips I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the serams unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with tongs from off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this has touched thy lips and thy iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged now a live coal it means a red hot stone so it wasn't it wasn't just a you know a coal it was white hot it was a red hot stone it was burning Hots what happened something that was on fire touched his lips and purged him and took all of his iniquity and sinners you you know sin away Hallelujah that's why a fire came that's why you know we this is not psychology we could spend a lot of time saying what this not is I mean what this isn't but what this is is we need a burning bush experience this is why we come to church as a burning bush because it was more than a physical Bush that was God veiled in a pillar of fire came down and spoke to his Prophet amen and I believe that's why we come to church so we have a burning bush experience Hallelujah you say well I had that years ago you can always have another one that's right H you can always have it again you know you read through the book of Acts they they Reed the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost but they are refilled many times why did they need the refilling because the devil was trying to put things in their Spirit to stop them being Victorious Christians and God just came down and burnt it out Hallelujah that's why we need a burning out it's not because we've done something wrong but many times the devil tries to put something on us to try and disable our walk and stop us being Victorious that's why I said God burn it out of me yes sir Hallelujah whatever the devil would try and put on us put you know put in our spirit realm amen so a red hot coal touches lips something that was on fire Hallelujah brother Ram says in Israel in the church says brother I tell you it means a whole lot more than running up and shaking hands with the preacher a few drops of water sprinkled on you that's right brother it runs a whole lot more than walking up to the Altar and taking communion and walking back and sitting in your seat it means to selling out dying out brother and getting an oldfashioned backwards sky blue sin killing religion that don't wash you white it don't white wash you it washes you white what's a white wash it's just you're painted over it's just like a veneer gets over the top you know what is a you know a message face can be just a whitewash yeah we can play the part we can say the part we can play the role really well but that's just a white wash we need to be wash white on the inside of the inside Hallelujah cleanses you up Burns you out scars you out sterilizes you makes you a new person amen that's old sfas kind brother but I tell you it's it'll stick to your ribs get some of it that's right it'll hold you through the trials amen I feel like shouting pretty near it's pretty big yes sir he said Hallelujah I'm glad we I'm glad that's available amen aren't you glad that's available yes sir Hallelujah now Jeremiah God spoke to him and Jeremiah you know he had a real difficult job no one liked him he never had good news what does the Lord say today Jeremiah repent or perish comes back again what did he say this time what sermons he going to preach doesn't matter where he started where he ended was you better turn from your idols and get rid of them otherwise God's going to destroy you all take you into captivity that's basically his sermons what kind of church would that would that would have been Hallelujah are we happy to be in the house of little today maybe he would ask I don't know how you ask that question you know but but but he had a real hard job but the wonderful thing is the more opposition there is the greater the force of God behind you know combating it because the Lord said greater that is in you that is in the world to us I mean so so the greater sign who's ever done physics or maths or you know the greater than sign so whatever's behind you know the greater sign eats up the smaller well I might get this wrong but you know this one's greater than this one yes Hallelujah so this one can never be greater than this one unless the sign does this but when it comes to God it canot can't do that this is God on this side he's greater than this one am Hallelujah so it doesn't matter the the size of whatever is on this side of the equation it can be the biggest number you can fathom this one is always greater than that one hallelujah oh 200 100 what 200,000,000 demons released from the review fre has never been here on the Earth but now it's here that's still on this side of the equation hallelujah hallelujah one man on this side filled with the Holy Ghost or woman or child is greater than all of Hell Hallelujah brother R would say that that that a child of God that's just been you know made a new creature in Christ for like one second has greater Authority with God than the Archangel that never knew sin Hallelujah you know I don't know how much talking the archangels do but as soon as you start talking to God he says sh hold that thought you know my child's talking to me right now hallelujah amen but Jeremiah had a lot of trouble and he came to a point in his life he says I'm just not going to talk anymore he would say in Jeremiah 28 for since I spake I cried out I cried violence and spoil because the word of the Lord was made a reproach unto me and a derion daily then I said I will not make mention of him nor speak anymore in his name but his word so so that that was his decision but there was a greater force on the inside of his life that couldn't leave him in that kind of state he says but his word was in my heart amen as a burning fire shut up in my bones and I was weary with forbearing and I could not stay so he got weary it was like a he was like a powder Kake a pressure cooker that was building up cuz like fire in his bones he got weary I just Can't Hold This in anymore that's right Hallelujah that's how we should be there should be a goodness like Honey in the Rock just coming amen Glory Hallelujah brother bam says this and earnestly contend for the faith there there's a prayer he says father the best of my knowledge I have told the truth uh and all that I know how to say that that is the truth it's the faith and now Lord Jesus you who so wondrously said these words I'll be with you moving in you to the end of the world won't you come tonight and manifest your Resurrection in the power of deity the power of vision the power of healing the power of forgiveness of sins manifest yourself to us we waiting children hungry hearted we want to see the manifestation of the faith that was once delivered to the Saints no matter how many times you come Lord I still love it I want to see it again and again for I love you I want to be with you forever I thought that sums me up real well yes Hallelujah now the the disciples had a lot of opposition but the one that met Moses in the Burning Bush was the same one that became flesh in Jesus Christ and was the same one that came down into the upper room Hallelujah they came in touch with fire it was a consuming fire it was a holy fire now what was the reason that they came into that is because they were called to be part of the second part of the prophecy you know there was a prophecy about how Jesus would ride on a donkey into Jerusalem it went from prophecy but then it became history right it went from prophecy to history but there was another part of the word that had to be fulfilled is there had to be a resurrection yes and there had to be a people that match that prophecy yes sir when when Joel prophesied and he said I will pour pour out my spirit out upon All Flesh and I young men I may get this mixed up but we all read the Bible we know where I'm talking from you know young men will dream dreams old men will see Visions on my handmaids and my servants I'll pour out my spirit now when God prophesied that through the mouth of Joel he knew the people that he pour himself out upon God did he already had that in his mind he you know God never wonders I wonder who's going to fulfill this you know he doesn't sit there you know watching not that he has a big screen in heaven but like watching watching eating popcorn I wonder how this is going to happen how's it going to happen it's going to happen but how's it going to happen no he knows how it's going to happen and he releases his word in a season that there's a people that are connected with that word that are drawn to that word amen now if I can find a oh here we go and then I won't be too much longer I better not be too much longer I've already late but now but speaks about the Chinese laundrymen he says he says in America he said there' be Chinese who who who used to be laundrymen they didn't speak English and of course the Americans didn't speak Chinese so when someone would bring in some clothes to be washed that'd be that'd be good you know that'd hand it in the Chinese man would take a receipt re rip it in half and give one half to the customer and and he hold the other half and now it wouldn't and and you had to have the parts that marry up if I tried just say if this hanky came in right and I try I you know I decided one day I'm going to get a hanky I'm going to get it from the Chinese laundryman and I came in with a bit of paper that I ripped and said here's for hanky he would pick up the other half and he'd go like this and say no right cuz they don't match right so there's no way I'm going to get the hanky because these don't match but then if I came in with the other half then I received the piece of good yes sir now this is how prophecy this is just this this is just how I see it this is how prophecy is God has one ho he rips it in half one half is the prophecy and the other half is those who will fulfill the prophecy amen and they are made to come together perfectly just like Moses was ordained a deliverer is going to come he was the other half of the prophecy and that's why the Lord spoke to out of the burning bush cuz he was the other part of the prophecy and they had to come together now there were disciples gathered in the first coming of Jesus Christ Jesus came he went by fisherman he went he went to the woman at the well he went to Matthew as a tax collector he went to all the unlikelies of Israel amen glory now if you went to the woman at the well and said do you know that you are the Fulfillment of a prophecy she would look at you say that man has had too much son he's a crazy guy what's he trying to get out of me oh you got a Peter James and John you ask them Peter James and John there's going to come a time where God's going to the messiah's going to come he's on the Earth right now he's going to call a people then he's going to come and dwell he's going to die on the cross for them take all their sins away then he's going to send up into heaven pour His holy spirit Into You The Same Spirit that's in the holy of holies in the temple that was in the days of Solomon is going to dwell in you and you're going to be a living house of the living God he' say well that's something but then but but then he but then you'd ask now Peter James and John who do you think will fulfill that prophecy and they I doubt very much would say I think that's me because these were the fishermen that were literate they weren't they weren't where even the Apostle well Saul was before he became Paul scholar learned men raised up in the synagogue or maybe the next chief priest or high priest or you know the people that people would consider they're the ones to fulfill the prophecy now I'm going to jump from here to there and back again you would never think the woman at the well in her state would be one of the 120 in the upper room you wouldn't consider her would you Peter James Peter is the spokesman you know you're you're on the day of Pentecost here's a guy who tries to kill a guy with a sword attempted murderer who says he you know he'll never deny his you you know the one who he believes is the Messiah denies him three times curses while doing it fails miserably tries to go back to his old life fishing fails at that you know but there's something about the other part of the prophecy that when the Lord comes near they just want to go into his presence you know CU at the rising of the sun they hear a voice from The Shore Bank saying have you caught any fish I doubt very much Peter said Hallelujah none we've been fishing all day thank you for asking none haven't got any you know I doubt he was very happy about put yourself there you know these are people like you and I I've never seen a happy fisherman after all night fishing coming back with nothing skipping and dancing and saying well that was a great time you know and but then John had a look again said and told Peter it's the Lord and Peter doesn't worry about anything else he just jumps into the sea swims to where he is gets out on the bank he doesn't know if he's going to be received but there's something about that part of the prophecy that when it comes together with the other part of the prophecy it doesn't know how it be received but it'll come anyway and there's something with you and I trust I'm coming Lord Jesus anyway I don't know if I'll be cast out I don't know if be made fun of don't know if I'll be even accepted but here Lord Jesus I come Hallelujah and then Jesus asked him do you love me he asked him three times you know and then Peter answers at the end of it you know I love you anyway the ones who are to fulfill the prophecy naturally look like the most unlikely bunch of people glory amen and and here okay so now we want to jump from here to now this is the second coming of Christ sir there's a prophecy that there'll be people alive and remain right there's a Rapture and there's a people that are ordained to fulfill the prophecy you know when Paul was inspired to write first Thessalonians I believe God in his mind thought of you and I hallelujah amen he knew he knew when it would happen God did and knew who was going to take that rapture God did so when that was inspired to Paul he said you're the matching part and so this is why this message has called you and I I pray you've been called I pray this is more than a religion and this is what Mommy and Daddy do but there's a call in your heart there's a longing hallelujah what is that you've been called to fulfill the other part of the word not look back into history and say yes that's history but what's going to be fulfilled next it's the coming of the Lord hallelujah so here they are here we are are here he say here I am I'm here to fulfill the next part of the scripture and that's why that's why I've been called hallelujah it's because I'm here to fulfill the next part of the prophecy and I said I go back here and come back again but what I think I just leave it there he say what gives me purpose in life that should give you purpose in life Joseph was gripped by two dreams yes sir his whole life was gripped by those two dreams didn't matter if he was in prison or what kind of prison a slave whatever more his whole life was focused around that because he was part of a prophecy he didn't know he was part of that prophecy that Abraham was given that I told you about Moses Joseph was part of that prophecy because they had to go down and a Strange Land be there 400 years how' they get down there initially by Joseph that's right that's why this message I trust has called you here's the word here's the people ordained and something in you says It just fits me so so well hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen now we're going to have a time of prayer I know our time is gone but let's just let's just stand shall we um amen let's um actually we have the musicians sorry we'll just sing a song and and then we they have a time of prayer together amen let's just sing it it's the Holy Ghost on Fire and it's keeping me [Music] alive amen is it keeping you alive today oh yes what's sustaining you the Holy Ghost amen Jesus is keeping me alive amen what key should we be in I don't know how to sing any key so anyway anyway it's the Holy Ghost and Fire and it's keeping me alive yes keeping me alive o keeping me alive oh it's the Holy Ghost and Fire and it's keeping me alive yes Jesus is keeping me alive oh hallelujah

whatever you have need of let's just pray together gracious heavenly father we thank you Lord we can come to you this night oh Lord just to than Lord Jesus I I I just pray that this little thought oh God is that you have a people that are ordained to match the prophecy of the day oh Lord may it anchor into our hearts realize e
