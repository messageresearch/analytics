bless you amen hope you have a real blessed day tomorrow amen great to have all the visitors song specials great to see everyone here god bless you thank you musicians amen praise the lord i believe we're gonna have a great time this morning amen hallelujah amen so let's go to the book of mark amen and let's go to uh chapter four we're going to read verses 35 to 41 then we're going to go to luke chapter 8. it's actually a continuation of the um same same account so mark 4 and 35. hey man says i mean who's happy to be a christian today just everyone's happy to be a christian i'm pretty happy to be a christian amen praise the lord today so verse 35 and the same day when even was come he saith unto them let us pass over onto the other side and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there were also with them other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and say unto master carest thou not that we perish so basically don't you care lord they're in this situation and he arose and rebuked the wind and the sea and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are ye so fearful how is it that ye have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said to one another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey him i'm going to go to luke chapter 8 and verse 40. this is when he has uh the lord is returned he goes over to gatoria uh sets legion free and then he returns back and this is uh this is waiting him on the seashore as he comes back so luke 8 and 40 and it came to pass that when jesus was returned the people gladly received him for they were waiting for him and behold there was a man named jarius and he was a ruler of the synagogue and fell down at jesus feet and besought him that he would come into his house for he had uh for he had only one daughter about 12 years of age and she lay a dying but as he went the people thronged him i mean this our heads are word of prayer we want to remember brother umph who's not well today uh anyone else has a need on their hearts you know lift your hands to the lord aren't you glad that there is a river that flows from deep within there is a fountain that cleans us from all sin we can come to this water and drink freely gracious heavenly father i'm so glad lord that that day on calvary lord you answered the sin question forever lord you conquered hell death in the grave lord jesus you bridge the chasm between god and man lord that we can freely come into your presence we can we can lift our petitions before your throne of grace lord as the apostle paul told us to come boldly before the throne of grace lord by your precious blood would come not by any works we have done but by thy grace and grace alone dear god we thank you we can come into your presence lord and lord eva even before we ever had a burden or a need on our hearts you knew all about it and i want to thank you lord you are the solution to every problem dear god every burden is lifted at calvary lord we just need to take them there and place them at your feet lord and walk on free and happy dear god we want to lift brother upon your presence by prayer father he's unwell in body but i want to thank you that by your stripes he's already healed you are the lord god that heals all our diseases so father i pray to god may he reach down into his home lord may he touch his body o god may may you set him free of this affliction lord for your glory we thank you lord we're claiming his healing oh god and also we want to remember brother andy says the brahman the clifford family on the west coast today lord they're having a meeting there lord jesus with sister florida lord their family lord and brother orphy lord i pray father there'll be such an igniting of faith father may you just drop down to that little service oh god or may you just do the supernatural lord father may your presence go forth oh god may bless the service there and lord your bride around the world may just fill it with your presence once again father touch lives heal the sick raise the dead lord bring in sinners lord may they become saved oh god father may you bring the wayward back oh god bring the prodigals home lord may you grant it for your glory we thank you lord that we could read your word lord but we need you the great author to come and lord and anoint it to our hearts oh god so may come and make your word live one more time lord we invite you here into this little meeting may have your way we love you we thank you for this opportunity to worship and freedom we praise you for it lord in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning i'd like to if i could title this i'd like to talk about don't miss your blessing during the trial it's amazing how you know we can be so caught up in what our five senses declare but brother braham tells us in the same church age and if you want to read on about god's elective love and things it's it's it's a very good chapter of the church age book to read but he says the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval neither are bright skies and still water signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us oh yes but how do we know we know because he said so and the and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit placing us as sons and how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass hallelujah so this is how we should be we should always conduct ourselves with joy in every trial you know it's amazing how we read there were you know mark where the disciples are traveling on you know to the other side and you know they only waited until the ship became full they're about to sink they're on that crucial moment of they were going to drown then they wake the master wouldn't it be good to bypass all that trouble just wake him i mean because he's in our ship today i mean we don't need to try and sort out in our own strength get worried and stressed you think about it the very creator of heavens and earth was asleep in the ship with them he wasn't just up in glory somewhere he was right there he was right there and they're in the storm all troubled worried about it but the reason the storm came is god wanted to show i am the resurrection in the life i am the creator of all things i'm in charge of every situation you know i am here in your boat i mean to meet your needs to trouble you know calm every storm but to show my power in the trial that's what he wanted to do to show his power in the trial but many times we miss it we miss the blessing he wants to give us because we're so caught up in me me my my oh poor me this has befallen me instead of waking the master in the ship and letting him come on the scene and take over that's how we should be we should conduct ourselves with joy amidst the trials hallelujah that he has allowed his wisdom to come to pass now it's amazing how if you just take the children of israel when they went through the wilderness you know it wasn't very far long after they had a good old-fashioned pentecostal meeting on the red seashore they saw their enemies were drowned they they realized they were free god had brought them out with a mighty hand and an eighty or your uh 80 80 old ish woman picks up a tambourine miriam begins to dance and all those your women of israel begin to dance they begin to rejoice and moses gets anointed begins to sing the song of moses they begin to shout i mean because they saw that god had defeated their enemy and drowned their past was drowned behind them and they were going on just like the prophet tells us it's like our pastors drowned in the blood of jesus christ our old nature our sin everything held against us is drowned in the blood of jesus christ and we can look back and start shouting and praising god because we're a free people but it didn't take very long for them after that incredible moment to begin to murmur and complain because they were walking according to what they saw but we know the wilderness journey every part of that journey god wanted to prove himself that he was in control he was there for their every need he was there to supply not even just natural blessings and natural you know food and things but spiritual blessings right to reveal himself in those hardships but they begin to murmur and complain you think about it when when moses would be recounting of of of the you know that wilderness journey in deuteronomy he'd say in deuteronomy 1 26 notwithstanding you would not go up but rebelled against the commandment of the lord your god and you murmured in your tents and because because the lord hated us i doubt very much they thought he hated them without dancing on the red seashore that's how god loves us look he brought us through these things but then they begin to because their situation changed see we should have the same kind of attitude always towards god doesn't matter if we're on the hilltop and the valley and the fire and the flood just got the victory we should have the same kind of attitude lord you love me you called me by your word you called me by your grace you brought me to yourself so it doesn't matter what's happening in life hallelujah anyway amen that's how we should be because the lord hated us he has brought us forth out of the land of egypt to deliver us into the hand of the amorites to destroy us and the whole congregation so this is the attitude that that israel had god hates us that's why we're in this problem god doesn't hate god never hated them he says out of egypt i've called my son amen he even says i have a scripture here you know that he even picked them up and carried them like a father from egypt into the promised land but they got to a kind of a mindset that well god hates us this way he's come here to destroy us but you know that's what happens when the word is not mixed with faith the apostle paul would say in hebrews 4 he'd say for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them speaking of the children of israel in the wilderness but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it so they heard it but it was just information to them it didn't anchor down into their hearts by faith and so what was happening now is that when every time the situation got bad they begin to murmur and complain but those who really believe the word like caleb and joshua you know we're the caleb and joshua outfit brother ram says we're going to go possess every promise right the word was mixed with faith and their faith overcame every problem now as i said on wednesday i'm just going to repeat the same quote brother brown speaking perseverance and he's and he's and he's relating the story of the woman from mexico that had the dead baby but she got past all the ushers and the people holding and she got to the prophet for because she believed if she she could just get that man to pray for her baby the baby was going to come back to life he said she was persistent she stayed all day the undertaker's calling for a baby she stayed all day anyhow the usher's trying to keep her out of the line and she stayed anyhow turned down every way but she stayed why she had perseverance why faith caught a hold faith said it's so and faith knows no difficult faith knows no defeat when you've got faith you have perseverance i mean because i was anchored into her heart my baby's gonna live again she wasn't looking at the deadness of the baby the coldness no pulse whatever but she was determined if i can just get my baby to that man of god it was gonna come back to life and because she was it was anchored in her heart it could be so she wasn't wondering she knew and if we could just let our five senses go and take god only at his word faith would anchor into our hearts for every situation amen and we'll walk with god because faith knows no difficult that doesn't mean we'll have no difficulty but your faith doesn't know difficulty sure will have difficulty but faith doesn't know it amen remember faith makes things possible all things are possible to them that believe it doesn't mean it'll make it easy but it'll make things possible just a challenge god see the great challenge has always been can man walk with god in spite of every situation can we trust him through everything can we walk with him i i believe we can that's why he died on calvary to gather people to himself that they can walk with god irrespective of their up they're down the whole church goes this way family's going this way trouble's on every hand but they can walk with god and that's what we're called to be and that's what the lord has made us by his grace but it depends what you're leaning upon israel was leaning upon their five senses and they failed in the wilderness but some of them like caleb and joshua lent upon faith and they were victorious so what are we leaning upon today amen now the apostle paul would say in second corinthians 4 and 16 for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory it doesn't matter what trouble you're going through you're going to put it into this category this is working out for my benefit it is working a far more eternal weight of glory worketh for us far more exceeding an eternal weight of glory i mean so everything the apostle paul went through he classified it as a light affliction but for a moment it had an expiry date it was going to come to an end this was not his eternal state that he was going to be in whether he's in a prison on a ship when it's in a storm he was beaten run out of a city whatever was happening he says this is just a light affliction but is working for me a far more exceeding eternal weight of glory amen he says while we look not at the things which are seen by the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal everyone say temporal that means it's got expiry date that means it's going to come to an end remember every season is not permanent winter is not permanent hallelujah spring is not permanent summer's not you know autumn that's all there's always a change and brother ram says we go through night seasons we go into day seasons but we don't stay in a night season a night season's where everything seems like we're just rocky and everything's going there's trouble and you know about a day season everything's going fine you know we don't stay in those states there's always a change so there will be you're not stuck right we're not called to be stuck the devil thinks you're stuck but yeah even tries to tell you you're stuck in whatever state if you're facing some big big giant but no no you're not stuck the lord wants to take you through hallelujah amen any and then he would say in in the next chapter after he has outlined how we have a theophany body waiting for us in the heavens already he says for we walk by faith and not by sight he was a man and i'm going to go into him later he was a man who went through incredible things he was beaten he was shipwrecked he got bitten by a poisonous snake amen he was rejected he was made fun of he was run out of the city the same people who thought he was a god the next minute stoned him and threw his body outside the city amen he had a lot of trouble in his life but he says none of these things move me hallelujah he wasn't caught up in the current moment he was in i mean but he he knew he had a theophany body waiting for him he knew if the last breath here was the first breath there hallelujah he wasn't moved by any of these troubles though he had a lot of trouble hallelujah why because he walked by faith and not by sight hallelujah he would say in hebrews chapter 12 wherefore seeing we also can pass by about was so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which just so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that has set before us i think that's quite applicable since we're in olympic kind of season you know but look where we can pass about why is so great a cloud of witnesses i tell you if paul can run and overcome we can if arenas could run and overcome we can if timothy could run and overcome we can amen those in the dark ages are burnt to the stake sawn asunder whatever happened if they could overcome if they could look that thing in the faith and say i cannot recant i could not be moved here i stand i cannot change my mind my mind's been made up i've met the lord i'm going into glory doesn't matter what you do to this body i'm going to walk with god if they can overcome amen we can make it too hallelujah if the prophet could stand in an age of trouble and and unbelief and religion amen preach a pure word of god and bring a real baptism of the holy ghost of the church we can stand and overcome too hallelujah if noah could stand in his day we can stand hallelujah amen that's a great cloud of witnesses hallelujah and they're cheering us on you know we're the final runner we're the final voice to the final age i mean there's no other age after this the next stage is a millennium but before that there's a rapture of a church hallelujah and we're here to run this last lap i mean so we should keep our eyes on the finish line amen it's too late to quit it's too late just to you know what i think the biggest nonsense ever is people who hang around the ark thinking the world's got something for me there were people as it was in the days of noah there were people hanging around the ark oh but maybe noah's right but these guys my i just want to see what's out there and you know it's like dark dingy arc i don't really want to go in there and you know my friends are out there you know people say well everyone else is doing it where everyone else drowned so i don't want to be what everyone else is doing i hope you know i have that stings i hope it stings you know but people were hanging around the ark but then the door closed that's okay no we'll open it well god closed it no it didn't close it so i wouldn't hang around and say well i'll see what the world has for me and this no i just get in get into christ as fast as you can and stay in don't go out hallelujah amen that's what i do looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god that's what we should do we're called to run hallelujah you know it's amazing the apostle paul would say in philippians 3 he says but what great things were gained to me those i counted lost for christ yeah doubtless i accounted all things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and to count them but dung that i may win christ so the things that he had to let go of he put them into one category dung that's what he you know there wasn't the oh i love these things but these things are horrible no all the same category he counted them but dung hallelujah where am i here we are yes and and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god of god by faith that i may know him and the and the power of his resurrection now everyone loves that hey we're the anointed bride in the last days all that god was he poured into christ all he poured into christ he's poured into the church i mean we've got overcoming power i mean we've got the power spoken word of creation i mean the god that made heavens and earth dwells in us hallelujah and though this mortal body be you know expire we have one eternal in the heavens waiting for us already amen yeah a believer can't die no more than god can die we love that don't we that's what we sign up for isn't it but that's not all of it that's not the whole package he says and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means i might obtain unto the resurrection of the dead now so we love the power of his resurrection and we also hallelujah but we sign up for the fellowship of his sufferings as well now this word fellowship it means a partnership it means a participation is in the greek so to fellowship and the fellowship of his sufferings isn't just knowing about it as an idea it's experiencing it you participate right it's it's it's to have a communion so to become one with amen is to have a fellowship now sufferings of course it means something that is undergone that is a hardship or a pain it can be an emotion or an influence an affliction it's a suffering so he says that will numb in the power of his resurrection but also the fellowship or the partnership or the participation or the communion of his sufferings so if jesus suffered then the church the bride suffers this is all part of it it's part and parcel we love the we love the baptism of the holy ghost shouting praising god hallelujah god takes over our lives and makes us new creatures but then there is a fellowship of his sufferings and this is the thing that stumbles people how can a god who is full of love and mercy and grace who is so powerful that he could just like this make the devil just be completely annihilated all his works why does he allow his believing children that he is loved with an unfailing love go through hardship but he does you know it's amazing the apostle paul would um you know he'd go into a city for example he says in acts 14. this is this is part of the new testament church imagine we're we're we're we're new believers and he says and when they had preached the gospel to that city and taught many they returned again to lystra and to iconium and antioch confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god so he's saying this faith works there's overcoming power in this faith amen but then we but through great trib through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god so he says this is all part of it there's going to be tribulation you're going to have trouble and maybe sometimes that trouble will be maybe without measure you just can't seem to just you know keep it all together and you seem so overwhelmed by it but through this you're going to enter into the kingdom of god hallelujah you know it's the same today i think some some christians today have the impression that the only kind of atmosphere that god works in is when it's all calm and we have our favorite worship instrumental music playing in the background and we're sitting on our favorite chair with our favorite cup of coffee in our bible in the other and that's how now the atmosphere is right now god can work that's an instagram kind of a christian that's not bible christianity that's not bible christianity that's but but and so people have this idea now now i'm calm they that wait upon the lord and they just weigh and the atmosphere's the lighting everything's just nice and now god can minister to me no not always but that's what people think because they think that you know you're gonna be calm no it's in great trial and struggle and where god it's like you're on a knife edge you're gonna lose it all or gain it all those kind of situations that's when god comes on the scene but if we think he's just works in a certain way we miss how he really works and we misunderstand what we're going through and we think how can god ever meet me in this mess well actually god meets people in mess that's where he meets so and then because of this and then um and and and it can only be that certain way and then if it's not then something's wrong and it just can't be god and if we have that attitude we can miss our moment because we begin to question why which can lead us to blaming god for our trouble that's because what does the devil try and do he tries to whisper in your ear that you get on his team and blame god remember he's the accuser of the brethren he thinks that god is not big enough he can't save he can't redeem he can't gather a people he can't make a people love him and what does he do tries to whisper in urea to try and join him in agreement with the devil oh god really loves you why are you going through this why is this happening why is this person oh you know it's and it's all god's fault because we're never wrong we're just a victim of circumstance are we amen god is always right god is always correct god is never wrong he's never partially wrong he's always right he's not even partially right he's completely right all the time i mean so we must never get angry or upset at god amen you know the children of israel god brought us out here this is god's fault this is why i'm hungry that's why this is why we're thirsty this is why we're in this desert it's god's fault it's his it's his fault no it's not the word wasn't mixed with faith you see driest driest's life here is a perfect example of god stepping into trouble to reveal himself brother bram says in raising driest's daughter remember jesus had gone to the other side to get one soul he went through a big storm to get the maniac in the tombs but now we had to come back again and dreist was waiting for jesus to return because he was a secret believer he knew that he knew that jesus could heal his daughter but jesus had gone away somewhere but he was coming back you could imagine the feeling when you see maybe just to dramatize it a bit maybe it's before dawn driest is there waiting at the dock and he begins to see the disciples ship that he saw sailing that way returning imagine the you know he has this burden of his daughter who's slowly getting worse and worse and worse and all the doctors can't help all the prayers he's lifted to god haven't haven't haven't haven't helped well the answer is coming but the way he thinks would help you know his doc you know his daughter's getting worse but he sees the discipleship coming to the dock imagine now the joy that i've been raising in his heart the answer's on its way hallelujah the answer's on its way amen then he begin to see i'll drive thought if i could only see him now i will express oh what will i do i'll lose my jobs he had to wrestle it out he had to be willing to forsake all and lose his church losers standing in the community to actually invite jesus into his house and that's how we should be as well don't worry about your friends god will take care of your friends don't worry about your standing who cares about it i'd rather just walk with god now and then he says he says what will i do maybe i better not go he walked in and looked at the little girl she's almost gone what had happened right down in his heart so he's looking at his seat we think that god moves when there's no trouble sometimes right she's almost gone what had happened right down in his heart god began to work jesus a driest this is your time you know god gets christ's division and god works on both ends of the line see so god is saying so dry god is bringing this situation into his life because this was jarius's time if he if he began to question god and get mad at him he would have missed his moment and his daughter would have died and stayed dead but because god was working in this great time of trouble he says this is your time many times you know we can't miss our blessing in the trial he says dries this is your time this time was the greatest crisis that ever struck his house but it but but it had struck and it caused a secret believer to come and openly invite the lord jesus to his house and he says this isn't this isn't the same other than raising driest his daughter against you so dryas got the feeling pretty good after he met jesus went walking along he said now i've got a real hope my girl's going to be all right have you ever been in this kind of situation you know you have the answer with you jesus in the ship right and you're on your way to see him fulfill his word but then but then greater trouble strikes he says he says i've got a real hope now my girl's going to be all right yep he will go in there and he'll minister some way he will lay his hands on her and the first thing you know that girl will start getting better she'll get all right yes sir what did he have a preconceived idea this is what jesus is going to do how many times do we pray for things we have in our mind this is how god's going to do it this is how god's going to save this person's how god's going to bring this person in this is how i'm going to get healed this is how i'm going to you know and we have this preconceived idea god goes beyond preconceived idea you know we think it's going to be a certain you know we're like god's project manager and today you're going to do this and then you're going to do this and this person's going to say this and this is going to no no god's his own project manager he will bring to pass his word how he sees it should come to pass right and we have to trust him however it's happening hallelujah amen so so he thinks you know i've got real hope now jesus is with me this is how it's going to happen he's going to lay his hands on her and she's going to start getting better and he and he make himself believe that pushing right along with the crowd feeling pretty good what was happening his mental faith was being worked up who's this coming here comes a man usually a message of sorrow they had ashes on their heads imagine drastic you know jesus is with them it's going to be okay his house is just around the corner down that alley but then a man comes running covered in ashes crying broken upset and he comes into this and they come running here he had i wonder what's happened up the street wonder what's taking place and here comes this runner said drast do you know me this is the man with the ashes on his head all upset and dry says yes trouble not the master anymore dries and dry says oh why oh why what's happened your daughter's already dead don't trouble him oh i can see him just go back down just start at just as he starts to sink like peter did he turns his eyes now this is the secret imagine if he just jesus you came too late you should have been here yesterday if you were here yesterday as i thought you would have been here she wouldn't have died and got angry with god no no god's gonna display his power in the trial he wasn't willing to let his own emotion and how he felt what god should do override what god was gonna do if he did that he would have missed the blessing now and then so he turns he turns his eyes to see what jesus is going to say about it why don't you see what he says about it if you say well the world turns me down see what he says about it doctor says i'm going to die see what he says about it see what he says about it so jarius turned his little head to see what jesus said about it i can see those lovely eyes look over to him said fear not only believe thou shall see the glory of god glory that was the word that's what we should do trouble comes in you know a curveball comes something you don't even expect you're blindsided we say see what jesus says about it don't don't don't respond according to your carnality you should respond what jesus what do you say about this situation though i know how shall be saved amen only believe all things are possible holy this is just a light affliction working for your good hallelujah all things work together for them that love god and called according to his purpose amen hallelujah remember our lord jesus has the final say the devil don't have the final say we don't have the final say he has the final say hallelujah now if we could just just just reverse this a bit back to the disciples in the boat during the storm you know that storm was whipped up it caused the disciples to wake jesus in order for the lord to show his power and authority and this is what trials are made to do trials aren't made to wear us down to powder trials are engineered that god will reveal his power during the trial hallelujah so trials are good amen i speak on behalf of everyone here amen many people unfortunately miss the blessing during the trial because their eyes are fixed on the current situation as i said before the lord said he said the lord your god which goeth before you this is speaking of moses addressing the children of israel before they cross the jordan this is deuteronomy 1 again the lord your god which god before you he shall fight for you according to all that he did for you in egypt before your eyes and in the wilderness where thou has seen how that the law thy god bear thee as a man doth bear his son in all the way that they went until he came into this place so this is what god was saying through moses i have actually carried you as a son as a man carries his son i have borne thee from egypt into this place but the people who just walking by the five senses they said what do you mean we've been hungry we've been thirsty we've had trouble you know we we we've drank bitter water there though you know yo mara there we've had all this trouble what do you mean you've bore us he bore them he bore them why because in every step of the journey god wanted to reveal his power i say lord jesus may may may we in every trial say thank you jesus you want to show yourself in this trial to me just like i i well i think i haven't said it recently but brother tim dodd said when his first wife passed away he said lord help me to look around as i walk through this trial because i may never walk through this trial again teach me what you want to teach me during this trial because remember some trials we go again and again and again because until eventually we see god's hand in it but some trials are very unique there may be one kind of a situation in life i said lord teach me in that situation teach me something because i may never walk through it again life is meant to be a guided tour the lord is the guide and we're on a tour we came from god go back to god that's a tour right this is not our fixed abode but if it's going to be a guided tour we need to listen to the guide which is the word we need to pay real good attention especially when it gets trouble it gets dark it gets gloomy you don't know which way to go no the guide will show you through but if you get you know but you've got to listen to him if you don't listen to him you'll get lost but you always you know if you call out he'll he'll find you wherever you are hallelujah amen amen brother brown would speak about this and i know speaking about the three hebrew children into the fiery furnace one day down in a great nation under a great bondage they come hebrew children we know as shadrach meshach and abednego and it came to a place where they had to make a decision that something had to be done they had their faith was put to a test and when your faith is put to a test then don't fail stay right with what you believe what do we believe god's in control god will see us through i don't know how he's going to do it but god's going to do it that is the end of it hallelujah amen and when your faith is put to a test i'll just repeat this again then don't fail stay right with what you believe and when their faith was put to a test and they went to a crucial hour not only did they um not only do they go to an ash heap but they went into a fiery furnace but satan could not destroy them for god's purpose wasn't yet fulfilled they could go in there with this hope i know my redeemer liveth they could go in there with this hope here we are assured that god is able to deliver us from this fiery furnace but nevertheless we'll not bow down to the image satan could not could not take them he could not drown noah in the flood until the purpose of god had been finished he could not burn up the hebrew children until the purpose of god had been finished he could not kill job with boils and troubles until the purpose of god had been finished neither could the lions eat daniel until god's purpose had been finished neither could death and old age take abraham until the purpose of god had been finished and neither can it take you or can it take me until the purpose of god of our life is finished so we gather from their consolation and why does god let trouble come god harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with god hallelujah why we got trouble god wants to bring us close to himself hallelujah but if we if we don't see god's hand in the trouble well what are we going to do we're going to miss the blessing we're going to miss what god wants to reveal to us of himself amen i like that god harnesses trouble lord you've harnessed this trouble you've harnessed this sickness you've harnessed this trouble in my family whatever is your harnessing this trouble to bring me into a closer fellowship with you hallelujah you know we think often that if the grace of god has come upon our lives which it has that god will keep us from trouble do we not think that so yeah we you know because we we mistaken and i'll get to it later that we think god's love is like a parental care where god will try and keep us from all harm like we would our children but you know brother makes this statement he says now remember when god has counted you worthy god has counted you worthy when you have a test now don't fail this to get this now when the prophet says sound like that i listen it's like i had a lecturer who didn't give out any um um he didn't give out many handouts but he says now when i repeat something you should write that down he said that and he and he repeated quite a few things so we wrote them down so when the prophet says now i don't fail to get this i'm like lord i don't want to fail to get this when you have a trial or a test it shows the grace of god has found you found you favor with god and god believes you'll stand the test hallelujah so you ever if you're going through a test what's happened that's an evidence that the grace of god has found you and found you worthy amen found you able to overcome hallelujah amen oh life is tough things have gone sideways the grace of god has found me this is why this is going on hallelujah amen i love that amen you found how do you know you found favor with god you're going through a test hallelujah you remember he did the same thing by job amen satan had a well actually god had a testimony meeting with satan about job yeah god loves to testify over his children god loves to actually show us off god's not ashamed of you and i he doesn't try and keep us in the corner hide her away and you know no no satan look at my bride she's beautiful she's spotless i mean she's made in my image there's nothing held against it there's none like her in all the earth just like just like god said about job but he said have you considered my servant job he's a perfect man he was just under the blood of bulls and goats but god would say he's perfect hallelujah he's a perfect man there's none like him in all the earth now if god can look at his servant under the blood of bulls and goats and say he's a perfect man how much more the people under the blood of jesus christ made in the image of god filled with the spirit hallelujah amen you know god loves to testify of us hallelujah that should be us brothers you should yeah you should be real proud of your wives and testify about them amen that's how we should be hallelujah amen he says you know satan says yeah i've seen job down there said he's not and god said he's a perfect servant there's none like him there's nobody like job he's a perfect man my he's my pride and joy now he's just talking about a server now think about his wife amen she's my pride and joy there's no one like her in all the earth she's a perfect woman satan said oh sure he gets everything he asked for he says let me have him once said i'll make him curse you to your very face i'll make him curse you god said he's in your hands but don't you take his life see god had confidence in job amen and when it looks like everything has gone wrong god's giving you a trial he's got confidence in you he don't have to baby you around god doesn't baby us he doesn't put us in cottonwool and you know make sure our feelings don't get hurt and everything's fine and just trying you know how's your mental health doing and you know try and keep us from trouble god doesn't baby us when he commissioned moses and moses gave him through a list of excuses in god's face god didn't baby him god didn't give him some support system outside of himself he says who made the mouth to speak i'll fill your mouth with my word i will go down i've come down to deliver israel i'm sending you to the god who came down to to deliver went and moses to do it amen so if moses could just get his eyes off himself in his eyes on the lord that the lord was his all-sufficiency that the lord was able to do the job and he was the one doing the job amen god didn't have to baby him god doesn't baby us we're rugged christians hallelujah amen he don't have to baby you around you're not a hotbed plant a hybrid you're a real christian god is giving you a test see what you'll do about it amen see god wants god's looking for a response it's easy to say how i love you lord and raise your hands and just get lost and worship and praise god but that's not the only response god's looking for god's looking for a response in everyday life what are you going to say to the situation how are you going to respond to this trouble help us to conduct ourselves the sons and daughters of god that's what i love about brother tim pruitt you know his wife sister karen's had brain bleeds again and you know in hospital but he when he put through a prayer request he said help me to conduct so pray for his wife of course but help me to conduct myself as a son of god during this trial i thought that's a blessed man they even have that kind of a mindset lord help i need prayer that i'll conduct myself because sure he will be you know as a you know that's his queen there that's hanging on death's door sure he'll be worried sure he's upset sure he's concerned but he says lord may those things not override me but i conduct myself as a son of god how do we conduct ourselves the sons of god believe the word of god take every need to god in prayer cast out cares upon him because he cares for us don't get all wallowing in a pity party you know cancel that party uninvite everyone and invite yourself to it don't pity poor me no no god is able and this is for my good i found favor with god and that's why i'm going through this test because he knows i'm gonna make it i'm gonna overcome i'm gonna walk through this and walk out the other side packing the victory hallelujah he's made us to do it this is not on your shoulders it's on god's shoulders but he has confidence in you what are you gonna say in the trial lord i he's able uh he's able i know he's able i know my lord is able to carry me through amen hallelujah god is giving you a test see what you'll do about it amen no wonder peter said these fiery trials why count it a joy it's more precious to you than gold and many times we him and her oh well it's just well it's just something god give you to overcome he knows you'll do it he's put his trust in you see it's one thing for man to put trust in god there's nothing for god to put trust in man that's why he gave you his holy spirit because he has confidence in you that you'll overcome he has faith and confidence in you amen hallelujah this is from the smooth church again he says now the lord god almighty says i know there he is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says i know your tribulation i am not at all unmindful of your suffering remember the disciples response before they woke jesus don't you care that we perish are you not aware of our situation that we're in and you're into don't you care cause he cares his eye is on the sparrow and i know he watches me you think about every sparrow that flies by god sees all of them god says when they're born god sees that they have enough food god sees when they pass from this life and we are worth more than many sparrows we are worth our soul is worth more than ten thousand worlds you can't even put a digits behind that how much it's worth one soul is worth more than ten thousand worlds hallelujah so he is not unmindful of our suffering that's why he even became a man to understand our suffering to understand what it's like to be rejected and hated and despised and spit on and you know cursed and made fun of and all those things he would understand and go through trials and hardship be sick he says what a stumbling block this is to so many people like israel so what's the stumbling block that god knows our tribulation but he doesn't take it from us necessarily that's a stumbling block because i thought he was a god of all love wouldn't he just keep us from it like israel they wonder if god really loves them how can god be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer that's the question isn't how can it be this way this is what they asked in malachi 1 verses 1 to 3 the burden of the word of the lord to israel by malachi i have loved you sad the lord yet you say when has thou loved us was not esau jacob's brother saith the lord yet i loved jacob and i hated esau and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness you see they could not figure out god's love and this is how the devil gets us because we're in our human mind trying to work out god's love and the devil comes along says yes see he doesn't love you the way you think he should love you they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care what's a baby with parental care they never hurt themselves they're out of harm's way they get picked up you know they get they get looked after that's that's parental care right but god said that his love was elective love the proof of his love is election no matter what happened his love is proven truly by the fact that we were chosen unto salvation because god hath chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is sovereign that means that's his choice but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of peace his purpose is after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled who wants to be that amen perfect established strengthened and sealed as job said he put strength in us that's job 23 uh the be part of verse six we you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered hebrews 5 8 and 9. though he were a son yet he learned obedience by things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him in plain language the very character of jesus was perfected by suffering and according to paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in god while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection why did he want this james 1 2 to 4 my brethren cannibal joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have a perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing why does he stand by the reason of this is in romans 8 17 and 18 and of children then heirs ears of god and joint is with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also that we may be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him if he wants to be an overcomer to sit down in his throne as he sat down in his father's throne right unless we so we have to suffer to rain the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift we all want to be like jesus it's a victory not a gift oh but i've got the holy ghost yeah but you've got to keep yourself dead daily that he can grow and take over your life right a man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic but power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame is set down at his father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and a little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what treasures are laid out for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation who are willing to enter into his kingdom through most tribulation are we willing this morning whatever it may be lord i want to enter into your kingdom think it not strange concerning the fiery trials that are to try you now this word strange it actually means something foreign so so don't think it's like a novel foreign thing when you have these fiery trials you know everyone in the world has trials too eh they have hardship too so there's nothing that comes upon us that's not common to man many things are just what's called the grab bag of life you know you just pull something out of the grab bag of life it may be sickness maybe distress trouble whatever but it's just but it's what you do with it when it lays in your lap well this isn't fair no god wants to show his power in this so it's up to you are you willing to go through much tribulation to enter into the kingdom of god this is what peter said it is strange that god wants to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trials we are all tried and chastened as sons not what not one but goes through that the church now listen to this the church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of god hallelujah we get all the stress there's trouble in the church we're being tried well ever well if it was a it was a flowery bed of ease says the prophet tells us we're not of god hallelujah praise the lord i think we're doing good we're off the right track hallelujah why because god has to test that the genuineness of our faith will be tried see real love is not proven when everything's going fine real love is proven when everything's yo stuff's hit the fan there's trouble you know you gotta make decisions you got to lay down your life or pick up that you know either pick up that resentment or lay it down pick up that unbelief or lay it down pick up that pain or lay it down deny yourself pick up your cross and follow him you gotta yeah it's all those kind of decisions amen hebrews 12 6 and 8 for whom the lord loveth he chastised and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth but if you be without chastisement where we're of all our partakers then you are bastards and not sons amen so god's love is elective don't misunderstand the love of god how does it how do i know he loved me because he called me he predestined me for the foundation of the world hallelujah he decided to love me amen before there was anything amen see eventually the disciples woke jesus and i said i think in the beginning why don't we just bypass trying to fix the problem and complaining about the situation and just wake the master i think it's a good way remember they were boatmen they they had basically been born on the sea of galilee they knew how the storms operated you know they knew how the boat worked they probably built the thing but they should have just bypassed all them trying to fix it and just wake the master see the devil always tries to get us at a low point he says brother brahms isn't looking to the unseen uh just as a great um he says people in here this may seem strange to you but but it's not he says satan is always near to try and get something fumbled up in your mind but tonight set your affections on things above where christ sits at the right hand of god and remember the bible says the same yesterday today and forever and if his spirit be he reveals things today as he did in days gone by heavens and earth will pass away but his words shall not pass have faith in god don't doubt it says satan comes in tries to fumble things up in our mind is it true is it not true what have i got to do tomorrow what happened last week with this person he tries to fumble up our mind but he says don't think on those things set your affections on things above he says in raising dries his daughter again now out here on this little old sea tossed about ten thousand devils of the sea swore that drowned him while he was lying back there tired you know the devil takes advantage of you when you get tired of war out who's had that situation you're all feeling good and you're all alert and had good sleep and rest it the devil doesn't really hang around there but it's when you get worn out and tired your nerves get on edge you just need to rest you know you're all this is when he turns up because the devil's a coward he does you the same way you just get a little tired and wore out and get discouraged normally when people are worn out and tired discouragement comes with that sometimes we just got to sit back and say i'm just tired this is why i feel this way certainly he caught jesus right there at that weak spot tried and weary he was laying back there in the back of the boat rocking around and the bible said that the storm came down upon the sea and began to toss the boat the disciples said caress thou not that we perish he said where is your faith looking around in the great winds and waves obeyed him what was he doing crossing a rough sea that night because one soul in gadara was ready to receive him one soul in gadara don't you know that the trouble you may be going through might be you're on your way to one soul that they would meet the lord this is why you're in the storm right now that actually on the other side of the storm is a soul that's crying out and god uses his body to go and get that soul so never ever just look at the you know there's a problem trouble comes words become very internal me me me why why why you know you look at the big picture this is work this light affliction is working a great far more exceeding weight and glory for me and you may not realize that actually when this when you awake the master and he deals with the storm there's a soul on the other side you know if the disciples now we know they couldn't drown and jesus couldn't drown but if you go into that very moment if they didn't wake him up they would have been swimming the boat would have gone down right they had to wake him up call them on the scene we don't want to get caught up in too much of our trials we need remember god puts blitz in trouble's mouth and makes it allow us to have a closer fellowship with god hallelujah but you see the problem is there this this age that we live in um and and i'm trying to come down to a close here the problem with the age that we live in is we are conditioned this age is conditioned to look at the natural blessings and equate them with spiritual blessings he said you know this is the later seeing age that we live in we know that you know people are conditioned to quantify how spiritual or how blessed the believer is based on their material possessions say in revelations 3 and 17 because thou sayest i am rich increase with goods and have need of nothing and knows not that they are wretched miserable poor blind and naked but this age is saying i'm rich increase with goods i have need of nothing i'm self-sufficient i don't need anything this is the way we are even as i said when i first went to papua new guinea i went to a pentecostal church there they were having a bible study no actually a preacher was preaching on this very verse and saying look we're richard and chris with goods and in our mind in the first world no they're not but relatively to where they were a generation ago to where they are now their risk increase with goods but you see they so but they think people think oh god's blessing me because i have all this material things that can be a sign of god's blessing but not not necessarily but if hardship comes and our bank account becomes just a whole bunch of zeros with no number before it you know we think oh god's forsaken me and no i'm in trouble and how's this ever you know going through this trial no no don't acquaint don't don't put on power of natural things with the blessings of god right just because you have no money doesn't mean god hates you or is displeased with you just like doesn't mean if you have a billion dollars suddenly fall into your life that god loves you it doesn't work that way but this age has been conditioned that way that if you're doing prosperity if you're prospering then god is blessing you no not at all but you see what's that basic now everyone's faith is based on what they can see with their five senses look at my bank account it can all go tomorrow you know it wasn't long ago in germany between the world wars that the german mark was you know the valley just dropped out through the bottom and a wheelbarrow of of their money barely bought a loaf of bread you know and it's happened in other countries as well but you know it can be all gone tomorrow oh the new zealand dollar is doing well it can be all gone tomorrow and then where will we be we shouldn't be in despair say praise god holy now lord you really you're still jehovah gyra you provided a meal yesterday you'll provide it today you'll feed me in this great time of trouble this is this is how this should be our attitude hey amen hallelujah amen so this agent forge has been conditioned to think that what we see with our five senses yeah we think praise the lord we've got new you know we've we've got new chairs holy the lord's blessing us and we can be sitting on the floor wouldn't really make any difference you know let's not get caught up with the five senses to see if the lord loves us or not no he said in his word he loves us he sent this message to you and what is it it's a love letter you're my bride come walk with me amen so now but it's amazing the apostle paul now you know the apostle paul was a real person eh he had the same emotional realm like us he had troubles you know but he was a human he wasn't some sometimes we take the heroes of faith we place them on some big pedestal up here and think they're super human they weren't superhuman they were like us the bible says that elijah was a man of like passion so he was like us right the woman in the bible too you know they're all so the apostle paul you would think here he is he's now sitting this is the book of philippians he never ever had a pity party he never ever felt sorry for himself he never questioned god why he never did he would say in philippians 1 and 12 this is the time and where one time when he was in uh in prison i would say you should understand brethren that the things which happen unto me have fallen out rather until the furtherance which is the progress or advancement of the gospel so so that my bonds in christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places so he's saying i'm in prison but this actually worked out for the furtherance of the gospel why because he was such a living witness that actually advanced the gospel now if you look at his current state he's in prison how is that yo he's down and out obviously god has turned us back from because look god said he'll fight our battles deliver us from our enemy you know we'll be overcoming all these things and but the man's in prison he's going to be the first church age messenger he's in prison but that's a natural eye but spiritually he's saying brethren you need to realize this is actually advancing the gospel this is actually working god is this isn't god's program that i'm here hallelujah now what if he sat there in a pity party do you think the gospel would have been advanced no remember he's a human like you know he had a decision to make was this situation going to make him bitter against god or better because there's the two things every everything that comes in life it's a fork in the road will it make me bitter will it make me better but it's your choice which way you go it's like you're driving a car should i turn left or right now the bitter road can seem a lot more comfortable because unfortunately humans get that way naturally but you've got to have an eagle vision and say no no this will make me better i'll not let this rule me but but the lord will use this if i send it to him as a trophy of his grace that he can use this down the road for someone else amen now the apostle paul would say in romans 8 28 and we know all things work together for good to them that love god and to them that was called according to his purpose he was a man that was shipwrecked as i've said he was bitten by a poisonous snake he was beaten he was stoned he had to run for his life you know many things happened to him he says all things work together for good when i stoned i was working for good when i was shipwrecked i was working for good when i was running out of that city it was working for good me now we may not understand how that specific moment was working for good but that was developing a character in him and making him a greater living testimony hallelujah i love these words because this was not just a nice idea that came to paul he lived this out for whom he did for know he did also predestine to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many brethren we know all things work together for our good day where you are right now if you're a really cool elected son or daughter of god is working for your good hallelujah remember he did yeah whom he did for no he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say to these things if god be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifieth who is he that condemneth it's christ that died yet rather that has risen again who is even at the right hand of god who who also maketh into session for us who shall separate from the love of christ shall tribulation he went through tribulation or distress he had distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or pearl or sword as is written for thy sakes we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter now in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principality nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord all those things tried to separate him and that's what the devil does he tries to separate us from the love of god but he is but the apostle paul based on experience was persuaded nothing can separate me hallelujah it should be the same thing with you and i hallelujah the apostle paul never blamed god for the state he found himself in i said lord jesus help us to be the same in every situation to conduct ourselves as sons and daughters of god now he would say in ephesians i've just got a couple more scriptures to read in them and then and then we'll quit he says in ephesians 5 be not drunk with wine we're in a success but be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and make making melody in your heart to the lord giving thanks always for all things under god and the father name of our lord jesus christ now i just want to point something out he did not put conditions on this if you're happy sing songs if you're rejoicing if everything's going well be this way no he says in all things he says giving thanks always for all things unto god that it that was that that's all things you have a bad day thank you lord having a great day thank you lord having a terrible week hallelujah having a bad year glory to god thank you lord praise your name anyway amen hallelujah david would say in psalms 34 i'll bless the lord at all times all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth you know if you've got the praise of god in your mouth you know you can't i can't have anything else right you've got a capacity you must fill it up with the praise of god my soul shall make her boast in the lord and the humble shall hear thereof and be glad oh magnify the law with me let us exalt his name together i sought the lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears they looked upon him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed this poor man cried and the lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles the angel of the lord and command uh encampeth about them that fear him and delivereth them o taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him oh fear the lord ye his saints for there is no want to them that fear him so i'm going to ask you the question in your trials do you miss the blessing do you miss the almighty god wants to reveal his power in your trial doesn't matter how big it is how small is he wants to reveal himself in that trial but if we're caught up in what we see in the poor means we'll miss it but if we look to the lord remember you have found favor in the sight of god that's why trials have come upon you the grace of god has come upon you and and the reason that happens or what is shown by that is what a trial has happened hallelujah so you're blessed you say i'm going through the worst part of my life ever you're very blessed hallelujah that's why i should lift up you know you know you know jesus says when you see all these things everything that's happening in the world lift up your heads and know your redemption draweth nigh hence i look down at these things in the trouble no lift up your heads look up to him why because your redemption draweth nigh so i said lord jesus help us to conduct ourselves like sons and daughters of god in the trial not to miss his hand in the trial i mean let's have the musicians this morning please you know can i come [Applause] hey man let's stand this morning amen i want to sing set your wings to the winds of faith again maybe that's what we're going to do amen amen you may have failed miserably in your last trial what do you do just say lord jesus try me again help me
