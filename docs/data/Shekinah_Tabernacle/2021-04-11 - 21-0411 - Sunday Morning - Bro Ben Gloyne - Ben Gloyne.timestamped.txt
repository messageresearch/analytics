[50:02] acts 26 verse 12.
[50:08] this is this is uh this is paul speaking
[50:11] to king agrippa
[50:14] whereupon as i went to damascus with
[50:16] authority and commission from the chief
[50:18] priests
[50:18] at midday o king i saw in the way a
[50:20] light from heaven
[50:22] above brightness of the sun shining
[50:24] round about me and them which
[50:26] journeyed with me and when we were all
[50:28] fallen to the earth i heard a voice
[50:30] speaking unto me and saying in the
[50:32] hebrew tongue
[50:33] saul saul why persecuted thou me it is
[50:36] hard for thee to kick against the pricks
[50:38] and i said who art thou lord and he said
[50:40] i am jesus whom that persecuteth
[50:43] but arise and stand upon my feet for i
[50:46] have appeared
[50:46] unto thee by me pardon me for this
[50:50] purpose
[50:51] to make them minister and a witness both
[50:53] of these things which thou has seen
[50:55] and of those things in which i will
[50:56] appear unto thee deliver
[50:59] delivering thee from the people and from
[51:01] the gentiles unto whom
[51:03] now i send thee to open their eyes and
[51:07] to turn them from darkness to light
[51:09] from the power of satan unto god that
[51:11] they may receive forgiveness of sins and
[51:14] inheritance among them
[51:15] which are sanctified by faith that is in
[51:18] me
[51:18] whereupon o king agrippa i was not
[51:21] disobedient
[51:22] unto the heavenly vision and we're going
[51:25] to go to ecclesiastes as well
[51:27] this may seem like a bit of a shotgun
[51:29] kind of service but we'll get somewhere
[51:31] and
[51:31] we'll start summer end up in another
[51:32] place but i just pray the lord will tie
[51:34] this all together so very familiar piece
[51:36] of scripture
[51:38] if we go to ecclesiastes three and one
[51:52] says here to everything there is a
[51:55] season
[51:56] and a time to every purpose under heaven
[52:00] a time to be born and a time to die a
[52:03] time to plant a time to pluck up that
[52:05] which is planted
[52:06] a time to kill in a time to heal a time
[52:08] to break down a time to build up
[52:10] a time to weep and a time to laugh a
[52:13] time to mourn and a time to dance
[52:15] a time to cast away stones and a time to
[52:17] gather stones together
[52:19] a time to embrace in a time to refrain
[52:21] from embracing
[52:22] a time to get and a time to lose a time
[52:25] to keep and a time to cast away
[52:27] a time to reindeer time to sow a time to
[52:30] keep silence and a time to speak
[52:32] a time to love and a time to hate a time
[52:34] of war in a time of peace
[52:36] amen we'll just leave it there may the
[52:38] lord bless the reading of his word this
[52:39] morning you may have your seats this
[52:40] morning
[52:41] um i just want to speak about i have a
[52:44] few things in my mind brother he'd ask
[52:46] me what my title is that i got like four
[52:48] rattling around but
[52:49] i want to speak about having an absolute
[52:51] you know the apostle paul could stand
[52:53] there after it was about 30 odd years
[52:56] after that road to damascus
[52:58] experience and and and he was relating
[53:00] that experience to
[53:01] to king agrippa and everyone that was
[53:03] surrounding um you know him and
[53:05] you know to paul that was a that was a
[53:08] defining moment of his life it was more
[53:10] defining than all the
[53:11] all the learning that he received under
[53:13] gamalia all of the bible school that he
[53:15] said and all the
[53:16] all the teaching that no doubt he
[53:18] preached it was it was more defining
[53:19] than that
[53:20] because he met the god that gave the
[53:21] scripture you know it was more than just
[53:24] another it's more than just
[53:25] changing your thinking to another
[53:26] thinking you know brother brown would
[53:28] stand in india and he was challenged by
[53:30] all the major religions of india there
[53:32] was the hindus there was the buddhists
[53:34] there was
[53:35] there was the muslims the jains the
[53:36] sikhs all the different ones there
[53:38] and they they all stood up and they
[53:40] began to tell
[53:42] brother branham how little and weak and
[53:44] useless basically christianity was
[53:47] and and and so he said to them after
[53:49] they did this and i think at jane temple
[53:51] or one of their temples he said well
[53:52] well gentlemen tomorrow we're having a
[53:55] church service and i want to invite you
[53:57] there so they all came now
[54:01] brother brown would preach how jesus
[54:02] christ is the god of gods there's no
[54:04] other god beside him
[54:05] and then and then and then a prayer line
[54:07] would come and the prophet had seen a
[54:09] vision of a son worshiper a blind man
[54:11] that would receive his sight now he'd
[54:13] already seen it in vision now
[54:14] when when the word goes from just ink on
[54:17] paper to to a revelation to you
[54:19] i mean that becomes an absolute it goes
[54:21] from beyond a well i think it's a good
[54:23] idea it's not a good idea this person
[54:25] says this this person thinks this what
[54:27] do i think no it becomes an
[54:28] absolute so in that very moment he knew
[54:31] that jesus christ was alive he knew
[54:33] jesus christ was the very creator of
[54:34] heavens and earth
[54:35] he knew that jesus christ was the only
[54:37] god but in that moment that version
[54:39] brother brahm says he would never have
[54:41] made the challenge he was about to make
[54:43] unless god had already given the vision
[54:44] that that man was going to receive his
[54:46] sight now
[54:47] a man came before him a sun worshiper
[54:49] his eyes were basically white because he
[54:51] stared at the sun
[54:52] thinking that basically if he's looked
[54:54] at the sun long enough he'd receive some
[54:56] kind of blessing or something and he was
[54:57] he was blind
[54:58] and then so he began to challenge all
[55:01] the religions of india
[55:02] and say now we all know this man is
[55:04] blind but
[55:06] let your god if you serve the true and
[55:08] living god
[55:09] let him come now and give him back his
[55:11] sight
[55:12] you know and you know he said but what
[55:14] you would do is you just change the
[55:16] man's thinking from maybe from
[55:18] from from being a buddhist to being a
[55:20] being a muslim from a muslim to be a
[55:21] hindu you know
[55:22] that's all your religions do and and and
[55:24] he said we have the same thing in
[55:26] america
[55:27] all the pentecostals want to make all
[55:28] the baptists pentecostal and all the
[55:30] baptists want to make all the methodist
[55:31] baptists and it's just a changing of
[55:33] thinking
[55:34] but real christianity's not a changing
[55:36] of thinking it's a resurrected power
[55:38] it's the lord jesus christ the word
[55:40] coming into you
[55:41] and him living his life out of you so he
[55:43] made the challenge if you really serve
[55:45] if your god is really god
[55:47] come and give this man his sight back
[55:50] the place was quiet
[55:52] and then he began to pray for the man
[55:53] and begin to thank god he said i felt
[55:55] like elijah on mount carmel
[55:57] but elijah knew where he was standing on
[55:59] mount carmel because he had an
[56:00] absolute come into his life he wasn't
[56:02] just hoping that god would send fire he
[56:04] knew god was gonna send the fire
[56:06] hallelujah so there he was and he prayed
[56:08] for the blind man his eyes were fully
[56:10] restored he could see perfectly well
[56:12] and basically just the whole place just
[56:13] erupted why because
[56:16] there was an absolute that the prophet
[56:19] had
[56:20] it wasn't just a hope so that's why we
[56:22] can actually stand here and say
[56:24] this way is the right way and it is the
[56:27] only way
[56:28] it's not a mixture of ways this is the
[56:30] way jesus says i'm the way the truth and
[56:32] the life
[56:33] no man can come to the father but by me
[56:35] there's only one way
[56:36] hallelujah and it's not just and it's
[56:39] not based on a polished up argument
[56:41] but it's based on a reality where god
[56:45] becomes alive his word becomes living
[56:47] so the apostle paul had it he they came
[56:50] into his life in absolute
[56:53] now we have to have the same kind of an
[56:55] absolute
[56:57] we must have it we if we don't have the
[57:00] absolute of who god is
[57:02] to you the word becoming personal to you
[57:04] alive to you
[57:06] you'll be like sifting sands but if you
[57:08] really know him
[57:10] then upon this rock i'll build my church
[57:12] the lord said and the gates of hell will
[57:13] not prevail
[57:14] i mean today rock there's the revelation
[57:16] of who he is
[57:18] it goes beyond an argument an idea oh
[57:20] well everyone's nice so i'll just join
[57:22] up no it's not about that
[57:23] it's about the lord is alive his word is
[57:26] true he's become real to me
[57:27] it becomes an absolute now
[57:30] the definitive uh definition of absolute
[57:35] it means as webster would say brother
[57:37] brahman preaches this a few places
[57:40] he says it's perfect in itself unlimited
[57:43] in its power
[57:44] primarily an ultimate and an ultimate is
[57:47] the amen that's all it's an absolute
[57:51] it's unlimited in power it's perfect in
[57:54] itself
[57:55] that's all of it it settles it and
[57:57] absolute has the final word
[57:59] you know there's a lot of armchair
[58:01] sports fans
[58:03] and there's replays of referee calls and
[58:06] things and they complain and they say
[58:08] this and this and doesn't matter what
[58:09] sporting arena
[58:11] there's a whole bunch of armchair
[58:12] umpires that think that they have the
[58:14] final say and they think they're right
[58:16] but the man who's dressed or the woman
[58:18] who's the umpire on the field
[58:20] they have the final say they make the
[58:22] call if it was
[58:24] you know lbw or not a nick or not a
[58:27] catch or not whatever kind of sporting
[58:28] thing
[58:29] the ball's in or it's out it's not the
[58:31] people in the stands that make that call
[58:33] there's an absolute on the field that
[58:35] actually says in or out
[58:37] hallelujah and that person no matter the
[58:40] criticism they receive
[58:42] or their all the or their character
[58:44] tries to be shot down you know
[58:45] there's been you know there are there
[58:48] are moments in sport that are talked
[58:49] about more than the actual game
[58:52] this went wrong you know this happened
[58:54] this should happen this way and
[58:56] but at the end of the day who's holding
[58:57] the trophy because an
[58:59] absolute said a certain thing they made
[59:01] a certain ruling
[59:02] they are the amen of the game hallelujah
[59:05] they have the final say
[59:07] now our god when he revealed himself to
[59:10] this ladies in age
[59:11] he said that i am the amen the faithful
[59:14] and true witness
[59:16] hallelujah so what he's declaring to
[59:17] this agent says i am the amen i'm the
[59:19] finality
[59:21] i have the last say in this age there's
[59:23] a lot of people that say a lot of things
[59:24] in this age but i have the final say
[59:27] i am the amen and i've come down in this
[59:29] age to declare that i am the amen and i
[59:31] want you to know i have the final say
[59:33] and i want you to know that i should be
[59:36] your absolute
[59:38] hallelujah amen so a real absolute
[59:42] is unlimited in its power a false
[59:46] absolute is limited in its power a real
[59:49] absolute is perfect in itself
[59:51] i'm just i'm just kind of rephrasing the
[59:53] definitions
[59:54] but a a a false absolute is imperfect in
[59:58] itself
[1:00:00] so now for an in order to something to
[1:00:03] be an absolute
[1:00:04] it must be proved it's an absolute
[1:00:07] hallelujah just like brother abraham
[1:00:09] standing in india
[1:00:09] he proved that his god was the absolute
[1:00:12] because none of the others stood up
[1:00:14] the buddhist priest didn't stand up the
[1:00:16] you know you know the imam from the
[1:00:18] muslims or the
[1:00:19] or the priests from the sikhs or
[1:00:20] whatever they didn't get up and heal the
[1:00:22] man
[1:00:23] hallelujah because the absolute stood up
[1:00:26] and said no no this is
[1:00:27] and it wasn't the prophet that it was
[1:00:29] god proving himself
[1:00:30] he said i want you religious people to
[1:00:32] know i'm actually the true living god
[1:00:35] and and brother brown challenged him if
[1:00:36] god of jesus christ gives this man his
[1:00:38] sight back you better fall on your face
[1:00:40] and give your life to him
[1:00:42] hallelujah if god is god let's serve him
[1:00:44] if he's not let's find something else to
[1:00:46] do
[1:00:48] that's how i feel about it i mean let's
[1:00:49] be honest
[1:00:51] if this wasn't real i wouldn't be here i
[1:00:54] wouldn't be standing here if this wasn't
[1:00:55] real
[1:00:56] i mean if this was just a man-made idea
[1:00:58] i'd be gone
[1:00:59] but if it is a true and living god if
[1:01:01] this message is
[1:01:02] as god revealed today if this bible is
[1:01:05] our absolute we should give our whole
[1:01:07] lives to it
[1:01:08] although we are all of our strength all
[1:01:10] our ambitions hopes and plans should be
[1:01:12] actually lord
[1:01:13] i want your ambitions hopes and plans
[1:01:15] and because it's when the absolute comes
[1:01:17] into a person's life then they overcome
[1:01:20] because they realize that the thing
[1:01:21] that's fighting for them is greater than
[1:01:23] the thing fighting against them
[1:01:25] because the word says greater is he
[1:01:27] that's in you the he that's in the world
[1:01:29] that means we've got to come to a
[1:01:30] conclusion our god is greater
[1:01:32] our god is stronger our god is able our
[1:01:35] god is already finished hallelujah
[1:01:37] amen we don't have something that makes
[1:01:39] a start and we quit in the middle
[1:01:41] no someone who has an absolute goes all
[1:01:43] the way
[1:01:44] hey amen caleb and joshua they weren't
[1:01:47] just going with the crowd when they said
[1:01:48] we're going to take the mountain they
[1:01:50] received an absolute a lot of other
[1:01:52] people heard the same preaching but
[1:01:53] something anchored in their souls it
[1:01:55] became an absolute to them
[1:01:56] that it wasn't moses giving a promise it
[1:01:59] wasn't because everyone else was doing
[1:02:00] it but it was because god promised them
[1:02:02] hallelujah so they received an absolute
[1:02:05] and their absolute
[1:02:06] was greater than what they saw what they
[1:02:08] felt
[1:02:09] you know many people's feelings are
[1:02:10] they're absolute
[1:02:13] i don't feel like getting up today they
[1:02:14] stay in bed i don't feel like going to
[1:02:16] work today
[1:02:17] they call the boss i'm not feeling well
[1:02:19] but it's really just how they feel as
[1:02:20] opposed to a real sickness yo
[1:02:22] and their emotions lead them about and
[1:02:24] they're absolute as their emotions
[1:02:25] that's not an absolute hallelujah but we
[1:02:28] have something where we can look to the
[1:02:29] unseen
[1:02:31] amen let's go to that scripture i have
[1:02:32] it in my notes this is one of my
[1:02:34] favorite
[1:02:35] favorite scriptures hallelujah
[1:02:45] the lord is great you think about what
[1:02:48] we have
[1:02:49] hallelujah well he's literally going to
[1:02:51] carry us away
[1:02:53] amen yeah brother braham says that the
[1:02:54] holy ghost in you is going to change
[1:02:56] these atoms
[1:02:57] that the rapture has already taken place
[1:02:59] in a people hardly this quickening power
[1:03:01] you know we've just been through easter
[1:03:03] hallelujah
[1:03:04] the quickening power that was released
[1:03:06] that day hasn't gone away
[1:03:09] i love that song that we just sung
[1:03:11] because i believe it he'll pour his
[1:03:12] spirit out more and more
[1:03:14] i mean that rapturing faith is being
[1:03:16] poured out more and more upon the church
[1:03:18] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:03:22] i happen to believe it
[1:03:26] if you don't believe me go back walk
[1:03:29] camps and conventions used to be like
[1:03:31] and then go to the most recent ones and
[1:03:33] go look what's going on
[1:03:35] it's getting greater it's not getting
[1:03:37] more diminished
[1:03:38] god's getting greater because i really
[1:03:40] think our eyes are coming open that he's
[1:03:42] here
[1:03:43] right because god hasn't changed it's
[1:03:45] just our eyes need to come open
[1:03:47] when we realize he's unlimited in his
[1:03:49] power he's more than able to do it
[1:03:51] i mean his promise is a yay man he's a
[1:03:53] true and living god
[1:03:55] and when you realize that he loves you
[1:03:57] he's not mad at you he
[1:03:59] loves you that's why he poured his life
[1:04:01] out on calvary for you
[1:04:02] he wants to see you around the streets
[1:04:04] that you're on the streets of gold
[1:04:05] dancing
[1:04:06] hallelujah he wants to join that dance
[1:04:09] hallelujah
[1:04:11] you know he's not an angry god had you
[1:04:14] and i
[1:04:16] because his wrath was poured out that
[1:04:17] day on calvary the wrath we should have
[1:04:19] received was poured out
[1:04:22] hallelujah on the lord jesus christ
[1:04:25] amen hallelujah now
[1:04:29] 2nd corinthians 4. we are troubled on
[1:04:33] every side
[1:04:35] yet not distressed if you find yourself
[1:04:37] living this out it's okay
[1:04:40] we're allowed to be troubled but we have
[1:04:42] a place of safety in a time of trouble
[1:04:45] hallelujah we are troubled on every side
[1:04:48] yet not distressed we are perplexed
[1:04:50] but not in despair persecuted but not
[1:04:53] forsaken
[1:04:54] my god doesn't leave me alone hallelujah
[1:04:58] some people like some children i wish
[1:05:00] you just leave me alone
[1:05:01] my god doesn't leave me alone i'm happy
[1:05:03] about that i don't want him to leave me
[1:05:05] alone
[1:05:06] because i'm not forsaken cast down but
[1:05:08] not destroyed
[1:05:10] always bearing about in the body the
[1:05:12] dying of the lord jesus that the life
[1:05:13] force of jesus might be made manifest in
[1:05:15] our body
[1:05:16] for we which live are always delivered
[1:05:18] unto death for jesus sake
[1:05:20] that the life also of jesus might be
[1:05:21] made manifest in our mortal flesh
[1:05:24] so then death worketh in us but life in
[1:05:26] you
[1:05:27] we having the same spirit of faith as
[1:05:29] according it is written
[1:05:31] i believed therefore have i spoken ye
[1:05:34] also believe and therefore speak
[1:05:36] amen we've got to confess some things
[1:05:39] you can't just keep it bottled up
[1:05:41] they're going to be a pressure burst
[1:05:42] somewhere
[1:05:44] hallelujah knowing that he which raised
[1:05:46] up the lord jesus shall raise up
[1:05:48] us also by jesus and shall present us
[1:05:51] with you
[1:05:52] for all things are for your sakes that
[1:05:54] the abundant grace
[1:05:55] might through the thanksgiving of many
[1:05:57] rebound to the glory of god
[1:05:59] for which cause we faint not that though
[1:06:02] our outward man perish
[1:06:04] yet the inward man is renewed day by day
[1:06:07] for our light affliction
[1:06:08] which is but for a moment every trial
[1:06:13] is in this category
[1:06:16] because if you have an absolute remember
[1:06:18] that absolute isn't just for our earthly
[1:06:19] journey
[1:06:20] the absolute our lord jesus christ our
[1:06:22] absolutist to take us into glory
[1:06:25] so i really are because i think some
[1:06:27] people think we're very narrow-minded
[1:06:31] you need to be more open-minded you know
[1:06:33] the world's moved on think a bit more
[1:06:34] progressively well
[1:06:36] actually we are we are the most
[1:06:37] open-minded people in the world
[1:06:39] because our mind goes beyond the five
[1:06:41] senses and goes from eternity to
[1:06:43] eternity
[1:06:44] we actually see the big picture that's
[1:06:46] open-minded if you see a small part
[1:06:48] that's actually closed-minded
[1:06:49] if you only see what people's opinions
[1:06:51] and and your feelings and fire you know
[1:06:53] the five senses that's very
[1:06:54] narrow-minded thinking
[1:06:56] but open-minded thinking is actually
[1:06:58] lord you've called me for a purpose
[1:07:00] you put me upon the earth for a reason
[1:07:02] i'm not here just taking up space
[1:07:04] holy but i'm here to to to manifest your
[1:07:07] glory
[1:07:08] that you'll come live in me and
[1:07:09] hallelujah manifest your glory out of me
[1:07:11] i'm here to be a living witness doesn't
[1:07:13] matter what part of the body i'm part of
[1:07:15] i'm part of the body
[1:07:17] i may be a toe hallelujah i'm a toe i
[1:07:20] may be a rib praise the lord i may be
[1:07:21] the little
[1:07:22] bone in the inside of the air i have a
[1:07:24] function
[1:07:26] we're all important amen for our light
[1:07:29] affliction which is but for a moment
[1:07:31] worketh for us a far more exceeding and
[1:07:33] eternal weight of glory
[1:07:35] while we look while we look not at the
[1:07:38] things which are seen
[1:07:40] but the things which are not seen for
[1:07:42] the things which are seen are temporal
[1:07:44] but the things which are not seen are
[1:07:47] eternal
[1:07:48] now you take the apostle paul's life he
[1:07:50] went through some things
[1:07:52] he didn't just have some bad days he had
[1:07:53] some real bad days
[1:07:55] most of the most of the uh new testament
[1:07:58] that he wrote
[1:08:00] he did not sit in a nice place in the
[1:08:02] country with his feet up and a lazy boy
[1:08:04] riding letters
[1:08:05] he was chained to a guard he was in
[1:08:08] prison
[1:08:09] he was hungry he was cold he had trouble
[1:08:13] he had pressure but yet in all of that
[1:08:16] the lord inspired him
[1:08:17] to write such things hallelujah
[1:08:21] hallelujah he knew what it was like to
[1:08:23] be persecuted
[1:08:25] his kind of itinerary of preaching was
[1:08:27] based i'm gonna go preach in this city
[1:08:29] peop unbelievers gonna rise up they're
[1:08:31] gonna persecute me they're gonna go to
[1:08:32] another city they're gonna follow me to
[1:08:34] this next city i'm gonna have a service
[1:08:35] there
[1:08:36] we're gonna have a wonderful time then
[1:08:37] the people from that previous city gonna
[1:08:38] come and
[1:08:39] you know beat me and you there's gonna
[1:08:40] be trouble i'm gonna raise up that was
[1:08:42] and
[1:08:42] i'd end up in jail that was how
[1:08:46] that's how his itinerary went we're
[1:08:49] gonna sleep tomorrow paul
[1:08:51] uh in jail what about a hotel motel now
[1:08:54] i don't need that i got free
[1:08:55] accommodation
[1:08:57] i got a free chauffeur to get me there
[1:08:59] hallelujah but you know
[1:09:01] but he wasn't looking he had a heart he
[1:09:03] had a hard road
[1:09:04] hallelujah shipwrecked persecuted
[1:09:08] false brethren coming unawares
[1:09:10] antichrist spirits he fought against
[1:09:12] you know sickness beatings peril all
[1:09:15] kind of trouble
[1:09:16] but because he had an absolute he didn't
[1:09:18] quit
[1:09:20] hallelujah he didn't quit when he stood
[1:09:22] there before king agrippa that we read
[1:09:24] and you take that 30 odd years of of of
[1:09:26] time from acts 9 to
[1:09:28] was it acts 26 a lot of things happen in
[1:09:32] that span of time
[1:09:33] there's a lot of peril there's a lot of
[1:09:34] hardship there's a lot of trouble
[1:09:36] there's a lot of glorious times too but
[1:09:38] you know we should never let the
[1:09:39] bad outweigh the good hallelujah
[1:09:43] we should never draw back just because
[1:09:44] of bad we should put push forward
[1:09:47] because he had an absolute those things
[1:09:49] didn't move him
[1:09:50] he said none of these things moved me
[1:09:54] hallelujah he had a lot come against him
[1:09:56] he had opposition
[1:09:57] we've got to realize we have opposition
[1:09:59] it's good we have opposition
[1:10:01] because we have opposition that means
[1:10:02] there's an opposing force against us
[1:10:04] who is that that's the devil he said the
[1:10:06] devil's on my case
[1:10:08] that's not a bad thing that means that
[1:10:10] you're fighting him
[1:10:11] hallelujah hallelujah you know we all
[1:10:14] have mind battles
[1:10:16] we're not a men from mind battles we're
[1:10:17] not immune from trouble
[1:10:19] but we have an overcoming power
[1:10:22] hallelujah
[1:10:24] amen why because we receive an absolute
[1:10:28] now brother braham says this here
[1:10:33] he says he says in the message absolute
[1:10:37] he says but the word absolute is an
[1:10:40] ultimate and therefore i think that
[1:10:41] everybody should have an ultimate
[1:10:44] and every great achievement that's ever
[1:10:46] been achieved
[1:10:47] there has been an absolute behind it no
[1:10:50] matter what it was
[1:10:51] it had an absolute behind it and every
[1:10:54] person in order to achieve
[1:10:56] something has first to have the absolute
[1:11:00] and that's the final win back through
[1:11:03] this
[1:11:04] that back through the other till you
[1:11:05] come to that absolute all the amen or
[1:11:07] the ultimate
[1:11:08] and what you've got something you have
[1:11:10] to tie to in other words
[1:11:12] it's the final tying post to every
[1:11:15] achievement
[1:11:16] it's somewhere it might wind through
[1:11:18] many difficult things till you get to
[1:11:20] that thai post
[1:11:21] but there is an amen to all of it there
[1:11:24] must be such a thing you cannot go
[1:11:26] through life without having one
[1:11:28] so he says it winds through a lot of
[1:11:29] difficult places
[1:11:31] the apostle paul i'm sure we would agree
[1:11:36] that he had to wind through being a
[1:11:38] pharisee of the pharisees that was a
[1:11:40] massive one
[1:11:41] he had to go past who he thought he was
[1:11:44] to what who god made him to be
[1:11:46] the rich and ruler couldn't wind past
[1:11:48] that but paul could
[1:11:51] and because he wound past those things
[1:11:53] he got an
[1:11:54] absolute thai post in his life where it
[1:11:56] went more from the high priest backing
[1:11:59] and a and a letter in his hand from the
[1:12:02] high priest
[1:12:03] to the living god coming and living in
[1:12:05] his life
[1:12:07] hallelujah there was a living a living
[1:12:09] word
[1:12:10] amen amen this is what we must have if
[1:12:14] we ever want to achieve anything we must
[1:12:16] have an absolute
[1:12:18] now we must be very careful what our
[1:12:21] absolute
[1:12:22] is if our abs if you're absolute as me
[1:12:26] you have the wrong absolute
[1:12:29] there should have been a universal amen
[1:12:31] right there if you're absolute as this
[1:12:33] church you have the wrong absolute but
[1:12:36] if your absolute is the word
[1:12:38] then you have the right absolute right
[1:12:40] because this church can change
[1:12:43] we're human i pray we we just keep we
[1:12:45] just become more like the lord i pray we
[1:12:47] change in that way
[1:12:48] i pray we never just sit down and fall
[1:12:50] asleep i pray we press the battle
[1:12:52] that's what i pray become more like the
[1:12:55] lord more like his word
[1:12:56] i mean so you cannot make a church
[1:12:58] you're absolute you cannot make me your
[1:13:00] absolute
[1:13:01] brother brahms absolute was the bible
[1:13:04] right that should be our absolute what
[1:13:06] about the message well well it reveals
[1:13:08] christ in the scripture
[1:13:10] amen but we shouldn't you know don't
[1:13:12] make me your absolute
[1:13:15] we're not here to mimic one another
[1:13:17] we're here to become like the lord like
[1:13:19] his word
[1:13:20] amen amen jesus is coming for people who
[1:13:22] reflect him
[1:13:24] who manifest that's what he's looking
[1:13:25] for the female part of himself
[1:13:27] he's not looking for me and you and
[1:13:29] that'll be the worst thing to ever
[1:13:30] happen
[1:13:33] amen right i don't know why everyone
[1:13:37] don't be like me don't have my
[1:13:40] mannerisms please don't have my
[1:13:41] temperament
[1:13:42] you know don't talk like me don't act
[1:13:44] don't don't try and mimic me
[1:13:46] whatever you do be like the lord
[1:13:50] brother braham said that there'd be
[1:13:51] plenty of mimics in this day let's not
[1:13:53] be mimics let's be the genuine
[1:13:56] amen so paul had an absolute but the
[1:13:59] thing is now
[1:14:01] your absolute as i said must be the
[1:14:03] right thing
[1:14:05] now if i have this here
[1:14:09] someone who leads us in a different
[1:14:11] direction
[1:14:13] can other than to christ becomes our
[1:14:16] absolute
[1:14:17] brotherhood says this in an absolute and
[1:14:19] and i heard this a few years ago
[1:14:21] but but it really struck me if you can
[1:14:23] read that scripture something that
[1:14:24] christ has ordained or commissioned us
[1:14:26] to do
[1:14:27] and because of some twisting around if
[1:14:29] someone would tell you
[1:14:30] that that was for the disciples or for
[1:14:32] something else and then you don't hold
[1:14:34] on
[1:14:35] and and then you don't hold on to that
[1:14:38] which is the word then christ is not
[1:14:40] your absolute
[1:14:41] that person who led you out of the way
[1:14:43] is your absolute
[1:14:45] we don't want someone else to become our
[1:14:47] absolute
[1:14:48] because the person because that person
[1:14:50] you know what do you call it
[1:14:52] uh influences your life in such a way
[1:14:54] you begin to go another way
[1:14:56] go with the scripture though christian
[1:14:57] but he becomes your or she becomes your
[1:15:00] absolute
[1:15:02] i just want you to think about these
[1:15:03] things a little bit you know but our
[1:15:05] absolute should be the word of god
[1:15:08] hallelujah amen
[1:15:11] now
[1:15:14] moses got an absolute in his life
[1:15:18] he was told that he'd be the deliverer
[1:15:20] now i now i just want to
[1:15:22] i just want to contrast now the
[1:15:24] difference between
[1:15:26] uh you being your own absolute and god
[1:15:28] becoming your absolute
[1:15:30] and it's all based on revelation because
[1:15:33] if it's
[1:15:34] if it's man doing it if it's you trying
[1:15:36] to do it
[1:15:37] it it's different to god revealing it
[1:15:40] there's there's actually a big
[1:15:41] difference
[1:15:42] between knowing something in your mind
[1:15:44] and it being in your heart
[1:15:46] because if it's in your heart you know
[1:15:48] god will do it
[1:15:50] and you're rejoicing because you know
[1:15:51] he'll do it it doesn't mean you quit and
[1:15:53] say you know because some people say
[1:15:54] well god will just have to do it they
[1:15:55] just forget about it no
[1:15:57] if you know god will do it then you'll
[1:15:58] praise him for it
[1:16:00] hallelujah with thanksgiving that it's
[1:16:02] there
[1:16:03] it's yours but if it's in your mind
[1:16:06] then you'll try and manufacture it
[1:16:10] now moses was the promised son he was a
[1:16:15] serpent bruiser in his day
[1:16:16] he was a prophesied one who will deliver
[1:16:20] the children of israel out of egypt that
[1:16:22] was that was his
[1:16:23] piece of scripture that he was um
[1:16:25] ordained to manifest that was that was
[1:16:27] him in prophecy right
[1:16:29] but now there had had to come a time
[1:16:32] where where that child would be born
[1:16:35] now when you realize it's god and only
[1:16:38] god that can do it
[1:16:40] that's when we really go to prayer right
[1:16:42] that's when people really go to prayer
[1:16:44] because there's a big difference between
[1:16:46] oh yes i know god will do it but you're
[1:16:47] trying to do it
[1:16:48] and actually you're realizing only god
[1:16:50] can do it because it actually manifests
[1:16:52] in two different ways because
[1:16:53] if it's you trying to do it then you
[1:16:55] humanly try and control the situation
[1:16:56] make it happen
[1:16:58] right but if you know only god can do it
[1:17:00] that should push us into prayer
[1:17:02] hallelujah so so moses's father
[1:17:05] and the message um lifting him up out of
[1:17:07] history
[1:17:08] amran was a slave and slave in in egypt
[1:17:11] as
[1:17:11] but as an israelite just like all the
[1:17:14] others and he was beaten like everyone
[1:17:16] else he was he was fed probably the bad
[1:17:18] food or
[1:17:18] mistreated like everyone else but he had
[1:17:21] something burning in his heart
[1:17:22] that now was the season remember there's
[1:17:24] a season for all things that's why i
[1:17:26] read there in ecclesiastes
[1:17:28] there's a season for all things we
[1:17:30] happen to be living in a resurrection
[1:17:31] season
[1:17:32] we have to be living in a real good
[1:17:33] season but if there's a season for it
[1:17:35] then there must be a people on the earth
[1:17:37] that manifest that season
[1:17:39] amen just like brother brown would
[1:17:40] preach about your ducks would swarm at a
[1:17:42] certain season you know we have little
[1:17:44] birds i think they're called godwits
[1:17:46] that that actually travel from new
[1:17:47] zealand up to alaska and back
[1:17:50] but as the season changes then they
[1:17:52] migrate and then they come back
[1:17:54] who knows about them one of the most
[1:17:57] furthest migrating birds in the world
[1:17:58] apparently
[1:18:00] and so but it's when the season changes
[1:18:03] something stirs up within them they have
[1:18:06] to fly
[1:18:07] they can't stay here in the beautiful
[1:18:09] new zealand they've got to go up to
[1:18:10] alaska or wherever they go they go a
[1:18:13] real long way
[1:18:14] but it's because there's a change of
[1:18:15] season now when the
[1:18:17] season changes it's because the
[1:18:19] atmosphere begins to change
[1:18:21] right when spring spring happens because
[1:18:23] the atmosphere changes the earth goes
[1:18:25] out by the earth goes a little bit
[1:18:26] closer to the sun and the soil
[1:18:29] temperature rises you know there's more
[1:18:30] sunlight it becomes warmer
[1:18:32] hardly there's your spring rain
[1:18:34] different things and life begins to come
[1:18:36] forth
[1:18:36] why because the season is changing now
[1:18:39] we're living in a season of resurrection
[1:18:42] hallelujah we're living in a season of
[1:18:44] all things
[1:18:45] amen not just not just a partial you
[1:18:48] know
[1:18:48] not just a partial word but a full word
[1:18:52] so we're living in the time of the
[1:18:54] manifestation of the sons of god now i
[1:18:57] might be throwing out a lot of terms but
[1:18:58] i want you to think about it
[1:18:59] where god ordained his church to be
[1:19:02] joining us with christ
[1:19:04] right but it's now it's not just talking
[1:19:06] about it and actually becomes a living
[1:19:08] reality
[1:19:09] because it's the season for it and
[1:19:11] there's a season for satan to be under
[1:19:13] the feet
[1:19:14] of the bride of christ because it's a
[1:19:16] season for it
[1:19:17] it's the season for all devils to be
[1:19:18] cast out as the season that now
[1:19:21] it's not the devil fighting us anymore
[1:19:23] but we're fighting him
[1:19:24] it's the season that we are not on the
[1:19:26] retreat but we're on the attack
[1:19:28] it is a season for god to pour out his
[1:19:30] spirit more and more
[1:19:31] it's a season for the revelation of the
[1:19:33] open book to become living
[1:19:35] i mean when john saw the lamb take the
[1:19:37] book and all of heaven and earth and
[1:19:38] under
[1:19:39] heard him cry out blessings and honor
[1:19:40] and glory to the lamb why
[1:19:42] because it became a reality to him even
[1:19:44] just in that prophetic way but it was
[1:19:46] the season
[1:19:47] for the bride to respond you know it's
[1:19:49] you know there should be such a worship
[1:19:51] in our hearts
[1:19:52] jesus paid it all and all to him io
[1:19:56] what is the you know to me what does
[1:19:57] this seals opening really do
[1:19:59] it magnifies what god has done brother
[1:20:02] brown says in one place
[1:20:03] that john's lifted up there in
[1:20:04] revelations 4 and 5 because god wants to
[1:20:06] show
[1:20:07] what you know yo to the redeemed what he
[1:20:09] has done amen
[1:20:10] amen hallelujah so it should it should
[1:20:14] produce such a thanksgiving because it's
[1:20:17] a season for it
[1:20:18] it's a season four revival it's a season
[1:20:21] for an awakening
[1:20:22] what it's the season for it now amram
[1:20:26] was stepping into a season that season
[1:20:29] was the deliverer had to be born
[1:20:32] to take israel out of egypt and and take
[1:20:34] them into the promised land
[1:20:36] and because there was now an atmosphere
[1:20:38] changing if i can put it that way
[1:20:40] because there is a hunger rising up in
[1:20:42] the people lord
[1:20:43] you promised you'd take us out of this
[1:20:45] place and you know why the world gets
[1:20:47] uncomfortable
[1:20:50] because god wants to make it that we
[1:20:52] want to leave
[1:20:54] hallelujah that's why this world gets
[1:20:56] uncomfortable for a believer
[1:20:57] it's not be you know we have the most
[1:20:59] you know if you think about naturally
[1:21:01] we're the most comfortable houses beds
[1:21:05] cars how hot do you want it
[1:21:08] how how how much you want to blow do you
[1:21:11] want this room to be this temperature
[1:21:13] do you want your seat warmer on your car
[1:21:14] hot medium you know
[1:21:16] how about your electric blanket you know
[1:21:18] do you want how thick do you want your
[1:21:19] puffer jacket to be
[1:21:20] yeah you can i mean there's you could
[1:21:22] man you could be comfortable eh
[1:21:25] but naturally that is the way you know
[1:21:28] we complain if our coffee's been you
[1:21:30] know roasted too long
[1:21:32] you know there's all this trouble it's
[1:21:34] been extracted about five seconds too
[1:21:36] long
[1:21:37] yeah this is you know because we get
[1:21:38] comfortable a certain way so naturally
[1:21:40] this world is very comfortable
[1:21:43] but spiritually to the believer it's
[1:21:45] very
[1:21:46] uncomfortable because the devil's
[1:21:49] released on the earth you know
[1:21:50] all those demons been released out of
[1:21:52] hell all those different things but it's
[1:21:54] meant to be that way
[1:21:55] because god doesn't want us to stay here
[1:21:57] he wants us to leave
[1:21:59] but there's got to be a cry in us lord
[1:22:03] the word has come open it's been for 50
[1:22:06] 60 years since the prophet was here
[1:22:08] we know you're still upon the earth lord
[1:22:09] your spirit's still here you're
[1:22:11] gathering your people
[1:22:12] but lord when will the last one come in
[1:22:14] that we can go home
[1:22:15] lord when will it be that we see the
[1:22:16] dead in christ rise and you change our
[1:22:18] bodies
[1:22:19] lord there's got to be a time lord might
[1:22:21] be now may not be later i don't want it
[1:22:23] to be ten years
[1:22:24] five years two years away but lord might
[1:22:26] be now i want to leave i want to be with
[1:22:28] you
[1:22:29] that should be the cry of our hearts
[1:22:31] hallelujah ultimately is lord i want to
[1:22:33] be where you are
[1:22:35] i don't just want to feel your presence
[1:22:36] so that is the greatest thing in all the
[1:22:38] world
[1:22:39] hallelujah i want to see you face to
[1:22:41] face i want to see the one who died for
[1:22:43] me
[1:22:43] redeem me hallelujah rose again
[1:22:46] justified me freely forever amen
[1:22:49] so so now there's a season changing
[1:22:53] hallelujah when the world is looking at
[1:22:56] a lot of other things the bride's
[1:22:57] looking at something else
[1:22:58] which is his promised word hallelujah so
[1:23:01] now amram began to pray
[1:23:04] because there's a season change and he
[1:23:07] prayed
[1:23:08] and he prayed and he was the kind of man
[1:23:11] that didn't take no for an answer
[1:23:13] although if god was silent he kept
[1:23:15] seeking him
[1:23:17] hallelujah he'd be beaten in the fields
[1:23:19] tired he went up and prayed
[1:23:21] he sought god because he knew the
[1:23:23] absolute of the word was a deliverer is
[1:23:25] going to be born
[1:23:26] and he's got to be born hallelujah well
[1:23:28] what if someone else let someone else
[1:23:30] pray for it but you know you know
[1:23:32] jehovah bed would say to him which was
[1:23:34] his wife can you let the boys you work
[1:23:36] with can you let them go pray
[1:23:37] he said but what if they don't do it
[1:23:40] because down in his jewish heart they
[1:23:42] bur
[1:23:42] burn to faith that no winds of doubt
[1:23:44] could ever blow out
[1:23:46] why because he had an absolute
[1:23:49] hallelujah he says so this isn't lifting
[1:23:52] him up out of history but today the
[1:23:54] people
[1:23:55] if they don't get everything they ask
[1:23:56] for the first time they pray
[1:23:58] they seem to think that he's dead what
[1:24:01] we need is men and women today of
[1:24:02] gallant spirit
[1:24:04] men and women who are determined to hold
[1:24:06] on till they see a god that really lives
[1:24:08] come into action
[1:24:10] they will not take no for an answer
[1:24:11] they're determined to stay with it
[1:24:13] if they are sick and the doctor says
[1:24:14] they can't get well yet something within
[1:24:16] them tells them they're going to get
[1:24:18] well
[1:24:18] hold on no matter what takes place have
[1:24:20] you joined the churches of the
[1:24:23] denominational world after you have
[1:24:25] swapped sapped all your strength from
[1:24:26] walking from place to place
[1:24:28] and you still can't find relief there is
[1:24:30] still a god that answers prayer and
[1:24:31] saves from sin
[1:24:32] and as we can see amram on those weary
[1:24:35] nights back bleeding climbing up the
[1:24:36] steps again
[1:24:38] until two and three o'clock in the
[1:24:39] morning praying and seemed like he was
[1:24:41] just talking to the wind
[1:24:43] down in his heart they're burned of
[1:24:44] faith that no winds of doubt could ever
[1:24:46] blow out
[1:24:46] there's a kind of men and women we need
[1:24:48] to rise on the scene today
[1:24:50] if he doesn't answer tonight he will
[1:24:52] answer tomorrow night
[1:24:54] if he doesn't answer this year he'll he
[1:24:56] will next year
[1:24:57] for he's a god not a god but the god
[1:25:00] and we see him night after night as
[1:25:02] amram climbed the steps and johaka bed
[1:25:04] would come up to him and say
[1:25:05] amram dear you've been up here all night
[1:25:08] praying
[1:25:09] why don't why don't you just tell some
[1:25:11] of the boys where you're working and let
[1:25:13] them pray a while
[1:25:14] he says well honey what if they don't do
[1:25:17] it somebody has got to do it somebody's
[1:25:19] has got to pray through
[1:25:21] and that's the way every christian ought
[1:25:22] to feel tonight not waiting for somebody
[1:25:25] else but take the front ourselves and go
[1:25:28] through
[1:25:28] if we believe the bible to be a history
[1:25:30] it's also a prophetic book
[1:25:32] that tells that the same god shall raise
[1:25:34] in the last days and it's time for him
[1:25:37] to come on the scene so amram had a
[1:25:40] absolute that god had to do it
[1:25:44] and that's why it drove him to prayer it
[1:25:46] wasn't him trying to manufacture this
[1:25:48] deliverer coming
[1:25:49] so it wasn't in here it wasn't his human
[1:25:52] ability how can i make the promise come
[1:25:53] to
[1:25:54] pass he knew it was god because he knew
[1:25:56] the promise
[1:25:57] this deliverer is going to come it was
[1:25:58] revealed to him so he's
[1:26:00] he's praying lord when is he going to
[1:26:01] come then you're following me
[1:26:04] and so what he did is he prayed because
[1:26:06] he knew it was it could only be god
[1:26:08] that could bring him forth but then
[1:26:10] moses is born
[1:26:13] and moses has been told by his mum that
[1:26:16] he is that promised child
[1:26:19] so he knows that he is this promised
[1:26:22] child
[1:26:23] but the problem is he doesn't have an
[1:26:25] absolute yet
[1:26:27] his absolute is just what his mom told
[1:26:29] them which was fair and true
[1:26:30] but it hadn't become a reality so what
[1:26:33] he begins to do is he says now how can i
[1:26:35] humanly deliver
[1:26:36] these people i have all this military
[1:26:38] training i'm a great leader
[1:26:40] i was a prince in the house you know
[1:26:41] pharaoh's house so how can i humanly do
[1:26:44] it because it was in here
[1:26:45] he knew he was he could do the job he
[1:26:47] was born to do the job it hadn't come
[1:26:49] down into here
[1:26:50] so now he's like now how physically can
[1:26:52] i make this happen
[1:26:54] and he sees his opportunity he kills an
[1:26:56] egyptian think this is going to spark a
[1:26:57] revolution
[1:26:59] but all it did was actually make him
[1:27:01] become a runaway prophet
[1:27:03] because his human ability was not what
[1:27:06] god wanted to use
[1:27:07] it was god's ability in his life he
[1:27:10] wanted the absolute of himself to come
[1:27:11] into moses and then show it happen
[1:27:14] amen see we have to
[1:27:18] come to our end when we come to our end
[1:27:21] of our own ability that's when god steps
[1:27:24] in
[1:27:25] that's what we have to come to amen
[1:27:28] we must realize that we our own ability
[1:27:33] is not what god wants to use
[1:27:37] you know in our own human ability to do
[1:27:38] it it's god's ability that he wants
[1:27:41] and so if we come to a spot
[1:27:45] where people just think well if god's
[1:27:47] going to do it he's going to do it and
[1:27:48] we quit
[1:27:49] then that's not the right kind of epi um
[1:27:52] attitude
[1:27:54] now i'm trying to read my notes here and
[1:27:56] and probably at the time i wrote them
[1:27:58] they made sense
[1:28:00] but my english is not really i wish it
[1:28:02] was my second language because that
[1:28:04] means i could defend myself
[1:28:06] somehow i got through school anyway but
[1:28:09] see it's like when we raise children
[1:28:11] okay now it makes sense to me you should
[1:28:12] see my handwriting oh boy
[1:28:14] sometimes i've got to turn it like this
[1:28:15] and make out what it says anyway you
[1:28:17] know
[1:28:17] it's like when we raise our children we
[1:28:19] realize god has to save them
[1:28:22] i'm glad i got some amens you know we
[1:28:25] realize they has to meet god like we've
[1:28:26] met god
[1:28:28] but if it becomes our own human ability
[1:28:30] trying to trying to control them in a
[1:28:32] certain way
[1:28:33] for them to become christians that's
[1:28:35] only in here
[1:28:36] right but when it anchors down into here
[1:28:39] lord
[1:28:40] your blood was for them just like for me
[1:28:42] repent be baptized everyone in the name
[1:28:44] of jesus christ for a mission of sin
[1:28:46] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:28:47] holy ghost promises to you and to your
[1:28:49] children
[1:28:50] right when that anchors down into here
[1:28:52] then what should that really do
[1:28:53] throw us into prayer and also a total
[1:28:56] surrender
[1:28:58] hallelujah that's what it really should
[1:28:59] do amen should throw us into a total
[1:29:02] surrender
[1:29:02] because we know a partially surrendered
[1:29:04] christian god can't use
[1:29:08] that may be a strong statement but you
[1:29:10] know brother brahm says in the message
[1:29:11] of total deliverance
[1:29:13] i like these kind of little i just like
[1:29:15] it
[1:29:16] he says now he says if you're a
[1:29:19] christian
[1:29:20] god don't make any halfway christians
[1:29:22] god makes complete christians
[1:29:24] god doesn't make halfway preachers but a
[1:29:27] preacher can be halfway
[1:29:29] and god makes his children christians
[1:29:31] but sometimes they're halfway christians
[1:29:35] now our god is not a halfway god
[1:29:38] what do you mean by halfway well he's
[1:29:39] about to explain it but if it's but it's
[1:29:41] not god's intentions for them to be that
[1:29:43] way
[1:29:44] it's their own ways got mixed up with
[1:29:46] the plans of god for their life
[1:29:49] and that what that's what makes them the
[1:29:51] way they are
[1:29:52] which is halfway so it's when we get our
[1:29:54] own plans mixed up with the plan of god
[1:29:57] that's how someone becomes a halfway
[1:29:59] christian but we're not made to be
[1:30:00] halfway
[1:30:02] right how's everyone right now everybody
[1:30:05] okay
[1:30:07] we're not called to be halfway
[1:30:08] christians but it's when we put our idea
[1:30:11] into it
[1:30:12] then that's how when we mix our own ways
[1:30:15] with the plan of god
[1:30:17] then that's what makes them them the way
[1:30:19] they are
[1:30:20] god doesn't want them to be halfway
[1:30:22] christians or halfway preachers
[1:30:23] compromising on either side
[1:30:25] he wants them to completely stand in the
[1:30:27] breach
[1:30:28] he says now moses god had made him a
[1:30:31] complete prophet for a complete
[1:30:32] deliverance and moses was completely
[1:30:35] surrendered to the hands of god
[1:30:37] that's the reason it made him what he
[1:30:38] was he was so complete and god
[1:30:40] till god could trust him so
[1:30:44] that's how so we know the plan of god is
[1:30:47] for our for our family to be saved
[1:30:50] right but it's when we mix our own
[1:30:52] ability and with it
[1:30:54] that's why i say it's so important if it
[1:30:56] anchors into our heart
[1:30:58] that the lord's salvation is for them
[1:31:01] then it should drive us to a total
[1:31:03] surrender
[1:31:04] and and it should drive us to prayer
[1:31:07] because if we're totally surrendered
[1:31:08] then god can totally use us
[1:31:10] amen and that's what we want amen amen
[1:31:13] and it should drive us to prayer just
[1:31:15] like amram said lord when is it going to
[1:31:17] happen lord you promise
[1:31:18] your promises deliver when is he going
[1:31:20] to come and he kept praying until he got
[1:31:22] an answer because he was revealed to him
[1:31:24] he was going to come
[1:31:25] hallelujah amen
[1:31:30] but we are here for a total deliverance
[1:31:32] amen this is the season for it
[1:31:35] this is not a season for a partial
[1:31:37] deliverance this is a season for a total
[1:31:39] deliverance
[1:31:40] amen where moses be when when he was
[1:31:43] totally in the hands of god
[1:31:44] that same man that just killed one
[1:31:46] egyptian became a runaway
[1:31:48] amen he became he became a mighty tool
[1:31:50] in god's hand
[1:31:52] hallelujah when he met god in the
[1:31:54] burning bush
[1:31:55] he received an absolute that absolute
[1:31:58] went from here i know i'm the deliverer
[1:32:01] to i'm sending you moses
[1:32:04] i'm sending you moses i've heard the cry
[1:32:06] of my people and i've come down
[1:32:08] and i'm sending you to do the job and
[1:32:10] then moses i can't speak i can't do this
[1:32:12] i can't do that and all the excuses is
[1:32:14] you
[1:32:14] he could throw in front of god and god
[1:32:16] just batted them all
[1:32:17] and said who made the mouth to speak
[1:32:19] amen god wasn't
[1:32:21] god wasn't feeling sorry for moses of
[1:32:23] all of his excuses
[1:32:25] god got angry at moses hallelujah
[1:32:28] that's why we could never yo the devil
[1:32:30] tries to give us all these excuses why
[1:32:32] we can't serve god
[1:32:34] but god just says no hold on amen hold
[1:32:36] on
[1:32:37] i'm here to make you a christian i'm
[1:32:40] here to be the christian in your life
[1:32:42] it's not you being the christian it's
[1:32:43] him as the christian in you that's the
[1:32:45] only way we can be christians
[1:32:47] hallelujah and that's why we need a
[1:32:49] total deliverance
[1:32:50] i mean because we're totally delivered
[1:32:52] from our thinking
[1:32:54] we really got to sometimes look like hit
[1:32:57] the rewind button on your on your
[1:32:58] thought process
[1:32:59] and press play and and listen to it
[1:33:04] you need to think about how you think
[1:33:06] because if you will
[1:33:07] walk along like a defeated always
[1:33:09] thinking defeated and always looking at
[1:33:11] the past and what went wrong and
[1:33:13] this happened here and i stuffed up here
[1:33:15] and i'll never achieve nothing here and
[1:33:17] this went wrong here and
[1:33:18] you know you you're gonna bring your
[1:33:20] past with you into the present
[1:33:22] and you become what you think right
[1:33:26] right so if you think defeated well
[1:33:28] you'll be defeated
[1:33:29] amen but if you think no i'm more than
[1:33:32] able because
[1:33:33] i'm more than a conqueror through him
[1:33:35] that loved me hallelujah
[1:33:37] i am his workmanship it's not me working
[1:33:40] on myself
[1:33:41] the scaffolding that's been put up is
[1:33:43] not my i'm not my own building project
[1:33:46] i'm god's building project i'm more than
[1:33:48] able to do it hallelujah
[1:33:50] because god is going to cause me to do
[1:33:51] it if we if we think defeated like if we
[1:33:54] if we're living in fear all the time
[1:33:56] that fear will come upon us
[1:33:58] sometimes people are scared to be about
[1:34:00] being scared
[1:34:02] we should not we shouldn't be scared
[1:34:03] about nothing
[1:34:05] because our god is able he totally
[1:34:08] delivered moses
[1:34:09] moses totally delivered the people
[1:34:11] hallelujah they left egypt
[1:34:13] they really did when when when moses
[1:34:15] received that absolute
[1:34:17] hallelujah he he went down into
[1:34:19] pharaoh's uh throne room he said let my
[1:34:21] people go
[1:34:22] and that absolute said you're gonna let
[1:34:24] he's gonna eventually
[1:34:26] let them go hallelujah because he had an
[1:34:30] absolute
[1:34:31] his absolute didn't change hallelujah
[1:34:35] because absolute couldn't change
[1:34:38] if you're absolute as someone else then
[1:34:40] they can change
[1:34:41] right if your absolute is the opinion of
[1:34:44] the world or even the church
[1:34:46] that absolutely will change but if
[1:34:49] you're absolute is the word of god
[1:34:51] then it won't change and you'll keep
[1:34:53] pushing on amen
[1:34:59] amen now
[1:35:06] moses took the people out because of an
[1:35:09] absolute
[1:35:11] our absolute must be i'm just gonna i'm
[1:35:13] just gonna
[1:35:14] wind this up but our absolute must be
[1:35:18] the lord jesus christ
[1:35:19] his word it must be it cannot be opinion
[1:35:23] it cannot be our own idea or our own
[1:35:25] thought it must be
[1:35:27] what god has declared
[1:35:30] paul was only as strong before he met
[1:35:33] the lord on the road to damascus
[1:35:35] as his organization
[1:35:39] he says here brother brahm says now
[1:35:40] since meeting him face to face
[1:35:44] i'll say this he says in any
[1:35:46] christ-centered life that's your
[1:35:47] absolute
[1:35:48] now since meeting him face to face on
[1:35:50] the road to damascus
[1:35:51] that meant so much to paul now remember
[1:35:54] he was a scholar beforehand he was a
[1:35:56] mighty man in the scriptures
[1:35:57] but he didn't have any thai post but the
[1:36:00] sanhedrin
[1:36:01] that that would back him up and a
[1:36:03] diploma and a great teacher
[1:36:05] he was a great man in his field but he
[1:36:08] was waiting
[1:36:09] only thing he had his absolute would
[1:36:12] only be as strong as his organization
[1:36:14] was
[1:36:15] that's all the stronger he could be
[1:36:18] but then he met the lord on the road to
[1:36:20] damascus and his absolute actually
[1:36:21] became an absolute
[1:36:22] unlimited in its power
[1:36:25] hallelujah
[1:36:28] so here we are and and i'm actually i
[1:36:30] just feel to close
[1:36:33] what is your absolute jesus christ if
[1:36:35] it's your opinion
[1:36:37] i would i would get rid of it if it's
[1:36:40] the word of god
[1:36:41] i would hold on to it remember
[1:36:44] this message is not a bunch of doctrine
[1:36:47] only
[1:36:48] it's not to form a different move it's
[1:36:50] jesus christ revealed
[1:36:52] hallelujah and when he becomes real to
[1:36:54] you
[1:36:55] it goes beyond tapes it goes beyond even
[1:36:57] a church or
[1:36:58] even even even income paper when he
[1:37:01] steps out
[1:37:01] and meets you that's what he wants to do
[1:37:05] then he becomes your absolute and that
[1:37:07] absolute will give you a stabilization
[1:37:09] in your life
[1:37:10] doesn't matter all storms may come and
[1:37:12] go but the peace of god you will know
[1:37:15] hallelujah even your own thinking may
[1:37:18] war against you hallelujah but if
[1:37:20] there's that absolute that absolute
[1:37:22] always come and fight for you when you
[1:37:23] need him
[1:37:26] amen so what's your absolute my absolute
[1:37:30] the love of god filled my heart by by a
[1:37:33] kitchen
[1:37:34] sink and i realized how much i love him
[1:37:37] because of how much he loved me and died
[1:37:38] for me on the cross
[1:37:39] and the bible became a new book and the
[1:37:42] message became alive
[1:37:44] it this became a personal letter to me
[1:37:49] and the word is unfolders i've walked
[1:37:51] with the lord
[1:37:52] but he's still the same absolute amen

[1:37:57] everything we do and what we believe
[1:37:59] take it back into the word
[1:38:01] from genesis to revelation from 47 to 65
[1:38:04] you know take the whole thing in
[1:38:05] continuity
[1:38:07] right but so so my absolute is not an
[1:38:11] argument
[1:38:13] my absolute is the lord jesus christ who
[1:38:15] stepped out of history to me so
[1:38:16] i leave you with that who's your
[1:38:18] absolute or what's
