[31:55] an amazing song to play as a special so
[31:57] we started to acquire a big group of
[32:00] young children
[32:02] to sing the song

[48:49] without condemnation lord
[48:51] father because you have taken care of it
[48:53] all lord jesus we come into your
[48:54] presence lord and you can take us in a
[48:56] rapture we love you with all our hearts
[48:58] this morning just want to ask lord may

[49:01] pour into us lord like never before
[49:04] lord may you just move in our hearts oh
[49:05] god we thank you for what you're doing
[49:07] in our midst lord we appreciate it so
[49:09] much just pray may you continue our god
[49:11] and lord we just want to just commit the
[49:13] service into your hands lord we always
[49:15] want to remember those who are sick and
[49:16] body couldn't be here today or think of
[49:19] lord stephen these are god may touch
[49:21] them and heal them father and you know
[49:22] announce lord jesus my robin lord and
[49:25] father be lord be their abundant portion
[49:27] o god and we thank you lord we love you
[49:29] and have your way in our midst lord in
[49:31] jesus christ's name amen
[49:33] amen god bless you friends you may have
[49:34] your seat so i want to talk about coming
[49:36] under the headship of redeeming love
[49:38] because because what you what the the
[49:41] your your leader is manifested in your
[49:44] life so if you're under the law you'll
[49:46] manifest the law right if you're un you
[49:49] know if you're if you're under the
[49:50] headship of this world you'll manifest
[49:52] this world but if christ has really met
[49:54] you really met you
[49:56] then then you'll be under the headship
[49:58] of redeeming love now now love you know
[50:01] the bible says where no vision is the
[50:03] people perish
[50:04] and so
[50:05] so if you have a vision then you cannot
[50:08] perish now redeeming loves give vision
[50:11] it gives vision now vision what i mean
[50:12] by vision it it reveals to you the end
[50:14] goal
[50:15] right so you're not just stabbing and
[50:17] you're fighting the air or you're
[50:19] stabbing the dark but but you see by
[50:21] revelation the end goal so when it comes
[50:23] to your family you see the end goal that
[50:26] they're made in the image of the lord
[50:27] they love the lord jesus christ he's
[50:29] filled them with the holy ghost and
[50:31] there and that makes them rapture ready
[50:33] that is the end goal
[50:34] right but but in order for
[50:36] in order for that to be manifested in
[50:39] them it must come down through the
[50:41] father or the mother into you know if
[50:43] their headship's not there come through
[50:44] them to the children right so it's very
[50:47] important that we that we have this kind
[50:50] of vision now i just wanted to to to me
[50:52] this this scripture here i want to leave
[50:54] it up for a little bit
[50:55] it encapsulates being under redeeming
[50:57] love because you look at rachel because
[50:59] the real love of god is a redemptive
[51:01] love so it takes the people from the
[51:03] muck and mire of sin and darkness
[51:05] under the change of the devil liberates
[51:07] them and places them in their position
[51:09] that god ordained for them before the
[51:11] foundation of the world
[51:13] right so it's a redeeming it's a it's a
[51:14] picking up lifting up and putting their
[51:16] ordained position so rachel was always
[51:19] ordained to be in the family of israel
[51:21] like she was not ordained to stay out of
[51:24] the promised land amen so when jacob
[51:26] loved her to me it was more than just a
[51:28] human love but it was a redeeming love
[51:30] because christ is revealed in jacob
[51:31] right so so his love for her took her
[51:34] from being outside the promised land
[51:37] being united into the promise of god
[51:39] through marriage right and then for her
[51:41] to live in the promised land that she'd
[51:43] be buried in the place of resurrection
[51:45] so so you see here this love now because
[51:48] he saw the end goal as she because he
[51:50] loved her
[51:52] then these seven years seemed but a few
[51:54] days
[51:55] because he had vision
[51:57] we're gonna get married he had vision
[51:59] that she was part of him
[52:01] right it was more than just i love her
[52:03] because of she's beautiful but he had a
[52:06] revelation she is part of me
[52:08] right so now just as christ has because
[52:10] he knows that you're part of him but
[52:12] there but that revelation needs to drop
[52:14] into our hearts
[52:15] right because love makes it easy
[52:18] because you think about this this is
[52:19] seven years he was a shepherd for his
[52:21] father-in-law there would have been
[52:23] times of great
[52:24] struggle
[52:26] there would have been you know very cold
[52:27] winters
[52:28] maybe sickness would come through the
[52:30] flock maybe maybe wolves and lions would
[52:32] come against the flock you know maybe
[52:34] he'd be sick in his body himself and
[52:36] he'd have to go after stray animal you
[52:38] know stray sheep and you know maybe a
[52:40] troubled lambing season you know some
[52:41] would die and you know there'd be
[52:43] hardship
[52:44] there'd be times of stress and great
[52:46] turmoil because he had a because he was
[52:48] commissioned this was his job
[52:50] for yo yo that he had to look after the
[52:52] flocks but you see it seem but a few
[52:55] days
[52:56] because of love
[52:58] right so now if people do not have the
[53:00] vision of redeeming love life becomes
[53:03] frustrating
[53:04] [Music]
[53:05] right but if you have if you really know
[53:07] the lord if you really love him
[53:10] it seems that a few days and it's easy
[53:12] right it does because remember being a
[53:14] christian does not make us it doesn't
[53:16] take away trouble
[53:17] right love is not an absence of trouble
[53:20] right love is not an absence of of
[53:22] hardship and questions and turmoil no
[53:24] love overrides those things
[53:26] love overcomes those things see so
[53:29] that's why it's so important that that i
[53:32] trust our lives are like this
[53:34] right you can see your family maybe
[53:36] things are in disarray but because of
[53:37] love
[53:38] you can look beyond that and because
[53:40] you've got a revelation of the end goal
[53:43] we're gonna go and a body change
[53:44] together you can look beyond the fault
[53:46] right it gives you vision you you look
[53:48] beyond the surface
[53:51] amen now we're living in a day now so i
[53:53] don't have um
[53:55] oh wait maybe i could fight uh see with
[53:57] technology
[53:58] the greatness thereof
[54:00] i should be able to drive it from here
[54:01] but i'll just have it like this now
[54:03] now so brother braham says this this is
[54:05] an um this is an um
[54:07] uh i've heard but now i see
[54:09] he says i want to speak on a subject
[54:10] that alarmed me today when brother moore
[54:13] and i were talking out today my precious
[54:15] brethren were discussing script uh
[54:16] scriptures and how lovely it was to be
[54:18] with them brothers like old times and he
[54:20] said you know brother branham all the
[54:22] preaching he ever done for us here in
[54:23] shreveport the lamb of the devil is one
[54:25] of the most outstanding messages you
[54:27] ever brought us here at shreveport so i
[54:29] guess with your message so strenuous to
[54:30] you today you never get you never get to
[54:33] one like that and brother says well if i
[54:36] miss that i miss my message
[54:38] he says he says he says love is my his
[54:41] dear dying lamb my precious blood shall
[54:43] never lose its power till all the ransom
[54:45] church of god be saved to sin no more
[54:47] ever since by faith i saw that stream
[54:49] thy flowing wound supplying redeeming
[54:51] love has been my theme and shall be till
[54:53] i die so you're saying that the theme of
[54:55] the message was redeeming love
[54:57] right and so and so here so see it so
[55:00] shocked him alarmed him when when
[55:02] brother maul was thinking you know
[55:03] you've got away from that he says no no
[55:05] this is the theme of my message
[55:07] you know that redeeming love is the
[55:09] theme of the message it's not just
[55:10] something that's tacked on or adoption
[55:12] but it's actually the heart of the
[55:13] message is redeeming love that god would
[55:15] come and find us in our unbelief in
[55:17] darkness and he would lift us up by the
[55:19] power of the blood and make his joint
[55:21] ears with him amen that you know that is
[55:24] the theme of the message right so but
[55:26] if we are under that headship then it
[55:28] will be manifested through our lives
[55:30] right because you cannot say you love
[55:32] god and hate someone that's right
[55:34] right you cannot do that you cannot have
[55:36] ought between you know if you love god
[55:38] if you know that's manifested by i love
[55:41] you
[55:41] if i say i love jesus don't love you
[55:43] well then there's a problem i don't
[55:44] actually love god i think i do but i
[55:46] don't
[55:47] you see so it's very
[55:50] it's very important that this is the
[55:52] theme
[55:53] of our lives now if we have vision
[55:56] we can look beyond and see the end goal
[55:58] for our families
[55:59] we can bear them like the lord would
[56:01] bear the children of israel out of egypt
[56:03] now this remember deuteronomy is the
[56:05] last the last uh you could say sermon
[56:07] that that moses would give the children
[56:09] of israel before he is taken off the
[56:11] scene and says the lord so this is 40
[56:13] odd years this is 40 years in the
[56:14] wilderness you know that mark this is
[56:17] how long god has been leading them
[56:19] through you know through the prophet
[56:20] moses and now they're coming to a
[56:22] junction where moses is going to go off
[56:23] the scene and joshua's going to take
[56:25] them into the land he says the lord your
[56:26] god which god before you he shall fight
[56:28] for you according to all that he did for
[56:30] you in egypt before your eyes and in the
[56:32] wilderness when thou has seen how that
[56:34] the lord thy god bear thee as a man doth
[56:38] bear his son in all the way that he went
[56:40] until you came into this place now
[56:44] you see see this is the redeeming love
[56:46] of god see see this see being a
[56:48] christian is not is not the strong
[56:50] survive only
[56:51] right this is not the only this is not
[56:53] darwinism we're only the strong survivor
[56:56] no no everyone's going
[56:58] right but you see you see their journey
[57:00] from egypt into the promised land is was
[57:03] actually dictated to by the young
[57:05] it wasn't by the strong it wasn't by the
[57:07] youth and their strength that they could
[57:09] you know march faster and carry more and
[57:11] do more no no it was by the young that
[57:13] their walk was actually dictated to by
[57:16] so it was the young that were looked
[57:17] after because he says i bear thee as a
[57:19] as a father would bear his son which
[57:21] means carry
[57:22] right so now we got an education of this
[57:25] when we traveled to canada going through
[57:27] customs and being on airplanes and
[57:28] things where it was just chrissy and i
[57:30] we just marched through customs go go
[57:31] done done fun but we had children that
[57:33] we had to keep in mind of and they did
[57:35] exceptionally well
[57:36] they did incredibly well traveling but
[57:38] you think it's weird to keep in our
[57:40] minds how they doing are they okay they
[57:42] were jet lagged they hadn't had any
[57:43] sleep you know we're going through
[57:44] customs and different things but but
[57:46] traveling was totally different because
[57:48] our minds are on our children getting
[57:49] there as well
[57:51] see god doesn't leave us behind amen
[57:53] right he doesn't leave us behind you
[57:55] think well i'm struggling he will wait
[57:56] for you and walk with you
[57:59] amen but but this is how we must see
[58:02] our own families
[58:03] and and one another is god is here to
[58:06] bear us as a man would his son
[58:09] to carry us through
[58:11] you say i'm weak i can't journey it's
[58:12] fine god will pick you up
[58:15] he'll carry you along he's not going to
[58:16] leave you behind
[58:18] right so we need to we need to keep this
[58:20] in mind
[58:22] it's very
[58:22] important
[58:24] amen
[58:25] why because redeeming love should be our
[58:28] thing
[58:30] amen now
[58:32] john says here it says beloved let us
[58:34] love one another for love is of god and
[58:36] everyone that loveth is born of god and
[58:38] knoweth god he that loveth not knoweth
[58:41] not god for god is love
[58:43] but in
[58:44] and this was manifested the love of god
[58:46] towards us because that god seen his
[58:47] only begotten son into the world that we
[58:50] might live through him here in his love
[58:52] not that we loved god but that he loved
[58:54] us and he sent his son to be the
[58:56] propitiation for our sins if god so
[58:58] loved us we ought also to love one
[59:00] another
[59:01] i mean no man has seen god at any time
[59:03] if we love one another god dwelleth in
[59:06] us for his love is perfect perfected in
[59:08] us hereby know we that we dwell in him
[59:11] and he is in us because he hath given us
[59:13] of his spirit
[59:14] i mean so you can have all the doctrine
[59:16] in the world you can have all the
[59:18] knowledge in the world
[59:20] but if you don't have the love of god if
[59:21] you don't love the brethren yet the
[59:23] spirit of god's not in you amen right
[59:25] because love it's redeeming love is our
[59:28] theme now brother brown makes a
[59:29] statement i don't have the quote up here
[59:31] he says you can even love god and still
[59:32] be lost but he's speaking to the ladies
[59:34] and church age where people can have an
[59:36] imagination they love god but they don't
[59:38] love god in the right way because if you
[59:40] if you love god in the right way you'll
[59:41] surrender to his word
[59:43] why because he is his word
[59:45] amen but and also the ladies in church
[59:47] ages christ is on the outside of the
[59:48] church he says if any man hear my voice
[59:51] let him open the door i'll come in and
[59:52] sup with him and he with me and we've
[59:54] heard that voice
[59:56] i mean god has spoken in this generation
[59:58] he says he says i want to come in i want
[1:00:00] to i want to have fellowship with you i
[1:00:02] want to stop with you and you with me i
[1:00:04] mean to have heard his voice you've
[1:00:05] heard his word we've entered into a
[1:00:07] communion
[1:00:09] amen and what should that communion
[1:00:10] produce a love
[1:00:12] i mean this is a love feast that we're
[1:00:14] having right now you know
[1:00:16] this is why our walk is it's a this is a
[1:00:18] lot remember this is a love letter
[1:00:20] amen this is a walk of love with our god
[1:00:22] that his banner over us is love amen
[1:00:25] right
[1:00:26] amen
[1:00:28] praise the lord if we love him because
[1:00:30] we fir we love him because he first
[1:00:32] loved us if any man say i love god and
[1:00:34] hateth his brother he is a liar for he
[1:00:36] that loveth not his brother whom he has
[1:00:38] seen how can he love god and whom he has
[1:00:41] not seen for this commandment we have
[1:00:43] from him that we he who loveth god love
[1:00:45] his brother also amen i mean because if
[1:00:48] you get frustrated remember iron
[1:00:50] sharpens iron right so we have different
[1:00:52] personalities and god said well i have a
[1:00:54] tailor-made tool to shape you
[1:00:56] and he brings that tool here and you
[1:00:58] fell a ship together because it's
[1:01:00] tailor-made maybe a grid of sandpaper or
[1:01:02] a planer or you're a different
[1:01:04] it's the right tool for the job the
[1:01:05] right personality will will shape you
[1:01:08] the right way amen right but you see now
[1:01:11] if you if you do not have that capstone
[1:01:13] of divine love upon your life you will
[1:01:15] not see that
[1:01:16] and you'll get frustrated
[1:01:18] because you're looking at the now
[1:01:20] right but god has an end goal in it in
[1:01:22] his mind which is your perfection of and
[1:01:25] i mean that in terms of your maturity
[1:01:28] and him right because the blood of jesus
[1:01:29] christ reflects us amen but we have to
[1:01:31] grow immaturity
[1:01:33] now
[1:01:36] now we'll go here love god is love he
[1:01:38] that loveth is of god divine love not
[1:01:41] affectionate love there's two different
[1:01:42] kinds of love no brother andy preacher
[1:01:44] very good sermon on this now now we know
[1:01:46] we get into here um we we get into this
[1:01:50] free love and all kinds of stuff called
[1:01:52] love but it's not divine love it's a
[1:01:54] mockery of the devil you know that
[1:01:55] there's two different kinds of love
[1:01:57] there's a love called felio love and
[1:01:58] there's love called agapo love affiliate
[1:02:00] love the greek word means the love that
[1:02:03] like i would have for you as a as a
[1:02:05] fellow or my wife you have uh for your
[1:02:08] wife affiliate love now that love if
[1:02:10] you'd catch you'd be jealous of her if
[1:02:13] you catch a man insulting her you'd kill
[1:02:14] the man for it that's feel your love but
[1:02:16] a guppy love would make you pray for his
[1:02:19] lost soul that's the difference that's
[1:02:21] where people don't understand see
[1:02:23] it ain't some kind of an effectual
[1:02:25] worked up mental condition it's
[1:02:26] absolutely a genuine holy spirit of god
[1:02:29] that binds our hearts together in
[1:02:30] christian fellowship and love and i
[1:02:32] thought it was very striking he was me
[1:02:34] he was speaking about this and where i
[1:02:35] think pentecost failed
[1:02:37] he's saying the movement of pentecost
[1:02:39] failed he's saying well why did it fail
[1:02:40] because it didn't have the right kind of
[1:02:42] love
[1:02:44] right yes and you say well we're in the
[1:02:46] message this is different no no man is
[1:02:47] still the same
[1:02:49] that we can fall short of the glory of
[1:02:51] god because of a lack of the right kind
[1:02:52] of love
[1:02:54] right because remember brother braham
[1:02:56] says when the holy ghost comes into you
[1:02:57] it's like the size of a button and it
[1:02:59] grows and pushes out everything but
[1:03:01] you've got to let it push out all the
[1:03:02] business and complexes hurts and pains
[1:03:04] you've got to let it push out now if
[1:03:06] there's real divine love because of that
[1:03:07] holy ghost coming into you you will let
[1:03:09] it push it out
[1:03:10] right because you've seen because
[1:03:12] remember god has god knows the bride
[1:03:16] right he knows you he knows you're you
[1:03:18] are bone of his bone flesh with his
[1:03:19] flesh life is life that you are him
[1:03:22] right because you're married to him he
[1:03:23] knows that yes but he needs you to know
[1:03:25] that
[1:03:26] right that's why he pours he doesn't
[1:03:28] need revelation we're the ones who need
[1:03:30] revelation right because revelation is
[1:03:32] him sharing his heart with you
[1:03:34] right it's not head knowledge it's him
[1:03:35] sharing his heart with you that you
[1:03:37] begin to think and know as he knows you
[1:03:40] right so now you've got you've got to
[1:03:42] surrender to it to let it grow in you
[1:03:44] right people who put up walls and things
[1:03:46] you know they're not we have to be
[1:03:47] willing to overcome our own complexes
[1:03:50] right if we don't do that how can we
[1:03:51] ever have redeeming love for our
[1:03:53] families
[1:03:54] right you cannot if you're if you're a
[1:03:56] complex is a stronghold of the enemy but
[1:03:58] if but pride will stop people actually
[1:04:00] getting rid of complexes
[1:04:02] and so we've got to be willing to
[1:04:04] surrender our pride
[1:04:05] surrender our complex and let god grow
[1:04:08] in us right we just don't want a bitter
[1:04:10] god i want all the ideas i want to find
[1:04:12] the boundaries to this thing and you
[1:04:14] won't be able to because he's eternal
[1:04:15] but let's
[1:04:16] let's go on an adventure you know let's
[1:04:18] find the heights and the brits the
[1:04:19] depths and the wits you know all the
[1:04:20] goddess i mean not just a
[1:04:22] two-dimensional walk but a
[1:04:23] three-dimensional
[1:04:25] mean i say seven dimensional what are
[1:04:27] you wrong but you know everything that
[1:04:28] he is right
[1:04:29] that's what we want so we need to have
[1:04:31] the right kind of love not this free
[1:04:33] love and the world is full of free love
[1:04:35] people live with different partners
[1:04:36] whatever more all this kind of crazy
[1:04:38] stuff no that's not love
[1:04:40] but the kind of love that you if you
[1:04:42] have the
[1:04:44] redeeming love then you'll pray for that
[1:04:45] person amen amen you'll have a be and if
[1:04:48] you have redeeming love you can act as
[1:04:50] it as standing in the gap you can stand
[1:04:53] in the gap for that person
[1:04:55] even if they cannot do it you can do it
[1:04:56] see moses was commissioned to be one who
[1:04:59] would stand in the gap between israel
[1:05:00] and god
[1:05:02] right but when he got frustrated and
[1:05:03] smote the rock then he left that he fell
[1:05:05] from that position and he just caused
[1:05:07] judgment to come upon himself and upon
[1:05:09] the people right so but but we're we're
[1:05:11] called now remember
[1:05:13] there's power in an office
[1:05:16] you know you take you take donald trump
[1:05:18] right
[1:05:19] before he was president he was just a
[1:05:22] celebrity then he became president he
[1:05:24] was a possessing in office
[1:05:25] but then when he was kicked out of that
[1:05:28] office now all he is is a political
[1:05:30] agitator
[1:05:31] so he's just he's just fussing and
[1:05:33] causing trouble sure he's wrong i'm not
[1:05:35] saying biden's doing everything fine i'm
[1:05:37] not talking about that but he has no
[1:05:38] authority of the office he is once in
[1:05:41] because he was kicked out of it right so
[1:05:43] now he's just a political agitator you
[1:05:44] take someone who is meant to be in the
[1:05:46] office of father or mother or whatever
[1:05:48] it is or even even children in a family
[1:05:49] it's all a position
[1:05:51] if someone's kicked you know if
[1:05:52] someone's not willing to surrender to
[1:05:54] actually possess that office to lay
[1:05:56] their humanity aside and possess that
[1:05:58] office because of pride or a complex
[1:06:00] right then all they are is a political
[1:06:02] agitator all they will as fast as you
[1:06:05] and this is wrong and that is wrong but
[1:06:07] but someone under the divine love can
[1:06:09] get the answer
[1:06:10] which is god himself stepping on the
[1:06:12] scene and undertaking yes
[1:06:15] right so this is why we've got a you
[1:06:16] know remember your life is a
[1:06:18] manifestation of the headship you're
[1:06:19] under
[1:06:21] amen so i trust we can say we're under
[1:06:23] the headship of redeeming love
[1:06:26] even even as a sister you know say
[1:06:28] husbands can be doing whatever they want
[1:06:29] but if you have the lord if you really
[1:06:31] know god you can stand in that office
[1:06:34] and stand even even if there's a void of
[1:06:37] headship
[1:06:38] right spiritual headship now
[1:06:41] we read this here in ephesians yeah it's
[1:06:42] amazing mate let's just let's just jump
[1:06:44] here so so we're going to read this but
[1:06:46] let's just jump here now brother graham
[1:06:48] says in the message paradox here that
[1:06:49] there'll be ephesians again at the end
[1:06:51] of the ages
[1:06:52] right so so keep this in mind because
[1:06:55] you think about the ephesian church
[1:06:57] they're a very spiritual church yo he
[1:06:58] your brother abraham said that paul
[1:07:00] could teach the depths of christ to them
[1:07:02] but he couldn't teach that same thing to
[1:07:04] the corinthians because they were still
[1:07:05] babes right fussing and being carnal
[1:07:07] saying i like this ministry above this
[1:07:09] ministry and this person above this
[1:07:10] person nothing wrong with the ministries
[1:07:12] but carnality of man will lean one way
[1:07:15] to another we need the whole five-fold
[1:07:16] ministry right so we can't just lean
[1:07:18] against while i like evangelism or just
[1:07:20] like teaching no no we need the whole
[1:07:21] thing
[1:07:22] i mean so so that's why it's important
[1:07:24] that we can receive a gift of god that's
[1:07:26] placed in our midst right amen or would
[1:07:28] come but you see so so he's going to be
[1:07:30] in ephesians again now that ephesians
[1:07:32] remember they came to a junction a
[1:07:34] crossroad where they could either aim at
[1:07:36] and become you know grown to the
[1:07:38] fullness of christ
[1:07:39] or they could actually aim it but not
[1:07:41] become and relax now the word ephesians
[1:07:44] in the greek means aimed at but relax so
[1:07:46] that's all they could do they came that
[1:07:47] crossroad but they are anointed
[1:07:49] unfortunately to go to a map but relax
[1:07:51] and eventually the church had gone to
[1:07:52] the dark ages because it was ordained to
[1:07:54] do so he says now but we've come to an
[1:07:56] affections against in other words we've
[1:07:57] come to that crossroad again
[1:07:59] but as i said a couple of sundays ago
[1:08:01] were anointed not to aim at and to relax
[1:08:04] but to become
[1:08:05] right so when they turned off left we're
[1:08:07] going straight
[1:08:08] amen but it's got to be an individual
[1:08:10] walk this is not a collective walk we do
[1:08:12] not go we're not going in a rapture
[1:08:14] because you sit in these four walls
[1:08:15] twice a week
[1:08:18] church starts at home
[1:08:20] church trouble starts at home
[1:08:23] right church trouble starts because
[1:08:24] there's no harmony in the marriage
[1:08:27] right if we have strong families you
[1:08:28] have a strong church
[1:08:30] amen amen so now look at this so you
[1:08:32] keep that all in mind so paul taught the
[1:08:34] depths of of christ to the ephesians but
[1:08:37] then he had to come down and say
[1:08:38] husbands love your wives
[1:08:41] isn't that such a strange thing really
[1:08:42] think about it because he's teaching the
[1:08:43] depths
[1:08:44] of the inheritance of the saints and
[1:08:46] everything that they are but then he
[1:08:47] comes out to his husband's you gotta
[1:08:48] love your wife
[1:08:50] so what he's trying to what he's telling
[1:08:52] them to say you have all this revelation
[1:08:54] but you got to realize this revelation
[1:08:56] has to come down to everyday life yes
[1:08:58] right your everyday life is a
[1:09:00] manifestation of your revelation
[1:09:02] right so now if you realize just like
[1:09:04] you know says his husbands love your
[1:09:06] wives even as christ also loved the
[1:09:08] church and gave himself for it that he
[1:09:10] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[1:09:11] washing of the water by the word that he
[1:09:14] might present it to himself a glorious
[1:09:15] church not having spot or wrinkle or any
[1:09:17] such thing that it should be holy and
[1:09:19] without blemish so or mean to love their
[1:09:21] wives as their own bodies he that loveth
[1:09:23] his wife loveth himself
[1:09:25] so if you really love yourself in the
[1:09:27] right way you'll love your wife
[1:09:29] i was expecting a bit more of a volume
[1:09:31] of that age
[1:09:33] thank you very much praise the lord for
[1:09:36] no man ever yet hateth his own flesh but
[1:09:39] nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the
[1:09:41] lord the church for members of his body
[1:09:43] and of his flesh of his bones for this
[1:09:45] course shall a man leave his father and
[1:09:47] mother and shall be joined unto the wife
[1:09:49] and they too shall be one flesh so it's
[1:09:51] so important that there's no outside
[1:09:54] influence of a family that actually
[1:09:55] controls
[1:09:56] you know the chur you know the church or
[1:09:58] the family
[1:10:00] right that that we don't live a life to
[1:10:01] please someone else
[1:10:03] right we're not living through someone
[1:10:04] else's expectations
[1:10:06] but we're we are living under the
[1:10:08] influence of the word
[1:10:09] remember every family is sovereign right
[1:10:11] so we don't do all things the same
[1:10:13] that's fine because we're you know
[1:10:14] because we're built differently but i
[1:10:16] don't live my life to try and please
[1:10:18] someone else
[1:10:20] right i'm not trying to have this church
[1:10:21] to please another church
[1:10:23] so that's that that's an outside
[1:10:25] influence trying to control
[1:10:27] no they may have good intentions but you
[1:10:29] know good intentions can be a big
[1:10:30] trouble true you know but you're gonna
[1:10:32] be living a life that you know you're
[1:10:33] pleasing the lord
[1:10:35] right because and your family should be
[1:10:36] lord i want my family to be pleasing
[1:10:38] unto you and by how do you do that you
[1:10:40] stand in the gap for them like job he
[1:10:42] would offer sacrifices lisa's children
[1:10:45] sinned
[1:10:46] right she'd lift them into presence well
[1:10:48] he he would offer a physical lamb but
[1:10:50] now we have a perfect land the lamb of
[1:10:52] god but how you can stand in the gap is
[1:10:53] intercede for them say lord forgive them
[1:10:56] i want to come to stand in the gap and
[1:10:57] because if you're possessing that office
[1:10:59] you can
[1:11:00] rise is not out of just a ritual but you
[1:11:02] can actually be in prayer and stand
[1:11:04] between
[1:11:05] i mean stand in the gap amen for your
[1:11:07] family intercede for them
[1:11:09] amen just like abraham interceded for
[1:11:11] lot when judgment was coming so we can
[1:11:13] intercede for our family because we know
[1:11:15] judgment is here
[1:11:17] amen it's coming right
[1:11:19] but you see he's trying to tell the
[1:11:21] ephesians look you know
[1:11:22] um you and your wife are actually one
[1:11:25] you're not two different people
[1:11:27] so they had all this great revelation
[1:11:29] but they but he had to remind them love
[1:11:31] your wives yeah you know
[1:11:33] because he's trying to get them to see
[1:11:35] actually the man
[1:11:36] the relationship you have with your
[1:11:38] spouse is actually a reflection of the
[1:11:40] relationship you have with god
[1:11:42] right
[1:11:43] so so the thing is now we should never
[1:11:46] ever ever tear down our spouses
[1:11:48] sure that's right yes
[1:11:52] yeah my hearing rate it is on
[1:11:55] did you have to think about that first
[1:11:57] that's crazy no seriously if you tear
[1:12:00] down your spouse you don't have a
[1:12:01] revelation that she and you're one or
[1:12:03] here and you're one if you if you take
[1:12:06] on someone else's opinion of your spouse
[1:12:08] you don't have that revelation
[1:12:10] because you should be a shield for your
[1:12:12] spouse someone runs them down say hold
[1:12:14] on i don't care what you say about me
[1:12:15] don't talk about my family
[1:12:17] that's when you see papa bear and he's
[1:12:19] not nice
[1:12:20] you'll hear about it and you won't like
[1:12:22] it because i don't care about me but you
[1:12:24] see that's why the thing you realize
[1:12:26] that you know but if people
[1:12:28] if we if we don't have that revelation
[1:12:31] then you'll take on someone's opinion of
[1:12:33] them
[1:12:35] right and you will tear them down we're
[1:12:37] not here to tear down we had to build up
[1:12:39] remember if
[1:12:40] if if a capstone of grace is upon you
[1:12:44] of divine love redeeming love
[1:12:46] then you will live this out
[1:12:52] that's your angle i want to see my
[1:12:53] family grow in the lord
[1:12:55] i want to see them more stable in their
[1:12:57] walk i want to see them love her more
[1:12:59] not to tear them down and do no no a
[1:13:01] tearing down is because of frustration
[1:13:03] our frustration is because a lack of
[1:13:04] revelation
[1:13:06] that's what people get from because the
[1:13:08] reason frustration comes is because you
[1:13:10] don't have the answer
[1:13:12] right
[1:13:12] but if you have the answer you won't get
[1:13:14] frustrated
[1:13:15] sure you may try
[1:13:17] humanly there's always that but no he
[1:13:18] said no no no
[1:13:19] i have the answer the lord is the answer
[1:13:21] you can look beyond the here and now
[1:13:23] and frustration and adult tensions is
[1:13:25] because of loss of control
[1:13:28] right so you see we've got to have a
[1:13:29] revelation that we are one amen you know
[1:13:32] and also if you are one wait let's just
[1:13:35] keep going because i've got a picture i
[1:13:36] want to show you but we're just gonna
[1:13:37] let's just let's just run to this a bit
[1:13:39] we'll get there now
[1:13:41] it's very interesting where where peter
[1:13:43] speaks about but you know brother man
[1:13:45] takes us to the statue of the perfect
[1:13:46] man now we're going to read down through
[1:13:48] um i want to get to a verse but he says
[1:13:50] according us his divine power has given
[1:13:52] unto us all things that pertain unto
[1:13:53] life and godliness through the knowledge
[1:13:55] of him that hath called us to glory
[1:13:58] uh and virtue whereby we are given unto
[1:14:01] us exceeding great and precious promises
[1:14:03] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:14:05] the divine nature having escaped the
[1:14:07] corruption that is in the world through
[1:14:08] lust so he's given us these great and
[1:14:10] precious promises
[1:14:11] right and this is what he's going to do
[1:14:13] and besides this giving all diligence
[1:14:15] add to your faith virtue
[1:14:17] and to virtue knowledge and knowledge
[1:14:19] patience and knowledge temperance
[1:14:21] through temperance patience patience
[1:14:22] godliness and to godless brotherly
[1:14:24] kindness and to brotherly kindness
[1:14:26] charity now we know charity is divine
[1:14:28] love so the cap of the building is
[1:14:30] divine love right now if these things be
[1:14:33] in you and abound they make you that you
[1:14:34] be neither
[1:14:36] uh barren or unfruitful in the knowledge
[1:14:38] of our lord jesus christ but notice this
[1:14:40] but he that lacketh these things is
[1:14:42] blind
[1:14:43] and cannot see afar off and has
[1:14:45] forgotten that he was purged from his
[1:14:47] own
[1:14:48] sins
[1:14:49] so if you do not have these virtues in
[1:14:51] you by the holy ghost you cannot see
[1:14:54] he's not talking about natural side he's
[1:14:56] talking about spiritual science so if
[1:14:58] there's no remember remember your life
[1:15:00] is a manifestation of your revelation
[1:15:02] right you can say you know all the
[1:15:03] mysteries but what is your life
[1:15:04] producing
[1:15:06] see so because so if if god if you've
[1:15:08] really received the holy ghost that
[1:15:10] capstone of divine love's come upon your
[1:15:11] life you can see a pharaoh you're not
[1:15:14] blind you can look beyond what you see
[1:15:16] and what's manifesting in front of you
[1:15:18] and you can look to the unseen to the
[1:15:20] promise of god and say god your promise
[1:15:22] is greater than what i see with my
[1:15:24] natural line that faith is greater than
[1:15:26] what you see and you do not walk
[1:15:28] according by what you see with your
[1:15:29] sight what your children doing your
[1:15:31] family is doing or whatever it's doing
[1:15:33] you can look beyond that to the promise
[1:15:34] of god and you can hold on to the
[1:15:36] promise of god and account that
[1:15:38] as reality above what you see uh right
[1:15:41] in front of you
[1:15:42] it means that's why we should never ever
[1:15:44] look at the physical reality because
[1:15:46] it's not actually reality it's gonna
[1:15:48] pass away but look at the promise of god
[1:15:50] because that is your reality
[1:15:53] amen
[1:15:55] but the devil doesn't want you to look
[1:15:56] beyond that's right
[1:15:58] all right
[1:16:00] so here that lack of these things is
[1:16:01] blind and cannot see your off i pray we
[1:16:03] have sight
[1:16:05] remember remember it said for this age
[1:16:08] come by me isaf yes
[1:16:10] this word is an isaac it actually takes
[1:16:12] the matter out of your eyes
[1:16:14] opens your spiritual eyes is what the
[1:16:16] word does by the washing of the water of
[1:16:17] the word and god wants to give a
[1:16:19] spiritual sight
[1:16:21] hallelujah so you see see if we can see
[1:16:23] it far off we can have we have redeeming
[1:16:25] love
[1:16:26] because i'm looking beyond i i may be
[1:16:27] repeating myself i really want this to
[1:16:29] stick
[1:16:30] amen i really want it to stick
[1:16:33] amen
[1:16:34] yes lord no
[1:16:35] see
[1:16:36] see if we have redeeming love in our
[1:16:38] lives we can look to the unseen
[1:16:40] but while we look not at the things
[1:16:41] which are seen but at the things which
[1:16:43] are not seen for the things which are
[1:16:45] seen are temporal but the things which
[1:16:46] are not seen are eternal
[1:16:49] so the current
[1:16:50] stage that we're in the current stage
[1:16:53] our family's in whatever trouble
[1:16:54] remember sin is temporal
[1:16:56] unbelief is temporal
[1:16:58] right that spirit is temporal
[1:17:00] that thing trying to destroy is temporal
[1:17:02] but we've got to look to the eternal
[1:17:04] because the eternal is greater than the
[1:17:06] temporal right we're going to keep our
[1:17:07] eyes off the temp yeah off the timbrel
[1:17:09] keep our eyes on the tail don't despair
[1:17:12] at what you see with your eyes may you
[1:17:14] get courage amen because god is greater
[1:17:16] than the problem we are not without help
[1:17:18] amen god does not make it you know put
[1:17:20] something upon us without giving us the
[1:17:22] strength to do it
[1:17:23] right so don't despair by what you see
[1:17:25] because the devil wants to torment with
[1:17:27] that fear right it's always going to be
[1:17:29] this way they've gone too far it's been
[1:17:30] too long it's no way there's no hope for
[1:17:32] them he said hold on satan
[1:17:34] hold on satan no no who said
[1:17:37] god didn't say that you're trying to
[1:17:38] tell me that i because remember the
[1:17:40] devil only has power over you if you let
[1:17:42] him have power
[1:17:45] if you give him room that's why
[1:17:46] ephesians says do not give him do not
[1:17:47] give space for the devil
[1:17:49] so if you give him space he has control
[1:17:53] don't give him space
[1:17:54] don't accept his lies
[1:17:56] amen
[1:17:59] now this is an extreme picture but so
[1:18:01] this is the solomon islands
[1:18:03] a couple of years ago they burnt down a
[1:18:05] whole bunch of businesses now i took
[1:18:06] this picture because so so in papua new
[1:18:08] guinea
[1:18:09] it's a
[1:18:10] the the the national i mean there's
[1:18:12] jealousy everywhere but but it's kind of
[1:18:15] more there
[1:18:16] so so we had family friends up there so
[1:18:18] my parents were living there and um and
[1:18:20] and and so one of the men he wanted to
[1:18:23] make a pig farm in the village
[1:18:25] and he even discussed you know you know
[1:18:27] with all the villagers because most of
[1:18:28] my family he said look this is going to
[1:18:30] benefit all of us it's not just me
[1:18:32] trying to make money you know it will
[1:18:34] benefit us all because pigs are
[1:18:36] very valuable there now you would think
[1:18:39] normally that people would just rally
[1:18:41] behind that yeah praise god you've got
[1:18:43] money you know how to do it you know
[1:18:44] let's let's let's do this can i work for
[1:18:46] you whatever more you know but they get
[1:18:48] so jealous that if someone starts to
[1:18:50] rise up above the status quo they just
[1:18:52] destroy it
[1:18:53] so they came in killed all the pigs
[1:18:55] destroyed the pig farm
[1:18:56] because of jealousy
[1:18:58] and i say that because they did that
[1:19:00] because of a lack of revelation
[1:19:02] because they didn't have it wasn't
[1:19:03] revealed to them actually this this
[1:19:05] family this man who wants to have this
[1:19:06] farm as part of us because he's part of
[1:19:08] this village
[1:19:09] right now you take that from the natural
[1:19:11] into the spirit you'll see jealousy
[1:19:13] comes because of a lack of revelation so
[1:19:15] now i don't get offended if someone
[1:19:17] praises christine or my children
[1:19:19] i don't get all but what about me and no
[1:19:21] no you don't try and tear no no no i get
[1:19:23] proud
[1:19:24] it makes me happy
[1:19:26] why because because if someone praises
[1:19:28] them they praise me because i'm part of
[1:19:30] them
[1:19:31] right it's not like well where are where
[1:19:33] am i in the picture like you see some
[1:19:34] fathers you know their children were
[1:19:36] going to be praised maybe for
[1:19:37] intelligence or sporting ability and you
[1:19:39] know but then they begin to say but when
[1:19:40] i was young i did this
[1:19:43] it's jealousy
[1:19:45] it's jealousy because oh what about me
[1:19:47] are you that insecure
[1:19:48] that you need to actually compare
[1:19:50] yourself to your child's house better
[1:19:51] than that guy
[1:19:52] no
[1:19:53] that's a lack of revelation
[1:19:56] right and then what does it end up doing
[1:19:58] this
[1:20:00] people burn down families
[1:20:02] because of jealousy because of a lack of
[1:20:04] revelation because they think well it's
[1:20:07] it's it's me and them no we're all one
[1:20:10] yeah
[1:20:11] right so that's why we should people
[1:20:13] people try and do this to my family i'm
[1:20:14] sorry the fire's gonna go on you
[1:20:17] you know i'm not gonna yeah yeah they
[1:20:18] deserve it no and a lot of people will
[1:20:20] tear down their families because their
[1:20:21] own spiritual condition is very poor
[1:20:24] but because of because of appearances
[1:20:27] they want to appear the spiritual one so
[1:20:29] they drag their family down to their
[1:20:31] level that's not redeeming love
[1:20:33] that's actually hatred that's hatred
[1:20:36] that's the devil working right but
[1:20:37] redeeming love should lift up
[1:20:39] right that we should put their lives
[1:20:41] above our own lives if we really love
[1:20:43] our families and one another we'll put
[1:20:45] ourselves above
[1:20:46] put them above ourselves yeah sorry i
[1:20:49] get things going the wrong way but you
[1:20:50] know what i mean right we should put out
[1:20:51] remember jesus said for this for their
[1:20:54] sakes the disciples say i sanctify
[1:20:56] myself
[1:20:57] right so he was because he could look
[1:20:59] beyond the here and now he says for
[1:21:01] their sake i'll sanctify myself
[1:21:04] remember he could have got married he
[1:21:05] could have children could done all kinds
[1:21:06] of things
[1:21:07] but because of redeeming love
[1:21:10] no i'm not saying we shouldn't get
[1:21:11] married please don't don't don't get
[1:21:12] into your mind praise the lord we want
[1:21:14] to see a wedding or a whole ton why not
[1:21:16] but you know
[1:21:18] but we should you know are we do we love
[1:21:20] god enough
[1:21:21] that we're willing to put aside petty
[1:21:23] things
[1:21:24] we're going to come to it because my
[1:21:25] question really i want to ask today is
[1:21:26] do you love him
[1:21:28] do you love him
[1:21:30] now frustration is the feeling of being
[1:21:32] upset or annoyed as a result of being
[1:21:34] unable to change or achieve something
[1:21:37] and then and then the and it's also if
[1:21:39] something frustrates you or it's a
[1:21:41] frustration it's the prevention of the
[1:21:42] progress success or fulfillment of
[1:21:44] something right true now if you take
[1:21:46] that into the spiritual it's not god
[1:21:48] being frustrating
[1:21:50] the devil's been defeated on calvary
[1:21:52] it's you
[1:21:54] right we are the biggest hindrance the
[1:21:56] biggest hindrance is not family or you
[1:21:58] know it's amazing how you say well i
[1:21:59] just don't have time because of this and
[1:22:01] this and this and this no no no no no no
[1:22:03] no
[1:22:04] that's putting blame you've got to we
[1:22:05] have to take ownership for everything
[1:22:07] i'm a firm believer we should take
[1:22:09] ownership for our actions ownership for
[1:22:11] we are
[1:22:12] our environment as a product of
[1:22:14] ourselves
[1:22:15] right and if we just let it go washing
[1:22:18] around we're the product of our
[1:22:19] environment not talking about our home
[1:22:20] life
[1:22:21] right it's not these you know like in
[1:22:23] economics they say it's market forces
[1:22:26] that's why there's inflation well it's
[1:22:27] international market force it's like
[1:22:29] some vague kind of airy fairy kind of
[1:22:31] thing
[1:22:32] no this is not some vague thing
[1:22:35] right when it comes to our home life and
[1:22:37] our own spiritual walk oh it's market
[1:22:38] forces that's that's why i'm struggling
[1:22:40] no no no it's actually no no you are a
[1:22:43] product of your environment
[1:22:46] and you create your environment
[1:22:48] so what kind of walk do you want
[1:22:50] see if we can put if we can if we can
[1:22:53] lay aside the things that seem to hinder
[1:22:55] us
[1:22:56] right and just walk with god
[1:22:58] but what's your motivation
[1:23:01] so you get frustrated you see this lack
[1:23:03] of control unable to change something
[1:23:04] well that's the thing we try and change
[1:23:06] it let god come and change it
[1:23:08] let god create an atmosphere in our
[1:23:10] homes that he begins to change us right
[1:23:12] because how how are you going to
[1:23:13] influence the most powerful thing will
[1:23:16] influence right so if so if the devil's
[1:23:18] in charge of you then he will influence
[1:23:21] the family or your own humanity but if
[1:23:23] god is in charge of you then he'll
[1:23:24] influence the family it's up up to them
[1:23:27] to receive it sure but
[1:23:28] who's your hatred
[1:23:31] amen no it's amazing where jesus was
[1:23:33] asked what's the greatest commandment
[1:23:36] and one of them which was a lawyer asked
[1:23:37] him a question tempting him saying
[1:23:38] master which is the great commandment in
[1:23:40] the law now he's expecting he'll just
[1:23:42] pick out the first one or the second one
[1:23:44] or you know but jesus said thou shalt
[1:23:45] love the lord thy god with all thy heart
[1:23:47] allah all thy soul and all thy mind this
[1:23:50] is the first and great commandment and
[1:23:51] the second is like unto it thou shalt
[1:23:53] love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:23:55] on these commandments hang all the law
[1:23:57] and the prophets
[1:24:00] so you see if you really love the lord
[1:24:01] with all your heart and your soul and
[1:24:03] all your mind you will love your
[1:24:05] neighbor as yourself
[1:24:07] right because it's a manifestation that
[1:24:08] love you have for him will be manifested
[1:24:10] to them
[1:24:11] you see so so this is now
[1:24:14] if jesus said this then he has to give a
[1:24:16] grace to do it
[1:24:17] which is divine love
[1:24:19] right so this is this is what the whole
[1:24:21] old testament hangs on and you think
[1:24:23] about it if people really love their
[1:24:25] neighbors themselves you just take that
[1:24:27] this world would be a millennium
[1:24:29] there would be no selfishness there'd be
[1:24:31] no shady deals there'd be no
[1:24:32] backstabbing no political infighting
[1:24:35] there'd be no civil wars no people going
[1:24:37] hungry there'd be no you know sickness
[1:24:39] spreading everywhere disease they'd all
[1:24:40] be gone
[1:24:42] because you'd think you know honestly if
[1:24:44] we as a country were like this and then
[1:24:46] we see a famine going on in ethiopia
[1:24:48] some would say well i want food we can
[1:24:50] give them food let's give them food
[1:24:52] or there's sickness here well we've got
[1:24:53] the ability let's let's manufacture the
[1:24:55] drugs and help them you know what i mean
[1:24:57] because you want it
[1:24:58] right you want to be who who who likes
[1:25:00] anyone like food here
[1:25:03] hey man you're mad at my heart david
[1:25:06] but you see we don't want to go hungry
[1:25:09] we don't want to not have a ability to
[1:25:11] get medical treatment
[1:25:13] so why but see if we really loved our
[1:25:15] neighbors ourselves we'd say well i want
[1:25:17] them to have that
[1:25:19] you see what i mean
[1:25:20] so
[1:25:21] if we love the lord with all our heart
[1:25:23] soul and mind right then we will love
[1:25:25] our neighbor as ourselves
[1:25:27] if we don't love see it's a lack of love
[1:25:30] that causes division
[1:25:32] it's a lack of love that causes pain
[1:25:34] it's a lack of love that causes fussing
[1:25:36] and fighting it's a lack of love that's
[1:25:38] what it boils down to it's not well he
[1:25:40] did this and she did this
[1:25:41] no no it's a lack of love
[1:25:43] because love covers a multitude of sins
[1:25:46] right so you're looking to look beyond
[1:25:48] what you see and what you hear to the
[1:25:50] end
[1:25:52] right if you have divine love as your
[1:25:53] head it'll give you vision
[1:25:55] to do that
[1:25:57] praise the lord
[1:25:58] now
[1:25:59] brother abraham says comments like this
[1:26:00] all the way through his ministry
[1:26:02] anything without emotion
[1:26:04] is dead
[1:26:06] right he believed in a heartfelt
[1:26:08] religion
[1:26:09] i do too amen praise the lord it's not
[1:26:12] just it's not just having all the
[1:26:13] doctrine and the quotes right even
[1:26:15] though that is good right we need to
[1:26:17] have the right doctrine we need to be we
[1:26:18] should be able to put the bible together
[1:26:20] as the seventh angel has put it together
[1:26:23] right but anything without emotion you
[1:26:25] better bury it and get something that's
[1:26:27] got a motion in it
[1:26:29] right so it's not just a you know we
[1:26:31] we're not called just to be hard and
[1:26:33] different kind of cold formal and
[1:26:35] powerless
[1:26:36] but have a heart full of love
[1:26:39] because if we really love one another if
[1:26:41] we really love one another then we can
[1:26:43] help one another
[1:26:44] amen right if you have someone standing
[1:26:47] here with with with ought and just
[1:26:49] frustration against people it's never
[1:26:51] going to produce the love of god it's
[1:26:53] never going to produce a body change
[1:26:54] it's never going to produce the baptism
[1:26:56] of the holy ghost and the people
[1:26:58] see it takes love
[1:27:00] love's got to be the motivator
[1:27:03] amen you say well how can you love
[1:27:05] someone you have never seen you can
[1:27:08] and whom uh whom having not seen you
[1:27:11] love in whom through you now see him not
[1:27:13] yet believing with joy and speakable and
[1:27:16] full of glory
[1:27:17] hallelujah so you can love god but never
[1:27:19] see him
[1:27:20] right when he when he pours his love
[1:27:22] into your heart you fall in love with
[1:27:24] him
[1:27:25] right and there's such a power in that
[1:27:28] you say well i'm fighting something do
[1:27:29] you love him
[1:27:31] that's really what it balls down to oh
[1:27:32] i'm going through i just can't lay aside
[1:27:34] this thing but do you love him
[1:27:36] if you love him it'll give you power to
[1:27:38] lay it aside
[1:27:40] it's really it's man the gospel is
[1:27:41] simple like overcoming is actually very
[1:27:43] simple sure you've got to recognize the
[1:27:45] enemy you've got to recognize the one
[1:27:47] and he's already overcome him he said
[1:27:49] but i just can't let go of this thing
[1:27:50] but do you love god
[1:27:52] if you love him see love makes things
[1:27:54] easy
[1:27:56] love makes all things possible
[1:27:59] he would speak to the galatians he said
[1:28:01] christ has become of no effect unto you
[1:28:04] uh whosoever of you are justified by the
[1:28:06] law you have fallen from grace
[1:28:08] for we through the spirit wait for the
[1:28:09] hope of righteousness by faith for in
[1:28:12] jesus christ neither circumcision
[1:28:14] availeth anything nor uncircumcision but
[1:28:17] faith which worketh by
[1:28:19] love
[1:28:21] so if you want faith to work you need
[1:28:23] love
[1:28:25] amen you need love you see if you're
[1:28:26] feeling cold and distant from god
[1:28:29] you need to come back to him
[1:28:31] remember god hasn't gone anywhere it's
[1:28:32] us to wander
[1:28:35] right so we should never feel cold and
[1:28:37] indifferent
[1:28:39] that's right you say we're going by
[1:28:40] feelings no there should be something
[1:28:42] when you think about him
[1:28:43] amen you can be in the deepest pit of
[1:28:45] sadness and despair but you just begin
[1:28:47] to think about the lord
[1:28:49] think about what he did for you think
[1:28:50] how good he is because he because he
[1:28:52] never did anything wrong to you he's
[1:28:54] only done good things hasn't he he saved
[1:28:56] you when you were lost he was looking
[1:28:57] for you when you were not looking for
[1:28:58] him he found you and you were not
[1:29:00] looking for him he turned you around
[1:29:02] turned your heart to serve him you know
[1:29:04] gave your heart full of love washed all
[1:29:06] your sins away before he ever called you
[1:29:08] he made a way for that to happen right
[1:29:11] and he didn't come to you and say well
[1:29:12] you know if you do this i'll do this for
[1:29:14] you now he says i've already done it
[1:29:15] i've already taken your scissors down
[1:29:16] calvary you just need to receive it you
[1:29:18] begin to think about his goodness
[1:29:21] hallelujah it should give you a feeling
[1:29:23] eh
[1:29:24] it should give you a feeling of love
[1:29:26] right amen
[1:29:29] praise the lord so faith worketh by love
[1:29:33] so if we want more faith we need love
[1:29:35] they work together yeah he says and when
[1:29:38] you get pure unadulterated faith like
[1:29:40] your faith um like your love is to your
[1:29:43] companion then you prove it by the way
[1:29:45] you act amen see saying you saying i
[1:29:48] love you without any actions just empty
[1:29:50] words remember love is a verb
[1:29:53] it's an action word
[1:29:55] it's not just like and now i don't know
[1:29:57] somehow i got through english i don't
[1:29:58] know how you know i wish english was my
[1:30:00] second language and i could have a you
[1:30:02] know i said in self-defense but i got no
[1:30:04] defense
[1:30:05] but you see it's a verb it's an action
[1:30:08] it's not just a word it's a doing
[1:30:10] amen
[1:30:11] right amen
[1:30:13] see
[1:30:15] i'll just read it up there be easier say
[1:30:17] see you ain't complaining no more you
[1:30:18] know it's done just walk along no matter
[1:30:21] what the thing looks like what anyone
[1:30:22] else says you know what's happened you
[1:30:24] know that it's finished just as well as
[1:30:26] you know you love your husband as well
[1:30:28] as you love see faith love and faith has
[1:30:30] to go together they're kin folks they
[1:30:32] love love produces faith you say lord
[1:30:36] i'm lacking faith say well then let love
[1:30:39] produce that faith
[1:30:41] just love them or produce more faith you
[1:30:42] know you take if you trust someone you
[1:30:45] have a certain level of faith in them
[1:30:47] but if you love someone
[1:30:49] you have way more faith in them than if
[1:30:51] you just trusted them
[1:30:53] right so if you really love the lord
[1:30:55] doesn't matter what happens in life
[1:30:57] you trust him
[1:30:58] things are going bad you trust him
[1:31:00] things are going good you trust him you
[1:31:01] know that everything's working for your
[1:31:03] good
[1:31:04] praise the lord this is not in here i
[1:31:06] trust amen amen
[1:31:09] faith finds a source that other people
[1:31:11] don't know nothing about when a man has
[1:31:13] got faith in god he's got a hold of
[1:31:15] something he can't explain it it's
[1:31:16] something that he's got a hold of he
[1:31:18] cannot push it or shove it or pull it it
[1:31:20] takes him
[1:31:22] amen that's the way faith is when man
[1:31:23] really gets faith in god it finds a
[1:31:26] source that others don't see so it's not
[1:31:28] us someone who's really in love with god
[1:31:30] does not work up faith doesn't try and
[1:31:32] generate faith no no faith takes them to
[1:31:35] the promise
[1:31:36] faith will take you to the promise amen
[1:31:38] so there's promises of god that are
[1:31:39] unfulfilled in your life let faith take
[1:31:42] you to that promise
[1:31:44] that's not us trying to generate it push
[1:31:46] it shove it pull it no faith takes you
[1:31:49] amen
[1:31:50] how does it take you love yes
[1:31:53] because love and faith work together
[1:31:55] amen so that's why it's got to be this
[1:31:57] is not a manufactured this is not at a
[1:31:59] manufacturing plant
[1:32:02] right this is not an assembly line
[1:32:04] just punch through acts 2 38 this and
[1:32:06] this and here you are no no it's supreme
[1:32:09] grace comes upon a heart they respond to
[1:32:11] the word and come god's provided away
[1:32:13] that's how it works amen this is a
[1:32:15] birthing center
[1:32:16] where lives of birth into the kingdom of
[1:32:18] god
[1:32:19] but let faith take you to the promise
[1:32:23] hallelujah let faith take you to the
[1:32:25] promise amen
[1:32:27] amen see if we really have faith in god
[1:32:30] we have a resource others don't see
[1:32:32] it can look the same to someone else you
[1:32:35] can have someone who actually has mental
[1:32:37] faith someone has divine faith yeah they
[1:32:40] can go through the same actions
[1:32:42] but one will one's tapping into a source
[1:32:44] which is god himself the other is trying
[1:32:45] to tap into that source yeah it takes
[1:32:47] the surrender
[1:32:50] takes a giving of one praise
[1:32:53] and if you have a revelation that you're
[1:32:54] one with your family you give yourselves
[1:32:56] to them
[1:32:58] right it's not just a working right you
[1:32:59] actually give
[1:33:00] what did jesus do he poured his life out
[1:33:03] he put ourselves above him
[1:33:05] he valued you above himself
[1:33:07] just like if you go buy anything you put
[1:33:10] the value of what you want to buy above
[1:33:11] the money in your pocket
[1:33:13] right if you thought the money was more
[1:33:15] valuable than the thing you'd never buy
[1:33:16] it
[1:33:17] jesus put a greater value on you
[1:33:19] that's why he took the value of his own
[1:33:22] blood he said i'm i'm i'll gladly
[1:33:24] purchase her i'll gladly purchase them
[1:33:27] because he put your life above his own
[1:33:29] life
[1:33:30] he put his own your life above the life
[1:33:33] of god because he had the blood of god
[1:33:34] right so you see so so if we put if we
[1:33:37] have that same kind of love we'll put
[1:33:40] others lives above our own in value
[1:33:43] that takes selfishness out the window it
[1:33:45] just kicks at the touch doesn't it
[1:33:47] you know because we put someone other
[1:33:49] person's life above our own
[1:33:52] amen glory thank you lord love causes
[1:33:55] desperation
[1:33:56] i believe the reason that we don't have
[1:33:58] desperation is because it's a lack of
[1:34:00] love
[1:34:01] the love of god i think that the love of
[1:34:03] god causes desperation
[1:34:06] if god is in you the tokens inside of
[1:34:07] you you have the conditions of um and
[1:34:09] you see the conditions of times and
[1:34:11] people waiting in sin the way they are
[1:34:13] it'll throw you into desperation i
[1:34:15] believe it will
[1:34:17] how how that that's weighty to me that
[1:34:20] impacts me
[1:34:21] it's like am i really indifferent to
[1:34:23] people's condition out there
[1:34:25] right if i am that's a lack of love
[1:34:28] amen there should be such a love yeah
[1:34:31] that when we see people it should be
[1:34:32] lord somehow speak to them maybe it's
[1:34:34] not their time maybe maybe no avenue to
[1:34:36] speak in any way but it should be in us
[1:34:38] lord
[1:34:39] may they fall in love with you too
[1:34:41] may they meet you jesus so help them
[1:34:43] lord yes see and it should cause big but
[1:34:45] you see love causes the love of god
[1:34:48] causes desperation
[1:34:50] desperation is not manufactured i've got
[1:34:52] to be desperate now this is happening
[1:34:54] the love of god
[1:34:55] should cause a desperation
[1:34:57] amen praise the lord
[1:34:59] now the word plainly states if you want
[1:35:01] to put this down galatians 5 and 6 faith
[1:35:03] worketh by love see faith worketh by
[1:35:05] love and the only way we can have faith
[1:35:07] is to have love first because after all
[1:35:10] faith is love's incentive incentive
[1:35:12] that's exactly what faith is it's an
[1:35:13] incentive to love now if you don't have
[1:35:15] love you can't have faith
[1:35:18] see
[1:35:19] so love
[1:35:21] wait faith is love's incentive
[1:35:25] it's a driving force
[1:35:26] it's a motivating force
[1:35:29] amen faith worketh by love
[1:35:33] praise the lord now so i'm just going
[1:35:34] through these but i i just wanted to
[1:35:37] do it this way amen he says
[1:35:40] see we're going to get to a point where
[1:35:41] we realize he's holding on to us
[1:35:44] see amen the lord that means me that
[1:35:46] settles it anything god says you love
[1:35:47] him so much you believe it
[1:35:49] oh i feel real religious right now so so
[1:35:51] why do we believe it because we love him
[1:35:54] right it's not because a collection of
[1:35:55] facts see faith is not a collection of
[1:35:57] facts and a conclusion and you agree
[1:35:59] with the conclusion
[1:36:01] that's not faith that's just agreeing
[1:36:02] with the mental idea right real faith is
[1:36:04] when the lord you receive it
[1:36:07] and then he proves it
[1:36:08] how can he the only way he can prove his
[1:36:10] word is by you receiving it firstly
[1:36:12] first and he proves it in you
[1:36:15] hey see
[1:36:17] see i feel real religious right now to
[1:36:19] think that perfect love casts out all
[1:36:21] fear you're not scared about nothing
[1:36:22] you're just resting you're not oh i may
[1:36:25] be back uh oh i may backslide tomorrow i
[1:36:27] may backslide next week i won't worry
[1:36:29] about that i'm not trying to hold on he
[1:36:31] held on for me
[1:36:33] it's not us being so terrified am i
[1:36:35] going to make it lord am i going to put
[1:36:36] a foot wrong am i going to really know
[1:36:38] let's get that out of your mind
[1:36:40] don't be living in fear no we're not
[1:36:42] living in a like a slow motion car crash
[1:36:45] well you see the corner coming up and
[1:36:46] you're trying it's like
[1:36:50] no it's not like that at all this is not
[1:36:52] our christian walk we should get that
[1:36:54] out of our mind am i going to make it no
[1:36:56] he held on for me i'm going to get there
[1:36:58] amen but see if that revelation is
[1:37:00] anchored into your heart you can rest i
[1:37:02] mean you don't get worried about things
[1:37:04] how's this going to happen and remember
[1:37:05] if it's anchored into your heart for you
[1:37:07] what about your family
[1:37:08] remember the promise is unto you and to
[1:37:10] your children right so if it worked on
[1:37:12] you it's gonna work on them because the
[1:37:14] promise is all the same promise
[1:37:16] hallelujah see i don't worry about that
[1:37:18] i'm not trying to hold on he held on for
[1:37:20] me does that mean you just couldn't do
[1:37:21] whatever you want no if you've got love
[1:37:22] in your heart
[1:37:23] you want more of him
[1:37:25] amen he he put a love in my heart that
[1:37:28] holds there
[1:37:29] it's him holding me not me holding him
[1:37:32] if it was me holding him i'd probably
[1:37:34] turn loose
[1:37:35] but as long as he's holding me he uh
[1:37:37] he'll never turn loose he promised me he
[1:37:40] wouldn't i'll be with you even in you to
[1:37:42] the end of the world
[1:37:43] you see i'll never leave you nor forsake
[1:37:45] me i trust that is anchored in your
[1:37:47] heart no matter what's going on in here
[1:37:50] it's anchored down in here he held on
[1:37:52] for me
[1:37:53] how did he hold on for me he went to
[1:37:55] calvary
[1:37:56] he said it is finished he paid the full
[1:37:58] price of redemption
[1:38:00] hallelujah he paid it in full he held on
[1:38:04] how did he hold on he said not my will
[1:38:05] but i will be done lord
[1:38:08] that's what took him through it be the
[1:38:09] same thing with us we say not my will
[1:38:11] lord but thy will be done
[1:38:13] and as well as his word
[1:38:16] praise the lord praise the lord
[1:38:19] see thank you
[1:38:20] god means god means for people to live
[1:38:22] by grace not by law
[1:38:25] we become so legalistic to well it'd be
[1:38:27] wrong for me to smoke be wrong for me to
[1:38:29] run around on my wife it's love brother
[1:38:31] not because if you love your god you
[1:38:34] won't you won't do any evil things
[1:38:37] because you love them too much not
[1:38:38] because you ought to do it i wouldn't do
[1:38:40] it it's because you love them so much
[1:38:42] you don't want to do it
[1:38:45] see that's why that's why i asked a
[1:38:46] question you say well i'm struggling
[1:38:48] with something but do you love the lord
[1:38:50] do you love him enough to lay that aside
[1:38:54] you see because if you really love him
[1:38:56] because you really going to think about
[1:38:57] you get in the mind better saying yeah
[1:38:59] the devil tempts you or something
[1:39:00] bring it to your mind but do i love the
[1:39:02] lord
[1:39:03] that will cause the temptation of the
[1:39:05] enemy just to evaporate
[1:39:08] you got to keep that on your mind
[1:39:09] because yo the devil wants to present
[1:39:11] you with another spirit
[1:39:12] that can be through a book through a
[1:39:13] movie through music through whatever
[1:39:16] and when it comes your way you think but
[1:39:17] do i love the lord now if you really
[1:39:19] love him you'll lay aside those things
[1:39:21] it's not hard because you love him there
[1:39:23] may be a battle because the devil
[1:39:24] doesn't you know he really wants to get
[1:39:26] his grip on there but you see when you
[1:39:28] realize no i love the lord you lay those
[1:39:30] things aside
[1:39:31] it's not something you've got to push
[1:39:32] yourself through and try and over no
[1:39:34] if you've surrendered your life to him
[1:39:36] and you love him those things just go to
[1:39:37] one side amen
[1:39:39] right do you like see because you love
[1:39:40] him so much you don't want to do it amen
[1:39:43] so the same thing with with with
[1:39:45] bitterness
[1:39:46] or resentment or unforgiveness
[1:39:49] or gossip or being malicious or waiting
[1:39:51] but do you love the lord
[1:39:53] do you love the lord above unforgiveness
[1:39:57] do you love the lord above accomplice
[1:40:00] i can't forgive that's a complex you
[1:40:01] gotta
[1:40:02] let you know or even a trauma can you
[1:40:04] love do you love the lord above trauma
[1:40:07] of your past see if you love him then
[1:40:09] the lord can take the trauma
[1:40:12] off oh i can't forgive that brother that
[1:40:13] sister they did this 40 million jurassic
[1:40:16] years ago and the drastic period they
[1:40:18] did that in my life but do you love the
[1:40:20] lord
[1:40:21] if you love him you can let that go
[1:40:24] that's why you got it you know it should
[1:40:25] always be a scales in your life because
[1:40:27] because god says why let the devil have
[1:40:29] real estate
[1:40:30] why let him hold you back because you've
[1:40:33] given him space to rule
[1:40:35] right remember a demon-possessed person
[1:40:37] has full ownership over a person but the
[1:40:39] devil can oppress by a conflict or
[1:40:41] something in a mind that's just a part
[1:40:43] of a dominion
[1:40:45] praise the lord the tolls are still in
[1:40:46] the room
[1:40:49] amen
[1:40:50] anyway but you see
[1:40:52] see it could that's just a partial
[1:40:54] dominion but you let him in to have it
[1:40:56] remember brother kaijo preached issues
[1:40:58] and open doors you open a door the devil
[1:41:00] steps in because of an issue and starts
[1:41:02] causing havoc but do you love the lord
[1:41:04] more than that thing
[1:41:06] if you love him you can let it go
[1:41:09] it should be a scales right my love for
[1:41:11] god or the complex
[1:41:13] god wins every time my god or
[1:41:15] unforgiveness god wins every time right
[1:41:18] or resemble whatever this person did
[1:41:19] this don't worry about that yeah amen it
[1:41:22] only cripples you yeah right amen let it
[1:41:25] go
[1:41:26] you love him
[1:41:28] amen do you see you don't want to do a
[1:41:30] worship but once perched has no uh uh or
[1:41:33] uh so actually no more conscious or
[1:41:35] desire to sin when he once purged in the
[1:41:37] blood of jesus christ he has no more
[1:41:38] desire to sin the thing is gone from him
[1:41:41] yeah
[1:41:42] you gotta put in a scale do you love him
[1:41:43] enough
[1:41:44] to let that go i say if you love god
[1:41:46] just an inchy little bit that's more
[1:41:48] than anything
[1:41:53] hallelujah that's right
[1:41:56] and men and women you know where you
[1:41:58] stand tonight there's only one more
[1:41:59] person knows it that's god knows where
[1:42:01] you stand so if it's your heart's right
[1:42:03] with god really live for him be true to
[1:42:05] him love him so much that everything
[1:42:07] else becomes secondarily amen everything
[1:42:09] else takes second place because you love
[1:42:11] him
[1:42:12] and then you'll love the lord with all
[1:42:13] your heart with all your strength all
[1:42:15] your soul with all your might god will
[1:42:17] lead you there
[1:42:18] the footsteps of a righteous man is
[1:42:20] ordered by the lord's your leadership in
[1:42:22] your life just love the lord
[1:42:24] right you're looking to make big
[1:42:25] decisions just love the lord and he'll
[1:42:28] lead you that everything else will
[1:42:29] become secondary right now that
[1:42:31] secondary does not mean you become like
[1:42:33] a monk in your household and you can't
[1:42:35] function in everyday society that's not
[1:42:37] what it means if you really love him his
[1:42:39] love can go into your household right
[1:42:42] you'll actually be the best husband wife
[1:42:44] child whatever in the world if he's in
[1:42:47] you yeah
[1:42:48] amen you'll be the greatest asset to any
[1:42:50] family
[1:42:52] when
[1:42:53] the lord is on the inside of the inside
[1:42:54] see he'll lead you then
[1:42:56] amen
[1:42:58] see us here now let's watch
[1:43:01] essentially where where paul would order
[1:43:03] this in the book of hebrews jesus christ
[1:43:04] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:43:06] sure amen we all know that but be not
[1:43:08] carried about with divers and strange
[1:43:10] doctrines for it is a good thing that
[1:43:12] the heart be established with grace and
[1:43:14] not with meats which have not profited
[1:43:16] them that have
[1:43:17] been occupied therein so people have
[1:43:20] been occupied in the past of just the
[1:43:21] outward
[1:43:24] long hair no shorts earrings go on
[1:43:27] makeup all that all the outward
[1:43:28] appearance but that can just be but but
[1:43:31] if that is just the if that is the main
[1:43:33] criteria of being a christian which is
[1:43:35] not
[1:43:36] that is being established with meats
[1:43:38] which have not profited it didn't profit
[1:43:40] people just to be a legalistic outward
[1:43:41] form
[1:43:42] right but if your heart is but if your
[1:43:44] heart is established with grace now we
[1:43:46] know grace in the bible at
[1:43:49] the the definition is a divine influence
[1:43:51] upon the heart and its reflection in the
[1:43:53] life so if the grace of god has come
[1:43:55] upon you it will be reflected in your
[1:43:57] life so now if your heart has been
[1:43:58] established with grace
[1:44:01] then the outwards outward will take care
[1:44:02] of itself
[1:44:04] because do you love him more than those
[1:44:06] things well what yeah but what will my
[1:44:08] friend say about me but do you love him
[1:44:10] what's more important who's your god
[1:44:13] amen amen i say the lord jesus christ
[1:44:15] amen should be you know since i came
[1:44:19] i i came into my lord i love him so much
[1:44:21] i never want to go out there's something
[1:44:23] about the salvation that since i came
[1:44:25] into him he's my refuge and when i came
[1:44:27] into him i never wanted to go out i have
[1:44:29] no complaints
[1:44:30] if i knowed i was going to be put out
[1:44:32] then i'd have a complaint but i have no
[1:44:34] complaints why because we're not going
[1:44:35] to get put out all that come to me are
[1:44:37] no wise
[1:44:38] cast aside
[1:44:40] right so now so now if you've really
[1:44:42] come into them you have no complaints
[1:44:45] that doesn't mean life doesn't get hard
[1:44:48] right but divine love looks beyond
[1:44:52] that thing that causes the complaint
[1:44:54] right and looks to the end goal
[1:44:57] it gives you vision as i say because you
[1:44:59] can see the you know the end goal is
[1:45:00] actually
[1:45:01] my family circle's going to be unbroken
[1:45:03] on that day up there
[1:45:05] hallelujah so you're looking beyond the
[1:45:07] trouble and looking to the promise and
[1:45:09] if you can do that you don't submit to
[1:45:11] some unbelieving spirit in the house
[1:45:15] you don't you don't come under the hitch
[1:45:17] of a thing that's not ungodly yeah right
[1:45:19] you only come to the hitchhip of the
[1:45:20] world that's why i obey you that's why
[1:45:22] it says the bible says to obey
[1:45:24] parents in the lord
[1:45:26] right should be the same thing even with
[1:45:27] spousal signs you should obey your
[1:45:29] spouse in the lord respect him his head
[1:45:31] joe but there's got to be a yes like
[1:45:32] abigail in the bible
[1:45:34] his um um her her husband was nabel
[1:45:37] right
[1:45:39] david david goes you know david's men go
[1:45:41] to nabal and because they've been
[1:45:43] protecting his his his shepherds and
[1:45:45] things all the way through he had no
[1:45:47] idea what was going on nabel just got
[1:45:49] angry who's this david who's the son of
[1:45:52] jesse you know and then and then so so
[1:45:54] it seems away without any food you know
[1:45:56] nothing for the people and then so the
[1:45:58] servants say this to david david gets
[1:46:00] angry
[1:46:01] i'm going to wipe them out
[1:46:04] so nabel was a fool that's what his name
[1:46:05] meant
[1:46:06] abigail was a spiritual woman
[1:46:09] you know if she was just under naval's
[1:46:10] headship she would have been taken out
[1:46:12] with the rest of them but because she
[1:46:13] was a godly woman she could respect her
[1:46:15] husband as for who he was but he she
[1:46:18] stood in the gap for her family and went
[1:46:20] to david
[1:46:21] you see that's why i obey in the lord
[1:46:23] see
[1:46:24] amen because she knew who she was i
[1:46:26] could say in christ so i put it that way
[1:46:28] that's why we shouldn't submit ourselves
[1:46:29] to hateships that are not of god
[1:46:31] we should respect them but they need to
[1:46:33] be in the right place i trust this count
[1:46:34] is coming out right so you respect for
[1:46:36] who they are you know but when it comes
[1:46:39] to them encroaching on your walk with
[1:46:40] god that's where it should really should
[1:46:42] come along right
[1:46:44] i trust that help
[1:46:45] in some way amen so you see so
[1:46:48] amen
[1:46:50] and then also if you really have that
[1:46:51] kept set of divine love you know all
[1:46:53] things work together for good
[1:46:55] amen for them that love god
[1:46:57] and to them who are called according to
[1:46:58] his purpose so it doesn't say and to
[1:47:00] adjust to them who are called according
[1:47:02] to his purpose them that love god
[1:47:04] it's working for your good
[1:47:07] praise the lord sorry we're going to be
[1:47:08] through soon
[1:47:10] i think anyway so just a few more
[1:47:13] just a few more
[1:47:15] but then when we go back to your
[1:47:16] respective church now notice this this
[1:47:18] is to me this is this is so powerful
[1:47:21] when you go back to your respective
[1:47:22] church they've just had these big
[1:47:23] meetings go back with such a heart full
[1:47:25] of love that uh that a woman that you
[1:47:27] can't just stand or that man love him or
[1:47:28] her anyhow they'll know you got
[1:47:30] something out of the meetings then
[1:47:32] so it's not just saying because
[1:47:34] sometimes we go back from meetings
[1:47:35] praise the lord the preacher preached on
[1:47:36] this i've never seen this before this
[1:47:38] way wow that type and that shadow that's
[1:47:40] amazing that's not actually getting in
[1:47:42] here it may be something out of the
[1:47:43] meeting
[1:47:44] but there's got to be a manifestation of
[1:47:46] love which proves you actually got
[1:47:48] something out of the meeting
[1:47:50] right because it can just be head
[1:47:51] knowledge appraisal that service was so
[1:47:54] dynamic and oh that was awesome but what
[1:47:55] did you get out of it
[1:47:57] see if you really get something out of
[1:47:58] it then you'll love them
[1:48:00] i mean more than you did before you went
[1:48:02] to those conventions right so it should
[1:48:03] always be when we walk out these doors
[1:48:05] we love people more
[1:48:07] i mentioned to be that way you may be
[1:48:08] coming here this person
[1:48:10] no but you walk out i love the other men
[1:48:12] praise the lord brother sister come here
[1:48:14] you're awesome you know it should be
[1:48:15] that way shouldn't it why because we
[1:48:17] actually get say because love is a
[1:48:19] manifestation of that you as a proof
[1:48:21] you've got revelation
[1:48:23] see that's right if you don't do that
[1:48:25] then you haven't gained anything yet
[1:48:28] because you've got to have the love one
[1:48:29] for another then the people the outside
[1:48:31] world will know you've passed from death
[1:48:32] under life when you have love one for
[1:48:35] another
[1:48:37] praise the lord so that's why we've got
[1:48:39] to really you know
[1:48:41] you've got to check sometimes this is
[1:48:42] all in the head if it's in the heart
[1:48:44] there'll be a manifestation of divine
[1:48:46] love
[1:48:47] oh my lord jesus move everything from
[1:48:49] here down to here
[1:48:50] amen and hope make us not ashamed
[1:48:52] because the love of god is and
[1:48:53] brought in our hearts by the holy ghost
[1:48:55] which is given unto us amen and i
[1:48:57] remember back in when i was first
[1:48:59] walking with the lord this literally
[1:49:00] happened to me when i was washing dishes
[1:49:02] the love of god filled my heart and it
[1:49:03] was that moment i knew how much i love
[1:49:05] him because of how much he loved me and
[1:49:07] purchased my salvation on calvary the
[1:49:09] love of god literally filled my heart
[1:49:10] like a presence changed my whole life
[1:49:13] amen it actually showed me god is love
[1:49:15] he showed he proved it
[1:49:17] right but this is how we should be if
[1:49:19] we've got the holy ghost it should have
[1:49:21] brought in our hearts the love of god
[1:49:22] amen amen amen
[1:49:25] praise the lord
[1:49:26] amen you come on and i give unto you i'm
[1:49:28] just going to read a few of these that
[1:49:29] you love one another as i have loved you
[1:49:31] that ye also love one another by this
[1:49:33] shall all me know that you're my
[1:49:34] disciples if you have love one for
[1:49:37] another this is how people know that
[1:49:38] you're the disciples of christ not that
[1:49:41] that you can explain all the seven seals
[1:49:43] to them though that is good
[1:49:45] but there's a manifestation of love they
[1:49:47] can actually see when people come in
[1:49:48] here trust me these people actually like
[1:49:50] each other
[1:49:50] they actually really love each other
[1:49:52] they love to spend time why are they
[1:49:53] such fellowship junkies why they enjoy
[1:49:55] spending time together because they love
[1:49:56] one another
[1:49:58] and look therefore we're all from
[1:49:59] different corners of the world but
[1:50:00] they're such a love that's what people
[1:50:02] should see
[1:50:03] if we're really the disciples of christ
[1:50:06] we love one another
[1:50:10] incredible
[1:50:11] here brother brown would say oh here we
[1:50:13] go here let but but live but let love be
[1:50:16] without the simulation abhor that which
[1:50:18] is evil cleave that which is good be
[1:50:19] kindly affectionate one to another with
[1:50:22] brotherly love and honor preferring one
[1:50:24] another so put yourself
[1:50:26] lower than your brother right prefer
[1:50:27] them above yourself and amen now he says
[1:50:30] this here i'd be scared to stand on the
[1:50:31] platform and face evil spirits to know
[1:50:34] that i have had envy in my heart to know
[1:50:36] that i had in my heart against my
[1:50:37] brother
[1:50:38] no matter who he is what and that and
[1:50:41] that's trying to preach the gospel of
[1:50:42] jesus christ or live a christian life
[1:50:45] so brother i said i would hate you think
[1:50:47] about the enemies he had
[1:50:49] and the religious spirits fighting
[1:50:51] against him
[1:50:52] he said i would hate to have ought
[1:50:54] against one of those people that carried
[1:50:55] those spirits remember he could look
[1:50:57] beyond yeah he saw when people actually
[1:51:00] loved him yeah and he saw when people
[1:51:02] just said they loved him yeah that's
[1:51:04] right
[1:51:05] and yet he could walk in such a way not
[1:51:06] to have ought against those people who
[1:51:08] are hypocrites
[1:51:10] because he saw the power of envy
[1:51:13] he saw the power of holding something
[1:51:16] against someone how it disables how the
[1:51:18] enemy can say when when you know when a
[1:51:20] demon spirit's going to be cast out that
[1:51:22] demon spirit says hold on you've got
[1:51:23] envy in your heart you have no power
[1:51:25] over me
[1:51:26] it disables it just takes all the
[1:51:28] authority out of a believer
[1:51:30] so we can't have any envy against anyone
[1:51:33] any unforget hey if you want to if you
[1:51:35] want to see the enemy cast out
[1:51:37] get all envy malice strife
[1:51:40] unforgiveness bitterness resentment just
[1:51:43] empty it all out
[1:51:45] just empty it all out do you love the
[1:51:47] lord he'll empty it just let him empty
[1:51:48] it all out
[1:51:50] but if you want to have power with god
[1:51:52] empty that all out
[1:51:54] amen
[1:51:55] if we disagree a million miles upon
[1:51:57] theology if he loves the lord jesus he's
[1:51:59] my brother and it's my sister and we're
[1:52:02] now i just want to stop there
[1:52:04] if they say they love the lord you've
[1:52:06] got to take that at face value you can't
[1:52:08] just say no you're a hypocrite but no no
[1:52:09] no who's the judge god's the judge
[1:52:12] right but you know how to draw the
[1:52:14] circle bigger it's not just saying well
[1:52:16] i draw the circle bigger but don't talk
[1:52:17] to these people right no you should
[1:52:20] treat them like you treat those who
[1:52:21] actually
[1:52:22] know that they love you or you love them
[1:52:24] absolutely why they're drawing the
[1:52:25] circle bigger they're still brother and
[1:52:26] sister right
[1:52:27] america
[1:52:29] the hearing aid no it's not working
[1:52:31] it's gonna be come on amen praise the
[1:52:34] lord amen and withdraw those lines and
[1:52:37] if you can't love your brother who you
[1:52:38] have seen how can you love god whom you
[1:52:40] haven't seen and and brother when love
[1:52:43] goes out god goes with it
[1:52:46] for god is love and you can never get
[1:52:47] anywhere without divine love and he and
[1:52:49] as you love one another you love god
[1:52:52] love has gone out of your heart because
[1:52:54] of envy strife malice business
[1:52:56] unforgiveness pain whatever god goes out
[1:52:59] with it
[1:53:00] i want him in here

[1:53:27] see this world is a world full of
[1:53:29] tension

[1:54:04] i'm so glad of your blood i can step
[1:54:05] into your presence where the people of
[1:54:07] israel couldn't even go on the base of
[1:54:09] the touch the mountain to go up into you
[1:54:10] know the pillar of father or mount sinai
[1:54:12] but because of your blood i mean i can

[1:54:27] yourself to the holy spirit and watch
[1:54:29] what he will do
[1:54:30] so don't get all tense about things just
[1:54:32] commit to the lord and love
[1:54:35] him
[1:54:36] amen just one more then i've got a big
[1:54:38] question paul said the life that i now
[1:54:40] live he lived a different life from from
[1:54:42] what he once did
[1:54:44] is not me but the christ liveth in me
[1:54:46] there is the identified token that god
[1:54:48] required identify with our uh
[1:54:50] identification with our sacrifice the
[1:54:52] life of our savior is in us the holy
[1:54:54] spirit i want a positive token there
[1:54:56] cannot be any more token oh my if you
[1:54:58] could only catch the thought of it if i
[1:55:00] had the power this morning with words to
[1:55:02] express and place it into your soul not
[1:55:04] on your ears but your soul would make
[1:55:06] and you can see the guarantee of it it
[1:55:08] takes it makes you so relaxed
[1:55:11] if you can really just anchor into our
[1:55:13] hearts my life is sealed in with god
[1:55:17] it's sealed away
[1:55:18] that would make you feel it would make
[1:55:20] you so relaxed you just rest and let god
[1:55:22] work
[1:55:23] amen
[1:55:25] and if you are in that way
[1:55:27] then when the enemy brings in anything
[1:55:28] you say well do i love the lord or this
[1:55:30] thing
[1:55:31] i love the lord that thing goes lord
[1:55:35] so i'm going to leave you with this
[1:55:36] question do you love him
[1:55:39] what do you mean you love him is he all
[1:55:41] the will to you when you really think
[1:55:43] about him and his greatness and what
[1:55:44] he's done does it mean everything to you
[1:55:47] amen
[1:55:48] if it means everything to you it's easy
[1:55:50] to let things go
[1:55:52] it's easy just to
[1:55:54] pass it on to him
[1:55:55] it is you say well that person will
[1:55:58] never ask for forgiveness but you can
[1:55:59] forgive them amen that person will never
[1:56:02] make it right but you can you can
[1:56:04] forgive them you can let it go
[1:56:06] you know but this happened in my
[1:56:07] childhood you can let it go amen
[1:56:09] god never made us to be crippled
[1:56:12] he managed to be whole
[1:56:14] he made us to be not just mended but
[1:56:16] whole
[1:56:18] right and and then then so how does how
[1:56:20] does healing come in love
[1:56:23] if you're loving your poor in the
[1:56:24] healing
[1:56:25] right
[1:56:26] so
[1:56:27] do you love him
[1:56:30] if you really do love him if you really
[1:56:32] do
[1:56:33] then redeeming love is your thing
[1:56:36] and your life will be a life of
[1:56:37] redeeming love
[1:56:39] we can look beyond the fault of your
[1:56:41] family your brother and sister and you
[1:56:42] can go and pray for them and stand in
[1:56:44] the gap
[1:56:45] right and you can live a life amen
[1:56:47] remember remember brother brown preach
[1:56:49] the sermon
[1:56:50] is your life worthy of the gospel he
[1:56:52] didn't preach as your wife worthy of the
[1:56:53] gospel amen amen amen is your life
[1:56:57] worthy of the gospel how does your life
[1:56:59] become worthy you come under the shed
[1:57:00] blood you accept his way
[1:57:02] accept his word
[1:57:04] right but if redeeming love is really
[1:57:05] the capstone in your life then it'll be
[1:57:07] manifested out of you amen your love
[1:57:10] there'll be a love in your heart for
[1:57:11] anyone even the unlovable because we
[1:57:14] were once unlovable
[1:57:16] we were once god's enemies the bible
[1:57:18] said no not just a fake like not a
[1:57:20] friend an enemy
[1:57:22] we were his enemies of scripture but yet
[1:57:24] he died for us in due time he loved us
[1:57:27] right so can do we have a love in our
[1:57:28] hearts for the what we would think
[1:57:30] humanly as the unlovable
[1:57:33] right
[1:57:34] and if you do you'll look beyond you
[1:57:36] won't get frustrated but you'll take it
[1:57:38] to god
[1:57:39] and let god take control of the
[1:57:41] situation
[1:57:42] remember divine love gives us vision
[1:57:46] right
[1:57:47] what is the vision for the family the
[1:57:48] family circle will be unbroken on that
[1:57:50] day
[1:57:51] it doesn't matter where they are how
[1:57:52] long they've gone i believe he can get
[1:57:54] them back i believe with all my heart
[1:57:56] there's no one too far
[1:57:58] amen so let's have the musicians this
[1:58:01] morning
