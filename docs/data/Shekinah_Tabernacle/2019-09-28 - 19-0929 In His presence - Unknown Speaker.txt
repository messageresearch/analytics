sharing what they've been learning in the word so this week I'll let you in on how it went so that or sorry this last month so I wanted to do a surprise for them and I'll go into a bit of detail so I didn't tell them what the Sunday lesson was for the month and I took them outside I just had a camera with me a camera bag and I told them to follow me we're gonna go outside and we went to the school grounds over there we you know our little line of Sunday school went over around in the school and I told them that I wasn't gonna tell them what it was about but they're gonna pick one thing that they saw out in the school grounds or just wherever the walking along whatever and for them to pick it and then I'll take a photo with them with it so they did that and that was our Sunday School lessons for that day so they had no idea what was going on the next Sunday school I had them sorry I get a bit nervous I yeah I don't like standing up front but they do so so then the next one I told them what our lesson was gonna be about and I started off with this verse admin told me not to shake the microphone but I don't know if that's okay so um brother branham speaking here in sirs we would see Jesus I'll just get the PowerPoint now the theme was seeing God and I got this from the ticket time series we would see Jesus so you can read along with me as I read you could probably read better than me and without shaking we owe him our lives we owe him all that we are all the good things there is come by him and there's nothing good but what come by him sir we would see Jesus it reminds me of a little story I've often referred to I lived by a side of the Ohio River and there was a little boy who went to a certain church in my city and he was an enthusiastic little boy and the little fellow had faith that he had heard so much about God and he did not go to our church he went to another church and he went to his mother one day and said mama he was about 10 years old I guess little fellow for his age and he said I want to ask you something she said jr. go ahead and ask he said if this God that you took out and the pastor speaks from the pulpit in the sunday-school teacher tells us about in Sunday school if he is such a great God why can't we see him that is a very sensible question she said Sonny I'm not able to answer that such a question ask your Sunday school teacher in the little fellow the following Sabbath asked his Sunday school teacher in the question the question she said I'm not able to answer you go and see the pastor and he went to the pastor and the pastor said my little lad I'm fond of your enthusiasm but I'd like to say this that no man can see God well it disappointed the little fellow he would really he would um how would I really understand if he made the earth and the heavens and all these great things and then I can't see him he used to go up on the river with an old fisherman that they fish in the make a commercial fishing and he went up to run the Nets up near than six mile island above Louisville and there come up a rain and on the back a road back they had to get into the bushes to keep from being washed into in with the rain in the storm after the storm was over the Sun came out and the old fisherman bailed out his boat put the little boy in the stern and pushed out from the bank and started down the river and as he was clipping the oars against the waves as only a boatman knows the rhythm the Sun was going down in the West and across the East which he was faced pulling his boat there come a rainbow and the little fellow sitting quietly for a while noticed the old fisherman breathing Oh see now I could start crying because I think about it so shaking and crying sorry guys and catching his breath and snubbing and after a bit he noticed great glistening white tears rolling down his gray beard and dropping on his bosom I don't know why I have to join the old man on the fishermen but anyways I am though the little fellow became emotionally mission sorry emotional and excited and he rushed from the from the stern of the boat and up to the middle and said fell down at his knees and said sir I want to ask you a question said my mother or my Sunday school teacher or neither my pastor can answer me he said I noticed you looking at the rainbow and as I understand from the scriptures that God gave it as a sign and if God is so great why can't we see him and the old man kindly upset because of the little lads enthusiasm put pulled his oars into his lap took the little boy in his arms and looked at him in the face and brushed back his hair and gazed him in the eyes and he said Sonny all I've seen for the past forty years has been God okay yep there was so much in the old fisherman the only way to see God is get him on the inside of you so he can use your eyes you'll see him but if you're not but if you're trying to see him on an intellect conception of his word or some emotional workup it will never count anything he's got to be in you so and then I shared with these guys um when I first got saved well when he first I met the Lord when I was 21 and when when I met him whew when you meet Christ it's real so after I met him you know you're walking on cloud nine and the Sun is brighter they you know nothing nothing hinders you you just you know you're walking in a jumping and so after I met him this is what I saw everywhere I crosses everywhere but this time it meant something to me so with these guys I told them you can see God everywhere he created all the earth the klore and declare his glory you can see if you're looking and you can see you can see everything and everything he's made everything speaks of God no I told these guys with your picture that I took you are gonna find you're gonna see God in the picture you took of what um either creation or whatever object you chose you'll find also in the Bible because word so I'll have the first one so they picked their own

his delight is in the law of the Lord and in the Lord that he and in the Lord of he is and in the Lord that he meditate night and day and he shall be like a tree planted by the water and his fruit

this morning amen let's just go straight to the scripture it's great to have all the visitors god bless you amen let's I go to Isaiah and 6 verse 1 familiar piece of scripture to us all let's just go to eyes there six and one sees in the year that King Uzziah died I also saw the Lord sitting on a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the Seraphim each one had six wings with twain he covered his face with twain he covered his feet with twain he did fly and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord God of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I was me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people with unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then one of the Seraphim then flew one of the seraphim's unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said lo this has touched thy lips and mine iniquity is taken away in thy sin is purged also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me amen this bow is for a word of Prayer Lord Jesus truly you are beautiful Lois you're the only one we want to seek my god in Lord we want to thank you we can come into your presence this morning Lord not by earn merits love by your precious blood Lord we have come and dear Lord I just asked father may truly this service leave human control Lord reading reading scriptures such as this Lord we I feel very insufficient Lord to trim' minister your word so I asked I just want to get myself out of the way Lord may you step in and speak to your bride Lord or may you have preeminence in every life Lord may you not just anoint speaker but or not hero as well Lord that your word would be anchored in our souls Lord please may you grant it father may you receive all honor glory and praise Lord because of this day in Jesus Christ then we ask amen I mean god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning and I want to I want to speak about being in his presence now let's just go back there to to Isaiah here in the temple you know it must have been an incredible moment there you know let's just go back and this follow eyes air into the temple you know no doubt he had been in that temple many times he knew everything was he knew how the priests conducted themselves and you know but this was a difference this is a different time that he would go into that same place and you know we know that this was a crisis point in Isaiah's life he he had come to a place where you know his brother brandman will go on to it soon that you know he he saw such a great example in in King Uzziah when King his I was was before he got lifted up and pride and he and he tried to take a priest place and and and burn incense there's a priest would and and you know we we won't read it but in seeking chronicles 26 you read about when King use I you know he was just 16 years old he came to the throne you know he he fully served the Lord and and God greatly blessed him everything he did he every enemy he wins to win against he rose victorious you know his his kingdom was maybe next to Solomon's very powerful Kingdom but then when he said when he strengthened himself he he got lifted up in his heart and because he thought anything he did God would just place it because that was his track record anything he did god bless - but that's because he was walking according to him - to the word of the Lord and that's why God blessed him but in he he felt for some reason he felt that he could take a priest place and he could do the priestly office in the temple and offer incense there at the altar but we know that you know you can't you can't mix officers you know a king is not a priest right so a priest is a special person a king is a special person and a king cannot be a priest so so there was a you know one of the priests and 80 other Rhys tried to withstand use I said you shouldn't be doing this you're not a priest we're a priest you have no right but he got angry at them he said I'm gonna do it anyway and then God smote him with leprosy and he died and disgrace as a leper I had been separated from his people all because he thought he could do what he wanted to do but use but Isaiah was a contemporary of this King and he was under a great influence of of King Uzziah but there comes always comes a time in life where God wants to take every influence out of our lives that he can influence us as he wants to Isaiah was already a prophet he was already prophesying things but there was an influence in his life that was wrong I mean that he leaned too much on the arm of of the King and God had to take that influence away that God could speak to his prophet hallelujah so we see this this moment where Isaiah came into the temple this was building for years this wasn't an overnight one day everything's fine next day he's in crisis no got your things were being orchestrated in the lifeWise there and King Uzziah that God would bring the Prophet to this moment in his life so it was happen this was building for years so you know you know many times we never see crisis coming or even foresee it coming but God is not surprised God is in control of all things I mean so so brother bran would you know so you know the Lord is not surprised he knows the beginning from the end but it's really you know when crisis hits it really shows what we're made of it because when crisis hits and if we're you know if our hardest towards the Lord that's the one we will go to I mean but if our hardest towards the world will find our comfort and trying to alleviate the crisis in the world I mean but if you're a real believer in that scene of God is in you you'll turn to the Lord my help cometh from the Lord hallelujah that should be that should be where we've gone times of crisis I mean you know God knows how to kill an influence out of our lives that he doesn't want your brother man would say in the message influence now this young boy we find out sister speaking of King Uzziah he was you know he had godly parents and training when his daddy died his only 16 years old and the people took a maid and he came on the throne of power when he was only 16 years old and if you read his life he wasn't influenced by the politics of his country he didn't he didn't take the popular opinion he sought after God the Bible said now that's what made him such a great example to this young prophet at the same time Isaiah Isaiah the prophet lived in the days of Uzziah the king and both in being young together the Prophet and the king they were great chums together and Isiah stayed at the palace leaned upon the arm of the king and we find out that this young fellows influence influenced Isaiah he became a hero to Isaiah because he he made no differences in the people he never let anything sway him from one side to the other and he was determined to serve God and serve God alone and that's a great person to take example and we find out he never compromised with any of the heat heathen world's the heathen world after we've seen him build his kingdom so great and God was with them and blessed him now that's a great example but you can lean too much on even the writings influence because God wants us to come to a place where we where we stand on him and his word alone I mean went went went went when all the believers go sideways the world goes sideways we're remaining on the word I mean because you know God doesn't you know we're not believers because of some great ministry somewhere we're not believers because the music's jumping up and down we're not believers because we've got they even the message' now is I mean we're believers because God has revealed himself to us and the message comes reality in our souls I mean that's why we're believers of the night yo even if we never had a Bible or had another message that we could ever hear we would still be believers because as word as in us hallelujah I mean you take Abraham for example water you know you read 25 years Abraham walked with God at sin you know but then you when you read the moments where God spoke to him it just takes a few minutes to read just a few times in his presence he never had a church to go to I mean he didn't have a prophet he didn't have the seals come open he didn't have the book come open to him I mean he didn't have preaching he didn't have something you just stream he's had a few moments in the prints of God but it's so influenced him his whole life revolved around those meetings I meant that he staggered not at the promise of God he said we're gonna have the promised son Holly he went through great trials but it didn't change him amen what about us hallelujah amen so so it was incredible upheaval in the you know in Isaiah's life but the Lord had to remove the influence of King Uzziah because he is trusting too much in the King instead of trusting in the Lord himself as I said God wants us to stand on his word alone not numbers not a favorite ministry not anything but him amen we know desperation brings change when we have it easy there's not a lot of change we just keep going but when desperation strikes that's when change can happen I mean you take you take Hannah for example in the Bible you know her state that she found herself in pouring herself out before the Lord before the tabernacle that wasn't just an overnight thing that was years of building hallelujah amen because you know it wasn't just an overnight thing it wasn't just well she had a bad kind of day then she went and poured her life out before the Lord no this was year after year I mean where it said in 1st Samuel 1 and 4 and when the time that sorry and when the time was that elack ayah which is this is Hannah's husband he gave to Pena which is the other wife his wife and all of her sons and daughters portions so Hannah didn't have any children the other wife had sons and daughters and the and the other wife was her adversary it says in 1st Samuel 1 and 6 and her adversary also provoked her saw and to make her fret because the Lord had shut up her womb now if someone has multiple children that's over years so here is here it is now this is God God knows how to put us in a pressure cooker to reveal himself to us you know sometimes we go you know this world we have it too easy and you know this world is designed that we don't have pressure everything's fine you know we can get help straight away click of a button that's their God don't work that way he wants to move us into a certain state of being that he can reveal himself to us so here is here is Hanna you say will it take years sometimes it might God knows where he wants you to be holy and God will get you there hallelujah you say well I don't like going through the pressure cooker it'll be worth it all I mean when do you get through the other side and you should just count it all joy when you find yourself and divers trial thank you Lord I'm in this trial I'm counting a joy what do you mean you're going through the wringer glory for the wringer hallelujah I mean so if she had sons and daughters this was years of her own in her own household look not not someone somewhere else not even the neighbor in her own house here was here as the other wife of her husband was their adversary look at my children look they're growing up look they're learning to walk just you know that passive aggressive look at their grinding at her hallelujah what had to happen she had to come under an influence because she was go to birth a prophet she was gonna she's gonna be part of a dispensational change who is gonna go for a time of judges to a time of kings hallelujah so she wasn't just gonna have any child she was going to have a prophet hallelujah and so God had to get her into a place that when she received a child should give it to him hallelujah when she went to the when she went to Shiloh as they win every year she went and she she says my you know even her husband tries to console her and verse 8 why do you weep she why we for sell and why eat us thou not is not by heart why as I heart grieved am I better to thee than seeing 10 am I not better to thee than ten sons it's even even the husband couldn't fix the problem God had to get her to a place hallelujah I might just lay broke because I wouldn't you think you know we go we want to get out of a trial we want someone to deliver us of it but sometimes God wants us to keep it keep us there I mean because otherwise if people put their hands on it then God hasn't brought you where you need to be hallelujah amen hey God is greater than what we're going through God is greater than our situation we have to look all things work together for good those that love God and are called according to his purpose I mean if this message is quicken your soul you're called according to his purpose hallelujah so you know so Shira and then and then so she goes to the temple she goes into Shiloh and in verse 10 it says and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the Lord and whipsaw hallelujah then she pray she vowed a vowel speaks the Lord and in Eli who's a backslidden high priest looks at her and and and thinks that she's drunk she's in such a state she doesn't care she wasn't the only one and they're the you know you know in the tabernacle there's a busy place and us and that's why wouldn't you want to want to get you today you know just like I was a going to the temple he wasn't the only one there there are many people there but God met him there hallelujah and that's one of those key things you can be in great distress people you know I can be here God can come and super does she meet you you can have a Jubilee and others can look on and say what's going on with that person you'd be having a heavenly vision you can change your whole life how lujah amen so so here she was and and Eli thought she was drunk and you know Eli go sir how long will they'll be drunk and put away that wine and henna says no I'm not drunk I got a sorrowful spirit I've drunk neither wine nor strong drink I poured out my soul before the Lord count not thine hand maiden for a daughter of Belial for out of the abundance of my complaint in grief have I spoken here and to denilla I answered and said go on peace the God of Israel grant thee thy petition and thou has that thou has asked him and she took that from the Lord hallelujah and she received what she had need of coz she poured herself out God had to get it to that place hallelujah now an influencer definition of an oven influences the capacity to heaven and have an effect on the character development or behavior of someone or something or the effect itself so see a capacity to have an effect on the character development or behavior of someone or something now if our influence of our influence is a good influence so every everything we do has an influence on someone someone's watching doesn't matter what age we are someone's watching you and someone's actually aspiring to be like you so we've got to be very careful what influence are we projecting forth even you know and we we have to come to realization we are actually subconsciously influencing people you know I well I trust that you don't wake up in the morning and have a checklist I'm gonna influence this person this way I'm gonna influence this person this way you know I trust you don't have that kind of agenda that's pretty I'd be pretty scared scared if you have that kind of thing manipulating that way you know but you know you gotta be careful your influences as molding someone shaping someone and it can set them on a course in a certain direction rather em says so we must watch we influence others on what on what we do then when this man got stricken by this leprosy speaking of King Uzziah when he got lifted up in Pride this was a great lesson to that young prophet he found out by this being a great lesson to him that God orders his men to the place see man cannot order himself God orders his man God makes you what you are see and God orders his men and he mustn't try to take another's place and it was a lesson to Isaiah that he mustn't put his eyes on human beings for an example this is our example I meant not not one another this is our example I'm not a speck I'll just saying I'm not aspiring to be like you I'm aspiring to be like him even though I see him in you right so I appreciate that but I don't want to become I don't want to become a little heed one because God made me to be me but you see even come under an influence or someone you can such speaking like them acting like them dressing like them doing things so then what's happened you've come under their natural influence I want to become under the influence of this I'm in and that should be our main influence in life sure we do employ you understand what I mean yep because we do influence one another in a good way but I don't want to become a carbon copy of you I want to become a carbon copy of this right I trust that came out the right way you understand amen see and it was a listen to Isaiah that he mustn't put his eyes upon human beings for an example he must put his eyes on God now that's us any man any man is subject to mistakes he's subject to error because he's human he's subject to the violation of God's laws and he's subject to many things because Satan Timpson and he's just as human being and if God ever lifts his hands he'd fall that's all I've heard people say Oh Satan couldn't do that yes you just let God left us hand one time and watch what happens I mean you just watch one time God takes your God takes his hand off any of us weren't we're toast holy O Lord keep your mercy upon me don't even lift a finger off my life Lord hallelujah amen that's why she's I constantly plead God don't seem to have mercy on me keep him away from me you see I need God's mercy and we all need that now we find that I say he leaned heavily upon the good Kings arm and now the arm had been taken from him and the king was dead and died with leprosy and shame this is where I was okay he was influenced by heavenly I mean an earthly king but now God had to take that influence away and he was in the temple where he had been many times and he saw the Lord High and lifted up now such a few Scripture but think about it I doubt very much he was expecting that when he went into the temple that day I doubt very much he is planning I'm going to see God on a throne today I'm going to see it sirrah from come with a burning coal and touch my lips and say your sin iniquities been purged from you and God say he'll go for us and I'll say Here I am sin me I doubt very much that was on his agenda but God had an agenda God had a plan for his life and God brought him to that place hallelujah and so now here he was now he wasn't just in the he wasn't just in the presence now if you're in the presence of someone they're present they're there in the room like you're in my presence because I'm here if I go out of the room you no longer in my presence right so if we're in the presence of God God is here hallelujah so now here he was he comes into the temple God's presence comes down to him and he wasn't just in the presence of a king or some great priests or some great learning man he was in the presence of the center of everything wasn't just an earthly King wasn't just an angel here was the being that created all things brother man see that filled all time and space collie that goes out to the great eternal God came down to where his prophet was so he wasn't just in the presence of anyone or anything he was in the presence of the one who made all things who knew all things holy by all things consist he was in his presence hallelujah and when he had that visitation see God doesn't just come down just to make us a religious people that's not it God wants to reveal himself to us that will come to a place when he says he'll go for us you'll say Here I am Lord hit me Here I am in my father Here I am in my humanity send me O God hallelujah it's a now his whole life revolves around that one meeting it wasn't just wasn't that interesting or wasn't that a nice service no he met him he was in his presence and his presence impacted his life so much it never left him he wasn't just in the presence of a king he was in the Prince of the one who made all things all the entire universe all that creation is revolves around that one being and God came down to where he was to speak to him to break an influence of his life that he would look beyond his five senses and world is this this king in this way and this is who I am now he wanted to lift him up and say you're going to look beyond what you see what you think what you remember you've got to see me as I am because I have a job for you hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and I friends God has commissioned us I mean to take this word that's living Christ to the world that people would know that he's alive I mean that's how Commission that's our job I mean if God has ever met you I mean using the very one that I say I met you meet Pylea say your entire life should be wrapped around that visitation hallelujah not just for that moment and walk out and forget about it no I mean it's a grip you so influence you so consume you then all you can do is walk and live according to that walk according to his word hallelujah this is what church is about we'd be in his presence not in our presence but his presence would calm down his presence would grip us wholly and not just for a moment not for a service but a lifetime hallelujah his whole life you think of a man the prophets never said good things they rebuked Israel they they they pronounce judgment how could they do it because they met the god of glory holy they couldn't because I sir grips I mean by that they just had to be yielded because they they real this one is eternity he doesn't just hold it here's eternity and when life leaves this body where am I going to go I'm going to go into his presence hallelujah that's why you know Isaiah at the end of his life he has sawn asunder hallelujah why is that why did he go down that road because he went into the temple one day because this world had fallen apart and God caused it to fall apart that God would get a hold of him amen it's always darkest before dawn you may be going through the worst trial in your life there's a reason for it and it's not that you'd say I survived that one is that God would get a hold of you and God would God would grip you hallelujah amen brother MC is this is an influence of another I listen to a few of these he says and there that's where you make your mistake as the there is where so many righteous men bite the dust of shame by the dust of defeat because they begin to feel self secure this eyes a beefy I mean use I rather he got self secure the kingdoms established my enemies are subdued now I can relax I'm secure in my position we don't want to ever think that I believe in eternal security but we don't want to just sit back and say life is just gonna take care of itself life's not going to take care of itself I mean you've got to have a have a backbone and a zeal lord I wanna I want to see this word live I'm not going to compromise with the devil I'm not going to put up with his term he's on my terms and my terms of this word hallelujah and what he is what this word says he must obey it hallelujah I mean we were watching a skit from Cloverdale they do it for the junior camps and that was the story of you you're from Switzerland about arnold von Winkler and so the Austrians came in and they invaded Switzerland and now they and now the local populace they rose up they don't even have an army really and and you know and and and and you know they dramatizing so they call all the villages around and gather the men and they start to have a meeting and they say well you know you know some of them say let's just fortify the town let's just try and repel them another say but what goods that gonna do the enemy still look worried they're you know if we give them a bit he'll just take more we give them a bit we'll just take more just for peace didn't know we've got to fight I mean we're going to stand for what God has given us hallelujah say well and then then they said it's not about the weapon you have it's about what's in your heart Persis yes a fight that's the size of the fight in the dog not the size of the dog in the fight hallelujah I mean so then you're there and then in and out yo you know the story goes that because the Austrians had a lot of parks a lot of Spears he just said catch your men today I'm going to die for Switzerland what are you gonna do you just follow me hallelujah it says make way for liberty why cause he is so determined I'm not going to let the enemy come on my ground I'm not going to leave him coming to my life I'm not gonna let him have my family he's that rather die hero than die coward hallelujah running straight win to the thickest father Spears pulled them into himself made a breach in their formations in the and the Swiss came in and won the victory and they were free people because one man decided I'm going to stand if it cost me my life I'm going to stand hallelujah how about this that's just for a natural country what about a supernatural land about supernatural would a man if it costs our life and it will cost your life because you got to give your life I'm in Hemet and that lose your life shall shall save it shall keep it they said keep your life shall lose it she I'm gonna give you a life way in order to keep it the savers hallelujah we just did make way for liberty I think that should be that should be our hearts cry every morning make way for liberty the devil comes into the house make way for liberty he starts afflicting us make way for liberty my battles make way for liberty holy we shouldn't force it on anything less I mean then 100% the devil defeated and God victorious in our lives that's you that's what we want I mean we're fighting a total war not just a little skirmish this is a total war and a total war you win total victory oh there and then you get the devil to fight to sign an unconditional surrender that means he has no say in what happens to him hallelujah this word declares that the devil has to come to a place of unconditional surrender why is that because he can't say well no can I just keep living no you're going to like a fine devil hallelujah so we got a should that be our heart make way for a Liberty hallelujah amen you begin to think so this is this is I'm so here you begin to think you've lived so long for Christ that no matter what he presents before you you'll take your choice whether you want it or not you've got to continue to serve God no matter what you was ten years ago it's what you are now the king got to a place that he thought within himself then he got lifted up pride God in his heart and that's what happens to us if you'll pardon this expression that's what happens to our churches throughout the country they're fine people and they're some of the best Church some of the best in the world goes to church I think the best in the world goes to church but the thing of it is the organization system gets lifted up and that's what happened to the Methodists that's what happened to the Baptist's that's what happened to the Nazarene to the pilgrim holiness to the Pentecostal lifted up self-willed self-centered pride that you can't tell nothing God can't find a way to get into their hearts it's because they become so no doll that nobody can tell them anything My Lord Jesus may we never ever ever get even close to that point may we never even even take a step towards being that way that God can tell us any one man can't tell us anything you know cuz we know it all and by building themselves around reasoning with brethren they build themselves around their Creed and when they do they leave God in the back we can do this as well we're not immune from these things amen that's what happens to doctors when they get so selfs into that they don't need any help from God that's when I don't want one fooling with me yes see when you leave God out of anything you I want you to leave me out to sea because you must always remember God first he says he got lifted up so many today you take a family of people that will start going to church and God will heal the little family he will bless them and give them the Holy Spirit in their life the little children will pray around the table they'll pray before they go to bed mother and father will join hands and pray and as long as they continue like that they'll stay a family but you let them first thing you know they don't have nothing at all junk car maybe riding around or maybe walking finally they'll get a good karabiner home the first thing you know then they want to get to what they the world calls a better class to associate with they move into a different neighborhood and in their youth they find out they've become influenced by the wrong influence you must always stay with the kingdom of God as and where the glory of God is pouring out stay where you can be spiritually fed day and night then the first thing you know separations come in the home and worldliness and they get lifted up Isaiah came to a place where those things didn't matter no more his whole life revolved around that meeting he says in the unchangeable God working in an unexpected way Isaiah the prophet a young fellow had leaned upon the good Kings arm and here's a good man and he had he had things easy but one day the king died and Isaiah the prophet weighed down the altar in the house of God and while he was praying there he was caught between his own sins in the vision and screamed out well as me when he'd seen the Angels was wings flying over their faces wings over their feet and crying holy holy unto the Lord he cried was me for I am a man of unclean lips he was caught in an unexpected time and an unexpected place he thought I'll go down and say my prayers and get up and go on because people believe I'm a good preacher or pastor or some another but he was caught there not only was he caught in this condition with the vision but he was caught with unclean lips in the house of the Living God oh brother if that don't search out through the city tonight and tomorrow morning of ministers that would stand and tell you there's no such thing as divine healing there's no such a thing as the baptism of the Holy Spirit there'd be some more crying out while smooth and clean lips as true yes very much so yet the Hebrew children they were caught and quite an in a predicament - they are caught in an unexpected place where they admit God God came to them in a fiery furnace an unexpected time an unexpected way but God is the unchangeable God and he does that he does it that way an unexpected place an unexpected time you know Moses was on the backside of the desert he led his sheep that way but there was an unexpected place for him to meet God in a burning bush he was just going about his everyday life and God came to him and his whole life before that he failed to deliver Israel because he's trying to in a political way he was leaning on his understanding what his mind could do but when he met the burning bush that all changed that all evaporated that'll left because now his whole life was now it wasn't just because he knew his mother raised him and said you're gonna be the deliverer and would tell the testimony of his birth and how you know and how he was led into Pharaoh's house and all those things that testimony burned in him he knew was true he believed it but God had to come and actually bring her bring it that it wasn't his mother's testimony no more it became his testimony for him I mean and when that happened his whole life revolved around that voice the voice of God that's all he cared about how the law hallelujah how we need that kind of thing amen you say well why are you saying these things this message is a reality it's Jesus Christ it's not it's not a bunch of ideas or understanding or reasoning it's a person I mean and God wants to influence us more than just being at you having a church culture more than just having a message culture it's not what it's about I miss about God coming down and visiting us what is going to hold when the squeeze gets worse what is going to hold it's you knowing God as what will hold you I mean the only reason you know what would happen if the authorities closed the doors what would happen would we still be believers I believe we still would be believers and may because it's not based on I'm not a believer because things are going well I'm not I believe it because we've got charitable status I'm going to believe it because we can meet here it's not why I'm a believer I don't believe because I've met him and he's a living reality to me hallelujah that's got to be the reason why could why could they believers under the Great Tribulation oh you know under the Dark Ages and you know that great persecution they didn't fold up and quit they kept going it didn't stop them it didn't faze them why because they had a heavenly visitation and they realized that these people when Jesus said don't fear the one that can destroy the body they fear the one that can destroy the body and soul in hell and they meant that one who said those things and they realized my life is in his hands they're not in the authorities hands it doesn't matter what they can do to me the only outcome of what they can do them is I can die and I want to go to heaven anyway so why should I worry don't let fear your faith never ever let fear your faith Holly that's a problem with the news it's all fear and this happened here and this happened here and this happened here and this is happening over here it's all fear and worry and you know why is the world like it is because it's being put in front of us people's minds are troubled by so many things why because it's all people read till people feed upon what we shouldn't be caught up on that we should be aware of things happening but we shouldn't be caught up in it hallelujah this thing should should what our main influence amen hello yeah so Moses you think about it he was his mother said the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacobs gonna you gonna deliver his children hallelujah and then here he was he made him I'm the God of thy father's Abraham Isaac and Jacob hallelujah they changed his life the Apostle Paul he was the incredible man he purposed in his heart is going to destroy this the sect of Jesus of Nazareth he had his own and maybe he went down the Damascus Road more than once but he met someone there he read about this God and the scrolls and he thought he knew who he was but when that one that the very God that had the word written I mean the one that anointed Moses to write the word or Isaiah or Jeremiah one of the prophets when that one came and met him he says Lord who art thou who are you hallelujah all the influences are destroyed right there the high priests influence the Pharisee the Pharisee influence the political others his own agenda he was easily as a Pharisee of the Pharisees to be a Pharisee the pharisees you're gonna put energy in you can't be a lazy Pharisee and be Pharisee the Pharisees you're gonna be devout you're gonna be serious you're gonna study you're going to dedicate your life you're gonna do everything all of that influence died because God didn't want him to be a Pharisee of the Pharisees he didn't wanted to climb some ivory tower he was the Prophet messenger to the first age he had to hit the place law and grace in their positions hallelujah hey men God wants to reveal himself to us he doesn't want us to be church members he doesn't want to go through a group he doesn't want us to go through a Great Tribulation he wants us to go on a rapture he wants us to meet him hallelujah hey man the Apostle Paul he had a desire to to put these ones in prison he made the Lord good lord who out there and the Lord said I am Jesus who now he says all so the voice speaks to him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom they're persecuted that's hard for thee to kick against the pricks his whole life was now a brother one calls a christ-centered life it wasn't a Jerusalem centered life or a temple centered life or a Pharisee centered life Christ word centered life and then he comes many years later through great hardships through great trials and he says to King Agrippa he relates the testimony of the road to Damascus he says I was not disobedient to the heavenly version hallelujah and then brother Branham would meet the pillar of fire on on their high River and even before that when he as a young young boy sees a whirlwind coming to a popular tree he's carrying water Ferrer's for his daddy still he he walked past that tree many times no doubt but this was a different time and he was all upset I want to go fishing I want to do this I don't want to carry water for my daddy still and it will one comes down to a tree and speaks to him don't smoke or drink or defy yourself in any way you know I've got to work for you when you're older what happened God came he was trying to get a hold of his prophet I mean that that there be a he would be the influence in this life amen and then brother bran would would would take take X 26 win win and Paul said I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision and he would relate that many times when he gave his testimony what what is this all about he said why are you talking about these things what influences you what what mold you what what makes you think a certain way what's influencing you you got to think like what is what is motivating me what is motivating me to be even here today amen is it because this is what I do this is how I've been raised or actually there's something in your life I meant God in your soul I want to be in the house of God I want to worship you lord Oh to give you praise I want to pull my life out I want to meet with you I want to hear your word I want you to mold and shape me more into your image I want to be more like you I want to see the seven virtues of my life I want to be kept with that divine love hallelujah I want to be made in your image I don't want to be just a little child in the Phaeton to be mature in the faith hallelujah I want to see the victory of the Cross in my life is that why you gather other I want to see heaven come down and change someone else I want to see angels come o to see the pillar of fire I want to feel your presence I want to be among hallelujah I want to have Liberty to praise you wherever I am is that why you come how lujah coz if that's why you've come that's what you shall receive how lujah paul's whole life was changed because of that road that that one moment on the road to damascus now Isaiah's in the temple we're gonna go it was gonna go back there but he was the first thing he he saw he saw the Lord High and lifted up and his train filled the temple and he saw the serums one was crying to the other saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty now so it wasn't just supernatural beings were there God was there now the serums are crying out and it's the same thing these holy yo so these seraphim's they're the burners they they they receive the worship also you know they they they cleanse the worshiper here they are crying holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty and it was just one of them crying to the other and the post of the place was moving because of us and then notice these ones they they they had six wings to cover their faces to cover their feet and tuefel were for flying hallelujah so these ones even than the prints of God who knew no sin had their eyes covered their feet covered and they and they had when today they were they were they were clothed with humility with reverence and hour in service and this is how we should be a members because how they were as how people should become with reverence I think we should Revere God we should respect God he's God he's not an idea he's not a man's thing he's God he gives you life he brought you to the earth he allowed you to be here even now amen you didn't find him he found you you weren't seeking the Bible says no man seekers after God God seeks after man Holloway he found you here and he made away I mean before you'd ever be coming to this life that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and when that was happened he had the Lamb's Book of Life and your names on it hallelujah he's God amen why do we worship him not because he gives us not because this is me I don't worship because he answers prayer I wish him coz of who he is he's worthy of worship I mean I don't worship because here because things are going well though I give blessings and then if things don't go well I don't know it's not base it shouldn't be our base now walk with them should never be a based on on how well you perceive your walk as going amen the but your worship should be based on coz of who he is I mean when he died he he he expressed the fullness of his love to you I have redeemed you wholly it's not just that but he said for holos in you I am Elijah the Prophet before the grain dreadful day the Lord whose eye God whose whose you in the scripture you hallelujah Amen that we don't have to go through a Great Tribulation so we should worship because he's God Amen hallelujah worship coz of who he is now notice I say who had been leaning on his arm and saw him die under the judgment of God and when he saw these holy beings that was next to the sight of God the serums crying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty and them holy angels covered their face holy angels covered holy faces in the midst of a holy God then who are we oh you Methodist Baptist Christian Pentecostal shall we then when holy angels had their holy faces under the wings to stand in the prints of God when the angels are being that's actually beyond angels angels don't stand there only the seraphim's there beyond the Angels and God so whole until they covered their faces and the presence of a holy God and the only thing they could say was holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty whew a special covering for them to stand in the presence of God what kind of a covering do we need we have they had to be covered now I want to say this the blood of Jesus Christ is all-sufficient see Christ never died for them seraphim's no no but they were created beings he never died for angels he died for sinners see he never died for holy people he died for the unholy hallelujah and as long as you think you're holy he never done you he never done you no good but when you realize you're nothing when when then he died he died for you see when you realize that you're nothing then he's the he's the one you are the one he died for God's all holy there's nothing to him but holiness that's all purity now let's note these wings for a few minutes we find out two wings covered to his face with my thing even holy angels covered their holy faces and the prints of a holy God and the only thing they could say was holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty holy holy holy Lord God Almighty and we told that they cried day and night that's the first step from God coming down day and night no letting up and you think that we make a lot of noise what do you think about millions of those around the throne with a voice that shook the temple pillars with only one of them crying holy holy holy I mean you know his voice shook the temple when millions of them crying around the throne holy holy holy Lord God Almighty holy holy holy Lord God Almighty with wings over their faces wings over their feet with wings and reverence respects oh my now there's no reverence or respects for anything that that talks about holiness you talk about holiness you're a Holy Roller there's no reverence their respects for neither God has people or his word now where are these bunch going to wind up where's this irreverent group going to wind up then where will this irreverent branch wind up the ones that hasn't got no respects at all for God you know it used to be if a woman or a man said they're Christian people respected it but today they they just kind of like to see how much fun they can make out of it see a reverend group me whoa see you know what this is the reason they're and they're not conscious that that's the truth they're not conscious of God they don't remember that the Bible said that the angels of God and kempt about those that fear him they don't only just come and visit them they stick their tents down Amen Alleluia amen so this is if angels are like that think about it how should we be he says but the blood the blood is the covering we need to go into his presence hallelujah now his presence also brings out what's in you heloo yeah now the Apostles the apostles were with the Lord three and a half years they walked with him they saw incredible things before the Lord called them to be to be disciples he didn't know what was in him they were fishermen tax collectors whatever they were you know but but but that seed that was in them laid dormant because we know that the scripture says in the book of Hebrews that the that the yo it says that that the for the earth was drinketh the rain that cometh off upon it and brings forth herbs meat for them that whom it's dressed even receives blessing from God but that which bear a thorns and briers is rejected and as nigh under cursing whose end is to be burned but beloved we are persuaded bear things of you and things that accompany salvation though thus we speak and that your and the Lord also see the rain falls on the just and the unjust you know the sunlight falls it comes on the just and the unjust so what is it so these seeds in the earth if you if you plant a garden you don't know what they are necessarily yeah but you plant them the best way to find out what's in them is to sunlight the right soil temperature and water and you'll see it come forth so it's like the disciples you know they were just regular Jewish people but in them was to be more than just a fisherman but it had to come to life so now they they they will call into the very presence of the one of he who who had eternal life now it brought out who who so for example being in his presence like that brought out who Judas really was you could never have told with your when Jesus he's a son of perdition who could have told you no Judas Judas was there at the Last Supper and and Jesus said that one of you is going to betray me they didn't all say oh it's Judas always thought he'd be the one they'll ask the question is it means that me who is it they couldn't even he was so close to he was so close to the Lord himself but they couldn't even tell what was in him I mean but the very presence of God was bringing out what was in Judas and you know they couldn't even tell who he was they couldn't even tell the reason he was even upon the earth was to betray the Messiah but the Prince the Lord brought it out when we're not I believe it's Mary took an alabaster box and ported upon his head was he when he said it meet it's recorded in Matthew Mark and I believe look but also John and it's only in the Gospel of John under that eagle anointing where where it actually describes Judas as being a thief the other Gospels some of the other disciples had as it says in Matthew 26 but when his disciples saw it they had egged Ignatian saying to what purposes this waste their mark 14 and there were some that had egged Ignatian within themselves and said why was this waste of the ointment made so aMDA and even the lion anointing and the ox anointing and in the and and I believe it's in Luke as well burned heaven here on me it didn't identify the heart of Judas but under that Eagle anointing that was on the Gospel John it doesn't say now it recorded more than just what was coming out of their mouths or out of Judas mouth and went to the heart of Judas but he didn't care about the poor he was the thief and he carried the bag so the word now in that end time I mean he with me identified what was in him hallelujah has the same eagle anointing that came upon the church in these last days as to identify what sinner people I mean when the people come into his presence it brings out what's within them hallelujah so even as you sit under the word what's happening is what in you comes out I mean what as in you as identify hallelujah but we're going to understand it's not only good seed in our lives I mean there's this carnality this pride there's all kind of things that come forth and God has to pluck them out I mean you take you take the Apostle Peter for example hallelujah here he was he's a fisherman God had ordained him already that he'd be the spokesman of x2 God knew when he is a fisherman before Jesus called him he is going to have the key to the kingdom God knew where he had to come to but here was here was Peter in the presence of God and and you know even the Lord Himself when when when when Jesus asked them who do men say that I am they said well you are Jeremias or Elias or one of the prophets but he asked the question who do you say that I am and Peter was the first once they down at the Christ the Son of Living God and then so even even you know even Jesus would say blessed are thou simon barjona flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father in heaven hallelujah and upon this rock I'll build my church but then even even Peter would would would come and he would try and yell with you and the Lord would say I'm gonna be crucified I'm gonna be handed to the heads of wicked men and Peter tried to stop him and and Jesus said to his face get behind me Satan hallelujah he wasn't talking about the man about the anointing upon the man so when you think about it if there was the question of who would betray him in the upper room I mean I mean you know who would betray him you'd really think would it be Peter Jesus already called him Satan but it wasn't him but Peter had to come to a place of crisis he says oh you know I'll die with you you know I won't deny you and the very word himself looked into Peters eyes and said before the crows three times you'll deny me thrice you will deny me and Peter basically said he didn't say it out loud but within his heart he said I won't know I won't oh my why God had to bring that out of him it was the presence of the Lord brought that out of Peter sometimes we come to places we fall on our faces and then we roll down the hill a few times and we think my my my how did I do this and and you saw the devil did it and the devil says he's saying don't give me credit for what you're doing we blame the devil too much sometimes oh it's Satan okay no it's just our humanity getting in the way oh yeah hey man so here he was penises I won't deny you law basically and then of course he does because the word is always true and he whips weeps bitterly he weeps bitterly and he goes his way hallelujah God had to have him there sometimes the vessels got to be crushed in order to be built hallelujah even even even brother ban talks about it in his ministry Lord just put me on the wheel crushed me over and built me up again hallelujah see here he was he had denied the Lord and then and then the Lord is resurrected and then the Lord tells he says go tell my disciples and Peter hallelujah and then now they're fishing that's a new day they're fishing and Peter and yeah and then they hear a voice on the bank have you caught any fish ever caught any meat and then no doubt Peter's frustrated no I mean fishing all night and then John looks that eagle vision looks tells Peter it's the Lord and then Peter there's something about a believer when you know you failed I've just got to get back in your presence lon Allu yeah cuz I know your Bloods enough I know you're forgiving me and he didn't know he didn't know he's gonna forgive buddy but he just dived off the boat hallelujah swam onto the bank came into the presence of the Lord he didn't know if he'd be received or condemned or what but he is something obscene I've got to go I've got to be with a masterís hallelujah hallelujah amen and then he says and then G says Peter do you love me I yes I love you feed my sheep Peter do you love me feed my lambs I think you asked them three times and then the last time Peter says Jesus do you love me Peter he says Lord you know I love you hallelujah even though he fails even though he his own pride got in the way amen didn't change that was the Prince Lord brought out really what was in him you know I Love You Lord hallelujah hallelujah and that holds true today amen Pilate Pilate had the opportunity here he was so influenced gonna finish with us maybe I should have finished that but Pilate was so influenced by the his political position in life he knew Jesus was not worthy to be crucified he says I find no fault in this man but because of his political position in the country he wasn't willing to let Jesus go and he had the opportunity you think about it here he's coming to this crowning part of his ministry he's gonna pay for the sins of the world he will never Pilate will never stand in his presence again and he didn't have one opportunity he had two opportunities just stand there before the Lord of glory hallelujah but he was so fixed and in his political position and the Jews are doing this and this is going on and Caesar will be upset and he missed his opportunity I mean to beg for mercy for his own soul it was the government that was influencing him to do that just the government what about you and I friends I trust I trust when you comb over your life you say what is influencing me the Lord knows he doesn't want us to be influenced just by man he doesn't want us to lean on anybody he wants us to lean on his word amen but that when we are all alone we are standing not because of someone else not because we'll even be seen but because we can stand because we are influenced by his word and it doesn't matter what people say or do around us I know peer pressure's real I know the pressure of society is real I know they look at us a funny way I know they don't like us the spirit of them hates us I know that's true but we have such a parentless word there's a power in this word I mean that we can walk unconscious of criticism we can walk unconscious of what the devil tries to do a pepra shall we can walk above those things I mean because of his presence hallelujah because remember when God reveals himself to us in these days we don't just have a visitation any Leafs no it gives us a visitation because he wants to fill us that he will be in us to the very one that made us is earnest and walked in us every day hallelujah so who is influencing you may it not be may it not be my culture might not be how I was raised might not be my personality may not be my past Amen may not be may not be trouble from the past or anything may not be any of those things influenced me might just be his word influencing me I mean that's how he wants us to be knows what this message came I mean that we would be built into his image I mean that we would walk because what is the gospel is that God and man become one that it's not you the church in God or you the preacher and God it's you and God alone lets Abraham was the pattern it was God in him walking through hardship trial whatever more he backs that a couple of times but God didn't quit on him I mean but it was him and about that but that's the pattern and that's the pattern of the believers life same thing with Abraham I mean God calls you leave leave this huh leave this place you used to leave this yo leave your culture leave leave whatever you used to do in the world and follow me who had that call I was a drunken University God spoke to me leave us walk with me I said Lord I'll walk with you however cuz he washed all my sins away you're worthy but did I know where I was going no way hallelujah if you went back through the past five years of your life I'd doubt very much most of us would even conceive of being here amen I can go back a bit further and I would never have even my wildest night miss think I'd been Wellington but God wanted us here that's where God wants you to be that's the main thing hallelujah I don't mean that as a joke I never planned about moving to this place but God said move there here we are hallelujah but you got to recognize God has your life pre-planned out I mean but you got to stay surrendered to him through every part of it he said I'm going through great things God is using those things to reveal himself in a greater way to you it's not a vain trial it's not he doesn't do it because he hates you it doesn't cause he's mad with you but he's pleased with you he wants to see you living your full potential amen he didn't want eyes they're living under the privilege of the king he wanted to be lifted up to see from eternity to eternity color is the same thing with us he doesn't want us under the influence of just some worldly think he wants us under the influence of his word that we can see from east we came from eternity and we're going to eternity hallelujah so we should just rejoice he say it's not easy it's not meant to be easy but it's not me to always be hard hallelujah but God is molding and shaping us you know we have mountaintop experiences I believe we're going to have a whole bunch of them at camp but you can't live on the mountaintop no fruit is growing on a mountaintop it's growing in the valley hallelujah but take your mountaintop experience down to the valley hallelujah and rejoice amen that's why you've got to go back you say Lord you called me here you think about the Apostle Paul let's I'm burned in his heart I was on the road to Damascus have you ever told yourself your own testimony have you ever relived it I was here in darkness you found me in darkness you called me out of darkness you washed all my sins away and he transformed me you fill me with your spirit your word became a living reality to me that became in your book hallelujah became so real you became more than life to me I mean you brought me out of the sick sugar starts this sickness this trial when I couldn't find the way I don't know the way to go you leave me out of there you put my feet on the rock you put me on plain paths hallelujah you guided me through all of trials and hardships you guided me hallelujah and God doesn't guide us a place just to say oh this is where I get off no when God said to Abraham he swore by himself you're gonna be the father of Nations he swore by himself now when it went went when God swore by himself to Abraham you're gonna be the father of Nations God invested all that he was into Abraham and Abraham not fail do you understand me if Abraham failed God failed and God cannot cannot fail hallelujah so know when when when this message became alive to you God is actually swearing by himself you are my bride hello you are part of me I mean I have redeemed you hallelujah and so he's saying that so he's investing himself into you amen there you can't fail because he can't fail hallelujah we should think about what he's done for us he said I don't see a way out just keep walking on walk by his word hallelujah and it will turn out okay amen amen let's have the musicians please amen brother Jeremy I'm gonna need your help [Applause] just keep walking on don't despair don't despair rejoice say Lord you have me in this place you have me in this current state you know
