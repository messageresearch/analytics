this song is called let god live and i wrote it earlier this year in june and some of the inspiration for it was um you know when in the bible when he talks about shame go and he planted his his fruit every season and then the philistines would come every season to steal his fruit but then eventually one year he just thought i can't do it but he cried out to the lord and says right now i'm going to stand against that enemy and then he just walked in that it just let the lord come and work through him and with that with that jawbone he just slayed all those philistines and they no longer came to destroy his land anymore for him and his family and that was part of the inspiration for the song and then also where brother brenham talks about the greatest battle ever ford is in the mind and then um i think it might have been been mentioning that right here you know like where the no man's land is is where the final enemy will be you know dealt with and that when when we have overcome that we have the final victory you know then so that was the inspiration for the song there are times of trouble and despair [Music] so many burdens to bear [Music] but i've learned to put my trust in god and let god live let god live let him live in me let go having the victory i open my heart to the things of god and let god live in the greatest battle ever for the enemy surrounds me like a flood i will let the lord raise the standard and let god live let god live let him live in me let go [Music] now i walk in perfect victory [Music] knowing jesus has come and set me free and i claim every promise off his word and let god let god let him live in me let god live having the victory i open my heart to the things of god and let god and let god and let god you
