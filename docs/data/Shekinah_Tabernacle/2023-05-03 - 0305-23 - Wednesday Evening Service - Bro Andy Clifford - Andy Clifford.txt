even think of putting our trust in for it all just changes Lord at all just that either Fades away or it comes up and it's hot and heavy and and then it disappears Lord but you never began and you'll never end and you're the same today as you always were and tonight we believe with the same Faith you gave the first church that you gave all the saints that we're so compassed about of witnesses Lord through all generations Lord they had faith in you and when they did there was great results and great fruit and lives were changed and they lured they overthrew Nations like we heard in that song Jericho was overthrown Lord Jesus and all the different places were overthrown because of faith in you and your promises and tonight we're calling on the same Jehovah God the same Jesus Christ for the same God to do the same things Lord big things small things all things father we believe in you we're your children we come to you as little children tonight Lord believing depending Lord and we don't come with our own ability our own strength or eloquence or anything Lord we come with faith in the Everlasting promises of God have your way tonight Lord Heal convert do whatever is necessary according to your will and your plan we hear Lord to serve you and we humble ourselves under your Mighty hand Lord speaker and here are alike for when needful Lord and I pray Lord that you would come and speak to us Lord in Jesus Christ's name I pray that you just take control of every Spirit Lord Jesus under the shed blood of the Spotless lamb let that blood speak and have preeminence in this place and in our lives for we surrender to you we acknowledge you you are our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and Lord your everything to us and our hope our faith our love our affections our imaginations our memories and every part every front of our life is all focusing on you Lord right now in this place we give you everything we give you all the worship and praise in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you Saints thank you musicians thank you brother David really appreciate um everybody and just does that thing work today that one there oh yes look at that and I got my glasses so we're all good amen I can see hallelujah praise the lord well it's good to be here in the house of the Lord and I'm so thankful once again for the opportunity to minister the word of God and it's not a light thing I tell you that for free it's not a light thing um it's a very serious thing but I believe that if we just trust in God as we just I mean there's been a theme of these songs then uh the Lord will amen he will give you what you need amen who's needful tonight amen who has needs on their heart I want you to just make them known to the Lord and invite him to your Pew invite them to where you're at he knows where you're at and he wants you to know where you're at he wants to give you Clarity he wants to give you Hope and Faith and all the good things that comes from him amen hallelujah I won't leave you standing too long I promise so let's um uh so yeah tonight let's turn in our Bibles to Hebrews 12 thank you 12 verse 1 and I want to speak on the subject of the cost of conquering I mean that was just a title but I I couldn't really title it well it was the cost of advancing it was the cost of conquering it was so close yet so far you know there was all these different things or knowing when to move so I just thought well I'll just say them all because that's kind of all of the thing in one so amen let's read so um it says here wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses aren't you glare for that great Cloud amen of witnesses let us lay aside every weight that does so easily beside us and let us run with patients the race that are set before us may the Lord bless his word you may be seated ah praise the Lord amen it's so good to be in the house of the Lord again tonight and I just want to encourage you with a few words that has been placed on my heart a while back and it just got refined and refined and as I was speaking on Sunday some more things came out um when I was at brother Moses there and we had a good service there and the Brethren were happy and we had a good time um they really pull and they really make you feel tired after the service so oh my someone there's got some real uh real Apostolic Faith you know and I believe that's here too you know because I I definitely feel tired after preaching any service so but something about that place oh my goodness my amen hallelujah you know and you sing and you know we're so used to this acoustic here where it absorbs all our sound but when you sing in the hall it's like you can hear all these reverberations and acoustic and you really can get some harmonies going you know I thought man we need to just take the ceiling off you know let's just take it off let's worship so high so hard so fast and so good that the ceiling just disappears hallelujah amen well praise the Lord see um I want to speak on the cost of conquering or the cost of advancing you see when it's okay right when you kind of just float along it's all good it's plain sailing you just sit you turn up to church on Wednesday and you enjoy the service and then you turn up to church on Sunday and you enjoy the service okay and you're just sitting there and you're enjoying that and you go to work during the week and you enjoy that and and life is good you have a little trial here and there and you're just coasting but if you want to advance if you want to conquer if you want to take some more of your land if you want to take some of your family if you want your children to come in if you want things to advance in your life spiritually I'm not talking about now Prosperity stuff that you can go and naming and claim it and get houses and buildings and lands if God calls you to that praise God but for I'm talking about spiritual inheritance now when that if you've got something in your heart and I believe I'm speaking to people that do have a desire in their heart to advance a desire in their heart to lay hold of their inheritance a desire in the heart and a sick of the devil sweating on their land sick of the devil holding back sick of the devil in other people's lives holding them back on children's lives or whatever it may be well then it's gonna it comes at a cost and the cost is subject to you the cost is shown to you by God because when you begin to advance then you'll go through trials and he'll ask you what are you willing to give up what whites are in your life that are holding you down what's encumbering you amen and what's easily besetting you you know that word easily besetting it's very interesting skillfully surrounding every front is what that means so these sins these things these falling short of the muck these breaking the rules unbelief or doubts and and and doing these things that are wrong and breaking the laws of God right they they are skillfully surrounding every front of your life every front so I'd say I was like well what are the fronts and and I don't know maybe the Lord spoke to me I'm not too sure but I got I got I got information so information came see touch feel smell here this is the physical fronts on my help me Lord then there's more fronts there's conscience affections oh my imaginations Lord help me Lord help me memories oh Lord and affections and reasoning oh so you can see there's fronts and if you leave those fronts there there's devils and there's schemes and there's all sorts of Master plans that have been around for thousands of years that are trying to skillfully take you down hold you down the Bible calls them weights and they will be delivered to you better than any FedEx better than any Amazon Prime post or anything they will be delivered to you they come to your house in the form of a box of snakes and I just encourage you to never sign for the box of snakes never sign for these easily besetting sins and if they're in your life because of inheritance things that you're born with ways you've been up raised that's that there is going to be a Deliverance for you tonight who believes that God delivers amen who believes that God if you had the same faith that everyone else that got delivered don't you think you'll get delivered to he's not impartial he's no respecter of persons so if there's something in your life that you need deliverance from have faith in God in the finished work of the Lamb blood sacrifice that's all it's very simple it's not a big climbing the steps on your knees to the Saint Peter's Basilica you know some Penance or some idea of religion or some groveling oh my you know I was just listening to some sermon today I listen to a few but one of them the prophet was talking about how um actually I'll come back to that soon I won't go into that right now because otherwise I'll get way ahead of myself as you you know we get excited up here but I want to be a good boy so easy so lay aside I just want this is a little Foundation lay aside every weight like easily beset now that word wait is to be encumbered and I found a definition of encumber and I just want to read these out to you all synonyms of encumber so just think about things that would encumber you and the different stuff that it can do in you to you clog cramp embarrass oh my fitter oh aren't you so glad that he breaks every fitter every fitter you don't have to be fitted you don't have to be encumbered you don't be held down you know we will travel by thought I thought man that's the greatest form of Transport traveling by thought can I have a turbo up here please I am so hot I haven't even started preaching I'm like cooking is it is it just me it must be just me hold on let me just loosen up a little bit hallelujah amen excuse me is I don't want to be too too rough I'll just tighten a little bit oh amen let's just let's just uh let's just worship the roof off this place amen feta hamper I mean some of these words we're going to have a bit of a uh you know going to go through some history here of the words we've heard way in the past but handcuff oh my handicap you know a handicap is a is a deficit it's something that's that you have in your life that stops you from being your potential or what you are meant to be or something that you has put on you to hold you back you know in golf if someone's really really good now I might be wrong I'm not a golfer but as far as I understand if you're really good you have a certain handicap on a field that you start off with to kind of equal your game out with the with all of the normal people so that you can actually you know I think is that right does anyone know about golf is that right so if you're really good then the the rules of that course will put a handicap on you or you get one as a person registered golfer and so you know the devil wants to put a handicap on you he wants to weigh you down he wants to hold you into a natural realm he wants to hurt your prayer life and take away your ability to advance on your inheritance but we're called to advance we're called to a war we're called to step forward and not just step forward but run towards the enemy fearlessly that's why as I preached the other few weeks ago about the atmosphere of War that's why we have an atmosphere that's why we will sing you know we don't just come to church just to sing nice songs to stretch our vocal cords and pull it and please God yes we worship in God but in the process of worshiping God what happens is he comes it changes everything then the fear goes then the anxiety goes then the malice goes then the lust goes then all of these things that weigh us down to hold us in a natural condition that encumber us that weigh us that are skillfully surrounding every front of our life but the Bible says lay them aside and tonight I encourage you it's time to lay them aside it's time to get serious with God and I ask God Lord please help me to get into the spirit of your burden because sometimes you get so um encouraged excited by the Revelation and how it all comes together that you miss the very heart of it and sometimes we sit here and we get we're just learning don't learn actually you can learn but just don't just learn tonight I want you to open your heart and say Lord speak to me on a spiritual level and let me feel the holy ghost in my conscience instead of feeling all these other Spirits in your conscience all the time from all these other skillfully surrounding entities why not let the Holy Spirit take control of those places let the Holy Spirit you know Jehoshaphat he one of the things he did was he he put more garrisons around his Board of land but he doesn't just stay there you know what he did after that he then began to teach the law of God all throughout the land and then the fear of God fell on the enemies and then they started thinking twice about attacking Judah you want the devil to think twice about attacking you and I believe that you're equipped you've got all the resources to be in that condition you've got all the resources to to run like David ran towards Goliath amen all the resources within your life and if it's not within you it's time tonight don't leave without it don't leave without it lay aside those things that hold you back on the ground to make your prayer life boring or make your Bible reading boring that's what the devil wants he wants you to have a boring prayer life a boring Bible study life he wants Church to be boring children I hope you have I have your attention the devil wants Church to be boring for you that's that's one of his jobs he probably assigns Devils to the children make sure they're bored make sure they can't understand it but tonight lay aside that normal thinking pattern lay it aside it's a weight it's encumbering you it's going to hold you natural it's time to be Supernatural we're going to change bodies soon we're going in a Rapture soon so let's just get serious with God about laying these things aside now I'm preaching to myself here because I've got things I need to lay aside and you know the closer you get to God the more you see what there is otherwise you just can't see the wood for the trees right you have no discernment without the spirit of God the prophet said that we don't what we need is not just an emotional thing we need something higher than that we need it holy ghost lifting up he said when the spirit comes down to lift you you see more and then when you see more then he says now you can see Ichabod marked on all the portals of all these Babylonian things because Babylon out there this is a very skillfully crafted environment of Satan's Eden all out there everywhere oh my any entity that fears the people is like Saul you know Saul King Saul he feared what people thought and therefore he came under their leadership and that's what lost him as Kingdom he lost his kingdom because he feared men and now look at politicians they fear what people think so therefore they go with the flow of the spirit of the nation and then they just stuck schools and and I just think I just it just grates against me so much like businesses that paint these stupid rainbows on their stuff and they have no care for homosexual people at all they don't care about them they don't give us stuff about homosexual people they just want to look good and I think the ones that really care about gay people is us who want to see their soul saved they want to see the reason why are you confused and dysphoric in your genes uh what do you call that thing gender why they're not even allowed to ask in Psychology you know that they're not even allowed to ask psychologists they come at schools I feel like I don't know who I am or what I am they just get given all the prescriptions to change the agenda and no questions oh my and they're not allowed if they question it then it's uh what do they call it discrimination that's really bad so this the society is falling apart and it just makes me sick to see these businesses that fear what people think the fear of man is such and I I mean this is one big trial in my life was the fear of men fearing what people thought of me as a minister and I still fight that it's something I have to pray when I go in there and before I preach anywhere preaching I pray Lord please take all fear of what people think and try to make myself something or anything just take it all away because the moment you're delivered from the fear of what people think God can use you to your full potential without any hindrance but your old nature will always fear those things your old nature is connected and I'm in this sermon tonight Saul is your old nature and as the time goes on he gets more and more ferocious you know that Soul gets more and more ferocious if you look at the story of first Samuel Saul got worse and worse and worse and worse and worse didn't he he got worse and worse and the things it's so unreasonable man if Saul had just gone you know what God I am accepting your plan David's King he would have had a good time you know that but the old nature just can't do it that's why God gives you power over your old nature so that you can lay that thing down and all of its encumbering weights and it's going to be there till you get the body changed but if you can lay those things aside and let God come in and take all the fear away from your life you will no longer be encumbered there's other words hobble who wants to hobble along just hobble along in your life hobbling along crippled or just maimed in a little bit just silenced you know feeling a bit down feeling depressed feeling a bit empty that's what the devil wants he wants to weigh you down but I can encourage you tonight let God speak to you have faith in this moment because if you have faith in this moment God will he could speak a word that will unlock that thing in your life and show you why you've been weighed down all your life or maybe weighed down for a year or two years or six years whenever things started to do those things in your life the only thing you cannot just go on you know what I'm gonna just go and do a big um profile of my life and try and find out why I'm like this nah don't do that actually just ask God yeah if you ask God he's the one that knows all about you he knows why these things are why they are you know people flocked to Brother branham's house to his office to wherever they could to get discernment they wanted to know why they're like they are and then and the Lord would show him all these many times he already knew what they were coming to ask for and he would just tell them he had it all written down on paper the spirit of God would preempt him and give him all the answers for them so that it didn't take too long probably I don't know but anyway because you can imagine everyone in the world wanted to see that one man yeah no matter what people say today about him on the internet all that rubbish everyone wanted to see him and all ministers and all the great prominent people all wanted to know they all wanted to hear from him they all wanted to see him people were interested in their condition they wanted to know where am I at according to God where am I at and you know what the profit's gone but the same God who sent the prophet is here with the same word that can come across your heart to this tonight and speak to you and something to liberate you so that you're no longer incumbent or weighed down you know those things on the front of your imagination or your conscience or your affections you know man the affections oh they just there's so much in this world good things can take your affections and spread them until you've got about a millimeter of effects I don't know if you've got 100 ml of affections you've got one mil in everything and so when you when it comes to God you've only got one meal for him because you like so much stuff but sometimes we've got to take inventory yeah of our life and go what I've got so many things going on I've got so many pots on the stove in my life I've got so much I'm incumbent and therefore your affections become flat you know you really become like a mild person not much emotion just going through the motion oh my I'm not going to go and preach on every single one of these but hold back I mean you could just have a whole sermon around these list hold up impede inhibit interfere um okay this is an old word Monaco Monaco has anyone who heard Monaco before Oh my obstruct shackle short circuit we know what short circuits for power of God don't we selfishness oh my that's one thing that the devil can weigh us down with you wonders sometimes help me Lord stymie oh man there's a real British type of word isn't it stymie tie up and tremble oh my tremel sounds pretty um I don't even know the word for that but yeah anyway hey look in the Amplified version of Hebrews 12 1 it says this this is therefore since we are surrounded by so great a clout of witnesses who by faith have testified the truth to the truth of God's absolute faithfulness I love that his absolute faithfulness I mean that's powerful those two words his absolute faithfulness so you can have faith in an absolutely faithful God Anytime Anyplace and know that the word that's come and been released over the age it's going to bring the devil to a showdown and defeat him under any circumstance any place anywhere anytime that's the message that's been given over the age the full restoration of all truth delivered to the people why because he wants to prepare a bride he wants to clothe her in his wedding garments and this spiritual power and all those words that's been unveiled to the people stripping off every unnecessary and cumbering weight and the sin which does so easily and cleverly entangles us let us run with endurance and active persistence the race that is set before us in that word run comes in Greek text and commonly used it was considered a perilous exertion so it wasn't just some running you know the McDonald's fun run around Wellington this was a perilous exertion that required all your strengths have you ever been in a trial or been in something oh man I did Army Cadets and there was many times where it was perilous exertion because we were naughty so we got it even worse so you know we'd get whipped awake at four o'clock in the morning and run over gravel and bare feet and things like that that's what happens when you mischievous in the Army even Army Cadets and I'd hate to think what it was like in the army but you see there were things that we go through in life and we're called to a high calling of God that when we run if you the only way to actually run this race with patience of course is to be able to lay aside these things that God shows you in your life this is why we come to church this is why we read our Bible this is why we pray this is why we Fellowship you know it doesn't always have to be natural Fellowship it can be spiritual we can actually have a Faith Fellowship where God begins to discern our heart and fellowship you know that you could be chewing over what someone's preached or you could be just having a you know you're so moved sometimes there's just been a powerful presence of God and you start thinking differently in that thought time and you begin to Fellowship around a specific thought and then God will unlock that thing in your life why are you like you are and it's time to lay that aside Peter didn't stay sitting down when he was in the prison the angel of the Lord came to him knocked them on his side because there was people praying and he got knocked on his side and he got up and what you need to get up you need to run it's time to run if you don't get up the chains will stay on you you'll stay where you are but when you feel the pulsation of faith who knows what a pulsation of faith God just comes in a moment or he begins to strike something in your life and he speaks something and you see it stand and walk out of it do not hesitate because God wants to do something in your life and take you from to so you can advance yeah advancing because we're in a time now where our Advance is the devil's Denise there's no other Church ages there's no other dispensations or there is but they're not like this okay the church ages are coming to an end the Gentile dispensation is coming to an end the gospel's going back to the Jews soon it's all happening right there's a big change our Advance our children's Advanced children when you advance when you take things of your own that God has given you that brings the devil out it pulls him down from his position of Lies his position is CR is is created on lives I was listening to something today and they say that all these politicians of today a lot of them are so bad that they failed their way there and they still get given these positions because they're so useless that they are just a puppet but God doesn't want puppets he doesn't want usually on your failure he's actually looking for a people that will take inventory and just say Lord when you speak I will act Hallelujah so that we're no longer encumbered Hallelujah and there we are I want to read here from 1 Samuel 23 13. and I'm going to read something that's very very striking to me and I just want you to have I want to have your undivided attention and for you on the the streaming don't go and do other stuff while you're watching don't go iron your clothes or you know I know we've done it we all kind of do it sometimes but be serious In This Moment because God is Not subject to geography and so I want you to listen to these things it's not going to be long don't worry it's going to be short and sweet and hopefully by the Lord's Grace convicting and Powerful then David and his men which were about 600 arose and departed out of Kila this is around the time Saul was pursuing David now and whether so ever they could go and it was told Saul the old nature now that David which is the type of Christ in this particular sermon was escaped from Kila and he forbid to go forth and David Abode in the wilderness and strongholds and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of zif and Saul sought him every day you see as the time gets closer and closer your old nature teams up with the devil and seeks to pull you down every day but the good thing about that is the devil shows us cards so God has given the devil rope in this hour so that all the things that's hiding will come out so that they can be dealt with so do not run away from the battle do not desert your battleground don't be ashamed when you have failed because when you fail the devil will show his cards and he gets defeated and tonight if you're living in a failure why not let the devil show us cards and and let him be defeated but if you don't know and you don't fail and you don't do anything you don't abunk the devil just hides down in your life Saul doesn't get very upset but David was advancing you see David didn't just advance in Pride and try and take it all he just let God do it yeah you notice that he didn't do it himself he didn't have some massive bigger gender and trying to Rally no no he was just flowing with the spirit of God he never took the throne he let God do it but you can see that David as he Advanced his old nature now saw this troubled manfiering nature was beginning to to take him and try and seek him every day but just let the devil show his cards and when he does then it's time for battle and David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life and David was in the wilderness of zeph in a wood and Jonathan step in Jonathan now because he's one of the main themes of the sermon Saul's son arose and went to David into the wood and strengthened his hand sorry I was going to read that screen but it's I like reading this one and strengthened his hand where am I uh there in God and he said unto him fear not for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee and thou shalt be king over Israel and I shall be next unto thee see there was a vision this is what they that Jonathan had in his heart and David was very much going to do this this was part of it right and or that also saw my father knows and they too made a covenant before the Lord It's very key they made a covenant before the Lord and David Abode in the wood and Jonathan went to his house on the gravest mistakes he ever made in his life actually probably the final mistake he ever made Jonathan a mighty man of Valor a man that had faith a man that did exploits a man that was so generous he gave all of his stuff to David a man that was faithful to the church so close so close Saturn David's meetings time after time so close yet so far likewise Luke 14 33 whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he has he cannot be my disciple it's very serious this is real Christianity we're not on a picnic we're not just walking in the park we're not just having a good time I'm having a good time by the way I'm sure you all are having a good time but it's also a hard time it's also a battle it's also life and death and God is calling for disciples he's calling for people that are willing to lay everything down he's calling for a people that are willing to lay aside every weight and sometimes we get comfortable with the weights and it helps us to sit on the pure and we can't get up and even praise God never even stand to give the word of God a standing ovation just sit down and I'm not just trying to make you stand up I'm just saying that sometimes it's weights that hold us down because the word's not affecting us we're just so tied up with all these affections and everything in the world and all the stuff that's going on we're just so busy and therefore when we come to church the word is just information but it's time for a change if you want this word to Rapture you it's time to lay aside every weight and sin that does so cunningly surround every part of your life surrounding your conscience and affections and memories ah your reasoning even now right now the devil will be reasoning right now I can guarantee there's lots of little clouds of reasoning going on this is just how the devil works oh Andy's just getting carried away oh this and that he said this before he's preached that oh yes this is Andy you know but weird and crazy and don't just don't buy into that look past the silly preaching vessel because it's for the foolishness of preaching God chose to save Souls and so this we're in the last moments of the last days oh Lord help us Hallelujah this is these are the weights that Jonathan had to let go of social status natural safety financial support religious position his family his crown his Creature Comforts get to get rid of a lot of things right and see he loved David he was so on fire for David and yet he died and the soul is better he died under the banner of his old nature do not die under the banner of your soul do not stay under the banner of your selfish life it is time to lay it down because God is going to do great things in this church and your exploits are going to happen under the manifestation of the sons of God are you going to be part of it who is in it's time it's time to be in because God is calling us higher but to be called higher you need to be weightless Hallelujah I want to be weightless who wants to be weightless it's weightless free impervious to every attack of the devil that no matter whether he comes to your memories and he gives you a thousand memories or a thousand lusts or a thousand things on your conscience or your affections oh my doesn't penetrate because you're so full of love you know Noah's Ark in the wood that he used who's soft Acacia would and they probably looked at Noah and thought you're crazy man you're gonna build an arcade of the soft stuff we're going to saturate and sink to the bottom of the ocean no buoyance seeing I was so soft that when the pitch cam it made it perfect and that's the same thing for us if you just soften your heart so that God can fill you with oil we need oil give me oil Jesus father Hallelujah okay can I play this Jonathan why are we watching this some of you have probably seen children I want your attention now watch this thing I knew how to get the children's attention now they can see now watch this Jonathan was not willing even though he was he didn't do it so yes Jonathan was a great man did great things and we'll go further into Jonathan soon but he didn't let go of his King he didn't let go of his father he didn't let go stayed under the banner of Saw and so he held on to the thing that he died under now we don't want to hold on to things that we'll die under don't hold on to things that you don't need to hold on to don't hold on to it I think Ben preached it a few years ago don't be a protection for the devil don't be a Aid in bed at him I can't remember what he used they would use the word like a protection like a guard don't be a devil guard you know when you're holding things and you're too ashamed or you know you're too scared to get help it's time to let go you've been given the power to loose you know that's a power God can give you it's an anointing it's a power he gave the church the power to bind and to loose and there's things in our life that we need to let go so that we can go from the camp of Saw to the camp of David okay so I go to the next one that one and just click the button or do you want to click it sorry it's a very old video so please excuse the um the man isn't wearing very many clothes but I'm sure we can look past that it's very unclear is this sound just watch I don't think you need sound anyway you see if we hold on to the weights long enough it's going to get worse for us God is calling us to let go and let God this little guy here was not willing to let go and now he's been caught in the snare of the Fowler and the fowl has got him now he's trapped he will he can never get away we don't want to die under the banner of Saul we can go to the next video now there's two videos that was the monkey now this is the baboon his forebears have had thousands of years to adapt to the Kalahari so he needs very little liquid and he knows where to find it an insignificant looking dry twig tells him where to dig anyone else would die of thirst in a few days in this treacherous desert that doesn't look like a desert but he can survive for months on end he unearth the bulbous root which is really just a solid lump of wood with hard fibers that are merely damp civilized man would need some pretty complicated technology and Machinery to get water out of it but he uses the very simplest of tools his scraper is a stick that has been split to give it a sharp edge and he produces some dry looking shavings but you take a handful Point your thumb at your mouth squeeze very hard and wait for it the baboons always have a secret supply of water and they're not going to tell anybody where it is and when a Mahal ahadi Ventures into the deep Kalahari on a hunting trip he has to find water because unlike the Bushmen he doesn't know how to make liquid from a root but he has his own way of finding out where the water is first he laboriously drills a hole in a giant ant Heap when he is sure a baboon is watching him because he knows baboons are incurably inquisitive next he put some wild melon seeds into the hole and works them in so that they drop into a hollow then he saunters off knowing the baboon is burning with curiosity temptation that's how the devil lures the boom doesn't trust that women on every front so he plays it cool but he's dying to know what gives in that confounded hole finally Mr inquisitive can't take it any longer he's got to know what's in there he reaches in grabs A Fistful and now his hand's too big to come out he will not let it go so to drop the sea he could feel his hand now he let's go this is how the enemy works he lures he comes on every front to give us these invitations and things all around us to lure Us in and then we end up holding on to things or we've had things that we've been brought up with and then as we become Sanctified as God begins to work in our life then we start to see oh wow that's actually not good yeah these things in my life aren't actually good you know and you start to see an image before you now God doesn't just force you you know maybe back in a legalistic hour that you would have been forced to conform and then you live with those things but you're just on the outside you look good on the inside you're still a ravening wolf you know and and they but it's that ravening wolf nature that the Lord and his Mercy in this hour give the devil enough rope to hang himself so the devil's been given enough rope to hang himself now I want to zoom right out onto an age level as we know everybody here I'm sure you know that in the 1940s and 30s and that that the devil was given the key to the bottomless pit and he all the smoke came out and all the sciences and everything became so tree of knowledge based right and and he was given the key to the bottomless pit and smoke came out hell came on the earth why and I asked this question and it was showing me because the devil needed to be exposed he was hiding down in hell and he was aloof and Elusive and and and and and he needed to come out because he needed to get dealt with that's why he's been given the key to come out of the closet to come out of hiding and he's been given a rampage key and he's got sciences and televisions and movies and music all from Hollywood and all California and Rome and all those things right everything all the conspiracies and a lot of the mature and some of them are just a bit extreme but they're all there and there's things going on and the devil's exposed so you can be very very happy that the devil's exposed out there but now let's make it personal because it's a personal thing too because that exposure and that how the Lord has allowed the devil all all this license in this end time so that he can be exposed out there but also so that you can go through temptations that will try and get you to hold on to things and try and get you why because God wants to purify you God wants to change you God wants to give you character God wants to prepare you for the millennial Reign he wants to prepare you for a Rapture he wants to take you through a character that you will spend eternity with just think about that he's developing a character in your life for your eternal personality wow so if you think oh it's hard yes it's hard but there's a reason and in eternity you'll be so thankful that you went through all these things because that's going to be your personality and your character Hallelujah Jonathan a great church member but he was a man of faith and Valor he did great things man you can look at the life of Jonathan and say this was a model believer and he was a model believer but but for the sake of this particular thought I want you to see Jonathan as the most great moral believer but the the very thing that he needed to do he didn't actually follow through he stayed he went back to his house at that moment to me he should have run with David and I'll show you someone that did so and I believe that it's time to run to David David is Christ David is our Lord Jesus Christ he's the one that's anointed to bring forth everything that's promised to us don't you think that window there was benefits to be part of David's camp they came under greater grading things it was amazing they had Adventures who liked Adventures who liked an adventurous life who likes a life full of of Life and Adventures and change and and good things except you know wildly unexpected amazing experiences this is what Christianity is it's not boring just sitting in church listening to sermons that's the greatest life when you truly lay aside every weight and God can cause you to fly who wants to fly spiritual flying you know you can spiritually fly because you've got an eagle anointing we're in the age where the Lord's poured out the eagle anointing and it's not just an eagles on the ground it's a flying needle so you can fly hi Hallelujah man of Faith about he was a man of faith in Bella he had a supernatural testimony you know when he took uh his armor Bearer and they went up and they defeated all of the ammonites and they said if we go if they call us up we'll go up right who knows the story and the God will deliver if they say don't go if they don't call us up then God won't Deliver us we'd stay and they called them up and they delivered he had a supernatural testimony he had a covenant with David before the Lord he had he was friends with David we can be a great friend to the Lord but Judas was a friend to the Lord God caught Jesus called him friend he called the rich General a friend he called him these titles what a great title but it's got to be more than that he wants your friendship he wants you to come under his Covenant he wants you to really the only way to truly come under his Covenant is the very thing that Jonathan didn't do was David he didn't give up everything he wasn't willing to give up his family his life everything all his Ambitions dreams he would have been you know since he was a boy he would have had great Ambitions and he would have been the King's son he's going to be the king one day and he would have had story times and Bedtime Stories and all those things so he had this great thing and he had to give all that up and we've got the best things that we have to give up to there's Ambitions that we have to give up there's all this background that we need to give up but see Jonathan even that with it all he was willing to surrender his throne yeah yeah in agreement resistant to Saul's rash leadership you know you can sit here and you can be in a Pew and you can be resistant to your old nature you can be resistant to the rash leadership of your old nature and still be holding on to it still be under its Banner but you're resisting and you're just resisting it and I call that it's like a pharisaic religion where you're just a Pharisee over your old nature and you're just trying to push it down and and really all you need to do is totally surrender everything so that God can give you a new birth faithful and honest he was amen and extremely generous oh my how many people sit in a Pew in an extremely gym give all over the Christendom give and give their lives servants and yet it's their life that's their time and outside of church it's all about them it's all about what they want to do and if they're not feeling very well they don't come what about turning up to the to The Fray even when you don't want to oh my Lord help me amen faithful and honest see all these things are great characteristics actually they really do bring the very description of a real believer right this is a real believer this is someone that's got a real believer but yet even with all those things Paul said though I um have all these things though I preach the gospel to the whole world and though I give my life to be burnt and though I know all the Mysteries and have great charity work unless I have charity which is the Holy Ghost God's perfect love in my heart I'm nothing right so you can have all of this great stuff and have the idea of coming in an intellectual Covenant you see Jonathan made that Covenant with David but did it happen did it actually happen no that Covenant didn't actually transpire it didn't take place and they made it before the Lord they were all sincere but the very thing that he needed to do was to jump ship he needed to know when to run because death was in the camp that he was in and death is in the camp of your old nature demise is in the camp of your old nature way down to a natural experiences in the camp of your old nature but it's time to know when to run children it's time to know when to run to go from being a Pew warmer to a soul winner hallelujah how many Souls have you guys has anyone won a soul to Christ since you've spent years and years as a Christian how many Souls have you won just asking you should know and I'm not saying you haven't I'm just saying how many is there a desire in your heart or are you comfortable you don't want to cause and a shame you don't want to make someone uncomfortable what about when they go to hell they're going to be uncomfortable where to used to being comfortable we're too used to being extremely generous in church faithful and honest resistant to rash leadership and rash old nature and willing to surrender everything well all these things but what about dying for yourself what about leaving the camp what about knowing when you should run run out change Lord help me make sense oh there's another man and this is a very this is a tragic story and yet he knew it around who knows the story of a Bible well I don't know how you say his name he was a priest he actually became a successful priest he was probably a nobody before this but there's a great event that took place in the pursuit in Souls rash crazy pursuit to kill David 's whole family was killed his parents his cousins every baby every mother and he would have been too but he knew to run do you know when to run those of you run for your life it's time to run for your life from the soul that will take you to hell and if your if it doesn't take you to Hell it'll make it hell on Earth for you and Hell on Earth for those around you because you'll be up and down and subject to Saul but it's time to run from that Soul nature it's time to know because that Soul's coming for you he's coming for your family and he will cause them great ruin unless you run to the camp of David and the King said Thou shalt surely die Obama abimelech is dead and he was the king so the priest that David came to real quick and he got Goliath sword over him and gave him the bread and he didn't really know that David was a future to his old nature to Seoul you see there was a changeover of kingship there was a change over of dispensation in Israel from a king who feared man from an old nature that was a man-faring complex nature That Couldn't truly obey the Lord that would just go so far you see Saul was a man of great works he did battles that said that the war was sore against the Philistines all the days of Saul he wasn't lazy he had a vision he was a he was a king that had the idea we must fight all the time so he wasn't just a useless King except he had a nature That Couldn't truly obey God he was complex and he feared what people thought and it was his great demise and yet a him a look sorry he was the king that David came to and now he didn't realize how grave Danger he was in and this is very much like it for some of us and the King said Thou shalt surely die a himelect vow in all thy father's house and the King said unto the footman that stood about him turn and slay the priest of the Lord because their hand also is with David and because they knew when he fled and did not show it to me but the Servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the Lord and the King said to doing Turn thou and fall upon the priest and don't be ignite Edomite turned and he fell upon the priest and slew on that day 85 people that did wear the linen ephod so 85 priests and one of the sons of a himalayk did I just skip something uh uh no and one of the sons of a himalayk the son of ahitab named abayatha escaped and fled after David that's the very thing that we need to do and if you are not in David's Camp if you're not in his Safeguard it's time to flee it's time to run from Seoul and I'm not saying that you need a run from the devil you need to fight the devil but you need to run from the camp that's holding you down you need to lay aside the weights that does so easily beset you so that you can be free to worship like it was in the time of David a buyer that escaped and fled after David and abias that showed David that Saul had slammed the Lord's priests and David said unto a biother I knew it that day when dying the Edomite was there that he would surely tell Saul I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy Father's House abide that with me fear not for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life but with me Thou shalt be kept in safeguard let me read that again but with me Jesus Christ Thou shalt be kept in safeguard Hallelujah he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake a buyer that lost everything he lost his whole family he lost everything and that type is a very drastic example of how much you need to completely forsake the opinions of your whole family completely forsake the opinions of your school friends completely forsake the opinions of your own old nature Soul that's trying to kill you right now in this place you can receive the Holy Ghost right now in this place you can receive the new birth if you are willing to be like a biother and escape the camp Flee for Your Life to the camp of David and thou shalt be kept in Safeguard and repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin and that you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost flee why there is time flee why there is an opportunity because there is an opportunity God is full of opportunities the word is full of opportunities church is full of opportunities the Bible is full of opportunity but are you willing to flee to the camp of David or are you going to find your life and keep your life or are you willing to lose your life lose your social status lose your friends lose your reputation be thought of as a cult following weirdo are you willing all the disciples were willing to be called cult followers even Paul was called a heretic by religious people all the denominations all the denominations called Paul a cult following heretic are you willing today are you willing to suffer the reproach or will you stay under the banner like Jonathan did can you just imagine a good man a man with a great testimony a man that loved David more than the love of woman do you know that not homosexual no it's a love that this society's lost real friendships and I need the Lord to help me have real friendships because the Bible said that the love of many shall disappear because of iniquity and so the society has actually got no real love Jonathan had love and David had such a love for each other as the young ones today are called BFF BFF but ebf extremely best friend forever just so high in best friend BFF and yet he died under sore let's not sit in a church and stay in the camp of our old nature don't sit in your own life it's time to lose your life so that you can rule life when I was in prison I've just got a couple of testimonies and then we'll close when I was in prison don't look at that problem you're coming up [Laughter] sorry when I was in prison the Lord came to me and I'm in a real prison now not just a spiritual prison but he's come to me in spiritual prison too but this is really prison 15 years 12 years ago whatever it was through oh however long it was 20 2006. so and I was in prison and you know the Lord came my way and I began to believe I started reading the Bible and I read testimonies I read brother Brandon's testimony and the supernatural books and you know that really opened my eyes to I was an atheist before that and I had plans to become an international drug lord I don't know some of you may know that but I and I wasn't just joking I was there I had all the recipes I had all the Syndicate all of the the leaders the importers from around the world we were doing it but God had other plans but still I gave I I went through the process of sinner's prayer and I gave my life my heart to the Lord but I did I knew that if I surrendered my whole life I would lose the desire if I I knew somehow and I couldn't explain it I couldn't put it to words only in hindsight there's 20 20 Vision right it's always 20 20 Vision when you look back if you've got the Lord now so I was scared of losing my identity I wasn't willing to give my identity to the Lord and because of that when I got out of prison sure enough I had my hand in the jar and I was holding on to a few little melon seeds a few melon seeds and I would not let them go those were weights that held me down when I got out of prison I got back into drugs I did drugs again but the grace of God amen brought me to the bottom I was The Prodigal Son my I was really The Prodigal Son and worse because I wasn't even allowed to eat the pig's food I was like under the foundation of the pigs pigsty I got pushed out of the world I got pushed out of drug Rings didn't even want me there and all the people you know it was just it was just it was Unreal before I went to prison I went up the drug rings when when I got out of prison I started off where I kind of where I was but it was all changed the topography and all the social politics and there was a lot in prison and but I still kind of knew had enough connections to get somewhere and I would go and sit in those circles and then I went but I slowly went down to nothing and no one wanted me around it was crazy apart from my closest of friends or acquaintances and it was just so crazy but God and His Mercy brought me to a place where I was willing to surrender my identity and I tell you what much to my own I could say shame because some of you will give your life to God sitting in an amazing service and that's amazing amazing because you have a love for God enough to give your life to him without him forcing you almost he will never Force you see it was all my choices but somehow through my choices and God's predestined amazing plan of Amazing Grace got me to a place where I must give my identity I had nothing left I had no idea oh man I didn't even have an identity left it was gone he stripped it away through my own stupid actions isn't it amazing the balance of our Free Will and God's predestined plan the balance such a fine line and you think wow my identity was stripped away and I got down I told my friends I said you know what I'm not coming out tonight and it got to a point where no one was even ringing me and all the stuff it was really and it was just something else and I went and I told them and they were like ah whatever you'll be out you know and I didn't go out I wasn't out I was addicted to social always out every night drinking taking drugs partying all those things every night without fail couldn't stop it and then I said no something changed open my bible and said touch not the unclean things and I will receive you and something spoke to me said even when you're in prison and you had all those experiences with me I hadn't received you yet wow because you didn't give your identity to me wow wow you were still holding that thing and that very thing was me holding my hand in the jar yeah and then the Fowler got me if you want the Fowler to stop getting you you need to let go of those weights that are besetting you that Spirit of unbelief that's holding you back listening to what other people are telling you about God and how it's not true and all these different things it is true it's just a spirit of unbelief but I tell you what you may think that that Spirit of unbelief that you can't get out of is impenetrable but let me tell you I'm a champion let me tell you of someone that conquered that atmosphere let me tell you somebody that made a way Hallelujah through the atmosphere of unbelief through the atmosphere of sin and created a ladder that you can climb and you will see the Angels descending and ascending upon and that is the Jacob's Ladder that is the latter the ministry of Jesus Christ in your life he is the champion that made a way for you and you may think oh my how can I ever get out of it let me tell you that there is a way there is Deliverance if you just lay that thing aside and say I lose this unbelief in the name of Jesus Christ I want an exciting life I want a life full of Adventure I want a life and safety I want a life of enjoyment I want a life of Joy I want a life of fun I want a real life you can't really live until you were born again you can't you can't even think properly or you're born again you don't even have vision your whole vision is looking through the lens of sore until you're born again but let me tell you that even if you are born again don't think you're exempt from this service because you need to still move on more tell you even the born again even myself I'm preaching to me well he is he just tells him what to say and I say it isn't that how it works you just be obedient to the Lord so let me just I'm never going to get past this so let me just my identity was completely surrendered the night that I laid down I went down on the end of my bed and I you know it doesn't have to be a big show yeah it can be it can be a camp thing it can be prophecies over you and all sorts of amazing things that I'm that's amazing praise God in some of us we we're all born in different ways some is in a nice pink hospital and some is messy down in a pig pen some is in church some is wherever it may be right some's in a shed wherever it is but as long as you get saved amen so I get down on my bed and now I pray and this prayer was a different prayer this prayer I knelt down on the end of my bed and I said Lord take the world out of my life I don't want it anymore deliver me from alcohol drugs social addictions all these addictions that I had methamphetamine addictions and ecstasy addictions all of it and guess I don't say guess what but the Lord delivered me of all of those things so yes I lost my reputation with all those friends yes they thought that I was crazy I lost friends I lost reputation but I also lost anxiety I lost fear I lost I lost death I lost all those things Hallelujah and so a few years later no maybe a year later I met Broman and bronman now was coming in from um the Realms of the charismatic Pentecostal and then further back Dutch reform reform Presbyterian and open Brethren so she had gone through a different you know you could say she kind of evolved through denominational Evolution you could say as it unfolded even over time she kind of went through that and then she met me and then I began to talk to her about things that are in the word that aren't even observed in churches anymore because they're considered old-fashioned and so I started talking to her about clothing now see Brahman had an identity and a real believer you know she had an experience with God um and God dealing in her life and all amazing testimony like Jonathan now it came to the crunch time was Bronwyn willing to sacrifice her identity to receive a true identity it's like Esther when Esther walked into the harem she had walked in with an identity but here guy came and delivered her a new identity was Esther willing to take here guys revelation of the king's Identity or would Esther stay and use her own imagination and affection to create her own identity and what she thinks the king would like and all those women in the Harem did the same thing right apart from Esther now Bronwyn was right there in the same situation and now I begin to talk to her about clothing and hair and makeup you know the usual kind of things but yeah God just did amazing because as you know because she was willing and she was sincere when we talked about here you know in Brahman she read in one Corinthians 11 that a woman's hair was her glory yes it's true right and so you know what she did she got hairdresser real good spent hundreds of dollars on beautiful haircuts and dieted and it was her glory right obviously when I met her she had the braids and then it had dreaded so that was also but you know to her it was her glory was that you make it beautiful right and so she'd had that and here I come to her and say actually your glory is here that never gets touched with a razor and if you actually look they've taken out of most of the concordances now because of the politics behind it but there's one left that actually tells you the true meaning of that word have long hair and it means to let it grow so that out of your head comes your hair fingerprint right your identity that God gave you so here is hair guy now clothing Esther and so and Now esther is Brahman is now willing for God to show her so she's like you know she just come back from missionary work in Mozambique seeing all the knees right and she's like now there's this guy now who she liked yeah so we had a bit of thing going there and I was telling you now so here's this guy now saying that God was actually concerned about your hair she's like what on Earth hey like literally like this is just like are you crazy and almost but respectfully but you know like really after all of us need and we're gonna go preach the gospel to every nation and you're talking about my hair okay but I said what if we pray are you willing to let it go or are you going to hold those melon seeds and she was willing to let it go and God knows your heart if you are really willing really really really willing God will take you at your word and he will then prove his word in your life he will change you he will do whatever is necessary and so you know what we prayed and God showed Brahman a vision and in the vision straight away in the vision there was a beautiful banquet room all beautiful laid out table banquet table and Chateau type of stuff beautiful and and it and everyone the attention was meant to be on the bride and the bridegroom I think but anyway instead a cockroach completely contrasting to the beautiful white scenery and she started crying she said oh Lord even the tiniest little thing can take the attention off the main Act and and the Lord showed her that yes God was actually concerned about small things and details so we talked about that the dress so clothing you know as you know you I you know if you treat it go into Pentecostal circles and any almost any denomination now um the woman uh Dressed sexy right so there's that they're connected to the the god of fashion and they flow with Hollywood they flow with the God of this evil age and the fashion spirit is so strong that the woman of the church flow with it in many cases there's obviously cases where they make individual decisions but as a general view they follow that and therefore they dress whatever they want right so Brahman was the same I met her she was wearing shorts up to hair and singlets and all that and I had to look past these things right because sometimes sons of God well sons and daughters have got a lit by the spirit of God and so now bronman starts telling me his story now now we weren't what in this time we we were not even courting or anything I don't think at this stage at all we're just friends but something was going on because now she starts telling me the story of when she was in Africa and they were preaching in Portuguese and she said Lord I wish you would just can you I'd love to know what they're talking about you know she's been sitting there and always preaching in Portuguese so you never really get a good sermon right because they're just preaching in another language and then all and during the service she got showing a vision and in the vision the Lord began to um put the armor on her and explain all the different parts of the Spiritual armor of of God right so she was getting clothed in this armor and she's telling me the story and as she's telling me a revelation strikes me ask her what she was wearing this is God's wisdom right ask her what she was wearing in division and ask her how her hair looked that was a seed sign up there I never mentioned anything about uncut hair at that stage I just kept that quiet but I did ask her and I sowed the seed so she's telling me the story and then she and then I say what were you wearing you know what what I said whatever you were wearing is how God wants you to look this is the image because he's showing you an image of yourself an eternity it's unconnected to Fashions of the world what did he show you and she said I was in a beautiful white dress down to the ground and my hair was down past my down my legs and I said you know what that's the very image that God sees you as all that you see around is actually corruption it's it's a people that have followed the Fashions of the world but like Esther she was willing to let go of her identity so that when she stood before the king what did the king see any children want to tell me what did the king see when he saw Esther yes Becca he saw himself because here guy knew the king so well that he knew what the king liked he knew the smell the king like the perfume he knew the way to say hello he knew the king he was a messenger from the King a prophet you could say that came to Esther and said hey I'm giving you a message an end-time message so that you can be clothed and this if you're willing to let go and lay aside all the weights that easily beset you like Bronwyn was you know it was amazing all these things God just because she was willing she wanted to know if it was God or not and he showed her and I tell you I promise you if you're really serious with God and you want to know he'll show you and we know Sister Christine's amazing testimonies about these things too people want to know why are you doing this it's not just a rule or some old-fashioned religion it's actually a very spiritual revelation of the word and the Heart of the king and it sets you apart from all other you become the gray speckled bird is it is that the grace Speckled Bird you're just so different from everyone else yeah I need to freshen up on that Hallelujah common musicians otherwise we will just this will help me close ten past nine we're going to sing the song I Give Myself Away just play it nice and sweet what happened to those who went with David they broke free from complexes of Saul can you imagine that type of leadership what a horrendous leadership just rash decisions crazy stuff you know like they're in a war and you're not allowed to eat anything it's like come on you know like this is the sort of stuff you'd make these rash decisions under emotional fear of man and complexes and inferiorities and all these things to escape that and that's your old nature now your old nature is capable of very bad things the the harder man is deceitful Above All Things it says but to break free from it to being a buyer for today to be a Jonathan but be in a buyer for Jonathan let's put those two together right can you think of that right now a buyer that lost all his family Jonathan lost all his family but Jonathan should have been like a biotherin actually run but he didn't buddy you willing to lay down everything else to come to the camp of David and it's because these are the benefits you'll break free from the complexes of Saul you'll enter true worship you know David knew how to worship and when you come into His Camp you're going to get an anointing oh Hallelujah he danced around the ark who wants to dance around the ark you know get some excitement in your life Hallelujah you think oh Andy is excited I am why not why not you yeah are you going to be excited too or are you just going to let Andy do all of the crazy stuff oh my but we can all be excited sometimes you just got to get next to yourself and say where am I at when you know where you're at you can then either get go further in and come to where Jesus is at and then you can bring people there you can got some definition in your life instead of just swimming around floating like a jellyfish in the sea floating Christians wandering but what about having definition having Vision having faith seeing God move in your life coming face to face with the Enemy and seeing him fall so that behind you all you see is defeated devils not complexness and complex then he said she said this said she did this to me and I'm this forever now because of that all you see is defeated Devils your whole mindset changes Saul he just had all these memories about everything that went bad and he just caused them to do stupid things and that's our old nature but what about just you know laying aside those weights laying aside those Soul attributes and moving on with God so that you can become you can beat down every enemy in David's Camp you could become a mighty Gentile warrior in David's Camp you become protected and David's kin you have Epic Adventures Epic Adventures epic Debbie amen Epic this is not boring I tell you what my life has been so amazing since I became a Christian more than anything this world ever gave Hallelujah who's willing to step out of the boat who's willing to walk on the water the water stormy I warn you but he's on the water too that's the main thing and guess what else they got their inheritance when you came into the camper David you certain you got certain victory in your in your hands certain do you notice since they came to David and then the whole country came to him eventually and they got everything that Joshua promised after all those hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years of just complete corruption all of a sudden they got it they finally caught the vision and it's the same thing for us are you willing to lay aside everything jump in Hook Line Sinker and fisherman amen Hook Line Sinker and believer because this is the where we're going you could say you walking in the river and we're you might have been traipsing up to your ankles in the river of God for many years and then some you went to a camp and you got down to your niece and then you went to another convention and you got up to here but you're still walking on the ground you're still making decisions then what if God said to you tonight and I believe he can speak to you tonight and say I want you to jump deeper I want you to go where your feet aren't even touching the ground and let me carry you you're buoyant you don't have to you don't have to make all these things you don't have to do it in your own strength anymore you can let my River carry you Hallelujah you know Ezekiel says that he walked in the river and then he got to a point in the river where there was no bottom that's the part we want to get in the river of God so deep that you are no longer that he's carrying you amen then you'll get your land then you'll have Epic Adventures then you'll be more protected you'll be a mighty Gentile Warrior beat down every enemy into true worship break free from the complexes of your old nature amen run for your life last thing sorry birds in India you know the Lord who knows the story of the birds in India this is a
