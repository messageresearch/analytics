========================================

[Applause] h oh [Music] praise the Lord good morning how are you this morning I have a um I have a little Psalm here it's um Psalm 134 and it says behold bless ye the Lord all ye Servants of the Lord which Stand By Night in the house of the Lord lift up your hands in the sanctuary and bless the Lord the Lord that made Heaven and Earth bless thee out of Zion so he's basically saying bless the Lord and then when you come to the sanctuary raise your hands and praise the Lord and then the Lord will bless you out of Zion and I think um who enjoys raising their hands you like raising your hands you know there's there's there's when you when you raise your hand is there's there are a few different ways that you would do it in a worship sense like for me there's there's two different ways one one way I when I'm feeling like I need to overcome something I'm feeling quite like [Music] uh like in a combative sort of way like Moses you know when Moses had his hands up they won the battle you know that's like a he's there for victory you know I'm I'm raising my hands cuz it's a a raising your hands is in one way it's a sign of Victory it's like you know when someone wins something they go yeah we won you know it's victory and and I don't know if you notice my fingers when I do that that's like I raise Hall you know I'm like it's a it's a hand raised like Moses did and then but other times you know when you worship your your hands raised could be a surrender you know when you you say I surrender it could be two things and you know when you when you worship when you sing I surrender all you just say Lord I surrender all it's actually a surrender [Music] but either way we the Lord you know he knows which one we're doing and and what our heart is and sometimes it's to the Lord sometimes it's to the enemy but you know we're we're a people that can raise our hands in every situation anden let's some and stand this morning and just Worship the Lord and we just pray Lord we thank you that we can come this morning Lord and and have this opportunity to Worship You Lord and that you've given us breath you've given us a vocal cords Lord you've given us a that can comprehend thoughts and then we can sing these things out and we can raise our hands and worship Lord we we can actually Express Lord from our heart this morning just what you what you mean to us and what you've done for us Lord Jesus so we just want to ask that you'll be here this morning Lord may you may you just come in a powerful way Lord and just bless our service Lord may you bless the songs bless the ministry Lord may just moveing here in a powerful way by your spirit Lord Jesus and and bless each Heart Lord we've just come to worship you and praise you and thank you this morning for what you've done for us Lord you've just been so good so we just want to invite you into our midst Lord and you said we two or three gathered together in your name that they are in the midst Lord so we we just invite you here this morning Lord and we look forward to being able to praise Lord to push back the enemy and to worship Lord to surrender all to you this morning Lord so we just want to commit this

wonderful job amen praise the Lord praise God Amen praise the Lord uh let's let's go on the scripture to uh Joshua 14 I'm just going to continue I'm just going to continue a bit on from uh Wednesday amen so the strength of the Lord God is our strength right so and and I want to talk about that that his strength is his quickening power in our lives the Holy Ghost living through US amen that's that's that's his strength in us right so let's just go to uh Joshua 14 um again and we're just going to read this it's there amen so uh just Joshua 14 from 6 down to verse 12 it says then the then the children of Judah came unto Joshua and gilgal and Caleb the son of jeffan the K kenite said unto him thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kad Baria 40 years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh Baria to spy out the land and I brought him word again uh as it was in Mine Heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but I wholly followed the Lord my God and how did he do that he took God at his word that the promise was theirs amen and Moses swear on that day saying surely the land on thy feet have trotten shall be thine inheritance and thy children's forever because thou Hast holy followed the Lord uh my God and now behold the Lord hath kept me alive as he said these 45 years even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo I am this day four score and 5 years old as yet I am as strong as yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so my strength is now for war both to go out and to come in now there therefore give me this mountain where of the Lord spake in that day that thou heardest in that day how the Anakin were there and that the cities were great and fence if so be the Lord be with me then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said and we just got one more uh one more piece of scripture from Deuteronomy 33 um to read here and because we got to realize the strength we have is greater than the day we're living in amen God never just equals the enemy he outmatches him amen he outclasses him he absolutely defeats him right so just want to realize this that uh if we read here Deuteronomy 33:24 and of Asher I just wanted to put this verse in because we're having an Asher here amen but this is all for all of us right and as uh and of Asher he said let Asha be blessed with children let him be acceptable to his Brethren let him dip his foot in oil thy shoes shall be iron and brass and as thy days so shall shall thy strength be there is none like unto the god of jesam who rideth upon the heaven in thy help and in thy in his Excellency on the sky the Eternal God is our refuge and underneath are the Everlasting Arms and he shall thrust the enemy out from before thee and shall say destroy them Israel then shall dwell in safe safety alone the Fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine also his Heavens shall droop down due happy Art Thou o Israel who is like unto thee Oh people saved by the Lord he's talking about you amen The Shield of thy help and who is the sword of thy Excellency and thine enemy shall be found Liars unto thee and thou shalt tread upon their high places praise the Lord amen let's bow his in word of prayer this morning shall we commit our lives in the service to the Lord gracious father thank you Lord we have the great privilege to read your word Lord God and thank you Lord that we have faith in our hearts when we read it Lord not doubt not skepticism but Faith Lord that you've placed there dear God that your promises to us are yeah and amen father we're so thankful for that and as we stand this morning Lord I pray you cleanse all of our hearts Lord we want to approach your uh great presence with sincerity and reverence and Thanksgiving Lord because you're the king of kings and Lord of lords you're the only God and so father we pray that you'd be lifted up and praised Lord as we worship you we thank you for the songs thank you for the Lord your presence already here and I pray You' take these words Lord and anoint them to our hearts Lord may you an speaker and hearer may your blood cover us father protect us Lord and may be with those who couldn't be here today as well be their portion father have your way we love you and we thank you Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning so I'd like to speak about as as uh our days as thy days so shall thy strength be now we got to realize as I said before that the day we live in God's strength outclasses or outmatches what the enemy is doing in that day so we're never defenseless we're never hopeless we're never helpless the enemy wants us to think we are but the strength of the Lord is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our lives right so it's the God's quickening power that that causes us to overcome now I'm going to use that phrase quickening power a lot today because if you look at you know if you do a study of it in the message you see brother BR speaks about the quickening power of God more at the end of his ministry that he does in the beginning now that quickening power is the Holy Ghost living right because our strength is not a human strength amen it's not a I'm just going to re just just go a little bit of Wednesday and just continue on from there just as a refresher our strength is not our human strength right we don't walk this walk by our own ability by how we can work things out by anything human right it's a supernatural walk and it's God's strength that causes us to stand causes us to walk amen it's not our ability one bit and I'm thankful for that aren't you I mean cuz then the pressure would be on you but the pressure is on God God we can lean upon him we're not leaning Upon Our Own selves we're leaning upon him cuz our Help Cometh From The Lord amen I just want to tell you friends that this the strength of God is present I think it's more present in your life than you realize I mean when you look back at what you've been through even last year and the and and and the typ places the trials the hardship the troubles and you got to realize what brought me through that it wasn't you it wasn't your stubbornness it was the power of God working in your life amen Hallelujah so now this day we live in we know it's a uh you know I just want to talk very briefly about our day then we're going to move on to our strength right so this day is uh that we live in is described as a time of trouble in the Bible it's it's described in Zechariah 14 as a gloomy day of not day or night but it says there in the evening time it shall be light so it's a gloomy day it's a foggy day it's like a Twilight kind of a time when it's not light it's not dark it's you know but but in the evening time it shall be light the Apostle Paul would be inspired to write to Timothy in 2 Timothy 3 that perilous times would come in the last days so we're living in a day that's perilous amen we're living in a day when gross Darkness covers the people but a rise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you through the message of the hour right so it's a dark day it's a perilous day it's a gloomy day but it's actually the brightest day there's ever been amen because for the believer this is the greatest day that's ever struck the Earth is this day because this day the dead in Christ could rise at any moment amen and then our bodies will be changed by the quickening power that's already within you amen and we'll be raised together to meet the Lord in the a you know when we sing that song This Morning When the Saints Go Marching In that's more than a song to The Believer that's more than a nice tune to the believer it's a reality am me when you're actually speaking what you're going to live out soon and very soon amen like David was inspired one time to write you lift you up your Everlasting Gates you lift you up you ever lasting doors that the king of glory shall come in and we know that he was he was speaking of when the Lord would rais amen after he had he had conquered hell death in the grave and when he arose many of the Saints rose with him and they went up into that great big city amen he emptied out paradise he took the saints that were waiting Abraham and Sarah and and you know Noah and Moses and all the ones waiting for that great moment he emptied out paradise and he went up he led captivity captive right and so David was one of those Saints so he sung under inspiration what he was going to live out and to me that would have been a tremendous thing to realize what I've been singing maybe for years what I've been believing maybe for years has finally I'm living out the the the expectation of my faith hallelujah hallelujah we're going to do that one day amen I believe we're actually doing it right now because when the spirit of God comes down what's he doing he's touching Our Lives saying friend you're coming to be with me very soon amen soon and very soon we're going to see the king amen so we live in a we live in a perilous time but it's a it's it's a very very good time praise the Lord as as David would say here thou has uh thou has thrust sore at me that I might fall but the Lord help me the Lord is my strength and song and become my salvation the voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the Tabernacles of the righteous the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly amen the right hand of the Lord is exalted the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly amen so the Lord Lord is our strength this may be very simple today but it the Lord is your strength see what you what you draw strength from is what you realize your strength is so so if you're leaning upon your own ability that's your strength but if you're leaning in the Leaning on the word of God he's your strength now all human ability comes to its end right but God's ability never comes to its end he's the infinite Eternal God he can't run out of strength or ability amen even even when um even when you know during a time of restoration when Nehemiah had had returned the Jews had returned to Jerusalem and they were rebuilding the temple they rebuilt the walls and finally there came when the when the law was read to them and the people began to weep and cry but but Nehemiah said you know uh he said he said don't be you know don't be sad neither be sorry for the joy of the Lord is your strength I mean so during a time of restoration the joy of the Lord is your strength what is that Joy God loves it when people return to him he loves it when the prodical comes home he loves it when one sinner comes you know you know Jesus said all the angels in heaven Rejoice whatever they're doing they stop doing that cuz they Rejoice could cuz one of God's children come home amen so so there's that Joy God loves to see it when people take him at his word am mean and that should give us strength that because we got to realize we're not serving a God that's indifferent we're not serving a God that doesn't care we're not serving a God that's distant that's somewhere like just spoke the world into existence and he sat back on his armchair and watched it unfold no God is actively working in the lives of men and women boys and girls all over the world in this world today amen so he's not indifferent he he's not a God that doesn't care he cares very much about what you're going through Hallelujah that should give us a joy amen Lord I'm I'm in a deep valley but Lord you care that I'm here you're my shepherd you've led me through here to take me out the other side amen praise the Lord hallelujah brother R makes a statement he says he says there is it is revelation of God that will give you authority over the devil right and you can see why they would add or take away from it would be cursed speaking about the Book of Revelation it would be uh would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy it's that simple there's nothing as such prevailing power as the revelation of the word amen so Revelation gives you prevailing power over the enemy Revelation is your strength am mean because we're living by the strength of the Lord like you look at and then now what does what what brings Revelation it's the quickening power of the Holy Ghost right what you know what brings what brings the promises of God to pass in your life it's the quickening power of the Holy Ghost it's the Dynamics of the Holy Spirit coming into the word and making it live amen that's why like you look at even even Caleb how did he how was he that strong that he could fulfill the word of God that was given to him in Kadesh B saying you're going to you're going to possess that inheritance it was God's quickening power cuz even when the 12 Spies returned and Joshua and Caleb said no we're more than able to take the land Moses said that the Caleb and Joshua had a different spirit with them than the 10 spies who didn't believe what did they what did Joshua and Caleb have the quickening power of the Holy Ghost to cause them to look not to not to disregard the enemy in the land not to say they weren't there they acknowledged they were there but the quickening power of God said that is an obstacle that's not going to stand you are going to drive them out because I have declared you're going to drive them out it was the quickening power of God so it was the spirit of God that gave him the supernatural strength to be as strong as he was at 85 years old as he was at 40 right amen and friends if God could so if God's quickening power under the blood of bulls and goats can give Caleb that kind of strength how much more the indwelling of that quickening power and you and I to fulfill the word of God in your life right now amen so Caleb prevailed by that Revelation that mountain is mine and he said because remember when Moses was speaking there it wasn't Moses saying this is going to be your inheritance that was God speaking through Moses it was God's quickening power giving that promise to to him amen that same thing how does how does revelation go from a teaching to a revelation how does it do that it's by the quickening power of God Amen we are a very blessed people with the quickening power of the Holy Ghost amen because it's not man's you know like like Peter would say we're not following we're not following kindly devised fables of man no it is the word of God that's been quickened to hearts and lives amen praise the Lord now then how does yeah how did the Seven Seals come open by quickening power that's right by the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost it was God ceasing to open the book to the elect people I mean to to the Bride of Jesus Christ then how does that go from on tape into you by quickening power Hallelujah Aben we're an anointed people you know a lot of people are scared about anointed ones at the end time I say the bride is the anointed one at the end time we're not talking about false anointed one talking about true anointed ones you know the you know the holy ghost moving that reain is for you it's for the bride it's for the seed it's not for the tears it's for everyone gets the benefit but it's for you amen that's why we should never never shut up the windows of Heaven because of we're afraid of some false anointed one I mean we should never pull a knei raction will they do that out in the world listen we can't answer for what they do we're just responsible for taking God's word and letting it live amen so in spite of what the rest of the world does with the word Let's Take God at his word let him do what he wants to do let his Dynamic quickening power come down into our hearts like never before I mean cuz why take the false when the brother BR says the skies are full of the genuine pcal blessing of the holy ghost moving amen you know we are a Pentecostal people you know that this message has restored us back to a true Bookers of book of Acts Pentecost where God comes and dwells in his church and lives out his Plan of Redemption you know where we are being restored back to that amen we are restored back to the moving of the Holy Ghost and I'm so thankful I'm looking at a people that will not settle for anything less than God living amen that that I'm looking at people who will will not settle for anything less than God taking on over proving his word driving out the devil bringing healing bringing Redemption I'm preaching to the choir this morning I'm so thankful I do amen because because I believe Hallelujah I believe if if if something came in and we became cold and formal I don't think any of you would stand for it I think there'd be a Revolt praise God I believe that we would all of you would say this is wrong something's wrong here I'm not putting up with this cuz I remember not that long AG God moved in power and I loved it and I want it again hallelujah amen why because we love the moving of the Holy Ghost amen don't ever let someone put some tag on you saying oh that's just a Pentecostal thing no this message has restored us back to a true Pentecost it's brought us back to that true Pentecostal Feast amen this is what because the message was come to restore not to take us partway back not to take us back to something else but to restore us back to a true book of Acts God living in the people praise God I'm so thankful it does I'm so thankful we're not standing here with a B living by a bunch of theology trying with terminologies and phrases and nothing lives and no promises come to pass and we just stand here and say well God did it in brother braham's day but that was his day we're in a different day we're in the same day I me we're living in the same day amen I remember so so Gabriel was was was 10 on Friday I know I've shared this before but I want to share it again cuz give the devil a black ey amen but but but but around Christmas time you know so it's about a month before she was born round about you know Christine had a dream where she was born still born she was born dead and she woke up and there was a great fear in the room and so we started to pray against that and then on the on the uh the the night we're driving to the hospital course we prayed you as we drive before any other children are born but you know we prayed specifically against that dream and then so so I prayed and then she said can I pray and So Christine prayed against it and she said I didn't know at the time but she totally forgot about that dream cuz when brother nin would know this more than anyone but you know a mother's got to be relaxed to really have a good birth you can't be tense and troubled so when she prayed that second time that that that dream totally left her mind it was still in my mind and then so then then she comes to you know be born she twists in the birth canal Gabriel does and her and her shoulder gets stuck and it was well wasn't a you just a few minutes but you they pushed the alarm Bell and every doctor and nurse of the hospital was literally in the room and you know but but um you know but then somehow I think the Midwife put her hand in and untwisted her shoulder or whatever and she came out but she was blue unresponsive blue I'm praying you know and then and they take Gabriella then they put her on the table to examine her and she takes her first breath and I literally see her body go from Blue to Pink see this pink spread through her body Hallelujah she's a miracle child amen but what caused what caused that dream to be forgotten the quickening power of God I mean what caused what caused her to be born healthy and well the quickening power of God I mean we know we commit all things into God's hands and however things happen we know ultimately he's in control but why should we just sit back and be passive about things when we have the Holy Ghost living in our lives why not push the battle take God at his word and don't pull back for nothing Hallelujah why cuz we are full of the quickening power of God today you may not feel it it's not a feeling you may have a lot of trouble in your heart it's deeper than that amen it's in the soul amen you may be troubled in your mind and in your spirit but the Holy Ghost dwells in the soul hallelujah amen hallelujah I remember when um when so when I met the Lord and you know you my parents were living in Papa New Guinea and I was praying Lord how can I share this message because the message was not where my parents lived up up in that country and and I thought Lord how can I how can I share this message with people who don't even speak English and I I don't speak Pon and all those things you know and I was trying to work out in my mind how to do it but you see it's not that that was my strength trying to come forward how am I going to work this out and then I was in my flat and God C spirit of God came down and I you went into my room and he and it was so strong it literally put me on my knees and God spoke this scripture to my heart not by power not by might but by my spirit sayi the Lord of hosts he said you just go and I'll do the rest I mean what brought that the quickening power of God and I don't just take this I put the scripture up here because this is my scripture this is your scripture this is my scripture amen but but but but I put that up there not just because of a you know Mission work overseas but I take this for everyday life I take this for this church it's not by power it's not by might it's not by ability it's not by what we can sure we do our best but it's not that we're trusting in amen but we're trusting in the power of God Amen by his spirit amen hallelujah why because we have the Holy Ghost amen amen and what God has given the devil can't take away hallelujah amen nothing nothing can stand before our God hallelujah that's why you got to realize the Lord is our strength amen praise the Lord amen job would say to say to the Lord he said then job answered the Lord and said I know that thou canest do everything and that no that no thought can be withholden from from thee so so so job realized nothing's going to stop you God nothing's going to stop you amen and then in Isaiah it says for the Lord of hosts ha hath purposed and who shall disel it and his hand is stretched out and who shall turn it back I mean this is the God we serve this morning this is our strength amen what can stop him amen nothing can stop him amen the devil can't stop him this world can't stop him I mean even your Humanity can't stop him Hallelujah he will do what he wants to do amen we're going to realize this is our strength talking here amen this is not you know this is not like a natural Warfare well I've got these missiles they've got these missiles no we have unlimited strength amen we do not fight based on what the devil may do no we fight according to the word of God Amen we don't fear what the devil does we're going to take God at his word we're going to fight amen we're going to stand we're going to Rejoice we're going to love him remember I'm preaching to the choir Hallelujah no you are gen see you're such a great group of people to preach to amen I think you're more on board than even me so I appreciate it you know because because you're Believers God has made you a Believer amen he hasn't made you he hasn't made you a make believer and unbeliever you're Believers this morning Hallelujah so what can disal it can Satan do nothing no he can't he'll try but he cannot amen this is our strength now I just want to read this I love it God's purpose can never be defeated am mean there's nothing can defeat it so how so so how happy ought we uh ought to be today rest in upon that beautiful revelation of the word of the Living God that there is neither things present nor things that can come there's no sickness no sorrow no death no perils nor nothing can separate us from the purpose of the Living God what God has imagined in his mind what God has purposed in his heart to bring to pass there is no demon there's no power there's nothing that can ever separate uh God's Great Immortal Eternal plan it must be as God has said and he's doing it today I made that a bit bigger and is doing it today amen he has made a preparation to conserve to his own purpose he will conserve a church he will conserve a people he will conserve subjects for his great domain that death cannot destroy and we realize that it is by faith that we believe this by the resurrection uh but the resurrection produces a solid foundation on which our faith rests why do we believe that quickening power that was Quicken to you that's why you believe it this morning amen nothing can destroy it as the poet once wrote Oh What A foraste of Glory Divine air of Salvation purchased of God born of his Spirit washed in his blood what an assurance upon the solid rock the resurrection of our blessed lover the Lord Jesus nothing can destroy it it has been planted it is the seed of God it is a purpose of God to give us the Blessed holy spirit it's the Blessed purpose of God to show us signs and wonders and miracles it's the purpose of God and nothing can destroy it all powers of Hell might wager against it but it will but it will prevail we have God's Eternal promise am mean there there may be teachers that uh you maybe isms rise there may be great programs rise there may be things that look like that it would uh would be destroyed but could never be destroyed it's the purpose of God to see that it will prevail then it's not up to me it's not up to you whether it we be destroyed or not it's up to God and we can rest upon it that God will never let our heritage be destroyed for it's his purpose to give it to us hallelujah amen so if that is so so if God be for us who can be against us amen if God be your strength amen that's kept you alive all these years that's kept you in the faith who can be against you hallelujah amen you know we are so blessed today that God has brought a perfect balance in the scripture amen that that we know well I'm I'm just going to wait let's just put this up and then I'll come to what I'm about to say here he says but the path of the justice is The Shining Light that shineth more and more until the perfect day so the path that we're walking is not obscured it's not become darkened even though there's so many opinions and things out there our path has not been darkened by those things because God has has has revealed to us his path for us to walk in right we're not guessing how to walk with God we're not guessing who God is he's been revealed through the entire message right amen but you see also this path shines more and more perfect per because we are not trusting because it used to be the path was tried to be walked by it's your Works to get you to heaven or have you done enough you know it was it was it was there was a human pressure that came in to say can you walk this path and that to me obscures the path because it puts the pressure on the individual as opposed to the ability of God right but now we have we have come down into this day where God has revealed to us that we come from God and we go back to God God can't lose any of his children amen God God can't lose a single one of his children right the devil has all these schemes and plans to try and get us off the road and all these things but God can't lose any of his children amen and then we know that election God does not change our mind uh change his mind about us this is our strength right you got because you got to draw from your strength amen when you're going through hard times right you realize that God God doesn't change his mind about any one you're accepted in the Beloved you're accepted in the Beloved you're loved by him you're loved by him amen if you're one of his you can never become not one of his amen now to me if that's been revealed then it should give us such a strength I want to walk with you Lord that's I'm yours I want to be fully identified with you I'm made in your image so I want to be your image I want to be just like you amen so all that you are your word says I want to become that's right amen praise the Lord let's just I just want to go down to this here see Peter would say here that Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ The Strangers scared throughout pontis and galatia capadia Asia and um Beth or whatever elect according to the for knowledge of of God the father now forn knowledge has been very misunderstood in this day forn knowledge people seem to think and and and sure there's probably some quotes you about this to say well God saw you through time choosing him it's much deeper than that for knowledge is you're you're you're known beforehand okay so it's more than just because remember if the pressure is well if God saw me choosing him then I'm his but then what happens if I unchoose him it's much see God God don't run his business haphazardly God do not just stab in the dark kind of see how it goes kind of a god he's very sure right so when he talks about for knowledge before the foundation of the world he saw you he knew your parents he knew your grandparents he knew how you come to this earth amen he saw you at your best Made In His Image robed him white dancing around the throne like he asked job where were you when the morning Stars shouted for joy in the sons of God where were you job he's trying to get job to see job I Saw You by for knowledge I saw you not as you are right now on this trial of this ash Heep lost everything right I didn't see you like this job I saw you redeemed washed my blood to my image dancing around the throne in a Eternal glorified body hallelujah amen so that's what for knowledge is God saw you and what he sees will come to pass amen he believed he sees it he believes it he speaks it and here it is it's material amen so God remember God does not save anyone to lose anyone when you really have a true salvation you can't lose it you can't lose it it's secure amen as as Paul would write grieve not the Holy Ghost we by your seal to the day of your Redemption Hallelujah see to me if we speak about these kind of things it should make the path even brighter I'm his he thought of me Hallelujah maybe not in the state not in the state ofen now the troubles and the things going on and complexes or whatever more he didn't see me like this he saw me in a perfect body sinless what Made In His Image dancing around his strong that's why I love you know When the Saints Go Marching In I believe God gave that song and CU God wanted it to Quicken it to the m to to the artist or musician who wrote it that when it's sung it will be quickening power will come and put it into a heart of a person where they can realize Lord like I was sing you you we were singing that when we crown him Lord of you know when we crown him Lord of all I was thinking Lord I don't know how though the hands that are going to touch that crown that are againsts your blessed head but I don't care I want to see it happen hallelujah what does that to me it's quickening power I'm part of the scene hallelujah amen praise God and I trust that gives you strength today those kind of things right amen praise the Lord now I'm just trying to find I've kind of jumped and as I do and amen Paul would say here he says but ye not in the flesh but in the spirit if so the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have none of the spirit have not the spirit of Christ he's none of his but if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit of life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you this is his quickening power that dwells he but if he dwells in you he'll also Quicken your mortal bodies that it doesn't matter if if you go by the way of the Grave or if you're alive and you're changed there's that quickening power dwells within you already hallelujah amen and that's why we know Jesus Jesus died on Calvary that his quickening life his life would come into a people amen praise the Lord now this quickening power God don't want to stay all by himself he wants his Spirit to spread am mean God's all about finding his plan is I want to find my bride that's this is his heart right now I want to find her and when I found her I want to strengthen her I want to encourage her I want to show her who she is I want her to know I know her that's why the message came your way for you to realize God knows you how it's one thing God I know you but when God says God I know you hallelujah amen praise the Lord that's what that's what our God does Amen but but how does that come by quickening power praise the Lord amen this quickening power also breaks the Yoke it destroys the Yoke of the enemy amen the Yoke of the enemy shall be destroyed because the anointing or the quickening power will destroy it and that's why I believe I said earlier we love the moving of the spirit we love the anointing because we know when God comes down something's going to happen am mean no one can stay the same when God comes down to a meeting I mean that's why we love Camp cuz because what makes Camp him amen he makes Camp right why do we love church him amen because we realize whatever troubles are uh uh the monkeys on our back am mean they ain't going to stay there by the time the service is done why cuz the anointing the washing by the water of the word is going to come and break the Yoke destroy the Yoke of the enemy that that monkey may be a big AP in size but it'll be dead at your feet by the time you walk out these doors hallelujah amen why because there's a quickening going on I mean there's an Awakening going on for you to realize hey this thing belongs under my feet I mean this is a rug on my you rug on my floor it doesn't belong on my head it belongs under my feet no matter what it is amen hallelujah and it's so important that we let the quickening power move hallelujah amen like you know we we are told by we're told by um sorry our last our last few family prayers have been a theme around sincerity and and and when when Jesus asks his disciples who do you say that I am Simon Peter we know he says you know Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus would say bless art thou Simon by Jonah for flesh and blood is not revealed this unto thee but my Father which is in heaven quickening Powers reveal this to you Peter and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock what is that the rock of revelation of who Jesus Christ is I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I will give unto you the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven amen so there's now a power to bind and loose that comes into the church this is not just for Peter this is for every believer there's a power the the quickening power of God because you got to realize that everything must obey God it doesn't want to but everything will obey like one day every knee will bow and confess that Jesus Christ is Lord Satan himself will have to bow amen the our great enemy in all of its hordes of Hell will all bow that day and confess that Jesus Christ is Lord he is the Supreme one he's basically saying what I tried to do cuz Satan wanted to become the Supreme one by but by him confessing that he is Lord he's saying I couldn't do it why because nothing can stop God's prevailing power his strength am mean but you got to realize that the Demon's bowing is not just for that day it's for this day I mean that's why quickening power comes into the church is that every enemy must bow to the name of Jesus Christ it doesn't matter what it is amen but it must bow and that's why we have over a thousand sermons of so many prayer lines I guarantee if you're going through something it's already been cast out that's right it was already defeated that day on Calvary but God sent you know he sent us the Prophet Elijah brother Braham in this day to remind us everything must bow to the name of Jesus Christ if you're sincere when you pray nothing can stop it amen if you let Faith take control nothing can stop that prayer am mean God will answer it in his time amen so now there's a power that's come in into our lives we have the power to bind and the power to loose I think you know to me when I read this I'm like I feel a lot more sincere we're not here playing games we're not here just just haphazardly well this is something I do know life and death is in the power of my tongue I me when you're when you're an anointed son or daughter of God there's more life you your your words have far more power than anyone out there right so now we have the power to bind the devil but also we have the power to loose the Holy Ghost into the congregation I mean we have the power to loose him to let him have right of way so if you see you know the reason why most of us or you probably you just go back and enough Wednesdays or Sundays you realize there's a common pattern kind of happens you have trouble in the morning fusses come in right it can be very tense in the car oh oh wow okay I need to you need to teach me how what's the secret here but you see why does why does that come because the devil is afraid that when you come to church and you get into the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost and God begins to move you you begin to open your heart to the Lord and you begin to express back to God what he means to you and what he's done amen that his power is broken and he's going to be defeated he may have been Waring against you all week but he's afraid there's a there's a countdown timer on his watch amen and and and it goes off at about 20 n or 10 o' depending if you're in Sunday school or not you know but he is afraid and that's why he causes trouble to come because he wants us so bound up in what's going on that we are not open and our hearts are open and we let God move that then the holy ghost is now released amen so you got to realize you have a hard morning church is going to be awesome you have a real tough Wednesday church is going to be awesome you've had a real tough week oh my wait till we get to church Hallelujah God is going to do something exceedingly abundantly Beyond I can ask or think amen so so we amen this is to me this is an incredible thing that we have the ability to bind or loose all of us do not just the whoever is preaching or the song leader all of us have this ability now back back you was 121 years ago there's a Welsh Revival this is how this now in this in this revival there was over 100,000 people saved in Wales over a few year span this is how the this is how the Revival started okay some point at the beginning of the Revival in at at new new key kagar have you said on Sunday morning in February uh 1904 it was during a prayer meeting led by a Pastor Joseph Jenkins Jenkins asked for personal testimonies some tried to speak on other issues but Jenkins redirected their focus to the Lord amen there was prolonged silence now this quickening power wants to be released right then suddenly a young girl named Flory Evans Rose to her feet and spoke softly with a trembling voice I love the Lord Jesus with all my heart amen a journalist named tww Ste who was present that day wrote this the paos and the passion of the young girl acted like an electric shock upon the congregation one after another Rose and made a full surrender and the News spread like wildfire from place to place that the rival had broken out and that Souls were be coming and gathered to the Lord what did she do she stood up under the moving of the Holy Ghost it was quickening power what you she released the Holy Ghost upon the congregation just by a little testimony it wasn't a great big thing a little timid little timid girls with a trembling voice saying I love the Lord Jesus with all my heart amen but see it's not necessarily the way it's given it's the heart that quickening power moving amen that doesn't want to be bound it wants to be released Hallelujah that's why it's so important you feel to say amen amen you want to dance start dancing amen if it's a moving of the Holy Ghost don't be afraid if God's doing it it's always in order amen but what could that do it could trigger a Revival just like this you say oh we don't have revivals no more who said that who said that brother brah says you can have a Revival you can have it in yourself if the whole church is dead as a post you can be shouting the glories of God Amen like you first met him amen the word become more alive to you doesn't matter what what's going on around you it's you and God hallelujah amen so if she could move by the see it was the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost that moved in her heart and she began to express amen exactly what that was going on and it caused Revival to happen hallelujah amen friends why should we be intimidated how polished or unpolished we are that's right see it's the devil that wants to make us afraid not to act upon what God wants us to do that's what will that person think what will that person think I said that person could see that and say I want some of that amen I remember I remember standing standing at a ministers meeting years ago up north and there was brother AR's dad was there he began to scream and shout right next to me I thought man Lord I want some of what he's got right cuz it was victory in his heart coming out amen and you may be still as a post but just just let it come out whoever God wants to do it right amen it's not how skilled or whatever sure we should be you know play skillfully in all these things but it's the dynamic of it see you can have the perfect voice the perfect instruments the perfect everything but if the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost ain't there it ain't going to do what it's meant to do it'll be entertaining at Best But if God comes into it you maybe can't well I just I can't sing like nothing right and we all know that that's fine but you see but if God inspires it see amen it can do far more than than the most skilled musicians ban in the whole world it can do far more way cuz the the Dynamics of God come into it amen and it can change the whole scene amen and that's why I think it's so important friends we sing sing with all our hearts amen praise God with all that you are amen just let him take over don't be so afraid of what oh well the well the devil in this trouble and this person and this pressure forget all about that amen we're not here Amen to to to to come down to a mechanical level where it's just going through some church order thing and all those things are fine but we're here that God would take over a service am mean that it would leave human control that our lives are no longer but it's God living Hallelujah now I say I'm preaching to the choir amen cuz this is what we thrive on isn't it amen the moving of the Lord like that hallelujah amen praise the Lord see this quickening power see brother R makes a statement Moses looked one day and seen a pillar of fire it attracted his attention this great Theologian he had run with all of his theological training his understanding by his mother of the world um of the word itself uh of how he was to deliver the children of Israel but when he tried in his way he failed and although his mother had thoroughly instructed him on what to do a and on what he would do and what God had raised him up for all this knowledge as good as it was and it is good but yet it had not been set off it was only mechanics that's why we need the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost we need the mechanics of the word they need to come together like Jesus said you must worship the father in spirit the Dynamics and Truth the mechanics but the mechanics by itself will not do anything right the the mechanics will be perfectly fine like brother bam gives the illustration uh and it is the rising of the sun of a car it can be perfectly theoretically it's a car it'll work it'll go this fast it'll do all this but if it doesn't have the spark plug to ignite that fuel in the engine it can only just be talked about it can't be proven right you take the same car put a spark plug in and what it says it can do it will do it amen and that's the same with the word of God what you just let the spark of God and I believe there's a lot of Sparks here there's a lot of fire of the Holy Ghost living in Souls amen and now that's why you just let the let the word ignite in faith amen just take God at his word don't worry about what the devil tries to pour on it saying it can't happen if God said it amen God can do it Hallelujah so it's not the mechanics see we need mechanics but see mechanics ain't what runs the automobile it's the Dynamics that runs it the mechanics don't run the church it's the Dynamics the holy ghost that gets into the word amen not a um Seminary that teaches you all the Theology and the Greek interpretations but it's the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost in there to set that a fire and bring it to pass and to make it live just exactly what promise uh promised the word of this hour not the mechanics the Dynamics it takes mechanics and Dynamics the word and the spirit they are one that gives life that's why we need both and I believe we have both amen so so if we have both what should we be afraid of about that's right amen what should we fear if we have both the mechanics and the Dynamics amen cuz remember we are actually the mechanics am mean the believer is the mechanics like Moses was the mechanics but he needed the burning bush the Dynamics to come in and bring to pass what God Said would do now I ask the question what could stop Moses after the burning bush nothing Egypt couldn't stop him Pharaoh couldn't stop him nothing could stop him the Red Sea nothing could stop him he was Unstoppable when the mechanics and the Dynamics came together I say if a man was Unstoppable under the blood of bulls and goats walking with the mechanics and Dynamics how much small now amen the Bride of Jesus Christ under the blood of Jesus Christ amen with the mechanics and Dynamics amen praise the Lord amen you see well it's the Dynamics that does it now shamba Shamar killed 600 men with an ox code I'll guarantee you it wasn't his ability that did it right it wasn't his human strength that caused this to happen it was the it was the quickening power of almighty God what he had to realize was he was a circumcised son of Abraham see he would come brother Braham would would uh speak about he'd say year after year those Philistines would come and take away his crop now either because 600 men came to deal with him so either he had a very big crop or the Philistines were very very afraid of him I'm going to take the very afraid of him root right because the devil knows what you're he thinks he knows What You're Made Of so he'll send a force a strength that he thinks will take you down so these Philistines because remember one soldier would have done the whole job here's here's shamgar he's got an ox go which is just really a prod thing for oxen it's not a weapon right it's nothing you know he had no Shield he had no armor so one one soldier could have done the job or two three easy why 600 because the Philistines were they had a bit of an idea what this man was capable of right and the devil knows what you're capable of but every time he comes against you amen his power is never enough that's right Hallelujah like a thousand against Samson with a Jawbone it wasn't enough amen all the power of Egypt was not enough against Moses amen all the unbelief of of the world during Noah's day was not enough to stop and building the ark and getting in amen all the all the um idol worship in Elijah's day was not enough Amen to stop the fire of God falling on Mount Mount carel amen all the all the all that stuff was not enough to stop Elijah going up in a chariot ride amen and it wasn't enough to stop the mandle coming on Elisha Hallelujah that quickening power that was on the prophet made him go up in a Rapture Came Upon Elisha and we know Elijah Elisha type the prophet in the church or Christ in the church right Elijah is the prophet or it's Christ Elisha is the church right and what was the last what was the so so the quickening power a double portion of the quickening power that was upon Elijah Came Upon Elisha and he did twice the number of Miracles as Elijah did we're got to realize friends if we took because you know we here brother Brown's Ministry we're in awe of everything God did that's in one man now you take that same anointing and you spread it around the earth what if you gathered all the bride and brought them into one spot and we had a testimony service you'd say man we're back in brother braham's day and we still are but you see now that same anointing has spread itself around the earth the Holy Ghost right so all the Miracles that were done just in his ministry a double has been done amen amen you just need to hear some more testimonies Our God ain't dead Hallelujah but what was the last miracle that Elisha did now uh he had a double portion he was meant to do eight he did do eight he died after he did seven so the critics come along and say oh he said he had a double portion he was a false prophet Elijah's wrong too but you see there was a time when there was war in Israel Elisha was dead in a Seiler just a bunch of Bones there was war and they carrying a some some men were carrying a dead man and they just threw him in the Seiler just just trying to you know trying to get rid because they're running from the enemy as soon as that dead man fell on Elisha's Bones the quickening power that was residing in him amen brought him to life Hallelujah so what is the last what is the last thing this Dynamic power's going to do it's going to raise the dead hallelujah amen the the quickening power that's within you is going to raise the dead the dead in Christ are going to rise amen why because the quickening power Hallelujah Elisha was not conscious of what was going on he was dead he was up in Glory by having a dancing spell around the Throne of God I don't know but you see he wasn't even conscious of that going on that's right same thing with the quickening power on you and I it ain't us that's going to work it up that's going to cause the dead in Christ to raise it's just the life within us being experiened that's why walk on and love the Lord enjoy his goodness he is your strength hallelujah amen so Shamar I'm just going to finish with this because because I I love this it's like one verse but hey it's a good verse Hallelujah so shamba here he is now uh Harvest after harvest he' hear these boots stomping down the road and he got used to he got used to the enemy coming and taking taking away what he what he had harvested and it's much like you know so so here's shamba he's the mechanics he's a circumcised son of Abraham he believes the message for his day he's adopted son of God living in the promised land right he's the me the mechanics are perfect but he's got to realize his dynamics that go with that right he's got to realize his dynamics that go with that Covenant that God has made right so they came so so you know you it's just like us sometimes you know we go to church we get a blessing full of harest comes in and we so appreciate the wheat the bread that God's given us and we're just chewing on it as we walk out the door and you know but then somehow the enemy comes in during the week and steals our Harvest and then we come back to church again and the same thing can happen it's like a cycle right but there's got to come a time when the believer realizes the Harvest God gives it's mine amen I'm not letting the devil come with a trouble or fuss or a complex or whatever it is that causes that blessing to leave amen it's just like Shamar he heard those boots stomping you know maybe he walked out at you know he he he had received this Great Harvest and and then here's the boots come he comes mondayitis comes his way 600 worth of it right and then but something within him he saw the plight of his family he saw the situation he was in and this time it was different CU instead of letting the boots make him feel more discouraged and more and more full of fear and worry the quickening power of God came upon his life and say in Hebrews 11 that out of weakness we're made strong I mean so so Shamar was in a situation of weakness but it was time for the strength of God to come into his life for the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost to come into his life so am me so something happened within him that he realized I am the mechanics I am the mechanics amen and the Holy Ghost is the Dynamics amen and he realized being a son of Abraham circumcised believer that was all that he needed am me so he grabbed the first thing he could grab what was it had your Ox go not even a weapon jumps out of his window charges into those Philistines now thinking man this guy's a joke obviously this is just a suicide charge and it's all over not the shamba why cuz the Dynamics had met the mechanics amen and then every single one of those Philistines were were were downed amen hallelujah and he kept his Blessing now you got to realize that you know an Oxo doesn't look like much right you saw a man with a stick charging after you your stick B you think now well this is going to be real quick and then you be thinking where am I going to eat my Harvest next year cuz he's going to be dead but the Dynamics came into it and every single one of those Philistines were dead now you take you take even you know you got to you got to really go with what's in your heart the scripture that God has quickened in your heart you got to realize that's a weapon of mass mass destruction amen that will down every devil that's come to try and steal your joy and blessing I mean you even look at you even look at you know the shortest the shortest verse in the Bible Jesus wept that don't look like much of a weapon but when the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost comes into that scripture amen it will change your life and kill every enemy that tries to rob you I mean you take even like a depression devil or a loneliness devil those those two words Quicken to you by the Dynamics am me will give you a strengthen the trial why because Jesus when he stood there and he wept he had feeling for his friends he was s s humanly that that Lazarus was dead he was feeling the sadness of Mary and Martha he wasn't indifferent amen so kills the devil saying God is indifferent to what you're going through notice Jesus when he came to lazarus's grave he knew already Lazarus was going to come forth he did not tell he did not tell Mary Martha be quiet woman the resurrection's going to happen just harden up just take it no he felt their infir so he wept he's a God that cares and when when you realize God cares for you amen it'll give you a strength amen it'll give you a real strength hallelujah amen you know you know the biggest criticism brother Braham had in his ministry from someone he he relates it all the time he says you know this woman comes to and says look you're bragging too much on Jesus he was just a man this woman say he said no he was divine and she says look I'll prove to you from your own Bible that Jesus was just a man and she would read Jesus wept at lazarus's grave and she would say how could the Divine weep see as the Devil comes along says God is some distant distant thing that doesn't care about you amen but he says look he was the god man he was a man there weeping CU he had the feeling for his friends he was sad Lazarus was dead he was sad his friends had suffered this loss but friends if we could just realize God God carries our burdens and our troubles and our hurts and he understands he weeps with you when you're going through hard times but that's not the end that's that's not the End Amen Lazarus was called forth he he was a man when he wept amen but he was the god you he was a God man he was the man part weeping but it was God that said Lazarus come forth and we know that if he just said come forth there would have been a general Resurrection Hallelujah so what you can take that Jesus wept and you can kill a depression devil you can kill that devil that tells you God don't care you can kill the devil it says you feel lonely and you should be you know no one understands Jesus understands Hallelujah so what's in your hand what's in your hand today I'm just going to close with this let let's have the musicians but what's in
