[40:28] [Music]
[40:29] he said no I've got a different sort of
[40:30] an item so I'm going to call up brother
[40:31] Ben and he's got an item for you this
[40:40] morning amen yeah that's a different
[40:42] card of an item amen praise the Lord um
[40:46] you just want to all stand with me we
[40:48] got a very special moment we're going to
[40:49] have this morning amen so you just want
[40:52] to start playing there musicians you
[40:53] want to stay where you are we're going
[40:54] to sing a song afterwards but um and
[40:58] [Music]
[41:41] amen
[41:42] so brother Matthew sister Priscilla
[41:45] approached me last week saying they want
[41:46] to renew their wedding vows it's been 20
[41:49] years praise the Lord and you just want
[41:51] to come stand here we'll just I wish we
[41:53] had more room do you want to stand side
[41:54] by side you know amen I got a few words
[41:56] to say
[41:58] um first you know this is a very special
[42:01] day amen and you know I was I was
[42:03] thinking about before we go to the vows
[42:06] I mean who loves the milm family you
[42:08] know I just marvel it's like when you
[42:11] guys move down here it's like hand on
[42:13] glove you just kind of just slot it in
[42:14] it's just family it's a beautiful thing
[42:18] yeah brother Ram says in kinsman
[42:21] redeemer he said hatred had a beginning
[42:23] and so it has to have an end love had no
[42:26] beginning so it has no end hatred is
[42:28] forever love is eternal hatred begins
[42:31] and hatred will end but love never did
[42:33] begin and it never will end see it's
[42:35] Eternal and When a Man Loves a Woman and
[42:39] marries her because she's just pretty
[42:41] there'll be an end to that but when a
[42:43] man finds a woman that he loves he don't
[42:45] know why but he loves her and she finds
[42:47] a man that she loves no matter what he
[42:50] looks like he loves her she loves him
[42:52] that's an eternal mate in glory death
[42:55] nor nothing else can ever sep at them
[42:58] because they're from eternity and they
[43:00] stepped out into space of time and will
[43:03] return back to Eternity eternity has
[43:05] dropped down in a body called time and
[43:08] then it goes back right up into eternity
[43:10] again it cannot perish and when I read
[43:13] that where where brother says death nor
[43:15] nothing else can ever separate them I
[43:18] thought of you know the Apostle Paul
[43:20] would say in Romans 8 and we know all
[43:22] things work together for good to them
[43:24] that love God to them who are called
[43:26] according to to his purpose for whom he
[43:29] did for know he did also did
[43:30] predestinate to be conformed to the
[43:32] image of his son that he might be the
[43:34] firstborn among many Brethren moreover
[43:37] whom he did predestinate them he also
[43:39] called and whom he called them he also
[43:42] Justified and whom he justified them he
[43:45] also glorified what shall we say then to
[43:48] these things if God before us who can be
[43:51] against us hallelujah he that se spared
[43:54] not his own son but delivered him up for
[43:57] us all how shall he not with him also
[44:00] freely give us all things who who shall
[44:04] lay anything to the charge of God's
[44:05] elect it is God that justifieth who is
[44:08] he that condemneth it is Christ that
[44:10] died yay rather that is risen again who
[44:12] is even at the right hand of God who
[44:14] maketh intercession for us amen I just
[44:17] love this this why I started way up
[44:18] there instead of you know from what I'm
[44:19] about to read who shall separate us from
[44:21] the love of Christ shall tribulation or
[44:24] distress or persecution or famine or
[44:26] nakedness or peril sword for it is
[44:28] written for thy sake we are killed all
[44:29] the day long we are accounted as sheep
[44:32] for the slaughter now in all these
[44:34] things we are more than conquerors
[44:35] through him that loved us for I'm
[44:37] persuaded that neither death nor life
[44:39] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[44:41] nor things present nor things to come
[44:43] nor height nor depth nor any other
[44:45] creature shall be able to separate us
[44:47] from the love of God which is in Christ
[44:50] Jesus our lord that's what I read he
[44:53] said death or nothing will separate them
[44:54] I thought yeah the Apostle Paul said
[44:56] nothing can separate a real love
[44:58] Hallelujah so amen so I'm going to I'm
[45:01] going to I'll hold the microphone Shalla

[53:38] thank you everyone yeah I it was it was
[53:41] a surprise that's why I thought well how
[53:42] can I make it a surprise and say well
[53:44] I've got an item now that's a surprise
[53:46] anyway but God bless you brother Matthew
[53:48] sister Priscilla amen um I sound a lot
[53:53] worse than I feel I feel actually fine
[53:55] I've got a few frogs but you know so if
[53:57] I start croaking up I'll just start
[53:59] sipping water and we'll be okay but um I
[54:02] got tested for Co and it's negative so
[54:05] don't worry I don't have that you know
[54:07] but you
[54:09] anyway
[54:11] so amen I I I have a slideshow here um
[54:16] got a couple of scripture readings here
[54:17] if we want to go to Luke chapter 22 then
[54:19] we're going to go to Ephesians chapter 2
[54:22] um I want to follow him behind what
[54:23] Brother Andy was preaching on on
[54:25] Wednesday
[54:27] these things I didn't get to last um
[54:29] Sunday or whenever but you know I love
[54:31] it how he said we can never be two free
[54:34] I like that statement we can never be
[54:36] two free so I want I pray we just go in
[54:39] behind that and you know hit the devil
[54:41] for a
[54:43] six all those who know
[54:46] Cricket Luke
[54:48] 22:31 and the Lord
[54:51] said we're going to get through
[54:54] this and the Lord said Simon Simon
[54:57] behold Satan hath desired to have you
[55:00] that he may sift you as wheat but I have
[55:02] prayed for thee that thy faith fail not
[55:06] and when thou art converted strengthen
[55:08] the Brethren amen uh so basically the
[55:11] devil had plans for um for um Simon's
[55:15] life but then God had plans and God
[55:17] canceled the devil's plans this is
[55:19] basically the Crux of my sermon today
[55:23] um God loves to cancel the devil's plans
[55:27] amen Ephesians 2 and 1 and you have he
[55:31] quickened who were dead and trespassed
[55:33] and sins ACC uh wherein in times past
[55:36] you walked according to the course of
[55:37] this world according to the prince of
[55:39] the power of the air the spirit that now
[55:41] worketh in the children of Disobedience
[55:44] among whom also we had all our
[55:46] conversation in times past so we live
[55:49] the same way they did and the lust of
[55:51] our flesh fulfilling the desires of the
[55:53] Flesh and of the mind and we by Nature
[55:56] the children of Wrath even as others
[55:58] aren't you glad he changed your nature
[55:59] amen amen but God who is rich in Mercy
[56:02] for his great lover and he loved us even
[56:05] when we were dead in sins hath quickened
[56:07] us together with Christ by Grace ye are
[56:10] saved and hath raised us up together and
[56:13] made us sit together in Heavenly places
[56:16] in Christ Jesus you know I love it when
[56:17] people make you sit in a
[56:19] place he's made us to sit there amen
[56:22] hallelujah amen but in the ages to come
[56:25] he might show the exceeding Riches of
[56:27] his grace and his kindness towards us
[56:29] through Christ Jesus for by Grace you're
[56:31] saved through faith and that not of
[56:33] yourselves it is the gift of God not of
[56:36] Works lest any man should boast amen may
[56:40] the Lord bless the reading of his word
[56:41] you may have your seats this
[56:47] morning now we've been I think last
[56:50] Sunday we're looking into
[56:52] Joshua and and how Joshua we understand
[56:56] the Book of Joshua parallels the book of
[56:58] Ephesians where the book of Ephesians
[57:00] the Apostle Paul would tell the church
[57:01] their position in Christ he would he
[57:04] would tell them the armor that they have
[57:06] he' tell them what the Lord has done for
[57:07] them and and it's the same with Joshua
[57:10] the Book of Joshua we we we have been
[57:12] taught that um the Book of Joshua is
[57:15] where where what the word that was given
[57:18] to Moses now Moses could never take the
[57:20] could never take the children of Israel
[57:21] into the land because he represented the
[57:23] law but Grace had to place them in the
[57:25] land and and so Joshua is now the tribes
[57:28] being positioned in their in their part
[57:30] of the land just like we are put into
[57:32] our part of the body of Christ so they
[57:34] are put in the promised land now I just
[57:36] want you just to maybe just go back in
[57:38] your mind when you when you think about
[57:40] the Book of Joshua You Know The Enemy
[57:42] did not quit did not leave the land just
[57:44] because they took Jericho right he
[57:47] didn't you know they didn't just they
[57:48] didn't just leave they didn't just all
[57:50] leave AI they didn't leave any other
[57:52] part of the land just because Israel was
[57:54] taking more of the land but they were
[57:56] still fortified they still had their
[57:58] troops and basically the devil was
[57:59] saying when he built Jericho he says
[58:01] he's basically saying to God your
[58:03] children aren't coming in here and then
[58:04] they took Jericho and then no doubt the
[58:06] devil would say no you're not taking Ai
[58:08] and you're not taking this place you're
[58:10] not taking this place but Joshua was
[58:12] anointed he was he was commissioned that
[58:14] they would take the entire promised land
[58:16] it's the same thing with us we come in
[58:18] but the devil says you may have this
[58:19] spot but you're not going to have the
[58:20] spot so you may be justified but you're
[58:22] not going to get Sanctified then you get
[58:23] Sanctified oh okay so you may get sanify
[58:26] but you're not going to get filled with
[58:27] the Holy Ghost then you get filled with
[58:28] the Holy Ghost he says well you may have
[58:30] the Holy Ghost but you're not going to
[58:31] be adopted into the body then you get
[58:33] adopted into the body right there's a
[58:35] power in the bride that's going to get
[58:37] her into her position in in Christ right
[58:39] but now but the devil's basically saying
[58:41] you ain't going to get it prise the Lord
[58:43] amen but you know we just got to kill
[58:45] some devils we're got to take out our
[58:46] Giants you know it's not a one one time
[58:48] thing you know there were more than just
[58:50] one giant to kill amen there in the days
[58:52] of David so it's the same thing there's
[58:54] you there's actually demon power is
[58:56] actually you know just like in heaven
[58:59] there's archangels there's there's other
[59:01] Angels there that are less powerful than
[59:03] archangels you know just like a
[59:05] hierarchy in heaven are you all
[59:07] following me you know just like in a
[59:08] natural Kingdom there's the there's say
[59:10] there's the Prime Minister then under
[59:12] there's the deputy there's the cabinet
[59:13] you know everyone has a hierarchy in the
[59:15] government right it's the same thing in
[59:18] heaven but then it's also the same thing
[59:21] in Demon power
[59:23] because because remember demons just
[59:26] Fallen Angels they had a position they
[59:28] had a position in heaven they had
[59:29] different powers different things they
[59:30] did when they fell they just came in a
[59:33] perverted form of what they had so now
[59:36] it's those head demon powers that we've
[59:38] got to take out just like David killed
[59:43] Goliath we're going to get
[59:45] there you know all right okay you know
[59:49] just like David killed Goliath Israel
[59:51] rallied and then they beat the
[59:53] Philistines down but it was when Goliath
[59:55] was taken out now that's when the rest
[59:57] of them who didn't have the ability to
[59:59] do it could rally and take out the
[1:00:01] Philistines now brother brandham he he
[1:00:03] he gives the account of when he is
[1:00:05] confronted by the maniac in Oregon now
[1:00:08] as I I'll probably come back to this as
[1:00:10] the Lord leads but
[1:00:12] um so don't read it too quick now so so
[1:00:16] so he's coming to this so so he's
[1:00:18] relaying this account of when the maniac
[1:00:20] you know I'm sure we all know the story
[1:00:22] of when the maniac comes before him on
[1:00:24] the platform in Oregon and ches and the
[1:00:26] devil is challenging the prophet of God
[1:00:28] basically saying I'm going to tear you
[1:00:29] limb from limb and and brother Tommy
[1:00:31] Osborne was in this meeting this is
[1:00:33] actually inspired him am mean to
[1:00:35] actually go back him and his wife and
[1:00:36] read the Bible again and see that Jesus
[1:00:38] Christ is alive you can hear Tommy
[1:00:40] osband give the account and so it says
[1:00:42] and these police found out that he had
[1:00:44] broken a Jawbone in a shoulder of a
[1:00:46] minister the day before and they had uh
[1:00:48] a search warrant out to get him or a
[1:00:50] warrant to get him rather right away and
[1:00:52] he was out of the insane and insane
[1:00:55] Institution he just didn't like
[1:00:57] preachers he just hit them
[1:00:59] everything so he thought then he could
[1:01:01] do it and when he run up there and how
[1:01:04] the Holy Spirit
[1:01:07] leading I know at that moment
[1:01:10] now excuse me without a vision first
[1:01:13] something said to me don't be afraid and
[1:01:16] I when he come to me I thought of what
[1:01:18] that angel said I'll be with you I
[1:01:20] thought if you if you're here which you
[1:01:22] said you'd be then what's he now this
[1:01:25] should be personal because the Lord said
[1:01:27] I'll never leave you nor forsake you so
[1:01:30] if the Lord is with us then who's this
[1:01:31] guy amen now how will this uncircumcised
[1:01:35] Philistine defy the Living God so he
[1:01:37] come up um come he come on up towards me
[1:01:40] he said I'll break every bone in your
[1:01:42] body and he drew back his fist I said
[1:01:44] because you've challenged the spirit of
[1:01:46] God tonight you'll fall over my feet I
[1:01:48] didn't know I said that see that was a
[1:01:51] spirit talking it done took over then
[1:01:55] hallelujah
[1:01:56] so there uh there was both challenges he
[1:01:59] run up to me and said I'll show you
[1:02:00] whose feet I'll fall over and he drew
[1:02:03] back his great big fist like that and
[1:02:05] the audience sat Spellbound and just as
[1:02:08] he drew back his Fe fist I said Satan
[1:02:10] come out of him and he threw his hand
[1:02:13] hands back like that his eyes bulged way
[1:02:15] up like that rolled over he threw his
[1:02:18] head back and spun around uh around the
[1:02:21] floor and fell on my feet so that the
[1:02:23] police had to come and roll him off my
[1:02:26] feet uh for I could move right across
[1:02:29] the platform he was perfectly just
[1:02:31] laying there the police said is that is
[1:02:33] that man dead I said no sir said is he
[1:02:36] healed I said no he worships that Spirit
[1:02:39] see he' bring it back to him because he
[1:02:42] thinks he's
[1:02:44] right now who's heard brother B say
[1:02:47] people worship Spirits now how do they
[1:02:49] worship that spirit cuz they think it's
[1:02:51] he's right they think they're right so
[1:02:53] they can have a lust Spirit on them
[1:02:55] unforgiveness bitterness resentment
[1:02:57] whatever Spirit it may be and because
[1:02:59] they think they're entitled to feel that
[1:03:01] way then that's that them worshiping
[1:03:03] that
[1:03:03] Spirit oh yes oh yes let's just bring it
[1:03:06] on home this is what people you know
[1:03:08] don't care about God they think they're
[1:03:10] right everyone else is wrong everyone
[1:03:12] everyone's wrong them and they're the
[1:03:13] victim of everything it's a spirit
[1:03:15] they're worshiping because they think
[1:03:17] they are right so I say Lord help us
[1:03:19] that our mind is not filtered through a
[1:03:21] spirit but may it be through your holy
[1:03:24] spirit that we can see every situation
[1:03:26] according to your word and not according
[1:03:28] to how I feel about it right so it says
[1:03:31] he isn't healed um they rolled him over
[1:03:34] I said get him off my feet he was he was
[1:03:36] cramping me he laying there that big man
[1:03:38] up on my feet I couldn't move my feet
[1:03:40] out and both of them together and so I
[1:03:42] couldn't move my feet out they rolled
[1:03:43] him over I took my feet out away uh and
[1:03:47] went on to
[1:03:49] get and at that time when all them
[1:03:51] demons had seen their Chief man defeated
[1:03:54] they just be to raise up out of wheel
[1:03:55] chairs cot stretches everything El and
[1:03:57] walk that was the end of the meeting
[1:03:59] they just everyone was just healed and
[1:04:01] walked out that was it everything see
[1:04:04] now you see when Satan Was Defeated
[1:04:06] there the whole audience believed with
[1:04:08] one Accord and went out Hallelujah so
[1:04:11] what happened is the chief devil in that
[1:04:12] place got defeated then the Lesser ones
[1:04:15] cuz there a bunch of cows said well we
[1:04:16] better run boys cuz we're going to get
[1:04:17] our heads taken off too and then what
[1:04:19] happened as as as the bondage that was
[1:04:21] holding down the people in the audience
[1:04:23] there were people in that audience that
[1:04:25] beli God God right they had Faith but
[1:04:28] because that demon was there holding
[1:04:30] back that Faith right once he was cast
[1:04:32] out once he once he was defeated then
[1:04:34] people being spontaneously healed why
[1:04:37] cuz the Giant in the land got taken out
[1:04:40] Hallelujah it should be the same thing
[1:04:41] you know we shouldn't be an ice cube
[1:04:42] sitting here this is not a freezer we
[1:04:46] have a walk-in freezer you know at work
[1:04:48] and just this cold thing blows on you
[1:04:50] it's- 20° we keep our samples and things
[1:04:52] in there those who have walked in those
[1:04:54] kind of environments know what it's like
[1:04:56] you don't want to be in that kind of
[1:04:57] atmosphere too long there's no life
[1:04:59] everything's just frigid and Frozen we
[1:05:01] don't want to be a bunch of ice cubes I
[1:05:03] mean this is not an ice cube place this
[1:05:04] is a place of Life Hallelujah this is
[1:05:06] place where God should move and your
[1:05:08] reality of God should happen and
[1:05:11] Hallelujah so so once the chief one was
[1:05:12] taken out then the other ones ran tuck
[1:05:14] tail and run Hallelujah and it should be
[1:05:17] the same thing here you know you know
[1:05:19] there's demon powers trying to hold back
[1:05:20] every service you know the devil resists
[1:05:23] us when we come into the house of God he
[1:05:25] resists us when we pray he resists us
[1:05:27] when we would read our Bible you know he
[1:05:29] resists us when we want to sing and we
[1:05:31] don't sing and we just sit there and we
[1:05:33] don't we just stand there maybe we go
[1:05:35] through the motions you know we just
[1:05:36] kind of conform and see well whatever
[1:05:39] kind of read the mood of the room and
[1:05:40] just kind of conform to what everyone
[1:05:42] else is doing we shouldn't just I don't
[1:05:45] worship God I don't raise my hands cuz
[1:05:47] other people are raising their hands I
[1:05:48] don't worship and sing cuz other people
[1:05:50] are doing it no this should be something
[1:05:52] from my heart H Lord you're so good you
[1:05:55] you've redeemed me I've been washed in
[1:05:56] your blood I'm a new creature in you
[1:05:58] Hallelujah and that's why we sing that's
[1:06:00] why we praise God Amen Hallelujah yes
[1:06:03] amen so once the chief one was taken out
[1:06:05] then there was a great Liberty came into
[1:06:07] the place Hallelujah and I believe we
[1:06:09] can have the same kind of thing you say
[1:06:11] well there's no demon power holding us
[1:06:13] back I guarantee you the devil's here
[1:06:16] too you know I used to go to a
[1:06:19] Pentecostal Church before I went ever
[1:06:20] went to a Methodist Church I didn't have
[1:06:22] any trouble sitting in that place but as
[1:06:25] soon as I had to go where the truth was
[1:06:26] the devil would say you should walk out
[1:06:28] a voice would actually tell me I should
[1:06:29] leave get up and walk out and I realized
[1:06:32] he now devil you get out I'm not
[1:06:35] leaving you get out I'm not going out I
[1:06:37] never had that kind of problem in the
[1:06:39] Pentecostal church and when I came to
[1:06:41] the message church I thought now I'm
[1:06:42] finally getting fed so wasn't wrong with
[1:06:44] what was being taught wasn't wrong with
[1:06:46] the people but the Devil comes and
[1:06:48] fights you in your mind to try and to
[1:06:50] try and deflect what God is trying to
[1:06:51] get across to you we should be very
[1:06:54] aware of those things
[1:06:56] Lord but our God's greater than all
[1:06:57] those things
[1:07:02] hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:07:04] so once the chief one was taken out amen
[1:07:09] then the Lesser ones
[1:07:10] ran
[1:07:12] Hallelujah now we're living in a
[1:07:15] time how God
[1:07:17] Lives Hallelujah I'm just trying to get
[1:07:20] back to where we were now as I say in
[1:07:22] the
[1:07:23] beginning the that God cancels the
[1:07:27] devil's plans now I think someone
[1:07:30] preached this overseas someplace but I
[1:07:31] can't remember but it sounded cool and
[1:07:33] when I was but not because that
[1:07:36] triggered this When I Was preparing a
[1:07:37] couple of weeks ago this you you this
[1:07:39] came on my heart but you
[1:07:41] know God told Jesus told
[1:07:45] Peter that the devil has desired to sift
[1:07:48] you as wheat so so the devil had plans
[1:07:51] for the Apostle Peter right he had plans
[1:07:55] but God canceled his plans and God had
[1:07:59] another plan for his life now I just
[1:08:00] want you to notice that God doesn't
[1:08:02] automatically just a cancel plan that
[1:08:04] nothing actually goes into motion you
[1:08:06] know God actually allows the devil just
[1:08:08] enough rope to hang himself he actually
[1:08:11] allows him to go far enough to look like
[1:08:12] a fool what happened in the days of
[1:08:15] Moses you know you know he actually
[1:08:17] allowed he actually allowed pharaoh and
[1:08:19] his army to try and chase them across an
[1:08:21] open Red Sea but it was just a death
[1:08:24] trap to pharaoh and his men it was
[1:08:26] actually making the devil look like a
[1:08:28] fool Hallelujah and that's what God
[1:08:30] actually allows the devil to go far
[1:08:32] enough and he thinks he's oh I've got
[1:08:34] them now and then God comes on the scene
[1:08:36] and the devil just looks looks like a
[1:08:38] complete fool Hallelujah so here we have
[1:08:41] you know his plans were you know go you
[1:08:44] know Satan's plans for Simon Peter just
[1:08:46] just fell apart and actually did good
[1:08:48] for Simon because he was the one who
[1:08:50] jumped out the boat walked on the water
[1:08:52] he gave the answers he was the one who
[1:08:53] was going to you know he took the sword
[1:08:55] SW he is the one who drew the sword you
[1:08:57] know they had two swords that says in
[1:08:59] the scripture but the other guy didn't
[1:09:00] draw it out maybe Simon Peter was a
[1:09:03] commander guy with both who knows but he
[1:09:05] just drew one out yeah but noas drew a
[1:09:07] sword to defend the Lord he was the one
[1:09:08] to the you know and so but he had to end
[1:09:13] up as a total failure for then God to
[1:09:15] rebuild him and use him as a spokesman
[1:09:17] there in the book of Acts so you know
[1:09:19] even the devil's plans God could just
[1:09:20] twist it around in such a way that
[1:09:22] actually works out for our good
[1:09:24] Hallelujah you know hmon had a lot of
[1:09:26] plans in the Book of Esther and God
[1:09:29] would allow his plans to go far enough
[1:09:32] just to ensure hmon would build a
[1:09:34] scaffold Hallelujah that hmon would end
[1:09:37] up being hung and and all his PL see he
[1:09:39] just looked like total full imagine
[1:09:41] imagine that feeling you've actually so
[1:09:44] you're at the feast there with the queen
[1:09:46] it's the second one you've been invited
[1:09:48] to by the way so you think oh I've
[1:09:49] really arrived you know yeah it's you
[1:09:52] the king and the Queen no one else it's
[1:09:54] the second banquet of wines that the
[1:09:55] queen actually the queen invited you to
[1:09:58] it it wasn't you trying to push yourself
[1:10:00] into the Inner Circle they just been
[1:10:01] they've just drawn you into the Inner
[1:10:03] Circle and you think finally My Day of
[1:10:05] Victory is here I built the scaffold
[1:10:06] this is how it's going to happen but
[1:10:08] imagine the feeling when the queen would
[1:10:11] begin to speak to the king and maybe
[1:10:12] they're making small talk before who
[1:10:14] knows but then the but then the
[1:10:16] atmosphere in the room gets a bit
[1:10:17] serious where the king says now why
[1:10:20] Esther why did you invite me to this
[1:10:21] Feast what's this really all about yeah
[1:10:25] and and then I don't know what hmon was
[1:10:26] thinking about that that at that time
[1:10:28] but he would have so it up real quick
[1:10:30] when she would have said oh King the
[1:10:33] life of myself and my people are in
[1:10:35] Jeopardy we're under a death
[1:10:37] sentence and he's got in his mind I'm
[1:10:40] going to kill I'm going to kill morai
[1:10:42] maybe he's already been imagining what
[1:10:43] is like him kicking up you know being
[1:10:45] hung between heavens and earth there
[1:10:47] dying maybe he's been imagining that
[1:10:48] kind of stuff and then and then he hears
[1:10:50] this come out of the Queen's mouth and
[1:10:52] she he realizes for the first moment
[1:10:55] she's a Jew and I'm the enemy of her and
[1:10:59] she's the queen imagine that
[1:11:02] feeling imagine and then and then he
[1:11:04] tries to you know the king gets so mad
[1:11:06] he storms out walks around the garden
[1:11:08] just you know how could this ever happen
[1:11:10] and she tries to petition the queen
[1:11:14] please spare me and then the but the esa
[1:11:17] made up her mind you gone down you stood
[1:11:20] against my people you're going down it
[1:11:21] should be the same thing with the devil
[1:11:23] devil you come against my family you're
[1:11:24] going down
[1:11:25] you've come against me you're going down
[1:11:27] Satan you're going to hang you're going
[1:11:28] to look like a fool as a defeated being
[1:11:32] H you you tried to work this out for for
[1:11:35] for my demise but it's going to bring
[1:11:36] your
[1:11:37] demise Hallelujah so imagine that
[1:11:39] feeling and then she doesn't she's not
[1:11:41] going to intercede for her enemy and
[1:11:43] then so and then and then the you know
[1:11:46] the you know the cloth or whatever's you
[1:11:49] know you the servant comes along puts
[1:11:51] the thing over his head cuz he's going
[1:11:52] to die that's the last thing he sees
[1:11:54] Maybe was was the queen standing there
[1:11:58] triumphant amen Hall see the the plan
[1:12:02] went long
[1:12:04] enough just to make him look like a
[1:12:07] fool God cancelled Hon's plans yes
[1:12:12] Hallelujah the three Hebrew
[1:12:16] children God canceled their plan I mean
[1:12:18] not their plans but he canceled their
[1:12:20] enemies
[1:12:22] plans you're following me this may be
[1:12:24] very Elementary we say well I'm going
[1:12:25] through a real big trial you know
[1:12:27] there's a real hardship there's
[1:12:28] everything's against me just just have
[1:12:31] faith in God lord just have faith in God
[1:12:34] God will see you through it amen
[1:12:35] hallelujah they were in their last step
[1:12:38] or they're just about to be thrown into
[1:12:39] the furnace and they're there in the
[1:12:41] furnace you know and God canceled the
[1:12:44] heat affecting them all it did was
[1:12:46] release some of the bands that they were
[1:12:48] tied in Hallelujah and he had and he had
[1:12:50] fellowship with them as the fourth man
[1:12:52] so remember trials all they really do is
[1:12:54] is is actually just burn out the ropes
[1:12:57] of hindrance that are hindering your
[1:12:58] life maybe maybe there's a resentment
[1:13:01] maybe there's just a pain or something
[1:13:02] you just put up a wall and why do you
[1:13:04] act this way and God puts you allows you
[1:13:06] to go through a furnace and you walk out
[1:13:08] of that trolley say I don't respond that
[1:13:10] way anymore Something's Happened what's
[1:13:12] happened the ropes that bound you up
[1:13:14] they just got burnt off Hallelujah then
[1:13:16] you can walk free sir so it really does
[1:13:18] you good Lord hallelujah Daniel being
[1:13:21] thrown to the Lion's Den Hallelujah
[1:13:24] remember God canceled remember God
[1:13:26] didn't God didn't keep the Hebrew
[1:13:27] children out of the fire he didn't keep
[1:13:29] Daniel out of the Lion's there he put
[1:13:31] them right in it he allowed them to to
[1:13:34] you know Daniel was there all night he
[1:13:36] had a line for a you know he had Leo the
[1:13:38] line for a
[1:13:39] cushion Hallelujah he did Hallelujah
[1:13:43] that's right Glory you know but his the
[1:13:47] devil's plans were cancelled and the and
[1:13:50] the whole process the purpose of the
[1:13:52] lion then was to get rid of Daniel's
[1:13:54] critics
[1:13:56] so it did good amen
[1:14:00] hallelujah he say well what's this got
[1:14:02] to do with me well we just read here in
[1:14:04] Ephesians that we once walked according
[1:14:06] to the prince of the power of this world
[1:14:09] the devil had plans for us yeah you know
[1:14:11] the devil when he when he made Adam and
[1:14:13] Eve fall he knew that God was a just God
[1:14:16] he knew that God was a god of his word
[1:14:18] he stood there remember the Angels were
[1:14:20] the first things created the prophet
[1:14:21] tells us so he stood there Lucifer stood
[1:14:24] there and saw God I don't know what kind
[1:14:26] of form he was in saying let there be
[1:14:28] sun moon and stars and he saw sun moon
[1:14:30] and stars materialize he saw the Earth
[1:14:32] come into its place and he saw Life
[1:14:34] begin to come upon the Earth you know so
[1:14:37] God so the devil knew that God is a god
[1:14:40] of his word so what he says happens
[1:14:43] right he didn't say let there be a sun
[1:14:45] and then there was a bowl of jelly
[1:14:47] materialized no it was a sun right or
[1:14:49] let there be a moon and it was a banana
[1:14:52] no it was the Moon it was was exactly
[1:14:55] what he said it would be it materialized
[1:14:58] so when when God would say to say to
[1:15:01] Adam and Eve do not eat of the tree of
[1:15:02] the knowledge of Good and Evil because
[1:15:03] the day you eat the other day you shall
[1:15:05] die he knew that God being a god of his
[1:15:07] word death would come yeah right P guilt
[1:15:11] you sin would come death would come amen
[1:15:13] so he knew well he's going to be a he's
[1:15:15] going to be a one that will punish so
[1:15:17] you know so he caused us to come in such
[1:15:20] a way that our first birth actually
[1:15:22] condemns us the nature that we're born
[1:15:24] with right so so his plan so the devil's
[1:15:27] plan for you and I was to actually cause
[1:15:30] us to be born in a fallen state that
[1:15:33] that Fallen state would cause us to go
[1:15:35] to judgment and be condemned by the
[1:15:37] things we did in the flesh amen amen
[1:15:40] that that that's the devil's plan but
[1:15:42] God cancels the devil's plan
[1:15:47] hallelujah hallelujah so so he began to
[1:15:50] cancel the devil's plan even under the
[1:15:51] blood of bulls and goats he made a
[1:15:53] propitiation even for even as Adam and
[1:15:56] Eve were walking out of the
[1:15:59] garden they were clothed in Lamb skins
[1:16:02] brother said even the blood of those
[1:16:03] Lambs was still dripping down their legs
[1:16:05] as they walking like the skin was
[1:16:07] beating against their legs as they
[1:16:08] walking out and that was a physical
[1:16:10] manifestation of a promise that the son
[1:16:13] that that the seed of the woman is going
[1:16:15] to undo going to cancel this plan
[1:16:17] permanently Hallelujah so so all the
[1:16:19] Believers Through the Ages were were
[1:16:21] living under that promise now but the
[1:16:24] thing is we know the blood of bulls and
[1:16:25] goats could never change our nature so
[1:16:27] the nature we were born with you know I
[1:16:29] just want to by the end of the service I
[1:16:31] just want you to pray by the spirit of
[1:16:33] God you'll realize you are so free you
[1:16:35] have no part of the devil the devil has
[1:16:37] no part on you there's there's such a
[1:16:39] gulf between you and Satan yeah there's
[1:16:42] such a gulf there was a gulf between you
[1:16:43] and God one day but that Gulf has been
[1:16:45] eradicated and now there's actually a
[1:16:47] Chasm you have nothing in common yeah
[1:16:50] it's amazing you know people you know
[1:16:53] ordinarily we would probably never meet
[1:16:55] on this Earth because the circles that I
[1:16:58] would be in and you know with work and
[1:17:01] stuff we you're not in those circles you
[1:17:04] know you know what I mean so we have no
[1:17:06] we' have nothing in common ordinarily
[1:17:08] right so so we wouldn't have a
[1:17:09] relationship because we had nothing in
[1:17:11] common right but because we have Christ
[1:17:13] we have all things in common but now
[1:17:15] beforehand before the Lord came our way
[1:17:18] we had a relationship with the devil we
[1:17:21] had a lot of things in common with him
[1:17:23] that's right right hatred Strife Envy
[1:17:26] lust whatever it was anything that God
[1:17:28] made just perverted and he gives it to
[1:17:29] you and the nature you have loves it
[1:17:32] that you're born with right because the
[1:17:34] devil twists our own desires so we had a
[1:17:37] lot of fellowship with them but then one
[1:17:41] day Jesus came and canceled that plan
[1:17:45] remember he lets the devil come far
[1:17:47] enough just to look like a fool you say
[1:17:50] well I've had a very dark past God wants
[1:17:52] to use that past oh yeah
[1:17:55] to shake the kingdom of Hell to shake
[1:17:58] the kingdom of Hell doesn't matter if
[1:18:01] you're just keep praying for this thing
[1:18:05] amen anyway you know our past should be
[1:18:10] such a as is actually such a we don't
[1:18:12] glorify our past now we don't glorify
[1:18:14] what we did but if someone comes along
[1:18:16] and they're struggling with the same
[1:18:18] thing you can enter into their burden
[1:18:20] and intercede for them in prayer like no
[1:18:22] one else can Hallelujah that's powerful
[1:18:25] even to be raised in church not knowing
[1:18:28] god then one day you meet him you can
[1:18:30] intercede for those who are growing up
[1:18:32] in church never known God's real but
[1:18:34] because you've made him you say Lord
[1:18:35] I've walked in their shoes before I know
[1:18:38] what it was like just to sit in church
[1:18:39] and conform and do it because your
[1:18:41] parents said it and this Pastor said it
[1:18:43] whatever said it but then one day it
[1:18:44] became real that is so powerful you can
[1:18:47] use that Amen to intercede for others
[1:18:50] Hallelujah am hallelujah it's an
[1:18:52] incredible thing he said I don't have
[1:18:54] testimony we all have a testimony you've
[1:18:57] been saved you've been saved Hallelujah
[1:19:00] you know what it's like from to reach
[1:19:01] down to his hand for you amen hallelujah
[1:19:05] hallelujah so our God now made a way to
[1:19:08] cancel the devil's plans it's incredible
[1:19:11] you think of Legion Legion didn't wake
[1:19:13] up one day in the tombs he didn't wake
[1:19:16] up one day and now he's in the tombs
[1:19:17] with a legion of devils in him you know
[1:19:20] but but he opened the door maybe by peer
[1:19:23] pressure took a little little drink
[1:19:25] begin to watch the wrong thing begin to
[1:19:26] open his mind to Spirit up you know
[1:19:28] people say well oh you're just too
[1:19:30] narrow-minded well I'll tell you being
[1:19:33] widm minded in the world didn't get me
[1:19:35] very good
[1:19:36] places they just got me in a sewage Pond
[1:19:40] basically let's be honest oh that's
[1:19:43] being open no no I'm actually
[1:19:44] open-minded now cuz my because their
[1:19:46] mind is closed off to a god living it's
[1:19:49] just on material things but now my mind
[1:19:51] is open now God is real Heaven's a place
[1:19:54] to go how a place I'm not going
[1:19:56] Hallelujah cuz I said Lord if you died
[1:19:58] if you died for me I accept it amen
[1:20:01] hallelujah amen hallelujah so now you
[1:20:05] know never let people you know the
[1:20:07] serpent came to Eve and said well you
[1:20:09] just don't know I want to show you
[1:20:10] something cool you live a sheltered
[1:20:13] little kind of life you know you just
[1:20:15] haven't seen what the world's really all
[1:20:17] about I want to tell you what it's
[1:20:18] really all about and God wanted to tell
[1:20:20] her what it was really all about but the
[1:20:22] devil always come along first and give
[1:20:24] us the Pervert way give us the wrong
[1:20:26] kind of way I don't know who I'm talking
[1:20:28] to but I'm talking to somebody you know
[1:20:29] he always say look at this oh you just
[1:20:31] so are you're boring you're lame you're
[1:20:34] a square I think they used to say that
[1:20:36] in my day you're an egg you know you got
[1:20:39] to be cool be hip be with it no no you
[1:20:41] don't those things just cause a bunch of
[1:20:44] wreckage along along life's journey I'd
[1:20:47] rather have peace in my spirit there's a
[1:20:49] lot of things unfortunately I can't
[1:20:52] erase from my memory of things I've seen
[1:20:54] and I've
[1:20:55] done you can't you can't you can't push
[1:20:58] the erase button you know you've been
[1:21:00] forgiven cuz the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:21:01] cleanses you from it but it's lodged in
[1:21:03] your spirit and if you could go back if
[1:21:06] I could go back you think I'd want to
[1:21:08] watch those things again no way I'd
[1:21:11] bypass it but it just some things just
[1:21:13] get thrust upon you you can't help
[1:21:16] it TR be frank about it yes sir yes sir
[1:21:20] you know things like
[1:21:21] pornography I don't use that word over

[1:21:35] me about this but you know there's a way
[1:21:37] of icing a cake called a nude
[1:21:40] cake it's just a way of icing it I
[1:21:43] thought I don't I'm not going to Google
[1:21:44] that what will you get yeah you're not
[1:21:47] just going to get what you really want
[1:21:48] to get you get all this other kind of
[1:21:50] crazy stuff right and does it yeah it
[1:21:53] just messes people up that's it not
[1:21:55] talking about the nude cake I'm talking
[1:21:56] about the the wrong kind of nude cake
[1:21:59] anyway you know but stuff just gets
[1:22:02] imprinted in your
[1:22:03] spirit and you say oh that was you know
[1:22:06] people say oh it's so cool no it's not
[1:22:07] cool I remember you know you can be fed
[1:22:11] a demon Spirit can be so upon you you
[1:22:13] can be so you you become so used to it
[1:22:16] now I've probably shared this before but
[1:22:17] you know when I was about 12 to about 15
[1:22:21] 16 I played this little tabletop game
[1:22:23] you know you paint armies and you roll
[1:22:25] dice and you cast spells and you know I
[1:22:28] used to love it but then after I meet
[1:22:31] the Lord years later I walk into a shop
[1:22:34] where it's sold I just felt a demon
[1:22:36] Spirit on the thing just walking it's
[1:22:37] like this filthy horrible Spirit but I
[1:22:40] used to live in that atmosphere I I was
[1:22:42] used to that atmosphere that was my
[1:22:44] normal that's like a fish that lives in
[1:22:46] the bottom of the ocean without any
[1:22:48] light that that's that's their normal
[1:22:50] but then if they get lifted up by a
[1:22:52] current into the sunlight they get a new
[1:22:54] normal and why would they want to go
[1:22:55] back into darkness again oh that's the
[1:22:57] same thing with you and I like why would
[1:22:59] I want to go back with that kind of
[1:23:02] stuff and live in darkness and it's the
[1:23:05] same Spirit on computer games
[1:23:07] entertainment everything amen that's not
[1:23:10] of God does it draw you closer to God or
[1:23:12] does it draw you away from God you say
[1:23:14] well if I live that kind of Life I'll
[1:23:16] have a boring life oh no oh no to live
[1:23:20] in the presence of God to know him in
[1:23:22] the power of his resurrection amen

[1:23:27] Hallelujah I've never been bored once
[1:23:29] I've met him it's not
[1:23:30] boring well I don't believe that taste
[1:23:33] and see that the Lord is good you know
[1:23:36] people who normally have a
[1:23:38] negative
[1:23:39] um they have a negative attitude towards
[1:23:43] Christianity they've never ever met him
[1:23:46] that's right they just think it's some
[1:23:49] church thing and this is just a you know
[1:23:51] no it's not it's not even really about
[1:23:54] this
[1:23:55] yeah it's walking with him that's right
[1:23:59] amen
[1:24:00] hallelujah but you got to you know if
[1:24:02] you've only been in darkness I give you
[1:24:04] an invitation come up into the sunlight

[1:24:22] awesome no but that world wasn't always
[1:24:24] cloud not and awesome you know this
[1:24:26] actually helps me cope with reality I
[1:24:29] don't have to make Homebrew no more I
[1:24:30] don't have to bury myself in a computer
[1:24:32] game no more I don't have to watch
[1:24:34] movies no more or some you know people
[1:24:36] binge watching you know um seasons of of
[1:24:40] of well it's on Netflix now but we used
[1:24:42] to call them TV shows Once Upon a Time
[1:24:45] you know I used to do that kind of thing
[1:24:48] but it's not reality you just get bored
[1:24:49] and you get so engrossed by the stuff
[1:24:51] and you know and you walk out of it at
[1:24:53] the end of the day it's like well what
[1:24:54] did that do for me I used to read I used
[1:24:58] to read books by um you know who's okay
[1:25:02] well I read a lot of things but you know
[1:25:03] I used to read books by this guy Terry
[1:25:06] pratchet I think you pronounced it you
[1:25:07] know the disc World Series who's heard
[1:25:09] of those oh God bless you all but you
[1:25:13] know but you read them and it's
[1:25:16] entertaining and funny because he's
[1:25:18] quite witty and but you read it and then
[1:25:19] you get to the end it's like well that
[1:25:21] was a waste of time and then you read
[1:25:23] another one you get gross again and you
[1:25:25] get the same feeling at the
[1:25:27] end and if we're honest a lot of stuff
[1:25:29] is like that there's just a void there's
[1:25:31] no satisfying
[1:25:33] portion Hallelujah but when you meet
[1:25:35] Jesus Hallelujah it is a satisfying
[1:25:37] portion you say I just need this to cope
[1:25:39] with my life he'll help you cope with
[1:25:41] your life you know we have
[1:25:44] tools we have tools available that the
[1:25:46] world knows nothing
[1:25:50] about I love
[1:25:52] David if we don't get to this well
[1:25:55] forgive me we'll we'll get there one day
[1:25:57] where are
[1:26:03] we I'm glad you're a patient
[1:26:07] people hey what did this
[1:26:10] go
[1:26:11] sorry I should just look on
[1:26:14] my anyway David would say in the
[1:26:17] Psalms when my heart is
[1:26:23] overwhelmed there weer
[1:26:26] no I'm very sorry there we are who's is
[1:26:30] someone driving this too I got to
[1:26:31] support Navigator here we go now he says
[1:26:36] the psalm of David hear Hear My Cry Oh
[1:26:38] God attend to my prayer from the end of
[1:26:41] the Earth will I cry unto thee when my
[1:26:43] heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock
[1:26:46] that is higher than I for thou has been
[1:26:48] a shelter for me and a strong tower from
[1:26:51] the
[1:26:52] enemy not everyone has this Rock to go
[1:26:54] to amen everyone's heart will get
[1:26:58] overwhelmed amen you with me we are
[1:27:00] built the same way as everyone in the
[1:27:02] world we have the same emotional realm
[1:27:05] same bodies everyone's got the same kind
[1:27:07] of equipment amen right but we have a
[1:27:10] predestinated seat on the inside of our
[1:27:11] soul but we have but because we have
[1:27:14] that we have a place of shelter and
[1:27:16] safety to go to so the Bible never ever
[1:27:20] says when you meet the Lord you'll be
[1:27:21] free from worry or you'll be free from
[1:27:24] anxiety or you'll be free from stress
[1:27:26] the Bible doesn't say any of that right
[1:27:29] you will still have those days and
[1:27:31] you'll be upset and worried about things
[1:27:33] but you have a place to go to that you
[1:27:35] can let off the pressure that you can
[1:27:37] actually find a a relief Hallelujah that
[1:27:41] the world knows nothing about they talk
[1:27:43] about you know prescription medicine now
[1:27:45] if you need those things nothing against
[1:27:47] them but you know we have a place to go
[1:27:49] to when my heart is overwhelmed lead me
[1:27:52] to the rock that is higher than I what
[1:27:55] is that rock that's a rock of Revelation
[1:27:56] that you built upon amen so what does
[1:27:59] that rock tell you you're predestinated
[1:28:01] am mean you've been elected I mean
[1:28:03] you've been Blood Bought you've been
[1:28:05] Blood Washed you've been redeemed
[1:28:08] Hallelujah you are the child of God
[1:28:09] you're a son or daughter of God you know
[1:28:11] where you're
[1:28:12] going Hallelujah glory amen he is your
[1:28:16] god he he doesn't save you to lose you
[1:28:19] am mean he saves you to keep you
[1:28:21] Hallelujah and he's not going to drop
[1:28:22] you just before a body changes is going
[1:28:24] to take you all the way through
[1:28:27] hallelujah amen so we have tools we have
[1:28:30] we have a place who's ever felt
[1:28:35] overwhelmed if I who didn't put their
[1:28:37] hand up I need to ask you after the
[1:28:39] service how you how do you stay in that
[1:28:41] kind of
[1:28:43] state
[1:28:46] amen
[1:28:47] but God knew that we would feel
[1:28:50] overwhelmed he doesn't hold us again he
[1:28:52] doesn't hold it against us because we
[1:28:54] do he understands human Frailty he was a
[1:28:58] man himself yeah I Marvel I look at our
[1:29:00] little boy I said Jesus was this
[1:29:02] age
[1:29:05] hallelujah
[1:29:07] amen this is a kind of a jumpy round
[1:29:10] kind of service well we'll get there but
[1:29:12] we're going to take out Giants right
[1:29:14] amen we can never be too
[1:29:17] free be good if we had that plasted
[1:29:19] somewhere on the church somewhere you
[1:29:21] can never be too free
[1:29:24] amen so so why stay in the darkness when
[1:29:26] you can walk in the
[1:29:28] light I've never been bored being a
[1:29:35] Christian
[1:29:37] Hallelujah so now God had a plan the
[1:29:40] devil had a
[1:29:45] plan I can't blink this thing I've got
[1:29:47] to just move it so the devil's plan was
[1:29:50] to keep us under the anointing of
[1:29:53] himself and live according to our first
[1:29:55] nature and the Deeds Done In the Flesh
[1:29:57] would take us to judgment and God was
[1:29:59] righteous would be righteous to judge us
[1:30:01] and find us condemned but God rich in
[1:30:04] Mercy canceled that Devil's plan
[1:30:08] Hallelujah and then that's why he became
[1:30:10] a man am mean to take our place on
[1:30:12] Calvary Hallelujah to redeem us to
[1:30:15] purchase our Salvation when we could not
[1:30:18] when we could not save ourselves I
[1:30:20] couldn't save any of you I couldn't I
[1:30:23] there's nothing I could physically do in
[1:30:25] my own Humanity that could get you to
[1:30:27] heaven it's impossible doesn't matter
[1:30:30] how good I am smart I am how much
[1:30:32] Charisma I might have or sway or
[1:30:34] whatever there's nothing I can do true
[1:30:36] it's only God that can do
[1:30:41] it
[1:30:43] Hallelujah and it's the same
[1:30:46] thing so he came and he cancelled he
[1:30:49] came and cancelled the devil's
[1:30:52] plan by by Dying In the Flesh for us
[1:30:55] redeeming Us by his own blood and then
[1:30:58] the life that was in his blood was now
[1:30:59] released into the church that was
[1:31:01] actually changed their nature now I just
[1:31:04] want to go you know the reason I want to
[1:31:05] go through these things is is I was I
[1:31:07] was thinking about John's John's
[1:31:10] response when the lamb took the
[1:31:12] book now John wept much he wept much I'm
[1:31:17] not going to read it word for word but
[1:31:19] he was weeping when he found no man was
[1:31:21] worthy to to do the second part of
[1:31:23] redemption sure Angels were worthy but
[1:31:26] but but they weren't people a man a man
[1:31:28] lost the book in the beginning so man
[1:31:30] had to claim the book back Adam lost a
[1:31:31] title deed to the Earth so a man had to
[1:31:34] come and claim it back he saw no man was
[1:31:36] found worthy but then Jesus stepped
[1:31:38] forth the root of David stepped forth he
[1:31:40] has prevailed to open the book and loose
[1:31:42] the seals and when he looked he behold
[1:31:45] amen this lamb stepped forth this was
[1:31:48] this lamb
[1:31:50] that this was the lamb that would that
[1:31:53] would he would he would rest on his
[1:31:55] bosom when he was in his Earthly
[1:31:57] pilgrimage this was the lamb that would
[1:31:59] speak to the wind and wind and seas and
[1:32:01] say peace be still this is the one that
[1:32:03] spoke Lazarus out of the Grave you I
[1:32:05] heard brother Dwayne Lawson preach a
[1:32:07] service and he said you know he said
[1:32:09] it's never too late amen Lazarus was 4
[1:32:12] days in the grave dead but it wasn't too
[1:32:15] late for Lazarus Hallelujah Martha maybe
[1:32:17] thought it was too late but it wasn't
[1:32:19] too late for Lazarus am mean Lazarus
[1:32:21] came forth sometimes we think well it's
[1:32:23] could be too late for someone it wasn't
[1:32:25] too late for Lazarus so it's not too
[1:32:27] late for them Hallelujah so so this was
[1:32:29] the lamb that he saw raised Lazarus out
[1:32:31] of the Grave this is the Lamb he saw die
[1:32:33] on Calvary this is the Lamb he saw go
[1:32:36] his body put into the tomb this is the
[1:32:38] Lamb he saw that rose out of the Tomb
[1:32:40] Hallelujah you know we were reading we
[1:32:42] you know we're reading through
[1:32:44] the we're reading through the Bible as a
[1:32:46] family at night we pray and we've got to
[1:32:49] Revelations chapter 1 well we started at
[1:32:53] Matthew we just going through the New
[1:32:54] Testament we're going to do the old you
[1:32:55] know and it so gripped me here is the
[1:32:58] Alpha and Omega appears there's the lamb
[1:33:01] that that you know that John saw but now
[1:33:03] he's in his glorified form Supreme deity
[1:33:07] head wide as wool he comes to John and
[1:33:09] it so moved me that same one that came
[1:33:12] to you know John on Patmos is the same
[1:33:14] God that came to me came to you and I
[1:33:16] that same God hallelujah and I just
[1:33:19] prayed Lord the inspiration that the
[1:33:22] scripture was written in May that same
[1:33:24] inspiration fall on us cuz that's what
[1:33:27] we need for it to be fulfilled I me the
[1:33:29] same inspiration that fell on Isaiah a
[1:33:31] virgin shall conceive that same
[1:33:33] inspiration fell on Mary to fulfill that
[1:33:35] prophecy Hallelujah and I pray the same
[1:33:37] inspiration where where the Apostle Paul
[1:33:39] would write amen that there's a there's
[1:33:41] a there's a church there's a bride
[1:33:44] without spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:33:46] thing Hallelujah I pray that inspiration
[1:33:48] would fall upon us where we would
[1:33:50] realize that we're that we are without
[1:33:52] blemish without or wrinkle or any such
[1:33:55] thing because the blood of the Lamb is
[1:33:56] so thoroughly washed us thoroughly
[1:33:59] cleansed us Glory
[1:34:01] Hallelujah Hallelujah so now here he is
[1:34:04] and he sees the lamb step
[1:34:06] forth and he takes the book out of the
[1:34:08] hand of you the one who sat upon the
[1:34:10] throne and then they begin to sing a new
[1:34:13] song so what is John about to experience
[1:34:16] he's about to experiencing he's about to
[1:34:19] experience the third pull the third pull
[1:34:21] is the opening of the word and I've got
[1:34:23] a quote to who support that so this is
[1:34:25] his response to the word
[1:34:28] opening hallelujah amen and so they
[1:34:30] begin to sing a new song thou worthy to
[1:34:32] take the book and to open the seals
[1:34:34] thereof for for thou was slain and has
[1:34:36] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[1:34:39] every Kindred tongue people and nation
[1:34:41] and just from reading that I'd say this
[1:34:43] should be our response when you see the
[1:34:46] lamb take the book for you when he opens
[1:34:49] the word to you this should be your
[1:34:51] response it's not to elevate a
[1:34:54] Doctrine right it's not to elevate even
[1:34:56] a prophet it's to elevate the lamb am
[1:34:59] how remember the message people have
[1:35:01] said we need to get back to the Bible I
[1:35:03] say we've always been in the Bible this
[1:35:05] message you it doveet tales with the
[1:35:07] Scripture it shows us Christ in the
[1:35:09] scripture right so we don't need to get
[1:35:11] back to the Bible we've always been in
[1:35:12] the Bible Well I need an example how we
[1:35:15] how we baptized we're baptized according
[1:35:18] to the scripture amen right amen
[1:35:20] hallelujah yes sir what about the
[1:35:23] godhead we believe it according to the
[1:35:24] scripture what about how we dress we
[1:35:27] dress according to the scripture how we
[1:35:29] treat one another we do it according to
[1:35:31] the
[1:35:32] scripture Hallelujah we anoint the sick
[1:35:35] with oil according to the scripture we
[1:35:37] pray for them according to the scripture
[1:35:38] lay hands upon the sick they shall get
[1:35:40] well according to the scripture amen
[1:35:42] hallelujah we treat one another
[1:35:44] according to the scripture amen so we've
[1:35:46] been in the Bible the whole
[1:35:48] time Hallelujah cuz the message the you
[1:35:51] know the prophet never downplayed the
[1:35:53] Bible he says this is my absolute amen
[1:35:55] he magnified the word of God his desire
[1:35:57] was that the word would be what people
[1:35:59] live
[1:36:00] by Hallelujah yes
[1:36:04] yes so now when John sees this happen he
[1:36:08] begins to
[1:36:09] rejoice and
[1:36:13] behold and then they heard and every
[1:36:15] creature in Heaven and Earth and under
[1:36:17] the Earth heard me saying and in the sea
[1:36:20] blessed and honor and glory and power be
[1:36:21] unto him that sth upon the throne and
[1:36:23] unto the lamb forever and ever so when
[1:36:26] he saw the book and I was so blessed
[1:36:27] when you singing that song brother Isaac
[1:36:29] I thought that's just you know we don't
[1:36:31] plan these things you know other
[1:36:33] churches other churches lay out this is
[1:36:34] what we're going to teach for the next
[1:36:36] six months they actually have a we're
[1:36:37] going to have a theme this year it's
[1:36:39] everything just oh ties in so well well
[1:36:41] of course cuz they plan it we don't have
[1:36:43] a theme hallelujah our theme is the Lord
[1:36:46] Jesus Christ actually but you know we
[1:36:47] don't have a specific you know we're
[1:36:49] going to do this and you know so so here
[1:36:52] was John's response with the book being
[1:36:54] taken he wasn't intellectual about it it
[1:36:58] made him Worship the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:00] the lamb more and more Hallelujah so
[1:37:03] when the word comes open to us what does
[1:37:05] it do makes it worship him more
[1:37:08] Hallelujah he says and the Very this is
[1:37:11] from anointed ones in the end time the
[1:37:13] very day when this
[1:37:15] messenger when he starts on but when he
[1:37:18] begins to declare his message see the
[1:37:20] first poll he healing second Paul
[1:37:22] prophesying third
[1:37:24] the opening of the word so here was the
[1:37:27] here was John experience about to
[1:37:30] experience the opening of the word and
[1:37:32] made him worship the lamb and praise him
[1:37:35] and everything heard him do it
[1:37:37] Hallelujah
[1:37:38] yeah amen so you know we shouldn't be
[1:37:42] quiet about it we should be ourselves
[1:37:44] sure but you know personally I think I'm
[1:37:47] free to shout if I want to shout I'm
[1:37:50] free to be quiet if I want to be quiet I
[1:37:52] feel free to cry I want to cry I feel to
[1:37:55] I feel free to dance if I want to dance
[1:37:57] I'm at Liberty to do anything of those
[1:37:59] things I'm feel free not to do anything
[1:38:01] I'm at Liberty to do all those things
[1:38:03] I'm not oh I don't feel Liberty to do
[1:38:05] this or this I got Li I feel I have
[1:38:06] Liberty to do all those things amen and
[1:38:09] this is I believe we should have we
[1:38:10] should feel Liberty to worship God how
[1:38:13] we feel to worship
[1:38:15] God Amen Let our amens be Y and Amen Let
[1:38:18] It Be True amen hallelujah
[1:38:26] amen now you say well is there really a
[1:38:29] lot to worship about we have a lot to
[1:38:32] praise the Lord about you think about
[1:38:35] you know in Luther's day he he would
[1:38:38] teach that the just shall live by faith
[1:38:40] and that's as far as the people high as
[1:38:41] the people could live now when he would
[1:38:44] teach that he would say that they are
[1:38:45] forgiven right they justified by their
[1:38:48] faith they are righteous they're
[1:38:49] forgiven because they believe but now
[1:38:52] but in this day when the book came open
[1:38:55] justification had a far greater meaning
[1:38:57] right it would mean that we never did it
[1:39:00] in the first place that's right amen so
[1:39:02] it's more than just being forgiven for
[1:39:03] something it's actually no no no you
[1:39:05] never did it in the first place so the
[1:39:07] evidence the actual thing that you did
[1:39:09] doesn't even exist in the mind of God
[1:39:12] hallelujah you think about never doing
[1:39:13] it in the first place now well what was
[1:39:15] the first place the first place was in
[1:39:17] God's mind so how he thought about you
[1:39:20] before the foundation of the world am me
[1:39:22] was rejoicing Made In His Image
[1:39:24] worshiping him Hallelujah that's why he
[1:39:27] would ask job job where were you when I
[1:39:29] laid the foundations of the world and
[1:39:30] the sons of God Morning Star you know
[1:39:33] shouted for joy and he was trying to get
[1:39:35] job to say job you're in this trial you
[1:39:37] don't understand what's going on but
[1:39:39] where were you before this
[1:39:41] happened Hallelujah he say well I'm in
[1:39:43] this real dark place right now where
[1:39:45] were you before that happened Hallelujah
[1:39:48] where were you what is this message
[1:39:50] trying to get us to to see you're from
[1:39:53] God and you go back to him Hallelujah
[1:39:55] that's why you respond to the word the
[1:39:57] way you do because you come from the
[1:39:58] word you are the word right and you're
[1:40:01] going back L Jesus Hallelujah so it
[1:40:03] makes us look at life a whole different
[1:40:05] kind of way Hallelujah he says I've
[1:40:08] always preached that he was deity not
[1:40:10] just a man he was God manifested In the
[1:40:13] Flesh God the attribute of god of love
[1:40:15] the great attributes that come down
[1:40:18] displayed here on Earth of God Jesus was
[1:40:21] God's love which built a body that
[1:40:23] Jehovah himself lived in he was the
[1:40:25] fullness of the god here bodily what God
[1:40:28] was he manifested through that body that
[1:40:31] body had to die so he could wash the
[1:40:33] bride with his blood and notice not only
[1:40:37] is his bride washed forgiven but she is
[1:40:40] Justified see did you ever try the word
[1:40:43] Justified to see what it means for now
[1:40:45] for instance if brother green heard that
[1:40:47] I had been drinking I had been doing bad
[1:40:50] things then he found out that I didn't
[1:40:52] do it then he come and say I forgive you
[1:40:54] brother Bram forgive me I never done it
[1:40:57] what are you forgiving me about see but
[1:41:00] if I'm just guilty then I can be
[1:41:02] forgiven but I'm still um but I'm still
[1:41:06] not just because I did it but the word
[1:41:09] Justified is though you never done it at
[1:41:12] all Justified and when the blood of
[1:41:14] Jesus Christ cleanses us from sin till
[1:41:18] it's put in the book of God's
[1:41:20] forgetfulness he's the only one that can
[1:41:22] do it it we can't we can forgive but not
[1:41:26] forget I could forgive you but I always
[1:41:28] remember You' done evil things then
[1:41:30] you're not just you're forgiven but in
[1:41:32] the sight of God the bride is Justified
[1:41:35] she never done it in the first place
[1:41:38] amen standing there married to The
[1:41:39] Virtuous Son of God never sinned in the
[1:41:41] first place why she was foreordained she
[1:41:44] was trapped into this and now when she
[1:41:47] heard the truth and come forth the blood
[1:41:49] cleansed her and she stands there
[1:41:51] virtuously she has no no sin on her at
[1:41:55] all he says therefore the message calls
[1:41:57] the bride together see the shout this is
[1:41:59] from the Rapture say it's like you never
[1:42:01] done you've never done it in the first
[1:42:02] place Lord so why do we let our guilt of
[1:42:05] our past Hold Us
[1:42:07] Down if it's in the sea of God's
[1:42:10] forgetfulness if God doesn't even
[1:42:12] remember it why should we allow it to be
[1:42:14] held against us remember this walk with
[1:42:18] God is not you the devil and God true
[1:42:21] right the devil has no part in God's
[1:42:23] covenant with you even in the Old
[1:42:25] Testament where it speaks about the
[1:42:27] scapegoat you know how there are two
[1:42:29] goats the blood of one be put on the
[1:42:31] other or be taken out to the Wilderness
[1:42:33] rather all the sins of the people would
[1:42:34] be put upon that goat and be sent into
[1:42:36] the Wilderness that wasn't the devil
[1:42:38] because otherwise the devil were have
[1:42:40] part in Redemption that scapegoat was
[1:42:42] actually Jesus where did he take your
[1:42:44] sins down into hell to be torn apart
[1:42:47] right just like a goat that went out
[1:42:48] into the Wilderness you know there were
[1:42:50] wild animals there things that could you
[1:42:52] know kill it eat it up but the sins of
[1:42:54] the people went upon that goat and he
[1:42:55] carried them away who carried our sins
[1:42:58] away not Satan jesus carried living he
[1:43:02] loved me dying he saved me buried he
[1:43:04] carried my sins far away Rising he
[1:43:07] justified me freely forever one day he's
[1:43:09] coming oh glorious day so he is our
[1:43:12] scapegoat the devil has no part in
[1:43:14] Redemption that's right Hallelujah Jesus
[1:43:16] is our
[1:43:18] scapegoat
[1:43:20] amen
[1:43:21] so there is nothing
[1:43:23] so so that's why I say the devil has no
[1:43:26] part in our relationship with God he's
[1:43:28] not even in the you know he's not even
[1:43:30] in the picture he tries to push himself
[1:43:32] in he said hold on this is not a
[1:43:35] three-way thing this is me and my this
[1:43:38] is me and my Lord and what he says about
[1:43:41] me is all that matters it's not what the
[1:43:43] devil says about me he's called the
[1:43:45] accuser of the Brethren and what does
[1:43:48] that mean he's going to accuse the
[1:43:49] Brethren yeah he's going to go before
[1:43:51] God and say they did this and they
[1:43:55] chatter chatter chatter chatter away
[1:43:57] like a
[1:43:58] chipmunk but then God is actually going
[1:44:00] to say hold on boys get the record books
[1:44:04] out amen you know sometimes you really
[1:44:07] just got to tell the devil to I'll say
[1:44:10] hold on I've got the Talking Stick I
[1:44:12] never gave you the Talking Stick so stop
[1:44:14] talking who's had to do that in their
[1:44:16] family let's have a talking thing I'm
[1:44:18] holding it I can talk now he wants to
[1:44:20] grab it off you know hold on Hallelujah
[1:44:25] amen you know you say Satan shut up
[1:44:29] basically let's get the record book
[1:44:32] let's let's get the record book
[1:44:34] out now let's start talking about you
[1:44:37] you want to put it on me let's put it on
[1:44:40] you so Satan let's turn to the Book of
[1:44:43] Ezekiel do you like that book no I hate
[1:44:45] that book let's find where it says in
[1:44:48] Ezekiel now I put myself on the spot but
[1:44:50] let's try and find in Ezekiel where it
[1:44:52] talks about you
[1:44:53] anointed cherub that
[1:44:55] cover let's go let's go there
[1:44:59] somewhere let's open this up if we can't
[1:45:02] find this one we're going to go to
[1:45:03] Isaiah
[1:45:13] 14 now if I can even find Ezekiel and I
[1:45:15] have tabs help me someone oh I'm looking
[1:45:18] for Ezra that's not what I want
[1:45:26] 284 there we
[1:45:30] go Thou Art the anointed cherub that
[1:45:32] cover here we go Thou Art the anointed
[1:45:35] cherub that cover let's talk about the
[1:45:36] devil because he loves to talk about you
[1:45:38] and your faults yeah but remember he
[1:45:41] doesn't have a blood to fix his faults
[1:45:43] all right Glory he's got nothing to mend
[1:45:45] him it's like something's broken you
[1:45:47] know sometimes the little girls
[1:45:49] sylvanians have broken things like Daddy
[1:45:51] have you got any Superglue to fix it
[1:45:53] sometimes I have sometimes I don't if I
[1:45:55] don't have the superglue it ain't
[1:45:56] getting fixed but if I got the superglue
[1:45:58] it's going to get fixed right and it's
[1:46:00] like the devil ain't got no superglue
[1:46:02] he's got no blood if I can use a real
[1:46:04] kind of silly illustration but he's got
[1:46:06] no blood to fix his
[1:46:08] Brokenness fixes you know bad points but
[1:46:10] we do now Ezekiel
[1:46:14] 28 and he says here in 14 Thou Art the
[1:46:17] anointed let's go from 13 thou has been
[1:46:19] in the Eden um been in Eden the Garden
[1:46:22] of God every precious Stone was thy
[1:46:23] covering the Sardis topaz and the
[1:46:26] diamond the barrel the ANS and the
[1:46:27] Jasper the sapphire the emerald and the
[1:46:29] carbuncle and gold the workmanship of
[1:46:31] thy tabrets and of thy pipes was
[1:46:33] prepared in thee in the day that thou
[1:46:35] was created Thou Art the anointed cherub
[1:46:38] that cover and I have set thee so thou
[1:46:40] was upon the holy mountain of God thou
[1:46:42] Hast walked up and down in the midst of
[1:46:44] the stones of fire thou was perfect in
[1:46:46] thy ways from the from the day that thou
[1:46:48] was created till iniquity was found in
[1:46:50] thee Oh Satan you've got
[1:46:53] iniquity you are you've got iniquity
[1:46:57] remember hey we're reading through the
[1:46:58] record now okay let's see what else you
[1:47:01] have by the multitude of thy merchandise
[1:47:03] thou has filled uh they have filled thee
[1:47:06] with

[1:49:05] this and this and this and he said hold
[1:49:06] on I'm reading about you devil here and
[1:49:10] we can go to um Isaiah 14 but we won't
[1:49:13] okay but now that is that is what the
[1:49:16] devil can I have my slideshow back now
[1:49:18] but so it's good to remind the devil
[1:49:20] actually this is what's in your heart
[1:49:22] devil he saidwell what about me because
[1:49:25] the devil saidwell well hold on what
[1:49:26] about you now the B okay let's just
[1:49:29] start
[1:49:30] here this is what the record says about
[1:49:32] me for he hath made him to be sin for us
[1:49:36] who's that Jesus who knew no sin that we
[1:49:39] might be the righteousness of God in him
[1:49:41] Hallelujah so he became sin for me and
[1:49:43] everyone loves that amen but to believe
[1:49:46] the first part you must believe the
[1:49:48] second part so if he became sin for me
[1:49:50] here's my sin offering Glory
[1:49:53] he didn't know no s he he knew no sin
[1:49:55] but he became my sin offering that we
[1:49:57] might be made the righteousness of God
[1:49:59] in him Hallelujah so if he was my sin
[1:50:02] offering which he was then therefore he
[1:50:04] has made me to be the righteous of God
[1:50:06] in him so I can stand here and say based
[1:50:10] on that I am righteous as God is
[1:50:14] righteous there should have been a big
[1:50:16] resounding hallelujah thank you Jesus
[1:50:18] you said oh that's being proud no no
[1:50:20] this is this is what the Lord's saying
[1:50:22] actually this is the purpose that Jesus
[1:50:23] came and died for me that I become as
[1:50:26] righteous as he is
[1:50:29] righteous
[1:50:36] hallelujah
[1:50:41] amen now if we go
[1:50:46] here this is in the message
[1:50:50] Perfection Christine sh this quote with
[1:50:52] me I thought this is pretty cool if
[1:50:54] there is anything that I can do to make
[1:50:56] myself perfect in the presence of God
[1:50:58] then Christ did not have to die for me
[1:51:02] if there is one thing that I can do that
[1:51:05] would Merit anything in the presence of
[1:51:08] God then Christ died in
[1:51:10] vain no lawke keeping no legalistic
[1:51:14] ideas of yours none of your own Holiness
[1:51:18] no things that you could quit doing so I
[1:51:20] got to quit lying quit stealing quit
[1:51:22] smoking tobacco quit going to the
[1:51:24] picture shows still you are lost nothing
[1:51:27] can do it joining Church's ritual
[1:51:31] ceremonies baptisms orders of the church
[1:51:34] reading of creed saying of prayers all
[1:51:36] those things would count nothing you're
[1:51:38] lost not one thing you can do in
[1:51:40] yourself for you are a sinner under
[1:51:43] condemnation and there's not one way
[1:51:45] within yourself any Creed or anything
[1:51:48] that you could do or think of of
[1:51:50] yourself that could Merit one thing in
[1:51:52] the friends of God because you are a
[1:51:54] sinner to start with you say well that's
[1:51:58] pretty harsh No actually that's good
[1:52:00] thing to know cuz if you know there's
[1:52:02] not one thing you can do for yourself
[1:52:05] then you can call out to the one that
[1:52:06] can do it all for you Hallelujah Jesus
[1:52:10] but I love this if there's anything that
[1:52:12] I can do to make myself perfect myself
[1:52:14] perfect in the sight of God then Christ
[1:52:16] did not have to die for me but he had to
[1:52:19] Die For Me amen if there is one thing
[1:52:21] that I can do that would Merit anything
[1:52:23] in the presence of God then Christ died
[1:52:26] in vain that's why I Rejoice why do you
[1:52:30] rejoice in this because like brother
[1:52:32] Braham said I'd hate to get to heaven on
[1:52:34] my Visions on my preaching on any
[1:52:36] Miracles that were done in the ministry
[1:52:38] I I'd hate to try and get to heaven on
[1:52:40] any of those things I'm only wanting to
[1:52:42] get to heaven because of the blood of
[1:52:44] the Lamb
[1:52:45] am Hallelujah and that should be our
[1:52:48] heart our hearts cry I'm not trying to
[1:52:51] do anything
[1:52:53] to Merit anything in the presence of God
[1:52:55] the only way I Merit anything in the
[1:52:57] presence of God is because he provided a
[1:52:59] way that day on Calvary with a perfect
[1:53:01] lamb hallelujah
[1:53:04] hallelujah amen aren't you glad we got
[1:53:06] nothing to bring to the
[1:53:08] table it's him he he's brought
[1:53:10] everything to the table Hallelujah
[1:53:13] that's why I say Lord I can't do nothing
[1:53:14] you got to come and take me and make me
[1:53:16] your own and that's what he wants to
[1:53:19] do amen
[1:53:27] hallelujah
[1:53:31] amen you say well that kind of leaves me
[1:53:35] in a bit of a No it should we shouldn't
[1:53:38] be proud in anything we do for the lord
[1:53:40] well I do this I dress this way I no no
[1:53:43] no no it it because we know brother
[1:53:45] Braham taught us and and to me it took
[1:53:47] it it takes such a pressure off of
[1:53:49] people works as Faith expressed
[1:53:52] right because it used to be such a big
[1:53:54] weight on the people you've got to do
[1:53:56] enough to to Merit anything right are
[1:54:01] you praying enough are you reading
[1:54:02] enough are you listening enough you know
[1:54:04] and all those things are good but it
[1:54:05] shouldn't be well I've got to do an hour
[1:54:06] of this an hour of this an hour of that
[1:54:08] it should be a
[1:54:09] relationship right right it can be an
[1:54:11] hour it could be five minutes but as
[1:54:13] long as the Lord comes down and does
[1:54:15] something then you just keep walking on
[1:54:17] but it's not about metrics and and
[1:54:19] analytics you know this week you only
[1:54:21] listen to five ser the week before you
[1:54:23] did 5050 oh that's negative whatever
[1:54:25] perc you better pick up your socks
[1:54:27] boying no no no no no it's not anything
[1:54:29] it's it's not that but works as Faith
[1:54:32] Express what the prophet taught us that
[1:54:34] our works is an is an expression of our
[1:54:36] faith Hallelujah you say well then then
[1:54:40] then my Works don't show too much yeah
[1:54:42] but
[1:54:42] but Church in my opinion has made Works
[1:54:46] what they classify as Works they aren't
[1:54:49] the real
[1:54:50] works amen but works is just an
[1:54:53] expression of what you believe so Noah
[1:54:56] Noah believed the world is going to be
[1:54:59] drowned so his Works were on building an
[1:55:01] ark yes right that was his faith
[1:55:04] expressed was the ark being built
[1:55:06] remember Moses after he met the um you
[1:55:09] know the you know the burning bush then
[1:55:11] his works his faith was expressed by his
[1:55:13] Works was getting the people out of
[1:55:14] Egypt but it wasn't him that actually
[1:55:16] delivered them it was God so the same
[1:55:19] thing in our life it's not us that does
[1:55:21] these things it's not us that lives a
[1:55:22] Christian Life every day that's why the
[1:55:25] Apostle Paul said you got to Die daily
[1:55:27] it's not your it's not your nature that
[1:55:29] actually does it it's him but to Die
[1:55:31] daily you got actually yield say Lord
[1:55:33] you come and live in my life today and
[1:55:35] you be the Christian in
[1:55:37] me Hallelujah isn't that isn't that the
[1:55:39] only way to do it he's got to be the
[1:55:40] Christian so we're got to get this
[1:55:42] weight to me this is a devil that sits
[1:55:44] on people you're not doing enough how
[1:55:47] are you ever going to be Rapture Ready
[1:55:48] if you don't do enough no it's what he
[1:55:50] does but it's what I give myself too I
[1:55:53] just give myself to him and he gets me
[1:55:56] ready you following me you know he we
[1:55:59] are his workmanship right if I try and
[1:56:04] subcontract any of me getting Rapture
[1:56:06] Ready off God then he died in vain
[1:56:09] that's right amen oh but this is a big
[1:56:12] project and he says I know it's a big
[1:56:14] project no no you don't understand this
[1:56:17] is a big project I was born in this
[1:56:19] project oh boy yeah he knows that amen
[1:56:22] he doesn't need us to put our 5 cents in
[1:56:25] otherwise it'll become a leaky home and
[1:56:27] you know you know how those things end
[1:56:28] up rotten and moldy right but if he just
[1:56:31] does the
[1:56:33] work Hallelujah everyone's kind of real
[1:56:35] quiet
[1:56:36] today we're going to let him you know
[1:56:39] just yield let the Holy Ghost move let
[1:56:42] him liveen let him have his
[1:56:45] way Lord so I saying works is Faith
[1:56:49] expressed now even Jesus was asked
[1:56:54] when when he is telling them you know
[1:56:55] the only reason you've come to see me is
[1:56:57] because you got a free
[1:56:58] lunch and then he begins to tell them
[1:57:01] labor not for the meat which perisheth
[1:57:03] but for that which meat which endureth
[1:57:06] from unto everlasting life which the son
[1:57:09] of man shall give unto you for him hath
[1:57:12] God the Father sent uh sealed rather you
[1:57:15] know brother BR makes a statement I
[1:57:17] don't have it I don't have it on my
[1:57:18] slides but he says you know I could go
[1:57:20] hunting and fishing for the rest of my
[1:57:22] life life and I'd still be
[1:57:24] there he actually says that he actually
[1:57:27] says that whether you'd say well well
[1:57:30] why didn't he just do that because when
[1:57:33] the Lord comes into someone's life it's
[1:57:36] never about them and what they can get
[1:57:38] out of anything it's always Lord for
[1:57:41] other people amen maybe we'll just
[1:57:44] remind me John
[1:57:47] 6 now Jesus
[1:57:49] would okay I I was going to throw sit
[1:57:52] here before I get
[1:57:53] there you know I think my girls were
[1:57:56] asking about this you know but I have so
[1:57:58] many things I want to
[1:58:01] do now when the Lord meets someone he
[1:58:04] doesn't automattic like like we all have
[1:58:06] desires if you're not married to get
[1:58:08] married if you don't have children to
[1:58:10] have children right if you have children
[1:58:12] you want to have grandchildren one day
[1:58:14] if you don't own a house it' be nice to
[1:58:15] own a house you want to go on holiday
[1:58:17] you know we have all these plans these
[1:58:19] things we'd like to do right cuz it says
[1:58:21] there are many devices in a man's heart
[1:58:24] right but when when when God meets
[1:58:26] someone he doesn't automatically just
[1:58:28] like kill off all those desires that now
[1:58:31] you just want to be a
[1:58:32] monk right he doesn't do that but he
[1:58:35] puts all those things in Balance but
[1:58:38] then people begin to be like like
[1:58:39] children that you know when you're yay
[1:58:41] big you don't necessarily think about
[1:58:43] getting married and having children in
[1:58:45] your career but when you go into a
[1:58:46] teenage then that world opens up to you
[1:58:48] you're like well what am I going to
[1:58:49] study am am I going to go to UNI or and
[1:58:52] what am I going to study am I going to
[1:58:53] do a trade or you know what am I going
[1:58:54] to do and then who am I going to marry
[1:58:56] then so there's all these all these
[1:58:58] things that are in someone begin to come
[1:59:00] out then they get confused but I love
[1:59:02] the Lord but I have a desire to do this
[1:59:04] and you know what but we got to
[1:59:06] understand there's many many devices
[1:59:08] many things in our hearts right I think
[1:59:11] I I believe I have
[1:59:13] the I believe I have the definition for
[1:59:15] that now this word device it means an
[1:59:19] intention or a plan a purpose or a
[1:59:21] thought
[1:59:22] right there's many thoughts or
[1:59:23] intentions or plans in our hearts
[1:59:26] nevertheless the counsel of the Lord
[1:59:27] that shall stand so it's not it doesn't
[1:59:30] mean you're not a Believer if you have a
[1:59:32] desire to to go study something and
[1:59:35] that's pulling you that way but then the
[1:59:37] Lord you know you know the Lord's
[1:59:39] calling you this way or you want to get
[1:59:41] married that's a natural thing who's
[1:59:42] who's following me you know all those
[1:59:44] it's normal God doesn't just kill those
[1:59:47] things off just because you meet them
[1:59:49] and just because you have those those
[1:59:51] desires doesn't mean you don't know him
[1:59:53] right but if you know him you'll put him
[1:59:55] first and you'll prayerfully any
[1:59:58] decision you'll make in life you say
[1:59:59] Lord now I'm not talking about decisions
[2:00:01] about well should I have toast or cereal
[2:00:03] today you know he does actually give us
[2:00:07] choices and if you stay fasting and
[2:00:09] praying about that I don't think it'd be
[2:00:11] a god-given faster of
[2:00:13] prayer God said well I gave you food
[2:00:16] just just eat something that's healthy
[2:00:18] you know but he actually God God doesn't
[2:00:20] make us robots yeah you know who's who's
[2:00:23] thinking ever just shut down because
[2:00:25] they got the Holy Ghost no one's you
[2:00:29] know he actually because remember God
[2:00:30] wants to give us he wants to place us as
[2:00:32] Sons and Daughters of God that what we
[2:00:35] say and what we do and our intentions
[2:00:37] are exactly the same as what he would
[2:00:38] say and do in his intentions right just
[2:00:41] like brother Aram would say about the
[2:00:42] son being adopted into the family the
[2:00:44] father was told by the chudah he's he
[2:00:47] talks like you he he reacts the same way
[2:00:50] as you do you know the the decisions he
[2:00:53] he makes you would have made the same
[2:00:54] decision and now the father says my
[2:00:56] boy's
[2:00:57] ready and he gets adopted that his name
[2:01:01] his name or his his signature on the
[2:01:03] check is as good as the father's because
[2:01:06] the father his heart is in the son his
[2:01:08] mind is in the sun Hallelujah that's
[2:01:11] right so now the son doesn't have to go
[2:01:13] to the father father what should I do
[2:01:14] today no no no the father says the son
[2:01:17] son you know what to do because you got
[2:01:19] my mind you got my heart you've been
[2:01:21] raised Dr you've been cheed right you
[2:01:23] know exactly what to do with my
[2:01:26] word amen so you know but we should
[2:01:32] prayerfully things in life say Lord is
[2:01:35] this the way that I should
[2:01:37] take hallelujah amen now we'll go back
[2:01:41] to John
[2:01:43] 6 so they ask him what shall we do that
[2:01:47] we might work the works of God see cuz
[2:01:50] people say I need to I need the work I
[2:01:53] got to show my faith faith is no works
[2:01:55] is Faith expressed I've got to show my
[2:01:57] faith by my work so what kind of works
[2:01:59] do I do to youo show my faith you
[2:02:01] following me that's what people ask
[2:02:03] because am I doing enough are my Works
[2:02:05] enough are they are they the right kind
[2:02:06] of works are they or am I too slothful
[2:02:09] you know and so they ask
[2:02:11] him what's our work what shall we do
[2:02:15] that we might work the work of God and
[2:02:17] Jesus answered said unto them this is
[2:02:19] the work of God that ye believe on whom
[2:02:22] he hath sent this is actually now you
[2:02:24] want to do you want to know the works
[2:02:25] you're going to do believe on him who he
[2:02:27] has sent Hallelujah but then now I want
[2:02:29] to ask the question because I asked
[2:02:31] myself the question well what does that
[2:02:33] produce because many people say I
[2:02:36] believe Jesus and you
[2:02:38] know all kinds of
[2:02:40] stuff all kinds of stuff they do don't
[2:02:42] do you know so
[2:02:46] now this is the work of God that you
[2:02:49] believe on him who he has
[2:02:50] sent so so now what does that Faith
[2:02:55] produce and John says he came unto his
[2:02:57] own and his own received him not but
[2:03:00] many as received him to them gave he
[2:03:03] power to become the sons of God even to
[2:03:06] them that believe on his name right so
[2:03:09] the work of God is to believe on him who
[2:03:10] he has sent right and then those that he
[2:03:13] would give the power to to become the
[2:03:15] sons of God even to them that believe on
[2:03:18] his name so these ones that believe on
[2:03:20] his name
[2:03:22] he there's a Power released them to
[2:03:24] become the sons of God Amen so now their
[2:03:28] works are going to be the works of the
[2:03:31] sons of God are you all following me I
[2:03:34] want you because remember faith without
[2:03:36] works is
[2:03:37] dead right but but our works is actually
[2:03:40] the works produced in our life should be
[2:03:42] a manifestation of the Holy Ghost should
[2:03:44] be the word becoming flesh right so now
[2:03:47] these ones who believe on whom because
[2:03:49] basically to believe even to them
[2:03:51] believe on his name that's to believe on
[2:03:54] whom he has
[2:03:55] sent yeah this is not mental gymnastics
[2:03:58] this is just how it is right you
[2:03:59] following me so
[2:04:01] now he would give power to them to
[2:04:03] become the sons of God even to them that
[2:04:06] believe on his name so now last night I
[2:04:09] begin to ponder
[2:04:12] well what if I can find it here then
[2:04:16] what would sons of God
[2:04:19] do you think about this are he following
[2:04:21] me and I'm sorry time's up but you know
[2:04:23] what would sons of God do because many
[2:04:26] people say well there you know Sons and
[2:04:29] Daughters of God but but what would Sons
[2:04:31] and Daughters of God do now the main
[2:04:33] thing the Sons and Daughters of God
[2:04:34] would do would take God at his
[2:04:36] word right believe his word accept the
[2:04:39] whole word a real child of God will not
[2:04:43] say that some of this is opinion and
[2:04:44] some of this is God's word that say this
[2:04:47] is the whole word of God right this is
[2:04:49] this is God from cover to cover even you
[2:04:52] know and the cover also you know
[2:04:55] Hallelujah you know this is God in print
[2:04:57] form the whole thing and so Son of God
[2:05:00] will actually acknowledge this is the
[2:05:02] absolute of God right and if it's that
[2:05:04] way if they acknowledge it's not opinion
[2:05:07] but it's God's word they'll say then
[2:05:08] Lord this is how I want I need my life
[2:05:11] to be governed by Your Word because if
[2:05:13] you say well that's just Paul's opinion
[2:05:15] here or that's just for that age cuz the
[2:05:17] culture and this is how it was this is
[2:05:19] why he wrote this no it's for all ages
[2:05:22] am right the Bible tells us that all
[2:05:24] scriptures inspired for Doctrine
[2:05:27] correction reproof that the man of God
[2:05:28] be fully furnished all scripture right
[2:05:31] not just some and then there's SEC well
[2:05:33] you know First Corinthians is just is
[2:05:35] really just second opinions of Paul no
[2:05:38] it's First Corinthians right it's the
[2:05:41] word of God so a Son of God or a
[2:05:44] daughter of God will believe the word of
[2:05:46] God he say well that's pretty Elementary
[2:05:49] but do you realize how powerful is
[2:05:51] actually just to have faith in the word
[2:05:54] of God and actually see it living in
[2:05:56] your life am mean the things you
[2:05:58] actually believe you see it become
[2:05:59] material not we may not have all things
[2:06:01] in possession but we're going to get all
[2:06:04] things in our possession right we may
[2:06:06] not have it all but we're going to have
[2:06:07] it all Hall just like Joshua going into
[2:06:10] the promised land they had a lot of
[2:06:11] places to take but they did take them
[2:06:14] hallelujah amen so now so then what
[2:06:16] would sons of God do well the first
[2:06:18] thing is they would they would receive
[2:06:20] and believe the word
[2:06:22] and then they would become that
[2:06:25] word maybe we'll come this maybe we'll
[2:06:28] approach this another time but see Jesus
[2:06:30] had perfect Faith he had it and it came
[2:06:32] come because he was the word and you
[2:06:35] become the word you become the word as
[2:06:37] you receive the word now I just want to
[2:06:39] say this everything you receive you will
[2:06:41] become yeah yes yes I wanted to be a
[2:06:45] cricket star I wanted to be Denny
[2:06:47] Morrison everyone who knows that kind of
[2:06:50] era when I was yay big that's what I
[2:06:51] wanted to be so I received that so I I
[2:06:55] started to become like that I wanted to
[2:06:57] bowl like him basically take off the
[2:06:58] umpire's head when I was coming in and
[2:07:00] you know some of us brother AR knows
[2:07:03] what I'm talking about but some are
[2:07:05] looking at me blank and you know but I
[2:07:07] received that I I received an image I
[2:07:09] said I want to become this guy and so
[2:07:12] all my everything I did I tried to
[2:07:13] become it and then even I I was growing
[2:07:15] up other things with I want to be this
[2:07:17] guy I want to be this guy so what you
[2:07:20] receive you become yes so you receive
[2:07:23] rap music you'll become a rapper you
[2:07:25] receive punk music or heavy metal music
[2:07:28] or whatever kind of music I don't know
[2:07:30] what kind of music is these days I don't
[2:07:32] care but that kind of music you'll
[2:07:33] become it you know there's spirits on
[2:07:35] different kinds of music Amen brother
[2:07:38] kaidro said you know when gangsters
[2:07:40] would go up before they kill someone
[2:07:41] they listen to rap music they get the
[2:07:43] spirit of murder on that music or or pop
[2:07:46] music is a spirit of lust right or
[2:07:49] country music's got a spirit of
[2:07:50] depression
[2:07:52] Al those spirits come upon you as a what
[2:07:54] because people receive that spirit and
[2:07:56] they become that Spirit but then if
[2:07:58] people receive the spirit of Christ they
[2:08:00] receive the word of God they will become
[2:08:02] the word of God that's why it's so
[2:08:04] important that's why it's never well I
[2:08:06] can't obtain to that it's not what you
[2:08:08] obtain to us what he has done that
[2:08:09] matters hallelujah
[2:08:11] hallelujah amen you be and we become the
[2:08:14] word you become the word as you receive
[2:08:16] the word if you abide in me and my words
[2:08:18] in you my word which this word abides in
[2:08:20] you then ask what you will and it'll be
[2:08:22] done for you see if ye say to this
[2:08:24] mountain be moved don't doubt but
[2:08:26] believe what you've said then you shall
[2:08:28] have what you said when you pray believe
[2:08:30] that you receive that you ask for and
[2:08:34] you shall have it it'll be given to you
[2:08:36] time space nothing else will ever change
[2:08:38] it you know it's done it's already over
[2:08:40] with Hallelujah
[2:08:45] GL now I just want to finish with this
[2:08:49] point and then I'm sorry I've been I've
[2:08:51] been over but I want to finish with this
[2:08:54] point and this and Christian and I were
[2:08:58] talking about this the other day I
[2:08:59] thought this is such a powerful thing
[2:09:02] see Jesus see we go through Gardens of
[2:09:05] Gethsemane and we always normally look
[2:09:07] at the anguish of the decision but never
[2:09:10] what the decision could
[2:09:12] produce so Jesus we think of you know
[2:09:15] Jesus he's in the garden he's praying
[2:09:17] not my will but thy will be done and
[2:09:19] drops of blood like sweat are falling
[2:09:20] off his head and you know great anguish
[2:09:22] and he surrendered his will to the will
[2:09:24] of the father but do you know without
[2:09:26] that we wouldn't have eternal life you
[2:09:28] think of the victory when he laid aside
[2:09:31] himself and actually took the father's
[2:09:34] will above his own human
[2:09:36] will he won salvation for the whole
[2:09:39] world right so often we think oh I've
[2:09:42] got to give this up or I have to stop
[2:09:43] doing this and God's dealing with me to
[2:09:45] quit this and listening to this and quit
[2:09:47] this podcast and quit this Netflix and
[2:09:49] quit all this stuff do you know the do
[2:09:51] you know the power of what could happen
[2:09:53] if you give those things up do you know
[2:09:55] what God would actually fill that space
[2:09:57] and what victories would be one for
[2:09:58] other people if you actually give those
[2:10:00] things up Lord so you say well this is
[2:10:02] an extreme case yeah but you know you
[2:10:04] could have the same he won the victory
[2:10:06] for you and I right there hallelujah
[2:10:09] amen because he said not my will but thy
[2:10:11] will be done but what if he held on to
[2:10:12] his Humanity he said actually I like my
[2:10:14] disciples I don't want to die I don't
[2:10:16] want to go through this well where would
[2:10:18] we be we would be men and women most
[2:10:22] miserable and the devil would have it
[2:10:25] all but he actually decided he won
[2:10:28] because he put us before himself he won
[2:10:31] the victory for others and that's why
[2:10:34] you got to look you know the devil wants
[2:10:36] you to look at this little world that
[2:10:37] you can create and live in this little
[2:10:39] thing and oh it's too much to give up
[2:10:43] but in reality if you give it up what
[2:10:45] kind of Victory can be won not just for
[2:10:47] yourself but for everyone else around
[2:10:49] you Hallelujah amen you think about a
[2:10:52] church that's fully sold out to
[2:10:55] God fully sold out God just moves in the
[2:10:59] mid Sanctified life that's dedicated to
[2:11:02] God and God just lives through that
[2:11:04] person the kind of atmosphere that's
[2:11:06] around that person the victories that
[2:11:08] happen because you know because God
[2:11:10] living in that person's life what if
[2:11:11] they decided actually no no I don't want
[2:11:13] to live that kind of
[2:11:15] life you think about any one of us who
[2:11:19] actually decided in the past actually no
[2:11:21] no no I'm not going to walk with
[2:11:23] god what would be missing in this church
[2:11:26] what victories would not have been won
[2:11:29] because one of us decided Well no I'm
[2:11:31] actually no I don't want to live that
[2:11:32] kind of life or maybe I'll be
[2:11:34] wishy-washy and maybe this but you know
[2:11:36] what if what if any one of us didn't
[2:11:39] make that
[2:11:40] decision this church wouldn't be what it
[2:11:43] is amen Camp wouldn't have been what it
[2:11:46] was the services we have wouldn't be
[2:11:47] what they
[2:11:49] are amen you you see the ramifications
[2:11:52] of our
[2:11:54] choice because it's not it's not about
[2:11:57] us we say well I'm going through it yeah
[2:11:59] but it's actually for others think of
[2:12:01] the ripple effect think of the ripple
[2:12:04] effect of just these words not my
[2:12:06] will father if thou be willing remove
[2:12:08] this cup from me nevertheless not my
[2:12:10] will but thy will be done think of the
[2:12:11] Ripple effects of just those words of
[2:12:14] that
[2:12:15] decision Jesus would say and for their
[2:12:18] sakes I sanctify myself that they also
[2:12:21] might be Sanctified through the truth so
[2:12:24] he says for for thy for their sakes not
[2:12:27] for my sake for their sakes Lord I
[2:12:30] sanctify myself remember Jesus he could
[2:12:33] have got married he could have had
[2:12:34] children he could have done all kinds of
[2:12:36] things but he said I'm going to sanctify
[2:12:39] my I'm going to live this kind of life
[2:12:41] I'm going to Forfeit my right to do
[2:12:42] those things that they would be
[2:12:46] Sanctified you know we can get in such a
[2:12:49] little world that we just look at our
[2:12:50] own four walls
[2:12:51] of our own little life and we forget the
[2:12:55] effect that we have on other people both
[2:12:58] positive and negative what if we just
[2:13:00] had a purpose Lord I want to live a kind
[2:13:02] of a life that would just be for the
[2:13:04] positive hallelujah amen isn't that a
[2:13:07] powerful thing I
[2:13:10] think amen what's that got to do with
[2:13:12] taking out Giants what if David didn't
[2:13:15] decide to take off Goliath's head that's
[2:13:17] right yeah oh yeah wouldn't have what we
[2:13:20] have
[2:13:22] you know okay forgive me but we're got
[2:13:26] to make way for
[2:13:28] Liberty you know when they when the
[2:13:31] austrians we'll just leave this you know

[2:13:34] Switzerland you know when the austrians

[2:13:39] wall and they decided the Swiss were

[2:28:13] head for me
[2:28:16] [Music]
[2:28:20] I was
[2:28:21] lost and
[2:28:24] undone without
[2:28:27] God for
[2:28:30] his when he
[2:28:32] R down
[2:28:39] his
[2:28:45] hallu bless
[2:28:50] [Music]
[2:28:58] when I left home I didn't know that I
[2:28:59] was going to give a
[2:29:01] testimony but as we were singing the
[2:29:04] song that
[2:29:06] says I'm no longer a slave to
[2:29:10] fear
[2:29:12] for quite some time now that song has
[2:29:15] been so meaningful to
[2:29:18] me and as was singing something kept on
[2:29:22] say you know what there might still be
[2:29:24] someone who is a slave to
[2:29:27] fear won't you just
[2:29:30] share how you overcame
[2:29:34] amen but I felt you know what my
[2:29:39] testimony has got a lot of things that
[2:29:42] might not sit well with others how do
[2:29:45] you give a testimony where you're
[2:29:47] talking about seeing demons how how do
[2:29:50] you give
[2:29:51] testimony that has got witchcraft in it
[2:29:54] where you
[2:29:56] overcame then I'm like no I
[2:29:59] cannot actually my my my my my first
[2:30:02] option was maybe when I stand there I'll
[2:30:04] ask the brothers to just switch off and
[2:30:07] not be
[2:30:09] online then I'm like but what if the
[2:30:12] person who needs to hear this is
[2:30:14] actually
[2:30:15] online then I realized that it's fear
[2:30:18] again trying to creep in
[2:30:21] reasoning then when the pastor is
[2:30:23] preaching he's talking about demons he's
[2:30:26] talking about killing the Giants he's
[2:30:29] talking about faith right then I was
[2:30:33] like well I didn't know that he was
[2:30:37] going to preach about those things which
[2:30:40] is some of the things that I wanted to
[2:30:41] testify
[2:30:43] overcoming
[2:30:44] so it is okay let me talk you see as a
[2:30:49] child grow growing up I grew up in a
[2:30:52] Christian
[2:30:53] family my mom was a prayer Warrior who
[2:30:57] always prayed for me and as a child you
[2:31:01] go to church with your mom you don't
[2:31:02] really see how much fight is going on in
[2:31:07] the spirit I remember one morning I was
[2:31:11] I think six she called me just before I
[2:31:13] went out going to school she said to me
[2:31:17] I had a dream as she you get out of this
[2:31:20] gate as you walk someone from that
[2:31:23] family is going to quickly come out with
[2:31:25] with an orange to give you don't take it
[2:31:28] if you take it you're
[2:31:30] dead and being me I always listen to my
[2:31:33] mom as I walked out someone came running
[2:31:37] with an
[2:31:38] orange what made me to even believe my
[2:31:40] mom mom was more was that he was holding
[2:31:43] an orange like this but the finger was
[2:31:46] inside the
[2:31:48] orange and he tried to give it to me I
[2:31:51] said no thanks he said my mom said I
[2:31:54] must give you I said no my mom said I
[2:31:57] mustn't take
[2:31:58] it then he threw it down opened it fill
[2:32:02] scent in it put it upside down stamped
[2:32:04] on it so that no one can take
[2:32:06] it and the others were asking him how
[2:32:11] can you do that such a
[2:32:13] waste then he said no my mom said I must
[2:32:16] give it to him I mean to her and if no
[2:32:20] one takes it no one must eat
[2:32:22] it then when I came back I told my mom
[2:32:26] she couldn't stop praising God because
[2:32:28] that was only a way of protecting me
[2:32:31] that was a protection from God then you
[2:32:34] grow up your mom praying for you you
[2:32:38] just think being a Christian is just a
[2:32:40] very easy thing nothing much happened
[2:32:43] then my mom passed on when I was 25 by
[2:32:46] then I had my own
[2:32:48] family still while I was married while I
[2:32:51] was an adult she was still praying for
[2:32:53] me I lived through her
[2:32:56] prayers now I am there alone I still
[2:33:00] carry on with my life the way I Carri it
[2:33:02] on I'm a Christian but a very
[2:33:06] Shon then you start hitting
[2:33:09] things that's when you realize that
[2:33:12] demons actually do
[2:33:16] exist there were times where I would be
[2:33:19] lyed down on my
[2:33:21] bed I would literally be in a state
[2:33:24] where I'm not fast asleep I'm not awake
[2:33:27] then I see the demons coming
[2:33:29] in you're praying but your prayer does
[2:33:33] not
[2:33:35] have that it it's not backed up by faith
[2:33:39] you are praying with fear so you cannot
[2:33:42] overcome when you've got
[2:33:45] fear and I Liv alive where at some point
[2:33:48] I would say you know what devil I know
[2:33:51] this is you point number one and I know
[2:33:54] you cannot do anything to my soul so you
[2:33:57] know what go ahead do what you want to
[2:34:00] do I'm just going to turn and
[2:34:03] sleep literally I would do that and I
[2:34:05] would hear this thing coming and sitting
[2:34:07] on my back and just
[2:34:09] relaxing and I would be like if that's
[2:34:12] what you want to do go ahead but later
[2:34:14] in life when I look I realize that you
[2:34:16] know what sometimes we walk with
[2:34:18] diseases we let them control Our Lives
[2:34:22] we become moody people we let those
[2:34:25] moods control Our Lives we walk with all
[2:34:29] kinds of things that the devil brings to
[2:34:33] us we just accept them and said this is
[2:34:36] me this is a way of life no that is
[2:34:39] being a shallow Christian amen you don't
[2:34:41] do that you need to learn to be an
[2:34:45] overcomer so at some point it came to a
[2:34:50] realization that no you cannot carry on
[2:34:52] like this you cannot live a life where
[2:34:55] you know that when I go to sleep whether
[2:34:58] it's during the day or whether it's at
[2:35:00] night the demons are going to attack and
[2:35:02] then either I'm going to pray and
[2:35:03] they'll go or I'll try to pray then they
[2:35:07] don't go then I just give up and
[2:35:10] sleep then I said
[2:35:13] Lord you are the one who created
[2:35:17] everything that means even the demons
[2:35:20] you created yes and they've got more
[2:35:23] experience than I do they've been there
[2:35:26] for more than 2,000 years I was not
[2:35:28] there so as I'm going to sleep I'm going
[2:35:31] to pray that you come and fight for me
[2:35:36] because on my own I cannot do it that's
[2:35:39] when I started living a life of an
[2:35:41] overcome realizing that on my own I
[2:35:43] cannot do it but my God can come and
[2:35:47] surround the yarden my God can come time
[2:35:49] and be in each and every room amen and
[2:35:52] protect each and every one of us but the
[2:35:55] devil does not give up then all those
[2:35:57] demonic attacks stopped because now I
[2:35:59] commit everything to him and say Lord
[2:36:01] just come because I
[2:36:03] know well you know if you you you've
[2:36:08] tried your best to live a Christian Life
[2:36:11] he's not going to come and let you think
[2:36:14] about going to a bar because that one
[2:36:17] you've passed already he's not going to
[2:36:19] try and let you think about cigarettes
[2:36:21] you don't even know how to smoke a
[2:36:23] cigarette he's going to come on another
[2:36:25] level so that's why he was just trying
[2:36:27] to torment me but then seeing that now
[2:36:30] that was overcome he would try and bring
[2:36:33] maybe a disease or
[2:36:35] something so 2018 just before we came
[2:36:38] here I went for an OP so that solved all
[2:36:41] the problem that were there it's fine
[2:36:43] but then about two or 3 weeks ago I was
[2:36:46] supposed to wake up I was working at
[2:36:48] home
[2:36:50] and then suddenly I couldn't walk I
[2:36:52] couldn't turn that way or that way or
[2:36:54] move out of
[2:36:55] bed
[2:36:57] then we are human beings you forget that
[2:37:02] this is an attack you think I am sick I
[2:37:06] laid down there I said I'm sick everyone
[2:37:08] is getting up trying to get ready to go
[2:37:09] to school and all that then something
[2:37:12] said no you are not sick you are being
[2:37:15] attacked by the
[2:37:17] devil then I said Lord
[2:37:20] you are the Creator and you created
[2:37:23] me and the pain that I'm feeling is from
[2:37:27] an OP that happened two years
[2:37:30] ago is when you check medically they'll
[2:37:33] tell you when the
[2:37:34] nerves
[2:37:36] get operated on they can then try and
[2:37:39] later send messages to the brain that
[2:37:41] say I'm mean pain then the pain is ex
[2:37:43] exaggerated but that's medical terms but
[2:37:46] here I'm seeing the devil trying to
[2:37:48] attack now now God you created me you
[2:37:51] created the devil now devil my God is
[2:37:55] greater than you won't you please just
[2:37:57] pack your BS and
[2:38:00] go and I stood up I thought I was
[2:38:04] dreaming there was not a single pain
[2:38:07] took the first step I could walk second
[2:38:09] step I could walk I went and brushed my
[2:38:12] teeth when I got to the kitchen my
[2:38:14] husband is like how are you feeling he's
[2:38:15] like I'm I'm saying to him no I'm fine
[2:38:18] he's looking at me
[2:38:20] I said I'm fine said but I left you in
[2:38:23] pain I said the devil just
[2:38:26] left then a few days later I can't
[2:38:29] remember it was a headache that was
[2:38:31] trying to come I said no the same way
[2:38:34] that you left a few days ago just pick
[2:38:36] and go because my God has created you
[2:38:40] and this is not your territory am try
[2:38:44] elsewhere then I realized that you know
[2:38:46] what there might be someone who needs an
[2:38:49] upliftment who needs an
[2:38:51] encouragement that you know what as
[2:38:53] Christians let's live an overcoming life
[2:38:57] and that can only be through faith not
[2:38:59] fear hence I'm saying I'm no
[2:39:03] longer a
[2:39:05] slave to
[2:39:08] fear I am a
[2:39:12] child of
[2:39:16] God I'm no longer
