[0:03] this song is called
[0:05] let god live and i wrote it earlier this
[0:08] year
[0:09] in june
[0:13] and some of the inspiration for it was
[0:15] um you know when
[0:16] in the bible when he talks about shame
[0:18] go and he
[0:20] planted his his fruit every season and
[0:23] then the philistines would come
[0:24] every season to steal his fruit but then
[0:26] eventually one year he just thought
[0:29] i can't do it but he cried out to the
[0:31] lord and says right now i'm going to
[0:33] stand against that enemy
[0:35] and then he just walked in that it just
[0:37] let the lord come
[0:38] and work through him and with that with
[0:40] that jawbone he just slayed all those
[0:42] philistines and they no longer
[0:45] came to destroy his land anymore for him
[0:47] and his family
[0:49] and that was part of the inspiration for
[0:51] the song
[0:52] and then also where brother brenham
[0:54] talks about the greatest battle ever
[0:56] ford
[0:57] is in the mind and then um i think it
[1:00] might have been
[1:00] been mentioning that right here you know
[1:02] like where the no man's land is
[1:05] is where the final enemy will be you
[1:08] know dealt with
[1:09] and that when when we have overcome that
[1:12] we have the final victory you know then
[1:15] so that was the inspiration for the song
[1:25] there are times of trouble and despair
[1:29] [Music]
[1:30] so many burdens to bear
[1:33] [Music]
[1:35] but i've learned to put my trust in god
[1:40] and let god live
[1:46] let god live
[1:49] let him live in me let go
[1:54] having the victory i open
[1:57] my heart to the things of god
[2:01] and let god live
[2:07] in the greatest battle ever for
[2:12] the enemy surrounds me like a flood
[2:17] i will let the lord raise the standard
[2:22] and let god live
[2:28] let god live
[2:31] let him live in me let go
[2:37] [Music]
[2:49] now i walk in perfect victory
[2:53] [Music]
[2:54] knowing jesus has come and set me free
[3:00] and i claim every promise off
[3:04] his word and let god
[3:11] let god
[3:14] let him live in me let
[3:18] god live having the victory
[3:21] i open my heart to the things of god
[3:27] and let god
[3:33] and let god
[3:38] and let god
[3:47] you
