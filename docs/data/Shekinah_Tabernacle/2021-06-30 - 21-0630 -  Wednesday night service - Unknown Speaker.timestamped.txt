[29:21] thank you musicians brother martian is a
[29:25] likable person
[29:27] i don't know if that's just me maybe i'm
[29:29] biased towards him but i just like the
[29:30] guy
[29:32] he is a yeah he's like
[29:36] likeable people can sort of do anything
[29:37] and get away with it you know
[29:40] isn't that the truth you know after a
[29:41] likeable guy
[29:46] i drove down the driveway the other day
[29:49] and i don't know if you know marion
[29:50] lives behind our place and he parks the
[29:53] van down the bottom
[29:55] and he's got some little scheme he has
[29:56] to do to swap vehicles each morning
[29:59] and i'm not sure what happened but in
[30:01] the middle of this paddock
[30:03] there's like it's like some young
[30:04] fellow's been out there doing burnouts
[30:05] all through this paddock it's just
[30:07] it's like a mud pit and he he said i
[30:09] apologize bro i may have dug in up the
[30:11] ground a bit down there
[30:14] i don't know how so i'm still here to
[30:17] determine how a vehicle got to that
[30:19] particular spot
[30:21] but he's such a likable guy i just had a
[30:23] laugh about it you know i saw all the
[30:24] skid marks and i just imagine marion in
[30:26] there trying to get his vehicle out of
[30:28] this
[30:28] all this mud
[30:32] praise the lord praise the lord that we
[30:34] can like people that we can have love in
[30:36] our hearts for people
[30:37] you know we would be if we couldn't
[30:38] express love to people
[30:40] how what an awful life that would be
[30:42] that we couldn't
[30:44] just love you know it's a lot nicer more
[30:46] enjoyable to love
[30:47] even though you might be going through a
[30:51] hard battle it's easier to love
[30:53] because the outcome is always better so
[30:55] it's easier just to love
[30:57] it's not what your flesh wants to do but
[30:59] when you just try it and do it
[31:01] the outcome is very good you know and
[31:04] and
[31:05] is that just the tone yen in the
[31:06] background in there it is
[31:09] hello
[31:14] sorry to interrupt my trade before but i
[31:15] didn't see you there praise the lord
[31:18] so tonight is um i've got just a small
[31:21] thought because tonight is actually a
[31:22] pre-meeting so this is like a 20 minute
[31:24] little sermon at 15 20 minutes so i'm
[31:27] it's um
[31:28] it's only a very very simple thought
[31:29] tonight so we're just going to speak
[31:31] about this and then
[31:32] we're going to go into prayer and i i
[31:35] there are scriptures coming up but they
[31:36] aren't right now so we just we can start
[31:38] already with this and
[31:42] i just had a funny word on my heart
[31:45] which was the table i had always got
[31:47] this little word coming back to me
[31:49] called the table and
[31:52] you know the table is quite a
[31:54] significant place when we think about it
[31:55] we all have some connection to
[31:59] i'm going to call it the table the table
[32:01] is generally a place in your home where
[32:02] you sit down and eat
[32:04] and generally speaking most people eat
[32:08] i've got a you know there's a simple
[32:10] motto in life eat or die
[32:14] that's pretty much one of there are very
[32:16] few things that if you don't do it you
[32:18] die anything is one of them so
[32:19] it's common to mankind we all eat you
[32:21] know and i'm so happy how the lord has
[32:23] made food isn't food a wonderful thing
[32:25] you know people that think that this is
[32:27] a mistake that we're all just
[32:28] here by chance and that we just evolved
[32:31] and
[32:32] it all just happened to happen is beyond
[32:34] me how you could think that
[32:36] when even you think about food and the
[32:37] flavors in food
[32:39] you can have different foods they have
[32:40] different flavors and you can mix
[32:41] different flavors together and you eat
[32:42] it and it just
[32:43] tastes so good but even that in itself
[32:46] the fact we can experience food
[32:48] and flavors it's such an enjoyable thing
[32:52] and and um
[32:57] there's a place called the table at home
[32:58] that that it's a significant place in
[33:01] the home it's probably
[33:02] the place where we probably spend
[33:05] as a as a group as a family as the
[33:07] people in the home you would gather
[33:08] around the table probably more so than
[33:10] any other place in the house like you
[33:12] wouldn't all gather in somebody's
[33:13] bedroom or
[33:14] you gather in the lounge now and then
[33:16] but you know you always kind of
[33:17] everyone at some point gets hungry and
[33:18] they need to eat so they they have to
[33:20] end up back at the table
[33:21] to to eat that so it's quite a
[33:23] significant place the table
[33:27] i just want to talk about food for a
[33:28] little bit because i was talking to
[33:30] brother andy
[33:31] when we were driving in the car the
[33:32] other day
[33:34] and i've had this thought lately about
[33:37] it's amazing how quickly how people will
[33:40] sell out for money
[33:42] for for not so much money but a little
[33:43] bit of gain
[33:45] when you think about it
[33:48] not everyone has a low selling point but
[33:50] but
[33:52] it's a flaw of mankind that we will sell
[33:54] out for gain
[33:55] we we will we will forget about
[33:59] our principles if there's money in it
[34:02] you think i know i won't all you people
[34:04] won't but
[34:06] i'll give you an example if i could use
[34:08] an extreme example
[34:10] then i'll use an extreme one just to
[34:11] really get a point across
[34:14] i'll talk about food shortly but i want
[34:16] to say this if i told you
[34:18] could you or the general public would
[34:21] just talk about the general public right
[34:22] if i said could you go and
[34:25] murder somebody for me most people would
[34:27] say no
[34:29] maybe one not one odd person
[34:31] psychopathic person
[34:33] may say yes i'll just go and do it
[34:34] because that's you know we have those
[34:35] people in society right but
[34:37] but most of us would think that's the
[34:38] wrong thing to do
[34:40] right now if i said to you okay i've got
[34:42] a hundred dollars here if you just go
[34:44] and
[34:45] deal to this guy still probably not a
[34:49] lot of people would do it but there may
[34:50] be one one extra person other than the
[34:52] person that would just go and do it for
[34:52] farmingdale for a hundred dollars
[34:56] this is reality right now if i still
[34:57] give you thousand dollars i might get
[34:58] another two takers
[35:00] if i got up to like 100 million and and
[35:02] look no one's going to know it's just
[35:03] going to keep it all under
[35:04] under wraps 100 million dollars here's
[35:06] the cashier if you just sort that out
[35:08] how many people you think that would put
[35:09] their hand up and
[35:11] how many people would entertain that
[35:12] thought for 100 million dollars oh
[35:16] let me think about that you know now
[35:20] see that i like brother ben because he's
[35:23] honest
[35:27] but hey many many people would entertain
[35:29] that thought oh it's 100 million dollars
[35:30] you know
[35:31] maybe the guy's a bad guy he has
[35:33] probably deserves it you know
[35:35] you know but that's
[35:39] and that's why the bible says the love
[35:40] of money is the root of all evil
[35:43] because it's it's that it's when we want
[35:46] to gain something
[35:47] everyone slowly has a sellout point that
[35:49] they will sell out
[35:51] a principal that i don't murder they
[35:53] will sell it out at some
[35:54] point for money except for the lord he
[35:57] was offered the whole world
[35:59] here take the whole world all you gotta
[36:00] do is bow down and worship me not
[36:02] interested
[36:04] that's the keeping power of a christian
[36:06] we we won't sell out but
[36:09] but back to a more wholesome subject of
[36:12] food
[36:12] it's unfortunate now that
[36:15] if you look at the way that mankind has
[36:17] become
[36:20] man has done evil to other men by
[36:22] producing a product
[36:23] that they know is bad for them and
[36:25] they're selling it to them to make a bit
[36:26] of money
[36:27] it's an evil thing it's evil it
[36:29] shouldn't actually
[36:31] someone's conscience should say i don't
[36:33] want to manufacture a product that i
[36:35] know is going to kill
[36:36] people and do them serious harm to their
[36:38] body right
[36:40] because you look at the health of
[36:42] mankind is deteriorated and it's
[36:44] solely based on what we eat solely based
[36:47] on what we eat
[36:49] what we put into our body because what
[36:50] you put in produces it makes it what it
[36:52] is
[36:53] and and food manufacturing companies are
[36:56] sitting around
[36:58] and they're devising plans to get their
[36:59] product into people
[37:01] and they will come up with any scheme
[37:04] and if they and
[37:05] if they prosper they think i'm wise i'm
[37:07] smart
[37:09] and yet they are they are operating
[37:12] something that's harming
[37:14] mankind someone in the room should stand
[37:16] up and say look guys
[37:17] we're all a bunch of crooks here you
[37:19] know these board meetings
[37:21] let's let's address the elephant in the
[37:22] room guys this product is killing people
[37:24] we're all a bunch of crooks
[37:26] we just should shut down this whole
[37:27] business and not sell it this stuff
[37:29] anymore
[37:32] that's what they should do if you're if
[37:33] you were god in head principles you'd
[37:35] say shut the business down but it's
[37:37] making so much money there's so many
[37:38] jobs i don't care
[37:39] shut it down we're destroying people you
[37:41] think they will
[37:42] no because there's money involved and
[37:45] and we'll
[37:46] we'll gloss over it and think we're okay
[37:48] and we'll all be involved in it too you
[37:50] know because there's money involved oh
[37:51] well
[37:51] it's the i just work for the company
[37:55] that's the reality of this guys that's
[37:57] how this whole that's what keeps this
[37:58] world going
[37:59] is the desire for more
[38:04] and it's an evil thing don't even let
[38:05] don't ever get like that you know
[38:07] be willing to follow the lord and just
[38:10] follow him no matter what don't don't
[38:11] sell out for nothing
[38:13] don't sell out brother brown many times
[38:15] was offered a lot of money
[38:17] here's a whole lot of money he didn't
[38:19] take it and we're the same
[38:21] we're the same back to food
[38:25] so we have now the table and it's
[38:28] there's a
[38:31] the natural types are spiritual because
[38:34] at our natural table now we've got
[38:36] not we've got there's a whole lot of
[38:39] junk ends up on our natural table these
[38:41] days when we go
[38:41] when we sit down to eat sometimes we're
[38:44] just forced to because there's actually
[38:45] not very much else on offer you know
[38:47] you try and eat good it's very very hard
[38:49] it takes a lot of effort to
[38:51] try and get something half decent you
[38:53] know that's that's where we're at it's
[38:55] it takes a lot of effort to get
[38:56] something decent
[38:57] and unfortunately it's like that in the
[38:58] spiritual too that there's a lot of
[39:01] there's the spiritual realm is now
[39:03] filled with junk just
[39:04] junk and it's very hard to not taken
[39:08] junk
[39:09] like i'll i'll give you some reality on
[39:11] it like like brother branham said oh if
[39:14] i ever had a tv in my home i'd blast it
[39:16] out with a shotgun who's
[39:17] who's heard that quote right so we walk
[39:20] around with tvs
[39:23] there's reality i don't hate to bring
[39:25] jesse up in the summer but jesse says to
[39:26] me dad i want to get a phone
[39:30] and so i've switched around lately
[39:32] because i'm like oh so okay i'll get
[39:34] your phone
[39:35] so you want the phone that can phone
[39:37] somebody and maybe send the text that's
[39:38] the phone
[39:39] there's probably phones that can just do
[39:41] that i'll get you one of those sorry
[39:42] buddy but
[39:44] it's not about you man i'm just saying
[39:45] this as an example oh no i want a real
[39:47] phone
[39:49] no oh you mean you want a tv so after a
[39:52] tv or a phone
[39:53] because the phone is what you ring
[39:54] people with this this is the tv you know
[39:56] you watch
[39:57] you watch tv on this you know
[40:00] but you see it's just it's hard to
[40:03] get and operate in life without getting
[40:07] junk in you everywhere you go
[40:09] you know there's that it's it's just
[40:11] very hard it's very hard to live
[40:13] live i'm not saying it as an excuse but
[40:15] it's very hard to live wholesomely
[40:16] just like it is to get wholesome food
[40:18] every day you have to make a very very
[40:20] big effort to get wholesome food every
[40:22] day
[40:22] you can't just go to the usual places it
[40:24] doesn't really work like that
[40:25] you go to the fruit and veggie
[40:27] department and pack and save it's all
[40:28] full of pesticides so if you really want
[40:30] to get healthy
[40:31] sometimes eating that stuff is as bad as
[40:33] eating like a processed food it's got so
[40:35] many pesticides in it that is slowly
[40:37] killing us you know it's but
[40:40] and the spiritual has become the same
[40:42] you know we
[40:43] what when we go to our table our
[40:46] spiritual table you know
[40:47] as humans it's it's slowly it's
[40:50] deteriorating
[40:52] what we have to our intake is that all
[40:54] right to say that
[40:55] i need a tissue bro i've got a runny
[40:56] nose sorry
[40:58] oh thank you just
[41:06] the next one up please
[41:10] so here we have a table
[41:13] and this is a natural table but you know
[41:15] we have a spiritual table as well we've
[41:16] got
[41:17] the the natural always types of
[41:19] spiritual this place where we meet and
[41:20] we
[41:21] we get sustenance for life you know this
[41:22] we go to the table in it
[41:24] and we get to we eat
[41:28] and we try and eat as well as we can and
[41:31] a lot of things happen around the table
[41:32] go to the next one
[41:36] i want to read this because i want to
[41:38] just segue this just a little bit
[41:41] and may as you give this is brother adam
[41:43] speaking as you gave the vision some two
[41:45] years ago to store up the food find
[41:46] healthy looking vegetables that i saw in
[41:48] the vision
[41:49] being stored here in this tabernacle may
[41:50] we today receive a whole barrel full of
[41:52] that
[41:52] granted lord or a tape load that it
[41:54] might reveal jesus christ to us
[41:56] in the hour that we live to give us
[41:58] sustaining strength the spiritual
[42:00] strength for the task that laser head
[42:01] granted father
[42:04] so now we're now going to just talk
[42:06] about spiritual food
[42:10] i think the lord the lord foresaw the
[42:12] situation that we would be in
[42:14] we're all around us is just there's all
[42:16] these pesticides and everything is just
[42:18] infested with
[42:19] things that that the lord actually made
[42:21] an effort
[42:23] the lord made an effort well he still
[42:26] could to actually provide us with some
[42:27] nice wholesome organic
[42:29] pure food that we could actually live on
[42:31] and be sustained by
[42:34] and and that's what the lord has
[42:38] blessed us with to serve at our table as
[42:40] the wholesome word of god
[42:42] and the the revealed word of god for
[42:45] this age
[42:46] and in his brother brown saw the vision
[42:49] and it was store up all this food so
[42:51] that
[42:51] we now can actually go to the table of
[42:54] the lord and eat some
[42:55] wholesome food we don't have to you know
[42:58] we
[42:58] hopefully we get more of that than all
[43:00] this junk
[43:02] this junk everything that's all around
[43:04] us you know imagine if we didn't have
[43:05] this wholesome food to feed on
[43:08] where would our spiritual state be you
[43:10] know
[43:13] imagine if you couldn't find wholesome
[43:14] natural food if it was if you just had
[43:15] to buy all this processed stuff you
[43:17] would
[43:17] mankind is eventually going to just die
[43:21] die naturally that will actually kill
[43:23] them and it's spiritually it's the same
[43:24] we just the the
[43:26] the diet of the the spiritual diet of
[43:28] human beings is causing the minds to
[43:30] actually die
[43:31] like not work properly it's not designed
[43:34] the mind isn't designed to have their
[43:37] stuff the mind is designed to have the
[43:38] word of god the pure word of god fit
[43:40] into it and
[43:40] thrive on that that's that's what it
[43:42] needs so
[43:45] this is one thing that we get from the
[43:46] table of the lord is we've got his
[43:50] we've been there's been food stored up
[43:52] to serve at his
[43:53] at his table for us so there's a call it
[43:55] a banquet of all this
[43:58] he saw healthy looking vegetables
[44:02] who likes healthy vegetables you all
[44:04] have to put your hand up now
[44:05] yeah he didn't see like soda
[44:09] you didn't get a vision of fizzy drink
[44:10] or chips when you saw the vision you
[44:12] just saw these wholesome
[44:13] these healthy vegetables you know
[44:16] because it's because it's not tainted by
[44:17] man
[44:18] you know man can take all these
[44:19] different ingredients and mix everything
[44:20] together
[44:21] and and it might taste nice but it's not
[44:23] good for you
[44:25] but the way god designed a piece of food
[44:27] he's like his his fruit his vegetables
[44:29] his natural products
[44:30] he's specifically designed to that we
[44:32] can have it and it works well in our
[44:33] body and it just
[44:34] sustains us and this the pure word of
[44:36] god is exactly the same it's just
[44:37] it's not tampered with it's just fresh
[44:39] off the the tree of god
[44:41] and the tree of life and we just eat it
[44:42] from the tree of life just nice and
[44:44] fresh
[44:45] wholesome this is not a this is not
[44:48] a talk about food you eat it's just for
[44:50] the sermon can you go to the next one
[44:52] please
[44:54] now i want to bring another thought
[44:55] about a table
[44:57] because eating from a table is not just
[45:00] it's more than just eating a wee bit of
[45:02] food from a table
[45:04] there's actually a bigger concept in
[45:05] this idea of eating from a table and i'm
[45:07] just going to read you this one
[45:08] then zeba then said zebra unto the king
[45:11] according to all that my lord the king
[45:13] hath commanded his servant
[45:14] so shall thy seven do as for me
[45:18] said the king he shall eat at my table
[45:20] as one of the king's sons
[45:22] now this was um so this is david
[45:25] speaking and
[45:25] mephibosheth was jonathan's son
[45:29] and david always loved jonathan and he i
[45:32] love loyalty
[45:33] david was he whenever he thought of
[45:35] jonathan he always thought in his heart
[45:37] i love jonathan
[45:38] and and they had a loyal bond with each
[45:40] other and
[45:42] that's a godly thing to be loyal to have
[45:44] a to have a loyal bond that never breaks
[45:46] you know even when jonathan was gone
[45:49] when he did go david was so upset
[45:53] he was so upset and he he even cried out
[45:57] to god and he said
[45:58] publish it not in death you know don't
[46:01] let anyone know unless the daughters of
[46:02] the philistines rejoice don't let anyone
[46:03] know that these mighty men have fallen
[46:06] like it really touched his heart and he
[46:08] he he began to speak about
[46:10] they were like hinds feet in high places
[46:12] they were just these amazing people
[46:14] sword and jonathan they were powerful
[46:15] warriors you know the sword of
[46:17] the sword of sword didn't return empty
[46:19] you know the bow of jonathan never
[46:20] turned back
[46:23] so he had this such a feeling of loyalty
[46:25] to
[46:27] jonathan maybe he got busy with things
[46:30] his life went on but then one day that
[46:31] that loyal feeling came up again and he
[46:33] thought what's what's happened to
[46:34] what of jonathan's family and then he
[46:36] found out that he had this
[46:38] um was it his son yeah mephibosheth his
[46:42] son
[46:44] but they had gotten to trouble when that
[46:45] when when the hen the
[46:47] his mother i think was running away and
[46:49] he had fallen they had fallen over and
[46:51] this refugee couldn't actually walk
[46:53] because
[46:54] he had this injury when he was a baby so
[46:55] he was a his whole life
[46:58] but then one day david thought about
[47:02] jonathan then he wanted to track down
[47:03] does he have any offspring and he
[47:04] tracked down mephibosheth
[47:06] and the loyalty in him said i want to do
[47:07] something good for jonathan so
[47:09] mephibosheth is is his son
[47:13] and so he and he said to him if she
[47:18] you can come and be with me and eat at
[47:20] my table
[47:21] come and sit around my tables and and be
[47:23] as one of the king's sons
[47:25] now i want to explain to you what this
[47:27] means this isn't just like oh
[47:29] um refurbished um we breakfast at um
[47:32] eight o'clock and then
[47:33] lunch is about 12 30 and then dinners at
[47:35] six o'clock so just wait out there and

[47:39] open the gate just so you can whiz in
[47:41] breakfast is serve for half an hour then
[47:42] you just go back out you know and then
[47:44] lunch time
[47:44] quick meal you know we generally don't
[47:46] stop for long dinner we'll stretch it
[47:48] out for an hour maybe but you know
[47:49] we'll invite you in and once it's done
[47:51] you gotta walk back out again and you
[47:52] know wait outside

[48:31] have
[48:32] it was almost just symbolic to say come
[48:34] at my table but that was just the
[48:36] that was more symbolic to say come and
[48:39] dine with me you know live with me enjoy
[48:41] everything that i have
[48:43] and that's really to the next one please
[48:46] that's really
[48:49] go back sorry that's really what it
[48:51] means when we dine at the lord's table
[48:52] it's actually his whole
[48:54] his his
[49:02] the lord's table for us is more than
[49:04] just
[49:06] it's it's like what i just described you
[49:08] know it's actually a bigger it's coming
[49:09] under his umbrella when we dine at the
[49:10] lord's table
[49:15] and the table in i'm just going to talk
[49:18] about this for a minute the table
[49:20] when you think about a table there's a
[49:22] sign that says bring it all to the table
[49:25] you ever heard that saying bring it all
[49:27] to the table that means when is the
[49:28] situation happening when something's got
[49:30] to be worked out or you're not happy
[49:31] with something or
[49:32] you need to work through something you
[49:34] say look look let's just meet up
[49:36] this time meet at a certain place over a
[49:38] meal just bring it all to the table
[49:40] you know whatever whatever concerns
[49:42] you've got anything that it is
[49:43] come let's meet together come let us
[49:45] reason together saith the lord
[49:47] the table is not just a place where you
[49:48] go and eat food it's actually where you
[49:49] can meet together come and meet together
[49:51] we'll bring it all to the table
[49:52] let's talk about this let's reason
[49:54] together let's
[49:55] tell me about what you're going through
[49:57] tell me tell me what's happening tell me
[49:58] how your day's been tell me the
[50:00] tell me your ups tell me you're down
[50:01] tell it all to me and that's actually
[50:03] what the table of the lord is it's not
[50:04] just coming for you actually bring it
[50:06] all to the table
[50:07] lord this is how my day's been this is
[50:09] what's happening to me at the moment
[50:10] it's the table of the lord it's more
[50:11] than just
[50:12] you get some food but you actually can
[50:13] express your life at the table
[50:15] you know lord this is this is how my day
[50:17] was this is what this is what i'm going
[50:18] through
[50:19] any any need you got you bring them all
[50:21] to the table don't forget that you bring
[50:23] it all to the table
[50:25] but there's also a another side to that
[50:27] as well
[50:28] which we have to keep in inside a
[50:30] relationship who's
[50:31] and i think i can say this who's heard
[50:33] the other saying don't bite the hand
[50:35] that feeds you
[50:37] you know this works both ways we don't
[50:40] just come and
[50:41] bring all our needs and bring it all to
[50:42] the table and eat food and walk away
[50:44] you you're actually there's somebody
[50:47] that's feeding you at the table
[50:48] like i think mufaba sheth would have had
[50:50] respect for david
[50:52] well david's a great guy this is the
[50:54] best thing's ever happened to me
[50:55] i love david you know
[50:59] he's tell you what i was living out
[51:00] there i had nothing now i'm here and i
[51:02] get to live
[51:03] live with david all the time i love
[51:05] david he's such a great guy you know
[51:08] he he wouldn't have cursed david i
[51:10] wouldn't well
[51:11] if he was not a good person he would
[51:13] have but if he had any outs of dignity
[51:14] and a more
[51:16] good character he would have actually
[51:17] really respected dave and thought i'm so
[51:19] happy for what david's done for me
[51:21] you need anything from me david i've
[51:22] only got
[51:24] i crawled along the ground but if you
[51:26] need anything i'm here
[51:27] you know i can use my hands
[51:30] i'm here to help you know you don't bite
[51:33] the hand that feeds you and that's the
[51:34] relationship with god
[51:36] sure we can we all talk about bringing
[51:38] all our needs to the lord but it also
[51:39] works both ways lord you you provide
[51:41] this
[51:41] great spread for us lord you provide all
[51:44] of this
[51:45] lord i really i really appreciate that i
[51:47] really appreciate the spirit you've
[51:48] provided i really appreciate the
[51:49] umbrella i can come under you know
[51:51] anything you want from me
[51:52] you just ask you know i really
[51:54] appreciate it
[51:55] i'm not going to bite the hand that
[51:57] feeds me
[51:59] go to the next one i just got this verse
[52:01] here because i like this verse
[52:03] and i like it more now that i've been
[52:05] through a few things better as a dinner
[52:06] of herbs where love is than stalled
[52:09] than a stalled ox and hatred there with
[52:13] and as you go on in life you realize
[52:15] it's better to have not much but have an
[52:17] environment
[52:18] of love and be amongst people that love
[52:19] you then have a lot
[52:21] and be in turmoil and strife and be in
[52:23] an atmosphere with this hate
[52:26] because our body is an easy thing to
[52:28] just you know if you can't get much food
[52:30] we can kind of go oh well i'm a bit
[52:31] hungry no it's okay it's not such a bad
[52:34] thing
[52:34] but when you're an environment where
[52:36] your mind is not happy
[52:38] that's a lot harder to take than to than
[52:40] your stomach to be a bit hungry
[52:42] at that that that destroys your whole
[52:44] life if your mind is if you're in a
[52:45] place of hate
[52:46] and strife then everywhere you go
[52:48] there's just hate and strife in your
[52:49] mind if you notice that when there's a
[52:51] bad atmosphere
[52:52] but when there's love when you've got
[52:54] when you can be an atmosphere of love
[52:56] things are so much easier you can be
[52:58] happy even if you're a little bit hungry
[53:00] you can be happy and that's what this
[53:01] verse is it's better to have not much
[53:03] food but be in a
[53:04] be involved with around a table with
[53:06] these loving people and you just there's
[53:07] love
[53:08] rather than have a whole lot of food and
[53:11] but your mind can't rest it's all
[53:12] turmoil and this hatred amongst the
[53:14] people that's
[53:16] you can't live like that and you know
[53:18] sometimes when we walk with the lord i
[53:20] don't want to put it like we sometimes
[53:21] only get herbs but you know
[53:22] sometimes things don't go our way you
[53:24] know we walk along and life ain't going
[53:25] too grand for us you know
[53:27] sometimes maybe the spread on the table
[53:29] isn't as grand as what it could be
[53:31] you know but there's always but we can
[53:33] always just fellowship in the love of
[53:34] god and just be happy through all of our
[53:35] trials or anything we can say lord i'm
[53:37] just
[53:38] i just rejoice whether i've got little
[53:39] or a lot i'm just rejoicing lord now i'm
[53:41] not saying the table of the lord doesn't
[53:42] provide a lot it does spiritually but
[53:44] i'm just
[53:44] using it as an analogy i'd rather have
[53:47] not much at the table of the lord
[53:49] than a whole lot with the with with
[53:52] hatred and strife that's why brother
[53:54] brown said i'd rather drink soda water
[53:57] and eat dry crackers you know and be
[53:59] serving the lord i'll be happier there
[54:00] just give me that you know
[54:02] that's that's what we'd rather have next
[54:05] one please
[54:08] i'm going to cover two more thoughts
[54:10] then we're going to pray
[54:12] sir we only live by dead substance
[54:16] i don't care what you eat you eat
[54:17] vegetables you eat you eat bread
[54:19] the wheat died if you eat corn
[54:22] the corn died if you eat beans the beans
[54:25] died
[54:26] whatever you eat you can only live
[54:27] physically because something died that
[54:29] you could live
[54:31] something has got to die for you to
[54:33] partake of any table
[54:35] to enjoy some food at any table
[54:36] something has to die for you to be there
[54:38] otherwise you can eat cardboard no even
[54:41] cardboard
[54:43] eventually had to die the men in world
[54:46] war one had eight boot leather when they
[54:48] got very hungry
[54:49] because it was skin they could boil the
[54:52] boot leather up and eat it
[54:56] but in order for you to live like you
[54:58] can't eat you can't you couldn't live
[55:00] off rocks
[55:01] or some substance that doesn't have life
[55:03] to it you couldn't live off that
[55:05] you need to have something with life has
[55:07] to die for you to partake of
[55:08] of of the table every single day
[55:11] something's dying for us naturally
[55:13] something has to die if you want to live
[55:15] and if nothing dies for you you die
[55:19] next one i've got a thought coming here
[55:22] but we've had our fellowship with each
[55:23] other as we have served this wonderful
[55:25] meal tonight across the table as we fed
[55:26] our physical bodies and now
[55:28] we'd like for god to feed our soul on
[55:29] his manner that's hid
[55:31] only for those preachers entered into
[55:33] the whole list of holies is permitted to
[55:35] eat of his food
[55:37] i put that quote in there because
[55:39] spiritually
[55:40] if we want to eat from the table this
[55:42] benefit that we have to eat from the
[55:44] table of the lord
[55:46] we have only gotten that benefit because
[55:47] somebody has died
[55:49] that we could go and pay be a partaker
[55:51] of that table
[55:53] like when the priest went into the
[55:55] holiest of holies
[55:57] something had to die in order for them
[55:59] to enter into that place
[56:02] and then they could partake of that
[56:04] hidden manner but something had to die
[56:06] in order for them to enter in
[56:08] and this table of the lord that we we we
[56:11] eat from
[56:13] somebody had to die in order for us to
[56:15] enjoy that it didn't come
[56:18] for nothing something had to die
[56:21] and all for in order for us to live
[56:23] spiritually something else something's
[56:24] got to die and the lord actually
[56:26] died for us so that we could partake of
[56:29] that table
[56:30] if he didn't we couldn't partake of it
[56:32] we couldn't enter in
[56:34] that that's that's what the lord has
[56:36] done in order for us to even pray
[56:37] tonight
[56:38] life has been given that we could go and
[56:40] pray that we can pray this evening
[56:43] life has been given that we could live
[56:45] last one i've got here
[56:47] jesus says in revelation behold i stand
[56:50] at the door and knock
[56:50] i like this verse if any man hear my
[56:53] voice and open the door
