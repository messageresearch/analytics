the choir but i understand amen let's uh go to the scripture this morning we're going to read matthew 28 uh sorry matthew 8 in verse 27 to 29 amen but we just want to speak the name of jesus over every heart in every life today amen praise the lord amen so matthew 8 and verses 27 to 29. amen thank you for your prayers for william he's still recovering so that's why christine and him aren't here today but they they're here in spirit they wanted to be here so bad but amen we're going to look forward to time when we're all together praise the lord matthew uh 8 and verses 27 to 29 i was going to drop in here where where the lord calmed the storm he says but the men marveled saying what manner of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey him and when he was come to the other side into the country of the uh uh aries or have you say that they met him to possess with devils coming out of the tombs exceeding fear so that no man might pass by that way and behold they cried out saying what have we to do with thee jesus thou son of god art thou come to torment us before the time amen we're just gonna and and i could say this is the day i'll i'll get to it this is the day where the devil is tormented he's sure he's gonna be tormented like a fire but this hour is where the wrath of god's being pulled out upon him through the bride of christ sure there's a great tribulation everything but this hour he's being tormented because there's a people on the earth that can't be bought they can't be traded they are the lords they know they're the lords and the devil can't do nothing to stop them amen so let's bow here's the word of prayer if you have a need you want to raise your hands to the lord just want to remember my sister hannah's having their first child

may you bless and touch them oh god keep them father we just want to commit the service into your hands bless your word we've just read as well for your glory in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats this morning so i've been talking for those who are just visiting i've been talking about the devil's mental health crisis for the past couple of sundays he's having a mental health crisis and um i just want to kind of maybe wrap this up a little bit but it but uh but if i could subtitle this i'd say it's time to plague his kingdom amen we're you know we're living in a time where where you know we're living in an exodus hour and if we're looking back in the first two exoduses we see the pattern repeating where where in the first exodus you know moses was sent down into egypt to deliver a people now there's a saying that it takes uh it takes way less time to destroy something than it is to build it oh yeah now if you just look at egypt to where it was when moses stepped in there and said let my people go there was generations of effort manpower resources great battles were fought buildings were built great cities were constructed it was generations of effort to build it but then i was looking into how long was the gap between when moses first went in before pharaoh and then when they left after the passover and um it doesn't exactly say in the scripture if you can light me on that that'd be real nice but some people said it's around about 40 days and even if it was longer than that it didn't it didn't take very long relatively to how long it took to build egypt to tear it down and what i love about this is that the devil can be building complexes and spirits and for generations and families it can be passed down and you know stubbornness unforgiveness business resentment whatever it is it can be generations of work the devil's been working on a family for generations but then just in a moment when the anointing of god strikes that person that's all demolished hallelujah so i'm so glad that we're anointed to tear satan's kingdom down and this is what gives the devil a great mental health crisis we're here to torment his work i mean i'm not talking about remember we do not fight against flesh and blood right but we war against spiritual wickedness demon powers in high places it says in second corinthians 10 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of god and bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ i mean so we war against demon power but we're here to cast it down we're here to tear satan's kingdom down amen through the anointing of god you just think about those four friends that they carried their crippled or sick friend on on the stretcher they tried to get to jesus they couldn't get through the door into the house they went to the top of the house nothing was going to stop them they began to tear the tiles up they they stole the sunroof free of charge amen because they weren't willing to let anything stop amen their friend getting into the prince of god and it was and when jesus jesus looked and the scripture says when jesus saw their faith not the crippled man's faith but their faith he said you know take up your bed and walk he says but what's easy oh he said thy sins a forgiven thing he says what's easy to say guy sends a figure and then he'll take up thy bed and walk and he picks up his bed and he packs it out the door i mean but it shows that i don't know how long it took to build that house but it took less time to destroy the roof and lower him into the presence of god that it took to build it amen so by prayer we can tear the roof off every situation i mean by prayer we can we can create an entrance for others into the presence of god and when god sees your faith he answers your prayer for them i mean that man could not get in his own strength as it was his friend's strength that got him in there hallelujah so we can do the same thing today remember we're not here to be slaves we're not here just to put up with satan amen no no that's not our job description our job description is satan destroyer serpent bruiser amen we're here to crush demons under our feet by the anointing of god that is our job description that is who we are now we know that the devil kicks the most just before he's going to be cast out that's that's a pattern that you know that's how he works jesus would be uh uh you know a a boy with an epileptic spirit a dumb and deaf spirit rather was brought before him his disciples couldn't couldn't couldn't cast it out but then says here in mark 9 23-29 jesus said unto him if thou can believe all things are possible to him that believeth so it's up to your faith it's not what everyone else is doing what are you doing what are you doing about it and straight away the father of child cried out and said with tears lord i believe help thou might unbelief that's a good way to be lord i believe but help my faith amen to apprehend the promise help my unbelief when jesus saw that the people came running together he rebuked the foul spirit saying unto him thou dumb and deaf spirit i charge thee come out of him and enter no more unto him and the spirit cried out rent and saw came out of him and he was as one dead and so much as many said uh he is dead but jesus took him by the hand and lifted up and he arose amen so now the devil is kicking because he has been cast out and and the devil's kicking in this hour like never before because this is the hour of his greatest defeat this is the hour where he is cast out of a people and he cannot like down through the church ages where there'll be a cycle of revival and death revival and death so there'll be revival but the devil say i'll just wait a bit longer i'm going to get them but there's a people upon the earth right now where it's not a cycle of revival and death not just getting excited and calling off and all those things there's just revival into revival into revival where god has called now for a cycle of the bride's revival not a church revival but an unending cycle of revival you know it's very important we keep these things before us because it would change the course of our lives you know i was looking at history and george whitfield who was a who was a um he was a contemporary of of john wesley he was part of actually the uh uh the holiness club or the holy club that that that john wesley was part of when he was at university and he would preach about how everyone must have a new birth he actually brought out he he brought that concept out into you know out into the public arena like never before and he believed that every uh every truly religious person needs the experience of a rebirth in jesus christ and so and he and he didn't care for the for the distinctions of denominational geography so basically he didn't care where you came from how you spoke your nationality well he didn't care about that stuff about your religious passages you must be born again and and he preached in the american cul of the british american colonies and he preached this in the uh early methodist movement and he processed you know he preached this new birth you must be born again and it created an awakening in those colonies where they realized we don't have to be subservient to a government across the sea it was a big part of the american revolution was his preaching not that he was preaching revolution but he's preaching a new birth where people could have a new identity a new life not just a reformed life but a new life be transformed by the spirit of god and it actually generated a revolution amen amen and if we could just keep before us that we are the sons and daughters of god i mean we're born with the price the precious blood of jesus christ that we don't need to bow down to the devil into his lives we are not as slaves we're not as property amen but we are called for you know our position as he is under our feet and we are standing on his head i mean we're standing on his neck amen so it's so important i think to keep before us this is the hour of liberty this is the hour of restoration because god is calling for restoration not that just man is calling for it god is calling for a complete and utter restoration amen where people are restored to the acts of you know the faith of the fathers i mean we're back to an original genuine pentecost before the church ever fell where god walked in power and his people they walked in humility they were surrendered to the will of god they didn't care about anything but him amen and this is what this message has done is called this brought us back to a true restoration hallelujah i've many times but i'll share it one more time i was there in papua new papua new guinea the last time and i was saying this message brings us back to a genuine pentecost and the interpreter stopped interpreting for about three or four minutes because everyone understood in their own language and and and some of the men there they're all stoic men one of the pastors very stock man and he and you're after the service i didn't know what was going on but after the service he came and tried to close in prayers just weeping over the pulpit they were just so blown away what was going on and but the thing is god did that to prove it's more this is more than just words friends this is more than just a nice idea this is reality amen it's not just a bunch of doctrine to argue over and fast and fight and stew no no there's promises that god has released in this hour and they're for you and i amen but the devil will try and stop us from obtaining those promises that's his job but we're here to cast him out now moses would step down and to step down into egypt and you think about the destruction that was laid waste to that kingdom now you type the natural with the spiritual so when when israel walked out of egypt now this is probably not everything but you go read the account of the exodus egypt was literally decimated their cattle were destroyed all vegetation was eaten eaten up by locusts the nile was turned to blood so all fish were dead their army or at least the greatest part of it was annihilated in the red sea their firstborn were dead and they gave the israelites all their riches as they went so before before moses stepped in they were prospering they were doing really well when they walked out the place was literally in ruin that's right amen this is how powerful god is and how determined he is that his children will go free they're not going to stay bound they're not going to stay slaves he's determined that they're walking free it doesn't matter how many plagues are gonna come on satan's kingdom he's just gonna pour it out and pour it out and pour it out and god wants to plague satan's kingdom through you i just jump to the end of my sermon he wants to plague satan's kingdom through you it's not through someone else through your lips amen he wants to tear satan's kingdom down hallelujah amen it was absolutely destroyed you take the second exodus now it wasn't a physical structures that were destroyed or an economy of a people i mean but it was idols of unbelief superstition and sins in people's hearts god just came in and tore it all down no no that's not meant to be there i'm gonna renovate these people i'm gonna transform these people by the baptism of the holy ghost i'm not just going to give them a paint job i'm going to transform their inside the things they once walked with and say well this is just how we are we're just gone hey man it's the same thing with you and i today friends god we're not here to be a patch-up job this is not a renovation center i mean this word transforms changes into new creatures hallelujah that is what it does and that's what we've seen it do amen hallelujah amen praise the lord that's right hallelujah amen amen the third exodus in the same way we know now first exodus we know was leaving israel leaving egypt to a promised land second exodus was the believer leaving the old testament law and formal worship going into the baptism of the holy ghost this third exodus is those who are in the baptism of the holy ghost going into another world amen hallelujah and he's called us for that isn't that wonderful hey bender so so as these exoduses go along i mean there's a there's a there's a repeat of satan's kingdom being laid waste yes amen you see you've got to you've got to look at the enemy in the eye see the problem is time can be such a curse because the longer a promise lingers many people their faith begins to wane but we should be like the faith we should have the faith of abraham where though it may linger though it's coming amen though though the vision may carry it will be fulfilled i mean so we should never look at time and say well i guess it wasn't for me it's for you i mean you'd never let time weigh down your faith it should actually increase your faith because the longer time goes in the human mind the more impossible it gets and the more impossible it gets it's the more god steps in hallelujah so we should never ever let the promise of god slip but we should hold them close hallelujah amen the devil's howling in this hour brother i'm saying christ is a mystery god revealed he says identified as speaking about the bride of christ identified with the word i mean christ living in them oh the devil's howling about this the manifested truth of the promise of the word and her alone they don't have the answer when jesus came why didn't those pharisees he said if i cast out devils by the finger of god who do you cast him out by sea he stood alone and his church stands alone she's not hooked up with nothing but he was identified by god being the body that god dwelt in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days and she and she alone stands by it that's why the devil is howling these great organizations to set up something to close her up they'll never do it she'll be taken up not closed up she has now risen by the power of the vindicated word promised to her amen amen so we shouldn't be just expecting some slow motion train wreck going on where we're going to be shut down and blah blah who cares about the four walls anyway but the prophet said she'll she won't be closed up she'll be taken up i mean so when the hour when it gets the darkest member dawn's coming another day's coming the sun's coming it's always the darkest and coldest just before dawn i mean but the darker and colder it gets it means dawn is getting real close i mean there's a new day dawning so don't get caught up in the darkness and how cold it may be now look the sun's coming up hallelujah amen she won't be closed up she's going to be taken up he says they'll never do it amen now a bride holds that promise he told me he would return for me i'll believe it aha yes sir tomato head sheep head her headship her redeemer her husband her king her lord her lover her savior in the promised meeting place which is in the meeting of the year amen now the devil kicks the most when he's about to be cast out and he puts pressure on just before deliverance comes now it's amazing when you look into uh exodus here if we go to exodus chapter four if i have it here you know god already tells moses what the end was going to be he says in exodus 4 and 21 he said and the lord said unto moses when now goes to return into egypt so he's not even there yet this is this is the by the burning bush god's giving these instructions i think it's here when though guys to return into egypt see that thou do all these wonders before pharaoh which i put into thine hand but i will harden his heart and he shall not let the people go so moses already is no knows what's going to happen and thou shalt send a pharaoh thus saith the lord israel is my son even my firstborn and i say unto thee let my people go that he may serve me and if thou refuse to let him go behold i will slay thy son even thy firstborn that was the last plague that came upon egypt so moses already knew the in end result of what's going to happen he didn't walk in there blind saying well yeah i wonder if pharaoh's going to do it no it was going to come down to this crunch point we know what's going to happen in the outcome of this exodus amen where our where where the apostle paul would write in first corinthians 15 behold i show you a mystery you shall not all sleep but you shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and ye shall all be changed for this corrupt rule must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this couple shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory so we know the end result of this exodus do we not amen we're not just gonna god hasn't called us just to leave us halfway right when moses was commissioned by god to go down into egypt god didn't just quit because pharaoh's heart was hardened that's right right it never got too hard for god god was determined i'm going to call my son out of egypt you're going down there to do the job hallelujah and even before you know what i love about it is even before israel went down into egypt there israel as in jacob became israel you know and they went down into egypt even before it went into the pharaoh's mind i'm going to turn these people into slaves even before israel cried out because of the slavery god had already given a prophecy to abraham that that he said to abraham abraham your seat is going to sow during a strange land 400 years they're going to be afflicted but i'm going to bring them out with a mighty hand and with a great substance so even before it came into the heart of pharaoh i'm going to throw these boy baby boys into the nile even before he decided i'm going to afflict them as as slaves god had already prophesied this is what's going to happen but then this is what's going to happen so you're going to be slaves but then you're going to come out with a mighty hand so what i love about it is that god would god would call us he would think of us before the foundation of the world he would write our names in the lamb's book of life before the foundational world before the devil ever came into existence before lucifer ever decided hey i'm better than everyone else i can make a better kingdom than god before that ever happened god already made a way amen for us to defeat our enemy so the and then he even said to job job where were you here's job sitting on his sheep he's all in despair doesn't know what's going on god comes down to him i'm going to answer you job and he would say job where were you when i laid the foundation of the world where the morning stars and the sons of god all shouted for joy hallelujah so he's telling job job before you ever set foot on this earth in my mind you're shouting in my mind you're praising and you're in my mind you're worshiping me hallelujah so joke you're in this small space of time but i didn't see you just as this is not your end this is just a transition place i've got to use you as a testimony job because you found favor in my sight because you're a perfect man hallelujah so jesus job when i saw you before the foundation of the world i didn't see you on this ash sheep i saw you shouting for joy and if god thought of us that way there's no in eternity before the devil ever came into existence nothing the devil can do in time can disrupt where we're going to end up nothing absolutely nothing so it doesn't matter how hard it gets how much trials come how many struggles we have amen if god thought of me before the foundation of the world i'm going to end up there hallelujah amen so so it's amazing the prophecy was already given that they're going to be in slavery but they're going to come out with a mighty hand and it's it's exactly what happened hallelujah hallelujah amen so now as i said before the devil puts pressure on just before deliverance comes now when moses went into went and spoke to pharaoh pharaoh just said well i'm just going to just going to increase the burdens of the israelites because you're going to try and break them try and get them to look at natural things so he said i'm not going to give you any more straw to make bricks you got to find your own straw and you know i'm going to increase your burden i'm going to increase your bondage and so what he was trying to get them to do was take their eyes because what was moses he was fulfilled scripture walking in i am the man he could have said i'm the manifestation of the prophecy given to our father abraham he was he was the he was the prophecy fulfilled right so so the israelites could have just looked at him and said praise the lord we're on our way out amen hallelujah who cares what the devil can who cares what pharaoh can do to us actually no no if he's the fulfillment of the deliverer and i'm the one that needs deliverance i'm being delivered hallelujah so they could have just rejoiced amen had just walked on anyway but then when pharaoh put that increase when he when he made the people find their own straw increase their tally of bricks and different things all it was trying to do is get the people to take their eyes off the promise that was being fulfilled right in their midst right there remember this wasn't a one day he's coming he was there he was walking around in in in sandals with the staff of deliverance the deliverer was there it wasn't one day he's coming he was there they were in the fulfillment of the word amen but the but but the pharaoh was trying to get them to take their eyes off the promise that was right among them and try and get them to look at natural things of bricks and straw that was their burden they even complained to moses complain to pharaoh everyone's you know this is not fair you've increased our burden what they should have done is praise the lord amen hallelujah sure there's a lot of pressure right now on this age but we're about to leave we're about to walk out of here this is the hour hallelujah he tried to keep them looking on natural things instead of the reality of the deliverance right in their midst we must never ever just focus on natural things and take our eyes off the promised word that's being fulfilled right now hallelujah amen he does the same thing today we're in the season of deliverance he tries to get us to focus on things that are not promised of god try oh we've got to fix this we're going to sort this listen to this advice we're going to you know sort about all these natural things they'll take care of themselves they'll take care of themselves but what are we doing with the promises in our midst right now because all those things really are is just building more bricks for pharaoh sure we've got to live in this world we need jobs we need careers get an education if you can you're all those things sure but don't let it be your all in all don't let that define you i'm not defined because i happen to work at esr that's not my who i am i'm a christian hallelujah it should be the same thing with your whatever what profession we're in that's not our identity we just happen to do that because we need to do it because we need to live but we are defined by the word of god in the word of god alone so don't let the devil putting pressure on you like that yo get your eyes off the promise because they begin to complain to to moses about this he basically they said it's your fault that that pharaohs put this burden upon us it's your fault and here was the guy seen to deliver them you know and they were all worshiping before that because moses went down with aaron and called the elders of israel did the signs they bowed their heads and worshiped but there was no pressure when that was going on it's easy to praise god when things are fine but what about keeping your eyes on the promise when things aren't fine amen no that's right the problem is is israel was used to being slaves they were conditioned by their upbringing of being slaves it was it was not just them but their fathers and so on however long that 400 years that's a long time of slavery that's longer than this nation was has been here and the way it is now right but so they were conditioned it was like you know that's longer than america has been america right that's a long time but you see so they were conditioned that way and the problem is as spirits become very familiar with us you know the bible speaks about familiar spirits and it speaks to people who will commune with demons and different things but i want to take it in other ways that spirits can be familiar now that spirit of slavery was familiar to the israelites they were used to it they were born under it that's how they and it made them think a certain way because when when things got hard they appealed to pharaoh pharaoh wasn't their king god was their king god was calling them out they should have appealed remember at first they appealed to god because they cried out because of their bondage then god brought the deliverer in and then they complained to pharaoh about the bondage that pharaoh is putting them under you know but because why they went to the one who they really thought was their master we never want to think this world or some demon spirit is our master right we are not here to be dictated to by satan and his devices we are not here to put up with spirits we're familiar with so spirits that we're familiar with make us think a certain way so someone who's depressed they've got a spirit of depression upon them so they think like a depressed person no one likes me i'm just unhappy no one cares about me you know and they're just all sad and down and deep and promise if you get familiar with that spirit at first it becomes a strange thing at first but then someone gets familiar with it and then they begin to identify that's me right or someone who who cannot forgive you know at first it's a shock i can't believe i can't forgive this person because that spirit's trying to become familiar with you but then if you allow it to come in more and more that's just how you think well they're wrong and they did this and how did they 50 million years ago they said that right and you know and that's all they're living through and it's why it's a spirit of unforgiveness and they become familiar with that it becomes their identity stubbornness lust or pride or whatever it may be envy gossip people get your at first it's a shocking thing because you're not used to it but then when you become familiar i mean it becomes part of who you are and the and the children of israel i mean they became that same way where that spirit of slavery they were very familiar with that's why friends we're not called we are people but we're different kind of people we're the ransomed body of jesus christ amen purchased by his blood made in his image transformed by his holy ghost we are not we are like everyone else but at the same time we're not like abraham was like anyone else but he was caught by god that's what made him different and that's the same thing with you and i god called us that's what makes us different hallelujah so you know i'm so thankful that we you know we should never well we don't need to stay with a familiar spirit that's right even if even if you see well my father was like that my grandfather or my grandmother whatever more you can see a strain in the family come down to you yeah we don't have to put up with that the blood of jesus christ is here to break to cast that out to bring deliverance amen that that the spirit of god is the one that we are familiar with he should not be some distant stranger that sends you a whatsapp every decade he should be closer than your spouse or he should be your best friend oh you're our spouse our best friend but i mean god should be our best best friend our bff hallelujah we should be very familiar with his presence not taking it for granted but we should be familiar so and then when something else comes in it should be a shock all right oh god this is not you this is funny yes i don't like this but then when when the prince of god comes around it's like lord this is home his presence should feel like home hallelujah it shouldn't be a distant funny thing that we're just not used to amen hallelujah so they were slaves now i i happened to google i you know i asked mr google what's a slave and mr google said a slave is a person who is the legal property of another and is forced to obey them that's a slave so now the israelites though pharaoh considered them legal property and pharaoh considered they have to obey him that was pharaoh's mentality and that and that mentality was projected upon the israelites but they were the sons and daughters of god he says out of egypt i've called my son now he said that about jesus but he said then his lesser son was israel being called out amen so those people were never the actually the legal property sure and pharaoh's mind was one thing but in god's mind it's another so in pharaoh's mind they were his legal property and they were forced to obey him but in god's mind they were the sons his children amen they were his property i mean so now god has to transform into us his thinking about us yes the thoughts i have towards your piece you'll come to an expected end that expected end is dancing on streets of gold redeemed made in his image washed in the blood that's god's sauce towards you remember if god thought that about you and god cannot change your sinking god's mind is made up about you irrespective of up and down then and out whatever you may go like this try to walk a straight line but you'll god will get you there hallelujah have you just surrendered to his will amen remember it's not him that willeth or runneth but who god gives mercy to others if god has made up his mind about you done amen but now you've got to make up your mind about who you are amen and him amen hallelujah so now remember they were they were never meant to be they were never really pharaoh's property just like we are not the devil's property we never ever belong to him amen amen some people think well i'm just a slave to the devil no no but you're not the devil's property amen you don't belong on his side you're not mean to think like he thinks act like he acts amen because remember you know before there ever was a devil we are gods right so we never were the devils we were under his dominion once upon a time just like israel they were never pharaohs but they were under his dominion but god came to loose them from the bondage of bondage of slavery it's the same thing amen with us where the lord is here to deliver us from the bondage of a of a sin nature that we're born with hallelujah because it says in first corinthians 6 it says what know you not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which you have of god and you are not your own for you're bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit with your gods now we don't become god's property by the baptism of the holy ghost just like we do not become sons and daughters of god when we receive the holy ghost it says in galatians because you are sons not because you became sons but because you are sons he sent for the spirit into your hearts will you cry abba father so it's because you are you receive the holy ghost you do not become it's because you are amen hallelujah so we have always been god's property amen amen we have always been god's property we never actually belong to the devil amen so now if we could look at it that way now i love it where where jesus was saying john 10 and 27 just just just hold with me this morning he said now my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i will give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand hallelujah so there's nothing on earth or in hell that can pluck a child of god out of god's hands that means they can never truly become lost they may be like a prodigal that wanders for a season hallelujah hey we all walked in darkness the scripture says we're all like sheep gone astray says one point of our lives we all went astray that may have been in the world or maybe you started walking with god then you went australia to bring you back amen amen but if you're part of god you're going to come back to god amen maybe it's a weird so so if nothing can pluck them out of his hand we need to believe like that for our family amen even though they may be wandering in darkness somewhere we've got to believe lord they're in your hand the devil can't pluck them out amen he may be dragging around all which way but they're still yours they're still your property hallelujah why because we've got to look beyond what we see and look to the promise of god that's what we've got to keep in our forefront and our minds like if like if israel when the bricks you know yo that all got harder they just kept the promise in the forefront hallelujah they wouldn't have been complaining to to moses and to pharaoh about it maybe but they would have just been rejoicing saying we're in the seasons of season of deliverance amen amen remember children of israel never actually belong to pharaoh thou god's chosen people amen and you know we live in this time we need to realize who we are now as as slaves as slaves the children of israel were not manifesting their name because because in genesis 32 when when jacob wrestled with the angel and god changed his name to israel he says he says you'll no longer be called jacob but israel for as a prince has thou power with god and with men and has prevailed and even even the name israel just looked at the strong's it means he will rule as god that's his name so when they were slaves living well below their privilege in egypt they weren't manifesting that they're manifesting slavery right they were not ruling as god they were not having dominion like they had god given dominion right but they were living under slavery so they weren't manifesting the name of israel now we know the brightest spiritual israel hallelujah so it's time it's it's it's well time oh yes where we throw away our slave mentality remember just because israel was slaves doesn't mean they weren't god's chosen people right so they're under all kind of complexes pains and hurts and whatever more they were still god's chosen people amen so just because someone may be in that condition you may be that way this morning that does not mean you're not one of gods hallelujah so it's time it's time to rule as god upon the earth amen where every power of satan is under our feet amen that's what the baptism of the holy ghost does is put satan in his rightful place puts you in your rifle position hey once upon a time the devil was my slave master he beat me made me do all kinds of things i'd wake up with regret saying i'm never doing that again next minute i was doing it again why because that unbelief was governing my life amen but then but then god richard mercy came along satan was dethroned there was a revolution hallelujah not a reformation of trying to be a religious person but a revolution where god changed my nature filled me with the holy ghost and now those things don't even come near me no more hallelujah i'm sure the devil kicks puts all kinds of mind battles in your mind but hey if he kicks it means he's about to leave amen hallelujah i love the book of genesis you know genesis one and two there's different laws are put into put into manifestation and one of them is when god makes the day and night and he and it says that he you know let there be lights for the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth and it was so and god made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser uh lesser light to rule the night and he made the stars also so he gave the sun dominion over the day doesn't matter how many flashlights or cell phone lights you put on in the day time it'll never it'll never be brighter than that sun because that sun rules the day right it controls the day it controls the temperature upon the earth and different things that go on the sunlight rules the day now we know that the lesser light is the moon and the moon actually has no light in itself it's just a reflector of the sun just as the bride is a reflector we don't have our own light it's just the sunlight of god shining upon us and reflecting to the earth but god there in genesis gave gave us dominion just like the moon had dominion over the night we're living in a night season but the light is still shining shining from the son on to the bride to the to the rest of the world so he said that the moon would have dominion he never said that the darkness would have them the knight would have dominion over the moon when god puts a law in place it's there it doesn't change it doesn't change because of hashtags and different things on you know social media it stays exactly how it should be right so if god gave us dominion over the darkness amen i say lord may we take our god-given position hallelujah we're not just a little speck in the galaxy no god built us remember he built this it's not us building ourselves god built us to have dominion over the powers of darkness over unbelief over superstition over complexes over pain over lust spirits unforgiveness bitterness resentment whatever it may be pity parties pride i mean god gave us dominion that those things do not rule us but we rule them how do you rule them you cast them out you don't you don't welcome them into your house you don't welcome them into your life you don't make them a cup of tea or coffee and say sit down let's have a conversation you say we are not on speaking terms we are not i'm not here to have a conversation with you and my mind devil you're not welcome here hallelujah amen that's why we've got to we've got to get rid of familiar spirits amen depression reasoning skepticism unbelief doubt that can become part of someone but that's not the spirit of god amen aiming criticism sure ain't the spirit of god lust ain't the spirit of god and those are all familiar spirits that we are not ordained amen to have but the spirit of god is the one we should be familiar with and his spirit will cause you to believe the word that it's for you not just oh yeah those promises are true but for someone else no the promises are all mine my brother isaac was all over my notes last night a bit saying really a christian's all about what's for me every promise is mine and that's the only way you can help someone else to say lord where's all my promises you purchase them i want them lay hold upon every promise in the bible they're yours he died he died that you would receive them hallelujah so if it's my property i want it i just want to hear about it i want it hallelujah amen amen his spirit will amen his own word in your life that it's for you amen it won't be oh yeah but this person did this and this and this and this no no no that's not the spirit of god the spirit of god says amen it's for me thank you lord amen you see caleb caleb was maybe very familiar with the spirit of slavery because he was born under that spirit but that all changed when the light struck the lands hallelujah hallelujah that all changed when he realized it was more than moses giving promises but it was god god stepped down and was speaking through moses that'll change his life the slave mentality just went that spirit of slavery slavery left amen as as moses would say of caleb numbers 14 and 20 23-24 says surely thou shalt not see the land which i swear unto their fathers neither shall any of them that provoked me see it but my servant caleb because he had another spirit with him what was that another spirit that wasn't a different spirit of slavery that was the spirit of christ because he said we're more than able let's go right now let's go right now and get that land god has given us the land i know i've even picked out where i'm living i want to live there and he picked a place where the other there's a stronghold of the enemy he says i want that view i want that place do you care about the giants no because god says it's mine i want that one hallelujah and and then he spent the next i think 44 years because he 40 years in the wilderness i think four he was 84 when um you know i think about that when he actually got the promise but then he says to joshua after they've been taking the land says give me my mountain i'm as strong today as i was then give me what's mine i saw it 40 odd years ago i just don't want to talk about it anymore yo there comes a time where we go from just talking about the promise to possessing the promise holy there comes a time where it's actually not just a great hey it would have been awesome imagine imagine the atmosphere in his tent every night atmosphere of faith dad tell us about the promised land again tell us about the mountain again tell us about the grapes and the different things and where we're going to live and what's the view like and he'd say children i was a slave you can see my back there's the marks they're real we just weren't hypothetical slaves we're real slaves but moses came see that man over there he came glory and god used him in a mighty way and here we are we've been here 40 years but you know when i went to land with joshua we just got excited we just got excited because we were just coming out we were going in we were just coming out of the world now we're going into every divine promise of god and we just got so excited and we were playing that game that's mine the first one to say it was theirs you know how you know kids drive along my car your car my house your house sorry that sounds a bit ridiculous but you know you should like claim to everything you see in the world well i shouldn't be oh that's for that person no it's mine if you want to share it come join that's good but it's mine hallelujah so he'd begin to tell that and it would have generated faith in the home amen the other ones who didn't believe they were just would have been complaining about sand and trouble and whatever more and caleb and joshua they had the same stand in trouble right but they weren't looking at that they were looking beyond amen they're looking beyond to where they are their final destination hallelujah and we should look beyond the sand and trouble in life right we should look beyond those things look to the promise because remember remember doubt and worry never delivered anyone never we could take everyone if i could resurrect everyone from adam chronologically all the way down now we could ask them did did that worry help you it'd be no they'd take a while to do that but you know that would be the how'd that anxiety help you didn't help me none but then when the believer comes i'll say how did faith help you yes hallelujah faith delivered me faith brought down enemies brought the dead back to life again conquered conquered nations hallelujah heal the sick rose of death faith deliver me faith help me amen that's why we should never let complaining weaken our faith we should always be positive confession god is more than able doesn't matter what i see no matter what i hear now what i'm told i believe lord your word is true amen and you're here to fulfill it in my life hallelujah so caleb had a different spirit with him and it's i'm going to finish that verse and hath followed me fully him will i bring him to the land where unto he he went and his seed shall possess it what a promise i mean what you know we're a bunch of calebs we're a bunch of caleb's we're going to possess every divine promise because god is calling for it it wasn't just k remember whatever's got whatever's going on in here that's of god it was in god before it was in here right there's a deep calling to the deep amen so if there's a longing for the promise of god god wants to give you that promise because the deepest calling to the deep hallelujah it's not just in your mind a nice idea there's a longing lord there's got to be more to you than this lord i want that promise i've read in the word because it's the season god wants to give it to you that's not just us saying all this is going on you know there's been a swarming going on there's been excitement around the world hallelujah all the all the children god's children gathering together church walls are busted down we're all one big family what's that there's a swarming going on why because we're about to take a flight hallelujah what's dictating the flight it's the season it's god it's not it's not the ducks hello ducks how are you you know it's the season that we're in hallelujah just like it was god and caleb saying that's yours and then he says i want it because it's mine what was telling him that god was telling him amen if god can lead you to believe the promise of god it's yours when it's revealed to it's yours see it's yours hallelujah but you see you've got to hate the enemy then you can be free from him that's right you can never be free from an evil spirit that you enjoy you will never be free you worship it but if you hate that if you hate that spirit of depression you can be free from if you enjoy thinking like that then you won't be free or that spirit of lust or unforgiveness business criticism whatever if you enjoy that right then you cannot be free but you've got to hate that enemy enough then you can be set free see we've got to have a mentality that would rather die as free men and women than live as a slave that's how we should be i'd rather die as a free man amen then live as a slave amen yeah i think i said it a while ago i googled i heard i think brother ron spencer mentioned it so i googled that um the the percentage of taxation that the british uh the the american colonists were under when the revolution happened in america and it was between 1 and 1.5 percent taxation and it vexed them so much they had a revolution so i just bring into spiritual terms because who cares about the economy it can all be gone tomorrow we can walk out of these doors look at our phone in this and this whole nation's collapsed sri lanka's gone other ones are falling oh but we live here no we're just the same it's a global village so if one part is burning we're all on fire right but but we're not here to live don't get caught up in those things we have a divine promise of god amen amen so so if we just take that into the spiritual now between one percent they were they were so vexed just by one percent of 1.5 percent of the devil the devil taking that much of their life it vex them so much that they are willing to give their lives i think was in patrick henry or one of them said give me liberty or give me death he was determined a lot of those founding fathers that signed that declaration of independence gave their lives they were captured by the british tortured lost everything many were very wealthy people and they lost it all in that wall one of them um one of them actually has his estate or his house was captured by the british and there was cornwallis or one of the generals was using it as his headquarters and that man told told the general of the american army to fire his cannons at that house it was his house but the enemy was in his house and he wanted the enemy to get out of his house even it meant destruction of his house blow my house up the devil's in there hallelujah and that's how we should be he didn't say no no no i just painted that place you know how much yeah it's ever we put into that place and yeah we just put those rooms on it so no blow it up the devil's in it this is because they were all or nothing kind of people they were all or nothing just for a natural revolution if they were that in the natural how about the bride of christ we should be all or nothing stop christ is everything be everything for him happy don't be halfway be a hundred percent hallelujah amen suffer so if men could give their all for liberty yeah but we just had the fourth of july what it's become well that's what it's become but you know if we really go back to the core of it if people were so vexed by a little bit of taxation how much more you and i we don't want to be i trust that the natural doesn't type the spiritual where we're taxed however much and we just put up with it the devil takes a third of our life or 40 percent of our life or whatever well that's just the economy we no no no spiritual economy no that's not the spiritual economy the spiritual economy is the devil has no pardon me i have no part in him hallelujah amen you know sometimes we we need to go back and tell ourselves our own testimony to remember we need to give ourselves a good testimony meaning with ourselves you need to look in the mirror and tell yourself your testimony why because that takes slave mentality off that takes because the devil doesn't try and wear us down but we're not here to be worn down we're here to walk free but if he can wear you down you begin to forget who you are you become double-minded you become unstable in all your ways because you forget what god has done amen you need to tell even if he just called you you felt convicted that's god that's a supernatural thing that's that the greatest miracle you'll ever see is a transformed life full of the holy ghost i want to see missing limbs come back sure that can happen honestly cancers fall off we've seen those things right we've seen the power of god heal control the weather all different things but the greatest thing is when you see a person really born again by the spirit of god amen so because brother brown says on on that day on calvary what does calvary mean to you what did that day do to you did it make a stuffed shirt out of you or some theology oh did it make you a christian sold out hallelujah so you need to go back and think what did that day do to me hallelujah not just a historical fact what did it personally do when by faith you saw the lamb of god take your sins away carry them up calvary that day purchase your salvation ransom you from the grip of the devil hallelujah i am excited if you wanted a lecture you've come to the wrong place vic unis that way but you see you see what did it do to you transform god has called us from darkness into light it wasn't us that decided no god did it for you hallelujah amen and why did he do it because it's like out of egypt i've called my son out of the world i've called my bride hallelujah hallelujah now what i love about the time of exodus is moses was equipped to conquer every every thing the pharaoh could throw at him before and all the pressures before it ever happened before it ever happened he was fully equipped brother ram said that moses uh you know moses after god had given him 40 years more of teaching 80 years old could you imagine how ridiculous to the carnal mind that would be here was moses in the presence of the burning bush was better equipped in five minutes in the presence of god than 80 years schooling that he had so 40 years in the in the egyptians and he was schooled on the back slide of the desert his brother ahmad said on wednesday but those eight years five minutes in the presence of the burning bush did more for him equipped them prepared and better than all that 80 years of his life and you know you know we can come into this that same presence this morning where the burning bush can step down into our presence and god can speak to you and equip you better than all of your life all your theology all your criticism whatever more and equip you for the battle that you're gonna face hallelujah that same god still visits and equips his people the same way what is it it's a supernatural visitation where god remember he was he was he moses actually was actually he got used to living well below his privilege he was god's predestinated ordained deliverer and he was growing and and and where was he he ran ran from his calling raising his family on the back side of the desert and that was that he just thought that's my lot but god said no you may think that's your lot you may think unbelief is your light and just living this way is your life but then god says no there's a season where it's going to change hallelujah and god visited him and called him out and we could get used to well i'm just never going to get free of this thing i'm never going to overcome this thing i'm just going to be this way the whole time no no god is here for a total liberty amen god is here for a total total liberty hallelujah now who's got the holy ghost here who's got the holy ghost here you know we fall into everything christ died for right now right now it's ours it says in romans 8 and 15 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear suppose you say you have not received a spirit of slavery like you came out of that spirit that drove your life in the world full of unbelief and strife and religion whatever more you don't you haven't received that again but you receive the spirit of adoption where you cry abba father is my father my father i know god is my father hallelujah amen the spirit and we know adoption is the placing of a son or daughter so what is the placing of a son and daughter of god to stand on the neck of the enemy that's where our position is remember joshua called the you know grabbed the five kings out of the cave and got the other men say put your feet on the neck of the enemy in other words i want you to experience dominion over this guy hallelujah and that's what he wants for us today put your foot on his neck amen amen hallelujah and if children then ears ears of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be glorified together i mean so we're joining us with god i know this is nothing new but here we are but everything that the lord jesus died for we fall is too that's what a joint here is they earn it but we get part of it right we we we fall air to everything they fell here too hallelujah so everything the lord jesus fell here to we have fallen here to as well it's ours amen and we have received brother brown calls it an abstract title deed in the upper room now just bear with me as i read this and we in jesus christ by spiritual baptism not by water by spirit we are baptized into one body which is christ the worshiping place then being in there we being on this ground it's like the abstract deed you say i bought a piece of ground it isn't yours yet until you got an abstract but if you've got an abstract it shows that everything that was ever against this piece of ground has been striking off and when you become a christian and accept christ as your savior then when god sends down the abstract which is the baptism of the holy ghost it shows no matter what your father did what your mother did what anyone else did your mother daddy might have been drunkards prostitutes whatever it was every sin is stricken off you've got an abstract title there's nothing can put you off of it and look everything that's on that grounds belongs to you what grounds it the word everything on that grounds belongs to you amen and when you're in christ jesus by the baptism of the holy ghost every gift of god belongs in the church amen it's an abstract title deed it's yours it belongs to you it quickens your mortal bodies oh my if we think of it let us take a look at those faithful ones at pentecost they were all in the upper room there and they was all scared they had they had the title all right but that was afraid and all at once there came a sound from heaven the abstract came down to them like a rushing mighty wind filled all the house where they were sitting and they were so quick and that till all their cowardness one of them was afraid they even denied um that even tonight he wasn't a pharisee it wasn't a sadducee yet but when the holy ghost fell and baptized them into jesus christ he became flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of his word he was a new creation he was a new person it quickened his body look at what it did and what it does to you when it comes in it doesn't make you go out and say i'm a methodist i'm a baptist oh i know i ought to smoke i want to do this i want to wear those kind of clothes i want to do this i or i ought to do that it's so quick and you till you have to do it it quickens your mortal body i mean so when you receive the holy ghost every promise is yours every promise hey that's enough every promise is yours why not go in and possess it amen hallelujah amen now moses was not a compromiser now here we come to you because as i said in the beginning that god plagued egypt through moses right through through him and now god has raised us up to bring plagues and judgments upon satan's kingdom amen because we're here to tear satan's kingdom down amen amen his spiritual demon powers and high places controlling people complexes pains and hurts and different things we're here to tear them all down by the power of jesus christ amen so now moses was not a compromiser pharaoh tried to say well just take the adults or just take this or leave your cattle behind or you know but moses was not a compromiser he says no we're not leaving one hoof behind we're not leaving a single israelite we're not leaving anything that is ours everyone's coming with us if they can't walk we're gonna pack them amen we're not leaving one hoof behind that was his determination he wasn't there just to have a 50 deliverance or a 14 deliverance 80 deliverance 100 deliverance that was purposed in his heart everyone's coming hallelujah and that's how we should be today amen amen well we should not be a compromiser with the devil amen but everything that god jesus died for is ours and we're going to take it amen that's the way the church ought to be we'll take righteousness we'll take holiness we'll take the holy spirit we'll take a unified group when we go to the altar we'll be a real group we'll kneel we'll leave nothing behind we'll take everything there will not be one hoof stay back there you know the people can pray in such a way till the devil will have to give it and remember the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much not avail the little avail as much amen so when you pray it avails much hallelujah it shakes the kingdom of hell that's how you bring plagues and trouble on his kingdom as when you call god on the scene hallelujah amen because we have the right today amen to plague the devil's kingdom until he has to give in hallelujah amen you think about the position roon right now in the church of living god this morning lays power to heal all sickness in the church of living god this morning lays the power to overcome all temptation in the possession of the church the living god are you the church of the living god today good i'm talking about you this morning lays the power to change sin and throw it away and receive the baptism of the holy ghost in the church of jesus christ whatsoever you desire ask in my name it shall be given to you a little while the world not thee not the un so so the world which is the unbeliever will see me no more but yet you'll see me for i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world what that to that royal seed which is you the works that i do shall you do also i'll verify myself that i'm with you for these signs shall follow them that believe he shall possess the seed of his enemy he shall possess his seed shall possess the gate of his enemy rather no matter what the gate is if it's sickness temptation sin whatever gate it is it's conquered and the seed of abraham possesses it aren't you happy this morning to know that we stand now more than a conqueror more than a conqueror oh there's nothing to fight about the fight's over the whistles blowed the flag's being rose and in the midst of every sin pile every mitz of every sick room is the old rugged cross planted by the blood of jesus christ to conquer the only thing we have to do now is look and live hallelujah amen so if we are if we are here this morning and god has called us to have a total liberty a total victory because this is the season i say let's plague the d demons of hell until remember pharaoh they're actually relieved when mo yo when moses rights left that's why they gave them great spoil and said go on your way be gone okay you know you know we are such a torment you know we are the devil's devil a devil is a tormentor and we are actually here our lives torment him because here's a people he came against you know once upon a time he came against us we stumbled and fell right but now when you really meet the lord there's now another power within you sure it was sin nature governed your life then that got dethroned and then god himself came and faith came in right and now he comes against you with the same things now he stumbles on false that's right and so now nothing nothing can stop a believer it doesn't matter what the devil throws against him and this torments satan because there's a people here because remember he came against jesus and he couldn't conquer him hallelujah and now there's a people on the earth made in his image they cannot be conquered hallelujah they cannot be bought maybe they can be you know he can he can trip us up now and then but you know we can't actually there's nothing in us that can say well i'm just going to give up and quit that's right that's right there's no turning back there's nothing to go back to i don't want to go back there amen but the but the israelites under this slave mentality still said let's go back to egypt but caleb said no we're going this way we're not going that way there's no reverse on this boat we're going straight hallelujah amen so this so he's within us i trust you feel that way i'm not going back to the world if the world is so great why are we here at the world is so great why did we come out hallelujah you know yeah it's really that simple really people if we're honest we do really what the best thing is so why aren't we there i wasn't raised in this god found me that's right oh he found me so if this is if this is if there's nothing to this why am i here hallelujah but there's everything to this maybe if god has called us out there more well let's let's just keep pressing on so we're here see sickness comes in trouble comes in you make it feel real unwelcome in your home you begin to pray you mean yo because it's the spirit that comes in you pray you begin to worship god comes down the devil hates the anointing of god it makes him shake in his boots he trembles when the anointing comes in hallelujah brother abraham said that the devil got into the car then one day he says well i'm going to sink you all the way and he begin to sing yeah because remember the devil sometimes we think well i need to be void of the enemy then i can really worship but the bible says he sets the table before me the prince of my enemies right so it seems a strange thing to me where you would invite someone that you don't want but you're going to buy them to a feast you're going to come watch me eat devil oh you know that's a bit of an odd odd thing but that's what god wants to do because god if god wants to prove the power of his blood he wants to prove it in your life that's why that's why it's not well in the millennium i'll shout and praise god or when i get no no it's now because what you are here is what you'll be there i'll have victory one day no now's the day of victory but when this body's changed then i'll be able to overcome it no no you ever come now right now you don't have to put up with this thing ruling your life amen because the blood of jesus christ cleanses from all sin puts a new nature and your holy ghost steps in and changes your life hallelujah so we shouldn't settle for anything less amen we're here to plague his kingdom others and why christ speak he says now notice this how beautiful i love this you know finally pharaoh said get out see they came to a point get out of this place they were so tormented they couldn't put up with it anymore all the plagues and trouble he said just get out god just plagued them with the voice of moses god wants to plague the devil with your voice you've got to address your enemy it's not please mr devil can you no satan you listen to me you listen to me you're not the boss around here your own belief is not welcome in this house your filthy unbelieving ways are not welcome in my mind this may be the battleground but why does it have to be like always a pushing back and pushing forward this should be like in world war one they set up trenches and things that that that what's called in like in the military a depth of defense where it's actually just a killing zone for the enemy this is what this should be in a way it shouldn't be the devil comes in just sets up his camp and just rules our lives that's where the devil comes in and we just blast him away with the word so i'm not familiar with you devil i just this thinking is foreign to me this is not a familiar spirit amen amen that's how it should be and we cast them out hallelujah amen god just plagued them with the voice of moses amen he struck everything he done everything there was to be done i mean he put the sun down the middle of the day he done everything he blackened the days he brought frogs flies lice everything else fire smoke death was to the families everything else he'd done everything till finally pharaoh had to say get out take all you got and go oh praise be to god then he says i'm so glad that a man can so completely serve god till the devil don't know what to do with them that's why i just obeyed god so completely till the devil said oh my get away i don't want to hear it no more that's right you can do it so completely hallelujah amen amen so we can so completely serve god be surrendered to him that the devil doesn't know what to do with us and it vexes him so much he just says now get out he's going to be relieved when this rapture goes the devil's going to be oh finally those people that caused me so much trouble i came against him i stumbled and fell i said another spirit had failed do you imagine what you know what hell is like when the devil sets an assignment against you and the devils once upon a time said well that's an easy job that's like a that's like a you know a working holiday all right it's easy to knock those ones around but then god stepped in and that same spirit comes against you it comes with broken limbs busted up face comes down into hell staggers into the work room what happened to you well i got sent to so-and-so's house and then the devil says okay the spirit go there no i'm not going hey man i'm not gone you know what happened last time i've still got this body cast on satan i can't do it you know it should be such a vexation to the devil that he trembles even at the thought of coming against you because of the god that's within you hallelujah amen so when this rapture goes he's going to be real happy that we're gone because there's no opposing force anymore in the gentile world that will stop him doing what he wants to do the devil thinks he can run free reign but then he comes against you you know goliath had a string of victory until he came against david and david was predestinated anointed of god aiming to kill goliath goliath was on his rampage as a shepherd boy anointed ordained to tear that giant down hallelujah that's the same thing with you and i the devil can fight all the way through whole bunch of people nations everything but then he comes against a predestinated son or daughter of god that giant's coming down amen so we shouldn't cower remember the devil may have a track history but god's got to track history too hallelujah and my god is always greater than him so don't be intimidated by the devil say well this is just how it is it's in the family we're stuck with this who said that's right david just said who's this guy he's uncircumcised who's this uncircumcised philistine basically saying i said i think last week who's this one who has no covenant with god and we have a covenant with god we're god's people he's coming to our land and why is no one fighting him amen it should be the same thing with you and i the devil doesn't have a covenant with god that's good the only promise god made is i'm going to destroy you that was his promise right but he gave a covenant with us saying you'll be the head and not the tail i mean in my name you'll cast out demons right you have a peace to pass all understanding you'll be made in my image giant speakable full of glory amen that's the covenant he made with you that when he sees you he sees himself hallelujah he says the word made flesh so now why should we put up with anything but total deliverance amen amen amen amen if we're here to plague satan's kingdom i say this stop letting him plague you [Music] you say well the pressure's on it's just bricks and straw it's just bricks and straw don't be don't be sidetracked by those things keep your eyes on the promise of god keep your eyes on the promise because this is the season of deliverance the more the devil kicks the closer he is to being cast out it's a principle so the worse it gets the greater it is hallelujah so the more you say that's so like opposite because you think surely if the devil's doing nothing then we rejoice no no the more he does the more praises we should give god because he's on his way out right and he puts pressure on you because you're actually walking out you know they were built for an exodus the israelites were built for that exodus we're built for a rapture right we're not built to be slaves down here we're built for a rapture i mean so if we're built for this rapture we should keep that promise around us saying no we're not leaving one hoof behind me we can pray until the devil has to give in right for our family for our loved ones whoever it may be amen if god has revealed you their coming hallelujah praise him and give him give him glory his word says the promise unto you and to your children those who are far off as many as the lord our god shall call so someone can be so the children the holy ghost is for them i'm in acts chapter two those that are far off so i'm going to be far away from god they can be living in the same house as you but they'll be far away from god it's for them and this means the lord our god shall call so the promise worked on you it'll work on them hallelujah so don't look at the bricks and the straw what they're acting up the devil and what he's doing look at the promise keep the promise for you say lord your promise is a yay amen amen we don't look at what we see and bring plagues down a pot remember moses i just i just finished with this moses rod turned into a serpent and on the pharaoh's crown a part of it was a cobra remember he was a god of you know pharaoh was considered god over that nation and so moses went in the first sign he did is is dropped his staff down on the ground or aaron did it turn into the serpent and he picked up it turned into a staff and god was actually telling satan i can bind you i can loose you i can bind you it's not you that says now i'm going to cause trouble now no i can bind you i can loose you as much as i want to and that power is in you amen you combine the devil you can loose the devil you can bind them it's not member the moon rules the darkness amen rules the night amen it's not the other way around so it's not the devil ruling us no we have dominion over him but god wants you to open your lips and speak to your enemy amen let's have the musicians this morning we're sons and daughters of god hallelujah amen praise the lord our god is great if we can just see where he's lifted us up out
