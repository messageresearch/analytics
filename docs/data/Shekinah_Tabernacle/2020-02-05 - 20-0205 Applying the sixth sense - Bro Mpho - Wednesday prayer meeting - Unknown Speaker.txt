something that we can just talk about it Lord but is real father and Lord as you come here this evening we take this a great privilege for us to touch you to come in your holy presence of God and I pray tonight Lord Jesus that you'll come in speak to your children each one father has come with their different needs for God different expectations Heavenly Father and I pray Lord that you as you promise in your way it will come and fulfill and give them that which they need father God provide the answers to your children those that have got questions father at the end of the service father God your name will take glory and honor you commit the service into thy hands Heavenly Father that take away all our men would and all our men way father they got away all our our thinking take out all our our ways of doing things father as human beings father and come in the service father and forgive us our wrongs father we know that we are not perfect Lord but you are perfect Lord and that is why we invite you in this service that that the devil who who comes and and disrespect your father tonight he can be exposed we commit the service into your hands as we welcome your presence now in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you I'm sorry for my language my English is not so good so may the Lord bless you as I greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and may God richly be your provider tonight because as for me I've got nothing that I can provide for you amen but we thank the musicians you can take your sister Isaac thank you very much for creating the atmosphere together with brothers and sisters may God bless you while we are standing let's just read the book of Hebrews chapter 11 brother maybe you can just put for us there at presentation just the first page oh if it's possible I forgot to ask for that little thing to press I like it amen god bless you I mean while we are we are on our feet in respect and honor of the Word of God as the Prophet taught us let's read hebrews chapter let's read Hebrews chapter 11 I mean if you they just say Amen now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which were seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by eight he being dead yet speaketh verse five by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony Alleluia that he pleased God less six but without faith it is impossible to please him who God am i right for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is the rewardin he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him maybe we can just pray again Heavenly Father Lord I don't have the waist fathom as I'm standing here I'm just I'm feeling empty I don't know how and where to start Lord but I just want to commit these ways that we have read into thy hands that Lord you can just come and take away all our abilities what we think we can do because we can't do nothing may you come and preach to your children and talk to them in your own way inspire the service inspire their hearts inspire the lips father we commit the sin listen to thy precious hands in Jesus Christ wonderful name amen amen you may enjoy the seats the comfort of your seats while I remain standing and tonight I'm just in as I told you last time I'm not a minister as the so called minister but I'm just a brother whom I want to relate with you on what we talked about and that we can see the thought that I'm trying to to bring to you amen after all we read from the message and then we try to repeat what the Prophet have said is very difficult to preach after Sunday service because you know when they say you need to walk this road and someone walks it in ten minutes another one or last Wednesday walks it in five minutes and they do they keep a record now when you come and you know you can run that Jenny in such a time you feel insignificant but the Lord is the one who's significant tonight amen how many I happy to be in the service of the Lord if I say anything that doesn't go well with you just know that I'm actually referring to myself I'm preaching to myself but I pray that the Lord will bless your heart amen tonight all of us to take a thought a thought that emanates from the message is that the Prophet spoke that says applying the sixth sense amen and then there are many different ways you know how we do things and this the sixth sense you know it's not your common sense am i right I'm not talking about the common sense you know there's many senses in life I mean so we some talk about the common sense you know we taught you tell someone something and he says no that doesn't make sense but they say no that doesn't have class that does not have common sense oh no I don't it's not sensitive or any other perspective that a sense can be explained they are there but the cells that we are talking about tonight is the sixth one I mean the Prophet calls it the super sense amen and he also calls it the sixth sense amen amen when I say I mean I would like you to say aim then you you are helping me to not to be too nervous and sorry my African accent can get a bit hard sometimes but I mean good I mean well I mean so we are going to look at just three or three points three points that we are going to look at tonight the first one is what is what is it what is this sixth sense I mean what what are we talking about when we talk I know you know but we just want to come to a point where they say in English we refresh you know we click a refresh button on the computer and and at any and you you do what we call a refresher course right and and you do another an introspection and introspection it means you go back to yourself and look if you are still reflecting the mirror of the word of God amen so look at what what what is it what is this a sixth sense amen and then we'll talk about the purpose of the five senses because as I said to you there are many senses right and some you can touch them you can see them some some you can hear about them the senses but we will look at the specific ones that were god-given they are called the five senses they were god-given you'll see as we go along why I'm saying they are god-given and then lastly we'll talk about the pimples and application of The Sixth Sense amen how should this extends be applied why is it important well what is the pepper I can reason why we talked about this sixth sense I mean are we together now let's just start with this one what is it this sixth sense you see there where we have read now before we go there let's let's just say what what is the sixth sense we know that the Prophet taught us and the Bible taught us that is faith am i right but now look some people will explain it differently and say maybe it's a gift and it's some who says a foundation someone says they believe some will say yeah is the Holy Spirit ah isn't it worry and some will say is revelation or experience every individual can have a view or an opinion about what is the sixth sense I mean but the fact of the matter is that as we have read in the book of Hebrews the Bible says it is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen that is what faith is and that's what the Bible says we can explain we can do so many things but and we can still be right but the most pre-canned an invisible intangible explanation the Bible says faith is the substance of things hoped for that's the six things we are talking about and it is the evidence of things not seen that's a powerful statement that statement is what you call loaded you know it sir is there someone in itself it needs to be unpacked and unpacked it will take another three hours just to talk about this that this one and then that is the substance of things hoped for ah then the mind start to think what does this mean what does this verse mean and it goes on it says is the evidence of things not seen I've never heard of any language like that in the whole world I will if I only find it in the Bible I've never heard of a language where they tell you that something because a substance is something that is attachable but if something that is the effect an effect one of my old friends said what is the effect effects effect huh its effect so when we talk about substance it has got its own history where you can go in the dictionary and read but a very proper proper way is the scriptural way right is there things substance of their things hoped for the evidence of things unseen evidence is proof you know proof how can I tell you that it is a proof of things not seen I mean even in the court of law they'll say what are you talking about have you seen him no I have not seen him but you say you've got the evidence you say no no is the evidence of things not seen they say put this guy in jail because you cannot explain what you cannot bring the evidence as far as the worldly level is concerned and I can tell you for those of you who are thinking I had you can already say that ha if there isn't like that they are reasoning within the five senses you see but the moment you go beyond the five senses now you're talking about the evidence that you cannot see but it is the evidence it is the proof that is what faith is about amen so let's just take it one step further and say a look at firstly what is there listen why we have this so-called five senses we know them don't we can anyone tell me one five senses Debbi smell what we touch touch touch my girl that it would Jesse taste very good becquer fill up what good children money and I don't see others raising hands Jonathan here very good my boy right explicitly pens for this children another manís are not wasting time so I can assure you these children they know what you're talking about and we say feel smell touch and sorry feel smell touch see and tastes those those are the five senses that we are talking about and I'll tell you what those senses were given by God they were given by God for them to benefit us we may say that now we can yes it's true the Prophet says you do it but we don't use them to contact God yes does anybody get that point but does it go above your head we I'm using my mouth to pray right I'm using my eyes to read the Bible I'm using my well I can smell you know I'm my touch I touch my brother I feel the love huh but yet I'm saying that you cannot use them to approach God what do I mean by that because they were not meant to contact God that is why when we lead in this in this message here the Prophet says in the message faith is the sixth sense 11 June 1916 now notice that these senses that this census was given to you only only to contact the Ethne home are you are we together that you might see taste feel smell and hear but they are by no means to lead you they are not meant to lead you yes you utilize them as your channels but they are not meant to to lead you as far as contacting God is concerned they are meant for you to contact your earthly home predominantly and let us say totally totally not even partially totally amen and the Prophet continues in that sermon he says but we stumble at it you see it is not enough we we depend too much on these five and that's the problem we depend too much on our five senses until they almost want to take the space of the six since and that's what the Prophet is trying to warn us about he says and when well and and and when most of the time to 95 percent of the people or better what do you mean is that 95 percent or a path that's very scary as soon as they see the five senses is finished we stop them so we don't go way past the five senses we stop by the person's like happy oh I'm like this oh I'm seeing this then we stop at the pass senses but meanwhile we have another sense which is called a sixth sense which an actual effect is supposed to be above is supposed to lead us to pass through the five senses are we together and so we would only have to wait there because the five senses have got the end some way they stuff somewhere they in some way that's what the Prophet says that that well is gone dig my grave get my casket ready that go on finished it's done done brother in the city so so it's not supposed to be that way because the five senses you when you are born you are given those ones and then you get your casket it's done with the persons but this one that we are talking about the Bible says that that's three through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God through faith you see this kind of a sense that we are talking about it doesn't start when you are born no no it made the world it makes the app it made everything that you can see and those things that you can see faith made them that's the cells that we are talking about that's the sense that I'm trying to say we have to operate from that one are we together let's read furthermore sorry today I'm just gonna read I'm gonna talk I'm not going to talk a lot I'm just gonna read a lot I mean the Prophet says in the super-sense 27 December 59 God gave us those senses but they are given to us a gift I read in there they were given to us si why is it here can everybody see this one they are given to us as a gift s alluded earlier now they are given to us as a gift the key is it depends on how you want you what you use these senses to us and that's where the real things begins here because these gifts and they are dependable on you now the question is on me then Who am I then what what what sense do I use for me to be able to channel or to yield those senses that means this I'm honest in some way but sense that is supposed to yield these senses to direct some way because listen to this will be the way that you your life is controlled you see the way you use those five senses what do you see what you hear what you taste smell or feel whatever those senses are yielded to that they will dominate you right now you are seasoned believers and message readers I believe in the way in the Bible there's two senses in the heart of men faith and doubt now how can i without without using this very five senses how can I control and yield them or what must what tool must I use there must be another sense that is more superior that is more powerful that is more dominant that I must yield but I must channel these five senses so that they must not control but they can be controlled damn these five senses are we together Hannah amen the Prophet goes on to talk about the story or to give us an example and say that you see if I've got eyes now as you can see me and then he says that though if I can just deny to see I just type myself I find myself here and I say no no I don't want to see or I practice in my ear I don't want to hear and I continue and do that continuously right he said the Prophet that I'm eventually my eyesight will be affected and he says that a I do that and my son come and I teach him that kind of a thing I'm also binding he does that to his children twisty eventually will be a generation of people that are blind because we refuse to see and yet God has given us a sense to see so eventually we will be a blind generation but God has given us a sense what I mean by the brothers and sisters is that the sense that God has given us which is called the sixth sense it must be utilized otherwise it becomes a generation of faithless people and then it becomes a generation of people who are Christians but they don't have the faith but yet God has given them that sense because that sense it doesn't start when you are born brother Arnold it gets given to you before you are born is yours it's just like the gift that God has given you of eyesight and everything when you are born you are given but that one God has given it to you as a Christian and the Prophet says somewhere that is only given to Christians huh he's given only to Christians isn't it I mean that's what the Prophet says I'm read it for you later on you'll see now let's just continue I also pleased to my wife now what is the purpose of these five senses as we as we as we move on the five senses where they are very important and the Prophet is acknowledging this is the five senses are very important to contact the air we live in not to be guided and control you he's very is very clear and particular about that we cannot utilize them because these five senses they can mislead you and they can lie to you but the fixin's cannot lie to you you see that is the key the first senses that we have that are very important that we contact our our earth with as far as God is concerned as far as our destiny is concerned as far as the best things that will give us eternal life are concerned they can lie to you they can lie to you you can just know one of us you can know tell me that one of your five senses never lied to you the fact that you got sick that means your senses were lying to you because you are not sick did everyone hear me if you say you are sick and you go to the doctor it is your five senses lying to you because you are not sick and don't accept it because you are not sick that's only the operation of the five senses that will make you believe that you are sick meanwhile you are not that's how the sixth sense work it it works isn't it was with is an evidence of things that you can see with the five senses by the way let me be clear when he says is evident when Paul says the evidence of things not seen it it means not seen by this eyes but with your spiritual eyes you see those things am I am i alive so now the sixth sense cannot lie to you but they the ice I can just look at what the James leg did and then my eyes and my and my mind says ah that doesn't like you and I can't even say I mean I know and I don't know then I say a father is not here is not in his busy thinking that the five senses can tell you things that are not they can lie to you that is why you cannot depend on the five senses that is why you cannot listen to them for you to get a true fact the effect of the five senses is not really affect because someone can prove it wrong that is why I'm saying your five senses can lie to you amen that is why because I'm looking I'm talking to you now it is important for you to go home to read the spoken ways but I'm referring today so that may be my one of my five senses have made a mistake as write to you not kept asleep but you can go and verify and say ah my brother senses they just almost made a mistake and you read and you refer to the spoken word and you get the real genuine thing am i right that is that is that the five senses have got strong limitations and that is why we can not depend on them always my advice to you if you can write it down always question the decision of your five senses always question the judgment of the five sense all the time and school they teach us that we must critically analyze we must analyze critically you know what they mean is that you must put an idea or a thought even if it's your thought they teach us this and they say you must critically evaluate it what do you mean is that you must go and test and it criticize your own work and thoughts why because you can't trust them that's what they mean actually you cannot trust another researcher go and make a research and an with based on the facts of that time ten years later another research come and prove that a defect wrong what happened because you cannot depend any life on the five senses today they say this tomorrow they say that today they say you are sick tomorrow they say you are not see today is the headache tomorrow is their eyes what exactly am i sick on here five senses huh because they can lie to you because the devil can wet through them it's a prayer meeting tonight I can take long let's move on and get to the next slide and then this is the the core of what I want I want to talk about the papers and an application of this sixth sense as everybody understands me now hebrews chapter 11 out out let's read it again but verse six only but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him out like us just to pause a second on that note brother Phil just listen to that to that verse how low that it is to say that it is impossible to please him but then how do I get this thing called faith if I must have it too please God how do I get it that is another same one brother for brother nd for he that cometh to God must believe that he is a rewarder when you have when you come to God and you believe use faith to believe am i right and you believe that God he rewards you he gives you the faith then from there he rewards you but you need to dhimmi gently and I highlighted those words on purpose because there are key ways I used to have a teacher when he comes to a point he says key learning point that means you must write that one he's going to ask you in the exam key learning points here ah that one it is impossible to please God without faith secondly you order he rewards you but he doesn't just reward you he won't you if you diligently seek Him hallelujah now doesn't doesn't take no I wrote there that faith doesn't take no for an answer no no no no no in the vocabulary of faith you don't find the word no or is not possible or any negative thought you don't find it in the English in the vocabulary of faith you can't find that but not in an arrogant way no no no no no in a more hopeful way in a more purposeful positive way you don't find negativity in faith you only find yes because why it is impossible for God to lie because it's impossible for God to fail that is why when you want one God thought about creating me and you it was already a reality I was talking to someone I said the source of God are real there they are sup their substantive they are not like my thoughts and your thoughts when God thinks that thing that he's thinking he's excited so that is why when he said let there be light yo he goes he's thought about it face isn't it because you cannot have faith before you hear something or before you think of some or before you process something in your mind no no you you have faith because something has happened first then you want to believe then you believe or you doubt right so exactly with God before you could create he thought he said and he thought this was busy thinking everything that you see here today and the thing that has passed and the thing where are still coming in this thing called time went through in his mind can you believe it including the number of your hair how many you are going to lose a day how much you're going to get annually huh even today is sister wow he he knows how much hair have you lost even knows how much hair have grown from your head and that was in the mind of God when he created me and you isn't that lovely that is powerful but now when you want him of this word faith there's powerful ways that come as the Bible says you think of diligently persistent insistently fervently relentlessly when one day says you do something relentlessly if you watch a wild life or you know some of the wild animals there's an animal called a honey badger who knows the Anabella that animal is a relentless hunter it does not take no for an answer I'm not saying we are like that anymore I'm just comparing you know the Bible also says that we must be wise like say pansy you know that but refrain from sin like drafts all right the Bible can give such example some I'm following the footsteps of the Bible but how many bells is so relentless you know it can find a black mamba it goes for the black mamba and the honey goes for the black mamba along three meters or 4 meters long of him black mamba the honey badger goes for it ha it's built like that nothing it goes for the black mamba and it catches the black the black mamba will hit it he tries it right out and the black mamba think remember the black mamba once he buys you in two times three times he's powerless now it was only wait wait there and wait until it gain strength so the honey badger will die half half did it rodella it loose it like they didn't then maybe it stands up again it goes for the black mamba it's going to sniff and save it and finds it and takes it an easy from tail to head to tail and a finish it as soon as it finished a black mamba it goes for therefore the green one if you hunt the rodents how many know rodents it will hunt the rodents it will and it will go inside you know here in New Zealand you record what you call it the this what is this wonderful honey brother feels the manuka it goes for the manuka peace honey betcha doesn't matter how hard the steam of the manuka bees it goes for that one for those ones I saw them there B is those big ones isn't it it goes for those ones there it goes inside that behind and it is that honey as if the bees are not biting it stops at nothing don't tell her honey badger that you'll die no no no no no it won't listen to you it was the honey and that's what me and you are supposed to be if the devil says you're not here you don't listen to that if the devil says you don't have the Holy Ghost you don't wait you don't listen you tell you I have the hill ghosts you tell the better that I am healed even if today the devil has tipped you Caleb for example you go my brother you go and tell him that pain you know a honey badger you are rememb am the honey badger and I'm going to do destroy you today you and your present and your lineage I'm going to kill you today I hope it's listening the devil amen so you think of those words you know when you think of an enemy like a honey badger a diligent instant insistent you insist you know you persists you know you know you know that parable that the Lord told his disciple I can't remember the chapter and talks about that man who has nothing but the king and he was no Qi and until the King said no no you know what this guy he's annoying me now is getting to my name's give him what he wants that man he was he was persistent he saw nothing else except what he was asking for and he was not fighting he was just persistent I don't want to say pushy because you know pushy has got some attitude so so hope hopefully against hope that's that's how faith or the sixth sense works it works in a very strange way it doesn't work like our senses our senses go to a point I say hold on I'm tired 6:10 says no you're not tired citizens once you being tired according to the scientific definition that you are exhausted from work but ahead but the sixth sense is no no you are not well se of some primitive the plummeting you forget that you are tired and what happened to me no you are listening to the wrong guy saying that you are tired face come the anointing of the Holy Spirit come and annoys you and you forget that you have had only one you finished that man become is ouya you're tired now he's okay fine I'm gonna I'm gonna sleep but before the prayer when the main team was high when you are under the anointing I tell you if you ever went through the unrelenting you can testify to this but you won't even hear or feel or think about what you were feeling before you came for prayer that's how the sixth sense wake is the powerful strange sense amen let's move to the next slide and we're going to finish shortly I want to read for you from again that faith is the sixth sense if you don't use your six senses they become they become they become dormant remember I touched about this earlier on when the Prophet spoke about the eyesight if you fought them and you you you you you you tamper with one of your senses right you will affect that sense eventually until that is no more functioning the way God gave you if not completely lost that man who used to brother branham spoke about in India if I'm not mistaken who was a Sun worshipper and he got blind because of watching the Sun all the time what these were not men twice the Sun it'll hurt you so he was watching the wrong thing not using the eyesight the way that is suppose then he got blind the more you take your eyes and use them into the worldly things or the things that are not supposed to help you spiritually your blood yourself you are using your eyes in such a way that is not going to benefit your sixth sense you take your mouth you tell us your feelings you take your even eating you eat wrong things if it tastes is included in here I'm not talking for those who are doing diet I mean we don't drink certain things isn't it that's why we are Nasr eyes we don't drink we don't we don't we don't share those kind of food that were meant for for the gods now if you come to my country you'll hear even here there's a lot of cultural things that we don't do and you know prophet James spoke last week about things that that we do an away and we let our children you know they do games and then those things are put an impact and yet we are using our five senses to do them these guys they'll lie to you these guys I will show you now how God has given us to use them and afford papers I'm gonna show you now I mean let's move on quickly do not use them in your wrong way do not I mean if you do not use your sixth sense it becomes dormant and that's the point I almost lost the sixth sense which is faith like any other sense it needs to be utilized you know that faith without works is dead why did God give us faith as believers so that we can use it in the spoken retro firm faith is the substance if I'm not mistaken the Prophet says and I don't mean you but the profile says sometimes we say we've got faith and we don't have it but we think we have it the five senses tell us that we have it but we don't H make sure that we have the faith and we say yeah I've got the faith but if you have the faith it must demonstrate itself the faith must be able to say I am sick guilt done I am I'm looking for a job done give it I'm looking for this done that's how this extends with it stops at nothing if you are looking for something before the Lord and you are a daughter and a son god don't stop at nothing until you get that because because you are a daughter and a son of God you receive this word of God you send in God with a clear heart use you do everything and then you've got your right before God to say father though I am nothing but you you give God reasons and you promise you you take God the Prophet says to take take gaunt and and and and and how does he say what did he say he says then I forgot how you put your paraphrasing you know like like taking God on on his weight you know taking him on on what you say because he said in his way whatever that you shall ask in my name I will give you to you and the Bible says that if you are a son and a daughter of God filled with the Holy Spirit what is it that is going to prevent you from getting what you want what is it can hunger do that can can torture can can can heat can can flap can can can what can prevent you from that so you can see that when the Prophet talks about this kind of things that somewhere somewhere when we assess ourselves we realize that we are under shorting ourselves we are short-circuiting ourselves I don't have a better word but we are under privilege in ourselves by not utilizing our feet our sixth sense sufficiently right so we need to use it and sometimes he says to profit in that in what spoken weight I think is also phrases and substance he says that you'll be surprised that an unbeliever comes here to the altar and he gets prayed and he's healed and a seasoned Christian comes and does not get healed why because me and you think that we have arrived we are still in a battle we have not arrived our our sixth sense must work for us even more than an unbeliever and unbelievers the prostitute you tell her that you are a prostitute and you must repent and come here to the altar she says yes I'm a prostitute she comes here she gets healed she just delivered millennia the Bible tells us that means that teaches us from here that you must leave this business we reason with it because we think we are Christians we think we are have arrived can you see can you see where we understood and not the devil he knows that hey this one's if I leave them they'll catch and use that faith and if this one's use it I'm dead so let's be careful of that point and not allow our sixth sense to be dormant I want to jump and read on the yellow pad raises so you see it is lack of faith but that's been preached into the people lack of faith this thing called lack of faith is the one that is being preached lack of faith is being preached into the people but that makes them let thus that sixth sense which is faith lay dormant I don't know if anyone gets it lack of faith is being taught ah teaching is been happening but that teaching is lack of faith and it leaves the people to lay their sixth sense to be determined the constant it must teach us that we must activate any utilize daily on a daily basis our faith so that you must not determined what was it away my sorry I'm jumping ahead of you what was it holding on that success that's something that makes it real yes a through through this sixth sense he's in subdued kingdoms amen the sixth sense subdued kingdoms through the sixth sense the walls of Jericho fell flat on the ground Amen you believe that the walls of Jericho hit the ground through the sixth sense that was faith that was utilized in the sixth sense there is no way that I can go around those pulpits under the five senses then eventually it falls there's no way but faith can do it because faith it was beyond that the Six Senses Amen may God help us let's go to the last but one if I'm not mistaken the super sense again now the sixth sense come for this reason that's the reason why the sixth sense come that was to make the five senses in you deny anything that contrary to God's weight there you go the answer now why is the sixth sense given the five senses are supposed to be under control they are supposed to be Allah you know what we call that thing for the Isaac that will pull the horse there are those trains the five senses are supposed to be under and under control by the sixth sense otherwise you can't control these guys look they need another super sense to control them amen so deny anything that's contrary to God that's what the sixth sense is for the sixth sense is for that to control those guys Scripture speaks of casting down reasoning reasoning some of those senses remember remember in the five senses and they work together and then so you can imagine things you can dream things you can you can you can you can another way you can have things in your questions I know right because the devil can operate within those senses and then but now the sixth sense is meant and called to control them I mean the wonderful thing is these processing sisters this is powerful but there was given to the success and that success belongs only to the Christian so I'm talking to the right people tonight the sixth sense is only meant for you and for me that's what the sixth sense is meant for and it is meant for us not for someone else and he's given to us by God just like the five senses and it is one that governs and guides you not the five senses it is the one it is superior to all other senses it is a superior to all senses the other five senses that's the sixth sense and is given to only Christians don't you think this is the wonderful privilege in conclusion I want to read also this whole piece him that and the super sense is the Holy Spirit and the faith of God that dwells in you how many believe that and if you will let the five senses be yielded to the sixth sense it will guide you and bring all the other five senses under control of that super sense for it is far as far above natural sense as a spiritual man is above the natural I mean in doing so the super cells raise him up into the sport to where he has faith to believe things that could not but he could not hear sorry I'm reading any other scene right in doing so the super cells raises him up into the spot where he has faith to believe things that could not he could not you believe things that you not sorry you believe things that your other cells can do things that you could not see things understandings that you could not understand that's powerful understand you know what is this thing called understanding it's not even it goes to the other senses of the Spirit because that's where we risen right six face six sense takes all the reasonings that is not for God it that reasoning in actual fact is a problem reasoning it goes directly against faith because when faith says I'm healed listening says but can't you see this would can't you see the doctor's report so we must refuse it even if we can't see the solution we must refuse it and we must deny it never agree with the devil even if he appears to be correct I mean not a mistake for mother Eve the devil appeared by a correct and meaningful and she agreed and that was not I was saying I turned to my family that you know sometimes we say we read the scripture that says it will deceive the very elect if it was possible ah that's what's going to happen in the end time it's going to deceive the very elect if it was possible and we say well maybe the way is going to be is going to be the deception of a 99.5 percent ah truth brother indeed you find that ever comes 99.9 he comes and went to deceive you chuckles that the five senses can see a natural effect my brothers and sisters he is going to try to deceive us 99.99999 zero one percent that's how close well you may not even be able to see back to almost separate you need a super sense to be able to see that hey this is deception so it's going to be a sword close as we come closer to the end as we come to the end of the end it's going to be so close but we definitely need the super sense to be able in the sense that is above our senses for us to be able to detect the deception of the devil in the age that we are living in amen so that's all that I had for you tonight and then I just want to say may God help each and every one of us and take these little ways that I have prepared and just transform them and just bring them to a point where you can be able to see what God wants to say not much about the vessel because you know God can use SS teak what can use a rock to push his weight he can so don't it means that comes you don't even look at random pop or about James but at the bend brother and brother Jay don't look at them look at what God is doing for you that is why it's important for you and for me to pray when we come to church to bear the minister because it's not about the minister it's about me and God God is going to talk to me and I must tell God what I want today what I need I'm I still got my problems I must tell God how I want to help that sister that brother I'm tell God everything that I need how I want to hate him to help the minister so that the means I can talk to me now once you do that and you come here you wear what you call back home we call it war clap you know war clap what is ice trap I don't know what is it brother it but the war club when we put a horse or donkeys on their cut we put we put we put certain things lettuce we don't have a donkey to look left or right no no no no we don't want the horse to look there or here you know sometimes you can see with you know a nice dangerous you you can you can say you see so you don't want they don't you do that other horse when you do extreme so let's pray that when we come to church we take the soup assets and wear those things me and my Lord Jesus then you see the answer that you need will come then you'll see that atmosphere that comes through from inside outside it will even overflow to the person next to you when they love you they get the annulled huh let's turn on our feet and clap hands for the Lord amen may God bless you and may his name be praised I hope that I made sense and that God will continue to speak to you lasting a beautiful song that

we're the band if there's anyone who have sent anything you can speak it confess it before the Lord and it shall come to pass the supercells are foreign for a way of talking to people and you need me

super-sense the God who made the heavens and the earth from nothing you can answer me because it is your word that said so I mean tonight you want to mention something before God you are hesitating in your life to do something for God you are you are taking time one of your five senses is busy telling you that is not yet time your you are delaying the soup the five senses are giving you some delaying tactics tonight you want God to remove that thing and now you know that you want go to remove it bring it to God in prayer tonight as you're going to pray I mean they'll surrender ourselves
