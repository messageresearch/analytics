[7:32] welcome to the house of God this morning
[7:34] amen who's feeling good
[7:36] amen have a good sleep you're refreshed
[7:39] ready to go ready to praise the Lord
[7:42] I thought John over there yawning but
[7:44] you know when the power of God comes
[7:45] you'll be wide awake and rejoicing
[7:48] lay that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[7:50] their strengths amen these bodies are
[7:53] sometimes a bit of a drag you know they
[7:55] try and hold us back but we're not going
[7:57] to let them this weekend
[8:00] um well um as brother info said we'll
[8:02] sleep at school or sleep at work next
[8:04] week
[8:05] [Music]
[8:07] he said one of the ministers will be
[8:09] preaching and seeing a young fellow
[8:10] start to fall asleep he said hey stay
[8:12] awake you can sleep at school tomorrow
[8:16] you know we prioritize things and I
[8:18] believe we have to keep balance but you
[8:19] know the Lord comes first
[8:22] you can never fail when you put the Lord
[8:23] first you'll never never fail we've just
[8:26] got a few little uh housekeeping things
[8:28] because some people weren't here
[8:29] yesterday a few uh that there are
[8:31] toilets here but they are for the ladies
[8:32] and the children under five so if you're
[8:35] a
[8:36] man and you're over five you have to go
[8:39] over that way over there but just hold
[8:41] on
[8:42] laughs
[8:46] um if you need some first aid too Stacy
[8:48] over here can you put your hand up
[8:50] is your first aid person and there are
[8:53] there are first aid things probably over
[8:56] in the hall I think that yeah so that
[8:57] that's it and also it's Marion's
[8:59] birthday today where's Marion OH there
[9:01] he is
[9:03] amen
[9:05] [Applause]
[9:07] [Music]
[9:09] he thinks he's old now because he said
[9:11] he's a quarter of a century old
[9:15] man
[9:16] [Music]
[9:18] so he thinks he's quarter of the way
[9:20] through but I think we decided it was
[9:21] three score and ten so he's maybe a
[9:23] third of his way through
[9:26] but I told him I'm going to live forever
[9:28] [Music]
[9:31] amen
[9:33] praise the Lord let's um let's stand
[9:34] this morning
[9:36] and we're going to have a great time in
[9:38] the Lord I really enjoyed last night
[9:39] we're going to have a great time this
[9:40] morning just worshiping the Lord and
[9:42] receiving his word into our hearts I
[9:44] believe we're receiving Rich word what
[9:46] we heard last night wasn't just someone
[9:48] in five minutes it's just thought of a
[9:49] few things that's a lifetime of the Lord
[9:52] bringing someone through things and and
[9:53] gathering information and trials and
[9:55] testings along the way and speaking to
[9:57] us we can just sit back and receive it
[9:58] without having to go through a lot of
[10:00] the things that you can tell that our
[10:02] brother went through to get what he
[10:03] spoke to us so let's let's receive it in
[10:05] appreciation and appreciate what the
[10:06] Lord's done that that men will surrender
[10:09] themselves to the Lord and go through
[10:11] these things and Garner things to give
[10:12] to Us Praise the Lord
[10:14] um so I've got your blessing for you
[10:17] this morning because the lord always
[10:19] wants to bless you
[10:21] that's what he desires for you and your
[10:23] All Sons and Daughters of God and he
[10:25] loves his children
[10:26] we all love our natural children don't
[10:28] we think about how much God loves us and
[10:31] so this one is actually from Ephesians
[10:34] uh one four to seven but I I've switched
[10:37] it around so I'm as though the Lord is
[10:38] speaking to you you might think that's
[10:40] pretty heavy but you know what we are we
[10:43] are God and flesh and there are times
[10:44] where we speak and it's God
[10:46] that's who we are
[10:49] this and if and and
[10:52] that's just that's just who we are and
[10:53] remember that your words have power too
[10:55] you're very very powerful don't be
[10:58] careful what you say always speak
[10:59] positive never speak negative about
[11:01] yourself or anyone else always speak
[11:02] positive your words are powerful so this
[11:06] is the Lord speaking to us this morning
[11:07] I have chosen you in me before the
[11:11] foundation of the world
[11:13] that you will be holy and Without Blame
[11:16] Before Me In Love
[11:19] I have predestinated you unto adoption
[11:22] according to the good pleasure of my
[11:24] will
[11:25] to the praise of the glory of my grace
[11:28] because I have made you accepted in me
[11:32] and in me you have Redemption through my
[11:35] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[11:38] to the riches of my grace
[11:41] that's for us this morning amen let's
[11:42] just commit the service to the Lord
[11:44] Lord Jesus we thank you so much Lord
[11:47] that those are your thoughts towards us
[11:49] Lord there's no other motive but to
[11:52] redeem and to save and to build us up
[11:54] that within those words you didn't have
[11:56] any other desire Lord but to enrich us
[11:58] Lord and we thank you so much that you
[12:01] gave your all for us Lord you laid down
[12:04] your life for us and we we come here
[12:07] this morning knowing that we can't earn

[13:07] need to be blessed that may be an
[13:09] encouragement that may be in a rebuke it

[58:20] uh the bear season
[58:23] you know back home we're coming into
[58:24] hunting season and and the brothers are
[58:27] getting their tags and you know because
[58:29] they have a certain uh
[58:31] intent to have a purpose in getting a
[58:34] bear tag and so you know they they want
[58:36] to go hunt some bear
[58:38] you know and this morning we we are
[58:40] we're in bear season
[58:42] but God has given us a tag amen he's
[58:44] given us he's given us uh uh the right
[58:48] to go after that bear
[58:50] and he's told us where to find those
[58:51] bears and you know he's told us it's
[58:53] it's seasoned it's open season I'm bear
[58:55] amen so we want to look at this just by
[58:58] way of an encouragement today and uh
[59:01] trust it'll just bless you this morning
[59:02] if we turn our Bibles to the book of
[59:04] First Samuel 17 32.
[59:07] you know the prophet told us to watch
[59:10] Russia
[59:11] the bearer of the North
[59:14] you know it's bare season out there and
[59:16] we see how that that bear has flexed its
[59:19] muscles you know it's it's he's uh he's
[59:22] he's awakened you know even the news
[59:24] headlines declared back in in in like
[59:27] 2014 and 15 it started to declare things
[59:30] like you know the bearer of the north is
[59:32] waking up
[59:33] amen that's exciting to the believer you
[59:36] know because we see that and we say wow
[59:38] didn't the prophet say something about
[59:39] those things amen so we were told to
[59:42] watch Russia and the things and these
[59:43] are the signs that that Redemption draws
[59:46] nigh amen that we are to look up amen
[59:48] it's Eagle time it's time to spread our
[59:50] wings because we're leaving amen but you
[59:53] know so we can look at the bear of the
[59:54] north and we see what it's doing up
[59:56] there and and Putin and and the nation
[59:58] there and
[1:00:00] but you know we forget sometimes that
[1:00:01] the Bears of the bears that are right in
[1:00:03] our very own lives you know we got to
[1:00:06] watch that bear also and he has certain
[1:00:08] characteristics he has certain traits
[1:00:10] and and we can pick up on those things
[1:00:11] in the word of God today you know but we
[1:00:14] want to watch that bear that can be
[1:00:15] right in our very midst and you know if
[1:00:18] you look at Russia and what is he doing
[1:00:19] you know you see how it's changing the
[1:00:21] whole economics of the world and it has
[1:00:23] brought another fear onto the world you
[1:00:25] know if covet wasn't bad enough we have
[1:00:27] Russia now to contend with and all of
[1:00:29] its influences and what it's doing and
[1:00:31] people are are greatly feared you know
[1:00:33] they're they're afraid of what's going
[1:00:35] on they don't know if they're going to
[1:00:37] have a job next year you know people are
[1:00:38] just really nervous a real anxiety has
[1:00:41] come on upon the people and man for the
[1:00:43] believer though it's different you know
[1:00:45] it's a rejoicing time amen because our
[1:00:48] King is Coming amen so we want to just
[1:00:51] look at this a little bit it's a bear
[1:00:53] season and that you have the right to
[1:00:55] hunt bears we have the right to hunt
[1:00:58] them amen you've been given the the
[1:01:00] tools to hunt bear you know we don't
[1:01:02] have to fear it you know though it's
[1:01:04] lurking out there in the darkness and
[1:01:05] you know it's a it's a great animal big
[1:01:08] animal but you know my brother and
[1:01:09] sister you have the right gun you have
[1:01:10] the right ammunition and we have the tag
[1:01:13] to have the right to to hunt that bear
[1:01:16] this morning
[1:01:17] first Samuel 17 and 32 says and David
[1:01:20] said to Saul
[1:01:22] let no man's heart fail because of him
[1:01:26] thy servant will go and fight with his
[1:01:28] Philistine do we have some Young
[1:01:30] Warriors here today huh and Saul said to
[1:01:33] David Thou Art not able to go against
[1:01:35] this Philistine to fight with him for
[1:01:37] thou art but a youth and he a man of war
[1:01:39] from his youth
[1:01:41] and David said unto Saul thy servant
[1:01:43] kept his father's sheep and there came a
[1:01:45] lion and a bear and took a lamb out of
[1:01:49] the flock and then went after him
[1:01:52] I hope you're listening this morning and
[1:01:55] I went after him and smote him almost
[1:01:58] like he's a person huh and smote him and
[1:02:01] delivered it out of his mouth and when
[1:02:04] he arose against me I caught him by his
[1:02:06] beard and I smote him
[1:02:08] Hallelujah and flew him and then verse
[1:02:12] 36 says
[1:02:13] thy servants slew both the bear lion and
[1:02:16] the bear and this uncircumcised
[1:02:19] Philistine shall be as one of them
[1:02:21] seeing he has defy the armies of the
[1:02:23] Living God David said moreover the Lord
[1:02:26] that delivered me out of the Paw of the
[1:02:28] lion and out of the Paw of the bear he
[1:02:30] will deliver me out of the hand of this
[1:02:32] Philistine and Saul said unto David
[1:02:35] go and the Lord be with thee you may
[1:02:38] have receipts this morning amen I feel
[1:02:41] just a little encouraged this morning I
[1:02:43] feel like we have marching orders this
[1:02:45] morning amen go and let the Lord be with
[1:02:48] you amen we see how that David had come
[1:02:51] on the scene of a great trying time and
[1:02:54] a testing time for Israel and you know
[1:02:56] there was a giant there in the land you
[1:02:58] know we've seen some Giants in our lands
[1:03:00] you know but this giant had made his
[1:03:03] boast against the armies of Israel and
[1:03:05] we see the the enemy making all kinds of
[1:03:08] boats this morning you know and it can
[1:03:10] be cancer it can be it can be Instagram
[1:03:12] it can be whatever it may be this
[1:03:14] morning or unbelief and doubt but the
[1:03:16] enemy is making his boast and he may
[1:03:18] seem like a giant you know he's big this
[1:03:21] guy's big hey man he's he's he is bigger
[1:03:24] than you he's huge you know
[1:03:28] I don't know how many of you have played
[1:03:29] rugby but maybe you can relate to this a
[1:03:32] little bit being in New Zealand you know
[1:03:34] you you have different players on the
[1:03:36] field and you know some guys are bigger
[1:03:37] than other guys and I remember I was
[1:03:39] just a little wingman you know I was the
[1:03:41] little guy on the field but you know
[1:03:42] they always had that eighth man break
[1:03:44] loose and he's coming around because he
[1:03:46] knows that wingman is just a little guy
[1:03:48] you know and it's like why pick on the
[1:03:50] little guy right but he's a big man and
[1:03:53] it's just like why him right why did he
[1:03:56] have to be built such a way why has he
[1:03:58] made a certain way you know he's he's
[1:04:00] built bigger he's stronger and and so
[1:04:02] they teach you how to deal with that
[1:04:04] oversized threat right they tell you to
[1:04:07] take him out at the legs right you got
[1:04:09] to take him right out take out his
[1:04:11] foundation right so that there's a way
[1:04:14] to deal with the oversized problem
[1:04:18] so we see how that David he looks at
[1:04:20] this Philistine and he's watching this
[1:04:22] guy and you know and he goes to Saul and
[1:04:24] and he says you know hey let me go and
[1:04:27] fight this man now my brother and sister
[1:04:29] that that is something we have a right
[1:04:31] as a Believer because Jesus Christ said
[1:04:33] whatsoever you say
[1:04:35] amen if you speak to this mountain God
[1:04:37] God has confidence in you this morning
[1:04:40] because you are strong enough because of
[1:04:43] Jesus Christ who lives in you amen so we
[1:04:46] need to recognize our position God has
[1:04:48] placed us here for a reason it's bear
[1:04:51] season it's hunting season amen we're
[1:04:54] not a we're not a suppressed group we're
[1:04:56] not a group that has been pushed aside
[1:04:58] my brother sister we are the light of
[1:05:00] the world and you turn the light on the
[1:05:02] darkness please amen the power that this
[1:05:05] world is looking for is laying inside
[1:05:07] the Believers amen love that that the
[1:05:10] world is looking for is inside the
[1:05:11] Believers so I want to encourage you
[1:05:13] when you go to your schools and things
[1:05:14] remember it's be bear season yeah man
[1:05:17] you have a right to hunt bear
[1:05:20] amen praise the Lord so thy servant will
[1:05:23] go and fight with this Philistine he
[1:05:24] knew something about what God was doing
[1:05:26] in his life he was living under an
[1:05:28] anointing he has been called To Rule and
[1:05:30] Reign amen we've been made Kings and
[1:05:33] Priests amen this man was he was he was
[1:05:35] called To Rule and Reign I want to just
[1:05:37] say that you know he wasn't king just
[1:05:39] yet at this time but he was anointed to
[1:05:41] be king see he was living under a
[1:05:43] promise of of reigning in a certain
[1:05:46] position amen we have also been like
[1:05:49] like the sons of God being adopted amen
[1:05:51] we're coming into the fullness of our
[1:05:53] adoption amen but you can see how that
[1:05:56] David he knew the anointing that was
[1:05:58] upon his life he knew his destination
[1:06:00] but he didn't have to wait until that
[1:06:02] day amen because God was going to watch
[1:06:05] over him through his journey and even
[1:06:07] though the the Lions would rise up and
[1:06:09] the Bears would rise up and the Giants
[1:06:11] would come on the scene he was still and
[1:06:13] even at that time because of the
[1:06:14] anointing that was on him he was able to
[1:06:17] withstand those things
[1:06:18] to conquer amen and so Saul we see how
[1:06:21] that Saul tries to tries to dissuade him
[1:06:24] you know this Philistine he's been
[1:06:26] training for this his whole life you
[1:06:28] know he's been trained in The Art of War
[1:06:30] you know he's got a shield Bearer you
[1:06:33] know an armor Bearer and you know he he
[1:06:35] knows about tactics of war and all these
[1:06:37] things and he's got the right kind of
[1:06:39] armor and the right kind of sword and
[1:06:41] Spear and you know he's he's a he's a
[1:06:43] fearful sight I want you to remember my
[1:06:44] brother and sister the whole Army of
[1:06:46] Israel was was at a halt it had become
[1:06:50] crippled because of this one man
[1:06:53] you know it's incredible how the one
[1:06:55] little thing can can stand out in our
[1:06:58] life like that and can our walk
[1:06:59] and and the whole armies of Israel
[1:07:02] standing there and and wondering what
[1:07:04] are we going to do when God had
[1:07:06] commissioned them when he said I'm with
[1:07:07] you I am the Lord your God
[1:07:11] Hallelujah
[1:07:12] and David sent unto the soul thy servant
[1:07:15] kept his father's Sheep amen he had an
[1:07:17] experience
[1:07:18] oh my God gives us experiences so that
[1:07:21] we can know what who we are in his
[1:07:24] kingdom so we can know who we are to our
[1:07:26] Lord and Jesus Christ
[1:07:28] what a relationship we have with him huh
[1:07:31] God allows things to come in our life
[1:07:33] why because he knows we can handle them
[1:07:35] he does not let something come in our
[1:07:37] lives that we cannot handle amen he
[1:07:39] built us a certain way until he allows
[1:07:42] those little things to come up and he
[1:07:43] knows that we're more than able to meet
[1:07:45] those things
[1:07:46] thy servant has kept his father's sheep
[1:07:48] and there came a lion
[1:07:51] I don't know how many of you have stood
[1:07:52] in front of a lion but I mean those
[1:07:54] things are big
[1:07:55] those things are big
[1:07:58] you know that thing Roars I mean your
[1:07:59] whole body shakes I mean I see some
[1:08:02] South Africans here this morning know
[1:08:03] what I'm talking about I mean your whole
[1:08:06] body shakes every bone comes disjointed
[1:08:09] you don't know what to think or say it I
[1:08:12] mean you just can't move you know like
[1:08:13] the prophet said when that lion speaks
[1:08:15] the whole jungle goes quiet I've
[1:08:18] experienced that amen
[1:08:21] you think of this little Shepherd boy
[1:08:23] I think it's amazing that we're talking
[1:08:25] about lions from South Africa today and
[1:08:27] and bears from Canada
[1:08:29] and sheep from New Zealand
[1:08:33] praise the Lord
[1:08:35] [Applause]
[1:08:37] that one was free
[1:08:39] but there was a Shepherd boy huh a
[1:08:42] Shepherd you know and I think of our our
[1:08:44] great Shepherd this morning you know a
[1:08:47] little sheep had maybe gone astray and
[1:08:50] this Shepherd went after that sheep oh
[1:08:52] my brother and sister that's our Lord
[1:08:54] and savior this morning but what is he
[1:08:56] showing us here look at this here he's
[1:08:58] showing an experience that David had
[1:09:01] because David was going to be a king one
[1:09:03] day but he needed to understand who was
[1:09:06] walking with him
[1:09:07] and look at how he how he has this
[1:09:09] experience and he says and there came a
[1:09:11] lion you know a lion would have been a
[1:09:12] bad situation do you show up there and
[1:09:15] you know he didn't have a gun and he
[1:09:17] didn't have you know grenades and all
[1:09:18] kinds of things to defend himself with a
[1:09:20] bear spray and you know he had a little
[1:09:22] sling
[1:09:24] a little slingshot
[1:09:26] that does not it's not very comforting
[1:09:29] you know you're out there in the woods
[1:09:31] and and walking around with a little
[1:09:32] slingshot
[1:09:34] let's just be honest this morning let's
[1:09:35] put ourselves right in the scene he did
[1:09:37] not have much but it didn't matter what
[1:09:40] he had it it mattered who was with him
[1:09:44] it mattered who called him it mattered
[1:09:47] that he had an anointing that was upon
[1:09:49] his life
[1:09:50] you see it didn't matter that there was
[1:09:52] a bear it could have been Ten Bears it
[1:09:53] could have been ten Lions it didn't
[1:09:55] matter my brother's sister he had an
[1:09:57] anointing upon his life
[1:09:59] thank you
[1:10:00] Hallelujah and you as the bride of
[1:10:02] Christ you live with an anointing upon
[1:10:04] your life
[1:10:05] an eagle anointing
[1:10:08] thy servant kept his father sheep and
[1:10:10] there came a lion and a bear you know a
[1:10:12] line would have been bad enough
[1:10:14] but how do you put a line in a bear
[1:10:16] together
[1:10:17] huh a lion and a bear come on somebody
[1:10:20] listening this morning a lion and a bear
[1:10:23] man I would say you're in a bad kettle
[1:10:25] of fish I mean this is bad
[1:10:27] a lion and a bear hmm
[1:10:30] how many has been in a situation like
[1:10:32] that you know it's bad enough that this
[1:10:34] happens and then this happens also
[1:10:38] you know both of these things have cloth
[1:10:40] and they just seem to have a way to sink
[1:10:42] their claws into your your life to take
[1:10:45] control I mean it's just
[1:10:47] oh my
[1:10:50] and I went out after him
[1:10:53] what made David think he could do that
[1:10:56] see his he wasn't worried about the
[1:10:58] threat
[1:10:59] he was looking at the Sheep
[1:11:02] in other words he was looking at the
[1:11:04] position he was in
[1:11:05] see the position is important
[1:11:08] when the bride recognizes her position
[1:11:10] amen the Rapture will take place
[1:11:13] so you see David
[1:11:15] what does David do he he recognizes his
[1:11:17] position I'm called to be king one day
[1:11:20] amen and I here I am I'm in the position
[1:11:22] of a shepherd in my father's house and
[1:11:26] there's a sheep gone missing I mean I'm
[1:11:28] in the line of duty amen he wasn't
[1:11:31] looking at the threats he wasn't looking
[1:11:32] at his slingshot he was looking at the
[1:11:34] position that he was in he had
[1:11:36] confidence in who he was amen and so he
[1:11:40] just says and I went after him
[1:11:42] amen so this morning if there's a bear
[1:11:45] in your life or there's a lion in your
[1:11:47] life there's there's something that
[1:11:48] seems to be suffocating your life my
[1:11:50] brother sister go after him
[1:11:53] amen go after him you may have a little
[1:11:55] slingshot you might have a Jawbone but
[1:11:57] I'm saying this morning you have a right
[1:11:58] to go after him it's bear season amen
[1:12:04] he went after and smote him delivered
[1:12:06] him out of his mouth when he arose
[1:12:07] against my caught him by his beard and
[1:12:09] smote him and slew him
[1:12:11] thy servant slew both The Lion and the
[1:12:15] bear and this uncircumcised Philistine I
[1:12:18] want you to notice he first deals with a
[1:12:20] a lion and then a bear together
[1:12:23] and then this man rises on the scene
[1:12:26] it's very important because you'll see
[1:12:27] the parallels in the message
[1:12:30] this man rises on the scene great man
[1:12:33] big man
[1:12:35] great threat big boast
[1:12:38] defying the armies of the Living God
[1:12:40] this is the kind of man that he is
[1:12:43] and this man rises on the scene who is
[1:12:47] this
[1:12:48] uncircumcised philistine
[1:12:50] foreign
[1:12:53] he says this uncircumcised Philistine
[1:12:55] shall be as one of them
[1:12:57] David said more over the Lord that
[1:12:59] delivered me out of the Paw of the line
[1:13:01] in other words look at how he says this
[1:13:03] here out of the Paw of the line which is
[1:13:04] out of the grip of that threat
[1:13:08] out of the control
[1:13:10] or out of the power
[1:13:12] out of you know because that's what a
[1:13:14] hand means right it means to control or
[1:13:16] the Deeds of
[1:13:18] so you see how that even David here
[1:13:20] saying that God that has delivered me
[1:13:22] out of the pile of this line out of the
[1:13:23] Paul the bear he will deliver me out of
[1:13:25] the hand of this man this Philistine and
[1:13:28] Saul said go and the Lord be with thee
[1:13:30] so we see how that the The Lion and the
[1:13:33] Barrack is the type of the enemy in
[1:13:35] these scriptures
[1:13:37] a type of a threat that can come against
[1:13:39] a Believer and we see how that the lion
[1:13:41] can also be a good thing because we know
[1:13:43] that that there will be a line from the
[1:13:45] tribe of Judah amen but here we see that
[1:13:48] Satan always copies God he's trying to
[1:13:51] copy him you know he doesn't come up
[1:13:53] with anything original but here we want
[1:13:55] to just see here what what this is all
[1:13:57] about this this lion that we face in our
[1:14:00] lives in First Peter
[1:14:03] five and eight it says be sober be
[1:14:05] vigilant because your adversary the
[1:14:07] devil as a roaring lion walketh about
[1:14:11] seeking whom he may devour our enemy is
[1:14:15] as a roaring lion a man just seems to
[1:14:18] shake us sometimes to our very core
[1:14:20] right our enemy is as a roaring lion the
[1:14:24] lion and the Bear in scripture so it's
[1:14:26] typed as animals or beasts that can
[1:14:29] destroy men we know that they are used
[1:14:31] many times as the types and powers that
[1:14:33] the prophet talks about and they're used
[1:14:35] by Satan we see here even in in Daniel 7
[1:14:39] and and Revelation 13 we find the image
[1:14:43] unto the Beast see we're talking about
[1:14:45] spiritual things here this morning that
[1:14:47] image that is erected unto the the image
[1:14:49] unto the Beast having those same
[1:14:51] characteristics of those animals in it
[1:14:54] and this is very interesting now because
[1:14:56] we start to see the traits and
[1:14:58] characteristics and we see how that God
[1:15:00] used a little Shepherd Boy show us how
[1:15:02] he was going to defeat those things amen
[1:15:05] and how that there was going to be a
[1:15:06] King David rule one day amen and so we
[1:15:09] see how that even we are coming into the
[1:15:11] same motions the same process how that
[1:15:13] that same line and bear will be
[1:15:15] destroyed coming into a King David ring
[1:15:17] you believe that is that not the
[1:15:20] Millennium Reign is the King David reign
[1:15:22] is it kind of interesting how that the
[1:15:24] lion you know will be a passive animal
[1:15:26] in the Millennium reign
[1:15:29] but we see here this this Lion and the
[1:15:32] bear being used as types or traits or
[1:15:34] characteristics parallel so that we can
[1:15:37] identify the nature of that Beast system
[1:15:41] Revelations 13 and 2 says this and the
[1:15:44] Beast which I saw was like unto a
[1:15:46] leopard and his feet were as the feet of
[1:15:48] a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a
[1:15:51] lion and the dragon gave him power
[1:15:55] and his seat and great Authority but
[1:15:58] notice how that that all sums up into
[1:16:01] one man at the end time the end the
[1:16:03] Antichrist huh
[1:16:06] the Beast made up of all the powers
[1:16:08] coming up into one form this Beast would
[1:16:10] be accomplished of all those powers and
[1:16:12] Daniel they represented the Gentile
[1:16:14] kingdoms we saw them in the medes and
[1:16:17] Persians and Greece Babylon all coming
[1:16:19] into one image and remember how that
[1:16:22] that stone came out of the mountain amen
[1:16:25] made with without made without hands and
[1:16:27] it's smoked the feet it smote the the
[1:16:30] image in the feet amen right in the
[1:16:32] foundation it came crumbling down
[1:16:34] but I don't want to focus so much on on
[1:16:37] the Beast system and all those things I
[1:16:38] want to focus on our own lives but it's
[1:16:40] the same characteristics same traits all
[1:16:42] the way through you'll find many times
[1:16:44] in the Bible
[1:16:46] The Lion and the bear are used together
[1:16:47] they come together to attack like I said
[1:16:50] it'd be one thing if a lion came it'd be
[1:16:53] another thing if a bear came but oh my
[1:16:55] goodness both of them together
[1:16:58] what a scene what a time but God's got
[1:17:01] Shepherds on the scene God's got David's
[1:17:04] Amen on the scene
[1:17:07] as if I won here here look at this here
[1:17:09] all uses different types of dangers also
[1:17:12] for the believer in in Lamentations we
[1:17:14] find this
[1:17:17] three and ten it says it like this here
[1:17:19] he was unto me as a bear lying in weight
[1:17:23] and as a lion in secret places again
[1:17:26] both of them together
[1:17:28] you know the more you start looking into
[1:17:29] this in the scriptures the bigger this
[1:17:31] picture becomes
[1:17:32] it's very interesting the the use of the
[1:17:35] bear and the line throughout the
[1:17:36] scriptures and he said unto me a bear
[1:17:38] lying in other words he sets a trap he
[1:17:41] sets snares a lion setting snares and
[1:17:43] traps
[1:17:44] it's like a person
[1:17:46] but he's got a certain nature and when
[1:17:49] he comes out of his hiding place he he
[1:17:51] Roars and he tries to scare you and
[1:17:54] tries to overwhelm you right
[1:17:57] so showing here that the bear and the
[1:17:59] lion sets traps and and is hiding is
[1:18:02] very deceptive you know I was walking
[1:18:04] through the the bush felt and and and
[1:18:06] and Brian Jones was talking and saying
[1:18:08] how that you know there's a lion on the
[1:18:10] left here and and then as you're walking
[1:18:11] along you'll see another line on the
[1:18:13] right hand side and and you know you
[1:18:15] hear the stories of how they they set
[1:18:16] traps you know up ahead they're they're
[1:18:18] waiting for you but they're just boxing
[1:18:20] you in like this you know it's a great
[1:18:22] feeling amen
[1:18:25] you know we walk like that in our
[1:18:27] spiritual walk also there's a trap being
[1:18:29] set you know and here we go on to
[1:18:31] Proverbs 28 and 15. as a roaring lion
[1:18:34] and a ranging bear not a raging bear
[1:18:37] arranging that's interesting what does
[1:18:40] that mean to be arranging bear so is the
[1:18:43] wicked ruler over the poor people that
[1:18:45] ranging bear is a hungry bear that has
[1:18:49] gone outside of its normal territory to
[1:18:52] hunt food isn't that exactly what Russia
[1:18:54] is doing right amen they're out of their
[1:18:57] normal territory we gotta watch Russia
[1:19:00] he's on the move and that Wicked ruler
[1:19:02] and amen look at all these beautiful
[1:19:04] types and parallels but that is the
[1:19:06] devil my brother and sister in our lives
[1:19:08] he goes outside of his normal places to
[1:19:11] rule we sing that in Canada right now
[1:19:13] how the grizzly bears are moving down
[1:19:15] from the north and coming down into
[1:19:17] places that haven't been before because
[1:19:19] it's being overrun by grizzly bear but
[1:19:21] see it's a ranging bear and it brings
[1:19:23] fear upon the people it changes the the
[1:19:26] ecosystems and and there's not as many
[1:19:28] moose as there used to be because of
[1:19:30] this right so it changes things you know
[1:19:32] he's on the move
[1:19:34] talks about a nickel Aid and some type
[1:19:36] spirit that is controlling and
[1:19:39] suppressive because who can withstand a
[1:19:41] grizzly bear
[1:19:43] who can withstand the lion Amos 5 and 18
[1:19:45] says woe unto you that desire the day of
[1:19:47] the Lord to what end is it for you the
[1:19:50] day of the Lord is Darkness not light as
[1:19:53] if a man did flee from a lion and a bear
[1:19:56] met him
[1:19:58] or went into the house and leaned his
[1:20:00] hand on the wall and a serpent bit him
[1:20:02] this is very interesting analogy being
[1:20:04] used here it's actually a type of the
[1:20:07] first and the second death being able to
[1:20:09] escape the first one but yet the second
[1:20:12] one catching up to you you know this is
[1:20:15] very important because this is the type
[1:20:16] of analogies that are used to show us
[1:20:18] the fierceness of these things
[1:20:22] we battle lions and bears but it's
[1:20:26] hunting season
[1:20:27] amen praise the Lord see there's a great
[1:20:30] fear that comes along with these things
[1:20:31] but you're holding the rifle amen you're
[1:20:35] holding the Bear Tag this morning
[1:20:38] so like David as Christians we have to
[1:20:41] face them
[1:20:42] and as we Face the Lions and the Bears
[1:20:45] then one day we Face the great Giant
[1:20:48] but we were made for these things I want
[1:20:51] to encourage you young men sharpen your
[1:20:54] source
[1:20:55] amen it's not a time to to get lazy it's
[1:20:58] not a time to give up it's a time to
[1:21:00] sharpen the source check the ammunition
[1:21:03] amen check the caliber check your
[1:21:06] tickets amen
[1:21:08] we were made for this season let us be
[1:21:10] more like David amen be bold and brave
[1:21:13] in the presence of the Lord see God
[1:21:16] trains us and he prepares us for these
[1:21:18] kinds of things in our lives
[1:21:19] and he places Us in the right locations
[1:21:22] you know even as brother Ben has been
[1:21:24] placed here as a pastor as a Shepherd
[1:21:26] over the Sheep here God knew exactly
[1:21:27] what this area would have made of but
[1:21:29] already there in taranaki God knows
[1:21:31] exactly where to place his men amen and
[1:21:34] you as as Housewives and and brothers
[1:21:37] that are doing electrical or Plumbing or
[1:21:39] whatever it may be God has placed you
[1:21:41] there for a reason Amen to combat The
[1:21:44] Works of the enemy
[1:21:46] David was anointed and positionally
[1:21:48] placed in the Kingdom long before he
[1:21:50] actually ruled over Israel and see we
[1:21:54] also likewise are positionally placed in
[1:21:56] Christ Jesus by the adoption and the
[1:21:59] filling of the Holy Spirit but see that
[1:22:01] is just your placing
[1:22:03] your place for a reason
[1:22:06] see now you must undergo training and
[1:22:09] proving you're going to find out what
[1:22:10] kind of material you're made of
[1:22:12] amen so when you see that bear come
[1:22:15] around the corner next time don't be
[1:22:16] afraid God's trying to show you what
[1:22:19] you're made of
[1:22:21] just have confidence in what the Lord
[1:22:22] has done for you he's the one that
[1:22:25] anointed you he's the one that called
[1:22:26] you amen
[1:22:29] oh my I'm sure David would have liked to
[1:22:32] skip over some of the training
[1:22:34] huh Lord can I just I just I get it I I
[1:22:37] know I I get it Lord I I've learned
[1:22:40] lesson I'm just gonna I just want to
[1:22:41] bypass this one you know this one's just
[1:22:43] a little overwhelming for me
[1:22:46] oh my you know we can face some things
[1:22:48] in life that just takes this skin right
[1:22:50] off you it tears the heart right out of
[1:22:53] you you know you go through loss or you
[1:22:54] go through pain amen it seems like a big
[1:22:57] bear has gotten a hold of you and it's
[1:22:58] over top of you he's digging his claws
[1:23:01] into your very very life into your lungs
[1:23:03] and suffocating you but my brother and
[1:23:05] sister all you have to do is speak the
[1:23:07] name of Jesus
[1:23:08] oh my because God is giving you strength
[1:23:11] over that bear
[1:23:13] strength over that lion
[1:23:15] let's not bypass our training but rather
[1:23:18] let us recognize greater is he that is
[1:23:21] in US amen you are more than capable his
[1:23:24] grace is sufficient
[1:23:27] oh my
[1:23:29] you see God had something in his mind
[1:23:31] God was Raising and teaching a man to
[1:23:34] become something that he could use in
[1:23:36] his hands God called him to be a king
[1:23:39] God called him to rule it was also God
[1:23:41] who fought his battles for him and and
[1:23:44] brought him to the very promise that was
[1:23:46] declared unto him
[1:23:48] praise the Lord there are a number of
[1:23:49] stages that stick out in David's
[1:23:51] training a man he had to defeat The Lion
[1:23:53] and the bear together then he had to
[1:23:56] defeat Goliath the Giant
[1:23:59] and then he had to cast out Devils
[1:24:00] through worship very interesting stages
[1:24:03] in David's life
[1:24:05] all before becoming the king you know
[1:24:08] we're going to rule and Reign One Day
[1:24:10] but see we have to go through training
[1:24:12] the only thing we're going to take with
[1:24:14] us is our character so that we can be
[1:24:16] fit to rule amen so see everything we're
[1:24:19] going through here is training it's
[1:24:21] training and that God knows how to bring
[1:24:23] us through it amen
[1:24:26] then he faced rejection
[1:24:30] not just from his own people from his
[1:24:32] very own son
[1:24:33] so you know it's all training God's
[1:24:36] showing us what he went through
[1:24:38] amen but by the same spirit that went
[1:24:40] through those things we will also
[1:24:42] overcome
[1:24:43] see so most people would avoid a bear or
[1:24:46] a lion you know if he were hunting and
[1:24:47] you knew there was grizzly bears we were
[1:24:49] hunting a few years ago and and the
[1:24:51] ranger told us this area is totally out
[1:24:53] of bounds because there's grizzly bears
[1:24:55] it's overrun with grizzly bears
[1:24:57] well I mean you're not voluntarily going
[1:25:00] to go walking in there after a warning
[1:25:02] like that it's just you know if you know
[1:25:04] that there's a grizzly bear in an area
[1:25:06] or a lion in a certain area you don't go
[1:25:08] looking for it
[1:25:10] I mean is it just me or you know if you
[1:25:13] did that he would be seen as crazy
[1:25:16] but see God he asks us sometimes to go
[1:25:19] back into the storm
[1:25:21] see God isn't afraid just like when the
[1:25:23] devil came to him and said have you
[1:25:24] considered job
[1:25:26] you know we may walk through the valley
[1:25:28] of the shadow of death but God is with
[1:25:30] us his rod and his staff his word amen
[1:25:33] is changing me it it's holding us it's
[1:25:35] keeping us
[1:25:39] so we would like to avoid some of these
[1:25:41] things the hardest things to overcome in
[1:25:42] life are those things that are stronger
[1:25:45] than us
[1:25:47] that have control over us
[1:25:50] and when they control us they dictate
[1:25:52] how we walk
[1:25:54] suddenly you walk very quietly because
[1:25:56] there's a bear
[1:25:58] right
[1:25:59] you crouched down and you get your gun
[1:26:02] out and
[1:26:04] right Bear Country
[1:26:06] see the those situations they dictate
[1:26:09] how you walk
[1:26:11] they control how you talk or how you act
[1:26:14] you become skittish
[1:26:17] around the Believers huh
[1:26:23] those things are like the Paw of The
[1:26:25] Lion and the Bear in our lives see there
[1:26:27] are many things that can control us we
[1:26:30] can inherit things from our families
[1:26:31] good and bad trades traits and also
[1:26:34] illnesses or they can control Our Lives
[1:26:36] they have a grip on us because of our
[1:26:38] bloodline but remember my brother and
[1:26:40] sister it's not an excuse this morning
[1:26:42] because we are a new creature in Christ
[1:26:46] Jesus see we are connected to a
[1:26:49] different bloodline so I just want to
[1:26:50] say this morning you see we we it's bear
[1:26:52] season we can get rid of all those
[1:26:54] things we can annihilate all those
[1:26:56] things in our lives this morning because
[1:26:57] God has given us a new and a living way
[1:27:00] A Better Way amen
[1:27:04] we come in contact with things that end
[1:27:06] up controlling our lives and you can
[1:27:08] talk about habits and all kinds of
[1:27:09] things but we have a right to resist
[1:27:11] those things this morning as we said
[1:27:13] last night these things are like the
[1:27:15] bear and the lion in a believer's life
[1:27:16] once they have a grip on you once they
[1:27:18] are they have you in their graphs it's
[1:27:20] very hard to get away
[1:27:23] and then finally the Giant
[1:27:26] the giant is a man
[1:27:29] you might be thinking of all kinds of
[1:27:31] things out there but just take a good
[1:27:32] look at your yourself this morning the
[1:27:35] giant is the man your greatest enemy The
[1:27:37] Prophet said is this guy right here
[1:27:40] not this guy maybe but for each and
[1:27:41] every one of you you yourself right
[1:27:46] are your worst enemy the man
[1:27:49] so another lion rose up on the scene my
[1:27:51] brother and sister
[1:27:53] even though these things were were there
[1:27:55] and we say how that God used David to
[1:27:57] show us the types of what God was going
[1:27:59] to do and not another line Rises on the
[1:28:02] scene his name is Jesus Christ
[1:28:04] the blood of Jesus Christ paid for your
[1:28:06] freedom and from those things and
[1:28:08] defeated that lion he made that lion
[1:28:11] quiet amen took the teeth out of him
[1:28:14] amen and then the lion of the tribe of
[1:28:16] Judah who takes the book and opens the
[1:28:18] seals in our day exposing the enemy and
[1:28:21] giving you power to overcome amen David
[1:28:25] says that the Lord delivered me out of
[1:28:27] the Paw the grip of the lion out of the
[1:28:29] Paw the grip of the bear the Lord did
[1:28:31] that
[1:28:32] amen the Lord does that the Lord is the
[1:28:36] one who delivers the Lord is the one who
[1:28:37] won won the victory over the enemy see
[1:28:40] all David had to do was stay in the line
[1:28:42] of the father's business
[1:28:44] amen all he had to do was exercise faith
[1:28:47] in what God has done for him Lord you
[1:28:49] called me Lord you anointed me Lord you
[1:28:51] defeat the enemy
[1:28:53] [Applause]
[1:28:54] what did David have
[1:28:56] he didn't have bear spray no he had
[1:28:59] simple faith
[1:29:00] in the god of Israel and I thought that
[1:29:03] was amazing that sister singing that
[1:29:04] song in Hebrew Hebrew this morning
[1:29:06] had simple faith in the god of Israel
[1:29:09] that say that he was saved by grace and
[1:29:12] the Lord God was the power that would
[1:29:14] overcome the threats in his life
[1:29:17] remember we want to fight the Giants in
[1:29:20] our lives also but first we must Conquer
[1:29:23] The Lion and the Bear
[1:29:24] we cannot defeat the giant in our own
[1:29:26] life until we have destroyed the lion
[1:29:28] and the bear those things that control
[1:29:30] us or dictate our walk
[1:29:34] we cannot defeat The Lion and the Bear
[1:29:38] if we worship them
[1:29:41] right those things that control Our
[1:29:43] Lives
[1:29:45] we want to fight the Giants in our lives
[1:29:48] but we must conquer that lion and Bear
[1:29:50] now let's just turn a little bit here
[1:29:52] brother Branham was an avid Hunter I'm
[1:29:54] so glad that God sent us a messenger in
[1:29:57] our day that was a good Hunter
[1:29:59] he knew how to hunt bear I'm so thankful
[1:30:02] for that amen because it's bear season
[1:30:04] watch Russia amen so here we have we
[1:30:07] have brother Branham comes on the scene
[1:30:09] and he's a hunter and so he understands
[1:30:11] these things so we're going to just draw
[1:30:13] a few lessons from him this morning from
[1:30:14] a couple of his stories see we are
[1:30:16] called to be Overcomers we have been
[1:30:18] called to hunt bears and lions and
[1:30:20] defeat them and sometimes we do not
[1:30:22] destroy them because we become
[1:30:24] distracted and we put others in danger
[1:30:26] so remember here's just a few stories
[1:30:29] just here from The Prophet's life and I
[1:30:31] I like to glean from those things
[1:30:32] because I believe the Lord allowed him
[1:30:34] to go through things in his life amen so
[1:30:36] that we can draw from his life just like
[1:30:38] how the Old Testament Saints God allowed
[1:30:40] them to go through things like David and
[1:30:42] he said that they were for our example
[1:30:43] amen
[1:30:45] but remember what happened in brother
[1:30:46] branham's life he was the first fruits
[1:30:49] of the ministry that would follow amen
[1:30:51] he's showing us what's in the scene he's
[1:30:53] showing us what's going to come up in
[1:30:55] the Harvest amen so God's showing
[1:30:57] through a prophet you know that he
[1:30:59] wasn't afraid of the bear he wasn't
[1:31:00] afraid of lions and all those things he
[1:31:02] was an avid Hunter
[1:31:04] amen praise the Lord that's what's in
[1:31:07] the seed amen that's what's coming up in
[1:31:09] the Harvest this morning praise the Lord
[1:31:12] so let's look at this little story
[1:31:13] remember when he went hunting on his
[1:31:15] honeymoon
[1:31:18] I see we have a couple here that's been
[1:31:20] engaged God bless you brother
[1:31:22] amen this is not good advice maybe for
[1:31:25] you too
[1:31:26] but you know he goes hunting on his
[1:31:29] honeymoon
[1:31:31] so he was going to meet Amanda that was
[1:31:33] going to go hunt bear with that is why
[1:31:36] he went up there he was hunting bear
[1:31:39] in the message curtain of time
[1:31:41] he says this
[1:31:43] he was building a little fire and so and
[1:31:45] he says and so I told her I'd be back at
[1:31:47] noon and I went across the hill to do
[1:31:49] some tracking come back along the Ridge
[1:31:51] and I've seen a bobcat Crossing and I
[1:31:54] couldn't get close enough to it to shoot
[1:31:56] it so I went up over the hill and I
[1:31:59] trained up along a trail dump along the
[1:32:01] side went into a great big bear Den it's
[1:32:05] interesting how the God allows him to go
[1:32:07] through very similar things that David
[1:32:09] went through there's so many parallels
[1:32:12] and there wasn't nothing in there I came
[1:32:14] back and went down towards the Giants
[1:32:17] there's your three things right away and
[1:32:20] this just caught my attention it's just
[1:32:21] you know just bear with me it's not the
[1:32:23] Lord's speaks to me I see the parallels
[1:32:25] and then and then I see the the story
[1:32:28] behind it and and see the encouragement
[1:32:30] that God's trying to bring
[1:32:32] but right away we see a bobcat we see a
[1:32:34] bear and we see Giants in his story so
[1:32:37] God's trying to say hey there's
[1:32:38] something about this journey there's
[1:32:40] something about his experience here that
[1:32:42] will relate you'll find this all the way
[1:32:43] through the scriptures amen
[1:32:47] he says what they call the Giants it's a
[1:32:49] great massive forest in there for miles
[1:32:51] after miles all flat Woods like in there
[1:32:53] and tar
[1:32:54] in the message the mighty conqueror he
[1:32:56] relates to this again he says I was
[1:32:58] waiting for the ranger to come up
[1:33:00] remember he is waiting for this guy he
[1:33:02] says and said I believe I'll go out and
[1:33:04] get some venison I said you wait if the
[1:33:06] ranger comes up we're going to hunt bear
[1:33:08] on up on the Hurricane Mountain she was
[1:33:12] supposed to wait for this Ranger
[1:33:14] the ranger knew the territory the ranger
[1:33:17] knows the the ins and outs of the
[1:33:19] terrain and brother Branham was supposed
[1:33:20] to wait for this Ranger we'll wait for
[1:33:23] this Ranger because we're going to go
[1:33:24] hunt bear
[1:33:25] it's bear season we're hunting bear but
[1:33:27] we gotta wait for this Ranger
[1:33:31] he says I heard oh sorry and I went up
[1:33:34] over a few Hills
[1:33:35] and down and I noticed a big bobcat and
[1:33:39] I was trailing him because he was
[1:33:40] catching Grouse I thought if I could get
[1:33:43] a shot at him I could get him but I
[1:33:45] couldn't catch him then I thought I
[1:33:47] scented a bear so he's talking about the
[1:33:49] same story every time but every time he
[1:33:51] tells the story he gives a little bit
[1:33:53] more insight
[1:33:54] so he smells this bear another place he
[1:33:57] sees the bear den and it's not where
[1:33:59] it's supposed to be it's ranging
[1:34:01] okay so it's out and about and in the
[1:34:04] year this story we find he's sensed the
[1:34:06] bear he knows it's around
[1:34:08] amen it's lurking
[1:34:11] well I don't know if you've ever smelled
[1:34:13] bear before
[1:34:14] oh my it changes the whole scene
[1:34:17] and there he tried to get a shot at that
[1:34:19] Bobcat but couldn't get close enough to
[1:34:22] it
[1:34:23] he says I hit a little ditch and went
[1:34:24] down this way and towards the Giants
[1:34:27] it's cold every time he brings his three
[1:34:29] things into the story
[1:34:30] and then message the seven compound
[1:34:32] names of Jehovah
[1:34:34] he says this well I thought I was too
[1:34:37] good of a Woodsman to ever get lost I'd
[1:34:40] been in the woods all my life I heard
[1:34:41] something moving in the bushes I
[1:34:43] listened close and I heard it had four
[1:34:45] feet moving but it wasn't a hoof it was
[1:34:47] a padded foot I thought wonder what that
[1:34:50] could be it was pretty dark right in a
[1:34:53] bunch of Evergreens and I happened to
[1:34:55] look at a lion
[1:34:57] cross the path like that and he was too
[1:35:01] quick I didn't get a shot at him I
[1:35:03] thought well I'll just slip up on up
[1:35:06] this way and come down the other side
[1:35:08] and I'll be in below Hurricane Mountain
[1:35:10] it was such a perfect name the mountain
[1:35:12] of storms huh
[1:35:15] all the time he says and I said then I
[1:35:18] can always look back to the tower
[1:35:19] because look like it might come a storm
[1:35:22] pretty soon oh it's such a perfect scene
[1:35:25] huh there he is he's without the Ranger
[1:35:30] he left the ranger the guy that knows
[1:35:31] the terrain because he thought he was a
[1:35:34] good Woodsman you know he thought he he
[1:35:36] could he could navigate his way through
[1:35:38] this but as he gets into this Hurricane
[1:35:40] Mountain as he as he sees the storm
[1:35:42] coming in he at least had the had the
[1:35:44] sense to find the the view of the tower
[1:35:47] again you know he's looking for that
[1:35:48] place of safety right because here the
[1:35:51] lion has crossed his path but that line
[1:35:53] was too quick
[1:35:54] you know brother Brandon was a good shot
[1:35:56] but that line I mean he could shoot
[1:35:58] squirrels
[1:35:59] right this line was too quick comes
[1:36:02] across this path like that and then he
[1:36:04] smells bare and you know and and he
[1:36:06] knows the storm's coming man it's
[1:36:08] Brewing out there now the devil's he's
[1:36:10] moving in you know he's but there's
[1:36:13] there's one man there and there you've
[1:36:14] got your bear you've got your line
[1:36:15] you've got the storms praise the Lord my
[1:36:18] brother and sister amen it's good to be
[1:36:20] a Son of God I just want to tell you
[1:36:21] don't fear the storms when you fear the
[1:36:24] when do you feel the storms and you get
[1:36:26] that bare scent and you see the Line run
[1:36:28] across the the path just gets still
[1:36:31] because God wants to show you something
[1:36:33] oh it's a good place to be
[1:36:36] when God can ever meet you in those
[1:36:38] storms and you can stand there and say I
[1:36:40] know a living God that protected me
[1:36:43] there the god that watched over me here
[1:36:45] the god that healed me at this place oh
[1:36:48] my my brother sister he knows how to
[1:36:50] lead his believers
[1:36:54] oh my
[1:36:55] God sorry I just this is personal to me
[1:36:58] this morning
[1:37:07] so I went on and on and on this way I
[1:37:10] thought I kept whiffing a bear somewhere
[1:37:13] and I kept smelling for him I thought
[1:37:15] he's near here somewhere he's probably
[1:37:16] staying ahead of me
[1:37:18] so I kept walking on like that watching
[1:37:20] the ground
[1:37:23] walking
[1:37:25] what was the problem in his story
[1:37:28] he didn't wait for the one that would
[1:37:30] help him hunt the bear see sometimes we
[1:37:34] can run ahead in life
[1:37:35] thinking we're going to carve our own
[1:37:36] way I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do this
[1:37:38] my brother's sister I'm gonna encourage
[1:37:40] you ask the Lord
[1:37:42] ask the Lord what he wants you to do
[1:37:44] Lord what do you want me to do for
[1:37:46] school Lord what kind of a career do you
[1:37:48] want me to have Lord because there's
[1:37:50] going to be bearish that's going to come
[1:37:51] off there's going to be they're lions
[1:37:53] and there's going to be Giants in my
[1:37:55] life oh God I I just want to know I'm
[1:37:57] walking with you I don't want to go into
[1:37:59] this Hurricane Mountain I don't want to
[1:38:01] go into this Hillside this dark place
[1:38:03] where the Giants are Lord without
[1:38:05] knowing that you're walking I want the
[1:38:07] ranger right next to me because he'll be
[1:38:09] able to spot that bear yeah he'll know
[1:38:12] the terrain
[1:38:14] don't walk alone
[1:38:18] take the Ranger with you
[1:38:19] [Music]
[1:38:21] see also knew it was risky going down
[1:38:24] there down where he found himself in the
[1:38:26] territory of The Lion and the bear he
[1:38:27] needed a guide to get himself out
[1:38:30] Hallelujah he thought he had all the
[1:38:32] knowledge he thought he had all he
[1:38:34] thought he was a great Woodsman my
[1:38:36] brother and sister he thought all those
[1:38:37] things but he needed help in the time of
[1:38:39] trouble
[1:38:41] and he became separated from his family
[1:38:43] oh there's so many things we could draw
[1:38:44] from the story he becomes separated from
[1:38:47] his family
[1:38:48] thank God he never leaves us nor
[1:38:50] forsakes us amen because we think we can
[1:38:52] handle those trials and tests on our own
[1:38:54] but we must be sure to wait on the Lord
[1:38:57] be sure to wait on the Ranger
[1:39:00] the Holy Ghost will give us power to
[1:39:01] destroy the enemy in our lives guide us
[1:39:04] through our storms
[1:39:06] let's look at another story here
[1:39:09] we must remember that God sends
[1:39:11] Messengers and angels
[1:39:14] and sometimes he comes himself to
[1:39:16] destroy the bear
[1:39:18] we sometimes travel through Bear Country
[1:39:20] without the protection we need we
[1:39:23] venture off into bare territory without
[1:39:24] the hunter by her side sometimes we
[1:39:27] don't recognize that he is right here in
[1:39:28] our midst
[1:39:34] in this story
[1:39:36] he is in Colorado I believe it is
[1:39:39] and he's on an elk Trail hunting elk
[1:39:43] and when he came across
[1:39:45] this infidelity you'll find the story
[1:39:47] kind of progresses along with this man
[1:39:50] here this man asks him what he's doing
[1:39:52] and brother Branham says I'm on an elk
[1:39:54] Trail I'm hunting elk
[1:39:56] and the man said you're wrong those are
[1:39:59] cow prints brother Branham said I've
[1:40:03] been a hunter
[1:40:04] long long enough to know that those are
[1:40:06] elk tracks and so the man examined it
[1:40:09] closer and he noticed that they were in
[1:40:11] fact elk tracks now just see how the
[1:40:13] story evolves here so he comes brother
[1:40:15] Brandon's hunting elk
[1:40:17] he's hunting for for meat and here he
[1:40:21] comes across this man he's an Infidel
[1:40:22] and and right away this man starts to
[1:40:26] question the prophet okay and so the
[1:40:29] prophet says I'm hunting out I'm
[1:40:30] following this Trail those are elk
[1:40:32] uh uh Trail that's an out Trail and and
[1:40:35] this man says this Infidel says no
[1:40:37] that's not help that's that's cow
[1:40:40] arguing with a prophet you know what
[1:40:42] you're seeing that's not what you're
[1:40:44] seeing right and that's just how it goes
[1:40:46] sometimes but you know the prophet says
[1:40:48] no I've been a hunter long enough I know
[1:40:49] this Trail I've seen this before right
[1:40:53] he's following this Trail
[1:40:56] brother Brandon was skilled he knew what
[1:40:58] to look for he had experience in his
[1:40:59] field see the Man became curious about
[1:41:02] who he was then and starts to ask him
[1:41:04] questions brother Brandon says I'm a
[1:41:07] game warden from Indiana
[1:41:09] and the man told him that he was not
[1:41:11] even welcome in this country
[1:41:15] this is interesting
[1:41:17] the one that is sent to hunt the bear
[1:41:21] is not welcome in his own country
[1:41:27] let me I'll give you the quote
[1:41:29] he said you're not even welcome in the
[1:41:32] country
[1:41:33] real rough hard-boiled I said well I'm
[1:41:36] here anyhow
[1:41:38] I said Bob Steele sent me back in here
[1:41:41] which is the interstate Game Commission
[1:41:43] I'm back here to hunt a grizzly bear
[1:41:46] he said there's no Grizzlies back there
[1:41:50] oh that's good huh no I'm okay there's
[1:41:54] no trouble
[1:41:55] I can go down this certain direction
[1:41:57] there's no Grizzlies down there oh my
[1:42:00] but I've been commissioned by God now
[1:42:03] the prophet in laodicea came and
[1:42:06] laodicea said we have need of nothing we
[1:42:09] have everything we have need of there's
[1:42:11] no grizzly bear back here remember
[1:42:13] grizzly bear is the one with the ill
[1:42:15] temper oh don't get him riled up don't
[1:42:18] rub him the wrong way right what a scary
[1:42:20] thing can you imagine walking into a
[1:42:22] dark room I don't mean to scare any kids
[1:42:23] here this morning or older once but you
[1:42:27] know walking into a dark room and not
[1:42:29] realizing you've walked into a room or a
[1:42:30] cave where there's a grizzly bear
[1:42:33] and he's hungry
[1:42:36] oh my I'm so thankful that someone could
[1:42:38] turn on the lights huh hey there's the
[1:42:41] grizzly bear in the country I've been
[1:42:43] commissioned by another
[1:42:45] commission another country from another
[1:42:48] place to come here and hunt a grizzly
[1:42:51] bear that's in your territory
[1:42:54] I love these stories amen
[1:42:57] so I'm back here to hunt grizzly bear he
[1:43:00] said there's no Grizzlies back here he
[1:43:01] said there was I'll take his word for it
[1:43:04] The Man became uncomfortable because he
[1:43:07] was in violation of the law see
[1:43:09] so this Infidel was in violation of the
[1:43:12] law oh it's so good
[1:43:14] so here this man comes from another
[1:43:16] country across the state line so to
[1:43:18] speak moves into this country uh just
[1:43:22] using the words of prophet used right
[1:43:24] and so he moves across the state line
[1:43:26] and there's a man there who's breaking
[1:43:28] the law
[1:43:29] he was living in sin
[1:43:32] there's grizzly bear in his country oh
[1:43:34] but there's a prophet on the scene that
[1:43:36] he's there to hunt the grizzly bear you
[1:43:39] know the prophet is there as a courtesy
[1:43:42] huh and this man now he's getting
[1:43:45] uncomfortable because this is a game
[1:43:47] warden oh man I'm in trouble you know
[1:43:49] because I've breaking the law here on
[1:43:51] this side
[1:43:52] but brother Branham reassures him by
[1:43:54] telling him I'm not here I'm not from
[1:43:57] here
[1:43:58] I'm from another country your laws are
[1:44:01] different than my laws from where I am
[1:44:04] from
[1:44:06] oh that's good
[1:44:08] oh that's good okay I'm We're not gonna
[1:44:11] have time to get into all that but think
[1:44:12] about that for a second he's under
[1:44:15] another Covenant
[1:44:16] yeah
[1:44:18] okay
[1:44:19] [Applause]
[1:44:20] he says here you have you would be a
[1:44:23] criminal he says but where I'm from
[1:44:25] there is a pardon for you
[1:44:28] oh he's hunting bear it's bear season
[1:44:31] amen he says
[1:44:34] I said
[1:44:37] I have got nothing to do with your laws
[1:44:39] here I'm just back here as I courtesy
[1:44:42] I'm hunting this bear
[1:44:45] that man didn't even know the trouble
[1:44:47] that was coming but God sent a prophet
[1:44:50] who could see huh
[1:44:53] and he said well I don't believe that
[1:44:56] bear is back there see that's the
[1:44:58] trouble with many Believers today we
[1:44:59] live in a bear in Bear Country and don't
[1:45:01] realize it
[1:45:03] you see that's the real danger out there
[1:45:05] in this world all around us and yet we
[1:45:06] think that danger does not exist thank
[1:45:08] God for sending a game warden amen a
[1:45:12] bear hunter see but he's here as a
[1:45:14] courtesy
[1:45:16] he's here as a courtesy God is a
[1:45:18] gentleman
[1:45:19] but he's he's ready he's guns loaded
[1:45:22] he's on the trail my brother and sister
[1:45:24] all you have to do this morning you say
[1:45:25] Lord I surrendered to you I accept your
[1:45:27] pardon and Lord whatever threats are
[1:45:30] coming up in my life I'm gonna need you
[1:45:31] I don't want to leave the ranger behind
[1:45:33] amen Lord will you walk in this country
[1:45:36] with me
[1:45:37] okay
[1:45:38] Allelujah
[1:45:40] see that man
[1:45:42] started to see that this man could read
[1:45:43] signs
[1:45:45] he could read the signs of the trail he
[1:45:48] could pick up the scent he knew what was
[1:45:49] going on you know and it's amazing how
[1:45:52] brother Branham eventually leads this
[1:45:53] man to the Lord
[1:45:55] the man started to recognize not only
[1:45:57] what brother Brandon was saying but he
[1:45:59] started to see God all around him
[1:46:02] in everything brother Brandon was sent
[1:46:05] to hunt bear in the natural and in the
[1:46:07] spiritual Amen in the spiritual he
[1:46:09] destroyed the Bear in that man's life
[1:46:11] also his bear was a doubting spirit
[1:46:14] foreign
[1:46:18] just like brother Brandon was sent to
[1:46:20] rescue that man so David was sent to
[1:46:22] rescue sheep from The Lion and the Bear
[1:46:25] delivered him out of the Paw of the lion
[1:46:27] and out of the Paw of the bear the two
[1:46:29] having a grip over the believer's life
[1:46:33] amen I'm just going to be a few more
[1:46:35] minutes
[1:46:36] David wasn't afraid of the bear in The
[1:46:38] Line
[1:46:39] so don't fear the bear
[1:46:42] David wasn't bluffing he meant it when
[1:46:44] he said he went after that sheep
[1:46:46] he wasn't hoping it was going to work
[1:46:48] out he trusted in the power of God
[1:46:51] see you can't Bluff the devil he knows
[1:46:54] when you are sincere or not
[1:46:57] he knows just like the bear knows when
[1:47:00] you are bluffing
[1:47:03] brother Brown says I'm a Hunter and I
[1:47:05] know animal life they say brother
[1:47:06] Branham aren't you afraid to walk up to
[1:47:08] them bear and and things with just a
[1:47:11] knife in your hand
[1:47:12] certainly not I know that if you're
[1:47:14] afraid of that animal he knows it you
[1:47:17] you can't Bluff him he knows it but if
[1:47:20] you're not afraid he knows it too see
[1:47:22] and if an animal by Instinct knows knows
[1:47:24] that what about a man what does a man
[1:47:27] so you cannot fear the enemy don't fear
[1:47:32] [Music]
[1:47:35] they questioned whether brother Branham
[1:47:36] had a big enough gun
[1:47:40] kind of like David I think it's so
[1:47:42] perfect all the parallels David had a
[1:47:45] slingshot well brother Branham only had
[1:47:46] a 270.
[1:47:47] it's a small little gun you know in
[1:47:49] Canada if you ask any of the hunters
[1:47:51] there they'll tell you no he needed 300
[1:47:52] Winchester magnum
[1:47:54] right big gun right because you're going
[1:47:57] to need all the stopping power you can
[1:47:58] get
[1:47:59] brother Brandon went hunting with a 270.
[1:48:02] it's a small little gun
[1:48:07] but see like David they questioned him
[1:48:11] whether a slingshot would work brother
[1:48:13] Branham and David both had something
[1:48:14] bigger than the weapon they held in
[1:48:16] their hands
[1:48:18] see they are they had the word of God
[1:48:20] backing them up
[1:48:22] they had Visions they had anointing amen
[1:48:25] what do you have
[1:48:29] it's not too small
[1:48:31] [Music]
[1:48:32] and the message have become with us to
[1:48:34] fulfill all righteousness prophets says
[1:48:36] this
[1:48:36] now that's the famous bear there's four
[1:48:38] in the grizzly family
[1:48:40] one is the silver silver tip which is
[1:48:43] the famous one next is called the native
[1:48:45] name kadish I think that's interesting
[1:48:47] like kadish barnea which is a black with
[1:48:50] a round ear the second he says third is
[1:48:53] the regular Grizzly which is between
[1:48:55] black and brown a huge bear and the next
[1:48:57] is the Kodiak which is only found on
[1:49:00] Kodiak Island in Western Alaska he's a
[1:49:03] great Mammoth biggest of all the bears
[1:49:06] but he's a grizzly
[1:49:07] excuse me
[1:49:09] but the Silver Tip is black and and the
[1:49:12] white the silver is on the end of the
[1:49:14] tip of the hair he is the famous one
[1:49:16] very high strung ill-tempered bear
[1:49:21] he says and I shot the bear with a heart
[1:49:24] shot
[1:49:25] and killed him
[1:49:28] I just
[1:49:29] I just want you to maybe put that on
[1:49:31] your fridge
[1:49:33] just put that little line on your fridge
[1:49:36] [Applause]
[1:49:39] he says I was questioned the little
[1:49:41] rifle I had about getting it and I told
[1:49:44] the Brethren how many here has heard me
[1:49:46] tell about that before it happened
[1:49:49] yeah he was walking in the vision
[1:49:52] praise the Lord my grandson we are also
[1:49:55] walking in the vision
[1:49:57] every enemy who's under our feet
[1:50:08] oh my so many beautiful things
[1:50:11] brother Branham comes back to British
[1:50:14] Columbia to hunt bear
[1:50:18] the message Israel and and the church he
[1:50:21] says it like this
[1:50:24] because remember he saw the effects of
[1:50:26] what a bear does in the country it
[1:50:28] brings fear it brings doubt
[1:50:30] and so he'll be invited to go places to
[1:50:32] go hunt bear to to deal with a certain
[1:50:34] threat or so forth spiritually and
[1:50:37] naturally speaking
[1:50:38] and here we see in this message he says
[1:50:40] oh when I begin to see them see the way
[1:50:42] they were doing it reminds me here not
[1:50:43] long ago I was on a little vacation
[1:50:45] after I come back from Africa I was up
[1:50:48] here in the Northwoods way up here in
[1:50:50] the Alaskan border a thousand miles from
[1:50:52] hardtop Road
[1:50:54] went back six days perfect number here
[1:50:57] again right after six Church ages or six
[1:51:00] is the number of men again he says went
[1:51:03] back Six Days on Horseback getting Plum
[1:51:05] away from everything and as I went back
[1:51:07] through there I was riding along On My
[1:51:09] Horse one day and it just got scared his
[1:51:12] horse in other words the power he was
[1:51:14] riding right it got nervous it got
[1:51:17] scared a grizzly bear just raised up and
[1:51:20] he got scared
[1:51:22] this isn't I was going down through he
[1:51:24] started running and we got down through
[1:51:26] there and there had been an old burn
[1:51:28] over and there was great big bunch of
[1:51:29] old
[1:51:30] tall trees that stood there and they
[1:51:33] were white there in the Moonlight
[1:51:35] evening time white there in the
[1:51:38] Moonlight
[1:51:39] oh just as stately and strong as they
[1:51:42] could look look could be
[1:51:45] all the life was gone out of them and I
[1:51:48] listened at the winds howling and the
[1:51:50] winds come down through there just
[1:51:52] moaning you know all them old trees all
[1:51:55] would do is just squeak and squawk and
[1:51:57] squeak and squawk what is he in he's in
[1:51:59] Bear Country

[1:52:06] what the Palmer worm left the cattle
[1:52:09] pillar eaten what the caterpillar had
[1:52:12] left the earthworm eaten them churches
[1:52:15] he says oh no doubt just like them trees
[1:52:17] they once were great living statues the
[1:52:21] methodists the Baptists the Presbyterian
[1:52:23] the Pentecostals he says but I tell you
[1:52:26] the fires and scorches of this world has
[1:52:29] scorched all the bark off of them they
[1:52:32] were standing like a big bunch of
[1:52:33] tombstones now just erected up there no
[1:52:36] life in them at all amen that's right
[1:52:38] and when the rushing Mighty Wind comes
[1:52:41] from Heaven down the only thing they do
[1:52:43] is just squeak and squawk and moan and
[1:52:46] talk against it Hallelujah but what we
[1:52:48] need is somebody to accept it foreign
[1:52:52] country
[1:52:55] he says and I noticed oh praise the Lord
[1:52:58] for this
[1:52:59] and I noticed down over there them young
[1:53:01] trees that was coming up we see some
[1:53:04] young trees this morning

[1:53:18] hearing you praise and worship amen just

[1:53:24] old-fashioned God sent Holy Ghost
[1:53:26] Revival Hallelujah
[1:53:28] thank you
[1:53:31] he says when signs and wonders begin to
[1:53:33] come into the church the big old
[1:53:34] churches moan I don't believe in them
[1:53:37] things that's fanaticism the days of
[1:53:40] Miracles has passed and the wind
[1:53:41] whistling through the through down there
[1:53:44] he says in the same ones that made them
[1:53:46] moan give the others Frolic he says oh
[1:53:48] Hallelujah when you shook that tree he
[1:53:51] says every time he gets a shaking it
[1:53:53] loosens up the roots so that it can grow
[1:53:55] down and get a better hold Hallelujah
[1:53:57] that's what we need tonight he says it's
[1:54:00] good old time Holy Ghost shaking that
[1:54:03] goes down inside of you he says he
[1:54:05] loosens up all the dirt around the roots
[1:54:08] Hallelujah so he can dig down and get a
[1:54:11] better hold oh my so we can grow down
[1:54:14] and get a better hold on life it says
[1:54:16] better rooted and grounded in Christ
[1:54:18] Jesus he says them experiences the
[1:54:22] experiences of healing experience of the
[1:54:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost experiences of
[1:54:27] the gifts of the Spirit Hallelujah he
[1:54:29] says it's just anchoring you in Christ
[1:54:32] and the harder that wind blows the
[1:54:34] better it is for you
[1:54:35] [Music]
[1:54:41] he goes on he says Let the church squeak
[1:54:44] and moan if she wants to
[1:54:46] let her say the days of Miracles has
[1:54:48] passed if they want to it's dead anyhow
[1:54:52] and they said we're a church
[1:54:54] so was them trees
[1:54:57] but look at them no bark on them just
[1:55:00] blistered all the bark done burnt off
[1:55:02] they couldn't pack the life up anymore
[1:55:05] that's all the bark they've done went
[1:55:07] out there and made their rituals and so
[1:55:09] forth so that they can't even have any
[1:55:11] bark on them anymore which is the word
[1:55:13] which is your protection
[1:55:15] nothing but just a squeak and squawk
[1:55:17] when the winds are blowing but God sent
[1:55:20] the wind just the sand
[1:55:23] so this little bitty church is coming up
[1:55:25] this little handful
[1:55:32] oh my my brother and sister but I want
[1:55:34] you to notice the scene that this is all
[1:55:36] happening in it's in a dark forest with
[1:55:38] trees in the Moonlight showing the
[1:55:41] evidence of the wars and things that
[1:55:42] have gone on has ripped off its bark and
[1:55:45] there's no life in them trees and he's
[1:55:46] hunting bear in that country but my
[1:55:48] brother and sister there's young trees
[1:55:50] growing up
[1:55:51] it's got some life in it
[1:55:54] we may just be a handful my brother and
[1:55:56] sister
[1:55:57] he says they were just having a big time
[1:55:59] with it while the rest of them was
[1:56:01] carrying on about it he says oh my we
[1:56:03] need God's power back in the church
[1:56:06] [Applause]
[1:56:10] amen
[1:56:12] praise the Lord
[1:56:14] you know they um
[1:56:18] they'll tell you when you're hunting
[1:56:19] bear and bear attacks you or you know or
[1:56:22] maybe let's say you're you're just being
[1:56:24] attacked by a bear
[1:56:25] they they give you advice for that they
[1:56:27] tell you to play dead
[1:56:32] play dead
[1:56:34] you know there's some truth to that
[1:56:36] because we are dead in Christ
[1:56:39] you know but my brother and sister let's
[1:56:41] just look at what the prophet said here
[1:56:43] about destroying the Bear in our lives
[1:56:46] and I'm closing with a few of these
[1:56:48] quotes here
[1:56:50] amen
[1:56:52] he says for instance
[1:56:55] I've often said if there's a big animal
[1:56:57] here on the platform a big bear or a
[1:56:59] lion and he had his claw in my side and
[1:57:02] was tearing my side out it would
[1:57:05] wouldn't be necessary for me to try to
[1:57:07] find some kind of a knife that would cut
[1:57:09] his claw off if I just knock the thing
[1:57:12] in the head it would kill the claw and
[1:57:15] all
[1:57:16] and it would take care of the whole
[1:57:18] thing as long as I killed the animal
[1:57:20] killed its head
[1:57:22] you see that's exactly what David showed
[1:57:24] us he went up to Goliath he took the
[1:57:27] sword and he chopped his head off
[1:57:30] amen
[1:57:31] [Applause]
[1:57:34] he says while the head of every one of
[1:57:36] every one of the attributes of Sin is
[1:57:39] Sin and when Jesus come dealing with sin
[1:57:41] at Calvary he killed sin he killed every
[1:57:44] attribute that goes with it amen
[1:57:46] completely redeemed us back to God and
[1:57:49] today we are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:57:51] perfectly Redeemed by A Perfect Redeemer
[1:57:54] the Lord Jesus Christ amen oh that makes
[1:57:57] me glad to think about that see but
[1:58:00] David knew that it's not going to matter
[1:58:02] my brother and sister and this morning
[1:58:03] we know that this morning and let's not
[1:58:05] waste our time trying to pull out this
[1:58:07] little claw and trying to pull this
[1:58:09] little thing out let's get him right at
[1:58:11] the head foreign
[1:58:14] by the way he killed Goliath sever the
[1:58:18] head
[1:58:19] that's the same way we will overcome
[1:58:22] he has put every enemy under our feet
[1:58:25] I've got three more quotes
[1:58:28] the musicians can come
[1:58:30] praise the Lord
[1:58:32] he says but we still have a God who can
[1:58:35] live deliver the sheep from the lion can
[1:58:37] deliver the sheep from the bear
[1:58:39] but I know one thing there was a bear a
[1:58:42] cancer a tumor a blindness and even
[1:58:45] death grabbed some of God's shape one
[1:58:48] day
[1:58:49] and I went forced with the power of God
[1:58:51] and I slew him and brought that sheep
[1:58:53] back that's right and we go forth today
[1:58:56] we go forth today not with any great
[1:58:59] something so and so I go forth with a
[1:59:02] plain little slingshot of prayer oh
[1:59:05] Hallelujah it'll bring her back every
[1:59:07] time
[1:59:08] do you believe that don't you sister you
[1:59:11] believe it too don't you sister
[1:59:13] [Applause]
[1:59:19] he says the god of Heaven has let me
[1:59:21] deliver a lamb out of the mouth of the
[1:59:23] Lion
[1:59:24] out of the mouth of a bear he knew it
[1:59:26] wasn't a slingshot it was the power of
[1:59:29] God that went with him the anointing
[1:59:32] that he had on his life
[1:59:33] you see he was the one that brought that
[1:59:35] lamb back
[1:59:36] [Music]
[1:59:39] and that's the way we say today God's
[1:59:42] God David sticking around oh yes sir we
[1:59:46] have some Davids this morning
[1:59:48] that's feeding father sheep and once in
[1:59:51] a while the tumor will come or a cancer
[1:59:52] will come or something and jump Plum out
[1:59:55] of the hands of the doctor he says that
[1:59:57] won't stop that David he'll go right on
[2:00:00] out there after that little fellow with
[2:00:02] a little slingshot off ask anything in
[2:00:04] my name
[2:00:05] and it shall be given
[2:00:08] I don't care the doctors can laugh and
[2:00:11] everybody else can make fun of him he'll
[2:00:13] go after him anyhow bring that sheep
[2:00:15] back to the fold yes sir it's God's
[2:00:18] child take your hands off of him
[2:00:21] knock this lion down then the lion rose
[2:00:24] up and he grabbed him by the beard and
[2:00:26] he killed him
[2:00:28] a little bitty ready boy probably weigh
[2:00:31] just 80 or 90 pounds

[2:00:35] anointing this morning
