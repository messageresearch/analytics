[56:19] and moses said unto the lord
[56:22] see
[56:23] thou sayeth unto me bring up this people
[56:26] and thou hast not let me know whom thou
[56:29] will send with me
[56:31] yet thou has said i know thee by name
[56:34] and thou
[56:36] and thou has also found grace in my
[56:38] sight
[56:39] now therefore i pray thee if i have
[56:42] found grace in my sight show me now thy
[56:45] way that i may know thee
[56:47] that i may find grace in thy sight and
[56:50] consider that this nation is thy people
[56:54] and he said
[56:56] my presence shall go with thee
[56:58] and i will give thee rest
[57:01] and he said unto him
[57:02] if thy presence go not with me carry us
[57:06] not up hence
[57:08] for when shall it be known here that i
[57:11] and thy people have found grace in thy
[57:13] sight
[57:14] is it not and that thou goest with us
[57:17] so shall we be separated i and thy
[57:19] people from all the people that are upon
[57:21] the face of the earth and the lord said
[57:23] unto moses i will do this thing also
[57:25] that thou hast spoken for thou hast
[57:27] found grace in my sight and i know thee

[58:41] we just want to submit ourselves unto
[58:43] your great divine hand for your glory we
[58:45] ask all these things in jesus christ's
[58:47] name amen
[58:48] amen god bless you you may have your
[58:50] seats this morning i'd like to speak
[58:53] about
[58:54] uh
[58:55] being in his presence
[58:57] he said my presence will go with thee
[58:59] and i will give thee rest now
[59:03] to me this is a very deep
[59:04] uh and powerful part of the scripture
[59:08] it's a very powerful thing you see where
[59:09] moses if you could if we could just go
[59:12] where moses was just there so so they
[59:14] had moses had been commissioned at the
[59:17] burning bush he'd you know he said yo
[59:19] god said i've heard the cries of my
[59:21] people and behold i'm sending you to
[59:22] deliver them out of the hand of the
[59:23] egyptians so god went with him
[59:25] commissioned him that he went down into
[59:27] egypt you know all the plagues were done
[59:29] all the judgments came upon egypt
[59:30] because the hardness of pharaoh god had
[59:33] delivered israel out of the hand of the
[59:34] egyptians they'd cross the red sea
[59:37] that done many mighty things god had
[59:39] done but yet
[59:40] moses and i and and to me i feel like
[59:43] he's really expressing the heart of
[59:46] every real sincere genuine believer that
[59:49] they want to know they have found grace
[59:52] or divine favor in the sight of the lord
[59:55] isn't that really what we want to know
[59:57] lord i want to know i've found grace in
[59:58] your sight you've done so much for me
[1:00:00] already you've taken me from from sin
[1:00:03] and death and shame and you know you've
[1:00:05] broken the shackles of the devil off my
[1:00:07] life but yet i still want to know have i
[1:00:09] found grace in your sight you know to me
[1:00:11] he's expressing really the heart of
[1:00:13] every true believer
[1:00:15] you know he's
[1:00:16] they had journeyed you know they were
[1:00:18] journeying says like every true believer
[1:00:21] you know they want to know if they found
[1:00:23] grace in the sight of the lord because a
[1:00:25] true believer doesn't take god's
[1:00:27] salvation for granted
[1:00:28] right it's not common to them it's not
[1:00:31] some but it's still an incredible thing
[1:00:34] you know when you think about the lord
[1:00:35] jesus you know when he stepped out of
[1:00:37] history to you
[1:00:39] you know how incredible when he made his
[1:00:41] life made his word live in your life you
[1:00:44] know when he answered your hungry hearts
[1:00:45] cry
[1:00:46] oh god there must be more to life than
[1:00:49] than what i'm experiencing and i heard
[1:00:52] you know i believe you're real but lord
[1:00:53] i want to see you real i want to see you
[1:00:55] step out of history i just don't want to
[1:00:57] read the bible and and walk on and
[1:00:59] nothing happened to me but i want to see
[1:01:00] you the god of the bible come and make
[1:01:03] your word live in my life
[1:01:04] and him and his great sovereignty said
[1:01:07] i'll answer that cry i'll answer you
[1:01:09] amen i will actually show you my glory
[1:01:12] i'll show you my power i'll show you my
[1:01:14] word is still the same that i have not
[1:01:16] changed that i will show you that i'm
[1:01:18] not just a god of history that i'm not
[1:01:20] just someone else's god but i'll be your
[1:01:22] god amen and he does far more than you
[1:01:25] can ever imagine
[1:01:27] hallelujah we just cry out for salvation
[1:01:29] he does more than just save us
[1:01:31] amen but he fills us with his spirit
[1:01:33] amen he proves his word to us time and
[1:01:36] time again is the same thing with moses
[1:01:38] god proved himself time and time again i
[1:01:42] mean he proved himself in pharaoh's
[1:01:44] palace there turning you know you know
[1:01:46] the serpent eating up all the other
[1:01:48] magicians serpents you know he proved
[1:01:50] himself when the red sea you know was
[1:01:52] part he proved himself when you know
[1:01:54] they came to that place of bitter water
[1:01:56] and god showed him what tree to cut down
[1:01:58] to throw it into the bitter experience
[1:02:00] to make it sweet and you know it's just
[1:02:02] like us we have bitter experiences in
[1:02:03] our life but there's a tree that can be
[1:02:05] cut down and put into your experience to
[1:02:07] make it sweet and that is the cross of
[1:02:09] calvary amen if you can take any
[1:02:11] experience into calvary it will become
[1:02:13] sweet hallelujah it won't change the
[1:02:15] experience but it will make it sweet in
[1:02:16] your memory amy because god you'll see
[1:02:19] that god is working out something for
[1:02:20] your good hallelujah so you know they
[1:02:23] you know god gave them manna from heaven
[1:02:25] he did all incredible things but yet
[1:02:27] moses wanted to know
[1:02:30] can we know we've found grace in your
[1:02:31] sight
[1:02:32] you think about it it was grace that
[1:02:34] brought them out of egypt it wasn't
[1:02:35] their own ability that brought them out
[1:02:37] of egypt it was god's grace god god sent
[1:02:40] his deliverer amen it was god that sent
[1:02:42] it you know sure they had a cry oh god
[1:02:45] we when we deliver us but it's one thing
[1:02:47] to cry to god is nothing for god to
[1:02:48] answer that cry hallelujah to me you
[1:02:51] think about that you know that makes me
[1:02:53] feel about this big
[1:02:54] we're the great god of glory the great
[1:02:57] one who's the alpha and the omega the
[1:02:58] beginning and the end who made all time
[1:03:00] and all space and fills all eternity the
[1:03:03] great being that he is and yet he comes
[1:03:05] down to to this little speck in the
[1:03:07] middle of the milky way and reveals
[1:03:09] himself to you and i am
[1:03:11] hallelujah
[1:03:13] amen we should always be thankful we
[1:03:16] should never let that see the devil
[1:03:17] wants the devil wants our testimony to
[1:03:20] become common to us but we should never
[1:03:22] ever let it become common it should be
[1:03:24] rich and great every day and we should
[1:03:27] really as we walk with him we should
[1:03:28] just appreciate them more
[1:03:30] hallelujah no doubt moses appreciated
[1:03:32] when when when god came and spoke to him
[1:03:35] in the burning bush but he would have
[1:03:36] appreciated god more when he had his
[1:03:38] first contest with pharaoh and then the
[1:03:40] next contest and the next contest the
[1:03:41] next contest and then he would
[1:03:43] appreciate him even more when israel was
[1:03:45] crying out you've brought us to a death
[1:03:47] trap here by the red sea but god says
[1:03:49] you know just raise up your staff and
[1:03:50] i'll park the waters he would appreciate
[1:03:52] it in there more holy and everything god
[1:03:55] did for him
[1:03:56] and even with his temper even with his
[1:03:58] trouble i mean god still did great
[1:04:00] things for him and the thing is you
[1:04:02] think about you and i even with our
[1:04:03] humanity and our failures and our and
[1:04:06] our sticky bits that we can't stand god
[1:04:08] still answers prayer god still
[1:04:10] undertakes for us god still fights our
[1:04:12] battles god still protects us god still
[1:04:15] leads us
[1:04:16] hallelujah so it should never become
[1:04:19] common it should just be richer i pray
[1:04:22] that 2022 would just be a great love
[1:04:24] affair between us and god
[1:04:26] hallelujah should just be honeymoon time
[1:04:28] irrespective of what's going on let the
[1:04:30] world fall apart we can't stop that but
[1:04:32] we can fall in love with jesus more and
[1:04:34] more every day
[1:04:35] so i pray this a real because that's
[1:04:37] what christianity really is it's a love
[1:04:38] affair between you and jesus christ
[1:04:41] amen
[1:04:43] amen we should always be thankful now um
[1:04:46] we won't read it but to save time if you
[1:04:48] read the second part of romans chapter
[1:04:50] one it shows a sequence of basically the
[1:04:53] degeneration of man
[1:04:56] where they start off knowing god but
[1:04:58] they didn't glorify him as god and they
[1:05:01] became unthankful that it fell down to
[1:05:03] basically what the world is today
[1:05:05] now
[1:05:06] the big main two factors of that
[1:05:08] degradation of man is that they didn't
[1:05:10] glorify god as god and they are
[1:05:12] unthankful this is from romans 1 and 21
[1:05:15] because that when they knew god they
[1:05:16] glorified him not as god neither were
[1:05:18] thankful but became vain in their
[1:05:20] imaginations and foolish and in their
[1:05:22] foolish heart was darkened
[1:05:25] so this now to me now i want to do the
[1:05:27] opposite of this
[1:05:29] i mean so so they we don't so
[1:05:32] yes i want to do the opposite so i'm
[1:05:34] going to worship and praise god
[1:05:36] irrespective of my circumstances now we
[1:05:39] know god but we can glorify him not as
[1:05:42] god well then how do you do that if
[1:05:44] you're a believer you just glorify him
[1:05:46] as an errand boy
[1:05:47] now an errand boy does things you ask
[1:05:49] him to do
[1:05:50] so people will not people will just
[1:05:52] worship god based on what he does for
[1:05:55] them how much blessings they get how
[1:05:57] many answered prayers they get now we
[1:05:58] should thank him for those things but
[1:06:00] when times are tough where's the praise
[1:06:03] right because we don't i don't love the
[1:06:05] lord because he answers prayer
[1:06:07] no i i love the lord because of who he
[1:06:09] is and what he's done for me he saved my
[1:06:11] soul i mean that's more than enough if
[1:06:14] he never does a single thing
[1:06:16] anymore in my life amen he's already
[1:06:18] done more than enough
[1:06:19] amen why because he's he saved me he
[1:06:21] filled me with his holy ghost he set me
[1:06:23] free from every chain of the devil and
[1:06:25] i'm on my way to heaven shouting victory
[1:06:28] i mean so if he never does a single
[1:06:29] thing doesn't answer a single prayer i
[1:06:31] mean anymore he's already done more than
[1:06:33] enough and he's given me more than
[1:06:36] enough to praise him for
[1:06:38] because he's revealed himself to me i
[1:06:41] know him who he is
[1:06:43] obese we should praise god and worship
[1:06:45] him based on who he is
[1:06:47] not just on what he does for us i thank
[1:06:49] god when he answers prayer who's
[1:06:51] thankful when he answers prayer and a no
[1:06:53] is as good as a yes right as long as he
[1:06:55] gives me an answer i'm happy amen so i'm
[1:06:57] thankful when he heals my children or
[1:06:59] heals me or heals my wife or you know
[1:07:01] provides for us or gives an answer or
[1:07:03] leads us in certain you know different
[1:07:04] circumstances where we don't know the
[1:07:06] way i'm thankful for all of that
[1:07:08] but yet i don't get upset when he
[1:07:11] doesn't seem to do those things
[1:07:13] amen i worship him because of who he is
[1:07:15] not just because not i don't glorify him
[1:07:18] as an errand boy i glorify him as god
[1:07:23] hallelujah so
[1:07:25] so we want to glorify him as god and we
[1:07:27] want to be thankful
[1:07:30] hallelujah to praise him anyway
[1:07:33] amen
[1:07:34] if if your world falls apart praise him
[1:07:37] if everything's going good please praise
[1:07:40] him if you don't know the way out of the
[1:07:42] situation praise him if it seems like
[1:07:44] his answer lingers praise him
[1:07:46] praise him in the storm praise him in
[1:07:48] the good times praise him in the bad
[1:07:50] hallelujah don't you know don't be upset
[1:07:53] at him he's working all things out feel
[1:07:55] good
[1:07:56] hallelujah
[1:07:58] amen so
[1:08:00] if you become unthankful towards the
[1:08:02] lord then things become common
[1:08:05] we don't want to be unthankful
[1:08:07] i have a mansion
[1:08:09] hallelujah i have a mansion if it's near
[1:08:11] jesus or if it's on the i don't know the
[1:08:14] edge of the city
[1:08:16] praise the lord
[1:08:17] if i get one glimpse at him if he even
[1:08:19] if i need a telescope to see him i'll be
[1:08:22] glad i get to see him hallelujah that's
[1:08:24] how i feel i'm not worried i mean i'll
[1:08:26] be next door you know what i mean but
[1:08:28] but hey david said i'd rather be a
[1:08:30] doorkeeper in the house of god so a
[1:08:32] doorkeeper they just let people in they
[1:08:34] open the door they shut the door they
[1:08:36] don't go on themselves but they're just
[1:08:37] a door keeper i'd rather be like that
[1:08:39] like david said that he said i'd rather
[1:08:41] be a a doorkeeper in the house of god
[1:08:43] than dwell in the tents of the wicked
[1:08:46] so hey if i'm a doormat if i'm on the
[1:08:47] outside and i just let people in praise
[1:08:49] the lord as long as i'm part of god's
[1:08:51] great you know kingdom for eternity that
[1:08:54] would make me real happy
[1:08:57] hallelujah so
[1:08:58] you know but but then the next step of
[1:09:00] this and i'm not i'm not going to dwell
[1:09:01] on this too much but the next step of
[1:09:03] being unthankful is people become vain
[1:09:04] in their imaginations
[1:09:06] now this this really comes down among
[1:09:08] believers all this because i put this
[1:09:10] all on me
[1:09:11] right the world will do what it does but
[1:09:14] the word needs to apply to me
[1:09:16] right this is not a pitchforking i did a
[1:09:18] bit of you know i you know i spent a bit
[1:09:20] of time on my friends farms growing up
[1:09:22] they never made hay and so i'm not going
[1:09:24] to make hay now and pitchfork it to be
[1:09:25] you know i'm not going to pitch for the
[1:09:27] work to other people i'm just going to
[1:09:28] apply it all to myself so people can
[1:09:30] become
[1:09:31] vain in their imaginations
[1:09:33] even even as believers no
[1:09:36] and and vain means it it becomes empty
[1:09:39] now it's very interesting if um in in
[1:09:43] philippians chapter 2
[1:09:45] where where we love the piece of
[1:09:46] scripture it says but let this minors in
[1:09:48] christ be in you
[1:09:50] but before that verse the apostle paul
[1:09:52] says let nothing be done through strife
[1:09:55] or vainglory but in loneliness of mind
[1:09:58] let each esteem the other better than
[1:10:00] themselves now this that word strife
[1:10:03] actually means it means to be um to have
[1:10:06] affection
[1:10:07] faction means you split off you have
[1:10:09] your own little group and it actually
[1:10:10] speaks about being like political
[1:10:13] so so don't do things through factions
[1:10:16] you know of of well well we believe this
[1:10:19] and this church is different so so we're
[1:10:21] just going to put them on the outside
[1:10:22] and this person is different here so
[1:10:24] this is my faction because they don't
[1:10:26] fit in my group and you know so don't
[1:10:28] let anything bad be done that way
[1:10:31] right
[1:10:32] and because what is that that's actually
[1:10:34] people become vain in their imaginations
[1:10:36] where they compare themselves with
[1:10:38] themselves because the bible says if you
[1:10:40] compare ourselves with ourselves we
[1:10:41] become wise i mean unwise so if we so if
[1:10:44] i compare myself to you i'm unwise but
[1:10:48] if i compare myself
[1:10:49] to the word i become wise
[1:10:52] right so we shouldn't let we yeah i pray
[1:10:55] we never get down that road because
[1:10:57] we're all human right but we should love
[1:10:59] the lord more we should appreciate them
[1:11:00] more we should be more thankful
[1:11:03] every day
[1:11:05] amen now moses said in in verse 16 if
[1:11:08] you want to pop that back up
[1:11:10] um he says for wherein shall it be no
[1:11:14] one here
[1:11:16] if i can find this for wherein shall it
[1:11:19] be known here that i and thy people have
[1:11:21] found grace in thy sight
[1:11:23] is it not in that thou gost with us
[1:11:27] so
[1:11:28] so shall we be separated i am thy people
[1:11:31] from all the people that are upon the
[1:11:32] face of the earth so he's asking wherein
[1:11:35] shall it be known so so how shall we
[1:11:37] isn't this how it shall be known that
[1:11:39] we're found grace is because your
[1:11:40] presence is with us
[1:11:42] right this is this is verse 16
[1:11:45] and so so moses knew
[1:11:48] that how he and the people had found
[1:11:51] grace in the sight of god is that the
[1:11:53] presence of the lord was with them
[1:11:56] now this is fundamental
[1:11:58] in the christian walk
[1:12:00] because jesus said i'll never leave thee
[1:12:02] nor forsake thee he said i'll be with
[1:12:04] you even in you i personal pronoun will
[1:12:06] be with you even in you to the end of
[1:12:07] the world
[1:12:08] so
[1:12:09] so the evidence if you know the evidence
[1:12:12] that that that we have found or one of
[1:12:14] the evidence is that we've found grace
[1:12:16] in the sight of the lord is that his
[1:12:17] presence is with us
[1:12:19] this is fundamental because people can
[1:12:22] because it's not just having the right
[1:12:24] word
[1:12:26] that proves he's with you
[1:12:28] now don't get well you can get quiet on
[1:12:30] me but maybe he's
[1:12:31] just thinking about this but the apostle
[1:12:33] paul said the letter killeth but the
[1:12:34] spirit giveth life
[1:12:36] so it's actually the holy ghost comes
[1:12:38] and anoints the word and makes it live
[1:12:40] in our hearts right it's not just having
[1:12:42] the right word you must we must have
[1:12:44] word and spirit
[1:12:46] right we can't have just spirit
[1:12:48] but we can't just have word we must have
[1:12:50] both together right so i believe that we
[1:12:53] have been restored back to the apostolic
[1:12:55] faith the original faith of the fathers
[1:12:57] right the original faith of the bible i
[1:12:59] believe we've been restored back to the
[1:13:00] book of acts
[1:13:01] right so what the apostles believe we
[1:13:03] believe what the apostle paul taught we
[1:13:05] believe
[1:13:06] amen but you but we must have the spirit
[1:13:09] of god to quicken it and make it live
[1:13:11] amen it's absolutely fundamental because
[1:13:14] if we do not have the spirit of god i
[1:13:16] mean to make the word live then it's all
[1:13:18] head knowledge
[1:13:20] and head knowledge will fall apart
[1:13:22] i mean it doesn't have a firm foundation
[1:13:24] it won't stand the storms right but if
[1:13:26] it's but if it's a revelation if the if
[1:13:28] the spirit of god quickens the word to
[1:13:30] our hearts and makes it a revelation i
[1:13:32] mean then the it'll stand the storm
[1:13:35] it'll stand the test
[1:13:36] amen now if we have if if we have the
[1:13:39] presence of god
[1:13:41] then
[1:13:42] there's a certain atmosphere that goes
[1:13:45] with us
[1:13:47] but i was going to back up and say this
[1:13:49] brother brahm said he said in time of
[1:13:50] decision he says the angel of the lord
[1:13:52] accompanies the message always
[1:13:54] that's it that's the spirit of god in
[1:13:56] angelic form
[1:13:58] right
[1:13:58] i mean so so we must have the spirit of
[1:14:01] god in our lives this maybe you may
[1:14:04] think this is very elementary no because
[1:14:06] it's very important
[1:14:08] it's the most important thing
[1:14:10] i mean that that god lives in our lives
[1:14:12] like never before we need him more and
[1:14:14] more the difference but you know this
[1:14:16] jesus would give the parable of the wise
[1:14:18] and foolish virgins
[1:14:19] right they're all virgin clean living to
[1:14:21] the word right but only five had the oil
[1:14:25] only five had the oil and the ones that
[1:14:27] had the oil went into the marriage
[1:14:29] supper right the ones who did not they
[1:14:31] were without
[1:14:32] so the lord in this parable is saying
[1:14:34] that it's fundamental that we have the
[1:14:36] holy ghost
[1:14:38] right his presence goes with us
[1:14:41] amen not just that we step into his
[1:14:43] presence one time and then leave it but
[1:14:45] he goes with us on the journey i mean
[1:14:48] that he leads us because he says my
[1:14:50] presence will go with thee and i will
[1:14:51] give thee rest
[1:14:54] amen now
[1:14:56] jesus in in his last commission to the
[1:14:59] church now we're just jumping
[1:15:01] uh into the new testament there it says
[1:15:04] here and jesus would say in mark 16
[1:15:08] he'd say after he would list out he
[1:15:10] would say and he said unto them go into
[1:15:12] all the world and preach the gospel
[1:15:14] about me to every creature
[1:15:16] and he that believeth and is baptized is
[1:15:18] saved but he that believeth not shall be
[1:15:21] damned and these signs shall follow them
[1:15:23] that believe so this is not just the
[1:15:25] apostles but it's to every believer down
[1:15:27] through the ages
[1:15:28] in my name they shall cast out devils
[1:15:30] they shall speak with new tongues they
[1:15:32] shall take up serpents and if they drink
[1:15:34] any deadly thing it shall not hurt them
[1:15:35] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:15:37] they shall recover so then after the
[1:15:39] lord had spoken unto them he was
[1:15:41] received up into heaven and sat on the
[1:15:43] right hand of god and they went forth
[1:15:45] and preached everywhere the lord working
[1:15:48] with them and confirming the word with
[1:15:50] signs following amen
[1:15:53] right so the presence of god went with
[1:15:55] the believers in the first age
[1:15:58] amen confirming the word with science
[1:16:01] following
[1:16:02] amen and if we have been restored back
[1:16:04] to that age should should that not be
[1:16:06] happening with us as well
[1:16:08] i mean we're not all called to be
[1:16:09] preachers or apostles or you know
[1:16:11] pastors evangelists or teachers but the
[1:16:13] spirit of god should be with each and
[1:16:15] every one of us i mean confirming the
[1:16:17] word making it live
[1:16:19] hallelujah
[1:16:21] amen
[1:16:22] now brother brown was saying he must be
[1:16:24] born again
[1:16:26] speaking of the nature that's that
[1:16:28] that's been put within us but also
[1:16:29] speaks about god he also read this he
[1:16:31] says now what kind of a nature have you
[1:16:33] got then brother branham he says his
[1:16:35] nature see if god is in you you've got
[1:16:36] his divine nature if i had my father's
[1:16:39] nature then i'd do the things my father
[1:16:40] did but now that i'm born again it
[1:16:42] depends on who my father was if we're
[1:16:45] just born in the church you've got a
[1:16:47] church father
[1:16:48] and you can call him father if you want
[1:16:50] to you call him anything you want to
[1:16:52] because he's your father but if your
[1:16:54] father is god and you're born in the
[1:16:56] family of god seek those things that
[1:16:58] pertain to god that's right then you are
[1:17:01] god's child your nature is god's nature
[1:17:04] um then
[1:17:05] um
[1:17:06] then when some oh you hear them some say
[1:17:08] oh our church believes the days of
[1:17:10] miracles is past how could you believe
[1:17:12] the days of miracles was passed when the
[1:17:14] very nature of god is in you when he is
[1:17:16] altogether miracle his nature's miracle
[1:17:18] his habits miracle his whole being is
[1:17:21] miracle how can you be anything but
[1:17:23] miracle your new birth is miracle i mean
[1:17:26] things are dead this is right see you're
[1:17:27] a new creature a new creation sure
[1:17:31] amen so he says here that you know he is
[1:17:34] altogether miracle goddess
[1:17:36] i mean so if he goes with us i mean we
[1:17:39] should see his fingerprints in our lives
[1:17:42] i mean of the supernatural
[1:17:45] not just in signs and healings and
[1:17:46] wonders but in our character and because
[1:17:49] he's looking for a people who have his
[1:17:51] divine character
[1:17:53] amen
[1:17:54] now as i said before before i backtrack
[1:17:57] back to that i said you know if his
[1:17:59] presence is is in a place or in a
[1:18:01] person's life they have a different kind
[1:18:03] of an atmosphere
[1:18:04] amen and that atmosphere is the
[1:18:06] atmosphere of god now we can
[1:18:09] we can live
[1:18:10] in different atmospheres
[1:18:12] you know brother ram says that we bump
[1:18:13] into devils all the time we don't
[1:18:15] realize
[1:18:16] you know so we can be in a very dark
[1:18:18] atmosphere but i believe we're called to
[1:18:20] live in a very light atmosphere
[1:18:22] i'm in an atmosphere of the holy ghost
[1:18:24] that's where he wants you to dwell too
[1:18:25] by the way it's not just us longing to
[1:18:27] be in his presence he wants you in his
[1:18:29] presence
[1:18:30] amen and he's made a way for us to dwell
[1:18:32] in his presence forevermore
[1:18:33] i mean by his precious blood now now if
[1:18:36] you look at nature if you look at nature
[1:18:39] around the world based on the amount of
[1:18:41] water in those places there's different
[1:18:43] kind of wildlife
[1:18:44] amen in new zealand we've got
[1:18:46] predominantly rain forest
[1:18:48] there's a lot of rain there's a lot of
[1:18:50] big trees you don't see cactus growing
[1:18:52] here even on the desert road that ain't
[1:18:55] really desert you know i don't see how
[1:18:57] it's cool but i mean i guess maybe
[1:18:59] comparing to the rest of the country
[1:19:00] it's desert but it ain't desert amen
[1:19:03] compared to other parts of the world you
[1:19:04] go to the sahara that's desert
[1:19:06] right the desert road ain't there's it's
[1:19:08] sahara is desert okay but the reason is
[1:19:11] is because in the sahara there's not a
[1:19:13] lot of rain
[1:19:14] it does snow from time to time very
[1:19:16] rarely but the but the soil is so de
[1:19:18] great it's just sand there's nothing
[1:19:19] there to absorb the water and bring
[1:19:21] forth life and you go to different parts
[1:19:23] of the world where it's more dry there's
[1:19:25] things like cactus there's different
[1:19:27] kind of life because of the atmosphere
[1:19:29] it lives in very dry harsh climate
[1:19:31] right so now if you take that into the
[1:19:34] spiritual
[1:19:35] you can see what kind of atmosphere that
[1:19:37] we live in
[1:19:38] right because based on our nature and
[1:19:40] our character it depends on what kind of
[1:19:41] nature we live in now we know the
[1:19:43] scripture says that i believe psalms 1
[1:19:46] that you know if we you know we'd be
[1:19:48] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:19:49] many water right so so people actually
[1:19:52] in the bible are likened unto trees
[1:19:55] right so the kind of condition that you
[1:19:56] live in will produce a certain life out
[1:19:59] of you
[1:19:59] amen so now brother man would saying god
[1:20:02] identifying himself by his
[1:20:03] characteristics and say i come from
[1:20:05] tucson
[1:20:06] where it's really good and dry and i
[1:20:08] come here and it's really good and wet
[1:20:11] so there's quite a contrast if you have
[1:20:13] got all um if you
[1:20:16] if you all got all the water over here
[1:20:18] and you send it over our way we'd
[1:20:20] appreciate it but of course you can't do
[1:20:22] it but i tell you one thing there's a
[1:20:23] parable there all the things in arizona
[1:20:26] are trees it's full of stickers
[1:20:28] everything has a sticker because it's
[1:20:29] dry now if some bush growth over here
[1:20:32] would be nice and lovely leaf see
[1:20:34] without it's without water that's the
[1:20:36] reason it becomes a sticker
[1:20:38] and when the church becomes without the
[1:20:41] water of life it gets dry and sticky too
[1:20:44] sticking and punching at everything but
[1:20:46] where the water of life flows it opens
[1:20:48] up the leaf and makes it tender mellow
[1:20:50] sweet holy acceptable unto the lord so
[1:20:52] may the lord god water us
[1:20:55] that we won't be stickers but we'll find
[1:20:58] leaves that wayward people may sit down
[1:21:00] under the
[1:21:01] tree of our shade and find rest to their
[1:21:03] souls why because the atmosphere is
[1:21:06] different it makes people different
[1:21:09] i mean you you take people who live very
[1:21:11] tense kind of hard you know stressful
[1:21:13] clown lives it's because there's an
[1:21:14] atmosphere there that creates it but you
[1:21:17] get those same people and you bring them
[1:21:18] under the presence of god it mallows
[1:21:21] them out it makes them sweet it makes
[1:21:23] them kind it makes them understanding it
[1:21:25] makes them gentle why because they're
[1:21:27] living in his presence
[1:21:29] where before they're not in his presence
[1:21:32] once your thing you walked out the
[1:21:33] presence of god is your carnal nature
[1:21:35] just flares up
[1:21:37] right but then you repent and god comes
[1:21:39] back because really god never leaves us
[1:21:42] we leave the lord
[1:21:43] we're the one who steps off the path he
[1:21:45] just keeps going on but i'm so thankful
[1:21:48] just a heart a real repentant heart
[1:21:50] he'll come back to where we are
[1:21:52] amen so now so so it's fundamental that
[1:21:56] the reason that we dwell in his presence
[1:21:58] is that it produces the character of the
[1:22:00] word
[1:22:02] in our lives
[1:22:03] i mean so we don't want to be full of
[1:22:05] stickers where we're just looking at
[1:22:06] each other's faults and we can't we
[1:22:08] can't bypass our you know different
[1:22:11] problems and things going on and
[1:22:13] everything's just a big issue and a
[1:22:14] problem we don't want to be like that
[1:22:16] no but we want to live in such a way now
[1:22:18] i'm not saying you're not living like
[1:22:19] this i just want to say there's such a
[1:22:21] great thing that his grace has come upon
[1:22:24] us so greatly
[1:22:25] that his presence is with us
[1:22:27] amen
[1:22:29] so we don't want to get ever in such a
[1:22:31] state where we can't overlook our
[1:22:32] brother or sister's faults amen and it's
[1:22:35] just everything we see is bad bad bad
[1:22:37] now when i look actually i see good good
[1:22:39] good i see the goodness and mercy of god
[1:22:43] i see his grace i see his redemption i
[1:22:45] see his mercy i see his forgiveness i
[1:22:47] mean i see the effect of his blood upon
[1:22:49] a people hallelujah where people have
[1:22:51] been sealed away from the wrath is to
[1:22:53] come amen our walking on the king's
[1:22:55] highway up into glory that's what i see
[1:22:57] i see redemption i see the apple of
[1:23:00] god's eye upon the earth
[1:23:02] amen i see those who are accepted in the
[1:23:04] beloved that's what i see that's what i
[1:23:05] see when i'm looking at you now that's
[1:23:07] what i see i see a people full of faith
[1:23:09] i see people that are rugged aiming were
[1:23:11] overcoming power it doesn't matter what
[1:23:13] the devil throws at them they're going
[1:23:15] to be steadfast and sure i mean if they
[1:23:17] fall they'll get back up amen and
[1:23:19] they'll be quick to repent amen they'll
[1:23:20] be quick to forgive i mean they'll
[1:23:22] overlook one another's faults amen
[1:23:24] they'll see the best in one another
[1:23:25] that's what i see when i see you amen i
[1:23:28] see a people amen made in his image amen
[1:23:31] hallelujah that's what i see
[1:23:33] you may see something different than me
[1:23:34] but just pray for me
[1:23:36] right but you know that's what i see
[1:23:38] i see a group that's going to march up
[1:23:40] into heaven
[1:23:41] we'll be part of that great big number
[1:23:43] around the throne amen we'll cast our
[1:23:45] crowns down at his feet and worship him
[1:23:47] forever more and hallelujah see him face
[1:23:49] to face and amen we need you we're you
[1:23:51] know each and every one of us goes and
[1:23:53] gets their reward we'll be cheering the
[1:23:54] loudest hallelujah
[1:23:56] hallelujah
[1:23:58] amen that's what i see
[1:24:00] amen i believe that's what we should see
[1:24:02] in one another
[1:24:03] amen we've been bought with a price we
[1:24:05] belong to him amen and he's going to see
[1:24:08] us through
[1:24:09] hallelujah
[1:24:11] amen i see a manifestation of the grace
[1:24:14] of god
[1:24:15] when i see
[1:24:16] you hallelujah
[1:24:18] amen
[1:24:20] hallelujah amen now
[1:24:23] brother brown would say in the presence
[1:24:24] of god unrecognized he says oh the
[1:24:26] greatest pleasure i know of
[1:24:28] is to pray until i realize i'm in the
[1:24:30] presence of god
[1:24:32] and recognize it i think that ought to
[1:24:34] thrill a little to be the thrill of the
[1:24:37] church
[1:24:38] is the presence of the holy spirit
[1:24:40] seeing god that made the promise
[1:24:42] standing among us feel his presence and
[1:24:44] see his word and see it vindicated it
[1:24:47] ought to give faith and make cripples
[1:24:48] walk blind say deaf hear dumb speak i
[1:24:51] mean why does camp thrill us because the
[1:24:54] presence of god is there in such an
[1:24:55] incredible fashion i mean why do prayer
[1:24:58] meetings thriller so we come to church
[1:24:59] why does it thrill us because god comes
[1:25:01] down an incredible way
[1:25:03] hallelujah it's the thrill of the church
[1:25:05] it's my thrill
[1:25:07] amen
[1:25:08] amen to be
[1:25:10] in the presence of the one who purchased
[1:25:12] me
[1:25:13] being the prince the one who loves me
[1:25:15] with an unfailing love i mean the one
[1:25:17] who's ransomed me amen he's healed me
[1:25:19] he's redeemed he's leading me all the
[1:25:21] way to be in his presence
[1:25:23] that thrills my heart to be in the to be
[1:25:25] in the presence of the perfect one the
[1:25:27] sinless one the matchless one the great
[1:25:30] mighty conqueror to be in his presence
[1:25:31] is the greatest thing
[1:25:33] hallelujah
[1:25:35] amen
[1:25:37] now
[1:25:39] balaam would prophesy will try and
[1:25:41] prophesy against israel he'd be hired by
[1:25:43] the king of moab this is the numbers i
[1:25:45] think 22 to 25 and there and every time
[1:25:49] he would he would try and prophesy and
[1:25:51] and and get god to curse israel he
[1:25:53] couldn't do it he just blessed them
[1:25:56] and
[1:25:57] when when when balaam would would would
[1:26:00] speak under the inspiration
[1:26:02] when he looked down into israel
[1:26:05] he says in numbers 23 21 he says a few
[1:26:08] things in different places you can go
[1:26:10] away and read it he says numbers 23 21
[1:26:13] he hath not beheld iniquity in jacob now
[1:26:15] this is god looking at his people this
[1:26:17] is god looking at israel now you've got
[1:26:19] to remember in that camp there's
[1:26:21] murmuring there's trouble there's sin
[1:26:24] there's complaining there's people happy
[1:26:27] sad mad and glad there's people annoyed
[1:26:29] at their neighbors they're people having
[1:26:31] bad days having good days you know
[1:26:33] people having bad years good years
[1:26:35] troubled years happy years all that's
[1:26:37] going on
[1:26:38] but when god looks down
[1:26:40] because remember this isn't this isn't
[1:26:42] balaam
[1:26:43] giving his his assessment of israel this
[1:26:46] is god giving his assessment this is
[1:26:49] what i see remember god sees everything
[1:26:52] we can't hide nothing from god we can
[1:26:54] hide things from one another you can't
[1:26:55] hide nothing from god i mean so here is
[1:26:57] balaam was this god speaking through him
[1:27:00] he says he hath not beheld iniquity in
[1:27:02] jacob i mean so when god looked down at
[1:27:04] jacob when god looked down at israel
[1:27:06] says i don't see any iniquity in them i
[1:27:09] mean neither have he seen perverseness
[1:27:11] in israel hallelujah this is god's this
[1:27:14] is god testifying of his people as their
[1:27:17] journey remember this is just under the
[1:27:18] blood of bulls and goats to magnify this
[1:27:20] 10 billion trillion times and this is
[1:27:22] how he sees you and i under the blood of
[1:27:25] jesus christ hallelujah the lord his god
[1:27:28] is with him
[1:27:29] amen that made a big difference between
[1:27:31] israel and the rest of the nations they
[1:27:33] were like anyone else they are human
[1:27:35] beings like anyone else but the big
[1:27:37] demarcation is that god was with them
[1:27:41] amen and that's a big demarcation i'd
[1:27:43] say between the real believer in the not
[1:27:45] believer i'm not putting anyone in any
[1:27:47] boxes that their god is with them
[1:27:49] hallelujah and the shout of a king is
[1:27:53] among them
[1:27:54] hallelujah i mean why was the shadow of
[1:27:57] a king among them because the presence
[1:27:58] of the king was among them i mean the
[1:28:01] word of god was among them amen that's
[1:28:03] why the shard of the king was among them
[1:28:05] hallelujah
[1:28:07] amen because remember god's purpose was
[1:28:10] to was to walk with his people
[1:28:13] that's why he called them out of egypt
[1:28:15] it wasn't just to deliver them from
[1:28:17] slavery i mean but he wanted to walk
[1:28:18] with them i mean he didn't want to be
[1:28:20] separated from there i want to be with
[1:28:22] them holly i want to walk with them i
[1:28:24] want to talk with them i want to have
[1:28:25] fellowship with them that's what he
[1:28:27] wants to do with you he wants to walk
[1:28:29] with you he wants to talk with you it
[1:28:30] was that fellowship with you he wants to
[1:28:32] know you and he wants you to know him oh
[1:28:34] that's what he wants that's why he died
[1:28:36] on calvary i want to walk with you i
[1:28:39] want to share my secrets i want to share
[1:28:40] my heart with you i want to express
[1:28:43] really what i feel about you
[1:28:45] hallelujah that's what he wants to do
[1:28:47] and this is what he's doing
[1:28:50] hallelujah remember it's not just our
[1:28:52] desire
[1:28:54] i want more of him
[1:28:56] it's not just our desire it's not
[1:28:58] one-way traffic
[1:29:00] the reason he puts that in our hearts
[1:29:01] for more of him is because he wants more
[1:29:03] of you
[1:29:04] oh
[1:29:05] it's not just one way you understand
[1:29:07] that we have a long a lot i want more i
[1:29:09] want to see you more i want to see your
[1:29:11] glory experience you more on my heart to
[1:29:13] be softer towards you even the slightest
[1:29:15] little nudge i'll turn
[1:29:17] oh my but the reason he does that is
[1:29:19] because he wants it
[1:29:22] amen and god's not a bully he doesn't
[1:29:25] put anything on anyone
[1:29:27] but he puts a longing
[1:29:29] hallelujah so remember we're not just
[1:29:30] crying out to a void and saying god
[1:29:34] i want more of you and there's no
[1:29:36] response
[1:29:37] there's a big response
[1:29:39] there's a big answer
[1:29:41] hallelujah
[1:29:43] amen
[1:29:44] hallelujah it's in leviticus 26 and 12
[1:29:47] and i will walk among them
[1:29:50] and and will be your god and you shall
[1:29:52] be my people i am the lord your god that
[1:29:54] brought you forth out of the land of
[1:29:56] egypt that you should not be there
[1:29:58] bondmen and i have broken the bands of
[1:30:00] your yoke and made you go upright
[1:30:03] hallelujah that's what he's done for us
[1:30:04] under the bondage of sin he's broken our
[1:30:06] bands and they won't be stooped down in
[1:30:08] sin and perverse us and and and things
[1:30:11] of the world we can walk upright i mean
[1:30:13] we're the sons and daughters of the most
[1:30:14] high god i mean he's ransomed us with
[1:30:17] his blood he's purchased our salvation
[1:30:19] amen but he did that that he'd walk
[1:30:20] among us but now under the blood of
[1:30:22] bulls and goats he could only walk among
[1:30:24] them which is a tremendous thing if you
[1:30:26] think about it but under the blood of
[1:30:28] jesus christ that blood is so powerful
[1:30:30] it cleanses amen the heart of the
[1:30:32] believer the soul of the believer out
[1:30:34] that god himself steps in
[1:30:37] that's no longer just god with us but
[1:30:39] god in us amen as the apostle paul said
[1:30:42] christ in you the hope of glory not just
[1:30:44] christ with you i mean to have god with
[1:30:46] you is an incredible thing don't get me
[1:30:48] wrong i love that but to have christ in
[1:30:50] me
[1:30:51] amen that's what i desire and that's
[1:30:53] what god's desire was the joy set before
[1:30:56] him when he went up calvary that days
[1:30:57] i'm going to walk in them
[1:30:59] oh my want to look at his disciples
[1:31:01] that's incredible to know you this way
[1:31:03] but it's going to be far deeper than
[1:31:04] this amen i'm going to walk in you amen
[1:31:06] it won't be you walking alone you'll
[1:31:08] never walk alone because i will be in
[1:31:10] you i mean i'll be with you even in you
[1:31:13] to the end of the world i mean he says
[1:31:15] in second corinthians 6 and 16 he says
[1:31:18] and i will dwell in them and walk in
[1:31:20] them and i'll be their god and they
[1:31:22] shall be my people
[1:31:24] oh hallelujah
[1:31:26] hallelujah one incredible thing
[1:31:29] this is what we're experiencing
[1:31:32] hallelujah this is not a promise that's
[1:31:34] in the future this is now
[1:31:36] i mean this is being fulfilled now for
[1:31:38] some of us it's been fulfilled for years
[1:31:40] hallelujah
[1:31:42] amen and the lord promised moses there
[1:31:45] he says my presence shall go with thee
[1:31:47] and i'll give thee rest
[1:31:49] hallelujah i'll give thee rest now that
[1:31:52] rest doesn't just speak of you know that
[1:31:54] rest there in the old testament actually
[1:31:56] spoke of being being taken into the
[1:31:58] promised land and we'll get into that
[1:32:00] soon but
[1:32:01] uh god would tell uh tell moses tell the
[1:32:04] israelites in exodus 23 and 20 behold
[1:32:07] i've i sent an angel before thee to keep
[1:32:10] thee in the way and to bring me into the
[1:32:13] place which i have prepared
[1:32:16] i go to prepare a place for you
[1:32:18] amen that where i am you shall be also i
[1:32:20] will come again and if i do go prepare a
[1:32:23] place for you i will come again and
[1:32:24] receive you unto myself that where i am
[1:32:26] you shall be also i mean so now when you
[1:32:29] parallel this into the new testament
[1:32:30] it's not just us leaving stokes valley
[1:32:33] and going to some other part of the
[1:32:34] earth that's not what it's talking about
[1:32:35] it's not leaving egypt physically and
[1:32:37] going to the promised land physically
[1:32:39] anymore but it's actually god is leading
[1:32:42] us here into glory
[1:32:45] amen amen so he says i'll send an angel
[1:32:48] before thee to keep thee in the way to
[1:32:50] bring
[1:32:51] to bring thee into the place where i
[1:32:53] have prepared he says beware of him obey
[1:32:56] his voice provoke him not we know
[1:32:59] the voice is the word of god right
[1:33:01] provoke him not for he will not pardon
[1:33:03] your transgressions for my name is in
[1:33:05] him but if thou will indeed obey his
[1:33:08] voice and do all that i speak then i'll
[1:33:10] be an enemy unto thine enemies in an
[1:33:12] adversary unto thine adversaries amen so
[1:33:15] now this angel
[1:33:17] here is god in angelic form because his
[1:33:20] name is in him
[1:33:21] he says he will go before thee to bring
[1:33:24] me into the place which i have prepared
[1:33:26] right
[1:33:27] and he will and to keep thee in the way
[1:33:30] that's why it's so important to live in
[1:33:32] the presence of god
[1:33:33] because if you begin to step off the
[1:33:35] path the lord i trust on the inside will
[1:33:37] say oh no hold on
[1:33:39] this doesn't yeah it should be alarm
[1:33:40] bells going off
[1:33:42] don't look at that thing don't read that
[1:33:44] thing don't listen to that thing get off
[1:33:45] that website get off that video
[1:33:48] right don't look at that
[1:33:51] it should be lord i'm sorry you know
[1:33:52] because his presence remember he
[1:33:54] just like just like brother ed showed if
[1:33:56] you haven't listened to wednesday go
[1:33:58] listen to it
[1:33:59] but you know brother um ed put that
[1:34:01] video brother only describing when the
[1:34:03] holy ghost comes in
[1:34:05] and he takes over then your second
[1:34:07] nature goes instead of being in charge
[1:34:09] of you is just to a place of influence
[1:34:12] amen
[1:34:13] to me to me it's such a big difference
[1:34:15] between your nature leading you and god
[1:34:17] actually being your nature leading you
[1:34:19] then now that nature is just first
[1:34:21] nature is just an influence as opposed
[1:34:22] to ruling your life
[1:34:24] amen but itself god is on the control
[1:34:26] tower of your life
[1:34:28] amen what's that to do to keep the in
[1:34:30] the way
[1:34:31] to keep you in his word
[1:34:34] hallelujah
[1:34:36] amen
[1:34:37] to a place which i have prepared
[1:34:39] amen we're going up into glory
[1:34:42] hallelujah now the apostle paul and now
[1:34:44] just to save time we won't read it but
[1:34:46] you go away and you read hebrews three
[1:34:48] and four
[1:34:49] the apostle paul parallels israel coming
[1:34:52] out of egypt going into the promised
[1:34:53] land and he
[1:34:55] and and and he speaks about they would
[1:34:57] not enter god would
[1:34:59] would say to israel that first
[1:35:01] generation they won't enter into his
[1:35:03] rest because of unbelief now that rest
[1:35:06] we know is going into the promised land
[1:35:07] but then the apostle paul would say but
[1:35:09] there is a rest for the people of god it
[1:35:12] says let us labor therefore to enter
[1:35:13] into that rest now we know that that
[1:35:16] rest is not keeping a day
[1:35:18] right because in colossians it would say
[1:35:21] let no man therefore judge you and meet
[1:35:22] you and drink a respect of a holiday or
[1:35:24] of the new moons of the sabbath days
[1:35:26] which are a shadow of things to come but
[1:35:28] the body is of christ so he's saying
[1:35:30] that the keeping the sabbath is just a
[1:35:32] shadow pointing to a reel
[1:35:35] right and then jesus would stand it i
[1:35:37] think it's in matthew 11. come unto me
[1:35:38] all you that heavy labor and a lady i'll
[1:35:41] give thee rest
[1:35:42] right they were sabbath keepers but they
[1:35:44] didn't have rest so the true rest is
[1:35:47] actually when you enter into when you
[1:35:49] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:35:51] that's an eternal rest
[1:35:53] right where you cease from your own
[1:35:54] works is no longer you trying to be a
[1:35:57] christian it's him being the christian
[1:35:58] in you
[1:35:59] it's him fulfilling his word it's him
[1:36:02] producing his character in you
[1:36:04] amen
[1:36:05] so now when he says my presence will go
[1:36:07] with thee and i will give the rest what
[1:36:10] so to me now it's bringing us into the
[1:36:13] baptism of the holy ghost sure but it's
[1:36:15] actually taking us remember their final
[1:36:17] destination was the promised land our
[1:36:19] final destination is glory
[1:36:22] right that is that is
[1:36:24] if i can call it this way that is the
[1:36:26] rest if we parallel it into today that
[1:36:28] is the rest where he will bring us into
[1:36:31] right sure he'll bring us into an
[1:36:32] eternal rest we'll receive the holy
[1:36:34] ghost but the final end of our journey
[1:36:36] is the change of the body being taken up
[1:36:38] into glory so my presence will go with
[1:36:40] thee
[1:36:41] and i will give thee the rapture
[1:36:45] amen
[1:36:47] hallelujah because we are living in the
[1:36:49] time
[1:36:50] of the third exodus the first exodus was
[1:36:53] then going
[1:36:55] going from egypt into the promised land
[1:36:57] the second exodus was when jesus was
[1:36:58] here going from being dead and
[1:37:00] trespassed sins into the living god
[1:37:02] receiving the holy ghost and now the
[1:37:03] third exodus is being filled with the
[1:37:05] holy ghost and take it up into a rapture
[1:37:08] amen
[1:37:09] hallelujah
[1:37:11] praise the lord now i love it where the
[1:37:13] lord says unto moses i will do this
[1:37:16] thing also that thou hast spoken for
[1:37:18] thou
[1:37:19] hast found grace in my sight
[1:37:21] and i know thee by name
[1:37:24] now when you think of this i know there
[1:37:25] by name amen it brought me automatically
[1:37:28] into john 10 where jesus says i am the
[1:37:32] i'm the shepherd
[1:37:34] hallelujah now
[1:37:35] he would he would jesus would lay out
[1:37:37] this parable here
[1:37:39] and oh we can go to john 10 we're not
[1:37:40] going to read the whole chapter but
[1:37:41] maybe just just just put it up here
[1:37:45] but i trust that by the end of the
[1:37:46] service you just rejoice saying god's
[1:37:48] with me
[1:37:49] he's not just with me he's in me and
[1:37:51] he's not just in me just to be in me
[1:37:53] he's leading me amen and he's keeping me
[1:37:55] and he's protecting me and he's guiding
[1:37:57] me he's showing me the way and
[1:37:58] hallelujah so
[1:38:00] so here it is here i mean and we've got
[1:38:03] john 1 and sorry john 10 and verse 1.
[1:38:06] verily verily i send you he that
[1:38:07] entereth not by the door into the
[1:38:09] sheepfold but climbeth up some other way
[1:38:11] the same as a thief and a robber but he
[1:38:13] that entereth in by the door is the
[1:38:15] shepherd of the sheep to him that the
[1:38:17] porter openeth and the sheep hear his
[1:38:19] voice and he calleth his own sheep by
[1:38:22] name and leadeth them out see he said to
[1:38:24] moses i know thee by name and jesus
[1:38:27] knows his sheep by name he knows us by
[1:38:29] name i mean we're not just a a
[1:38:32] a number

[1:39:03] went there and they saw him go past they
[1:39:04] waved their flags and they went back to
[1:39:06] school but then they did a roll call
[1:39:08] and there was one girl who wasn't there
[1:39:11] and you're so so so they're panicking
[1:39:13] wondering what happened to her and they
[1:39:14] begin to go back to the
[1:39:16] you know
[1:39:18] part of the street where they're lined
[1:39:19] up and they found her down in alleyway
[1:39:21] hidden away just crying in the corner

[1:40:20] hallelujah why because this is an
[1:40:22] individual walk
[1:40:23] it's not just a show we're a body but
[1:40:25] it's individual
[1:40:27] amen and we're all important to god
[1:40:29] we're not just a a a a nameless face in
[1:40:32] the crowd never ever get that in never
[1:40:35] ever allow the devil to tell you that
[1:40:37] that you're not important that no one
[1:40:38] cares that god doesn't care that you
[1:40:40] don't know god cares
[1:40:42] he cared so much for you went to calvary
[1:40:44] for you amen he cares a lot he cares so
[1:40:46] much for you that you'll take a rapture
[1:40:48] amen he sent malachi 4 in this age to
[1:40:50] turn your heart back to the faith of the
[1:40:52] fathers amen to walk with him god cares
[1:40:56] jesus cares
[1:40:57] amen
[1:40:59] and when he put it forth
[1:41:01] and when he put forth his own sheep he
[1:41:03] goes before them and the sheep follow
[1:41:06] him for they know his voice and a
[1:41:08] stranger will they not follow but will
[1:41:10] flee from him for they know not the
[1:41:12] voice of strangers now we won't read it
[1:41:15] but the same time the lord jesus makes a
[1:41:18] differentiation between a shepherd and a
[1:41:20] heiling
[1:41:21] amen a heiling runs when there's trouble
[1:41:24] but a shepherd lays his life down for
[1:41:26] the sheep he stands in the way amen he
[1:41:28] protects them i mean he takes care of
[1:41:31] any danger but a heiling runs
[1:41:33] the first side of trouble he's gone
[1:41:35] he says my peg this is well above my pay
[1:41:38] grade i'm out of here
[1:41:39] right because he's a hireling he's not
[1:41:41] the shepherd right but a true shepherd
[1:41:44] lays his life down for the sheep and he
[1:41:46] says i am the good shepherd
[1:41:49] amen and i know my sheep and are none of
[1:41:51] mine so what he's saying is that when
[1:41:53] danger because i'm the good shepherd
[1:41:55] when danger comes i'm not running
[1:41:57] and it doesn't matter if all of hell
[1:42:00] comes against you god doesn't say oh
[1:42:02] this is too hot and heavy tell me how it
[1:42:03] goes and he runs no no he stands he
[1:42:06] actually blocks between you and the
[1:42:07] devil amen he is not there to run he's
[1:42:10] not a heiling he's telling you i'm not
[1:42:12] going to leave you no matter how bad how
[1:42:14] how terrible a situation may be i'm not
[1:42:17] gonna leave you but i'll be with you in
[1:42:19] the trouble i'll be with you in the
[1:42:21] storm i will guide you through the storm
[1:42:23] hallelujah because he says that he leads
[1:42:26] his sheep
[1:42:28] hallelujah
[1:42:30] amen remember because the shepherd in
[1:42:32] the bible we've just read it but i just
[1:42:33] want to show you a shepherd in the bible
[1:42:35] is not like a modern day shepherd
[1:42:37] a monday shepherd you get all the
[1:42:39] sheepdogs
[1:42:41] right i've done it i was yeah big did it
[1:42:43] with my uncle and my friends and stuff
[1:42:44] you get all the sheep dogs get on the
[1:42:46] quad you go to where the sheep are you
[1:42:48] you know set the dogs free they begin to
[1:42:51] whistle into all kinds of things and
[1:42:52] they drive the sheep
[1:42:54] to where they want them to go so the
[1:42:56] shepherd is actually behind the sheep
[1:42:58] but in the bible he says the shepherd
[1:43:00] leads his sheep the shepherd always goes
[1:43:03] on before
[1:43:04] amen he always goes on before and that's
[1:43:07] why now
[1:43:08] david could say in psalms 23
[1:43:11] the lord is my shepherd
[1:43:13] i shall not want
[1:43:15] he maketh me to lie down in green
[1:43:17] pastures
[1:43:18] he leadeth me beside the still waters
[1:43:20] right he restoreth my soul he leadeth me
[1:43:23] in paths of righteousness for his name's
[1:43:26] sake
[1:43:27] for his namesake he has you in his hand
[1:43:30] hallelujah because he can't be defeated
[1:43:33] amen god's not going to lose one of his
[1:43:35] children i mean his purpose cannot be
[1:43:37] defeated i mean i believe i'm part of
[1:43:40] him
[1:43:42] amen if i'm part of him i'm not going to
[1:43:44] be lost
[1:43:45] hallelujah i'm going to be in heaven
[1:43:47] hallelujah but you see but but moses
[1:43:50] moses said i want to know i found grace
[1:43:53] in my sight
[1:43:54] you know and god says i'll prove it
[1:43:56] because my presence will be with you
[1:43:58] amen so he lead so so david david had a
[1:44:01] shepherd
[1:44:02] and and and the lord led him this way
[1:44:06] and he says yea thou walk through the
[1:44:07] valley of the shadow of death
[1:44:09] i'll fear no evil
[1:44:12] now a harling would have quit
[1:44:15] are you going through the valley shall
[1:44:16] death oh no no they said no i'll fear no
[1:44:19] evil for thou art with me
[1:44:22] amen thy rod and they staff they comfort
[1:44:24] me
[1:44:25] so we've got to realize the shepherd is
[1:44:27] with us
[1:44:28] the shepherd now
[1:44:30] please take it please take this
[1:44:31] incredibly personal
[1:44:33] right don't just take it as the church
[1:44:36] no the church is made up of individuals
[1:44:38] who know the lord and the lord knows
[1:44:40] them and the lord walks in them amen and
[1:44:42] manifests his word through their life
[1:44:44] right so take this very personal
[1:44:46] amen the lord he says i will fear no
[1:44:50] evil because thou art with me
[1:44:52] hallelujah so now just as he says the
[1:44:56] lord leads me
[1:44:57] amen he leadeth me beside the still
[1:44:59] waters
[1:45:00] he leads me in the past of righteousness
[1:45:03] don't you think that when we go through
[1:45:05] the valley of the shadow of death don't
[1:45:06] you think actually the lord is leading
[1:45:07] us there
[1:45:09] right don't you think that he he doesn't
[1:45:12] just lead us part of the time he's a 24
[1:45:14] 7 leader i mean when we're asleep he's
[1:45:17] leading us when we're awake he's leading
[1:45:19] us when we don't know which way up and
[1:45:20] down we need that third coffee he's
[1:45:22] leading us
[1:45:23] right he's in control when you don't
[1:45:25] know which way to go he's still leading
[1:45:27] so but the thing is god leads us into
[1:45:30] something
[1:45:31] it's never a death trap
[1:45:34] it's never a death trap he leads us into
[1:45:37] it seems to the very jaws of danger
[1:45:39] actually to remove our enemy
[1:45:42] amen he led he led israel down by the
[1:45:44] red sea israel saw a death trap actually
[1:45:48] you know the lord just had a a pharaoh
[1:45:51] trap right there or an egyptian trap
[1:45:52] that wasn't a death trap for israel that
[1:45:55] was a death trap for israel's enemy
[1:45:57] hallelujah why so so they were literally
[1:45:59] walking down the valley of shadow of
[1:46:01] death because if god didn't stand behind
[1:46:03] them the you know the egyptian army
[1:46:05] would have come and massacred them and
[1:46:07] taken this some slaves back to egypt but
[1:46:09] it was a it was a death trap
[1:46:12] for
[1:46:13] egypt not for israel
[1:46:15] it was actually god allowed that to
[1:46:17] happen and if you go read the account
[1:46:19] moses
[1:46:20] is told by god go here go here go there
[1:46:22] you'll end up here so they weren't just
[1:46:24] doing a mad dash somewhere and they
[1:46:26] ended up there and all how did we get
[1:46:28] here no god led them that way because he
[1:46:30] leads
[1:46:31] right he doesn't just send he leads
[1:46:33] he sure he may commission us and send us
[1:46:36] into the world but when we go he leads
[1:46:37] us
[1:46:38] hallelujah he doesn't just give us
[1:46:39] orders and then and then now i want my
[1:46:41] six monthly report how's it going no
[1:46:43] he's leading us every day
[1:46:46] hallelujah so so he led he led them
[1:46:48] there
[1:46:49] amen not just to leave them there but to
[1:46:51] take them through
[1:46:53] that the egyptians would be drowned
[1:46:55] right
[1:46:56] daniel daniel was led by the lord daniel
[1:46:58] had a shepherd
[1:47:00] hallelujah and and and the great
[1:47:02] shepherd actually led daniel into a
[1:47:04] lion's den
[1:47:06] that wasn't to destroy daniel
[1:47:09] the lion's den was to destroy daniel's
[1:47:11] enemies
[1:47:13] other because remember after daniel got
[1:47:15] hauled out of the den then the king said
[1:47:17] now all you people and all your family
[1:47:19] and all that you are throw them in amen
[1:47:22] so so the voices of daniel's accusers
[1:47:25] were silenced amen in the same den that
[1:47:29] the lord led him into
[1:47:31] hallelujah you say well the devil's on
[1:47:32] my case don't you worry god's leading
[1:47:35] you into a devil death trap
[1:47:37] amen there may be some great pressure in
[1:47:39] your life don't worry stay close to the
[1:47:41] shepherd amen he will take you through
[1:47:43] for a death trap for the devil
[1:47:45] hallelujah so everything's working for
[1:47:47] your good
[1:47:48] it's not working for the devils good and
[1:47:50] i'm happy about that
[1:47:52] hallelujah so now we can we can rest in
[1:47:54] the fact that it doesn't matter if we're
[1:47:57] we're we're laying down in green
[1:47:58] pastures or besides still waters or in
[1:48:01] paths of righteousness oh we're going
[1:48:03] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:48:04] death
[1:48:05] amen he's with us
[1:48:07] and we shall fear no evil so don't fear
[1:48:10] nothing in this world
[1:48:11] amen
[1:48:13] hallelujah
[1:48:15] amen if god before us who can be against
[1:48:18] us
[1:48:19] amen so our lord jesus is our real
[1:48:21] shepherd and he's proved it over and
[1:48:23] over again and he doesn't run from
[1:48:25] trouble and abandons us but he leads us
[1:48:27] through every situation
[1:48:29] hallelujah amen of god so what can we
[1:48:32] say to these things so now if the lord
[1:48:34] is leading us through every situation
[1:48:36] then what do we have to complain about
[1:48:40] what have we to fear just stick close to
[1:48:42] the shepherd and when trouble comes
[1:48:45] i mean stick close the shepherd when
[1:48:46] trouble comes remember here's the word
[1:48:49] right so how do you stick close to the
[1:48:50] shepherd when trouble comes well read
[1:48:52] the word ponder the word talk about it
[1:48:55] testify about it sing about it listen to
[1:48:57] it believe it and confess it
[1:48:59] right
[1:49:00] let let the meditations of your heart be
[1:49:02] upon him in the time of trouble
[1:49:05] amen because what does that do that
[1:49:06] builds faith
[1:49:08] because faith cometh by hearing and
[1:49:09] hearing by the word of god remember
[1:49:11] worry and fear just rip strips your
[1:49:14] faith
[1:49:15] right but the word
[1:49:17] lifts your faith
[1:49:19] hallelujah
[1:49:21] that's why that's how you stick close to
[1:49:22] the shepherd amen
[1:49:24] hallelujah
[1:49:26] no
[1:49:27] brother brown would tell a story
[1:49:29] uh uh give an account
[1:49:32] where where where um
[1:49:34] he actually woke up one morning the
[1:49:36] devil was standing in the corner
[1:49:38] and he looked like some cartoon
[1:49:39] character i can't remember who it was
[1:49:40] but um off top of my head but this devil
[1:49:43] is saying to him you have no power with
[1:49:45] god and you've got nothing and and then
[1:49:47] and then brother brown just said to him
[1:49:49] satan you're an offense to me
[1:49:51] get out of my way in the name of the
[1:49:52] lord jesus christ and the devil left
[1:49:55] because we have authority over the devil
[1:49:57] and he said i lay there a little bit and
[1:49:58] the bed started to raise up and i felt a
[1:50:00] real sweet feeling come over me i
[1:50:02] thought i wonder if the holy spirit now
[1:50:04] is close and over in the corner so help
[1:50:06] me here's my bible over my heart the
[1:50:08] sweetest voice i ever heard in my life
[1:50:10] said don't fear
[1:50:12] to go anywhere and don't fear to do
[1:50:14] anything for the never failing presence
[1:50:17] of jesus christ is with you wherever you
[1:50:19] go
[1:50:20] he says that settle it with me let them
[1:50:22] rage i've got an absolute my anchor
[1:50:24] holds yonder because it's the word of
[1:50:26] the living god amen
[1:50:29] i'll never leave thee nor forsake thee
[1:50:32] amen so now just real quickly i'm just
[1:50:34] going to wrap up with this now if his
[1:50:36] presence is with us
[1:50:39] and it's going to lead us all the way
[1:50:40] into the rapture
[1:50:42] then what orders presence ought to do
[1:50:44] now we've covered one it should make us
[1:50:46] sweet and gentle and loving and kind all
[1:50:49] the future the spirit should be growing
[1:50:51] right we're in his presence right but
[1:50:53] now brother brown preached a sermon
[1:50:55] called the presence of god unrecognized
[1:50:58] but what about when the prince of god is
[1:50:59] recognized let's just take the vice
[1:51:01] versa amen now let's let's look into
[1:51:04] this now it's interesting that many
[1:51:06] people have different terminologies
[1:51:09] right the world is full of and then many
[1:51:11] disagreements are based on because my
[1:51:13] glossary index is different to yours
[1:51:16] right so when you say born again or
[1:51:18] baptism your definition will be
[1:51:20] different to mine
[1:51:22] but we can be talking about the same
[1:51:23] thing now so we want to talk about the
[1:51:26] bible terminology of it
[1:51:28] brother brown even said and why it had
[1:51:29] to be shared but he said now i know the
[1:51:31] terminologies of what born again is but
[1:51:34] let's just watch what happened in the
[1:51:35] bible when they were born again
[1:51:37] and then he goes to peter he was a
[1:51:39] believer the apostles were believers but
[1:51:41] they weren't born again till after the
[1:51:43] holy ghost fell on them at pentecost
[1:51:45] right that gave them the new birth
[1:51:46] that's the bible terminology of it okay
[1:51:49] so we should look into the scripture and
[1:51:50] say what happens when the presence of
[1:51:52] god is recognized
[1:51:55] hallelujah
[1:51:56] now okay so what happens when the prince
[1:51:58] of god is recognized i'm just taking
[1:52:00] these from the new testament but the god
[1:52:01] of the oldest is the same god of the new
[1:52:04] right so
[1:52:06] when his presence is recognized
[1:52:08] he gives revelation
[1:52:10] amen peter recognized it was the
[1:52:12] presence of god he says thou art the
[1:52:13] christ the son of the living god i mean
[1:52:15] upon this rock i'll build my church amen
[1:52:18] that revelation gave a real anchor to
[1:52:20] whom shall we go thou alone have the
[1:52:22] words of eternal life if i all these
[1:52:24] other religious movements have their
[1:52:25] word their opinion but you have the word
[1:52:27] of eternal life so when his presence was
[1:52:29] recognized more than a prophet but god
[1:52:32] and man
[1:52:33] right he was the god prophet i mean when
[1:52:36] his presence was recognized it gave
[1:52:37] revelation and that revelation got a
[1:52:40] real anchor in his heart paul on the
[1:52:42] road to damascus stepped into his
[1:52:44] presence
[1:52:45] hallelujah
[1:52:47] and he you know that light shone about
[1:52:48] him and and paul would say who art thou
[1:52:51] lord and the lord said i'm jesus whom
[1:52:53] they persecuted what a moment that must
[1:52:55] have beat and it would never have
[1:52:57] escaped him hallelujah so what it gave
[1:52:59] revelation that the one he was fighting
[1:53:01] against was the very one that is
[1:53:03] claiming to serve
[1:53:04] amen
[1:53:05] amen he gives deliverance he gives
[1:53:08] deliverance when his presence is
[1:53:10] recognized amen the syrophoenician woman
[1:53:12] recognized it oh thou son of david o
[1:53:14] lord have mercy upon me
[1:53:16] amen and and and her faith went past all
[1:53:19] the discoursement everything amen and
[1:53:22] her faith because she recognized the
[1:53:24] presence of god
[1:53:25] amen caused her daughter that was
[1:53:27] demon-possessed to be delivered
[1:53:29] hallelujah amen when his presence is
[1:53:32] recognized he gives healing
[1:53:34] amen the woman with the blood issue if i
[1:53:36] ever just touch the hem of his garment
[1:53:37] i'll be made whole
[1:53:38] hallelujah the crippled man loaded into
[1:53:40] his presence aiming by his friends they
[1:53:42] took the roof off the place and loaded
[1:53:44] him in they lowered him into his
[1:53:46] presence
[1:53:47] hallelujah and his sins were forgiven
[1:53:50] and he took up his bed and he walked
[1:53:52] hallelujah he raised the dead
[1:53:54] amen he called lazarus from the grave
[1:53:57] hallelujah this is just a few you can
[1:53:59] just go through the scripture amen he
[1:54:02] fills with the holy ghost
[1:54:04] that with one heart one mind one to call
[1:54:05] in the day of pentecost and then the
[1:54:07] prince of god came into the room and
[1:54:09] they realized we've been in this
[1:54:11] presence before
[1:54:12] hallelujah and they are filled with the
[1:54:14] holy ghost amen transform their lives
[1:54:16] why because his presence was
[1:54:18] recognized
[1:54:20] amen in his presence honest hearts
[1:54:24] realize their condition
[1:54:26] amen simon peter was fishing and jesus
[1:54:29] was there
[1:54:30] and then jesus called you know have you
[1:54:32] not have you caught anything caught
[1:54:34] nothing three units on the other side
[1:54:36] now forgive me if i've got these stories
[1:54:38] mixed up because i've just got this
[1:54:40] scripture here and when simon peter saw
[1:54:42] it
[1:54:43] he fell down at jesus knee saying depart
[1:54:46] from me for i am a sinful man o lord
[1:54:50] for the for he was astonished and
[1:54:52] and all that were with them at the draw
[1:54:55] draft of the fishes which they had taken
[1:54:58] so peter recognized this is a different
[1:55:00] kind of a man
[1:55:02] amen and it made him realize his his
[1:55:04] condition
[1:55:05] that he wasn't worthy to be in his
[1:55:07] presence and he was a sinful man
[1:55:09] but god called him
[1:55:10] god didn't want him to depart he wanted
[1:55:12] him to stay
[1:55:14] amen
[1:55:16] hallelujah
[1:55:17] first uh chronicles 16 27 glory and
[1:55:20] honor are in his presence right this is
[1:55:22] from the old testament strength and
[1:55:23] gladness are in his place and psalm 6 11
[1:55:26] thou will show me the path of life and
[1:55:28] my presence is fullness of joy at the
[1:55:30] right hand there are pleasures
[1:55:32] forevermore and he's the same yesterday
[1:55:35] today and forever if we can just
[1:55:37] recognize the presence of god we can get
[1:55:40] what we have needle
