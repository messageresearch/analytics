this morning to your hands in jesus' name amen amen praise the Lord just well you're standing um if you could turn with me to uh Genesis 1 27- 28 I here yeah thank you musicians okay Genesis 1: 27-28 says so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth praise the Lord you can have your seats this morning now the um the thought that's been dwelling on my heart for a little while is this concept of blessing and cursing and it's a concept I suppose that affects all of us um depending on how we choose to how how our life evolves and what essentially what we do but it it started off in my mind as quite a complicated subject because I hadn't really looked into it before and maybe even quite a scary subject you know but in in looking into it for a while I've kind of realized it's not really that scary you know it's not a it's not a very complicated thing it's actually I was surprised at the Simplicity of it all you know and and you know how that how that we can just live a blessed life and everything's going to be right you know we don't Satan can sometimes mess with affect our mind somehow to to to think there's some sort of cursing happening and all the we can just play around in areas that we maybe don't know but I just want to speak on this this morning so if you'll indulge I'd like to go through this and just take you through this these Concepts this morning and may the Lord help me it's it's it's it's quite a big subject but I've managed to I think compress it into a small amount of time okay because with this one you kind of have to get the entirety of it to for it to make sense even though it probably deserves a lot more time if you can sort of stand back and just get the entirety of this concept then it will make then it will I believe you'll be blessed this morning okay okay so you ready okay okay and as I always say you look you're very intelligent people I think if we did the IQ test we we we know we've got a high high IQ so I can go pretty fast okay okay I know I drag it down but okay blessings and cursing now Essen if we think of the word b the the concept of blessing it if you if you boil it down it means taking someone something to a better State than they are currently in because you know we say blessing is something we say with our mouth but then that thing we say has to eventually come into action it has to come into being right a blessing and a cursing essentially is taking someone to a worse State than they're currently in so it's this concept of something either gets better or it gets worse it's blessed or it's cursed that's this when we talk about this that's the result of that's the result of what we want to talk about now when we look at God the nature of God if we say by default like his natural thing that he would come out and do is to bless okay because he's a Creator by default he takes something that is not very much and makes it better that's his nature that he's he's a he he by Nature likes to bless he doesn't always bless but naturally that's what if you leave him to do what he does naturally he'll bless because that's what that's the nature of God right because he takes something to a better State and we can see that by the World there was this rock the the it says the Earth was without form and void but he didn't just leave it like that he decided I want to bless that I want to make it better than what it currently is okay so then then he the first thing he created was light he said let there be light there was light he begins to create this world the something makes something better so the first day it was better and then the second day he created the sky and the firmaments and it looked a bit better than more it was the day before cuz he's beginning to bless that's the way that God does it then the third day the dry land the Seas and the plant created and this this rock started to have life on it started to have Greenery it started to get better and better okay and then then on the fourth day created the Sun the moon and the stars the heavens and it just looked fantastic after that you can imagine there black space and suddenly there's all these lights in the sky and these planets swirling around like this big mobile all happening you know and God's God's blessing he's naturally doing what he does naturally as bless and then on the fifth day it says you created all the creatures that live in the sea and the creatures that were flying and then when he created those creatures God it says God bless them he said multiply cuz that's the way that God is he likes to bless and then on the sixth day it says he made all the the animals that the animals that walk around and that then he then he made this amazing creature called man and he and he he he made male and female then it says and God blessed them and God said to them be fruitful and multiply and and replenish the Earth and sub Jordan have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the earth and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth so the first words that God spoke to man we he blessed them cuz he because that's the god that we serve as a God that wants to bless okay that's you got to understand his nature so that's very important for the what we're talking about and you could say that the whole of creation was blessed by God you know when when you look around you look at this thing that we've got and you and it's not no it's no longer just a rock it's no longer just this this thing that doesn't have any substance or value or beauty but now it's been blessed to it's this beautiful thing this creation and I think every man or woman if they just look at creation have to appreciate its beauty you know we can evolve a lot but we never get any bigger as people I thought that the other day we never really get bigger so every time we look at a mountain it's always big it doesn't matter how far technology comes along we don't become bigger people a Mountain's always big we lived 5,000 years ago and now a mountain is big and it's glorious you know we we we can we we take it and we think that's that's glorious There's Something About That Mountain or there's something about that ocean when we see the vastness of what God's made or the the heavens you know now I want to talk now about then we live there was a world that was blessed but there was the The First Curse that came upon the Earth and in order to start to talk about that we have to talk we have to understand the nature of Satan is then to curse he's not a Creator he doesn't have the ability to create something better he's his only what he's got is to curse he brings things down that's his whole nature is to tear down not build up that's why we Believers we want to build people up not tear them down cuz we know the nature of where those two come from right and and but you see in order to in order to get someone to a worse State than what they were before and someone willingly to go along with it they most of the time they've got to be tricked into it unless they're mentally insane like if if you had something and then I said look how about you end up with nothing most of you would say look now probably for first something you know but if I tricked you I said no you're going to get something far better than what you've got now and then the end result you got nothing you're like oh he tricked me now I got nothing you know you in order to come out to a worse State we Satan he uses trickery to get us to a worse state to to get us to a more cursed State than what we were at the start you know he tricks us he doesn't that's that's the way that he works and his first major act on Earth was to trick man to thinking you'll become better right that's but he but his whole intention was to curse them but he but he tried to offer them so that's why God said to them you God said to Adam and Eve you can eat of every tree but you can't be with each other sexually that's what you're not supposed to do okay just so we know that's what he said don't do that but Satan came along and he said because God said the day you do that that day you'll die and Satan come along and says no you won't die uh uh you'll be like Gods you'll be better you know he's starting to trick them you'll be intelligent so so they Eve went along with it because she thought I'm going to get something better out of this but she was he was tricking her to curse her to end up worse right she if he said look I'm going to go along with this then you're going to be cursed after that the whole world you know is going to change is going to be miserable are you king she would have said no way see that's that's the way Satan does it and essentially you ended up with this scenario where it says God says if you do that act you'll die that so if you stay inside the word you'll be blessed everything will go well for you right you'll be blessed it was honest but Satan says now you won't die you'll be like Gods you'll be intelligent but he he's taken them outside the word of God and they're going to be cursed and that's essentially the whole Crux of the whole sermon when you boil everything down this is how this whole thing works if we stand inside the word word of God we get blessed if we go outside the word of God we get cursed it's really that simple all the other stuff doesn't matter that's the way that it works regardless of how it might appear that is the way that this whole thing works every single time NE never changes okay so Adam and Eve Eve went and did that she did the act with the serpent which was actually a a a a human being walking around okay so then when you understand that okay so when she did when they she did the ACT then she did it with with Adam now now God had to then Implement there were curses that came upon the Earth after that right now the first curse he cursed the serpent so the serpent was walking around he said right because you did this you let Satan come in and do this you're going to be cursed down to this creature like that so so that serpent went from a a essentially a glorious being down to this thing that crawled upon the dirt that's why I couldn't find any pictures of what this of because most of the pictures you see are this but this is post curse picture and yet it's a precur situation with Eve talking to a snake right cuz it's like H the curse was that it would become a snake it was different before the curse okay it was a being that could communicate okay so that so now that here's the first curse that happened now uh little question for Bible scholars will either of these be in the new heavens and new earth Reon there be snakes there ugly creatures I don't know I don't know all all or the the the serpent because it was a creation of God I don't know don't know the answer I just sort i' throw that out there if you if you if the brothers want to have a debate one [Laughter] night okay now that now then God then turned his attention to the woman and said because you've done this in pain and travail you'll bring forth children you're going to be you've got you're pregnant now your experience is going to be painful I don't think she experienced pain before that situation right no pain but you says right you're going to have pain and not just that but your hormones are going to be all messed up when you do and you're going to have this you'll have it it'll just be an awful experience to have children and now who now the outcome is nice but probably the experience from what I've experienced isn't very really enjoyable experience okay I haven't had one but I've been pretty close to it and then the other the other curse was your Des I will beat your husband he will rule over you so she was cursed to that state as well that you're no longer going to be what you were before you're coming down a we but your your desire is going to change you're not going to be this your the way you think it's going to be different and and whether people like to accept it or not you get a girls and guys together the guys seem to just be more dominant the girls just seem to take a back seat now they may try and take the front seat but they naturally won't it's just the way that it works try and change it you won't because it's part of the curse the m M alties changed okay accept it or not and that's why Paul says but I suffer not a woman to teach nor upserve authority over a man because he's saying The Curse still remains in place it doesn't hasn't disappeared because time's evolved the curse Still Remains so he says because for Adam was first form in Eve and Adam was not deceived the woman was deceived being deceived was in the transgression okay then he took his eyes over to the man and he said okay now because you've done this curse is the ground for your sake and uh essentially said life for you is going to be hard every time you you that for you to exist as a being now is going to be hard now we say well I don't work on a farm anymore you know because he said you'll have thorns and thistles it'll bring forth but the curse Still Remains even if you work in an office there's a curse against man to make your existence and your the ability to stay alive here hard No Matter What scenario you're working this is a probably a better picture of it here this is now the life man was cursed to live like as you try and push forward you're going to have something pulling you back all the time until the day you die you you're cursed so that's what we live under and you got to try and provide and do these things and it just it just doesn't go your way that's part of the curse right yeah and all creation was cursed at the same time because they they that their world changed and then you had the the Bible says against this will this is a different interpretation but it's just to explain it in a in a in a way bit more against this will all creation was subjected to God's curse but with eager hope that creation looks forward to the day when it will join God's children in glorious freedom from from death and Decay for we know that all creation has been groaning as in the Pains of child birth right up to this present time so creation knows it's under this curse and and this sort of scenario where you've got these animals killing each other is not the way that it was supposed to be this is not normal the these animal these Lions don't like killing those other creatures they do it because they're under the curse but I guarantee in them they don't like it they know that they're not supposed to be like that that all this killing and all this sort of stuff and all these these fields that look like this is not the way that creation was supposed to be it was supposed to be here's a picture that was what it was supposed to be the lion lays down with the lamb they don't just kill each other they love each other the lion eats the grass they just there a it wasn't this whole killing Thorns thistles mess that we've got now that's not creation Now we go shoot animals and do all those things that's all good we're under this curse right but I guarantee there's no going to be no hunters in heaven sorry Bruce but you won't go shoot the animals you know because because it says and we Believers also grown even though we have the Holy Spirit within us as a forest of future Glory we long for our bodies to be released from sin and suffering and from this curse that we live under we too wait with eager hope for the day when God will give us full rights as has adopted children including the new bodies he has promised us this place where the curse will not exist anymore on us on the creatures on anything on woman on man on on everything that we we desire that the and the the the animals of the whole kingdom does as well they're waiting for us to be change can you guys hurry up and change cuz we want to change we don't want to be in the state of this cursed State anymore but the main curse actually that came on which wasn't mentioned there but was mentioned before they did it was the day you eat through of that day you'll die right so that was actually the main curse that happened it didn't actually need to be spoken because it was already spoken so when they did the act it came into Force right and so he says but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for the day you wa thereof Thou shalt surely die so the day that Eve the minute Eve took part in that act then then this curse of death struck into her that that curse just ended up there and now now Adam here's Adam Adam had a choice in whether he would go along with it or not but he went willingly he knew what he was doing but he still did it anyway now we're not going to go into the that but we just want to say that Adam ended up like this as well okay so Eve had this curse and Adam did the same thing now if he didn't he would have been all right because Eve was with the serpent he could have said no look not me okay but he did too so we ended up like this and then they had children after that which was Cain and Abel but and Adam called his uh wife's name Eve because we she was now the mother of all living but all living now had this curse this curse of death was just infested in the human race now whether you were from this someone was from the serpent or from uh Adam it didn't matter because they all came via Eve the mother of all living right but you say people think the scripture maybe is not correct because it says God said to the servant I'll put enity between there and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and people say well the woman doesn't have a seed well God made Adam and Eve one he said you'll be one so Eve seed was Adam's son that that's class as that's Eve seed because the serpent was the serpent seed because they weren't together that was the that was uh uh what do you call that um out of wedlock illegitimate son but Eve's seed because they were one was Adam's that's why he said I'll put imity between Cain and Abel between between that seed and that and your seed okay I just wanted to put in there but but the purpose I'm trying to make is that the whole human race ended up with this curse of death on them everybody they have a children children children children grandchildren whatever you you had this whole race that was cursed and this is why there was another law that said the innocent could die for the guilty that that this curse could be undone but yet we the picture before that not that this curse was just infested with everybody that's why Jesus had to come down as a different line outside of that with no curse he turned up without that curse of death there that's why it says a virgin shall conceive because we needed a new human being with blood just like us but not with without part not having any curse in order to undo that curse which was in the the heart of man now we tried to use the blood of bulls and goats to cover over it but it didn't take it away it didn't have the power to because it wasn't the same family we needed K kind we need it same I need someone that looks like me an animal last time I checked a lamb doesn't look like me it looks like a lamb it's got four legs I'm better than a lamb I'm a human being okay now that's why the Bible says Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law yeah being made a curse for us for it is written curse is everyone that HTH on a tree so he hung on the tree on the cross to take the curse from us okay Lord now that's why Paul says but those who depend on the law to make them right with God are under his curse for the scripture says cursed is everyone who does not observe and Obey all the commands that are written in God's book of the law now what he's saying is if you're trying to get rid of that curse by doing good things you there is no way anything no amount of good things you ever can do will ever take away that curse that's sitting in there he's saying that will only be taken away by a perfect one coming and pay paying the price of that that's right so so he's saying if you try and even do good to to to get rid of the curse you're cursed okay so that's that's what he's saying in this respect that's the only way you'll ever get rid of the curse is not by so we need to settle that this morning to get rid of this curse of death in us we need to accept and that's why the Lord's offering is always free moral agency like if you then I that's why you always did it if you obey me and if you don't do that it'll be good but if you do wrong this will happen it's always been like that that's the way God put us on and we feel like oh well I have to do all the work then well not really in this scenario the Lord Lord did all the work he came down paid the whole price he did everything all he said was okay all you have to do is accept it you want to get rid of that curse that's there don't worry about trying to work your way out of it just accept that I've paid the price that's all you have to do if you accept it I will forgive you simple as that done you want it gone then just accept it it's gone okay and so then we end up in the scenario okay yes I accept it then it's gone okay now the curse that curse of death that was in US is undone so that's now that's that that that's now that's dealing with our soul you understand so that now our soul is free from the curse okay now we have this this situation where we need to come down a little bit to now we then exist on this Earth in our body now I need to and this is what I want to try and or I need to emphasize this that these two are not the same what happens in there up in the soul realm it's not really related to what happens down here or vice versa and almost nothing you do here outside of except like no action here will affect your state up there okay I'll show you what I mean because when you you this will will make sense like so we got the first this is generally how the the human how we like to make it simple for ourselves right so we got this person on that side right so they got the curse of death on them usually when they then live in this world because they haven't accepted the lord they're not interested in it then they will then live outside of his word on this realm and then get a curse in this realm because the Curse still applies if you go outside my word you'll be cursed so so you steal you'll be cursed I'll get to that for argument sake so when they live in this realm they generally will be cursed as well okay generally speaking the next one is okay if someone on that side the curse is gone the curse of death is gone that will usually manifest into this realm that hey I want to follow the word of God live in inside his word do what I'm supposed to do you'll be blessed in this realm you know you things would just go slightly better for you than for than the cursed guy beside you okay however sometimes you can have someone that is that hasn't had the sin question settled over there and yet they can be blessed in this realm it's like that's why brother Adam was so against people that came in and said I come and shake hands with the pastor put your name in the book and you're in because he knew the sin question wasn't settled and then you go try and live a good life and you feed the the the poor and you do all these things now they live a life that's blessed and yet the sin question is not settled see so they can be blessed here and cursed there right and now the next person is somebody can actually be have the sin question settled and live the most horrible failure of a life here and just continue to fail until almost the day they die they never want to but they just for whatever reason they try their best they always sin their and it seems like they live a cursed life and they they actually could live a life that brings so much cursing on them but remember that doesn't affect their state over there you'd say well they wouldn't do that if they knew better these are anomalies sometimes people maybe they've done a lot of drugs and they just can't function properly in things and they just their life just seems to be a complete curse yet yet their soul their sin question is settled okay because these don't affect one another they don't they don't affect each other now that's why when you get to this this verse here that that Paul said when he talks about those that depend on the law to make them right with God are under the curse because he says curse everyone that does not observe and Obey all the laws that are written in God's book now this verse relates in two ways when he's saying it that way he's saying in terms of trying to get rid of the curse in your soul you cannot do it so that doing the law will not get rid of that curse but yet the curse of the still stands for someone for when we live here if you don't observe the laws when you're here you'll be cursed okay but if You observe them when you're here you'll be blessed that make sense right it it it it does so this scripture applies here but trying to make your soul uncursed by using the scripture to apply to that doesn't work you you got that there's only one scenario here almost every action you do on this Earth will not affect your spiritual the the state over there almost every action there's only one action you can do here in this body that will affect your state over there and that is I'll get to what it is but brother bam talked about that for a bit here and he said you know he said there's only one thing and he said he said I his mother used to think it was abortion she would say my mother used to because she didn't know any better she said it's a woman that would before child birth would have an abortion case taking the life of an innocent baby who didn't have a chance to be brought forth into the world his mother thought oh the the the sin you can commit here to make you not get in over there is abortion you have you bought a baby you're done that's not true you can have bought a 100 babies and be absolutely saved that's that's that's the truth this it's not the unforgivable sin now that you might say well that no one should have bought babies I know that but I'm saying they can and they will still be saved right because you got to stay with the word of God you can't just decide on your own mind oh I think this because it's it seems cruel that's not how it works or even here's another one that maybe I've had to think about this is suicide he said my father differ with you he said it's a man that would take his own life if that man takes his own life he's insane and he can never get to heaven cuz he committed suicide but that still is not the truth a person can commit suicide and be saved because it's not the unforgivable sin the unforgivable sin is bless me of the Holy Ghost which is actually pushing back and and despising the very thing that's trying to save your soul it's saying I don't want that it's an unclean thing I'm not into that at all just just despising that you you do that there's no forgiveness here or the world to come that's the only thing but every other sin you commit you could abort a 100 babies and kill yourself and you'll make it right that sounds rough but accept it because it's the truth but don't do it okay we have to stay now that's why now that's why we get these scenarios where where you know we may become unequally yolked I just want to put this in there because you can now see the situation generally speaking if you have this scenario and you're unequally yolked with an unbeliever spir in the spiritual realm it's going to be a little bit tricky for you then in the natural realm most of the time you're going to be you got a bless life the unbelievers a cursed life it's going to create problems you know that's just in this world you're going to create problems but Paul said look if you find yourself in this situation and you're happy then just go along with it it's all good yeah if you can survive like this and you enjoy it that's fine but he said if you don't if you're living in the situation and you don't enjoy it it's not working for you then you don't have to carry on in this situation because this is a scenario someone may find themselves in now cuz when we're talking about the bottom stuff we're now talking about quity of life and your reward over there and all these things that's what we're dealing with we're not dealing with I do more stuff therefore I'm more saved that's dealing with the curse this here is dealing with your quality of life how things EV all fa for you whether they go good or bad or up or down that's now what we deal with in blessing or cursing and that's very simple stay within his word you'll be blessed go outside you'll be cursed very very simple okay but but we're now dealing with the things we do here that have an effect only here only here and there to a degree cuz you get a reward but but this is ideally the way we want to be is equally yolked you know because then you have this cleaner situation but it's not always the case because the world is not a clean organized place okay that's the way that it is we don't live in an organized world where everything is perfect it's not the way that it goes here and I'm happy with that I'm happy that people can just press on in the Lord whatever state they find themselves in just press on in the Lord I'm happy with that that's what we do what does it all matter anyway deal with that sin question you've won the whole game anyway who cares who cares what hand you got here now but yet and then now we can do things here like here this this scenario of someone that could be uh cursed in their soul they haven't got the sin question settled but they live an outstanding life here and they they they're just so diligent on what they're doing they they these Sports people and that that are so uh they they win things and they they what's the word when you when you're on time for like you meet all go to all your training and all that and you dedicated and they're you know they're they're committed and they just they work so hard for for something that they love they do that in their natural human ability so I think if a natural human man can do that I should do the same for the Lord cuz that's what this now comes down to we are our natural you know if we really think well the Lord's my God we will naturally want to do the best we can here and human beings have got an ability to do very well because they've proven it that even this person that lives under a curse can still do really well on this Earth okay does that make sense because we don't want to be lazy or be just here and go well you know we can do a lot better always than what we right now here I just want to bring this to the natural thing now naturally speaking now on this Earth if you live inside the word of God you'll be blessed if you go outside the word of God you'll be cursed now you can live a cursed life and still be saved you understand when I say curs it's like well I'm cursed I'm out that doesn't actually work like that okay okay now that's why when when when um the children of Israel went into the land God said if you do well I'll bless you everything work yeah you I'll defeat your reion you'll do well if you if you do sinfully then everything will start going bad for you but you're in the land okay but your experience in the land is going to be determined by your actions right but you're still in the land You're Going To Live and Die in the land most of the time but okay so now now now I just want to give you an example so just to drive this point home like if you honor your parents you'll be blessed now that's actually the first commandment that the it's the first commandment with promise saying if you do this you'll be blessed that's actually a Commandment that is more than just oh well you may be it it actually is if you honor your parents you will be blessed your life here will be better than if you didn't right because if you Dison your parents your life is going to be slightly worse to what degree I don't know but it will be worse because there's a cursing that comes with dishonoring your parents okay um it says it's more blessed to give than to receive if you give your life will be slightly more blessed than if than if you steal your life here your experience will be cursed have you noticed people that a I can always tell a thief because they lock everything you know I park my cars out the back leave keys them whatever nothing ever happens to my stuff my a guy around the corner which we all know he dodgy he comes and Parks a car around the side where I park my car with keys and everything and if ever he's left an old wreck there we're talking an old wreck that you didn't wouldn't even want to steal he's locking all the gates oh someone might steal it CU I know he's a thief and all the stuff gets stolen that's the way it works he he lives a cursed life none of my stuff ever gets stolen if it does Satan's got to give it back at some point right okay now you be a peacemaker blessed are the peacemakers you you create peace you'll be blessed if you start conflicts all the time you'll be cursed yet that that will be your experience in this realm now there may be many well meaning good Christians that just start conflicts that's just their but they got to learn okay stop starting conflicts that but it might just be their personality and God's got to change it but as long as they do their experience here will be cursed that doesn't mean they're not saved that's what we're saying here right cuz we all probably do half of this stuff you know you know or we uplift people you know we there's a blessing uplifting people uh there's a cursing and slandering of people and tearing them down that's that's because we don't know what Spirit we're of you know uh if we respect God's anointed there's a blessing in that even a non-Christian if they respect God's anointing there's a blessing in that for them uh if you if we tear down or hurt God's anointed there's a cursing in that and sometimes it's a higher degree some of these things say you know when a little child does something wrong he say don't do that again a little little bit like that but then if they do something really bad they might get two or three you know like the the punishment is is meat for the the crime if you know what I mean like you know in the Lord some things are there's a little blip when we do something other things you start doing this sort of stuff this like tearing down God's anointed that that that's a quite a high uh you'll be in bigger trouble put it that way that that that'll bring things on your life that you probably don't want okay but if you bless the god anointed and respect the officers in that God will bless your life okay uh you be gracious to people blessed are the merciful you'll be blessed but if you're unmerciful this one probably has a worse a degree the people the The Killers you know you notice that the Bible says you live by the sword you die by the sword you know and you notice that usually gangsters and guys that have spent their life killing people doing this stuff at the end they get killed themselves in some horrible way and their body just chucked out in the in the ocean somewhere just in a in a in a in a a a grave a markless grave you know cuz that's how that was that was the reward of their actions you know they don't die nice death on their bed family around you know I love you it's it's not us yeah sometimes it is but they CU not not every reward happens here some of it happens over there okay so that's why we don't fret when we see people doing evil oh why are they blessed now and I do this and I get cursed seems like you know don't worry it will all come out even that's what I want you to understand right uh now this one here don't commit sexual sin like don't be with anyone outside of when you get married then you get married I if you because if you do if you do that you'll if you go outside that you'll be cursed and this is the one sin that that Paul says all the other sins are without your body he said but if you do that when you commit it against your own body so that's one s where you you actually bring some curse directly onto you you don't want that don't do that if you haven't done it yet don't do it stay blessed keep your body blessed you know cuz when when when it gets cursed you can't really you maybe the curse deciat after a while but it's just you know if you have move on it doesn't affect up there okay but it affects here okay so if you got if you if you got a chance do the be a winner here you know win the best you can be the most diligent study the word like David said Thy word have I hi in my heart that I might not sin against you he tried hard he didn't he wasn't lazy in his approach he said I'm going to read it what does it say what do I do I want to get this right I want to be blessed and he CU then he could say Lord you see the pureness of my heart how Lord I've been righteous before you then judge me according to my works he could be bold before the lord judge me Lord I'm righteous oh that's a bit no it's the truth when you know you're blessed you don't have to worry if Satan comes at your messes with your life it's all right everything's going to be right I'm blessed doesn't look like it brother it doesn't matter what it looks like I am and that's what job that's what happened to job he said I am blessed doesn't look like it see and that's why we say God's judgments of blessing or cursing are just and they're always the same they're they're they're always correct yeah okay that's why he said be not deceived God is Not mocked whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also reap he said he said it's always going to be his judgment is going to be perfect the the challenge the issue that we have is that now we could say this firstly it all balances out right in the end but God won't reward good with evil okay but he won't reward evil with good yeah right but Satan will reward good with evil and he will reward evil with good he he'll he'll but he's he's bringing a curse on himself yeah yeah this is important understanding cuz people say well I'm blessed you sure it's God like because if it's outside of his word Satan Satan's got the ability to bless us with things I think I should go this is hopefully I get this thought through this little bit here because when I was thinking it it didn't it I think I'll get it across the where I'm supposed to be the Lord is honest he says okay if you serve me yeah you'll be blessed you'll be saved but you'll be persecuted uh you'll be out card said if you do wrong you'll be punished so you know but if you do well you'll be blessed but he's honest with us about how it's all going to happen and we go y I'm I'm into that you know but Satan is deceptive he says oh you'll be accepted oh you'll be part of the crowd it's all going to be all right or you know and then if you go and sin he'll try and reward you for that to encourage you to keep sinning but he's deceptive to to to curse you right so so what I'm saying is his dealings with us aren't honest they're to they're to keep us away they to keep us in a cursed State not a blessed state right that's why sin is actually pleasurable like like that's why so many people do it cuz it's pleasurable CU it's got to be otherwise no one would do it and Satan wouldn't have any success okay now let's be honest but it's only pleasurable for a season like I said it's all going to come out in the end everything's going to be squared up you live like that you'll be cursed oh I'm having a good time no we will be squared up at some point oh I'm living righteous but it seems like everything's just going bad for me don't worry it'll all square up at some point whether here or there it's all going to square up you don't need to worry about that okay and that's why that's why Moses looked around and he and it's the Bible says that he chose to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin because they're only for a season this this pleasure is just for a season at some point it comes to an end and there's a Day of Reckoning and he thought no I want to throw my lot with the Lord's people I want to go with his lot cuz I know there's a blessing in that I don't want this even though it may appear like he could have stayed within the house of pharaoh and had it but he said no I want to be with the Lord now in that case Pharaoh decided to go his way and despise the children of God and and try to kill them and all these things he he and Moses decided to go the other way now their Day of Reckoning happened here on this Earth but it doesn't always happen that way there was a Day of Reckoning where pharaoh and all his people were drowned and God's people walked away that's always the way that it works out in the end whether here or over there see now the reason why I brought that thought in before was because because Satan can bless to deceive and and we got to watch that cuz you'll find if you you can boil a lot of false Christianity down to Satan just blessing to deceive people say this one you know God blessed Isaac 100-fold in one year wow praise God you know but Isaac was it was different like it was just the way god Hades with that but here this one here this is the Beatles they would have got blessed 100 fold in one year Satan can offer the same thing and he often does oh you you notice all Satan's people are wealthy you know see many you know see a lot of like the the Great Men of the world that are that are evil are wealthy cuz Satan owns the wealth and he He blesses them as they do his work blesses you see it's his Blessing but you understand his Blessing is to curse them to make them see but God God's blessings are always just they're always Fair they're always right and it's it's never deceptive right or or David said you know the story tells about David he was taken from a sheep bold and made famous you know I'll give you a name like the name of Great Men David's not the only famous man in the world Satan took people like Elvis I'll take you out of that those little churchy things and make you a great man over here and he gave him the same thing but in the end these two men there's a reckoning for both these men one was blessed one was cursed it didn't matter at the time they appeared to get the same thing okay uh and that's why the thing that that Satan tempted Jesus with was I'll bless you I'll give you wealth I'll give you this I'll give you that you know to bless him to get him on a different path But ultimately to curse him okay so so that's why in this situation you got like like job it would appear like oh he went from riches to no riches so oh it appear like oh job's cursed you start watching his life imagine knowing job oh you hear what happened to job lately or family yeah this family then all the family are going oh man things are really not going good for them are they our natural perception is God's cursing them uh oh he was really healthy now he's just sick no matter what they pray for him the man can't heal you know oh and that's why his friends came to him and they said job it's because you've cursed uh because God's cursed you because you've done some sin and that's why this has come upon you but as I said earlier job knew he hadn't am see now that's that's why we don't have to worry about cursings and that sort of stuff if you know you're in the word of God don't worry about it it's all going to come out right in the end job knew where he stood I know where I stand I know who I am he knew where he stood he thought no I'm blessed I'm living inside the word of God I don't care what's happening around me I'm blessed his friends always convince you no you're not you're cursed well if I'm cursed I don't know why there's nothing in my heart I'm living inside the word of God it's all going to be right that's the way we need to be and have a confidence in the Lord that if we're inside his word don't worry about what you see because God is going to balance everything out eventually okay that's like what we said here God won't reward good with evil and he won't reward evil with good but Satan in job's case rewarded evil with good he but you see in the end it all had to get balanced out now in job's case because Satan had robbed him he had to pay him back the law of uh if you steal you've got to restore a certain amount God enforced that law on him he said okay okay Satan now you are going to pay him back x amount plus more because you stole God enforced it because everything has to come out balanced in the end in that situation that's why no curse undeserved will stand in the same way no blessing undeserved will stand okay they cannot they cannot exist that they have a a curse undeserved will not stand it can't become substance it has to eventually be undone and a blessing that's undeserved has to get undone that's why if you stand the word of God just you can rest up you be right that's why the scripture here says as the bird by wandering as the swallow by flying so the curse caus shall not come or another version to make it un more understandable like a fluttering Sparrow or darting swallow and undeserved curse will not land on its intended victim okay that's why the undeserved curse on job could not land on him because he didn't deserve it the undeserved curse cannot so so you don't need to there are so many examples of this in the Bible like job I just said it the undeserved curse could not stick with him because he didn't deserve it now if he was a sinner his life would have gone a certain way he still would have been saved but whatever whatever you know uh here's another one of balum at the point in time the children of Israel were blessed now sometimes God will allow Satan to yeah have a little go other times he says you know what no and in this instance he said no but they tried to curse the children of Israel and the other king said to Bam curse them balam tried and all he did was blessed because there was a blessing on them and he couldn't the curse couldn't override the blessing he said I'm trying to curse him but I just end up blessing at that point in time God didn't allow now if God wanted to let thisel go through a thing like job he would have said okay uh yet curse them and it'll come up upon them whatever for a while then but even if they did that that would have all been undone at some point because they didn't deserve the curse at that time so that's why balum could not curse them okay that's why I think maybe people from Africa and that you know people get scared about oh you heard about the witch doctors all these Wizards witches those guys are nonsense they don't have any Authority they don't have any power they they how can they have any authority over you if you're inside the word of God they the the person they do the most harm to is themselves because they bring so many curses on themselves by trying to curse other letting Satan work through them to curse other people they bring so many curses on their life I've heard so many stories about these people and their family line just being sick and diseased and they you cannot do this sort of stuff and try and curse a good thing and live a blessed life the these poor men and women have given themselves over to the most dumbest uh uh vocation don't be scared of these people they've got nothing can I just make that clear these witch doctors and these wizards and they got nothing they're just little human people that think they now the the Satan that they serve yes he's powerful he can affect things but he's not more powerful than the word of God that's why and and it's like it's not like God it's not like Satan doesn't know who I am if some which doctor said oh hey and summons up some Demon oh can you try and curse Isaac they're like oh Isaac you talking about that guy in in uh Wellington that Isaac uh yeah tried that uh yeah no uh you know you we know him H don't think that Satan and demons don't already know you and the more you do for the Lord the more they know you so what's some little witch doctor oh hey excuse me can you curse him oh we tried you know you understand that's why when the sons of uh was it ska said they tried to do the stuff and the demon said Paul I know Jesus I know I know them that's right he knew Paul but Paul could carry on his merry way doing his thing why cuz he was blessed and and oh I know what the and and I I pushed the button and Satan couldn't Satan you know Satan so that's the the here we go so that's the witch doctor thing you're not scared of those people anymore the Wizards all that nonsense no they bring it on themselves they've got no power okay amen they do have a minor amount of Power with their words because we as human beings have power in our words I'll get to that shortly okay but but just to put that all that superstitious stuff to bed if you are inside the word of God you're worry about nothing okay a curse caus this will not come don't worry about it it cannot it's outside the word of God and even if they try it it all it will all get undone and the curse will sit where it's supposed to in the end okay okay that's that's the way that this stuff now I just pushed the a little button here but now but on the same token because now we we deal in blessing not cursing right as a Christian but we also have the ability to undo a curse that's supposed to be there which we have to watch that we don't do that and that's why Paul said uh seeing that uh Jesus said brother vom said seeing that come to pass then Lord we're bringing the sick tonight to this platform to lay hands upon them and pronounce your blessing because that's what we do as Christians we bless right he says if we should lay hands upon something that you have cursed God withhold your blessing but if everyone has repented of their sins and they're ready to receive it I pray that you'll heal every person that's in your divine presence tonight okay that's why the Bible says lay hands suddenly on no man because sometimes God's doing something and and we go and and we we can actually undo that thing that God's doing that curse or that or that allowance cuz that we can undo that and I'm going to be honest with you some those people say I'll pray for this person I don't pray for that person just honest with you because I think I don't know who they are from a bar of soap and I don't know what sort of Life they're living and I don't know why they're in that situation what sort of authority can I have to approach that and be of any use all can be Lord just I pray that your perfect will will be worked in that situation but I cannot pray directly heal that person when I don't know who they I don't know why it's on them I don't know anything about it I I just I just can't fight it on myself to do it and even people something you say are you sure are you are you sure there's no nothing you're happy with your state if you're sick you're happy everything's good yep brother I'm good I'm no I I I want my healing and there's nothing that's it's not anything it's just Satan's at me whatever you understand pray for me but they got to be sure in themselves it so but we can undo cursings that were supposed to be there okay um now here is this one here this is just going into these different Dynamics we there's this concept that you can hand someone over to Satan to that they cursed in the body and this applies to now in a fellowship when you go when you're part of a fellowship and and under an anointed Pastor like a god-given pastor anointed then there's a blessing on your life there's a protection there's something on your life that happens that you get blessed from being that now what what Paul is saying is if there's someone sitting in there and they're willfully committing sin that they know it's wrong you know it's wrong even knows it's wrong they just continuing on in that now not it's there's it's a difference to make a mistake and and regret it that's never really a it's a sin but like a true a True Believer sins all the time you always regret it you're like I don't want to do that but when someone's in a state where they can sin they say I don't care then that's different that that's when the Bible says if we sin willfully after we've received the knowledge of the truth they Remain the fful now no more sacrifice for sin now don't apply that will if I think I going to do one thing then I'm out forever but it's just it's this concept like that man that was sinning in this church church that Paul was at in the Corinthian Church he was willfully sinning and wouldn't do anything about it so what so what Paul said to do with that man was okay he's under a blessing he's under an anointed Pastor he's under a blessing you need to deliver him over to Satan in his flesh you need to get him out of there take that blessing off him let his life be miserable take it off him put him out there so that he learns not to do that don't have him doing that and and enjoying the blessings of God and living sin don't allow that and and and and it was a spiritual thing it was Tak him out from the blessing even if he comes and sits in church the next week the blessing could is and he said they it's not I'm no longer sitting in the Pew it's it's no longer the the the blessing is no longer on your life he could sit in the Pew and no blessing on his life he could sit there for the next 10 years and his life's cursed it's just because he's he chose that path or she did does that make sense that's what this is about take them out of that blessing all right and that's what God as a father like when when his children were in the land if they did what was right they would be blessed if they did what was wrong he would let the wild beasts coming would let the other Armies come in and just overtake them that's this is similar to what we just talked about but it's slightly different he would as a father say okay you want to do wrong then I'll let these people come in all you going to do right now I'll drive them away right now I want to say this because fathers here have the same ability to do that you won't like this children but the fathers have the ability to bless or curse your life I don't see many other instances where I have the ability over another human being to do that but one of them that I see because I see God could do that as a father he could say you do right I'll bless you uh you do wrong I'll curse you and let me tell you this use this like the last thing I want is if I've got an offspring that decides to live a life of sin you can be sure is anything that's not going to be pleasurable for them because if they can go out and live a life of sin and Satan can make it pleasurable there's a high chance of keep on doing it but I think the minute you try and go that way I'm going to curse your life so much I'm going to curse everything you do I'm going to curse your health I'm going to curse everything I can because you're not going to that might sound rough but you're not going to go and live a life of sin and prosper there is no way you think about the what was it the prodigal son what made him turn is the fact that it all just went totally bad I'm coming back that's the way it's going to be for any of my Offspring it's going to go absolutely bad there's no blessing there's no nothing as long as you go that way now that's the way it's going to be and they've seen it you go that way and it and it unfolds the way that my mouth says it's going to unfold because I know who I am I know where I stand I've got Authority but you serve God I'll bless your life I I'll speak a blessing on it and your life's just going to be blessed it's going to be richly blessed use that little trick okay fathers don't be scared it's the authority that you've got don't let if they if they if they do well bless him if they if they going the wrong way don't let Satan get the upper hand no it's going to go bad and there'll be that prodical sun that will come back and I've experienced it cuz I said everything is going to go bad it's a real thing like and they would the the the the fathers and in the old time they were bless and curse you know okay that's the authority that we have okay use that little trick now we've got this thing called inherited blessings or cursings this is something that maybe we get confused about but when you look into it you're like okay yeah well I guess it's the way that it is and I but I didn't really understand this I thought this kind of wasn't fair for a while I'm like how's that fair I did nothing I turned up and then I got to deal with all this other stuff that other people did how's that fair on me you know just as a intellectual standpoint but the Bible says Thou shalt not bow thyself down unto them nor serve them talking of the Gods for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the th third and fourth generation of them that hate me and showing Mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my Commandments now that translation is actually if you sin I'll visit that to the third and fourth generation your sin but if you do right I'll I'll bless I'll visit that on a thousand Generations like yeah so Lord Lord if there's someone within a thousand Generations back to me that's being righteous I accept that blessing somewhere on my life got to be someone somewhere even if I come from a big line of pagans one of them somewhere has got to be was loved you Lord and I'll take that blessing back a thousand Generations may his favor be upon you in a thousand Generations that's what that's about you know but now when we look at this this is the truth is that your body is not yours that I was supposed to write that it's not actually yours you completely inherited it from your father and mother there's no part of it that's yours you you were the spirit that came in but your body was like it was made from someone else and you went and lived in it so everything that they were you had to move into that's why every everything they've done up to that point gets like a little portion of goes and makes another little thing everything they are is there that's why you inherit whatever sins blessings whatever you because it's them like my body is not my my body's my parents so is yours it's not actually yours right when you think about your it's actually correct sounds rough but it's correct right now here is a here is the third and fourth generation actually means five lines cuz it's like Grand uh son grandson great grandson great great grandson that's that's four generations from you and if I went from me here this would be this would be that back when I counted it I realized I've got 30 people that lived on this world that that directly affected My outcome here 30 right cuz that's the your grandparents great grandparents and great grand grandparents here 15 men and 15 women so you all have the same amount as me you've got 15 men and 15 women that have affected your existence here how do you feel about that hey but depends what line you come from you know I say to David you guys your third generation of blessing you know that's coming on you my father turned the tide of paganism and just ungodliness and and in our line and then he and and I was able to live a little bit better then then I've turned it a bit more to my son cuz that the cursing or blessings go either way okay but but they can be undone okay it's not like but but you are just going to in he some of them and it's just you know but the blessings also come down that's why Abraham it said it said Paul said of Levi he said Levi also he who received tithes paid tithes and Abraham he's saying Le and now now Abraham was here and Abraham paid tithe but because Abraham carried on an existence down to Levi Abraham was in Levi then he says that tithe paying was attributed to Levi Levi you paid tithe I did WOW Levi's body paid tithe so he got because he paid tithe and he didn't give $1 and yet because because he was an Abraham then he paid tithe and because it it was only back we're only talking the third one so he still had he could claim one more line he could claim um Abraham's parents you know bit more there you understand okay now that may sound a bit like oh negative but what you have is choice you don't that's what you have when you get this body you have choice of them what you do with it yeah however it's given to you whatever it is what it is you know you can try and undo those but and you can do things you can cut them off your life and those sort of things but what you do have is choice of what you do now with that land they gave it to you but you then live in it you say right I'm going to decide now what I do with this now whether you get a nice bit or a messy bit I've seen many people that have that started that got a nice slot and ended up with a mess and I've seen many that started off with a mess and ended up with a glorious thing that's what God does if you decide look Lord I want you to bless me he'll bless your land he'll bless your life he'll he'll turn it all around and he's got he's he's a Creator Lord bless me create Lord take this ugly Rock that's like that I got handed no life on it just a line of evil paganism take that Lord and bless it and God will bless it only took him seven days to make the world you know he's got he's got your lifetime's going to be enough to bless it to make it something you know so okay I want to explain to you this here this is just a little side thought but this now applies to humanity as a whole cuz I've always thought there's something about the baby boom of the 50s generation there's something about that generation that have sort of had it the best out of anybody in the existence almost of the world right and then I researched it and it said the year 1956 has been voted the best year in which to be born with Children of the 1950s more content than any subsequent Generations according in new research a staggering 88% of those born in the 1950s admit that their generation has been luckier than others Which is far more than those born in later decades what year were you born 46 okay you're you're soon not as blessed as this [Laughter] group sorry bro it's all right you made up for it by the the Lord made up for it okay now we're going to apply the principle of four to five generations because what the generations did before that Came Upon and Came Upon and and if you look at this if if you and I'm I'm probably talking more about Western countries countries that embraced Christianity right this goes back about 100 years so you think from 1850 it was always I would say now we now Solomon says don't look back and think the older times were better than these times but in a spiritual sense there was a lot less evil there than what there is now right so you've got this generation say that was born in 1850 and and these Western countries you know I know these more I can't speak for other countries but I know these countries and I know their history and you can see godliness coming so you can see a wave of godly people come in they have children a bigger wave of godliness they have children a bigger wave of godliness still maybe someone born in in like that's supposed to be uh sorry 1925 the the the the the culture around the time Western countries was Godly so they so you can imagine you've got a buildup of blessing coming upon so this generation that was bornn in the 50s had a buildup like if you went back further 17 1600s it was a little bit weird in there but as it as it came good four to five generations later you had this generation born on the Earth that that just had like a influx of blessing on their life they inherited a world that had been blessed by the previous generations but what did they do with it Satan knew they were blessed too and he worked so hard to destroy it and from when they were born they they were they were teenagers in the 60s what happened in the 60s things got worse and 65 was you know the middle of the 60s these guys were 15 16 17 they just started Living in sin and they started doing all that and then by 75 day children and the children are going to inherit some of the blessing but some of the cursing and then those children they the 75 people graph and they get worse and worse until the next Generation comes they get worse so instead of having a buildup of blessing you're now having a slow buildup of cursing coming upon the Earth generation after generation and it only takes 100 years for this generation is 100 years to change the whole landscape of the earth 100 Years and we're we got what the one born now is by the end of it we should be pretty well when this one born today when they're 25 it' be pretty well done right and that's why brother Bram said and people today the teenagers out in high school with beer parties and drinking and living in little girls living in adultery little boys and things like that what kind of a generation is coming after coming up after that what makes these little girls act like this their mommy was a flapper their grandmam was a chorus girl and he said he would visit the iniquity of the parents upon the children and the children's children to the third and fourth generation what can you expect anymore and when the the whole thing begin to leak out and the righteous seed begins sitting on the side Getting Thinner and thinner and the wicked just keep on very religious just keep getting Wicked the whole generation getting more and more wicked and cursed he said and wickeder and wickeder there's nothing to do but to destroy the whole thing like he did back there in the anti dovian destruction all right every thought of man is continually full of sin everything man thinks about today is a bottle of whiskey or some woman or out running around can't love true to their wives the boys can't love true to the girls girls can't love true to the boys why they're in such a place to the de the devil has got them so bound and possessed with evil spirits the whole thing has become a conglomeration of sin a buildup that's the reason we're in the day and that's the reason that Russia is playing exactly in the hands of God to rock this thing out here out of here the Bible says so certainly God is using communism he will use Comm he will use it communism will destroy the entire thing according to the scripture and we're in that day the buildup of a cursing on Humanity you can't see there's there's that's why I say you can't live wrong and think it's all going to be right the curses all have to be balanced out that everything gets balanced out and there's a reckoning for everything and that's why in the 50s and 60s they thought this is great we're having a good time and everything's still going good yeah it will for you cuz you you've got overflow blessing you let the generation go further and further on you watch what it's doing you just enjoyed like some person hereit a business got a whole lot of money some usually the the the parents build it the second generation milk it the third generation destroy it that's generally the the life of a family business very rare if they go outside of that and it's the same with us you know these the generation came along with this blessing ah look everything's going well sweet we just party up they milked this blessing out of there and just did Sin then they passed the sin on and then the next Generation right and as we're speaking to pick up the little subject again just now for a minute now how the legitimate child could not enter the kingdom for 14 Generations 400 years and how that the iniquity of the parents was visit to the children to the third and fourth generation and this one and the righteousness of the parents was visited what you do if there is a coming tomorrow and you have a great grandson your action today will determine what he'll be then so the very things you're doing are going to determine your great great grandson's outcome right now and then and this is just down further in that quote and then this young C generation running around smoking drinking and everything how do you expect another generation to exist the reason we got s the juvenile delinquency now the reason we got little girls on the street and little boys is because their mothers and daddies did what they did in their bygone age and the reason we still got preachers who still stand for truth the reason we still got some oldfashioned girls is because they had oldfashioned Parents behind them that's exactly right we still got preachers that stands uncompromising with any denomination or the word is because we've had is we we had oldfashioned preachers in the back stood right on the same ground yes see okay now I've almost done here we've got this concept of blessed countries there is a concept of blessed countri count not many cuz there sort of a few they I but there is a country that's that's eternally blessed and that's Israel that because that's God's people that's God's country so they're they're one of the ones that they're going to be eternally blessed you know and that's why it says if you bless them you'll be blessed if you curse them you'll be cursed often thought a business I might import Israeli goods and sell them you know to help the country then I'll be blessed you know I'll bless Israel you know so if you see anything made in Israel just buy it you know God will bless you or pray for them you know like do things to bless Israel you'll be blessed if you curse him you'll be cursed what's happening today there's so much cursing on Israel they just they're cursing it shouldn't exist the whole the world is cursing Israel what are they bringing on them a curse there Satan's played it off like Israel's bad and everyone else is good but he knows he's only bringing all the world into a curse he knows that he's deceiving them to bring them into a curse okay now we got blessed and cursed cities um there's a city called Jerusalem that's blessed and there's a city called Jericho that was cursed cuz Joshua said cursed is and Joshua adjured them at their time and said cursed be the man before the Lord that raiseth up and buth the City Jericho so Jericho was always going to be a cursed City anyone that built some more stones to build a town there is going to be cursed and and then brother B tells a story about the the man that in the end the um Good Samaritan helped him he said he was on his way from Jerusalem to Jericho he was going from the Blessed City to a cursed City and he likened it he said look that's about the way it is in their life you know when we go from the blessings of God and we start wandering out to these cursed places is that's when all the trouble starts you know we along the way somewhere you know when we're heading in that direction and that was where that man found himself heading from a blessed City to a cur City uh there's a city called capernium that Jesus lived at when he was he he moved to capernium may maybe late teens or at some point he moved there and it says and leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in capernum which is by the sea in the regions of nebulon and naftali that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by isias the prophet saying the land of zebulun and the land of nephal by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and the shadow of death light has sprung up so now here's this area that the Son of God went and lived at and then the Bible says they're blessed because the light came and that that area is blessed there are many miracles happened there that's where Peter's mother-in-law was held in capernium okay uh you know the nobleman's son healed he said pray for my son he said Your son's healed and then the man walked back to his house and the servants met him along the way and said oh your son's been healed and he said oh what time was it they said it was about this time and it was the same time Jesus said he was healed right that was that was this miracle happened in capernium uh the Centurion that said uh uh he you know he my servant he said but then you know that this story when the Centurion said he needs to be healed but you don't need to go there I'm you're a man I'm a man under Authority like you just speak the word and it'll happen that happened in capernium okay um and Jar's daughter that was healed that that was in capernium and and Jesus preached many times in capernium did all these Miracles but yet the the people in capernum rejected him and this town had so much light there and that's why that's why Jesus said and then he said and now capernum which out exal to Heaven Thou shalt be brought down to hell for if the mighty Works which have been done in thee had been done in Sodom would have remain unto this day said look what's happened here you've got all this blessing and you chose to despise it he said your your city is finished capernium to this day doesn't stand doesn't exist doesn't exist it just it ruins that's capernium there the Glamorous city of God you know where the Lord lived it's ruins because it's cursed don't you know some developers don't buy land there you know thinking oh let's let's you know let's grow the city it'll never grow everything will go wrong for it because it's cursed it's it's always going to be cursed and I can only really name two cities which is Rome is cursed and this I can name the city of Los Angeles that's we can definitely say that city is cursed but actually America because you think of all the Miracles that God did all around the country and they slowly rejected them that the whole country as a whole has got a curse we don't get out of it CU we've all slowly rejected it too but but that was the epicenter of the Miracles like we I listed off four miracles in capernum and that place was done away with because of that I'm going through the supernatural book writing everything down the the amount of things that happen in America is just 100 times more than capernum that's why it's going like it is it's the the the nation itself is cursed now and you can see that it's becoming a laughing stock of the world is cursed uh but but Al as a city is cursed when brother Brandon was there he said you're going to be cursed like capernum so I wouldn't recommend going living there because it's a cursed City and a physical location is cursed okay just out of Interest I think Levin is blessed I don't know that for a fact but and I know we I say it as a joke but I actually have noticed something I think there something different about this place there's for some reason there's something on it I don't feel any negative things I feel a positive thing there are some places in this country I think I'll never live there it feels like it's cursed on the hawk Bay something about that place is maybe I could go there and break it but I'm not really into that I'll just go where there's no curse you know now I don't know you decide that yourself but where you live matters just check that you know you should have a piece I everything's all right where I live okay I'm almost done here now let me just talk about the power of our words we talked about the witch doctors why I said the only Power they have sometimes is what they say CU they are like Gods too you know we're created like Gods so we still do have power with our words and James said but the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison therewith bless we God even the father and therewith curse We Men which are made out to the similitude of God out of the same mouth proceed blessings and cursings my brethren these things ought not so to be okay so be very careful with what you do with your mouth that you bless you don't curse because it's very powerful this is a this is a uh a Japanese uh I think it was a scientist he did this experiment and then people do it you can do it yourself you just cook rice and you put it in jars and you speak loving nice words to one and you speak hate to the other one and eventually this is what happens to it the the one the hate jar and all the experiments I've seen the jar with the rice of hate over maybe four five six seven eight weeks couple of months it always goes rancid and the one that you're speaking love to stays good it gets a little bit but you know it's it's it's noticeably different that's because and people don't know why and and people scientists say know that's rubbish there's nothing in that we know there's something in that because we know our words have power to create we're like creators we can create an atmosphere around that Rice we create atmospheres we say I love you you're you're you're the most amazing rice ever I just really love you the other and that Rice will take on our words there's water in there that just the water water actually obser water takes in feelings and things water and our bodies are mainly water they take in things so the water in that rice is probably taking it in man I'm good I'm a good rice I'm such a I'm a loved rice I'm not even being eaten but the other one was it was like man no one loves me hates me and it just this infestation starts to grow in the rice I think it's to do with the water I I think that's what it is cuz water does they have that's something they have learned that water takes on this atmosphere around it and they can see the the I forget the experiment but they they looked at it and they played different music like a nice music to water and the the shape of the water changed and they they played evil stuff to it and the shape of the water went all deformed the the makeup of it so and that's what happens to us could I just read you a few quotes from Brother Brenham here this this may seem negative but I just want to show you that this these are just some of the things I had so many of these to give but I just and I had some POS more positive ones but I just want to read a few of these then we we're almost just inclosing here he's talking about someone that's trying to affect like a wit doctor like a evil person trying to affect him at his meeting he said that's right see them going in standing trying to hypnotize me this is what he was in a meeting and went over there he was going to make me bark like a dog and standing out there trying to do something like that I felt that strange Spirit while the anointing was on I looked and I said you child of the devil why do you do that I said cursed be you you'll not move from your seat in the name of Jesus Christ for the glory of God and then that man was paralyzed sitting there in the seat and they packed him out he was trying to you know that the spirit of God would have come on and said and and so that man was cursed now he may be saved he might find it hard to accept but he may be saved we just cursed in that situation but probably if he's despising the Holy Ghost like that but I'm saying if he didn't do that then he he can still go back to the hospital and be paralyzed say Lord forgive me I'm sorry and you know right here's another one this is a man that that tried to prove that brother Brandon was at was doing trickery and and he was just reading the prayer card so he wrote a whole lot of wrong things on his prayer card and went up in the prayer line to say oh look he's he just reads the cards and he'll read me these things out but I don't actually have them and then he'll say you've got this and that and that so he went and S and that man raised up and and brother BR I'm sorry there to before this quote and he he pointed out what had happened he said last night you you came in and you wrote these things out and and you were going to come in and try and trick me and do that that's what you've done and then so brother then brought it out to light he said and that man raised up and saying Rend Bram that's the truth I was with him last night and that's the truth and the man on the ppit sorry you grabbed the grab me by my pants s and he said I'm sorry and I said what you put on your prayer card you now have and I and he said oh pray pray for me that you know that it doesn't happen he was a preacher and brother Bram said I have nothing to do with that you cursed yourself so you have what you put on the prayer card and screaming he run from the building he said that was it I didn't know what happened to him from there but he said whatever you put on your card you've got um there was on on a blessing one there was another man that came to the ppit and brother brand said to him he was an old man he said he said hang on brother he said I see a you've had a hard life this there's I see a long hard Road between you and I there's something you've had a very hard Road and he said you've even had to do a lot of things just to sneak in and get here and he studied his life a bit and he said he said you got all these diseases and things and and he said but you kind of in your heart you love the Lord but you've just had a hard Road and he said then he said I see a track he said I can I can see a a a track he said oh you you've written some sort of track that um he said you've cursed God that's what it is you've written a track and this this man had written a track and he said is there a god I curse him and he handed the track out and he said he said you paid a dare price for that brother you you paid you you paid for doing that he said you've had a lot of trouble on your home and he said but God's here today to break that off your life here come here brother I know you I know you love the Lord and I'm going to bless you and he he just prayed a simple prayer for he said it's all over brother God bless you you're blessed you're blessed like that that's what God can do just doesn't it doesn't Linger on no that's it you're blessed you can be blessed you want it receive it and he walked out blessed handed tracks out cursing God and he actually had the track in his pocket he said here this is the track here maybe he was going to confess it okay this one here was quite powerful brother Bron was trying to pray pray for a person and I think people were just being so noisy and I think I think when the spirit of God came if it was he said bodies are like spirits and if they move the spirit's moving it distracts him from seeing the vision and he would that's why says don't move keep your eyes closed just more so so that this person can receive what they want so no one gets distracted I don't get distracted I can help this person and I think people kept on moving and this and that and he kept on saying look don't do that can you just stop moving and then something came on and me his voice changed and he said how do you do lady and this is while this has been happening he said Do you believe you believe me to be a servant if God will reveal to me what your trouble is will you accept it then he stops and he must talk to someone else he says I can't help it sir see the vision just leaves me cuz people are just moving around he said then as voice changed he said in the name of Jesus Christ the son of God may you sit still cursed be you if you move from now on until you're called for the sake of these things I say it and if I be God's Prophet you better be careful what you're doing he just said you'll be cursed if you move anymore cuz because he couldn't get the vision to help this lady I thought that was quite powerful um one more somebody else said brother Brown might been to church but never did I see the Bible made real like that he said there's got there's got to be something you know there's something about that he said now depends on what you think it is when you begin to see the revealed word of God if you want to say it's beab go ahead that's between you and God if you believe it's Jesus Christ then God will reward you for it but that's the only way you'll ever you'll either be cursed by it or you'll be blessed by it either one which one you want to it's up to you so if we receive it as from the Lord we'll be blessed this revealed word Lord thank you we'll just be so blessed you know but if you want to say n there b like this we'll listen that this one here is just about saying if you baptized any other way you'll be or if anyone speaks any other goel than what I've spoken to him let him be a cursed so there's many cursed preachers that are preaching a gospel that is not the word of God like even to go out and preach um baptism in the titles and I baptize that that the people that do that are cursed because Paul said if they preach any other gospel than what I've spoken you let them be a cursed so as a result of speaking those things they're cursed right but the Bible says blessed is he that readeth or or he that Hearth and curs is he that'll add one thing or take one thing away from it there you are so you see the danger part don't add anything to it don't take it away just leave it just the way it is and you'll be blessed stay inside the word of God and you'll be blessed anything outside of that is cursed okay that that's as simple as what this whole thing is you don't need to be scared about it just saying okay Lord show me your word I I want to just live in your word and and the Lord will bless you no matter what it comes out at that's why Hannah you know she said Lord I I I just love you I just want to have an offspring for you and she got given Samuel and this and Michael I don't know why I put this in there but just a contrast she laughed at David and look at them and she could never have children they they one got Offspring one didn't just and based on what they did here that's why I say this stay with the word of God and you'll be blessed in this world and the next it's it but it's very easy it's not like oh if I do one little thing but then every little thing does matter as well okay CU I don't want to say oh you can just do little things that doesn't matter no it all matters but just be diligent just just stay with the word of God God will correct you if you're wrong yeah go with it if you know you're wrong just take it yep I was wrong didn't realize I did that but the Lord showed me I was wrong I take it cuz he doesn't want you to keep doing it he says look I want to bless you I want to correct you so you get blessed that's why I correct you then you live in that new way and you get blessed okay can you give me five minutes to just can I just talk about this for five minutes to my brother Joel because he committed suicide a week and a half ago and and and now I have to apply this this sermon this thought has got to work I I have to apply it to to my own life you know it's it's it's got to have substance to it you know it like cuz this affects this you know like the concepts of this affect him because many people say well if you commit suicide you're you're done you're gone you know but according to what I just looked at it's not the case right that's not the case that he didn't commit the unforgivable sin right and but I'll say this my brother Joel he he he and I had the experience with the Lord when we were 14 15 where we were healed instantly of the we were on drugs and I never liked it he always got into it I never did I was following along with him and we were healed instantly from being higher on drugs and we went like that the spirit of God came in after we prayed he experienced that with me and and of all the people in the family we got 10 brothers and sisters it's been my self that's really gone on with the Lord and and Joel has always loved the Lord now he's lived the most failure curse Rd life you'd ever see but he was the only one that always loved the Lord in his heart he always did he always was concerned about the Lord and every time he was living in sin he would hate it he would always be disappointed in his heart now but but I'll be honest with you and say like I saw in Joel uh he my father said look he always loved the Lord because anytime you talk to him for a while the conversation would always end up to be about the Lord he said because that was the most important thing in his life but if you looked at his life that he lived here you it was hard to reconcile the two together because he lived such a cursed life he just had such a hard time uh doing right now why I say that is because with Joel if he was going to serve the Lord he had to be 100% or nothing it was 100% And if he ever slipped up at all he was so disappointed with himself and then the devil would PL him and say oh look at you you're a failure you can't do it and then he would slip back to his old ways oh well M just go up and then he would drink and sleep with woman do all sorts of stuff and then his life would be cursed like he wouldn't believe and then he'd get so sick of that he'd say I just can't live like this Lord forgive me I want to serve you Lord you know my heart I want to and he would come back and then the minute he would come back the Lord was right there to go and put it all back together as much as what he could cuz you know if he had done things he he'd put it all back together as much as what he could all right here you go and he would do the cycle again and he and then he would go on he'd be on a mountain top and try but but when he couldn't attain to Perfection which was what he always wanted I just want to live exactly right now then he would do it again now we're not talking like we backslide you know my we you might say well I last week um I don't want to make light of it but I I watch something on YouTube that I shouldn't watch I watch someone punching someone else or something like let's say you know and you felt convicted about that I'm not saying there's differences in s but Joel's thing wasn't oh I watched something on YouTube it was like I'm sleeping with all sorts of women going out there all sorts of just horrendous things you know but I believe the sin question was settled in his heart and and he was in his life that I knew him like I mean I knew my whole life but in his Christian walk it was if you look back over his 25 years he was in and out about 20 30 times but every time he came back to the Lord the Lord would always try and would always pick up the pieces for him I feel like I've lost the train of thought but that's what I was going to say and we would always try and tell John no doubt brother be probably did too look if you failed don't worry about it don't worry just forgive let the Lord forgive you and just move on don't just give up everything don't don't you know that was it was always the same he said everyone would tell him don't worry don't take it so just just yet walk on but he felt like no I can't do that cuz that shows I don't care that I failed I just want to be perfect and that's what the Lord deserves of me but he could never attain to the the bar that he set for himself and and he's a unique case because he also did a lot of drugs and everything so you know he's having trouble comprehending everything and it's and the more drugs than that that he did as he went on the more harder it became but you even witnessed it that's why it didn't surprise me when he when he found out when he was going to live at the factory it didn't surprise me that everything just went back to back like the Lord lined it up so he could be there and everything fell into place for him it didn't surprise me at all because that's the way Joel I'd always seen it because he had such a pure heart every time he did Sin he hated it he never sinned and was like how I'm happy doing this it was like if he peeled back the layer in his heart he thought Lord I just hate living like this I want to be perfect and you know he he you can just see as his life went on the state he ended up having to live him was he he couldn't live this where he wanted to but then he didn't want to live there either and as his life went on it just got you know I thought man this man this man is having a terrible existence but as but to a degree we need' to go bad his life was so cursed just but then we need serve God God would put it all back together and you know it turns out that the opportunity that he had to to come here and to do all that was I would say it's last opportunity here on Earth you know cuz the Lord lined up he was going to be living at the factory he had a job there the the police said he could come here for church everything was just lining up but he just at that point Satan got him and just turned him and I couldn't do anything to get him back he just was going that way and then now I'm not saying it's last opportunity like he's lost I'm saying I don't know God and I don't know exactly know the ways of God but you know anyone you we if any rugby people that watch rugby you know when Japan used to tour in the 1995 you know they're still hopeless but back then they were hopeless even worse you know and the All Blacks would play them and you know they' just get a total thrashing you know the Japanese would put up a good fight but just get thrashed you know and I do remember one all black Captain Shan Fitzpatrick the game had about 10 minutes to go and we were like 95 nil or something you know and when they scored the the we scored a try and it was then the next try would have got us over 100 points and and the the um the captain of the All Blacks he just said look we call the game off he said let's save these guys a humiliation of 100 points let call the game off and he told the ri game's over now I don't know that that that's what happened but but but at a certain point with this man it was just you know I think in himself he was like look it's been 43 years and I still can't even get this right look at the opportunity I had with Isaac look at what i' done and I still missed one up that's Satan telling him you know does that make sense you put yourself in that but I knew Joel and a when he was there and Bruce going ATT test that when he when he first came and you put him in prison what's the first thing he does start serving God cuz all those things are push back for a moment if you see I always thought if you took all the sin everything away from the world Joel would just be loving the Lord like but all this other stuff when it came and he didn't have enough power to resist it he'd go here and there and as many people has tried over the years it just he just continually was like that but in his heart he loved the Lord he really did and when he first turned up there man it was like it was like I was having Jesus in that side room CU there was such an anointing on him like you talk to him and he he was in such a place cuz that he just wanted it was all or nothing and it always Marvels you know when I you said Lord what shall I do now I'm here Lord living in this little room at the factory there what should I do Lord what should I do when I'm here thinking he's going to do some great thing the Lord said to him paint cuz I need to painting done he said that's what the Lord told me to paint so but you can imagine if I could bring if I could bring this like you know even in this situation we're more than conquerors like I saw I witnessed on that day when when we took his body out of the the bush I just I I and we experienced God doing something it was so unique you'd think well that's a pretty um uh shameful situation there's a man hanging up there in the bush by a rope dead and you're dragging him out and you're thinking that's God you're thinking God's doing something great but you see we've got to know we when you know God you can see even in that he still doesn't let Satan win even in that you know like like if I could just recount the day a little bit we the day before he hadd been gone for a week no one had heard from him we didn't know where he was and then the the day before that they' found his car smashed um up in the bush so so up to that point no one knew where he was cuz his phone was off and then the Poli because my sister ailed a missing person's report then when they found the car they said Oh okay that's linked to Joel and they told her we found his car up there in the bush that had been about a week from when we hadn't seen him to when he found we found his car that was a Tuesday night and my brother I got a brother in gizor a couple of Brothers in Gisborne something came over him he just got back from a weekl long camping trip around w c Moana and he got back there and something came over him he said I'm want to go there and find him so he said I'm leaving first thing in the morning we didn't know you know it was just an assuming maybe Something's Happened to him we don't know but so so he hopped in the car the next morning and drove my other sister from down south was already coming up here for a family event so she was already in Wellington and and then now admittedly me being me I thought man I I I'm going to be honest I thought you know I I do want to find him but Joel's done this before he goes on Benders and he he he pops up after a couple of days you know so I'm like he could be on a bender you know I'm not the sort of guy that gets too worked up over it not not worked up but caught up in the drama of it and if I was honest I thought but I can't really I live an hour away you know these guys are driving 8 hours nine hours I can't be the guy that didn't even bother going lives an hour away okay that was that was my motivating factor if I was honest because I thought he'd probably show up somewhere but then I thought there's a high chance he could be dead I'm not sure but I love my brother I don't want to S like I don't love him but it was just and then so I turned up at 1:30 before they did they turn no one knew if there was a search party happening or nothing was happening no one knew anything it was just the random things and N was going to turn up and then my brothers and so we tune up at 1:30 we have a bit of a look around but on the hour every hour people started tuning up that were un booked unplanned we turn up there for an hour we look have a bit of a walk around we couldn't find anything an hour later the police turn up no one knew they were coming they didn't know they were coming I just said oh it's just worked out that this way so they turned up at at 2:30 they said oh well yeah we just thought we'd come have a look and see what's going on and just you know cuz they'd found the van the day before so they tune up so we've been there for an hour they tune up and then and then they said oh and and and it just happens that um the there's a lady that does the voluntary search and rescue no the yeah and and she's actually a GP but she heard about this and she said look I'm going to go there today and look I'm going to get my dog and I'm going to turn up there today and look she said I'll be there at 3:30 she had all these appointments on but she said I've got a free day tomorrow so I'm just going to push all my appointments out to tomorrow go back home get my dog and come there I'll be there at 3:30 so we arrive 1:30 the police 2:30 she arrived 3:30 it was just no one planned anything it was just 1 2 3 and then they went into the bush and by 4:30 they were back out saying you know we've got sad news we we found him up in the bush there and and he was dead and something when I was driving down there from um the up in Levin I'll say the first natural but first I was thinking about death and I thought you know it's if he was dead I thought that's such a sad thing that a man dies alone you know no one buys beds so I thought it's such a you know it's a good thing with a man when he or woman when they die they got someone beside them that loved them that you know I love you and then they they go where where they go I don't know but still it's they should have people people beside them that love them so I had this thing on my heart I thought that's such a sad thing if he's up there and and there's no one beside him that loves him tells him that they loved him you know that he took his last breath in that situation I thought that's such a sad thing and and and and something was on come over me and I thought if they find him I want to go and see him and I want to go right beside him and tell him I love him if they find him cuz I thought that man's not going to die alone not going to die there alone in the bush and and when the lady said that they found him I said well can I go and see him they said uh no look it's like she said look it's a it's a crime scene now technically cuz he may have been murdered it's a crime scene we don't you know it's caught and off and you can't really go there and two you don't want to see that you know you're better better off to remember him the way it was I said look I want to see him I said no no no you can't maybe when the other Constable comes you can and but in my heart I thought I'm this day is not going to expire until I've been there before they take him down it just something was sitting there I I see the day had people had to play out things during the day you know and so it turned out that my brothers they we decided that they were all going to call different members of the family one was going to go and call my father one my mother one my sisters and that and just enclosing and they they all um then everyone had a phone call to make apart from me and I had to move my vehicle to move it down the road a bit so they could drive out cuz there was no reception we were was there to drive away and make a phone call but they so they drove away and I drove my vehicle down and all my family were gone cuz they didn't really want to sit my brothers that had a bit of a curse in his life too for a while they had his partner committed suicide he hadd seen someone on the Rope he said I don't want to see that again and my sister's that J said I I don't want to see that I'll never go in the bush again things like that you know they but there's something in me said I've got to someone's got to be there for him they all left and I walked back up the road to where the group of cars were and there was the new cable arrived and there were four four a group of four or five of them coming down and we met at the intersection where you go to the bush like where where you walk into the bush there and they were all going in there and I I I I just I saw the situation unfold as I was walking I thought this is because I'm supposed to go in there cuz they were walking down I met them right at the junction point and all my brothers and everyone was gone and I said look you've got to let me go you've got to let me in there that I just I was I had tears I said that man's not going to die alone in there it's not not going to happen and she she tried to talk and I just I talked again and she said Okay Y come in and it was it was the most outstanding experience from from from the moment I from when they said you should go on the moment I started walking I just felt such a powerful love come over my heart and you begin to understand the love of God that I knew that in there was my brother hanging on a rope in the bush in the disgraceful sight you know but yet love says I don't care where he is I don't care what he's done I'm going to go there and tell him that I love him I don't care what I see I don't care what he's done he's going to be loved in there in that state too and I thought about the love of God as I was walking that the redeeming love of God came down the same way to each one of us I don't care what they've done I don't care where they are I'm going to go and I'm going to get them out of whatever situation that it is I'm going to get them I'm to go and see them and wherever they are the the the the power that the the feeling that came on just as I was walking there you know and then I then I walked there in the in the through the bush and they said he's up over there and I could see his body swinging through the trees and I just I think can I go closer they say you can go right up there and I went up there and I stood there you know and I I saw that was my brother you know I saw this sounds funny but he's always had this arched back you know sounds more but he's in the tree and I saw was Arch back cuz he had a thing don't worry and I thought that's Joel there Joel Lee cuz I saw his arch back and I said I love you bro amen just want to say I love you you know like on behalf of the family or somebody was there somebody was there and and and then you know I said many tears because it is it's also him my brother you know but I said I love you man and and but in that spot someone was there and and when I had my time I said yeah thanks and I really appreciate it to the police I said look thank you so much for make for they thought it was probably going to go another way this guy's going to break down it's going to be but I said look thank you so much for letting me do that I really appreciate that just I was so thankful like you you don't know what that meant to me to say that that man didn't die alone and so I walked out we walked out and then then they had all the um stretches and that coming and they maybe an hour later he was out out of the Bush and it was like a it was like a you know when a fallen soldier comes in from overseas on a plane and then they have the the casket comes out of the plane and it sort of comes out like an honor the day felt like that it was like God saying I'm going to go there's going to be a procession a parade I'm going to go in there and get my sun out of the Bush and bring them out like this that's what it felt like like when we when we looked at this here they they here this here like these men I if you can see they they've got them on they're walking them out of the Bush and it's a somus site and they they're walking them up and they they bring them around and there's about five or six of them and they they put him up onto the the Hearst and we're around there and and the thing that spoke to me in the end was they put him in a white HST is a HST is it usually they're black they're always black right and I knew when I watched them drive away and that white one I knew that was from the Lord like the Lord's saying no no don't worry it's all right yeah he loved the cursed life when he was here yeah yeah he did but that didn't change what that didn't change the curse in his soul was not not there that wasn't there but but yeah the things he did caus this and then in the end I think the Lord said okay well to that devil CU he said to Job the devil came to to the Lord and said uh look at job I'm going to affect him he said okay you can affect him uh you can take all the stuff don't take his don't don't hurt him he did that then then he came back and wanted to do some more damage he said okay you can hurt him but don't take his life if Satan came back the third time and said can I take his life if God said yes then he could have taken his life how is it any different in this situ you know okay all right Joel that's cuz he was having so much taught hardship I want to say two more things about it when I was talking with my dad about it we were talking about it this is the day after and you know we were talking about how he just wanted Perfection and something came over me and thought came in like a like such a revelation and the Lord said as we were talking the Lord said to me he's got Perfection that he always wanted now amen I thought wow that's so powerful the one thing he always wanted which you could say caused all the trouble in his life all his trouble was because he just wanted Perfection when he couldn't reach it he was so disappointed and then the devil would mess with him and they try and go back and the one thing he wanted was to be perfect before the Lord I thought man he's got it he's perfect now before he's got what he always wanted didn't go in a glamorous way but the Lord made sure even out of the Bush he came and I want to say the last thing which the Lord has shown me a few things afterwards even why I went there you know it's so that this demon doesn't think he could have the last say you know the Lord wasn't about to let his son St out there in the bush and rot just fade away and like this demon there's no doubt when he was up there that demonic spirit of suicide that was hanging around like a mangy little stinking hyena hanging around its pray thinking look what I got you know I'm the king of the jungle this little mangy little demonic creature that it is that's reserved to the pits of Hell lurking around there do you know God was going to send himself in cuz I know who I am I know where I stand God sends himself into that ground to chase away that little stinking hyena stinking demon to say the lion of the tribe of Judas king of the jungle even in that situation God had the last life you get scat you little demon scat little pissy hyena and comes the lion of the tribe of Judah say right we're bringing them out of here even as bodies blessed even as bodies anointed it's still anointed it's like Elisha he he was dead for he died he was in a pit his bones were there and the man fell into the pit and he came back to life cuz he was anointed even his bones were anointed that man was an anointed Son of God that's why he says he's not going to leave there not going to be left up there on the bush to rot I don't care what sort of a life he's lived complete failure here and curs to smothering it doesn't matter his soul was free from the curse it was free get him out of the bush honorably bring him out honorably he's a Son of God it was such a powerful experience that's why people expect me to be sad I'm like how can I be I saw even in the darkest dire moments I see God moving and go to places where we don't want to go we don't want to go there see a man swinging on a road but God goes there says even in death I'm going to honor him he we can't lose amen we never lose serving God we can't lose we serve a powerful Living God and if we live inside his word we're blessed I don't care what it might what the situation might look like I don't care nothing we're blessed that's who we are today just live inside the word of God and we're blessed that's the god that we serve faithful powerful the lion of the tribe of Judah amen thank you for letting me I just wanted to because you've been such a big part of it I just wanted to so you knew so you didn't think Isaac looks like he doesn't care did you know just went through it like nothing it wasn't that it was just that God was I love my brother I love him to bits man but you know I know where he is now oh man he's probably in the B State than me you know but also know the love of God let's um sorry to take so much your time I appreciate your your listening let's um could we
