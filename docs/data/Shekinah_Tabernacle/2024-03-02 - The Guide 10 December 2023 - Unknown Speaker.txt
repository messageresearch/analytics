it's nice and warm on the inside here so amen so come up by the fire of the Holy Ghost and just rest while Amen Let the burdens go and let God live amen so um John 16 and from verse 7 it says here nevertheless I tell you the truth is expedient for you that I go away if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I'll send him unto you and when he has come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of Judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because I go to my father and you see me no more of judgment because the prince of this world is judged I have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he'll show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father hath of mine therefore said I that he shall uh take of mine and shall show it unto you amen just one more reading in Proverbs you don't need to turn to it uh but well familiar scripture here trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding and all thy ways ackowledge him and he shall direct thy paths amen amen let's bow heads in a word of prayer this morning if you want to be remember and pray you want to raise your hand to the Lord amen God bless you gracious father we're so thankful that we can come to the table of the Lord and truly Lord when we come to your table we never disappointed Lord we never go away empty Lord we never go away Lord any negative lord it's all positive Lord Jes Jesus and we're so thankful you've given us a place each and every one of us a place at your table to feast and dine oh God as one of your guests and we're so thankful that we have that place and we just want to ask Lord as we've read your great Eternal Word may you anoint it Lord anoint speaker and hearer one more time may you have your way in this service Lord we want to commit all that we are into your hands Lord we just ask that you would cover us in your blood and have your way today we thank you for this day that we can gather and we want to ask you'd be with those who couldn't be here today be their portion Lord touch their lives too we ask all these things Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning I want to um been listening to the sermon brother B preached about a guide and I really enjoyed that so I want to just just go into uh how he's our guide today and I trust he's your guide amen this morning now we know that man will man from from uh from the fall has has been his own guide where he decided that you know he'll take uh wisdom of of of the serpent above the word of God and so he's always been guiding guiding himself and we know that man man has been placed on free moral agency so you've got to choose the guide that guides you you know you can't just be you know God doesn't you know arrest you and mug you and force you to be led by him but you got to choose it in your own own self amen and now we know is Jesus said he'll guide you into all truth and we know that he's a personal guide he's not just a collective guide but but he wants to guide us personally and the only way that we can uh have him come into our lives and guide us is when he comes on the inside of us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then he becomes our guide now now there's things you know you got to have a qualified guide you know you can't just have any guide guiding you you got to have someone that knows the place you're going to go amen they they need to have detailed knowledge of where you're going to go you know it's more than just Googling a nice place and then saying you're a guide you got to be there experience it know the pfalls the dangers the troubles what to do when an emergency strikes to be a guide you've got to have these kind of qualifications you got to be calm when there's a time of distress you know you can't Panic like maybe everyone else is panicking if you're a guide you're calm anden you know the enemies or the dangers that are in those certain environments you know I remember when I was um you know when my parents lived up in Papa New Guinea and I decided to take a um in the monsoon season I decided to take a Twan hobiecat yacht Sailing by myself now I know how to sail in New Zealand but I've never been sailing in the monsoon season before and if I took a guide with me who actually knew what it's like to sail in the Mons you cuz the monsoon season it's it's it's Summit well it's the wet season it's this time of year it can be very still for most of the day and then it just starts blowing and then a lot of shipwrecks in the past happen in the monsoon season because it's a very you know it just happens very abruptly if you're not prepared you can you can sink you can capsize whatever more and I decided Well it's not very windy it's a nice day I'm going to go sailing now first mistake is I only went by myself in a Twan yacht you know you and and you you know this is fellowship we meant to be having us and God in a boat right but I decided to take my you know take this Twan yacht that you got to use harnesses on most of the time it's actually only your feet on the boat because you're hanging on a harness on the outside of it it's real fun you go fast and it's real fun you know but anyway I didn't have a harness and it was only by myself and it was a monsoon season now now if I if I was experienced sailing in those kind of conditions I'd know when the first gust comes starts coming along the bay I've got to get back into Shore because if I don't start heating back into Shore those gusts are going to get closer together then it's really going to blow and I'm going to capsize and that's exactly what happened so the first gust came and you know see I wasn't qualified or experienced to sail in the monsoons but I know what it's like to sail in Gusty conditions you know gust is like there's a bit of wind there's a you know burst of wind comes through then the wind dies down then it comes back again you know and you can watch it come on the water coming towards you but then what happened is in those conditions as the first gust came well I just enjoyed the ride then the second gust came and the third and they started running closer and closer together so it started blowing and as soon as it did that now I saw it come coming on the water but I didn't have the way out of you know you know the way out and we can see trouble coming but if you don't have the guide with you how you going to get out of the trouble so when the wind really started blowing the the boat capsized on its side and I couldn't get it back over I you know I've had experience riding boats here you know remember sailing in Poverty Bay you know the boat I was going downwind the boat starts cartwheeling you you know you get spit out the front the thing goes flying forward and you got to swim after it and so I know what it's like to get a boat over but not that kind of a boat that kind in the monsoon season I couldn't get the thing over and I could only get it halfway over and I don't have a picture of it maybe I should have got one but you know there's a trampoline in the middle of the boat so if the boat's halfway up that thing acts as a sail and so I was being blown out to sea thankfully I was being blown to the opposite shore of the bay but if I was just a little bit further out I would have gone out to sea now there's no Coast Guard there there's no one to help you there but if I had a guide it would have been a a lot less dangerous but thankfully I got blown across the side of the bay got the boat over when it was shallow and enough and I said and I actually got towed back someone came to come and get me but you see if I had a guide they would have said this is a bad idea I know these Waters I know this environment I know these conditions you are setting yourself up to fail but the problem is I took my own what I thought I could do and then I went with it and I nearly ended up being washed out to seea you know and man has been its own guide from from the fall yeah God has always wanted to be the guide of man but man has always wanted to be his own guide and you see where that's LED man it's leading man to a nuclear war you know we think we have all the answers all the technology and man just makes more technology to kill each other and this is where the world is facing is because man has wanted to be his own guide but I'm so thankful that God has always wanted to be the guide of man he's always wanted to step on the scene because remember he knows what's coming he knows the environment far better than we ever know it amen he knows what the conditions of the age we're alive in amen he knows everything and he's placed his guide book here am right see he says that he will show you things to come so a guide doesn't just tell you what's happening he's going to tell you what's going to happen when you get there am mean you see a guide is not like a tourist that just reacts to things as they go along on a safari but they know exactly where they're going they know exactly where they're going to take you and they know what you're going to be showing and they know how to get out of there amen so I would want to if I wanted to go on a guided hunting trip or anything I'd take a good guide yeah I wouldn't take a guide that's just just like say for example going to South Africa I wouldn't take a guy that's just read the Loney Planet magazine on the way there you know I'd want someone who knows the nature of the animals who knows how to deal with the animals you know like who's ever seen those videos maybe I should have brought it but you know there's this there's this elephant Hunter and and and um I don't think it's on YouTube but anyway we were showing it when we were there Christine and I and he said an elephant always run and stand by something doesn't matter how small or big they run from a tree to a tree and chose the the nature of how they charge and if they're bluffing and if they're not and you know there was this this guy had this bull elephant literally come right up in front of the people but he knew exactly what he was doing he wasn't bluffing it wasn't a show he knew the danger of that animal he knew what it was capable of but he knew how to stop it in its tracks that's the kind of guy I would want if I'm walking in the Krueger I want that kind of a guy I don't want me with a YouTube channel looking about how to do things I want a guy who's experienced right and our lord Jesus is the most experience God there ever will be has been and can be amen because he knows everything he knows the hearts of all men he knows what's happening in the future he knows the hearts of our enemy he knows all things so I would I would have him as my guide amen I think he's the best guide to haveall amen so everyone who's ever been led by God has been Guided by him amen but you see the thing is the main thing we must do is always not lean to our own understanding you know cuz how many people been caught out in the bush even in this country and perish because they lean to their own understanding they took what they thought they needed they looked at the weather and thought well this is how it's going to be and they get trapped out there because they didn't take a guide they just went with their own understanding and I say this is the reason this world is facing nuclear war is because man has been leaning to its own understanding if I have enough bombs I can intimidate the other I can do what I want but there comes an end to that amen Napoleon came to his end he thought he could just you know defeat Europe and just move on but but but he was defeated Hitler was defeated all these different ones were defeated and I say this world has come to that same place once again man has not learned because why because man wants to be his own guide even with his all understanding and His science and his ability we cannot guide ourselves that's right amen we need him amen now a guide will if he's going to take you a place if he's a real guide he will take you to that place amen he won't take you somewhere else he won't take you to a place that you know which is near enough as good enough he'll take you exactly to that place now God God would speak to Abraham and he basically said to him I'm going to be your guide Abraham I'm going to take you from this country from your Kindred I'm going to take you to a land that I've given you now we know that Abraham ended up where his guide said he would end up right he didn't end up somewhere else he didn't end up in China he didn't end up down in India he didn't even end up in Turkey he ended up in the promised land amen so so our lord Jesus the real guide will will guide you exactly where he's meant to go you amen aren't you thankful for that amen now it's very important that we stay with our guide because he knows the future he's not surprised the world is in this condition we know the Bible prophesied as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the days of the son of man so as it was in Sodom and Gomorrah it's been repeated in this day he knew because the guide knows the terrain he knows the spirits that are going to come into the world he knows the trouble that's going to be here and he forewarns us of these things and say when you see this this is going to happen am mean so when you see Sodom and Gomorrah on the streets again and you know that the son of man's going to be revealed you know the Rapture is going to take place he said when you see the Fig Tre put forth its buds you know summer is nigh the millennium's coming and the Victory and prophecy we know is Israel and the Bible also says that when you the guide told us when you see all the all the world come against Israel it's going to be a cup of trembling you know Jerusalem's going to be a cup of trembling it was going to try and fix this Middle Eastern problem and no one can fix it and everyone's getting sick of the Jews and what they're doing and they just you know there's such anti-Semitism like there's never been but the guide told us it would be here am mean the guide told us there'll be 144,000 elect Jews that receed the same Jesus that you know right now amen and so the guide told us this he didn't say well I think it's going to happen he says I know it's going to happen amen so just like we're facing Christmas we know Jesus wasn't born 25th of December but you know the God said the messiah's going to be born and we'll come to that later and and where the people were told they'd find them they found them exactly there now I'm so thankful where the Lord said he said if you if you love me keep my Commandments and I'll pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that you may abide that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not uh neither knowth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I'll not leave you comfortless I will come to you says a promis that will never be comfortless we will never be alone Amen in this world where everyone is so discon connected even though it's such a strange thing where we we are the most connected generation in the history of man but yet mental illness and and depression and things are just on the Rampage and people are so disconnected in this day people feel so alone and So Unworthy but the Lord said I will not leave you alone I will not leave you come the see our guide never leaves us amen he doesn't send us in a way and just leaves us there but he's always with us amen it's so important to realize that your guide if you've really received the Lord Jesus Christ he is your guide and he'll never leave thee nor forsake thee it doesn't matter how you feel you know you can be out in the bush somewhere with the best guide you can feel wet you can feel tired you can feel even disorientated because you don't know where you are but if your gu's with you am mean you can have full confidence that he's going to lead you through what he's brought you to do he's going to take you out amen so he said I'll not leave you comfortless and this com this word comfortless it says to be bered of a father or um um of parent so so so this C says will not leave you without a parent I'll be your father I'll be your mother I'll be your parent I'll be your guide amen or or those bft of a teacher a guide or a guardian or to be orphaned so she says I'll not leave you orphaned amen I'll not leave you without a teacher or a guide because I'll be the these things to you amen if you just let him be your guide be your teacher amen be your guardian Hallelujah we have the best guide amen he doesn't go into elephant territory or lion territory without a gun that can down that thing that you know you know you know when it charges he knows exactly how to down that enemy amen amen so he said he'll not leave us comfortless in this in this age where where everyone is doing their own thing and and people think that you know there's no truth anymore he said I'm the way the truth and the life and me he said that I will show you these things if you call upon me if you seek me with all your heart you shall find me and I have never found someone who has genuinely sought him with all they heart not find him cuz there's a promise in the scripture I mean if it's Quicken to you I can find him you'll find amen I remember when I was at University about 21 years old and thinking you know I knew my what my life was going to be like I was going to be a professor of chemistry and climb the Ivory Tower this was my plan I was guiding myself making home brew in my flat doing all kinds of things but then he came my way and said you need a guide amen you think you know what you're doing but you don't know what you're doing you're just going around in circles thinking you're achieving something but I'm going to take you out of this darkness and bring you to Glorious light I will be your guide see it's not the condition we start in that matters amen this guy doesn't care where you come from what you're into just accept his call and say Yes Lord be my guide amen I'm so thankful he became my guide I've never regretted it amen never regretted it amen for a second because why he is such a good guide amen amen through trouble he guides me amen through confusing times he leads me amen when there's strife and trouble he calms me he comforts me he St izes me why cuz he says it's okay sure we may be amongst a pack of wolves but I know how to deal with the Wolves I know how to deal with these Spirits sure there's all things going on in the world unbelief on every hand but yet I'll lead you through sure there's Darkness amen the world is falling apart but you won't fall apart if you stay with me amen if you walk in my footsteps with me obey my voice you will not fall apart that's the kind of God we have Hallelujah if I start getting happy well I believe in a half out religion amen this is not some Mor of a religion of a you know we don't believe in religion here this is relationship with Jesus Christ the word amen but you see in order to in order to to Really stay with your guide you need the Same Spirit as the guide you know because because if you if you don't take the spirit of your guide you won't have confidence in him because you won't have the same thinking as him you'll start to think differently so when he says no this is okay and it looks like it's everything's about to explode you know then you'll then you'll start losing confidence in your guide because you'll start panicking because your trust is now because you think he doesn't have it all together so then you'll start to try and think now what can I do to save myself but you don't know what to do just like if I was in the bush and we're lost I've got a guide and he's not it's fine we got enough food this is how we survive blah blah blah you know all those things and I start panicking because I don't know what to do if I don't trust him I'll start making a Mad Dash oh it's that way and I'll be ending up going the opposite way that I should be going amen just like brother bramy he said when he was hunting you know he's on Hurricane Mountain and his you know he's actually there on his honeymoon or something with his wife and you know young son and he left them in a lean two up on a by a cabin because the cabin was locked couldn't get in he says I'm just going to go hunting he goes down the mountain you know then a blizzard comes in and then because he's hunting there he needs meat and all these things and then he starts to get worried because he can't see where he's going and then what happens is he's he's panicking because he knows he can look after himself he's a Woodsman he's a guide but his wife doesn't know how to even light a fire in the woods so so if that blizzard you know if he doesn't get back to them they're going to die so then he starts to panic he said you know and he tries all the tricks he knows to see which way North there's all these things that you know when he describes it about the bark on the tree I I have no idea you know I could put my hands in there said no it just feels like bark you know but yeah but you he's telling all these things about how to survive in the woods cuz he's an expert and he starts panicking and he realizes he can't get back he doesn't know how to get back to where that Hut is and then so he prays he says Lord you guide me and then he goes to the best of his knowledge he says I'm going this way and then as he was going that way he felt a hand on his back no one around and he turns around and he looks up and he sees there's actually a hole in the fog and he sees Hurricane Mountain is actually behind him so even with his ability of being a Woodsman his best ability he was going the wrong way and how many times we can lean to our own understanding and think this is the way we should go in life and it's actually the wrong way humanly it may might make sense it may add up and say yes this is the way but how many times it's actually contrary to the word of God and we're going the wrong way and then so he turned around he saw the gap of the fog to Hurricane Mountain where his wife and son were and then he began to try and try and get back up there and he knew that that the season before he had helped the ranger put actually a line a a a telephone line from down the mountain up the top of the mountain and knew if he could just find that wire then he could get to his wife and so he was walking along you blizzard everywhere trying to hold up his hands try and find this telephone wire can you imagine the impossibility you're on a mountain and there's one wire that gets you up to where your loved ones are but then he prayed he cried out to God and he was just walking on he see one hand like this for a bit and one hand like this for a bit then finally his hand touched the wire he was depending upon his guide to get him to the wire that would get him to his wife amen and I'm so thankful that that wire of of of the baptism of the Holy Ghost salvation amen we didn't find that WI that wire found you Hallelujah when I was lost in sin that wire found me see just hold on to this wire actually the wire holds on to you amen doesn't matter how bad life gets blizzards trouble unbelief comes in if you're holding on to that wire hold on to God's unchanging hand it'll lead you to safety amen yes sir Lord hallelujah praise the Lord so we don't want to panic in the woods amen we don't want to panic and Lady OA we want to be trusting Our God Amen now if we have the same Spirit as the guide it doesn't matter what comes in life sure we may get discouraged but we won't be cast down we may be persecuted but not destroyed as as um Stephanie was singing you know we may have all these troubles but yet we won't be down and out amen why because we have the same Spirit as the guide and if we have his Spirit then it doesn't matter what happens we will trust him through the trial amen amen like Caleb Caleb you know the Lord would say is you know they came back from um you know the Caleb and Joshua were part of the 12 Spies that went into the land and the 10 other spies gave an evil report but and then God said to um you know Cale but Caleb and Joshua said no we're more than able to take it why because they're walking with the guide they knew it doesn't matter what's going to come their way what's in their way the God's going to take them through but then but then the 10 spies Israel believed those 10 spies and then so so they said no we're not going to the promised land you just brought us out here to die and and how many times people lose confidence confidence in their guy thinking the GU just set them up to fail God hasn't set us up to fail people get angry and bitter at God say God you've abandoned me you've left me comfortless you don't care about me in the trial you've basically brought me out here to die if you trust him though you can't get better against him amen if you trust him if you not don't lean to your own understanding then he will see you through a amen so the reason Caleb could say no we're more than able to take the land is because he had another spirit with him and that's Spirit was the spirit of the guide amen and what happened he went and in the season took his possession took his Mountain amen where the guide said he was going to live he ended up Living Praise the Lord and you thankful for that see we got to have the same Spirit as the guide Amen brother says in a guide the guide has understanding how to go and what to do God has always sent a guide to his people God has never failed he sends a guide but you've got to accept that guide see you've got to believe it you've got to go the way way he says if you get into a Wilderness and your guide says we go this way and yet you think you go that way you're going to come up lost but then God sends a um sends us a guide to guide us we've got to follow that guide no matter what we think what looks reasonable what looks ridiculous we're not subject to divide that the guide is the only one amen now we got to we got to have the right guide that says the right thing the Bible says if a trumpet giv an uncertain sound who can prepare themselves for war so if the trumpet we know back in back in those days they would lead units by trumpets and drums and different things so so the trumpeter had to give a certain sound so the soldiers in the battle knew what to do for it was charge charge hold the line hold the line Retreat Retreat it had to be Specific Instructions he had to give a certain sound now the geese in Canada migrate from Canada then then it comes Autumn time they go down to Louisiana and then when it's and and then and then they go go back up to Canada when it's when it's the springtime up in Canada they have their have their little ones they have their goslings and they you know they um you know hatched out on the ponds there and things and then there'll be you know there'll come a season where the geese begin to swarm where there's a drake will get out on that pond and start honking and honking and honking and then all of the other geese rally behind that one and that and that Drake that's leading may have never got off that pond in its life but an instinct will guide it from there down to down to Louisiana to the rice fields when there's a winter time on see but the thing is what happens is there's there's been a bunch of geese that have have have swarmed a Drake has been honking and they swarm and they ended up in England so instead of going down to to to to you know the south of the United States they go ac across the Atlantic so not South but east and they end up in the wrong country so so what happened is is is that Drake was giving the wrong sound he said yes let's swarm but he wasn't the right kind of a guide because he didn't know where he was going he was making all the sounds all the Motions but he led them to the wrong destination see and then and then and then we're told that those geese could not get back from where they came from see that's why you've got to trust the guide you got to know the guide speaks according to the word I mean it's not about motions and you know excitement and all those things is it according to the word or not because if it's according to the word that's the right Drake to follow that's the right guide he will guide you into healing he'll guide you into Deliverance amen he'll guide you into the baptism of the Holy Ghost he'll guide you into the Peace of past all understanding he'll guide you to the destination that he says what he's honking about amen amen but if you have the wrong Drake it will become a wild goose chase cuz it's a wild goose leading the Chase and you'll end up in a place you thought well you said we're going this way why are we in England we're not in Louisiana where's the rice patties how do we get back he'll just go Hong Kong I don't know this is just how it is the days of Miracles are passed those things don't happen anymore this is just how we're going to live and this is just how it is that's the wrong Goose amen so we we but I'm so thankful we have the right kind of a drake amen the Holy Ghost is our is our Goose this is not a wild goose chase amen amen we can have testimony after testimony if we had a testimony service we'd say that Drake amen led me to peace led me to Salvation lead me to Deliverance lead me to the baptism of the Holy Ghost lead me to a piece of pass all understanding led me to Healing led me to every promise that he was honking about am he led me there Hallelujah I'm so thankful for that amen so let's not go I don't believe we're on a wild goose chase because our guide speaks according to the guide book amen If he if he speaks anything contrary to the guide book I would I I think he's a wild goose I wouldn't follow that guy you say have fun over in England I'm going to Louisiana right I'm going to where I meant to be going to we got to be sure that the guy that's guiding us now I'm talking about individually too right not just talking about the message or the word I'm talking about individually what goose are you following right we don't want to become a goose supper somewhere we want to be led where we're LED will dictate if we got The Right leader or not so which which direction is your life going to is it being led into the word of God are you becoming more like the Lord I think you've got The Right Drake right there if you're becoming more like him You've Got the Right Drake You've Got the Right leader but if you're going opposite to the word I think you're on a wild goose chase and they just go around in circles and they don't go anywhere I wouldn't follow that I would get a better a better guide than that amen amen see our guide will never speak contrary to the word of God because he is the word I mean now the compass is the Holy Spirit and your ti poost will be the North Star so the holy spirit will always point you towards the word the holy spirit will never lead you to anything else but the word of God so how could a man accept a Creed when it's contrary to the word now we know the word creed is basically just I believe this that's what a Creed is now if your Creed is is is contrary to the word I'd get rid of that Creed right but if but if you say well I believe such and such is it according to the scripture amen if it is well then that's good if it's not I would I would trade that real quick the holy spirit will never lead you to anything else but the word of God so how could a man accept a Creed when it's contrary to the word and then still say he has the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost would point you away from that it takes the holy Spirit to point you to the word for he is the word he is the word and it can only the magnet and the compass will only sit towards the North Pole that's the only way it can draw and when the Holy Spirit is the author and writer and the quickener of the word how can it point the person to anything else but the word amen so if he is the if he is the Drake that is the quickener of the word amen how can he point to anything else he can how can he say let's go to England instead I've got a better idea no God's first idea is the right idea amen praise the Lord but you see you see is when when a guide substitutes something like for example we're going on a we're going to go on Safari in Africa but then our guide takes us to um takes us to to to uh Scandinavia somewhere you think this guide has substitute of where we're going this is not the right guide the guide says we're going here but we're going here or if he says you know he say okay we're going to see some elephants they say no no those things don't exist anymore but no I've met people who have met who've seen elephants how can you say but he so he substituting something for something that's the wrong kind of a guide I mean when the original guide said that we're been restored back to an Apostolic Faith I mean back to a book of Acts Holy Ghost experience back to the realities of the promises of God but then someone comes along and says no the days of Miracles has passed those selling tiles haven't dropped yet okay just go like this if it they do okay and we'll pray for you you'll be fine it's just the wind this is Wellington so we don't need to worry about those things but you see if a if a guide comes along and says God don't do those things no more that's the wrong guide if a guide comes along and says well it was in brother Baron's Ministry the Miracles the signs the Wonders the manifestations of the Holy Ghost but God don't do those things anymore that's the wrong guide yeah amen cuz the right God will say he's the same yesterday today and forever and his promises are forever true amen it's the same thing with a new birth if if a guide says you've just got to receive the word intellectually can make a confession a statement of faith and then you're a Christian you got the Holy Ghost that's the wrong guide that's the wrong guide amen cuz it's a substitution of a handshake or just mental exception of a Doctrine to a new birth or from a new birth rather see a birth is a is an experience amen I don't believe there's any mother here who's given birth even by cesarian that doesn't know they haven't given birth amen amen amen why cuz they can see there's the baby here there's life here it was here now it's here amen there's a difference in the home there's a different life in the home amen Something's Happened yeah every birth is different but it yet it's a birth amen and our guide brings forth acts 238 youngans screaming shouting snotting boohoo and tongue speaking youngans that's that's the way he first brought forth birth that's the way he'll bring spiritual birth today amen so we don't want to swap see it's not a style or put on or Declaration of Creeds it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's the secret of the real believing church is B again see it brings life I'm just reading a bit from the bottom of that there see it doesn't matter where the birth happens it's a mess but you going to be willing to get messy amen amen you got to be willing to get messy you can't hold it oh we got to keep our composure because we're dignified you know you think about I wish we had video of of the upper room and them acting like drunk people I've seen drunk people actually I've been drunk on the spirit so I know what it's like staggering around shouting crying rejoicing wave after wave of the Holy Ghost ghost drunk as drunk can be but none of the perverseness of it amen so you know they weren't all like you see photos or things of the day of Pentecost and they're all like refined saintly and Serene they weren't like that they were shouting they didn't care they were jabbering they were they were stammering staggering Hallelujah they didn't care what people were thinking that were in a great time why because the guide said this is prophecy and you're going to fulfill the prophecy you go here I'm going to fulfill this the GU they followed the gu's instructions and they received what the guide said would happen am praise God and we have that same guide guide today amen he's no different amen because a guide when he comes what he tells you you will find you find amen so when the Shepherds were there outside Bethlehem the Angels appeared to appeared and and the angel said that you will find the Savior the Messiah of the world has been born in your village in your city amen and you'll find him wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a Manger amen so they so they heard the voice of the Angel right they received that word of the Angel and where the angel said they would find the Messiah they found him they didn't find him in a palace they didn't find him in a in a house they didn't find him where the angel didn't say they would find him amen they found him exactly in the manger wrapped and swallen clothes exactly why because the voice of the Angel was a true guide amen and because those Shepherds amen because they they were willing to be guided anywhere they'd be guided you see see imagine if this Angel appeared to all the fine priests all their fine robes and everything and said you'll find your messiah in a stinking stable in a Manger do you think they'd want to go in there they wouldn't be willing to go guided in there because the slippers will get mcky they may step in in some cow dung or you know slip on something in the stench oh that's horrible they would never put up with that kind of thing they would never be willing to be guided to where the angel told them the Messiah would be but I'm so thankful that we can surrender to the guide amen and where he said you'll find Messiah you find him Hallelujah just like we we've had the seventh angel messenger in this day amen God's reflected through him as our guide right the Holy Ghost through him and he said where you find the baptism of the Holy Ghost you find it who's had the experience amen he didn't he did not lead us to anything else he led us into the word of God the Simplicity of you repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen and if you follow the instructions of that guide you will receive what the God said you will receive that's right amen so so they found the they found the Christ child exactly where the angel said praise the Lord if they didn't find if that if that uh manger was empty if it was anything contrary to what the angel said that wasn't a real guide amen I know I'm kind of emphasizing this but I want you to see we have a real guide cuz what he said you'll find he'll guide you straight to it and there it is amen and there was there was another group who were who were looking for a guide they had the guide book but they needed the guide to come on the scene and show them where the Messiah would be because they were reading the guide book and the guide book said that their star would rise out of Jacob that these were the wise men that were in the East they were studying the stars and all these things brother Braham says that they were taught all their wisdom by Daniel you know their forbears were and then finally they saw a different kind of star in the heavens and they consulted the guide book so it's so important when you see things happen in the world consult the guide book I mean you know this message is more up to date that when it was first preached it is it is Front Page News amen amenl so so they consulted the guide book and then so they got on their camels and they followed that star because they were under expectation this is a true guide cuz it's a scriptural sign and they followed that they followed that sign all the way to the promis land but the problem is they only consulted one part of the guide book because when they ended up when they ended up in um when they ended up in Israel they didn't go to Bethlehem they went to Jerusalem now isn't it amazing I mean humanly that would make sense because they're going to the center of the of the Jewish religion Jerusalem the temple was there the high priest was there all all those things were there so so that makes sense logically right if you want to find out anything about the guide book and being guided you'd go to the authority in the land You' think but isn't it amazing that that here they come into Jerusalem and said where is he born King of the Jews we have seen a star in the east and we have come to worship him so in other words we've read the guide book we've seen the sign of the guide in the heavens and he's going to lead us to the Messiah on the earth we want to worship him we're following this guide and then it says and when Herod the king heard these things he was in Jubilation and all Jerusalem with him because the guide was true no he was troubled these guys turn up they're crying these things they're under expectation they're excited we're going to see Messiah I mean prophecy is being fulfilled in our day I want to be part of it I want to see it amen and then they come in and everyone's like what are these guys talking about they've been on their camel too long they've turned wrong somewhere and you would think that they would the ones they came to speak to would know more about it than the wise men but what happened is is Jerusalem forgot the guide they had got so caught up in their churchianity and their religion they had forgotten the guide and so when when people were Guided by the guide to them they were troubled they weren't rejoicing see we must be very careful we don't just get caught up in a message religion of a of a of of a church way of doing things we've got to stick with the word of God Amen we can't compare ourselves to each other and say well I'm right you're got to compare yourself to the word of God Amen you got to stick with your guide yes sir amen so they were all trouble do you see but it's amazing cuz when they when they went into Jerusalem there's no record that the star they could see the star when they went into Jerusalem so these ones who didn't know the guide actually had an influence that clouded the guide from the wise men but then when they were told go to Bethlehem and you'll find the child it says and when they heard the King this is in verse n here they departed and lo the star which they saw in the East went before them so they left these people who had no idea about the guide they but yet they following the guide book again and then they saw the star again that's why it's so important don't just take one scripture and run off with it take the whole revelation of the word I mean take the whole guide book amen and then he will he will guide you to where he wants you to go praise God the Lord see and then they you know and then they came then they followed the star and when they saw the star they Rejoice with exceeding great joy why cuz that guide LED them straight to the Messiah but in their human understanding they got they got uh deviated off the path of the guide by going to where they think they'd get the right advice from how careful it is that we don't go on the internet ask an AI chatbot for the right directions you know or our social media or you know but oh but in the multitude of counselors there is safety you got to be careful those counselors no God right you've got to have an individual leadership of this guide am mean it's not it's it's not public opinion that that causes us to believe what we believe it's not whatever is trending in society and think no we stick with the guide book I mean because the guide will vindicate the guide book amen he will manifest the guide book praise the Lord amen now praise the Lord aren't you glad he's your guide I pray he is amen you see we all needed a guide we all need a guide I mean Cornelius was an honorable man there's there's in Acts I think chapter 10 he was a great man honorable man he built churches he was devout he prayed and you know you he was a gentile that became a believer in the Jewish religion but then an angel of God came to him and said you know your prayers and arms will come up before God but now go get Peter because he's going to show you the way of eternal life see Cornelius needed a guide didn't matter how devout he was those things were all good but that's not going to guide you from this world to the next World see see we have a guide you think about it our guide has been he said I come from God I go back to God Amen he knows where we're going cuz he's been there he came from there he's you know amen so so Cornelius needed a guide see so God sent him the Holy Ghost he sent it in the person of Peter see it's so important that we are surrendered to the guide because Peter was a Jew he would have nothing to do with the Gentiles so he was even questioning the leadership of the guide right God had to deal with them even before the men came from Cornelius to get him from Jer about you know the Sheep came down with all the unclean animal like three times and said slay and eat Peter and so God had to deal with him to get him in condition to be led because the season was changing the the the kingdom was opening to the Gentiles at this stage so he sent so so Cornelius needed a guide God sent him the Holy Ghost he sent it in the person of Peter for while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on him God used the guide through Peter he used it because he guided cornelus to the right way and while he is yet speaking the Holy Ghost fell on them Gentiles then he said can a man forbid water that they should not be baptized see still the guide speaking not Peter because it was a bunch of Gentiles unclean dirty to him and he didn't even want to go so when Peter was preaching it was the god preaching see the God wants to put on flesh amen and and manifest his word but the guide said I'm sending you you do these things that you don't think you would do when the guide gets complete control when you let him guide you oh how wonderful it is to be led by the Holy Spirit he is the god amen so when we let him get completely in control then he can guide us when we fully trust him then he can guide us when we surrender to him then he can guide us all right he spoke through Peter and told him what he must do then when they had all received the Holy Ghost said we can't forb water sing these have received the Holy Ghost like we did at the beginning and they baptized him in the name of the Lord Jesus now who led him to do that the guide that was in him didn't Jesus tell them take no thought of what you're going to say because it's not you that's speaking it's the father that dwelleth in you he doeth the speaking amen amen and so God so he has always been the Holy Ghost has always been God's guide right he's always been God's guide I know this is probably very Elementary but he's always been God's guide I'm so thankful we have the guide I trust you have the guide today amen you see the guide God is obligated to his word so the guide is obligated to the guide book right if you follow the guide in the guide book he will manifest the promise of the Bible which is the guide book amen says the holy ghost that gave the promise and he knows everything about it now you look at you look how ridiculous it is when when people look at people who are being guided they think it is ridiculous here is Simon or Simeon rather in the temple he's an old man and the Holy Ghost reveals to him he will not die till he sees the Lord's Christ and so he begins to Rejoice why because the guide has come to him and said this is where I'm going to guide you Simeon before you die you going to see the Messiah and no doubt he would have be to testify this to many people but everyone who wasn't Guided by the same God guide probably thought he's an old silly man he's been he's been reading the Bible in the temple too long he's just you know had a funny thought but it wasn't a funny thought because when Mary and Joseph brought the Messiah brought Jesus into the temple God told Simeon now get up now start walking and and in that line of wom where where all the babies come to be dedicated the guide led him straight to the Messiah amen I'm so thankful doesn't matter what's going on in life you just stay with the guide amen and he'll lead you right Amen to where he wants you to go and he'll never lead you outside of his word now what but what happens with the guide is sometimes we got to wake him up here was Jesus with the with the uh disciples on the Sea of Galilee he had just had a big meeting healing people and different things and he was tired and he got in the back of the boat and that because he said we're going to cross to the other side now here they were the disciples were were were testifying of what the guide had done and they were roaring across the sea and you know the devil thought well here's Jesus he had a low point I'm going to drown him all the disciples I'm going to I'm going to end this Holy Ghost move right now and so he began to get into the wind and the waves and the Sea and and and and he stirred up all that trouble and because the because the disciples were expert fishermen they thought we can get through this we are the guide yeah they weren't the master of the wind they weren't the master of the wind they they were literally probably raised on that sea they knew exactly every every facet of it all the different things but yet they came to a point where they realized they needed the god to wake up now Jesus Jesus knew what they would face but sometimes Jesus puts us through a test to see what our reaction is going to be cuz he doesn't make us robots so what are we going to do in time of trouble are we going to waken the guide or are we going to try and sort it out ourselves you see when the first gust Came Upon the Sea of Galilee they they they probably should have woken them up but they thought no we can handle this we know what we're doing see it's when we get to that point where we're out of our depth that's when God can step in when we think we know what we can sort this out we can manipulate the situation we talk a certain way and you know you talk them talk someone round or whatever yeah we can deal with the whole thing if we think we can do it then the storm's going to keep blowing it may be because you think about maybe they filled the sails in maybe they started rowing a bit differently we can manage this storm we can manage this crisis in the home we can manage this thing at work we can because we know what we're doing but they should have just awoken the master they should have awoken the guide amen because because they woke him up saying Master don't you care that we perish in other words listen you've told us to go this way you're our guide don't you care aren't you going to look after us in this time of trouble why didn't they just wake him up earlier this is what they should have done they should have woken up their guide because remember their guide made the sea he he made the wind he made he made the atmosphere he made this world he made the universe and all he did was wake up say peace be still and it became a dead calm but they had to wake up they had to waken up the guide now brother Braham says that if Jesus is in your ship and there's trouble you've got to wake him up I mean you got to call him out of History you can't just try and go on in life and say well I experienced 20 30 years ago you know and just leave him back there and I'm just going to walk through life because I know the word all these things now you need the guide of the word to come on the scene you got to awaken him brother says in multiple sermons you got to he's in our ship but you got to wake him up I mean you got to St you got your faith has got to call them on the scene I mean got to get sometimes but the thing is they had to get desperate enough to wake him up right if they weren't desperate enough they would never have woken him up right so you got to get desperate enough how much do you want to come on the scene see they had to swallow their pride see Peter had to come to a stage I'm not a Boatman I'm not a sailor just like me and Papa in your guinea I'm not a sailor I thought I was but I'm not one amen and this is what we got got to come to in life metime going to realize actually I can't do this I can't I think I know what I'm doing but that's it that's my problem I think I know what I'm doing I mean I'm leaning to my own understanding amen but if you let God come on the scene you got to wake him up amen don't let him sleep in your mean he wants he knew they were going to go into a storm he knows what you're going to go into or what you're in so why don't you just wake him up call them on the scene this morning say Lord don't you care that I'm going to perish they weren't going to drown but they had to wake him up see God we have to call him on the scene the Lord he doesn't force himself upon us we have to be willing guide take over I'm just a tourist I don't know what I'm doing take over guide and the sooner we do that the better in every situation am mean you got trouble in school call on the guide you got trouble in your home call on the guide wake them up and you got trouble on your job call them on the scene amen wherever you have trouble call them on the scene say Lord I cannot fix this I've tried I I I've thought about I've strategized on all all kinds of things it just blows back in my face it just gets worse the gust come it's even worse so Lord I need to call you on the scene this morning and what happened he got them on the other side cuz he's the guide there's a lot of winds blowing in this world cold doctrines Darkness unbelief lukewarmness everything's blowing we're living in a storm of an age but God says we're going to get to the other side get to the other side there's going to be a resurrection of the Dead amen we're going to we're going to get to the other side if he's in your ship wake him up if he's not in your ship invite him into the ship amen let him be your guide today amen and you'll be able to look back and say just like brother B here said he's been my gu guide through life he's guided me unto life he is the one that led me to life and he is my life without him I have no life without him I want nothing else without him I want nothing else he's my all and all in the hours of my trouble he stands by me yesterday he blessed me today they done the same what can I expect the same forever praise His name amen yes sir he promised it he'll do it he is my life he's my guide my all all I've trusted him I've had some hard trials I trust him wherever I go I want you to do it if you go to wash your woman trust him if you go downtown trust him wherever you go just trust him trust your guide because God wants to walk with you more than you want to walk with him remember he's been waiting since the beginning of time of before and to walk with you amen this is this is his whole heart desire I want to know my children I want to love them I want to reveal myself to them I want to display my attributes to them I want to make memories with them I want to have experiences with them that's what I want that's what our guide wants our guide wants to walk with you more than you want the guide amen you know brother Brown would would would be in Colorado and he's there there's a blizzard comes and he tells the other people huning with them as soon as the first snowflake Falls you get to Camp as quick as you can because there'll be just a few moments to just be a complete white out and then and then the blizzard comes in and then he begins his way back down to Camp then he hears a voice I'm the Creator who made all things won't you come walk with me and then and then and then brother R turns around and walks back up into the storm because he knew it was God speaking to him and God said to him speak what you will and it'll be so and he says he says storm you move back we're going to have three or four days of I can't remember the exact days you know of of perfect weather to finish this hunt and he spoke that and the blizzard moved back it was it beautiful weather for that time and they finished their hunt and then when that was all done he say I picked up my gun wiped off the scope started walk back down the hill and something said to me why don't you stroll with me through this wilderness walk with me see God didn't just want to display his power and show the power of the spoken word God was calling his Prophet to walk with him and that's what God is calling you to do won't you walk through this Wilderness of This World With Me am mean won't you take a stroll with me that's what the guide wants that's what he's that's all he's interested in he wants to walk with you amen he says yes Lord with all my heart it would be one of the greatest things I could do was walk with you so I put my gun over my shoulder I started walking down through that never ax lated virgin Timber walking through there hallelujah amen see he says as I did walked along walked along these game Trails I felt like I believe I could go up to the place yesterday was our anniversary I'll just stand there a few minutes with and just give little meter a salute at where it's been a bunch of quaking as down on that little knob see what happens is when the guide comes your way you feel love towards your family see the guide came his way he says I'm just going to praise you Lord for my wife she's wonderful see you want to feel close to your family love everybody stay close to the guide that's right amen you feel all stickers and and and and and what do you call it you know criticism and all these things and nothing's right and everything's wrong I say where's your guide gone remember the guide doesn't leave you we leave the guide that's why I got to come back and walk with the guide amen I believe so I'm going to finish soon he says I believe I'll walk up there just salute our anniversary then I'll go go back down on this other side in these dark Timbers walk around and go around over towards the coral Peaks and come down that way just walking rejoicing I was saying father I know you're walking with me and what a privilege there's nobody greater I could be walking with the very God and that warm sunshine amen you're walking with the guide It's sun it's sunny it can be blowing a gale in the natural but in the spiritual oh it's just tropical and good hallelujah amen so whatever you do walk with the guide walk with God I'm just going to finish with this quote one of my favorite ones I know it's Christine's as well but uh but I love it because it's so true listen I'm going to say something look faith is unconscious amen you believe it if you believe in your guide It's a subconscious thing it's not a conscious yes Lord I believe yeah all that's good but it's down in here amen when trouble strikes and you really believe him that's when it really shows amen I've learned that in the years of travel around the world meeting the peoples of all different walks by faith but faith is unconscious you've got faith you don't know that's right Jesus Christ no matter if he was in a storm and the g was knocking the boat from one side to the other was he standing in a face of mess of demons if he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he walked right on just as calm as quiet as could be why he was simply unconscious of fear or anything around him that's right whatever it was going to happen whether it wasn't going to happen he knowed it was going to happen because God said so he didn't he didn't say oh have I prayed through wonder if I fasted long enough wonder if I did this he just walked right on unconscious that's right he believed what God said was the truth the word must be fulfilled and he know what his life was to fulfill them that's right and you're here to fulfill it too just walk unconscious of fear walk with your guide walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious unto the world walk as you walk with Christ walk with him not paying any attention the right or left hand just keep walking on if something comes up in the church walk with your guide amen hallelujah if sickness strikes you walk with your guide if the neighbor don't like you walk with your guide just keep walking on with your guide Enoch one day walked like that you know what he done he walked all the way home with his guide got so far up the road he didn't want to come back anymore amen and brother BR says you go through Bri patches troubles and valleys but just keep walking on with God when he guides you all the way home it will seem so little all these things when you get to the end of the way amen because our guide said I've gone to prepare a place for you and if I prepared a place you I'll come again and receive you unto myself that where I am you shall
