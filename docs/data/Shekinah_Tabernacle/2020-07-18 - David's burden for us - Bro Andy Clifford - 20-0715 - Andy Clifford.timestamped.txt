[0:02] [Music]
[0:05] amen do you believe that
[0:07] can you believe that oh glory
[0:11] well saints you can have your seat i see
[0:14] we've got do we have a testimony of
[0:16] sister belinda
[0:18] [Music]
[0:28] amen
[0:38] um that you've offered up and i'm
[0:40] thankful to the lord for answering every
[0:42] single one of them and
[0:44] it's just been so amazing um because my
[0:46] husband's sister passed away last week
[0:49] and i was just and i didn't think of
[0:52] going at all there was just too many
[0:54] things why i shouldn't be going
[0:56] and then i thought um well we pray about
[0:59] it and
[0:59] i put out the prayer requests and i know
[1:02] it was the prayers you know
[1:04] of everyone and also those that came
[1:07] i just want to thank everybody those
[1:09] that came to say
[1:10] you know came along to our house to
[1:12] visit
[1:14] those that gave freely
[1:17] i just want to say thank you everybody
[1:20] and
[1:21] just wanted to give it to sorry i get
[1:23] nervous and all that sorry
[1:25] but just wanted to say it's quite it's
[1:28] not always
[1:28] easy going on to these murals you know
[1:31] and i've been
[1:32] for 15 years now in this country and i
[1:35] went to several
[1:36] marae's over the years and there's quite
[1:39] a protocol to follow
[1:41] and it's a lot of um as i say it's like
[1:43] a lot of spirits you can be dealing with
[1:45] as well
[1:46] so i just wasn't sure if i'm up to it
[1:49] you know
[1:50] so that's why i say thank you for the
[1:53] prayers because it went really really
[1:54] well you know the lord was really good
[1:57] and even the traveling there
[2:01] when we got to taihape we just thought
[2:02] we'll stop for a quick
[2:04] quick stop there at a cafe and i'm glad
[2:08] i'm glad we did because there was a
[2:10] truck accident just in front of us
[2:12] basically so the road was closed and we
[2:14] just had our lunch
[2:16] and then by the time we came out there
[2:17] was a lot of cars blocked up
[2:19] and we're just like oh where can we go
[2:22] so that just
[2:22] look we went a side road and it actually
[2:25] said the road is closed
[2:27] but there was nobody and we just said
[2:28] we'll just keep on driving
[2:30] so we drove all the way up and the road
[2:32] was not closed it was all the way
[2:34] open there was only one car that came
[2:36] came towards us and there was it
[2:39] so we went all the way up there and then
[2:42] we got to where the desert road starts
[2:44] and that was supposed to be closed
[2:46] because of all the snow
[2:47] and it opened three minutes before we
[2:49] got there it was an update
[2:51] saying the road is open so like praise
[2:53] the lord you know
[2:55] so that was amazing and um and then we
[2:58] got there
[3:00] on the day we got there was the day of
[3:02] already where the
[3:04] because it goes over several days those
[3:06] funerals and it was the actual day for
[3:08] the service
[3:09] the coffin was already closed because
[3:11] she decided not to be embalmed so
[3:13] you can only keep it open for so long so
[3:16] when we got there
[3:18] the protocol on this mother was all the
[3:20] females go first
[3:22] so i couldn't actually go together with
[3:24] my husband and so i had to just go
[3:26] with all the other ladies then you have
[3:28] to wait until they call
[3:30] and whether they allow you to come on
[3:32] and all that so the coffin was placed
[3:34] outside and
[3:35] i just walked up there behind these
[3:37] other ladies we were allowed to go
[3:39] so i just thought okay i'll just say
[3:42] hello to the people and greet them
[3:45] and i didn't realize that all the group
[3:47] basically already went to the left-hand
[3:48] side
[3:50] where all the all the visitors were
[3:51] seated and um
[3:54] the other sister-in-law was sitting here
[3:56] it's quite a few people sitting by the
[3:57] coffin right but
[3:58] and she called me up to to come to her
[4:01] so
[4:02] i took my shoes off and went up to say
[4:04] hello and i didn't realize
[4:05] the ceremony already started and then i
[4:08] basically sit right in front there
[4:10] with all the other ones right by the
[4:12] coffin i had a bright
[4:14] green color shirt on which you know
[4:16] usually you're supposed to
[4:18] to wear black and it can be like
[4:21] as i say the traditions can sometimes be
[4:24] that
[4:25] people might be offended if you don't
[4:26] wear the right colors you know
[4:28] so the lord was good i didn't realize
[4:31] that was her favorite color
[4:32] she was wearing that color and i didn't
[4:35] see it because the coffin was already
[4:36] closed
[4:37] but someone told me afterwards that lime
[4:39] green was the color she was wearing
[4:42] in the and i thought well praise the
[4:43] lord you know
[4:45] because other people were like not
[4:47] wearing the right colors and they
[4:49] anyway it was the most peacefulest
[4:52] funeral i have been to in all these
[4:55] years of going to maurice because
[4:57] there's always bound to be
[4:58] someone upset you know and families they
[5:02] fight and they get emotional
[5:04] and there was nothing like that it was
[5:07] such a lot of peace there
[5:09] and that was the lord i believe you know
[5:11] because even others said
[5:12] this was the most peacefulest funeral
[5:15] they have been to
[5:17] so i've been to some of their funerals
[5:19] they fight they physically fight each
[5:20] other you know
[5:21] and they drink and all this but there
[5:23] was nothing like that
[5:24] and i thank the lord for that and then
[5:27] afterwards
[5:29] going to meet some of these in their
[5:31] homes
[5:33] we had a really good time especially one
[5:35] of the nieces
[5:37] she had gone through a lot of hardship
[5:39] and just
[5:40] i had gone through some stuff two years
[5:42] ago and took me a long time to get over
[5:44] it
[5:44] getting out of it and just talking from
[5:47] my heart
[5:48] and she cried and said hey man you're
[5:50] hitting something in my heart and
[5:52] it just released her and um and of
[5:54] course we prayed with them as well
[5:57] and um we just continue to pray she will
[5:59] find the lord because
[6:01] it's not so much about just a spiritual
[6:03] journey somewhere you know to some
[6:05] spirits it's
[6:06] to meet the lord so we pray for that and
[6:09] also the oldest
[6:10] sister we went to yeah just i don't know
[6:13] how to say it it's just when the lord is
[6:15] there
[6:16] um you reach out to them just in the
[6:18] things you say
[6:20] the life you live and i just felt it was
[6:22] the right time
[6:23] to go and yeah just thank you everybody
[6:25] for your prayers
[6:26] and thank the lord for being there at
[6:28] that time
[6:37] god bless you sister belinda for sharing
[6:39] that
[6:40] yes it could be can be hard and
[6:44] cultures and spirits of familiarity
[6:48] and old routines and
[6:52] yeah we come there with a with a with a
[6:56] liberty that we have in christ you know
[6:58] and
[6:59] sometimes maybe you could feel bound you
[7:01] can maybe feel
[7:02] well out of place but i think it's
[7:05] needed
[7:06] that we need to go outside our comfort
[7:10] zone you know
[7:11] go outside and just be light be salt
[7:14] make them salty and then glorify the
[7:17] lord while you're doing that
[7:20] right and with that liberty

[7:27] and set your wings and you can just fly

[21:23] he'll build you but he's building a

[21:37] will come down and he will build a
[21:39] beautiful house a temple
[21:41] on the earth once again amen
[21:44] hallelujah but you see it's the gifts
[21:46] it's not the people it's not the humans
[21:48] but yet there's gifts in our lives and
[21:50] we are actually stewards
[21:53] we're stewards and it's a very very
[21:55] serious
[21:56] matter very very serious i can't stress
[21:59] it
[21:59] enough that we're stewards and we will
[22:02] be answerable
[22:04] to how we are stewards of the gifts that
[22:06] he's placed in our life
[22:08] because he's got a plan amen and this
[22:10] sermon sermon's called david's burden
[22:12] for us
[22:13] i love david who loves david man i just
[22:16] think about david i think man i can't
[22:17] wait to meet him
[22:19] he's going to be he's just such a nice
[22:20] guy you know but powerful and just
[22:23] just everything just so excitable and so
[22:26] just just you love the lord and you know
[22:28] and every time i read about david i just
[22:30] think my
[22:31] my you know wow hallelujah
[22:35] amen so uh one chronicles chapter 28
[22:38] verse 11.
[22:38] it says here amen it says
[22:42] then david gave to solomon his son the
[22:45] pattern
[22:46] of the porch and of the houses thereof
[22:49] and of the treasuries thereof and of the
[22:52] upper chambers thereof
[22:54] and of the inner parlors thereof and of
[22:57] the place of the mercy seat
[22:59] now that's key because we've also been
[23:01] given
[23:02] the revelation of the place of the mercy
[23:04] seat we've also had a david
[23:06] god's manifested in the flesh and our
[23:08] generation and actually he's still
[23:10] manifesting in the flesh
[23:12] and that mercy said still being revealed
[23:13] to given the pattern where it all is and
[23:16] all of those things but it's for a

[30:06] now i have prepared with all my might
[30:09] i love that i've prepared this is david
[30:12] now he's handing over the reins
[30:14] and the greatest burden of his life was
[30:16] to build the house of the lord
[30:17] and this house that he would build was
[30:20] not just any house
[30:21] this house that he would build would be
[30:23] magnificent
[30:25] and it would be a house that was wonder
[30:27] for all the earth
[30:28] and that all the inhabitants of the
[30:30] earth would wander
[30:31] at this great house hallelujah and that
[30:35] this house
[30:36] would bring god down into a corporal
[30:39] condition the the holy ghost
[30:43] the the presence of god amen would come
[30:46] down

[30:58] amen now i'm telling you now this i'm
[31:00] not preaching about that coming into you
[31:02] tonight okay
[31:04] that's you it's happened already we're
[31:06] in the age we're in that season
[31:07] the holy ghost is coming to the people

[31:14] amen hallelujah
[31:15] but yet and so i'm not saying now i'm
[31:18] it's a holy ghost
[31:20] into you but i'm looking at a higher
[31:24] level of prophecy that
[31:27] i'm talking about the spirit of god
[31:29] coming back to the earth
[31:31] the lord coming back down into the earth
[31:35] but he's looking for a people to build
[31:36] that house for him
[31:38] to prepare now that preparation happens
[31:41] in our life on a personal level
[31:43] but it also happens on a collective
[31:45] level it happens in a local body
[31:47] in a local vision and he's looking for
[31:50] talents
[31:52] to come out of the earth because talents
[31:55] get hidden in the earth very easily very
[31:58] quickly
[31:59] the slightest little tinge of fear or
[32:02] some pride or arrogance or anything
[32:05] amen it happens so quickly and then god
[32:08] can't use you
[32:09] he can't use the talents that he's
[32:11] placed in your life
[32:12] and even if you try and you go and do
[32:15] something
[32:16] it may not be gold silver or bronze
[32:20] it may be wood hay or stubble
[32:23] and we don't want wood hail stubble wood
[32:26] hail stubble is a human effort
[32:28] it's an element that god said it cannot
[32:30] handle the fire
[32:32] but all our works will be tried by fire
[32:34] i'll get ahead of myself so
[32:36] i'll just keep reading now i have
[32:39] prepared
[32:40] with all my might thou shalt love the
[32:42] lord with all thy heart all thy strength
[32:44] all thy mind amen all thy might
[32:48] for the house of my god the gold
[32:51] for the things that be made of gold and
[32:53] the silver for the things of silver
[32:54] and the brass for the things of brass
[32:57] the iron for the things of iron
[32:59] and the wood and wood for the things of
[33:01] wood and on its stones for the stones to
[33:03] be set
[33:03] glistering stones and of divers colors
[33:07] and all manner of precious stones and
[33:09] marble stones in abundance
[33:14] you know living stones coming together
[33:16] stones building up the temple
[33:18] amen to a collective vision that will
[33:20] cause
[33:21] the glory of god to descend upon the
[33:23] earth that will cause it to happen
[33:26] a collective revelation that comes
[33:28] together a people
[33:30] that is ready amen to leave the earth
[33:33] and meet the lord in the air so that he
[33:35] can
[33:35] finally come down and manifest for his
[33:38] glory on the earth
[33:39] hallelujah amen but he's looking for
[33:43] willing people
[33:44] he's looking for people to be honest
[33:48] and be transparent and to realize that
[33:50] this
[33:51] is a service of supernatural
[33:53] manifestation
[33:54] realize that this is a time where right
[33:57] now
[33:58] all the things that's troubling you can
[34:00] be dealt with
[34:01] and things that is holding you down or
[34:04] hiding your talent in the ground
[34:06] can be dealt with tonight amen

[36:18] civilization the
[36:20] center of everybody's affection and all
[36:23] they did
[36:25] that was it now it's everything else

[36:47] that god is wanting out of you but he
[36:49] doesn't want you to try and force
[36:50] anything
[36:51] he just wants you to be honest tonight
[36:53] he wants you to be honest
[36:55] and just say lord i know these talents
[36:58] in my life and maybe it's been years and
[37:00] nothing's happened
[37:01] why lord what is in my life that's
[37:04] what's my attitude towards your word or
[37:07] what is it lord
[37:08] does anyone ever ask the lord what is it
[37:11] you say lord is there anything
[37:13] you know the bible says consider your
[37:15] ways
[37:17] we should consider our way every day
[37:19] every morning
[37:20] every night every day live in a state of
[37:23] consideration
[37:25] lord consid i i want to consider my ways
[37:28] tonight lord
[37:29] i i i don't want anything in between
[37:32] nothing between my soul and my savior
[37:34] amen
[37:36] so that he can take over you see you
[37:39] have there is
[37:40] if you could say the tree of life right
[37:43] he says i'm the vineyard the branches so
[37:45] out of the vine comes all the branches
[37:48] and
[37:48] and each each person is like a little
[37:51] branch right
[37:52] you're a branch you're all a branch
[37:53] you're in it you know and and there's
[37:55] only
[37:55] only you fit onto one spot and he's
[37:59] waiting for you to get on the spot
[38:01] we just got to get on the spot because
[38:03] there's sap
[38:04] amen that will make fruit happen in your
[38:06] life
[38:08] he will furnish it all of that now i'll
[38:11] go back to what i said
[38:12] this is everything really let's put it
[38:15] in perspective
[38:16] this is this is what the lord's doing
[38:19] you know all that stuff he says
[38:20] just put me first i'll make all that
[38:23] stuff happen for you
[38:24] you can have your houses whatever you
[38:26] need for you
[38:28] whatever the lord allows and you need in
[38:29] your life i'll give it to you
[38:32] you can have it but for now focus on
[38:35] this
[38:35] focus on the lord where does the lord
[38:37] where do i fit in building this house
[38:39] where's my talon where is it
[38:42] is it hiding in the ground or am i
[38:45] trying to produce it
[38:48] because you there's you can go on the
[38:49] other side of the scale and you can say
[38:51] i'm trying to live a message like i'm
[38:52] trying to produce and i'm trying all
[38:54] these things but
[38:55] it's just not bringing anything or
[38:58] you're just burning out
[38:59] and then you go off and have an episode
[39:02] on the other side
[39:04] but there is a balance in the middle
[39:06] there is a perfect balance
[39:08] amen hallelujah
[39:18] says here because i have set my
[39:19] affections to the house of my god
[39:21] i love i have of mine own proper good
[39:25] of gold and silver which i have given
[39:28] to the house of my god over and above
[39:32] i think isaac spoke on that at the
[39:34] meeting you know you can
[39:36] you don't you can't out give god if
[39:38] you're a real man of faith
[39:40] you'll have no trouble giving to the
[39:41] house of god no trouble
[39:44] and actually if you don't you're cursed
[39:46] take it or leave
[39:48] get cursed financially i don't know what
[39:51] else but
[39:52] definitely your pockets will be empty
[39:54] and the holes in the bottom
[39:56] your bed clothes will be too short and
[39:58] your feet will stick out the end
[40:02] because everything you try and do will
[40:04] never be enough
[40:05] until you realize the importance
[40:09] that our god is able to supply every
[40:11] need we don't have to worry about money
[40:14] we don't have to worry about education
[40:15] we don't have to worry about anything
[40:18] if you just put him first he will bless
[40:20] your work he will bless your education
[40:22] he will bless everything according to
[40:26] his perfect will for you
[40:28] you don't have to worry or try and
[40:32] pull it all to yourself that's the
[40:35] unconverted
[40:36] nature of man and we see it in children
[40:39] a lot
[40:40] you know especially a selfish dispos
[40:43] disposed child everything's always to
[40:46] them they're always going to get the
[40:46] biggest step or
[40:47] you know and you see it and that's a
[40:48] human nature not all children is
[40:52] like that in in abundance some is the
[40:55] opposite and
[40:56] you never know everyone's a mixed bag
[40:57] but human nature's like that
[41:00] come on
[41:08] all that i have prepared i i just love
[41:11] that over and above
[41:12] you see david he was a man of faith he
[41:14] was a man of vision
[41:16] he realized that this was the most
[41:18] important thing
[41:19] this was the crescendo of his whole life
[41:23] was that the house be built amen
[41:27] and i'm praying tonight that maybe the
[41:29] lord will use these chopped up words and
[41:32] the burden that he's placed in me to
[41:34] share
[41:35] the words of god and you overlay your
[41:38] own life
[41:39] and say lord i'm considering my ways
[41:41] tonight if there's anything in your life
[41:43] that is
[41:44] that that's not overlaying nicely then
[41:47] just lay
[41:48] on the altar and let him overlay the
[41:50] word on your life
[41:51] so that your life and his life is like a
[41:54] pattern
[41:56] and it just works together and it's do
[41:59] not struggle

[43:24] really
[43:25] have something real tremendous happen in
[43:27] your life where god just comes in the
[43:29] holy spirit
[43:30] the purpose of the holy spirit it
[43:32] changes your whole thought process
[43:34] it changes everything that you think
[43:36] about and your whole operating system
[43:39] for those that know about a computer

[43:45] system an operating system that will
[43:48] give you joy
[43:48] unspeakable and follow glory an
[43:52] operating system that will love
[43:54] to see god manifest himself
[43:58] in this place because this is what he's
[44:00] building
[44:01] he's building a body he's building a
[44:04] house
[44:05] amen he's building a house that's ready
[44:08] a man to leave amen and he's calling for
[44:11] talents tonight
[44:12] he's calling for gifts in the body he's
[44:15] calling for children
[44:16] he's calling for every age he's calling
[44:20] for a willing
[44:21] people skillful to let the house be
[44:24] built
[44:26] and he's furnishing the grace amen he's
[44:29] made provision he's cleared the land for
[44:32] you
[44:33] he's wiped out all your enemies he sent
[44:36] a prophet and gave it all that you
[44:38] could shine he made all the provision
[44:42] and he destroyed your enemy your enemies
[44:45] on the ground
[44:47] hey man he's just a liar he might be
[44:50] he's on the ground but he's still lying
[44:52] he's lying on the ground and he's lying
[44:54] to you
[44:56] always that's what he's doing
[44:59] if you believe it then you'll come under
[45:01] that power but i believe that
[45:03] so much truth has been ministered so
[45:06] much
[45:06] truth is coming into your ears because
[45:08] you have a burden
[45:11] and that's why you listen to tapes
[45:13] that's why you listen to the prophet
[45:14] because you realize because the holy
[45:16] ghost inside you
[45:18] tells you that it is that is what's
[45:21] going to
[45:21] clean you and prepare you and and bring
[45:24] you out
[45:25] i'm so glad the lord brought me out amen
[45:29] hallelujah and if you get in a trap or
[45:31] get stuck or some your talent gets
[45:33] hidden in your earth again
[45:34] because it can go back down you can be
[45:37] right up
[45:38] and ride in a place of god and then
[45:40] something happen
[45:41] something goes on and all of a sudden
[45:44] that talent's back in the earth again
[45:46] don't leave it there hey man it's
[45:49] serious
[45:50] and we're gonna read the talent type if
[45:53] we ever get there
[45:56] it's quite far down we may not get there
[46:00] but we'll try
[46:01] we'll see how the lord leads amen
[46:04] because i
[46:06] have set my affection to the house of my
[46:08] god
[46:09] and i just pray if you get anything out
[46:11] of tonight i just pray not out of
[46:14] humanity but just say lord
[46:16] what does that mean if a man
[46:19] in the old testament under the blood of
[46:22] bulls and goats
[46:23] can have such a desire and such a
[46:26] passion for the things of god
[46:29] for the house of god for the for the
[46:32] vision
[46:32] for god's heart is here this is god's
[46:35] heart
[46:36] and when this gets to a place where it's
[46:38] completely
[46:39] pattern on pattern with the lord word
[46:41] upon word amen
[46:42] truth upon truth amen spirit of a spirit
[46:46] together amen
[46:49] then the more coming can go out there
[46:52] because that's part of the talents as
[46:54] well the gifts
[46:56] there's gifts in here that can be out
[46:58] there
[46:59] talents that can be out there singing
[47:03] in the markets whatever it may be out
[47:05] there at the universities
[47:07] hey man we go there only two or three
[47:08] people come come on
[47:10] what's happening where's your affection
[47:15] where is it now i'm not trying to rally
[47:17] you in a humanistic way
[47:19] but consider your ways consider it and
[47:22] say lord
[47:24] now don't when you ask him because many
[47:26] of us probably go lord should i be there
[47:28] should i go i've got all these other
[47:31] things busy
[47:32] got all these other things to do got my
[47:34] own stuff my own hobbies
[47:36] lord should i be there the lord knows
[47:39] your heart
[47:40] you can't ask god like that he's looking
[47:42] for a willing heart hallelujah
[47:45] totally neutral totally neutral and say
[47:48] lord what is my talent
[47:50] where am i at hallelujah because you can
[47:53] go out there
[47:54] amen maybe you need the holy ghost
[47:58] maybe it's time tonight to get the holy
[47:59] ghost maybe there's one little thing in
[48:02] your life that's holding you back
[48:04] and it's just that one little thing and
[48:07] he's been wanting for years to pour his
[48:09] spirit on you
[48:10] hallelujah the lord is here tonight to
[48:13] show you what it is
[48:15] you can he can show you that's what the
[48:17] bible says
[48:19] hallelujah amen you know
[48:22] and we talk about talents i'm just way
[48:24] ahead now but that's all right
[48:26] we talk about talents now and you think
[48:28] okay
[48:29] these gifts in the spirit the prophet
[48:31] says that the gifts should be operating
[48:33] in every local body
[48:35] every local body and there's been
[48:37] seasons where they've been fully
[48:38] operating all the time here
[48:40] now we say lord is there something
[48:44] is there something in my life that's
[48:46] holding back this or am i sitting
[48:48] here with a humanistic attitude or what
[48:50] is it lord
[48:52] and we pray lord jesus here i am
[48:55] you want to be a vessel that he can just
[48:57] come upon any time
[48:59] and prophesy speak or tongues interpret
[49:02] the gift of wisdom the word of knowledge
[49:04] healing
[49:06] it's all there for a blessing it's all
[49:08] there
[49:09] to bless and edify the body but if it
[49:13] will not happen if it's hidden in the
[49:14] earth
[49:16] and it's time tonight to go digging
[49:19] jesus locking the wise man to dig deep
[49:22] hallelujah
[49:23] and build his house upon the rock amen
[49:27] dig deep it's time to dig dig out those
[49:30] talents
[49:32] and present them to the lord and say
[49:33] lord here it is
[49:35] it's covered in dirt right now lord but
[49:38] lord jesus
[49:39] i need this to be cleaned up i need this
[49:42] i know this is what i'm really meant
[49:43] here for
[49:44] this is why i'm on the earth this is my
[49:46] whole purpose
[49:48] amen all the other stuff like i said
[49:50] really
[49:51] it's going to pass away you'll never
[49:53] even remember it it's just the vapor
[49:56] we're only here for a little time
[49:58] hallelujah so let's get our perspective
[50:00] right
[50:01] hey man don't focus on anything else in
[50:05] your affections

[50:13] blessed and it will be provided for you
[50:15] as long as you put him first and you see
[50:18] that this is his heart
[50:19] this is what he's doing this is it
[50:23] not that but this will go and get that
[50:26] when there's elected seed out there and
[50:28] people that need to come in and meet

[50:44] and you see there's a talent in here
[50:46] that can go and find that ruined life
[50:48] they can go and rescue that ruined life
[50:51] but there's a body that needs to work
[50:53] together

[52:17] tries everything
[52:18] and he's trying everything anyway he'll

[52:52] man or a real woman of god
[52:54] full of faith the provision is here for
[52:56] you
[52:57] to go beyond warming a seat to go beyond
[53:01] sitting there and doing nothing for the
[53:03] lord and just wondering
[53:05] there's got to be more than wondering
[53:07] you've got to fight for it
[53:09] the kingdom is taken by force you have
[53:12] to take it because the devil will not
[53:14] let you just take it easy
[53:16] but there's a captain hallelujah there's

[1:09:43] focused in
[1:09:44] on what god is wanting to do

[1:10:29] operating at 30 percent
[1:10:30] you know prayer meetings are 30 whatever

[1:10:40] what are you doing with them when you
[1:10:42] come to churches your talent shined up
[1:10:44] and ready

[1:11:36] or in a in anything because every part
[1:11:38] of us there is something for you
[1:11:40] to do there is a perfect place for you
[1:11:43] there is a your talent needs to be used
[1:11:47] and and we want to give it and surrender
[1:11:50] and say lord
[1:11:53] everything i am i lay it in your hands
[1:11:58] everything i take my hands off
[1:12:01] and say here lord here it is i give it
[1:12:04] to you completely
[1:12:06] and i'm going to train around this if my
[1:12:09] talent is bass guitar i'm going to be
[1:12:10] bass guitaring i'm going to be praying
[1:12:12] and i'm going to play it with faith
[1:12:14] i'm not going to play it to look good
[1:12:16] i'm not not picking on ketu
[1:12:18] i'm just that was there and but anything

[1:12:24] and isaac went through it
[1:12:27] be a good song leader don't just don't
[1:12:30] just sing songs up the front
[1:12:33] but find out lord i want you to operate
[1:12:36] in that so
[1:12:37] powerful that the glory of god comes
[1:12:41] down

[1:12:44] the holy ghost once sung
[1:12:46] our son it's not just some mechanical
[1:12:49] and i'm kind of i should really repent
[1:12:51] because i told jeremy
[1:12:53] just to find a list but it was you know
[1:12:55] it was a bit of a last minute
[1:12:58] so you know sorry lord we're all human
[1:13:01] right
[1:13:03] but sometimes we just have to do things
[1:13:04] but if you really think about it right
[1:13:09] there it's got to be more there is more
[1:13:12] and the talent that you have can operate
[1:13:14] in a higher capacity
[1:13:17] so much that when people come
[1:13:21] every talent can be under a prophetic
[1:13:24] anointing
[1:13:25] so that god can operate through you and
[1:13:27] speak the mysteries
[1:13:29] and the living miracles of god and
[1:13:32] testify and sing a song that's exactly
[1:13:36] what that person needed to get the holy
[1:13:38] ghost
[1:13:39] all in a channel of inspiration because
[1:13:42] this
[1:13:42] is a supernatural church we serve a
