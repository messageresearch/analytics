[34:05] that I want to share a little bit of of
[34:08] South Africa so let's just go to Matthew
[34:11] chapter 2 actually so not not not
[34:18] Matthew chapter 2 I'd like to go to Luke
[34:21] Luke chapter 1 and I want to read from
[34:24] from verse 67 this is about the birth of
[34:27] John the Baptist so Luke 1 and verse 66
[34:39] and all they had heard them laid them up
[34:44] in their heart saying what manner of
[34:46] child shall this be speak of John the
[34:48] Baptist in the hand of the Lord was with
[34:49] him and as father Zacharias was filled
[34:52] with the Holy Ghost and prophesied
[34:54] saying blessed be the Lord God of Israel
[34:56] for his visited and redeemed his people
[34:58] has raised up a horn of salvation for us
[35:01] in the house of his servant David as he
[35:03] spake by the mouth of his holy prophets
[35:05] which have been since the world began
[35:08] that we should be saved from our enemies
[35:11] and from the hand of all that hate us to
[35:13] perform the mercy promised to our
[35:15] fathers and to remember his holy
[35:17] Covenant the oath which he sware to our
[35:20] father Abraham that he would grant unto
[35:22] us that we being delivered out of the
[35:24] hand of our enemies might serve him
[35:26] without fear and holiness and
[35:28] righteousness before him all the days of
[35:29] our life and our child shall be called
[35:32] the prophet of the highest for the four
[35:34] thou shall go before the face of the
[35:36] Lord to prepare his ways to give
[35:38] knowledge of salvation unto his people
[35:40] by the remission of their sins through
[35:42] the tender mercy of our God whereby the
[35:44] Dayspring from on high hath visited us
[35:48] to give light to them that sit in
[35:50] darkness and in the shadow of death to
[35:52] guide our feet into the way of peace I
[35:55] mean may the Lord bless us would you may
[35:57] have your seats this morning sorry I
[36:00] don't I don't have any photos and videos
[36:03] on the on the projector because most of
[36:06] them are of of rhino's and and and
[36:08] things from the Krueger but I'll but
[36:10] I'll put that on the what set but you
[36:11] know South Africa it was a it was a
[36:13] wonderful time we we flew into
[36:16] Johannesburg
[36:17] and it was raining normally it's
[36:19] mid-thirties hot sunny we were promised
[36:22] would never see a cloud all we saw was
[36:24] cloud but it was very comfortable other
[36:28] so we so we were invited by the kid Ian
[36:31] Retief invited us for for the youth camp
[36:34] beer and and we had a wonderful time
[36:36] there at the camp it was just as Church
[36:39] there was so it was raining there was
[36:42] flooding never in like over 10 years
[36:45] does it normally normally there the rain
[36:46] only works half a day all yourself kids
[36:48] would know you know be clear blue sky
[36:50] and thunder clouds thunderstorms and
[36:52] pour down with rain and they would
[36:53] finish but it was just raining all day
[36:54] so they said we brought our weather with
[36:56] us and we kind of did but it was it was
[37:00] it was neat so so so there in
[37:03] Johannesburg we met brother Gideon's
[37:05] father brother Willie Retief and he was
[37:07] he he meet brother Branham there when
[37:10] brother Burman was there in nineteen in
[37:12] the early 1950s years here in the
[37:14] meetings in blue Fontaine and he saw
[37:16] because they had seen the supernatural
[37:18] power of God before but when they saw a
[37:20] man standing and and just and just see
[37:23] visions and discern people's hearts what
[37:26] was going on the ordinance I thought
[37:27] this is something different
[37:28] and so the anointing just come down and
[37:30] and and he said in 1965 he actually
[37:33] drove brother BAM to the airport spend
[37:34] some time with them and brother BAM saw
[37:36] that he was going to have a church and
[37:39] and he really started to duplicate the
[37:41] message and then spread it around and
[37:43] and but brother Willie said if people
[37:47] only were ever in that presence of God
[37:49] and he and he started crying telling us
[37:52] just how awesome that Prince of God came
[37:53] down when the angel Lord came into the
[37:55] into the room River was with a prophet
[37:57] that's it he said people would never
[37:59] turn against us if they really felt that
[38:02] presence and he was crying when this was
[38:04] over what 50 odd years ago wouldn't
[38:06] happen but it so impacted by the awesome
[38:08] power of God there and then we so so so
[38:11] we were there at the youth camp and and
[38:15] we saw old friends you know if anyone
[38:17] remembers
[38:18] brother Francois sister mana boys who
[38:21] were in Auckland we saw them which was
[38:22] wonderful yes yes so they seen their
[38:25] greetings and then we then we went to
[38:27] the Kreuger for three nights and that
[38:29] was fantastic
[38:30] that was lush and green because it had
[38:33] been raining but but the good thing
[38:35] about that is all the babies came yo yo
[38:37] were born and it was so we saw all the
[38:39] we saw lions we saw leopards we saw
[38:41] cheetahs we saw rhinos rhinos are very
[38:44] rare these days because of the I'm gonna
[38:47] speak a bit later about the world
[38:48] falling apart and this world has fallen
[38:50] apart
[38:51] you know the Kruger so it's a half the
[38:55] size of the North Island of New Zealand
[38:56] it's a reserve that's how big it is but
[38:59] it's small compared to the rest of South
[39:01] Africa the vastness of the country is
[39:02] amazing and but you know the so the
[39:06] Rhino you know people come and they they
[39:09] they they they kill them they cut the
[39:10] horn off and they get over a hundred
[39:13] thousand US per kg of horn that's just
[39:16] the guy who shoots the rider and cuts
[39:17] the horn off says big money and there's
[39:19] greed so they just go and they're just
[39:21] shooting them out of helicopters and and
[39:24] you know and see anyway but it was neat
[39:26] to see all the wildlife beautiful to see
[39:30] you we saw baboons we saw lions we saw
[39:32] you know whole pride alliance we saw
[39:34] vultures we saw Eagles we saw everything
[39:36] but well we'll put it on we saw wild
[39:39] dogs which are very rare in the park
[39:40] they're just running on the road we saw
[39:42] all kinds of things so elephants
[39:45] giraffes you name it but what videos and
[39:48] stuff on whatever you can see those
[39:49] things and and then we flew down to Cape
[39:51] Town where we where we were brother Dale
[39:55] Adams pre invited he's got a church
[39:57] there and his his his father was here in
[40:01] the meetings also brother branham and he
[40:03] saw you know I may get this mixed up but
[40:06] um it was either him or another and it
[40:08] was another pastor dear that the but
[40:10] both their fathers were there with you
[40:13] know the brother Brennan one of them
[40:14] when when brother brown came on stage
[40:16] see there's just a pillar of light he
[40:18] couldn't see the man it's just this
[40:20] light and and just God like we you know
[40:22] we were taken to - we're brother band
[40:25] preached in in Cape Town well one of the
[40:28] places and and and it's spoken about
[40:30] here and in the province in Africa book
[40:32] and this is outside by the Town Hall who
[40:35] knows Cape Town and over got a lot of
[40:36] surf Ganci who's okay who knows Cape
[40:38] Town so there's the Town Hall where
[40:41] Nelson Mandela he gave us four
[40:44] speech to the people when he came out of
[40:45] prison right next to us this hall called
[40:48] the drill hall that's now a library
[40:50] brother Brown preached at a priest in
[40:53] the drill hall and so brother Dale Adams
[40:55] was telling us so what they do in South
[40:57] Africa is they have open doors so
[40:59] basically they will they will go knock
[41:00] on people's doors
[41:01] she had the gospel with them and asked
[41:03] if they can have a meeting in their home
[41:04] and quite a few people say yes so what
[41:07] so one time they and it's just total
[41:09] strangers and they and then say go into
[41:11] this one house there's this old woman
[41:12] just kind of leaning against the wall
[41:14] kind of half asleep look like and then
[41:17] brother Dale Adams is preaching
[41:18] basically how you're you know there was
[41:20] a man sent from God whose name was John
[41:21] forerun the first coming of Christ and
[41:23] in this day God seen a man called
[41:25] William Branham to fall on the scene
[41:26] coming and then as soon as he said that
[41:29] name William Branham she perked up and
[41:31] said oh I know who that is and he's
[41:33] thinking in his mind oh she's just some
[41:35] old senile woman she doesn't know who
[41:36] this who this man is and and she said ya
[41:39] know I was in his meetings in 1950 I was
[41:42] there and so she's like and it's he says
[41:45] well tell us what happened now she's not
[41:47] a believer okay
[41:48] but but but you know he says well tell
[41:50] us what happened well I was out there so
[41:52] so he preached in the drill hall and and
[41:54] there were thousands of people we
[41:55] couldn't get into the place but we're
[41:57] outside and the big open area outside
[41:59] the drill hole big big big open area but
[42:01] they had loudspeakers playing you know
[42:03] what was going on and then there was
[42:04] preaching basically all day but but but
[42:06] none of it was brother Branham was like
[42:08] if if Bosworth and and you know
[42:11] different ones and then um but then she
[42:14] said but then in the evening we heard
[42:17] brother Brahm come and he said good
[42:19] evening friends and as soon as he said
[42:21] that the anointing just fell on the
[42:23] crowd pandemonium just broke out and it
[42:26] was just mass healings just happened
[42:27] throughout the whole crowd and they had
[42:28] to step over all the cots wheelchair
[42:30] stretchers
[42:31] he just said those two words good
[42:32] evening friends and the presence of God
[42:34] just fell on the congregation that's all
[42:37] recorded about in here thousands and
[42:39] thousands of people and and and she said
[42:43] people were just swaying under the
[42:45] anointing was so powerful God has
[42:48] visited this generation so yeah so you
[42:52] can read about it in here if you haven't
[42:54] read this book
[42:55] but it was amazing to see you know it
[43:00] was amazing to be in a place and hear
[43:02] those testimonies because sometimes we
[43:04] just think because the reason brother
[43:06] Brown he wasn't even actually allowed to
[43:07] preach when he went to South Africa in
[43:08] the 50s because they never considered
[43:10] him to be a preacher but he had some
[43:12] kind of deliverance ministry that's what
[43:13] they said so so the others preached but
[43:16] he just went up and prayed and when he
[43:18] did God just came down what's happening
[43:20] God was visiting his people and I wanted
[43:25] to say that just because you know we are
[43:29] that same one is with us today not the
[43:33] man you know it wasn't the man he says
[43:35] I'm just your brother but that God that
[43:37] Lord Jesus Christ that was with that
[43:39] prophet is with us today and he's the
[43:41] same God in the same way and you know it
[43:47] was a it was amazing it was and and and
[43:49] we saw sister shantel's
[43:51] Mormon and and stepdad they came to the
[43:54] service on Sunday morning you know the
[43:56] camp people really enjoyed it there was
[43:58] one there was one of the counselors he
[44:01] said had been here he was in his 30s I
[44:03] think and he was wrestling with
[44:05] something since he was 12 he said did
[44:07] God just gave him peace at the camp and
[44:09] there was others you know the Lord saw
[44:10] it so I was thankful you know it was but
[44:12] it was a wonderful time it was amazing
[44:15] to see where they are still a living
[44:16] witness with God had been and Godzillas
[44:20] there and Evi say well the proper
[44:22] neighbors have visited the shores but
[44:24] the same Lord Jesus has he's still alive
[44:27] today I mean so I'm still trying to
[44:31] recover from jet lag or something but
[44:34] it's I just want to speak about this
[44:39] morning how the world is falling apart
[44:44] but there's a uniting time going on now
[44:47] it's amazing when you know if you just
[44:49] look at nature you know over over and
[44:51] over in South Africa there's a whole
[44:53] ecosystem so there's the main predators
[44:55] all the way down the food chain all the
[44:57] native species are still there oh and
[45:00] but the thing is though all the habitats
[45:03] been lost so before there was any one
[45:06] really there it was one big game reserve
[45:09] from Kenya all the way down to South
[45:11] Africa's just you know the elephant's
[45:12] used to migrate so we went and saw
[45:14] brother Brian Jones who knows brother
[45:16] Brian Jones we went to my holoholo
[45:17] before him to Cape Town and it was that
[45:19] was a real blessing to to meet him and
[45:22] sister Jenny and so they didn't have any
[45:25] the only wild animal in their house was
[45:27] a goat then have any hyena or which
[45:30] they've had or hippos which have had or
[45:31] Rhino which they've had or lions which
[45:34] they've had didn't have those things but
[45:35] they just you know there's a pic goat
[45:36] there but you know we we got licked by a
[45:38] cheetah
[45:39] you know I've got some Eagles Lennon our
[45:41] arm and you know sort of black black
[45:43] leopard and it was it was quite amazing
[45:45] but you know he said you know when he
[45:47] was young because he helped reintroduce
[45:49] Rhino into the Kruger Park because by
[45:51] that stage they had been killed out and
[45:53] he was told when when he was young he
[45:57] said I'm someone told him that the
[45:59] Kruger National Park is a white elephant
[46:00] so basically it's useless and and he
[46:02] didn't believe it but now he sees it as
[46:05] because you know all the animals can't
[46:07] migrate to where they weren't so
[46:08] elephant used to migrate from Sarah all
[46:10] the way up to Kenya and BEC used to be
[46:12] one big but but but now they can't and
[46:14] because there's the poaching going on
[46:16] and many times actually the Park Rangers
[46:18] are in with the poachers there's all
[46:20] these inside jobs going on and so the
[46:23] whole place even even around them cause
[46:25] there's lots of game game farms so in in
[46:29] Kiwi terms a set of farming sheep and
[46:31] cattle
[46:31] they've got lions and they've got big
[46:33] bucks and different things than you know
[46:35] people go shoot them you know like even
[46:37] around them a whole bunch of lines would
[46:39] just be massacred people go and just
[46:41] shoot them take their skins and so on so
[46:43] but but so he was telling us that you
[46:45] know Africa's dying because the
[46:48] ecosystem has fallen apart and it used
[46:50] to be also even over there that
[46:52] Agriculture's being pushed through lots
[46:54] of because we were driving with with
[46:56] brother Gideon and sister Kathy his wife
[46:58] and and because they go to the park
[47:01] quite often and they say every time they
[47:02] go more and more land has been turned
[47:04] into orchards and what's happening now
[47:07] is because people are growing more more
[47:09] fruit and vegies but it's it's
[47:10] destroying the natural habitat where
[47:13] beforehand it would just be native bush
[47:14] well not what we call bush but then what
[47:17] what they call bush and the cattle used
[47:19] to just Roman forage and they would just
[47:21] have their cattle farms basically the
[47:22] cattle would just
[47:23] wild and that would just bring them in
[47:25] yourself and kill them and so on but
[47:27] because they've taken out all of the
[47:28] natural land and put in fruit and vegies
[47:31] it's actually destroyed the habitat of
[47:32] everything so you know the places has
[47:37] fallen apart but see in New Zealand here
[47:39] we we don't have a full ecosystem we
[47:42] even have one for over 200 years because
[47:44] our our mainland not animal but bird the
[47:47] mole is gone so it's one part of the
[47:49] chains falling apart the Eagle that
[47:51] hunted that is gone so our ecosystem is
[47:54] already broken and it cannot be restored
[47:57] because you can't bring those things
[47:58] back from extinction
[47:58] so our world naturally is already fallen
[48:01] apart you know so if you take one part
[48:05] of the chain out it's gone now that's
[48:07] just in the natural how much more in the
[48:09] spiritual side so now if we read this so
[48:15] yeah so if you could remember brother
[48:17] Bryan and sister Jenny and prayer
[48:19] because they want to retire
[48:20] he's what is he 78 he's 78 and he's
[48:24] still running the place and is a
[48:26] actually a Swiss guy who who's there and
[48:29] in he says he wants to take over but he
[48:32] needs permanent residency so he asked
[48:35] for prayer that that this man marshal
[48:37] would get permanent residency that
[48:38] brother Bryan can retire because he
[48:39] wants to retire he's tired his arms so
[48:42] so this is big ant ant hill out by where
[48:45] the lion cages were and brother Bryan
[48:47] says put your finger in this hole so I
[48:49] put this finger in this anthill of to
[48:51] moment thing and they sing just bite me
[48:53] all these little babies and they just
[48:55] let jaw and they don't let go and he
[48:57] says he says these things I like like
[49:00] nature's um stitches he says you get
[49:02] cuts in the bush you get you find the
[49:04] adults you like pin them to and they
[49:06] just clamp on and you pull the body off
[49:08] of the thing just holds on and actually
[49:09] hold your flesh together his arms of
[49:12] scars you want to see scars it's just
[49:14] scars from from everything that he's
[49:17] done but you know it's yeah so now if we
[49:22] go to Psalms chapter 86
[49:29] yeah but it was it was quite neat you
[49:31] know because my dad is from Cape Town so
[49:32] it was quite neat too you know and last
[49:35] time I was there I was seven so it's
[49:36] quite neat to go back and see the place
[49:38] you know see yeah you know see where
[49:40] you're from people were but you know but
[49:42] we'll did what I said actually I'm South
[49:44] African but I'm Kiwi so basically people
[49:47] like well what are you I thought well
[49:49] I'm from heaven that's all I know so
[49:53] what are you undercover South African
[49:55] and a Kiwi buddy well I don't know you
[49:57] know I'm something but you know when you
[50:01] find out who you'll hear who your father
[50:03] really is you you know that God is your
[50:05] father that that changes the whole world
[50:08] they mean to some 86 and read from verse
[50:11] one bow down lie near o Lord hear me for
[50:13] I am poor and needy preserve my soul for
[50:16] I am holy Oh thou my god save thy
[50:21] servant that trusteth and they be

[50:53] thee O Lord neither are there any words
[50:56] of works like unto thy works all nations

[51:27] great as thy mercy towards me for thou
[51:30] hast delivered my soul from the lowest
[51:33] hell Oh God the proud arisen against me
[51:36] in the Assemblies of the violent men
[51:37] have sought after my soul and have not
[51:39] set thee before them but thou

[51:45] gracious long-suffering and plenteous
[51:46] and mercy and truth I turn unto me and

[51:52] unto thy servant and save the son of thy
[51:54] handmaid show me a token for good that
[51:57] they which hate me may see it and be
[52:01] ashamed because our Lord hath Hope 'land
[52:04] me and comforted me amen so as I see it
[52:07] I want to speak about so the world is
[52:09] falling apart but there's also a uniting
[52:11] time now we know as I see justjust
[52:14] speaking very briefly about nature
[52:16] nature has fallen apart you know there
[52:18] is big studies you know you know I work
[52:20] for ESR and there's a division there at
[52:22] ESR and they're looking at microplastics
[52:24] and in drinking water it's everywhere
[52:27] and it's not just microplastics but even
[52:30] nano plastics because the Sun sunlight
[52:32] breaks down a little plastics it's in
[52:34] the food chain it's in it's in our
[52:36] drinking water
[52:37] you know they've done studies that even
[52:40] even bottled water I'll cover the brand
[52:42] not that the brand matters but there is
[52:44] plastic and the water you drink it's
[52:46] everywhere why cuz the world has fallen
[52:49] apart and we can't do anything about it
[52:52] you know there's a thing today called
[52:54] climate anxiety who's heard of that to
[52:56] him young people are anxious about the
[52:58] climate because climate change you know
[53:00] people are trouble this this distress
[53:02] there's worry there's yo all kinds of
[53:04] because the world is falling apart and
[53:06] we can't change it because it's not the
[53:10] political will even man's even desire to
[53:14] to actually forsake everything and
[53:16] actually change the place because of
[53:19] greed because we're the money in it so
[53:21] Nature has fallen apart the this country
[53:24] is nature's falling apart
[53:27] it can't be restored Africa's falling
[53:29] apart Asia is falling apart every place
[53:32] under heaven the world has fallen apart
[53:35] speaking of nature and unfortunately we
[53:39] we cannot change it at all button and
[53:41] then even even countries are falling
[53:46] apart and we know if you just read the
[53:50] news that you know there is gonna be a
[53:52] world war coming there is coming one
[53:55] Russia and
[53:56] a uniting to destroy the West and we
[54:00] know it will happen you know it's just
[54:03] so thankfully going to dentistry though
[54:04] praise the Lord God bless you amen
[54:07] that was that was a highlight we know
[54:09] heard that through so but I may be
[54:12] painting a bleak picture but at the same
[54:15] time it's not bleak cuz even at a time
[54:18] when the world was falling apart
[54:19] God is uniting himself with his bride to
[54:22] take us to a wedding supper in the sky
[54:23] so now in the first and the you know in
[54:28] the first coming of Christ there was a
[54:31] uniting going to gear now if we go to
[54:33] Luke chapter 24 I just want to I believe
[54:40] it's in Luke chapter 24 sorry Luke Luke
[54:43] chapter 23 there was a uniting of of
[54:47] different powers together that they were
[54:50] never friends before until the Lord came
[54:53] so Luke chapter 23 verses 11 and and 12
[55:02] so this is where so Jesus has already
[55:05] been taken before Pilate you know he's
[55:07] he's had his first part of his trial
[55:11] then Jesus is sent to hear it because
[55:13] Jesus is from Galilee and here it is in
[55:15] charge of Galilee and it says so if
[55:18] we're reading Luke 23 and 11 and 12 and
[55:21] here it with his men of war set him at
[55:24] naught this is Jesus and mocked him and
[55:26] arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent
[55:28] him again to Pilate and the same day
[55:30] Pilate and Herod were my friends
[55:32] together for before they were at enmity
[55:35] between themselves so they used to be
[55:38] hostility between them but because of
[55:40] Jesus they became friends so they had
[55:42] nothing in common until there was a
[55:44] crucifixion of the word and so it
[55:47] actually brought so so these are the
[55:49] scribes and Pharisees they United with
[55:52] Rome to use the Roman government to
[55:54] crucify the Lord Jesus Christ so that
[55:57] brought them together and then Pilate
[55:59] trying to decide what to do with Jesus
[56:01] brought Pilate and here to give us
[56:03] there's a uniting of actually the powers
[56:05] of darkness when the word was made
[56:07] manifested so there was a uniting time
[56:10] these
[56:10] these powers came together and then you
[56:12] can even see the same thing today that
[56:14] Russia and communism is coming together
[56:17] to destroy the West to destroy the world
[56:20] right brother Bram says and and the
[56:23] absolute 1962 he sees communism will
[56:26] burn Rome see you watch it it's at all
[56:28] in God's hand they think they're against
[56:31] God they're working right into it all
[56:32] the time don't know it he's using them
[56:34] as a puppet some tall in his hand like
[56:36] he did Nebuchadnezzar and many others so
[56:40] God used Nebuchadnezzar to bring
[56:42] judgment upon Israel it was at all in
[56:44] his hand just like communism and Russia
[56:47] or at all in God's hand to bring
[56:48] judgment against the church world that
[56:50] rejected Jesus Christ on this day
[56:52] against the West amen
[56:55] this is I mean this is this is world
[56:58] events right so so there was a uniting
[57:02] of these different powers when when when
[57:07] the Lord was rejected at his first
[57:09] coming
[57:10] now so the church and that day use
[57:15] political power of Rome to kill him so
[57:18] they united with throw him and even
[57:20] though Pilate tried to wash his hands to
[57:22] get Jesus blood off of his hands he
[57:23] consented to the crucifixion so the
[57:25] uniting of those powers and then so this
[57:28] was all done that that the prophecy that
[57:31] the Lord said that that not one stone of
[57:33] the temple will remain atop of each
[57:35] other that Jerusalem's going to be
[57:36] destroyed that all had to happen so so
[57:39] the church world rejected the Messiah
[57:40] and that day which actually brought the
[57:43] judgment of God upon it by using the
[57:46] Roman armies and so we know an ad 70
[57:50] that the Roman general Titus besieged
[57:55] Jerusalem and burnt it and massacred the
[57:58] people and when so so in those days with
[58:01] the Romans they used to give them I was
[58:04] like olive leaves wrapped around and
[58:06] like in a crown called a laurel and
[58:08] Titus as recorded said he he did not
[58:11] accept that laurel because he said no he
[58:13] was just a tool of God's divine judgment
[58:15] upon the Jews he knew what he was doing
[58:19] so but then what we have is so there was
[58:23] so but between
[58:25] the crucifixion of the Lord and the
[58:28] destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 there
[58:30] was a book of Acts written and so in
[58:33] that time now
[58:34] there was a uniting of a people with the
[58:37] Lord it's what we're actually living out
[58:40] as brother am said is that there will be
[58:42] another book of Acts written in the stay
[58:44] now when we think of a book of Acts we
[58:46] think normally healing signs and wonders
[58:48] now that is part of the book of Acts but
[58:50] that book of Acts now is he's actually
[58:52] saying as the book of Acts was a pattern
[58:54] and so now if that is the pattern and
[58:57] it's going to be rewritten it will
[58:58] follow the same pattern that was that
[59:00] that we read about so there was a true
[59:02] Pentecost God came and dwelt in us and
[59:05] his people and and in the word went out
[59:07] and churches were birth ministries will
[59:10] form people came to the Lord as as as
[59:13] the word was spread so there was a
[59:16] uniting time even during this time when
[59:19] a when when judgment was now laying over
[59:22] Jerusalem and it was going to be
[59:24] destroyed so the church world was going
[59:26] to be destroyed by this Roman power and
[59:29] we're living in the same day history is
[59:33] repeating itself now he sees here
[59:45] see the thing is though way I'll find it
[59:54] see now notice so so so this is brother
[59:58] brand speaking and uniting time and sign
[1:00:00] he sees no notice he pointed out
[1:00:03] National Science ring of Jesus when they
[1:00:04] asked him about this they wanted signs
[1:00:06] they he um he gave them signs what
[1:00:09] happened they wanted to know when would
[1:00:12] be the end of the world when would be
[1:00:14] the sign of the end he pointed them out
[1:00:15] many signs through the scriptures about
[1:00:17] national science about perming heavenly
[1:00:20] sign in the heavens and earthly sign he
[1:00:22] gave them signs signs just a constant
[1:00:24] sign and he told them they've been there
[1:00:27] be in one place about a national sign
[1:00:28] when you see the nation's gather around
[1:00:31] as I'm gathered around Jerusalem see
[1:00:34] when we know that the time of their
[1:00:36] troubles at hand when you see Jerusalem
[1:00:38] compassed about with armies this is from
[1:00:40] Matthew 23 he's he's referring to now
[1:00:43] before they could do the see the world
[1:00:44] had to unite Titus this great Roman
[1:00:47] general had to unite his armies together
[1:00:49] and come around after these Jews had
[1:00:51] rejected the god-given sign of the time
[1:00:53] to them that's the time that Titus
[1:00:56] United his armies together to come and
[1:00:59] take the city first they had to be
[1:01:01] uniting of God's people so called
[1:01:03] against the Word of God before the
[1:01:05] nation could unite itself against God's
[1:01:07] people see the unity the uniting uniting
[1:01:09] together I believe we're living in a
[1:01:11] great uniting time I'm taking I'm taking
[1:01:14] these red lights down and flesh signals
[1:01:16] of everything of of the woman how they
[1:01:20] do the men how they do the churches how
[1:01:22] they do showing through this little
[1:01:23] group with all my heart I believe we're
[1:01:25] look we are lining in the line of God's
[1:01:28] Word of this great prophetic hour just
[1:01:30] before the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:01:31] uniting together and getting ready so
[1:01:34] now you see before Titus you United the
[1:01:37] nations of his armies together Israel
[1:01:39] United themselves together and banded
[1:01:42] themselves that they would not believe
[1:01:43] Jesus to be the Messiah they rejected
[1:01:46] him and turned him out and crucified him
[1:01:48] and then when they rejected the
[1:01:51] salvation that was sent to them they
[1:01:52] United themselves together to do it now
[1:01:55] hold that in mind uniting themselves
[1:01:57] together to reject the message of the
[1:01:59] hour they had to do that and when they
[1:02:01] did that then that national scientist
[1:02:04] that judgment upon the nation
[1:02:07] and then now he speaks of today the
[1:02:10] uniting together putting their powers
[1:02:12] together the free world they're putting
[1:02:14] its power together the communism is
[1:02:17] putting their power together with Russia
[1:02:19] everybody but each one's scared of one
[1:02:22] another see it's a fearful sign that's
[1:02:24] right it's national signs and things and
[1:02:27] you see what's happening today
[1:02:28] China and Russia communism is coming
[1:02:30] together the West you know the free
[1:02:32] world is trying to come together way
[1:02:34] it's gonna be a war it's gonna be a
[1:02:37] battle of Armageddon as prophesied is
[1:02:39] going to happen and we're seeing it
[1:02:40] actually it it's been on its road for a
[1:02:43] long time I mean we shouldn't be
[1:02:45] surprised when we see the world as a
[1:02:47] lining houses it has to align this way
[1:02:50] it's God's Word being fulfilled I mean
[1:02:52] but but in this darkness of chaos I mean
[1:02:55] there is a people as I said remember
[1:02:58] Titus destroyed Jerusalem that's like
[1:03:00] the Battle of Armageddon that's when
[1:03:01] that's when the judgment that they you
[1:03:03] know that was hanging over the city fell
[1:03:06] but in the between time the word went
[1:03:09] out people were united with the living
[1:03:11] Lord Jesus amen so now that's why we're
[1:03:14] living in this time so you can see if
[1:03:16] you read through the book of Acts now
[1:03:18] you can actually see that everything you
[1:03:20] see around you and and Christendom has
[1:03:22] actually already been lived out before I
[1:03:24] mean so we should be able to see like
[1:03:27] you know for example you know there are
[1:03:30] some people which so if we reach dick
[1:03:35] and Timothy and it season chapter 2 and
[1:03:38] 17 and their word will eat as death a
[1:03:40] canker which is of Jaime Gnaeus and
[1:03:43] philetus who concerning the truth of
[1:03:45] Earth saying that the resurrections
[1:03:47] passed already and overthrow the faith
[1:03:50] of some so people say that we're already
[1:03:52] in the Millennium already in new bodies
[1:03:53] you know these things have already
[1:03:55] happened which they do and they
[1:03:58] overthrow the faith of some so people
[1:04:00] are actually trying to say that things
[1:04:01] have already happened when they haven't
[1:04:03] happened yet people over spiritualize
[1:04:05] events there's going to be a real body
[1:04:07] change that did in Christ are literally
[1:04:09] gonna rise there's going to be a
[1:04:11] millennium where we were going to live
[1:04:12] rule and reign for a thousand years holy
[1:04:15] it's literally going to happen there is
[1:04:17] going to be a literal translation of the
[1:04:18] living Saints right you can't spiritual
[1:04:21] you can't over spiritualize these things
[1:04:23] but people come around and they and they
[1:04:26] say know what brother Holmes said it's
[1:04:28] all been fulfilled well hold on no it
[1:04:31] hasn't
[1:04:32] cuz they're still in these bodies so you
[1:04:34] see that happen you know you can go to
[1:04:36] the Corinthian church you can see the
[1:04:38] Corinthian church has has has risen up
[1:04:40] people are liberal you know there's no
[1:04:42] you know you know what did the
[1:04:45] Corinthians do they condone sin and them
[1:04:46] it's how that man was was was living
[1:04:50] with his mother-in-law you know there
[1:04:52] was this blatant sin and sin among them
[1:04:54] but they weren't willing to to deal with
[1:04:57] it and and the believers in the
[1:04:59] Corinthian church are all Colonel I'm of
[1:05:02] polis I'm of klaris I'm of Christ I'm of
[1:05:05] Paul what they what they doing they were
[1:05:07] gathering around ministries that were
[1:05:08] there and some were just of Christ
[1:05:11] what's that I just listened to tapes I
[1:05:12] don't go to church all that's being
[1:05:15] lived out again today you can see it all
[1:05:17] and so that and that was happening in
[1:05:19] the window between the day of Pentecost
[1:05:21] and the destruction of Jerusalem why
[1:05:23] because a book of Acts is being repeated
[1:05:25] and you see it's what happens when
[1:05:28] people within a church they gather
[1:05:30] around different ministries you know I'm
[1:05:32] of this one arrived do you know what's
[1:05:34] happening they say it's actually
[1:05:34] carnality coming in instead of people
[1:05:37] receiving a ministry as it should be I
[1:05:39] mean because if because if you receive a
[1:05:41] ministry the right way then you'll be a
[1:05:43] benefit to the local body and you won't
[1:05:45] go there and well I like how this person
[1:05:47] preaches I like how this person does
[1:05:48] this no that's actually carnality
[1:05:50] gathering around the gift right so so we
[1:05:54] see that today
[1:05:55] do we not you know and and then you can
[1:05:58] see unfortunately today people gather
[1:06:00] around specialty doctrines they gather
[1:06:02] around a man and that thing falls apart
[1:06:05] because it has to fall apart and then
[1:06:07] people are wondering what's going on
[1:06:09] what is it because they've made a camp
[1:06:11] within the message and they've actually
[1:06:13] and it has to come to naught the man of
[1:06:16] the hour is the Holy Ghost I mean the
[1:06:19] Holy Ghost in the word is the man of the
[1:06:21] hour
[1:06:21] amen when God comes and manifests this
[1:06:24] message that is the man of the hour
[1:06:26] Amen you know we even see the Ephesians
[1:06:29] in this day the Ephesians they were
[1:06:32] taught very deep things but then but
[1:06:34] then Paul
[1:06:35] had to come and remind them husbands
[1:06:36] love your wives as Christ loved the
[1:06:37] church so he's actually had to tell them
[1:06:40] what you've been taught actually has an
[1:06:42] everyday application you're actually
[1:06:44] missing everyday life you're so caught
[1:06:46] up in these deep things of God you're
[1:06:48] actually missing that what you've been
[1:06:50] taught actually should live out your in
[1:06:51] your everyday life and they were
[1:06:54] actually missing that the revelations
[1:06:56] they have received actually had a
[1:06:58] practical application and that their
[1:07:00] everyday life had actually a greater
[1:07:03] meaning than they realized I mean we can
[1:07:06] you know we can read that in Ephesians
[1:07:08] love your wife as Christ loved the
[1:07:10] church
[1:07:11] it says husband wives love love your
[1:07:14] husbands I mean you know so he's saying
[1:07:18] that how you treat each other is
[1:07:20] actually a reflection of a greater
[1:07:21] marriage they meant but they seem to
[1:07:24] obviously why do Paul have to remind
[1:07:26] them of these things obviously they
[1:07:27] forgot I mean that what they learned or
[1:07:30] what they had received actually lived in
[1:07:32] everyday life they meant so the
[1:07:35] Galatians the Galatians we know they
[1:07:37] they they tried to bring keeping of the
[1:07:39] law and to being a Christian and and we
[1:07:42] know the Galatians there wasn't just one
[1:07:44] churches a group of churches so they'll
[1:07:46] bring the light of a former age and to
[1:07:48] what they believe now and we can see the
[1:07:50] same thing today where people try to
[1:07:52] bring a Methodist idea of sanctification
[1:07:55] and to enter the message now what do you
[1:07:58] mean by that well the Methodists had a
[1:08:00] method of biblical holiness so they had
[1:08:04] a physical human method of living a holy
[1:08:07] life that's why they're called
[1:08:08] Methodists right but real sanctification
[1:08:10] is when God comes in and cleanses you
[1:08:13] out how lujah he is the one he is the
[1:08:16] Sanctifier he is the cleanser of the
[1:08:18] church amen but then people try and
[1:08:20] bring in legalism and different things
[1:08:22] you know because you know brother Brahim
[1:08:24] said that the Pentecostals were good
[1:08:26] legalists so they're trying to bring the
[1:08:28] light of a former agent to the word
[1:08:30] today just like the Galatians did we see
[1:08:33] history is repeating itself amen and
[1:08:37] then we can go even into the
[1:08:39] Thessalonians where where where Paul
[1:08:41] says them don't be troubled by literal
[1:08:43] by spirit or by word saying the day of
[1:08:45] the Lord Uros at hand so this
[1:08:48] things that would come and they were
[1:08:49] troubled by things in it that had come
[1:08:51] in among them he saying don't be
[1:08:53] troubled by these things I've been sick
[1:08:56] in Thessalonians if you're wondering you
[1:08:58] know this is another day the Lord will
[1:08:59] not be until that son of perdition is
[1:09:02] revealed this is don't be troubled by
[1:09:03] these things don't worry about these
[1:09:05] things right so we can see the
[1:09:08] Thessalonians are here again today as
[1:09:10] well amen yo so so you go you can read
[1:09:14] through the book of Acts you can take
[1:09:15] the letters that are written in that
[1:09:16] span you can say history is repeated
[1:09:18] itself but even through all of that
[1:09:20] there was a people that were united with
[1:09:23] Christ there was a real uniting going on
[1:09:26] hallelujah
[1:09:27] now when is he uniting with with with
[1:09:31] God and as people it should produce
[1:09:33] something among us right it's more than
[1:09:36] just saying oh we United them and we're
[1:09:38] one with the Lord and we're Christians
[1:09:39] no it should produce a life I mean that
[1:09:42] it's more than just actually something
[1:09:44] we say but it's something that's lived
[1:09:46] out of us automatically hallelujah so so
[1:09:50] he sees here in this is a uniting time
[1:09:53] and sowing but God has received I mean
[1:09:56] but the church has received a heavenly
[1:09:58] sign an astronaut Amen Jesus Christ in
[1:10:00] the form of a pillar of fire that he was
[1:10:02] in the Old Testament and he was that he
[1:10:05] was when he met Saul on the road to
[1:10:07] Damascus down the same Jesus here today
[1:10:11] and what does it do does it bring fear
[1:10:13] it brings love a uniting of one another
[1:10:17] aiming a feeling for one another it
[1:10:20] brings the love of God o you not brings
[1:10:22] us the body of Christ into unity as a
[1:10:25] bride that's what is doing now this
[1:10:28] great union they're uniting themselves
[1:10:31] one group here to fight the other one
[1:10:32] one group over here to fight the other
[1:10:34] one here the church is standing between
[1:10:35] them you watch what happens it will
[1:10:38] unite with them that's exactly right but
[1:10:40] now we that we find out that brings fear
[1:10:45] and frustrations what happens when
[1:10:47] people raise up camps within within the
[1:10:50] message brings fear of lacerations and
[1:10:52] and and secretary anism you know but
[1:10:55] we're when perming but when way but the
[1:10:57] the the church the bride is united by
[1:11:00] one god
[1:11:02] - once per the Sprint God and one holy
[1:11:05] union of God to be one holy bride to God
[1:11:07] that's right all together unity of the
[1:11:10] body the body waiting as a bride as it
[1:11:13] is the bride as we call ourselves a
[1:11:16] bride for the uniting time of the bride
[1:11:18] the church is also coming together it
[1:11:21] should create just a love among us that
[1:11:23] we can hardly be away from one another
[1:11:26] what's happening okay something's have I
[1:11:30] broken something huh okay we'll do this
[1:11:36] now so you know okay we're unplugged so

[1:12:57] just saw in love with him till there's
[1:12:59] nothing else hallelujah amen he says he
[1:13:07] says for lucky that the the uniting time
[1:13:09] is at hand for God is getting the church
[1:13:11] to give it for a rapture to go to the
[1:13:14] wedding for the great Union when
[1:13:16] God and man will unite fraternity when
[1:13:18] creatures have time unite with the
[1:13:20] eternal it was just once done in the
[1:13:23] form of the son of men on earth and he
[1:13:25] had to give his life to bring about a
[1:13:27] power to unite other men with the same
[1:13:30] power for the bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:13:32] now the church is uniting itself to the
[1:13:34] body of Christ
[1:13:35] it's got itself free cut away from every
[1:13:38] little feeder getting itself ready
[1:13:40] getting together Union among them Oh a
[1:13:42] love and a joy and the Holy Spirit
[1:13:44] moving among them oh my what a time and
[1:13:47] we can look even for the you know you go
[1:13:50] back the last 10 years - now there's
[1:13:51] such a unity among the Bride of Christ I
[1:13:54] meant you see even in this country used
[1:13:56] to be fighting infections and division
[1:13:58] and this one's not talking to this one
[1:14:00] that's fighting this one but now it's
[1:14:01] different
[1:14:02] well it's happening there's a love among
[1:14:04] the people there's a uniting time why
[1:14:05] because as the bride is coming to you on
[1:14:07] earth it's ruh it is showing how the
[1:14:09] bride and Christ are becoming one why
[1:14:11] because we're uniting around the Word of
[1:14:13] God we're putting aside our differences
[1:14:14] and partial understanding and saying
[1:14:16] Lord just come living us change our
[1:14:18] lives manifest your word holy that's
[1:14:20] more than just quoting quotes and
[1:14:22] quoting scripture but now the life of
[1:14:23] the word comes into the people and
[1:14:25] manifests himself through them
[1:14:27] hallelujah why there's the Uniting time
[1:14:29] going on amen hallelujah I'm so thankful
[1:14:35] about that say well this so that's
[1:14:40] Christmas you know here we are on this
[1:14:41] Christmas there are three wise men they
[1:14:45] were looking for a star and they were so
[1:14:48] united with the promise of God and that
[1:14:50] day that when they saw the light no one
[1:14:54] else saw the light they see we have seen
[1:14:56] a star in the East who have come to
[1:14:58] worship Him
[1:14:58] and they were so united with the promise
[1:15:01] of God till they saw the manifestation
[1:15:03] of that promise and they followed that
[1:15:04] star all the way to where the Christ was
[1:15:06] hallelujah so so they weren't satisfied
[1:15:09] and just seeing the sign they follow
[1:15:11] that sign all the way to where Christ
[1:15:13] was hallelujah and so no one else saw it
[1:15:16] because they weren't united with the
[1:15:19] word now brother Brown would say and
[1:15:21] that same message isn't it strange that
[1:15:24] these stars are exactly in line for
[1:15:26] three men that nobody else saw it at
[1:15:29] past
[1:15:29] over other observatories but they didn't
[1:15:32] see it just exactly in line now you can
[1:15:34] be so in line with the scripture see
[1:15:36] when those stars become an unity United
[1:15:39] themselves together in this
[1:15:40] constellation three men was also United
[1:15:43] at the same time and you can be so
[1:15:45] United with God in his word until these
[1:15:48] things become realities amen and you can
[1:15:51] see them and know that they are true
[1:15:54] hallelujah who wants to be like that see
[1:15:56] the sign of the time you might look
[1:15:58] right over the top and say all nonsense
[1:16:00] but to you it isn't nonsense to you your
[1:16:03] United with the word and here it is then
[1:16:05] it's absolutely light for the pet and
[1:16:08] when you see this sign unite with the
[1:16:10] believer and that's who I'm addressing
[1:16:12] this to as the believer for the
[1:16:13] unbeliever never see it and what a
[1:16:16] rebuke it would be if he was on earth
[1:16:18] today and to many of our clergy today
[1:16:21] who cannot read the sign the signs that
[1:16:23] we're reading daily here at the
[1:16:24] tabernacle and seeing the things and the
[1:16:27] others are reading it and seeing the
[1:16:28] handwriting on the wall and yet many
[1:16:30] just ignore it and don't even see it at
[1:16:33] all it's nothing to them at all they
[1:16:35] don't notice it I mean but those three
[1:16:37] men noticed it and they followed that
[1:16:39] star until finally they came to where
[1:16:41] the Christ was holy is the same thing
[1:16:44] with the shepherds I mean lowly
[1:16:45] shepherds sitting on the hills of you
[1:16:47] know Bethlehem there that angel came to
[1:16:49] them you'll find Christ in a manger and
[1:16:51] all true angels will lead you to where
[1:16:54] Christ does the work and that's why we
[1:16:56] have the seventh angel messenger an
[1:16:57] angel came to us hallelujah the unlikely
[1:17:00] of the earth like the Shepherd's run
[1:17:02] likely in their day and and as that
[1:17:04] angel said you'll find him laying in a
[1:17:05] manger I mean so a messenger has come in
[1:17:08] this day saying you'll find him in the
[1:17:09] word hallelujah and then we go find them
[1:17:12] we meet him he becomes a reality to us
[1:17:15] and then we have a testimony the angels
[1:17:17] message is true because I met the Lord
[1:17:19] Jesus Christ hallelujah amen
[1:17:24] so it's a time of uniting going on the
[1:17:27] bride in Christ are becoming one
[1:17:29] hallelujah and we know that you know we
[1:17:33] are that the Christians did not get
[1:17:36] caught up when Titus destroyed Jerusalem
[1:17:38] in that day because the Lord Jesus warn
[1:17:41] them when you see armies can pass about
[1:17:43] drew
[1:17:43] flea pray that the you know you know
[1:17:47] that it's not a winter on the Sabbath
[1:17:48] day I mean but but but flee to the
[1:17:50] mountains and and history shows that
[1:17:52] Titus came against the city three times
[1:17:54] the first two times he had to lift the
[1:17:57] siege and and and deal without the other
[1:17:59] enemies so the first time Titus came in
[1:18:01] then the believers recognized this is
[1:18:03] what our Lord told us and they fled when
[1:18:06] Titus lift the siege but by the third
[1:18:08] time amen all the Christians were gone
[1:18:11] and and Titus just massacred everyone in
[1:18:14] the city burnt it to the ground
[1:18:15] I mean sold them and your into slavery
[1:18:17] those who weren't killed it was just a
[1:18:19] massacre but none of the believers were
[1:18:21] caught up in that destruction and it's
[1:18:23] the same thing today
[1:18:24] none of the true believers will be
[1:18:26] caught up in the destruction of the
[1:18:27] world
[1:18:27] none of us will be here hallelujah
[1:18:30] during the time of Great Tribulation
[1:18:31] because we've we've we've heard the
[1:18:33] voice of God on this day saying when you
[1:18:35] see when you see armies when you see
[1:18:37] nations unite together when you see
[1:18:39] everything coming to buses come into
[1:18:41] position as we have hey one man could
[1:18:44] just push a bomb and we're gone I mean
[1:18:47] the whole world is fighting jockeying
[1:18:49] for position I think I think in this
[1:18:54] country our problem as we have it too
[1:18:56] easy life no and I appreciate we're in
[1:19:01] the first world but we shouldn't take
[1:19:02] for granted what we have that's what I
[1:19:03] mean by having it too easy we should
[1:19:05] treasure what we have in this country
[1:19:07] amen we should appreciate the freedom of
[1:19:09] religion we should appreciate the you
[1:19:11] know we always have the power going we
[1:19:13] always have running water where is there
[1:19:15] food you know we should appreciate those
[1:19:17] things never take it for granted amen
[1:19:22] now so we're living in a uniting season
[1:19:26] you say well I've probably said this
[1:19:30] before this could be the last Christmas
[1:19:31] we're here you say well you've said that
[1:19:35] probably every year I don't know
[1:19:36] probably have but the thing is for
[1:19:38] someone this is the last Christmas
[1:19:40] they'll ever see remember the world you
[1:19:43] say well we're at the end time well for
[1:19:45] someone the world has ended right for
[1:19:48] someone this is the end of all things
[1:19:50] why because they because people die you
[1:19:53] know according to ecology common and I'm
[1:19:56] just going to finish with this
[1:19:57] statement according to ecology calm as
[1:20:00] of 2011 50 5.3 million people die each
[1:20:04] year that's about the population area of
[1:20:08] South Africa nearly so as of 2011 effect
[1:20:13] status hundreds inaccurate as of 2011
[1:20:16] this past year was the end of the world
[1:20:20] for 50 5.3 million people because they
[1:20:23] died it was there in time it was their
[1:20:25] last Christmas you know and we we we
[1:20:29] don't have the assurance we'll be here
[1:20:31] next year you know people have all kinds
[1:20:34] of plans but then they can never fulfill
[1:20:37] those plans because something happens to
[1:20:38] them and they're gone so what about us
[1:20:43] you say I've got my whole life in front
[1:20:45] of me you know I've looked
[1:20:47] I have outlived many 18-year old people
[1:20:50] already you know people are young they
[1:20:53] have their ambitions plans but then
[1:20:55] something happens so what are we really
[1:20:59] wanting this Christmas you know do we
[1:21:05] want you know what this could be our
[1:21:07] last Christmas here so I would encourage
[1:21:10] you this this Christmas why don't you
[1:21:13] unite with the Lord met him unites
[1:21:15] himself with you
[1:21:16] you're not my heart that I will amen
[1:21:20] shouldn't that be
[1:21:21] shouldn't that be what of what we want
[1:21:23] because if we died but your heart is
[1:21:25] United with him then what does it matter
[1:21:28] we've won anyway amen you know cuz life
[1:21:32] does not consist of the things that you
[1:21:34] have Jesus said life does not consist of
[1:21:37] the things you possess it doesn't matter
[1:21:39] the material things we have that's not
[1:21:41] life Jesus is that is not the substance
[1:21:43] of life that's just things around you
[1:21:45] but that's not actually what life
[1:21:46] consists of but the problem is we view
[1:21:49] our lives of being the quality of our
[1:21:52] life is based on what we possess but
[1:21:54] that's not quality of life at all
[1:21:56] because people can have the whole world
[1:21:57] and they can be on drugs they can be
[1:21:59] stressed they can be worried they can be
[1:22:01] broken lives completely why because the
[1:22:03] life their life does not consist of what
[1:22:05] they own that's the same thing with us
[1:22:07] you know you know this time of year
[1:22:09] people looking what can I give
[1:22:11] Christmas and what can I get and you
[1:22:12] know one of my so so they're looking of
[1:22:14] things that that they will receive that
[1:22:17] will actually prove to them will show
[1:22:19] them as it being a good Christmas or not
[1:22:21] because they're looking of things things
[1:22:24] that they now own will actually give
[1:22:26] them happiness but we have to come to an
[1:22:28] understanding the things we own will not
[1:22:30] give us happiness they will not give us
[1:22:33] happiness so I just ask you for fifty
[1:22:38] five point three million people this was
[1:22:41] their last Christmas or the last
[1:22:43] Christmas was their last there in their
[1:22:46] world ended they actually came to an end
[1:22:48] time we know this world will come to an
[1:22:50] end time but individually people are
[1:22:52] coming to an end time so what about us
[1:22:56] why don't you receive the real Christmas
[1:22:58] present of eternal life
[1:23:01] why don't you surrender your life to Him
[1:23:04] not have a religion this is not about a
[1:23:07] religion this message is not a religion
[1:23:09] it's not a way to live it's not that
[1:23:11] it's eternal life this is not something
[1:23:14] to argue about or this is eternal life
[1:23:17] so I'll just ask you why not now because
[1:23:24] that's all because when you know a thing
[1:23:26] as brother Isaac said you meet him
[1:23:29] you've won and it doesn't matter what
[1:23:32] happens in life he will see you through
[1:23:34] I mean it's just bow he's in a word of
[1:23:38] prayer shall we if anyone but want to be
[1:23:42] remembered of we just want to raise your
[1:23:43] hand a few if you so desire they said
[1:23:46] Lord Jesus you see the hands that are
[1:23:47] raised and I just asked father you just
[1:23:49] take these people chopped up words Lord
[1:23:52] and by your Holy Spirit may you put it
[1:23:54] all in the right order Lord we are
[1:23:56] living in a uniting time Lord as the
[1:23:59] world is uniting itself around different
[1:24:01] powers and ideologies Lord and there's
[1:24:04] trade wars there's a cold war going on
[1:24:06] there's an arms race Lord there's
[1:24:08] weapons now in existence that have no
[1:24:11] defenses against them Lord there's great
[1:24:14] movement of people because of strife and
[1:24:16] conflict and war and lore this world is
[1:24:18] truly falling apart and Lord we know
[1:24:22] just because we're here and the in the
[1:24:24] back end of the world
[1:24:25] here Lord the last Lord Jesus Lord we
[1:24:27] are we are on the last bus stop you
[1:24:30] could say on the road Lord Jesus where
[1:24:32] we're right here in the corner of the
[1:24:34] Pacific Lord we know we're not exempt
[1:24:36] from from the troubles that are in the
[1:24:37] world
[1:24:38] dear God but I just pray father as as as
[1:24:42] I just briefly spoken about these things
[1:24:44] Lord may we look up and know our
[1:24:46] redemption is near dear Lord Jesus I
[1:24:49] pray father that our hearts would be our
[1:24:51] lives would be united with you with your
[1:24:53] word
[1:24:54] dear God and we know that now in our own
[1:24:56] human ability we cannot do it Lord Jesus
[1:24:58] we can't be Christians and our own
[1:25:00] ability Lord Manners has tried for two
[1:25:02] thousand years - - to try and Lord Jesus
[1:25:06] to try and be Christians in their own
[1:25:08] strength dear God that's why people have
[1:25:10] written up rules and Articles of Faith
[1:25:12] and and and different churches have
[1:25:14] arisen but Lord we know it's it's it's
[1:25:17] nothing we can do Lord in our own
[1:25:20] strength Lord but it's it's only as full
[1:25:22] complete surrender into your hands Lord
[1:25:25] it's a death to self Lord it's a law
[1:25:27] it's a truly Lord or not a real
[1:25:29] repentance Lord a lot of turning 180
[1:25:32] degrees and saying Lord take my life and
[1:25:34] make it vine and might not be our
[1:25:36] desires or anything we want My Lord but
[1:25:38] maybe your life your desires your word
[1:25:40] Lord so father I just pray dear God for
[1:25:43] for each one here Lord I just asked
[1:25:47] their God that our hearts would be
[1:25:48] united to you Lord that we would Lord as
