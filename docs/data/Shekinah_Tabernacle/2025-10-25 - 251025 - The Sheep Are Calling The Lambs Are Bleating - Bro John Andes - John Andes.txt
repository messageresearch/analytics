Never thought I'd be [singing and music] one. I am a living, [singing and music] breathing, walking, testing, longing. &gt;&gt; I [music and singing] am the living pro of what the Lord [singing] [music] has done. They [singing] call it crazy, but they can't take [music] away my story. I am a living breathing [music and singing] testimony. He said I wouldn't that I should give [singing] up [music] and know that the God that [singing] I serve is more than enough. [music] He can move mountains.

[applause and music] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is a song that I wrote a few months ago and I hope it blesses you. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; The day is up. The streets are packed. The sun [music and singing] is blazing down. Their hearts are gone so cold. I see him limping. [singing and music] Dragging this weight that ain't his. The people look his way. But no one sees [music] what I [singing] see. Those eyes. All those eyes. [singing] That's [music] when it hits. It's all for me. He's carrying [music] my [singing] shame. He's carrying my blame. Crushed beneath [music and singing] the burden, but he still takes the pain. I stand here and cry while he bleeds for me. &gt;&gt; Oh, the [singing] mercy in his eyes that sets [music] the captives free. He stumbles and shakes. Still [music and singing] moving, still bleeding. And me [singing] I [music] follow silent while they throw their hay like stones. We reach the hill. [music] Gotha. [singing] They throw him on the wood like a criminal. But he's not. [singing] [music] He's not. He's not. He's the son of God. Nails to healing hands. A crown of [music] thorns adore. The sky breaks open. Crying. The veil of grace [music and singing] is torn. Thunder shakes the earth. And darkness falls like storm. &gt;&gt; But even in the silence, I know I'm not alone. [music and singing] Holy. Oh, whisper, [music] "It is [singing] finished." So quiet you could miss it. Oh, whisper, "It is finished." [music and singing] So quiet you could miss it. Oh, whisper, "It [singing] is finished." So quiet you can miss it. And just like that, [music and singing] no wind, no breath, no life, just a miraculous fight. [music] But you feel [singing] the stillness that wait in the path between death and a miracle's [singing and music] cause. The story ain't over. This grave won't hold the sun. Hope is just beginning. The story ain't [singing] done. [music] &gt;&gt; The story [singing] ain't done. &gt;&gt; The story [singing] end.

But I' I'd like for us to get next to someone, all of us together, sister to sister, brother to brother, and I'd like us to lay hands on one another throughout the congregation. Those that are in the meeting, and just give you some time to find someone. The Bible says they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. Agree on anything. We don't need to wait till a special service or ministers to come or someone special speaker. We just need to believe God's word. And I believe cancers can leave. I believe spirits can leave right at the start of the meeting. We don't need to wait for another time. So just lift up your voice and pray for that person in the name of Jesus. Lord, we're praying as a congregation as the sheep of your pasture, looking out over your fold today across this great globe of earth. Here we are in New Zealand with brothers and sisters, the sheep of your pasture, the lambs of your fold. We believe the message that you brought for this hour, Lord. And the Bible says they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. The shadow of our hearts over our brother, over our sister could bring healing to them. Spiritual needs, emotional needs, financial needs, body needs in the name of Jesus. May the power of God flow through this congregation today. This is our Saturday morning service. Lord, we will never have this day again. These are sacred sands. These are sacred moments. And we're praying for our brothers, for our sisters, from the youngest to the oldest. Our voice is coming up through the blood. We're asking for salvation. We're asking for deliverance. We're asking for healing, for comfort. We're asking for your presence to settle down upon through these vessels of ours. Only one life will soon be passed. We want to give it to you. We want to surrender with you. Together, Lord, we humble ourselves to one another &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus. May Satan be defeated in every life, in every situation. May demon spirits leave this place, those that are live, those that are streaming. May the Holy Spirit move through the body of Christ locally and globally. May the surge of the Holy Spirit bring about a complete deliverance. &gt;&gt; May we be filled with the Holy Spirit even yet while we hear the word today. &gt;&gt; May you be strong. May you be sweet. &gt;&gt; May you be gentle. May you be firm. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. We surrender our bodies to you today, our temples. May you sweep through this camp, Lord, and heal us of our infirmities. Strengthen us this weekend, Lord. &gt;&gt; Touch our spirits, Lord. Touch hearts that are broken, hearts that need to be mended, situations that are out of control and chaos. You're the healer of the broken pieces. You're the mener of our hearts, Lord. So, we pray for one another. We believe you're going to speak to us throughout these meetings. We sanctify the camp. We sanctify our Saturday. We we bless our brother Jonathan Martin in the name of Jesus. May we here tonight from thus sayeth the Lord. If you would give us another service, be in our fellowships, be in our conversation, be with us at the dining hall, be with us in our rooms, be with us and the walking down the pathway, in our in our singing, in our prayers now in the opening of your word. Give us strength, Lord. May the dynamics of your Holy Spirit just move through the mechanics that's all been laid out. Lord, we thank you for Brother Ben glowing in this church and for giving the invitation for us all to come. Lord, we love you, Jesus. We love you with all of our hearts. We want to love you more. &gt;&gt; Forgive us of our sins. Forgive us where we fail you. &gt;&gt; Forgive us where we've fallen short. Bless us today, Lord, in your presence. Lord, &gt;&gt; we thank you in Jesus name. We receive all of these blessings. &gt;&gt; And we say, "Thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; Let's all say, "Thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. Amen. Thank you, everyone. Amen. and shake hands with someone and bless them as you go. God bless. You can just have your seats for a moment. We want to welcome you to Shakina Tabernacle Camp. Each one of you that are so. Amen. Each one of you that are so special to the Lord Jesus and he loves you very much. We want to welcome you and thank you for your kind um respect and love for for one another. I sense a great unity in New Zealand being here and and your fellowship. I want to commend you for that. I want to bring greetings from our local church and and um to the saints that are in New Zealand. Greetings from End Time Message Tabernacle. This is our little group where we fellowship. We started in uh four years ago exactly right at this time in a little building on up the picture on the top there is a community center. Then the Lord gave us a little place. We just leased that building. We don't own that. Want to bring greetings from our local church, our associate pastor, brother Steve Clar, and to all the saints. This picture was taken um last year. This is our family. Um, sometimes ministers come and you don't know if they're married or together or have children or what they're saying. So, I think we can get to know one another a little bit. And, uh, the person that was taking this photo um, got married to my uh, son this year and on February the 28th, she's from Alabama. her father's a pastor of this message and her mother is from Romania and um out of 13 children that was in their family uh 12 of them served the Lord in the light of this message and her her grandfather this is Brianna's grandfather her mother's father was the translator of the Romanian language the voice in the text of brother Brham I just want to say this there's a blessing that follows the message. &gt;&gt; This photo was taken last week. We haven't showed this publicly except for the Auckland service on Wednesday night. My wife didn't even see this before that. I surprised her. But this is our family. We have three children and six grandchildren. And I just wanted to introduce them to the camp and to you. I hope that's okay. Well, this is our Saturday morning service and and the Lord laid some things on our hearts to say and um this morning we'd like to speak on the sheep are calling. The lambs are bleeding bleeding. I think New Zealand has a lot of lambs &gt;&gt; and sheep. We drove here from Auckland. our flight. We were supposed to fly from Auckland to Wellington and the storms were um kind of bad on Thursday. Was it Thursday? Really bad. And so we they our flights were cancelled and they said the next flight available for you is Saturday. I said I can't do that. So we just rented a car and drove down here and &gt;&gt; saw some of the sites. We were in Lake Talpo 33 years ago for our honeymoon and we enjoyed that and and seeing a lot of your sheep and sheep and sheep and things and so but before this the Lord had laid this on our heart about the sheep are calling and the lambs are bleeding. Brother Brandham in um Michigan one time was talking about the times that we're living in and the shadows of a great destruction time. He said, "I seen a scene one day of a lamb out bleeding in a field." Just going to look at this before we stand and read our scripture. A lamb bleeding out in a field. And the little fella got nervous all at once and no one could see nothing. This little lamb just felt uneasy and just kept looking around. It didn't know what to do. He'd reach down and get his mouth full of grass and he'd look around. He didn't know what to do. He walking through the glass. Brother Brandon was looking through some binoculars. Right not far from him came a big black main lion slipping up. He couldn't see it. There was no way for him to see it. But instinct told him that little lamb that danger was at hand &gt;&gt; and he was nervous. He was restless. And brother Brandham said if he hadn't shot the lion, he'd have got the lamb. But there was the lion slipping up on this little poor little fellow out of there in the field. And he couldn't see it. He couldn't hear it. But there was instinct in him that told him that there was danger near. &gt;&gt; How many's ever felt like that before? And &gt;&gt; and we're living in a time of trouble. And I just wanted to say this before we read our scripture also from uh the womb of New Zealand. God has allowed his word and Holy Spirit to birth sons and daughters into message maturity and rapturing character. I believe I'm looking out over a congregation of of believers and some are joining us this evening and tomorrow that have been matured under the presence of this Jesus Christ. the message that was waved over uh this generation 65 years ago with a promise that there'll be more out in the field that will come to the same level of maturity. &gt;&gt; Here we are. &gt;&gt; Here you are. &gt;&gt; And I just want to compliment you on that. We're not living back 65 years ago, 60 years ago. We're living today. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and I just want to say on behalf of brother Jonathan uh Martin and myself, he flew actually further than I did. He flew from Ohio to Houston to Auckland, then Wellington. I mean, one of his flights was 14 hours. One of my flights was almost 14 hours. We only have three services each. And if we go over an hour, maybe hour and a half, I just want to remind you, it's just a little bit of God's love to you. &gt;&gt; So, just have a little patience with the minister. He's trying to get out of the way. We're We're just trying to say the words that the Lord would have for you. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? &gt;&gt; We're servants. We're not anybody bigger than anybody else here. &gt;&gt; So, please forgive brother Jonathan and I the time zones, the change, and we're landing and we we'll be leaving right away. We'll be leaving Tuesday and headed right home for 24 hours and then to the UK for more services. So, I just wanted to say that &gt;&gt; just be mindful of of our short time that we have. We're just trying to be sensitive for you. &gt;&gt; We only have a little time together. &gt;&gt; Let's make the most of it. &gt;&gt; Let's stand and read together in Matthew 18. Forgive me for weeping. The sheep are calling. The lambs are bleeding. And Matthew 18, you you couldn't go through the scriptures on the screens fine. When Jesus was, it's amazing. After these years that they had been with him, this is what was on their mind. Who's the greatest? &gt;&gt; Matthew 18 verse1 is kind of sad &gt;&gt; after all those years they were so carnal. Who's the greatest? And Jesus in verse two, can you transition between scriptures and and the slides? Is that Thank you. Jesus answered the question in verse two and called a little child unto him unto them and set him in the midst of them and said, "Verily I say unto you, except ye be converted and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven." Now, how many want to live in heaven? Jesus is really preaching a whole message by bringing a little child in front of them and saying, "Unless you become like this, &gt;&gt; you're not going to make it." &gt;&gt; When everyone is wanting to say how great we are and &gt;&gt; and we all we want to put out up front that we've got it all together. even come into camps like this. We can &gt;&gt; we can put it out there that we can just put it out there that I'm strong &gt;&gt; and I've got this &gt;&gt; when really most of us are weak. &gt;&gt; And if you just humble yourself a little bit, you don't have it all together. There's there's time sometimes in our minds we feel like we're just going crazy &gt;&gt; and losing our minds. You're not weird. &gt;&gt; You're just a sheep. &gt;&gt; You're just a lamb. And so verse five or verse four, whosoever therefore shall humble, let's say humble, &gt;&gt; humble, &gt;&gt; himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. &gt;&gt; And who so shall receive? And when we come to a family camp like this, I think it's a good attitude to take that it's not all about you. It's not all about me. &gt;&gt; But we are receiving such a little child in my name receiveth me. &gt;&gt; So this camp isn't all about you. &gt;&gt; It's not what just you can get out of it. Even though that's we need more, but it's also creating an atmosphere so that other people around me can receive it. &gt;&gt; And and Lord, if I don't receive anything, &gt;&gt; if you don't talk to me, would you please speak to someone, another sheep, another lamb? But but Lord, I cry out to you. &gt;&gt; Don't pass me by. And then he said, "Who shall receive one so such little child in my name receiveth me?" Verse six, "But whosoever who so shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me." Are you listening? It would be better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he was drowned in the depth of the sea. Woe unto the world because of offenses. For it must needs be that offenses come. Have you ever felt offended or violated because of their music, &gt;&gt; because of their dress? &gt;&gt; It's an offense to you. You just feel like being simple and little and humble and the world is offensive to you. Let's just skip down to verse 10, our last verse, before we're seated. Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones. I'm I'm conditioning you for the service today. Despise not one of these little ones. For I say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Is that incredible? &gt;&gt; Don't despise one of these little ones. God bless you. You can have your seats. Well, I know the schedule and they've told me when our lunchtime is. I might need a little help up here because we kind of went away on on my iPad. Just maybe log me back in if you will. Well, they've told me the schedule for lunch and so I'll make sure you get to lunch. Who enjoys lunch? Half of you. Okay. Who enjoys lunch? I mean, &gt;&gt; who loves fellowship? My wife was born and raised in the message in Australia and she came to New Zealand when she was 18 years old. [snorts] And that's why I said earlier, thank you, brother James, that out of the womb of New Zealand, God has brought forth seed is because she was there in Auckland in the services and God used a min ministry to win her heart to him. And she sits here today, a daughter of Christ and one that came through the womb of New Zealand. The word of God is great. Isn't he great? &gt;&gt; Who thinks that he's great? The Lord is great. [applause] &gt;&gt; So, I just remind you to to just get out of the way so that Jesus Christ can bring forth and birth what he's wanting to do in your life. I look into your faces today. I love you. Brother John's just a real little minister. I I don't claim to be anybody. We've known some of you since the 80s, the 90s, some more recently through co and through Youth Without Borders. And sometimes we'd be all alone in a room at 1:00 in the morning, 2 in the morning, and there literally be hundreds of God's sheep and lambs from around the world, over 50 uh countries sometimes. Sometimes we'd have over a thousand people live by Zoom and Facebook and YouTube that were streaming those meetings. God was taking care of some of his lambs. &gt;&gt; Some of his sheep was helped in those times and and God used you globally. And he'll never forget that. I just always want to encourage you to stay tender before the Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't ever try to be great or something big. Just see how little you can get. Stay simple. Can you just play a little bit of that? I wanted to play something to you today of the sheep calling and lambs bleeding so that we'd all be able to understand the sounds and where we're coming from today. The sheep are calling and the lambs just a little bit louder. Can you turn it up a little bit? I wanted to bring the sound [laughter] Ain't that incredible? Just turn it up a little bit. Amen. Hallelujah. Sheep calling. Jesus said, "Lest we become like little children, we're not going to make it in." And they all were said, "Talk to us about marriage and divorce. talk to us about the thunders and the mysteries. And Jesus brought up a little child in front of them and said, "Unless you become like one of these, you're not going to make it." I want to make it. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank you, sheep. Why are they calling? And and some days ago when the Lord laid this on my heart to say speak today, I actually wrote in my notes, the sheep are out and they are crying. The cry of a lamb, the cry of a sheep, the sheep are out. They get out of the fold. They they run around. I was listening this morning in my room to a message, the good shepherd of the sheep. That would be a good message for you to hear. 1957 and brother Brandham said it's a reproach on the shepherd to lose one sheep. &gt;&gt; It's a reproach on the shepherd to lose one sheep. &gt;&gt; How many believe Psalms 23, the Lord is my shepherd? &gt;&gt; Just raise your hand. How many believe the Bible? The Lord is our shepherd. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a reproach on our shepherd to lose one sheep. &gt;&gt; He's not going to lose one. &gt;&gt; And so I think about this. I I I was thinking about and I if I have time before your lunch, if not I'll just cut it off, but about the broken hearts and about those that have been wounded within their lives. I wonder today, this morning, how many came from a broken home, a broken marriage, and your your family was broken? Just some of you that are even in the back, some of you adults, father, mother, the marriage was broken. Your father, mother broke. Just let lift your hand up. It's not embarrassing. It's just from a broken home, a broken family. You know, there's very few of us that are in this room today, message believers. A lot of us, some have been born and raised in the message, but a lot of our parents are older ones came out and they're the only ones serving the Lord out of their whole family. Is that true? I know we have young people and children. I was born and raised in the message, but I'm so thankful. But there's others that came from a lot of of tearing up and um people that rejected them and scoff them and cut them off. And even in this room today that we come from different nationalities, New Zealand, and some come from Africa, Samoa, some come from Philippines, and I don't know what other countries are represented here. Can you say them out? Just say it out. Say it loud again. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Wow. And we've come from different nationalities and places and sometimes we can even have complexes right here even in the message in the fold because we're God's sheep and she and sheep of his pastures. We can carry baggage from things that we go through on our jobs. I'm just talking to you a little bit. &gt;&gt; We We can carry anxieties. I know there's people that don't even go to church because they're afraid of crowds. &gt;&gt; They're nervous. It's not that they don't like people or the message or the Lord. It's just they get nervous. They get anxious. I pray the Lord would help us during this camp to to be more mindful and to be um to just be mindful of one another &gt;&gt; and we carry burdens. &gt;&gt; Sister Christine is here today and last June when she got into her vehicle and drove down that highway. If there's any person in this building would have known that was going to happen, you would have stopped her. &gt;&gt; You would have said, "Don't go out the door. &gt;&gt; Don't get in the vehicle. &gt;&gt; I want to stop you from the pain. &gt;&gt; I want to stop you from the dizziness. &gt;&gt; I want to spare the pastor. Spare the children. &gt;&gt; Spare the church. &gt;&gt; Spare us globally cuz we bear the burden, too. Just stop, Christine. take a spa day. &gt;&gt; But there's things we go through. &gt;&gt; There's things we face that the Lord allows &gt;&gt; cuz he's molding character. &gt;&gt; He's molding something of beauty in your life. &gt;&gt; You are a sheep. You're one of his lambs. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when this came upon my heart about the sheep are calling and the lambs are bleeding. It was just made in a place like this down on my knees with my Bible open and looking into a bouquet of flowers and and and things like this. You might think Brother John's crazy, but this is how the Holy Spirit moves. He He deals. He knows. He knows what we have need of. It might be a word at the end of the service or tonight. &gt;&gt; It might be tomorrow. It might be something that happens during this weekend in fellowship or a sister or a brother or a young person, something clicks. you know, being raised in the message too and hearing these things from a youth in the Brandham tabernacle and right in the very place where brother Brandham was. And &gt;&gt; but yet there came a day when the lights came on. &gt;&gt; There just came a day when the key turned in the lock. &gt;&gt; And until that happens, we can't force it on one another. &gt;&gt; We can't make it happen. That's right. &gt;&gt; We can't force someone and drag them into the presence of God and give them a humble heart or a broken spirit so they they just surrender. It takes the Lord to do that. &gt;&gt; But the Lord is very good at doing that. &gt;&gt; How many say amen? &gt;&gt; The Lord is very good at being a good shepherd. &gt;&gt; It's a reproach on him &gt;&gt; to lose you. and he's not going to lose you. &gt;&gt; In fact, it might sound simple, but Brother Brandham said um just after the seals, the the Sunday two several weeks later after the seals, he spoke God in simplicity Sunday morning and then the seals and then the the Sunday that he preached here in April, God hiding in simplicity. He was like he was holding everything in between these this thought is keep your life simple. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And I know it's mysterious and the opening of the seven seals and the deep mysteries but at the end of it all keep it simple. &gt;&gt; God hidden and revealed in simplicity. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I'd say this that a man can sit down and look at a bunch of flowers or bouquet and study that 30 minutes sincerely with all his heart and know more about God than he did if he had all the degrees that a Bible school could give him. &gt;&gt; So true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Starts talking about God revealing himself in the flowers and things and the colors. Just down from there, he said one hour would really prove it. would teach you more about God than all the degrees you could have. &gt;&gt; Just think about that today. Maybe I just need to go back to this and let's all look at this for an hour. &gt;&gt; I'm serious. &gt;&gt; We get the message and our gatherings down to the preacher, &gt;&gt; down to everybody looking forward and and we almost get into a frame of mind that that's God or that's this. But really, God's hidden and revealed behind all of that. Behind the band and the music and the preacher and behind all of our dress and our Bibles and and is is must be alive. &gt;&gt; So when I was thinking coming here about the sheeps are calling and the lambs are bleeding, just think about the this why are they calling? Why are the sheep calling and lambs? Why are they bleeding? Is there an area that needs to be uncovered or dealt with? Cuz you can be born in the church. You can be raised in the church. You could hear about brother Brandham from a little girl and a little boy. You you can know that you should be doing better. But sometimes it takes a certain doctor that that knows the case. a specialist to be go into a certain area and just say things in a certain way and it starts uncovering and starts moving things around in a believer's heart that you can go through that for just a moment in his presence can transform you forever. &gt;&gt; Just being in the presence of the Lord for 30 minutes. And I know that's difficult cuz this generation, let's be honest already. Some of you, your minds are wandering. You're shifting. 20 minutes is our focus cuz we're swipe, hit, punch. We're was raised in that. &gt;&gt; And you can preach against cell phones and media all you want to, but they're here to stay. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we can talk about websites and people and all of that, but it's the tree of knowledge. But there's also a tree of life. &gt;&gt; You can say that's a bad plant. That's a poisonous mushroom. You can be t talking about all the bad things that we shouldn't be doing. But a real shepherd just leads the sheep to the good food. &gt;&gt; He leads them to the grass. &gt;&gt; He leads them to cool waters. &gt;&gt; Sheep need shade. That's why I thank you, brother Ben and church for allowing us all to have this family camp together because believers need times like this. &gt;&gt; We need times that we can just pause and just reflect. There's times in meetings that we need it to be restful and calm &gt;&gt; because that's how the Holy Spirit moves and he settles down into hearts when it's calm. &gt;&gt; Still waters run deep. As much as you might want to have fast and rushing falls and streams, a really good shepherd knows that sheep and lambs have got to go by cool waters. &gt;&gt; They get nervous. And if we're not careful, I'm talking about ministers can be the wrong example &gt;&gt; from behind the pulpit &gt;&gt; and think that everything's got to be loud and rushing and and and we've all got to be jumping and screaming. It might be just the opposite of what the Lord wants from us. &gt;&gt; Be still and know that I am God is still part of the Bible. And it just might be in a meeting like this that the Holy Spirit can drop a seed down in a certain way and then it can go a little bit deeper &gt;&gt; and you can settle down and with that calm assurance, it just comes around a young man and a young lady that if you look, they're just going like this. &gt;&gt; The nervousness of the age, the the spiritual raping of our youth is rampant. I'm speaking to you as one that's from America. Brother Jonathan's from America. But I pray God we would not bring an American spirit to you. &gt;&gt; A pride and arrogancy. &gt;&gt; That's what the American spirit is, is pride. In the first seal when brother Brandham read Malachi 4 verse one, when it talks about the proud and and brother Brandham stopped and he said like the Americans and so forth. And if we're not careful, we can start feeding from that. And I know through co a lot of you was at home more and you streamed other services and streamed meetings. Maybe they came from other countries or even from America. Let me say this. You don't live in America. &gt;&gt; You live in New Zealand. &gt;&gt; And you need to find the channel and the mind of the Lord for for your area and for your church and for your family. Do I have the liberty just to speak what's on my heart and &gt;&gt; just say what the Lord would have us to say? The lambs are bleeding. The lambs in John chapter 21, Jesus talked about this to Peter and said, "Feed my lambs." &gt;&gt; Can you put that up for the people? I don't know. Is it bad to go back and forth? John 21:E1 15. You that are writing notes can just see that Jesus was talking to Peter and he said, "Feed my lambs." &gt;&gt; That's number one. If you really love him, you will have a heart for the young. &gt;&gt; So, a a real ministry. Um, let me talk about lambs for just a moment. A lamb is a baby sheep. They're young sheep. They're the youth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They are children in the message. They are the young in faith. They're someone that you could be middle-aged or older, but you're young in the faith. You're a new Christian. That's a l the lambs are are bleeding. Is the young and courage, too. I'm young and courage. I I'm a youth in my courage. I I feel, brother John, like I'm just depressed and oppressed. And then you just start bleeding. You just And you don't even know what you're doing or saying, but you The Lord hears that cry. &gt;&gt; The Lord has heard your cry. &gt;&gt; The youth of the message. The lambs are bleeding. The lambs are crying. Is the youth of the message. the young people, the children, the teenagers, new Christians. It's the heart that is coming to the surface. Is this okay today? &gt;&gt; Your heart is coming to the surface and the Lord is dealing with that. &gt;&gt; I just want to say this. I don't know if I can say it strong enough for you and for us, but God has heard your cry. Even for this message today, God has heard your cry. &gt;&gt; He's heard the call from your heart and your thirst. your thirst that he put inside of that seed to be like him &gt;&gt; in the midst of all the concrete that Satan's trying to pour on your life and all the education and all the school and all the grades and got to go got to go got to make money got to perform got to be a good you know girlfriend got to be a good boyfriend got to be a good spouse got to be a good pastor got to be a good deacon friend sometimes we just need to humble ourselves elves look at one another as sons and daughters of God and let's just be real for a little bit. Let's let the Holy Ghost come down into a place &gt;&gt; that now he can move in our hearts in a way so that when we leave here on Monday and Tuesday something has been dropped down on a deeper level. How many would like that &gt;&gt; that I can go away with something &gt;&gt; and and long after brother John Jonathan is in back home and brother John's already flying the other way that you can say I didn't feed from a man &gt;&gt; and that sister that talked to me out there by that fence and and and shared with me somebody laid their hand on my shoulder somebody spoke to me for five minutes &gt;&gt; really connected with me you can say thank the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's a rock in a weary land. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we just need a fresh drink of water &gt;&gt; and we don't need a three-hour sermon. &gt;&gt; We just need a moment. &gt;&gt; I just need a moment to breathe. &gt;&gt; If you notice our title, he didn't call you a goat. &gt;&gt; He didn't say nothing about you being a Judas. You being foolish virgin, &gt;&gt; you missing the rapture, &gt;&gt; you're a sheep. &gt;&gt; And if you're a young sheep that is a lamb, praise God for that. &gt;&gt; Some people don't like noise in the church. They don't like little children making noise. They don't like people little children running. As you get older, you get a little bit more contankerous and you don't like your the excuse me for saying that. I'm of grandpa, too. And little hands on the windows and marks on the floor and everything's all topsyturvy and you just clean that up and then something spilled. That just means that there's children around the house. &gt;&gt; When young people are running through the church and they're screaming and they're making noises, there's a lot of people that don't like that. I'm going to tell you what you're going to have in a few years. An old dried up church. Bunch of old people. &gt;&gt; Your young people will leave. &gt;&gt; Young families will leave. &gt;&gt; Say they left the message. Sometimes they did. But sometimes they left what you were calling the message. &gt;&gt; What you and I What have we done with Christ? And so I just as we're going to come through the word here in a little bit, &gt;&gt; the voice, the heart of the shepherd will go for the one &gt;&gt; and not the 90 and nine only that have it all together. &gt;&gt; See, we're carnal. We focus on the 99 &gt;&gt; and the amens that we want to get and leaving like we had a real meeting, brother. How many remember the message influence when brother Brandham preached that many times but in the one service when he spoke and and had an altar call and a mana young man came forward and he said I would pray that he would be another Isaiah. Is there another anyone else here that would like to come forward and give your heart to the Lord? They're just very very few. Then brother Brandham drops back into discernment and starts calling out people's names and their addresses and their disease and you back there and you got this and you've got that certain kind. You can hear the people [screaming] and crying out. And then he said now who would come &gt;&gt; and they it was packed out. &gt;&gt; The aisles were full. He said the aisles are full. The altars are full. He said there's two or 300 of you that should be up here. That's what he said. So the altars were full was just packed out. There's a lot of us that said would have said, "Man, we had a meeting." &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham, right in that time, he rebuked them and said, "You have done the worst thing you could have ever done. &gt;&gt; You should have responded to the word." &gt;&gt; Now that was our prophet. &gt;&gt; When the altars were full and they were going right on down the aisles and my we would have probably left and sat in the back room, took off our coat. We man, we had a meeting. What a response to the word. And brother Brandham, rebuke them. &gt;&gt; So our response should be to the word. &gt;&gt; Our response should be the Lord dealing with hearts that it's like Lord, you are saying exactly what I've already been. Something's been going through my life and the word met me at that sacred place. &gt;&gt; And at that moment, I surrendered. &gt;&gt; At that moment, I just gave it all up. It happened in the book of Acts while they heard the word, they were filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I believe we're living in another book of Acts when &gt;&gt; when men and women can be actually filled with the Holy Spirit right in a meeting &gt;&gt; and God can already know &gt;&gt; weeks ago what this service needed to have right this morning. And he would lay it on a minister's heart. what we're going to hear tonight doesn't have to always be just spontaneous uh inspiration that that moment. It can be where God's been dealing, God's been deeply stirring &gt;&gt; and that's been on that minister's heart. Can you can you agree with me? God can lay it on a minister's heart in another country &gt;&gt; to come and say a certain word that is thus sayeth the Lord &gt;&gt; just as much as brother Brandham saying and your address and your name and your condition and this is that &gt;&gt; if if we can just come to that revelation that Jesus is here &gt;&gt; Jesus is in this building right now &gt;&gt; two or three of us have gathered we've gathered from all different places and and we came with needs and burdens and the lambs are are crying and they're calling Lord do something for us. Do something for our children. Now help me as I move into another level here. We pray for our children. We pray for the needs in our churches or and and then the we've come to such a time as this. Then this ought to be the moment that all of us together, one heart and one mind ought to just be on the edge of our seats. Lord, just say the word that needs to be spoken. I'm not here for just for for an emotion or a gymnastics class. I am here that the word would come down to my life, to my daughter, to my son. &gt;&gt; The song leaders need to be ministered to. &gt;&gt; Our musicians need to be ministered to. &gt;&gt; We've got pastors here that have burdens and needs and and ministry that are here and we've all come together. I have burdens. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. We all do, friends. &gt;&gt; And it's a call. The blading of a sheep or the blading of a lamb is not complaining. &gt;&gt; Lord, we're not complaining. &gt;&gt; It's not a whining, an annoying, just knowing, knowing, knowing, Lord. It's out of love. I'm just coming to you today. This is our Saturday morning service, Lord. There's needs among us. There's needs. There's situations. &gt;&gt; We've been in prayer. We've been Lord, you know what we go through through the week. This is October 2025, and we can all look so pious and religious. But friends, we are in desperate times. &gt;&gt; We've not come this way before. &gt;&gt; What our children are dealing with, what our grandchildren are dealing with is 10 times worse. If you've got children, this what our prophet said. &gt;&gt; You, we've been in the message long enough. Some of you older ones ought to know. Brother John's already quoted things verbatim. What Brother Brandham said, he said, "Our children have it 10 times worse than we have." &gt;&gt; Is that what he said? &gt;&gt; Then if we've got grandchildren, then how much more is it? &gt;&gt; It's a hundred times. Cuz 10 times more than 10 times more, then there ought to be a sensitivity. There ought to be a greater awareness that we have people here. &gt;&gt; Sheep here. &gt;&gt; There's burdens here. &gt;&gt; Can we all just give it to him together? &gt;&gt; Just give it to the Lord together. I wonder what would happen this weekend if all of us just had an attitude adjustment and said, "Lord, I give myself to you. &gt;&gt; I give myself away. What are you trying to do, Lord? What are you doing in my life? &gt;&gt; I want you to know that this is a safe place. &gt;&gt; These meetings are a safe place. &gt;&gt; There should be no bullying going on here. &gt;&gt; Somebody looking at one another criticizing, oh, this person or that person. Friends, we're all in this together. &gt;&gt; God don't like bullies at in the middle school. He don't like them in the church. &gt;&gt; We're not here for politics. Brother John isn't here to tell you what I know or to preach to the pastors or some great deep revelation. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to preach minis mysteries. &gt;&gt; I'm here to preach Christ to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He answers the questions. He just dissolves the doubts. &gt;&gt; You might have already got it last night. You might already be filled up. Then somebody that's really filled up begins to have care for somebody else. The way that a real shepherd deals with sheep is gently. &gt;&gt; I just heard that this morning too from brother Brandham in in that message. The good shepherd of the sheep that a shepherd deals gently with sheep. &gt;&gt; We love sheep. Who who likes sheep or lambs? Just raise your hand. You look to the face of a lamb. It's like, wow, incredible. We were seeing them all over the place. We had to just drive all one of the towns. We just drove off up through the town and we drove through some back road somewhere down some lane and the people's opening their window looking at the dogs are barking and we're driving up to somebody's house to their farm. We just wanted to see sheep &gt;&gt; and we pull in there, you know, and in America they'd probably be shooting you by now, you [laughter] know. I'm serious. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. But New Zealand doesn't have that spirit, right? You all are kind, gentle, and so good. Somebody driving down your road, and we pulled in there. Nice to have you today. Thank you for saying yes. We pulled in there and Molly come out with her little baby and and there's all these sheep everywhere and little lambs. And this one was born last Friday. My little baby hard couldn't hardly walk and they're all just being like sheep and lambs. It's like, yes. But then we come to the camp here and we look around spiritually. We're sheep of his pasture. &gt;&gt; And there's lambs. There's little there's little girls, little boys, there's young people. &gt;&gt; We've got teenagers. We got older ones. my one of these places. We stopped and we pulled over. Here goes brother John. We pulled over and we My wife gets out. She's videoing and then this whole field. She came back and said those were the ugliest sheep she's ever seen. She said it. I mean, some are no hair, some are like half shoring, some are like big woolly. It's like in this one field. They're ugly. And I'm looking at you today. &gt;&gt; Well, what are you all thinking? I was thinking I [laughter] I I was thinking of that song, He Made Something Beautiful of My Love. What were you thinking? Come on. We're supposed to be one mind and one accord. Amen. &gt;&gt; But let me say this. Whether you're an ugly sheep or a sheep that still trying to get things together, you're still a sheep. &gt;&gt; And I just praise God that God has put a seed inside of you. &gt;&gt; No matter how far you wander and where you go, &gt;&gt; you don't make a good makeeliever. You don't make a good partier. &gt;&gt; You don't feel all when the guys are all happy and they're talking about their their jokes and they got their alcohol and they're talking about their movies. You don't fit in. &gt;&gt; You can watch their movies. You can be on their drugs. You can do all kinds of perverted things and you're not happy. &gt;&gt; You're not fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Am I talking to somebody? &gt;&gt; You can do all the things the world does and you're miserable. You're like a fish out of water. You're you're just you're you're troubled. You're nervous. You're upset. That's because you're a sheep. &gt;&gt; I I was reminded this past week of the prodical son. The Bible says, "And when he came to himself, &gt;&gt; is that what the Bible says?" We could all turn to it, but you all know that that's what the Bible says. when he came to himself. &gt;&gt; And that's all that needs to happen &gt;&gt; is that the great shepherd would just deal with that person in the way that he knows how to win their hearts. Lord, you know &gt;&gt; what it's going to take &gt;&gt; to win that person for you. &gt;&gt; The Lord knows the those that are his. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many have tried to make things happen and no, you're going to do this and you're going to dress this certain way, you're going to be and it's just hypocritical. &gt;&gt; But you let God do something. You let the Holy Spirit come down on a person and it changes them. They don't have to put on nothing. It's real. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what these camps are good for. &gt;&gt; Birthing sheep. birthing lambs. &gt;&gt; Somebody wander in. Somebody come. Some not don't even know what to expect, but the the Lord knows. &gt;&gt; Somebody that just wants reality. They're just moaning. That's what a bleeding a bleeding of a sheep is. They're wanting direction for their for their life. It's a feeble outcry. They just want reality. It becomes a moan. Sometimes &gt;&gt; they'll be looking straight ahead, driving down the road or in in a situation with their friends and it's like a lament. It's like they look out the the train window, everything's going by so fast. They're not happy. I think it was David that said, "I long and I desire to see his glory like I have seen it in the sanctuary." &gt;&gt; Yeah. I want to see you, Lord. I want to see you come on the scene in a way that it changes lives. &gt;&gt; Brother James, I need your help up here again. It goes to sleep. I think that's cuz I'm going too slow. Is that right, brother? Brother Matt, that's the reason why it's going to sleep up here, right? I think so. It is. It's not you. It's just the m It's just we're working together. Amen. Let's go to uh Matthew 18 again. Verse 11. Thank the Lord for these brothers and sisters helping &gt;&gt; at the camp and all the media and all the workers, all the cleaners. Let's give the Lord a real [applause] praise for these brothers and sisters. Now, [applause] Matthew 18:1, I promised you for your lunch. You're you're going to make your lunch. Okay. For the Son of Man, Matthew 18:1, the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost. &gt;&gt; Some for years had it all wrong. It's just come to make big churches. &gt;&gt; It just come to, you know, get a people all dressed in a certain way, acting in a certain way. We're all in the message. And you find out very, very fast that the message is to save that which was lost. &gt;&gt; People that were astray. Matthew 18:1, the Is that what your Bible says? &gt;&gt; The Son of Man has come to save that which was lost. &gt;&gt; Then what should be our mission at camp when we come together like this? Your spiritual radar ought to be going all over the place. Is there a need? Is there a burden? How can we get out of the way? Say, "I don't like that music." Nobody asked you. You say, "I don't like that preacher." Nobody asked you. That's right. &gt;&gt; You say, "I don't like Brother John Andy's." Nobody asked you. &gt;&gt; And if you get really personal, I'm trying to get out of the way. &gt;&gt; You say, "I wanted Brother Wayne Lawson to come. He'd love to be here today, but his father went into hospice care." That's end of life care. &gt;&gt; He only has one father. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So maybe next year, &gt;&gt; maybe another time. But God knew &gt;&gt; God knew that you needed two two brother John's, Jonathan and John. God knew there needed to be there's faith, there's Peter, there's James, there's hope, and there's John. That's love. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we just need love in the box. &gt;&gt; We need honey in the box. &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. that statue of a perfect man. That's brotherly kindness. We need someone that will just say it in a way it's like, "Wow, that's in You're right. That's and and the lock just turned." &gt;&gt; And then then later you're saying, "Man, where have you all been all where have you all been in our church? Where have y'all been?" It's like, "I've been here, but the lights just came on. &gt;&gt; Now they're being used. Now they're praying. Now it's like, wow, you have a special." They actually said, "Thank you. &gt;&gt; They're actually helping to clean tables. You know that young lady, she used to be so this and that and flighty. Now she's becoming she's becoming a real nice young lady, a real godly example. She's moving from being a lamb into being a real nice sheep. You can What does that? The word of God. &gt;&gt; As we grow from year to year, &gt;&gt; you're growing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you just need someone to say you're growing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Since Youth Without Borders, we've gone all over the world, literally Africa and Europe, and and I've met some of the young people, people that you were influenced. Now, they're wanting to get married and now certain they'll come up to me and say, "Thank you." &gt;&gt; So, I'm saying thank you back to you on their behalf cuz you provided a platform for the Lord Jesus to minister to them. &gt;&gt; I say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Say, "I was all alone." or just me and my sister, me and my brother. And God came to me in my room. I heard the voice of God. &gt;&gt; Somehow through them wires, somehow through all of that and craziness and weirdness, 2 in the morning, all alone or maybe another brother helping us, the message got through. &gt;&gt; Bloody, broken, misunderstood. &gt;&gt; And whatever's happened since then, you say, "It hasn't been an easy road." I understand that. None of us are on an easy road. We're Christians. &gt;&gt; We're a minority. &gt;&gt; But we're not a victim. &gt;&gt; We're sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; And God gives us words that changes our attitude. &gt;&gt; Let me just go back. Just give me 60 seconds on this. You that are always upset about children or people or young people, people, babes in Christ always saying things, do you ought to just be thankful you have children. Amen. &gt;&gt; You ought to be thankful there are people that want the message you've got. &gt;&gt; Cuz there's some mothers that can't have children. &gt;&gt; There's some families that can't have children. &gt;&gt; There's some churches that don't have a lot of young people in their youth group. &gt;&gt; And we got 20 people, 30 people, 50 people, Brother John, maybe 80. Our youth group isn't that big. And then and then we we all come from different backgrounds. Now I'm talking to some of you. We come from different backgrounds and we're not all close. You know, Brother John and this and that. And then we can start to almost tear apart and fragment because we don't have a strong base, you know, and the strong youth. And so the people at school becomes our friends or the person at the gym, we become a we fit in better with people on the university campus, you know, we can talk to them very openly and nobody's calling us boyfriend, girlfriend. But you do it at camp and they've already got you married with three children. &gt;&gt; What did we do in the message? Why did we become a skewed? &gt;&gt; And we laugh, but it's true. &gt;&gt; And some of our young people can feel more themselves, out on a university campus or out on the workplace with people that aren't believers. And and we have shoved them out like that &gt;&gt; because we've made it so weird. Would you people of New Zealand please be an example and &gt;&gt; to those and just stop all that? Just let them be. Talk to one another. &gt;&gt; Well, if our minister said it, maybe it would sift down a little bit and and moms and dads wouldn't be so weird. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham's son was smoking at 15. His 17-year-old daughter was playing rock and roll music with her friend up the street. &gt;&gt; His other son was wild and crazy and rebellious as a I know that's where I was born and raised as a teenager. There's a lot of us that would have rode off brother Brown as being a bad parent. &gt;&gt; One son's smoking, the other one's doing this rock and roll. The other one's wild and crazy running around this and that after he's married this and this and this. You'd say, "Man, where is that delinquent father? That's your prophet." &gt;&gt; We begin to realize that we are the sheep of his pasture. And we all need the Lord. &gt;&gt; There's no big eyes and little you's. We need the Lord. [cheering] &gt;&gt; But let me say this. It's not all we need you. We need you. I'm desperate for you. We have him. &gt;&gt; He's right here in this service. &gt;&gt; He's walking up and down the aisles. &gt;&gt; He's in our bedrooms. He's in our bathrooms. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's in the trail. He's walking down the road today. [screaming] &gt;&gt; He's in the where we're eating food. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If you'd look close enough, he's in your brother. &gt;&gt; He's in your sister. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But if you look even closer, he's in you. &gt;&gt; And that's the most difficult thing. We struggle with that. And the Holy Spirit's just trying to bring all the atmospheres that are fighting and he's saying, "That's why I am here." Look in verse 12. Matthew 18:12, if you have your Bible, how think ye? If a man have a hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, does he not leave the 99? Is that what your Bible says? A good shepherd would leave 99 and goeth into the mountains and seeketh that which has gone astray. Bad sheep. Bad sheep. You are very bad. So we're going to put you to the sidelines. &gt;&gt; Where did we go astray? &gt;&gt; Where did we lose the goal? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why have we become so callous and hard as older ones? &gt;&gt; When we ought to be the ones that are the most gentle and long-suffering and forgiving. &gt;&gt; If you have what you say you have, the greatest message that ever's been given, then let's see it in one another's lives. And then if we make a mistake, just ask for forgiveness and say, "I am sorry. I am wrong. Take that out of me. I don't want that in my life. And let the Lord do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know this is really, really simple today. &gt;&gt; We're like sheep 101. We're like back to sheeperd 101. But that's what some of us need. &gt;&gt; We need our religious little tower shaken sometimes. &gt;&gt; Maybe God's dealing with that young man, dealing with that young lady. Maybe that mother needs this today. Maybe that brother needs exactly what brother John is saying. And he'll bring a brother from over the ocean to say what we needed to hear. &gt;&gt; Listen, brother John's being very real. I I think I've got money in the bank with some of you &gt;&gt; spiritually speaking. We've got money in the bank. &gt;&gt; That's a secular phrase, but that means I can say things and get away with it &gt;&gt; because you know I love you and you love me. God bless you for that. Another brother say the same thing. You'd be offended and get your noise at a joint center. I'm not coming back to the next service he's preaching. I'm kind of sick today. Well, I I am too. It's because you've allowed your critical spirit to affect everybody. &gt;&gt; And don't sit there with your arms all folded &gt;&gt; and then want your young people to do this. [cheering] Oh, bless God, brother, brother. You're really down here in the kitty pool today, aren't you? &gt;&gt; Well, weren't you a kitty one time? &gt;&gt; Weren't you one years, two year? Wasn't you a lamb before? &gt;&gt; Let me remind you of John when Jesus said, "Feed my lambs." &gt;&gt; That was number one. &gt;&gt; Then he said, "Feed my sheep." &gt;&gt; I know we went there and that was a long time ago, but feed my lambs. Feed my sheep. Feed my sheep means feed the sheep, &gt;&gt; sheep food, &gt;&gt; not jokes, &gt;&gt; not personality, &gt;&gt; not making them New Zealand great again. &gt;&gt; Let's all make New Zealand great again. You know, you're not going to do that. &gt;&gt; The word's already said it's falling apart. &gt;&gt; Say, I'm holding on to it. Bless God. Hallelujah. Yeah. Bless God. Hallelujah. You better hold on to Christ. say, "But I gave up a long time ago on that." Well, he's holding on to you &gt;&gt; and and you get wayward and start having this old mentality and this spirit. Nobody wants to be around you anymore &gt;&gt; cuz you're always talking negative about everybody else's church and their women, their young people. Yeah, Brother John, but if you really only knew this. Let me And God knows everything. &gt;&gt; Who are you? I mean, who's the Pope in New Zealand I'm supposed to talk to about marriages and young people or &gt;&gt; can this couple mar and who who's who is in in New Zealand? What what city is it now? &gt;&gt; You know, years ago it was this certain city and that certain place and that certain pastor. I'm being honest. Who who can I talk to that will say, "Well, over in New Zealand, this is how we do it here." And then in heaven, we're going to have the Africans and we're going to have the European. That's not it. &gt;&gt; Heaven is going to be one big place where we're all the same. &gt;&gt; I'm not discounting that. You know, the Africans have the moves and &gt;&gt; it just flows through them. &gt;&gt; And us white folk, we're starchy and stiff and we'll look at it like this. You know, &gt;&gt; I'm calling you sheep &gt;&gt; of his pastor. &gt;&gt; It could be high pitched, it can be low pitched. But I'm talking about in verse 12, one sheep that gets astray, starts doing things wrong, starts going down in the thickets, going over the cliff, and it gets rainy and tornadoes. I understand there was an earthquake in New Zealand at 9:30 last night. Does anybody else know about that? I'm getting a text from thousands of and there a 5.0 5.1 is coming right down through Wellington right around. Did y'all know that? It was probably Brother Jonathan in close of the service. You know, [cheering] I'm serious. [applause] &gt;&gt; It shook us up here in in our camp meeting and they registered on the RTOR scale. &gt;&gt; I'm being serious. I had somebody send me a text and it's like, it goes right down through here. I'm like, "Wow, that's incredible. I knew it was brother John closing the service last night. He's powerful. &gt;&gt; You know, we live in Seattle near Seattle, Washington, and there's huge big stadiums. They have football stadium, NFL stadium that seats thousands and thousands of people. They have a ba baseball stadium with a retractable roof. They got hockey team. They got all of this. And in the in the football stadium, it they actually designed it like this so that the noise is so powerful. They they register the fans when they roar on the RTOR scale. It's so loud. And in in our American football, there's 11 players on the field. Just give me 60 seconds. Okay. Talk about sports a little bit. 11 players. And then they call it the 12th man because it's the crowd and they're so loud and they're so cheering like the opposing team can't hear the play and what's going on. They call it the 12th man. The crowd actually registers on a RTOR scale. &gt;&gt; And I thought my I wonder about our church services sometimes. You know, &gt;&gt; even the church mice have to be quiet sometimes and go. You could hear a pin drop. There's times we need to rejoice and be happy and thank the Lord. And there's other times we need to be quiet and let the word go deeper. Sometimes the bat of a sheep and the moan of a cry is a signal of distress. &gt;&gt; How we doing on time? &gt;&gt; We doing okay? Sometimes people can be going through things and if you'd really listen, they're distressing. They're sending out a distress signal. &gt;&gt; Would somebody listen? &gt;&gt; Does anybody know? I'm lost. And they may never say that, but the English language, French language, German, whatever you're from, but that's what you can just see. There are sheep that's lost. They're astray. I was lost and undone without God or his son. And if you've been like one of those, and we all have, &gt;&gt; I said we all have. &gt;&gt; We all like sheep had gone astray, then you ought to have the bigger heart for someone that is rebellious and stubborn and they're not going to listen and they're going to just put it down even harder. Then he said not to fold my arms. I'm going to fold my I'm going to lift up my elbow. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; and and they're getting worse and it's going worse. &gt;&gt; Don't give up hope, friends. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you've been that way, too. &gt;&gt; You've heard things and you've done just the opposite. &gt;&gt; You've been in good meetings. You've had good pastors, good churches, and then sometimes years go by and we get complacent. We get lazy. We want them to do all the preaching, all the studying, and we become lazy and doy and slothful and indifferent. We don't want to come early no more. Why don't you come early? Everybody just sitting there doing nothing, catching a little rest. I'm catching a little rest here, brother John. You're not fervent anymore. You're not praying for the for those that are serving. &gt;&gt; Then we wonder why these spirits have come in. I pray God you'd turn the volume up on that microphone to that those that are desperate, those that are needy, &gt;&gt; those that have a real need and they're crying out to God. They might be sitting there just very very quiet. They're not amening today. They're in receive mode, &gt;&gt; okay? They're just they're just soaking it in. They're soaking it up. They're about ready to make the the the greatest decision of their whole life. Then let them listen. &gt;&gt; Let them hear the word. &gt;&gt; Say, "No, we've moved it up now to the 90 and9, brother." Bless God. Hallelujah. That's not bless God. Hallelujah. You're not being like Jesus. &gt;&gt; He said he'll leave the 909. &gt;&gt; In verse 13, he said, "If he go, so be that he find it. Verily I say unto you, he rejoicth more of that sheep than of the nine and nine which went not astray." Man, this is really simple, isn't it? &gt;&gt; All heaven is like busting loose and we're down here. Oh man. Oh man. So bored. So bored. So bored. When's it going to be over? And all heaven's just busting loose. And the angels that have been trying to deal with all of this person and move them toward the Lord and move them toward righteousness, they're like saying, "Yes. Yes. Just a little further. Just another song. &gt;&gt; And you already ch clocked out &gt;&gt; 30 minutes ago. &gt;&gt; You're already eating your lunch and drinking your coffee. &gt;&gt; And you're there's a hungry sheep and a hungry lamb &gt;&gt; that is just going like this. It's like, "Oh, God, how did he know that about me? &gt;&gt; I don't want anyone here to think that I'm backslid." So you just sit there. Sit there. Sit there. Go like this. You know, maybe tears coming down. You know, get yourself together, son. &gt;&gt; Big boys don't cry. Who told you that lie? &gt;&gt; It'd do good. It would do good for all of us brothers to weep a little bit more. &gt;&gt; Cry a little bit. &gt;&gt; It'd be good if some of our deacons just let out a great big hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Some of our brothers, some of our parents said, "Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And get more of the nature of Christ on us. &gt;&gt; I'm going for the one. I'm going for the one. &gt;&gt; I'm going for the one. Man, you're so focused. Man, you're so passionate. Yep. We're going for the one. &gt;&gt; Excuse me, but if there's 200 people here and there's 99 out of 100, that means there's two people. God's coming for you. [cheering] [applause] And and by Sunday, there might be 300 here. I understand. &gt;&gt; Well, that means there's going to be three people God's going to be dealing with really strong. And that minister's got to stay focused and the musicians got to be in tune and everybody's got to be in one mind for three people. &gt;&gt; Say, "But come on. We got 297, Brother John." No, there's three. And the Holy Spirit's made all of this. He set up everything. He arranged everything &gt;&gt; when are you just going to humble yourself &gt;&gt; and say, "I need more of Jesus." &gt;&gt; What are we going to have to go through for us to just learn to let go and let God? &gt;&gt; I know we say those phrases, but let go &gt;&gt; and surrender. &gt;&gt; You can do that. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can do that. &gt;&gt; God gave you two hands. &gt;&gt; And if they can scream and yell at a rugby game &gt;&gt; and get all in the spirit of it, surely we can say, "Send your presence, Lord, into our lives, into our down into that realm. Go down underneath that place, that sacred place." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's like a little button. Brother Brandham said, "It's in your soul. &gt;&gt; That's a little something. You ought to be thankful you didn't die as an infant. &gt;&gt; You ought to be thankful as a little girl, little boy that car didn't come out of nowhere and crash and take your life and we all had a funeral service at some of us get so down in the mouth and so negative about the food or this and we got to be thankful we have any food. &gt;&gt; You see what's happening in Hamas and Palestine and Israel. That's horrible. War is horrible. Do we agree? &gt;&gt; Now I'm listening really close what you're going to say about it. War is horrible. &gt;&gt; Don't bring that into the message. &gt;&gt; Don't bring your politics into the message. &gt;&gt; You keep it right at home. Keep it to yourself. &gt;&gt; Especially at camps like this. &gt;&gt; We need to be brothers and sisters to one another. &gt;&gt; All those bad feelings and poison, keep it to yourself. We don't want to hear it. I'm glad I got money in the bank. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of us need to say, "Preach it, Brother John." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 14. Even so, it is not the will of your father which is in heaven &gt;&gt; that one of these little ones should perish. &gt;&gt; Let's all go like this. Just one. Just one. If I would have said a hundred, you'd have been putting up your feet and toes and borrowing from your friend. Just one. ers and are you walking in a circle with those other brothers and that's all nonsense. &gt;&gt; You know, sisters, we get all these chats and we start this and that and if you're white, it's like, no, we we don't really see it the same like that. And so our little chat, we don't have anybody from this certain nationality. I'm just going to go down like this. We don't have anybody from that nationality in our in our little group. Well, shame on you. Amen. &gt;&gt; God rich in mercy, &gt;&gt; had mercy for you. &gt;&gt; He had mercy for me. &gt;&gt; And I just want to praise his name today that God's mercy didn't leave me out there in the world somewhere. &gt;&gt; God delivered you from drinking, smoking, &gt;&gt; and sexual sin. &gt;&gt; And then that's happening right in your church or in your in your family, and you're wanting to write them off. Shame on you. God rich in mercy needs to come down in you and be the mercy. You be the mercy. &gt;&gt; And if we would have had five services, I would have preached on the mercy seat. It's not somewhere over in Israel. It's not somewhere in Jeffersonville, Tucson. The bride is the mercy. &gt;&gt; Then can I ask you, where's the mercy? &gt;&gt; Where's the forgiveness? This is a good scripture. Isaiah 53:6. All we like sheep have gone astray. &gt;&gt; We have turned everyone to his own way. And the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. &gt;&gt; We all like sheep has gone astray. &gt;&gt; But I didn't say you were a goat. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we didn't pull over one time &gt;&gt; or a field of goats &gt;&gt; or dinosaurs. &gt;&gt; No alligators. &gt;&gt; It was all sheep. &gt;&gt; Praise God. That's what we're focused on. Where we're looking for a place to end. Some of you can go and scratch your head and say, "My, that was so, so simple." We're looking for tonight's service for what the Lord would have for us. These lo innocent, lovely lambs, great creatures. Wish me had more time to study that nature of the lamb. It's wonderful. God likened us to lambs. The lamb is an animal that cannot make his own way. And quicker, sooner rather that we find out that we can't make our own way. &gt;&gt; We can't make our own way. We can't make our own way. &gt;&gt; Let's make it personal. I can't make my Amen. Don't say it cuz Brother John said it. Just say, "You know what, brother John? I've seen it. I cannot find my way. I don't even know the way." &gt;&gt; Now you're getting more like Solomon. &gt;&gt; When God asked him, "What what do you want of me?" And he said, "I am but a child. &gt;&gt; I don't know how to go out or to come in." And he wasn't a little child, &gt;&gt; but he had brought his humility down to such a it wasn't his age cuz he wasn't a little child, &gt;&gt; but in his heart, he had humbled himself to say, "Lord, I can't go in or go out. I need your wisdom." &gt;&gt; And that's in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; What about the New Testament? My, let that great shepherd come down. That blading that's going down in a ditch somewhere was a young lamb and the old you had went away with the rest of the herd and the little fellow was helpless. And how I picked him up and packed him to his mother and how he just laid in my arms and I thought, "Oh, God, that was me." One day I was all together undone and you picked me up into your arms and packed me. My our prophet even was like that. &gt;&gt; Then surely we've been feeding off this message all these years. We can become marked like that. I'm going to today have time for that little girl, &gt;&gt; that little bully, &gt;&gt; that teenager. &gt;&gt; I want to say this publicly. We're we're not against you. &gt;&gt; Brother Jonathan, myself, we're here for you. &gt;&gt; We brought our wives. We we we're here to support you. We're not here to preach at you. We're with you. &gt;&gt; We're going to go back to our problems and our and you won't hear about our problems. &gt;&gt; We're here to minister to you. &gt;&gt; We're here to get down to the place where God can deal with your life and your need and your situation and what you're going through. So, can you just help me by moving to the next slide? I want you to just see here. Can you help me there? So, in New Zealand, we've heard the sheep are calling, the lambs are bleeding. Let's respond. &gt;&gt; Let's answer. &gt;&gt; And you know, I'm being very humble with you. We said we had three services, Brother Jonathan, but some aren't even here yet. They might only hear one, maybe two services. Some have to go home on Monday. Some might hear tonight, Sunday morning, Sunday night. That's three. The whole driving 5 hours, 3 hours, 2 hours, all your money, all your time. Let's put it in together and say, "Lord, we want to see your glory come down. [cheering] &gt;&gt; We've had enough of men and women and glory to this church and glory to that minister. It's glory to Christ. Just put some gasoline on the fire and and let the Holy Spirit just lick up all the the rocks and lick up all the sacrifices. &gt;&gt; Are you with me today? &gt;&gt; Just lick up all of our flesh, all of our nonsense, all of my worldly dreams, &gt;&gt; all of my ambitions, and all of my carnal frolic that I've been guilty of. Just consume it, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's finish strong today. &gt;&gt; God's heard your cry. He's heard the bleeding of the sheep. &gt;&gt; Can you go to the next slide? Cuz here it just messed up here again. He's talking about this little lamb bleeding and he was watching it there in Africa and it was so peaceable and things and then all of a sudden it got nervous and he wondered what the matter was and a little sheep cannot find his way back wherever he comes from. He's lost completely. [screaming] Stop it. [screaming] What else do you want to hear? &gt;&gt; Rock and roll music. &gt;&gt; Some bad joke. No. Lord, turn up the volume. Just play a faster song. [screaming] &gt;&gt; I'm making a fool of myself &gt;&gt; for your sake. &gt;&gt; We need the Lord to turn up the volume of that young lady, that young man, or maybe it's an even a person that's older. You say, "I would never go forward because the altar is for sinners." Who told you that? The altar is for consecration. &gt;&gt; It would do some of your young people good if some of you older ones were the first one at the altar. &gt;&gt; Oh, why do we got to You don't have to go up there. There's nothing sacred about an altar call &gt;&gt; if you go back and live the same. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; I said there's nothing sacred about an altar call. &gt;&gt; Wow, y'all got quiet on that one. Did Jesus ever have one? I believe in altar calls. &gt;&gt; I do. I believe in prayer lines. What the Lord would lead you to do that. &gt;&gt; But I believe we need to walk in the spirit and hear the blading of our sheep. And what's the really the need of the hour &gt;&gt; if they're wandering away from the corral and and this young lamb of sheep was it couldn't smell its enemy like a deer or something like that to know that death is near. But there was a lion slipping up coming easily. He could smell the sheep. He was coming to get the lamb. And the little fellow become nervous. You couldn't see the reason why. But it was death lurking so near that he was nervous. &gt;&gt; Can you go to um slide number 23? I'll give you that title. And then the next slide. I wanted to show you this before we leave. Next slide. I wanted this to be the visual of this camp of the old and the young generation. Next slide. I wanted that to be very common even this afternoon and tomorrow that we learn the old generation and the new generation. &gt;&gt; Sometimes that's all that person needs is just a hand on their shoulder. &gt;&gt; And us men, we like to fix everything. God wired us that way. And women like to just listen and get emotional about it. Were they nice to you? How did they say it? Oh, well they did. And and the all the sisters are like, "Well, how did you take it? Do they smile or were they angry? It's all taken care of." Well, I just really want to know because God made them like that. We're at a family camp, right? I've been to family camps and heard family camps and there's nothing said about the family, &gt;&gt; nothing said about young people, &gt;&gt; nothing said about husbands and wives. We heard that last night. We're hearing it this morning. God's weaving it through at all the services that he cares. &gt;&gt; He He's got your number. &gt;&gt; He knows all that you're going through. &gt;&gt; Do we believe that today? So, let's join the next slide. I wanted you to see that. Let's be the type of men and women, the older generation, having understanding, coming across to one another, not always down, but coming across. That's the nature of Christ. Next slide, our last slide of a of the of a quote. When brother Brandham said, and Christ is the mystery, we are his victory. &gt;&gt; The church is his victory. We come forth in this last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory. &gt;&gt; He died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we see him coming down and living among the church, that's his victory. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise God." &gt;&gt; I am his victory. &gt;&gt; Then he has come to me in my weakness and made me strong. God is helping me through. My help is from the Lord. The Lord is my helper. The Lord is my counselor. The Lord is my healer. &gt;&gt; The Lord is my savior. &gt;&gt; The Lord is redeeming me back to me, my ought to be place. The Lord has got my case. &gt;&gt; He's got my number. Why don't you let me go? Just get away. He's not going to let you go. &gt;&gt; He'll go around the back door, go around the side door, come down the chimney, whatever. You're a son and daughter of his. You're a sheep. You're a lamb. He has heard your cry. &gt;&gt; He's heard your call. &gt;&gt; The lack of character, the lack of morality only is like crying out for more morality. More character. Amen. &gt;&gt; My I wanted to speak about humility and those that were broken and those that were to this person will I look in Isaiah &gt;&gt; who was contrite and broken and that trembled at that at my word. But I promised you your lunch. So we got to leave that. But I'll leave you with that. say, "All I had to offer him was brokenness, &gt;&gt; a contrite spirit." That's Psalms 34:18. Psalms 51:17. A broken spirit and a broken and a contrite heart. &gt;&gt; He didn't throw you away. He didn't call you dung. &gt;&gt; That's my son out there. That's my daughter. I wonder how my son's doing tonight. The prodical son's mother. I wonder where he's at tonight. I wonder where she's at tonight, Lord. Little did they know, the heart of of the Lord Jesus was going to turn their heart and a new spirit. Well, he was going to put inside of them and just break them and say, "Well, I guess I'll just come back and sit in the back row somewhere. I'll just come back and be like one of your servants or something." And the whole the whole response was totally opposite. It's like, "Here comes my dad. Here comes my mom." And and don't forget the the elder brother there. He's got a bad attitude a little bit till the father came out and talked to him. &gt;&gt; And we don't know the rest of the story. But I hope I'm speaking to believers that would say that older brother came in too to the house and said, "You know what? I had a bad spirit. Let's go. Come on." I mean, we're family. &gt;&gt; And yeah, you heard us. And yeah, the last years have been miserable around here. And what did you do to mom and dad? You Well, talk about it back there, but here we are in the house. Amen. We're rejoicing. &gt;&gt; We're here to welcome you back. &gt;&gt; Say, "But they don't deserve it. Neither do you." &gt;&gt; I I I believe the Lord's talking to us, younger ones and older ones. &gt;&gt; That we need to be less hardened and harsh &gt;&gt; and we need to move under the nature of the Holy Spirit. And don't be like David when the time was coming for the temple and God said, "You've shed too much blood. You've been too much of a fighter. I'm going to have to use someone else that is a man of peace." The new generation and the bride of Christ and their ministry is handled by peace. &gt;&gt; It's not a bunch of old fighters and warriors. And that's brother Brandham's phrase, old fighters. It's not that they're old in age. &gt;&gt; Some of our young ministers have become pulpit fighters. And that's not the nature of Christ. &gt;&gt; We need to learn to turn these corners well &gt;&gt; and let the new generation have peace. God's peace &gt;&gt; declared over the whole congregation, over your home, over a troubled mental case and anxiety &gt;&gt; and just they're talking and it's not making sense and your heart is being rent out of you and you're and you just feel like saying, "Lord, where did we go wrong?" And the Holy Spirit is saying, "I you are my victory. I'm going to work this out for my glory. &gt;&gt; I'm just looking to you, Dad and Mom, to give it to me. Yes, &gt;&gt; I wish that we weren't so time bound creatures. &gt;&gt; Our last slide. Just go ahead and move it to that. I hope in New Zealand that during this family camp, God can let us be more spiritual with one another. If we're going to live in eternity together, there will be a bride that is learning to live on earth &gt;&gt; with that kind of character. &gt;&gt; We don't even deserve to be in the same room with with you. We don't even deserve to be in the same room with brothers and sisters. I'm talking about the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Say, if I just had a vial of his blood, I would keep it. I No. And he said that you become the blood. &gt;&gt; The body of Christ is the blood. &gt;&gt; So be careful how you handle her, how you talk to her. &gt;&gt; Stop bullying my people &gt;&gt; or I'll sideline you and I'll put you in the dugout. &gt;&gt; I'll raise up another generation if I have to. &gt;&gt; To talk to my bride the way she deserves to be talked to &gt;&gt; woo her heart &gt;&gt; to say, "Come on, boys. &gt;&gt; Come on, girls. and show by example that we're leaders. &gt;&gt; Not squirt a little water over here, squirt a little water over here, try this over here, that. No, but come on, bride. &gt;&gt; Come on, sheep. Let's go. &gt;&gt; And some of you are saying that about lunch. It's like, let's go. And I'm like, let's go. Let my people go. Amen. Brother Isaac, can you come and our wonderful musicians and those that need to close the service? Have thine own way, Lord. Have thine own way. Thou art the potter, we are the clay. Mold us and shape us after your will. While I am waiting, yielded. You know that song? &gt;&gt; Yes. My thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Who believes there's going to be a bride out of New Zealand? &gt;&gt; Just raise your hand with a vote of confidence. There's going to be a bride out of New Zealand. &gt;&gt; Say, "But they're getting out of step or this is that." Well, just scream like a get back in line. Let's go, bride. &gt;&gt; Tell her who she is. minister who she is. &gt;&gt; That's our whole mission is is to tell the bride who she is, encourage her. Let's get into our place. Let's get back to the fold so the shepherd, he can lay back over. He's the door of the sheepfold. He just lays over and says, "All is well. I got all this. What about the wolves, Brother John? What about the tigers?" I was talking to some of you young ladies down there. I said, "Is there any tigers and lions around here?" We're walking across that little area going into the this auditorium here. I'm like, "Wow, do y'all have dinosaurs in New Zealand?" Snakes. Oh, no. No, we don't. Praise God. And the Lord's like saying, "You're going to walk right down through this valley of death, but don't you fear. I'm going to be with you." &gt;&gt; Say, "But I there's Warren. They're fighting. The lions are after me. The hounds of hell. Don't don't worry, little sister. If you could see in that other dimension, &gt;&gt; there's another great big lion. There's another great big dog that's already barking. And &gt;&gt; y'all know that. You've heard that story, right? That that lady, young teenager was coming from the prayer meeting. Was coming from the prayer meeting. She was walking by. This great big dog came out there and she was so my here comes this big dog. My she's coming from the prayer meeting. This teenager and all of a sudden this big dog came running. And right at that moment there just came up. This other presence and this other being I think it was like a German shepherd just came right up there and stood there and that other dog ran away. That was the Lord allowed that to happen. I go before you. The Lord goes before you. Don't worry about next Tuesday, next Wednesday, your bills. What's going to happen with this? Just give that to the Lord right now. just our posture needs to be more like this instead of I got this and we're going to do this and here you you know come up here for a moment a brother and you know sometimes we shake hands we say I'm coming in strong yeah I'm dominating yeah that you're you're dominating we need to come in like this humble ourselves to one another say God bless you brother God bless you this camp may you have a wonderful camp may God fill you and bless your life man he looks nice doesn't heal &gt;&gt; hallelujah bless you [applause] amen Man, hey, but you know, modern business is like, you know, come in strong. Come in with your hand up. That's power, man. I got this. Yeah, man. No, the bride of Christ is God bless you, brother. Have a wonderful camp. May the Lord bless your life. I'm praying for you. Just want you to know that. God bless you. We can do that in in the in 10 minutes when we go to lunch. Instead of everybody just flocking to your friends and everybody went that person sitting over there or that brother, that family, you can just go talk to them a little bit. How you been doing? How's your family? What grade you in in school? You know, God bless you all today. And you can just have a different atmosphere. You understand that? That's the way Jesus is. What song are we singing, Brother Isaac? &gt;&gt; Yes. Let's stand. Let's stand and sing this with brother Isaac in the worship. For have thine own way, Lord. Have thine own way. Thou art the father. [music] I am the mold me and make me. [music] Oh me [singing] and make [music] me after I [singing] [music] while [singing] I am waiting [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Have th I known [music] that change. [singing] Have I known [music] way? [singing] Search me [music] and might [singing] [music] Jesus. [music] [music and singing] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Let's just all bow our heads. Can we sing that song that we did at um I give myself away. I give myself away. I wonder if with our heads bowed if we can just Just pause for a moment in our busy lives, our busy Saturday. We'll never have Saturday morning again like we did this morning. It's the Lord talking [music] to us along the road. May the Lord answer your prayers. You that are calling, you that are crying, you that are burdened. May the Lord answer your prayers, may the Lord give you the desire of his heart and his will be done in the matter and not just what you or I would want but what he knows what is best. That is perfect faith. when we are actually start [music] praying in a channel that it's him praying through us. And yes, we would have liked for sister Christine to never have got in that vehicle. Yes, we would have loved to spare this brother that injury. Yes, we wouldn't want to see this church go through that situation. Yes, we wouldn't want that family to have to deal with that. But the Lord knows. He knows. And there has to be a release in us as sons and daughters of God to say, you know, Lord, and I commit it to you, Lord. Bless our afternoon together. We're going to be with brothers and sisters and some on the internet are going to be logging off in their different countries and places or cities or churches. There's a lot, Lord, that we could say to be critical of things and one another. Even our services, I'm sure if we looked at everything, there would be something. But let us be a mature group of people that are looking for the one, looking for the good. What can we do? How can I be part of the success of these meetings? How can I get into a channel that will unlock the secrets that someone has for years maybe in brokenness, maybe wounded heart and the Lord wants to just deal with that this weekend? Do you have time in your schedule for the Lord to do that and just say, "Lord, yes, Lord. Work on it, Lord. Work on us, Lord. And while you're at it, Lord, work on me. Work on my approach. Work on my spirit. I need help. I need leadership. You are my shepherd. Father, I pray forgiveness for every person that's wandered or went wayward somewhere. Change their heart. Change their mind. Give them a new heart. Give them a new spirit. Give them the Holy Spirit. Just baptize all of us, Lord. Wouldn't it be wonderful, Lord? What kind of meeting could we have this evening? You just come down and baptize all of us just freshly, a new just the love of God, just the that other dimension just hazy, just hazy with the glory of God and angels descending and ascending, coming down and ministering, casting out evil spirits even before the minister even gets here. that by the plane of those instruments, evil spirits could be cast out. That when the minister comes and begins to break the bread of life, it can come down to the heart, to our hearts. Lord, fill us, Lord. We pray for one another. Go after the one today. Go after the one person. Go after that teenager. Go after that sister. Lord, that brother, that man, that child. Our little babies, Lord, need you. Our elder ones need you. We all need you, Lord. I pray for the food that we will eat. I pray for the good health of every person that you would just cause all of us to prosper and be in good health. May there be no sickness and danger and harm come upon any of them. But may we be strong on Monday, Sunday, Monday when we go back home. Let our hearts burn within us that you had such love for us and would speak to us on such a level like this, Lord. I just want to praise your name, Lord. and give my all to you, Lord, in the presence of my brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; What better atmosphere could we be in but the presence of the Lord? Lead us, brother Isaac. Lead us as we turn the service and go to our afternoon in Jesus name. Let's sing this before we go with all our strength. I give myself [singing] [music] away, &gt;&gt; Lord.
