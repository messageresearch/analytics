[22:18] morning
[22:20] [Applause]
[22:22] amen amen Just Praise the Lord we're
[22:24] just going to um slow it down and this
[22:27] is a new song I don't know if people
[22:28] have heard it before you probably have
[22:29] heard it you can start um playing it but
[22:33] it's a very um beautiful song because
[22:36] it's a song about really when you think
[22:38] about it about Redemptive
[22:40] love and and
[22:43] when we get to understand what
[22:45] Redemptive love really is it's the most
[22:48] powerful force in the whole entire world
[22:50] is this Force called Redemptive
[22:54] love and you know
[22:58] we go through our life and there's
[23:01] something in us that wants
[23:03] God whether we know it or not it doesn't
[23:07] matter there's something sitting in us
[23:08] that wants
[23:10] God now we may be brought up in church
[23:12] and understand okay there's a God yeah
[23:14] that's why this is here but then we may
[23:15] not be and we don't know what this thing
[23:17] is but it's in us and we just we want
[23:20] God no matter where we go no matter what
[23:22] we do no matter what situation we find
[23:23] ourselves in there's something in us
[23:25] that just always wants it we're just
[23:27] longing for something
[23:28] we're just longing for it it's just
[23:32] there you know and then there comes a
[23:35] point in time where that thing that we
[23:37] desired so much meets
[23:41] us like there's a response there's a
[23:44] there if there's a if there's a call
[23:46] Desire in here somewhere there's a
[23:48] response somewhere to meet that
[23:51] desire and
[23:53] when God
[23:55] comes and meets that desire
[23:59] what he does is he Woos Us by his
[24:02] [Music]
[24:04] love and he says you know what you had
[24:06] that thing in you all your life like you
[24:07] were wanting something he says you know
[24:10] why that actually is now this is
[24:12] something that happens this is not just
[24:13] a story this this happens he says it's
[24:14] because I have because you're
[24:17] mine you were mine when you were doing
[24:19] anything whatever you were doing all
[24:20] along you were
[24:21] mine and because he's got this
[24:23] Redemptive love that he knows we are his
[24:26] then he does something that he doesn't
[24:27] do for anyone else apart from
[24:31] you and he says I'm going to give you
[24:34] unconditional love in other words I'm
[24:37] all
[24:38] in I'm all
[24:41] in no matter what you do no matter
[24:43] anything I'm all in with my Redemptive
[24:45] love my unconditional love I'm all in no
[24:49] matter what you do you can never never
[24:52] disappoint me you you can never do
[24:53] anything that will cause me to love you
[24:55] less because that thing that's in you
[24:56] I'm going to respond to it cuz your mine
[24:59] and you try you try one time to try
[25:02] and stand against that Force called
[25:05] unconditional love you try it one
[25:08] day now if God had it for everybody then
[25:10] the whole world will be saved but he
[25:11] doesn't he has it for those that are
[25:13] his that unconditional love and you just
[25:16] get overtaken by it and then you worship
[25:19] that's why when you when you're in the
[25:20] tree in the morning you praise God but
[25:22] you're
[25:23] his and and this song in a sense is of
[25:26] response I just want to sing
[25:33] [Music]
[25:44] one I search the
[25:49] world it couldn't F
[25:54] me man's empty praise and treasure
[25:58] F I'll never
[26:08] know and you put me back
[26:14] together every desire is now
[26:19] satisfied hearing your
[26:22] love oh there's

[41:14] glorious Sunshine of Your Word of your
[41:16] presence granted father we love you we
[41:18] thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen
[41:21] amen God bless you friends you can have
[41:23] your seats this morning so I want to
[41:24] talk about blessed of the peacemakers
[41:26] for they shall be called
[41:27] the children of God now a peacemaker is
[41:30] someone I'm just going to jump very
[41:32] quickly to the end and then we'll come
[41:33] back to the start but a peacemaker is
[41:36] one that the life of God shines out of
[41:38] because he's the real Peacemaker right
[41:40] we're not the so so when I'm talking
[41:42] about peacemakers here I'm going to talk
[41:44] more than just someone who brings uh you
[41:46] know humanly an agreement between two
[41:48] people who doesn't like to offend anyone
[41:50] we're going to go far beyond that
[41:51] because there's a real peace that must
[41:53] be made between God and man right and
[41:55] we're part of his Plan of Redemption now
[41:57] I was looking at the um the the
[41:59] definition of um Peacemaker and I was on
[42:03] Webster dictionary and and they said the
[42:05] word of the year is
[42:07] polarization that's the word of the Year
[42:09] 2024 is the year of polarization and we
[42:12] know because the world is falling apart
[42:14] the world will become increasingly more
[42:15] polarized it's not going to become
[42:17] unified uh it's going to be polarized
[42:20] sure you know the Beast will take over
[42:22] the Great Tribulation all those things
[42:23] but it's going to be a polarized world
[42:25] because the world has fallen apart
[42:27] now but we but we don't want to um focus
[42:32] on on that reality but the thing is
[42:34] there's got to be peacemakers in this
[42:36] polarized world there's a people that
[42:38] must be able to be like that person in
[42:40] the middle and it doesn't matter what
[42:41] color represents what there it really
[42:43] doesn't matter but someone who's in the
[42:45] middle of those two polarized groups
[42:47] calling everyone hey come come come come
[42:50] find real peace come from real Unity
[42:53] come under the Holy Ghost come under the
[42:55] word amen come come one with the Lord
[42:58] you'll find a real peace a real Harmony
[43:00] more than just a two people writing an
[43:02] agreement but it's really the blood of
[43:03] Jesus Christ can come and do a work and
[43:05] bring a real peace amen so we we read
[43:08] there that you the um they shall be
[43:10] called the children of God so there's
[43:12] something that man will see and we'll
[43:14] come into that soon but this word called
[43:17] uh it has many different um meanings but
[43:20] it means to Bear a name or a title among
[43:22] men so if you're a if you're a child of
[43:25] God you're bearing a title but you'll be
[43:26] known as a a peacemaker you won't be
[43:28] known as a Rabel Rouser or a
[43:30] Insurrection uh leader or you someone
[43:33] who leads a revolution uh apart from
[43:35] against the devil that's fine you know
[43:37] we can we can cause a lot of Revol we
[43:39] are actually revolutionaries in that
[43:41] regard but when it comes to between God
[43:43] and man we're not you know we're not
[43:45] here to stir up Strife we're here to
[43:47] bring the peace of God into every
[43:49] situation of Our Lives amen so this word
[43:51] Peacemaker got many different many syn
[43:55] whatever that is that s word there and
[43:57] it's similar there we go I haven't done
[43:59] English in a long time anyway it's a
[44:02] mediator it's a negotiator a counselor
[44:04] Ambassador it's many different things
[44:05] and it's attorney it's a middleman we
[44:08] are you know we are uh God wants to use
[44:10] us as as as a middleman between himself
[44:13] and Adam's Fallen race we're actually
[44:15] important in God's plan I trust this
[44:18] Christmas is different it becomes very
[44:20] personal this Christmas it comes a very
[44:22] a very real time because this world the
[44:24] devil's becoming very personal to this
[44:26] world I pray that the Holy Ghost become
[44:28] so personal in our lives that you know
[44:30] it's just such a reality there's such an
[44:31] atmosphere that flows out of our Lives
[44:33] of peace of God and you know when people
[44:35] come into your presence they don't get
[44:36] stirred up more they become calmer don't
[44:39] become more troubled they become more
[44:41] peaceful because because they've stepped
[44:43] into not your presence but the presence
[44:44] of almighty God I me because we're meant
[44:47] to be bearing God's Great Shalom the
[44:49] peace of God is in the bride right so
[44:52] this is this is the peacemakers they
[44:53] call the children of God I trust that's
[44:56] that's what you're known as we're just
[44:57] going to have a bit of a walk through
[44:58] the scripture today you know because we
[45:00] we need to go beyond the devil wants to
[45:02] hide try and Veil God behind tradition
[45:05] or religion or what's expected of us
[45:06] we're going to break through that Veil
[45:08] and break through that veil of just well
[45:10] this is what we do and say Lord I want
[45:11] you to be real in my life sure you may
[45:14] maybe years ago when I first met you you
[45:16] found me you're real but Lord I want you
[45:18] to be more real today I want to be sweet
[45:20] I want to be tender I want to be loving
[45:22] that people don't come to me for an
[45:23] argument maybe they come to vent but hey
[45:25] people do that but you know the venting
[45:27] doesn't go back it actually somehow gets
[45:29] extinguished and there's just this peace
[45:31] and a calm and you maybe it's not even
[45:33] what you say but just the atmosphere you
[45:34] carry causes people to feel they can
[45:37] relax blessed are the peacemakers
[45:39] they'll be called the children of God am
[45:42] amen now this is from the um this is now
[45:46] I need this version of the Bible it's
[45:47] called it's called the uh Bible and in
[45:50] in basic English
[45:52] version I need this I thought this was a
[45:55] bit more clear than the King James or
[45:56] the king James is clear but and and I
[45:58] read that but hey I always have
[46:00] different versions of the Bible in my
[46:01] Esau program right who who who who who
[46:05] does that our man's not here he'd
[46:06] probably say yes he does that but you
[46:09] know but but but sorry okay but now so
[46:13] this is this is the Lord speaking here
[46:14] in Ephesians says but now in Christ
[46:16] Jesus you who were one time were a far
[46:18] off are made nigh in the blood of Christ
[46:21] for he is our peace who has made uh the
[46:24] two into one and by whom the middle wall
[46:26] of Vision has been broken down having in
[46:29] his flesh put an end to that which uh
[46:31] made the division between us even the
[46:33] law with its rules and orders so that he
[46:36] might make it himself of two one new man
[46:38] so making peace so he's The Peacemaker
[46:41] right I put this in because he's The
[46:42] Peacemaker right you got to realize it's
[46:43] not your human ability that can bring
[46:46] peace man's tried to do that for
[46:48] thousands of years and and it's just
[46:49] take one crazy drunk man with too much
[46:52] vodka in a system to push a button and
[46:53] the whole world's going to go up right
[46:56] because they don't understand it's
[46:57] National Spirits fighting that's why
[46:59] where there's division it's actually
[47:01] demon Spirits vying for control right
[47:03] but we want to go beyond that and say
[47:05] Lord we don't want the national Spirit
[47:07] or some Spirit of a movement controlling
[47:08] us we want your Holy Ghost to come and
[47:11] bring peace and Reconciliation that's
[47:13] why the Millennium is going to be a time
[47:14] of Peace because God's going to rule
[47:16] amen but he's got to start somewhere
[47:18] it's got to be in you and I amen the
[47:21] millennium's got to start in here if I
[47:22] can put it that way we right that peace
[47:25] that reign of Peace should be in here
[47:26] first right it has to be so so he's The
[47:30] Peacemaker and that the two might uh
[47:32] come into agreement with God and one
[47:34] body through the cross are putting an
[47:35] end to that Division and he came
[47:37] preaching peace to you which were a far
[47:39] off and to those that were near now I
[47:41] just wanted to put that in there because
[47:43] he has he has broken down the division's
[47:46] over the div the gulf is gone it's been
[47:50] bridged right there's no more you know
[47:52] the devil wants to get us get it into
[47:53] our minds God's so far away
[47:55] somewhere if you think God's distant
[47:58] from you who's talking to you that's not
[48:00] him his word says I'm Nigh I'm closer
[48:02] than your Nick's breath you know I'm
[48:04] present I'll never leave you nor forsake
[48:05] you that's what his word declares so I'd
[48:07] rather take that than the devil tell
[48:09] well God's distant somewhere he's not in
[48:10] my situation God's in your situation God
[48:13] was in your situation in the world God
[48:15] was in your situation when you're in sin
[48:17] God was in your situation when you
[48:18] wanted to quit he says no I'm not
[48:21] letting you go you think you're alone in
[48:23] this but I'm with
[48:25] you many times want to say Lord I'm on
[48:27] your side but he wants you to know he's
[48:29] on your side amen he's here to back you
[48:32] up Hallelujah so the divisions come to
[48:34] an end amen so if there's anything that
[48:37] the devil you know he he loves us to to
[48:40] think no there is a golf but God's
[48:44] Bridge the gulf I like to talk God's
[48:46] language because God's language towards
[48:48] me is very good amen thoughts of Peace
[48:51] I'll come to an expected End Amen so now
[48:54] but you see there's always a battle you
[48:55] got to realize that we don't live by
[48:57] feelings remember this this this being a
[48:59] peacemaker it's not that you feel
[49:01] tranquil all the time and you got some
[49:03] nice kind of nice Vibe going on and
[49:06] everything feels good and you just got
[49:08] your favorite coffee in your hand
[49:09] there's no trouble and now you're at
[49:11] peace no you can you can be in the
[49:12] middle of the biggest
[49:14] storm political storm natural storm
[49:17] whatever storm that's going on your
[49:19] whole world could be in a million pieces
[49:21] going exploding everywh but you going
[49:22] have peace cuz you're cuz The Peacemaker
[49:24] is in you but you see we don't go by
[49:27] those things you got to realize the more
[49:29] you feel distant from God actually
[49:31] you're on the verge of a
[49:32] breakthrough it's very cont vice versa
[49:35] CU we want to feel look I'm ready I'm
[49:37] primed amen but it's actually in those
[49:39] moments that you feel cool and you feel
[49:42] indifferent and you feel like what's the
[49:43] use and why am I even here you're
[49:45] actually on the verge of a breakthrough
[49:47] like a plane going through a sound
[49:49] barrier you're just on that little
[49:50] crucks of a of a buff and you're through
[49:53] Amen brother Braham says this here he
[49:55] says now he says my flesh
[49:57] he's quoting Paul here my flesh always
[49:59] wants to yield to that your flesh does
[50:01] too see but the LW of the spirit of God
[50:03] in the heart overcomes the Flesh and
[50:05] makes the body obey what the heart says
[50:07] do hallelujah look then if that will do
[50:10] that for a sinner then won't that work
[50:12] for sickness to the law of the spirit of
[50:14] God in the heart that knows that by his
[50:16] stripes we were healed they stand with
[50:19] their power and they and make that
[50:21] sickness in that body obey them because
[50:22] it's a devil there you are few that's
[50:25] got cream on it that deep I don't know
[50:27] how but he would have said pretty deep
[50:28] amen God bless you Carrie good to see
[50:30] you here amen trust you had a real good
[50:32] birthday amen God bless you praise the
[50:35] Lord good to see you my friend amen I
[50:38] tell you that's it see now the law of
[50:40] sin and death works in your flesh but
[50:42] the law of the spirit of Life Works in
[50:43] your heart so your heart your spirit and
[50:45] your heart will make your body obey what
[50:47] it says do that's exactly right that's
[50:49] what Paul said always the flesh says I'm
[50:52] too tired I'm unable I'm not sufficient
[50:55] I cannot do it who's had those thoughts
[50:58] I feel indifferent I don't I feel like
[50:59] what's the use I feel this and it's
[51:01] never a positive feeling right but you
[51:04] got to realize that that is actually and
[51:07] well I'll just finish the quote I said
[51:08] to Lois or Dolores or somebody's been
[51:11] talking to me about the Holy Ghost or
[51:12] something or another like that I said uh
[51:14] uh Dolores said what makes me feel that
[51:16] way just at the time that I should
[51:18] should have felt good I said the Devil
[51:21] he's seen you just ready to receive it
[51:23] he said I'll put a little damper on her
[51:24] few found her a little bit you know kind
[51:26] to cool down a little bit see oh my my
[51:29] that's when you rise claim your
[51:30] god-given rights amen that's that's what
[51:33] Paul's meaning see and always when he
[51:35] said when I do good evil is present amen
[51:39] so you got to come so it is a time to
[51:41] rise when you feel distant it's the time
[51:43] to rise am mean when you feel
[51:45] indifferent when you feel cool when you
[51:47] feel tired when you feel like just a
[51:48] thought you know God begins to bless you
[51:50] then a thought comes and blindsides you
[51:52] about someone or something or something
[51:53] got to face tomorrow that's a time to
[51:55] rise it's not a time to actually
[51:57] entertain those feelings you got to
[51:59] realize if you feel IND different you're
[52:01] on the verge of a breakthrough if you're
[52:02] feeling distant you're you're on the
[52:04] verge of a breakthrough you're right
[52:05] there on the crusp of the greatest event
[52:08] that could take place in your life amen
[52:10] and you say well that's very contrary
[52:11] well the reason you're on the verge of a
[52:13] breakthrough is because the devil's
[52:15] trying to stop
[52:16] you amen you say well I don't feel any
[52:19] kind of anointing well that's the time
[52:20] to rise amen cuz his word says he is
[52:24] here we don't go by feelings right we we
[52:26] go by his word his word says he is here
[52:29] that's good enough for me to believe
[52:31] amen if his word says He is present it's
[52:33] as if the same as he physically walked
[52:35] in here Amen in his Natural Body and I
[52:38] touched the Hem of His
[52:39] Garment amen it's it's exact because he
[52:42] and his word are one they're not two
[52:43] different people they're not two
[52:44] different classes his word is no lesser
[52:46] than himself because he is his word so
[52:49] if his word has declared I'll never
[52:51] leave thee nor forsake Thee I say Amen
[52:54] it's time to rise and take God at his
[52:55] word above how you feel I mean if his
[52:58] word says that he we're two or three are
[53:00] gathered in my name there I am in the
[53:01] midst so he's between me and you he's
[53:04] between you and the person next to you
[53:06] he's present am mean if we were just
[53:08] more conscious of the presence of God I
[53:10] think a lot of things would happen amen
[53:13] I think there'd be a lot more
[53:13] breakthrough if we realize the devil
[53:15] makes us feel indifferent because he's
[53:17] afraid we're about to get a breakthrough
[53:19] he actually sees you if we can go back
[53:20] to that he says uh here let's just let's
[53:23] just go back to this see the the Devil
[53:26] he's seen you just ready to receive it
[53:29] so he sees something that maybe you
[53:31] don't even
[53:32] see he's watching in that because he's
[53:34] in that unseen realm too he sees the
[53:37] light of God come into a building like
[53:39] brother RC I see dark streaks running
[53:41] and demons calling for help and all we
[53:43] can't necessarily see those things but
[53:45] we feel the presence of God and when God
[53:48] comes down what's that the place gets
[53:49] real light it's our faith Bank begins to
[53:52] build amen but the Devil Comes trying to
[53:54] put a dam on everyone it's not for you
[53:56] it's not your time well you you don't
[53:59] have a very good week so you don't
[54:00] qualify all these who has those kind of
[54:02] a thoughts I feel unworthy it's not
[54:04] about how you feel it's what God said
[54:06] about you that matters I mean God made
[54:08] me worthy cuz he died for me he didn't
[54:10] even ask me about it he didn't even ask
[54:13] me he didn't even ask my permission do
[54:16] you mind if I purchase your your
[54:18] salvation he just went and did it he
[54:20] didn't ask me permission do you mind if
[54:22] you write if I write your name in the
[54:23] Lamb's Book of Life he didn't ask me
[54:25] permission he just went did it
[54:27] hallelujah praise God so why do we have
[54:30] to ask the devil for
[54:32] permission Hallelujah well I don't feel
[54:35] worthy well that's actually irrelevant
[54:38] what has God
[54:40] done amen see that's the time to rise
[54:44] and claim your god-given rights God said
[54:47] so I take HT your word Lord irrespective
[54:51] of how I feel what I've been going
[54:52] through what I am going through no rise
[54:54] and claim your god-given rights
[54:57] amen but you see now see the devil is
[54:59] not a peacemaker that's pretty obvious
[55:01] right he's he he is the father of lies
[55:05] his Strife problems complexes things
[55:09] that are very murky and Troublesome and
[55:11] all those things that's him that's his
[55:14] job that's what he's that's what he does
[55:17] he is made to block access to God he cuz
[55:20] he's now perverted right so so he was
[55:23] the anointed cherub that cover so what
[55:24] did he do control access to God God
[55:27] right now he's perverted he takes that
[55:29] same position and he tries to stop you
[55:31] coming so if we feel cold different
[55:35] annoyed that's the devil trying to block
[55:37] you you got to say devil get out of my
[55:38] way maybe I just need to labor on this
[55:40] point a while we got to think about
[55:41] these things because we get in our mind
[55:43] we need to be a certain state of being
[55:45] and then I'm ready for a blessing no the
[55:48] two on the way to emus were
[55:49] brokenhearted downcast the world fell
[55:52] apart and brother R said the condition
[55:54] of those two were modern events make
[55:56] clear by prophecy they were a prophecy
[55:58] of modern events and they world had
[56:00] fallen apart everything had gone wrong
[56:01] in their eyes and they're walking to Aus
[56:04] and they are all upset and they
[56:06] misunderstood God fulfilling his word in
[56:08] their day but yet they still talking
[56:10] about Jesus and I think that's the best
[56:12] thing to do talk about him and he'll
[56:14] draw near to you am mean so they're
[56:16] talking about everything they didn't
[56:18] understand it all that's why they were
[56:19] the way they were if they understood
[56:21] what Jesus the Lord had just done they
[56:23] would have been dancing they would have
[56:25] been rejoicing because they would have
[56:27] realized he is the Lamb of God what John
[56:29] said he was he is amen and they would
[56:31] have been rejoicing because he just
[56:32] carried their sins far away Hallelujah
[56:35] and they should have expected the tomb
[56:37] to be empty because he said so so there
[56:40] they are brokenhearted down everything's
[56:42] Fallen apart yet Jesus went with them
[56:44] opened the word to them and then and
[56:46] then what did he do he broke the bread
[56:47] when they got into the house did what he
[56:49] did before the before he died did it
[56:51] again after he rose right to open their
[56:53] eyes to make them realize hey how you
[56:56] feel did not stop my me visiting you how
[57:00] you feel what you're thinking your mood
[57:02] your actions did not stop me walking
[57:05] with you and revealing myself to you
[57:07] Hallelujah why because they were part of
[57:10] the Resurrection
[57:12] also how was Legion did Legion deserve a
[57:17] blessing there he was in the tombs I'm
[57:20] just going to go because you got to
[57:21] think about it we think about I'm
[57:22] unworthy I'm not in a good State he was
[57:24] in a terrible state he was in a far
[57:26] worse State than all of us combined
[57:28] times
[57:29] 100,000 right but yet Jesus said I need
[57:32] to go across the sea how about the woman
[57:34] at the well she broke the word and she
[57:37] broke the word and she was living in sin
[57:39] but yet God said I need to go by the way
[57:40] of
[57:42] Samaria think about it so let's get it
[57:45] out of our heads I'm unworthy no the
[57:48] Lord has made me
[57:50] worthy it's his decision but you see so
[57:52] a peacemaker will always look at those
[57:54] kind of things because it's the devil
[57:56] trying to put trouble in your mind it's
[57:58] not for me I can't receive it I'm not
[58:01] worthy that's the devil putting that
[58:03] that's the devil's language cuz he's not
[58:05] worthy there's no blood for
[58:08] him
[58:11] anyway now where are we
[58:15] here there was a peacemaker in non's
[58:18] house blessed are the peacemakers
[58:20] they'll be called the children of God
[58:23] and she was a peacemaker because she did
[58:24] not let her past make her a person of
[58:28] strife there she was she was a she was a
[58:31] slave she was taken captive by Israel's
[58:34] enemy now she's working for uh non's
[58:37] wife and you know isn't it amazing where
[58:39] it says in verse three there and you
[58:40] know because she finds out that non's a
[58:42] leper and she says to her master's wife
[58:44] if only my Lord would go to the prophet
[58:46] in Samaria he'd be made well make him
[58:48] well but notice it wasn't non's wife
[58:51] that told nonon about it and then
[58:53] someone went and said to his Lord so
[58:55] obviously her words the atmosphere she
[58:58] carried it wasn't negative it wasn't
[59:00] bitter it wasn't resentful it wasn't
[59:02] vengeful cuz that's not a peacemaker no
[59:05] she had the peace of God something
[59:07] obviously when she was young something
[59:08] anchored in her heart Jehovah's God
[59:10] everywhere he'll he'll see you through
[59:13] doesn't matter what happens in life
[59:14] honey you you're going to be all right
[59:15] because God's with you do you realize
[59:17] I'm a daughter of Abraham even in a
[59:19] foreign land God was with her amen so
[59:22] she began to testify if only my Lord
[59:24] would have been been you know could go
[59:26] to the prophet in Samaria which is an
[59:28] enemy country by the way but you see
[59:30] obviously her words her the atmosphere
[59:33] she carried made her Words Be weighty Be
[59:36] impactful and I pray that our words are
[59:38] impactful to those who come around us
[59:40] even those who not even Christians
[59:42] especially those who aren't Christians
[59:44] but our words would carry weight they'd
[59:46] want to hear something from you because
[59:47] the atmosphere that because you're a
[59:49] peacemaker the atmosphere of God's
[59:51] flowing through amen that your words
[59:53] sure we can joke and justest and have
[59:55] fun whatever more more but when it comes
[59:56] to serious things that come under the
[59:59] influence of what you're saying like
[1:00:02] they did here she is a little Israelite
[1:00:05] girl not even doesn't have the Holy
[1:00:08] Ghost like we do doesn't have the blood
[1:00:09] of Jesus Christ like we do doesn't have
[1:00:11] all the Mysteries revealed like we do
[1:00:13] but yet she just had a she was a
[1:00:16] peacemaker but you see
[1:00:19] now so then of course you know the um
[1:00:22] someone says to his Lord which is non
[1:00:23] and you know what the girl from the land
[1:00:25] of Israel ISS and obviously you know the
[1:00:28] um king of Syria your name goes to the
[1:00:30] king of Syria king of Syria writes a
[1:00:31] letter gives him a lot of gold and
[1:00:33] silver and all these things and changes
[1:00:35] of clothes and then and then and then
[1:00:37] they go to the king of Israel now the
[1:00:39] king of Israel at this time um I just
[1:00:42] did a I just did a bit of a Google was
[1:00:44] uh jehoram which was the son of Ahab now
[1:00:48] he wasn't a this King was not a
[1:00:50] peacemaker cuz you see how he responded
[1:00:53] because he's a political you know
[1:00:54] someone who's political is not a
[1:00:56] peacemaker they're looking for Advantage
[1:00:58] they're looking to see how can this deal
[1:01:00] work in my favor what can I get out of
[1:01:02] this relationship what can I get out of
[1:01:04] this conversation what can I get see
[1:01:06] that's a political thing how does this
[1:01:08] reflect on me but a peacemaker doesn't
[1:01:10] care about how things reflect they just
[1:01:12] want the peace of God to flow they want
[1:01:14] to see everyone be benefited by the
[1:01:16] presence of God yep is that how you want
[1:01:19] your life to be I trust it is some of
[1:01:20] you looking at me like no I I trust it
[1:01:22] turns into a yes maybe you're thinking I
[1:01:24] I hope so are we here today hello
[1:01:26] everyone class I know school's finished
[1:01:28] for some but you know anyway this is not
[1:01:30] a lecture hall but you know what I mean
[1:01:32] we're focused right amen so you see now
[1:01:35] but you see he wasn't a peacemaker
[1:01:37] because his first reaction was he
[1:01:39] thought has this King come to pick a
[1:01:41] quarrel with me has he actually just
[1:01:43] done this whole thing to fight me you
[1:01:44] know this is see see a peacemaker just
[1:01:47] thinks
[1:01:48] peace right someone who's not a
[1:01:50] peacemaker just thinks fighting and
[1:01:52] fussing and arguing and all those things
[1:01:55] you know said you has he come to send a
[1:01:57] fight with me and you see his
[1:01:59] overreaction with the you know you know
[1:02:01] reads the letter and he just Rin his
[1:02:03] clothes and says am I a God to kill and
[1:02:05] make alive imagine this guy sitting in
[1:02:07] his throne room all of his court there
[1:02:09] and people he just reads this letter and
[1:02:12] throws a big hissy fit he's causing
[1:02:14] trouble to come into his cabinet cuz
[1:02:16] he's not a peacemaker re you rents his
[1:02:19] clothes makes a big scene why because
[1:02:22] he's not he's not a peacemaker he's
[1:02:24] thinking about his advantage what's
[1:02:26] going to happen here but Elisha just
[1:02:28] basically says to him you know because
[1:02:29] Elisha was a peacemaker because he
[1:02:31] tabernacled the Living God who's the
[1:02:33] source of all peace right and basically
[1:02:36] he asked him the question why do you
[1:02:37] overact like this send him to me and you
[1:02:40] know uh he'll know if there's a prophet
[1:02:42] in Israel or not remember leprosy had
[1:02:45] never been healed up to this moment but
[1:02:48] you see Elisha was a peacemaker just
[1:02:50] relax man basically don't don't get
[1:02:52] worked up about nothing there is a God
[1:02:54] in Israel actually the God I know
[1:02:57] prophesied of the Doom of your father
[1:02:59] why didn't you serve him amen the god
[1:03:02] the God that I serve brought fired out
[1:03:04] on Mount carel he this guy was this King
[1:03:06] was probably alive when that
[1:03:08] happened but you see and Elisha would
[1:03:11] have no doubt just just be reconciled to
[1:03:13] God don't don't don't overreact don't
[1:03:15] make a mountain out of a mole hill is it
[1:03:18] really that bad well you don't know what
[1:03:21] the you no just
[1:03:23] relax you see the thing is because
[1:03:26] Elisha was reflecting heaven jehoram was
[1:03:31] not and brother bam says in a prisoner I
[1:03:34] trust we all listen to the message of
[1:03:35] the week he says the physical has to die
[1:03:38] if but if you're reflecting by your
[1:03:39] mortal life the light of heaven then
[1:03:41] you're reflecting the eternal life God
[1:03:44] then when you die you can no more than
[1:03:46] go to that light amen if you're
[1:03:49] reflecting Heaven you have to go that's
[1:03:51] what he's saying if the life of God is
[1:03:53] in your life there's only one place you
[1:03:55] can go I trust that makes makes me happy
[1:03:57] just saying it amen so so if your if
[1:04:00] your life is reflecting God then to God
[1:04:02] you shall go but if your life is not
[1:04:05] reflecting God to God you shall not go
[1:04:08] well how do you reflect the light of God
[1:04:10] repent be baptized the name of Jesus
[1:04:11] Christ for remission of sin you shall
[1:04:13] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:04:15] he says but if you're of the Dark World
[1:04:17] you reflect that and you can do and go
[1:04:19] no other way but to Darkness SE so we
[1:04:21] are in a reflection and we see that just
[1:04:24] as sure as the Holy Ghost reflect
[1:04:25] reflects light and life so does death
[1:04:28] reflect
[1:04:29] Darkness but we're the children of the
[1:04:32] light see I think sometimes like brother
[1:04:34] bam said in the same message he says
[1:04:37] sometimes I believe one of the great
[1:04:38] things I find in this day is the lack of
[1:04:40] sincerity of what we believe it's not
[1:04:42] the fact we believe it but the lack of
[1:04:44] sincerity sincerity in it are we really
[1:04:47] sin because we're all believers here
[1:04:48] right we're all enti message Believers
[1:04:51] we believe the whole word of God Yep
[1:04:54] this this is why we've gathered but but
[1:04:56] do we sincerely believe what what we
[1:04:59] have is there a sincerity a reverence a
[1:05:02] thankfulness or we just do we just take
[1:05:04] it for granted I trust we don't I just
[1:05:07] you it's like Christmas is very much for
[1:05:08] granted it wasn't to the wise men or his
[1:05:10] brother Isaac said the Shepherds it
[1:05:12] wasn't just another day for them it was
[1:05:14] a it was a very glorious day they had a
[1:05:17] supernatural visitation I doubt very
[1:05:19] much they ever got away from those kind
[1:05:21] of moments amen because maybe the next
[1:05:23] night they were out in the field they
[1:05:24] would have talked about it and the next
[1:05:25] night and they would have become known
[1:05:27] as the those Shepherds who walk through
[1:05:29] Bethlehem and called a big caused a big
[1:05:31] tumult to to happen because they're
[1:05:33] telling hey messiah's on earth now but
[1:05:36] they were peacemakers they were there to
[1:05:37] announce that Messiah was on Earth that
[1:05:40] there' be peace between God and man
[1:05:42] Hallelujah so it wasn't just another day
[1:05:45] but I say sadly for many Christmas has
[1:05:47] just become another thing on the
[1:05:48] calendar let's not make it another thing
[1:05:50] on the calendar this year sure we'll
[1:05:52] give gifts and do all those things but
[1:05:53] let's not M it m it mean more to us now
[1:05:57] than it ever has in our entire lives
[1:05:59] I've received God's WAP gift of eternal
[1:06:02] life Hallelujah and I haven't just been
[1:06:04] caught up in the rapping I've got the
[1:06:05] package on the inside Hallelujah so I
[1:06:08] trust that we you know that we do not
[1:06:11] lack sincerity of what we believe that
[1:06:14] God is on the earth now we know
[1:06:17] physically he'll come but his spirit's
[1:06:20] here he's in you and I I trust he is I
[1:06:23] pray he is today he's living in us amen
[1:06:26] we've been restored back to the true
[1:06:28] word of God we're not living under
[1:06:30] Creeds and dogmas no more where God is
[1:06:32] bound God has become Unbound the message
[1:06:35] of the hour releases the Holy Ghost
[1:06:36] among the people I trust we sincerely
[1:06:38] believe that I mean we''re been restored
[1:06:40] back to the book of Acts again
[1:06:42] hallelujah amen we've arrived amen we're
[1:06:45] not getting back there we've got back
[1:06:47] there we're living in the fullness of
[1:06:48] the blessings of God
[1:06:52] hallelujah
[1:06:53] amen praise the Lord I sorry if I get
[1:06:56] happy I'm happy okay these things are
[1:06:58] good amen now you see James see see
[1:07:01] James would speak about because you
[1:07:02] blessed are the
[1:07:05] um uh in Matthew sorry blessed are the
[1:07:07] peacemakers they'll be called the
[1:07:08] children of God so being being the
[1:07:10] children of God is because your faith is
[1:07:13] seen uh in your life right so when James
[1:07:17] and Paul in the Book of Romans would
[1:07:19] speak about Abraham James is uh James
[1:07:22] justifies Abraham by his works right we
[1:07:25] know that okay but then when but then
[1:07:28] when Paul writes about the life of of of
[1:07:31] Abraham Abraham was justified by faith
[1:07:34] okay now we understand that this is not
[1:07:36] a contradiction they're not
[1:07:38] contradicting they're not arguing
[1:07:40] actually because it's like Faith see
[1:07:42] being justified by faith is because God
[1:07:44] sees your faith right but being
[1:07:46] justified by works is because man sees
[1:07:48] your life your works okay so so James is
[1:07:52] writing from the perspective of what man
[1:07:54] sees works right but then uh Paul in
[1:07:58] Romans is writing from what God sees
[1:08:00] Faith
[1:08:01] Revelation okay so the two actually
[1:08:03] blend together because remember blessed
[1:08:05] are the peacemakers they'll be called
[1:08:06] the children of God so people should see
[1:08:09] and I'm sure they actually do see that
[1:08:11] we are the children of God there's
[1:08:12] something different about them by the
[1:08:14] atmosphere they carry the things they
[1:08:16] speak about and do and so on he says my
[1:08:19] work shows my faith see now what you're
[1:08:22] speaking of your faith is what God sees
[1:08:24] in you and your works is what the other
[1:08:26] people see in you that's for difference
[1:08:28] between James and Paul here explaining
[1:08:30] about Abraham they never contradicted
[1:08:32] one another they was both the same
[1:08:34] married so is faith that doesn't produce
[1:08:36] Works anyone has a right to doubt your
[1:08:38] testimony now do you hear it before we
[1:08:40] start the prayer line if your faith
[1:08:42] doesn't produce works with it you can't
[1:08:44] make uh anyone believe that you're
[1:08:46] healed see well I don't know see yeah
[1:08:48] yeah sure I've got all the faith in the
[1:08:50] world you don't because if you had you
[1:08:51] got faith then the works is married to
[1:08:54] Faith your husband and wife one
[1:08:56] identifies the other so when people see
[1:08:59] you're a Believer you don't need to tell
[1:09:00] them you're a Christian cuz your life
[1:09:04] declares who you
[1:09:06] are amen are we are we together he says
[1:09:09] also in the prisoner he says now don't
[1:09:12] judge your life by how much power how
[1:09:13] much uh you have to perform Miracles and
[1:09:16] we don't judge ourselves by how much
[1:09:17] knowledge we have of the word but always
[1:09:19] judge yourself look back and take
[1:09:21] inventory of what kind of a fruit the
[1:09:23] life you presently live now is bearing
[1:09:26] so is it bearing Joy love peace long you
[1:09:31] you're the fruits of the spirit as your
[1:09:33] life bearing that right or is it bearing
[1:09:36] strife and envy and Malice and
[1:09:38] bitterness and resentment all these
[1:09:40] things what is our what are our lives
[1:09:42] producing I I believe it's producing the
[1:09:45] fruits of the spirit amen see we are the
[1:09:49] light of the world I'm just going
[1:09:50] through these things see we Jesus said
[1:09:53] it's like a candle cannot be hidden
[1:09:55] under a bushel or a city can't be hid
[1:09:57] you know you you know it's placed on a
[1:09:59] hill that it cannot be hid so let your
[1:10:00] light so shine before men that they may
[1:10:02] see your good works and glorify your
[1:10:04] father which is in heaven so people
[1:10:05] would see glorify God these people are
[1:10:08] your children God they are peacemakers
[1:10:11] God they are you know they're different
[1:10:13] to everyone else they''re been built
[1:10:14] Lord you've changed them that now
[1:10:16] they're peacemakers they were once in
[1:10:18] strife and under their family spirits
[1:10:20] and doing what their family did but Lord
[1:10:21] You've transformed them Lord they
[1:10:24] they're a different kind of a people
[1:10:25] they're like you
[1:10:28] amen praise the Lord because we've got a
[1:10:30] glorious message to share in this
[1:10:33] day amen
[1:10:35] now um in the in the Book of Leviticus
[1:10:39] there's the there's the law of the uh um
[1:10:42] when there's a sacrifice when a plague
[1:10:43] when there's a plague of leprosy that it
[1:10:46] be healed in the leper there's a there's
[1:10:47] a sacrifice to be given he says then
[1:10:50] shall the priest command to take for
[1:10:52] him uh so so that he be cleansed two
[1:10:55] birds alive and clean Seward scarlet and
[1:10:57] hsip and the priest shall command that
[1:10:59] one of the birds be killed in an earth
[1:11:01] and vessel over running water and as for
[1:11:04] the living bird he shall take it and the
[1:11:05] seedar wood and the scarlet and the hisp
[1:11:07] and shall dip them and the living bird
[1:11:09] and the blood of the bird that was
[1:11:10] killed over the running water and he
[1:11:12] shall sprinkle upon him that uh that is
[1:11:14] to be cleansed from the leprosy seven
[1:11:16] times and shall pronounce him clean and
[1:11:18] shall let the living bird loose into the
[1:11:21] open field now we know leprosy is a type
[1:11:23] of sin right and
[1:11:26] peacemakers God uses peacemakers to
[1:11:28] remove leprosy out of people's lives sin
[1:11:31] right this this is what real peacemakers
[1:11:33] do amen God lives through them that the
[1:11:36] peace of God will come into their lives
[1:11:37] they'll surrender their lives to God and
[1:11:39] that what they are cleansed from that
[1:11:41] leprosy of sin amen so we so so this uh
[1:11:45] sacrifice here is there's there's
[1:11:47] there's two birds right two doves and
[1:11:51] they're the same type of animal same
[1:11:52] type of bird one is killed and the the
[1:11:55] blood of the Dead one is put on the
[1:11:57] living one right and then that living
[1:11:59] one fly is is is released into an open
[1:12:02] field and then what happens is the blood
[1:12:04] of the Dead mate now bathes the Earth as
[1:12:07] it flies right because we're carrying
[1:12:10] we're carrying the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:12:12] right he was the dead bird he was the
[1:12:13] dead mate he was killed that down
[1:12:15] Calvary right but then his life was
[1:12:17] released and it came on to the Apostles
[1:12:20] of the 120 in the upper room right and
[1:12:22] then what happened the dove begin to fly
[1:12:25] amen now now that same experience
[1:12:27] happens to you and I amen we're not
[1:12:29] carrying see see the dead the dead mate
[1:12:31] it wasn't it wasn't um carrying its uh
[1:12:35] its own life it wasn't bathing the the
[1:12:39] Earth in its own life right or its own
[1:12:41] Humanity its own ideas it was bathing
[1:12:44] the Earth in the blood of its dead mate
[1:12:47] right so when when people come into our
[1:12:49] presence I trust they come into the
[1:12:51] presence of almighty God they don't get
[1:12:53] caught up in our Humanity they don't get
[1:12:55] caught up in us and try and try and
[1:12:58] replicate us but they get caught up in
[1:13:00] the presence of the one amen that's
[1:13:02] coming out of us
[1:13:05] hallelujah am mean you see uh Noah would
[1:13:08] Noah would release a dove out of the Ark
[1:13:12] and there came a point where the Dove
[1:13:14] came back with an olive leaf and then a
[1:13:16] few days after that he um you know uh
[1:13:20] released it again and it didn't return
[1:13:22] but when the Dove came back with the
[1:13:23] olive leaf it was symbolized izing to
[1:13:25] know that the waters were abated from
[1:13:27] off the Earth so the wrath of God was
[1:13:30] going away the Judgment was going away
[1:13:33] amen and that and that Dove now we know
[1:13:36] a dove represents peace right it's a
[1:13:39] symbol of peace a dove a dove with a
[1:13:42] olive branch in its mouth is a symbol of
[1:13:44] peace around the world not just in
[1:13:46] Christian circles but around the world
[1:13:48] and we know uh you a um a olive tree it
[1:13:52] represents Victory according to google
[1:13:54] amen it also represents you know oil we
[1:13:57] know olive oil represents the anointing
[1:13:58] or the anointed ones amen so this
[1:14:01] Dovewood this Dovewood uh was returning
[1:14:03] to Noah as a sign that he was about to
[1:14:06] step into a new world the time of
[1:14:09] waiting in the ark was over amen the
[1:14:11] water was AB the the Judgment of God was
[1:14:13] going down and and Noah was about to
[1:14:15] step into a new world it was a very
[1:14:17] different world to the one he stepped
[1:14:19] out of when he stepped into the ark it
[1:14:21] was all different right so it was a
[1:14:23] symbol of uh uh that he would know he
[1:14:26] was about to go into a new world and so
[1:14:28] now we are if if Christ was the Dead one
[1:14:31] and we are the living one right us us in
[1:14:34] this age is a symbol to this world that
[1:14:37] we're about to step into a
[1:14:39] millennium amen we are we are a symbol
[1:14:42] to this world the Millennium is going to
[1:14:44] come soon amen praise the lord well
[1:14:48] that's how I see it anyway why because
[1:14:50] God is God his bride ready remember the
[1:14:53] tribulation can't fall into till the
[1:14:55] bride's all learning up right nothing
[1:14:58] sure there's a lot of saber rattling a
[1:15:00] lot of trouble on the Earth but nothing
[1:15:02] can happen until the bride is gone and
[1:15:05] its fullness right that they can have
[1:15:08] their threats they can say we're going
[1:15:09] to Nuke the world Putin can say what he
[1:15:11] wants to say and whatever whatever but
[1:15:13] nothing can happen until that bride is
[1:15:17] gone so we're actually a symbol to this
[1:15:19] world there's a new world coming and
[1:15:22] also we're a living symbol saying you
[1:15:24] can come to
[1:15:26] amen why because we're the peacemakers
[1:15:29] the peacemakers in US amen praise the
[1:15:33] Lord hallelujah what are we doing Flying
[1:15:35] upon this Earth bathing it with the
[1:15:37] blood of Jesus Christ the life not our
[1:15:40] own life but the life of our dead
[1:15:45] mate even even as Malachi would say but
[1:15:48] but un you that fear uh my name shall
[1:15:50] the son of righteousness arise with
[1:15:51] healing in his wings and you shall go
[1:15:53] forth and grow up as calves of the stall
[1:15:56] amen well where is the healing in his
[1:15:57] wings where is that healing it is is he
[1:16:00] in US you can pray for people are not
[1:16:03] even Christians and God can answer your
[1:16:04] prayers what healing can come to people
[1:16:07] I mean that's why prayer requests come
[1:16:08] in do they not pray for me I'm going
[1:16:10] through this or this is happening what
[1:16:11] and then healing can come through the
[1:16:13] body God can work through the body to
[1:16:15] each is this okay some people get a bit
[1:16:17] funny when you talk about God working
[1:16:19] through his body God's always work
[1:16:20] through his body not saying this here
[1:16:22] but that camera goes to a lot of places
[1:16:24] people clip out things and whatever more
[1:16:26] anyway they can do that for that one but
[1:16:27] you see we to realize that you know God
[1:16:30] works through his body amen so where's
[1:16:32] that healing going to arise it's from
[1:16:33] the Holy Ghost in his people am
[1:16:41] amen the Lord would say that his
[1:16:43] Heritage is as unto me a speckled bird
[1:16:46] brother BR would say that that speckled
[1:16:47] bird is that dove that's been dipped in
[1:16:49] the blood of its dead mate but that's
[1:16:51] his Heritage that's his that's the place
[1:16:53] he lives that's his heirloom amen see
[1:16:55] we're not just here um see if we are
[1:16:58] peacemakers which we are The Peacemaker
[1:17:01] is in us I know I'm repeating myself a
[1:17:02] bit but I'm just coming to the end of
[1:17:04] this just now we're going to we're going
[1:17:06] to we're going to pull
[1:17:07] over amen you
[1:17:10] see trying to find where I am
[1:17:14] here God wants to make us as doves we're
[1:17:18] all born with a actually a a dove nature
[1:17:20] on the inside but it's asleep it's
[1:17:22] dormant and we all have this Crow nature
[1:17:24] here
[1:17:25] am me that that we're born
[1:17:28] with he says now he says that a
[1:17:34] dove a dove don't even have to take a
[1:17:36] bath there's doves that there's doves
[1:17:39] that have a they they they secrete an
[1:17:41] oil that just keeps them clean the whole
[1:17:44] time amen there's actually something
[1:17:45] from the inside that cleanses their
[1:17:47] lives they don't have to take a bath oh
[1:17:50] Hallelujah a Dove's body because uh he
[1:17:52] is a dove he got oil that comes through
[1:17:55] his feathers that just keeps him clean
[1:17:57] all the time because it comes from the
[1:17:59] inside out amen so this peace that that
[1:18:02] comes out of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:18:03] is not a manufactured piece there's a
[1:18:06] life like a dove that can get dirty but
[1:18:07] there's a secretion of oil that pushes
[1:18:09] that dirt off their bodies pushes it off
[1:18:11] their feathers am mean why because it
[1:18:12] comes from the inside out it's the same
[1:18:14] thing with us friends the Holy Ghost
[1:18:16] pushes out am mean sure there's a lot of
[1:18:18] dust and dirt and things to the world
[1:18:20] that we find ourselves honestly you know
[1:18:22] we step into accidentally but that oil
[1:18:25] on the inside cleans us of it
[1:18:28] hallelujah amen and you know that you
[1:18:30] know and like brother BR would say that
[1:18:32] you know we're a
[1:18:34] special a dove is a special built bird
[1:18:36] he says a crow and a dove cannot talk
[1:18:38] together a crow can eat of the old dead
[1:18:41] carcass a dove and one uh uh is one bird
[1:18:43] without gall if it would eat the dead
[1:18:45] carcass it would kill it it's a special
[1:18:47] built bird a dos and a dove only eats
[1:18:50] grain he has no Gall he could not digest
[1:18:53] it so as a Christian has no all of
[1:18:55] bitterness in them see there was once a
[1:18:57] time we could eat the dead things of the
[1:18:59] world we could snack on them and get fat
[1:19:01] on those things but when God comes in
[1:19:03] and changes our nature to be that of a
[1:19:05] dove those same things make us
[1:19:07] sick right makes us feel troubled makes
[1:19:10] us feel very uneasy before it didn't
[1:19:11] make us feel uneasy we enjoyed it right
[1:19:14] but then when God changes our nature
[1:19:16] because we become a peacemaker right
[1:19:18] there's something in us we can't eat off
[1:19:19] those things anymore Hallelujah why
[1:19:21] because we become a special built bird
[1:19:24] there's nothing in that can digest it
[1:19:27] amen makes us feel we just can't see see
[1:19:31] see there's some people that live and
[1:19:33] only seem to thrive in drama we all know
[1:19:36] some people like that I say that's not a
[1:19:38] peacemaker we should be very peaceful
[1:19:41] people we don't like I don't do drama
[1:19:43] that's me personally you know maybe I'm
[1:19:45] boring I don't know but I like I like
[1:19:47] things that just
[1:19:48] calm
[1:19:50] collected not drama nothing like that
[1:19:53] you know I I I think peacemakers don't
[1:19:55] like drama they don't like trouble you
[1:19:58] know some people like especially who
[1:20:00] thrive in drama they feel uh you know
[1:20:02] they seem like they're half asleep until
[1:20:03] drama comes into their life it's like
[1:20:05] something's just like pumped into them
[1:20:07] they come alive and awaken they start
[1:20:09] going why because drama's you know but
[1:20:12] you know it's like a drug to them some
[1:20:14] people they love you know they love
[1:20:16] Gossip they love to chew it over and
[1:20:18] spread it around and they seem actually
[1:20:20] half asleep until until gossip comes in
[1:20:23] one ear they be spread you know they
[1:20:25] come alive oh did you hear this did you
[1:20:27] hear that before that they just kind of
[1:20:29] you know are you he the you are you here
[1:20:31] are you alive but when they hear why
[1:20:32] because but that's the thing is they've
[1:20:34] still got a g that that they enjoy those
[1:20:37] things I don't like hearing
[1:20:39] gossip I don't Thrive gospel is not
[1:20:42] something I like to
[1:20:43] hear amen but you see it's but you see
[1:20:46] it's a that's not a peacemaker because
[1:20:49] gossip is like a was it a sulfuric acid
[1:20:52] it's very it's terrible stuff Burns
[1:20:54] everything comes in touch with amen but
[1:20:56] you know they you know people who have
[1:20:58] still chewing on those things and enjoy
[1:21:00] them they seem to only come alive when
[1:21:02] they you know get animated when they
[1:21:04] talk about the world or you know some
[1:21:06] people only really get animated when
[1:21:07] they talk about what they used to be in
[1:21:10] the world it's like their thing they
[1:21:12] love talking about they love to be and
[1:21:14] sadly it's because they're still proud
[1:21:15] about what they were I'm not proud of
[1:21:17] what I was I'm very thankful I'm not
[1:21:19] that guy anymore I'm very very thankful
[1:21:22] I never want to go back to being him
[1:21:24] right but some people thrive about you
[1:21:26] know they really come alive when they
[1:21:28] talk about what they were I think sadly
[1:21:30] that Dove nature hasn't come in yet
[1:21:33] nothing wrong with sharing
[1:21:34] testimony right but you know what I mean
[1:21:37] he some people just really Thrive
[1:21:38] talking about what they were well they
[1:21:41] still got that gal they're still you
[1:21:42] know enjoying those things you know
[1:21:44] their are their identity is still in
[1:21:47] that F memories of what they were but so
[1:21:50] so they're not peacemakers
[1:21:53] yet see it's all the dead carcass that
[1:21:55] the Christian can't feed on and
[1:21:58] enjoy some people thrive when there's a
[1:22:01] cause to fight
[1:22:02] against right they need some it's like a
[1:22:05] pball or something they they have to
[1:22:06] fight something who's ever come across
[1:22:08] those kind of Bill they're not
[1:22:10] peacemakers they need some kind of
[1:22:11] dragon to slay they need some kind of
[1:22:14] someone to shoot or I don't know they
[1:22:16] just need to they only come but that's
[1:22:18] not a peacemaker that's a warmonger
[1:22:21] that's a mercenary someone who needs to
[1:22:23] you know you say well you know and and
[1:22:26] it's like you know their fire goes out
[1:22:27] when they don't have an enemy some kind
[1:22:30] of controversial thing to fan or feed or
[1:22:32] whatever
[1:22:34] more but you see but then you may ask
[1:22:37] the question well think about it you
[1:22:39] know but don't we have a real enemy to
[1:22:41] fight does not our cause against the
[1:22:42] devil identify us it doesn't actually
[1:22:46] our identity is in the word of God he
[1:22:48] just gets in the way right I'm not
[1:22:52] identified by my fight against the de
[1:22:54] Vil that's not my defining thing my
[1:22:58] defining thing is I'm a Child of God I'm
[1:23:00] a Son of God I've been birthed by his
[1:23:02] word I've be made in His image he
[1:23:04] identifies me the devil just gets in my
[1:23:07] way actually the devil's actually a tool
[1:23:09] in God's hand to bring me closer to
[1:23:11] God Amen I think you know if some people
[1:23:14] some people get very intense about what
[1:23:16] the devil could do to them and they get
[1:23:18] fixed say the devil can do this and he
[1:23:19] may do this and he's on my case here if
[1:23:22] they just took that same intensity and
[1:23:24] put on to the word of God and how great
[1:23:26] God is and how powerful he is and how
[1:23:28] able he is and how Almighty he is he's
[1:23:30] The Undefeated Undisputed champion of
[1:23:32] the world if they put that intensity
[1:23:34] that fixation upon God Revival would
[1:23:36] break out amen incredible things would
[1:23:39] happen so I think let's not be fixated
[1:23:41] the devil does not make me who I am God
[1:23:44] makes me who I am amen he makes me who I
[1:23:48] am not the devil his word says who I am
[1:23:54] so my my identity is not caught up in
[1:23:55] whatever the devil will do no it's who
[1:23:59] what God has made me to
[1:24:01] be
[1:24:03] Hallelujah see it comes there's no
[1:24:06] busness there's no none of those
[1:24:08] things see it comes from the inside out
[1:24:12] not from the outside in it's a birth he
[1:24:14] says bless God I go to church the same
[1:24:16] as you Hallelujah my church is as good
[1:24:17] as yours hallelujah we're just oh you
[1:24:19] Buzzard that's right but a dove is oiled
[1:24:21] from the inside there's certain gland in
[1:24:23] the Dove that's not and and one other
[1:24:25] bird like it like a dove or a pige
[1:24:27] pigeon he oils himself pardon me he
[1:24:30] keeps himself clean all the time he
[1:24:31] don't have to keep himself clean there's
[1:24:33] something on the inside of him that
[1:24:35] keeps him clean Oh Sister way Hallelujah
[1:24:37] something inside of him keeps him clean
[1:24:40] amen I trust that's the same with you
[1:24:42] and our friends this morning there's the
[1:24:44] Holy Ghost is just oozing
[1:24:46] out that keeps us clean busness tries to
[1:24:50] come along it may land but it doesn't
[1:24:52] Stick It Gets pushed out am mean
[1:24:55] disappointments come but it can't stick
[1:24:57] it gets pushed out gossip comes along it
[1:25:00] may try and come in but doesn't stick it
[1:25:03] gets pushed out amen Strife comes along
[1:25:05] I'm just repeating myself but I want you
[1:25:07] to really you know whatever the devil
[1:25:08] tries to put on you it can't stay
[1:25:10] because there's a force on the inside
[1:25:12] that's far greater than your Humanity
[1:25:14] your arguments your logic your thinking
[1:25:16] whatever is going on that pushes those
[1:25:18] things out hallelujah hallelujah why
[1:25:22] because we've received the nature of the
[1:25:24] dove of God Jesus Christ himself
[1:25:28] Hallelujah that we can be called the
[1:25:31] children of
[1:25:33] God Amen I'm just going to finish there
[1:25:36] but I want to ask you the question this
[1:25:37] morning are you a
[1:25:40] peacemaker or are you a Strife
[1:25:44] stirer what a you know your life if you
[1:25:48] could look at you you know through
[1:25:50] someone else's eyes what would they see
[1:25:53] a sweet humble loving Christian that
[1:25:56] just loves the Lord in spite of what
