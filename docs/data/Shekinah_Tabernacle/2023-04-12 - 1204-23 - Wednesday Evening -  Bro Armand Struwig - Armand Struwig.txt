out of the way Lord you know how nervous I get with these things father and I pray that every brother and sister in this church and even online Lord may they receive their blessing tonight in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen man we've been through the Ring of thank you musicians call it multitasking I can tell you now amen but you know what we didn't let the devil win we are here amen let's turn our Bibles to numbers 21 5 we're going to go to verse 5. and uh we're gonna just start there tonight so we just jump straight into the word I pray our pastor would feel better and his wife I hear he was really sick and I know there's a lot of them that was sick brother Ben we're praying for you we hope you you get really better really soon it's not nice having a tummy bug all of us if you had one it's just not nice that's not nice so we just pray that the Lord will just um intercede there for them and just heal them and give them bring them back for Sunday so we can have a full house again amen but you see it's with two or more gathered so even if we were just two tonight he's there and sister Rachel we had a discussion she said oh we we're not a lot of people tonight we can just start the service next door I said amen because we are two or more so we are in the right place so um let us get into the work day and we start there with with verse number five now my total uh my title for tonight is the Inside Man Grace versus Sin so just think about that it's the Insight man Grace versus Sin there is always that battle unbelief and Grace so let us just jump into the scripture there it says there in verse 5 and the people spake against God and against Moses wherefore have you brought us here to Egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no breed neither is there any water and our soul loveth for this the light breed and the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and the people I mean much in people in Israel died therefore the people came to Moses and said we have sinned for we have spoken against the Lord and against thee pray unto the Lord that he will take away the serpents from us and Moses prayed for the people and the Lord said unto Moses make thee a fiery Serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that if every one that is bitten will look upon this or look upon it shall live and Moses made the serpent of brass which is Judgment it's been brought serpent has been judged and put it up on a pole and it came to pass that the serpent that had bitten many when he beheld if a serpent that had bitten any man we need beheld the serpent of brass he lived amen may the Lord add his Blessing to the word you can have your seats amen so I always start with this um how can you say I always start with this um very controversial thing is like something's happened and the people always realize Something's Happened we need to move back to God and you know so so we as humans just in our own life we we kind of start enjoying life too much you know and and we kind of start enjoying the world too much and we enjoy everything too much and when it starts getting a little bit hard then all of a sudden our Attitude Change and and isn't it strange that when we on the mountain and we're having a real good awesome time that we kind of forget about God because we don't we don't need him you know as a lady of sea and curse you know we in the age of Lady of SIA and the lady of SIA don't need God at all but see there's a time where where when you make a mistake and you really know that you're in a bad place you you're in a place where you're not good with God and you're doing things that God that's not pleasing to God that now is starting to talk to you and he start speaking to the Inside Man the inside voice am I too loud should I turn myself down you're good okay sorry because we're doing everything tonight so um what we do is now now God comes and he starts pulling on your heart and he starts putting his finger on sin sin is unbelief so what happened here in numbers is the Israelites they murmured against God and and they were not very happy and they kicked against the prophet of God and God punished them he sent fiery serpents amen we read the same Bible God seen the serpents but as God sends the serpents he knows that there will be a man that once Israel remembered that they were wrong with God and they repented because the attitude was the attitude of repentance that God will already make a way for them back to walk with him and it happened time and again with Israel it happens time and again with us and the whole point of tonight's service is it will happen with you but it is the attitude of the believer that will bring the promise of God to pass faith is important but faith is not all that you need it's very hard to say is but Faith's not all you need because some people will go through trials regardless and it's not because they don't have a big Measure of Faith or a little Measure of Faith that you're going for trials God is working your life I don't want to get ahead of myself so now in numbers the enemies coming into the camp of Israel but God now raises the standard because Sinners came in the camp unbelief they didn't believe while they were in that they did they didn't believe they were in the right place they didn't believe the coming of the Lord they didn't believe the promised land they didn't believe he was the prophet they started murmuring against the situation the biggest sin is is unbelief the attributes of sin which we spoke on we on Sunday about attributes of Sinners because you don't believe you do things that's not pleasing to God but the unbelief in your heart is the thing we want to address because that is what's going to get you to to overcome that trial that's going to push you sometimes you feel when you're walking it feels you can't go further in your walk with god it feels like you got to a stalemate you got somewhere where you're like God just show me more of you I need more of you I don't understand this this is not this is not something I can understand I'm God I've got to a stalemate I've been running around he has been sin in this world and even in this church in amongst I believe is sin unbelief and you don't know how you're going to get past it but see that's not where we stop because God's already made the power of the blood speaks volumes speaks Freedom speaks for every one of us but the thing is you have to apply it so it's good that Jesus Christ died on the cross it's good that all these things happen we just celebrated Easter but when you get to a point where God is busy dealing with the Inside Man and you've hit that wall and call it unbelief call it the attack of the enemy call it the Giant in front of you the David the whatever call it that but you've hit that what now because sometimes in your trial it might not be nice at all it might be very uncomfortable but God has made a way I want to stretch it as much as I can even if you don't believe at all if you're a ranked sinner if you are a harlot if you are a a man running around with other women a woman running around with other men even if you did everything wrong possibly you can God will still make a way to get back to him if you can take it it's up to the believer he ain't going to do everything for us but he's made a way so when Israel was already crying there was no atonement made for their sin for that day for their unbelief so he said to Moses raise up that broad serpent put it in front of them and if they look upon Him type of Christ when they look upon Him their sins shall be forgiven they will be healed so sin and healing goes together unbelief and healing as hard as it is it's in the scriptures it's there so God makes the atonement for them Grace takes over I left my phone there at the back and you bring my phone to the front if it's possible because my quotes is on there I was there all over the show to me thank you amen thank you brother Brandon picks this up yeah and he speaks about it and God's provided way buddy in in the the Inside Man actually he picks this up and it's a very important part and this is where it actually really happened he says Wendy was travel God has always been the god that made the need for the hour that meet these people and you know that and God promised that he will supply their needs now when they had yet they were did it wrong and they had sinned and done these things wrong yet when they need of healing God made the atonement of healing when there was no atonement yet so God raised that up so if we look at the typing there's not just one type if we go back in the Book of Genesis and we see in the in the um Adam and Eve sinning so they sin they they deserve to die because God said the moment you eat of that tree you will die you will die but see now they've done it they've been caught in the act both of them were guilty they had to die but yet God rich in Mercy with his grace provided a sacrifice and it was the blood of the Lamb that he sacrificed for them and then he wrapped them with the skins of the Lambs because the Fig Leaf religion wasn't going to work the leaves wasn't going to cover them Cain tried to offer all kinds of leaves and flowers and all those things and God rejected that because God's way was the blood there was only the one way so God already showed them the Garden of Eden that blood of the Lamb had to be for that sacrifice then he came with the Israelites and he raised up the brown serpent to say Jesus Christ is going to die on the cross for you if you look upon him and you believe you shall be saved you and your house amen but now see God needs to deal with us a little bit more personal because it's good to find it in the scriptures but what is God doing with you so so I want to bring it a bit to this artist let's go talk to Dr God because when you're sick and you feeling that there's something wrong and your your nose is blocked or your throat the sore and or you you have a tummy bug or all those things then you don't really know what's wrong with you but you know the symptoms is you are sick but sometimes we sit in this church and the symptoms is we are sick and we need healing but see if you don't go to God if you don't go to the doctor he will have to start to talk to you and he is speaking to you tonight to all of us and he's trying to tell you that sometimes you get to a place in your life where you just feel you're going through the motions and everything's just blase and everything's just the same and in other words they service another brother man preaching and then a brother ate preaching and the cycle continues and it feels like you just keep cycling and you're not receiving anything but you've come to a stalemate because God's trying to deal with you but see you're so busy you need to start talking to God because if we go now and and please follow me we're going to go there to um to speak to Dr God and there was this this woman at the well let's go there John 4. I want to show you the type where God starts speaking to his children you know because I believe the woman at the well she was looking at brother Brandon said as well he says she was looking for love in all the wrong places but there was something in there that was looking for true love there was one that was looking for real healing not just in the body but in the spirit one that was in such a state that she didn't know where to go but you know what Jesus went her way she didn't go to Jesus Jesus said I need to go by the way of Samaria he stated to his disciples because he knew there was a child that was sitting in a service that needed some healing where other things became more important and they realized there's something wrong here my channel is blocked between God and me I don't feel the presence of God I don't see him moving on myths I haven't seen a healing in ages is there even miracles come on don't it's I didn't this I didn't want to preach this it was prepared last night when brother being said to pray this is not what I wanted to preach I wanted wisdom versus Faith this just came and it all came together there is a reason God is speaking to us tonight there's a reason for it and the fact that that it had to happen this way you should see the supernatural hand of God wake up don't miss it God doesn't waste one word out of a mouth of one of his servants that is just saying hey hear some mail there is no I I have no bad feelings about anybody here I don't even know what anybody goes through but there is a burden that's telling me that somebody is sinning in a stalemate with choices to make and they they are in such a place that they actually cannot walk further with God and God's telling you that there was a woman at the well that was worse off than you worse off and you know what I went their way I spoke to her amen so we go there and we're going women at the well um John 14. and we start there at verse number 10. so of course he is now starting to speak to her and is is contacting a spirit because what Jesus does is because he's a real good doctor he starts talking to us we sit in the service and he goes this one is for you you know and you're like ah in the thirds a bit it's a bit close you know AR monk you've got unconfession it is it is blocking that next step between me and you and the preachers preaching it and he says about the devil that has entitlement to have that punch and you're listening to all of this and he's busy trying to tell you Armand I'm dealing with you are you paying attention and what he does with this woman at the well is he starts just talking to her like you would speak to me in you but the inside of that lady knew there was more so she first started with a bit of reasoning she started with a bit of gospel you know you know we again we'll go through it and she sees here and he come up to a Woman verse 7 do a summary and he says Jesus said unto give me a water to drink for disciples were gone away in the city um to buy some meat thus says the women of Samaria unto him how is it thou that being a Jew um asked a drink of me which is a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans so she's now starting to say hey what's going on here we shouldn't even be talking but see Jesus knows that is one of his seed so he goes on because he's now contacting her and Jesus understood to her if thou knowest the gift of God and who is that save to thee give me a drink of water thou would have asked of him and he would give the Living Water now he's starting to give her a little bit of a parable see this there's more behind what I'm telling you now so now he's starting to talk not just here on the surface he's going a little bit deeper and then she says the woman sayeth unto me sir there was nothing to draw with and the world is deep and will the winds has thou this living water art thou greater than our father Jacob see now she goes to the scripture man have you set in a service and the preacher is preaching to you and then you start Bible punching you in your head oh yeah but if he sees that then I can say this and you're trying to reason yourself out of what is God's trying to do don't do that just eat it do just take it because when you when you take it you can absorb it it goes It goes deeper than just the mind take the word of God let it soak in think about it speak to him don't just reject it because you think oh it's not for me don't even do that that's the wrong thing to do because if we start doing that we start reasoning God hasn't even gotten to your level yet he hasn't even got into your head yet he hasn't even had a conversation with you yet because the moment let's say David comes and speak to you and he grabs the sand and says Hey brother man how are you doing and go there you go you're doing David good how was your day no it was all right yeah and I walk away no matter what he says after that it doesn't matter I lost interest but see if you just stay in there and you just keep pulling and say okay Lord what am I missing what am I missing you know the pastor's speaking about something maybe a worldliness maybe whatever I'm talking about he's actually speaking to me then start drawing start drawing it out of him let him give you that answer because he wants to don't reject it and this woman is now starting to talk back to him and say oh you know the the the the scripture sees this and thou are great that this well is Jacob's Well and um but Jesus stops right there and the children and all his cattle and Jesus answered to her and says whosoever drink of the water shall thirst again but whosoever drink of the water that I shall give shall never thirst but the water that I shall give them in in him a well of water springing unto everlasting life okay so now I just need to stable my notes because I'll really lived a little bit so it's the same as when now he's asking he's asking for um revealing to you what is sin so he's actually talking to her and oh we need to go to verse 15. so let's read on he says and the woman sayeth unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come he that to draw so and then of course Jesus now sees there's a little bit more to it so he's going to now just pierce the soul and he says go call your husband he said go call your husband and all of a sudden it becomes real so the ritual ruler had the same argument he came to Jesus Lord what do I do to get eternal life I've kept all the Commandments he goes yeah okay sell your stuff and just follow me wasn't a hard thing to do like if you really think about it he knows what is in here so oh you know I say okay you know on the Wednesday night service all I want you to do is just put this down for a while read a bit more your Bible spend more time with me you know when I when I'm in the world and and I start dealing with people in the world which we do because that's what we do we we are the light of this world we are the one that has to deal with it Heinz would know there's a lot of sick out there her brothers if you think about it a lot of hurt but it affects you but if you concentrate on only that it will affect you and it will show up in your life and you will get complexes and you'll get hurt and you'll get pulled left and right on all over the show but if you keep your eyes on Jesus and keep on listening to him let him talk behind the lines to you let him Minister unto you you know I'm sitting here and oh it's just boring and it's all it's fine but let him talk to you just eat a bit of food you had the whole week you can spend time wherever you want to just choose to spend it here you're really wondering because at least yeah you can get some Mana you can get some real food and and they can be a scripture that you've always been struggling with and bumping your head and bumping in and why am I not yielding why do I not feel saved and when do I get the Holy Ghost and all these difficult questions can be answered right here amen so the woman of the of the well sin is now coming to the surface because now what happened is he now contacted the the Inner Man the the real her inside and he says to her because he's the the surner of the thoughts and the teeth of the heart and he says to her in your heart I know you're looking for love but I just want to quickly call you out where are you looking for love so go call your husband where are you spending your time what are you looking for out there what are you going to get in the world just another husband how many do you have I've got five yeah you've got five you got YouTube you got Twitter you can man I'm gonna always preach against these things because I hate it I think it's from the devil you got YouTube you got Twitter you got Snapchat you've got all the other things out there I don't even know what is there and all it is it is husbands that you're with because you don't know where you're looking for your love and children guess what I only preach to you I preach to your parents as well and I preach to myself as well because we find ourselves going after every other husband to get a feeling inside our heart that we felt good about something that day so it's addictive so I get in there and I start Twitter and YouTube and all of a sudden YouTube short short shorts long long extra long very long massively long and then after a while two and a half hours on shorts that wasn't short but I've been with someone else come on I've been with someone else but see Jesus comes your way and he says but I can give you more than that because when you look at these things they feed something there's a white dog and a black dog they feed it whether you know it or not this lady was looking for real love and she had five husbands and Jesus called her out on it and then she went you know what this is the heart of a believer lord it's true I've got five husbands I'm not in the right place and he guessed oh I love that he says okay let's go on man I love it this I just get she says I perceive that you are a prophet because when Messiah comes he will do these things and he says to her yeah in verse 27 he says and upon this came his disciples and and now listen to this woman he says but the hour come he talks to her he says I am the Messiah but here this is what she does now she goes into action Grace actually comes right in right here and he says to her and upon this came his disciples in Marvel that he talked to this woman yet no man said anything you know or or or um why talk yourself to them and the woman left her water pot so she jumps into action and she went away into the city say of hey there's a man come and see a man which told me all the things that I ever done isn't this the Christ because she knew he was addressing something that was really wrong in here and she says you know what I'll leave this all down this is Messiah there's something else going on there and she goes in the city and she starts dystifying now I want you to tell this is such a type of our church if you really think about it this is such a type of our church okay and I'm not saying with the Harlot follow me she's now standing for a nation she's standing for a town she's standing for Samaria because now she goes into that town and she goes preach the gospel because she actually says to them or not preach the gospel she's a testimony remember share your candle girl she goes and she says come see a man there's a man that just told me everything I've done I couldn't hide it from him and I'm free now it's done because he spoke to me I heard his voice it was the voice behind the voice and then these men come out and they come and sit there by Jesus and they start listening to him and if you go down it says in verse 39 and many of the Samaritans of that City believe for him and um for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all the things I ever did so when the Samaritans will come down unto him they besought him um that he would tarry with him now they came because they saw something else happen in this lady's life remember she was a harlot so you just five seconds ago in the service that everything wrong now God comes and ministers to you and he says I can change it for you my child and you accept it because you're humble you can face it don't hold unconfessed sin the devil holds that ticket in his hand till the day of your judgment if there is any sin between you and God get rid of it it is it is it is absolutely of the devil if you have anything that you think if I would tell someone about it it will break my relationship rather break the relationship with them then break your relationship with God because the devil has this card and he is entitled to play it at the day of judgment because if you haven't placed it under the blood it's not under the blood and you cannot place it under the blood until you bring it to the surface and it surfaces up and God can deal with it and then he can apply the blood because then he can make a way through you but if you hold it he cannot make a way he cannot so if you hold unconfaced sin the devil has the card in his hand and trust me the hardest thing for you to do is to confess it and to say I'm sorry but guess what after that you're free because now God can take the atonement that he did on the cross the blood of Jesus Christ can come and cleans that and it's radon red it's scarlet and blood mixed and it's all white and God looks upon the sinner now and he sees a saint because God has made the atonement God has made the way back we make it too hard because we get in the way but it's done it is actually done so now this lady she she she's there at the Samaritans and yes Shekinah and I'm going to call it Shekinah because I just feel late to do it and many whom believe because of um of his own words so to believe the word of Jesus and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ the savior of the world so it went from the woman's testimony to hearing himself what brought you to church someone's testimony what brought me into Shekinah Brother Andy and sister Bronwyn wentystifying brother being testifying you know all the Believers come up I remember that we had a we had a jubilee Steed season sister Shannon was so beautiful just when we were just a little couple of people not saying we're not having it again but I want you to Street something we came to church and we were like 15 20 people okay Max Max like now just a little bit and the sister will raise up and sell glory to God this happened today I just want to share it and sister Vanessa will stand up and say I was walking past the bus stop and the lady stopped me and I started talking to her about God and I just felt the presence of God and she just left that up and I gave her a book and praise the Lord there's something happening and they just kept duck and things were so personal so nice because they see their testimony but then we come and sit here because we see God living in time in time he's now the now God he's not the tomorrow God or yes it's the now God and then he's put him in time and we say hey and someone will raise him and say hey my son was sick but he's now healed and brother Bean comes and stands up and say oh and the Lisa's tongue was tired and the doctor was going to cut and all of a sudden a trip it went up and the blood was out and it was fixed and praise God because we didn't want it to go through it and and it builds faith but now we're not hearing being speaking we're hearing God speaking because he's busy telling us children there is a better way you don't get distracted about all these things there's more happening in this place here and now then whatever happened out there because it has to be shall showed to us here first before it happens there amen I went so way off my notes today but amen praise the Lord I get so so happy about the Lord eh okay let's go Divine influence and the reflection of divine influence the Divine so Grace brother Ben always says it's the the influence upon the heart and the reflection in the Life there must be a reflection so you cannot be saved by your works impossible okay you can't be saved by your works if you do that why did Jesus die for us on the cross done so number one you cannot get yourself out of any situation no matter how easy it seems no matter how hard it seems it takes the master to come and take you out there so her sense was revealed to her and she brought the rest of the sitting into the kingdom because now remember what happened after that Philip went back there to go and preach so they heard Jesus now Jesus nowhere in the scriptures says he did miracles in Samaria he did no Miracles there didn't say it in the scriptures Philip went back and Jesus preached to them and the lady started the testimony service Jesus preached to them and he walked to a left he left them his word and now Philip goes back and Philip goes preach because the atonement has now been made the Holy Ghost Jesus died on the cross the atonement has now been made now Philip goes back to the same city and now he preaches Christ and the whole city repents and comes to God and signs and miracles and everything happens but see it couldn't happen when Jesus was there even if God himself was there he said this is not the time so you might think that this is not the time but I'm telling you there is a preaching coming and some seeds coming and signs and miracles will follow them and you will be birthed into the kingdom of God because if God has started the work he will finish the work amen near Liam Stein amen sorry I get so excited I lost all my notes there okay now we're going to preach so it's any sin to be for God so what is it about what does God love so much about you in this building tonight please tell me anybody has it what does God love about you he's the lover of your because it belongs to so you have a soul you have an inside man but what you feed on it it it there's a body so so Body Spirit Soul okay Soul birthed into the kingdom filled with the Holy Ghost you're done okay you are sealed away into the kingdom unless you grieve the Holy Ghost but see there is still a battle between the spirit and the body so that's Spirit you ain't want to go out you without a fight because that one was born in sin and God deals with a spirit man because the spirit if you feel depressed what's making you feel depressed not your soul you can be a saved and as happy as a daffodil but if your spirit is hurt and bruised it comes out onto your body and it actually affects your body conscience reasoning okay so just think about it it actually your soul needs some healing too and our heal Spirit sorry your spirit needs healing too because you could be hurt on your spirit really badly and you could put a wall right up on that hurt and anybody that ever comes close and Brother Andy priest that subconscious series uh if I don't know if ever you watched it your brain is so fast that before you even can think about it your body will react to that hurt so an example is this this is a hot oven okay very hot plate I touch it it burns my hand okay so I pull it away burn my hand real bad through the greens Burns four five six seven degrees doesn't matter 150 degrees burns doesn't matter but you really burned yourself the next time you come to that plate and your hand goes close to that and you feel the heat before you feel the plate what does your body do hey that thing's hot your brain didn't do that the the spirit God heard this the the body is now reacting to a pastor it's the same as when you say something bad or when people talk bad about each other gossip those demons that's in the church every church has them you know because they come to share for you a nice story but actually all they want to do is Gossip because that's all they want to do is they gossip okay it's an evil spirit it's bad it doesn't belong in the house of God Envy doesn't belong here guess what nothing that you have belongs to you anyways you come with nothing you leave with nothing so there's no point looking at your neighbor's fancy car because guess what he doesn't own it either laughs serious oh you know brother Cuban he always has the nicest suits and thighs yeah it's fine when he has a body to change will he be in that suit and I he'll wear the same white robe as me but though if he looks here and he comes in he looks the flashes in it and I respect him for it and I say Lord thank you for sending a man like that see because look I look at the blessing I don't look at the man because if you look at the man you'll always be disappointed but when you look inside of the man and you see the inside man now you're looking like God's looking at us now here and we go to second Samuel 12. we're not going to go we're just going to paraphrase because I don't want to take too long David kills Uriah who knows the story he has a passion he has a he has a little bit of a a David moment okay man of God anointed king now do you believe God could have given him Bathsheba if it wasn't God's will which it was and I'll tell you now why because Solomon was going to come through that lineage Solomon was came from Bathsheba and Solomon had to go build the temple so God already had a plan how it's going to pan out but then David jumped the gun because he looked at her and he desired her and he gave into his Passions and he was completely wrong and out of the will of God though it wasn't God's permissive will it wasn't in God's perfect will because know that same David and abhishai was walking and going to kill Saul correct and they get Saul in the cave and ambushar gets him and Saul's sleeping and he's like sleeping out like a rock like gone I'm going to spear this through him and I'll bury him in the ground that's how all I'm going to spear him I'll finish it now and and David sees to advertise his do you not touch God's anointed one do you not think that God can raise him up and bring can take him off the scene he brings Kings and takes Kings away leave God's anointed so he knew that God could do it he knew that God can send Bathsheba if he wanted it for him if it was his heart's desire he had 500 wives why does he want another one but he's he gave into a moment of weakness and he sinned because of unbelief because if he really believed what he just said to Abisha he could have just said God can give me Bathsheba because I like her and I want her and if it was all in God's will God would have led Uriah go to battle and Uriah would have died and everything would have been on God's time not David's time so see David got out of the will of God but God already made a way back so he sends a prophet to him who remembers of the children what was the prophet's name that's it so Nathan goes and he says King David oh great King live forever says God sent me I need to talk to you no I'm just paraphrasing because I want the kids to not fall asleep and get distracted pay attention because this will happen and I mean in a nice way God sends a brother to your door who can I use to go brother Jimmy how's it going God sent me there's something on my heart I want to tell you I've got a parable for you now I want you to realize that God sometimes speak in Parables to all of us here in church the preaching will go and the preaching will go but in between those lines God's starting to pluck those hot strings because Jesus spoke in Parables and the reason he spoke in Parables because The Parables was for the elected The Parables wasn't for the Pharisees and The Saturdays though they perceived God spoke about them they weren't very sure if it was them or not and they got really angry and they want to kill him but only the elected knew oh God saying something yeah I need to I need to pay attention now so God's not always going to tell you exactly what your sin is to the point you need to do a bit of homework you need to do a bit of dialect with God you need to talk back to the master and say hey I'm actually in this state it's not a one-way conversation or else we would all be robots and sitting in this church just like this and will come and God will download some info and we'll go praise God and he will move out and will overcome because it's easy it's not easy but see what we do is when we feed the black dog the black dog wins because if you put and I'm going to go back to David now but if you keep putting filth in they cannot be clean water come out it's impossible impossible again I would say this world has so much filth in it we are over our head in it so how much not more to tighten the belt right now tighten them up real quick because God has made a way tonight God has made a way tonight he's already made on Calvary but he's coming again and he's saying listen we can get rid of this sin anything that is blocking your walk with me hindering your healing hindering everything that is between me and you we can get rid of it right now we just need to change the atmosphere a bit we just need to have a little bit of a discussion of course Nathan is now talking to David and he says to David there was a man that had a lot of sheep and he had a guy come in to come and visit him and then he took his neighbor sheet but this sheep was a special sheep he loved the Sheep he cared for the Sheep he fed the Sheep off the table he did everything for the ship it was his own sheep he loved it so much and he grabbed that sheep and he killed it and he gave it to the family to this man visiting him and gave it gets angry and David now speaks judgment he says that man should be killed amen but see God knows how to speak with David and I'm gonna go here and God speaks judgment oh David speaks judgment and brother Brandon picks it up here and he says that old prophet them eyes narrowed down say David surely you shall not die because he knew why God sent him and he says watch Grace go to work right here quick and the spirit struck that prophet in David's life Grace surely you will not die but by the sword you will live in your house um and by but the sword will not leave your house till you thoroughly perched your heart for you are a rich man oh it was different then wasn't it what saved David when his own judgment said he will die he'll pay the uttermost price but the prophet said surely Grace you will not die he will not die David Grace to save you it is Grace to David it saved him oh my so sometimes we quick off the handle and if you live by the sword you die by the sword but God sends people in time to say hold on I've got a better way I got a much better way but see what happens now and I'll tell you what what is the end of it and what happens now is David repents because he realizes he's done something wrong and he's got such a heart for God that he said you know what Lord I've done it wrong try me one more time but see God still says your son's gonna die it's hard but you still reap what you sow so God gives Grace but God then turns a blind eye to sin so when God is addressing sin and he's talking to you and he's saying hey can we get everything between me and you cleared so I can actually come and dwell within you because God will not dwell in a vessel that is filthy God will not come to a person that doesn't receive or can repent that's hard and callous and just kicks him away every time he says come it's time come he'll only call that many times you'll only call that many times before you overstep Grace now I'm not trying to make it an emotion I'm really honest God said to me the one day you shall go and do this now and I'm not going to say what the story was we all know a bit of the testimony and I firmly believe in my whole heart if I didn't do that I would have ripped consequences to what I was sowing but praise the Lord when he talked to me I said you know what Lord I'll just go and do it anyways but I hope you've got this one because if it goes wrong it's over for me no I don't want to kill myself it's over for me there's so many consequences but see rather face those consequences than have something between you and God don't disappoint God start with him no matter what you need to strike off the The Ballad or or whatever is is so easily the sins that easily beset us that that encourages unbelief that that just grabs your time away from God instead of having that just clear it off let God Strike It Off just open the channels just say be a for real Christian and say you know what I am wrong I am spending too much time on this I am doing this wrong knowingly Doing It Wrong David knew what he was doing he knew 100 what he was doing but see now he repents and God says okay you're still going to reap what you sowed you're still going to get the sword won't leave your house your son will die and after his son died the Bible said he worshiped God because he knew that God was still good to him then God restores him back in the Kingdom later on after menier trials but see now Solomon was different Solomon when God told him don't walk after the gods of your your wives Solomon didn't repent and he says because I will take your house out of your hand and I will give it to you a lesser one but Solomon didn't repent Solomon didn't have a soft art he says but I won't do it to you Solomon I will do it to your son because I reverence my servant David because David's goodness and his heart and the and the connection between him and God were so soft and he was so pliable that even when he sinned God made a way for him he took that way straight away he didn't think twice but Solomon was lifted up in Pride and he had all the wisdom and he was having a massive body and God said you know what because I love David I will not take it out of your hands but your son is going to pay that price so sometimes you sin as a parent and you do something wrong and it goes to your children because that's how sin goes through the lineage because brother Branham City at the beginning that sin will visit you in you'll learn his foot the third to the fourth generation and sometimes you are the third or fourth generation and your battle has been hard and you don't understand why all these things happen you don't even know what your dad or your mom did back then but go talk to God because the blood is stronger than any demon Force though there is consequences in your reaping you don't understand why it's going so bad with you or why your situations should die and you never have money or you can't get over this or you're still struggling with the lust spirit and all those type of things that sin that comes from your family down but the blood of Jesus Christ can cut right through it because the atonement has been made a way back to God has been made you just need to accept it but if you can humble yourself and go before God God is rich in Mercy and he will forgive you your sins and he will strike it off and you can walk with God and then you'll start seeing like Samaria Miracles happening in your midst when the preaching happens now you start seeing a whole town a whole city come together and wonders and miracles and signs and all these things Wonder and prophetic visions and and all these things starts being restored because the whole church is now in unison with God Walking with God same playing field nothing Aiken sent once hit it once and it crippled men and it killed me and they had to destroy to move on S as you know and this is the thing I don't like about the nominations from today they make God a they make him a granddad you can do what you want God just says it's over and it's over it doesn't work like that the Bible says you reap what you sow in the Old Testament and in the New Testament so if you're doing something wrong if God is telling you to do something wrong all right and you willingly do it the other way because of Pride or your way of thinking about it why don't you stop it right there and say okay Lord I don't understand just show me I promise you the Living God that I know and serve and you know and serve will show you and then you apply the blood because now you actually can apply the blood because now you're on speaking terms with God and now you can overcome and it is easy to put the phone down and it is easy to take your word and when you're sitting for five minutes to start reading and it's easy to go you know what Brother David so sorry I offended you the other day I didn't mean to hey and he goes yeah I can't even remember what you did that's all right praise you because my heart is now humble there's no guile in me anymore because everything is cleared off the blood has struck it off nobody can take that out of the blood and they shouldn't because that will be attributed to them so tonight I don't want to end on that bombshell but I really wanted to say that God has made a way and the whole point of Easter is he made The Way Way Back 2023 years ago the way is made but the battle today is can we get humble enough to realize when God is tucking on our hearts to say make it right and can we get on our knees and can we strike it off between us and him so that he can apply the blood do not whatever you do hold on to sin don't do it it's the biggest mistake you can make clean that off no matter how much you hurt that person you don't don't go and say it like but go in humbleness pray before you go to that person if you've done something wrong towards them or even towards yourself remember we're our biggest enemy go before God and strike that off orowski SWAT day of judgment Satan comes running and goes oh oh I got another remember this you didn't repent of this I still have this oh and there's another one for you and another one because that's all he wants to do he hates the Sons and Daughters of God he wants to have that card to use against you that's his job but all you have to do is say Lord I've done it forgive me and he goes boom gone now he comes the end he stands in front of the Throne of God and goes oh dear brother Isaac sorry bro I've got nothing for you he's washed clean and Isaac goes yeah put it under the blood it's done amen and that's my service for tonight I didn't have a long windy one I thought this is um just how I how the Lord LED um I maybe want to just tell you a little bit of that I said once and my wife asked these words after I broke her heart she says why are you so happy I said cause it's gone it's gone and that's when I started seeing God deal with me in my life first person and not third person because now there was nothing between my Lord and my savior and sister Shannon you love that song Let There be nothing between your lord and your savior amen amen may the Lord just bless you let's just close in the word of prayer I don't I don't feel like we have to have a big repent of service and everybody kneel you in front but I do want us to stand up and I do want you to disclose your eyes and if there is something that you want to address to the Lord just close your eyes and bow your hates children you go as well and there is something that you just felt hey Lord you know what tonight something is struck in here you know maybe I gossip or I'm a bit jealous or Lord maybe I don't think you can't Supply my every need or maybe I think that you're not days of Miracles are over or there's something blocking your presence from me that that that lovely moment that that real presence that when you come in everything just changes it's now time to just ask the Lord and you just lift up your hand please bow your heads and close your eyes God bless you close your eyes bow your heads God bless you so let's just pray and buy your uplifted hand we just ask the Lord that he would help us oh gracious Heavenly Father Lord I know myself when I Was preparing the service Lord I thought oh man how I can get it so wrong Lord and
