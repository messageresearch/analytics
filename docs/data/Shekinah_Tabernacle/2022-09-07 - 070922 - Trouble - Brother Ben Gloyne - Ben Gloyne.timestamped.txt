[34:30] was blind from his birth
[34:32] and his disciples asked him saying

[37:43] um
[37:45] tonight so
[37:46] praise the lord
[37:48] it's amazing
[37:50] how
[37:51] i want to talk about trouble
[37:53] praise god
[37:56] trouble's actually a good thing
[37:58] brother brown would say in the in the
[38:00] message i know
[38:02] he says and why does god let trouble
[38:04] come god harnesses trouble puts bits in
[38:07] its mouth makes it obey him and those
[38:09] troubles bring us into a closer
[38:11] fellowship with god
[38:12] there has been no rainbow until the
[38:14] flood came but after noah was pressed
[38:16] into that condition that he was in to
[38:17] float 40 days and nights in the storm
[38:19] and little ark pitching up and down in
[38:21] the water and and after the flood was
[38:23] over that he saw the rainbow for the
[38:25] first time the covenant of hope the
[38:27] covenant of promise after he went
[38:29] through the tribulation
[38:31] then he saw the promise that's the way
[38:32] you see the promise after you've gone
[38:34] through the tribulation i mean he says
[38:36] i've liked that palm or some must i be
[38:39] carried home to heaven on a flowery bed
[38:41] of ease while others fought to win the
[38:43] prize and sell through bloody seas i
[38:46] mean you know we live in a day we yeah
[38:48] we understand trouble is part of life
[38:50] you know just because we're believers it
[38:52] doesn't mean we're exempt from trouble
[38:53] doesn't mean that god just puts a hedge
[38:55] of protection around us that we have no
[38:57] trouble we have no heartache we have no
[38:59] sickness but it's all part of life
[39:02] amen and you know what i love about this
[39:04] we just read and john here is that you
[39:06] know you know there's a question why is
[39:08] why is this person in this condition
[39:10] maybe you're asking yourself the
[39:11] question about your current state of
[39:12] life why are you in the state and it's
[39:14] actually the answer really is that the
[39:16] works of god will be manifested in you i
[39:19] mean just like this blind man amen that
[39:21] that you know the question was you know
[39:23] who sinned was it himself or his father
[39:25] or you know and then jesus said neither
[39:28] but that the that the works of god would
[39:31] be manifested in him you know it's
[39:33] amazing when trouble strikes we begin to
[39:35] be like job's friends
[39:37] you know job had some well you know
[39:39] friends
[39:40] you know because his friends didn't help
[39:41] him none
[39:43] really they just accused him basically
[39:44] after all their long dialogues and
[39:46] things they came down to the same
[39:48] conclusion you're a secret sinner job
[39:50] god's judging you that's why this has
[39:52] become upon you but they had no idea you
[39:55] know that actually god and satan had a
[39:57] conference
[39:58] and god testified of his servant job
[40:00] saying there's none like him upon the
[40:02] earth you know wouldn't you like god to
[40:04] testify to the devil about you
[40:06] saying there's none like them upon the
[40:07] earth they're my perfect perfect bride
[40:10] you know they're the apple of mine eye
[40:11] you know they've been made in my image
[40:13] and you know job had no idea that this
[40:15] conversation was taking place and job
[40:17] had no idea that actually of the
[40:19] confidence that god had him job he had
[40:21] no idea but you know it's one thing to
[40:23] have confidence in god but god's but
[40:25] god's got to have confidence in you
[40:28] and god does have confidence in you
[40:30] that's why he allows you to go through
[40:32] trials is because he has faith in you
[40:35] not your humanity not how smart you are
[40:37] but the seed he put in the in the inside
[40:39] of your soul that that's gonna hold
[40:42] amen so job had no idea that that though
[40:45] that that he lost his children he lost
[40:47] his livelihood he became sick covered in
[40:49] boils lost basically everything because
[40:52] god testified to the devil of how
[40:54] perfect job was yeah i mean now if if if
[40:58] god could testify of a man under the
[41:00] under the blood of bulls and goats about
[41:02] he's a perfect man how much for a people
[41:04] under the bride of jesus christ under
[41:06] the blood of jesus christ that their
[41:07] sins are not just covered but they're
[41:09] done away with that the very sin nature
[41:11] they're born with is eradicated by the
[41:13] power of the holy ghost i mean how much
[41:16] more are people like that
[41:18] hallelujah
[41:20] amen but you see we we somehow get a bit
[41:23] superstitious about when trouble strikes
[41:26] but we just read that trouble trouble
[41:28] god god puts bits in its mouth and
[41:31] causes it to bring us into a closer walk
[41:33] with god
[41:34] so really trial troubles are a blessing
[41:36] that's why it would say in the scripture
[41:38] count it all joy
[41:40] count it as joy you say i'm not feeling
[41:42] joy but counted as joy you've got to
[41:44] actually put it in your joy column
[41:46] saying this is joy right you may be
[41:48] feeling troubled apprehensive nervous
[41:50] worried upset but you got to drag that
[41:52] into the joy column as i'm counting this
[41:55] as joy that's what you've got to assign
[41:56] it as amen because there's god remember
[42:00] god is not an author of confusion
[42:02] he's not an author of frustration he's
[42:04] working all things all things work
[42:07] together for good for those that love
[42:08] god and called according to his purpose
[42:10] romans 8 28 so all things that's not
[42:13] most things is not some things all
[42:16] things
[42:17] all things
[42:19] that's a lot of things
[42:21] that's everything
[42:22] praise a lot but it's all working for
[42:24] our good but you see we can get into a
[42:26] condition where we don't see god's
[42:28] unseen hand
[42:30] but you see faith is more
[42:33] than a feeling
[42:35] and being full of faith does not mean
[42:37] it's a force field from trouble
[42:40] actually the more faith you have the
[42:41] more trouble you may face
[42:45] praise a lot
[42:46] hallelujah but people take it vice versa
[42:49] see
[42:50] but you see you know that's why we're
[42:51] going to you know job would say in job
[42:53] 14-1 a man that is born of a woman is of
[42:56] a few days and full of trouble
[42:58] amen
[43:00] praise the lord
[43:02] see the apostle paul you know some
[43:04] people think you know i trust no one has
[43:06] the idea that god is just a man with a
[43:08] big stick
[43:09] and he follows you around and as soon as
[43:12] you begin to put your foot halfway out
[43:13] of line he just wants to pop you on the
[43:15] head
[43:16] i hope you don't have that kind of
[43:17] revelation of god
[43:19] because if you do you need to get the
[43:20] real revelation of god our god doesn't
[43:23] follow his children around with a big
[43:24] stick and it at the slightest
[43:27] opportunity wants to just punish you
[43:29] that's not how i go no way hey i'm i'm
[43:32] glad someone knows jesus christ
[43:36] you get a bit worried when things go a
[43:37] bit quiet it's like really is sure he's
[43:40] not like that no he's really not like
[43:42] that sure he corrects us but he's got
[43:44] our best interest in mind but he's not
[43:46] just looking there like some grumpy i'm
[43:48] glad i don't live in the era of when
[43:50] people used to get physical punishment
[43:52] at school
[43:53] but you know he's not like some angry
[43:56] fussing teacher that just hasn't been
[43:58] dead against every child just wants to
[43:59] beat them as soon as they begin to no
[44:01] that's not our god
[44:03] that's not our god he doesn't work that
[44:05] way
[44:06] but he allows trouble i mean to bring us
[44:08] into a closer fellowship with him you
[44:10] know there's nothing the devil can do
[44:11] without god's permission
[44:13] and before he gets permission god has
[44:15] confidence in you
[44:16] right god is not stressing out will they
[44:18] stand the test he knows you'll stand the
[44:20] test because by us for knowledge he can
[44:22] see you're gonna come out the other side
[44:24] better stronger loving him more closer
[44:27] to him than ever before
[44:29] hallelujah do you believe that yes
[44:32] remember this is not a this is not a
[44:34] walk of survival all right and and you
[44:36] know we're just going to get through by
[44:38] the skin of our teeth no we're going to
[44:40] overcome
[44:42] we may go through great fire we may go
[44:44] through great hardship we may go through
[44:46] all kinds of things but we're going to
[44:47] come out the other side
[44:49] with a crown of gold
[44:52] amen so so if you have the idea that god
[44:55] has to punish you as soon as someone
[44:56] begins to walk out of line or the reason
[44:58] they are punished is because or the
[45:01] reason they are going through hardship
[45:02] is because they've gone out of line
[45:04] you've got to change your line of
[45:05] thinking
[45:07] because we could let's just take apostle
[45:09] paul
[45:10] as an example we know the apostle paul
[45:13] is the is the pattern of every true
[45:15] minister down through the ages he
[45:17] preached the word of the hour he had the
[45:19] manifestation of the spirit
[45:21] right but then he did suffer for the
[45:23] gospel sake
[45:24] and
[45:25] and the bible does teach us that there
[45:27] is a measure of suffering for the church
[45:29] that's right i'm glad no one no one's
[45:32] shouting i mentioned that's fine you
[45:34] know but because remember we would know
[45:36] him in the power of his resurrection we
[45:37] love that part of the scripture but then
[45:39] also the like fellowship of the
[45:40] sufferings right
[45:41] so it's all there but just because we go
[45:44] through hardship does not mean we've
[45:45] stepped out of line because sometimes
[45:47] people think your sickness strikes them
[45:49] oh something must be wrong no
[45:51] everything's going just fine
[45:52] everything's going just fine right but
[45:55] you just got to keep the thing is if you
[45:56] keep beginning you get superstitious why
[45:58] i saw an orange color on a flag and i've
[46:00] got a cold something must be wrong no no
[46:02] it doesn't work that way
[46:04] we've got to keep our eyes on the lord
[46:06] on his word not on things we think
[46:09] right so see let's take the apostle paul
[46:11] now i've actually started on page nine
[46:14] um so and this is not that irregular
[46:18] for me that's why slides i can get a bit
[46:20] i'm a bit allergic to them but let's go
[46:22] to second corinthians 11.
[46:24] let's look at this character
[46:26] paul
[46:29] so i just let's just see the walkie head
[46:34] let's just see the walkie hat
[46:36] second corinthians 11 and 22 do you want
[46:37] to do you want to start that up there
[46:38] that would be real neat
[46:43] he didn't just sit in an ivory tower of
[46:44] the holy ghost without any trouble
[46:47] right but yet he had such a revelation
[46:50] it didn't matter what came against me
[46:52] says none of these things move me
[46:54] none of these things move me from the
[46:55] faith he says i've known whom i have
[46:57] believed and in persuader that he's able
[46:59] to keep that which i've committed to him
[47:00] against that day what is that his soul
[47:03] amen that that god would take him into
[47:05] glory are they hebrews so my are they
[47:07] israelite so am i are they the seed of
[47:09] abraham so am i are they ministers of
[47:11] christ i speak as a fool i am more and
[47:13] laborers more abundant and stripes above
[47:15] measure whoa hold on all right hold on
[47:18] and prisons more frequent and deaths oft
[47:21] of the jews five times i receive 40
[47:23] stripes save one
[47:25] oh hold on
[47:27] he must have done something wrong
[47:30] thrice was i beat him with rods once i
[47:32] was stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a
[47:34] night and a day have i been in the deep
[47:37] and journeyings often in perils of
[47:39] waters and perils of robbers and perils
[47:41] of my own countrymen imperials by the
[47:43] heathen imperials in the city and perils
[47:44] in the wilderness and perils in the sea
[47:46] and perils among false brethren
[47:51] oh my they're on pj awareness and
[47:53] painfulness and watchings often and
[47:55] hunger and thirst and fastings often and
[47:57] cold and nakedness beside all those that
[47:59] are without and which come upon me daily
[48:01] the care of all the churches
[48:04] so if we if we looked at the apostle
[48:06] paul now this may think
[48:08] some people think like this
[48:10] they think when trouble strikes they're
[48:11] out of the will of god
[48:13] if you apply that to the apostle paul
[48:15] he's the most unstable
[48:17] he's the most backslidden he's the most
[48:20] untrustworthy
[48:21] preacher that you could ever imagine
[48:24] he had quite a run
[48:26] he would he would go preach in one city
[48:29] and he'd have a revival but then jews
[48:31] from the previous city would follow
[48:32] follow him stir up the crowd that beat
[48:35] him or stone where he'd end up in jail
[48:37] and he'd go to the next city and the
[48:38] cycle would repeat
[48:40] that was his missionary trip
[48:42] how was the how was the accommodation
[48:44] well
[48:45] well that prison in philippi my
[48:49] terrible view
[48:50] zero star on google
[48:52] you know but that was that was his
[48:53] missionary trips
[48:55] and and and and a cold strikes us and we
[48:58] think as god left us
[49:02] you know when you really vocalize it it
[49:04] sounds ridiculous
[49:05] god hasn't left you he said i'll never
[49:08] leave him or forsake me i'll be with you
[49:10] wherever you go amen in trouble and good
[49:13] times and hard times he's the same god
[49:16] just because we go through trouble
[49:17] doesn't mean he hasn't forsaken us amen
[49:19] but the apostle paul because his faith
[49:21] wasn't a hope
[49:23] he wasn't i'm hoping the lord is pleased
[49:25] with me no no he had a revelation the
[49:27] lord is pleased with him
[49:28] why was he why why why did he get that
[49:31] revelation because he knew the lord
[49:32] jesus paid it all on calvary he could
[49:35] see that all the old testament shadows
[49:37] and types of the high priest taking the
[49:38] blood and into the holy of holies for on
[49:40] behalf of the people all the sacrifice
[49:42] everything was manifested in jesus
[49:44] christ and he knew that the blood of
[49:46] bulls and ghosts could cover sin in such
[49:48] a powerful way that god could not see it
[49:50] how much more the holy blood of god that
[49:52] was shed upon the earth on his behalf
[49:55] amen and he had the same spirit of god
[49:57] that wrote the old testament now dwelt
[49:58] on him by that same blood so he knew
[50:00] that jesus had paid it all when he wrote
[50:03] that he became sin
[50:05] who knew no sin that i'd become the very
[50:07] rice of god through christ that was a
[50:09] revelation that wasn't it what can i put
[50:11] that sounds good to put on instagram
[50:13] kind of a scripture that was a reality
[50:15] to him right so he had a revelation i am
[50:18] as righteous as god is righteous because
[50:19] he became me he was the sinner that i'd
[50:22] become him amen hallelujah
[50:24] and that's what faith should achieve
[50:26] right it's
[50:28] it's it doesn't matter about condition
[50:31] trouble just should bring into a closer
[50:33] fellowship with god
[50:35] hallelujah so
[50:37] i just encourage you
[50:39] put your torches and your pitchforks
[50:41] away
[50:43] when sickness strikes
[50:44] or trouble strikes
[50:46] oh there's sin somewhere we've got to do
[50:48] a real search
[50:50] just walk with god
[50:52] brother brown does say turn over every
[50:53] stone
[50:55] and then be certain of god but we
[50:57] shouldn't be always on the lookout for
[50:58] what the enemy is doing
[51:00] just walk with god he'll show you it's
[51:02] like how do how do people who examine
[51:05] money know what a counterfeit bill is
[51:07] they study the genuine long enough
[51:10] and they do that so they can see the
[51:12] counterfeit
[51:13] they don't necessarily just study the
[51:14] counterfeit they just look at the
[51:15] genuine enough and if you look at the
[51:17] genuine enough
[51:18] and the genuine holy ghost moving i mean
[51:22] you know the counterfeit spirit i mean
[51:24] you know when the devil whispers in your
[51:25] ear you're not good enough you're going
[51:27] to make it you're no good something look
[51:28] what you did you know the effects of his
[51:30] spirit
[51:33] amen so we should be able to rest
[51:36] and know
[51:37] my sheep hear my voice
[51:39] and a stranger they shall not follow
[51:41] that's what john 10 says does it not it
[51:43] says in the gospel of john so
[51:45] jesus did not say my sheep might hear my
[51:47] voice
[51:48] or sometimes they'll hear my voice
[51:51] no no my sheep hear my voice
[51:53] and says a stranger they shall not
[51:55] follow so you just listen to the voice
[51:57] of the shepherd
[51:59] the voice of the shepherd has spoken in
[52:01] this generation that's what this message
[52:02] is the voice of god has spoken to this
[52:05] generation that's the voice of the bible
[52:07] has spoken and if we know that voice
[52:09] amen then when the enemy's voice comes
[52:11] along we say hold on
[52:13] i know this this guy is not my shepherd
[52:17] this spirit is not my shepherd doesn't
[52:19] matter how wrapped up in religious piety
[52:21] and feeling sorry not just a humble kind
[52:23] of crippled up no
[52:25] you know
[52:26] god doesn't push us in a hole somewhere
[52:28] and say stay there for a little bit he
[52:29] doesn't have a naughty corner
[52:32] right
[52:33] sure we have to we can grieve his spirit
[52:35] and we can repent and he comes back but
[52:38] he doesn't say well you know it's not
[52:40] like with the police here
[52:42] where the punishment fits the crime so
[52:44] for example you do x amount of you do a
[52:46] certain crime you should get this x
[52:48] amount of years right
[52:49] you know normally in court they'll say
[52:51] well this previous case did the same
[52:54] kind of things they got this much and
[52:55] this other case did the same kind of
[52:56] thing they did that much then the
[52:58] prosecutor tries to you know give a set
[53:01] or get a sentence based on those two
[53:02] cases god doesn't work like that
[53:05] he doesn't say well you did this sure
[53:07] you've repented sure you know we're back
[53:09] in fellowship but you've got to sit in
[53:10] the naughty corner for a while
[53:12] god don't do that
[53:13] you repent and then you're free of the
[53:15] thing
[53:16] you genuinely repent say lord i'm sorry
[53:19] amen your friends think just keep
[53:20] walking on
[53:21] but the enemy says oh no you got to be
[53:23] humble you're going to be extra humble a
[53:25] bit longer
[53:26] and then you can earn your way back into
[53:27] fellowship no the only thing that earns
[53:29] you back into fellowship is a repentant
[53:30] heart and the blood of jesus christ
[53:32] pulls you back in
[53:34] amen so don't do a because you know
[53:37] people who do witch hunts really they're
[53:39] just anointed with the same spirit that
[53:40] was on the king of moab
[53:42] the king of moab got hired a prophet
[53:44] balaam
[53:45] tried to get uh god through balaam to
[53:48] curse israel
[53:49] the first time it didn't work see says
[53:51] well i'll just show you the back parts
[53:53] of israel show you all the nasty things
[53:55] that go on you know not the not the
[53:56] things that you know they would publish
[53:58] and not the things that look good out
[53:59] the front but uh all the nasty stuff
[54:01] that's going on in the camp
[54:03] and then so balaam saw these things and
[54:05] he gets anointed with the spirit of god
[54:07] now in his human mind he's thinking now
[54:08] surely god's going to curse these people
[54:10] but then now god begins to speak and
[54:12] balaam's got to hear god speak through
[54:13] his own lips and he says i see no
[54:15] iniquity in jacob
[54:17] i mean so that was that was god's
[54:19] response to what balaam was trying to
[54:21] balak was trying to do through balaam to
[54:22] get them to get him to curse israel i
[54:24] see no iniquity and jacob so you say
[54:27] well but you know
[54:29] it wasn't like they were sinless people
[54:31] now i'm not condoning sin okay but i
[54:32] just wanted to get a point across
[54:34] right it wasn't like they didn't have
[54:36] any trouble and there was no sin within
[54:38] the camp but because of the blood of
[54:39] bulls and goats god could not see it
[54:43] right now if sin is confessed amen it
[54:46] goes to the blood of jesus christ and
[54:48] it's gone
[54:49] people get worried about sitting in the
[54:51] church i ask you a question don't you
[54:52] think the spirit of god could call it
[54:53] out at any time
[54:56] don't you think
[54:57] that god could call you by name and call
[54:59] your address
[55:00] and say you did this on a certain day
[55:02] exactly this this is why you're thinking
[55:04] go down to the biggest detail
[55:06] don't you think god could do that
[55:09] i believe he can do it
[55:11] i've seen it happen
[55:13] god's called out sin but the reason he
[55:15] does that is to free the person under it
[55:17] amen so praise god so let's not get
[55:20] anointed with that kind of spirit when
[55:21] trouble comes and we think well there
[55:23] must be some secret sin going on in
[55:25] their life
[55:27] god will sort them out
[55:29] [Music]
[55:30] let's have a look at brother ron spencer
[55:32] who's seen his testimony
[55:35] i remember the first convention i went
[55:36] to in auckland uh brother andy and and
[55:38] sister brownie were there first
[55:39] convention ever went to my life i was on
[55:41] the front row
[55:42] it was awesome
[55:43] hallelujah what a powerful etrifying
[55:45] experience but he he gave you you know
[55:48] you know an account of a guy who tried
[55:50] to sell him life insurance
[55:52] and then brother ron he said no you
[55:54] can't sell me life insurance and the guy
[55:56] said okay try me he says well i've
[55:58] fallen off of roof 40 feet landed on my
[56:01] back on concrete broke every vertebrae
[56:02] in my body i've had a couple of strokes
[56:04] being bit my snake struck by lightning
[56:07] all these different kind of things and
[56:08] the guy said no no i can't sell your
[56:10] life insurance
[56:11] and that wasn't even and
[56:13] and by that stage he hadn't been burnt
[56:15] in the fire losing 70 odd at least
[56:17] percent of his lung lung capacity but
[56:19] god supernaturally healed that and he
[56:20] didn't have the stage for cancer that he
[56:22] has right now
[56:23] the doctors gave him over two years ago
[56:26] a month to live he's still preaching
[56:28] he's still preaching and when i look at
[56:30] that i say well if that man can preach
[56:32] and give himself to god what's my excuse
[56:36] i don't have a stage for cancer kind of
[56:38] excuse he still perseveres
[56:41] amen so some people think oh he's got to
[56:43] be a secret sinner no no before he came
[56:45] into this last trial the lord so before
[56:47] he even realized he had cancer the lord
[56:49] said if you trust me i'll use you like
[56:51] never before yes so even through that
[56:53] trouble god has used them like never
[56:55] before why that the works of god would
[56:58] be manifested i did all was it as
[57:00] parents is it the church is it him no
[57:02] that the works of god will be manifested
[57:04] that's why god has allowed that and
[57:06] you've got to take the same thing to
[57:07] your own life why am i going through
[57:08] this that the works of god will be
[57:10] manifested hey because god wants to as
[57:12] we heard last wednesday prove his word
[57:14] through you
[57:17] hallelujah amen
[57:19] praise the lord hallelujah amen but you
[57:22] see faith faith has a real rest
[57:25] but it's not just a sit back put your
[57:27] feet up kind of rest no it's a rest you
[57:30] know god has everything under control
[57:32] can you imagine what what it was like
[57:35] for um what it was like for joshua
[57:38] god had already spoken to him joshua won
[57:40] as i was with moses so i'll be with you
[57:42] he was under the mandate you're going to
[57:44] take the children of israel into the
[57:45] land and place them in their in their
[57:47] adoptive positions in the land based on
[57:49] their on their names imagine the burden
[57:52] that he would have carried because this
[57:53] this responsibility was on him yeah it
[57:55] wasn't on anyone else it fell upon him
[57:57] it was his lot sure he had he had
[58:00] crossed the red sea he had seen he'd
[58:01] seen the plagues come down in egypt he
[58:03] saw god come down on mount sinai he saw
[58:05] many incredible things he'd been in the
[58:07] prince of god with moses many times but
[58:10] now the commission had landed upon his
[58:12] shoulders
[58:14] and so the lord said you're going to do
[58:16] the job
[58:18] but so so you imagine the responsibility
[58:20] that he had
[58:21] he was there to fulfill scripture just
[58:22] like we're here to fulfill scripture i
[58:24] mean there's going to be a people that
[58:26] these bodies are going to be changed i
[58:27] mean the people made in the image of the
[58:29] word in completeness amen this is the
[58:31] hour we live in we're living in the hour
[58:33] of the resurrection
[58:34] we're here to fulfill that word what a
[58:36] responsibility all the believers all
[58:38] down the ages are waiting for you
[58:41] because they said us without them
[58:43] without us cannot be made perfect
[58:45] they're waiting for us to come to our
[58:46] position then the life of jesus christ
[58:48] within us will call them from the grave
[58:51] amen why the condition of the harvest
[58:53] dictates when it's going to be harvested
[58:56] right the the farmer doesn't get up one
[58:58] day and say i feel like harvesting wheat
[58:59] today no he waits for the wheat to
[59:01] become golden to bound the presence of
[59:03] the sun he looks at its condition says
[59:05] now is the season so the life within the
[59:08] wheat cries to the farmer i'm ready
[59:11] and the life within us is crying out to
[59:13] the lord where any lord
[59:15] hallelujah so now joshua's standing
[59:18] there he's crushed jordan
[59:19] supernaturally but yet now he sees the
[59:22] walls of jericho he's thinking how we
[59:24] gonna how we're gonna get this thing
[59:27] they had no battering rams they had no
[59:29] siege equipment they had no ladders they
[59:30] had nothing that they could use to take
[59:32] that city
[59:34] but then now a man approaches him with a
[59:36] sword drawn
[59:37] and joshua says are you for us are you
[59:39] against us he says no but i come as the
[59:42] captain of the host of the lord i mean
[59:44] so that was god an angelic form step
[59:47] down to the battlefield saying joshua
[59:49] i've come to take over your battle
[59:52] i mean and not just this battle but the
[59:54] entire campaign
[59:56] just like amen so he could now rest
[59:58] that the five seven star general
[1:00:01] has come down to take over the entire
[1:00:03] campaign that will give him such a rest
[1:00:07] not a hope
[1:00:08] a revelation a rest
[1:00:11] that god was gonna do it you know that
[1:00:13] would have been such a motivation
[1:00:15] let's take every promise
[1:00:17] let's take jericho then we're going to
[1:00:19] take ai then we're going to go take
[1:00:20] these other cities it would have been
[1:00:22] such a motivating force every part of
[1:00:24] this land is out amen let's go get it
[1:00:27] because god is here to give it to us i
[1:00:29] mean but so he would oppress them to me
[1:00:31] that's real faith
[1:00:33] it's he wasn't wondering are we going to
[1:00:35] take it no
[1:00:36] he was going to take it because god
[1:00:38] revealed it to him and god came down to
[1:00:40] tell him i've come to lead you to ever
[1:00:41] through every victory that's the same
[1:00:43] thing with you and i when the holy ghost
[1:00:45] really comes in
[1:00:47] you don't have to hope
[1:00:49] you don't have to try and build faith in
[1:00:50] your mind remember faith is not some
[1:00:52] mental assessment like working out a
[1:00:54] maths equation no faith is revealed to
[1:00:57] you
[1:00:58] that it's yours and when the holy ghost
[1:01:00] comes and takes over your life by a full
[1:01:02] surrender
[1:01:04] then it's like josh the captain of the
[1:01:05] host of lord take over joshua's campaign
[1:01:08] you can rest and then just press the
[1:01:10] battle because you have a revelation a
[1:01:12] rest that god will take you through
[1:01:14] every battle
[1:01:17] praise the lord
[1:01:19] amen so to me that would take out all
[1:01:20] fear
[1:01:21] that would take out all worry how's it
[1:01:23] going to work out while god's going to
[1:01:24] work it out
[1:01:26] oh does that mean you just kick back and
[1:01:27] relax no you press in
[1:01:29] because god has revealed it to you
[1:01:31] you're not hoping it's going to work you
[1:01:32] look at every divine promise of god you
[1:01:35] can have faith that in its season god
[1:01:36] will fulfill it
[1:01:38] right they took jericho but then they
[1:01:39] had certain order of battle they had to
[1:01:41] go through to take the whole land it's
[1:01:43] the same thing with you and i right you
[1:01:45] know there's pro yo you go into one
[1:01:46] promise then you go to another promise
[1:01:49] so for example repent and be baptized
[1:01:51] one promise you receive the holy ghost
[1:01:52] there's one promise i mean you can go to
[1:01:54] healing or restoration or something and
[1:01:56] god builds the character of christ and
[1:01:58] you see joy come into your life a peace
[1:02:00] that comes into your life the love of
[1:02:02] god comes into your life you see
[1:02:03] temperance come into your life patience
[1:02:05] with god comes into your life and you
[1:02:07] can rest because what you're getting
[1:02:08] victory
[1:02:10] but god ordains our steps
[1:02:13] hallelujah
[1:02:15] praise the lord so we can we can rest
[1:02:19] and we can have a real faith
[1:02:21] that what god has started he's going to
[1:02:23] finish
[1:02:25] hallelujah amen amen praise the lord
[1:02:30] amen
[1:02:31] you know abraham was the father of faith
[1:02:34] amen hallelujah
[1:02:36] amen
[1:02:37] he was an incredible believer
[1:02:39] he didn't have a bible
[1:02:41] he didn't have a church to go to
[1:02:43] he didn't have a preacher to preach at
[1:02:44] him didn't have musicians to lead songs
[1:02:47] in their song leader didn't have sunday
[1:02:48] school but he met god amen god called
[1:02:51] him
[1:02:52] god called him and he began to follow
[1:02:54] the voice of god
[1:02:55] now some people don't like the term
[1:02:57] progressive revelation but if you look
[1:02:58] at the life of abraham it was a
[1:03:00] progressive revelation because it
[1:03:02] started off saying leave this land i'll
[1:03:03] show you a land that's yours all right
[1:03:05] that was the first part of it and that
[1:03:07] first party didn't say you could ever
[1:03:08] promise something he didn't tell him the
[1:03:09] borders of the land that he dwelled in
[1:03:11] he didn't tell him that part of the
[1:03:12] promise is actually his seats going to
[1:03:13] go down to egypt come back 400 years
[1:03:15] later none of that so as he walked with
[1:03:17] god god unfolded the promise to him
[1:03:21] amen and then he came to a point in his
[1:03:23] life
[1:03:24] where he didn't laugh at the promise of
[1:03:26] god anymore
[1:03:27] his heart was turned to faith
[1:03:30] hallelujah so he came to a point
[1:03:33] where he staggered not at the promise of
[1:03:35] god through unbelief but was strong in
[1:03:37] faith giving glory to god
[1:03:40] now when he came to that point in his
[1:03:42] life it was physically impossible for
[1:03:44] him and sarah to have the child
[1:03:46] it was physically impossible but faith
[1:03:49] does not look at circumstances
[1:03:51] hallelujah remember the apostle paul was
[1:03:54] in a storm for 14 days
[1:03:56] and the ship was going up and it was
[1:03:57] going down and the clouds were covering
[1:03:59] the sun and all kinds of trouble going
[1:04:01] on but he wasn't looking at the storm he
[1:04:04] received a promise not in his ears but
[1:04:06] into his heart you're going to rome
[1:04:08] you're going to rome see faith has a
[1:04:10] rest i know my end destination
[1:04:13] what about all the details through it
[1:04:15] god will take you through
[1:04:16] amen god will take you through remember
[1:04:19] the prophet told us that nothing can
[1:04:20] take our lives till our purpose is done
[1:04:23] so nothing can take your life you can
[1:04:25] come you can be on death's door quite a
[1:04:27] few times but if it's not your time
[1:04:28] you're not going
[1:04:30] right but the lord can reveal to you
[1:04:31] it's your time and you can have peace
[1:04:34] hallelujah and really the outcome what
[1:04:36] does the outcome matter
[1:04:38] you know we we rejoice at the three
[1:04:40] hebrew children in the fiery furnace
[1:04:42] because they had fellowship with god in
[1:04:44] the fiery furnace
[1:04:45] but they would have been in paradise all
[1:04:47] the same if they never actually came out
[1:04:49] of the furnace
[1:04:50] hallelujah because remember their
[1:04:52] testimony was they stepped in there god
[1:04:54] harnessed that trouble because he wanted
[1:04:55] fellowship with his sons
[1:04:57] hallelujah and he decided i'm gonna have
[1:04:59] a private fellowship it's not gonna be
[1:05:01] here where everyone can hear it i'm
[1:05:02] gonna bring them into a furnace i'm
[1:05:04] gonna bring them to a time of trouble i
[1:05:06] mean they can worship me in the worst
[1:05:07] conditions possible which is a furnace
[1:05:10] hallelujah and sometimes god will take
[1:05:12] us into the worst conditions because he
[1:05:14] wants to have fellowship with you there
[1:05:17] many times we think i need to have the
[1:05:18] perfect sunset the perfect kind of vista
[1:05:20] on instagram then god can visit me no no
[1:05:22] and your trouble is where he wants to
[1:05:24] meet you he met the apostle paul and
[1:05:27] silas in a prison i mean just like he
[1:05:29] met him in a store so he can meet you in
[1:05:31] the same kind of conditions that's why
[1:05:33] you got to look up when you're in
[1:05:35] trouble don't look around
[1:05:36] don't look down look up because god
[1:05:38] wants to escort you through the trial
[1:05:40] and reveal himself in the trial
[1:05:43] hallelujah so we know they had
[1:05:45] fellowship with him there in the furnace
[1:05:47] but really if we cut a
[1:05:49] change the story a bit we go into
[1:05:51] paradise
[1:05:52] and we step into paradise just imagine
[1:05:54] one of the old testament believers
[1:05:56] we step into paradise
[1:05:58] and you happen to sit down next to
[1:05:59] shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:06:02] and their testimony would have been
[1:06:05] amen the king made this image of our
[1:06:07] friend
[1:06:08] we're not bowing to the image of a holy
[1:06:10] man
[1:06:10] we're not bound to the image of a
[1:06:12] prophet
[1:06:13] we we worship the lord god of israel we
[1:06:15] don't worship a prophet we worship the
[1:06:17] lord jesus christ around here we don't
[1:06:19] worship a prophet
[1:06:21] we don't worship brother brown we
[1:06:22] worship the lord jesus christ
[1:06:24] hallelujah i'll quote the apostle paul
[1:06:26] just as much i'll quote brother brown is
[1:06:27] that wrong
[1:06:29] amen if it lines up with the scripture
[1:06:30] it's worth quoting
[1:06:32] hallelujah
[1:06:33] so so we could so we're going to walk
[1:06:35] through the paradise sat down next and i
[1:06:36] said
[1:06:38] the king at our time was king
[1:06:39] nebuchadnezzar you won't find him here
[1:06:41] maybe you know anyway
[1:06:44] and he said unless you bow to this image
[1:06:45] you're going to burn
[1:06:47] we decided we cannot go against the word
[1:06:49] of our god amen and the last words that
[1:06:51] left our lips were o king live forever
[1:06:54] yes
[1:06:55] we're not going to batter your image
[1:06:56] either god will deliver us or he won't
[1:06:58] but doesn't matter we're not going to
[1:06:59] bow see that's real faith
[1:07:01] that is not the outcome that matters
[1:07:03] it's actually i'm not turning from god
[1:07:05] so their testimony could have been and
[1:07:07] we were thrown to the furnace the next
[1:07:09] thing we knew we were here
[1:07:11] right to me that would be just as
[1:07:13] powerful
[1:07:14] as them having fellowship with the
[1:07:15] fourth man
[1:07:17] right but god does things to show you
[1:07:19] that in trouble he has fellowship with
[1:07:20] his children
[1:07:22] hallelujah that when we're in trouble we
[1:07:24] can praise god and say god you're here
[1:07:26] in the furnace
[1:07:27] i mean because remember that furnace was
[1:07:29] was was burning seven times hotter than
[1:07:32] it ever was and this age is burning
[1:07:33] seven times hotter than it has in
[1:07:35] previous ages until we can come into
[1:07:38] this age with complex like they were
[1:07:39] tied up they didn't walk and they are
[1:07:41] thrown in so we can be tied up with
[1:07:43] spiritual amnesia not knowing who will
[1:07:45] work complexes pains things passed down
[1:07:48] from our lineage but in the fire with
[1:07:51] the fourth man i mean all those things
[1:07:53] are busted amen amnesia goes complexes
[1:07:56] go pain goes where he goes fear goes why
[1:08:00] because we're with the fourth man
[1:08:02] which is the lord jesus christ we can
[1:08:05] have confidence in our god
[1:08:08] hallelujah amen so
[1:08:12] abraham would stagger not at the promise
[1:08:13] of god
[1:08:16] it was impossible as i was saying for
[1:08:18] him and sarah to have the child but god
[1:08:19] said they were going to have the child
[1:08:21] he came to a point where god just
[1:08:23] revealed to him you're going to have the
[1:08:24] son
[1:08:25] amen it would take a visitation of god
[1:08:28] to both of their him and sarah
[1:08:31] to have it
[1:08:32] you know you can be the only one in your
[1:08:34] family that god has met
[1:08:36] don't think you're the only one he's
[1:08:37] ever going to meet
[1:08:39] brother brown with dramatizer on the
[1:08:41] planes of memory there you know
[1:08:43] lot was down in sodom
[1:08:45] you know mrs abraham was complaining
[1:08:47] about the desert and the dust and the
[1:08:49] tents and all the you know mrs lot was
[1:08:51] getting way better stuff down inside him
[1:08:52] but but sarah was complaining there and
[1:08:54] you know she was getting a bit fussy
[1:08:56] the reason why that was is because she
[1:08:58] hadn't had her visitation yet but
[1:09:00] because she was part of the promise she
[1:09:02] had to have a visit from god
[1:09:04] just like you and i i mean you may have
[1:09:06] not had a visit yet but i believe god is
[1:09:08] here to give you a visitation to turn
[1:09:10] your heart from unbelief to faith
[1:09:12] amen so god god god put on flesh him and
[1:09:15] two angels he blew some dust come here
[1:09:17] gabriel step into this michael step into
[1:09:20] this i want to go fellowship with my son
[1:09:23] hallelujah and then and the brotherhood
[1:09:25] says that abraham kept the spiritual
[1:09:27] atmosphere around him
[1:09:28] because he was under expectation that
[1:09:31] god was going to come and visit sarah so
[1:09:34] he wasn't listening to her
[1:09:36] complaining
[1:09:38] and letting it wear him down
[1:09:40] he was holding he loved her so much
[1:09:43] that he wanted her to have the same
[1:09:45] visitation he had
[1:09:47] right so he could look beyond her
[1:09:48] condition and say god because she's part
[1:09:51] of the promise you have to come visit
[1:09:52] her
[1:09:53] right so he kept a spiritual atmosphere
[1:09:55] around him and that's what drew got
[1:09:57] close
[1:09:58] halloween don't you love to draw him
[1:10:00] clock
[1:10:00] there's just something but the thing is
[1:10:02] he puts it on you
[1:10:03] but isn't it good yo you begin to sing
[1:10:05] something
[1:10:07] hallelujah you begin to praise god
[1:10:09] you begin to sing something and then the
[1:10:11] atmosphere changes the sweet humble
[1:10:13] feeling comes over you brotherham says
[1:10:14] it's the angels of god they've come to
[1:10:16] step into your worship but oh what's
[1:10:18] going on down here i'm going to spend
[1:10:19] some time in this and then god steps
[1:10:21] down into it
[1:10:23] hallelujah but he does it for a reason
[1:10:25] it's not just to bless you but it's for
[1:10:27] a reason
[1:10:28] so abraham created that kind of uh
[1:10:30] atmosphere then god stepped down into
[1:10:32] that
[1:10:33] and abraham's in the tent behind them
[1:10:36] and god says abraham where's your wife
[1:10:37] sarah
[1:10:38] and abram says she's in the tent behind
[1:10:40] you
[1:10:41] and and god says to him according to
[1:10:43] time of life
[1:10:44] you're going to have the promised son
[1:10:46] and she within her heart laughed
[1:10:48] saying how can this be this is
[1:10:49] impossible
[1:10:51] was actually making fun of the promise
[1:10:52] of god and god said abraham why did she
[1:10:55] laugh
[1:10:56] and she came out she laughed in her
[1:10:58] heart you gotta read genesis 18. and
[1:10:59] then he said i mean then she said no i
[1:11:01] didn't laugh he said yeah you did
[1:11:03] he said you're going to have the son
[1:11:05] right and that says after that keep
[1:11:07] reading then god visited sarah
[1:11:10] and then she had the son and then in
[1:11:12] hebrews 11 it says that she judged him
[1:11:14] faithful by faith
[1:11:16] sarah got the strength to to to conceive
[1:11:20] because she judged him faithful who had
[1:11:23] promised
[1:11:24] right so when you judge him faithful
[1:11:27] there's a rest in that
[1:11:29] amen because you're not trying to say
[1:11:30] can he do it can't he do it will he do
[1:11:32] it won't he do it no you've judged him
[1:11:33] faithful he's revealed it to you so it's
[1:11:36] not a hope it's an oso
[1:11:38] and then you can rest than that
[1:11:41] hallelujah
[1:11:42] [Music]
[1:11:43] amen so why does trouble come
[1:11:46] to bring you into a closer fellowship
[1:11:48] with god amen
[1:11:50] there must be sin in your life this is
[1:11:52] why this is going on not necessarily
[1:11:54] that the works of god would be
[1:11:55] manifested amen
[1:11:57] hallelujah
[1:11:58] so let's not be like job's friends
[1:12:00] let's not be like balak the king of moab
[1:12:03] trying to find the hindu parts of
[1:12:05] something
[1:12:06] let's just walk with god
[1:12:08] you know who the
[1:12:10] you know brother brown no the bible says
[1:12:13] that that
[1:12:15] a more powerful spirit could not be
[1:12:16] overcome by a less powerful spirit not
[1:12:18] at all
[1:12:19] so if god steps in if god is
[1:12:23] the strong man of the house
[1:12:25] right this strong man who can come in
[1:12:28] who can come in and bind him up and
[1:12:30] throw him out no one can amen right so
[1:12:33] if you've really received the holy ghost
[1:12:35] it should give you a really burly faith
[1:12:38] now we're uh you know we are not walking
[1:12:40] around
[1:12:42] terrified the devil's going to get us
[1:12:44] that's right
[1:12:46] you know the devil says i'm going to get
[1:12:47] you
[1:12:48] he says i've already been got by jesus
[1:12:51] the king of glory has already got me
[1:12:54] so there's nothing you can do against me
[1:12:56] that is not without his permission
[1:12:59] right and all things are working
[1:13:01] together for my god
[1:13:02] right if he is really the strong man in
[1:13:04] your life the lord is don't be afraid of
[1:13:07] the devil
[1:13:09] lord you don't go looking for a fight
[1:13:10] but you just keep walking with god the
[1:13:12] devil try and put roadblocks in your way
[1:13:14] you just keep walking through
[1:13:17] because no weapon formed against he
[1:13:18] shall prosper well what kind of weapons
[1:13:20] are they pride
[1:13:22] guilt
[1:13:23] shame
[1:13:24] envy strife
[1:13:26] unforgiveness bitterness resentment all
[1:13:29] those kind of weapons
[1:13:32] none of those
[1:13:34] will they'll try and be formed against
[1:13:35] you
[1:13:36] that pridefield coming oh look i've
[1:13:38] really made it right i'm in the third
[1:13:40] pole
[1:13:42] i am the third you know i'm better than
[1:13:44] this person that's pride i can't i can't
[1:13:46] forgive that per i don't have to forgive
[1:13:48] that person
[1:13:49] the judgment starts at the house of god
[1:13:51] and i'm judging them
[1:13:53] you know envy i can't oh that person got
[1:13:55] why do they get that job why they got
[1:13:56] more money than me this is not fair you
[1:13:59] know jealousy whatever more
[1:14:01] those thoughts begin to come but if the
[1:14:03] strong man is there
[1:14:04] and you know the shepherd's voice he'll
[1:14:06] say
[1:14:07] i'm not telling you that the devil's
[1:14:09] telling you that
[1:14:11] but those weapons will be formed against
