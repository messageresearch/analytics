[49:38] out a forth out of my mouth it shall not
[49:41] return unto me void but it shall
[49:43] accomplish that which I please and it
[49:45] shall prosper in the thing whereto I
[49:47] sent it for ye shall go out with joy and
[49:50] be led forth with peace the mountains
[49:53] and the hills shall break forth before
[49:55] you into singing and all the trees of
[49:58] the field shall clap their hands amen

[51:43] father and Lord I just want to commit
[51:45] the service into your hands and in Jesus
[51:48] Christ's name Amen
[51:50] I mean god bless your friends you may
[51:51] have your seats this morning so I wonder
[51:53] I want to speak I want to kind of
[51:55] continue in a way from from last last
[51:58] Sunday about missing the point but I
[52:00] want to go in a kind of a very different
[52:02] way but you know we we read here where
[52:05] where God said his word shall not return
[52:08] to Him void but it will accomplish that
[52:10] which he sent it to do and and now we're
[52:13] looking at this man called Caleb II know
[52:15] I just want to go from the beginning you
[52:17] know Caleb he didn't miss the point of
[52:19] of Moses
[52:22] ministry you know he he was a man where
[52:24] you know I just want you to just think
[52:26] about it just now we're we're imagine
[52:29] imagine being and so I'm just going to
[52:31] get comfortable that's okay maybe I need
[52:34] to lose you but uh I need to do
[52:36] something there we go okay maybe we'll
[52:38] do this as well over here but you know
[52:40] God you know Jesus would say in John
[52:44] chapter six he says the words I speak to
[52:46] you that spirit in their life so we must
[52:49] understand that there's a principle
[52:50] where the words that we speak it may it
[52:53] doesn't matter who's doing the speaking
[52:55] but there's a spirit that travels on
[52:57] those words and that will manifest it
[53:00] will produce whatever that word is you
[53:03] know the emptying of that being spoken
[53:04] it will produce it so for example you
[53:07] take I don't know if anyone's ever
[53:08] watched you know any any World War two
[53:12] footage but you take a Hitler win you
[53:14] know there was an anointing that came
[53:16] upon that man and and he began to speak
[53:19] you know speak some things and he would
[53:22] he would begin to say about how you know
[53:24] they are the master race and they're the
[53:26] master people and all those different
[53:27] kind of things and he released an
[53:29] anointing upon a nation where they were
[53:31] beaten down from World War one they were
[53:33] you know you know you know they were
[53:35] they were downtrodden the whole you know
[53:37] Europe was in turmoil there was a lot of
[53:40] revolutions and things from will one to
[53:42] World War two you know a lot of fighting
[53:44] going on but he came a man and and and
[53:46] the devil anointed this man and if you
[53:49] ever see him when heat so I just got a
[53:51] I'm kicking a folder it's not good now
[53:54] if you ever see if you ever see footage
[53:56] of him at his political rallies he does
[53:58] not stand like we would we would take a
[54:00] a politician and maybe you know you know
[54:03] stand perfectly well and speak slowly
[54:05] and calmly no he you could see he was
[54:08] anointed who's ever seen footage I mean
[54:11] of Hitler and what he would do is when
[54:13] after he would finish and I'll call it
[54:15] preaching he would say I'm in and that
[54:18] was it and we know in the in the in the
[54:20] Reformed Church the Dutch Reformed
[54:21] Church I don't know what to be like in
[54:23] Germany but that's the last word the
[54:24] preacher would say is amen
[54:26] they finished what they had preached and
[54:28] so now here was a man under demon
[54:30] anointing and he was releasing a word
[54:33] upon a people I mean he was a release
[54:35] and anointing a lot of people and the
[54:37] things that they would never consider
[54:39] doing wiping out the Jews hating other
[54:41] races you know those things before he
[54:44] preached they would have never
[54:45] considered those things but then that
[54:46] spirit came upon them they recognized
[54:49] what they thought they were the master
[54:50] people I mean and that anointing came
[54:52] upon the people and instead the whole
[54:54] nation and they led the world into war
[54:57] that did great brutal things I mean they
[54:59] they taught their people that the
[55:01] Russians were not even human and they
[55:02] did great barbaric things when they
[55:04] invaded Russia why because an anointing
[55:07] came upon them through words
[55:08] I mean it's through words you take you
[55:12] take you know Karl Marx who is the
[55:13] founder of what were you know you know
[55:15] you know the communist thought he's
[55:17] actually buried and I'm in England and
[55:20] and if you go read about him though you
[55:22] know his his close followers there some
[55:25] of them were so convinced if they just
[55:27] publish this thing throughout Europe
[55:28] there being a immediate revolution they
[55:31] were so gripped why because an anointing
[55:33] was being released through words a
[55:36] spirit was being released through words
[55:38] amen and it's the same thing today even
[55:43] right now every word you hear there's a
[55:46] spirit behind that and it wants you to
[55:48] do certain things
[55:50] it has agendas the devil has an agenda
[55:52] God has an agenda amen but it's who you
[55:56] open yourself up to as that's what
[55:59] you'll manifest because not everyone in
[56:01] Nazi Germany actually became caught up
[56:03] in it you know
[56:05] there's a photo if you've seen oh I
[56:06] don't have it on me but there's a
[56:08] there's like um there's a whole photo of
[56:10] a crowd they're all giving the Hitler
[56:12] salute but one man he's like this he
[56:15] didn't get caught up he didn't get
[56:18] caught up what was going on he wasn't he
[56:21] didn't open himself up to that spirit I
[56:23] don't know who he is I don't know if
[56:25] they even know here's I say God bless
[56:26] that man least he had a better gumption
[56:29] to not just float with the tide we don't
[56:31] want to just go with the flow everyone
[56:33] else is doing oh it's cool it's trending
[56:35] who cares about trending I mean I want
[56:37] to do what God wants me to do that's
[56:39] trending that's eternal trending holy
[56:42] the hashtag never gets all that ever
[56:43] changes know what God does is the
[56:46] trending thing hallelujah so now
[56:49] we see so sir a word so so words spirits
[56:52] travel onwards hallelujah you know but
[56:56] then you take so for example if you go
[56:57] look at history you go look at the First
[56:59] Crusade how did they form the First
[57:01] Crusade who knows about the Crusades
[57:03] they preached around Europe and England
[57:05] preaching about crusade because that was
[57:08] the that was the most effective way of
[57:10] transmitting an idea was preaching
[57:14] because they don't have the printing
[57:15] press in those days they couldn't
[57:17] quickly you know duplicate things like
[57:19] it could and yolu Thursday
[57:20] so it was preaching was the most
[57:23] effective way they went around Europe
[57:24] preaching we've got to take the Holy
[57:26] Land back what happened they released an
[57:28] anointing why didn't they think about
[57:30] doing it before because a demon got in
[57:32] those people because it's political
[57:33] powers under under the veil of religion
[57:36] and then so they went around preaching
[57:37] we're gonna take the holy land back take
[57:39] it back from the Muslims whatever and
[57:41] then they started the crusade and they
[57:43] did barbaric things they even ate people
[57:45] crazy stuff all under the name of
[57:48] religion brought heaven and anointing
[57:49] was released why do people go you know
[57:54] we just had Isis raise up and it's doing
[57:57] whatever it's done and now it's done
[57:59] people from from from Europe they get
[58:02] suddenly radicalized have no history of
[58:05] Islam and their family they get really
[58:08] radicalized the next thing they know
[58:09] they go disappearing and then they're
[58:12] driving a suicide truck in Syria blowing
[58:14] themselves up
[58:15] why what happen they win on meat now
[58:18] there's nothing wrong with this device
[58:21] just like there's nothing wrong with the
[58:24] printed printed material you know it's
[58:26] not the it's not the medium that's the
[58:29] thing it's the words or the spirit
[58:31] behind what's being transmitted I mean
[58:34] so there's nothing wrong with this it's
[58:36] what's being trimmed transmitted through
[58:38] this is the problem right so now you see
[58:42] people you know everyone knows about it
[58:44] hey people from Europe they disappeared
[58:46] where they go they end up young people
[58:47] not just old young people why what
[58:50] happened somehow they found themselves
[58:51] looking because it because it's evolved
[58:54] from speech to video or tape now it's on
[58:57] the internet and people are watching
[58:59] films of Isis and what
[59:02] the spirit grabs them and it anoints
[59:05] them and something that would never have
[59:07] considered doing now they want to be a
[59:09] suicide bomber in Syria or in Iraq why
[59:12] because there's a spirit traveling on a
[59:14] word I meant this thing is now many
[59:18] people you know they think you know a
[59:21] lot of us can't survive in the bush I'll
[59:26] say I'm included I couldn't survive in
[59:28] this bush I'll die I you know I know how
[59:32] to find maybe the north yo you know
[59:34] North is pointing in
[59:35] well I in here I know you know currently
[59:37] the bark is thicker on one side of the
[59:39] tree and you know in here I've heard
[59:40] about it but I've never tried it you
[59:42] know but I would die cuz I'm not used to
[59:45] the environment I don't know how to
[59:47] survive there but the problem is very
[59:50] few of us know how to survive in this
[59:52] world you know out there sure you know
[59:56] these things that maybe can kill you you
[59:58] know if you go out there in the roar
[59:59] stag would have a go you may be a wild
[1:00:01] pig whatever you know but there's demon
[1:00:04] power in this place
[1:00:05] here you know and we have to know how to
[1:00:08] survive and overcome in this world amen
[1:00:14] because if we are not you know if we
[1:00:15] just walk you're you take some you know
[1:00:17] you take some animal where is it brother
[1:00:21] Chris you know who saw that footage
[1:00:23] there's that piglet and it's got its
[1:00:25] head and that dirt and he's and he's
[1:00:27] walking up behind it who saw that you
[1:00:29] know and this pig is oblivious of what's
[1:00:32] going on here's a man he doesn't have a
[1:00:33] gun he's got a Camrys trying to grab
[1:00:35] this pig this pig had no idea there was
[1:00:38] someone creeping up on him
[1:00:39] cuz he was just caught up on what he was
[1:00:41] doing and if brother Chris had a knife
[1:00:44] or a gun hey we would have had some we
[1:00:46] would have had some book you know he
[1:00:49] would have brought home the bacon but
[1:00:51] many of us are like that pig the devil
[1:00:54] put something out eat this oh it's so
[1:00:57] good because it pandas to the flesh
[1:00:58] sinners enticing it's engineered to to
[1:01:02] this thing likes it it's enticing so
[1:01:06] it's like you know that pig find some
[1:01:08] grub it's got its heat in the dirt
[1:01:09] having a wonderful time it thinks it
[1:01:11] doesn't know it could die he even got it
[1:01:13] by one of the league's it was
[1:01:16] it was that close some of us sometimes
[1:01:18] the devil's got a spy League why cuz
[1:01:22] he's put something out in front of us
[1:01:23] and we're all this is wonderful this is
[1:01:25] what I'm looking for now what's happened
[1:01:26] we've watched something a spurt yeah
[1:01:30] because I remember when I was flaring
[1:01:32] now you know my flatmates were
[1:01:35] Christians they will caught up and and

[1:01:41] but they became so involved in the show
[1:01:44] they were shocked how could this person
[1:01:47] cheat on this one and this one did this
[1:01:48] ELISA and it's fictitious it's it's a
[1:01:52] drama so it can't just be you know none

[1:02:05] watching they were shocked ha I have the
[1:02:07] IQ and they were talked about and they
[1:02:09] were emotionally involved with the show

[1:03:34] thought about this but it's just like my
[1:03:36] flatmates were the TV show now it's
[1:03:38] people on YouTube it's just evolved
[1:03:41] what's happened a spirit and stairs
[1:03:46] people and they don't want to and now
[1:03:49] they can't function in in reality you
[1:03:53] know the World Health Organization I'm
[1:03:55] just this is this is Here I am the World
[1:03:58] Health Organization 28th of May this
[1:04:01] year declared officially recognized a
[1:04:05] gaming disorder as mental health issue
[1:04:08] so computer gaming they recognized it as
[1:04:12] they call it a gaming disorder and it's
[1:04:16] when it's and it's when people place
[1:04:19] their need for gaming above other
[1:04:21] activities so what's that that's the
[1:04:25] same as gambling same as alcoholism same
[1:04:28] as taking drugs why do people why do
[1:04:31] people basically get you know they get
[1:04:33] hooked on methamphetamine or any other
[1:04:34] drug they will rob their own mother and
[1:04:37] if they could sell her they would to get
[1:04:40] money for that drug why because now that
[1:04:43] there's a spirits come upon them why did
[1:04:46] why did people take your ancient
[1:04:48] religions they took drugs to contact the
[1:04:50] spirit world I I had to I had to do
[1:04:54] research I had to sit tests because you
[1:04:56] know how I do drug testing I had to sit
[1:04:58] here written tests in order to to to be
[1:05:02] able to be qualified to release results
[1:05:05] because I release results that were
[1:05:07] given and so I had to study at least he
[1:05:10] and methamphetamine and fit I mean all
[1:05:11] these different drugs pseudoephedrine
[1:05:13] you know and a lot of them a lot of them
[1:05:17] came out of universities they actually
[1:05:19] tested them within the University and
[1:05:22] the people that first took the max he
[1:05:24] had a spiritual experience they said
[1:05:25] they weren't religious people but they
[1:05:28] had the spiritual awakening well it
[1:05:30] happened cause this cuz it cause it
[1:05:32] opened their spirit round to have a
[1:05:33] spiritual experience with a demon you
[1:05:38] take me 10 feet of me and stuff like
[1:05:39] that do you know where that became big
[1:05:41] it was given to soldiers in World War
[1:05:43] because it because it is a stimulant it
[1:05:46] was actually state-sponsored drug taking
[1:05:48] and now here's the problem
[1:05:51] now now it's gone through the world as a
[1:05:53] moneymaker but what's happened so drag
[1:05:57] taking stuff it's an addiction but it
[1:06:00] opens you up to a spirit world
[1:06:02] that's why shamans and stuff they take
[1:06:04] marijuana because I want to get in touch
[1:06:05] with the spirits and they did right and
[1:06:09] it's the same thing but but that's
[1:06:11] addiction what's happening a spirit
[1:06:13] comes into a person and and that spirit
[1:06:15] has feeding on that thing I mean just
[1:06:18] like I was an alcoholic there was a
[1:06:19] there was a desire in me to have it it
[1:06:22] wasn't like I was totally neutral I
[1:06:24] y'all have it today not know there was a
[1:06:25] genuine thirst
[1:06:27] I got I need a beer where is one I'm
[1:06:29] gonna have one you have quite jug Monday
[1:06:32] you start on Wednesday then you here
[1:06:33] take a break Thursday then you're back
[1:06:35] on Monday again why cuz there's a hunger
[1:06:39] and a thirst that's why you know you got
[1:06:42] to see what's driving you to do the
[1:06:44] things you do what's true what drove the
[1:06:47] Nazis to kill the Jews a spirit what
[1:06:50] motivated them they weren't just it
[1:06:51] wasn't a stab in the dark thing they
[1:06:54] used IBM punch hole machines to actually
[1:06:58] plan the whole thing and it was actually
[1:07:00] been proven without that technology they
[1:07:02] couldn't have been so efficient and and
[1:07:04] and mass murder they planned it they
[1:07:08] actually did test to see the most
[1:07:09] effective way to kill people
[1:07:12] well it's having a spirit god on people
[1:07:15] with most of our medical researchers
[1:07:18] come from the Nazi scientists because
[1:07:22] they didn't value the humans that
[1:07:24] they're testing it on there were just
[1:07:26] objects to them why cuz the spirit got
[1:07:29] on people what what you know because
[1:07:31] it's not human for people to to one day
[1:07:34] others a human being next day this is
[1:07:36] not a human being it's a spirit actually
[1:07:38] clouds people's judgement so what about
[1:07:42] you know as I've said before there's
[1:07:44] this there's I don't know how many tens
[1:07:46] of thousands of young men and and and
[1:07:48] Japan they call the hick amore they they
[1:07:51] withdraw from society they live in it
[1:07:53] and you know with the appearance in a
[1:07:56] bedroom and
[1:07:56] come out they just play video games all
[1:07:58] day just on the internet all day and
[1:08:01] there's people there trying to try to
[1:08:04] get them out of this what's having a
[1:08:07] spirits come upon them and they see no
[1:08:09] way out because the devil never gives
[1:08:11] you a way out he never gives you a way
[1:08:13] to overcome
[1:08:14] he always says no this is you or you're
[1:08:16] stuck this way your mouths are just here
[1:08:17] you are here's your prison cell enjoy
[1:08:19] this you know this you say well this

[1:08:26] here it's very much here people are so
[1:08:29] people you know I know people that you
[1:08:32] know in my day there's a game called
[1:08:34] World of Warcraft I don't care if it's
[1:08:35] still there people quit University to
[1:08:38] play the game
[1:08:39] that's a gaming disorder they became
[1:08:41] hooked nothing wrong with the computer
[1:08:44] nothing wrong with the Internet it's the
[1:08:46] what's coming through it I mean you say
[1:08:49] well we can't stop it no you can't stop
[1:08:51] it but you gotta have discernment what
[1:08:53] are you looking at that's the biggest
[1:08:55] thing we need lord teach us between
[1:08:57] right and wrong you be the inside
[1:08:59] teacher I mean it shouldn't be our
[1:09:01] parents telling us what to do what not
[1:09:03] to do the Holy Ghost should be in our
[1:09:05] life so strong as soon as you look at it
[1:09:07] something and you should say that's
[1:09:08] wrong I don't like that that's
[1:09:10] disgusting
[1:09:11] amen the things I once did I can't do no

[1:13:31] sign that pledge to come to Sunday
[1:13:33] school at least six months out of every
[1:13:35] year and I've seen a little old girl
[1:13:37] down below the hill there where I've
[1:13:39] been working and she come out of there
[1:13:41] and I was standing at the door knocked
[1:13:43] at the door she came to the door and she
[1:13:45] was some of these here world kept
[1:13:47] players you know like this bunch they
[1:13:50] had to have a rest that I mean down here
[1:13:53] in Phoenix last night I believe it was
[1:13:55] doing this new kind of rock and roll or
[1:13:58] twisters whatever it was and they had to
[1:14:00] get the cops to come get them you fix he
[1:14:03] says young folks don't you understand
[1:14:05] that that is the spirit of the devil
[1:14:06] under the influence - they don't know
[1:14:08] what they was out on the streets
[1:14:09] carrying on some like some of these
[1:14:12] comedians or these record players or
[1:14:14] jockey so forth I mean going to play in
[1:14:17] a city and the young ladies taking off
[1:14:19] their underneath clothes throw it on the
[1:14:20] platform for these boys to autograph
[1:14:22] don't you realize that's the devil
[1:14:24] that's the spirit of last days of such a
[1:14:26] shame there you go gone wild this young
[1:14:29] woman she came out carrying on she
[1:14:31] didn't even know forgot me standing at
[1:14:33] the door and she said oh pardon me I
[1:14:34] forgot you about you standing there
[1:14:36] and she throat a kiss to that God in the
[1:14:38] radio or whatever it was she said I'll
[1:14:40] meet you out at the Greenbrier patch or
[1:14:43] whatever it was they was going to have
[1:14:45] Scylla some kind of a dance that night
[1:14:47] and I said to dr. Brown which was a
[1:14:49] friend of mine how is your congregation
[1:14:51] holding out their belief I said fine I
[1:14:53] give them pills he said what kind of
[1:14:55] pills I said Gospels that sure keeps
[1:14:58] them coming all the time see and he told
[1:15:00] me about that signing those pledges I
[1:15:02] said dr. Brown do you think of that
[1:15:04] wildcat player on that radio would have
[1:15:06] to make that girl sign a pledge that
[1:15:08] she'd be ever over there that night not
[1:15:11] at all she had porn what clothes she had
[1:15:13] to get there why it's something in her
[1:15:15] that's connected her a spirit to that
[1:15:18] worldly amusement and until the Church
[1:15:20] of the Living God that's called the
[1:15:21] Bride of Christ gets herself connected
[1:15:23] with God like that she'll still wallow
[1:15:25] in the world and the miry clay of sin
[1:15:28] until she's connected with God in such a
[1:15:30] way till her heart is so filled with
[1:15:33] glory and power of God till she can't
[1:15:35] see nothing else but Christ that's right
[1:15:38] that's what we have to do that's the
[1:15:40] only plan that's the only program God
[1:15:42] has is to do a thing like that you've
[1:15:44] got not to be artificially took in
[1:15:46] you've got to be born again not shook in
[1:15:49] or get a letter to the church to be born
[1:15:51] in a church the Living God by
[1:15:52] regeneration by the power of the
[1:15:54] resurrection of Jesus Christ that makes
[1:15:56] you a new creature and heard Amen that
[1:15:58] straightens it up it sure does
[1:16:00] hallelujah see that girl no one had to
[1:16:03] come alongside now you've got to listen
[1:16:05] to this negative that's not the spirit
[1:16:06] and it was now in her she she was united
[1:16:09] with it that's why she died she carried
[1:16:10] on she didn't care
[1:16:12] because the spirit in her was connected
[1:16:14] with it amen
[1:16:16] how much more us friends hallelujah
[1:16:18] because the thing is we're going to
[1:16:19] recognize we don't just grow into this I
[1:16:22] mean we don't just grow into the Holy
[1:16:25] Ghost no we're going to meet him I mean
[1:16:26] I believe in a different experience I
[1:16:29] mean I believe in a different meeting
[1:16:30] with God I mean Moses didn't imagine he
[1:16:33] met God he met God I mean Joshua didn't
[1:16:35] imagine he meant they kept her to the
[1:16:37] hosts he meant they kept in the house
[1:16:38] the Apostle Paul didn't imagine he meant
[1:16:40] the pillar of fire he meant the pillar
[1:16:42] of fire I
[1:16:43] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:16:45] forever amen we have to have a meeting
[1:16:47] with him hallelujah and that will change
[1:16:50] our whole lives hallelujah and if you've
[1:16:52] had that meeting Amen you should be the
[1:16:54] boldest Amen let nothing stop you let
[1:16:58] nothing push you to one side I mean you
[1:16:59] should know who you are
[1:17:01] hallelujah Amen you see because you know
[1:17:04] this promise in the and you're in the
[1:17:06] book of Ephesians where we would say in
[1:17:09] Ephesians 1 and 3 blessed be the God and
[1:17:11] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has
[1:17:13] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[1:17:15] in heavenly places in Christ according
[1:17:18] as he has chosen us in him before the
[1:17:19] foundation of the world that we should
[1:17:21] be holy and without blame before him and
[1:17:23] loved having predestinated us unto the
[1:17:26] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:17:28] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:17:30] of his will to the praise of the glory
[1:17:32] of His grace and Heath made us accepted
[1:17:35] in the beloved
[1:17:36] hallelujah said now so so we have
[1:17:39] blessings all spiritual blessings in
[1:17:41] heavenly places in Christ now he said
[1:17:45] that we have been produced I'm just
[1:17:46] repeating myself now I'm still talking
[1:17:48] about what I've just spoken about ok but
[1:17:51] now there's a challenge now where he
[1:17:53] says if we have predestined to the
[1:17:55] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:17:57] himself now we know that this adoption
[1:17:59] is a placing of a child and a family
[1:18:01] right so it's not me going to China
[1:18:03] getting a Chinese baby writing some
[1:18:05] letters and say now she's a glowing or
[1:18:07] he's a glowing no it's a child that's
[1:18:09] been born into my family but comes to an
[1:18:11] age where they become placed in the
[1:18:13] family that what they say as good as
[1:18:15] what I say I mean because the same mind
[1:18:17] that's in me is in them that's the same
[1:18:19] thing with us in the Lord Jesus Christ I
[1:18:21] mean we're born into the kingdom of God
[1:18:23] holy but now God places us in the body
[1:18:25] of Christ I mean that now what we say
[1:18:28] hallelujah is what he would say and
[1:18:31] because now we are in our position of
[1:18:33] authority in Christ maybe but it's his
[1:18:35] doing
[1:18:36] I mean Ephesians 1 and 17 that God that
[1:18:39] the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:18:40] father of glory may give unto you the
[1:18:42] spirit of wisdom and the revelation and
[1:18:44] the knowledge of him the eyes of your
[1:18:46] understanding being enlightened that you
[1:18:48] may know what is the hope and we know
[1:18:50] hope in the Bible's expectation with
[1:18:52] pleasure of his calling
[1:18:54] hallelujah and what the riches of the
[1:18:56] glory
[1:18:57] of his inheritance in the Saints and
[1:18:58] what is the exceeding greatness of his
[1:19:01] power to us would who believe according
[1:19:03] to the working of his mighty power which
[1:19:05] he wrought in Christ when he raised him
[1:19:07] from the dead and set him at his own
[1:19:09] right hand in heavenly places far above
[1:19:12] all principality power and might and
[1:19:14] Dominion and every name that is named
[1:19:16] not only in this world but also in that
[1:19:19] which is to come and hath put all things
[1:19:21] under his feet and gave him to be the
[1:19:24] head over all things to the church which
[1:19:27] is his body the fullness of him that
[1:19:30] filleth all in all
[1:19:31] now we know a living person you can't
[1:19:34] separate the head from the body
[1:19:36] otherwise that person becomes dead
[1:19:38] yeah real real rule you you decapitate
[1:19:41] 100% of decapitations it up and death
[1:19:44] amen
[1:19:45] that's just how it does so so if you
[1:19:48] take the head from the body it's no
[1:19:49] longer a living being I mean but we're a
[1:19:51] living church we're living stones lively
[1:19:54] stones I mean so that means where the
[1:19:56] head is the body is also I mean if the
[1:19:59] head is at the right hand and heavenly
[1:20:01] places everything's under his feet I
[1:20:03] mean that means the body must follow the
[1:20:05] head how this to where the head is that
[1:20:07] where the body is they meant off he is
[1:20:09] the head is over all things he has two
[1:20:12] men you know for all things every work
[1:20:13] of the devil hallelujah every spirit I
[1:20:16] mean everything that's that can be named
[1:20:18] is under his feet I mean that the body
[1:20:20] of Christ is in the same position
[1:20:22] hallelujah I'm in it and and this is
[1:20:26] what he sees in Ephesians two and five I
[1:20:27] just want you to realize your position
[1:20:29] hallelujah
[1:20:30] Caleb had to recognize who he was I mean
[1:20:33] in the real I and the reason he realized
[1:20:35] who he was because he recognized I mean
[1:20:38] that there's a place in the promised
[1:20:40] land for him Holly that his inheritance
[1:20:42] was in the land Amen he knew he was the
[1:20:45] son of God hallelujah even so even so
[1:20:50] there's Ephesians two and five so when
[1:20:52] we are did and since it's quickened us
[1:20:54] together in Christ by grace you're saved
[1:20:55] and it's raised us up and made us to sit
[1:20:58] together in heavenly places in Christ
[1:21:01] Jesus but we have to understand that
[1:21:03] there's someone else trying to take our
[1:21:05] take our position I mean as as as the
[1:21:08] devil would would basically dethrone
[1:21:10] Adam
[1:21:10] Eva's being god of the earth hee-hee-hee
[1:21:12] dethrone them through deception and I
[1:21:14] just want to say this and and and and
[1:21:17] brother first said this to me and I
[1:21:19] thought it was real good the serpent
[1:21:21] goes to Eve and says if you partake of
[1:21:24] this fruit we know by your fruits you'll
[1:21:25] know them as an act you shall know good
[1:21:28] and evil they knew good then they know
[1:21:31] good they're in the god man you God why
[1:21:34] did they need to know evil what was the
[1:21:37] purpose ah you'll know evil and you know
[1:21:40] good and evil she should have stopped
[1:21:41] and thought but I already know good
[1:21:43] what can evil do to me what can evil do
[1:21:46] and that's the problem as the devil
[1:21:49] never revealed to her the consequence of
[1:21:52] what she was about to do
[1:21:53] he just paint something oh you'll know
[1:21:55] this oh you'll see what the world's
[1:21:57] really all about whoo he never showed
[1:22:01] her you gonna die
[1:22:02] there's gonna be every death every every
[1:22:05] piece of pain everything was was was
[1:22:07] resulted from that one act that was
[1:22:09] about to happen and you know things are
[1:22:12] put out Netflix YouTube Hollywood you
[1:22:15] know I can't say Hollywood no more
[1:22:16] because we've moved on right you know if
[1:22:19] I said Oz you know all these movies many
[1:22:21] of you think well man this guy's old I
[1:22:24] don't go to the movies I have it here
[1:22:26] you know but the thing is they have it
[1:22:29] people go in these films from
[1:22:31] relationship root 2 to relationship take
[1:22:33] one use them throw them out the next day
[1:22:35] there now there was someone else they
[1:22:37] never show the emotional damage and
[1:22:40] scars and pains because of that
[1:22:41] lifestyle the world will never show you
[1:22:44] them they will never ever show you that
[1:22:46] because if it don't show you that then
[1:22:48] anyone with the right mother say well
[1:22:51] it's not worth it I mean who wants who
[1:22:53] wants a whole bunch of pain and regret
[1:22:55] and scars and complexes and hurts
[1:22:57] because of things you did under the
[1:22:58] influence of the yo-yo of the devil know
[1:23:02] on what's there but Hollywood you know
[1:23:04] your entertainment doesn't show you
[1:23:06] those things I mean it it just puts it
[1:23:09] out this is a successful life and even
[1:23:11] just goes after all this is wonderful
[1:23:13] now I am there carrying all this pain
[1:23:15] and baggage and the world's broken you
[1:23:19] gotta look at as I see it about Hitler
[1:23:21] the whole nation was changed because a
[1:23:24] man
[1:23:25] Hollywood preachers Netflix preachers
[1:23:29] YouTube is preaching there's a message
[1:23:33] behind the message amen it's changing
[1:23:36] people's perception about things a
[1:23:39] minister's brother Steve Bruce Aune
[1:23:41] preached about the evolution of Lucifer
[1:23:43] or something and he's saying now
[1:23:45] Hollywood is trending these robots and
[1:23:47] everything now because the end goal that
[1:23:49] they wanted was I want to merge man and
[1:23:51] machine that's what they want to do and
[1:23:54] they've wanted to do it for decades
[1:23:55] that's what they wanted because they
[1:23:57] want eternal life
[1:23:58] they think they can merge you you know
[1:24:00] imagine that you get merged with a
[1:24:02] machine you can't die that's what they
[1:24:04] think they're trying to basically make a
[1:24:07] false new birth I mean they're trying to
[1:24:10] make a false eternity because the devil
[1:24:12] always tries to pervert what God wants
[1:24:14] to do I mean so so if so if God says I'm
[1:24:17] gonna send you a word it's going to give
[1:24:19] you a body change well what do they do
[1:24:20] they try and change your body by machine
[1:24:22] I'm gonna try and give you a glorified
[1:24:25] body by merging man with machine it's on
[1:24:27] its way it's on its way things are by
[1:24:31] design i watch the you know you know the
[1:24:35] owner of amazon gift bizarre whatever
[1:24:37] his name is
[1:24:38] you know he was 10 years old Amazon
[1:24:41] started off as an online bookstore it
[1:24:42] was never about selling books it's about
[1:24:45] harnessing the Internet to make money
[1:24:47] and he's he created a company about five
[1:24:49] years ago called Blue Origin do you know
[1:24:51] what it does do I know space travel
[1:24:55] space travel they have Rockets they have
[1:24:59] a lunar lander they're going to the moon
[1:25:01] they want to go to the moon they're
[1:25:03] already deploying satellites into space
[1:25:05] because when he was 10 years old he saw
[1:25:08] Neil Armstrong stand on the moon he said
[1:25:12] I'm gonna I want to do that but do you
[1:25:15] think his in goal is Mars or the moon no
[1:25:17] they want to create giant space stations
[1:25:20] and space where people live that's what
[1:25:23] he wants to altameyer he said his
[1:25:25] generation won't do up of the next
[1:25:26] generation will what happened he came
[1:25:28] under the influence of so he saw an
[1:25:30] image he saw an image of a man standing
[1:25:33] on a moon and something gripped him
[1:25:35] saying I want to be part of this and now
[1:25:38] of his energies you just take you take
[1:25:41] you know you take the technology they
[1:25:45] just have in their distribution centers
[1:25:46] just to get you your package in five
[1:25:48] days
[1:25:48] it's incredible but all that energy is
[1:25:51] not about selling stuff it's about
[1:25:52] making money to do other things right
[1:25:55] but he saw an image and it gripped them
[1:25:57] and his whole life is built around it I
[1:26:00] trust you've seen more than an image but
[1:26:02] a living God and loving God in this day
[1:26:05] and he's gripped you something and you
[1:26:07] said yes hallelujah I'm gonna whatever
[1:26:09] his word says Lord manifested in me
[1:26:11] Polaris brothers I said they have faith
[1:26:13] they believe they can do it then they
[1:26:15] actively work on that faith and created
[1:26:17] amen and if that is at it you know if
[1:26:20] that's fallen man your season Genesis 11
[1:26:23] about the Tower of Babel God scattered
[1:26:24] them because least because anything that
[1:26:27] let's just find it shall we let's go to
[1:26:30] Genesis 11 I want you to think about
[1:26:32] this
[1:26:47] verse 6 of Genesis 11 and the Lord said
[1:26:55] is everyone there and the Lord said
[1:26:58] Behold the people is one they all have
[1:27:00] one language and this they begin to do
[1:27:02] and now nothing will be restrained from
[1:27:04] them which they have imagined to do so
[1:27:08] nothing would be restrained from them
[1:27:10] which they have imagined to do what do
[1:27:13] you your man you know Amanda what does
[1:27:15] man imagine immortality space travel
[1:27:20] time travel : izing planets you think
[1:27:24] about it this is God saying this maybe
[1:27:27] it wasn't even NIMS you know all they
[1:27:29] wanna do is build a tower to escape
[1:27:31] God's judgment but guys actually I
[1:27:33] didn't find you know this man these men
[1:27:36] can actually do anything they imagined
[1:27:37] and what's happening now man has come
[1:27:41] together our imagination is not limited
[1:27:44] anymore you think about it I don't know
[1:27:47] about 500 years ago I don't know if they
[1:27:49] imagine space travel and building
[1:27:50] rockets and living you know you know
[1:27:52] merging themselves with machinery and
[1:27:55] things I don't know if they mention
[1:27:56] those things they do now and the thing
[1:28:01] is you take what is the universal
[1:28:03] language of science it's English that's
[1:28:07] English well it's happening languages
[1:28:09] are coming together for certain purposes
[1:28:11] they're being used for certain purposes
[1:28:12] to bring their to bring the world
[1:28:14] together to do what they want to do what
[1:28:18] about what God wants to do hallelujah
[1:28:21] we've come under one language amen the
[1:28:23] Word of God hallelujah where we have a
[1:28:25] heavenly language hallelujah
[1:28:28] amen so now here they are wanting to do
[1:28:32] why because they're being gripped by
[1:28:33] something and that now they actively
[1:28:36] pursue it now as as I said but there is
[1:28:43] there is others that are possessing your
[1:28:47] position because heavenly places our
[1:28:49] position in Christ right so the devil
[1:28:52] doesn't want you to take your position
[1:28:53] he wants us he wants us to be like the
[1:28:56] hick amore you know the meaning and
[1:28:59] young people in Japan or all sealed away
[1:29:01] in their room you know just living
[1:29:03] through a screen that's what he wants us
[1:29:04] to do that's not us taking our position
[1:29:06] now it's the world having dominion over
[1:29:08] people I mean to that so that's what he
[1:29:10] wants to produce that's not us taking
[1:29:12] our position that's actually demon power
[1:29:13] controlling people I mean but we've got
[1:29:16] to kick them out hallelujah the
[1:29:18] preaching of the gospel is actually that
[1:29:20] the Spirit of God comes down the demons
[1:29:22] come off people they can actually
[1:29:24] receive Christ I mean that's what
[1:29:26] preaching does hallelujah it moves the
[1:29:28] devil away their people then come to
[1:29:30] their right mind actually receive Christ
[1:29:31] hallelujah that's the purpose of having
[1:29:33] church I mean we you know we can't be
[1:29:36] ignorant to the fact you know you know
[1:29:38] we think people in straightjackets you
[1:29:40] know in in padded rooms are demon
[1:29:42] possessed or demon tormented now they're
[1:29:45] on the street amen and you can be
[1:29:48] tormented by the devil doesn't mean
[1:29:50] you're possessed by it but devil who's
[1:29:52] been troubled in their mind I mean I
[1:29:55] could even say who's heard voices and
[1:29:57] other it's not your voice thinking it's
[1:30:00] actually other voices men or women's
[1:30:02] voices saying in your mind speaking to
[1:30:04] you who said that
[1:30:06] that's a devil trying to get a hold of
[1:30:07] you I mean it doesn't mean you're crazy
[1:30:11] remember this is no man's land this is
[1:30:13] the battlefield the devil doesn't you
[1:30:16] know he doesn't just sit back and say
[1:30:18] okay God you can have it no he's
[1:30:20] aggressive maybe just like remember when
[1:30:22] we had our first camp there's that
[1:30:23] meeting God just came down and the devil
[1:30:25] told sister Chantal you're not part of
[1:30:26] this how brazen the devil is God's
[1:30:29] moving people are rejoicing he just
[1:30:31] comes down plays on someone's fear says
[1:30:33] no this is not for you but we know the
[1:30:35] end result he got kicked out in it's a
[1:30:36] victory hallelujah but the devil plays
[1:30:40] on your own fear well it's a doorway oh
[1:30:45] I'm afraid this might happen all this
[1:30:46] could happen because of insecurity and
[1:30:48] fear no that's not what that's not what
[1:30:51] this is about me I mean why should we
[1:30:54] worry about insecurity feel this my hip
[1:30:56] at all I don't really fit it no I fit in
[1:30:58] if you're believing you for it
[1:31:01] hallelujah amen hallelujah you know so
[1:31:04] we shouldn't worry
[1:31:05] don't leave the devil you got to close
[1:31:07] that door
[1:31:08] I mean because remember the devil
[1:31:10] doesn't just go no he tries to force the
[1:31:15] door what about this and this may happen
[1:31:17] and this is see they're doing that and
[1:31:19] he'll actually point out things people
[1:31:20] are doing they say look they're doing it
[1:31:22] see I told you
[1:31:23] oh yeah place you up you know that's it
[1:31:26] yeah it's just like Hollywood it done
[1:31:28] these shows you a screen you go off
[1:31:31] camera what happens off camera drugs
[1:31:35] broken lives people have that you know
[1:31:38] broken people but that's not on camera
[1:31:41] that's off camera but then we see what's
[1:31:44] on camera or on YouTube you know is you
[1:31:46] know these influences they have their
[1:31:49] this I've got eating disorder people
[1:31:51] take their lives or horrible things
[1:31:52] happen because that happens off YouTube
[1:31:55] when they stop broadcasting that's the
[1:31:57] real them but when they go you know but
[1:31:59] then they put on their YouTube face and
[1:32:00] have the lighting just right and you
[1:32:02] know then they go hi youtubers you know
[1:32:04] today we're gonna look at this and you
[1:32:05] know you know what it's fake its fake
[1:32:09] Instagram 99% of its fake you know it's
[1:32:13] been filtered through something you know
[1:32:15] how long it took them to position that
[1:32:17] perfect photo to take it and they're
[1:32:18] trying to just pretend others as me and
[1:32:20] I just woke up and this is how things up
[1:32:22] know it's been staged but yet we look at
[1:32:26] a stage life and we want to go oh I want
[1:32:28] this life you can't have it because it's
[1:32:31] not real that's why people become so
[1:32:34] depressed and broken and down because
[1:32:35] they cannot obtained a stage life
[1:32:37] because it's not real life I mean that's
[1:32:40] why it's a problem of fairness that
[1:32:42] people want to live in a fantasy world
[1:32:43] the devil wants you in a fantasy world
[1:32:45] because you can never be contended happy
[1:32:48] with what you have
[1:32:49] amen you take your notes incredible it's
[1:32:53] incredible where where Israel is
[1:32:55] journeying through the wilderness and
[1:32:58] they say if we only had the fish and the
[1:33:02] garlic and the leeks in Egypt I have to
[1:33:05] eat this Menna this angel food they were
[1:33:09] they were off we could only go back and
[1:33:11] eat the fish from the Nile if we can
[1:33:13] only season things with garlic and have
[1:33:15] leaks and oh you remember those mama you
[1:33:18] remember that wonderful fish used to
[1:33:20] bacon how good it wasn't on the garlic
[1:33:21] and
[1:33:22] you know they forgot that their babies
[1:33:25] were being fed to crocodiles they forgot
[1:33:27] that they were slaves they forgot they
[1:33:30] had no rights I mean they forgot they
[1:33:32] were just been used and abused I mean by
[1:33:34] the Egyptians they forgot those things
[1:33:36] why cuz the devil never tells you what
[1:33:39] he you are delivered from he always
[1:33:41] perverts your memory to try and take you
[1:33:43] back to something I mean that's not even
[1:33:45] real because do you think that they
[1:33:46] would go back what if they said all year
[1:33:48] let's go get some fish let's go get some
[1:33:50] garlic and leeks they go to you know
[1:33:52] Border Patrol in Egypt welcome to Egypt

[1:33:56] purpose of visit holiday gives them the
[1:34:00] passport Jewish slaves they would have
[1:34:03] been thrown into the slavery put
[1:34:04] whatever but in their mind that all we

[1:34:17] torment him not him us
[1:34:19] I mean he's meant to be under our feet
[1:34:20] not him under your outsider his feet
[1:34:23] amen
[1:34:24] so that people you know the devil never
[1:34:26] tells you the bad the scars they were
[1:34:30] carrying the scars of the whips and the
[1:34:32] beatings and the trauma but then the
[1:34:35] devil twisted their memory in such a way
[1:34:36] I want fish again let's go back and get
[1:34:40] fish friends we shouldn't be that way we
[1:34:45] should remember where we came from
[1:34:47] because God set us free from that if
[1:34:50] it's being a proud proud and religion
[1:34:52] from the world whatever it is we should
[1:34:53] always remember what it did because it's
[1:34:56] not glamorous
[1:34:58] amen you should always wear there's no
[1:35:00] glamour in the world if it's so
[1:35:02] glamorous why do people kill themselves
[1:35:04] why they on drugs why they take
[1:35:05] overdoses and all those things you know
[1:35:07] show me them do those things why why
[1:35:10] because it's empty
[1:35:11] it is torment it's broken amen

[1:37:55] still good how's the clothes on your
[1:37:57] back they're still strong how you feelin
[1:37:59] feeling real good hallelujah hallelujah
[1:38:02] what a different atmosphere because he
[1:38:05] was another spirit was with him
[1:38:08] hallelujah hallelujah but now I want you
[1:38:16] to notice now he didn't just settle for
[1:38:17] any place in the promised land oh and
[1:38:21] I'm gonna wanna listen he didn't he
[1:38:23] didn't just sit off or any place he when
[1:38:26] he was there when he was there at Mount
[1:38:30] Horeb and Moses would take the word and
[1:38:33] he would sprinkle the word I'm in the
[1:38:35] book and the people with the blood of
[1:38:36] cows and goats and water and Scarlett
[1:38:39] wood and hyssop they see is this is the
[1:38:41] blood of the test in which the with
[1:38:43] yo-yo which God hath enjoined unto you
[1:38:45] what does God was doing his taking the
[1:38:47] blood and spring sprinkling the promised
[1:38:49] Word and connecting it to the people
[1:38:51] that they would inherit what's in the
[1:38:53] book hallelujah so here he was you know
[1:38:56] many of them didn't receive it because
[1:38:58] it wasn't mixed with faith I mean you
[1:39:00] got to mix the word you hear with faith
[1:39:01] you got to believe it say this is for me
[1:39:04] I don't know how it's gonna happen but I
[1:39:05] believe it's gonna happen I mean this is
[1:39:07] my portion that now when he when he was
[1:39:09] there in the promised land he was not
[1:39:12] looking just for any place in the land I
[1:39:14] mean he wasn't he wasn't satisfied he
[1:39:16] didn't want to be on the wrong side of
[1:39:18] Jordan with with with monaster and
[1:39:19] whatever who were there he didn't want
[1:39:21] to be there he didn't want to be in any
[1:39:23] certain place he wanted a mountain he
[1:39:26] wanted a certain mountain I mean that's
[1:39:28] what he wanted when he saw that mountain
[1:39:30] you know cuz no doubt you know they
[1:39:31] would have had history of you know of
[1:39:33] the late Abraham was there Isaac was
[1:39:35] there so maybe Caleb and Joshua were
[1:39:38] spying out the land they see they see
[1:39:39] this place maybe maybe Caleb would say
[1:39:42] to Joshua Joshua what's that mountain
[1:39:44] something enemies moving hallelujah
[1:39:47] and Caleb would say you know that they
[1:39:50] that that mountain I hear was the place
[1:39:52] where where where Abraham would buy a
[1:39:55] parcel of ground hallelujah and he
[1:39:58] bought it from the from the people of
[1:39:59] the land he buried as his bride in that
[1:40:02] place hallelujah
[1:40:04] he wasn't they want to give it to him
[1:40:05] but he said no I'm gonna buy this place
[1:40:07] I'm gonna buy a better place for my
[1:40:09] bride hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:40:14] something stirred in I'm saying I want
[1:40:17] to live there I want to live on that
[1:40:19] place you know that was spiritual people
[1:40:21] they weren't just looking for anywhere
[1:40:24] they weren't just looking for a nice
[1:40:26] family they weren't just looking for a
[1:40:27] maybe a better way to live or maybe a
[1:40:30] nice group of people to to to assemble
[1:40:32] with they're looking for a resurrection
[1:40:34] I miss the same thing yours the same
[1:40:37] thing with us you know we don't just we
[1:40:40] don't we're not just believers because
[1:40:42] we can or because it sounds cool or it's
[1:40:44] a bit different no it's not because he
[1:40:47] knew it was like Joseph when he's about
[1:40:49] to die see it's don't leave take my
[1:40:51] bones with me take my bones with you
[1:40:53] don't bury me here sure I'll be in a
[1:40:55] casket but when you leave and you will
[1:40:57] bury me in that place
[1:40:59] hallelujah I mean and and and Abraham
[1:41:02] was buried there and Isaac was buried
[1:41:03] there he still was buried there too but
[1:41:05] I don't think I don't think it did him
[1:41:07] any good right but you know there were
[1:41:10] people living under the promise were
[1:41:12] buried in that resurrection place
[1:41:13] because they knew out of the Promised
[1:41:15] Land Christ was going to come the
[1:41:17] resurrection was going to come out of
[1:41:19] that land hallelujah Elysa Caleb said I
[1:41:23] want that place and when he went in and
[1:41:27] he said to finally after all of his
[1:41:30] years of fighting he said to Joshua I'm
[1:41:33] 84 years old or 85 years old I'm as
[1:41:36] strong now as I was when I first came
[1:41:38] out and you know I fully followed yeah I
[1:41:40] fully served the Lord I've wholly
[1:41:42] followed the Lord my God give me my
[1:41:45] Mountain
[1:41:45] give it to me and Joshua said go take
[1:41:50] that place take that place and he took
[1:41:52] it and it became Hebron and Hebron is
[1:41:55] with a Cave of Machpelah is where where
[1:41:57] Abraham Isaac Jacob and Sarah are buried
[1:41:59] I mean so he took his resurrection
[1:42:01] mountain hallelujah and he was
[1:42:04] buried in that place as well hallelujah
[1:42:06] why because he knew out of that land the
[1:42:09] resurrection wasn't coming out of the
[1:42:10] world out of Egypt it was coming out of
[1:42:12] that Promised Land at that mountain
[1:42:14] hallelujah so he didn't see it all just
[1:42:18] for anything he took he took what below
[1:42:22] what he believed was belonging to him
[1:42:24] and it should be the same thing oh I'll
[1:42:26] come back to principalities powers and
[1:42:29] whatever and later another date but he
[1:42:31] didn't see it all just for second best
[1:42:33] or third best he settled for the best
[1:42:36] amen and it should be the same thing
[1:42:38] with us you know the Welsh revival
[1:42:41] started with a young girl standing up at
[1:42:43] a prayer meeting saying be glorified in
[1:42:46] me or something God came down a young
[1:42:48] person started a revival God used it
[1:42:51] the Welsh revival was a young person
[1:42:54] think about it
[1:42:56] amen it's not old it's not the mums and
[1:42:59] dads it's the young people the devil you
[1:43:02] know I heard a um I think it's I think
[1:43:06] it was in Taranaki or somewhere but back
[1:43:07] in the day they had people you know with
[1:43:09] the department of Converse conservation
[1:43:12] don't have hunters go hunt pests and
[1:43:14] they used to tag up wild pigs because
[1:43:18] the wild pigs would kill the Lambs as
[1:43:19] soon as they're born they would actually
[1:43:22] eat them as soon as they were born and
[1:43:24] when I thought about that I thought you
[1:43:26] devil you target the young you target
[1:43:30] the weak you target the ones who don't
[1:43:32] know you target them I think you you
[1:43:35] filthy devil how dare you try and kill
[1:43:38] our young that's the young that have the
[1:43:40] strength that's the young that have the
[1:43:42] ability hallelujah that's the young I
[1:43:45] mean that God wants to take you you take
[1:43:47] that younger generation that went over
[1:43:48] Jordan took the promised land mainly
[1:43:50] young people
[1:43:51] it wasn't the older was the young people
[1:43:53] sure they were the old thereof you're
[1:43:55] like Caleb and Joshua but it was the
[1:43:56] young Amen but then the problem as the
[1:43:59] devil comes along with though what you
[1:44:00] could do in life you could be this you
[1:44:02] could be this you can be a great person
[1:44:04] you could be like them you know I was
[1:44:06] thinking about you take any great big
[1:44:07] sports team people become under the
[1:44:10] anointing that's on that team they buy
[1:44:12] the shirts they you know they become big
[1:44:14] fan boys do the players care about them
[1:44:18] they don't care he comes the great big
[1:44:21] gods out on the soccer field and you
[1:44:24] know they're screaming their lungs out
[1:44:25] the players don't care about them do the
[1:44:28] managers care about them all they care
[1:44:30] about is getting the money all they care
[1:44:33] about is what what can I get out of my
[1:44:35] you know even the people that you know
[1:44:37] it's like any big business they don't
[1:44:40] really care about you the worker you you
[1:44:43] you you either fulfill your role that
[1:44:45] they want you to fulfill if you are
[1:44:48] surplus to requirements you're kicked
[1:44:50] out so if you don't fulfill what you
[1:44:52] want them to do you're gone
[1:44:53] that's that simple and you take that in
[1:44:57] any realm of life sporting business
[1:44:59] whatever it may be they don't really
[1:45:01] care about us amen and that's how the
[1:45:05] devil works he doesn't care about you he
[1:45:08] just wants to use you and then off you
[1:45:10] go
[1:45:11] but how God doesn't like that how God
[1:45:15] doesn't just use us and then then then
[1:45:17] throw us in the trash when we no longer
[1:45:18] we're past our expiry date that's not
[1:45:21] how it works he cares about us I mean he
[1:45:24] became one of us hallelujah
[1:45:27] we're not just there like a bunch of
[1:45:29] fans sitting in the crowd young yeah you
[1:45:31] know no no God doesn't use us that way
[1:45:35] but we have to we have to come to a
[1:45:38] place and realize you know this world
[1:45:40] just wants to use us and abuse us
[1:45:44] whether you like it or not you mean
[1:45:47] there's so much good in this world there
[1:45:48] is but you got to be careful don't let
[1:45:51] it use and abuse you it'll give you all
[1:45:53] the promises but what's your price
[1:45:55] what's your price some people sell out
[1:45:58] for very little very small some sell out
[1:46:02] for very big but you know I would not I
[1:46:07] would not be sold but only for one thing
[1:46:10] the blood of Jesus Christ that was the
[1:46:14] only thing that I allowed to buy me when
[1:46:15] I came to my right mind a lot of other
[1:46:18] things tried to buy me but I came to a
[1:46:20] point where is only the blood can buy me
[1:46:22] and the devil can't match that bid
[1:46:26] hallelujah he can't match that bird I
[1:46:28] mean but if you put a value upon
[1:46:31] yourself that's very low he can match
[1:46:32] anything but it comes to a point who
[1:46:34] seen an auction great big famous things
[1:46:36] being sold and he's a bidding war goes
[1:46:38] on eventually one has to pull out
[1:46:40] because he can't afford it no more same
[1:46:42] thing with the devil he came to a point
[1:46:44] I can't I can't even come near this bird
[1:46:46] he tried to bluff it no doubt you know
[1:46:48] some people you know they but just to
[1:46:50] raise up the price to get the other
[1:46:51] person to pay more true but you know but
[1:46:55] the devil had to come to a point say I
[1:46:56] can't I can't buy this bride hallelujah
[1:47:00] I can't buy it why because there's
[1:47:02] nothing that can match the value of the
[1:47:03] blood of Jesus Christ so let's just
[1:47:06] let's just finish there we'll come back
[1:47:08] to another time but friends don't don't
[1:47:11] don't sell out for something that's
[1:47:14] really know of no value Amy let's have
