[36:43] read the scripture them all numbers 13
[36:50] in verses 25 down to verse 33 this is
[36:57] this this is the 12 spies coming back
[37:00] they have spent 40 days searching out
[37:02] the land and here they are there come to
[37:07] give their report it says and they
[37:10] returned from searching of the land
[37:12] after 40 days and they went and came to
[37:14] Moses and to Aaron and to all the
[37:17] congregation of the children of Israel
[37:19] unto the wilderness of Paran to Kadish
[37:21] and brought back word unto them and unto
[37:24] all the congregation and showed them the
[37:27] fruit of the land and they told him and
[37:30] said we came and the land whither thou
[37:32] sent us send us us and surely it floweth
[37:35] with milk and honey and there is and
[37:37] this is the fruit of it that's go next
[37:40] slide up again nevertheless the people
[37:42] be strong that dwell in the land and the
[37:43] cities are walled and very great and
[37:45] we're over
[37:46] we saw the children of anak there the
[37:48] Amalekites dwell in the land of the
[37:50] south and the Hittites of the Jebusites
[37:52] and the emirates dwell in the mountains
[37:54] and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and
[37:56] by the coast of Jordan and caleb still
[37:58] the people before Moses said let us go
[38:01] up at once and possess it for we are
[38:03] able to overcome it Nix Nix lye please
[38:06] but the men that went up with him said
[38:09] we are not able to go up against the
[38:10] people for they are stronger than we and
[38:13] they brought up an evil report of the
[38:15] land which they had searched unto the
[38:17] children of Israel saying the land
[38:19] though through which we have gone to
[38:23] search it it is a land that eateth up
[38:24] the inhabitants thereof and all the
[38:26] people that we saw in it are men of
[38:29] great stature and there we saw the
[38:31] Giants the sons of anak which came of
[38:34] the Giants and we were in our own sight
[38:36] as grasshoppers and so we were in their
[38:40] sight Amen Lord bless us would you may
[38:44] have your seats this morning I want to I
[38:47] want to speak about scarecrows
[38:49] this is my topic today his scarecrows
[38:51] now we from this reading we see that the
[38:55] you know there were people in the land
[38:58] God told Abraham they would be in the
[39:01] land so it wasn't a surprise when yeah
[39:05] and so you know they weren't surprised
[39:09] that they that that the people were
[39:11] there God told them they would be there
[39:13] now the devil I'm just going to say this
[39:15] the devil will do everything he can to
[39:17] stop you possessing your inheritance in
[39:20] Christ he will stop you at every chance
[39:24] and our position as Christ is our
[39:26] position in the Word of God as the Bride
[39:28] of Christ as joint heirs with Christ as
[39:30] manifesting the full Word of God for
[39:32] this hour that is our inheritance the
[39:34] bride does not manifest just part of the
[39:35] word like in past ages but now the full
[39:38] Word of God is open and the very life
[39:40] that's in that word all the word is is
[39:43] manifested in a multi-member brave I
[39:45] mean so we're not called just to
[39:47] manifest part of Jesus or a little bit
[39:48] of him but the whole everything he is we
[39:51] become by his word when it comes into us
[39:53] and he anoints that word so everything
[39:55] that is in him belongs to the Bride of
[39:57] Christ and not just a part of things
[39:59] we're not just called just to look at it
[40:01] from afar off and say it's wonderful one
[40:04] day maybe I'll become like him maybe one
[40:06] day I'll possess all things no now is
[40:08] the day now is the hour where the bride
[40:10] is not just looking over Jordan saying
[40:12] one day no we're in the promised land
[40:14] right we're called to go and and possess
[40:16] our land but the devil will stop us from
[40:19] possessing the land now I'll just say
[40:21] this the people that the spy saw they
[40:24] were scarecrows they just in the field
[40:27] to scare off people they weren't the
[40:30] true inhabitants of the land the land
[40:32] and belonged to them they were just
[40:33] squatters they were just they were just
[40:35] living there the children of Israel
[40:37] because of an evil report because they
[40:40] saw these people in the land they
[40:42] brought an evil report they will more
[40:44] worried about the squatters that's who
[40:47] the inhabitants were then The Vindicator
[40:49] promise of God that the land belong to
[40:51] them they were more worried about what
[40:53] they saw with their eyes than what the
[40:55] word said that was theirs right so they
[40:58] shrunk back because of what they saw we
[41:01] should press forward because what we
[41:02] believe
[41:03] right we shouldn't shrink back now I'm
[41:07] going to call these so I'm going to call
[41:09] these people in land did your scarecrows
[41:11] there's a lot of scarecrows around the
[41:13] truth and their scarecrows that will
[41:16] pretend to be like the truth and
[41:18] there'll be scarecrows that will keep
[41:20] you away from even walking with the
[41:21] truth so we've got to forget the
[41:24] scarecrows right who cares about what
[41:27] other people say about it what has God
[41:28] given you to possess right so now a
[41:31] scarecrow is defined I actually went on
[41:34] the internet to to see what the
[41:35] definition of scarecrow was and it's an
[41:37] object made to resemble a human figure
[41:39] it's the setup to scare birds away from
[41:42] the field where the crops are growing
[41:43] it's also an object of baseless fear
[41:48] it's another definition so it's an
[41:49] object that is of baseless fear has no
[41:52] real you know the fears just baseless is
[41:54] no actual substance behind it it's just
[41:57] a mimic it's just a bluff or the devil's
[41:59] one big shadow he's just one big share
[42:01] at all is he's nothing but a bluff hello
[42:03] Jesus stripped him of all power Calvary
[42:05] and he's just a bluff and you were going
[42:07] to call his bluff
[42:08] you know when he comes you tries to horn
[42:10] you into his boot you just say boohoo
[42:13] where's the punchline I don't get it
[42:15] your hallelujah
[42:18] don't worry about the Scarecrow
[42:20] everything in the message belongs to me
[42:23] when God said there will be a bride that
[42:25] sinless virtuous maintenance image Brill
[42:28] tup to the full stature of Christ
[42:30] she is him I say that's my inheritance
[42:32] that's my portion that His Word will
[42:34] make me into his image I say yay Lord as
[42:37] for me in my house that's how Porsche so
[42:39] I'm going to go in and get what belongs
[42:40] to me
[42:41] hallelujah we don't want to just shrink
[42:43] back this message is more than just
[42:45] healing Amen or miracles
[42:48] it's a powerful with transforming word
[42:50] to make a people into the very image of
[42:52] Jesus Christ I mean that's what this
[42:54] message was sent for was to call you
[42:57] that you'd become one with the word I
[42:59] mean that every pilot would and you
[43:01] would say yeah they meant that you don't
[43:03] question it you know you're not worried
[43:04] by it doesn't matter what it may appear
[43:06] to be you say yes Lord I will be
[43:08] identified with the revealed son of man
[43:11] in the cellar I mean which is the word
[43:13] revealed
[43:14] hallelujahs is an object of baseless
[43:16] fear
[43:17] the people of those in those land was an
[43:20] object of baseless fear because God said
[43:23] he's the land God said I'll give you the
[43:25] land you go fight for it but it's yours
[43:27] hallelujah and the thing is so they were
[43:32] moring worried about the Scarecrow's
[43:34] thing God's promise for them and because
[43:37] the promise was not mixed with faith as
[43:39] the Apostle Paul says in Hebrews three
[43:40] and four they did not enter in because
[43:42] of unbelief they were called out people
[43:45] they became the church when they are in
[43:47] the wilderness because your church was
[43:48] called out right they were the Church of
[43:50] God but they weren't in their
[43:51] inheritance right that and the reason is
[43:54] they failed to see the value of the
[43:57] promised land they failed to see the
[43:59] true value and we've got to relook at
[44:01] what is the true value of becoming one
[44:04] with the word the true value of God
[44:06] manifesting in our lives the true value
[44:08] of eternal life it's very easy to say I
[44:11] have eternal life but do you see the
[44:12] true value of it I mean when the when
[44:15] God has loosed the seals of the book of
[44:17] redemption opened it for us giving it to
[44:20] our hand do we see the true value of the
[44:23] open word hallelujah
[44:25] you know denomination always comes in in
[44:28] the past that people form a group and
[44:30] they stay there we're not called just to
[44:32] camp down and stay we're called to
[44:34] possess all things so they fail to see
[44:38] the value of the promised land now the
[44:40] true value of the promised land wasn't
[44:43] that it was just flowing with milk and
[44:44] honey it wasn't just because it was a
[44:47] very nice place where they had vineyards
[44:49] and different things there wasn't the
[44:50] true value of the of the promised land
[44:53] the true value of the promised land was
[44:55] the resurrection there was a true value
[44:58] Abraham Sarah Isaac all they you know
[45:02] all the paid those ones they were buried
[45:05] in that land Abraham bought a parcel of
[45:08] ground from the sons of Heth to bury his
[45:11] bride in that place and he was buried in
[45:14] that place and Isaac was buried in that
[45:16] place and Jacob told Joseph when we're
[45:19] now down in Egypt don't bury me in Egypt
[45:22] swear that you'll take my body and bury
[45:25] me in the promised land now naturally
[45:27] you think well a would be a far
[45:28] greater place to be buried you
[45:30] have a big monument you can have all you
[45:32] know people will remember you and look
[45:34] at this pyramid him whatever more and
[45:36] you know but there is no value in there
[45:38] there is no value in Egypt there was
[45:41] only value of being buried in the
[45:44] promised land and Joseph told told told
[45:47] the children of Israel that when God
[45:49] visits you to take you from this land
[45:51] and take you back to the promised land
[45:53] you take my bones with you do not leave
[45:55] me in this place
[45:57] hallelujah and so why was that
[46:00] why wasn't a - good enough place to
[46:02] be buried they had their religion they
[46:04] had their temples they had their faith
[46:06] you know but the promised land was the
[46:09] only place where resurrection was going
[46:11] to come forth right and that's why they
[46:13] saw the true value of being buried in
[46:15] their land because they knew the
[46:17] resurrection was coming out of that land
[46:19] hallelujah it says in Matthew 27 when
[46:22] Jesus arose many of their Saint arose
[46:24] with them
[46:24] hallelujah so that's why they saw they
[46:28] saw the true value of the promised land
[46:30] and they and they said bury me in that
[46:33] place and it's the same thing with you
[46:35] and I don't bury me in a church don't
[46:37] bury me in a religion I wanna be buried
[46:39] in Christ if my life is dead and my oh
[46:42] I'm dead of my life is hid in Christ
[46:43] with God all come forth but if I'm just
[46:46] here with man's ideas and what I think
[46:47] in my opinion you'll die and you'll stay
[46:50] dead that's Egypt don't stay in Egypt
[46:52] don't stay in the wilderness well I felt
[46:55] a pull off out to be called out Here I
[46:56] am
[46:57] don't stay in the wilderness they had
[46:59] miracles in the wilderness God fed them
[47:01] God fought their battles they had
[47:02] tremendous things happen but there was
[47:04] still outside the land we don't want to
[47:06] just stay outside the land we want to be
[47:08] in and so the true believers like Caleb
[47:11] he saw the true valley of the promised
[47:13] land he was not willing to die in the
[47:15] wilderness he didn't want to stay in
[47:17] Egypt he was not willing just to come
[47:19] out halfway he wanted to go all in the
[47:21] way he wanted to go in all the way
[47:23] rather hallelujah because he knew the
[47:25] spiritual ones saw the true value of the
[47:28] land and that's why they took it they
[47:30] would not settle for anything less and
[47:32] it must be the same thing with you and I
[47:35] Amen sure the desert may have some kind
[47:38] of nice things to it I don't want to
[47:40] live in a desert I don't want to live on
[47:42] the other side of Jordan I want to be
[47:44] in in the lane and I don't just want to
[47:46] cross the river I want to take the whole
[47:49] thing
[47:49] take the whole word you're the devil
[47:51] will try and keep you from every promise
[47:53] he will fight you yeah yeah
[47:55] you've got to visit contest between God
[47:58] and Satan well how do you fall into that
[48:01] then which one do you believe as what is
[48:04] the one that'll win in your life right
[48:08] so there is our promised land today is
[48:10] entering into rest which is truly
[48:13] receiving the Holy Ghost really meeting
[48:15] the Lord for yourself Paul speaks about
[48:18] Hebrews three and four they didn't enter
[48:20] into rest he says there is a rest for
[48:21] the children of God right it's not
[48:23] keeping a day it's the Lord dwelling in
[48:25] you that's the true Sabbath the true
[48:28] rest now don't be alarmed by scarecrows
[48:33] a scarecrow is a mimic of the farmer in
[48:37] the field so it looks and the bit of the
[48:40] Scarecrow the more it will scare right
[48:43] if you just put a like I know you just
[48:46] you just put the guitar you just you
[48:48] just get a guitar and you put it in the
[48:50] field you say that's my scarecrow it's
[48:51] not going to scare any birds this is you
[48:53] and sit there right and you know you
[48:55] just you just draw someone in a but a
[48:57] cow ball put it there doesn't move it's
[48:58] not going to scare many birds but if you
[49:00] put some on those ass-kicker that's so
[49:02] lifelike that has some movement that
[49:05] appears to be like the real you're going
[49:07] to scare a lot of birds because they're
[49:09] getting skinned and you have people
[49:11] scarecrows living saying they're in the
[49:14] land quoting the open word living so
[49:17] much like the truth quoting the
[49:19] scripture and the and the quotes you
[49:21] know and and they look very much like
[49:23] they're genuine but they don't have the
[49:24] life but they're scarecrows and that's
[49:27] what the devil always puts in front of
[49:28] people they yeah he puts the puts the
[49:31] copy and he tries to get you look at the
[49:34] Scarecrow this is what it produces and
[49:36] ass-kiss some people - you shouldn't be
[49:38] scared of them don't worry about what
[49:40] you know what is it to thee follow thou
[49:43] me
[49:43] that's what Jesus he does disciples what
[49:46] is it to you about this and this and
[49:47] this who cares about this and that
[49:48] follow thou me what is it to thee right
[49:52] so we shouldn't be alarmed that there
[49:53] cuz God told Moses God told Abraham
[49:56] they'd be there and they found them
[49:57] right and so we shouldn't be surprised
[50:00] scarecrows are in the land because
[50:01] scarecrows will be in the land but don't
[50:04] worry about the scarecrows there's the
[50:05] food
[50:06] there's the resurrection there's eternal
[50:08] life is an open word to become one worth
[50:10] so scarecrows are designed to keep crows
[50:13] and other birds animals from where the
[50:15] fooders the more valuable the crop the
[50:20] bit of the Scarecrow right the more
[50:23] valuable so the more like the genuine a
[50:26] scarecrow is is the most effective to
[50:28] keep people away we shouldn't be worried
[50:32] about scarecrows there yo a scarecrow
[50:38] and the message can cause a lot of the
[50:40] message but there's no life right it can
[50:43] look like the genuine but don't worry
[50:45] about them they said they'd be there now
[50:48] do we have we have batteries how we
[50:50] doing we go the next next slide that's
[50:52] fine now I was reading this a while ago
[50:55] and it really struck me certain no we
[51:02] can't just take we can't take the world
[51:05] or our religion or our culture or
[51:09] preconceived ideas into the Promised
[51:12] Land we can't a lot of people tried to
[51:15] bring Pentecost into the open word you
[51:17] can't you you can't do it you can't
[51:19] bring the Pentecostal move into where
[51:22] the son of man is revealing himself I
[51:24] mean if you have the son of man you have
[51:26] Pentecost right we are Pentecostal
[51:28] people by experience not by organization
[51:31] but by experience that the same God that
[51:33] came down the day of Pentecost comes
[51:35] down now right because if you have the
[51:37] true Living Word I mean you have a
[51:39] Pentecost and then and we've been turned
[51:41] back to original Pentecost right God
[51:44] dwelling in his people once again now
[51:46] but look at this this is not that long
[51:47] after the day of Pentecost and certain
[51:49] men which came down from Judea taught
[51:52] the Brethren and said except ye be
[51:53] circumcised after the manner of Moses
[51:56] you cannot be safe but when Paul and
[51:58] Barnabas wait so have we jumped ahead
[52:01] what 1 2 6 no you were good but when
[52:04] when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no
[52:07] small dissension and and disputation
[52:11] were they made
[52:11] terming that Paul and Barnabas and
[52:13] certain others of them they should go up
[52:15] to Jerusalem unto the Apostles and
[52:17] elders about this question and being
[52:19] bought on their way by the church they
[52:21] passed through a fence and Samaria
[52:23] declaring the conversion of the Gentiles
[52:25] and they caused great joy unto all the
[52:28] brethren oak we go next one and when
[52:31] they will come to Jerusalem they were
[52:33] received of the church and of the
[52:35] Apostles and elders and they declared
[52:37] all things that God had done with them
[52:39] but there arose up certain of the sect
[52:42] of the Pharisees which believed saying
[52:44] that it was needful to circumcise them
[52:47] and to command them to keep the law of
[52:49] Moses and the Apostles and elders came
[52:52] together for to consider this matter to
[52:56] me this is one of a you know this is
[52:58] this is almost ridiculous
[53:01] the Pharisees killed Jesus
[53:03] and now these are sick is an offshoot of
[53:06] the Pharisee movement that's come to
[53:08] believe he's the Messiah but you see the
[53:10] problem as they were still Pharisees
[53:11] they were still they were still living
[53:14] something that was from a past age and
[53:16] they're trying to bring it into the
[53:17] present truth you can't bring something
[53:20] of the past into the present truth
[53:21] because you'll be like this you'll be a
[53:23] Pharisee
[53:24] you'll be an actor who's trying to bring
[53:26] the past into the present you cannot do
[53:28] that right every you know and so there
[53:32] are sick to the Pharisees which believed
[53:34] but you can see they didn't really
[53:35] believe because they are trying to get
[53:37] the people to become you know to be
[53:39] circumcised for the law before they
[53:41] became believers and so they're trying
[53:43] to bring the past into the present
[53:45] now this they had brought this they had
[53:50] brought their old walk of their old
[53:52] faith into a new and living way and mix
[53:57] the two together it didn't produce the
[53:59] life of Pentecost it didn't produce the
[54:01] life of the word and the people right so
[54:04] they were they were stuck this way and
[54:05] it's amazing that the that the that the
[54:08] believers actually spent time with these
[54:11] ones they're trying to bring the past
[54:13] and whether you say hold on no we're
[54:15] with the new and living way we don't
[54:17] have to keep the law of Moses anymore
[54:19] the when God comes and dwells in your
[54:21] soul though the law is fulfilled he he
[54:24] fulfills his own law
[54:25] right we don't have to keep a physical
[54:27] ordinance he lives it ain't meant just
[54:29] like sanctification God sanctifies the
[54:31] believer right you have to give you a
[54:33] will over to him completely and then he
[54:35] sanctifies you then he transforms you
[54:37] then he changes you it means it's the
[54:40] same thing today people try and bring
[54:41] their religious ideas so what I'm
[54:43] basically doing is I'm showing both
[54:45] types of scarecrow okay because there's
[54:49] those that we have we have life okay I'm
[54:54] showing both kinds because there's the
[54:56] ones pretending to be in the land and
[54:59] they're not in the land they're just
[55:00] squatters they're not part of the land
[55:01] and there's the others who try and pull
[55:03] us back into the past there's two times
[55:05] right so I'm just as I'm showing both
[55:08] okay and so now these people are still
[55:11] alive today
[55:12] it's always the devil's job to try and
[55:15] bring people back into what has been
[55:17] right and if he can't pull you back into
[55:19] what has been he'll push you too far
[55:21] into the future right and people try and
[55:25] run ahead of the pillar of fire instead
[55:27] of waiting for God to unfold his word
[55:29] and walk with them they try and go ahead
[55:31] because man man gets pride and they want
[55:33] to have something special and something
[55:35] different so they take quotes and courts
[55:37] and courts and quotes and then they find
[55:38] the conclusion they end with is very
[55:40] different to what the Prophet said but
[55:42] they trying to be Kingdom builders
[55:43] trying to establish themselves upon the
[55:45] earth or something special what's
[55:46] happened they're actually just
[55:47] scarecrows because you'll find that kind
[55:50] of way it doesn't produce the life of
[55:52] the message right okay so now brother
[55:56] Bram says this and deceive Church by the
[55:58] world it's a good message to go listen
[56:00] to he says all knowledge oh well we know
[56:04] all about it and some of them doesn't
[56:06] know the first alphabet of the Holy
[56:07] Spirit they deny it it reminds me of a
[56:09] little book I read one day in California
[56:11] about ten years ago I picked up from an
[56:13] old bookstore he says it sounded like it
[56:17] was just a 10-cent book had some but it
[56:20] had some good seats to it it seemed
[56:22] jokey and cunningly but I found
[56:23] something in there that sounded like God
[56:25] to me and some of them little story
[56:27] started out with us one morning a great
[56:29] and a great chicken pen there's certain
[56:31] little rooster that thought he had all
[56:33] the knowledge and there was to be known
[56:35] so he flies up onto a box beat his bill
[56:39] but against the box four or five times
[56:40] throws back his little head crowed like
[56:43] he'd never heard a rooster crow and the
[56:45] others he attracted their attention said
[56:46] ladies and gentlemen of his chicken pen
[56:48] I'd like to speak to you this morning on
[56:50] some great educational program we have
[56:52] just been designed I said I have I have
[56:56] required a lot of knowledge of my
[56:57] studying as he pulled on his little
[56:59] glasses over as Billy said I have
[57:00] decided that we chickens can better
[57:02] ourselves by more knowledge therefore I
[57:05] can tell you that we're that we will dig
[57:08] and work in a certain pin or hole we'll
[57:10] find a certain vitamin that can make us
[57:12] crow better
[57:13] prettier feathers and I can tell you how
[57:16] we are even better ourselves in many
[57:18] different ways and the little pellets
[57:20] and then with the little road of little
[57:22] red combs they just cackle this head
[57:24] isn't here darling and they certainly
[57:26] admired him oh he was just such a
[57:28] brilliant rooster reminds me some of
[57:30] these seminary preachers such a
[57:31] brilliant man there's no need of us
[57:33] hanging around with the rest of the
[57:34] chickens we all ought to go with him
[57:36] well before the little fellow had got a
[57:39] speech finished there was another little
[57:41] chicken that didn't have such bright
[57:42] feathers came running in from the rest
[57:44] of the chicken yard he said boys wait a
[57:46] minute I've just heard the latest
[57:47] bulletin on the radio the chickens went
[57:50] out for seats on the pandrol going to
[57:52] the slaughter tomorrow what good is your
[57:53] knowledge going to do brother all the
[57:56] knowledge we can accumulate what good
[57:58] does it do we're six foot of dirt we're
[57:59] all dying by inches and by minutes our
[58:01] knowledge means nothing we want to know
[58:03] him but they do that what they learn
[58:06] about other stuff that doesn't really
[58:07] matter as I was remarking some time ago
[58:10] about a little canary he thought he had
[58:13] all the knowledge that that had been
[58:15] known he knowed so much that he could
[58:17] tell all the rest of the Canaries about
[58:18] human beings so he flies up on his cage
[58:21] begins to speak about the human being
[58:23] I'm how he knowed all about them then
[58:25] all of a sudden a professor from Purdue
[58:28] walked up and began to speak some high
[58:30] polish words to him and the little
[58:32] fellow batted his eyes and turned his
[58:34] head and he had eyes he could see the
[58:36] professor he had ears he could hear him
[58:38] but of course he didn't know what he was
[58:40] talking about why he was just a canary
[58:42] brain he was just a bird brain that's
[58:44] all he's got he wasn't got a human brain
[58:46] so he can't think like human beings and
[58:49] neither can a human being think like God
[58:51] where he
[58:52] and all the worldly knowledge is no more
[58:54] than a canary brain all you do you just
[58:57] hurt yourself with it we have got to
[58:59] have the mind of Christ he says that's
[59:01] the reason people go and join
[59:02] organizations and substitute a handshake
[59:05] instead of the new birth they're trying
[59:07] to bypass the new birth they don't want
[59:09] the new birth and they they know we
[59:12] teach it in the Bible so they want to
[59:14] substitute something for it and the
[59:16] Pentecostal people are just as bad
[59:17] trying to substitute something they
[59:19] wanted in class it must be so classy
[59:21] we'll shake hands or join the church and
[59:23] be or be sprinkled and baptized or
[59:25] something they're afraid of the new
[59:27] birth he says sometimes I believe that
[59:28] Branum tabernacle is getting afraid of
[59:30] it well we all know that a birth I don't
[59:33] care where it is what it is
[59:34] we're about to to miss if a baby's born
[59:37] on a shock pile on a hard floor or pink
[59:40] decorated hospital room it's a mess
[59:42] anyhow a birth of a calf birth of
[59:44] anything else is a mess and the new
[59:46] birth is nothing less than a mess but
[59:48] people are so starchy we'll go over
[59:50] there and they shake hands we'll go over
[59:52] there they don't ball and cry and beat
[59:53] on the old and cry out we want too much
[59:56] we want too much to be human but what we
[59:59] need is a birth of dying out that brings
[1:00:00] forth life a seed an old potato a seed
[1:00:03] potato you take that potato and you put
[1:00:06] it in the ground until you have new
[1:00:07] potatoes that a potato has to rot our
[1:00:10] corn cannot produce new life until it's
[1:00:12] rotten and a man or a woman has never
[1:00:14] had the new birth until the
[1:00:16] intellectuals their old self is rot and
[1:00:18] dead died out at the altar scream get
[1:00:20] all messed up to a place the starch gets
[1:00:22] out of your collar and you are born
[1:00:24] again by the Spirit of God I don't care
[1:00:26] if you squeal speaking tongues jump up
[1:00:28] and down flop like a chicken with its
[1:00:29] head cut off you're bringing forth your
[1:00:31] life but we have substituted something
[1:00:33] for it we want the classical way sure
[1:00:37] amen there's got to be a reality you
[1:00:40] know we are not here just to learn
[1:00:42] things right well talk about the opening
[1:00:44] the word is not intellectual idea or
[1:00:46] something new that we can learn and
[1:00:47] acquire knowledge and talk about which
[1:00:49] excites us for a season as Jesus Christ
[1:00:51] revealing himself it's the son of man
[1:00:54] making himself known
[1:00:55] right but in order to really see him you
[1:00:57] must be born again I mean unless you're
[1:00:59] born again you cannot see the kingdom it
[1:01:01] doesn't make sense you cannot understand
[1:01:03] it right so but the Scarecrow's will
[1:01:06] keep us away
[1:01:06] of a new birth because reasonable comin
[1:01:09] sometimes we can be the worst scarecrow
[1:01:11] by our own human reasoning because
[1:01:13] nothing likes to die hallelujah I mean I
[1:01:17] believe in a real religion a real walk
[1:01:19] with God with God really meet you when
[1:01:21] they're in the upper room they didn't
[1:01:23] say well I guess we've been here long
[1:01:24] enough it's the day of Pentecost that
[1:01:26] sounds good to us
[1:01:27] you know let's just walk out no they
[1:01:29] really met God they were really changed
[1:01:31] they were transform they didn't just
[1:01:33] have like a camp experience and go out
[1:01:34] now they were changed they were
[1:01:36] transformed I'm in the very God that
[1:01:39] they walk was was now in them hallelujah
[1:01:43] now we know that the what have I done we
[1:01:50] driving I got I got a laser anyway
[1:01:59] revelation 6 1 & 2 let's go there let's
[1:02:02] do it the old-fashioned way who's got
[1:02:03] their Bibles we know that the today the
[1:02:09] pale horse rider is riding
[1:02:11] he's a mixture of the first three and so
[1:02:15] when we read about the first horse rider
[1:02:16] we know that the same power of deception
[1:02:19] is still riding it's still here is it
[1:02:22] Peter Scarecrow the devil's a scarecrow
[1:02:24] but he'll try the devil haunts he tries
[1:02:27] to grip you tries to scare you he tries
[1:02:30] to intimidate you don't be intimidated
[1:02:33] don't be scared don't be haunted you're
[1:02:35] a son or daughter of God he's you've
[1:02:38] been redeemed by the blood this message
[1:02:40] you know why this message is quickened
[1:02:42] to your soul because you have an eternal
[1:02:44] body in the heavens I mean though this
[1:02:46] earthly tabernacle be dissolved I have
[1:02:48] one eternal in the heavens waiting for
[1:02:50] me and the very reason that God spoke
[1:02:52] this word and quicken it to you is
[1:02:54] because you have a body I mean that this
[1:02:57] message is here to align you with your
[1:02:58] theophany that's why you be made alive
[1:03:01] that's why it's quicken you to this word
[1:03:03] it's because you have a body in the
[1:03:05] heavens already so if you have that body
[1:03:08] who cares about intimidation who cares
[1:03:10] what the devil can do who cares what the
[1:03:12] enemy can try and put down your throat
[1:03:13] the kids about it I've got a body that I
[1:03:15] will step into hallelujah so he's a pig
[1:03:20] bluff he's nothing but a bluff who cares
[1:03:24] about him I could cease to be but you
[1:03:27] don't be hallelujah all being a far
[1:03:30] greater state than standing here this
[1:03:31] morning hallelujah and the very reason
[1:03:34] God comes and quickens is word to your
[1:03:36] soul is because he's trying to get your
[1:03:38] attention you have a body I mean when
[1:03:40] this life is no more you shall be holy
[1:03:43] the devil has an expiry date and all of
[1:03:46] his works and they'll come to an end and
[1:03:47] they won't be remembered but yet you
[1:03:49] will still be hallelujah that's what
[1:03:53] this message has come to do align you
[1:03:56] with your theophany you know there's a
[1:03:58] it's like a natural you know we are
[1:04:00] growing into the image of God like a
[1:04:03] baby in the mother's womb cravings come
[1:04:06] you know sometimes they can be crazy but
[1:04:10] there's something in that food that the
[1:04:12] mother eats of them that the baby is
[1:04:14] calling for right it's the same thing
[1:04:16] with you there's something in you you
[1:04:19] may not even understand it but you're
[1:04:21] calling for a certain vitamin of the
[1:04:22] word because you need to grow to the
[1:04:24] full stature and then God will inspire a
[1:04:26] minister you hear a message and it will
[1:04:28] and something wanker in your soul
[1:04:30] because your body's saying I needed that
[1:04:32] I needed that Allu you so what why
[1:04:36] should we fear that's why Paul could
[1:04:38] just walk the way he did nothing moves
[1:04:40] me I've been shipwrecked I've been
[1:04:42] beaten I've been betrayed by by false
[1:04:44] brethren I've been what ever more he
[1:04:46] says none of these things move me but
[1:04:48] we're gonna cut your head off in the
[1:04:49] morning Paul I've got a crown of life
[1:04:53] hallelujah waiting waiting for me though
[1:04:56] this earthly tabernacle be dissolved
[1:04:58] I've won in Waiting eternal in the
[1:04:59] heavens

[1:05:16] would get a hold of you that you would
[1:05:18] understand you're not a creature of time
[1:05:20] right you're just passing through
[1:05:22] brother I'm serious like eternity is
[1:05:24] like a big circle and time is just like
[1:05:26] a hickey on the side right because of
[1:05:29] sin but then one day soon we'll be done
[1:05:31] and we'll go back into eternity again
[1:05:34] and we came from eternity and we go back
[1:05:36] to eternity I mean yeah they pray you've
[1:05:38] got a revelation I came from God and I
[1:05:40] go back to him I was in his thoughts I
[1:05:43] become manifest and then I'm going to go
[1:05:45] back into heaven
[1:05:46] Allu yeah but everything else is
[1:05:49] Scarecrow's what do we say
[1:05:51] what are we gripped by people can be so
[1:05:53] impacted by things in their life what
[1:05:55] about being impacted by Jesus Christ
[1:05:57] he's never done anything bad
[1:05:59] amen you take the word of God that's
[1:06:02] never done anything bad to me
[1:06:03] amen he saved me he redeemed me he
[1:06:07] washes me he keeps me he cleanses me he
[1:06:10] makes me holy comfort me he guides me he
[1:06:12] gives me joy speakable full of glory he
[1:06:15] shows me where I'm going is any of that
[1:06:16] bad so why don't we just get so gripped
[1:06:20] by this word so gripped that everything
[1:06:24] else in our life is just out of that
[1:06:26] because we're being being consumed being
[1:06:29] gripped by a word don't let the devil
[1:06:30] distract you he will distract you to
[1:06:32] keep you away from the promise he will
[1:06:34] distract you with this world to choke
[1:06:36] out the Word of God in your life get us
[1:06:38] caught caught up in things here's some
[1:06:41] social media Alleluia amen what about
[1:06:46] Facebook what about this book what are
[1:06:48] the message I want to I don't want to
[1:06:51] become like social media they position
[1:06:53] their photos make everything fake you
[1:06:56] know it's not reality and people lap it
[1:06:58] up and they try and live in some
[1:07:00] imagination that's not even real that's
[1:07:02] why Hollywood and all the things in the
[1:07:04] world
[1:07:05] it's not even reality but yet the devil
[1:07:08] tries to put it down your throat saying
[1:07:09] this is what you need to become to be
[1:07:12] successful in this world and then you
[1:07:14] just tilt the camera out of the frame
[1:07:16] that he's telling you and you see broken
[1:07:17] lives and suicide and and drug abuse and
[1:07:20] all kinds of things and in rehab out of
[1:07:23] rehab and all this broken-down and stuff
[1:07:25] well why doesn't the devil show you that
[1:07:27] because that's what it produces right
[1:07:31] and he doesn't want and then and then he
[1:07:33] points you at things oh look at what
[1:07:36] happened to these people and these
[1:07:37] people in the message these people it's
[1:07:39] the same anointing that was bare like
[1:07:41] the king of Moab took Balaam around to
[1:07:43] the back parts of Israel and Israel was
[1:07:46] doing all kinds of wickedness
[1:07:47] all kinds of things and and the king of
[1:07:51] mob said surely if Balaam sees the back
[1:07:53] parts he'll curse them and then when the
[1:07:56] Spirit of God comes upon Balaam God's
[1:07:59] speaking now I see no Nik worry and
[1:08:01] jacob hallelujah but you'd say well
[1:08:04] naturally they'll do this and this and
[1:08:05] this failure and this thing in this
[1:08:07] thing that God sees R&C iniquity of my
[1:08:09] people they're walking with the pillar
[1:08:10] of fire to the promised land
[1:08:12] holy but the devil won't point you you
[1:08:15] know do you think bellick was saying now
[1:08:17] Balaam you see the pull or fire there
[1:08:18] you see this moon rock you see you see
[1:08:21] the brass serpent they have you see the
[1:08:23] word of promise they received from Sinai
[1:08:25] you see how do you think he would never
[1:08:28] have pointed those things out the devil
[1:08:30] never points out the true value of
[1:08:32] what's there
[1:08:33] Amen he wants you to see the false they
[1:08:36] are not the true value so I saw when the
[1:08:40] lamb opened one of the seals and I heard
[1:08:42] as it were the noise of thunder one of
[1:08:45] the four beasts saying come and see you
[1:08:46] know I saw behold a white horse and he
[1:08:48] that sat on him had a bow and a crown
[1:08:51] was given unto him and he went forth
[1:08:52] conquering and to conquer
[1:08:53] now we know that this is the Antichrist
[1:08:55] spirit in the first age because when you
[1:08:58] read revelations 19 there's another
[1:08:59] white horse rider and he's a sharp
[1:09:01] two-edged it's all coming out of his
[1:09:02] mouth he's called the Word of God his
[1:09:04] his vicious dipped in blood he's got
[1:09:07] many crowns that's not this guy right
[1:09:10] when in Revelations 19 is Christ riding
[1:09:13] forth to conquer this is a deception
[1:09:15] right because he has a bow and he has no
[1:09:17] arrows you'll never sword right so he's
[1:09:20] just waving around a weapon it's like
[1:09:22] carrying around again with no bullets
[1:09:23] trying to intimidate people this this
[1:09:28] power is still riding today right but he
[1:09:31] tries to come in as as it says in Daniel
[1:09:35] 11 it says and in his estate shall stand
[1:09:40] up a vile person to whom they shall not
[1:09:42] give honor of the kingdom but he shall
[1:09:44] come in peaceably and obtain the kingdom
[1:09:46] by flatteries so he'll come in because
[1:09:49] of personal advantage and try and take
[1:09:50] the kingdom by flatteries and it was in
[1:09:52] the first stage was the deed of the
[1:09:54] Nicolaitans which jesus said he hated
[1:09:56] right so they were believers that were
[1:09:58] there in the framework of Christianity
[1:10:00] but the head D
[1:10:01] and those deeds are just saying send
[1:10:03] euros nothing in concrete nothing on
[1:10:04] paper it's just a deed but we do it this
[1:10:06] way we do it that way this is just how
[1:10:08] you know and the purpose of that deed
[1:10:11] was to conquer the people and how you
[1:10:12] conquer the people's you take away a
[1:10:14] genuine union between God and man where
[1:10:17] God comes and lives in them right that's
[1:10:20] how you conquer them by taking the power
[1:10:22] of God away from their lives now so it's
[1:10:27] the same thing today
[1:10:28] it comes in today it comes in today
[1:10:34] don't worry we go back I was trying to
[1:10:37] blank it actually that's why it comes in
[1:10:39] today and says just get baptized and say
[1:10:43] you believe God then you're saved that's
[1:10:45] what that's what this spirit comes in it
[1:10:48] says and everything else doesn't pertain
[1:10:50] to salvation so it doesn't matter amen
[1:10:54] that's what it's it that's what this one
[1:10:55] D that's what the devil says just come
[1:10:58] and say you believe join the church get
[1:10:59] baptized you have salvation everything
[1:11:02] else doesn't pertain to salvation so
[1:11:04] what's happening is that the devil
[1:11:05] always tries to move the word out of its
[1:11:08] importance explains it away see that
[1:11:11] it's not important that but doesn't
[1:11:13] matter this but well historical and
[1:11:15] accuracy and mistranslation and don't
[1:11:17] trust listen it's trying to take the
[1:11:18] Word of God and dilute it in your mind
[1:11:21] that it's not important anymore but man
[1:11:23] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:11:24] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:11:26] mouth of God Moses said it Jesus said it
[1:11:29] and then Jonathan says if you add or
[1:11:31] take away your name we'll be taking on
[1:11:32] the book of life right and we know in
[1:11:35] order to take the - you know take away
[1:11:37] from the word you don't have to delete
[1:11:39] it out of your Bible you just say it's
[1:11:41] not important that's taking away the
[1:11:46] same things being done today they kill
[1:11:48] the influence this is from the cedar
[1:11:50] discrepancy you want to hear message go
[1:11:52] listen to the cedar discrepancy anything
[1:11:54] that does not manifest the promise word
[1:11:55] of the arrows discrepancy it's a tear
[1:11:58] right it's not true anything can be so
[1:12:01] close like Judas was so close but here's
[1:12:03] discrepancy right here's a cedar
[1:12:06] discrepancy and says now same thing
[1:12:08] they've done today they killed the
[1:12:10] influence they say oh that bunch of holy
[1:12:12] rollers is nothing to them
[1:12:14] and why it's discrepancy meet the Word
[1:12:17] of God face to face and see what it is
[1:12:19] see if God interpreters would his own
[1:12:23] Word God's able of these stones to rise
[1:12:25] up to Abraham Amen the word had been
[1:12:28] thoroughly vindicated by them early
[1:12:30] Christians how God delivered them from
[1:12:33] everything in disease they had prophets
[1:12:34] they spoke in tongues interpreter gave
[1:12:36] messages that's proved to be exactly the
[1:12:38] truth every time but in the face of all
[1:12:40] that vindicated word the people voted it
[1:12:43] out and voted a denomination that's the
[1:12:45] mother of all organization both are
[1:12:48] fully matured now they started seeding
[1:12:51] again it died out but it bloomed again
[1:12:53] in the days of Luther as we know in the
[1:12:55] form of message hearing though it
[1:12:57] bloomed out and that they have Luther
[1:12:59] now what do they do immediately after
[1:13:00] that great man died they made an
[1:13:02] organization that bloomed out again in
[1:13:04] the days of John Wesley when them
[1:13:06] Anglicans with all their eternal
[1:13:08] securities and everything had it bound
[1:13:09] up into a place there's almost
[1:13:11] universalism well I think that means
[1:13:14] gods and everyone basically and what's
[1:13:15] happened God raised up a man named John
[1:13:17] Wesley Slade the whole thing and as soon
[1:13:19] as he died her man s brewery and then
[1:13:21] what happened they organized and they've
[1:13:23] got all kinds of Methodist think come
[1:13:25] along one or the other
[1:13:27] Alexander Campbell John Smith what more
[1:13:28] finally broke out Pentecost coming out
[1:13:32] coming out of all of it what happened
[1:13:34] then they did run well what did hinder
[1:13:36] you they went right back into the same
[1:13:38] mud you came out of right back into the
[1:13:41] same slop went back to discrepancy and
[1:13:43] made organizations they had to
[1:13:45] compromise on the word that's wise the
[1:13:47] first thing that has to happen and every
[1:13:48] time God would send something new they
[1:13:51] couldn't receive a nurse right
[1:13:51] discrepancy again and notice as I said
[1:13:54] the other day their first little husk
[1:13:56] that came forth from this root comes up
[1:13:59] into the leaves and up into the tussle
[1:14:01] back again into the stalk again it comes
[1:14:03] out that little husk of wheat almost
[1:14:05] looks like the grain itself and we
[1:14:08] thought it was but when you open it up
[1:14:09] there's no grain there at all it's only
[1:14:11] a supporter of the grain to grow by and
[1:14:14] it dies also and the life goes right out
[1:14:16] of it and goes into the grain my brother
[1:14:19] Graham said Pentecostal move was a good
[1:14:21] shook but just protected the grain but
[1:14:23] now the grains here hallelujah Amen you
[1:14:28] know
[1:14:28] he says in second corinthians i'm just
[1:14:30] going to go through this it doesn't
[1:14:31] pertain to salvation a little bit
[1:14:33] second Corinthians six seventeen and
[1:14:35] eighteen I don't have it on there since
[1:14:37] wherefore come out from among them and
[1:14:39] be separate saith the Lord touch not the
[1:14:41] unclean thing and I will receive you and
[1:14:44] be a father unto you you shall be my
[1:14:46] sons and daughters saith the Lord
[1:14:49] Almighty so there's the call come out
[1:14:50] from among them be separate touching not
[1:14:53] the unclean thing over there pertain no
[1:14:55] it doesn't pertain to salvation touchy
[1:14:57] not the unclean thing right you can't
[1:14:59] join yourself with idols or things of
[1:15:01] the world some kind of discrepancy you
[1:15:04] you've got to let it go you will if you
[1:15:06] see the true value of eternal life if
[1:15:09] you see the true value of the message
[1:15:11] you will cleave unto him hallelujah 1st
[1:15:15] Thessalonians 4 and we know we love to
[1:15:17] quote the rapture section of the of
[1:15:20] first Thessalonians 400 into 5 but the
[1:15:24] first part of her first Thessalonians 4
[1:15:26] says furthermore we beseech you brethren
[1:15:28] and exhort you by the lord jesus that as
[1:15:31] ye have received of us how you ought to
[1:15:33] walk and to please God they are
[1:15:35] instructed how to please God and how to
[1:15:37] walk
[1:15:38] hallelujah amen oh yes amen you see but
[1:15:42] people say no it doesn't pertain to
[1:15:44] salvation it doesn't matter what's
[1:15:46] happened no that's just that white horse
[1:15:48] rider with a deception coming in and
[1:15:51] people agree with it because it panders
[1:15:54] to the flesh instead of walking after
[1:15:56] the spirit right we don't want to pander
[1:15:59] to the flesh we want to agree with God's
[1:16:00] Word if the spirit on you doesn't agree
[1:16:03] with God's Word you get another spirit
[1:16:05] because that spirit is Antichrist amen
[1:16:08] furthermore and he says and we know for
[1:16:12] ye know what Commandments we gave you by
[1:16:16] the Lord Jesus for this is the will of
[1:16:18] God even your sanctification that you
[1:16:20] should abstain from fornication that
[1:16:22] every one of you should know how to how
[1:16:24] to possess his vessel in sanctification
[1:16:26] and honor not in the lust of
[1:16:29] concupiscence even in it and that's just
[1:16:32] longings to things that are things that
[1:16:35] are forbidden says longing after things
[1:16:37] I wish I could have that I wish I could
[1:16:39] have that well the reason people long
[1:16:41] after things which mentally they know is
[1:16:44] wrong is because their nature has not
[1:16:46] been changed right they're still logging
[1:16:48] after just like the Childress or they
[1:16:50] came out of Egypt oh we won the garlic's
[1:16:53] and the league's of Egypt but they
[1:16:55] forgot their in slavery they were beaten
[1:16:58] their children were being killed right
[1:17:01] they were just tools and Pharaohs hands
[1:17:02] they weren't a free people all but I
[1:17:04] long after those things the devil will
[1:17:06] try and you know I'm going all the way I
[1:17:10] burned every Bridge you won't even find
[1:17:13] the foundation of the bridge I don't
[1:17:15] even know where it was I'm not looking
[1:17:17] I'm not looking for I came from all they
[1:17:19] know we're drowned

[1:17:36] you can't kill me I'm already dead
[1:17:38] hallelujah I'm what you can't kill a
[1:17:40] dead man a man I like that
[1:17:43] now even as the Gentiles which know not
[1:17:47] of God now we have to have a testimony
[1:17:54] that we have to have a life produced
[1:17:57] that proves our testimony is right right
[1:17:59] by their fruits you shall know them
[1:18:02] this is again and deceived Church by the
[1:18:05] world he says today they say come join
[1:18:07] the church put your name on the book or
[1:18:09] bow down and say I confess Christ as the
[1:18:11] Son of God and get up this basis I just
[1:18:13] say a sinner's prayer

[1:18:44] Judas was baptized member here's the son
[1:18:46] of perdition
[1:18:47] the devil went out and preached the
[1:18:48] gospel when Judas went out and preach
[1:18:50] the gospel but the devil didn't get the
[1:18:52] Holy Ghost I mean that's it

[1:23:44] going to repeat it again I just don't
[1:23:46] know about my wife I know her we're
[1:23:48] married we live in the same house we go
[1:23:50] through the same things I know her hard
[1:23:52] I know you know how she is I haven't
[1:23:54] just read books the life and times with
[1:23:57] Christine and then I've seen the movie
[1:23:59] I've heard the musical yeah I know no no
[1:24:02] I am married to her hallelujah we don't
[1:24:07] learn about Jesus it's not learning
[1:24:09] about Jesus as he's not some idea don't
[1:24:11] let the devil put God as some concept
[1:24:13] degrade him to some concept he's a
[1:24:16] Living God he's the Messiah Zachary

[1:24:29] glorious isn't he tremendous how is he
[1:24:32] worth it all can he see the true value
[1:24:34] he didn't look like anything great to
[1:24:36] the world but in him was eternal life he
[1:24:38] was the resurrection the life hallelujah
[1:24:40] and those who are ordained could look
[1:24:41] past the veil and see eternal life holy
[1:24:45] just like the message that that may no
[1:24:46] look so pretty
[1:24:47] but in there's eternal life hallelujah
[1:24:50] if you're a danger see you can't help
[1:24:52] but seeing it I mean you're kneel to
[1:24:53] begin with I mean you must see it
[1:24:56] hallelujah how can the Holy spirt denies
[1:24:59] own word the author cannot done cannot
[1:25:03] deny zone word it's impossible so if the
[1:25:06] Spirit of God isn't if the spirit that
[1:25:07] wrote the Bible is in you you cannot
[1:25:09] deny the scripture you cannot dilute it
[1:25:11] you cannot explain it away you say this
[1:25:13] is God's Word right you cannot it's the
[1:25:17] same thing with the message because the
[1:25:18] the one who wrote the Bible spoke the
[1:25:21] message right and it's the same God now
[1:25:25] the Apostle Paul this is why I was quite
[1:25:27] are we back on
[1:25:33] it's normally it's like pilots it's
[1:25:35] normally pilot error
[1:25:38] early go can you go next one there we go
[1:25:41] I love this the Apostle Paul was not
[1:25:44] interested in people just becoming
[1:25:45] church people he said my little children
[1:25:48] whom I travail in birth again until
[1:25:50] Christ be formed in you I desire to be
[1:25:53] present with you now and to change our
[1:25:55] voice for I standing down to you but it
[1:25:57] was his burden he wasn't satisfied until
[1:26:00] that same pillar of fire that he met on
[1:26:01] the road to Damascus dwelt in his
[1:26:04] convert Holly the same God he met
[1:26:06] throughout this way he travails and
[1:26:08] birth until Christ be formed in them
[1:26:10] hallelujah should be the same thing with
[1:26:12] us I mean you really meet God nothing
[1:26:14] can explain him away no atheists note no
[1:26:19] religion nothing of the world can
[1:26:21] explain them away because you met him it
[1:26:23] goes beyond someone else's testimony
[1:26:25] becomes your testimony he becomes your
[1:26:27] testimony
[1:26:28] Allu you this is from the state of the
[1:26:30] scriptures fulfilled Moses we know was a
[1:26:33] man called of God a prophet while he was
[1:26:36] being called being a prophet he had to
[1:26:39] have a supernatural experience in order
[1:26:40] to be a prophet he had to meet God face
[1:26:43] to face and talk with him and another
[1:26:44] thing what he said had to come to pass
[1:26:47] or no one would have believed him so no
[1:26:49] man has a right to call himself thus
[1:26:51] until he's talked face-to-face with God
[1:26:53] on the backside the desert somewhere
[1:26:55] where he met God himself and all the
[1:26:58] atheists in the world could not explain
[1:26:59] it away from him he was there he knowed
[1:27:02] it happened every Christian should have
[1:27:04] that experience before they say anything
[1:27:06] about being a Christian your own
[1:27:08] experience and then we know God is not a
[1:27:11] cookie cutter but you'll be able to say
[1:27:13] this happened to me and this is the life
[1:27:14] that's made I mean because every of the
[1:27:17] Holy Ghost is in each one of us it will
[1:27:19] produce the same kind of life right it
[1:27:22] will produce a life of the word and one
[1:27:24] produced a church life or denomination
[1:27:25] life it will produce a life of the word
[1:27:27] and you can't help but it will just
[1:27:29] produce itself there's a life pushing
[1:27:31] out hallelujah this is in Christ a
[1:27:38] mystery God revealed but when Christ is
[1:27:40] identified and you identifying himself
[1:27:42] in you are a Christian you are
[1:27:44] christ-like which the word Christian me
[1:27:47] to be christ-like this is your
[1:27:48] identification right and now since
[1:27:50] here's our identification then we should
[1:27:52] be identified with him
[1:27:54] by living for him how loser when he
[1:27:58] comes at his word identifies himself in
[1:28:00] you right then you know because all
[1:28:03] health is against the revelation of man
[1:28:06] being breast into the kingdom of God and
[1:28:08] Jesus Christ revealing himself
[1:28:10] personally to you upon this rock I'll
[1:28:13] build my church jesus said to Peter the
[1:28:15] revelation of who Jesus Christ is in the
[1:28:18] season you live all hell is against that
[1:28:20] that's why the Scarecrow's will come
[1:28:22] just learn this just say this just
[1:28:24] conform to this now you're going to be
[1:28:26] built upon the rock of the revelation of
[1:28:28] the word in your hour hallelujah that is
[1:28:31] the rock that the church is built upon
[1:28:32] and it's only build upon men amen it
[1:28:36] isn't as your life worthy of the gospel
[1:28:38] if it's the word they sees here but
[1:28:43] there's once your thing you will do
[1:28:44] you'll be the fruit of the Spirit and
[1:28:46] the fruit of the Spirit is love joy
[1:28:48] peace faith long-suffering meekness
[1:28:49] gentleness patience your temper will not
[1:28:51] be oh just remember when you got that
[1:28:54] that poisons the Holy Spirit away from
[1:28:56] you see when you get to a place when you
[1:28:58] want to fuss with everybody you come
[1:29:00] along to these something wrong when you
[1:29:02] when you get to a place where a minister
[1:29:04] will read from the Bible that it's wrong
[1:29:07] to do certain certain thing you just
[1:29:09] remember there's no Christianity there
[1:29:10] at all if you bust up that's that's how
[1:29:13] by their fruits you shall know them
[1:29:15] that's what Jesus said see if it's the
[1:29:18] word and God said so that spirit in you
[1:29:20] will cope with the word every time
[1:29:21] because genuine Holy Spirit will cope
[1:29:24] with the word cuz the word has life and
[1:29:26] spirit Jesus hid my words of life and if
[1:29:29] you've got eternal life and here's the
[1:29:30] word how can you deny how can the word
[1:29:33] deny the word see what kind of a person
[1:29:35] could you make God that's one thing to
[1:29:38] know if you're a Christian when you
[1:29:40] fully agree upon every word of God
[1:29:43] Alleluia are we driving again now I read
[1:29:50] this last week but we he says therefore
[1:29:52] seeing we have this ministry if we have
[1:29:54] received mercy we faint not but every
[1:29:56] announced the hidden things of
[1:29:57] dishonesty not walking craftiness nor
[1:29:59] handling the word
[1:30:00] deceitfully but by manifestation of the
[1:30:03] truth commending ourselves to every
[1:30:05] man's conscience in the sight of God but
[1:30:07] if our gospel be hid its hid to them
[1:30:09] that are lost can we have the have the
[1:30:11] next one and whom the god of this world
[1:30:13] has blinded the minds of them that which
[1:30:16] believe not lest the light of the
[1:30:17] glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[1:30:19] image of God should shine unto them for
[1:30:21] we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus
[1:30:23] the Lord and ourselves and ourselves
[1:30:27] your servants for Jesus sake for God who
[1:30:29] commanded the light to shine a darkness
[1:30:30] has shined in our hearts to give light
[1:30:33] of the knowledge of the glory of God in
[1:30:35] the face of of Jesus Christ we go next
[1:30:38] one please but we have this treasure in
[1:30:41] earthen vessels that excellency of the
[1:30:43] power may be of God and not of us we are
[1:30:46] troubled on every side yet not
[1:30:48] distressed we are perplexed and non
[1:30:50] despair persecuted but not forsaken cast
[1:30:52] down but not destroyed he says we have
[1:30:55] this treasure in earthen vessels he
[1:30:57] speaking about himself this treasure of
[1:31:00] eternal life this treasure of the very
[1:31:01] Creator who made all things that became
[1:31:04] our Redeemer now dwells in his church
[1:31:06] hallelujah the Word made flesh this is
[1:31:09] the treasure Paul didn't look like so
[1:31:12] much to the world but he hears that we
[1:31:14] have this treasure in earthen vessels
[1:31:15] that we would and we haven't handled the
[1:31:18] Word of God deceitfully to to to make it
[1:31:20] say one thing and make it say another
[1:31:22] but we have been a manifestation of the
[1:31:24] truth it has been clearly declared to
[1:31:26] you who we are and what we believe in
[1:31:28] the matter of life we have Amen and then
[1:31:30] so he's saying that we have this
[1:31:31] treasure in earthen vessel so this
[1:31:33] treasure of heaven this pearl of great
[1:31:34] price the Word of God is now hidden
[1:31:37] right we have this treasure in this
[1:31:39] earthen vessel amen so don't let the
[1:31:42] enemy ever try and try and diminish the
[1:31:46] treasure you have remember if he can
[1:31:49] push you won't can't push you one way
[1:31:51] try and push you the other way amen
[1:31:57] now
[1:31:59] the Christian experience is not
[1:32:01] something we manufacture right but it is
[1:32:04] a life pushing itself out
[1:32:06] brother Brown you know he he he uses the
[1:32:09] illustration a few times he speaks about
[1:32:11] when he's hunting and he and he goes to
[1:32:13] a stream that's bubbling and he takes a
[1:32:17] drink of this nice cold water he says
[1:32:19] now if I could speak to you mr. stream
[1:32:21] I'd say mr. stream why do you bubble is
[1:32:23] it because the rabbit hops long comes
[1:32:24] and drinks by you sees no that's not why
[1:32:26] I bubble is because mr. deer comes along
[1:32:28] and he has a drinking walks off is that
[1:32:30] why he publishes no he said well why why
[1:32:32] do you bubble like this what is it you
[1:32:34] know why you bubbling forth like this
[1:32:35] enjoy and Thanksgiving and he says he
[1:32:39] stand and if the stream could as he'd
[1:32:41] say there's something in me pushing out
[1:32:42] I can't help but bubbly something's a
[1:32:45] force behind me there's pushing the
[1:32:47] water through I mean it's making me
[1:32:49] bubble and it's the same thing with the
[1:32:51] Christian experience I mean it's not
[1:32:53] something we put on it's not something
[1:32:55] we manufacture but there's a life
[1:32:56] innocence pushing out I mean like the
[1:32:58] well of living water comes out of us
[1:33:00] hallelujah I mean it's because it's it's
[1:33:04] something within the worshiper when he's
[1:33:06] been identified with Christ because he
[1:33:08] knows that he is alive he don't want to
[1:33:11] become a tradition I mean when you
[1:33:13] really meet him you don't want to become
[1:33:15] a tradition and just settle down - this
[1:33:17] is how we do things not you want life to
[1:33:19] come forth you want a bubble you want
[1:33:21] your bubbling stream spreads out it
[1:33:23] doesn't just sit there like a stagnant
[1:33:24] pool it wants to gush out once the gush
[1:33:26] out to others to be a rocket a weary
[1:33:28] land I mean to give water to those who
[1:33:30] are thirsty
[1:33:32] hallelujah now Matthew 7 we go next one
[1:33:39] therefore all things whatsoever ye would
[1:33:42] that men should do to you do even to
[1:33:45] them for this is the law and the
[1:33:47] prophets into unit the straight gate for
[1:33:50] wide is the gate and broad us the way
[1:33:52] I'm talking about the Scarecrow if it
[1:33:54] doesn't pertain to you salvation
[1:33:56] talk about scarecrows right into unit
[1:33:59] the straight gate for wide is the gate
[1:34:01] and broad is the way that leadeth to
[1:34:02] destruction and many there are that will
[1:34:05] go in thereat because Strait is the gate
[1:34:07] and narrow is the way that leadeth unto
[1:34:09] life and few there be that find it
[1:34:12] so when people say it doesn't pertain to
[1:34:14] salvation that's the broad way that's
[1:34:17] not the narrow way that's just a broad
[1:34:19] way no don't worry just just just walk
[1:34:21] on as you feel led by your own heart
[1:34:23] the heart is deceitful man's heart is
[1:34:26] deceitful you can't trust your own
[1:34:27] leading you can only trust your own
[1:34:29] leading when you see it in God's word
[1:34:30] right because he is our God I just be
[1:34:33] true to yourself I don't want to be true
[1:34:35] to myself I want to be true to God's
[1:34:36] Word
[1:34:37] right because I want to be true to
[1:34:39] myself what am I going to become oh I
[1:34:42] just need to relax and I need to do this
[1:34:44] and you know pleasures of life whatever
[1:34:45] more that's not being true to yourself I
[1:34:47] mean I mean that is but you don't want
[1:34:49] to be true to yourself I'm just
[1:34:51] following my heart well who has the
[1:34:53] reigns of your heart who has the range
[1:34:55] does the word of God have the reigns
[1:34:57] just like a horse the horse is like your
[1:35:00] heart and then there's the driver on the
[1:35:01] coach has the reins
[1:35:03] who's driving your coach right whose
[1:35:06] truck is it the Word of God or is it or
[1:35:09] is it Satan because he'll take you down
[1:35:10] the Broadway you know a Broadway looks a
[1:35:13] lot nicer than a narrow way a narrow way
[1:35:16] I look at this word narrow in the Greek
[1:35:19] and it means it means a rut or a worn
[1:35:23] path yeah a rut is a very narrow narrow
[1:35:26] way a writer a worn path and it means
[1:35:28] actually the crowd like pushing pushing
[1:35:30] it there's no room
[1:35:31] there's a narrow way and it also means
[1:35:34] to afflict that means narrow to throng
[1:35:37] to suffer tribulation and trouble so
[1:35:40] Strait is the gate and suffer
[1:35:43] tribulation is the way or trouble will
[1:35:45] be the way or you know to be afflicted
[1:35:48] as the way it's not the easy way it's
[1:35:50] not the easy way or if it feels good do
[1:35:53] it
[1:35:53] now a hundred percent of time that's
[1:35:54] wrong because this body you know you're
[1:35:57] gonna have to drag this thing to a body
[1:35:58] change one day your body will thank you
[1:36:01] thank you you brought me here yet the
[1:36:05] drag that's like you to drag into church
[1:36:07] you got to brush his teeth you're going
[1:36:09] to feed the thing you've got to look
[1:36:11] after the thing watch the thing dress
[1:36:13] the thing you know you got to drag
[1:36:14] around Britain you got to make it pray
[1:36:17] you got to make it read you gonna make
[1:36:18] it listen no what would you rather
[1:36:22] you know humanely would you rather be on
[1:36:25] a dick chair on a beach somewhere
[1:36:26] sipping something fancy Oh would you
[1:36:29] rather be living everyday kind of life
[1:36:32] everyone if you're honest you'd say I'd
[1:36:34] be on the beach on holiday this thing
[1:36:37] only wants a holiday it only wants a
[1:36:39] holiday but that you got to keep the
[1:36:41] flesh subjection to the Word of God
[1:36:43] right because if you sit on a beach all
[1:36:45] day drinking fancy drinks you'll become
[1:36:47] lazy you'll become fat you'll probably
[1:36:50] die of a heart attack or something you
[1:36:52] know you have no character you have no
[1:36:55] character whatsoever the slightest huh
[1:36:57] you know waiter there's a breeze Oh move
[1:37:01] that class you know I that person taking
[1:37:03] my picture I can't stand this anymore
[1:37:05] begin there's no character that's what
[1:37:09] that's what this guy wants who are you
[1:37:12] pandering to I'm following my heart no
[1:37:15] I'm following God's Word hallelujah
[1:37:18] so narrow is the way so it's not a broad
[1:37:22] way it's a narrow way hallelujah and
[1:37:26] Strait is the gate we know straight
[1:37:27] there Str AIT means water repenting me
[1:37:30] baptized the name of Jesus Christ and to
[1:37:32] what are you baptized churches or him
[1:37:35] the word Jesus Christ so Strait is the
[1:37:38] gate and narrow is the way open doesn't
[1:37:41] pertain to salvation he's sure they sure
[1:37:45] because the first question should be
[1:37:47] Lord does this please you or does it not
[1:37:49] please you and if you're in a
[1:37:51] relationship he will tell you and if you
[1:37:54] really want to be in a relationship
[1:37:55] he'll tell you but if you have your mind
[1:37:57] made up
[1:37:58] actually that's this way and I'm just
[1:38:00] going to cover it with a religious
[1:38:01] veneer you just go on I don't want to be
[1:38:05] answered according to the idol of my
[1:38:06] heart God lines your prayer according to
[1:38:10] the idol of your heart the pins what
[1:38:12] they had idol is but if God's in there
[1:38:14] you have no Idol he's the idol as word
[1:38:17] as the idol hallelujah Amen an education
[1:38:22] can learn you or teach you mathematics
[1:38:24] can teach you history whatever more but
[1:38:26] cannot bring life to you your education
[1:38:28] will not do that God has one way of
[1:38:31] bringing light to you that's when you're
[1:38:33] ready to separate yourself from all
[1:38:35] things of the world and all the cares of
[1:38:37] the world and will cling only to God's
[1:38:39] promise
[1:38:40] right Paul was a Nazarite unto the Lord
[1:38:44] now we known as writers someone
[1:38:46] separated right he was separated from
[1:38:48] his Orthodox Church to the Word of the
[1:38:50] Living God
[1:38:51] Aaron was a Nazarite and the Lord he was
[1:38:53] separated from among the Brethren to
[1:38:54] bear the birthstones to be the high
[1:38:56] priest it was a total separation we're
[1:38:59] not to go back into the world no more or
[1:39:01] have anything to do with the world but
[1:39:03] cleave only to God Jesus is coming after
[1:39:06] a bride a woman a church that separated
[1:39:08] from the things of the world or the kids
[1:39:10] of the world she separated from the
[1:39:11] fashions of this modern age we live in
[1:39:13] she separate from the keys and the
[1:39:15] traditions of churches she's separated
[1:39:17] only to God and God is the word and as
[1:39:20] husband and wife as one so does the
[1:39:22] bride and the would become one for the
[1:39:24] woods living through the bride that's
[1:39:26] her credentials
[1:39:27] that's her identification hallelujah God
[1:39:30] calls for a total separation from
[1:39:32] unbelief and he does it you've got to
[1:39:34] give yourself to it
[1:39:35] all right I'm waiting for God to speak
[1:39:38] here it is are you looking for an answer

[1:40:01] full of the world and and their
[1:40:02] affections and things on on the earth
[1:40:05] God can't speak amen
[1:40:10] but isn't it wonderful I'm glad you know
[1:40:12] I mean when the Lord was dealing with me
[1:40:14] I just got sick of the status quo of my
[1:40:16] life God was just stirring during the
[1:40:18] nest he doesn't want to leave you in
[1:40:20] that but you've got to respond otherwise
[1:40:21] I'll just get worse I just come easy

[1:40:43] true value of becoming one with him the

[1:40:48] inheritance is in Jesus Christ the open
[1:40:51] word right don't worry about the
[1:40:52] Scarecrow's in there
[1:40:54] the glorious thing is to become one with
[1:40:55] that anointed word for your day now what
[1:40:58] is it the same word nothing can be added
[1:41:01] or taken from it so that same word moves
[1:41:05] from the head as it as the day comes
[1:41:07] closed down into the body down into the
[1:41:10] body vindicating that they are one now
[1:41:13] here's the head here's the word right so
[1:41:15] it comes down into the body vindicating
[1:41:17] that they are one holy this you want
[1:41:20] some vindication you see the word become
[1:41:21] flesh in you I mean that is that is your
[1:41:24] did there's the body vindicated I won
[1:41:26] they're husband and wife their flesh
[1:41:28] their flesh of his flesh word of his
[1:41:30] word lifers of his life spirit of a
[1:41:32] spirit see amen

[1:41:42] same word same book Amen same science
[1:41:45] these things I do show you do also Oh
[1:41:47] hallelujah my notice the vindicated word
[1:41:50] in his body as his very victory and the
[1:41:54] reason of his death see the death not in
[1:41:56] the spirit when he died he only died in
[1:41:58] the flesh a spirit went to the went to
[1:42:00] hell and preached the souls in prison
[1:42:02] that's right can we go next one please
[1:42:03] brother Andy his flesh only died then he
[1:42:06] raised it up again and quickened quicken
[1:42:08] means made alive his flesh which is his
[1:42:10] body that's the word that's been laying
[1:42:12] dead for years but it gradually began to
[1:42:14] come in the and the Reformation now
[1:42:17] she's standing up on her feet oh I wish
[1:42:20] I had time to go back into Ezekiel and
[1:42:22] bring out them dry bones and show you he
[1:42:24] said can these bones live again he said
[1:42:26] prophesy how can prophesy come only
[1:42:29] through the Prophet it's the word of the
[1:42:31] Lord
[1:42:32] he hear ye ye dry bones the word of the
[1:42:35] Lord and in the last stage of Ezekiel's
[1:42:37] you know the mighty army coming forth
[1:42:39] was when Ezekiel prophesied over the
[1:42:41] bones and then life came in and they
[1:42:44] stood up as a mighty army holy as a
[1:42:46] living people once again and he said the
[1:42:48] only way that life can come is through
[1:42:50] the mouth of a prophet because that's
[1:42:52] God's that's God's mouthpiece to an H
[1:42:54] I'm it's a God has spoken a word in this
[1:42:56] age that life will come into the body I
[1:42:58] mean that life will come into the body I
[1:43:00] mean that the body and the head will be
[1:43:02] united as one I mean that's a
[1:43:04] vindication
[1:43:05] I mean you want to see
[1:43:06] proof Lord am i walking in the way you
[1:43:08] see his word living in you I mean that
[1:43:10] is the vindication you're part of the
[1:43:12] break because you're part of him
[1:43:13] hallelujah amen so it's when the prophet
[1:43:16] speaks the word that word is released
[1:43:18] and member if you take that as a natural
[1:43:21] place natural scene of a valley there
[1:43:22] were rocks in the valley there's maybe
[1:43:24] shrubs whatever more than that dry place
[1:43:26] but there are people right and when that
[1:43:29] word was spoken didn't make the rocks of
[1:43:31] life then make the trees and life it
[1:43:32] made the people of life so those people
[1:43:34] that were ordained those bodies are a
[1:43:36] dangerous seed that prophecy came to
[1:43:38] life hallelujah it's the same thing with
[1:43:41] you and I friend God has released his
[1:43:43] word on in this age and it's going to
[1:43:45] over the whole world
[1:43:46] and it's caused a lot of things to
[1:43:48] happen but it's after one thing the
[1:43:51] Bride of Christ to be quickened to be
[1:43:53] made alive hallelujah and God releases
[1:43:57] his life through the words I speak Jesus
[1:43:59] said they are spirit their life i
[1:44:01] immense it is life in the word that's
[1:44:04] why it's so vital don't worry about
[1:44:06] scarecrows people saying there's nothing
[1:44:09] total people saying it's this but it's
[1:44:10] not what they're saying it is don't
[1:44:11] worry about those things walk with Him
[1:44:14] the word will produce ya who's prepared
[1:44:17] ground who's prepared who's a prepared
[1:44:20] ground that means that when the seed
[1:44:22] comes in and the Holy Spirit waters that
[1:44:24] it will produce itself the life will
[1:44:26] produce itself you have confidence that
[1:44:29] the word will produce but don't try and
[1:44:31] choke it out with the kids the world and
[1:44:33] whatever is going on say Lord may our be
[1:44:35] fruitful for you you'll be fruitful for
[1:44:37] something it will either be the world
[1:44:39] will be God's Word right and we know
[1:44:42] that this world is like tears and thorns
[1:44:45] and thistles and weeds they grow faster
[1:44:48] he's healing spread out and grow well
[1:44:50] where'd that come from was in there
[1:44:51] those things gonna be plucked out but so
[1:44:54] don't pander to the world Pandit to God

[1:44:59] better give yourself to him you want
[1:45:02] everything you want God to sort out the

[1:45:29] solve things always the wrong way how
[1:45:32] many how many percent of time we try and
[1:45:33] fix things with our own ability
[1:45:35] especially me no now we've got to fix
[1:45:37] this you know your wife comes to you
[1:45:39] this is happening this is happening and
[1:45:40] then she she just needs to let it out

[1:46:00] about what's going on all but he knows
[1:46:02] he wants you to tell them right the only
[1:46:06] way that you really build relationship
[1:46:07] you take with children or husband and
[1:46:09] wife you've got to speak about what's
[1:46:11] going on and then you can really connect
[1:46:12] about it you can't just be living in the
[1:46:14] same house not actually living together
[1:46:17] amen
[1:46:18] you can't just dwell there or not say
[1:46:20] anything to each other well you know ah

[1:46:34] definitely preaching to myself now how
[1:46:36] did you this is how I felt when this was
[1:46:37] going on and there's a deeper kind of
[1:46:39] connection in yes I was there in this
[1:46:40] happened then you know you know what I
[1:46:43] mean you know what I think Allu you you
[1:46:46] got a you know but then you know men try
[1:46:49] and fix everything themselves but what

[1:47:01] we have a token we can present with our
[1:47:04] prayer the life of God in us we can
[1:47:05] present with our prayer that he hears
[1:47:07] our prayers he can undertake and we're
[1:47:09] going to have confidence and then we
[1:47:11] pray you really pray through see the
[1:47:13] devil just wants us to say prayers he
[1:47:15] just wants us to go through emotion but
[1:47:17] when we really touch heaven that's what
[1:47:19] it wasn't try and ward you off that's
[1:47:20] why maybe some of you been sitting here
[1:47:22] thinking about everything else but now I

[1:48:00] what we need to do we need to commit our
[1:48:02] waste to him cast your cares upon him
[1:48:04] because he cares for you don't cast your
[1:48:06] cares upon your iPhone it doesn't care
[1:48:08] for you but sometimes we put so much
[1:48:10] things into the wrong we're looking at
[1:48:12] the wrong it's distraction its
[1:48:15] distraction we don't want to be
[1:48:16] distracted the devil always try and
[1:48:18] distract us from the real value of the
[1:48:20] word if we can just keep you from it
[1:48:22] it's like I'll just close with this he
[1:48:25] said you know you know Jesus asked ask
[1:48:27] the people asked his disciples who do
[1:48:29] men say that I am a prophet that was not
[1:48:33] enough they put value on him but not the
[1:48:36] right value but in Simon Peter said thou
[1:48:38] art the Christ the Son of the Living God
[1:48:40] he put there he saw it for what it was
[1:48:41] but the devil can just get you to lower
[1:48:44] your thinking on it lower your thinking
[1:48:47] on the word that's a good message

[1:48:50] can hear about these eyewitnesses that
[1:48:52] you can see and this is neaten you know
[1:48:54] it's all that but it's more than that

[1:49:00] don't want to just diminish it down to
[1:49:01] something I was raised this way this is
[1:49:03] just how voice being like this but when
[1:49:05] have you meet him when you've really had
[1:49:08] that encounter he's and he's become a
