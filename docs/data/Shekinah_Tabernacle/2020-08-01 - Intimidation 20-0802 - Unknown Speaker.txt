for me hallelujah amen amen amen oh hallelujah you may be seated hallelujah i'll just use this microphone [Music] testing who's first god bless you everybody it's awesome to be here um i like that you know how the lord has done so much for us i've been over the last two weeks spending um every day with a girl that's the same age as rebecca and andy was good friends with her husband um glenn and we prayed for them at their pre-meeting two weeks ago glenn emily and maya and um emily and i have spoken about the lord every day pretty much for the last two weeks and she has she was buddhist and she has come to belord and she's yeah she's just having so many questions and so excited about the reality of what's happening in her life over the last little while and it's just really awesome because when you share your testimony like and you just didn't actually testimonies you share testimonies of people and you realize what the lord's really done for you how much has changed you from what you were changing you know all the things baptism and just everything that's happened you realize wow the lord is so good so good how could we do this life without him you know but it's such a joy that um i was thinking of a song and google knew nothing about it i couldn't find it anyway and then i just realized this morning it's because it was written here in the fellowship so um i don't know do you know savior's grace maybe isaac would you be able to help with the guitar is it all right if everybody that knows it sings it with me i think it's such a beautiful song and yeah google i couldn't find it anywhere so i'd love it if we all sing it i don't know if we sing it very often maybe we haven't sung it for a couple of years um just it was just um when i was thinking about my testimony and i thought well that's really been my testimony and then just looking forward to him taking us one day to be with him by his throne that's awesome but yeah if everyone could sing that'd be awesome [Music] you take me as i am and you take even more you break my heart of stone make me see your holy word take every bit of me so i'll see even more [Music] me take me [Music] love songs [Music] bring me to that place and set me [Music] free [Music] your face [Music] next me take me [Music] is fill me with your glories bring me to the place and set me free [Music] bring me to that place and set me [Music] free [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] of course we all know that christine had a baby on tuesday and that was a real blessing but for me it was a special blessing because tuesday was 34 years ago that the lord filled me with his holy spirit and it's just been a wonderful life and walked with him ever since and just gets better by the day i'm thankful [Applause] good morning everybody i must say the lord really has a sense of humor because um about 11 years ago um we matt and i visited um wellington and he asked me do you think we'll ever move here and i said to him um i'll never move to wellington i just don't like the weather and i just don't like the place and well here we are um so you know the lord's timing is always perfect you know we may not always understand what he does but we just have to always just trust his will um when we decided to move down here it was at a time where nobody really thought of moving it was during the recovered and we thought okay we should move down to wellington and um and when we decided and we started praying about it um it was just absolutely incredible to me how the lord opened every single door um it was just a matter of weeks and we were down here um someone asked me when did you guys decided to move and when i said just a couple of weeks ago it was it was actually so funny but um i just want to give give god all the glory um and a special thanks to everyone here in the fellowship for welcoming us and um just making us feel so part of this family um i just feel truly truly blessed us as a family to be a part of your family and we just want to thank the lord for that [Music] amen you are always surprised to see me as i am to see you so when we go outside just to save you the problem of asking who i am i'll forgive you brother i said onions you thought i said the onions it's o n i a s that's honest so please don't ask me again just remember it's on yours we haven't met before in this flesh but we used to be together in the mind of god before the foundation of the world so that's why you don't know my name that's why i don't know your name i was wondering whether something was saying say something say something my sister there when she said i didn't want to come to wellington i thought ah that's my son i think that's telling me that i need to do what i need to do i like the way you praise your god i like your freedom when you sing when i'm happy i sing as well so i won't tell you much that's my wife barbara we came from zimbabwe 20 years ago we went to the uk we're in the uk for 18 years and then we went to australia we were in australia for two years and then for some reason we came to new zealand we are staying in a little place called otaki it's up that way we're just midway between fielding and you people so we just thought who just come by just me and my wife out there we don't know another brethren out there i don't think there are any no turkey i don't think they even know who brother branham is but for some reason god put us there amen uh can i have this song coverage heal of sorrow it's 207. in the only believe songbooks i see a criminal stream of blood

gloom don't listen to the devil today no use jesus what do we see [Music] i see i see a crimson stream of [Music] uh [Applause] [Music] [Music] very nice to be back with you all testimony on wednesday morning my phone died and my um i didn't wake up in time to to get to work when i wanted to and um on the way to work i was a bit disappointed because i've been listening to a message it was about an hour's trip and i prayed to god my phone would turn on it turned on i was like that's real strange and it said zero percent like it was dead it had turned on i had turned off and it wouldn't turn back on because i already tried and then for 10 minutes i was listening to a william branham assuming saying how if you're sick or you need healing there's a way and the elders of the church will pray for you and you'll get better and then my phone died like pretty much right after that it just died and i was like man it's so strange and then i came to church that night and then brother and paul said you know the owls are here to be prayed for i just want to thank god you know he's so present in our lives he hung on the cross and took the 40 lashes for our healing and like everything we ask for is ours we just have to believe in faith i just want to thank god for healing me and for taking us out of this world [Music] [Applause] [Music] as you all know i've started a new job a few weeks ago so the last week was my first week where i worked two days from home and three days in the office so monday and tuesday i was working from home wednesday morning when i'm supposed to wake up to go to work i couldn't get up i was very sick i couldn't walk and then i'm thinking you've just started a new job it's your first week doing at two days work from home and the day you're supposed to go into the office you're going to call in off sick it's not going to happen i got off the bed i tried walking around i realized it's not going to work i said to my husband i'm very sick i need you to pray i didn't even think that painkillers exist at that point in time then he prayed for me and i started preparing myself i still could not but i just started thanking the lord for healing me then towards the end of my preparation i'm thinking i was sick i couldn't walk i even forgot that there was pain and i got to the train i was still fine during the day my husband is even asking me i know you said you're fine how are you i'm like there is nothing not a trace of pain nothing then i was just so encouraged that the lord will honor your prayer just pray and give him thanks and then he'll do the rest god i also thought i must just give god all the glory and the honor for he has been so he has done so much for me amen for me i would like to say that everything that happens in our lives has got spiritual implications amen so whether it's about food on the table whether it's about the clothes you're wearing for a child of god it must have a spiritual meaning if you can't find it it means you must give glory and honor to the lord that's for me what it means amen so i just want to thank god for about just over what one and a half years now that we came here and i realized today that for me it was not about immigration or coming to study or anything like that it was that the lord wanted us to be here at this point in time and i just want to thank him thank you for your prayers and for your love i i passed my course that i was doing and so uh on wednesday or was it tuesday um i was sitting down with brother phil and and my family and just my wife just checked the email and i found the results for the last course for my on my research paper that was remaining so on thursday so i just want to thank god for for that and also for me that is goddess must have some spiritual implication it must bring glory and honor to the lord otherwise why must i have it why must i have it if you can bring glory and honor to god otherwise i don't want it so if it can bring glory and honor to god i want it so and i just want to thank you for your love and for your prayers and let's continue to soldier on then if you have time brother indy we can sing that song if you have time amen so i just want to thank the lord because i was afraid like last week i wasn't feeling very good like i had like i was i had a bad cold and i went up for prayer and brother ben prayed for me with oil and now i'm fine [Applause] we serve a supernatural god amen god bless you since i just wanted to say thank you to the lord today for adding 16 and a half years more to my life i remember laying there in a hospital bleeding lots of just finding my life ebbing away with rebecca and today i think about it and just want to give all praise and glory and honor to god and also just thanking him that those 16 and a half years were better than the former years and i just want to praise god [Applause] [Music] um i'm i'm thanking the lord for i know you guys over the years have um often prayed for my middle daughter and i've you know her and i have had a rocky relationship in the last over 10 years i guess and she's going through a process now and i know that god's working on her life and she's she's told me she loves me and she's stopped blaming she's she stopped blaming me for everything and she's she she wants to talk to me now and so we're going down next week we're going to be in the south island we're going to be with her for about 10 days so it'll be really nice to be able to um i'm praying that i'll be able to witness to her as well and i'm thank you all for praying so much for her [Music] this water on my finger and um it really annoyed me that's um annoyed me at school but then um when we kept on praying for it but then um one day we were at someone's house and then a little bit fell off and then um i i'm put in the rubbish but then um when we're at church cleaning um that day um the same day it fell off more of it and um now it's off and you can't even see a mark of it on my [Applause] hey man i get to stand in the back a terrible week just just a busy week it's like the closer we get to to going home the more the devil wants to throw upon us you know just to keep us more busier and i found myself focusing at the wrong things but see so many people said it today it's a simple prayer to go lord and sincere to say re-calibrate me so that i can see you and everything because you start losing the focus you start not seeing god and everything you just see situations and problems and things happening but you don't see god in it and it was an honest prayer i was driving home and i just had enough i said lord just please recalibrate me to see you everywhere and it's like a flick of a switch and i can see him in everything i can every type is there natural type of spiritual we were working in the garden yesterday and it just keep coming up and the moment you get out there in god's nature you can see him everywhere so i encourage you if you can't see him right now ask him that you want to see him everywhere and he'll show you exactly where he is because he's in everything he's everywhere so praise the lord i'm glad that he re recalibrated me amen [Music] [Applause] i also want to add them to my dad's one yesterday and my dad set a fire because he um we had this we have this wood just lying next to the shed um so he wanted to make a fire and burn it in this um big uh bad light little barrel and then um we're doing the flex so we pulled it out and um satan's like the flex if he keeps on trying to fight um the fire but the fire keeps on burning him and then he just can't get um to burn he just can't get the fire and then if um the fire's going um did like air blows on it then it just goes and burns the fire and then burns the flax away and it's gone [Applause] [Music] i don't i don't know um i don't know what the lord's doing but there's just something inside me that's just bubbling and and i and i sat here thinking but lord i've already given my testimony but the lord wants me to say these words and i don't know whether it's for me or whether it's for someone else here but i kept putting it down and putting it down and then i the lord brought my remembrance to what brother alman said the other night and then the next thing he gave his testimony and i thought lord he didn't listen that night but i'm going to he said to us the other night that he was in church and and christine was giving a testimony and the lord put it on his heart to say something and he didn't say it and the lord made me remember this and the lord said to me now but i want you to say these words and i said no but i've already given my testimonies reminded me again do it so i'm going to do it okay i don't know whether this is for me or this for someone here but the lord wants me to say these words this is what i have prayed for so i don't know whether it's what i've prayed for being here today whether it's for someone else to hear it but he wants me to say those words this is what i have prayed for and i just want to just give him that [Music] god bless you brothers and sisters um you know me i'm not a talker and um i really don't did not want to sit here and be talking in front of you all but i also have something to say um and this is just a little word of encouragement to you my brothers and sisters lately i've been going through you know spiritually a really really rough time you know when you just you wake up and you feel like you're not a christian anymore or you just don't feel like serving the lord and you're in a spot where you feel obligated to but the love is gone that is that it's one depressing spot to be in when you don't you you know when the enemy tells you that you don't want to do it but you know i was listening to brother bam the other day and there was one thing he said he said um you must die to yourself and he said he said when you when you die to yourself right it's not about you fighting it's hard to die but just die like that chore it's like that chore your parents give you and you don't feel like doing it but the best way to get it done is to do it so i just want to say when you don't feel like taking that next step when you don't feel like doing anything the best remedy for that you know is to do precisely that because that is when the enemy is that's when he's fighting he knows you're about to make that move he knows the next thing you're gonna do is gonna be detrimental to his kingdom so when you don't feel like doing it that's the time to do it that's all i wanted to say thank you very much [Music] testimony i feel like at the same i looks like i'm a christian but some on the other hand i feel like i'm not good enough i just beat myself [Music] god is so good i mean he encouraged me to get up early in the morning a little bit family altar like that i feel something inside of my heart i'm not good enough i feel this courage i feel [Music] i can go further with the work and family and this life but this morning when i opened the bible romance chapter 12 he said and be not conformed to this word but be transformed about acceptable and perfect and we don't care god knows everything but i'm concerned [Music] if god never leaves me forcing me i that time i just keep going no matter what i'm going through praise all thank you [Applause] [Music] god bless you all um a few weeks ago i was sitting doing my work at school and my friend asked me um because he was talking with this other dyslexic kid and they asked me if you're not a christian you can steal right and i said no because in the ten commandments it says thou shalt not steal it doesn't say if you're not a christian then you can steal whatever you can't steal it's it that's period and then i start and then he started asking questions about the bible and then i then we ended up talking about um father son and holy ghost and i said your father is jesus so all three of them is one your father is jesus the son of god is jesus the holy ghost is jesus they're all the same things and he started and it like it looked as if he had it was a answer to something he's been a question he's been had on his heart the whole time so um i praise god for that [Music] i wish you all bye you know sometimes i just been sharing with the import about irritations and transforming irritations for perfection and brother brandon was talking about that pearl and um brought to my remembrance about 30 years ago i was a pearl diver up in west australia and how is the pearl formed it's formed by an irritation but when the pearl is formed there's beauty in that pearl and today i've just heard a lot of beautiful pearls come forth from the congregation and my added to this is in the cockpit 19 we were ready to fly up to uh northland we were standing for the andy and sister and we had to cancel that until another time and then we canceled again and then they says everything can go into credit so we had this almost six hundred dollars in credit on the flight and we decided that we'll go up since around about october october before october september august we kept looking at the flights my wife spent a good three or four hours looking around and then eventually we prayed about it and it all fell into place and we had to look at flights getting to the airport getting up to caretaker or offering to territory where we're going to stay what's going to happen and what is the objective and what was the purpose of us going up there god's always got in this program he's got that sorted for us i mean so then after a while we managed to get all the flights we got our credit rating back we got extra put back on it instead of costing 400 and something dollars to go to cherokee and back it only cost us 300 and something but you know you had to go persistently you had to be persistent about the things that you want to do if you have and god says you have a vision and we all have a vision we know what it is it's about saving souls amen [Music] so in all this time now it came down to the timing of the flights the accommodation and the time accommodation and now we just needed a vehicle so we looked at vehicles and they closed it down in september the high companies for vehicles so here our prices were starting to rise up again and then i remembered a brother up there in christ not in the message but someone i met he used to fly planes and teaches planes and all that and i met him in uncircumstances they were not good favorable for him but he ended up coming to church [Music] and from there he's been out in the world so he's now been touched by the amount of fellowship we've had over the last 15 years with this gentleman and his wife and eventually he told me that he used to preach when he was young on a soapbox in the streets of auckland and now he's in his 50 pluses and i'm looking at this gentleman and i'm saying you preached yes and he could rattle off what he was saying so he doesn't give much now he's he's he's a big tall maori fellow as well and he owns his own plane and so he's got everything comfortable he owns all his houses in auckland so what he was doing was a bit like paul he wanted to operate under his own esteem as a pharisee of pharisees and this is still the same spirit to today [Music] but what got under his skin was irritation that we didn't preach to him around my wife we invited him to our home we took care of him we never ever preached him just last time we're up we went to get our all our stuff to move down here and you're right sister wellington of all places [Music] but we got down here we got up there sorry and we invited him for dinner before we left and we told him we were moving down here by faith and like unto moses moving out of ur we continue to move on until we ourselves can separate and drop our own lots so we have lots to drop he then said to me he could see christ in us and then he was wanting to even further do something more about it like what's your bank account number so because we rely on the lord for these things but anyway whilst this is coming on now i contacted him and he was saying i just prayed for you guys this morning now the substance is why are you praying for us and he says because we're on the road we're in a podium now paddy key is where we were a couple of weeks ago from my sister's funeral so then we spoke about it and he's coming on the way down to auckland and from oakland is coming all the way down to wellington so now this is this is where it's the oddball is i said to him listen when are you back up in northland he says around about this time i said we will be there because he said to us you promised that you'll come up it says now that you've come down we promise we'll come up so we booked our tickets but we need a vehicle i said even a push bike will do and my wife says how about a horse so he says how about i give you a horse and a buggy so therefore our vehicle has been supplied so the lord knows what's upon our heart he may go around a long way right but he knows what's upon our heart and he knows that there's healing in the wings of the dove so that was what's happening so he's coming down here they are actually moving around now this is amazing what god does this gentleman decided that he would get his own camper van he'll travel out throughout new zealand he'll book himself into motels he'll pay his own way and he'll come and preach the gospel on the soapbox again so the stirring up of this was when we're up there and i says to him that we're about to leave and come down and i said about brother branham he said oh yeah i've read brother so 15 years and he didn't talk about brother branham and now he says he's read brother branham so he's now starting to get more conversation about the lord this conversation so he's coming down here with that one party political the one party which is the christian movement they're starting up again but god supplied him with a campervan with all the food all the money with all the accommodation and he's saying this is him so he'll be down here sometime soon in a couple of weeks so what they're doing as the group is going out and talking about christ to the people so i thought well if i go and see your party you can come and see our party so i just pray that he'll be able to come here and bring the group of them here and get a real party happening so that's my prayer god bless you all [Music] god bless you just very quickly for just to say sister henna i had the same scripture this morning romans 12 and i think it's the lord just confirming his word about the gifts as well that we've been hearing about and not to be conformed to this world but to be renewed in him you know by the renewing of of of our minds and the holy spirit does these things he leads us to perfection and fills us with his word and yeah i always think about the gifts we don't have to fear about it the lord leads us all the way on he gives us what we need and i just want to thank him for that for the revelation that he's given us each and every one of us praise the lord good morning saints i've been sitting at the back wondering should i shouldn't i should i and testimonies kept on going so [Music] i've had lately it's been it's been quite a struggle in myself there's so many things that's that's going on so many things i want to do but the lord just kept on telling me and and and the one thing that came to me is is the lord given me is of a story about mary and martha and where martha was so worried [Music] but martha was cumbered about much serving and came to him and said lord dost thou not care that my sister left me to serve alone but her therefore that she helped me and jesus answered and said unto her mother martha thou art careful and troubled about many things but one thing is needful and mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her and that is something that la rora has given me as well as search first my kingdom make sure that you and me are right and everything else will will be added onto it everything else will fall apart everything that you try to do everything will come to naught if you try it in your own way but if you make sure that you and the lord are he's your bridegroom and that is something that just to sit and be at his feet and not to worry about and run around and and wanting to do so many things but to sit at his feet and make sure that that is right then everything else will will be added onto it so praise the lord for that amen [Music] um also i've had all this time i've had bad dreams on the nights and i keep on jumping on my mum and dad's bed and i'll be constant like every night and i'll jump in my dad's bed like every night and now it's been like it's been better because um i haven't had so much dreams and if i do wake up i kind of can't go to sleep but literally sometimes like only sometimes and i'm really thankful for um not giving me bad dreams i've prayed for a lot [Music] so i think it was two or three weeks ago um i was sleeping and i had a really bad dream and i couldn't wake up and so in my dream i just sat down because like we were trapped in this house and there was demons all around and we could not get out so i just sat down and realized this is a dream and the devil is trying to trap me in this dream so i can be scared of him and just said satan you are not my boss you are not my lord the lord is the ruler over me i just prayed in that dream and cast the devil out and a few seconds after that i woke up and it was time to go to school amen resist the devil when you're awake and resist them when you're asleep amen hallelujah amen praise the lord i've got one testimony just short and i thought it might that affects us all you know amen and i really um you know uh have a burden for everybody and every you know and you know you you when you're close to people you have a burden for people right and we were praying and we as we do and we were having a prayer meeting at home one night at about 10 45 p.m and really praying through and pray through some real you know some gritty things and really just the lord just came into the room and shook the whole house literally the house went and we were i felt like i jumped out of myself like wow it was such a fright such a powerful thing and then we can we kept praying though we just kept praying we prayed and then brahman prayed and then after the prayer brahman she said that was not a coincidence there was something there's something spiritual about this earthquake so we went on to the earthquake geonet and the epicenter of the earthquake was on our hill and it went and we were praying for the whole church and we're praying for the vision and everything you know and and you know the lord just came and shook the earth and i believe that we're in a time of earth shaking and so that's why you know just let the lord deal with you he's going to shake your flesh let him shake it you're going to shake your spirit let him shake it because he wants to establish your soul and that was my testimony and i believe that we're in a revival amen so claim it walk in it but let him deal with you don't resist let him do it let him have his way because we're going home we're going home soon amen hallelujah hey man well it's it's been a while now we'll just stand and we'll sing a worship song and then we'll invite brother ben i'm sure there's fire burning in ben's bones right now so we'll let we'll lit we'll we'll relieve him and we'll let him release the fire amen hallelujah oh my let's um let's sing hallelujah nothing between my soul and the savior amen

hallelujah i mean thank you brother andy thank you musicians i mean good morning everyone i'm sorry christine and william couldn't make it today we tried to get them here but you know i'm sure we all understand these things amazing god bless you all let's turn to isaiah um chapter 36 i realize that time has run away but i'm just going to continue on the lord really undertook at his birth it was it was really special so yeah thank you very much um amen so isaiah 36 i'll just see if i can drive this thing now this is the the assyrians trying to make israel break hezekiah break here then uh rabbish rabb sheka stood and cried with a loud voice in the jews language this is upon jerusalem and said hear ye the words of the great king the king of assyria thus saith the king let not hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be able to deliver you neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord saying the lord will surely deliver us this city shall not be delivered into the um not be delivered to the hands of the king of assyria hearken not to hezekiah for thus saith the king of assyria make an agreement with me by present and come out to me and eat ye every one of his vine and every one of his victory and drink ye uh every one of the waters of his own cistern until i come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine and a land of bread and vineyards beware lest hezekiah persuade you saying the lord will deliver us hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of assyria were where are the gods of hamath and uh arfad uh where are the gods of uh sip havian and have they delivered samaria out of my hand who are they among all the gods of these lands that have delivered their land out of my hand that the lord should deliver jerusalem out of my hand but they held their peace and answered him not a word for the king's commandment was saying answer him not then came elekim the son of hilkiah that was over the household and um shebna the scribe and joa uh the son of of asif the recorder to hezekiah with their clothes rent and they told him the words of rap sheker however you pronounce that and we go down to uh verse 37 uh i mean chapter 37 verse one and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the lord see he knew where his strength came from and he sent elekim who was over the household and shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth unto isaiah the prophet the son of amos and they said unto him thus saith hezekiah this day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and a blasphemy for the children i come to the birth and there is not strength to bring forth it may be that the lord thy god will hear the words of raphaekya whom the king of assyria his master has sent to reproach the living god and will reproach the words which the lord thy god hath heard wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah and isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say unto your master thus saith the lord be not afraid of the words that thou has heard wherewith the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me behold i'll send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land and i will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land amen let's just bow he's in a word of prayer if you ever need you want to raise your hands to the lord gracious father lord you see the hands that are raised lord you see the burden of every heart lord you see what we're going through dear god but i want to thank you every moment of our lives we believe is predestinated by you lord you're not surprised what we are facing even now is not just as individuals but as a bride around the world and i just want to pray oh god that you would meet every need in the service dear lord may you come among us in a very very personal way a very special way speak to our hearts oh god we also want to lift up those who are not here today lord i pray you'd be their portion lord if they are watching by the way of the streaming lord may they feel your presence just come into the room father may speak to their hearts lord and father we just want to lift up this this this this sick world lord this covert 19 and many other viruses and pestilences around the earth and many are suffering lord not just your bride and i pray father you would just be merciful to them oh god you see those who are in hospital father those who are sick and unwell lord i pray you'd be their portion in this hour and lord we want to thank you lord that even though lord most of the world is still in a form of a lockdown we know your word cannot be bound amen so lord i just want to pray lord may just have your liberty in the service oh god meet every need for your glory we ask in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you and if you just want to keep your bibles handy i want to also i just didn't want to keep you standing too long i want to go to acts chapter 3 and just just read a portion of scripture here then we'll go into what i'd like to speak about this morning so now peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer being the ninth hour now i i just trust this ties together and a certain lame man from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which was called beautiful to ask arms of them that entered into the temple who's seeing peter and john about to go into the temple asked and and arms and peter fastened his eyes upon him with john and said look on us and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them then peter said silver and gold have i known but such as i have give i thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength and he leaping stood up and walking and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising god and it came to pass on the morrow that they're rulers sorry we're just jumping so i'm just jumping down to to chapter four here so this guy's been there for a long time and not everyone's happy about it and now here comes the devil and they have you know you know you know they you know they're all rejoicing and there's a great stir going on in the temple and you know the chief priests and things send the send their soldiers and what more to basically go arrest them and now and now we've kind of skipped the night and here we are the next day in front of their council and it came to pass on the murder that they're rulers and elders and scribes and anias the high priest and caiaphas and john and alexander and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest were gathered together at jerusalem and when they had set them in the midst who was that the man who was healed and the and the disciples they asked by what power or by what name have you done this amen and then peter filled with the holy ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and elders of jerusalem if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man by what means he is made whole be it not be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom you crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him does this man stand before you whole this is the stone this is the stone which was set at naught of you builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved now when they saw the boldness of peter and john they perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus i pray lord may this be my testimony and beholding the man which was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it but when they had commanded them to go aside out of i'm out of the council they conferred among themselves saying what shall we do to these men for that indeed a notable miracle has been done by them to is manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem and we cannot deny it so when and so we're just we're just jumping down to verse 21 here so when they had further threatened them they let them go finding nothing that they might punish them because of the people and all men glorified god which was done for the man was above 40 years old on whom this miracle of healing was shown now i want to speak this morning about intimidation we live in a day of great intimidation it may come in very uh you know you know in some countries it's very out and open but in other countries like this it's very discreet but yet it's just as powerful it's just as real it's just as threatening but i want to tell you this morning that our god is present i mean we don't need to fear nothing hallelujah but there is a power in the church right now amen that that is god is sent already into the bride i mean to overcome all intimidation now i just want to just kind of dramatize a bit this man that was crippled and he and he laid there by the gate you know for him maybe that's morning it you know it must have been like any other day you know i'm not sure what day the week it was you know that that man was dropped at the gate that day i i didn't quite catch that when i was reading it but you know we read there that he was above he was above was it 50 oh no no no he was above 40 years old and and whoever it was would daily drop him by the gate so you know maybe just say you know if he was dropped there daily by the gate and maybe he sat there for just 20 years of his life that would be 3 000 i mean i mean 7 300 times he was dropped at the gate so you could probably agree he knew his commute really well he knew what it was like you know to to to be picked up or however he was carried we do not know but you know for you know for just that space of time he knew it probably where every cobblestone was he knew the turn in the road he knew who would be standing there at that day and he'd be there at that day and he knew where he'd be sitting every day i mean so so he knew what it was like but this day was going to be a different kind of day this day was a very different kind of day amen when when but but his expectation was it's going to be like any other day but i just want to announce you maybe this day will be different for you oh yeah this could be a different kind of day i mean then every other time you've come into church hallelujah so here they were and you know you know the morning started for him like any other morning but you know there came a time where two men walked past him and he would say do you have any arms for the poor for the you know be merciful you know upon this crippled man and and and and these two maybe looked at him you know the same kind of way that maybe others did but but they had a different kind of look in their eyes because they had what this man really needed i mean he didn't need money he needed a healing he needed a touch from god almighty himself and so so peter and john they looked at him and you know they said look on us and he expected something from them and you know how people they get in a mode of thinking well i just need money to get by i need something we need more than just money to get by i mean we serve a supernatural god and it's going to take a supernatural rapture to take us out of this out of this world but i just want to say this morning god has sent a word into the earth this message to rapture a bride hallelujah so we don't need to worry about nothing but it depends where you try and draw your source of strength from so they would so so so he would he would look into their eyes and maybe hoping he was hoping we read that they you know he would get something from them but they said silver and gold have we known and maybe his heart sunk a little bit but he said such as we have if we did in the name of jesus christ nazareth rise up and walk and they took him by the hand and lifted it up and his ankle binds everything began to come normal and he went walking and leaping hallelujah into the temple rejoicing and it says that the people wondered what was going on now here he was he started the day as he thought every other day would be but this day was turning out very different and then he found himself dragged i mean so so it's amazing when god does something not everyone's happy about it you know no doubt when the people came in wondering they would have been amazement on their faces and some of them would have been so happy for this man because no doubt many that walked past him would have felt sorry he's been crippled from his mother's womb he's above 40 years old there's nothing that can be done for him i feel so sorry you know so some of them would have had such a happy look on their faces but then he saw a bunch of people with swords and slaves coming that didn't look too happy and sometimes you know when you know when god begins to do something in our lives not everyone's happy about it and the devil's sure not happy about it i mean so now an intimidation is going to come into his life that he never experienced before he experienced sympathy he experienced people feeling sorry for him but now here came an intimidation and he found himself dragged now here he was he was dragged in front of caiaphasis and you know anis and you know the high priest and all those ones with the disciples that morning he was sitting where you always sat but now he was standing where he never stood before amen and he was standing with a bunch of people that just looked like anyone else just like him and and and and the threats were coming by what power by what authority and what name do you do these things and they tried to intimidate them don't you preach in the name of jesus anymore and here's this man standing here and he's probably maybe wondering to himself hey he'd he'd still be rejoicing i'm walking he didn't need to be carried into that trial he walked do you need help no no i'm good you've seen me leap before i've never done that but i'll do it again oh do you want to see hallelujah so you know he was having a good time but then he maybe begin to take in the scene maybe he had seen the high priest and things from afar off that's the great holy reverend high priest you know and different things and their great cloaks and whatever more and maybe he never seen him in this kind of way but now now he was angry and they're trying to threaten the disciples and maybe he was wondering in his heart what are these guys going to say hallelujah they said something to him that no one had said to him before in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk no doubt many people would have said to him sorry i have no money because it's here silver and gold have we known so so he heard that bit many times but he heard a different bit and that different bit changed his life right hallelujah so now here he was saying i wonder what these ones are going to say and they stood there and i know i've probably said this many times but we'll say it again who should we serve you or god should we please god or please man which one tell us the one you builders the stone that the builder you builders rejected has made the head of the corner of this jesus of nazareth this word this living worth is manifested in your midst that you builders rejected that you should have brought into your churches and let god live in your church and change the people you rejected it hallelujah amen and here's my thinking i've never heard that before now let's just go back a bit before this trial he's thrown into jail with them i doubt very much he expected today i'm gonna end up in prison you know but there he was sometimes life takes us through very unexpected turns i mean but we should never god is not unexpected you know he's not he's not you know he sees your week ahead of you he's not surprised at any of it we have our plans he has his plans hallelujah you know sometimes we think man this is going pear-shaped and god's saying no it's going real well it's right on schedule it's under budget hallelujah it's going well hezekiah was in that kind of place and i'll come back to him later but you know he had he had turned the turn the people back to god he took away the hype um high places the idols the groves he cut that all down and he and he and he you know reconsecrated the temple and brought the people back to god and maybe in his mind you think now we're just gonna we're just gonna push out and take the land and but he found the enemy coming in and coming in and slowly all the wall cities of the of the country were taken and there he was in a spot many times we think everything's just going to go fine i i gave my life to the lord everything's going to go fine no no the battle begins the battle begins and now your faith is going to be put to the test and god isn't going to try and say you know there used to be um anyone who works in construction i did my stint and you know but it was actually just testing every time they would pour concrete they would they they would take two cylinders of of the concrete and they'd do a strength test at day three and day something else to see and if it failed the strength test was i had to rip out the concrete and report now god doesn't put us through that kind of test to see when are they going to break when are they going to break when they're going to break no when i say he he's going to prove your faith to you he's not looking for your breaking point say well i didn't think they could take it because this machine was going should just break the thing that's not what god does god wants to prove to you your faith works your faith holds your faith has power with him that's what he wants to prove with you amen he's not trying to find your breaking point well i thought that would break no no he wants to prove to you the salvation he has given you works it holds it'll keep you you'll be able to go through every trial no matter how big how small how terrible it may be god is wanting to prove your faith to you i mean i just want to let's just you know slides are a dangerous thing for me because i'm never oh there we go brother brown says this after the seals and he's and he's speaking about the woman you know you know who came in the prostitute woman that came into the simon the pharisees house where jesus was sitting with unwashed feet and uninvited and you know he was you know she she couldn't stand and being like that and she snuck in and you know you know the story and then when and but then it's amazing i just love these words when jesus spoke back to the pharisee he justified her by her works because he said simon i've got somewhat to say to thee simon says say on you know i came in you didn't wash my feet didn't kiss me welcome didn't anoint me or whatever but this woman ever since she came in here broke her alabaster box on my feet wiped her feet with my tears wash it hello use it her yo her god-given towels her glory on her head to wash my feet he says but when so so he justified her by her works but when he justified her to herself he justified her by her faith see god wants to justify us to our self right he wants to see there's always a battle going on the devil says you're not a believer but god says you're a believer hallelujah he wants to justify you to yourself because many times we have a battle am i a believer am i not and it's because the devil wants to say you're not going to make it you you know the blood didn't work for you you're just doing this thing because everyone else is doing this thing but god wants to come around and say no hold on where were you where i where were you when i found you where were you when i found you hallelujah you were lost and undone wandering down life's into darkness you know maybe in very dark places like legion was but i called you out of there i called you out for a purpose hallelujah i saved you for a reason amen not just to make you a message believer but i would come and live in your life my word would manifest hallelujah through your life hallelujah that's the reason there's a purpose we're here right but the devil tries to stop us living out our purpose so here he was we're just gonna as i say it's dangerous there we go we're gonna go back to the man before this trial he's thrown into prison and you know prison um maybe maybe let's just say he was thrown into a different cell than the disciples and his cellmate would say what are you in for what are you in for and maybe he'll just say no no you know and then maybe his selma would say did you hear about all this tumult in the temple and you know these these these religious fanatics saying about the name of jesus but this man was healed and you know all this stuff going on because you know it spreads people talk people talk and then and then he'd ask him what are you in for he'd say no no i'm not in for anything well then why are you here i'm just the evidence what do you mean you're just the evidence well i'm just the living evidence that jesus heals i mean jesus fixes broken places jesus takes complexes and things that up our walk i'm just the evidence hallelujah that his name has power amen that he has deliverance in his name hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah so but he found himself hello evidence how are you you know you don't put people in an evidence drawer you know anyway you know what i mean anyway praise the lord so so he but he found himself in the great clash of the ages he thought he was just a crippled man sitting by a gate every day but god had a greater purpose in his life hallelujah but he found himself caught up in the great clash of the ages on one side the holy ghost was present amen dwelling in his redeemed people and looking for more of his redeemed people hallelujah searching out for every name written in the book amen as i will i think i left um uh i finished last sunday from daniel 12 where he says in that day there'll be a time of great trouble as which has never been upon the earth but michael the great prince will stand up for the children of thy people amen and everyone whose name is in the book will be redeemed so we must realize we're living in a time of great trouble right this this world is you know shaking like it's never shook before you may say well we've had pestilence before and we have we've had plagues before and we have but this is different why is it different because america is speaking like a dragon right prophecy is being fulfilled and their enemies are waiting for them to finally show because the cracks are showing in that great country right it's falling apart you know brother brahm said you could have an abraham lincoln and a george washington in every county in the nation and it wouldn't fix it amen so it's falling apart but you see an enemy waits for the one that's in power for a time to strike they know they couldn't strike them when they're in their power and they're unified but wait for them to become divided and that's from page news right now so this is a different kind of season but in this kind of season this is when god is going to come down and take his bride away this is the hour of the resurrection i believe we're living in it amen hallelujah so you know so this is a different hour i say well 2021 or 2022 then i'll be able to fly around the world we may not get there jesus might take us home before then i think that'd be amen i hope so too brother ben hallelujah you know but so we should be looking now what are we looking to fulfill in this hour the last promise of the church in this house is a change in the body right that's the that's the promise we're living under and that is the that is the one thing amen we must be looking for sure we should plan for the future naturally but don't get caught up in all of that have your eyes upon the word in this day amen so he found himself in the great clash of the ages one side the holy ghost was working redeeming his people and on the other side was the antichrist amen and the antichrist was standing there trying to stop the word of god being fulfilled amen so and and and this is where i got my title from about intimidation now intimidation the cambridge dictionary tells me it means to frighten or to threaten someone usually in order to prosp to persuade them to do something you want them to do that's what intimidation is so it's to try and frighten or to threaten someone in order to get them to do what you want to do we're living in an hour of great intimidation even in this country you say well we're in a bubble in the bottom of the pacific and no this this country there's a very subtle intimidation in this country you've got to talk like the majority you can't disagree with nobody and if you do you're in trouble right as as as brother isaac would say you know this is the place where the where the haters are hated or everyone hates the haters or everyone's label are you just a bigot or you have whatever more people can't even in this world you can't even have a difference of opinion right why what's happening is because there's a forcing now everyone must agree conform to the same mind but we but the bride is the mind of christ i mean we have a different kind of thinking a different kind of outlook to the to the rest of the world you know we know everyone everyone has to fulfill a role in this day do you know this whole world is a stage do you know everyone is playing a role everyone upon the earth is playing a role not just trump not just putin not just whoever's up there in the in the government everyone is playing a role you actually haven't have a script you have a role to play but it's actually your your free moral agency which will dictate who you're going to play in the script because jesus said whomsoever will let him come and drink the waters of life freely we know this predestination i believe in it but it's but god doesn't force us through a pipe and just make us the bride of christ we've got to surrender we've got to die we've got to really die we're going to our will has to die and his will come in see everyone has a script everyone's got a role hallelujah what part do you want to play this hour sure we love to see where the bride walks on streets of gold and you know how we how how the devil's cast into the lake of fire we rejoice in those things i mean but it's not just that part of the role that's being played right now there's a walk there's a race we've got to run it's a it's a race of self-denial right take up your cross deny yourself take up your cross and follow me sure there's a lot of intimidation in this hour but we've got to overcome it and the lord has given us the power now to overcome all intimidation amen hallelujah amen so this world even even that you know that's the power of social media in this day people make something that's disagreeable they get cancelled this is a world of cancel they call it cancel culture amen cancel culture so if you do anything say anything that's contrary i mean to what the world is saying you just get tired and feathered publicly everyone know what tara and feather means publicly get dipped in a bunch of tar get covered in feathers now you just look like the full and this is what this world wants to make us try and look like the devil because he wants to make us to intimidate us to do what he wants to do but his brother moore said who's the boss amen who's my boss you're not my boss devil god's my boss hallelujah so you know we need to just stand you know god gives us power i just want to just say we're not left here alone maybe hezekiah was wondering how are we ever going to get through this here came the enemy you know saying your god won't help you your god is just like all the other gods we conquered them we'll conquer the same one i remember but he came to the wrong city he came to the wrong believer in the sao hala he came to the wrong person amen if you know the lord he came to the wrong city hallelujah and though though hezekiah was intimidated though he knew that that assyria could take the could could could take the city i mean he went to his source of strength now it's amazing with intimidation they'll get you to try and think a certain way and your and your thought pattern will be reduced down to certain things and that's what they were trying to do with the disciples stop preaching in this name otherwise you're in trouble so now what were they going to live under the promise of the hour or their threats oh we better conform we better just yeah i just want to get through life and i want to you know i just don't want to cause any trouble rock any boats if you're a believer the boat's already been rocked the devil's boat's already been rocked you can't help it remember but to i think i think brother ron spencer said it and forgive me if i'm jumping around a lot but you know he said in order to haul in the hang of fame you got to go through a hall of critics right you have to go through a hall of critics i mean so if you're doing anything for god you'll be criticized right you'll be made fun of you'll be ridiculed why because it's the devil trying to intimidate you to sit down and shut up but the holy ghost is here i mean to anoint the gift in our lives i mean that god can work through his body what was the hype what was the antichrist spirit trying to do through the high priest and things trying to stop the apostles actually operating in their office as apostles that's what he's trying to do he's trying to get them to sit down and shut up that god couldn't flow through their lives because they were ordained as apostles it wasn't them trying to be apostles god put them in that place i mean god it's not us trying to be the bride of christ god made us the bride of christ god made us his beloved we are the apple of his eye not because of what we could do because he chose us hallelujah remember brother braham says in the bible says it you know god's love is shown by election how do you know that god loves us i'm just paraphrasing because he says jacob have i loved but esau have i hated before they even born and the apostle paul picks it up and brother mcc it shows god's love is shown in election it's not like parental care love like hello parents here our love for our children is i want to keep them from all harm because you know what parent here loves to see their their their kids go through a grinder and get mashed up hurt scarred sick none of us do we want to keep them from everything but that's just parental care love that's not god's love god's love has shown an election right before that those two were ever born jacob have i loved east or have i hated before they even born god's love was shown in election because he knew what they would do amen so so well what has that got to do with me god's called you who's been called who's been called why they call you because he's justified you so if i'm justified i said devil shut up you have no right to say i'm not a believer i'm not going to make it i'm not an overcomer no that you're just talking about yourself and trying to share your experience with me i'm not here to join the pity party of the devil he's not a believer he's a make-believer he he'll never be washed there's no blood for him he's never going to make it he's going to burn right but the bride is going to walk victorious out of the earth how did you get to the wedding sup a little bright because jesus wanted me here hallelujah and if he wants me there i'm going to get there i can go kicking i can go screaming or i can go victorious i don't want to be a deathbed confession kind of believer i want to i want to walk with god every day i don't know how many more days upon the earth we have but let's give our god our all right hallelujah how we how we treat each other how we treat our families maybe to the glory of god how we treat our associates at work let it be to the glory of god how we treat the lost ones on the street let it be to the glory of god may they see something that they want let's be salty shall we children hallelujah amen so i'd rather just walk you know you know what the devil hates are consecrated brother braham says this is the thunder that shakes the devil a consecrated lived voice i mean a lived voice it's not someone that just says about quotes of scripture in the bible but it lives in them that's who wants to shake the devil live that kind of life and you'll shake the devil hallelujah oh can it be done that's why jesus died so it can be done hallelujah amen amen so he's trying to get us to think a certain way that all we can live through is what he's trying to get upon us and that's what they were trying to do to hezekiah we've taken all of the walled cities of judah or israel whichever king he was over we've taken all these other nations their gods didn't help them your god won't help you your god is like all the other gods this is going to be the end result and and when the spokesman for the king of assyria said all those things he was speaking in the hebrew tongue they even asked him i just i'm skipped over but you gotta read the account they said please don't speak in the syrian tongue we understand it don't speak in hebrew but the enemy doesn't do that he said no i'm going to speak in a language that everyone understands what does he do then you're not going in a rapture you're not going to make it these other christians have been swallowed up by the beast right he'll do the same with you you think you're really going to escape the wrath that's going to come upon the earth that's not going to happen the the promise has been lingering too long doesn't he say that though it may tarry it's going to happen why why is it towering because these people got to come in there's a re we're not just occupying time we're here for a purpose i mean there's people whose names are on the book they must come in i mean they're on the lamb's book of life i remember they have to come and they're going to come under the blood i mean they would become one with the lord jesus christ amen and they're out there somewhere hallelujah we should not be caught up in the political arena of this day jesus said to pilate if my kingdom was of this world then my subjects would fight but my kingdom is not of this world i mean so i'm to live a life that proves which kingdom i belong to i'm not going to get caught up in what's going on in the world are we caught up in his kingdom and his brother phil said what's his kingdom interested in souls one soul is worth more than ten thousand worlds that's how valuable one soul is doesn't matter about the packaging on the outside hallelujah sometimes they're not wrapped up too well we think but god knows where his seat is that's what we should be focused upon lord we we cannot go home until that last one comes in we're actually and and that's what the devil wants to keep us actually pinned upon the earth because he knows that god can't lose one but he fights with all he can that god may lose one because if god loses one the devil's won right so he tries to get us caught up in all different kind of things but we must be about our father's business amen which is what finding that last one that we can go home that's why i pray god maybe we just have such an atmosphere i mean that it will affect our work will affect the people on the street even as we go through pack and save getting the groceries may be such an atmosphere harley you're lord that there'll be people that see us and it's more than long faces long hair long dress i mean maybe a jaw in our hearts that we're rejoicing i'm glad i'm i'm glad that sunken yeah it's like brother tim brooks says if you don't get it today you'll get it tomorrow you know but you know but but you know this should be such a joy i'm going home there's nothing holding me here jesus paid it all doesn't matter what the mind battles say remember here was hezekiah think about it the devil's telling him you're toast you turned the nation to god it didn't help you none what good did you try to line up with the word do we've taken your land we've taken every wall city this is not doing you any good look your children are gone these ones are gone these ones have gone sideways what good is your life done where he was trying to get him to you know this way but hezekiah he had a source of strength and he knew that the final page of the book wasn't turned over yet and he went to a source of strength and he told the he told the lord what the enemy was threatening him worth hallelujah but he was hezekiah he wasn't like the other nations he was a circumcised son of abraham amen living in the promised land and his heart was set lord i want to serve you this is where we're standing he was standing in his inheritance he was a godly king and here comes the devil coming along to him saying i'm going to get you boy what about you and i i believe i'm looking at a people whose hearts are lord i want to serve you i love you i'll serve thee because i love thee amen hello lord you're more than life to me your your love is all i long for i want you lord amen it doesn't matter about remember it's not him that falls at him that gets back up maybe you've bitten too much you know maybe you've eaten too much dirt because the devil's kicked you down one too many heaps just get back up get back up amen hallelujah so here he was a circumcised son of abraham standing as a godly king living in his inheritance i could say he is adopted son of god living in his position and here the devil comes along trying to make him think you're just like everybody else you're a king like these just these other kings you are the same i'll say we may be people but we're not the same amen because we have a living god a living god amen that and the god that gave the promise is the same god that will fulfill his promise amen don't you think he can't keep his word amen it's impossible for him to fail that's the one thing he cannot do is fail i mean so if he gave you the promise he'll keep the promise he'll fulfill the promise because he promised it and he cannot fail hallelujah he kept the promised abraham hallelujah and it says in the book of hebrew um hebrews i don't have it on me right now but he says when when an oath is confirmed then you cease from all strife so when god confirms his promise then you can rest and remember if you've even just been saved the whole promise of all every promise of god belongs to you the holy ghost belongs to you healing belongs remember if he healed you once he can heal you again and because by one offering he's healed you by one offering he saved you by one offering he redeemed you and your children amen every single promise of god is yours hallelujah when he just confirms one because the same god that gave the first promise gave every other promise so now if he's confirmed his oath to you amen you can rest don't need to worry the devil tried to make us worry he tried to get hezekiah to worry but here's a kite and try here's a kite and go to his men of war saying how we're going to do this boys do we have enough supplies do we have enough arrows and weapons and you know other other gates barred and you know do we have no sure before the enemy came he you know made the springs go you know you know divert them into the city and all those things but when the enemy finally came so he made preparations so don't get me wrong in times of peace prepare for war right that's what we should do i'm just having a glorious jubilee on the mountaintop prepare for war prepare for war don't slack don't just sit back and say no no prepare for war how do you prepare for how do you prepare for war pray seek him in his word lord i want to receive strength hallelujah it's like you know you know it's like soldiers they go through um training before they go into the battlefield and they've got to carry big packs on their back and they've got a you know you know um do like commando crawl under barbed wire and there's and these machine guns brother and says like live machine gun rounds firing but the machine gun can only fire a certain height and they've got to go under that and there they have simulated combat and all these things and maybe you know they would think why do we have to go through all this and the drill sergeants screaming in their ears every hour night of the day and they've got to get up and run and do all these things and why i have to carry this pack and this and this shovel and this hand grenade and why i'd have to do this but then when when they finally go into combat every time that the drill sergeant screamed at them they they loved the man every time they said why do i have to carry this hand grenade then they use it they say i'm so glad i carried that hand grenade or why do i have to take the shovel when they're digging their foxhole they say thank god i carry this thing one time when it's training it's a pain on the battlefield it saves their lives and it's the same thing with us why do i have to read this word why do i have to listen to the message you may never know when it'll come in handy i mean when the enemy comes against you i mean then then the word comes forth into your mind amen defeats those thoughts you'll say thank god i heard that sermon thank god i read the word thank god i'm in communion with my lord hallelujah and this drill sergeant that screams at you maybe every sunday say thank god for that guy hallelujah hallelujah it'll be worth it amen amen hallelujah but you see now hezekiah got caught up he actually because remember we can't stop the devil putting thoughts in our mind we are not immune you say i'm in the bright age i'm the in the bride the bride is in a bright age we've been called adelaide this year ladies here's still going on right but we're not immune from ladies here affecting us god doesn't just put us in a big bunch of bubble wrap and you know roll us down the hill and we're all fine there'll be battles we know there'll be mind battles we're not immune from spirits but we have a power within us to overcome every single one hallelujah so the devil will try and bring his depression trump bring some lust or pride or whatever feeling sorry for ourselves or it may be he'll bring all those things but there's a power within us to overcome every spirit i mean let's just wait this comes to mind i just need to read this as i say men's slides are he says in deuteronomy 33 25 thy shoe shall be as iron and brass and as thy day so shall thy strength be we have a day as our day is we have a strength yes hallelujah amen and jesus said this is in wisdom versus faith your name is in the palm of my hand so how is it ever going to be forgotten can't be our names are written in the palm of his hands it's not he didn't write them on byro you know you're with byron on her hand it gets washed off after a while they're engraved they're part of him then if jesus defeated satan upon faith knowing who he was he was a predestinated creature are you ready amen are you ready congregation says amen so that's so that so that's what you read out loud what about the predecessor bride of jesus christ now you believe the bride is predestinated the pre-disabled bride of christ now the church the word seed with everything that god promised to put in the church in it right now it's in it now everything is in order it's in it now i need more no it's here it's here the word is here the lord has opened his word his fullness amen we're not just living under justification like luther we have the whole thing we're not just living under sanctification like weasley we have the whole thing we're not just living under the gifts we have the gifts and everything we have the giver hallelujah so everything is set in order as i said everyone's gonna fulfill a role and the bride of christ is standing to her attention we're standing to our attention sister hannah harley god's called us we accepted the part because we're made to be you know some actors are just made to play a part how they're built how they speak how they conduct themselves this man was made to build you know played this part of this woman this woman's made to play a role it's not foolish virgin role it's wise virgin role as bride of christ's role hallelujah why because it's just something it's like the woman at the well she heard a lot of sermons she was religious there's a man here from who's a jew they begin to speak we have no dealings because he just asked her for a drink and you know then then they begin to talk about worship and who dug what well and how this church was founded how this church was founded man-made digging wells and whatever more but then finally it came down to jesus said go get the husband and you know they begin to talk and she says we know where messiah cometh he'll do these things she heard a lot of preaching but something in his voice went beyond her ear and cinder is like hand and glove in her heart hallelujah remember the scrubs and pharisees heard the same kind of voice and they said this man's beelzebub but something in her said we know where messiah cometh he'll do these things he'll do these things and and he didn't explain the ministry he just said well i'm he hello why because the word that she heard something just anchored into her heart this is really you don't know what you've been looking for but this is what you've been looking for and it's found you hallelujah what was happening god was calling his bride in that first age and she just found herself she just fits the role why because she had an ear to hear right all through the church age it's been him that had an air let him hear what the spirit says to the church amen and that is the condition i mean that's what you should look at do i have an ear to hear and something in me just says well for some reason i do that's god-given that's not you given it's not because you've got perfect hearing it's got nothing to do with that it's the condition of there's a seed in your soul i mean that's been laying there and i believe has now come to life why because you heard a voice you heard the voice of the resurrection amen bringing you to life hallelujah so she just found herself i fit this role real well you can go through peter james and john they they saw a lot of rabbis their whole life was built around worship the jewish life it wasn't just a casual thing you know oh we're a secular country and no no it was their whole life was based around the feasts and different things and so they saw a lot of rabbis that they they would have heard a lot of preaching but then when one one man walked past their boat one day come follow me hand in glove i heard a voice my jesus is good amen so now we just find ourselves standing to attention hallelujah the holy spirit has been given the seed has been sowed the evening lights has been shining the sign of sodom that jesus promised is here right is here and malachi 4 was malachi 4 who turned the hearts of the children back to the original faith i mean that's why we've gone back to a book of acts pentecost not on azusa street by god dwelling in his people and we've gone back before the church ages began god dwelling in his people living his word out hallelujah amen a predestinated church he says oh devil church of the living god here and on tape too so so that covers us do you know where you stand do you know where you stand do you know where you stand in him hallelujah we stand in a glorious place i mean we stand redeemed we stand wash it doesn't matter what the devil tells you hezekiah was told a lot of things but he went to a source of strength and i believe with you know this morning we're going to our source of strength the word of god we're going to our lord jesus hello and he's here to tell you do you know where you stand this morning not where you're going to end up do you know where you stand right now hallelujah amen because just a simple heartfelt repentance and confession changes you from lost or found now there's not a big seven steps it's just a simple lord i'm wrong save me say my soul of god i'm sorry for all my sin change your life you go from lost to found just in a moment hallelujah amen amen i um just from memory but i believe brother brahm had someone come in the prayer line for sickness or something he says actually you have a greater need you don't know jesus do you want to become a christian before we pray they say a simple prayer says god bless you and he prays for the person it's about eight seconds it's not hard amen do you know that you you were called of god that the holy ghost reigns in your heart and every word of god is real to you i don't believe i'm looking at a bunch of souls complexes derail them and they fail i don't believe we're built for that and even saul ended up in paradise i believe i'm looking at some davids sure david did way worse of things than saul but but god just said he's a man after my own heart there's something about david that god loved hallelujah and in spite of david's failures and his successes and his humiliation amen god didn't change his mind about david god can't change his mind about his bride hallelujah oh my i'm circle ahead hallelujah hallelujah oh my do you know where you stand do you know that you're called of god that the holy ghost reigns in your heart does he reign this morning and every god word of god is real to you oh brother how is satan going to stand against that how is he going to stop that from growing amen how is he going to keep them down keep them signs from following it why you could throw them in jail they if you could i don't care what you do they done tried it they rotted in the jails they were fed to lions they were sawn us under they were jerked to pieces you can't kill it right a church that's predestinated those who he knew for knew like he did jesus he he has called those who he has called he has justified and those who he has justified he has already glorified pre-destinated hallelujah hallelujah he says now in the last days this is just continuing on with every seed sowed everything in order the world is in its order the time is shaped up the church is in its order we never thought we'd be living in this kind of time but this is the kind of time we're living in it's all in order nothing's out of cater oh i had these plans well god has plans hallelujah his plans are the best ones amen everything is in order that's why i say the bride is standing to attention here we are i've read my script what's your motivation they asked normally asked actors hey what's your what's my motivation i don't know if they still do that brother isaac can fill us in what's my motivation rapture hallelujah what's my motivation dancing on streets of gold what's my motivation seeing the devil cast in the lake of fire amen what's my motivation seeing a new jerusalem come down what's my motivation seeing the lord jesus face to face seeing the one who died for me holy that's my motivation hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen the church is in its order the seed the evening lights the signs like he said as it was in the days of sodom an angel of god the holy spirit coming down moving performing signs that he did then and he's still doing that today malachi 4 promised he would send it in the last days what he promised and we see all of that right here where where he says amen i mean i mean i mean amen do you love him amen sure right here in the last days a predestinated church knowing where they're standing sowed with the seed the holy spirit in the church satan be careful hallelujah remember assyria came against many other nations but they came against the wrong one they came against the wrong people because these people had more than an idol of stoner of water of gold or some tradition passed down or some system of church they had the true and living god they had god's chosen place of worship hallelujah they had the ark of the covenant they had god there on the scene holy they're the prophet i meant to to to speak through and you know what i love brother brahm says this here and if i can just find it maybe i'll just say it buddy but it's good if you you know if i put it up but he says that the prophet of the age is the holy ghost amen you see the holy ghost here's the prophet of the day what does that mean we throw away the prophet brother braham no no that's like the same you don't throw away the bible that's the word of god right but the prophet of the day is the holy ghost amy what does he do comes down into his church discerning the thoughts intents of the heart manifests himself through a body of people remember the son of man ministry wasn't just in the prophet it's in the bride hallelujah it's a continuation of the book of acts amen just as it was all in jesus one man then it went into a body of people and we've come back around the cycle again amen let the holy spirit search your conscience this is an invisible union after the seals and when brother brown was a prophet he said this i mean search your conscience and you'll agree with daniel 5 12 where the queen came in before belshazza and said she found out there was a prophet daniel who was among them and he was a dissolver of doubts you let the holy spirit hear the prophet of the day let him come into your heart right now and examine uh with the word of god and the doubts about the message will be all dissolved he dissolves all doubts you find out it's exactly on the word for this day what does it do make this puts this in its place as preeminence over the people that's what the message does hallelujah so here's the prophet of the day let the holy ghost come he'll dissolve all doubts am i gonna make it am i gonna you know there's a great fear in this day am i gonna keep my job you know there's meant to be like a w shaped recession that we're in or i don't know where we are in the first part of the w don't get me to draw it because i can't write very well but you know you know a double dipper you know recession so it puts a fear on people it puts an intimidation am i going to keep my job takes all security away and then people wonder if we're going to recession are they going to do like they did before where they use an excuse just to cut people yeah this is where we live right and so it puts a fear in people and then so now they're gonna oh i better just you know put up with you know because sometimes we have bosses that are real bad sometimes we just get put through unfair things sometimes we have great bosses i have a great boss and i've got the great boss too he's my boss but you know but but it puts a fear what what comes with intimidation fear fear of the uncertainty where the devil tries to paint a picture and this and this is the problem when when people project things like that sure it may happen but it puts a fear in people's minds most of us will be unemployed right recession brings unemployment well then what does that got then then how am i going to provide for my family what about my visa status how's this all going to happen it puts a fear but we are in a different economy the bride is in his economy he's in god's economy right david would say i've never seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread right and that was after many different he went through a lot of ups and downs ins and outs and finally he said that because he could look back at his life and said i've never seen i've never been forsaken amen so it depends how do you want your thinking to go because there's intimate there's a spirit of intimidation upon the people and fear right you have to think this kind of way but then god's here this morning saying no no no no think by the word amen think as the holy ghost thinks because we've got the mind of christ right amen hallelujah so here's hezekiah he doesn't know how this is going to go he goes to a source of strength he goes to the lord and he begins to tell tell the lord this is what's going on and then he sends his men to to to isaiah the prophet that's why i say we have a prophet today which is the holy ghost you got to go to the one that can speak to you and show you what to do and then now god speaks through isaiah the prophet speaks through the word and says he'll he he won't take the city he won't build any embankment or whatever he's going to return to his land because of a rumor and he'll die there and then the lord even seemed to blast through the host of the assyrians and killed i know what multitude of them and i and hezekiah did nothing to fight the battle physically but he fought it the right way he went to his source of strength and god came down see the problem is we try and fix it what a yo yo as i said a while ago what if he's a car consulted with his men of war they would afford a battle and they would have lost but he fought see we tried how can we fix this how can we keep it together how can we do this and this and this what's happening you're living under an intimidation because you're looking at physical circumstances but if you go to your source of strength he'll show you what to do and he won't only show you what to do he will fight your battle you know there's so many times we're in the ring with the devil fighting and the lord's on the ropes in your corner saying tag take me in tag me in i can take him tag me in and he and he's waiting he's waiting just tag but i know i've got this i can do this no no you're just like the disciples on the boat they were sailors they weren't a bunch of landlubbers happened to be on a boat going across the sea of galilee they they had done that from little boys and the wind begins to blow and the seas begin to go up and water begins to come into their boat and the reason that it got to such a death desperate state is because they believe they've got it because they're qualified but they came to the point but thankfully jesus was in the boat and brother bram even says even though you may not bring him with he's on the ramparts of glory looking down over you hallelujah so they finally got to a place because they realized because there comes a point you know there comes a point where you realize like i used to sail when i was young and there's times with there's a very thin line between flipping over and and keeping above the water stable sailing along and it comes like a split second now this is going to go bad but before that you realize no we're sweet and no doubt they came to that point and then they they stopped bailing out water they stop doing whatever they're trying to and they go wake the master he says don't you care that we perish and he's just asleep why didn't they wake him up when the first gus came across their bowel right why didn't they do that no because they thought we can handle this but they woke up the right one they didn't say okay how we're going to abandon ship boys another they woke up the master and that's what we're going to do many times wake up jesus wake up the word in your life amen don't let him slumber don't let him sleep mean wake him up say lord i'm in a desperate situation i need you to help me in this moment hallelujah and then he comes on the scene hallelujah amen the same one that said peace be still to the winds and the waves obey don't you think that he can speak to whatever's going on in your life do you think he can take control of your situation hallelujah because remember we don't have to put up with things oh god just letting character be formed sometimes it's just the devil trying to destroy us i mean sometimes just the devil trying to wipe us out hallelujah oh you just got to ride through this thing who said who said you know i like david his son with bathsheba was was was sick dying he prayed earnestly who knows the story so he didn't just he didn't he went to his source of strength right he went to a source of strength he didn't just sit there and say well i guess we just got to ride this out he interceded on behalf of his son right but even though the lord took the life of the child what did he do he washed himself went into the temple and worshiped god he didn't live in a pity party by himself amen he just worshipped the lord because he realized whatever happened to that child that was god's will and it may be a big thing to say but that's true everything that happens in our lives if we believe we're the predestinator bride of christ do you not think that monday's predestinated tuesday's predestinated i had a prang on my car predestinated i'm not feeling too well predestinated amen every part of your life is ordered our footsteps are ordered of the lord amen so he went to a source of strength i mean then god said all right let's just go to his um notice what he would say this is isaiah 37 3 i'll see if i can throw that up here 37-3 isaiah would say unto him the south hezekiah this is a day of trouble and of rebuke and a blasphemy and we are living now so he's under the effect of this intimidation but he goes to a source of strength as i say we're not immune from being intimidated by a demon power but he goes to a source of strength and this is how he's thinking now now notice this next part as well for the children i come to the birth and there is no and there is not strength to bring forth so now he's saying it's like now we're in a stalemate lord the enemy's around i see no way out it's like we've come to this climax of this situation but there's no strength just to do the final push and so this is what the devil tries to get us to think there's no way out of this we're stuck in this situation but notice he says that this is a day of trouble now david would say in in in psalms 27 in the time of trouble thou shalt hide me in the secret of thy pavilion and brother braham took psalm 27 and said this is the condition the world will be in and the bride will be in at the time of the rapture so we have to live in a time of trouble we have to live in in perilous times as we heard about on wednesday and you know we have to live in these because this is the condition the world will be in when we are translated shouldn't shouldn't that make us excited hallelujah but i don't want to be happy at trouble but this is just showing we would live in a day of trouble and of rebuke a rebuke is an expression of sharp disapproval or criticism and you don't have to go to someone's face to rebuke them now you just post something online right so we're living in a day of rebuke and a blasphemy what is the blasphemy of the assyrians that they would speak against hezekiah your god is like any other god you know what do they say about us today you're following a man let's just think about that for a second if people were actually honest they would acknowledge they are following somebody right the roman catholics today over a billion souls they follow a man called pope francis they're following a man right the different orthodox denominations they follow a patriarch of some description they're following a man the anglican church has the archbishop of canterbury they say he's the first among equals like the patriarchs are many orthodox denominations but he's still the head they're following a man if they were honest they would you know you're an honest anglican would say i follow the archbishop of canterbury because he's the head of their church oh no we're following jesus but you pay heed to what that man says you're following him the different branches of islam they have their great grand muftis and and ayatollahs you know which have various degrees of superiority and they're also following a man they say we follow the prophet muhammad the buddhists have the dalai lama two two two varying degrees i've just spoke about the vast majority of the seven billion souls upon the earth the atheists they follow darwin although follow richard dawkins or one of the great intellectual thinkers of the day why because they lit there because they let the teachings of those men be the greatest influence in their lives right it's it's it's the one that influences you the most is the one that you're being led by amen so some people unfortunately only follow william branham and they and and and and they get under a delusion where brother graham's told up in heaven all that ever loved you and your love will be there so they say oh i love the prophet therefore i'm going to heaven that that ain't going to cut it friends we go to heaven because we're under the blood filled with the holy ghost well it's not because we love a man that lived 50 60 years ago though we love the prophet right but but eliezer did not get rebecca to fall in love with him eliezer's job was to get rebecca to fall in love with isaac right and that's what the prophet's message came to do when you receive it in the right spirit you won't be caught up in the man you'll be caught up in the lord jesus christ the one that the man pointed you to amen but if people say oh you're following a man well i'll okay then this is written by how many authors about 16 right so so if if i'm a new testament christian i'm following the apostle paul i'm following peter james and john i'm following timothy i'm whoever wrote a book i'm following moses because i believe moses words right i believe all the all the writers so i'm following them yeah if i'm honest so why is it crazy to say i follow i believe a prophet's message oh you're following a man well everyone else's i'd rather i'd rather follow a vindicated prophet that people said they saw jesus in him you know i heard um someone speaking about you know when brother brown was about to go to israel because um because israel believes their prophets and and i think it was louis petras i think it was who was a great leader of you know the pentecostal movement in in europe he had a million bibles printed in i think in hebrew and sent there before brother brown was going now you think about it this is at the height of the healing revival why did they not get someone else to go to show them jesus christ why they pick out him because they saw the sign of the messiah they saw more than a healing gift they saw jesus christ living in a man so i think i'll take him above someone's opinion or or some critics idea hey man that's just me so you know they say you're just following a man like anyone else you know and i didn't cover the mormons or but you know i'm pretty sure you can agree i've covered most of the seven billion souls on the earth they follow someone amen so you see the intimidation there is a subtle intimidation today which is actually quite real it's either agree with the majority or you'll be boycotted you'll be cancelled and brother brown said i don't have the quotes on me but he says he'll come a boycott which is the marking of the beast you can't buy or sell and here we are yes we're living in this hour amen but we need to be like the disciples amen after their great threatenings now here was here we are back with the formerly crippled lame man who's now a piece of evidence in a court trial his life has been changed forever and then they and then they now now this is just me but after this where they're told that you know they must never preach in his name again because the man who's over 40 was there i believe he went with him into a prayer meeting remember he found himself caught up in this great clash remember when we first meet the lord everything is wonderful the sky is bluer the grass is greener the flowers are more flowerier you know everything's lovely you know because you just get saved he becomes real your sins are all washed away everyone's awesome everything is awesome this is how he was i was sitting here you know it's amazing he got carried to that spot no doubt he walked past that spot imagine that feeling he yeah he got carried to the gate beautiful he runs through the gate and maybe he walks back through the gate and then every time he'd walk past that he say i used to sit here i sat here that was my seat you see how those stones are slightly there's an indentation i made that indentation that was me you see that drinking problem i used to have that drinking problem you see that last problem i had that you see this this is where i used to sit i mean this this pride is where i used to sit i used to think i was the bee's knees is where i used to sit but then one day one day the lord came my way i said silver and gold have a number such as i have give i unto thee in the name of jesus christ raise up and walk and i went walking and leaping and praising god hallelujah glory and so here he was everything's awesome and he's brought into this court trial any any and then no doubt humanly say i'm part of this i'm not a spectator i'm actually the the evidence i'm the reason these guys are mad he's not just watching i'm the reason these guys are mad why does the devil get mad because god works in your life hallelujah we are living evidence and i'll try and wrap up with this you know so here he is and then now he's got a but now this is pressure come on what are we going to do and they said we're just going to serve god then they went to their source of strength and they began to pray they told the disciples they told the church this is just what happened to us oh praise the lord that man's walking here he is and he began to meet people he'd never seen before maybe and he finds now they begin to pray and call on god and say why do the heathen rage and you know people imagine a vain thing and all those things and as the people praying one heart one mind one accord the holy ghost came back down and refilled them and now this man that was just crippled and he felt the power of god strengthen his legs now that power that healed him now came and lived on the inside of him hallelujah now now this is just me hallelujah so now now he's there in this prayer meeting and the intimidation he was feeling in the trial vanished why because because they just god just proved i'm in this i'm in this i meant what you're doing you're actually a witness of me hallelujah hallelujah and that's why we need to go to our source of our strength holly and go to god say god i have trouble he's a car said this is a time of trouble a day of trouble holy but he went to the source of his strength and god came down and met his need hallelujah and we are in the same position this morning highly we are i believe we're living in the fountain hall i believe we're living in his presence right now i mean i believe this is not just human excitement but god's here guys here to take away all the all the worry all the fear all the feeling of intimidation if you just open your heart say god i'm your child the enemy is doing a lot of things against me but lord your presence holy lord will you meet my need this hour hallelujah i believe he will don't you amen but what we need today is another refilling another like the disciples remember if we are a book of acts church hello book of acts church this is how they overcame they got back to their source of strength they got refilled with the holy ghost remember this is not them getting saved all over again hey if you're sealed in you're sealed in hallelujah amen so you know so this is not them oh lord i need salvation again no no they went to their source of strength that god would empower them and to break any hold of fear and intimidation that the devil had if the devil whispers an arrow even shouts you'll never overcome this you'll never get well this is just how it has to be who said who said you just got to put up with us all the lord just put this on me to keep me humble who said we don't have to live with the devil we don't have to live with we don't have to live with them bombarding our minds and crippling us down who said right they went to there now now ask the question did this prayer meeting take away the scribes and pharisees in the high priest so the threat was still there but its influence died amen hallelujah and and and this is i i pray god just fill us now amen i mean because remember the world is not going anywhere yet i mean but its influence upon us can die amen the worry the fear whatever may you may be facing don't fear little flock holy god is in control amen hallelujah all right hallelujah amen maybe let's just stand to our feet shall we can we have the musicians to come forward amen hallelujah amen our god is present amen he helped hezekiah he'll help you amen he helped the disciples he'll help you he'll fight your battle don't listen to what the devil says do we know where we're standing in this hour where we're standing right now oh but i think so love myself the devil tells me this and this but what has god declared amen that's the thing that matters amen hallelujah amen i just want to listen i just want to sing there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins shall we just sing that this morning
