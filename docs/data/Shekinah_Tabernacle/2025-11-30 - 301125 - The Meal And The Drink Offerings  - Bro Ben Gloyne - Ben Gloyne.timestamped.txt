[4:40] Hey, heat. Hey, heat.
[5:06] &gt;&gt; [music]
[5:10] &gt;&gt; Good morning. God bless you all. Welcome
[5:13] to the house of God.
[5:15] How you all feeling? Nice. Excited about
[5:18] the new what? Are you excited about what
[5:20] the new day is about to bring?
[5:23] I'm sure there's a verse that says the
[5:25] about the steadfast love of the Lord
[5:27] never ceases. That his mercies his love
[5:30] and his mercy is new every morning. So
[5:32] every morning you wake up, you get a you
[5:33] get a new opportunity to experience the
[5:35] love and the mercy of God. Amen. It's
[5:38] good to [music] be a Christian. It's
[5:39] good to be alive. I was just thinking
[5:42] before like
[5:44] humans I've always had this a high
[5:46] belief in mankind that humans have uh
[5:50] God made humans very intelligent very
[5:52] smart and we we can adapt you know we
[5:55] [music] can get thrown into a situation
[5:56] and then we get startled for a bit then
[5:58] we adapt and we can make we we just make
[6:00] stuff work
[6:01] usually that's why we that's why we're
[6:03] all still alive in this world cuz we
[6:05] just make things work somehow you know
[6:07] and humans survive in the most remote
[6:09] places where they shouldn't survive They
[6:10] just make it work and they live there.
[6:12] Guys live on ice or they live on sand,
[6:15] you know, and they they're still alive.
[6:17] But, you know, I'm thinking about this.
[6:19] I'm I'm sort of getting the hang of I'm
[6:21] getting like my little spaces to live
[6:23] sort of like [music] uh a bit impaired.
[6:25] Like I'm like I put my crutches up
[6:27] there. I'm like, "Oh, there's my new
[6:28] crutches spot." You know, and then
[6:30] here's all these little spots. Here's my
[6:31] little thing. you know, we we adapt and
[6:33] we we just get used to living like that,
[6:37] which is a good strength of humans, but
[6:41] it does have its downside if you think
[6:42] about certain things like a brother
[6:45] preached a sermon once it was called
[6:46] learning to live in the dark, you know,
[6:48] cuz when the darkness comes, you're at
[6:50] first you think, "Wow, I can't see
[6:51] anything. This is not good or whatever
[6:53] it might be." But then your eyes adjust
[6:54] and then you can start to function
[6:56] living in the dark. And you know, it's
[6:58] the same in our Christian walk. We we
[7:00] got to watch that Satan doesn't lump
[7:02] something on us and then we just start
[7:03] to accept it and we start to accept that
[7:06] something negative or some complex or
[7:07] something is well I'll just live with
[7:09] this because we can just adapt and live
[7:11] with it like you know I don't want to
[7:13] live with this you know I don't want the
[7:14] I'm not going to adapt to this new
[7:16] normal it's not going to be the new
[7:17] normal and in our Christian walk we
[7:19] don't want to we got to I think we got
[7:20] to check our lives every now and then
[7:21] and just check that we're not adapting
[7:23] to some complex and thinking oh well
[7:24] this is just the way it's going to be
[7:25] and I'll just adjust and I'll adapt my
[7:27] life and I'll just live with this thing
[7:29] even though it hinders me. I'll just
[7:31] figure out a way to make it work and
[7:32] we'll [music] go with that. We We don't
[7:34] want to learn how to live in the dark.
[7:36] We want to live in the light. Amen.
[7:38] Let's stand this morning. But we I thank
[7:40] the Lord that we serve a God that can
[7:43] remind us and show us and he if we're
[7:45] stuck in something, he can show us the
[7:46] way out. He always gives us the way out.
[7:48] So, let's just pray this morning.
[7:49] Heavenly Father, we're so grateful that
[7:50] we can come to the God, Lord, that
[7:52] cares, that understands, Lord, that
[7:54] knows us intricately.
[7:56] And often there's many times that we
[7:58] might even forget. yet we might start to
[8:00] be living under certain things and not
[8:02] even realize that we are, Lord. But I
[8:03] thank you, Lord, that that you're the
[8:05] great builder, Lord, that you're the
[8:06] you're the you're the master builder,
[8:07] that you you know what's going on in our
[8:09] life, Lord. And and the more we
[8:10] surrender it to you, the more you just
[8:12] work on us and you you work on these
[8:14] different areas of our life, Lord. And
[8:15] may may we not adapt and live under
[8:18] anything that Satan's put on us, Lord.
[8:20] May you show us what those things are
[8:22] and we want to break free of anything
[8:23] Lord that's hindering us that's from
[8:25] [music] fulfilling our our purpose or
[8:28] being 100% of who who you've made us
[8:29] Lord Jesus. So I just want to pray you
[8:31] bless the service this morning where you
[8:32] may you minister in a powerful way.
[8:34] Bless the word bless the songs Lord as
[8:36] [music] we enter into your courts with
[8:39] praise Lord and thanksgiving Lord and we
[8:41] want to go to the battle with praise and
[8:43] with worship Lord and may may you um
[8:46] [music] accept the worship of our heart
[8:48] this morning. Not not our lips, Lord,
[8:49] but it comes from a I believe each one
[8:51] here a pure heart that loves you, Lord.
[8:54] And just bless the word. May there be a
[8:55] powerful anointing, Lord. And we receive
[8:57] it as from you this morning. May you
[8:59] just um minister in a powerful way. We
[9:00] just pray and commit the service to your
[9:01] hands in Jesus wonderful name. Amen.

[42:27] Let's um let's uh read from Joel chapter
[42:30] 1. Sorry about that technical glitch. Uh
[42:33] so Joel 1, I'm going to read verses
[42:35] 12-13. Then we're going to go to 2
[42:37] Samuel 23.
[42:40] So Joel 1. And if you're there, if you
[42:42] say amen. Amen. So it says here, "Now
[42:45] the vine is dried up and the fig tree
[42:47] languisheth. The pomegranate tree, the
[42:50] palm tree also, and the apple tree. Even
[42:52] all the trees of the field are withered
[42:54] because joy is withered away from the
[42:57] sons of men. Gird yourselves and lament
[43:00] ye priests. Howl, ye ministers of the
[43:02] altar. Come lie all night on uh in
[43:04] sackcloth, ye ministers of my God. For
[43:06] the meat offering and the drink offering
[43:08] is withholden from the house of your
[43:11] God. Amen. And then we're going to go to
[43:14] 2 Samuel uh chapter 23 14-17
[43:19] which which is David's mighty men here.
[43:22] And so verse I'm just make sure I'm in
[43:25] the right place. So so 2 Samuel there 23
[43:28] and4 it says and David was then in an
[43:32] hold and the garrison of the Philistines
[43:34] was then in Bethlehem. And David longed
[43:37] and said oh that one would give me a
[43:38] drink of the water of the well of
[43:40] Bethlehem which is by the gate. And the
[43:42] three mighty men break through the host
[43:44] of the Philistines, and drew water out
[43:46] of the well of Bethlehem that was by the
[43:49] gate, and took it, and brought it to
[43:51] David. Nevertheless, he would not drink
[43:53] thereof, but poured it out unto the
[43:55] Lord. And he said, "Be it far from me,
[43:58] oh Lord, that I should do this. Is not
[44:00] this the blood of the men uh that went
[44:03] in jeopardy of their lives? Therefore,
[44:05] he would not drink it. These things did
[44:08] these uh these things did these three
[44:11] mighty men. Amen. Let's bow our heads in
[44:13] a word of prayer. If you want to be it's
[44:15] me, oh Lord, standing in need of prayer.
[44:16] You want to slip your hand up, say,
[44:17] "Lord, truly I need you to pass my way
[44:19] this morning." Amen. Gracious heavenly
[44:22] father, we thank you, dear God. We can
[44:23] gather in this way. Lord, as a people,
[44:25] Lord, under your blood, Lord, we can
[44:27] praise you, give you glory. And Father,
[44:29] as we stand here, Lord, take control of
[44:31] every life, Lord. We surrender all that
[44:33] we are, body, soul, and spirit, dear
[44:35] God, into your divine hands. That you
[44:37] would speak, Lord. You could you would
[44:38] hear through us, Lord. That you give us
[44:40] hearts to receive, dear God. That
[44:42] Father, your your word would come forth,
[44:44] Lord God, and speak to every life. Cast
[44:46] out every enemy. Defeat the evil one in
[44:48] our midst. Oh God. May you change our
[44:50] lives, change our thinking, change our
[44:52] attitudes, dear God. Heal the sick among
[44:54] us, dear God. Those not not just here,
[44:56] but those who are streaming. Lord, be
[44:57] everyone's abundant portion. We commit
[44:59] our lives into your hands. We thank you
[45:01] for this opportunity once more in Jesus
[45:03] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you
[45:06] friends. You can uh have your seats this
[45:08] morning. So I want to speak about see um
[45:12] I want to speak about the meal and the
[45:13] drink offering. Now uh this this
[45:16] scripture here um we can look at it as a
[45:20] uh I want to take the opposite of this
[45:22] scripture. Okay. So because Joel here um
[45:26] Joel was speaking before this of a
[45:29] promised restoration, a restoration of
[45:31] all things, a restoration of the gospel,
[45:33] a restoration of the bride tree. I mean
[45:36] this is before now. Now now he was
[45:37] looking at prophecy that these things
[45:39] were missing out of the church. But but
[45:41] then in Joel chapter 2, he says, "I will
[45:43] restore, sayeth the Lord." And I want to
[45:45] declare to you this morning, God has
[45:47] restored. Amen. Through the message of
[45:49] the hour. So we're not so we're on the
[45:51] other side of the scripture. Now, if you
[45:53] don't have these things in your life,
[45:54] you need to say, "God, fill me with the
[45:56] Holy Ghost." I mean, because these
[45:58] offerings that were withholden, you
[46:00] know, you know, I read the scripture,
[46:02] you know, you know, I see these things
[46:03] and and I think, I wonder why God
[46:05] mentions these two offerings, right?
[46:08] Then, you know, because God is
[46:09] deliberate. God is intentional with his
[46:11] words. He doesn't just say things
[46:13] without meaning or significance. Because
[46:15] we understand there's more than just two
[46:17] offerings that the priest would give.
[46:18] There's the there's a sin offering.
[46:20] There's an offering for ignorance.
[46:21] There's the, you know, there's the
[46:23] atonement, there's the peace offering.
[46:24] There's all these different offerings
[46:25] that would happen in the Old Testament.
[46:27] But here in Joel, he just, you know, he
[46:30] just he just points out two that are not
[46:32] in the house of the Lord, which is the
[46:34] which is the meat offering or the meal
[46:36] offering um and the drink offering. So,
[46:39] we want to we want to look into these
[46:41] things this morning. But, you know, I
[46:42] want to announce to you that through the
[46:43] message of the hour, these things are in
[46:46] the church. Amen. These are in the
[46:48] bride. Now when he talks about the house
[46:50] of your God, I want to say well the true
[46:52] house of your God is you. Amen. So these
[46:54] things are not just on a church level
[46:56] though we could go that way or age level
[46:58] but I want to talk about personally to
[47:00] you. I mean I want to have a
[47:01] conversation with you and see how are
[47:03] you doing this morning? How's things you
[47:04] know how's your walk and how's your
[47:06] victory and you know in spite of what
[47:08] you're going through that's actually a
[47:10] relevant. How are you doing in the
[47:11] trial? How are you doing? It's a it's a
[47:13] victorious walk remember there's batters
[47:15] and battered you know you get battered
[47:17] and bruised and whatever more but it is
[47:18] victorious now I I find it you know so
[47:21] so we have been restored so the message
[47:24] of the hour restores us back to the full
[47:26] power of Pentecost and it restores us
[47:28] back to Paul's gospel right so
[47:31] everything that was had the church the
[47:33] church had in in the original we have
[47:35] been restored to so we're not just
[47:37] restored to the spirit but we're
[47:39] restored to the word now brother said
[47:41] that there's the fundamentalist that
[47:42] know who they are in the scripture, but
[47:44] they have no power. It's like they got
[47:45] no money in the bank. Amen. And there's
[47:47] those who have the spirit. They've got
[47:48] all the money in the bank, but they have
[47:50] no way to actually put it into being.
[47:52] Right? He says, if we could just get
[47:53] those two together, then I'll show you a
[47:55] church that's really on fire for God. I
[47:57] just want to tell you, we have been
[47:59] restored to that. Amen. We have all the
[48:01] money in the bank. We know who we are,
[48:03] right? And we have the faith to draw it
[48:04] out and put it into being. Amen. So, we
[48:07] have both the mechanics and the
[48:08] dynamics. We have been restored back to
[48:11] Paul's gospel with the power. Now
[48:13] remember Paul said, "I didn't come to
[48:15] you in word only, but in power and
[48:17] demonstration of the Holy Ghost." So
[48:19] it's not just vain empty words of a dead
[48:21] letter, a dead sermon. No, this is a
[48:23] living word. Amen. There's a living
[48:24] gospel. Amen. That comes with power.
[48:26] Power to overcome, power to cast out the
[48:29] enemy, power to bring joy, power to
[48:31] bring peace, power to bring healing,
[48:33] amen, power to bring deliverance. It's
[48:35] all in the word. And we have been
[48:36] restored back. Amen. To that word.
[48:39] Praise the Lord. So I want to take the
[48:41] opposite of the scripture.
[48:43] Amen. But you see now there's a big, you
[48:45] see, see joy joy is very important. It's
[48:48] more than just being happy. Let's just
[48:50] break this down a little bit. Let's just
[48:51] let's just wait. Well, it should be on
[48:53] here somewhere. See, he says he says the
[48:55] all the all the fruit has is is
[48:58] withered. The fig tree languageth all
[49:00] these things because the joy because joy
[49:03] is withered away from the sons of men.
[49:06] If there ever was a people that should
[49:08] be full of joy to overflowing, it should
[49:10] be you and I. Amen. Because we know
[49:13] where we're going. We know in whom we
[49:15] have believed. Amen. We know what he's
[49:17] done in our lives. Amen. We know he
[49:18] saved us from hell. We know he saved us
[49:20] from sin. We know he's delivered us from
[49:22] all things of the enemy. Amen. I think
[49:24] if there's a people that should be
[49:25] happy, it should be you and I. Oh, you
[49:28] don't know what I'm going through. But
[49:29] you should look at what Jesus has gone
[49:31] through for you already. What he's
[49:33] already done to your life. Amen. Done to
[49:34] your soul. I think that should put a
[49:36] joy, a joy in our step. Amen. Amen.
[49:39] Because we to realize the joy of the
[49:40] Lord is our strength. Amen. And we
[49:43] should, you know, we come to church to
[49:45] worship God.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Right. Every day of our life should be a
[49:48] worship. We don't And what you put the
[49:50] the main thing that influences you in
[49:52] your life is what you're worshiping.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:55] So if you got a complex and it and that
[49:58] directs your life, that's your God. If
[50:00] you've got unforgiveness and that
[50:01] directs your life, well, I can't speak
[50:03] to that person, this person, and this
[50:04] and all these things, that's actually
[50:06] your God.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you if you are offended by
[50:09] someone, you hold that offense and you
[50:11] put that more important than the word of
[50:12] God, that's your God. But I believe I'm
[50:14] looking at a people that will not let
[50:16] anything take God's place in their life.
[50:18] I mean, they want the word of God to
[50:20] have preeminence. Amen. in spite of all
[50:22] things. Amen. They will worship and love
[50:24] the Lord. So, you may have had the worst
[50:25] morning this morning. Put that to one
[50:27] side. We're here to worship God. We're
[50:29] here to express back to God what he's
[50:31] done for us with thanksgiving. Amen. And
[50:33] this joy that's come into our hearts is
[50:35] because of revelation. It's not because
[50:37] of it's it's more than an emotion. It's
[50:39] more than a nice idea. It's revelation.
[50:41] That's why I have the joy of the Lord
[50:44] because he's revealed to me that Calvary
[50:45] was for me. He's revealed to me the
[50:47] rapture is for me. He's revealed to me
[50:49] every divine promise in his word is
[50:51] mine. Amen. So I've got the joy cuz he
[50:53] said it's yours. Amen. Hallelujah. And
[50:55] if he's given it to me, I say, "Praise
[50:57] you. Thank you, Lord. I'm your child and
[50:59] I can just walk on and be happy."
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, but but but I'm going through bad
[51:03] things. Just put everything in
[51:05] perspective. You have eternal life.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; You You got a good deal.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's traded be Yeah. beauty for
[51:13] ashes, the oil of joy for mourning.
[51:15] Amen. you once morning, but I trust you
[51:17] got the your oil of joy this morning.
[51:19] Amen. You can rejoice and shout and
[51:21] praise God and have liberty. Amen. Who
[51:23] cares about the critics? They're called
[51:25] to do what they'll do.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to be a critic. My position
[51:29] in the word is not to be a critic. My
[51:31] position in the word is to be a
[51:33] worshshiper. Amen. To praise God, to
[51:35] give him glory. That's my position in
[51:37] the scripture.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, joy is more than just being
[51:42] happy. as I said is David would say in
[51:45] Psalms wait um here we'll we'll come
[51:49] back to that Psalms 51 this is after he
[51:52] has taken Bashibba and and we know it
[51:54] was about 2 years after he did that had
[51:56] Uriah killed all those things committed
[51:58] adultery with Bashibba that that Nathan
[52:01] the prophet came and exposed David's
[52:03] life and so he would write this psalm
[52:06] after that had taken place and he said
[52:07] restore unto me the joy of thy salvation
[52:10] and uphold me with thy free spirit You
[52:13] see, he hadn't lost his salvation. The
[52:15] prophet teaches he lost the joy of it.
[52:18] Amen. And remember, this is the joy of
[52:19] God's salvation. God's salvation is
[52:22] permanent. It's eternal. If you're
[52:24] really saved, you're really saved. If
[52:26] you're sealed to the day of your
[52:27] redemption, you're sealed to the day of
[52:29] your redemption. And no devil in hell
[52:30] can break that seal. Amen. Cuz God put
[52:32] it on there. What God puts on, he
[52:34] nothing can take it off. Amen. Cuz he's
[52:36] the strongest one. Amen. So his seal
[52:38] stands. It holds like Kyra digs you
[52:40] would do at a camp. do this. It's
[52:43] sealed.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. You could be a vessel that's been
[52:46] kicked around.
[52:49] Oh,
[52:50] there you go. Hey, sometimes. Yeah.
[52:52] Thank you so much for that. But you
[52:54] know, but you see the seal holds, right?
[52:56] I could No, we won't do that. [laughter]
[53:00] We're not playing catch. But just to
[53:01] illustrate, right, that this was
[53:03] dropped. It was thrown around. It was
[53:06] pushed down. Pushed, you know, all that
[53:09] kind of stuff. Put it into different
[53:10] hands. thrown around, but the seal held.
[53:13] And you may go from depression to
[53:14] hardship to heartache to problems being
[53:16] thrown around, maybe in your mind to
[53:18] whole different things. But if you got a
[53:20] seal of God in your soul, I mean, the
[53:22] seal holds in spite of what's going on
[53:24] in your spirit realm. Hallelujah. You're
[53:26] going to realize, I'm going through a
[53:27] bad thing, but I'm sealed in my soul. I
[53:29] mean, I'm safe and secure because I'm
[53:31] part of God.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, so David's joy had
[53:35] to be restored. And you know what
[53:37] happened is he got into this spot
[53:38] because instead of him fulfilling God's
[53:41] purpose for his life, he decided, I'm
[53:43] just going to sit home and be a selfish
[53:44] believer.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; And if you sit home, you can be, we say,
[53:47] "I'm at church now." You can be sitting
[53:49] at home in church.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Bless me, preacher. Bless me, singer.
[53:53] I'm not going to be part of the service.
[53:55] I'm just going to be watching. We're not
[53:57] here to sit here and eat some popcorn
[53:59] and watch what's going on. We're here to
[54:01] be part of the service. You're you're as
[54:03] important in this service as I am. Or
[54:06] the musicians or the deacons or the
[54:08] Sunday school teachers, you're just as
[54:10] important in this service that I am.
[54:12] Amen. Cuz we're here to create an
[54:13] atmosphere. Amen. Where where God would
[54:16] inspire me and he would inspire you.
[54:18] Amen. Where worship, See, do you know
[54:19] why I preach? It's a worship to God.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; This is why I preach it. So, sure, it
[54:24] feeds you, but it's really a worship
[54:26] that I get a chance to stand here for
[54:27] about an hour and express back to God
[54:29] what he means to me.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and what you mean to me and
[54:32] what you mean to God. So, I'm here
[54:34] actually I'm just going to worship for
[54:35] an hour. You can join in if you want.
[54:37] Amen. We can all be part of it together.
[54:39] Hallelujah.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; But you see, you see, you know, David,
[54:42] he would sit home when his men were
[54:44] fighting and and and he he he stopped
[54:46] fulfilling what God would have him to do
[54:48] because he was anointed. He was called.
[54:51] He was he was he was put forth that God
[54:54] would through David would they would
[54:56] possess the entire promised land. But he
[54:59] got to a spot and said, "I'm just going
[55:00] to stay home." What did he do? He became
[55:02] selfish. He looked out his window and he
[55:06] saw some something someone Bashibba that
[55:08] wasn't his, but he was selfish. I want
[55:10] her. And this is what happens when
[55:12] people they lose their purpose. They
[55:14] lose their focus of life. They just
[55:16] become to be selfish. Well, that's not
[55:17] right. And this is wrong and I want this
[55:18] and what can I get out of it?
[55:21] We don't want to get in that position.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Right? But you see, this is what
[55:26] happened. his joy, the joy of his
[55:29] salvation withered away.
[55:32] But then God restored that joy. And you
[55:34] say, "Well, I don't have that joy I once
[55:36] had." You can get it back.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I'm older now. My kids are
[55:40] older, or now I'm a gr, you know, every
[55:42] station of life. Doesn't matter if
[55:44] you're a kid that's carefree, a teenager
[55:46] trying to find your way in the world.
[55:49] adult, single, married, you know,
[55:51] married couple, married with kids,
[55:53] married with babies, married with
[55:55] toddlers, married with teenagers,
[55:56] married with adult kids. You're a
[55:58] grandparent. Doesn't matter what stage
[56:00] of life you are. Amen. The joy of the
[56:02] Lord transcends every circumstance you
[56:05] find yourself in. Amen. Our joy is not
[56:07] based on what we're going through. It's
[56:09] not based on our bank account. It's not
[56:11] based on our health. It's not based on
[56:13] our whatever you think that it should be
[56:15] based on. This is upon revelation. Amen.
[56:18] God has saved me. He sealed me. He sent
[56:20] me his word. Amen. His covenant angel.
[56:23] He He himself has come and confirmed his
[56:26] covenant with me. Amen. That should make
[56:28] me happy.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You say, "Well, I just
[56:31] don't feel I'm just in a different
[56:32] stage." No, we should actually be more
[56:35] more joyful
[56:36] &gt;&gt; as we go along because as we go along,
[56:38] God unveils more of himself personally
[56:40] to us.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:43] But you see, it's important that we have
[56:45] the joy of the Lord's salvation because
[56:46] he says, "Then will I teach
[56:49] transgressors thy way, and sinners shall
[56:51] be converted unto thee."
[56:52] &gt;&gt; So if you want to see people converted,
[56:54] have the joy of the Lord's salvation in
[56:56] you. It's more than doctrine, more than
[56:58] just an argument, more than a nice, you
[57:00] know, kind of, well, this is just how it
[57:02] is. You got to have something that's
[57:03] real. People aren't looking for an
[57:05] argument. The world's full of it. Amen.
[57:06] They're looking for real life. They're
[57:08] looking for the love of God. How rich
[57:09] and pure. Amen. And where's where are
[57:12] they going to see it? In you.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you want to see people
[57:15] saved, be happy about what you got. I've
[57:19] never seen someone try and sell a
[57:20] product and they're successful and
[57:22] they're really unhappy. I remember going
[57:23] to the donut there was a doughut king in
[57:25] Wellington airport all these donuts and
[57:27] I I asked the lady behind the counter,
[57:29] well- which is your favorite donut? And
[57:32] she said, I don't like donuts.
[57:34] That's what she said straight. I'm like
[57:36] I just thinking, why are you working
[57:38] here then? If you don't like what you're
[57:40] selling, go find something you like
[57:41] selling. You'll enjoy You'll enjoy your
[57:44] job a lot more. Imagine going to a
[57:46] place. I hate this place. I hate the
[57:47] donut. I don't like donuts. You know,
[57:50] [laughter]
[57:51] I'm just trapped.
[57:54] Get [snorts] happy about life, man. We
[57:56] God wants us to be happy.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want us to be sad and frowny
[58:00] and I'm I'm just being pious. No, I
[58:03] think you gone a bit moldy and a bit
[58:04] off. You know, you do get a bit of life
[58:05] about you. Get a bit happy. Amen. So
[58:08] anyway, I bought a donut, but I thought
[58:09] I'm not going to ask you again.
[58:12] [snorts] It can be like someone who's
[58:14] not free to talk about the Lord. You
[58:15] know, someone asks you about God and you
[58:18] can't really answer. It's like, oh wow,
[58:20] that person's not happy with what you
[58:21] know what's wrong with them.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; You know, it should be actually, man,
[58:25] what have they got?
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Man, if they're happy about it, they
[58:28] just light up and praise the Lord and
[58:30] they begin to share things and you
[58:32] think, man, that at least that person's
[58:33] got something that's heartfelt religion.
[58:35] Don't you want that? We're not meant to
[58:37] have headfilled religion, it's heartfelt
[58:39] religion. Amen. That's what brother Bram
[58:41] said it was. Right. So, Amen. So, if you
[58:43] want if you want people to be if you
[58:46] want people to be uh have saved, Amen.
[58:50] be happy with what you got.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But you see now when
[58:56] when he says about there's fruit that's
[58:57] withered and so on, a main a main
[59:00] problem with a you know in a natural
[59:02] tree is that is that uh that tree has a
[59:04] lack of moisture. It's a dry spell. It's
[59:07] not getting it's not getting the water
[59:09] it needs. The fruit withers. I want to
[59:11] say this that we are we are not we are
[59:13] not planted in a dry place. I'm talking
[59:16] about being you being planted in Christ.
[59:18] That is not a dry place. That is not a
[59:20] desert place. That's not some blasting
[59:23] wilderness where nothing can grow. No,
[59:25] it is it is a place of bountiful water.
[59:28] Amen. And we don't need to be careful
[59:30] that the aquafare aquifer is going to
[59:32] run dry. This can never run dry. Amen.
[59:34] being planted by rivers of living water.
[59:37] Amen. This is where you're planted. So,
[59:38] I tell you what, friends, there's
[59:40] something within us that we cannot
[59:41] wither.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's something within the
[59:45] believer now. You got this inexhaustible
[59:47] fountain. Now, it's more than how you
[59:48] feel, right? The fruits of the spirit
[59:50] are more than how you feel. It's the
[59:52] life of God being produced. But I tell
[59:54] you what, we're not This message is not
[59:56] a dry message. It's not a dead message.
[59:59] It's not an intellectual message. It's a
[1:00:01] living message. He's a living word.
[1:00:03] because this message is Jesus Christ
[1:00:05] revealed. Amen. So we we we are not
[1:00:08] planted by a dry place. He says,
[1:00:10] "Blessed is the man that walketh not in
[1:00:12] the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth
[1:00:15] in the way of sinners, nor siteth in the
[1:00:17] seat of the scornful." So you're blessed
[1:00:18] if you're not in any of those places.
[1:00:20] But his delight is in the law of the
[1:00:22] Lord, and in his law does he meditate
[1:00:24] day and night. Amen. So if you've got a
[1:00:27] delight, you ought to have a delight for
[1:00:28] the word.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; It's very important. You should be
[1:00:31] enjoying what you're experiencing. You
[1:00:34] should be enjoying the word of the Lord.
[1:00:36] Doesn't matter what you're going
[1:00:37] through. Your source of comfort should
[1:00:39] not be doom scrolling. Your source of
[1:00:41] comfort should be the word of God. Amen.
[1:00:43] I tell you what, you know, we all have a
[1:00:45] spiritual appetite. The world has a
[1:00:47] spiritual appetite. Right? They they
[1:00:50] fill their spirit up on all kinds of
[1:00:51] things. I tell you what, if you're
[1:00:53] feeling withered and dry and, you know,
[1:00:55] cold and different, I say change your
[1:00:57] appetite.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Change it to the right kind of
[1:01:00] music. change it to the, you know,
[1:01:02] there's multitudes of sermons online
[1:01:03] that you can be very blessed by. You
[1:01:05] say, you know, even if you think, well,
[1:01:07] I don't know what to listen to, I can
[1:01:08] send you a whole bunch.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; I'm happy to send them out. I'm really
[1:01:12] happy about it. Right. So, if you're
[1:01:13] wondering, man, where should I start
[1:01:14] eating? I'll say, well, start here. This
[1:01:16] is a real good entree. Now, here's some
[1:01:18] mans. And actually, I believe in we
[1:01:20] should have dessert first cuz that's I'm
[1:01:22] a sweet, too. So, you can have this.
[1:01:24] It's real sweet. Amen.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; I think we should do that.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Check what your
[1:01:30] spiritual diet is.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we have been planted as as as
[1:01:35] brother Brown would preach from this
[1:01:37] message, the restoration of the bride
[1:01:38] tree. Tell we have been restored.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; We are placed in a good place. Amen.
[1:01:43] Where the fruit of the spirit is living.
[1:01:45] Amen. We have we have living water.
[1:01:47] Amen. So, we're not living in a place, a
[1:01:49] believer is not living in a place where
[1:01:50] they where they are dried up. I'm just
[1:01:53] trying to find where I should be now.
[1:01:56] You [snorts] say, you know, speaking go,
[1:01:58] you know, you know, just going back to
[1:01:59] David, I just want to put this point in
[1:02:00] here because many people they they think
[1:02:03] once I find my position in the body,
[1:02:05] then I can really worship. Then I can
[1:02:07] really have my purpose. You know what
[1:02:09] we're called to do first and foremost?
[1:02:12] We're called to be a worshshiper.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Well, I'm not a I don't
[1:02:15] know if I'm a preacher or a deacon, a
[1:02:17] song leader, a musician, or what what."
[1:02:19] No, you don't need to worry about that.
[1:02:21] You're a worshshiper first and foremost.
[1:02:22] That's why I said a while ago, I this is
[1:02:24] actually me worshiping God.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Right? But before I did it here, I did
[1:02:28] it there.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so it doesn't really matter.
[1:02:31] You say, I don't know what my purpose is
[1:02:32] in the body. You're here to worship God.
[1:02:34] You're here to be a worshiper. How you
[1:02:36] treat one another should be a worship.
[1:02:37] How you treat those lost on the street
[1:02:39] should be a worship. How you treat your
[1:02:40] family should be a worship. That you
[1:02:42] should give them honor and respect and
[1:02:44] love and care, that's actually a worship
[1:02:45] because you're doing it as unto the
[1:02:47] Lord.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what we should do. So
[1:02:51] David, David lost his purpose. But I
[1:02:53] tell you what, friends, we're being
[1:02:54] restored back to what our purpose should
[1:02:56] be.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Remember, God inhabits the praises of
[1:02:59] his people.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; So if you want God to come down in a
[1:03:03] service, praise him.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Give him glory. You say, "Well, I'm not
[1:03:07] that exuberant." You don't need to be.
[1:03:09] You can be sitting there just with such
[1:03:10] a love bubbling forth. You whisper,
[1:03:12] "Lord, you're so great." It creates an
[1:03:14] atmosphere in the unseen realm. God
[1:03:16] begins to inhabit that praise.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God comes down and changes
[1:03:20] people.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, what's the
[1:03:23] opposite of withered? I'm going to get
[1:03:24] to those two offerings, but I just want
[1:03:25] to just go through this real quick. The
[1:03:28] opposite of withered. So, I was
[1:03:29] wondering what is the opposite? This is
[1:03:30] what Webster told me. It means revived,
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; flourished, bloomed, it grew. Amen. So,
[1:03:36] the fruits are what? The fruits have
[1:03:39] revived because of the word. Amen.
[1:03:41] They've flourished. That you are a
[1:03:44] fruitful vine. Amen. You're a fruitful
[1:03:46] people. Amen. You've bloomed. Amen.
[1:03:49] You're not withered in some dead kind of
[1:03:50] tree. Amen. No, you bloomed. You've
[1:03:52] grew. Amen. God's matured you. Amen.
[1:03:55] You've prospered spiritually.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. You've increased. You've thrived.
[1:04:01] Amen. You're actually a thriving people.
[1:04:02] Do you know that the believer is a
[1:04:04] thriving person? Amen. You've developed.
[1:04:07] You've become uh freshened. You've
[1:04:09] waxed. You've peaked. You've surged.
[1:04:11] You've crested. I like that.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; This is this is what you are doing. You
[1:04:15] say, "Well, I'm just I'm just scraping
[1:04:16] through life." But spiritually, You've
[1:04:18] bloomed. I mean, there's fruit. There's
[1:04:21] life that wasn't there maybe a year ago,
[1:04:23] two years ago. Why? Because now what?
[1:04:25] The joy of the Lord has been restored.
[1:04:27] And the fruit of the bride tree is
[1:04:28] coming forth.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Well, God hasn't done
[1:04:32] anything for me. I got nothing to
[1:04:33] worship him for. You've been kept by the
[1:04:35] power of God.
[1:04:38] [snorts]
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I'm I'm just going
[1:04:39] through life." You're still a believer.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; You're still here.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; You've been kept by the power of God.
[1:04:44] Every day you wake up, you say, "Thank
[1:04:46] you, Lord, for another day. Thank you,
[1:04:48] Lord. You give me one uh one more day to
[1:04:50] say I love you. Hallelujah. Still
[1:04:52] walking in faith in spite of all
[1:04:54] opposition. That's God's keeping power.
[1:04:57] That's God's enablement, God's strength,
[1:04:59] God's virtue poured into your life by
[1:05:01] the power of God through faith. Praise
[1:05:04] the Lord. Now, let's just go down to
[1:05:07] this uh the next verse. Now, he says,
[1:05:10] "Gird yourselves and lament ye priests.
[1:05:12] How ye ministers the altar come lie all
[1:05:14] night and sackcloth ye ministers of my
[1:05:16] God. For the meat offering and the drink
[1:05:18] offering is withholden from the house of
[1:05:19] your God. Now this word withholden it
[1:05:22] means to actually to keep in custody to
[1:05:24] hold back from action. It means to
[1:05:26] refrain from granting, giving or
[1:05:28] allowing or to withhold permission. So
[1:05:31] so the complaint that God would give to
[1:05:33] them in that day was these offerings
[1:05:35] weren't even in the house of God. And
[1:05:38] this is sadly what will what can happen
[1:05:40] when when when when the life of God, the
[1:05:44] word of God is not allowed to have
[1:05:45] preeminence.
[1:05:48] Now all of both of these offerings we
[1:05:50] understand they are pointing to Jesus
[1:05:52] Christ. Every offering in the Old
[1:05:53] Testament was pointing to him. He is our
[1:05:56] Passover lamb.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; He's our blood of the atonement.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. He He is He's our peace offering.
[1:06:02] He's even the scapegoat. Amen. He is the
[1:06:05] He is the um turtle dove that was
[1:06:07] killed. The blood was put on the living
[1:06:08] mate. Amen. We are the living mate
[1:06:10] bathing the earth with the blood. Right?
[1:06:12] But all those sacrifices point to
[1:06:14] Christ. So they're a shadow of things to
[1:06:16] come. So they have a purpose in being.
[1:06:18] Now this meal or meat offering that we
[1:06:21] read about it's it's it's mixed with a
[1:06:23] few things. Now I enjoyed this. So if
[1:06:26] you don't well I'll just enjoy it again.
[1:06:28] Okay. Now in in Leviticus here it says,
[1:06:31] "And when uh any will offer a meat uh a
[1:06:34] meat offering unto the Lord, his
[1:06:35] offering shall be a fine flour. He shall
[1:06:38] uh pour oil upon it and put frankincense
[1:06:41] thereon. And he shall bring it to
[1:06:42] Aaron's sons the priest, and he shall
[1:06:44] take uh there his handful of the flour
[1:06:47] thereof, and of the oil thereof, with
[1:06:49] all the frankincense thereof. And the
[1:06:51] priest shall burn the memorial of it
[1:06:52] upon the altar. And it shall be an
[1:06:54] offering made by a fire of a sweet
[1:06:56] savior unto the Lord. And the remnant of
[1:06:59] the meat offering shall be Aaron's and
[1:07:01] his sons. It is a thing most holy of the
[1:07:04] offerings of the Lord made by fire. And
[1:07:06] if thou will bring an oblation of um of
[1:07:08] a meat offering bacon in the oven, it
[1:07:10] shall be of shall be unleavened cakes of
[1:07:12] fine flour mingled with oil or
[1:07:15] unleavened wafers anointed with oil. Now
[1:07:17] the meal and the meat offering are
[1:07:19] really the same thing in the scripture.
[1:07:21] Okay? See? So so notice here. It shall
[1:07:23] be fine flour. It's unleavened. There's
[1:07:26] no sin in this offering at all. Okay?
[1:07:29] And you got to and and he was
[1:07:30] instructed, you got to pour oil upon
[1:07:32] this. Amen. So, this offering's got to
[1:07:34] be anointed. Amen. It's not some dry
[1:07:36] intellectual understanding, but the
[1:07:38] anointing of the Holy Ghost is upon this
[1:07:39] offering. Amen. And you shall put
[1:07:42] frankincense within it. Amen. Now,
[1:07:43] frankincense speaks of the service of
[1:07:45] God. Now I'm kind of um
[1:07:49] he says here he says now now
[1:07:51] frankincense I want to get these
[1:07:52] quickly. Frankincense is the offering of
[1:07:54] the service to Jehovah. Now if you want
[1:07:56] to put these scriptures down Leviticus 2
[1:07:58] and 2 Leviticus 16-15 we find out that's
[1:08:01] the order of the priesthood to make an
[1:08:02] offering to Jehovah. When he put the
[1:08:04] offering it should be made and mixed
[1:08:06] with frankincense for a sin offering and
[1:08:08] they took different things and mixed it
[1:08:09] for the meal offering for the wave
[1:08:11] offering. Frankincense was added because
[1:08:13] it was acceptable to Jehovah. It was
[1:08:16] anointed with frankincense which means
[1:08:18] service to Jehovah God. Now we find out
[1:08:20] he's deity and they brought him
[1:08:21] frankincense was a type. He was uh
[1:08:24] service to Jehovah. Jesus is Jehovah's
[1:08:26] servant. So I mean so so this
[1:08:28] frankincense in uh in the offering
[1:08:31] represents that you're going to be put
[1:08:32] into service. Now when you partake of
[1:08:34] Christ, it puts you into action. Amen.
[1:08:37] You can't help it. You're no longer just
[1:08:38] a a spectator, but you're an active part
[1:08:42] of the body of Christ. Amen. It's like
[1:08:44] exactly like when when Isaiah was in the
[1:08:46] temple and you know he saw that great
[1:08:48] vision of God and the seraraphims crying
[1:08:51] holy holy and there was a cry went out
[1:08:53] from the Lord who go for us and he said
[1:08:55] here I am Lord send me and just before
[1:08:57] that there was a seraphim took the coals
[1:08:59] from the altar and touched his lips
[1:09:01] saying thy sin is purged amen so what
[1:09:03] happens is when he parttook of that or
[1:09:05] when that happened it put him into
[1:09:06] service there's something within him
[1:09:08] said here I am Lord send me what can I
[1:09:10] do Lord to further the body of Christ
[1:09:13] What can I do to be a blessing? What can
[1:09:15] I do to be a help? Amen. You know, one
[1:09:17] of the greatest ministries that you
[1:09:19] could ever have is this. You ask each
[1:09:22] other, "How you doing?" Show care and
[1:09:24] concern behind the scenes. That's
[1:09:27] actually a great thing to do. You sit
[1:09:28] down at lunch, say, "How you doing
[1:09:30] today? How's things? How you been?" And
[1:09:31] you show genuine care for people. That
[1:09:33] will actually help the body even
[1:09:34] probably, you know, you know, far
[1:09:36] greater than you fathom. To be friendly,
[1:09:39] kind, thoughtful, considerate. Amen.
[1:09:41] That's you actually put into action,
[1:09:43] showing care for for one another. Are we
[1:09:47] all together this morning?
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see this frankincense
[1:09:50] means that now you are put into action.
[1:09:54] Praise the Lord. Let's just go back up
[1:09:55] here. Sorry.
[1:09:57] [clears throat]
[1:09:58] He says here now and then also there.
[1:10:01] So, so it's anointed. Frankincense is
[1:10:04] put upon it. Amen. This gospel that we
[1:10:06] have, Christ is not not anointed. He's
[1:10:10] anointed. Amen. This is the Holy Ghost
[1:10:12] you're partaking of. Okay? And it says,
[1:10:15] "This offering shall be made by fire."
[1:10:17] Amen. You got to have a fire in your
[1:10:18] soul when the word comes your way. It
[1:10:21] wasn't just put there uncooked. It had
[1:10:23] to be burnt. Amen. There had to be a
[1:10:25] fire in your life. Amen. And when the
[1:10:27] fire of God comes into your life, then
[1:10:29] this meal offering you partake of, Amen.
[1:10:31] It fulfills what it's meant to fulfill.
[1:10:34] Amen. And then also,
[1:10:37] see, notice this in verse three. and the
[1:10:39] remnant of the meat um meat offering
[1:10:41] shall be Aaron's and his sons. So the
[1:10:43] same offering that was placed on the
[1:10:44] altar they became part of. That's why it
[1:10:47] put them into action. Amen. So Christ
[1:10:49] that was given on Calvary, you become
[1:10:51] one with your sacrifice. I trust I'm not
[1:10:53] losing anyone this morning. Amen. You
[1:10:55] become part of him because remember he
[1:10:57] is the bread of life.
[1:11:00] Amen. He is the bread of life. Amen. So
[1:11:02] So we become one with him when we when
[1:11:05] we receive the word of God by faith into
[1:11:07] our souls. Amen. So now everything
[1:11:09] that's in Christ comes into you. You see
[1:11:11] this is why there would be that cry in
[1:11:13] Joel 1, howl and lament. These things
[1:11:15] aren't in the church. These aren't in
[1:11:17] the body because they weren't because
[1:11:19] there was no manifestation of those
[1:11:21] offerings in their lives. And this is
[1:11:23] what God wants to have us that we are
[1:11:25] we're anointed. Amen. We're put into
[1:11:27] action. Hallelujah. And there's no
[1:11:30] leaven in our lives. All the unbelief
[1:11:32] has been has been has been purged out.
[1:11:34] And there's fire the fire of God. And
[1:11:37] then also he says, "And that uh that
[1:11:40] which is left of the meat offering shall
[1:11:42] be Aaron and his sons. It is the most
[1:11:43] holy thing. The offerings of the Lord uh
[1:11:45] made by fire. No meat offering uh which
[1:11:48] ye shall bring unto the Lord shall be
[1:11:50] made with leaven, for ye shall burn no
[1:11:52] leaven, nor any honey, and any offering
[1:11:54] of the Lord made by fire. Uh as for the
[1:11:57] oblation of the first fruits, ye shall
[1:11:59] offer them unto the Lord, but they shall
[1:12:01] not be burnt on the altar for a sweet
[1:12:03] savior. And every oblation of thy meat
[1:12:05] offering shalt thou season with salt.
[1:12:08] Amen. Neither shalt thou suffer the salt
[1:12:11] of the covenant of the Lord, I mean I
[1:12:12] mean of thy God to be lacking from any
[1:12:14] from thy meat offering. With all thine
[1:12:17] offerings, thou shalt offer salt. Amen.
[1:12:20] Naturally, you want to be salty, you eat
[1:12:23] salt.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; You know the doctor says, look, your
[1:12:26] salt levels are too high. You got to eat
[1:12:29] less salt. This is naturally, right? But
[1:12:31] we want to be salty.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So there's got to be salt in this
[1:12:35] offering. Now what I'm putting to you
[1:12:38] this morning is look at your life and
[1:12:40] say, "Are these offerings, is this part
[1:12:42] of Christ living out of me? Am I salty?
[1:12:46] Am I put into service? Is there
[1:12:48] something within me saying, "Lord, I
[1:12:50] want to be a blessing to the body. I
[1:12:51] want to be a witness. I just want to be
[1:12:53] bubbling. Lord, I want to I want to
[1:12:56] share the joy and the hope that's within
[1:12:57] my life." If there's something within me
[1:12:59] saying, "Lord, I want to tell somebody."
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; That's what what what does that mean?
[1:13:03] That actually this meal offering has
[1:13:05] come into you, which is Christ, you've
[1:13:06] been put into action.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. You you see the anointing of God
[1:13:11] control your life. Amen. That means this
[1:13:14] this offering which you've partaken of
[1:13:16] has been anointed with oil.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; And are you salty? People like to be
[1:13:20] around you. They may never acknowledge
[1:13:23] God. They may never like, you know, or
[1:13:25] or receive what you have received, but
[1:13:27] there should be something in us, an
[1:13:29] atmosphere around us that people like to
[1:13:30] be around us.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; That's being salty, right? You're
[1:13:33] creating an you're creating a um an
[1:13:35] influence. Pardon me. God is now being
[1:13:38] able to influence those around you. Why?
[1:13:40] Because you're salty. Praise [snorts]
[1:13:42] the Lord.
[1:13:44] Amen. Jesus would say, he said, he said,
[1:13:46] "For the bread of God is he which come
[1:13:48] down from heaven even uh and giveth life
[1:13:50] unto the world." Then they said unto
[1:13:52] him,"Lord, evermore give us this bread."
[1:13:54] Jesus said unto them, "I am the bread of
[1:13:56] life." So he is the meal offering. He is
[1:13:58] all these offerings. Amen. And like the
[1:14:02] Apostle Paul would say, so I'm just
[1:14:03] going to find where I am in my notes
[1:14:04] here. He said, he said, "The gospel came
[1:14:07] to you not in word only, but also in
[1:14:09] power and the Holy Ghost and much
[1:14:10] assurance." Praise the Lord. So if now
[1:14:13] if you have received the gospel,
[1:14:15] there is a life of power. Amen. And much
[1:14:19] assurance has come to your soul. If
[1:14:21] you've really received it now,
[1:14:22] intellectually
[1:14:24] that's one thing. But when it's really
[1:14:26] received by faith into your heart,
[1:14:28] you'll see the power of God begin to
[1:14:30] move in your life. You'll see things
[1:14:32] which once bothered you don't bother you
[1:14:34] anymore. You'll see overcoming power
[1:14:37] manifest. Amen. Because God is not a
[1:14:39] weak God. He doesn't just leave us with
[1:14:41] an intellectual understanding with no
[1:14:43] victory. He wants the victory he won on
[1:14:45] Calvary to be manifest in you and I.
[1:14:47] Amen. that you can look back and see the
[1:14:50] things that once bothered me, they don't
[1:14:52] bother me no more. Why? Because you have
[1:14:54] received the holy, you have received the
[1:14:56] word, the gospel, not in just word only.
[1:14:59] Because remember, dead dead sermons
[1:15:02] kill.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Dead messages kill, but living ones
[1:15:06] bring life. Amen. I tell you, just the
[1:15:09] word only without the anointing, people
[1:15:11] have killed millions around the world
[1:15:13] with it. All the way down through church
[1:15:15] history, dead script, you people just
[1:15:18] quoting the word dead no life has killed
[1:15:20] many. Amen. Dead quotes without the life
[1:15:24] behind it have killed many people.
[1:15:26] People have taken the word of God which
[1:15:28] is meant to give life and brought death
[1:15:29] because the Holy Ghost has not been
[1:15:31] there when they've done it. We must
[1:15:33] never get carnal with this gospel. Amen.
[1:15:35] Because when you get carnal, you just
[1:15:36] want to win the argument. The Holy Ghost
[1:15:38] takes his flight cuz he says, "I don't
[1:15:40] want to be associated with this. I'm not
[1:15:41] part of this kind of carry on. I'm the
[1:15:43] love of God. Amen. So, if you really
[1:15:45] want God to live, have a have a feeling
[1:15:47] for who you're talking to. They may be
[1:15:49] arguing against you, they may even hate
[1:15:50] you. Amen. But you should be have such a
[1:15:52] feeling for them. Lord, forgive them.
[1:15:53] They don't know what they're doing.
[1:15:55] Amen. And what happens then? Life can
[1:15:56] come.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the letter kleth, but the
[1:16:01] spirit giveth life. Amen. Now, what does
[1:16:04] this meal offering do? As I said, the um
[1:16:06] as I said, the priests, they they
[1:16:08] parttook of it. It will produce what's
[1:16:11] in the offering comes into you and it
[1:16:13] will produce the life of Christ. Amen.
[1:16:15] As brother Amwood said, what is the
[1:16:17] shout? Uh it's the message going forth
[1:16:20] first. The living bread of life bringing
[1:16:22] forth the bride. Amen. So when you
[1:16:25] receive the word, Amen. in faith, it
[1:16:27] will produce the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:16:29] in you. Praise the Lord. You are what
[1:16:32] you eat.
[1:16:34] Amen. If you just eating debates and
[1:16:36] fasting and fighting, you become that.
[1:16:38] Amen. But if you if you if you receive
[1:16:41] the living word, it will produce the
[1:16:43] bride of Jesus Christ. I mean why?
[1:16:45] Because you and your sacrifice become
[1:16:47] one.
[1:16:49] Praise the Lord. I like that. Don't you?
[1:16:51] Now also also this meal offering brings
[1:16:54] life. I mean when it's mixed with death,
[1:16:56] it brings life. Just like Elisha in
[1:16:59] second kings when there's the school of
[1:17:00] the prophets and you know they get a big
[1:17:02] pot and you know even you know Elisha
[1:17:04] instructs them to to to cook something
[1:17:08] and and one of the one of them go out to
[1:17:10] gather herbs and different things but he
[1:17:11] just grabs a grabs a lap full of wild
[1:17:14] gourds. He doesn't realize what he's
[1:17:15] going to put in this pot. And then when
[1:17:17] it starts cooking maybe the smell or
[1:17:19] something they said to Elisha, "Oh,
[1:17:21] there's death in the pot." But you see
[1:17:23] Elisha had the meal offering.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Elisha was carrying this meal
[1:17:27] offering. So there was death and he
[1:17:28] didn't say now throw it out and start
[1:17:30] again. He said just just mix the meal
[1:17:32] offering with this pot of death and
[1:17:34] it'll bring forth life. Now if you have
[1:17:36] Christ as the meal offering in your
[1:17:38] life, what happens is there'll be once
[1:17:40] your testimony was actually brought
[1:17:41] without God in it just brings death,
[1:17:44] brings complexes. You join other
[1:17:46] people's bitterness and resentment and
[1:17:48] you just bring death upon death upon
[1:17:50] death. But then when Christ comes into
[1:17:52] your life, it's actually it was death
[1:17:54] but now it's life. Amen. that your
[1:17:56] testimony can encourage, can inspire,
[1:17:58] can strengthen, can bring faith. Amen.
[1:18:01] Can bring the life of God into someone's
[1:18:03] life. Amen. Where it's not critical no
[1:18:05] more, but it's a living testimony.
[1:18:07] You're a living, breathing, walking
[1:18:09] testimony. Amen. That God can use. Amen.
[1:18:11] What happens is now the meal offering
[1:18:13] that's within you, now you pass it into
[1:18:15] a pot of death. Someone who's, you know,
[1:18:17] dead in trespasses and sins, God can use
[1:18:19] you to bring life.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I like that. Amen. This
[1:18:25] is what you know. So, you know, and and
[1:18:28] it's like anything in life, the meal
[1:18:30] offering represent Christ. I'm just
[1:18:32] going to start reading halfway down. And
[1:18:33] when death is on, Christ was put in
[1:18:36] itsstead and death turns to life again.
[1:18:38] Don't you see? So, the same pottage, he
[1:18:40] didn't say, "Dump it out. We'll get some
[1:18:42] more. Just take that same one." And so,
[1:18:44] when a cancer has come to your life or
[1:18:46] some sickness that the doctors, the
[1:18:47] medical science can't control, don't
[1:18:49] give up. The meal offering is still
[1:18:51] ours. The Lord Jesus Christ the same
[1:18:53] yesterday, today, and forever. Throw
[1:18:55] Christ into your life with faith and
[1:18:57] it'll turn from death to life every
[1:18:59] time. It just can't fail because it's
[1:19:01] the Lord Jesus.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, you're going
[1:19:04] through something, just bring life into
[1:19:05] it. Bring that meal offering, the word.
[1:19:07] Bring Christ into your situation and
[1:19:09] it'll turn death to life. What the devil
[1:19:11] intended for evil, God turns it for
[1:19:13] good. Amen. To strengthen your
[1:19:15] testimony, strengthen your um, you know,
[1:19:18] strengthen your confidence like we heard
[1:19:20] on Wednesday, that masterpiece. Thank
[1:19:21] you very much for that, brother Isaac.
[1:19:23] Appreciated that. Amen. Do you see? It
[1:19:25] increases our confidence. Amen. In the
[1:19:27] Lord. Praise the Lord. So, you see why
[1:19:30] this needs to be in your life. Amen.
[1:19:33] It's the anointing. You become part of
[1:19:35] the sacrifice. It puts you in service.
[1:19:38] You should just see this living, right?
[1:19:40] Amen. And what does it do? It brings
[1:19:42] life. Changes death to life. This is why
[1:19:45] there's a lamentation that you know that
[1:19:47] you you're in and Joel there because
[1:19:49] these things are not in the house of
[1:19:51] God. I say it's been restored.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Life has come. The anointing has come.
[1:19:56] People been put into service. Amen. God
[1:19:59] God has done great things. He's brought
[1:20:01] forth a word to make us the living
[1:20:03] living bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. To
[1:20:06] to cause us to recognize we are part of
[1:20:08] the lamb.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you and the sacrifice
[1:20:11] become one. All Jesus is you become by
[1:20:14] his grace. Brother Bram says she is him.
[1:20:17] Amen. [snorts]
[1:20:18] Praise the Lord. When they left When
[1:20:21] they left Egypt, what happened? You
[1:20:22] didn't see the lamb. The lamb was
[1:20:24] killed. The blood was applied. They ate
[1:20:26] that lamb and they walked out in the
[1:20:27] strength of that lamb. So you saw the
[1:20:29] worshipper and his family and a lamb
[1:20:32] separate. After all said and done, you
[1:20:33] just saw the family go out.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they became one with the
[1:20:37] lamb. We become one with the word.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; All the strength of that lamb, all the
[1:20:41] vitamins. Guess why I believe your lamb
[1:20:43] tastes real good?
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Lamb is such a good meat and it wouldn't
[1:20:48] make sense to me if it was terrible,
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; right? Because God represents himself as
[1:20:53] a lamb. Taste and see the Lord is good.
[1:20:56] Amen.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm not mean that as a
[1:20:59] joke, but yeah. But I I have lamb. I'm
[1:21:01] like, Lord, this makes sense,
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; When you think about it, it makes sense.
[1:21:07] If it was some terrible, tough old thing
[1:21:09] that was disgusting, I said, Lord, this
[1:21:11] doesn't make sense. Amen.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Because once you really taste of this
[1:21:14] meal offering, once you really taste of
[1:21:16] Christ, you see he is good.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now this now let's come
[1:21:21] back to we're talking about David and
[1:21:23] his mighty men. So David long so so so
[1:21:26] this is the drink offering, okay? That
[1:21:28] that he would that that David would pour
[1:21:31] out after after his men had after his
[1:21:34] men had you know fought through 15 miles
[1:21:36] of Philistines and brought this drink
[1:21:37] back. Now this this drink offering is
[1:21:40] all the way through the scripture and it
[1:21:42] and it begins in Genesis 35 when Jacob
[1:21:45] you know you know he's there asleep
[1:21:46] there he's on the run from his uh
[1:21:48] brother there he's asleep there and then
[1:21:50] you know he sees that uh staircase from
[1:21:52] heaven right the angels ascending and
[1:21:54] descending and then after that he
[1:21:56] realized that this was a place where God
[1:21:58] was the entrance to heaven and um and
[1:22:00] and Jacob set up a pillar in the place
[1:22:03] where he talked with him even a pillar
[1:22:05] of stone and poured a drink offering
[1:22:07] thereon and poured oil thereon and Jacob
[1:22:10] called the plum name of the place where
[1:22:12] God spake with him Bethl. Okay, so this
[1:22:14] is the first time a drink offering is
[1:22:16] poured out. Now when a drink offering a
[1:22:19] drink offering once it's poured out, you
[1:22:21] cannot take it back. It represents a
[1:22:23] surrendered life to God. This is what a
[1:22:25] drink offering really is. Okay? It's a
[1:22:27] fully surrendered life to God. And I
[1:22:30] believe God has made prisoners in this
[1:22:32] day of love. Brother Brown would preach
[1:22:34] a servant sermon Paul a prisoner of
[1:22:37] Jesus Christ. As Paul would say many
[1:22:39] times, Paul a prisoner if you read
[1:22:41] through the epistles that he wrote. And
[1:22:42] what he what happened is Paul became an
[1:22:45] offering a drink offering to the Lord.
[1:22:47] Now we know Jesus Christ is the ultimate
[1:22:49] drink offering. He poured his life out
[1:22:51] that day on Calvary. Amen. And when he
[1:22:54] said, he said, "Other sheep I have which
[1:22:56] uh um are not of this fold, them also I
[1:22:58] must bring, and they shall hear my
[1:23:00] voice, and there shall be one fold and
[1:23:03] one shepherd." He's talking about you in
[1:23:04] that scripture. Praise the Lord.
[1:23:06] Therefore, doth my father love me
[1:23:08] because I lay down my life that I may
[1:23:10] take it again. No man taketh it from me,
[1:23:13] but I lay it down in myself. I have
[1:23:14] power to lay it down. I have power to
[1:23:16] take it again. This commandment have I
[1:23:18] received of my father. So, he's based my
[1:23:21] life out. And the reason I'm going to
[1:23:23] pour my life out is because I've got
[1:23:25] other sheep that need to hear my voice.
[1:23:27] There's going to be one fold and one
[1:23:29] shepherd. And so he gave his life on
[1:23:31] Calvary. And and and it wasn't taken
[1:23:33] from him. This was a free will offering.
[1:23:36] No one forced Jesus to go to Calvary.
[1:23:39] The Pharisees didn't. The Romans didn't.
[1:23:42] None of them none of them forced him. He
[1:23:44] he he willingly let his life be poured
[1:23:46] out. Amen. For you and I. And it wasn't
[1:23:49] just partially poured out. It was a
[1:23:51] complete offering.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When he died, he said,
[1:23:54] "It is finished." He's basically saying,
[1:23:56] "I've fully poured my life out. I've
[1:23:58] purchased the salvation of my people. I
[1:24:01] purchased the redemption of Adam's
[1:24:02] fallen race. It is done." Amen. And what
[1:24:05] happened? He poured himself out without
[1:24:07] measure, incompleteness. And the reason
[1:24:09] he did that is that he would gather his
[1:24:12] people to himself. Praise the Lord. So
[1:24:16] no man, no man forced him to do it. And
[1:24:18] it's the same thing with you and I. No
[1:24:20] one can force another person to give
[1:24:22] their life completely. This is not a
[1:24:25] thing where we force someone you must,
[1:24:27] you have to conform to this way, you
[1:24:28] better shape up or ship out. This is not
[1:24:31] how the gospel works. There's a drawing
[1:24:33] power of the gospel. Amen. The word of
[1:24:35] God draws people. Jesus said, "If I be
[1:24:38] lifted up, I'll draw all men unto
[1:24:39] myself." Amen. Brother Brand, when he
[1:24:41] talked about the three pulls, it wasn't
[1:24:43] the three pushes, the three shves, the
[1:24:45] three whatevers. It was it was three
[1:24:48] pulls. And those three pulls were to
[1:24:50] pull the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:24:52] ultimately. And that third pull, the
[1:24:54] opening of the word. Amen. What that do?
[1:24:56] That was going for the prize fish.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are that prize fish. You're
[1:25:00] the one he's looking for for the
[1:25:02] master's table. Amen. So, so when the
[1:25:04] word comes open, like, you know, for
[1:25:06] myself, when I first heard, Brother
[1:25:08] Brandham, it wasn't the miracles that
[1:25:10] got a hold of me. It was the word. It
[1:25:12] was Jesus Christ speaking personally to
[1:25:14] me. I mean, I couldn't I couldn't
[1:25:16] describe it necessarily, but you know,
[1:25:18] it wasn't the miracles that were like,
[1:25:19] man, this is this is God and this, you
[1:25:21] know, sure it was, but it was the word
[1:25:23] of God. It was the Jesus Christ
[1:25:26] revealing himself and what and and it
[1:25:28] didn't push me. He pulled me.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, just let God pull you to
[1:25:33] himself. Amen. If there's part of his
[1:25:35] word you haven't surrendered to, say,
[1:25:36] "Lord, pull me to that. I'm going to
[1:25:38] give up and let and let you fulfill your
[1:25:41] word in my life." Amen. If you haven't
[1:25:43] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:25:44] Jesus Christ, surrender to it cuz he's
[1:25:46] pulling you to it. Amen. He's not
[1:25:48] pushing you. He's pulling you to
[1:25:50] himself. I'd say I would give up and let
[1:25:53] him pull you.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; I mean, like a fish you're fighting.
[1:25:56] Now, I'm no fisherman, so I can't really
[1:25:58] talk about this much, but there's some
[1:25:59] fish that fight a lot. There's some fish
[1:26:01] that don't fight too much. But all of
[1:26:02] them eventually have to give up,
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; right? you they they can dive and they
[1:26:07] can run and they can all these things,
[1:26:08] but eventually like a maron or whatever,
[1:26:10] but eventually that marlin quits.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; It gets pulled to the boat. You got a
[1:26:15] predestinated hook in your mouth.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Actually, not in your mouth, in your
[1:26:18] heart. Right? Whether you know it or
[1:26:20] not, there's an anchor beyond the veil.
[1:26:22] Amen. It was put there before the
[1:26:23] foundation of the world. Amen. And God
[1:26:25] is pulling you.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; He's drawing you to his word. Amen. And
[1:26:29] you may run, but you'll just get tired.
[1:26:31] I just quit and just let God live in
[1:26:33] your life for more than you would if you
[1:26:35] just make a deathbed confession. There's
[1:26:36] no victory in that as opposed to God
[1:26:38] living through you. Sure, you're saved,
[1:26:39] but why why wait for a deathbed
[1:26:42] confession? I'd rather make it secure
[1:26:44] right now.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Have no trouble at the river right
[1:26:47] now. Amen. Give your life completely.
[1:26:49] Let your life be poured out as a drink
[1:26:51] offering
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; like his was. Amen. Paul would say this
[1:26:56] is the King James version. And in the
[1:26:58] top he says, "For now I'm ready to be
[1:26:59] offered, and the time of my departure is
[1:27:02] at hand." Now, in virtually every other
[1:27:04] translation there is, for I am already
[1:27:07] being poured out. Why? Because Paul was
[1:27:10] a prisoner. He let his life be poured
[1:27:12] out for Christ as an offering, as a
[1:27:14] response back to God. God, you poured
[1:27:17] your life out for me, so Lord, you can
[1:27:18] pour my life out for you. Amy says, I'm
[1:27:21] already being poured out in the time of
[1:27:22] my release hath arrived. Amen. Praise
[1:27:26] the Lord. He knew you his time of
[1:27:28] departure, but he says it's my time of
[1:27:29] release. I I'm no longer bound in these
[1:27:31] bodies. I want to go to be with the
[1:27:33] Lord. Sure, it's a benefit me being
[1:27:35] here, but I want to be there. Amen. And
[1:27:37] when you pour your life out, you're
[1:27:38] like, Lord, there's a purpose I have
[1:27:41] upon the earth. And Lord, I want you to
[1:27:43] fulfill that purpose in my life. Amen.
[1:27:45] But when it's done, Lord, take me home.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because you've poured out
[1:27:50] your life.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, these men, this is
[1:27:54] a sign. This is a sign that there's a
[1:27:56] life that's been poured out where David
[1:27:58] did not command these mighty men to go
[1:28:00] get him a drink. Maybe he's just in his
[1:28:03] tent. Maybe he walked out there and he
[1:28:04] looked down. Maybe he could see
[1:28:05] Bethlehem from where he was. I'm not
[1:28:07] sure. He's up in the hold. He looked
[1:28:09] down. He saw Bethlehem and just a cry
[1:28:10] came out. Maybe it wasn't that loud. I
[1:28:13] don't know. But he said, "Oh, I just
[1:28:14] wish I could have a drink from that well
[1:28:16] of Bethlehem. You know, the one by the
[1:28:18] gate." Cuz he thought, you know, he
[1:28:20] remembered his childhood. remember
[1:28:21] drinking from that well as a boy and
[1:28:23] thirsty hot day. He would drink from
[1:28:25] that feeling so refreshed and you know
[1:28:27] he just said, "Oh, if I could just have
[1:28:28] that, you know, and then but that
[1:28:30] stirred that desire became a commandment
[1:28:34] to his mighty men because his mighty men
[1:28:37] loved him. They knew he was coming into
[1:28:39] power. They knew he was God's anointed
[1:28:41] man. And his desire became like a
[1:28:44] commandment to them and it stirred them
[1:28:45] up. Say, "Boys, we're going to go get
[1:28:47] our king a drink."
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We don't just want to let
[1:28:50] him here with a longing. We want to
[1:28:51] fulfill his longing. We want to fulfill
[1:28:53] his joy. Amen. So they pulled their
[1:28:55] sword. Amen. Pull your weapons, boys.
[1:28:57] We're going to Oh, but the garrison's
[1:28:59] around there. Who cares? Our king wants
[1:29:01] a drink. Amen. So what did they do? They
[1:29:03] cut through 15 miles of flesh, 15 miles
[1:29:06] of Philistines. Amen. To get their king
[1:29:09] a fresh drink of water.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And friends, I tell you
[1:29:13] what, God is looking for a people today
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; to cut through every every tradition.
[1:29:19] every creed, your upbringing, your
[1:29:21] culture, all those things that would
[1:29:23] restrict you from giving your complete
[1:29:25] life to Jesus Christ. He says, "And then
[1:29:28] there those warriors grabbed them
[1:29:30] swords. David cried out for a fresh
[1:29:32] drink of water. They cut their way
[1:29:33] through 15 mi of men to get him a drink
[1:29:35] of water. And David poured out upon the
[1:29:37] ground a sacrifice, a drink offering."
[1:29:39] Yes, warriors today, Jesus wants a drink
[1:29:41] of good, cold Pentecostal fresh water.
[1:29:45] these denominational stagnated waters is
[1:29:47] is is sickening to him. Take the word of
[1:29:49] God, pull it and cut through all these
[1:29:51] creeds and things till we can hit that
[1:29:53] place where there's a fresh drink for
[1:29:55] him. What is that fresh drink? A real
[1:29:58] true worship, a genuine heart where he
[1:30:01] can pour down his make his word live in
[1:30:04] this day. That's what mean. That's what
[1:30:06] it means to give God a drink of fresh
[1:30:08] Pentecostal cold water, a real true
[1:30:11] worship, a genuine heart. That's why you
[1:30:14] got to cut through that Philistine of of
[1:30:15] of ought, of discontent, of of fussing,
[1:30:19] fighting, complexes, culture, whatever
[1:30:21] more. You got to cut through those
[1:30:22] things when you realize God wants a
[1:30:24] genuine place where a genuine heart, a
[1:30:26] genuine faith that he can pour down his
[1:30:28] word to make it live in this day.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; I think it's worth cutting through.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; I think it's worth going, "Oh, but my
[1:30:35] culture is, you know, reserved and
[1:30:37] quiet. My last name's that." Why should
[1:30:39] that define you? Why should where we're
[1:30:41] born define us of how we should worship
[1:30:43] God? Why should anything dictate to us
[1:30:45] but God how we should worship?
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, but what will someone say? You got
[1:30:49] to dance past the critics. You to go
[1:30:52] beyond that sound barrier of criticism.
[1:30:54] What will that person think of you?
[1:30:55] Well, if you break through the sound
[1:30:57] barrier and you let God really be God in
[1:30:59] your life, it might get a hold of the
[1:31:00] critic and make him a worshshiper.
[1:31:03] Brother Ram saw saw, you know, a guy was
[1:31:05] what playing on a washboard. Don't know
[1:31:06] how that works. and a sister was dancing
[1:31:08] in the spirit on the platform and he was
[1:31:11] sitting there criticizing it. But then
[1:31:13] God in his grace brought him back into
[1:31:15] the scripture where dancing was a sign
[1:31:17] of victory.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what happened? He started
[1:31:20] joining in too. Amen. So someone who's
[1:31:22] cold and indifferent. You want to get
[1:31:23] that person on fire for God, you start
[1:31:26] breaking through every barrier, amen, of
[1:31:29] pride of, well, what will that person
[1:31:31] think? If they're spiritual, they'll
[1:31:33] think a lot of you. If they can't, well,
[1:31:35] they'll hopefully get converted, right?
[1:31:37] So, why should we let those things
[1:31:38] dictate, well, I've had a bad day. I've
[1:31:40] had a bad week. I've got a bad life. Let
[1:31:43] God change that.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. God has saved you.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; God has redeemed you. Amen. God has kept
[1:31:50] you. Amen. God's given you victory. We
[1:31:53] worship God because of who he is.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; More than just what he's done. We
[1:31:57] worship because of who he is. He's the
[1:31:59] almighty God. He made heavens and earth.
[1:32:01] Amen. He made you. He made a way for you
[1:32:03] to get back to him.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's always been faithful
[1:32:06] and true.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; He's always been true to his word. Amen.
[1:32:10] He's never lost a battle. Amen. He's
[1:32:12] always been there for you. Even if
[1:32:14] you're out in the world somewhere, he
[1:32:15] was watching over you. Amen. Because
[1:32:17] you're part of him. Amen. He's always
[1:32:20] You've never been out of his care.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm not feeling too much right
[1:32:24] now." It's revelation.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; It's not by feelings. It's by
[1:32:28] revelation. Amen. So, why not, friends,
[1:32:30] let go? Why not? Why don't we have a
[1:32:32] genuine heart?
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Forget the religious politics. Forget
[1:32:36] the message politics. Forget about what
[1:32:38] this person's done. What has Jesus done
[1:32:40] to you?
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Start thinking on those things. And then
[1:32:45] you'll get a joy and a victory. Amen.
[1:32:47] And you have a genuine heart. Lord, I
[1:32:49] don't know why you saved me, but you
[1:32:50] did.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; I don't know why you ever loved me, but
[1:32:53] I'm so glad you did. I mean, I was
[1:32:55] running away from you, Lord, but you
[1:32:56] didn't just quit and say, "Well, there
[1:32:58] goes another one." No, you pursued me,
[1:33:00] Lord. I mean, you got a hold of my life,
[1:33:02] Lord Jesus. Amen. What does that do?
[1:33:04] That produces a genuine heart.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. That he can pour his word. He can
[1:33:09] pour down his make his word live in this
[1:33:12] day. He'll have it.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; He said he would. If he said he'll have
[1:33:15] it, well, why not have it, Lord? Have it
[1:33:16] here, Lord. Make this quote personal to
[1:33:18] me, Lord. The prophet was talking about
[1:33:20] somebody. I'm here.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who he was referring to, you know,
[1:33:24] like Mary realized after the angel came
[1:33:26] her way, it's me.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Isaiah was talking about me.
[1:33:30] Hallelujah. Should we not see the same
[1:33:32] thing in the word about ourselves
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; when he said there'd be a bride without
[1:33:36] spot or wrinkle washed in the blood of
[1:33:37] the lamb? Amen. Should we not say he was
[1:33:39] talking about me?
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; I'm not a I'm not sure about the person
[1:33:42] next to me, but he's talking about me.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:46] Praise the Lord. He said he would
[1:33:48] restore the faith of the people back to
[1:33:50] the father's faith of the children.
[1:33:51] Malachi 4 tells us it'll come and it'll
[1:33:54] be there. Don't you worry. It'll be
[1:33:56] it'll be right there. God has done said
[1:33:58] so. So that's all. I like that.
[1:34:03] Amen. Oh Gentiles though, I said, "Who
[1:34:05] will pull the sword with me?" He wants a
[1:34:06] fresh drink this morning. Not this old
[1:34:08] stagnated church creeds and things we're
[1:34:10] fooling around with. He wants genuine
[1:34:12] faith in his word. This is getting him a
[1:34:14] fresh drink. He wants genuine faith in
[1:34:16] his word. Who will believe every word of
[1:34:18] it? Let's go to the well and bring back
[1:34:20] a drink of refreshment. A worship that's
[1:34:22] built upon not creeds and denomination,
[1:34:24] but a genuine spirit worship where
[1:34:26] Christ among us living his life the way
[1:34:29] he wants to among us. That's not with
[1:34:32] creeds and different things. Let's just
[1:34:35] have him that way.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; That's getting him a drink, a fresh
[1:34:42] drink of water.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Don't you want that? Yes.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; See, it said in Joel, "Those things
[1:34:51] weren't in the church." Why? I say,
[1:34:52] "We're being restored back." Amen. Those
[1:34:54] things are now in the church. Amen.
[1:34:56] There's a genuine people with a genuine
[1:34:58] heart that have a genuine love and a
[1:35:00] genuine faith for God. And they're
[1:35:02] sitting in front of me this morning. God
[1:35:04] is restored. You are his drink offering
[1:35:06] cuz Christ is in you. You are the life
[1:35:08] poured out. It's no longer I that
[1:35:10] liveth, but Christ that liveth in me.
[1:35:12] Praise the Lord. I want to say I'm just
[1:35:15] going to finish with this. I'm going to
[1:35:16] finish with this quote. We're going to
[1:35:17] wind up just now. He says, "You just put
[1:35:20] one or two good members in a church." So
[1:35:23] these ones that have the meal and the
[1:35:24] drink offering in them, you have Christ,
[1:35:26] okay? You just put one or two good
[1:35:29] members in a church that's really on
[1:35:30] fire for God. We don't need to have a
[1:35:33] majority.
[1:35:34] Oh, but this person and the church is
[1:35:36] going this way and but but what about
[1:35:38] you?
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; If the whole church gets cold, I'm not
[1:35:42] joining you.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. If if if half of everyone gets all
[1:35:46] political and all fussy and rigid and
[1:35:48] the you know the cood becomes actually
[1:35:50] not what God put it for but just to
[1:35:52] restrict everything, I ain't going with
[1:35:54] you.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; I'm going to stay with the word of God.
[1:35:56] Now, I'm not saying you're going that
[1:35:57] way, but but we can't go with the crowd.
[1:35:59] It's me and God.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; It's me and God. Fellowship is two men
[1:36:03] in a ship and it's me and God in that
[1:36:06] ship.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we just join our boats
[1:36:09] together, right? But you see, it's you
[1:36:10] and God.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; How are you and God doing today? He's
[1:36:13] doing real good.
[1:36:15] Amen. You just put one or two good
[1:36:16] members in a church. See, we can never,
[1:36:18] and I know this goes everywhere, so I
[1:36:20] just challenge everyone. We can't
[1:36:21] complain if our church is cold.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; We can't complain that even if our
[1:36:25] church is dead. You put one or two good
[1:36:27] members. You say, "Lord, I want to be
[1:36:28] that one or two good members."
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; That Lord, you can make a difference in
[1:36:32] this community. You can make a
[1:36:33] difference in this group. Amen. That God
[1:36:35] can live through me. If no one else
[1:36:37] wants it, Lord, I want it. Lord, I want
[1:36:39] you to live in my life, Lord. That you
[1:36:40] can pour your word in and live through
[1:36:42] me. Amen. that when you when a need
[1:36:45] arises, what happens? That person can
[1:36:47] meet you, Lord.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; See, we must never ever get caught up in
[1:36:52] fusses. See, fusses are nothing.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; They're just fusses. Never get caught up
[1:36:56] in negative things. It's ne it doesn't
[1:36:58] help nobody. Let's stay with the
[1:37:00] positive. What has Jesus done for you?
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; You know, there's a reason we have
[1:37:04] eternity to praise him.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; The millennium's going to feel short.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, where did that where'd that time go?
[1:37:11] It's been a thousand years, you know.
[1:37:13] I'm just getting started. That's fine.
[1:37:16] Soon you'll have no time cuz time will
[1:37:18] be no more
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; and you'll have all the time in the
[1:37:20] world if I put it that way. But you see,
[1:37:22] there's a reason we're not going to get
[1:37:23] bored in heaven.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; We have so much to thank God for. Why
[1:37:27] not start now?
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, one day when I'm surrounded by the
[1:37:31] angels and I'm surrounded by the saints
[1:37:33] and you know, and I'm really in the
[1:37:35] presence of God, you're in the presence
[1:37:36] of God now.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. The closest you get to heaven is
[1:37:39] when you and God come together. Amen.
[1:37:41] You're in the presence of heaven. You're
[1:37:43] in the presence of the angels. Amen. So
[1:37:45] why not start enjoying him now? Why not
[1:37:48] get the practice up?
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's carnal. Just relax.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Why not practice now? Oh, one day I'll
[1:37:57] really be able to. What you are here is
[1:37:59] what you are there.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; So why not? Why not start being here
[1:38:04] what you are there?
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have a revelation that
[1:38:07] you're with Job when the morning stars,
[1:38:08] sons of God, shouted for joy before the
[1:38:10] foundation of the world, why not say,
[1:38:12] "God, manifest that in time in the
[1:38:15] presence of my enemy. Lord, manifest
[1:38:17] that in time to prove the power of your
[1:38:19] blood."
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Why not? I think let's
[1:38:23] just be Let's just do it. I think it's
[1:38:25] good.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sit down. I'm going to finish this
[1:38:28] cuz I like it. Now, you just put one or
[1:38:29] two good members in a church that's
[1:38:31] really on fire for God.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Who's going to be that one or two? Amen.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. It'll do something for that
[1:38:37] church. More than 40 revival you could
[1:38:40] have.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; And we all want revival, do we not? But
[1:38:43] one or two good members. What about 10?
[1:38:46] What about 20? What about however many
[1:38:47] people are here? What about that? We're
[1:38:50] all good members on fire for God. What
[1:38:52] would that do?
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my. God would just come down.
[1:38:56] Hallelujah. Be such an atmosphere of
[1:38:57] praise.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just lose ourselves in the
[1:39:00] spirit of God. We'd walk out of these
[1:39:02] doors full of his goodness, fat and
[1:39:04] flourishing, praising God. I mean, just
[1:39:06] living off the goodness of God every
[1:39:07] day. Mondayitis wouldn't bother us cuz
[1:39:09] everything everything's in perspective
[1:39:11] now cuz God is good.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; I mean, you may be in boring Monday, but
[1:39:15] hey, praise the Lord, it's Monday.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a song and if I could
[1:39:18] sing, I'd sing it. There's a song, one
[1:39:20] more day. One more day. Lord, you've
[1:39:22] given me one more day to testify of your
[1:39:24] grace.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. I love that song because we have
[1:39:27] one more day.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord on this side.
[1:39:31] So it would do more than 40 revivals you
[1:39:33] could have, right? A good cleansed
[1:39:35] member set an example and with her face
[1:39:37] shining with the glory of God, with
[1:39:39] sweetness and humility to stand there in
[1:39:42] the power of God and watch when somebody
[1:39:43] gets sick, they'll call that person to
[1:39:45] come pray. Or you might make fun of
[1:39:48] them. Um you might make fun of them and
[1:39:50] their tire is deflated so forth. You
[1:39:53] might all this nonsense say, "But let
[1:39:55] but let death strike you one time."
[1:39:56] You'll find out when them struggles
[1:39:58] begin to come who that real sincere
[1:40:00] person is in the church. He says, "Here
[1:40:03] I am, Lord. Send me. Let my influence be
[1:40:06] upon others. Lord, let me for me to live
[1:40:08] as Christ to die as gain. Let this word
[1:40:11] influence me." And my prayer is, Lord,
[1:40:14] while I'm in this valley here.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Of the Maricopa Valley, I say, or
[1:40:19] the hut valley, right? The little
[1:40:21] sunspot of the world. May I be able to
[1:40:24] be in contact with the son of God that
[1:40:26] would scatter sunshine of the Holy
[1:40:28] Spirit throughout the valley and will
[1:40:30] cause brethren and women and sisters and
[1:40:32] even sinners to find this fountain
[1:40:34] filled with blood.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; You going to be like that.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, if Christ is
[1:40:40] in you,
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; the meal offering is in you, you'll be
[1:40:44] able forth, life will come forth, you'll
[1:40:48] be put into action.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what happened? You are his
[1:40:53] drink offering.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; A life poured out
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; that God can live.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's have the musicians, please,

[1:41:16] that scripture in Joel 1:13, you know,
[1:41:18] but I just didn't do it. But we can
[1:41:21] instead of lamenting, we can rejoice.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Instead of mourning, we can shout.
[1:41:26] Amen. Why? Because these offerings are
[1:41:29] not withholden in the house of the Lord.
[1:41:31] In our house, they are there. They're in
[1:41:33] abundance. They're manifesting
[1:41:35] themselves. Amen. We can rejoice. We're
[1:41:38] not We're not clothed in sackcloth.

[1:41:44] righteousness, the robes of his
[1:41:46] righteousness. Amen. We have been
[1:41:48] restored. Amen.

[1:56:58] us into service like never before.
[1:57:00] Father, may the joy of the Lord be our

[1:57:05] God, but it would flourish. It would
[1:57:06] revive. It would grow. It multiply
[1:57:09] because there's joy of the Lord in our

[1:57:23] things that day. And Lord, you're here
[1:57:24] to manifest your victory in our lives.

[1:57:28] the mountain. We're so thankful, Lord.
[1:57:30] Those things will fall at our feet
[1:57:31] because you've conquered it that day.

[1:57:35] in your house, but we're your children.
[1:57:36] We're your bride. And we come here to
[1:57:38] say thank you, Lord, for your blood.
