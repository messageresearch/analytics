dwell with your people the Lord we love to praise you Lord we love to work we just love to come in your presence well such such a wonderful experience to show you all in the power of your resurrection of Jesus our Lord and we just pray that you can fellowship with us tonight I just pray that you just left the lid off your word Lord just pour your blessings out upon us the congregation Lord they both congregation and Minister receive from you tonight thank you thank you please put my slideshow over you know it's a beautiful day to day the Sun was shining as a lovely day and lower hutt and I just enjoy it you know everything's going good at the moment I think the city's in a real good financial time and works going good plenty of work plenty of jobs not hard to find a job hard to find a house but it's just a really nice time everything's going right there hasn't really been any major tribulations it's just going good and sometimes when things are going good we can begin to relax a little bit so tonight I've just got a little bit of a study that the Lord's been dealing with and just want to express what the Lord's been showing to me you know the ministers would know sometimes you study and you're like can't wait to preach this and then you go to put something down and the Lord sees no you're not gonna preach that you're gonna go down the seven-year huh oh just follow what the Lord's got to say so if you turn to Jeremiah 8 first 7 or you can read it up on the board I love the Book of Jeremiah and I've just been spinning some real timely and it reads 8 verse 7 yeah the stork in heaven knoweth her appointed times and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observed the time of their coming but my people know not the judgment of the Lord so the prophet saying here how is it that you don't recognize what's going on around you look at nature nature recognizes remember in the earthquakes come the cattle move away from the fence because they've recognised the sign that's given for those animals and there's been a sign given for humans to recognize the time they love them and it was important right through each church age that the people living in that church age recognized what was taking place and near time and gave the appropriate response so I want to go to another scripture here just to bring this out Genesis 6 verse 5 and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at its heart and the Lord said I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that I have made them for God's angry at what mans done and now if we drop down to verse 11 and he says the earth also was corrupt before God and the earth was filled with violence and God looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth and God said unto Noah the end of all flesh has come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold I will destroy them with the earth so he's dealing now with the condition of man and also the condition of the earth and it's come up to this time back in that day that has got to be destroyed and we come up to that time again and this age let's just pray Heavenly Father we just pray Lord that you just add the blessings to your word Lord and just you move the lips father Lord I'm just insufficient law just sir just human flesh Lord just like our Prophet was human flesh law but yet your word remains Lord Jesus your word still speaks and Lord we want to hear what you have to say we come at the service to you in Jesus name Amen you may be seated I'm thankful to be have it actually stand here with a voice because the devil has just fought me and started bringing this sickness on me and it was the same feeling of sickness I had when we were sick over Christmas for this flu-like symptom and as its throat just hurt for days and like no I'm not taking this out Satan always tries us I don't know what brother Ben must go through every week I know and I've been fighting the devil and and the Lord's been healing me it's the fastest I've ever been able to suppress a cold it's almost like it's not even there praise God last time when I spoke about the spiritual amnesia we were talking about searching our own hearts for those little seats that that can just raise up and that can affect your walk with the Lord and I just felt that it was undone and I just I don't really like preaching these sorts of things but I just felt like someone's not recognized it and and it's such an important thing just the condition of the world and it's just my work my work colleague today was saying to me telling me a testimony about he would almost hit a car crash it's two young kids in the car and he said it made me think to myself he just managed to avoid this hundred kilometer collision and was one mérida wing mirror with the other car and he said you know I thought to myself if that had it been up would I have been happy and that can be what it can be like for us if your time was called right now what what would happen where would you be and we've come to this time again with that condition that was coming up under the Noah's day in their antelopian destruction we're in the same condition now shocking so you can say yeah I see it I see but where's the action in our lives and response to what we see because that's what we're talking about now and that's when it comes down to home and that's where it starts getting you know I said to brother Ben are just checking there's no tomatoes under the sound desk back there it's a day that we should be running to God when we see evil we should run to God we certainly shouldn't run to the things and partake because to become a partaker of what's happening out there though it looks good and look good to Eve - but to be a partaker is to also be partaker of the punishment for it I've got lots of Scripture and lots of quotes tonight it's just the way the Lord's lead me for this so you'll just have to bear with me barman Gilead these people today it's just like this a man dying on the doorsteps of a doctor's office when the doctor in the building has the cure for the disease but he refuses to take it if the man has a disease and the doctor has the cure fruit and the man lay on the doctors doorsteps but if he refused to take his medicine he will die on the doorstep you can't blame the doctor the doctor would give him the medicine that would cure him if he had only come and take it but it isn't the doctors fault he's got the remedy but the man's too stubborn to take it then whose fault is it so it is today that many people die in the front of the church on the steps and the pews die in their sins because they refuse to accept God's Barnet's and Gilead they die in their sins because they refuse it not because there isn't any they just refused to take it help us long this is interesting Ben what will they take if they refuse that in what will they take they have to take something false instead it's not because there's none near because there is but men and woman just refused to take it and then they died died and the church said in the meeting meetings and listen night after night to inspire prophets of God who takes the word fearlessly and lays it out he must be born again men and woman sit in the pews and die and sink into utter despair and annihilated from God not because there's no grace and salvation but because they refuse to receive it rather been preachers and just lays it out and I can only imagine that I don't know I just imagine as a as a pastor and you know your congregation not like a minister does but you you you know your congregation and you preach service after service and you maybe you just pray I wish they would get it I wish they would get it or was maybe someone he's dealing with but people just sit there and it's like the word doesn't affect them what's wrong why hasn't the word affect them what's coming that's blocking the channel because there's something blocking in the channel is there no balm in Gilead then why is the daughter of my people so sick isn't there a physician near to minister this sure there is God has his prophets God had his barn yet and God's daughter as sick and she hasn't recovered but it isn't because there's no bomb there isn't because that there is no prophet but because the daughter refused to take the medicine that's true what's been done in this generation what's been done through revelation 10 verse 7 it's not something that's been done in secret something that's been done behind a closed door with this little group coming under some train bridge where the coming of the Lord was it's not like it's been hidden it's been in plain view no cults do things behind doors and yet we get blamed of accused of being over you're just a cult no come see look this is all open there's no it's no cult about this denominations are cult the work that he does in your heart is a private work right it's a private work no one can see what he comes and does in your heart but then everybody sees what he does in your heart because what he does in your heart then comes out and then everyone sees it so after all it's not a secret work that's just a secret between you and God hey meanne jesus never did in anything in private and the people back then had no excuse and go to John 18 19 and high priests then asked Jesus of his disciples and of his doctrine jesus answered him I spake openly to the world I ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple whether the Jews always resort and in secret I have said nothing why ask us tell me asked him which heard me what I have said unto them behold they know what I have said and when he had thus spoken one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand saying answer they'll the high priest so that's happened today it's happened today yeah jesus answered if I have spoken any evil be a witness of the evil but of well why smite us now me and I've just I just see that this has happened in this age for a prophet brother Brennan never spoken secret he never spoke any evil of anyone it's the most humble man I've ever heard speak but he was reticle ridicule people don't you remember that man someone said there's no such thing as a miracle and he said if any man can come to me and prove that there's such thing as a miracle I'll give him a thousand dollars so brother Brennan gathered together a heap of witnesses and they went there and they said this man was healed here's a doctor that diagnoses Kasey's Hill and the man said he said was a thousand dollars and the man said well we don't have it it's in some other state brother owns ok let's go get it and that man said to him I'll tell you what you will go there and I'll take a little girl and I'll cut her arm and you hear what is wrong with people that come under the spirit of Satan to cut cut someone and they're ridiculing him of evil crazy they're just Pharisees of this day but no one would dare no one would dare to to challenge the presence of God when he was here right everyone wants to challenge the challenge all that the serpent seed and challenge all these different doctrines today well that's not right actually we take the scripture it's not right but why didn't they do it when the Prophet was here because he openly he put in newspaper articles all you brothers all you ministers you come here and we'll have a debate and we'll talk about serpents see we'll talk about predestination we'll talk about the baptism and not one person beard to challenge them openly because they knew they couldn't fight the word but they were bound to their thoughts through their denomination shame on them I see I've added some pictures for the kids God doesn't call a man to judgment without first warning him well you can't do nothing with the church it's so formal and gone there's nothing left they've done sold out their birth rights for a mess of pottage and they're just waiting judgment the Holy Spirit has crossed this nation showing his signs and wonders and they continually spurn his grace he's a vindicated himself improves his great of indication that he's the Word of God manifested in this day and they still turn it down see there's nothing left now you just can't always do that you mean you you just can't always do that you mean there was a time where you could do that he's starting to show that if something that's happened that you just can't always do that we're going to try and bring this out and Luke 12 verse 10 that's it and whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man it shall be forgiven him but unto him that blaspheme against the Holy Ghost that shall not be forgiven there's something serious that can take place there's actually something that you can do that there can be no forgiveness for so serious and when when brother Branham came and he preached those seals and there was the opening of the word coming forth and Christ was working through his flesh people could blaspheme the man they could cut down on brother Brad and there was forgiveness there's been many people throughout and the and message ministers that fought against the message fought against brother Brennan but there was forgiveness for that but to challenge the God displaying himself it's a different story and we had come to a point of time where you could no longer reject this message well look at there's some why price speak and I'm going to pick this back up later because as I was going through the study the Lord brought something out and I thought well this really is important and he said a man picked up a picture of the angel of the Lord the other day a Baptist minister and laughed at her see that's blasphemy see there's no forgiveness for that no forgiveness for that for blaspheming the angel of the Lord in that picture that's what Jesus said it's blasphemy when you see it doing the very works that Christ did and he said when they see the works in Christ he was the sacrifice and they caught him belzebub a devil because he was doing it and now they and now they say he said I forgive you for that but when the Holy Ghost comes to do the same thing you speak a word against it and it will never be forgiven you in this world or the world to come see if you ever questioning things of the message I take the attitude if I don't understand there's been things when I come into this me so DOS don't understand I just couldn't see it I couldn't see how the Scriptures fit and instead of doing all that's false I just said Lord you answer it in your time sometimes I just come like the next day and be like open and this stuff there's some things that set there for maybe two years and I just left and there's still one thing at the moment that I would like the law to reveal more on but it's not even important but I know in his time and he'll reveal it to me right now it seems like a contradiction but I had so much faith in this message and in this prophet that I know that I just don't see it yet so you've better to just wait on it even if you start falling away from the message don't just say oh well maybe I don't see eye to eye but don't go and head against the message because that's dangerous but yet when the people see you today and they see Christ manifesting through your life hey why do they hate it are you doing evil you're doing evil to them are you doing good why do they hate it because a seed in them has to manifest they hate the way you dress right they hate the way you have your hair you're like this oddball you know and then lately we seen we pulled up next to this work fan trades vehicle Heidi trades field look really nice and this person gets out she or he I'm not too sure and a nice long dressed and like anything normal nice woman's dress and a beard down here and it was scary all the jewelry but that's that he's less ridiculed them we are that's just normal to this world what's gone wrong something's gone wrong but the way people treat you today is their approach to God even if they can't see this message it can be an approach to God for those people we should make ourselves approachable and we'll be stuck up you know but rain you drown they just don't realize they're an oddball you know I'm not old-fashioned my wife's not old-fashioned she's just the original and then I like the original see because all this hybrids see that we've got today you've only got a look you've only got to look at nature and that hybrids see that can't stand it can't when the storms of life come when the doctor says you've got cancer and you've got three months to live hybrid sea goes but the real weight goes Lord I need you and then the original seed but the more time goes on since brother Branham left the scene the more people criticize I want to come to this because this is something quite important because even ourselves we can begin to doubt as time more time goes on and more time goes on but time can only go so much because times already been pronounced that's got an end when judgment is about to strike this earth you know when brother Brennan was up in sunset man and he said judgments about to strike the west coast and a couple of days later Alaska nearly sunk and the prophets prophecy was fulfilled right then and there but then he also prophesy that California would go down and fall into the bottom of the sea and he talked about Russia and I elating America with nukes you know all these different prophecies and they haven't come to pass you so what is he a false prophet because he said thousands of things that did come to pass but the more time goes on the more people start to doubt the Prophet but he's already been vindicated God doesn't call a man to judgment without first warning him all right we find out the first he sends his prophets with a warning he doesn't change his way his method of doing things he does not always strike when he warns I want you to watch this quotation God gives a warning but he don't always strike at the same time he warns that you notice that and then when he does not doesn't strike when he sends a warning then the Prophet is mocked you didn't have it you told a lie he wasn't right you know I think we could glean something from that's just some we could clean some advice from Noah's day because as he stood out there on the edge of us are maybe while he was building it he was say judgments coming judgments coming because he recognized something and people would you know that just was just an old man just labeling off again he's saying it's gonna rain the skies are going to open up and God is going to destroy this earth but you know I bet as much as people didn't believe him and they thought he was crazy I bet people would go up there every now and again just because they were intrigued by him because he had a life that he loved and he was no evil so they were intrigued so they would go up there album and then go back down now Jesus crazy I go back up and I wonder if it can be like that for us sometimes because we know that either we're at the Earth's and judgment God's going to destroy the world and then you start living back in the pleasures of the earth again oh I know the Lord's going to destroy the earth so you start to go back up to the ark again and you wind up this wishy-washy Christian but there was someone else that recognized the hour of that day the evilness and he wasn't fussed about going in and out he just walked before God and Enoch when in a rapture and we could be like that just recognizing the hour of the day and the people in Noah's day that would have still been worshiping right it might have been idolatry worship evil worship but they were still worshipping God but it wasn't the way that God wanted to be worship they weren't worshipping right we've got to make sure our worship is right we should we should actively seek that we worship God the right way and the indictment he says today men walk ignorant Lee they don't know that that's the truth they think it's some kind of ism they don't dig down deep enough and to get into the spirit of Revelation they don't pray enough they don't call upon God enough they just take it lightly oh well I believe there's a god sure the devil believes the same thing the devil believes that more than some people claim to believe it is that right the devil believes that entrance people just believe it and go on but the devil trembles knowing as judgment is coming and the people believe it and don't pay no attention that the judgment is coming that's what that's my burden I can see that judgment is coming upon this earth what are you going to do about it how serious are you that you do not want to be in that judgment because there has to be an action it has to be a preparation the devil knows as Times drawing to a close he knows us as endures near it's gonna be destroyed you know he has seen it happen before remember this we haven't seen that happen before but he has seen that happen before so when these signs start appearing he's going my time's running out because I've seen it happen before and I want to show this and take a look at Moses on his mountain getting his commission to bring the people out and into the Promised Land so I'm going to go to Exodus Exodus 3 verse 6 moreover he said I am the God of thy father the God of Abraham the god of Isaac and the God of Jacob and Moses had his face for he was afraid to look upon God I remember brother Brennan saying a similar statement to that too that he was afraid to look upon Jesus and the Lord said surely I have seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt and they have heard their cry and and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up into a land and to a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey and to the place of the Canaanites the Hutterites the emirates the PISA writes the Hivites and the Jebusites so in first eight there he says I am come down where was he that was Moses I am come down to deliver my people that was work God working through Moses to see it as people free and brother branham showed Moses was a perfect type of Christ and when God moved through the spirit he moved Moses to bring his people out of judgment so the devil seen this happened before God coming down into a man to bring a people out of bondage but you can come so close to meeting God you know you can come through the outer court and come into the inner room but then you've got to go right through there and go beyond the veil some people only come and enter there to their second stage of grace right they don't come whole way in and meet God because without coming through there in a veil in meeting God you're not going in a rapture and why does rather say it the way it is you have to meet God in there in a place because in that in a place is where the Mercy Cedars and without making your way to that mercy see there ain't no rapture for you so you need to make sure you get yourself into that secret place of Christ and when you do how insignificant are the things of this world going to see how insignificance is YouTube's going to seem when you come into that place how insignificant is a sporting event gonna seem oh I don't know whatever your your flesh lusts to know how insignificant will that feel when the fires falling amen if we could only recognize Jesus Christ and Moses if we could recognize that we could recognize what God's doing today amen he's bringing you people out of Egypt and it's God himself doing it he's just working through a man and the indictment and today there's not a reader that cannot read acts 2:38 the same as I can read it and the rest of it just the same as I can read it but because of their Creed's and because of the denominational tickets they've got in their pocket the marks of the Beast they packing around his fellowship cards and taking those things they crucify to themselves Jesus Christ afresh and crucify him before the public and blaspheme the very God that promised to do this bringing damnation upon the race now there they not the sinner they that is the Church of that day they found fault with the man who was the word that's right they found fault with the man who was the word now they find fault with the word working through man see they just vice versa root which is the person the Holy Spirit working through as God's vindication so they found fault with Jesus Christ how much more do they find fault today and yet they crucified Jesus Christ afresh today no wonder God's going to destroy this terrible racist in a terrible generation they found fault with Moses and you the whole only holy one Moses said no other holy man in the land has there no other prophet there were plenty of ministries and brother branham's day they were plenty of more popular ministries and brother Brennan but there was one that had the provided way and now because I've rejected in this world is trembling as in judgment but just because it was a nice day today just because the Sun was shining just because the money was coming in and everyone had work and there was no tribulation oh well maybe God's not going to destroy the earth like tomorrow maybe it's like 10 years away what if it's not what if it's not whatever it's tomorrow the indictment I must show and will show that the same spirit is on the people today that brought the first crucifixion and doing the same thing I must do that if it's going to be a crucifixion that they've crucified I must show to the to the people that the same attitude and the people today is doing the same thing spiritually that they did physically then and God is spirit so if they're doing the same thing spiritually today that they did physically then and it's the same thing that they're doing today they crucified physically Jesus Christ the Son of God and now today by the same word and by the same Holy Spirit the same word I wish to show the churches they're there where they stand that they're doing the same thing today and the Bible said that they would do it and prove that this is the day that we're living in now I just this is really how awful statement that he makes here it could not have been done a few years ago I say 50 years ago it could not have been done he wasn't crucified for in 1909 wasn't crucified in 1920 but today it is very timely and it could not have been done maybe 10 years ago but it can be done today because the poems run out something's happened something's happened there's no longer time for ignorant well maybe it was a prophet maybe he wasn't well I'll just be a good Christian there's no time for that God has provided a way and it's the only way just look at the message title the only provided way there was only one way out of Egypt we are at the end time and I believe as a servant that we are that we are we're just about to cross from this land to another oh boy I can't wait to cross cross I feel like I'm crossing now this flesh you know therefore the time for repentance for a nation has gone I believe that this nation cannot repent I believe that it's crossed the line between mercy and judgment I believe she is toddling in the balance brother Brandon before you start your case how are you going to prove that that's a pretty bold statement to make that she's pastor she's done how are you going to prove this just this that we are guilty for the same sense that God destroyed the world by and the antelopian world we're guilty of the same sins that he destroyed the world and Sodom and Gomorrah and now we got all the same spiritual evidence laying here before us all the same spiritual evidence worldwide known that brought down the mercies of God upon those generations that also to reject have bought judgment so the same thing that brought down mercy to those people that brought down a way of escape at the same time brought down judgment so of his provided a way out he's also bringing a judgment and to not go out you're left with the judgment so at this generation has rejected the same mercy that was spooned and M days God would be unjust to let them get by without judgment so brother Brennan sometimes I know this church is well taught but sometimes people can mess the whole picture of his ministry so as he stood there and choosing of a bride and he was preaching that God's come to take a bride but he wasn't just showing that God's come to take a bride because he takes us to scriptures at the start and he places himself and Genesis with the Eleazar call right to call a bride for Isaac and then he's still talking about the bride and he goes to Revelation was a 21 verse 9 and he places himself here as come hither and I will show thee the let the bride the Lambs wife but that's not the whole part of the scripture because he's also placing himself there and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and that was associated with his ministry because at the same time God sent someone to come and bring the people out he also brought the judgments with him so we can't miss that part of his ministry so God is going to provide an escape for us we know that but we should we should be so happy about that we shouldn't just be so well you know I know that I knew that teen I knew that before I even knew the message God was going to provide a rapture for me yeah but what are you doing about it are you happy about it are you rejoicing about it not one soul be left behind as my prayer just as when the Death Angel was going to sweep over Egypt but had come to a point where the plagues and that land had boiled up to their last plague which was death death you know it's no good to just know that Jesus died to save you today you've actually got to take his blood and apply it to your life because without actually you know it's saying yet Jesus died for me Jesus died as this millions of people in the world today that said Jesus died for me but I don't love you any different than someone that Jesus didn't die for well that doesn't realize it but something's different about us because we take that life that Christ spelled out and he's sent it back to us and now we pick that same life back up and display it and if we don't then we haven't accepted what he sent for us so I started thinking about brother Branham when he was on sunset mountain and that sword come down and struck his hand and I'll just I've just read this quote because I don't want to jump ahead of myself well the Lord was vindicating that the word had come to the hand of his prophet but when I started to search through the Bible at this sort the sword had more than one purpose more than just the purpose of opening of the word what's the attraction on the mountain he said I went up in the canyon climb plumb up where the Eagles was flying around that sounds like a pretty good place for a prophet to go and I was watching some deer standing there I now down to pray and raised up my hands and a sword struck my hand I looked around I thought what's that I'm not beside myself here is that sword in my hand bright shiny glistening in the Sun I said now there's not people and miles of me way up here in this canyon where could that come from I heard a voice say that's the Kings sword I see it a king knights a man with a sword he the voice come back said not a king saud but the king saw the word of the Lord said fear not it's only thy third Pole it's the vindication of your ministry so now the sword has tied to the third Pole so this is the third pole of your ministry okay so now we've got a bit of more of an idea of what the Saudis because we can go back and we can say well what attached to the third pole because there were three great things attached to that and that was the opening of the word the opening of the seals right that was attached to the third pole the other thing happened before the seals but that was the spoken word and that was attached that was one of the great three things attached the third pole and the third thing was preaching to the Lost Souls so there are three things now attached to this and preaching to the lost souls as preaching to those ones that were judged and he continues on this quote and this is where it come back to win that minister was blaspheming the angel of the Lord and this just struck me he's just been gone up there and being given the sword which just put a change in his ministry that just brought down a line where something was going to now change something one of the most major events and the history of the Bible had just taken place and now he comes down off the mountain and carries on here I was going hunting with a friend not knowing what was going to happen and someone called me the one that criticized me about the picture of angel of the Lord that one that took it I had to go to Houston about a son for he was going and death row and was going to be killed in a few days so now this man has that blaspheme their angel of the Lord and you can't always do that and now the death had come on a son I would pick to presume maybe it was his firstborn because and when Moses plagues that the plague was not for the father the plague was for a son for all for his firstborn that's what the play come on and now this plagues come on his son and he met me and threw his arms around me so you'd think the very man that I criticized comes to save my only son and at the end of the story brother Brandon managed to get that boy off death row but that boy still had to serve a life prison sentence and I think today the way we conduct ourselves when someone's fully rejected this message blaspheme that walked away from it yet we can still be approachable because who was the first person they come to when they come into a crisis in their life and yet we can't pray them back into the father to the Lamb's Book of Life but our prayers can be so powerful that maybe we can just reach out and make that that walk for them a little bit easier we should never get to the point where someone we just push someone I'm done with that brother done with him he's blaspheming the Holy Ghost is we've been through a generation that have done that and push people away push churches away lord have mercy on us we can take a lesson out of that amen the sword that come into the hand of brother Branham I believe it's the same sword that was in Joshua's hand as the same sword that was in Daniels hand the same sword that was in all the prophets that carried and went forth the word that was in their hand the weapon that was in their hand I believe that that weapon even became a jawbone because it was the word of the Lord going forth to slay to deliver the same time that seventh angels message is coming to bring forth the hidden mysteries of the book is coming forth a judgment Martin Luther couldn't bring an indictment John Weasley couldn't bring an indictment but the seventh angel messenger could bring an indictment still in the indictment I've got it right to indict this generation I've got a right to do it as a minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ with signs and proving that he is God I've got a right to bring an indictment against this generation because as hard as spearpoints has been right from the pulpits where they have criticized and says don't go out and hear that stuff that's of the devil right and the place that's supposed to love them and the very signs that jesus said would take place the Word of God is sharper than a two-edged sword a word the word at a cerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart has called the devil we're from the pulpit we're from the pulpit and this but I don't even want to go there we have to be so careful we have to be so careful how we handle this so careful how you handle this with your family don't misinterpret it it's already been interpreted and then he carries on here Oh God how can he look down just mercy that's all grace we can't do nothing else but heed for judgment we're already there uh-huh we're already there and yet we can just say well it was a beautiful day today there were beautiful ladies walking down the road beautiful men walking down the road of you're a woman that was wonderful and don't realize that we're under judgment we can't play Church that the days of playing church are gone man has sowed and now he has to reap that's just the law of God and I believe that that the Lord is doing something now and I believe he's starting to warm people he's actually I believe he's starting to raise gifts in the church that will that will alert us and make us aware that this is this is happening now this is coming upon us now as we start to see all these plagues and things that are coming out that's actually bringing the squeeze on the church now and the squeeze is going to bring the best out of the bride say you take a lemon and you want to squeeze that lemon and as you squeeze that lemon all the life of that lemon comes out on the juice and that's for all the goodness as that's the part of the lemon I want then what's left all the flesh just the flesh so what's the squeeze going to do as it comes on it's going to squeeze the life out of us and it's going to leave behind all the flesh and that's what we want I took the scripture last time that I I just felt I wanted to show something and I want to go back through it again and just come down to here at cq9 and he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice saying cause then that have charged over the city to draw near every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which life toward the north every man with a slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them clothed with linen were the riders and corn by a side and they went in and stood before the brazen older this is part tied with the judgment that's coming on the earth now and the glory of God of Israel was gone up from the cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and called to the man clothed of linen which is which had the riders in corn by his side and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for the abominations that be done and and that's there off that should be our attitude right now that we saw and cry not just take pleasure in it but that we actually are ups genuinely upset by the Sun that's out there it should affect you it shouldn't just pass you by when you see a TV come on right and you're out on the mall and there's a TV playing you should be upset with what's been broadcasted through the airwaves because all that is is how pouring through that dimension enter your dimension where your senses can pick it up it should upset you not that you're angry at the people but that you at your you're upset you you just don't want to live in this wicked place anymore because there's a longing in your heart for a better place and to the others he said in mine hearing go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spare neither have you pity slay utterly old young both maids and little children and woman but come not near any man upon whom the matter as the mark and begin at my sanctuary they begin at the ancient men which were before the house now this actually happened right this actually happened in Jerusalem after when the exile happened and Titus came in and all those Jews was and they slew young old everyone brother branham's did that happen that was then that was the scripture being fulfilled and he said that looks exactly what's on the church now that same thing is now fulfilling again at the seeking crucifixion listening to the Feast of Trumpets today and him just hammering down that line and it's scary this this thing's coming upon the earth that is scary I just started to think it's no wonder he wouldn't preach that the Feast of the trumpets the way he wanted to because the things that are going to happen after the bride goes after there's no serpent held up on the pole when the snake bites these things that are going to happen that would shock the people if they knew and it's all in Scripture that's all an open view but begin at my sanctuary because when the squeeze really comes on the squeeze is not coming for the nightclub down the road that's it's going to begin at the sanctuary evening and that's where I want to just show this coming out he's warning us to get ready once the bride leaves and this blood comes off you I tell you when we say all hell is going to break loose well that doesn't even justify the saying it's really going to be a horrible thing so I've been studying Zedekiah after I finished my message I still had ten pages of just Scripture mostly Jeremiah because there's just so much written in the scripture and shadow of what's about to happen now as this judgment comes on the earth and I just want to bring something out on a go to Chronicles 436 verse 11 Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem and did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord and God and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the Prophet and speaking from the mouth of the Lord and he also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar who made him swear by God but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart from turning to the Lord God of Israel now as I read through this I and I've been studying this I start to see this the denominational spirit the Protestant spirit and this King Zedekiah and Rome coming against them and I'm not obeying the prophets as the prophets are coming in he's rebelling both against the prophets but still also rebelling against the Catholic system against Babylon moreover all the chiefs of the priests and the people transgress very much after all the abominations of the heathen and polluted the house of the Lord which he had hallowed in Jerusalem and the Lord God of their father sent to him then by his messengers rising up the times and sending because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place but they mocked the messengers of God and despised his words and misuses prophets until the wrath of the Lord arose against his people till there was no remedy till there was no remedy and we're coming into that time now when the bride leaves there is no remedy there's no remedy if you're not saved when the bride leaves that's it there's no remedy therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees who slew the young men with the sword and the house of the sanctuary and they had no compassion upon young men or maiden or old men or him who stooped for age he gave them all into his hand just another thing backing up the same thing that once the bride leaves and this persecution is going to head straight for the Protestant church and it doesn't matter that they don't care if you're young I don't care if you're old I don't care who you are man or woman that persecution is going to be ruthless you just look at what's happened through the years that's going to be the same thing happen again and all the vessels of the house of God great and small the treasures of the house of the Lord all the treasures of the king and his Prince's all these he brought to Babylon so everything that they had built up all the wealth of their church that's all taken where to Rome all confiscated and you know what you know what this cans greatest for was it was pride yeah and pride will destroy anyone any ministry and if you actually look what this King did he actually invited King Nebuchadnezzar into his house said look look what I've look at this Kingdom I've created come into my house and take a look look at all the vessels look at everything that I've got and through that he opened himself up to the enemy and the enemy said is pretty nice pretty nice you know what I'm going to take all of that through his own pride he destroyed himself it's not that he doesn't have a chance to repent he was given that prophets were sent to him but he rejected them future home of the heavenly bride the same glorious son of God manifested himself in human flesh here on the earth making the promised love exactly blinded to the eyes of the Pharisees and Sadducees Herodians and so forth and today it repeats again the word been manifested just like it was the word knowing the secret of the heart just exactly the way it was as the scripture said which cannot be broken help us God to realize it help us to realize it I pray that I pray lord help us to realize it help these now who raised their hands may they buckle up there buckle up a little tighter showed themselves for the gospel of peace put on the full armor of God pull the helmet down take the shield of faith march forward from today on granted Lord just a little while we'll be summoned then the rapture will come just a little bitty group like Enoch will be taken up then the remnant of the woman's seed that keep the commandments of God Jews had the testimony of Jesus Christ Gentile will be hunted down like dogs and shall give their life for their testimony that's what's going to take place when the bride goes hunted down like dogs horrible place to be left behind and look at what we have now with all this AI because every you're actually being profiled you know that it's rather creepy and we sort of just accept that I have myself it's like well they're watching me I know it but I'm gonna go in a rapture so I really don't get but what if you're not going to go in a rapture they're going to have a big profile of who you are you know what you follow a cult according to the AI they've profiled you completely and it's just like we were in know lemmings other day and I had not even thought about a Microsoft Surface pro and a long time and the Dean goes to me oh look at this one it's a surface book and I see it come over there I said no that's a surface lat book three next morning what pops up on my Google feed advertisement would you like to buy the next Google or Microsoft Surface book three how did it know that I wanted to was interested in that yeah your microphones even listening to you in your phone this is this is what the devil is doing so when you get left behind no one gets left behind right but I'm just saying if you are what's going to happen it's not like you're just going to go hide in a cave somewhere because they're going to know exactly who you are what you're into what you believed you followed a false prophet as far as they're concerned right lord have mercy lord have mercy but as the squeeze is coming on because it's coming on now God's going to display power because he said you wait till the squeeze comes on then you watch the third pole come into action because that spoken word is going to come out when they say you know what maybe it'll happen for a month or so I don't know I really don't know but I'm picking it's not going to be for a long time when that real power is going to come forth and I say you know what you can't buy nothing you know they're trying to make New Zealand the first cashless society because they don't want to experiment so well actually we need to know where you stand we need to know where your values are we your morals are can you recognize with us no I can't recognize with them I bet your alleged CI but that's a cult sorry we can't give you a cat I'm just I'm not prophesying I'm just saying and what's going to happen in the brother branham said that the bride will do the greater things and he preached you know through his ministry they get they'll do more more the correct meanings more but then at the end he says no they're going to do the greater things because where Jesus took a fish and broke it and made more fish but the bride's going to have nothing and brother Andy's going to say Lord I want a bigger eiffel at stake and it's just going to appear and we're gonna eat real good for one month and it ain't gonna cost nothing but you know what look at the plagues that are starting to come now look at this coronavirus you know there's coronavirus and don't think for a minute that it's just some random thing that come off a bet because this has been engineered to bring on the rapture so it's been engineered because china is starting to get too high and mighty this has been engineered even someone just not a Christian was telling me today how this plague was engineered as a weapon a war and now they're saying that they've missed 50% of the cases have gone through unrecognized because they thought it had a 14-day incubation period and now they realize it's got a 30-day incubation period that's all the people they've been letting go out of the facilities that haven't got sick they've retested 30 days later and they're carrying it and the other thing I've just read today about it as they actually realizing that this bug has formed so that has carriers they don't get sick so now people don't get sick from it they travel out of Europe they're carrying the virus someone else gets that they get sick and there's no way that they can detect that bug who engineered that this is the hour we're living and honestly from what I've been looking at on these plagues there is nothing that has nothing on what's coming absolutely nothing look at this and who is God groans our Lord that something will be said tonight or done that will cause the wayward to turn to Christ for we believe and feel pressed in the spirit that great judgments are upon these lands in the last days plagues diseases germs already bred up to be scattered throughout the nations he's prophesying here that these things have been bred up they're not just a natural occurring thing these things have been bred up as weapons of war no doctor know even how to take hold of it Oh God we'll have to believe in divine healing then when nations are breeding germs together to burst them and bombs and millions die in hours of it but I was so thankful hallelujah when the destroying angel went forth you said touch none that has the seal of the Father upon their forehead they are mine oh we're so glad tonight to be under the blood safely protected amen there's a place tonight where you can be safely predicted as you see all these signs coming on this great judgment come on there is a place that you can be safely protected where you do not have to be partakers of those plagues that are coming maybe the musicians can come up and when they come to an end but I'm afraid I'm afraid that sometimes we don't apply apply our faith we don't apply our Christian life the way that we should we just we just become too relaxed about it it's just another day I've got to go to work today to earn more money to pay for tomorrow and that can just become attitude it's just day in day out this is just life tomorrow will be another day we've got to go beyond that we've got to apply our token God has spoken to us and he's told us the kind of life that would be pleasing to God you know I'm afraid that some people don't catch what's taking place why don't we forget what he's spoken to us it seems sometimes we forget because a prophet a prophet you know Esther wanted to know what the King liked right because the the life of Israel depended on Easter getting into that position so she had to know what the King wanted and that's what brother Brennan's done for us he's let us know what the king wants but then time goes on what do we do we forget oh well you know we can't forget what he wants you know wyff's we sang that song make way for liberty and you know I'm a strong believer in Liberty I preached on Liberty I believe in Liberty but just what the Lord's been dealing with you I'm afraid some people use Liberty as an excuse to fulfill the lusts of the flesh because there's Liberty there but the the word always creaks and we've got to make sure we don't use Liberty vice versa to justify the way that we actually feel for ourselves because that's that that puts us in danger of the judgment lord have mercy on us and I believe that that can put you in bondage you say I'm free from bondage I'm justified I have Liberty I'm free from bondage but you don't actually realize you were actually in bondage and using Liberty as an excuse that's that's what I pray against I say Lord what do you want me to wear my wife asked me when she dresses do you think this looks right it's just too tight or is it do you think it looks right and sometimes I might that's pretty you know here brothers know it's pretty hard thing to say well actually that does look too tight but I think we have you know because brother Brennan didn't just wasn't a woman hater he didn't just blast woman he said shame on you man you don't have the guts to stand up so it comes down to the men as well but see we should diligently seek what the king wants today because all everything that we could do you know and we do we dress to please the king the way he wants us to be and be in risk of being called old-fashioned or would we rather and we what are we looking for we want someone to say well it's a pretty nice type you've got on tonight you know is it what wears out we are we wanting our affection to come from because for me I want my affection to come from the word I want it to come from him where I know the Lord's pleased and something I'm what then okay let me say this ever brothers brother would be ashamed to take his wife so we wouldn't want to take his wife because it's not a nice place to take his wife but he would go there himself but he wouldn't take his wife here because it's not a nice place to take his wife then what did Jesus feel like about you going there as his wife see we should think about the places that we go to because he loves you and he wants you to be safely protected and come under their banner under that protection under that token so we should be considering and our own selves what is pleasing to the King what is pleasing to him that's my prayer and I just ask you the question it's your responsibility it's my responsibility as a husband to my wife if you don't have a husband if you don't have a wife it's your responsibility to pray to get down into the spirit of Revelation and say Lord here's my life I lay it down what do you want because I you know we don't want people to lust after us we don't want people to we don't want to become proud we don't want to have pride right there's all these things that we don't want to be we just want to live for God and escape the wrath that's coming on this earth we want to serve Him because we love Him I want to serve him because I love him if there was anything I could do if you could come to me and say brother James you're doing something and it's that's the word says you shouldn't do that or maybe it's not in the word maybe say look the Prophet said that the king like this I would say Lord break that thing out of me do whatever you've got to do because I just want to please him that's all that matters to me is that I place him let us be squeezed I say let the squeeze come on the bright Lord squeeze me and juice me out let all my flesh be left behind put me through the juice pulper Amen that judgment is here and I believe those angels that holding back that the last the last great woe from coming in this it's so hard to hold back that judgment and there trembling and then once they go they're not just going to be let us go and that judgment straight down that's something that's just going to happen in a sudden and that same sudden moment that Brides you know just as judgments coming down the bride's going up just as judgment come down on Israel Moses lead the children out amen let's make sure we were there you know eight people win in the ark but one walked with God I want to be that one I want to be with that one in a million sorry everybody else but that's me if you want to claim that that's you that's fine but I'm claiming that that's me Amen brother Andy I come up and help me but maybe we can maybe we can stand and maybe we'll just sing a song and we'll pray and just say Lord search me search my heart I pledge allegiance to the land search my heart Lord if there's anything in me any wicked way any anything that could just be purged out of me that I would not be in risk of being here for that then just purge it out of me because what is life what am i
