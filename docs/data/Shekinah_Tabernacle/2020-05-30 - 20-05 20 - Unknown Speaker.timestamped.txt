[46:20] when you're there Amen hallelujah
[46:23] it says here as it is written behold I
[46:27] lay in Zion a stumbling stone and rock
[46:31] of offense and whosoever believeth on
[46:34] him shall not be ashamed metal or dead
[46:38] is blessing to the reading of his word
[46:39] you may be seated
[46:40] amen well tonight I just want to
[46:43] minister a little bit on a subject which
[46:46] is called smitten by my first love amen
[46:51] now we can go home because you know that
[46:53] thought there oh man
[46:55] you know I I just I just sat there and
[46:58] the Lord just kind of spoke that title
[47:00] to me because I didn't know what to name
[47:02] it you know I kind of had these things
[47:03] out and and and I know that the stone
[47:09] the stone that has been laid in Zion now
[47:14] I want to say hello Zion hello Brad good
[47:19] morning Shalom to you amen there is a
[47:23] stone that has been laid in you
[47:25] hallelujah and I want to talk about what
[47:28] the stone this this revelation this
[47:31] person what he wants to do and what he
[47:33] has done and what he is doing in your
[47:35] life tonight and what he's doing in has
[47:37] done in your life and what he would
[47:39] desire to have as a result of the stone
[47:42] coming amen that you could be smitten by
[47:45] your first love you know and you know we
[47:47] think of our first lovers as something
[47:49] but really our first lovers him he is
[47:52] our first love and so when we really
[47:54] connected to him you know we're coming
[47:57] back to our first love amen
[47:59] because he is our first love and we when
[48:01] there is a place that we can get to and
[48:04] I don't want to get right ahead of
[48:05] myself I want to build up to this but
[48:07] there's a place
[48:08] that we can get to so intimate so
[48:10] affected so impacted so permeated the
[48:14] big Megaman is a new word for you
[48:16] permeated who knows what permeates it
[48:19] means Amen it's like it's just all over
[48:22] you and all through you and all around
[48:24] you Amen all under you all above you or
[48:26] beside you all-bran
[48:28] everywhere permeated hallelujah Amen
[48:32] well we want to be you know you know
[48:35] when you fall in love with somebody you
[48:37] know you know you you're permeated Amen
[48:39] you're permeated by the feeling Amen you
[48:43] know and I really believe you know we
[48:45] should feel our love for Jesus
[48:48] yes you know there is a divine love that
[48:50] we love him and that cannot be broken
[48:52] and nothing can separate us from us but
[48:54] sometimes we get so busy and things get
[48:57] caught up and maybe we go through such a
[48:59] trial and the scars just make it a bit
[49:01] dull or a bit tired and you've stopped
[49:04] feeling that love that you have for him
[49:06] you know the feeling disappears but we
[49:09] should have a feeling for our God we
[49:11] should have a love a heartfelt religion
[49:15] amen
[49:16] that goes beyond the teaching hallelujah
[49:20] that we should love him and the
[49:22] unbreakable reality of that perfect love
[49:26] that exists within you because the
[49:29] perfect love of God that we would love
[49:32] him and have loved him and that's the
[49:34] love that he loved us before the world
[49:36] began that love it's already in you amen
[49:40] that love exists with him the seed that
[49:44] was placed in your life before you came
[49:46] to understand anything there was a seed
[49:49] inside hallelujah that was waiting to be
[49:52] germinated that was waiting to be to
[49:55] crack open and and and and come forth
[49:57] amen there was a perfect love in there
[50:00] amen hallelujah but that perfect love
[50:03] needs to go beyond just staying right in
[50:05] there it there's a journey there's a
[50:08] growth visa there's a there's it needs
[50:10] to be accumulating amen the profits is
[50:13] that that love would accumulate
[50:15] hallelujah
[50:16] who likes there who enjoys the reality
[50:19] there that this love would
[50:21] accumulate in your life amen and when
[50:23] there's that love accumulates that your
[50:26] faith would accumulate amen and then you
[50:29] will stimulate amen hallelujah amen I
[50:33] think we're gonna talk some jargon
[50:35] tonight amen that maybe only the locals
[50:37] will understand Amen that we will
[50:39] stimulate tonight brother among amen and
[50:42] we will stimulate because of the love of
[50:45] God amen
[50:46] hallelujah but you see and we're going
[50:48] to hit something a little later that
[50:50] which the title kind of encapsulate that
[50:54] we are smitten smitten has anyone heard
[50:59] of the term smitten when you're smitten
[51:02] when you first met your girl or you
[51:04] first met that boy and that one that the
[51:06] Lord revealed to you is your your
[51:08] husband your spouse your wife amen and
[51:11] you just can't get a nothing else man
[51:13] this just that's it everything around
[51:15] you or your thoughts or it's not just
[51:18] hiding somewhere deep down Amen it's not
[51:20] just buried down in some theology
[51:22] hallelujah Amen it goes beyond
[51:24] information of that person's name it
[51:26] goes beyond all of those things and you
[51:28] just saturated Amen well I believe now
[51:32] tonight and I want to encourage you that
[51:34] you can be saturated by the love that
[51:37] already is in you hallelujah that love a
[51:41] man sometimes it just gets so buried
[51:43] down because some other things get tied
[51:45] up in our life and we get caught up and
[51:47] enjoying building this building this
[51:50] natural kingdom building our home making
[51:52] this thing look good making that thing
[51:54] go there helping there and doing all
[51:56] these works and sometimes you know we
[51:59] leave and and as the Prophet would say
[52:01] we mark that love you know the Prophet
[52:06] you know he says this he says I just
[52:08] can't even love my wife the way I really
[52:10] should know not that he doesn't love her
[52:12] he says I can't express the love that I
[52:16] have for my wife the way that I should
[52:19] because I don't want to Mar that love
[52:22] for him amen
[52:25] we may hit that later on hallelujah
[52:29] let's just we work to need you just
[52:31] listen and you can turn and study this
[52:32] later but Isaiah 54 verse 4 it says fear
[52:35] not for thou shalt not be ashamed amen
[52:39] remember who they that believe on him
[52:40] that stone that was laid in silence
[52:43] shall not be ashamed amen and and I want
[52:45] to link that ashamed to Baroness because
[52:48] Baroness in biblical times and in the
[52:51] scripture is a shame it is something
[52:53] wrong right there's something wrong in
[52:56] those biblical times now we're talking
[52:57] about a spiritual Baroness now now we do
[53:00] not want there is something that needs
[53:02] to happen inside the heart something
[53:04] that needs to happen that would cause a
[53:06] person to not be barren amen - to - that
[53:11] they would come forth out of their life
[53:13] a spiritual child amen and so it says
[53:16] here fear not Alleluia there's a reason
[53:20] why it says fear not it's a bit that
[53:22] wherever within the absence of fear
[53:25] faith can operate amen
[53:27] but the only thing to remove fear is
[53:29] perfect love I just want to say it say
[53:32] this love as before all things even
[53:35] before your faith before you believe
[53:38] really believe now before all love
[53:42] divine love
[53:43] I loved him because he first loved me
[53:47] that's the love that's before all things
[53:50] amen and no man can come to me except my
[53:54] father draws him first no man can come
[53:57] to me except my father draws him first
[53:59] so there's a love these are in a drawing
[54:02] happens and then the goodness of God
[54:04] starts to come over your life and now
[54:06] when we think about these things you
[54:07] know you just think about it and get it
[54:10] into a meditation cycle in your and your
[54:12] thoughts and you start meditating on how
[54:14] good he is you start meditating on the
[54:16] on the odds of you being a true believer
[54:19] that as Holy Ghost filled that as being
[54:22] a coming to their full adoption that is
[54:25] being sanctified and cleansed by fire
[54:27] and being rapture ready in this world
[54:30] right now and you think my where did I
[54:33] come from
[54:34] what did I it was man and how much how
[54:40] many times before you met him did he
[54:41] save you from death how many near-death
[54:43] experiences that he saved you from
[54:45] because he's because he's got a purpose
[54:47] for you
[54:48] and when we start to ponder over these
[54:51] things and the boisterous seas the
[54:54] tumultuous battles and all those things
[54:56] and he brings you through every single
[54:59] one and you think about these things and
[55:03] the Prophet says it will bring perfect
[55:05] love at what he says how can you not
[55:08] perfectly love him when you start to
[55:11] ponder over these things amen so there
[55:13] is a real virtue and meditating on the
[55:17] word and meditating on what he's done
[55:19] for you amen
[55:21] on a personal level now the meditation
[55:24] that's glorious and I'm not going to say
[55:27] don't do it but to meditate on the word
[55:29] and see all of us are mad and see how it
[55:31] all joins together as good wonderful but
[55:34] what about the personal how does it
[55:37] affect me what has he done for me what
[55:39] has he done for my family what has he
[55:41] done for my my my loved ones a man what
[55:44] is he doing for this and part of that's
[55:46] when it really starts to have an effect
[55:48] hey man so he says fear not for thou
[55:50] shalt not be ashamed neither be thou
[55:53] confounded for thou shalt not be put to
[55:56] shame for thou shalt forget the shame of
[55:59] thy youth and shalt not remember the
[56:02] reproach of thy widowhood anymore for
[56:05] thy maker as thy husband the Lord of
[56:09] Hosts is his name and a redeemer the
[56:11] Holy One of Israel just say his name
[56:14] Jesus that's his name hallelujah what a
[56:20] beautiful name it is nothing compares to
[56:23] this nothing can stand against the name
[56:26] of Jesus hallelujah oh my that could
[56:30] evoke a worship right now amen
[56:33] that name hallelujah the god of the
[56:37] whole earth shall be he be called you
[56:39] know and I and I really pray because
[56:42] remember you are a little mini earth
[56:43] you're a micro earth let's put it that
[56:46] way you know you're a whole ecosystem in
[56:48] your own right you're a little earth
[56:49] made of clay and then you've got you've
[56:52] got the earth went through water blood
[56:54] and that's going to have a fiery baptism
[56:56] you have gone through water blood in a
[56:58] fiery baptism a man
[56:59] the earth will one day have a new heaven
[57:01] and a new earth come down you're getting
[57:03] your new heaven and new earth soon amen
[57:05] you're gonna have an agoraphobe body
[57:07] come down on you soon amen and when you
[57:09] start to think about these things you
[57:11] think oh God oh my whole little bit need
[57:15] to be real Oh God amen hallelujah amen
[57:21] hallelujah yes the god of the whole
[57:25] earth let him be the God of your whole
[57:27] earth amen amen
[57:28] you see he rules inside you but you see
[57:31] there has to be now there there's a war
[57:33] going on it's not just he comes in and
[57:37] it's all nice bitter roses no no no no
[57:40] no way because how does the character
[57:42] get developed with them that's why he
[57:45] didn't convert your old human spirit and
[57:47] your flesh otherwise it'd be too easy
[57:49] you just have full dominion and you'll
[57:52] be doing whatever you'll do in the
[57:53] Millenium you'll be already doing anyway
[57:55] there'll be no resistance no enemies no
[57:57] squatters no troubles but there has to
[58:00] be a Time of Troubles a time of
[58:02] suffering a time of humiliation has
[58:05] brother been preached you know and and
[58:08] that's not a negative humiliation right
[58:09] they because that can be classed as a
[58:12] negative thing but it's actually a
[58:13] positive humility a positive suffering
[58:16] that will be found in the likeness of us
[58:19] amen
[58:20] if he had to go through it he the second
[58:24] Adam the new human race that was born
[58:27] had to suffer and learn obedience my the
[58:31] man Christ Jesus had to learn obedience
[58:34] I don't understand that to be honest I
[58:38] really don't let's just the best it
[58:40] blows my mind but he has to he had to
[58:42] and he did and he grew an appreciation
[58:45] and was able now to understand you to
[58:49] understand what you're going through and
[58:51] he took it and you know what I'll tell
[58:54] you what motivated him love divine love
[58:59] divine love motivated him to stand there
[59:03] and handle every nine tailwhip on his
[59:08] back
[59:09] the vinyl of motivated him to not
[59:12] crumble on the ground under the pain as
[59:15] his flesh fell to the earth as he
[59:18] suffered uncontrollably unmercifully
[59:21] more than any man or human ever suffered
[59:25] hallelujah
[59:26] he suffered more and he took it and I
[59:29] tell you it was love divine love that
[59:31] motivated him if that can motivate him
[59:34] to do that what will it do for you
[59:36] hallelujah when we can now take these
[59:41] tools you could say that the prophet has
[59:45] given us and the Scriptures has shown us
[59:47] to be able to we want to spur the love
[59:51] in our life you know because it's there
[59:54] you can't be separated from it but what
[59:57] the devil wants to do he wants you to
[1:00:00] get troubled in your spirit troubled in
[1:00:02] your flesh so that your so it's all just
[1:00:05] turmoil ash and tumultuous and you know
[1:00:07] and you get all upset and then you start
[1:00:10] turning to other streams of comfort
[1:00:12] because there's faster access to
[1:00:15] satisfaction but then the satisfaction
[1:00:18] never lasts and never lasts whatever it
[1:00:22] is that you would turn to but divine
[1:00:25] love if that can motivate a king to
[1:00:28] stand there and take that my divine love
[1:00:33] motivated him to receive every spit
[1:00:37] every thorn and his head every mock
[1:00:40] mockery it motivated him hallelujah if
[1:00:47] that love is so powerful and so simple
[1:00:50] and so strong that it could motivate him
[1:00:53] to take every hit to take all the shame
[1:00:56] to take all the reproach to hang naked
[1:00:59] on a cross oh my what will it do for us
[1:01:04] love is the most powerful motive that it
[1:01:08] is that in existence divine love love is
[1:01:12] the motive that drives the kingdom of
[1:01:14] God it's the key economic or whatever
[1:01:20] that
[1:01:21] the currency but the you know it's like
[1:01:25] a generator of life of action of of
[1:01:28] expression of of action divine love and
[1:01:32] we're going to live in a kingdom that's
[1:01:34] all about that amen
[1:01:37] it's gonna be out here but first let me
[1:01:41] encourage you let it be inside you first
[1:01:44] now let the whole economy inside you
[1:01:47] because there is an economy within you
[1:01:50] amen
[1:01:51] it's a civilization that's happening
[1:01:53] inside you amen
[1:01:55] it's not happening out here you it will
[1:01:56] one day and we'll be with them amen
[1:01:58] he'll take over he'll do the same thing
[1:02:01] out here that he's doing inside you now
[1:02:03] but the profit now if I get to it the
[1:02:06] profit gives us some keys to to to work
[1:02:10] not work it up we don't want to work up
[1:02:12] some emotional thing but but it needs to
[1:02:16] be that's like a relationship you need
[1:02:19] to work on it yeah you know you've got
[1:02:21] to actually give the Lord something to
[1:02:22] work with brother Branham says God will
[1:02:25] energize the vine but you got to do the
[1:02:28] work you got to do it you got to go and
[1:02:30] do it he'll energize you he'll give you
[1:02:31] the spirit he'll give you the anointing
[1:02:32] he'll give you the ability or give you
[1:02:34] the ghost he puts it all in there but
[1:02:36] there has to be an action on our part
[1:02:38] that's going to have fruit that's
[1:02:43] entering an and yielding getting still
[1:02:46] in saying Lord what is it what is it
[1:02:48] today Lord you know because this whole
[1:02:52] society is designed to busy us and get
[1:02:54] us caught up then we just have to say
[1:02:57] Lord you know and we get we get back
[1:02:59] into that channel and my my you know
[1:03:04] I've been so touched the Lord actually
[1:03:05] I'm taking a lot of faith here because
[1:03:09] you know I like to have notes and I like
[1:03:12] to have it mapped out but the Lord kind
[1:03:13] of basically was like you're not having
[1:03:15] notes for the service no notes and when
[1:03:19] he sung everybody wails like Lord you
[1:03:22] just want to speak you know he just
[1:03:24] wants to i've got quotes and that's it
[1:03:25] and some scriptures but no notes okay so
[1:03:28] Amen hallelujah it was a battle it was a
[1:03:33] battle man because you just
[1:03:34] you get inspiration could you pondering
[1:03:36] over these things and you're like wow
[1:03:38] that's amazing
[1:03:39] I just got to write it down no no
[1:03:40] they're not allowed to write it down I
[1:03:43] always use because you know when you're
[1:03:44] leading up to preaching or you're just
[1:03:46] developing thoughts and so you get
[1:03:48] something you like oh I gotta write that
[1:03:49] down
[1:03:50] otherwise you know you forget it and
[1:03:52] then the law was like hey I'm beyond
[1:03:53] that I'm greater than your memory amen
[1:03:57] let him speak hello let me speak
[1:04:01] hallelujah Amen hallelujah
[1:04:05] said the for the Lord has called thee
[1:04:07] for thy maker his own husband and the
[1:04:10] Lord of Hosts is his name and thy
[1:04:11] Redeemer the Holy One of Israel the god
[1:04:14] of the whole earth shall he be called
[1:04:15] amen for the Lord has called thee as a
[1:04:19] woman Forsaken and grieved and spirit
[1:04:25] that's our old husband that we were
[1:04:27] married to forsaken a man grieved and
[1:04:31] spirit the spirit that realm that causes
[1:04:35] all the trouble in our life all those
[1:04:37] emotions and memories and affections and
[1:04:39] all that stuff causes trouble right and
[1:04:42] man but I believe and I'll read
[1:04:44] something that that can also be smitten
[1:04:48] you can let you know you can get solid
[1:04:51] love with him hallelujah let me just say
[1:04:53] it right now you can be so in love with
[1:04:55] him that your spirit just as smitten and
[1:04:58] it just can't doesn't need anything it
[1:05:00] doesn't need to go and last after
[1:05:02] they're all gone
[1:05:02] it's just so smitten not converted
[1:05:05] smitten hello yeah they're not smitten
[1:05:08] by law you can't smite it by law it just
[1:05:10] it aggravates your spirit she will find
[1:05:13] a way around it and you'll end up doing
[1:05:14] something else but if there's a love so
[1:05:16] strong if there's a love so you're
[1:05:19] smitten
[1:05:20] oh my and I'll tell you now your spirit
[1:05:24] is we win in the subconscious series
[1:05:25] when your spirit controls all the
[1:05:27] emotional feelings and and all their
[1:05:30] chemicals in your blood and all of the
[1:05:31] hormones in your life and all the cycles
[1:05:34] and all other Naturals things moods and
[1:05:36] all about right well if she's so smitten
[1:05:39] by love then you're gonna be feeling
[1:05:40] something you're gonna be in an
[1:05:42] atmosphere and when you hop out the car
[1:05:45] and you take your head off and walk up
[1:05:46] to brother Jack Moore's house
[1:05:48] and his daughter looks out the window
[1:05:49] start crying because of the atmosphere
[1:05:52] that's around you because the love
[1:05:55] that's inside you has an about it has an
[1:05:59] elder has an ability to be expressed you
[1:06:03] know because you're so often we find
[1:06:05] because of whatever experience we have
[1:06:08] and we get born again and we have a
[1:06:11] wonderful time for a while and then all
[1:06:12] of those troubles start setting in and
[1:06:14] it starts going like this in the devil
[1:06:16] weed he just wants to dumb you right
[1:06:18] down and told you no you're just sitting
[1:06:21] there and you're just going about the
[1:06:22] the week and you're doing those things
[1:06:24] and every now and again you have a nice
[1:06:26] little time and and then a convention
[1:06:28] happens and maybe you break out for a
[1:06:29] while and then it just comes back down
[1:06:31] again and he says come on come on
[1:06:34] just sleep now you know and this is this
[1:06:37] is this is what happened because you he
[1:06:39] doesn't want God's love to be so to
[1:06:44] smite you and your spirit and your flesh
[1:06:47] you see in your spirit there is five
[1:06:50] senses affections conscience memories
[1:06:57] reasons and imaginations five okay and
[1:07:01] in your flesh there are a see touch feel
[1:07:04] smell in here okay Tim senses right
[1:07:10] these are ten kings that when you were
[1:07:14] born on this earth come into this world
[1:07:16] speaking lies these ten kings ruled you
[1:07:20] and they will still try and rule you
[1:07:23] the Romans sixes or men I might read it
[1:07:28] actually just read them because there's
[1:07:31] a war and your flesh is going to try a
[1:07:33] revolution all the time the devil's
[1:07:36] going to try and find a way in he's a
[1:07:38] he's a he's a master of leverage and he
[1:07:41] looks for things and leverages you know
[1:07:43] who knows what leverages you use it as
[1:07:45] against someone you see a weakness and
[1:07:47] you'll use that to get leverage or say
[1:07:50] you're trying to strike a deal and you
[1:07:51] see that they want something you see
[1:07:53] there's a need and so you'll use that as
[1:07:55] leverage to get what you to convey your
[1:07:58] sales pitch or the devil will see are
[1:08:01] that person
[1:08:01] it's got a weakness there and that
[1:08:03] happened over there the other day he's
[1:08:05] got leverage right and he uses that as
[1:08:07] leverage to get in by the thoughts and
[1:08:09] by as fiery dots and this flesh these
[1:08:13] tin kings tin Kings
[1:08:16] that when you were born and a Babylonian
[1:08:19] rule that Babylonian ol nature then old
[1:08:23] husband that one that's we were under
[1:08:25] control of until the Lord came and they
[1:08:28] men you know the Lord went down into the
[1:08:30] hell and he kicked out the devil and
[1:08:32] took his keys Amen well he came down
[1:08:34] into your hell and took the devil and
[1:08:36] kicked that snake out of your heart and
[1:08:38] took the keys amen
[1:08:39] gave you eternal life hallelujah oh my
[1:08:44] let's let's read this Romans 6 I think
[1:08:53] it's verse 6 no it's not
[1:08:57] here it is Romans 6:15 it says here what
[1:09:02] then shall we sin because we are not
[1:09:04] under the law but under grace
[1:09:06] god forbid know ye not that to whom ye
[1:09:09] yield yourselves servants to obey his
[1:09:11] servants ye are to whom you obey whether
[1:09:14] of sin unto death or of obedience unto
[1:09:19] righteousness but God be thanked that ye
[1:09:23] were the servants of sin but ye have
[1:09:26] obeyed from the heart that form of
[1:09:28] doctrine which was delivered you being
[1:09:31] then made free from sin you became
[1:09:33] servants of righteousness
[1:09:35] I speak after the manner of men because
[1:09:38] of the infirmity of your flesh because
[1:09:41] it's unconverted there's five senses but
[1:09:44] remember these are sixth sense right
[1:09:47] brother Brown says you get six senses
[1:09:48] faith and that sixth sense needs to take
[1:09:52] absolute benevolent leadership over
[1:09:55] those other senses now if you're an
[1:10:00] illegal istic form you will take
[1:10:02] malevolent you have to look this up but
[1:10:05] malevolent and benevolent leadership is
[1:10:07] the polar opposite to each other
[1:10:08] now they're both powerful leadership
[1:10:10] styles right they both have power and
[1:10:13] they both can rule the
[1:10:15] one rules with malevolence and law and
[1:10:17] hardship and uses draconian measures to
[1:10:20] control and this one here this one rules
[1:10:23] with love gentleness power and peace
[1:10:26] both have power both are very powerful
[1:10:29] forms of leadership but we need
[1:10:31] benevolent leadership all right
[1:10:34] because benevolent leadership allows the
[1:10:36] spirit to move it allows the people to
[1:10:39] be free to express failure so that they
[1:10:44] can be healed
[1:10:44] hey man and all many things but that
[1:10:48] this is the key to benevolent leadership
[1:10:51] and you will tell when there's
[1:10:53] benevolent leadership in a country in a
[1:10:55] person's life and a church and a you
[1:10:57] know you name it wherever it may be and
[1:10:58] you can tell where this malevolent
[1:11:00] leadership and I could it could be
[1:11:02] epitomized in North Korea right there is
[1:11:05] malevolent leadership that's a bad form
[1:11:08] of leadership and that's because Satan
[1:11:10] this what Satan does that's his style
[1:11:13] that's the way that he is he's like that
[1:11:16] and he wants to rule our life like there
[1:11:17] and he'll come in and it'll look real
[1:11:20] benevolent it'll look real nice it'll
[1:11:23] look like you're getting liberated but
[1:11:25] he really wants to get you so that
[1:11:27] you're under him draconian Lee here bad
[1:11:32] but benevolent leadership over because
[1:11:37] that benevolent leadership needs to be
[1:11:40] manifested and within our own life and
[1:11:43] how we as a person that is filled with
[1:11:47] the Holy Ghost that is walking with God
[1:11:50] and is about to be raptured how are we
[1:11:52] rolling over our own spirit how are we
[1:11:56] rolling over our flesh and we pushing it
[1:12:00] down under the law are we trying our
[1:12:02] best are we paying the commandments
[1:12:05] because it's the right thing to do are
[1:12:06] we singing songs and getting anointed
[1:12:10] and speaking faith because it's the
[1:12:11] right thing to do or be under a
[1:12:15] malevolence in our life and our spirit
[1:12:18] is actually crying for freedom it's
[1:12:20] crying to be expressed because it's not
[1:12:23] under the love it's not smitten by love
[1:12:26] and I believe that it's
[1:12:28] that will smite your spirit to keep you
[1:12:31] in a good place now I don't mean it
[1:12:33] doesn't mean you're going to not fail
[1:12:34] ever again but that's a good the love of
[1:12:37] God can do amazing things the love of
[1:12:41] God amen
[1:12:43] hallelujah hallelujah I need to get to
[1:12:50] this but I speak after the manner of men
[1:12:52] because of the infirmity of your flesh
[1:12:54] for as you have yielded your members
[1:12:56] servants to uncleanness and unto
[1:12:58] iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield
[1:13:01] your members servants to righteousness
[1:13:03] unto holiness sorry I forgot I need to
[1:13:07] go back I'm gonna go back a little bit
[1:13:09] because I think I missed something here
[1:13:11] I think it's verse 8 no here it is verse
[1:13:18] 6 it's not at six knowing that our old
[1:13:21] man knowing this that our old man is
[1:13:24] crucified with him that the body of sin
[1:13:28] might be destroyed that henceforth we
[1:13:32] should not serve sin that were destroyed
[1:13:34] us to be made dormant it's to be
[1:13:36] rendered ineffective or unable to like a
[1:13:40] dormant volcano as not it's there and
[1:13:44] it's got potential to riot erupt but it
[1:13:47] doesn't erupt because there's been this
[1:13:48] dormant right now that is that's what
[1:13:50] that word destroyed there when you take
[1:13:52] it back to the Greek that the body of
[1:13:54] sin might be destroyed or might be made
[1:13:56] dormant because a king has entered your
[1:13:58] life and he is able now to administer
[1:14:01] leadership in your life so that you as a
[1:14:04] soul can rise up in Dominion now here
[1:14:08] that's where you come to a crossroads
[1:14:10] and you light now help what is the way
[1:14:12] to to overcome myself and you know we
[1:14:16] all go through a legalistic phase and we
[1:14:18] might even have legalistic cycles from
[1:14:21] being liberal too legalistic liberal to
[1:14:23] leave you listed but there is a balance
[1:14:24] there's a center there's a
[1:14:25] middle-of-the-road
[1:14:26] and I believe it's divine love truly
[1:14:29] divine love and you know this is the
[1:14:33] good thing right for us now we are under
[1:14:36] the ministry of the capstone so we have
[1:14:38] the full measure of divine love
[1:14:41] to come down upon us like no other
[1:14:44] Church ages ever head hallelujah no man
[1:14:47] and so we have an advantage now and the
[1:14:50] reason is because we're going to be
[1:14:51] raptured out of here hallelujah amen and
[1:14:55] so that's why we've been given open book
[1:14:58] divine access to perfect love in the
[1:15:01] full measure of it all amen and that
[1:15:04] divine love is already within you
[1:15:06] because you're born again and if you're
[1:15:08] not born again the altar is open amen
[1:15:12] hallelujah it's always open the altar is
[1:15:15] always open whether you're at home
[1:15:17] Church work wherever it may be the altar
[1:15:20] is open and you can be born again the
[1:15:24] Lord is waiting hallelujah that he may
[1:15:27] reign righteousness upon the fellow
[1:15:29] ground sometimes the ground gets a bit
[1:15:34] hard it needs to be broken up this is
[1:15:40] that in the book Hosea I think Hosea 12
[1:15:44] 13 or something but wake up the fellow
[1:15:47] ground he may come and reign
[1:15:49] righteousness upon you oh my let's just
[1:15:59] continue reading this romans 6 here now
[1:16:02] if we be dead with Christ for he that is
[1:16:07] dead is free from sin now if we be dead
[1:16:09] with Christ we believe that we shall
[1:16:11] also live with him knowing that Christ
[1:16:14] being raised from the dead dies no more
[1:16:16] death had no more dominion over him
[1:16:20] foreign that he died he died unto sin
[1:16:23] once but and that he liveth he liveth
[1:16:26] unto God and here's the one I wanted to
[1:16:28] visit living as the one says likewise
[1:16:31] Rick can you yourselves did indeed unto
[1:16:34] sin but alive unto God through Jesus
[1:16:36] Christ our Lord let not sin therefore
[1:16:40] reign in your mortal body it wants to it
[1:16:46] wants to right
[1:16:49] and if and if there's a lack of it of
[1:16:51] God in your life if there's a lack of
[1:16:54] anointing in your life if there's a lack
[1:16:56] of fellowship in your life if there's a
[1:16:58] lack of free-flowing
[1:17:00] connection to the divine love of God
[1:17:03] then your flesh is going to look for
[1:17:06] something it's gonna start one wandering
[1:17:08] and you're gonna start needing other
[1:17:10] things but we have access divine access
[1:17:14] to the divine love of God behold I lay
[1:17:18] in Zion a stumbling stone a rock of
[1:17:20] offense but to them that believe to be
[1:17:24] freed from shame that they could bring
[1:17:27] forth life that they could come into a
[1:17:29] love relationship hallelujah and it's
[1:17:33] that love that will connect you we can
[1:17:37] take this down if you want but this is
[1:17:38] that love that will connect you to the
[1:17:41] supernatural the manifestation of Jesus
[1:17:45] Christ is connected you're connected to
[1:17:49] that by divine love because he says this
[1:17:51] and it this is where this whole thing
[1:17:53] came from for me it says if you love me
[1:17:56] you'll keep my Commandments and I will
[1:17:59] manifest myself to you I will manifest
[1:18:04] myself to you that word manifest is a
[1:18:07] powerful word it means to reveal openly
[1:18:10] to to completely unveil who wants Jesus
[1:18:15] to be convenient to them he says I will
[1:18:20] love them and my father will love you
[1:18:22] and we will make our abode with you
[1:18:25] hallelujah he that loveth me he that
[1:18:31] agape me keepeth my Commandments now you
[1:18:39] know we can keep his Commandments
[1:18:40] alright but what is driving us what
[1:18:43] economy malevolence or benevolence and
[1:18:47] we're going to is it going to be is it
[1:18:50] he that sees that it's a good thing to
[1:18:52] do and it's going to make his life
[1:18:53] better and he's getting not go to hell
[1:18:55] keeps my Commandments or he that loveth
[1:18:58] me and so I see I see this and I'm like
[1:19:02] Lord okay here is to me is like this is
[1:19:06] the a very major key in our walk with
[1:19:09] the Lord that this love and I thought so
[1:19:13] much about it and prayed about it and
[1:19:14] he's unfolded many things and I've got
[1:19:20] and we'll move into the story of
[1:19:23] Nebuchadnezzar's dream and we'll see
[1:19:25] that the stone oh my but stone
[1:19:29] hallelujah you know when he comes down
[1:19:32] into our life you know what is he doing
[1:19:35] now you know daily bikinis with
[1:19:36] streamers encompassing an age it's
[1:19:38] encompassing the end of time it's
[1:19:39] encompassing you know major huge
[1:19:42] high-level visions for thousands of
[1:19:45] years but how does that affect me we
[1:19:48] need to make this personal
[1:19:49] this needs to connect we're at home
[1:19:52] right in our heart and it does and it
[1:19:56] has and it is and there's still things
[1:20:00] going on but what does it do you see the
[1:20:02] stone that the builders rejected you
[1:20:06] know I was so excited when Ben was
[1:20:08] preaching a because I'm studying this
[1:20:09] stuff deeply right now you know and
[1:20:11] really
[1:20:11] meditating on and he brings out that
[1:20:13] scripture there about the stone and Zion
[1:20:16] you know man you know I was just like
[1:20:18] man it's powerful real powerful because
[1:20:21] the stone Amen what he does is he comes
[1:20:24] he's cut out without hands and in the
[1:20:27] stone this capstone this headstone
[1:20:30] divine love comes and it strikes the
[1:20:32] feet of that image of the clay and the
[1:20:35] iron right the ten Kings the ten toes
[1:20:40] where does it hits the toes amen
[1:20:43] so here you have this image the stone
[1:20:47] that comes in and says it strikes it and
[1:20:49] then it breaks that image that
[1:20:51] Babylonian power that thing that's ruled
[1:20:53] and draconian measures over the earth
[1:20:56] and black horse rider white bread pale
[1:20:59] whatever all those powers that are
[1:21:01] deceived man and destroyed souls and and
[1:21:03] and always pharmaceutical evil people
[1:21:07] that try and control and greed and fear
[1:21:10] over the earth and keep people from God
[1:21:12] all of that
[1:21:14] the influence of it the power of it the
[1:21:17] stone comes and it spikes it and it
[1:21:20] blows it up hallelujah until it's blown
[1:21:23] away by the wind and that's what the
[1:21:26] Lord thinks of all of that and that's
[1:21:27] the power of our God and he will do that
[1:21:30] that's going to happen this earth is
[1:21:33] going to be rid of that Babylonian
[1:21:35] nightmare that nightmares gonna lose all
[1:21:38] is gonna be cast into the lake of fire
[1:21:40] amen with the false prophet amen and
[1:21:43] then we'll live happily ever after
[1:21:46] amen that's my favorite that's not a
[1:21:49] fairy tale but that's my whatever
[1:21:51] bedtime story
[1:21:52] that's a good bedtime story that's the
[1:21:54] real one amen huh that's what the gospel
[1:21:56] does that's our future
[1:21:59] and I said hey we think about that and
[1:22:01] we meditate on that you see and he's
[1:22:04] going to do that to the earth and to the
[1:22:07] age and to the dispensation but what
[1:22:10] about you now what's happening what were
[1:22:13] you born inside what was inside your
[1:22:14] heart brother Branham Caesar was a snake
[1:22:16] was born in there and it was
[1:22:18] overshadowed this predestined seed that
[1:22:21] was in there and that seed was lying in
[1:22:24] your heart dormant and then amen now
[1:22:29] under this ministry of Malachi 4 and
[1:22:32] under the the ministry and the
[1:22:35] revelation of the Son of Man
[1:22:37] here comes divine love himself at the
[1:22:40] end of time because it's a day that in
[1:22:43] the church those ten Kings need to be
[1:22:47] smitten because there's a people that
[1:22:50] need to get dominion over this bird and
[1:22:53] over their flesh once and for all but
[1:22:57] there's only one thing that can really
[1:22:58] give them a thorough consistent Dominion
[1:23:02] that's that smiting style that is you've
[1:23:06] got to be smitten amen
[1:23:08] now your heart smitten because he came
[1:23:10] in and he's coming and he comes in and
[1:23:13] he comes in his smite set image and he
[1:23:16] gets the devil and he gives him a good
[1:23:18] cook and he removes them from your life
[1:23:20] amen and smites those 10 kings of your
[1:23:24] life
[1:23:25] fights them so that you're smitten and I
[1:23:29] and I was like well that's awesome Lord
[1:23:31] I love that it's kind of like a vision
[1:23:34] right and it's explaining what's
[1:23:36] happening on a high level personally in
[1:23:38] our life right that's high level but how
[1:23:40] does it how does this really be
[1:23:44] practical how am I going to benefit from
[1:23:47] this because I'm still feeling like I'm
[1:23:49] failing all the time too much right and
[1:23:51] I'm still going this and then these
[1:23:54] things happen but what how does this
[1:23:57] become a practical thing in my life
[1:24:02] the smiting of that love in your heart
[1:24:08] now there's a relationship there is an
[1:24:12] accumulation that needs to take place
[1:24:13] right so that the love that's inside you
[1:24:17] and I I just see it all at the start
[1:24:19] anyway but I'll say it all again I see
[1:24:21] it at all I couldn't hold it in that
[1:24:25] love needs to just I can't stay in there
[1:24:28] has to go out it hits to start affecting
[1:24:31] you amen
[1:24:34] let me read something but just remember
[1:24:37] that we'll come back to this let not sin
[1:24:41] reign in your mortal body that you
[1:24:44] should obey it in the lusts thereof and
[1:24:51] remember the key is not whether you let
[1:24:54] it or not it's with that's how even
[1:24:57] brother Branham says you notice he's
[1:24:58] like you know when he's preaching the
[1:25:02] Seventh Seal he's like he that he opens
[1:25:04] up a whole new idea of not when he's
[1:25:06] coming but how right cuz it's like Nike
[1:25:11] we know he's coming right everyone knows
[1:25:13] you're coming no one knows the day or
[1:25:14] the hour right and that can be debated
[1:25:17] all those things right but but how and
[1:25:20] when you realize when he reveals to you
[1:25:22] how that is like the absolute key and
[1:25:26] we're talking about it right now you
[1:25:28] know we're talking about that smiting
[1:25:30] stone coming down into your life to
[1:25:32] break Babylon out of you Babylon is
[1:25:35] still right now at
[1:25:38] that's a process right we see Daniel
[1:25:40] Nebuchadnezzar's vision and the
[1:25:41] interpretation and it all just kind of
[1:25:43] happens right and it's all just gone but
[1:25:46] that's not exactly how it would flesh
[1:25:47] out right it would be a process it would
[1:25:50] happen over years it'll happen over a
[1:25:52] lifetime
[1:25:53] it'll happen once he comes into your
[1:25:55] heart and I say let the one that just
[1:26:00] fall in love with him I'm trying to just
[1:26:02] say it I'm trying to and it's gonna all
[1:26:04] kind of unfold oh let me read a few
[1:26:06] things but just fall in love with them
[1:26:10] lay everything else aside until you have
[1:26:14] divine love there's a lot of
[1:26:16] responsibilities in our life a lot of
[1:26:17] other things these ministries there's
[1:26:19] all the gifts there's all the things
[1:26:21] that the Lord wants us to do but without
[1:26:23] divine love we are nothing it has to be
[1:26:29] motivated by divine love it has to be
[1:26:31] the very start of all motivation in your
[1:26:34] life and we really it's like okay if the
[1:26:38] Prophet says lay aside everything not
[1:26:41] most things but everything until you get
[1:26:44] divine love then I believe that there's
[1:26:46] a strong admonishing statement for us to
[1:26:50] really take heed to what a prophet is
[1:26:52] telling us and say you know what he's
[1:26:57] really like strongly Caesar and he says
[1:26:59] it over again he'd be emphasizes this so
[1:27:02] a lot lay aside everything until you
[1:27:06] have divine love until you can love
[1:27:08] everybody even the ones that are
[1:27:10] unlovable or whatever it may be even
[1:27:12] your worst enemies I love because what
[1:27:16] is that that is subduing your 10 Kings
[1:27:22] now you're never going to read them
[1:27:26] until you take a body change they're
[1:27:28] going to trouble but if there is such an
[1:27:32] atmosphere in your life because you're
[1:27:34] falling in love with them
[1:27:35] you take you've gone back to the
[1:27:37] rudiments of your relationship with God
[1:27:39] and said Lord I really want this you
[1:27:43] know I've done all of us and I've done
[1:27:45] all that and I've been there and I've
[1:27:47] fallen down here and I've shared my
[1:27:49] conscience there and I've gone back down
[1:27:50] that route and
[1:27:51] come back here and I've had that revival
[1:27:53] beer but Lord what about this love Lord
[1:27:58] I want this love to be so strong in my
[1:28:00] life Oh Lord I desire this love father
[1:28:03] to permeate my being I don't just want
[1:28:06] to hear and know about it Lord but I
[1:28:07] want to feel this love I want this love
[1:28:10] to be around me all the time I don't
[1:28:12] just want it to be something and like
[1:28:14] talk to me or I try and work it up alone
[1:28:16] let this love constantly and
[1:28:19] consistently radiate in my life so that
[1:28:24] my spirits become happy my human nature
[1:28:28] becomes satisfied by this love because
[1:28:31] it's perfect love and it's everything
[1:28:33] that we could ever want and brother
[1:28:35] Brown says is no human word or a way to
[1:28:39] describe how good it is and we have this
[1:28:42] like portion of it now has the down
[1:28:44] payment as the earnest of our
[1:28:45] inheritance the Holy Spirit divine love
[1:28:48] he went up there and beyond the curtain
[1:28:50] of time and he felt it and it's in a
[1:28:52] higher measure whether it was the full
[1:28:55] measure or whether it was a higher
[1:28:56] whatever it may be it was a lot stronger
[1:28:59] than here but you see when we get the
[1:29:01] Holy Ghost he comes down into our heart
[1:29:03] he comes down into our life he comes to
[1:29:05] smite that image Easter he comes to
[1:29:07] destroy Babylonian influence out of our
[1:29:10] life the power of it but he but you see
[1:29:13] when you receive the Holy Ghost he comes
[1:29:15] down to rule he comes down to teacher he
[1:29:18] comes down to bring you up he comes down
[1:29:21] so that within your life there is a need
[1:29:24] in it condition there is a you topic
[1:29:26] society going on inside you there is a
[1:29:29] place inside you that you could
[1:29:31] fellowship with them and that now that
[1:29:33] fellowship needs to have fruit that
[1:29:36] fellowship needs to go beyond theology
[1:29:38] it needs to go beyond works it needs to
[1:29:40] go beyond the in all performance and its
[1:29:43] go beyond everything you do and say but
[1:29:46] it needs to be reality it needs to have
[1:29:50] a fruit and unfertile seed and in seed
[1:29:53] as life that's how deep it needs to go
[1:29:57] and needs to get down deep inside
[1:30:00] amen and it can it's simple these things
[1:30:04] I'm saying to you they're very very
[1:30:07] simple but the Branham says this and the
[1:30:19] law having a shadow and 1956 when he was
[1:30:22] a prophet so if you're cons constantly
[1:30:27] on the up and down remember brother
[1:30:31] you've never correctly ever come to
[1:30:33] Jesus Christ yet if the Bible said love
[1:30:37] not the world neither the things of the
[1:30:39] world and if you love the world the love
[1:30:41] of God is not even in you in your life
[1:30:44] you're only emotionally mentally worked
[1:30:47] up with some kind of church entity or
[1:30:50] some kind of a theology that's been
[1:30:52] taught you and never in your life have
[1:30:55] you ever come face-to-face and met Jesus
[1:30:58] Christ you know this is a question that
[1:31:00] we need to really ask ourselves if we
[1:31:03] ever come face-to-face and met Jesus
[1:31:05] Christ and been born again for when you
[1:31:08] once fall in love with Christ the world
[1:31:11] dies right then for eternity
[1:31:18] hallelujah
[1:31:19] and he says here in 1955 and Abraham he
[1:31:23] says listen first you've got to be born
[1:31:27] again of the Spirit of God if you're not
[1:31:30] you'll never understand the Word of God
[1:31:33] God has said so God said I've had this
[1:31:36] Bible from the wise and prudent and will
[1:31:38] reveal it to babes such as will believe
[1:31:41] if you want to get anything from God
[1:31:44] just be a baby and open up the Bible
[1:31:49] fall in love with Jesus just fall in
[1:31:52] love with Jesus fall in love with him
[1:31:54] now this sounds real simple and you know
[1:31:57] we get a lot of the times and Ben's been
[1:31:59] heading on it a lot lately as you know
[1:32:01] we're try and it's like a rewards system
[1:32:03] type of thing and we if we do all of us
[1:32:04] and we and we achieve all these things
[1:32:06] and we become all us and you know and
[1:32:08] we're going to get something but it's
[1:32:10] actually we've already got it but now
[1:32:12] it's being able to
[1:32:14] Sisson you know you've got an arcade and
[1:32:16] you want to discover and you can
[1:32:18] discover people how do you really
[1:32:20] experience it where does it really
[1:32:22] become a reality to you if you love me
[1:32:27] you'll keep my Commandments divine love
[1:32:31] perfect love in your life that goes
[1:32:34] beyond the seed it's got a that's
[1:32:36] got to grow into something it's got to
[1:32:38] be it's got to be true it's got to come
[1:32:40] out it's got to grow into a fruitful
[1:32:42] tree because he says I'm the vine and
[1:32:44] the other branches and if you abide in
[1:32:46] me then you sure you will be pruned and
[1:32:49] then you'll be a much fruit amen
[1:32:51] and so there's this connection point
[1:32:53] when you come onto the vine and in the
[1:32:56] vine is the supernatural expression of
[1:32:59] God and let me tell you every person in
[1:33:02] the church is subject to all operations
[1:33:05] of the Holy Ghost not just a couple few
[1:33:09] people right
[1:33:11] every person amen who's born of the
[1:33:15] Spirit of God and even if you're not
[1:33:16] born of the Spirit of God he can still
[1:33:18] use you right but but you we should
[1:33:21] never rule ourself out from a
[1:33:23] supernatural experience with the Lord or
[1:33:25] to be used supernaturally but I believe
[1:33:31] that our motive I'm gonna walk around
[1:33:35] this pulpit untie our motive needs to be
[1:33:41] divine love through and through get down
[1:33:45] to the basics you know maybe you've
[1:33:47] never asked the Lord to really help you
[1:33:51] to love him and now this may come as a
[1:33:54] little shock but I believe this is a
[1:33:55] real this is true you know God has given
[1:33:59] us the ability to love on many levels
[1:34:01] right and even down down you know the
[1:34:04] devil will take and pervert that love
[1:34:06] and bring it into lust and bring it into
[1:34:08] all those perverted but if we just keep
[1:34:11] it from that threshold of of God's true
[1:34:14] godly levels of love from human love
[1:34:18] right up to agar P and and like so from
[1:34:21] friendship to you know husband and wife
[1:34:23] and you know I believe and I believe
[1:34:25] this is going to be something for our
[1:34:27] is that we can love him on all those
[1:34:30] levels because if we just love him on a
[1:34:33] divine levels too high level for us we
[1:34:35] can't even feel that properly because we
[1:34:37] we wouldn't to be destroyed we would
[1:34:39] disintegrate if that perfect love just
[1:34:41] was right like all over us right now
[1:34:44] your body could not fish just couldn't I
[1:34:46] have no brother but school was lost
[1:34:48] brother branham in a car and that was
[1:34:49] just another earnest he said he thought
[1:34:52] he could almost die because he said it
[1:34:55] one breast would take me into another
[1:34:56] dimension now I don't believe that was
[1:34:58] what it was
[1:34:59] fullness that was just more than maybe
[1:35:01] what we used to write and he said but
[1:35:04] their presence we're not made and so if
[1:35:07] that's all that we've got for the Lord
[1:35:10] and that's all that we're feeling in our
[1:35:12] experience then I believe we can ask the
[1:35:14] Lord Lord I want to love you with all
[1:35:16] the loves that I got I don't just want
[1:35:18] to love you and divine that because
[1:35:20] that's default that's in the predestined
[1:35:23] seed in your life it's already there and
[1:35:26] when it gets quickened it just gets more
[1:35:27] and more right it's like a love that
[1:35:29] just comes forth and you can't keep it's
[1:35:31] just like the alabaster box gets broken
[1:35:33] right and it pours out and you can't
[1:35:35] stop it till it's all empty all over his
[1:35:37] feet amen I break alabaster at your feet
[1:35:40] Lord amen
[1:35:41] but see now what how much can we love
[1:35:45] them if we love them with our friendship
[1:35:47] love and we love them with our philia
[1:35:49] love and we love them with our garper
[1:35:50] love so that all the love that's in us
[1:35:53] can be smitten can be consumed by him I
[1:35:57] believe it will take on a new your life
[1:35:59] will take on a different note a
[1:36:02] different song because you see we have a
[1:36:06] more ready access to feel your love
[1:36:08] we feel it more that love that you get
[1:36:11] smitten by when you first meet your
[1:36:12] spouse or you know that's a figlio love
[1:36:16] and and and you know there there there
[1:36:18] comes the time where that agape love
[1:36:20] starts to really it doesn't it doesn't
[1:36:23] it's always there right so it's there
[1:36:26] but you see this feeling of love as a
[1:36:28] vibration that we can really we can feel
[1:36:31] and we want to feel our religion and we
[1:36:34] want a heartfelt religion we don't just
[1:36:36] want some you know pie in the sky
[1:36:40] we want it to be heartfelt we want it to
[1:36:43] have a fruit and you know in it when
[1:36:46] it's really down deep inside you and
[1:36:48] it's flowing through you and it's all
[1:36:49] around you oh my your life will take on
[1:36:52] a different mount and you'll have more
[1:36:55] patience for people
[1:36:56] amen those grudges will just disappear
[1:36:58] that have been held against people
[1:37:00] because of some sort of thing that
[1:37:02] happened they just fade away it just
[1:37:04] fades off amen
[1:37:07] it fades away I can't so that's the
[1:37:08] water that's the oil they meant you know
[1:37:10] the oil is what causes the water to fall
[1:37:12] off the duck's back it's the oil it's
[1:37:15] the oil that cleans the Dove
[1:37:17] self-cleansing amen hallelujah that's
[1:37:20] what we need a bit of self cleansing
[1:37:21] amen it's the oil hallelujah
[1:37:24] and so you see you now you know if
[1:37:27] you've got a water the horse that takes
[1:37:29] you back to Isaac right the camel the
[1:37:33] camel train so you really need to start
[1:37:35] giving God some praise hello yeah you on
[1:37:38] the camera give God praise amen I can
[1:37:42] hear you by the way let's brother ninnie
[1:37:44] I know it you know because the Spirit of
[1:37:53] God is in you but he loves praise he
[1:37:55] loves to be worshipped
[1:37:56] he loves it when you remind him of us
[1:37:58] how good is a man when you sing with
[1:38:02] passion hallelujah amen ask the Lord
[1:38:05] Lord restore passion in my life for you
[1:38:09] amen we read about the Passion of Christ
[1:38:12] what it caused him to do and the love
[1:38:15] that was set before him he endured the
[1:38:16] shame took the cross because of you
[1:38:20] Amen hallelujah what drove him divine
[1:38:25] love what connects you to the
[1:38:27] supernatural divine love amen
[1:38:30] what would motivate you to keep his
[1:38:32] Commandments and and it would actually
[1:38:34] cause him to love you and really make
[1:38:36] his abode with you and you would see it
[1:38:39] in your life and there would be a
[1:38:41] manifestation of Jesus of the Father and
[1:38:46] your life is love
[1:38:50] perfect laughs and this is our
[1:38:53] inheritance and this is something as a
[1:38:54] child of God as the bride of Jesus
[1:38:57] Christ you can say like kayln give me my
[1:39:00] Mountain hallelujah amen because that
[1:39:03] stone now here it is here it is this
[1:39:06] just this just say it right now that
[1:39:09] stone comes into your heart but what did
[1:39:11] it what was the next part of the story
[1:39:15] it grew got watered by praise got
[1:39:19] watered by being reminded of what he's
[1:39:22] done for you how that Babylonian
[1:39:24] nature's not ruling over you anymore
[1:39:25] you've got freedom you got Liberty you
[1:39:28] can walk and freedom hallelujah and when
[1:39:31] you start to praise him based on these
[1:39:33] things and then that mountain starts to
[1:39:35] grow amen
[1:39:37] let that stone the builders rejected
[1:39:39] Amen didn't get rejected by you because
[1:39:42] you're praising him and he's growing and
[1:39:44] he's growing and he's becoming greater
[1:39:46] in your life what is becoming greater
[1:39:49] divine laughs that's divine love you
[1:39:53] know we pray and we ask the Lord for
[1:39:55] things I don't know what percentage we
[1:39:59] ask right but you know we ask for the
[1:40:01] Lord's for lots of things and I think
[1:40:02] there's a good thing it's a very good
[1:40:04] thing we don't always get it right but
[1:40:06] you know when you strike a chord with
[1:40:08] him and you know I've just asked the
[1:40:10] right thing and he comes down and he
[1:40:12] says yes and that's why I'd be waiting
[1:40:14] for you to us they don't know how long
[1:40:17] he's been waiting but he's been waiting
[1:40:19] for you to ask that I believe when you
[1:40:21] can ask the Lord out of a sincere heart
[1:40:23] and you prepare yourself and he's there
[1:40:25] and he's you know he's come there and
[1:40:27] used to say you know you know when
[1:40:29] you've got an audience right and you
[1:40:31] just know the Lord is there and you're
[1:40:32] having a fellowship and it's like you
[1:40:34] know when you ask that you've just you
[1:40:36] just believe you know it's just the
[1:40:39] atmosphere and you just say Lord you
[1:40:41] know I really I want all the loves of me
[1:40:44] to love you I want to love you Lord
[1:40:47] so that Lord it doesn't just remain
[1:40:49] inside but that mountain would just Lord
[1:40:52] fill my whole earth I want my whole
[1:40:55] earth to be filled I want all that
[1:40:58] Kings to be smitten hallelujah but if I
[1:41:01] love a man I want all the ten Kings to
[1:41:05] be under a cloud nine experience a man
[1:41:07] who knows what cloud nine knows amen
[1:41:09] well why don't you just put those ten
[1:41:12] Kings under cloud nine right now that's
[1:41:14] my kind of administration amen amen
[1:41:16] that's it against a good administration
[1:41:19] amen you know when a church gets under
[1:41:21] that administration there's nothing
[1:41:23] that's impossible right now you know
[1:41:25] that because there is a love the Spirit
[1:41:28] of God is happy because he is that love
[1:41:30] and he's being magnified hallelujah amen
[1:41:35] well I think we've gone over time so I'm
[1:41:38] gonna leave it there hallelujah but I
[1:41:43] must say that is a differently to be
[1:41:45] continued we will continue on that one
[1:41:48] day because man honestly well being or
[1:41:53] no it's never-ending a man amen
[1:42:02] can we have the musicians please I just
[1:42:05] want to you know why we're in this
[1:42:07] atmosphere you know maybe there's
[1:42:10] somebody here or on the tape or even if
[1:42:14] you're listening later on and and maybe
[1:42:19] the love you you know that you could
[1:42:22] love God more and maybe you've let other
[1:42:25] things into your life then as comforting
[1:42:29] you or giving you peace that the world
[1:42:32] can give but not but you see Jesus says
[1:42:34] I give you peace that the world cannot
[1:42:36] give and and you know if you want to
[1:42:40] access to that piece and you want access
[1:42:41] to faith remember there's the scripture
[1:42:44] in Galatians 5 it says that that that
[1:42:47] love works faith amen and so you see
[1:42:52] when this love becomes so preeminent in
[1:42:56] your life and that mountain that smitten
[1:42:58] all of those kings and you're coming
[1:43:01] under that influence and it's really
[1:43:02] affecting you you know this is going to
[1:43:06] make a real change and and that love
[1:43:09] because you see we all
[1:43:11] long to see the supernatural we all
[1:43:14] longed to be freed from the desire to
[1:43:17] watch YouTube or watch movies or or do
[1:43:20] whatever it is that the devil has given
[1:43:22] us or some you know out-of-balance thing
[1:43:26] right we want to be free from that but
[1:43:30] you see and we want but we need to be
[1:43:32] connected to the supernatural we need to
[1:43:35] be connected to the one that would say I
[1:43:38] manifest myself I mean if you love me he
[1:43:43] that loveth me keepeth my Commandments
[1:43:45] John 14 read it later he said I've got
[1:43:48] it right in front of me why don't just
[1:43:49] say it so this is here he that he that
[1:43:53] hath my Commandments and keepeth them he
[1:43:55] it is that loveth me and he that loveth
[1:43:59] me shall be loved of my father and I
[1:44:03] will love him and will manifest myself
[1:44:06] to him so you see now here is somebody
[1:44:11] who's got the the stone inside him and
[1:44:15] they love him and they realize oh I've
[1:44:18] got all these things that's happened and
[1:44:19] there's a war going on but here is
[1:44:21] divine love and now it's time for divine
[1:44:25] love to be and I want I just want to I
[1:44:28] want to feel this love I want more than
[1:44:31] just a teaching of it I just I don't
[1:44:33] want to just see it in other people but
[1:44:35] I want it in my life then tonight you
[1:44:38] can make that happen
[1:44:39] by surrendering more amen you know the
[1:44:43] Lord he rebuked the Ephesians Church H
[1:44:46] because they left their first love that
[1:44:49] church that church age began when they
[1:44:53] left their first love did you know that
[1:44:56] that's where the church age began
[1:44:58] because before that they were in eternal
[1:45:00] realms they were led by the spirit they
[1:45:03] were up in perfect love but then they
[1:45:05] left it and the Ephesians church age
[1:45:08] began
[1:45:09] but he said you know to come back and do
[1:45:13] the first works he said but it takes the
[1:45:16] humility it takes a heartfelt repentance
[1:45:19] and and really ask the Lord tonight
[1:45:24] Lord let's let's just pray before we
[1:45:28] hand the service over to brother Edie
[1:45:30] and if you want to be remembered in
[1:45:33] prayer you do so by just acknowledging
[1:45:37] the Lord just put your hand up to him
[1:45:39] and and just pray with us Lord Jesus
[1:45:43] father Lord we don't want to serve these
[1:45:46] 10 kings but father you've given us Lord
[1:45:49] a smiting stone in our life you sent the
[1:45:52] son of man you seen Elijah Lord you said
[1:45:56] there
[1:45:56] you came of clouds Lord Lord you sent a
[1:46:00] mighty message in this day to declare
[1:46:02] Lord the revelation of the Son of man
[1:46:04] that smiting stone that would come into
[1:46:07] our life and it would take over and you
[1:46:09] would grow and you would grow and Lord
[1:46:12] you would take over Lord so that our
[1:46:14] faith could rise because your love would
[1:46:16] bring it up Lord
[1:46:17] you would give us rapture and condition
[1:46:19] Lord you would bring us out you would
[1:46:22] deliver us from our enemies and Lord we
[1:46:24] just want to remind you of how good you
[1:46:26] are and how faithful you've been and
[1:46:29] Lord Jesus I just asked you now father
[1:46:32] and the name of Jesus Christ that you
[1:46:34] would renew that perfect love and me
[1:46:36] that Lord you would Lord let me love you
[1:46:38] with all the love that's in me Lord
[1:46:41] not just far the Lord that divine love
[1:46:43] which is needed and which is perfect
[1:46:46] Lord but Lord that I could really
[1:46:48] contact that love and I could really
[1:46:50] love love you with all of those that's
[1:46:52] within me Lord then it wouldn't just be
[1:46:55] Lord high-leveled father it wouldn't
[1:46:57] just be a theological reason it wouldn't
[1:46:59] just be not a positional little thing
[1:47:02] but Lord I would experience the love
[1:47:04] Lord we want to experience your love
[1:47:07] Lord for we know Lord Jesus that Lord
[1:47:10] that would motivate us Lord that would
[1:47:13] bring some German that would bring
[1:47:15] father and Mileva benevolent leader
[1:47:17] that we would be able laughs I love to
[1:47:20] lead Lord in our life phone that we
[1:47:23] would be able to take control of our
[1:47:25] spirit Lord not because we have too long
[1:47:27] not under some legalistic regime Lord
[1:47:30] but under divine love Lord that's what
[1:47:33] makes the change this is what makes the
[1:47:35] difference Lord and we want access to
[1:47:37] their tonight father that that smiting
[1:47:39] stole Lord would just grow I ask Lord
[1:47:42] that you would increase I pray Lord that
[1:47:45] law that government in our life
[1:47:47] others increase shall there be no end
[1:47:49] that government that one that wonderful
[1:47:52] counsellor that's the one that can
[1:47:54] subdue our spirit with divine love
[1:47:56] that's the one that can come into the
[1:47:58] outer courts of our life and out into
[1:48:00] our flesh and Lord it can just bring
[1:48:02] peace but not the world can give law but
[1:48:05] what you can give and we need that
[1:48:07] tonight Lord and father there's somebody
[1:48:10] that's out there or in here Lord Jesus
[1:48:13] that needs to be Lord of revival that
[1:48:16] needs a love tonight I pray you would
[1:48:19] give it Lord wherever they're at Lord I
[1:48:21] can't see the Lord but you can you know
[1:48:24] what's going on in every life you know
[1:48:26] this desires lot of your children's
[1:48:28] hearts Lord I pray father that they
[1:48:30] would come a supernatural or God and
[1:48:33] that we would see fruit tonight Lord
[1:48:35] Jesus that we would see Lord a lasting
[1:48:39] consistent change and the people Lord or
[1:48:42] the fussing would leave all the grudge's
[1:48:44] would go unforgiveness would be broken
