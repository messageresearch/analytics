[37:52] bless your word this evening thank you
[37:53] for lord and we just come at the service
[37:55] here in Jesus name Amen
[37:56] praise Lord God bless you you can take
[37:58] your seats this evening now girls
[38:01] brother Isaac has got to give you a kind
[38:06] of like a little apology I don't have
[38:09] slides tonight I know when I was a
[38:13] little guy I so loved slights because
[38:15] when I couldn't understand what was
[38:16] being said I could look at the pictures
[38:18] yeah and that's why that's why I do them
[38:21] for it like young little guys and girls
[38:24] so they can look at the pictures we need
[38:25] that know what I'm talking about
[38:26] but tonight there's no pictures but
[38:29] we'll try and paint a picture okay I
[38:31] know I owe you though okay I know that's
[38:35] why they were sitting up the front you
[38:36] must imagine how bad I feel right now
[38:39] I owe you girls I'll give you some
[38:43] lollies - okay yeah yeah I do enjoy
[38:51] doing slides because I can kind of
[38:53] present the idea and in a an
[38:58] understandable fashion and it helps me
[38:59] to present the idea but this one is not
[39:02] quite like that that I'm going to do
[39:04] this evening it's going to be slightly
[39:06] different cuz I don't have any slides
[39:07] and I can't really note up this sermon
[39:11] if I follow my notes I'll go off track
[39:13] right so I don't really want to use too
[39:15] many notes because I I think the Lord's
[39:17] given it to me enough that I don't need
[39:18] to go and go to my notes because that's
[39:22] a it's a thought that has spoken to my
[39:24] heart and I trust it a bit would be a
[39:27] blessing to you and incidentally enough
[39:29] I think this may be the first or the
[39:31] second sermon that brother ben has been
[39:33] in that I've preached it is that right
[39:35] and five or six years second one praise
[39:42] the Lord now the thought that I've got
[39:44] to speak on this evening is a very
[39:48] powerful thought that will change your
[39:52] life who wants their life changed okay
[39:56] the thought this evening is ye are gods
[39:59] and some near it said I have said Ye are
[40:06] gods ye are gods now a lot of the times
[40:12] I speak about the Lord and what he's
[40:15] done for us and who he is but tonight's
[40:17] going to be slightly different because
[40:18] I'm just going to talk about who we are
[40:19] for a night if I can all right
[40:23] that doesn't take away from who the Lord
[40:25] is but you know we have quite a big role
[40:32] to play in humanity as well and this
[40:34] whole operation man has a very very
[40:39] powerful part that they play and punch
[40:43] yourself you're a god
[40:47] see it's quite a powerful statement to
[40:50] make and yet that's there's so much
[40:51] truth to it there's no other creature
[40:55] like man what other creature on this
[40:58] earth that God gives Dominion say you
[41:01] have dominion over everything he doesn't
[41:03] say to the animals when he made the
[41:05] finest animal he could like a lion
[41:06] you'll have Dominion you'll rule your
[41:08] reign but he said to man you'll have
[41:12] dominion how many times you walk up to a
[41:15] wild animal and it runs away this kid of
[41:18] us God we are actually gods we are very
[41:23] very powerful creatures never under miss
[41:27] underestimate who you are Satan knows
[41:30] exactly who we are he knows who we are
[41:34] and it says job to try and make us not
[41:37] realize who we are because we are gods
[41:42] right that's a powerful statement to
[41:44] make I know but that's the truth of it
[41:48] now I'm just going to start speaking
[41:52] about this idea for a minute and being
[41:54] with me we have so much power within us
[41:58] to create whatever we want jesus said if
[42:02] you say to this mountain be thou removed
[42:06] and be cast into the sea and don't doubt
[42:09] whatever you say will happen the
[42:11] mountain will move and be cast into the
[42:13] sea that's a lot of power that's a lot
[42:19] of authority given to a human being
[42:21] he didn't say a few if you believe that
[42:23] I am Christ you'll do that and I know he
[42:25] said a few and that's anybody on this
[42:28] whole entire world if you believe and if
[42:31] you say that this mountain be moved
[42:34] there were no conditions placed on that
[42:37] anybody whether they believe the Lord is
[42:40] God Almighty or not has that power to do
[42:42] that anybody it's not restricted to a
[42:44] Christian let's keep this all in
[42:47] perspective here he didn't put he didn't
[42:49] put a limitation on who had the ability
[42:51] to do that
[42:54] God's made us very very powerful
[42:56] creatures very powerful so powerful the
[43:00] Satan
[43:00] wants to use us you know the thing about
[43:03] it is Satan doesn't have as much power
[43:05] as what we have that's why he hates us
[43:07] so much and that's why he actually has
[43:09] to use means creative power to do things
[43:11] she can't do it himself now this concept
[43:17] of faith right faith faith can be head
[43:21] outside of Christianity right faith the
[43:26] faith it's not as not a Christian thing
[43:28] as such it's a that's a human it's
[43:32] something that's been given to the human
[43:33] being to create the sort of world you
[43:35] want to live in right you say well
[43:38] that's quite that's quite big faith
[43:42] without works is dead you know their
[43:44] statement right faithful that works is
[43:45] dead if you want to achieve something
[43:49] great in this world if you want your on
[43:52] a player you're a soccer player you want
[43:54] to get to the heights of stardom and the
[43:57] soccer world and get paid millions of
[43:59] dollars do you know what you really need
[44:02] to get there the first thing you need
[44:03] faith you need to see what you want in
[44:07] front of you and then you need to
[44:09] believe that no you don't not
[44:13] Christianity this is just how it works
[44:16] you never met someone that got to the
[44:18] top the thought I didn't think I could
[44:19] do it and I never tried to do it they
[44:22] believe it they see this up there and
[44:25] they say that's what I want to be they
[44:28] believe it right they believe and then
[44:32] what do they now do they act on their
[44:34] faith they said acting faithful that
[44:36] works is dead they act on it they start
[44:39] training and they heap this vision in
[44:43] front of them that's what I want to be
[44:44] yeah and if they believe it enough you
[44:47] might think this is strange but it's not
[44:48] this is not strange if they believe it
[44:51] enough they will create that world in
[44:53] front of them they're created in front
[44:57] of them but they will make that happen
[45:00] that the order of the world will come
[45:02] under subjection to the God
[45:05] but they're of God it'll come under
[45:06] subjection to that and it will start to
[45:08] happen as they believe it if they
[45:11] believe it enough place the plan
[45:13] abandoned one of the guys we were not
[45:15] Christian and one of the guys said to me
[45:16] if you want to get anywhere another
[45:18] singer in a band he said what I was told
[45:20] by another singer that was a famous New
[45:23] Zealand singer he said the first thing
[45:25] you've got to do is believe in yourself
[45:27] you must believe in yourself believe in
[45:30] yourself and it will happen
[45:32] he couldn't stress it to me enough
[45:34] believe in yourself because why we are
[45:38] gods we have this creative power within
[45:41] us to achieve anything we want to
[45:42] achieve anything in anything at all
[45:45] you're doing it he wants to do something
[45:48] you have the ability and you to create
[45:51] whatever you want
[45:51] you have the ability within you to
[45:54] create whatever sort of a world you want
[45:55] in front of you anything at all you have
[45:59] the ability to do that never limit who
[46:02] you are right never now people get know
[46:07] people do not get anywhere except they
[46:09] have faith we know some builders brother
[46:12] Andean ideas one guy called Mike Friday
[46:14] right and there's another guy called
[46:17] I've forgotten his name because he's
[46:18] kind of a nobody but they were both at
[46:21] the same place at one point in time but
[46:24] Mike Friday thought you know what I can
[46:27] do better than this I believe I can do
[46:29] this
[46:30] the other guy said hmm I don't think I
[46:34] can do that so they parted ways Brent
[46:38] what's his name you know who knows him
[46:41] nobody because he didn't believe he
[46:44] didn't have a vision in front of him to
[46:45] believe anything he's now a nobody but
[46:48] who's heard of Mike Friday you seen a
[46:50] Friday home sign around somewhere that's
[46:53] Mike Friday about my age friend of ours
[46:55] he believed and he started acting on it
[46:58] and I'll tell you something that
[47:00] happened the world started conforming to
[47:01] what he wanted because he is a God he's
[47:04] a God we're all God's we have this
[47:07] creative power within us to do anything
[47:10] Satan knows that - he knows it he knows
[47:14] that we have this creative power and he
[47:16] wants access to it I wanna tell you a
[47:18] little
[47:19] he doesn't have it think about it he
[47:24] doesn't have it
[47:24] he doesn't have creative power he can't
[47:29] create anything he's upset he can't
[47:32] create he needs man to create with the
[47:35] godlike powers to achieve his purpose
[47:38] that's what he needs
[47:40] that's all he doesn't have access to
[47:43] this status that we have now you know
[47:48] what he tells his people right if you
[47:50] understood from you know what he tells
[47:51] you you don't know what it tells you you
[47:55] can believe in yourself you can if
[47:58] you're gonna do what he says he'll tell
[48:01] you believe in yourself you can why
[48:06] because you're doing what he wants you
[48:08] to do he's not going to discourage you
[48:10] is he not going to discourage you
[48:13] because he wants you to do what he wants
[48:15] what he wants you to do so he's got to
[48:17] encourage you you can do this you can't
[48:19] be the best soccer player the river us
[48:22] are you gonna stop believing it because
[48:24] he wants you to become an idol that
[48:27] other people will follow you and go down
[48:28] that road he's looking for people with
[48:30] faith Satan's looking for people with
[48:33] faith when he sees someone with faith he
[48:35] wants access to that faith to achieve
[48:38] his purpose because he can't do it
[48:40] himself think about it that's what he
[48:42] wants to do that's what he wants to do
[48:48] that's true right okay you said of
[48:53] Eminem the reps there what's the song he
[48:56] sings about you only get one shot to do
[48:58] this just do it you've got a make or
[49:00] break do it now it's encouraging saying
[49:03] you can do this you guys can be like me
[49:05] believe it you'll be like me see Satan
[49:09] encourages people he uses their faith
[49:12] because he knows we can if we so desire
[49:14] something we as gods can create it in
[49:18] front of us we can create any world we
[49:20] want to we control life this world order
[49:25] that you look at you know how you look
[49:26] forward at life and you look out at it
[49:28] who controls there we do
[49:32] we control it the person with the most
[49:34] faith to believe controls the world they
[49:37] control it we control it all
[49:40] Satan just uses man to control it he
[49:44] just gets them believing something and
[49:46] acting on it who said of Russell Crowe
[49:48] the actor I think huge might even be
[49:51] from here is he from Wellington I think
[49:53] he is right do you know when he was 12
[49:55] 13 14 15 years old you know what he said
[49:57] one day I'm gonna win an Academy Award
[50:02] I'm gonna win an Academy Award do you
[50:05] know what he did when he got older yeah
[50:07] what what did he win again an Academy
[50:11] Award roles would have been created in
[50:16] front of him to achieve it wasn't chance
[50:19] it wasn't luck good movies were created
[50:23] and that gravitated towards him because
[50:26] he believed it because hit what because
[50:30] what is he he's a god yeah God's like
[50:34] this that's who the human being is we're
[50:37] a God Satan use that faith he had to to
[50:41] achieve his purpose and him right this
[50:46] is how this thing works this is how this
[50:48] whole thing works now their least it's
[50:54] least kind of bring it around into some
[50:57] a different type of perspective now
[51:09] I'm going to talk about this for a while
[51:14] so I can stand my thought right what I
[51:17] want to talk about Satan does not he
[51:25] does not have the ability to advance
[51:28] past you and I right explain what I mean
[51:38] by that right because I want to
[51:40] now this thought down then I want to
[51:41] show you I want to show you he's
[51:43] actually a bluff when you understand
[51:45] this he's a complete bluff right right
[51:48] let's go on a different seaquarius talk
[51:50] about light right light light you even
[51:55] know what light is right and darkness
[51:58] you know dark misses right darkness and
[52:04] a scientific term doesn't actually exist
[52:07] it only exists in the absence of light
[52:09] right hold that thought I want to go
[52:14] back to something else because I want to
[52:15] I've got to nail this I want to get this
[52:18] thought out so you understand it because
[52:19] if we understand who we are we're gonna
[52:25] change the world we're going to change
[52:27] the world we got to make the broad
[52:30] anything we want it to be there's a
[52:32] catch to it right because we're sons and
[52:34] daughters of God so we want to find that
[52:35] well right right don't worry I'm getting
[52:38] I'm gonna get to that we're not just
[52:39] going to do anything we want I wanna get
[52:42] to that right Satan's main objective now
[52:48] he encourages his people do you know
[52:50] what his main objective that he does to
[52:52] you he tells you you can't he knows you
[53:00] can he knows you can you know what he
[53:03] tells the believer now we talk about
[53:04] believers now do you know what he tells
[53:06] you what does he tell you impo you can't
[53:10] you can't you can't that's what he tells
[53:15] you if you wanna go and do anything for
[53:17] the Lord move on him in any way he's
[53:19] gonna tell you you can't if you're a
[53:21] non-believer
[53:23] doing this well he'll tell you you can
[53:25] but if you're a believer a Christian he
[53:29] knows you can he knows it but he's going
[53:33] to tell you that you can't that's
[53:35] because he knows the only way he can
[53:37] stop you from doing something is by
[53:39] making you think you can't be honest
[53:42] that he knows you can he knows you can
[53:44] do anything you want to do but he's got
[53:47] to try and trick you to thinking that
[53:48] you can't one of the ways he does
[53:50] debtor's with fear
[53:51] think about this fear fear fear of doing
[53:54] something fear of stepping out why
[53:55] because this may happen never ever never
[53:57] happen
[53:57] who puts those there you're a god you
[54:00] can create anything you want that won't
[54:01] happen because I think that's what
[54:02] happened
[54:03] that won't happen but Satan will tell
[54:05] you know it will happen that way why
[54:08] because he knows if you if you actually
[54:10] step forward and believe that it will
[54:12] happen that way that you want it to
[54:13] happen and he knows he cannot stop you
[54:15] at all from doing it no no way at all
[54:17] absolutely no way at all he doesn't have
[54:20] the ability because this go back to
[54:22] light and darkness darkness doesn't have
[54:24] the ability to push forward
[54:26] think about it and that's not ability to
[54:29] push forward nothing
[54:32] darkness is only where light is where
[54:35] there's light is gone then darkness
[54:37] can't persist the ground that light head
[54:39] but it doesn't have the ability to push
[54:41] on to the ground that light possesses
[54:43] whatsoever you understand and he knows
[54:46] it he knows it he knows he doesn't have
[54:49] the ability to overtake the believer on
[54:52] any front whatsoever he knows it what he
[54:56] gets has to get you and I to do is to
[54:58] pull back by fear because he knows when
[55:02] you pull back he possesses it that's the
[55:05] only ability he has to find us is to
[55:08] make you pull back and anything at all
[55:11] any promise that's the only way that he
[55:13] can actually then he can one is by you
[55:17] pulling back because that's darkness
[55:20] that's why this church is successful
[55:23] because love and light are similar
[55:25] hate is just the absence of love but I
[55:28] cannot possess it cannot move forward
[55:32] you cannot that's my fellowship when
[55:34] it's love it cannot be overtaken can't
[55:38] there's no there's no ability hate
[55:43] cannot possess hate does not have the
[55:45] ability to put forward he has to get you
[55:47] to hate yes get you critical because
[55:50] when you get like that you don't love
[55:51] and you pull back when you pull back he
[55:53] possesses it but he knows he cannot beat
[55:56] you on a head-on fight he's a liability
[55:59] not no ability he's got it he has to
[56:03] trick you to thinking you have to pull
[56:06] back in terms of love he's gonna try and
[56:11] get you thinking critical in it cuz he
[56:13] knows when I get like that you'll pull
[56:14] back then I'll possess it but if you
[56:17] don't think like that yeah you can stand
[56:19] there all day long and he can't do
[56:20] nothing nothing nothing that's why this
[56:28] is why he's a but if you're a program
[56:31] prank this is not just uh let's be good
[56:33] we're to use he's bluffing he knows it
[56:37] he knows he's bluffing but a big dick
[56:42] you to believe it
[56:43] thinking scared thinking you're pulling
[56:46] back he once but he knows all of us all
[56:48] of us perhaps all of us like Goliath he
[56:52] was bluffing any one of those children
[56:56] versa I could have overtaking life
[56:58] anyone if they believed it they didn't
[57:02] Goliath and they're the ability to push
[57:04] forward they here he was no way their
[57:05] army was gonna win no way but the men
[57:09] believed he would yeah so they all stood
[57:11] there because they believed they
[57:13] couldn't do it yeah that's the only
[57:15] thing to stop them what was the
[57:17] difference with David what was the
[57:19] difference he believed so hang on hang
[57:23] on hang on who's this
[57:26] who is this he believed us he believed
[57:31] it and what he believed was created in
[57:34] front of him because light possesses
[57:37] darkness doesn't possess and only
[57:39] inhibits placement there's no light
[57:41] tough light choosers think about this if
[57:44] you chose if you choose to move forward
[57:49] at all you'll possess anything you want
[57:53] any promises but if you choose it let me
[57:57] choose it if you're a son of God and you
[58:00] choose it footsteps are positioned so
[58:02] you take one step forward where's the
[58:05] darkness gonna go it's gotta flee flee
[58:10] it cannot stay on the ground that light
[58:14] comes on that's the way this whole thing
[58:18] works
[58:19] Satan is a complete and utter Bluff
[58:23] complete Bluff he wants to try and trick
[58:28] us to thinking we can't do it yeah we
[58:32] can't move forward we can't possess
[58:35] promises he uses fear when you think
[58:38] about your future you know I get fearful
[58:41] put that there please telling you to be
[58:44] fearful if you want to make some sort of
[58:46] change you feel to make a change if you
[58:50] wants to make a change but they get
[58:51] scared what will that be a do it's not
[58:56] you yeah hang on you're a god you can
[59:02] have anything you want if you feel to go
[59:04] out a certain way you can have anything
[59:06] you want anything you want I got to a
[59:11] point once we I guess I can say when I
[59:14] used to get these fearful thoughts about
[59:16] my future I used to think hang on what's
[59:17] the worst that could happen to be when I
[59:19] boil it all down I could die that's not
[59:25] so bad after all
[59:27] the worst officers not their bad then
[59:29] why fear why fear what I'm bracelet run
[59:34] up bring it on bring it on it'll be
[59:37] whatever I create what do I have to fear
[59:41] fear cripples faith Satan knows if you
[59:45] have faith and walk forward you'll beat
[59:49] him on every front and he knows it he
[59:52] knows it now now as a Christian as a
[59:57] human we've got this power within us
[59:59] godlike powers right we're creative
[1:00:02] beings we create things right
[1:00:04] Satan's Satan loves to get his hands on
[1:00:06] the human and have them create his
[1:00:08] purpose but now the believer when the
[1:00:12] Lord gets hold of us we still have a
[1:00:16] role to play in achieving his purpose
[1:00:20] what Caleb he had a role to play which
[1:00:25] was believe it nekton it that was the
[1:00:29] will of God was that they put that the
[1:00:30] children of Israel possessed the
[1:00:31] promised land
[1:00:32] Caleb the children of Israel his job was
[1:00:35] just to believe it and walk forward and
[1:00:37] every enemy that came before them had to
[1:00:40] go what a team stop because there's they
[1:00:44] were there they started seeing all these
[1:00:45] things all the Giants and they and the
[1:00:48] devil started speaking in him you can't
[1:00:49] take these guys you can't take it you
[1:00:51] can't take it he knew they could he knew
[1:00:53] they could wipe the whole place out in a
[1:00:54] week he knew it but he had to Bluff he
[1:01:00] had to Bluff Satan's got no power he
[1:01:03] doesn't we're not when I understood the
[1:01:06] story I realized he's got no power he's
[1:01:09] got no power he's so disappointed he's
[1:01:12] got no power
[1:01:13] he's a bluff I thought to myself you
[1:01:17] know what would I ever be scared
[1:01:19] he's a bluff now when a son of God then
[1:01:24] you start walking in the will of God
[1:01:31] anything you want anything the Lord lays
[1:01:33] on your heart yeah you you can do you
[1:01:39] can have any promise you can have
[1:01:41] anything anything at all Jesus when He
[1:01:46] healed the the man that was second he
[1:01:48] said your sins be forgiven you basically
[1:01:50] to the Pharisees see to him who do you
[1:01:52] think you are saying his sins are
[1:01:53] forgiven he said what's easier to say
[1:01:56] your sins were forgiven all stand up and
[1:01:58] walk here just stand up he was a Creator
[1:02:04] God you want to limit you we have this
[1:02:09] creative power within us to create the
[1:02:11] will of God for our lives we have that
[1:02:14] power Satan knows it and he wants to
[1:02:16] blow us out of it but he knows that if
[1:02:22] we believe it and we act on it he's
[1:02:25] going to be defeated at every single
[1:02:26] turn he knows it so when we find the
[1:02:30] will of God when we find a will of God
[1:02:32] for our life have you ever felt to do
[1:02:34] something and then you sort of pull back
[1:02:36] you've done that that thing may have
[1:02:41] been the will of God for you but fear
[1:02:43] made you pull back it may have been the
[1:02:46] will of God for your life but all this
[1:02:50] fear will come to say maybe you can you
[1:02:53] know you know no no you can't do that
[1:02:54] what if it doesn't work what if you this
[1:02:56] happens if you don't get well what if
[1:02:58] that job doesn't work out what if when
[1:02:59] you move this not like what you thought
[1:03:00] it would be all those thoughts that's
[1:03:02] for you and then you can not act on it
[1:03:06] let me taste something I don't think
[1:03:09] like that anymore when you realize he's
[1:03:15] a bluff you go okay well this is now
[1:03:17] changes the game somewhat they changes
[1:03:20] the game if I feel to do anything for
[1:03:23] the Lord or I want any promise it's up
[1:03:27] to me I can just go and walk out and
[1:03:28] take it and if I believe it enough
[1:03:31] I'll have it then I start thinking for
[1:03:36] myself if that's the case right pinch
[1:03:41] yourself again
[1:03:44] you just punched baya t you punched a
[1:03:49] person that has the ability to change
[1:03:51] the world
[1:03:52] you might think that's pretty big well
[1:03:54] no no what's easier to say okay I'm
[1:03:59] gonna create this all that what does it
[1:04:01] matter we can do a lot more things than
[1:04:05] what we think we can do Satan's job is
[1:04:08] to try and Bluff us to thinking we can
[1:04:09] and make us fearful hope you know when
[1:04:14] maybe you might say this right I'm gonna
[1:04:16] say I asked him if I could he said do
[1:04:19] you have to I say yes
[1:04:22] it's not bad right so so we got a
[1:04:25] fellowship here and rather being sister
[1:04:28] Christine you know they've they put
[1:04:30] their heart and soul into that the
[1:04:32] church and they labor and they they you
[1:04:36] know they brother Ben works all day
[1:04:38] sister Christine has to go and do but it
[1:04:40] work to make ends meet and me and they
[1:04:42] have people over during the week and
[1:04:43] they have the services and there's oh
[1:04:45] they get quite stressed right it's quite
[1:04:47] a strenuous physically and mentally and
[1:04:50] spiritually it's quite draining what
[1:04:52] they do right so now what's this new
[1:04:57] concept of hate where actually I've got
[1:04:59] this we've got a power than us right I
[1:05:01] look at the situation I think I don't
[1:05:02] think I really like the situation I
[1:05:05] think hmm I really like this and I think
[1:05:12] you know I would prefer if rather been
[1:05:15] at least sister Christine wouldn't have
[1:05:17] to work and I prefer brother Ben didn't
[1:05:18] have to either right so I think I think
[1:05:22] that's a good idea right now this is
[1:05:29] putting this thing in action era I think
[1:05:30] that's a good idea when you do this once
[1:05:34] we're in here once
[1:05:38] why not get it done you know what why
[1:05:41] just do it half a quarter
[1:05:47] Elijah was sick he was almost going to
[1:05:49] die and I think it was joash wanted
[1:05:53] deliverance from the rest from the
[1:05:54] Syrians and Elijah said pick up your bow
[1:05:59] and arrow and shoot it up and he held
[1:06:00] his hands and he said shoot an arrow out
[1:06:02] the window he shot an arrow out the
[1:06:03] window and then Elijah said Behold the
[1:06:07] area of the deliverance of the Lord and
[1:06:11] Elijah said to the king of Israel strike
[1:06:15] the arrows on the ground and by that
[1:06:17] you'll defeat the armies of the earth of
[1:06:19] the Syrians and he struck the ground
[1:06:21] three times then he stopped and he'll I
[1:06:27] sure was angry with him he said you
[1:06:31] should have smoked the ground six or
[1:06:32] seven times then you would have driven
[1:06:35] the Assyrians way back but you've only
[1:06:37] struck it three times right how many
[1:06:46] times you want to strike I'm starting to
[1:06:49] think that's right back to our story I
[1:06:54] look at the situation I think actually
[1:06:56] this is not a good situation
[1:06:58] I would rather rather bend enough to
[1:07:00] work at all he could give us life to
[1:07:02] ministry because why do we want us brain
[1:07:05] on all this look eat this wheeze and
[1:07:09] please all right for goodness sake our
[1:07:14] wheeze
[1:07:18] so here's the man with the call of God
[1:07:21] on his life - to labor in the word of
[1:07:26] God and during the week he's testing
[1:07:29] wheeze and his mind has taken up with
[1:07:33] testing other people's wheeze hey I feel
[1:07:42] like you know you get the arrow
[1:07:43] defeating hang on hang on hang on
[1:07:47] he doesn't have to test wheeze during
[1:07:49] the week if we so desire that he doesn't
[1:07:55] then he doesn't have to if we want that
[1:08:00] and we can have it we can have it we can
[1:08:06] have it if we want it if we don't want
[1:08:08] to go and possess it he'll keep testing
[1:08:09] wheeze during the week and be tired and
[1:08:13] try and labor and all that during all
[1:08:14] this but if we want it if we desire it
[1:08:19] because now this is a fight of faith
[1:08:20] right and we're pushing forward if we
[1:08:23] want it we can say actually no I don't
[1:08:28] want you testing wheeze during the week
[1:08:29] I want you to do now we think about
[1:08:34] there what it would cost now I can say
[1:08:36] this right so I think for myself and we
[1:08:38] have a talk with brother handy and few
[1:08:40] of us and we think mm-hmm we don't like
[1:08:43] the situation how much is it gonna cost
[1:08:45] to have him I don't talk about as much
[1:08:48] but I'm just saying this to give an
[1:08:49] example of things right how much is it
[1:08:51] gonna cost to but I have to have him not
[1:08:54] have to work what's it gonna cost how
[1:08:56] much per month scientists are not
[1:08:59] actually on a very high wage believe it
[1:09:00] or not that's Thames Cafe workers your
[1:09:05] humble tradesman gets paid more than a
[1:09:07] scientist right but how much is it going
[1:09:12] to cost we think that much okay the in
[1:09:16] its how much we're gonna end up giving
[1:09:18] because that's what it takes
[1:09:20] let's do this now you know who knows
[1:09:24] right Andy
[1:09:26] he's always up for a fight of faith if
[1:09:29] you ever say let's claim this he's right
[1:09:31] there he's right you haven't finished
[1:09:33] your sentence yet and he's running ahead
[1:09:36] okay have you ever desire to do anything
[1:09:42] radical for the Lord and you want a
[1:09:43] buddy
[1:09:43] go see Andy he'll be doing it while
[1:09:47] you're still thinking about it
[1:09:53] but I don't care how it's gonna happen
[1:09:58] but but I think to myself then if that's
[1:10:01] what we want then let's do this let's do
[1:10:05] it what happen is we desire it then he
[1:10:09] doesn't have to do that during the week
[1:10:10] during the week he can be he can be
[1:10:12] laboring and he can be giving things and
[1:10:14] working in the work of the Lord and
[1:10:16] spending instead of that much time
[1:10:18] because we in that much time in the
[1:10:19] kingdom of God will be pushed forward to
[1:10:21] me that's a win-win situation for him
[1:10:23] for us for everyone on thinking okay
[1:10:24] then let's do this right now
[1:10:28] now I can say this but my faith we
[1:10:30] halfway there every months we're just
[1:10:33] pushing towards it we're halfway there
[1:10:36] because we believe it and things are
[1:10:39] going to happen the way we want them to
[1:10:40] because we believe it now we could just
[1:10:43] sit back and not do anything but we have
[1:10:46] the ability to create this thing we can
[1:10:48] create that if that's what we desire we
[1:10:52] have the ability to create it Satan
[1:10:54] knows it and all the time is gonna be
[1:10:56] trying to bluff us you can't do it what
[1:10:57] if it doesn't work this is it and it'll
[1:11:00] work it's gonna work so he and I don't
[1:11:01] really get on Satan and we always had
[1:11:04] disagreements all the time we disagree
[1:11:07] but who believes that can happen now
[1:11:14] just to get because this is what we're
[1:11:17] talking about you know I think okay then
[1:11:21] I'm gonna act and faith only kept in
[1:11:24] faith and faith and faith I'm gonna
[1:11:26] start striking the ground these arrows
[1:11:28] I'm not just gonna stop it like or maybe
[1:11:32] two days a week you can have off no we
[1:11:34] want the whole week off we're gonna
[1:11:36] start striking
[1:11:37] we get one shot at this people we get
[1:11:40] one shot at this this is our one shot we
[1:11:43] get this is what we get we can either
[1:11:46] sit back and fear well we can possess
[1:11:49] anything we want to possess we get one
[1:11:53] chance it's up to us how that chance
[1:11:56] turns out it's actually up to us when
[1:11:59] you submit your life to the Lord and
[1:12:00] find his will it's up to you to go and
[1:12:03] do it it's up to you there was a brother
[1:12:07] I forget his name but you might know the
[1:12:08] story there was a I think your tongues
[1:12:11] and interpretations and and he said move
[1:12:13] from here over to a certain place and in
[1:12:17] another lady spoke afterwards indeed
[1:12:18] everything will fall into place nothing
[1:12:21] happened and he waited and waited and
[1:12:22] waited waited and waited for everything
[1:12:26] to fall in place and then maybe a year
[1:12:29] later he said well why did this happen
[1:12:30] that way and he said I didn't tell her
[1:12:31] to save it she said that you got taught
[1:12:35] to move you should have just started
[1:12:38] selling up do whatever you got to do do
[1:12:41] whatever you got to do when we came here
[1:12:43] we had nothing
[1:12:44] I wasn't Bibbit we had nothing no house
[1:12:45] to live no job no nothing I say miss
[1:12:48] Shannon earlier today we were talking
[1:12:49] about when we moved to Wellington we had
[1:12:51] five children and nothing nothing you
[1:12:54] guys moved with stuff me we moving those
[1:12:56] stuff oh we had a bit of stuff but
[1:12:59] nothing right no job had no job no way
[1:13:04] to live really no nothing within eight
[1:13:10] months we had God somehow we had a
[1:13:13] business that I couldn't afford we
[1:13:14] bought it we had awesome house out in
[1:13:15] the country with Christian landlords
[1:13:17] that were there and we had a great
[1:13:20] fellowship but that was because we
[1:13:24] believed it and we decided we're going
[1:13:26] to walk into it see we could have held
[1:13:29] back and said Armour but what if it
[1:13:31] doesn't work out that's what we all do
[1:13:35] don't do that anymore
[1:13:37] don't do it you don't have to do it like
[1:13:41] that if you can't believe if you feel
[1:13:45] any sort of inkling to do something for
[1:13:47] the Lord or anything any promise you
[1:13:48] want to possess if you can't believe it
[1:13:50] you can have it if you've got children
[1:13:51] you want them serving the Lord if you
[1:13:53] believe it you can have it if you
[1:13:56] believe it you can have it he knows by
[1:13:59] the quadrate digs you know there's a
[1:14:02] time when he was walking around probably
[1:14:03] his pants halfway down his backside
[1:14:05] listen to rap music thinking he was one
[1:14:07] of the boys and nobody saw him anything
[1:14:10] but you know he saw something in him his
[1:14:13] mother she said I don't believe that
[1:14:16] it's not Quadra he's not going to be
[1:14:18] like that he's the son of God he's gonna
[1:14:21] be a believer and she believed it let's
[1:14:26] not homelessness him here the image that
[1:14:28] I have of him is what he's going to be
[1:14:29] because I believe it do you know what he
[1:14:32] had to do conform to the image that she
[1:14:35] had believe that's what he had to do he
[1:14:39] didn't know what was changing him but it
[1:14:40] was faith was changing him because
[1:14:42] somebody believed if she didn't believe
[1:14:47] who knows what might happen this is how
[1:14:53] it works friends we are gods we have
[1:14:57] creative power to achieve and do
[1:14:58] anything and when we know that will of
[1:15:01] God in our life we will see the promises
[1:15:02] we have power to it to attain anything
[1:15:05] we want don't be fearful I'll say this
[1:15:13] thing I'm going to close okay this is
[1:15:19] going on the video but that's all right
[1:15:20] I wrote a song called I will not fear
[1:15:25] well hosting Kempe me and Jesus Christ
[1:15:28] I'll always have the victory this is my
[1:15:31] hour this is my fight I will be strong
[1:15:33] in the Lord and in the power of his
[1:15:34] might I'll put forth my sword in the
[1:15:36] name of the Lord my bow will not turn
[1:15:40] back my sword will not return empty I'm
[1:15:43] a mighty warrior fearless in battle
[1:15:45] moving forward in the name of the Lord
[1:15:47] and I have seen from a line of kings
[1:15:50] and I'll reign for eternity I've got
[1:15:55] this the Lord gave me this I'm gonna
[1:16:00] call it and a natural terms a crazy idea
[1:16:03] to make the movie on the life of brother
[1:16:04] venom that's a crazy idea I don't know
[1:16:07] what a camera was and I got this thought
[1:16:11] but I but something clicked and I
[1:16:13] thought yep that's what I'm gonna do it
[1:16:16] alone see for me to do that let's do it
[1:16:18] released that released that mmm okay
[1:16:26] they still film course yeah they're a
[1:16:29] film course for a year five children
[1:16:31] four children learn have it okay now can
[1:16:35] kind of figure out how movies work oh
[1:16:36] this is interesting
[1:16:39] just stop doing it start possessing it
[1:16:43] and it actually comes together in front
[1:16:45] of you need about four million dollars
[1:16:47] boy what's what's harder to say what's
[1:16:52] harder to say it's four million dollars
[1:16:55] hard no it's not hard it's not they're
[1:16:59] not hard can be created it's not hard
[1:17:05] Satan will tell you you can't you can't
[1:17:07] you can't lift as they were saying
[1:17:08] actually the Lord taught me to therefore
[1:17:09] I can I'm a mighty warrior fearless in
[1:17:12] battle therefore I can I'm going to and
[1:17:16] he hates it he hates it when you realize
[1:17:19] you can cuz every step you take forty
[1:17:21] has to step back because darkness cannot
[1:17:23] possess darkness has to move backwards
[1:17:25] and there's nothing he can do
[1:17:27] and in this fellowship of this love he
[1:17:30] cannot take any run in this fellowship
[1:17:32] as his love to because hate does can't
[1:17:34] possess I'm gonna close this here don't
[1:17:42] forget this right don't just live an
[1:17:44] ordinary life
