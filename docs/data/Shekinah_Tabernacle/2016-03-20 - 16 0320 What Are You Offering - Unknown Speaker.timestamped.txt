[20:04] hallelujah amen if you want to have your
[20:06] seats this morning and um just uh those
[20:08] that are sharing testimony um for the
[20:11] Youth Camp would could could come forth
[20:13] and prepare yourselves
[20:19] amen do we want to use
[20:22] this we'll just
[20:27] leave
[20:53] you kind of think you wouldn't be
[20:54] nervous speaking to people you ignore so
[20:56] well but anyway um my testimony comes
[21:00] from before the camp even because after
[21:02] we had our camp in
[21:04] February man it was just tough I was
[21:07] down just I can't even explain it but it
[21:10] was just a really bad time for me and I
[21:13] just couldn't get out of it and I didn't
[21:14] know why or what and I know you get
[21:16] attacked but man it was just carrying on
[21:19] and then I know brother Kyra digs had
[21:20] heard one of his sermons and he said if
[21:22] you're going through a trial the worst
[21:24] thing to do is to surround yourself with
[21:25] negative people and so um
[21:28] I didn't experience that but it started
[21:31] with sister Shannon where we had the
[21:32] barbecue and she asked us all to give a
[21:34] testimony and that just started breaking
[21:37] that feeling that I was having because
[21:39] it was so good just to hear about what
[21:40] the Lord had been doing for people and
[21:42] so that brought to remembrance what
[21:44] brother kidra had preached because then
[21:45] it made sense why don't surround
[21:47] yourself with that negativity anyway so
[21:51] um we went to the camp and in the car I
[21:54] was still thinking oh it's a youth camp
[21:56] and then I realized well I can still be
[21:57] touched by the the Lord in the services
[21:59] so it's not to say I'm just going then I
[22:02] can't have an expectation and um I was
[22:05] originally just meant to be a babysitter
[22:08] and the Saturday morning it turned out I
[22:10] became a youth
[22:11] sitter and so just to back check
[22:14] slightly with a couple of weeks our mind
[22:16] had been speaking to me and he said to
[22:17] me do you know how to relax he said you
[22:20] never have fun anymore you never make
[22:22] jokes anymore you work at work you work
[22:23] at home that's all you're doing all the
[22:25] time and I I say it as a joke I didn't
[22:27] really but I was like can I go do the
[22:29] washing you're done yet you know that's
[22:31] how I was feeling and so the Lord just
[22:34] took me that Saturday morning and he
[22:36] kicked me out my comfort zone 100% like
[22:39] I was not prepared to be with the
[22:41] children or the youth I didn't know what
[22:43] to do I didn't know how to handle it and
[22:44] I was just like oh my goodness but the
[22:46] Lord was so faithful and he's just
[22:48] changed so much in me from that youth
[22:50] camp and just being with the children it
[22:52] was just such a
[22:54] blessing and um let me see where am I
[22:58] I've also have new eyes for the Youth I
[23:00] didn't think I would have a burden or
[23:03] not that I didn't like youth but I
[23:05] didn't expect what the lord gave me that
[23:07] weekend and seeing the children though
[23:10] the world is calling to them so loudly
[23:13] and he just gave me a new found burden
[23:15] for them because man it's hard for them
[23:19] and so I just I want to pray for them
[23:21] and I want to reach them and I don't
[23:23] want to the Lord wants to help them and
[23:26] I just see his burden for them and so um
[23:29] I'm appreciative of that as well and
[23:32] there was also one particular person
[23:35] that I didn't get along with very well
[23:37] she just rubed me up the wrong way all
[23:39] the time and afterwards Ouran just
[23:41] brought me to memory and he said you
[23:43] were lost and you were know better than
[23:46] what she might be and at sometimes I
[23:49] think we forget that that we need to
[23:51] have compassion for those people because
[23:53] we were not perfect before either and
[23:56] that maybe there's something there there
[23:58] that's why the Satan was actually trying
[24:00] to keep keep us away so if I ever am
[24:03] allowed in the Lord Wills I will go for
[24:05] another camp and then try and see
[24:07] through different
[24:08] eyes and so um then what happened was
[24:11] when I came home man Monday and Tuesday
[24:13] was the best days I've ever had it was
[24:15] just glorious it was wonderful I haven't
[24:17] been there happy in such a long time and
[24:20] from the Sunday I had an expectation for
[24:22] our Wednesday night meeting I was just
[24:24] like the Lord is just going to be good
[24:25] to us the Wednesday I just know it and I
[24:27] I kept walking it the whole week and
[24:29] Wednesday when I got home Reuben started
[24:32] just rubbing me up the wrong way and
[24:34] it's the first time in my life I've ever
[24:35] been able to do it but I was just like
[24:37] no Wednesday is going to be a blessing
[24:40] nothing is ruining it for me and we went
[24:43] um and ate at the loins before and all
[24:46] the kids were screaming and shouting and
[24:48] rough riding and I was just like it's
[24:50] going to be a good night the Lord is
[24:52] going to bless us it's going to be
[24:53] wonderful and I just kept my focus on
[24:55] him and so now it makes sense with the
[24:57] Lord says focus on him through
[24:59] everything because he did he he did um
[25:02] bring that to pass and I don't know I
[25:05] wrote the poem last night if I can share
[25:08] it and uh I hope it blesses the Lord the
[25:12] walk we walk because we're called to
[25:14] face the trials to meet the Lord to
[25:17] shout and sing in Victory for Jesus my
[25:20] Savior has Set Me Free I pray therefore
[25:23] unto my king to help me spread his Light
[25:26] Within to be filled from the gushing
[25:29] Waters of Life the stream more powerful
[25:31] than any Strife for just as Moses smoke
[25:35] that rock the glory of the Lord came
[25:37] bursting forth not just a trickle or a
[25:40] small stream but a powerful force that
[25:42] none had ever seen for that water was to
[25:45] quench The Thirst of 2 million people in
[25:48] all of their herd in a land that was
[25:50] Barren and dry the Lord in his power
[25:53] brought new life and as the Lord Our God
[25:56] helped the Israelites that day so the
[25:58] Lord is here to fight for us today
[26:01] surrender yourself lay down your life
[26:03] allow the amazing savior to be your one
[26:05] and only light allow the Holy Spirit to
[26:08] flow within then to gush out his grace
[26:11] and mercy to all who sin bring forth
[26:13] healing and Revival in his name for
[26:16] Jesus is forever yesterday today the
[26:18] same so thank you I I had a blessed time
[26:21] it was
[26:26] amazing
[26:49] it was a very fun time at the camp and I
[26:56] um oh yeah they we did a thing when they
[26:59] blindfolded me and I had to follow the
[27:01] voice and eventually I got duct taped to
[27:03] the chair because I listened to the
[27:04] wrong
[27:06] voice that's good
[27:10] enough uh yes the the camp was a
[27:13] blessing um yeah there was uh three
[27:16] three pastors there and was brother
[27:18] Daniel white and then was brother Ben GL
[27:20] and brother ALR Robinson and and they
[27:23] were geared up for the Youth they were
[27:27] there and uh it was just wonderful to
[27:30] see them work and to see them pray and
[27:32] to see the the burden they have for the
[27:34] Youth and then uh I I got all the youth
[27:38] in the the first morning I'm way off my
[27:39] nose but it doesn't matter so I got to
[27:42] say hello to every youth because I had
[27:44] to mark them off to see if they they and
[27:46] so I got to to meet them at day one and
[27:48] I got to meet them on on the Sunday and
[27:50] the Monday when they left home and it
[27:52] was it was sad to see how this world is
[27:55] attacking them and winning
[27:58] and physically winning the battles and
[28:01] and it's and it's real talk and it's
[28:03] it's our youth our young youth here we
[28:05] are blessed brothers and sisters to have
[28:07] them to have fathers and mothers that
[28:10] care and that love them and that pour
[28:12] everything they have into their children
[28:14] and that pray in Timothy it says pray
[28:16] without seizing I cannot say it enough
[28:19] pray for your children and keep his
[28:22] Commandments and be true to him and he
[28:24] will answer your prayer because our kids
[28:27] need
[28:28] they are being attacked by Hollywood
[28:29] they are being attacked by cell phones
[28:32] internet you don't understand this is
[28:34] this is a youth camp and we have to
[28:36] Pride kids away from their cell phones
[28:39] we have to go catch them where they
[28:40] signal the whole time to bring them back
[28:42] to a camp the world is geared up for
[28:45] them and and and it's such a it's such a
[28:48] fine-tuned machine you our enemy is
[28:51] great but God is greater but the reality
[28:54] is he's still out there and he's lurking
[28:56] and he is is like the perfect Predator
[29:00] if you look in Wild in in the wild and
[29:02] it just came to pass last night I was
[29:04] just sitting and I was thinking I looked
[29:05] at the wild it could be the biggest line
[29:08] there is it will go for the weakest it
[29:11] will go for the wounded it will go for
[29:13] the smallest it likes the easy K why
[29:16] should we give it to him you pray for
[29:18] your kids you pray for them and you give
[29:21] them everything you have you live your
[29:22] life you shine your light but you give
[29:25] them everything you have because guess
[29:26] what they are on the menu we fight our
[29:30] burdens we fight our battles but we've
[29:31] got one another we've got understanding
[29:33] we've got wisdom we've got wounds we've
[29:35] been scarred they fresh they're easy
[29:39] Target and all this world needs to do is
[29:42] try to catch them so I'm not saying go
[29:45] legalistic way and lock them in a room
[29:47] I'm saying pray without seizing I'm
[29:49] saying give them everything you can so
[29:51] the seed cuz it was a blessed camp and
[29:54] it opened my eyes I thought message
[29:57] children you know they grow up we've got
[29:59] the truth they'll walk in that light
[30:02] their children just like any other
[30:03] children they get tricked by the same
[30:06] tricks you know the the story of David I
[30:08] want to really share it so the Monday
[30:10] morning uh brother Daniel um put duck
[30:13] duck tap his eyes closed and he said
[30:16] listen to The
[30:17] Voice and so he made an obstacle course
[30:20] in the camp was really really good and
[30:22] he had to climb over ches blindfolded
[30:24] and he did it I we can give him a hand
[30:26] of lost definitely afterwards he climbed
[30:29] over it he listened to the voice the
[30:31] voice said go left he went left the go
[30:33] said go right he went right he listened
[30:35] to the voice and then he got him on
[30:37] stage and for one second cuz David was
[30:39] tired this was a very long long type of
[30:42] trial for him and you know so he was
[30:43] standing on stage very very relaxed and
[30:46] brother vaner sster went up and he took
[30:49] duct tape and he just said to me pulled
[30:51] up his chair and he said please sit down
[30:53] cuz you must be tired and as he sat down
[30:55] he duct taped into the chair and he goes
[30:57] you listen to the wrong voice and it's
[30:59] that easy so while he was waiting on God
[31:03] while he was living the other voice came
[31:05] in and said but why don't you rest a bit
[31:08] because you must be tired you know and
[31:10] and and it was a blessing because it was
[31:12] the Holy Spirit taking over the meeting
[31:14] and that happened it wasn't planned it
[31:16] was just happened and then and then of
[31:19] course brother Daniel went back and and
[31:20] he freed him and he said but God's word
[31:22] God's truth and God's mercy will free us
[31:24] from this but be careful of The Voice
[31:27] voice you listen to and and and so the
[31:29] theme of the camp this I just want to
[31:31] tell you is the theme was whose son is
[31:33] this so I was speaking where David were
[31:36] walking to face Goliath and and Saul
[31:40] looked at um uh at what was the captain
[31:43] of the host and he said to him whose son
[31:45] is that because there was a character in
[31:48] that son that he recognized is not
[31:50] normal that's not the human that's not
[31:52] the every boy out there there is a
[31:54] character facing that giant in the power
[31:56] of God
[31:57] and so our sons that's what I want to
[31:59] ask you our kids as well I want them to
[32:02] ask whose son is that and not my son or
[32:05] your son but the but the Lord's son cuz
[32:08] he doesn't he's not a grandfather he's a
[32:10] father amen and and all of you are sons
[32:12] of God so yeah the the whole Camp was a
[32:15] a life-changing event um I never thought
[32:18] I would love people so much and have fun
[32:20] with them and see so much character
[32:22] those kids got character Godly character
[32:24] in them they just need us to to just rub
[32:27] it and just bring it out and feed it and
[32:29] give it and nourish it and so that the
[32:31] devil can't just distract them because
[32:33] it's so easy so pray for our youth
[32:37] please don't don't stop praying for them
[32:38] and if there's anyone and I and I put it
[32:40] out anyone fathers or sisters that wants
[32:43] to to help with the youth come anytime
[32:48] we don't we won't ref come just be there
[32:51] um even if it's for a skit or it's for a
[32:53] for a musical night for them or a DVD
[32:55] night where we can show them something
[32:57] if you've got any suggestions
[32:59] come we need it they need they need us
[33:02] they really do need us and uh yeah just
[33:04] to end it off I think we can give David
[33:06] a warm hand of Applause because he did
[33:08] so well and we're really proud of him
[33:10] man really
[33:12] proud thank

[33:25] the yes you

[33:42] that we're in right now and I just felt
[33:44] that God is more stronger today and
[33:49] um um I just really enjoyed it because
[33:53] it's it was just our time this year and
[33:55] I thought me and de could be stronger in
[33:57] character from from that and I found
[34:01] that we have a lot of Trials like during

[55:35] musicians amen well good morning
[55:37] everyone it's good to be home amen um
[55:42] I'm sorry for everyone who is at camp
[55:44] but I'm basically going to preach the
[55:45] same sermon I preached at Camp I just
[55:46] can't get it out of my system I have
[55:48] another sermon here but I just I'm just
[55:50] I just can't escape this so once I get
[55:53] out of my system then I guess guess we
[55:55] can move on but um so let's turn to
[55:58] Leviticus chapter
[56:04] 1 amen so the camp was a blessing it was
[56:07] good to see just it's amazing to see
[56:10] Armand and Shantel just working among
[56:11] the youth and they br down some walls
[56:14] and you know they really did a fantastic
[56:17] job amen you know cuz it's 99% of the
[56:21] time it's not the uh it's it's it's
[56:23] really those times cuz Hey they've sat
[56:25] in church all their life those kids and
[56:28] they've and they've heard probably the
[56:29] the the the word far more than we've had
[56:32] hot dinners you know but it takes that
[56:35] little more amen and normally a lot of
[56:38] those things are broken when it's just
[56:39] fellowship and spending time and you
[56:42] know so it was it was a real joy to see
[56:44] that and yeah so so Lord willing we're
[56:47] going to have another camp at Labor
[56:48] weekend for the Youth and maybe we could
[56:50] bring some slightly older youth as well
[56:54] but we'll see what we can do amen uh
[56:57] Leviticus 1: 1:4 and then we're going to
[56:59] read uh from Genesis
[57:02] 27 and the
[57:04] lordes and out ofac of saying Speak the
[57:09] children sayto them if any of you bring
[57:13] offering the he shalling your offering
[57:16] of the CLE and of the of
[57:18] the he be offering a sacrifice of the
[57:22] let him offer a without he shall offer
[57:25] of his own voluntary will at the door of
[57:29] the Tabernacle of the congregation of
[57:31] the Lord and he shall put his hand upon
[57:33] the head of the burnt offering and it
[57:35] shall be accepted for him to make
[57:37] atonement for him amen and we'll go to
[57:40] Genesis chapter 27 and this is a we're
[57:43] going to read verses 1 to 1 to 24 I know
[57:46] this is um this is quite a familiar
[57:47] scripture to us it's the story of uh
[57:50] Jacob stealing Esau's
[57:53] blessing but this is very important in
[57:55] this day now that we're alive in
[57:58] because uh everyone every believer feels
[58:02] they're
[58:02] unworthy and every believer feels in
[58:05] their own selves they don't deserve the
[58:06] blessings of God yeah I'll say amen for
[58:10] myself or maybe and yeah amen so you
[58:13] know but notice here okay just going to
[58:16] read from verse one and it came to pass
[58:18] that when Isaac was old and his eyes
[58:20] were dim so that he could not see he
[58:21] called Esau his eldest son and said unto
[58:24] him my son and he said unto him behold
[58:26] here am I and he said behold now I am
[58:29] old I know not the day of my death now
[58:31] therefore take I pray thee thy weapons
[58:33] thy quiver and thy bow and go out to the
[58:35] field and take me some venison and make
[58:39] me Savory meat such as I love and bring
[58:41] it to me that I may eat and that my soul
[58:43] may bless thee before I die and Rebecca
[58:46] heard when Isaac sped Esau a son and
[58:48] Esau went to the field to hunt for
[58:50] venison and to bring it and Rebecca
[58:52] spake unto Jacob her son saying behold I
[58:56] uh heard thy father speak unto Esau thy
[58:59] brother saying bring me Venison and make
[59:01] me Savory meat that I may eat and bless
[59:03] thee before the Lord uh before my death
[59:06] now therefore my son obey my voice
[59:08] according to that which I command thee
[59:11] go now to the flock and fetch me from
[59:13] the two good of the goats and I will
[59:15] make them Savory meat for thy father
[59:17] such as he loveth and thou shalt bring
[59:20] it to thy father that he may eat and
[59:23] that he may bless thee before his death
[59:25] and Jacob said to Rebecca his mother
[59:27] behold Esau my brother is a hay man and
[59:29] I'm a smooth man my father pray
[59:31] Adventure will F me and I shall seem to
[59:35] him as a deceiver and I shall bring a
[59:37] curse upon me not a blessing and his
[59:40] mother said unto him upon Me Be Thy
[59:42] curse my son only obey my voice and go
[59:45] and fetch me them and he went and
[59:47] fetched and brought them to his mother
[59:49] and his mother made Savory meat such as
[59:52] his father loved and Rebecca took goodly
[59:54] r of her Elder son Esau which was uh
[59:57] which were with her in the house and put
[59:59] them upon Jacob her younger son and he
[1:00:02] put the skins of the kids of the goats
[1:00:05] upon his hands and upon the smooth of
[1:00:07] his neck and he gave the Savory meat and
[1:00:09] the bread which he had prepared into the
[1:00:11] hand of her son Jacob and he came unto
[1:00:14] her father and said my father and he
[1:00:16] said H Here Am I who art thou my son and
[1:00:19] Jacob said unto his father I am Esau thy
[1:00:21] firstborn I have done according as thou
[1:00:23] B me arise I pray thee eat sit and eat
[1:00:26] of the my venison that my soul may uh
[1:00:30] that thy soul may bless me and Isaac
[1:00:32] said unto his son how is it that thou
[1:00:35] Hast so uh how how is it that thou Hast
[1:00:39] found it so quickly my son and he said
[1:00:42] because the Lord thy God brought it to
[1:00:44] me and Isaac said unto Jacob come now I
[1:00:47] pray the that I may feel thee my son
[1:00:49] whether thou be my very son Esau or not
[1:00:52] and Jacob went near unto Isaac's father
[1:00:54] and he felt him and he said the voice is
[1:00:56] Jacob's voice but the hands are the
[1:00:57] hands of Esau and he discerned not
[1:01:00] because his hands were hay as his
[1:01:03] brother Esau's hand so he blessed him
[1:01:05] and he said who art uh art thou my very
[1:01:08] son Esau and he said I am and he said
[1:01:10] bring it near to me and I will eat of my
[1:01:13] son's venison that my soul may bless
[1:01:16] thee and he brought it near to him and
[1:01:18] he did eat and he drank him uh and he
[1:01:21] brought him wine and he drank and his
[1:01:23] father Isaac said unto him come come now
[1:01:25] come near now and kiss me my son and he
[1:01:27] came near and kissed him and he smelled
[1:01:29] the smell of his rment uh and blessed
[1:01:31] him and said see the smell of my son is
[1:01:34] the smell of the field which the Lord
[1:01:35] has blessed therefore God give thee of
[1:01:37] the Dew of Heaven and the fatness of the
[1:01:39] earth and plenty of corn and wine let
[1:01:41] people serve thee and Nations bow down
[1:01:42] to thee be Lord over thy Brethren and
[1:01:44] let thy mother's sons bow down to thee
[1:01:46] curs be everyone that curseth thee and
[1:01:49] blessed be he that blesseth thee and it
[1:01:52] came to pass as soon as Isaac had made
[1:01:54] to blessing Jacob that Jacob was yet
[1:01:56] scarce gone out from the presence of
[1:01:57] Isaac his father when Esau his brother
[1:01:59] came in from his hunting amen may we
[1:02:02] just leave it there may the Lord bless
[1:02:03] his word you may have your
[1:02:08] seats and I want to I want to pose this
[1:02:11] question uh to you this morning what are
[1:02:14] you presenting to God that's what I want
[1:02:15] to ask but first I want to make a
[1:02:17] comment you know I think we really need
[1:02:19] to pray that we move the church halfway
[1:02:20] between here and
[1:02:22] cap I feel that I'll be honest I feel
[1:02:25] that Wednesday when we have prayer
[1:02:27] meeting God comes down like he does
[1:02:30] everyone needs to experience that amen
[1:02:32] everyone needs in that presence it's not
[1:02:34] enough just for us you just here
[1:02:36] everyone everyone needs to be in because
[1:02:38] if there's not the supernatural element
[1:02:40] of of the message of of this gospel that
[1:02:43] we have is the most important part the
[1:02:45] Supernatural part it's not just the word
[1:02:47] spoken or the doctrine or you know it's
[1:02:50] the Supernatural part of it is the most
[1:02:52] important part amen cuz what's what's
[1:02:54] good having a whole bunch of seed in the
[1:02:56] ground unless it's been watered amen
[1:02:58] amen so what's the good hearing the word
[1:02:59] unless the spirit comes and quickens it
[1:03:01] and brings it to life amen amen so we
[1:03:04] need times like that because gifts for
[1:03:07] gifts to operate in the body it takes
[1:03:09] the anointing of God to operate the gift
[1:03:11] amen so there's gifts that lay dominant
[1:03:13] people but the spirit need to come and
[1:03:15] begin to anoint that gift and to use it
[1:03:18] amen so we really need to pray seriously
[1:03:20] now we need to pray that this building
[1:03:22] is not here but it's limiting or
[1:03:24] somewhere now prices are twice as much
[1:03:27] all these things but there must be
[1:03:28] something I believe the Lord wants us
[1:03:30] all
[1:03:31] together amen amen that's just that's
[1:03:35] just how I
[1:03:36] feel because we need those because it's
[1:03:39] not just camp we had camp on
[1:03:42] Wednesday amen we had camp on Wednesday
[1:03:45] and it's not just every camp we have the
[1:03:48] we have those times all the time but we
[1:03:50] need to be in those times all the time
[1:03:52] amen amen because why do why do youth
[1:03:56] leave because they don't see God real my
[1:03:59] my my my heart's burden is that everyone
[1:04:03] who comes in these doors whatever they
[1:04:05] do with it's up to them but they all
[1:04:07] them would have a testimony God is alive
[1:04:09] in this place amen that is that is that
[1:04:11] is my burden amen is that everyone would
[1:04:14] say hey God is real here doesn't matter
[1:04:16] if they accept it or reject it that's up
[1:04:17] to them that's between them in God but I
[1:04:19] don't want to give them some excuse oh
[1:04:21] they just a different kind of people you
[1:04:23] know and they just believe something
[1:04:24] it's more than that but that God they
[1:04:27] would say hey they have God there's a
[1:04:29] presence in this place or When We Gather
[1:04:31] Wherever We Gather they can say there's
[1:04:32] a presence there it's not these four
[1:04:34] walls amen it's you that come and then
[1:04:36] he comes amen amen so wherever we gather
[1:04:40] I want that testimony and especially our
[1:04:42] children we're talking to analy and
[1:04:45] we're saying and we were talking about
[1:04:46] atmosphere and you know when he Jesus
[1:04:48] comes into the room and he does and she
[1:04:51] she knew what we were talking
[1:04:53] about
[1:04:55] amen and those things will never they I
[1:04:58] don't believe those kind of experiences
[1:05:01] they can those experiences can never
[1:05:02] leave them no matter where they go on
[1:05:05] life something in them will say you
[1:05:07] remember there you remember there when
[1:05:10] God was real there and then there and
[1:05:12] then there and then there that's what
[1:05:14] they need amen amen that's what that's
[1:05:17] what everyone needs that people more
[1:05:19] than just pray but they but something
[1:05:22] you know I think the problem with this
[1:05:24] message I'll be honest people in this
[1:05:25] message in our Humanity now this is I'm
[1:05:28] just I'm just talking to you and then
[1:05:29] we'll go to the scripture but the
[1:05:31] problem is and I found that in our
[1:05:33] Humanity if people lean one way then our
[1:05:36] Humanity will lean the other way and
[1:05:39] people have done the same thing in the
[1:05:40] message when it comes to the spiritual
[1:05:42] gifts because I see Pentecost has made
[1:05:44] what they've made of it sure they've
[1:05:46] made what they have of it but doesn't
[1:05:48] mean it's wrong in its place right amen
[1:05:52] that's right so but then so people lean
[1:05:54] people have cabbage down one side and
[1:05:56] they take the quote and they say that
[1:05:58] you know the great mystery in this end
[1:06:00] time is the is the mystery of receiving
[1:06:02] the Holy Ghost without sensation but
[1:06:04] they only take half of the statement the
[1:06:07] other half is but the person of Jesus
[1:06:09] Christ working in the person amen and
[1:06:12] you can't tell me if de comes and dwells
[1:06:14] in you you can't say that you wouldn't
[1:06:16] remember when that happened when the
[1:06:18] light went on when something happened
[1:06:19] you can't say I don't I don't know when
[1:06:21] that was you should be able to look back
[1:06:23] in your life say something happened to
[1:06:25] me there amen you saw on the day of
[1:06:28] Pentecost when when the day of Pentecost
[1:06:29] had fully come they knew something had
[1:06:31] happened amen Peter didn't stand up and
[1:06:34] say well I think this is that spoken by
[1:06:35] the prophet Joel he said this is that
[1:06:37] spoken by the prophet Joel and the
[1:06:39] people saw that their lives were
[1:06:41] different and then you see through the
[1:06:42] book of Acts when the people received
[1:06:43] the Holy Ghost their lives glorified God
[1:06:46] hallelujah amen to the life that they
[1:06:48] begin to live now glorified God yes sir
[1:06:51] amen the prophet sees after the opening
[1:06:53] of the seals the candle got to be
[1:06:55] lit and what's happened is people have
[1:06:57] gathered around Doctrine but gathering
[1:07:00] around Doctrine doesn't keep people it
[1:07:02] doesn't give it doesn't produce the
[1:07:04] character of Christ in the people it
[1:07:07] takes the life of God to come in and
[1:07:09] make that word live thank you Lord amen
[1:07:12] that's what it takes and that's why
[1:07:15] that's why we need services and we need
[1:07:17] camps and we need prayer meetings where
[1:07:19] everyone says he's real amen you know
[1:07:22] they have they have I see you know you
[1:07:24] see youth camps overseas like you know
[1:07:25] brother Tim PR they have like 500 600
[1:07:27] youth come they have a youth camp and
[1:07:30] then one of them he said uh they had a
[1:07:32] prayer line the whole place just went
[1:07:33] all this youth went through a prayer
[1:07:34] line and then he looked up and said
[1:07:36] where's all the youth gone after this
[1:07:38] Mighty other God came down and they're
[1:07:39] all in the gym just through from where
[1:07:41] they were and they're all praying
[1:07:42] together and praising God and there's
[1:07:44] this one young guy saying it's real it's
[1:07:47] real it's real Hallelujah why cuz the
[1:07:49] anointing he knew God was real now what
[1:07:52] he did with it that's up to him but
[1:07:54] he had that
[1:07:56] testimony amen and that's my burden is
[1:07:59] that everyone would say he's real it's
[1:08:01] real it's real yes sir amen and not
[1:08:03] because they see it affecting someone
[1:08:05] because he affects
[1:08:07] them amen but we're unfortunately people
[1:08:10] have made it a scary thing oh you
[1:08:14] know if I'm accused of being too
[1:08:16] Pentecostal so be it praise amen I don't
[1:08:19] care amen if we walk with the truth I
[1:08:21] don't mean we don't make that the main
[1:08:24] thing if we have the truth and we walk
[1:08:25] in it then God will anoint it and it'll
[1:08:27] do what it wants to do amen so if we're
[1:08:30] walking with him then God will come and
[1:08:32] do what he wants to do and so we need
[1:08:35] times young and old where God comes down
[1:08:39] because it really the spirit manifests
[1:08:41] what's in the person am me it says in
[1:08:44] Hebrews 6 that the rain falls you know
[1:08:46] and it falls on the falls on the herbs
[1:08:48] it falls on the you you you the tears
[1:08:50] and all these things it's actually the
[1:08:52] the rain manifest confess what's in
[1:08:54] someone it's like you take a natural
[1:08:56] seed and you look at two seeds if you
[1:08:58] don't know what it is you say I think
[1:09:00] this is a pumpkin seed and I think this
[1:09:01] is a sunflower seed or some other seed
[1:09:03] you say well you can debate about it but
[1:09:06] then put it in the right soil and then
[1:09:08] water it give it the right food and then
[1:09:09] you'll say it's pumpkin or if it's
[1:09:12] whatever
[1:09:14] amen that's why we need those types amen
[1:09:19] amen yeah because it will manifest
[1:09:22] what's in a person and it goes beyond
[1:09:24] hey God still vindicates his word and
[1:09:28] it's not just it's not just enough for
[1:09:29] the prophet to be Vindicated what about
[1:09:32] you amen these signs shall follow them
[1:09:35] that believe now don't go seeking after
[1:09:37] signs just walk in the
[1:09:39] truth amen and then he says about and
[1:09:42] then the word says that he remains
[1:09:44] faithful he cannot deny himself so if
[1:09:48] the author if the spirit of the word is
[1:09:49] in you then you cannot deny the word
[1:09:52] amen amen so if the word says this
[1:09:54] you'll say yes and you'll do it amen but
[1:09:58] then people have mentally if you go too
[1:10:00] now that is absolutely true but then if
[1:10:03] you just gather around a Doctrine and
[1:10:06] there's no life being lived that's just
[1:10:09] another ditch amen amen you got to have
[1:10:14] hey the book of Acts church was
[1:10:16] supernaturally Vindicated that's right
[1:10:18] as a body they were Vindicated and their
[1:10:21] lives were all changed how it manifested
[1:10:23] at the Apostle Paul had far greater you
[1:10:25] know Vindication I'll say than maybe
[1:10:28] Lydia who who sold purple there in the
[1:10:30] city and used her house as a church you
[1:10:32] know all these you know or other people
[1:10:35] but how the life as long as the life was
[1:10:38] manifesting that was the main thing are
[1:10:40] you following me because it's not a list
[1:10:42] of well I've done all these Supernatural
[1:10:44] things no it's being yielded and if you
[1:10:47] can say if the word says a certain thing
[1:10:50] you give yourself because if the spirit
[1:10:52] our spirit breath Witness is his that we
[1:10:54] are the sons of
[1:10:55] God
[1:10:57] Amen but there has to be there's got to
[1:10:59] be a life it's a character that's lived
[1:11:03] every day every day CH Christian is in
[1:11:06] every day of fear where God lives every
[1:11:08] day in every situation doesn't matter if
[1:11:10] you're at home you're on the street
[1:11:12] you're in the supermarket you're at
[1:11:14] church same life is
[1:11:16] lived
[1:11:18] amen so they you know we shouldn't be
[1:11:22] afraid we should expect it
[1:11:24] you know I think you know when I come to
[1:11:28] church well before I come I say Lord I
[1:11:30] want to see you do something amen amen
[1:11:33] amen I want to see you do
[1:11:36] something not the I don't want to hear
[1:11:38] some nice words or something I've never
[1:11:40] heard before necessarily I want to see
[1:11:42] you do something AMJ I want to see the
[1:11:44] word impact me and change me amen that
[1:11:47] I'm a different I'll be molded and
[1:11:49] shaped into your image more and more
[1:11:51] Lord amen he's coming for his character
[1:11:53] in a bride amen he's not coming for
[1:11:55] anything
[1:11:56] else
[1:11:58] amen
[1:12:00] okay now with
[1:12:02] that you say well that's a big now with
[1:12:05] that we'll go to Leviticus chapter
[1:12:08] 1 we have to have God now I I don't know
[1:12:12] if I can emphasize it strongly enough
[1:12:14] the spirit of God is here in such a way
[1:12:17] that he wants to he wants to do what he
[1:12:20] wants to do and in the pre hey if you
[1:12:22] jump into a show and you turn on the
[1:12:24] water you always get
[1:12:27] wet 100% of the time you get wet amen
[1:12:31] and where the presence of God is a
[1:12:32] Supernatural is happening the prophet
[1:12:34] tells us amen so how can you not step
[1:12:37] into his presence and not be changed you
[1:12:39] can be convicted conviction is good
[1:12:41] because he's given you a way of escape
[1:12:43] to to get rid of that
[1:12:44] conviction amen however you feel it's a
[1:12:47] good thing if you're happy if you feel
[1:12:49] burdened down and and convicted just
[1:12:51] just just put it right with him amen
[1:12:54] amen amen now so we we often you know
[1:12:59] people you ask you the question what are
[1:13:00] you presenting to God because many times
[1:13:03] we we we as Believers we we see the high
[1:13:07] standard of the word and we and we hear
[1:13:09] things like she is bone of his bone and
[1:13:11] life of his life and she is him the
[1:13:13] prophet says you know that the bride of
[1:13:15] Christ becomes one with Jesus Christ and
[1:13:18] when you see her you see him because the
[1:13:21] same life that is in him comes into you
[1:13:24] we saw it on the day of Pentecost Jesus
[1:13:26] said a little while the world seeth me
[1:13:28] no more speaking of the world order but
[1:13:30] you shall see me amen and he says I'll
[1:13:33] send the comforter he also says I'll not
[1:13:35] leave you comfortless I will come to you
[1:13:38] so the comforter and himself is is one
[1:13:41] and the same person he says I'll be with
[1:13:43] you even in you to the end of the world
[1:13:45] that's that's his promise and then so
[1:13:47] you see now the same life that was in
[1:13:49] him now on the day of Pentecost came
[1:13:50] into his church and so when you saw saw
[1:13:53] the apostles you saw Jesus am amen when
[1:13:57] you saw it doesn't matter if it was the
[1:13:58] oldest to the youngest man woman amen if
[1:14:01] they filled with the Holy Ghost God
[1:14:03] dwelling in them you saw Jesus you saw
[1:14:05] an expression of the word in that
[1:14:07] person's life and so and then and then
[1:14:11] you can um you know you can see that
[1:14:12] because after the Sanhedrin T to you
[1:14:15] know bolt them down and stop them
[1:14:17] preaching they took M you know they knew
[1:14:20] because he they had been with Jesus
[1:14:22] that's why they could hear you they
[1:14:23] healed the man at G beautiful but they
[1:14:25] recognized these people have been with
[1:14:27] Jesus and they see the same life so we
[1:14:29] see these things and we'd have his
[1:14:32] character as a mature individual you
[1:14:35] know a mature individual each and every
[1:14:37] one of us grow up into his character see
[1:14:39] everything he did how he responded to
[1:14:41] things we would respond the same way
[1:14:45] amen so you see these things I I you
[1:14:49] know and we can be quite daunted by
[1:14:52] these
[1:14:54] he's looking for a bride without spot or
[1:14:55] wrinkle a perfect
[1:14:57] woman that that manifests himself you
[1:15:01] know it is she is the feminine part of
[1:15:04] him we see these things it's daunting
[1:15:08] and we feel quite quite often failures
[1:15:12] now I'm not condoning if there's a part
[1:15:14] of your character that you can't
[1:15:16] overcome you need to you know you need
[1:15:19] to you need to deal with
[1:15:21] it amen but now this whole sermon is
[1:15:24] well then how do you deal with it
[1:15:26] because many times we come and we try
[1:15:28] and present ourselves before the Lord to
[1:15:32] make peace with
[1:15:33] him amen because we think many times we
[1:15:36] can bring something to the
[1:15:39] table Hello friends that's right amen
[1:15:41] you justify well I'm this good and I
[1:15:43] Know This Much scripture I've been
[1:15:45] baptized I've done this I believe the
[1:15:47] truth look I even dress right now I
[1:15:49] dress modestly you know I and then you
[1:15:51] try and bring that to the table
[1:15:53] this is not necessarily a Salvation
[1:15:55] service this an everyday
[1:15:56] Affair amen this is for everyone and so
[1:16:00] many times we think well you know we can
[1:16:02] we can bring something to bring peace
[1:16:04] with
[1:16:05] God but if you if you bring yourself if
[1:16:08] you bring
[1:16:10] yourself he doesn't accept
[1:16:13] you amen I might go deliberately slow
[1:16:16] but I trust you just don't fall asleep
[1:16:18] on me okay he doesn't he doesn't accept
[1:16:22] you if you bring the the sacrifice you
[1:16:26] bring can't have any part of you in
[1:16:29] it amen if you presenting yourself he
[1:16:32] just says I don't want your Humanity
[1:16:34] you're Fallen to begin with I don't I
[1:16:37] don't I don't want any part of you I
[1:16:39] only want one thing amen and God Abraham
[1:16:43] told Isaac when when when Isaac you know
[1:16:46] God told Isaac take your son to a place
[1:16:49] I'll show you and offer him as a burnt
[1:16:51] offering you know there came a point in
[1:16:53] the journey where Isaac and and Abraham
[1:16:56] are are going up by themselves and Isaac
[1:16:59] begins to think we have the wood we got
[1:17:02] the torch to light the sacrifice you
[1:17:05] know but where's the burnt offering
[1:17:08] where's the offering he asked his he
[1:17:10] asked his dad he didn't twig hey you
[1:17:13] know you took a while from him ask the
[1:17:14] question because normally you you know
[1:17:16] you have certain it's like you go
[1:17:17] camping and then you walk along and say
[1:17:19] Hey Dad where's the
[1:17:20] tent amen you you eventually one of your
[1:17:24] sons will look up and say to you daddy
[1:17:25] we're missing something here amen but
[1:17:29] Abraham said God himself will provide
[1:17:30] himself a sacrifice amen and so
[1:17:33] now he so God himself will provide the
[1:17:37] sacrifice and we can see we can see in
[1:17:40] in Leviticus here that the that the uh
[1:17:44] person had to give a burnt offering of
[1:17:47] his own voluntary will so no one can
[1:17:50] give you no one can offer the the the
[1:17:53] sacrifice for you you have to give it in
[1:17:55] your own voluntary will amen no one can
[1:17:58] force you no one can make you do it but
[1:18:01] they you you have to do it
[1:18:04] yourself and this and this sacrifice
[1:18:07] let's go to Leviticus 22 I'm just going
[1:18:11] to I just want to show you few things
[1:18:15] now here in Leviticus 22: 17-
[1:18:18] 24 God demands
[1:18:21] perfection amen God demands Perfection
[1:18:25] he doesn't want a half pie job he
[1:18:29] demands
[1:18:31] Perfection now I'm just trying to you
[1:18:33] think well how can I ever give
[1:18:35] Perfection you not mean to give
[1:18:38] Perfection you're not meant to give any
[1:18:39] part of yourself as a
[1:18:41] sacrifice amen what says present your
[1:18:44] body as a Living Sacrifice yeah you
[1:18:46] yield yourself but that's not the
[1:18:48] initial
[1:18:49] sacrifice amen you following me the
[1:18:52] Leviticus 22: 17-
[1:18:55] 24 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[1:18:58] Speak unto Aaron and to his sons and
[1:19:00] unto all the children of Israel and say
[1:19:02] unto them whatsoever he be of the House
[1:19:04] of Israel or or of the strangers in
[1:19:07] Israel that will offer his oblation for
[1:19:10] all his vows and for all his Free Will
[1:19:12] offerings which he will offer unto the
[1:19:14] Lord for a burnt offering ye shall offer
[1:19:17] at your own will a male without blemish
[1:19:20] of the beaves of the sheep or of the
[1:19:21] goats but whatsoever hath a blemish that
[1:19:25] you shall not offer for it shall not be
[1:19:27] acceptable for you and whosoever
[1:19:29] offereth a sacrifice of Peace offerings
[1:19:31] unto the Lord to accomplish his vow or
[1:19:33] free will offering in the beaves or
[1:19:35] sheep it shall be perfect to be it shall
[1:19:38] be perfect to be accepted there shall be
[1:19:40] no blemish therein blind or broken or
[1:19:43] maimed or having a wi or scurvy or
[1:19:45] scabbed you shall not offer these unto
[1:19:47] the Lord nor make an offering by fire of
[1:19:50] them upon the altar unto the Lord either
[1:19:53] a bulock or a lamb that hath any uh
[1:19:57] anything uh uh Superfluous or lacking in
[1:20:00] his parts that mayest thou offer for a
[1:20:02] free will offering but for a vow it
[1:20:05] shall not be accepted ye shall not offer
[1:20:08] unto the Lord that which is bruised or
[1:20:10] crushed or broken or cut neither shall
[1:20:13] you make any offering thereof in your
[1:20:16] land neither from a stranger's hand
[1:20:19] shall you offer the bread uh of your god
[1:20:22] of any of these because their corruption
[1:20:24] is in them and blemishes be in them they
[1:20:27] shall not be accepted for you see he
[1:20:30] saying he's saying that the sacrifice
[1:20:32] has to be
[1:20:33] perfect amen the sacrifice has to be
[1:20:36] perfect you say well I'm a mature
[1:20:38] Christian if you offer
[1:20:41] yourself you know we justify ourselves
[1:20:43] so much and someone who justifies
[1:20:46] himself to me is just
[1:20:48] blind amen I'll just I'll use that word
[1:20:51] if you justify yourself in any way
[1:20:53] forget
[1:20:54] it amen because if you justify yourself
[1:20:57] well I know this and I see this and I
[1:20:59] have this Revelation there therefore I
[1:21:01] can say what I want to anyone no you
[1:21:03] can't amen you got to treat everyone
[1:21:07] with the same level of respect treat and
[1:21:09] treat an elder as an elder indeed Paul
[1:21:11] tells Timothy I'm not talking about just
[1:21:14] maturity in the word as an older
[1:21:17] man amen you got to treat everyone hey
[1:21:19] people are reading you what message are
[1:21:22] you inter what what message you are you
[1:21:24] the interpretation of are the are you
[1:21:27] the interpretation of what you think are
[1:21:28] the interpretation of this amen amen are
[1:21:31] you you know we sing the song the
[1:21:33] original Life The Original Seed the
[1:21:34] original word this is what I believe the
[1:21:37] son of man is revealed the seven seal is
[1:21:39] unveiled amen he said you know we are
[1:21:42] the word made flesh today this is what
[1:21:43] the scriptures say multitudes of people
[1:21:46] can say those things but only one one
[1:21:49] group of people can actually not just
[1:21:52] say it but they their life says it amen
[1:21:54] amen amen we are the word made flesh
[1:21:57] today that's easy to say but is it a
[1:22:00] life is it a reality and it all depends
[1:22:04] what you're
[1:22:05] offering amen because if you try and
[1:22:08] bring why why is there so
[1:22:12] much why are people there's always going
[1:22:15] to be a whole bunch of make Believers
[1:22:17] unbelievers you know you see in the time
[1:22:19] of Paul people were preaching the
[1:22:21] resurrections pastor already stuff got
[1:22:23] onto the galatian church which Paul
[1:22:25] actually says that it it makes the grace
[1:22:27] of God no effect to you amen here was
[1:22:31] people that Calvary actually became no
[1:22:32] effect to
[1:22:34] them amen the power of the blood became
[1:22:37] no effect to them because they had been
[1:22:39] they had been
[1:22:40] derailed by someone who was trying to
[1:22:43] bring in something that was more than
[1:22:44] the offering that God
[1:22:46] wanted amen oh but we're Believers we
[1:22:48] have the message they had the message
[1:22:51] they had the message in their day how
[1:22:53] why would you not think those same
[1:22:54] things are try and creep in among
[1:22:56] Believers today and you look around the
[1:22:58] world and you see it has oh but we're
[1:23:01] better if you compare yourself with them
[1:23:03] if we compare ourselves as I've said in
[1:23:05] the Scripture it says if we compare
[1:23:06] ourselves with ourselves we become
[1:23:09] unwise amen what mirror are you looking
[1:23:13] in he are you just looking in a natural
[1:23:16] mirror look how look how great I
[1:23:19] am amen or you're looking in this kind
[1:23:22] of
[1:23:23] mirror now we read there that the
[1:23:26] scripture says that the that the
[1:23:27] offering has to be
[1:23:29] perfect and Jesus we understand is our
[1:23:32] is our lamb amen he is our perfect
[1:23:35] offering he went there into Pilot's
[1:23:37] judgment Hall and the scribes and
[1:23:39] Pharisees accused him of all kinds of
[1:23:41] things in the Sanhedrin then he was
[1:23:42] taken to Pilot's judgment Hall and he is
[1:23:44] examined by him and he says I find no
[1:23:47] fault in this man because there was no
[1:23:49] fault in him he was examined amen he was
[1:23:52] tried and tested in every way he was
[1:23:54] tempted on All Points yet without sin
[1:23:57] amen Paul tells us so he was by woman he
[1:23:59] was tempted by money he was tempted by
[1:24:01] popularity he is tempted by going the
[1:24:03] easy way he was tempted by conforming to
[1:24:06] the world Amen he is Tempted By by peer
[1:24:09] pressure remember all points so just
[1:24:11] whatever whatever's in there he was
[1:24:14] tempted by it yet he did not fall for
[1:24:16] the Temptation he was without sin he was
[1:24:19] examined his whole life was examined
[1:24:22] amen and then you see it's
[1:24:25] amazing when he receives the Holy Ghost
[1:24:27] there on the River Jordan where does the
[1:24:29] where does the spirit of God lead him he
[1:24:33] doesn't lead him into just having a big
[1:24:34] open campaign everything's fine he takes
[1:24:36] him into the Wilderness straight away
[1:24:39] amen and then he's tempted then then the
[1:24:41] life in him what he is is is is is
[1:24:43] tested by the
[1:24:45] devil
[1:24:46] amen now he couldn't fall because if he
[1:24:50] fell there'd be no one who who could
[1:24:52] redeem the Earth he was the only one who
[1:24:54] could do it amen but if we fall there's
[1:24:57] blood for us amen there's a sacrifice
[1:25:00] for us if we confess our sins he's
[1:25:03] faithful and just to forgive us the
[1:25:05] scripture tells us even if we fall
[1:25:07] there's blood Hallelujah but but that's
[1:25:11] where that's where God led him into the
[1:25:14] Wilderness to be tried and tested and
[1:25:16] then you see many times the light goes
[1:25:18] on on someone's life what happens things
[1:25:20] go real Ro Rocky and bumpy for a while
[1:25:23] what's happening God LED them down that
[1:25:25] way you got to understand God lead you
[1:25:28] down those ways cuz he's testing he's
[1:25:30] actually proving to the devil the life
[1:25:32] that's in you Amen to show to show him
[1:25:36] this is this is more than someone else
[1:25:37] that you've made fall and just go to the
[1:25:39] ditch of life this is one of my children
[1:25:42] Hallelujah and they might go through the
[1:25:43] ditch a while but I won't leave them in
[1:25:45] that ditch Hallelujah I'm going to bring
[1:25:47] them out again amen hallelujah so God
[1:25:52] God God is not afraid to have you tested
[1:25:55] but you see he was tested at all points
[1:25:57] he was found without sin so then
[1:26:01] now then we have to we have to really
[1:26:05] think about now what are we
[1:26:07] offering because there's a but we have a
[1:26:10] man as has and built in them self-
[1:26:13] condemnation we're not worthy we're not
[1:26:16] you know people people sometimes get an
[1:26:19] idea I just think about this uh
[1:26:22] over the last few weeks people get this
[1:26:24] idea that people have to get on some
[1:26:26] great spiritual plane and then Angels
[1:26:29] descend and visitations happen then
[1:26:31] Visions happen that they get on some
[1:26:33] some some Plateau up here and then God
[1:26:36] speaks to
[1:26:37] them I've seen it
[1:26:41] amen this is not this is yeah people get
[1:26:44] that idea they have to get on some
[1:26:46] spiritual plan and now they're walking
[1:26:48] with God Jesus came to minister he says
[1:26:50] blessed thou blessed are the poor in
[1:26:53] spirit amen blessed are the you blessed
[1:26:56] are the meek Hallelujah blessed are
[1:26:59] those ones Jesus comes to minister to
[1:27:01] those kind of people amen so Jesus gives
[1:27:04] visitations to those kind of people
[1:27:06] hallelujah poor in spirit amen those who
[1:27:09] are downtrod those who feel weak a
[1:27:11] Shepherd you know he says he says a
[1:27:14] Shepherd is like he has 100 sheep and
[1:27:16] one goes Wayward amen and then he goes
[1:27:20] and then he gets that he leaves the 99
[1:27:22] get the one now who's been on a sheep
[1:27:25] farm
[1:27:26] before who's who's who's seen how sheep
[1:27:29] operate sometimes they're just walking
[1:27:31] along they go Wayward I mean they get
[1:27:33] stuck in bushes they get you think how
[1:27:36] did you get into that place but they in
[1:27:38] they find themselves in those kind of
[1:27:40] places and sometimes we look at each
[1:27:42] other and we think how did they get into
[1:27:44] that
[1:27:45] place amen but there's still a sheep
[1:27:48] Hallelujah if someone's a Sheep amen the
[1:27:51] shepherd will come and grab grab them
[1:27:53] and that should be that should be that
[1:27:55] to me I'm just echoing the words of John
[1:27:58] Andes you should go listen to it but he
[1:27:59] says that is the bride's
[1:28:01] Ministry amen where where our heart
[1:28:04] should be there's a sheep in a Thicket
[1:28:06] we must go get that
[1:28:07] one amen because we go Wayward it says
[1:28:10] in the scripture they've all gone
[1:28:13] astray but I don't believe right never
[1:28:15] go astray are you
[1:28:17] sure look at me I can do it look daddy I
[1:28:20] can run now

[1:28:27] themselves they start to pull themselves
[1:28:30] up walk along furniture they hurt
[1:28:31] themselves even more they begin to walk
[1:28:34] they hurt themselves even more they run
[1:28:36] oh man they hurt themselves even more
[1:28:38] than that am but they think they can do
[1:28:41] it amen but they they end up with
[1:28:44] bruises and all kinds of pains and all
[1:28:46] these things because they think now I
[1:28:48] can do
[1:28:49] it amen if you think you can do
[1:28:54] it enjoy a lot of unpleasant
[1:28:59] times amen I can do it we're to be our
[1:29:03] perfect strength is in perfect what
[1:29:06] weakness but I'm a mature son or
[1:29:08] daughter of
[1:29:12] God I seen The Prophet's life the more
[1:29:15] he walked with God the more he depended
[1:29:17] upon God
[1:29:18] am amen so the more mature he became
[1:29:22] came the more dependent he became on the
[1:29:25] Lord himself and we think we're a
[1:29:27] walking quotebook and We Know It
[1:29:29] All amen but as long as you're a
[1:29:34] Sheep amen hey I've gone
[1:29:37] waywood you can get all grumpy and fussy
[1:29:39] and all these you know
[1:29:43] then amen amen oh is that waywood yeah
[1:29:47] it can be absolutely where does that
[1:29:49] take you where's that path going to take
[1:29:52] take you is it walking with the shepherd
[1:29:54] are you going off this way it'll take
[1:29:55] you that way that's right amen but I
[1:29:59] have rights you don't have rights I have
[1:30:02] an opinion no you don't I don't have an
[1:30:04] opinion I do not care I think I said it
[1:30:06] last time I was here I don't care about
[1:30:08] my opinion my opinion means
[1:30:11] nothing amen who cares about what I
[1:30:13] think what god what have you said what
[1:30:16] have you declared in your word yes sir
[1:30:19] you know brother brah he says he says
[1:30:21] it's like he says like the pool of
[1:30:23] Bethesda it was just water nothing
[1:30:25] special but when the angel of the Lord
[1:30:26] stepped down into it that's when healing
[1:30:29] could come that's when things could come
[1:30:31] and he says I'm just like you know you
[1:30:34] know we're just like that I'm your
[1:30:35] brother but then when he comes down he
[1:30:38] says when he comes down I become the
[1:30:40] voice of God to you he says now I think
[1:30:43] I felt a bit of resentment about I felt
[1:30:45] a bit bad saying that I'm going to say
[1:30:46] it again when he comes down I become the
[1:30:49] voice of God to he says the second time
[1:30:51] I say it un
[1:30:52] inspiration so one time he said it but
[1:30:55] then God said say it again amen because
[1:30:57] that's
[1:30:58] true amen
[1:31:02] amen
[1:31:04] now there's a there's a scripture we see
[1:31:07] in Luke and in Matthew Jesus speaks of
[1:31:09] the of the call to the feast to the
[1:31:12] wedding Feast for his for a son now in
[1:31:16] these in these two scriptures the most
[1:31:18] the most uh the most likely guest never
[1:31:23] come amen they they turn it down flat
[1:31:26] the the people you would think would be
[1:31:28] there they reject it like the scribes
[1:31:30] and Pharisees you think they would have
[1:31:32] just broken down their denominational
[1:31:34] ideas they would have walked they would
[1:31:36] have just walked with the Messiah and
[1:31:37] they would have had a glorious time the
[1:31:39] most likely one said crucify him amen
[1:31:42] the most likely
[1:31:44] rejected and then now it just comes down
[1:31:47] and then the and then the king says to
[1:31:48] the servants go get the lame get the
[1:31:51] halt get the blind get the good it says

[1:35:51] hallelujah oh I'm not worthy it doesn't
[1:35:53] matter the the when the when the when
[1:35:56] the priest when the man brought the
[1:35:58] offering to the priest who was
[1:36:01] examined who was examined it wasn't him
[1:36:05] amen I know I've probably said these
[1:36:06] things before but I just trust it sinks
[1:36:08] in amen he didn't the priest as soon as
[1:36:11] he saw the offering he didn't look at
[1:36:13] the guy anymore he he totally forget him
[1:36:16] and he just looked at the lamb says now
[1:36:18] I've got to inspect this thing am mean
[1:36:20] you just go to one side this has got to
[1:36:22] be perfect he's a sincere priest he's
[1:36:24] going to examine it pretty good you know
[1:36:26] they're looking for a red heer sacrifice
[1:36:29] I'm sure you've heard about it they need
[1:36:31] there's a there's a purification for the
[1:36:34] priest they need a red heer without
[1:36:35] blemish then they kill it they burn it
[1:36:37] they mix the ashes with water and they
[1:36:40] sprinkle it on the priesthood it's a
[1:36:42] purification for sin the scripture says
[1:36:44] now that that in reality that in reality
[1:36:47] is Christ the word the people need the
[1:36:50] word to be washed we're Washed by the
[1:36:51] Water of the word you can't be washed by
[1:36:53] denominational word it's got to be a
[1:36:56] pure word and we've received a pure word
[1:36:58] in this day to wash the people
[1:37:00] hallelujah amen but that but that red hi
[1:37:02] has got to be perfect and they examine
[1:37:04] them and they think I think this is one
[1:37:06] then then there's a little white hair
[1:37:07] and they can't pluck out the white hair
[1:37:09] and say oh it's fine anden they actually
[1:37:12] say no this one one cannot be
[1:37:15] accepted amen they they go over a fine
[1:37:18] tooth comb now just because they do that
[1:37:21] in this day they would have done that in
[1:37:22] that day as well amen because the priest
[1:37:27] you know it wasn't games it wasn't games
[1:37:30] to be a priest they would remember when
[1:37:32] when Eli and his sons polluted the
[1:37:34] priesthood and what happened to them
[1:37:37] amen and they would think well oh well
[1:37:39] this is a modern age we've moved on no
[1:37:41] God is still the same am so they would
[1:37:43] have thought I do not want that to fall
[1:37:45] upon
[1:37:47] me amen so they would have examined the
[1:37:50] animal and when the animal was examined
[1:37:53] and was found to be perfect then the
[1:37:55] worshipper could come back now Put Your
[1:37:57] Head Upon the Put Your Head Upon the put
[1:38:00] your hand upon the head of the animal
[1:38:02] Hallelujah then I'm going to kill the
[1:38:03] animal amen that that you're going to be
[1:38:05] associated with the with the death of
[1:38:07] this animal Hallelujah and so he was he
[1:38:11] was you know it was the animal that was
[1:38:13] examined and then the animal was given
[1:38:16] on behalf of the
[1:38:17] worshipper amen and so if the worshipper
[1:38:20] knew
[1:38:21] this lamb is perfect or whatever it was
[1:38:24] if they if they knew that that lamb was
[1:38:27] perfect they could have confidence they
[1:38:29] could just come and offer it Hallelujah
[1:38:31] they didn't have to worry about
[1:38:33] themselves amen they just they just
[1:38:35] looked at the lamb they had confidence
[1:38:38] in their lamb Hallelujah they weren't
[1:38:40] worried about what they did they knew
[1:38:43] the priest has to accept this
[1:38:46] offering Hallelujah and it's the same
[1:38:49] thing friends you times that by a
[1:38:50] billion TR Infinities when when when our
[1:38:53] lamb stood upon the Earth he says for
[1:38:54] this cause I've come into the world he
[1:38:57] knew he was the Lamb of God that takes
[1:38:58] away the sin of the world he's a perfect
[1:39:00] man he lived in a realm to himself I
[1:39:02] mean not a man spake like that or acted
[1:39:04] like that or did those kind of things he
[1:39:06] is a perfect man amen
[1:39:09] hallelujah and it's amazing because
[1:39:11] pilate brings him out he says behold the
[1:39:14] man and if only if only his eyes are
[1:39:17] open he'd say Behold the Lamb that must
[1:39:19] be offered for you
[1:39:22] amen and then so he was accepted and the
[1:39:24] reason he was accepted is because when
[1:39:27] he ascended the Holy Ghost came back
[1:39:29] down amen because it was just man's
[1:39:32] blood the spirit of God would never come
[1:39:34] and dwelt in the people because by one
[1:39:37] offering he has forever San he has
[1:39:39] perfected them forever which are
[1:39:41] Sanctified by one
[1:39:43] offering amen so now he has he has done
[1:39:47] that that God can come and dwell in you
[1:39:50] because we all have a Fallen sin nature
[1:39:52] whether we like it or not that we're
[1:39:53] born with and that sin n nature must die
[1:39:58] amen this is not a this is not a rehab
[1:40:00] house not a halfway house this is not a
[1:40:03] Reformation that's right oh I'm just
[1:40:05] doing a little bit better this week
[1:40:07] praise the Lord but don't depend upon
[1:40:09] that it's got a life has got to come in
[1:40:12] and then then the victories will come
[1:40:14] amen let's go to Ezekiel
[1:40:18] 36 amen
[1:40:22] I can even find it oh yeah Ezekiel
[1:40:25] Lamentations Ezekiel
[1:40:36] Daniel
[1:40:38] wait
[1:40:40] yes so we're reading from verse
[1:40:45] 25 he says then will I sprinkle clean
[1:40:47] water upon you and you shall be clean
[1:40:49] from all your filthiness
[1:40:51] and from all your Idols will I cleanse
[1:40:53] you a new heart also will I give you a
[1:40:55] new spirit will I put within you and
[1:40:57] I'll take away the Stony heart out of
[1:40:59] your flesh and I'll give you a heart of
[1:41:00] Flesh and I'll put my spirit within you
[1:41:03] and cause you to walk in my statutes and
[1:41:06] to keep my judgments and do them so it's
[1:41:08] only when it's only when the spirit of
[1:41:10] God comes in then you can keep his word
[1:41:13] he says I will CA you I'm going to read
[1:41:15] that again and I'll put my spirit within
[1:41:17] you and cause you to walk in my statutes
[1:41:20] and you shall keep my judgments and do
[1:41:23] them how do they keep them because the
[1:41:24] spirit of God is in the person amen
[1:41:27] that's how you keep the word none of us
[1:41:29] can keep the word in our own strength
[1:41:31] amen but if you if you say well I've
[1:41:33] been a good Christian all my life and I
[1:41:34] can do all these things God doesn't
[1:41:36] accept
[1:41:36] you you have to offer a
[1:41:39] lamb amen you've got to be identified
[1:41:42] with the lamb amen you have to you have
[1:41:46] to offer what are you offering to God I
[1:41:48] trust by now you say not me I'm not
[1:41:50] giving anything I could do you have to
[1:41:53] you have to depend upon what he has done
[1:41:56] for you and then now you say well I've
[1:41:59] accepted him it's one thing for him to
[1:42:01] you to accept him he's got to accept you
[1:42:04] amen you go back to Cain and Abel Abel
[1:42:07] was his sacrifice was accepted so
[1:42:10] therefore Abel was
[1:42:12] accepted amen any people they give
[1:42:15] offerings in this day but they never
[1:42:17] look to think have I been accepted has
[1:42:19] my offering been accepted amen this is
[1:42:21] not a play on words he has to accept you
[1:42:24] touch you not the unclean thing and I
[1:42:26] will receive you sayith the Lord amen
[1:42:30] you know true sanctification is not just
[1:42:32] dressing right it's got to be
[1:42:34] sanctification in here amen and then
[1:42:36] it's lived out if it's in here that's
[1:42:38] true
[1:42:39] sanctification changing how you dress
[1:42:41] because it's what you hear is just a
[1:42:43] Reformation which is good obedience is
[1:42:46] better than sacrifice but you got to be
[1:42:47] Sanctified out of here your Nature's got
[1:42:49] to change
[1:42:51] amen and the reason I can say that is
[1:42:53] because God has provided a lamb that the
[1:42:56] nature of the sacrifice can come into
[1:42:58] you amen the nature you see a lamb
[1:43:01] innocent you know gentle loving animal
[1:43:04] but because it was animal life it wasn't
[1:43:08] it didn't you know animals don't have a
[1:43:10] soul then the nature of the Lamb could
[1:43:12] never come back upon the worshipper and
[1:43:15] change that
[1:43:16] worshipper that they would stop doing
[1:43:18] what caused them to bring the offering
[1:43:20] in the first place place you following
[1:43:22] me if someone came they did something
[1:43:25] whatever it was and they brought the
[1:43:27] lamb they they left with those same
[1:43:29] desires but they were justified by
[1:43:32] giving the offering amen but they left
[1:43:35] the very same person that's not what
[1:43:37] Christianity is about that was under the
[1:43:40] blood of bulls and goats under the blood
[1:43:42] of Jesus Christ the very life that was
[1:43:44] in our Lamb of God comes into you amen
[1:43:47] how do you know I'm accepted because his
[1:43:49] life remember they put their hands upon
[1:43:51] the head of the sacrifice to to connect
[1:43:54] themselves with their sacrifice how we
[1:43:56] connected because the life that was
[1:43:58] released on Calvary comes into you amen
[1:44:02] and that's how you know you're
[1:44:04] accepted amen are you got to believe by
[1:44:06] faith absolutely but we can read in the
[1:44:09] book of Acts let's go to Acts chapter 8
[1:44:12] you say I believed it by faith you have
[1:44:14] to believe it by faith but there has to
[1:44:16] come a time where God recognizes your
[1:44:19] faith amen
[1:44:24] amen Acts chapter
[1:44:27] 8 we'll go
[1:44:31] to we'll go to
[1:44:33] verse let's start from verse
[1:44:36] n we'll go to verse
[1:44:39] 16 but there was a certain man called
[1:44:41] Simon which Before Time in the same city
[1:44:43] used sorcery and bewitched the people of
[1:44:45] Samaria giving out that himself was some
[1:44:48] great one to to whom they all gave heed
[1:44:52] from the least to the greatest saying
[1:44:54] this man is the uh is the great power of
[1:44:56] God and to him they had regard because
[1:44:59] that of a long time he had Bewitched
[1:45:01] them with sorceries but when they believ
[1:45:03] Philip preaching the things concerning
[1:45:05] the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus
[1:45:07] Christ they are baptized both men and
[1:45:09] women then Simon himself believed also
[1:45:12] and when he was baptized he continued
[1:45:14] with Philip and wondered beholding the
[1:45:16] Miracles and signs which were done now
[1:45:19] when the apostles which were Jerusalem
[1:45:21] heard that Samaria had received the word
[1:45:23] of God they sent unto them Peter and
[1:45:27] John who when they would come down
[1:45:30] prayed for them that they might receive
[1:45:32] the Holy Ghost for as yet he was Fallen
[1:45:35] upon none of them only they were
[1:45:37] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:45:40] so they received the word of
[1:45:42] God Amen but the very nature of the Lamb
[1:45:45] hadn't come into them
[1:45:47] yet amen and then Paul asked Apollos
[1:45:50] into acts 18 have you receed and and
[1:45:52] start of Acts 19 have you received the
[1:45:54] Holy Ghost since you have believed that
[1:45:56] word in the Greek doesn't mean when
[1:45:58] since you have believed has he come and
[1:46:01] recognized your faith by giving you the
[1:46:03] Holy
[1:46:04] Ghost amen has he changed your nature
[1:46:08] hey some place in the book of Acts they
[1:46:09] spoke with tongues others they didn't it
[1:46:11] doesn't matter what happens to you it's
[1:46:13] the life that is afterwards that matters
[1:46:16] but something's got to happen you've got
[1:46:18] to have an experience but your life
[1:46:20] afterwards has to reflect a new life has
[1:46:23] come into
[1:46:24] me
[1:46:26] amen and that's how you know you've been
[1:46:29] identified with the sacrifice you say
[1:46:31] well how do well you say and then also
[1:46:34] will you say well Jesus died 2000 years
[1:46:36] ago I can't go back to G you know you
[1:46:38] know Golgotha and lay my hands upon his
[1:46:41] head that's true you got to receive it
[1:46:43] by faith amen amen and when you receive
[1:46:46] the word if you receive the truth of the
[1:46:48] word that links you back into what he
[1:46:52] did amen you say well how do you know
[1:46:54] this message is true this is how I know
[1:46:56] it's true Jesus is the high priest of
[1:46:59] our
[1:47:00] profession many and you hear in a
[1:47:03] multitude of sermons brother Braham
[1:47:05] standing there at the pulpit calls out
[1:47:06] someone in the audience this is your
[1:47:07] name this is where you're from this is
[1:47:09] this is you know what you've come to be
[1:47:11] prayer for you know and then has a
[1:47:14] question who did he touch who did she
[1:47:16] touch they're 30 ft from me that you
[1:47:18] they didn't touch me he says they
[1:47:20] touched the high priest amen now why is
[1:47:23] that significant because if he's the
[1:47:26] high priest that can be touched and that
[1:47:28] happened he's saying what brother Braham
[1:47:30] saying is the high priest was there in
[1:47:32] the room amen that's why he could take a
[1:47:34] human vessel and reveal what's going on
[1:47:36] in someone's life he he's actually
[1:47:39] saying the high priest Jesus himself is
[1:47:41] in the room you touch the high priest
[1:47:45] Hallelujah and it's the high priest that
[1:47:47] went into the holy of holies once a year
[1:47:49] with the blood
[1:47:50] and if the high priest if that sacrifice
[1:47:52] was accepted and the high priest came
[1:47:55] out alive the people could Rejoice
[1:47:56] knowing that their sins are forgiven and
[1:47:59] then Jesus when he came out of the Tomb
[1:48:01] Tri you know triumphantly he arose up
[1:48:04] into heaven because he says remember he
[1:48:06] sister to was it Mary and Martha don't
[1:48:08] touch me yet I haven't ascended to my
[1:48:10] father so he had had to ascend and then
[1:48:12] offer the sacrifice here it is here it
[1:48:15] is Father I'll just dramatize a little
[1:48:17] bit I mean here's the blood he goes into
[1:48:19] the very presence of God it says in
[1:48:22] Hebrews by a New and Living Way amen
[1:48:25] through the veil saying his flesh Peter
[1:48:27] speaks so so he rent The Veil he stepped
[1:48:30] in the very presence of God and then he
[1:48:33] came back down and he says now touch me
[1:48:35] handle me feel me so so the high priest
[1:48:39] went up the offering was accepted he
[1:48:42] came back down he says now touch me
[1:48:46] amen and so that same that same high
[1:48:49] priest is present in this day and that's
[1:48:52] why brother R said who did he touch who
[1:48:54] did she touch she touched the high
[1:48:56] priest
[1:48:58] amen and if so if you have the high
[1:49:00] priest you have the
[1:49:01] blood amen if you don't have the high
[1:49:04] priest there's no way the blood can go
[1:49:06] onto the mercy said you be forgiven
[1:49:08] going in the Old Testament type so
[1:49:11] multitudes have what they claim to be
[1:49:13] the
[1:49:14] blood amen multitudes claim they have
[1:49:17] the high priest but who has the high
[1:49:19] priest and the high priest has declared
[1:49:21] himself saying this is me this is me
[1:49:23] here I am amen I've come to reveal
[1:49:25] myself in this end time that you may
[1:49:27] know your sins have been forgiven
[1:49:29] hallelujah amen well what does that got
[1:49:31] to do with me if you believe the words
[1:49:33] that that man spoke amen that was the
[1:49:36] high priest speaking he says now
[1:49:37] whatever he said you just go
[1:49:40] do amen that is not pie in the sky I
[1:49:44] have to say it amen so if you believe
[1:49:48] what he said oh that's that's a Kian
[1:49:50] opinion from the 1960s no it's not
[1:49:53] that's Elijah and Elijah came to turn
[1:49:56] our hearts back to the original Faith so
[1:49:59] whatever he said you know the truth as
[1:50:01] I've said the truth is not a bunch of
[1:50:03] ideas that changes by culture or we're
[1:50:06] in 2016 things have changed things have
[1:50:09] changed but God is still the same amen
[1:50:13] the world is just run that way as fast
[1:50:15] as it can but the truth is right
[1:50:17] here amen well this is you say well I
[1:50:22] can't identify myself with such thinking
[1:50:24] that's why you got to cast down your
[1:50:26] thinking because whether we like it or
[1:50:28] not wherever we're born affects the way
[1:50:30] we think and our family makeup and our
[1:50:33] you know our schooling the you the whole
[1:50:36] idea of how we think is actually been
[1:50:38] constructed by the
[1:50:40] society oh no there you know you I'm a
[1:50:43] free thinker are
[1:50:45] you whether you like it or not if you
[1:50:47] were born here just have you're an
[1:50:49] identical twist
[1:50:51] and one of you was raised here the other
[1:50:52] one was raised in the back of India
[1:50:55] someplace how they think over there
[1:50:57] they're both going to think differently
[1:50:59] yes amen because the society they're in
[1:51:02] is changing how they think
[1:51:05] amen God has to undo a whole bunch of
[1:51:08] that stuff that's right I mean God has
[1:51:10] to well I've been raised this way in a
[1:51:12] church you know I was
[1:51:15] thinking I know this is on the
[1:51:18] internet you know
[1:51:20] I'd love it if we had our own church
[1:51:22] building if some church just gave us a
[1:51:23] building and that be oh or if we could
[1:51:26] even rent some church halfway for a
[1:51:28] midweek meeting now this is I might be
[1:51:31] totally this is just me and fellowship
[1:51:33] but I was thinking but then I saw
[1:51:35] imagine if we were in the first church
[1:51:38] age uh you know in the book of Acts and
[1:51:41] they went to the Temple of Diana and
[1:51:44] said can we use your temple to have a
[1:51:45] meeting
[1:51:46] in do you think they would do that can
[1:51:49] we go into the temp temple of mars or
[1:51:51] Jupiter or some Heathen place can we
[1:51:53] have church in here amen they would
[1:51:55] never even think we're going to have
[1:51:56] church in that kind of place now you may
[1:51:59] think that's too far out there but what
[1:52:01] are they
[1:52:02] worshiping in ignorance sincere I'm not
[1:52:06] taking that from but what are they
[1:52:07] worshiping
[1:52:09] amen just I just thought about it amen
[1:52:13] but you know I'm not sure where I'm
[1:52:15] going with that but you know sometimes
[1:52:16] we have to oh no I was thinking oh but I
[1:52:18] was raised in church
[1:52:20] amen who says what is taught to you in
[1:52:22] church raising up was
[1:52:25] right amen because of it was right why
[1:52:28] would you need something more amen if it
[1:52:30] gave you overcoming power there then you
[1:52:33] don't need the why would God send a
[1:52:35] message why would God say in this end
[1:52:37] time come out of her my people as it
[1:52:39] said in Revelations 18 where that word
[1:52:42] was made flesh in this end time when
[1:52:44] there's a voice came amen an angel came
[1:52:46] down from heaven and the whole world was
[1:52:48] lighten with his glory and voice said
[1:52:50] come out of her my people yes amen if
[1:52:54] you you could get that there you
[1:52:56] following me so you say well but this is
[1:52:59] how we did it there does that mean it's
[1:53:00] right here amen that's why with wisdom
[1:53:04] we got to take it back to the word and
[1:53:06] say well is this how things should be
[1:53:08] done amen and then we should also look
[1:53:11] and say well
[1:53:14] why you know if things work in other
[1:53:17] places in other message places
[1:53:20] then we should say why is that working
[1:53:23] and then if other things are not working
[1:53:24] we should think why is that not
[1:53:26] working amen we should patent ourselves
[1:53:29] to a degree not to be a copy but you
[1:53:31] know what I mean for example if a church
[1:53:33] is just full of old
[1:53:35] people but they're married they got kids
[1:53:39] but it's just all old people you'll
[1:53:41] think what happened there why has it
[1:53:44] become like
[1:53:45] that doesn't mean they're they're
[1:53:47] they're they're not real Believers but
[1:53:49] but what happened there do we want
[1:53:53] that amen we don't want that so whatever
[1:53:57] theyve been doing we we shouldn't follow
[1:54:00] that amen but if there's a church where
[1:54:02] there's old to Young and and it's
[1:54:04] actually the youth that are that are
[1:54:06] pushing the service forward right amen
[1:54:09] that are really pulling on the word and
[1:54:10] that really want to enter in we say what
[1:54:12] do they have right amen we want to do
[1:54:15] what they do that's right amen that's
[1:54:19] right
[1:54:22] now I'm just basically I'm just sharing
[1:54:24] my heart
[1:54:25] today amen but you got to think what do
[1:54:27] they do because we don't want to make
[1:54:29] the same mistakes that other Generations
[1:54:31] have made sure they had it sure they had
[1:54:34] it harder and some
[1:54:36] respects than what we have something and
[1:54:40] if we think we're better than anyone
[1:54:41] else we're going to fall but we have
[1:54:43] something that's very
[1:54:45] pure amen that's right but then I said
[1:54:48] you know you know I said to them up
[1:54:50] there you step into the Pres of God Amen
[1:54:54] there were people and I was using some
[1:54:56] of you I didn't call you by name but I
[1:54:57] was using some examples some people had
[1:55:00] this problem they don't have that
[1:55:01] problem no more amen the people were
[1:55:03] bound with this they're not bound no
[1:55:04] more people were discouraged they're not
[1:55:06] discouraged no more amen amen because
[1:55:08] they stepped they made contact with the
[1:55:10] supernatural God they made in contact
[1:55:13] with the land amen amen hallelujah and
[1:55:17] that is such an important thing where
[1:55:19] when what are you offering you got to
[1:55:20] offer the lamb whatever you do don't
[1:55:23] bring yourself into it say you know say
[1:55:28] Lord here's and that's why I said the
[1:55:29] high priest you say well we have the
[1:55:31] high priest now why why's that so
[1:55:33] important because we have the blood amen
[1:55:36] and so so here is the very high priest
[1:55:38] with the blood stepping forth saying
[1:55:39] here I am you want forgiveness of sins I
[1:55:42] have the blood and he was speaking
[1:55:44] through that man so if you believe what
[1:55:46] he said you get tied into the high
[1:55:48] priest so you say now now now you can
[1:55:50] actually offer something to the
[1:55:52] Lord amen now we because because we have
[1:55:56] that we have a pure word of
[1:56:00] God by teaching the Commandments and
[1:56:02] doctrines of men you make the word of
[1:56:04] God no effect to the people amen so if
[1:56:07] you just believe if you believe the
[1:56:09] Commandments and doctrines of men you
[1:56:11] make the lamb you can't become with the
[1:56:14] lamb Amen in its fullness why does a
[1:56:17] foolish virgin have to go into the
[1:56:18] tribulation because they reject the full
[1:56:21] atonement amen they you say they're
[1:56:23] partially you say they're
[1:56:25] forgiven because they were they were
[1:56:28] clean living to the to the Lord but they
[1:56:30] didn't have the full effect of the
[1:56:32] atonement in their lives amen amen
[1:56:35] what's that they didn't have the life of
[1:56:36] the lamb in them because they had no
[1:56:39] oil oh that's you know that's that's
[1:56:42] some other group hold on I'm going to
[1:56:45] say this there's scripture there's
[1:56:48] scripture in the Bible where it says
[1:56:49] that everyone is going to stand before
[1:56:51] the Judgment seat of Christ now I know
[1:56:53] I'm going all over the place but I just
[1:56:54] want to I'm just going to share what's
[1:56:56] on my heart today there's a scripture
[1:56:58] where we all stand before the Judgment
[1:57:00] seat of Christ and some will be given
[1:57:03] great rewards amen some you know and all
[1:57:06] of our works will be made manifest so if
[1:57:09] you build hey wood and stubble it'll be
[1:57:11] burned it'll be tried in the fire and
[1:57:12] burned but if you build gold and
[1:57:13] precious ston all these things that will
[1:57:15] stand so what that is that's not the
[1:57:18] great white throwing in judgment
[1:57:20] that is actually a judgment for
[1:57:23] rewards you say will God do that yeah
[1:57:25] doesn't mean you become unb don't get me
[1:57:28] wrong but people get different rewards
[1:57:31] for what they've done in this
[1:57:32] flesh
[1:57:34] amen because that's how God works God is
[1:57:37] like a you know you know he's the best
[1:57:39] boss there is and he and and he gives
[1:57:43] benefits he pays everyone the same wage
[1:57:45] eternal life but then he gives you know
[1:57:49] certain things you say at the end of the
[1:57:50] year you did this you deserve this you
[1:57:52] did this you deserve this amen so our
[1:57:54] our lives are going to actually be put
[1:57:58] on a
[1:57:59] screen and God is actually saying now
[1:58:02] what did you
[1:58:03] build what did you build in this life
[1:58:07] did you build hay wood and stubble and
[1:58:09] it says that they'll be ashamed on on
[1:58:11] that
[1:58:12] day
[1:58:14] amen did you build Haywood and
[1:58:17] stubble or did you build things that can
[1:58:20] be tried in the fire and will stand so
[1:58:22] what did you do oh but I'm saved I have
[1:58:24] the Holy Ghost I'm you can't just sit
[1:58:28] back and say everything's easy and
[1:58:31] good amen I'm not now I'm not talking
[1:58:34] about earning your way into heaven this
[1:58:35] is not what I'm talking about talking
[1:58:36] about rewards on the other side amen
[1:58:39] well I'm going to be there everything's
[1:58:40] fine and dandy if I'm going to be there
[1:58:41] I'm going to be there there's still
[1:58:42] going to be a judgment what did you do
[1:58:44] what did you choose to do in this
[1:58:47] life amen did you give your all for me
[1:58:52] or did you just put your feet up in a in
[1:58:54] a armchair and just watch the world go
[1:58:57] by
[1:59:00] amen what are you going to do if you
[1:59:03] have the nature of the
[1:59:04] Lamb amen that's why it's such a fine
[1:59:07] line if you have but then brother BR
[1:59:10] brought it so well the fine line is well
[1:59:12] there's works and there's there's
[1:59:14] predestin there The Armenian ISM and the
[1:59:16] Calvinism but so one side says I'm going
[1:59:19] to be there I'm going to be there watch
[1:59:20] the world go by God will do it he's
[1:59:22] Sovereign the other group says I've
[1:59:24] really got to work out your salvation
[1:59:26] with fear and trembling amen and then
[1:59:29] basically you know work your way into
[1:59:32] the kingdom you know the Kingdom's you
[1:59:33] know the violent take it by force and
[1:59:36] that's true the kingdom is taken the
[1:59:38] violent take it by force what is that
[1:59:40] knock Lord I need this amen give it unto
[1:59:45] me he says knock and you shall find seek
[1:59:48] ye first the kingdom of God the song We
[1:59:49] sung knock and you shall find seek and
[1:59:52] you you know knock and it shall be open
[1:59:54] to you seek and you shall find amen so
[1:59:58] there's that too now but brother brah
[2:00:01] brings it such a nice middle he says but
[2:00:04] if you love
[2:00:06] him if you love
[2:00:08] him amen and he uses the you know
[2:00:10] illustration with him and his wife he
[2:00:12] says now one side says this just before
[2:00:15] he goes on a on a campaign or goes
[2:00:17] overseas one side says now Mrs brandom
[2:00:20] I'll tell you thou shall not you know go
[2:00:22] out with any other husbands you shall
[2:00:23] not have any other husbands when I'm
[2:00:25] away you shall not do this and she grabs
[2:00:27] him by the TI and says now Mr brandom
[2:00:29] let me tell you you shall not have any
[2:00:31] wives other wives will I'm away soon as
[2:00:33] I find out if you've had one you
[2:00:34] divorced as soon as you at home then the
[2:00:36] other side says well doesn't really
[2:00:39] matter amen but he says but if there's
[2:00:42] love there if there's genuine love he
[2:00:46] says because I love my wife and she
[2:00:49] loves me we wouldn't want to do those
[2:00:51] things but if I did what if I did that I
[2:00:54] believe she would forgive me because we
[2:00:56] love each
[2:00:58] other so our great our great motivation
[2:01:02] should be
[2:01:03] love amen amen are you following
[2:01:08] me why so it's not works to to to gain
[2:01:12] something but it's out of
[2:01:14] love so what do you want to build
[2:01:17] because there's going to be a day and
[2:01:18] there's going to be Believers that it's
[2:01:20] going to be hay wooden stubble and
[2:01:21] they're going to be
[2:01:22] ashamed amen there are people are going
[2:01:25] to FF that
[2:01:26] scripture amen but others are going to
[2:01:29] have go gold tried in the fire and their
[2:01:31] Works going to
[2:01:32] stand what do you want it to
[2:01:35] be amen what do you want it to
[2:01:39] be so you know but if it's out of love
[2:01:43] love should be the
[2:01:45] motivator amen I read in Galatians and I
[2:01:49] probably can't find it says that
[2:01:50] faith faith uh love worketh Faith or
[2:01:55] something no I won't even try and find
[2:01:57] it go read the book of
[2:02:00] Galatians amen but what do you you know
[2:02:04] what are you
[2:02:05] offering I may you know maybe I should
[2:02:07] just wind this up but but what are you
[2:02:10] offering you say well I have I have this
[2:02:13] problem I have this problem what are you
[2:02:15] offering amen I have this need what are
[2:02:18] you offering
[2:02:20] because if we try and offer ourselves
[2:02:21] and try and work out our own selves
[2:02:23] you'll never get what you
[2:02:25] need amen I believe you know you know
[2:02:30] you know I told them there at Camp I
[2:02:31] said I said a guy you an atheist guy you
[2:02:34] know at our camp you he tried to tell me
[2:02:37] God's not real I said it's too
[2:02:39] late you can't tell me he's not real
[2:02:41] I've met him then other people say well
[2:02:43] there's no no such thing as just instant
[2:02:45] Deliverance I'm sorry but I've been
[2:02:47] delivered that way I me there's no such
[2:02:49] thing as just being healed I'm sorry but
[2:02:51] I've had that happen to me amen amen
[2:02:53] there's no such thing as a transforming
[2:02:55] power of God I'm sorry but it's happened
[2:02:57] to me and I said about some of you
[2:03:00] things that you guys have gone through I
[2:03:01] said you can't tell those people God's
[2:03:03] not real amen it's because they came in
[2:03:06] contact with the
[2:03:07] lambah Hallelujah it doesn't matter if
[2:03:10] you've got bitterness or sadness or
[2:03:12] whatever you're carrying amen you have
[2:03:14] an offering say Lord I Want to Be Free
[2:03:16] of this thing am Hallelujah you have
[2:03:19] what you need you just got to give the
[2:03:20] lamb well I need to work everything out
[2:03:22] just give the lamb I've got lots of
[2:03:24] pains from my childhood just give the
[2:03:26] lamb Hallelujah if you want to be
[2:03:29] forgiven you have to forgive you
[2:03:31] actually have to let it go am mean you
[2:03:34] actually have to unforgiveness binds
[2:03:36] people go please everyone listen to that
[2:03:39] sermon John Andy preached the last one
[2:03:40] he preached you listen to it about
[2:03:43] forgiveness go listen to it whatever you
[2:03:44] do he talks about it very well he's
[2:03:47] saying he's saying if if you don't
[2:03:49] forgive someone they're still Bound by
[2:03:51] your
[2:03:53] unforgiveness amen and you're bound too
[2:03:55] Jesus says if you don't forgive neither
[2:03:57] will I forgive you oh but I'm the bride
[2:03:59] Lord if you don't forgive he won't
[2:04:01] forgive you amen how does a root of
[2:04:04] business coming into someone they don't
[2:04:06] forgive oh but but but they treated me
[2:04:09] terribly probably they did I wasn't
[2:04:12] looking for it this just happened yeah
[2:04:15] but if you don't just give it up that's
[2:04:17] right amen
[2:04:19] the world is a terrible place and we're
[2:04:21] not immune from it amen hey Jesus Jesus
[2:04:24] could have been a bitter man there he is
[2:04:27] he came to his own his own received him
[2:04:29] not that's the saddest to me that is the
[2:04:31] saddest scripture I think brother B
[2:04:33] actually said the second most saddest
[2:04:34] one is the I stand the door and knock
[2:04:36] the most pathetic picture amen he came
[2:04:39] to his own his own received him
[2:04:41] not how ridiculous it's such a sad
[2:04:45] picture amen and the blood and water
[2:04:49] separated you you when the solders
[2:04:50] pierced his side with the spear blood
[2:04:52] and water came out CH he died of a
[2:04:54] broken heart he didn't die from all the
[2:04:57] wounds he died of a broken heart because
[2:04:59] har he was rejected but what did he say
[2:05:02] father forgive them they don't know what
[2:05:04] they do he actually released them of
[2:05:07] what he of what they did to
[2:05:09] him amen oh I can't do that but you have
[2:05:12] a lamb I can't do it on my own strength
[2:05:15] you have a lamb that that with through
[2:05:17] that lamb you can you can do
[2:05:19] it amen you can actually do it don't
[2:05:23] hold on to anything well they haven't
[2:05:25] ask forgiveness it doesn't matter right
[2:05:27] it doesn't matter they may never admit
[2:05:30] they did something wrong to you it
[2:05:31] doesn't matter that's between them and
[2:05:33] God but if you can just forgive and
[2:05:35] release
[2:05:36] it amen you can walk on amen that's
[2:05:40] right but mommy and daddy did this to me
[2:05:43] you got to forgive
[2:05:45] them
[2:05:46] amen you think about
[2:05:49] you
[2:05:50] know there's so many cases in the
[2:05:52] scripture you take for example who is it
[2:05:54] Jacob it's one of
[2:05:58] the Jacob I think it's Jacob when he's
[2:06:01] younger one of his daughters 14 years
[2:06:04] old that's what the Jewish tradition say
[2:06:07] she went out to see the daughters of the
[2:06:10] land and one of the guys actually I use
[2:06:13] the word raped her and then wanted to
[2:06:15] marry
[2:06:16] her it's in the book of Genesis
[2:06:19] the and and and and the history just
[2:06:21] says they say she was only
[2:06:23] 14 she wasn't looking for
[2:06:26] that amen people don't go looking for
[2:06:29] things they may be Wayward but we don't
[2:06:32] go looking for things to destroy us
[2:06:41] break you w looking for it oh I want to
[2:06:45] be hurt and M and and wounded and all
[2:06:47] these things you weren't looking for
[2:06:50] it
[2:06:51] you amen now what are you going to do
[2:06:54] with
[2:06:55] it but God has provided a lamb
[2:06:58] Hallelujah I mean God has provided a way
[2:07:01] that you can not only forgive that
[2:07:03] person you can be free of that
[2:07:04] hallelujah amen God heals uh emotional
[2:07:10] wounding spiritual wounds God heals
[2:07:12] those kind of wounds it's not just
[2:07:14] physical wounds God can take reach into
[2:07:17] your spirit like only he can do it and
[2:07:19] he can heal things and he can make
[2:07:21] things right amen if you let him do it
[2:07:26] now sure it takes some things take a
[2:07:29] long time to heal sometimes instantly
[2:07:32] sometimes it takes a while but God can
[2:07:34] do it amen a lot of medicine you don't
[2:07:38] just take one pill and you're done some
[2:07:40] things it is one hit wonder amen but you
[2:07:42] got to take the
[2:07:44] dose amen and sometimes God heals like
[2:07:47] this sometimes it takes a while
[2:07:49] while but you say but then like like
[2:07:52] antibiotics it may wreck you like it has
[2:07:54] a me a couple of times just taking it
[2:07:57] but you know that it's going to make you
[2:07:58] better after you finished it amen and
[2:08:02] you just you just keep taking the pill
[2:08:03] thank you
[2:08:04] Lord amen hey God uses medicine I don't
[2:08:07] know if youve discovered that God uses
[2:08:09] medicine sometimes like this sometimes
[2:08:11] just with medicine
[2:08:13] so but you have confidence what you're
[2:08:15] taking is going to make you better amen
[2:08:19] and it's the same thing with the
[2:08:21] lamb amen I trust you have faith that
[2:08:24] what you have is healing
[2:08:28] you but you have to give it over to
[2:08:31] him amen you have to be willing if you
[2:08:34] got just let things go as I've said
[2:08:37] before a sheep is not a beast of burden
[2:08:39] now this is this is totally not what I
[2:08:40] said at Youth Camp but we've just gone
[2:08:41] this direction I think it's fine but a
[2:08:44] sheep is not a beast of burden that's
[2:08:46] right amen they are not you do not see
[2:08:49] packs on a
[2:08:50] Sheep amen and we are
[2:08:54] sheep but if you thing is if you don't
[2:08:58] if you don't actually forgive and give
[2:09:01] it
[2:09:02] over then your whole life actually
[2:09:04] becomes dictated to by that thing hey if
[2:09:07] you cut off my leg my leg would be
[2:09:09] totally my life would be different and
[2:09:12] my my leg would limitate what I could do
[2:09:14] can you know can and cannot do amen you
[2:09:17] take that into a spiritual
[2:09:19] thing people people live their life
[2:09:22] through a
[2:09:24] hurt you don't have to live a life
[2:09:26] through a hurt amen we have a
[2:09:29] lamb we have a lamb that can heal
[2:09:32] that amen you don't have to you know you
[2:09:36] see you see people you see message
[2:09:39] people you know just because we are in
[2:09:41] the truth it doesn't mean we're exempt
[2:09:44] from these things but people's whole
[2:09:46] life can be governed because of a pain
[2:09:48] or a complex from the
[2:09:50] past amen and you can actually see
[2:09:54] it amen but we have a
[2:09:57] lamb hallelujah amen we have we actually
[2:10:00] have we have him we have the sacrifice
[2:10:04] we have the lamb we have God's provided
[2:10:06] way he is the Lord God that heals all of
[2:10:09] our diseases I is that just natural to
[2:10:11] me that's not just
[2:10:13] natural
[2:10:16] amen we have the lamb but you have to be
[2:10:19] willing perfect Faith now this is in
[2:10:21] Mark I think it was the Sunday School
[2:10:23] thing I'm not sure perfect faith is
[2:10:25] based on forgiveness you go you go
[2:10:27] listen to this sermon perfect faith and
[2:10:29] he reads a scripture from Mark 11 you
[2:10:32] know if you say to this mountain be thou
[2:10:33] removed it be cast into the sea you know
[2:10:35] if you say and then he said and then in
[2:10:37] that scripture it says straight off that
[2:10:38] it says about
[2:10:39] forgiving oh I want perfect Faith you
[2:10:42] have to forgive you can't have perfect
[2:10:45] Faith unless you forgive amen amen and
[2:10:48] in that in that sermon he talks about
[2:10:51] Peter walking on the water he says his
[2:10:54] faith he had the faith to do it but then
[2:10:57] when he begin to see the sea amen and
[2:10:59] the storm that's when he begin to
[2:11:02] sink and we have to come to a place
[2:11:05] where the storms of life don't affect
[2:11:07] our
[2:11:08] faith amen because that is perfect Faith
[2:11:12] where your faith it doesn't matter what
[2:11:13] comes you can just walk with God but the
[2:11:16] good thing is Peter he was the only one
[2:11:17] who got out out of the
[2:11:19] boat amen it doesn't matter if you sink
[2:11:21] a few times just get out of the
[2:11:24] boat hey hey the other disciples had no
[2:11:27] Bragging Rights and then and then when
[2:11:28] Jesus he said he said you know he cries
[2:11:30] out Lord I'm I'm going to drown whatever
[2:11:32] he says and then Jesus straight over
[2:11:34] picks them up and they both walk back to
[2:11:36] the boat together amen I tell you after
[2:11:40] that Peter would never have said oh I
[2:11:41] nearly drun he said I walked on
[2:11:43] water Hallelujah you
[2:11:46] you amen that's true hey think you know
[2:11:49] you can be in something that nearly goes
[2:11:50] terribly bad but you just look at the
[2:11:51] bad hey I did this it was awesome Amen
[2:11:54] cuz he walked with the lamb he walked
[2:11:57] with the lamb am now what about
[2:12:00] you amen we have to have perfect Faith
[2:12:04] he wants perfect faith in this hour from
[2:12:06] his
[2:12:07] bride amen that we can go above things
[2:12:10] of good things of Life affect our faith
[2:12:14] you know he makes a statement and and
[2:12:17] and and with this I'm going to close he
[2:12:19] says lot he said the little faith lot
[2:12:22] has was paralyzed by the glamour that
[2:12:24] was in
[2:12:25] Sodom amen so either your faith either
[2:12:28] the world will paralyze your faith or
[2:12:30] your faith will paralyze the world in
[2:12:33] your life which way do you want it to be
[2:12:36] do you want the devil to be paralyzed by
[2:12:37] your faith amen or do you want your
