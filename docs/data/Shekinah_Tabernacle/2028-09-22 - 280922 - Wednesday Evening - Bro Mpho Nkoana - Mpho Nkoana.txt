Jesus Christ amen while we're standing let us read musicians I thank you I appreciate your love your grace I mean your efforts I mean we've got even sister Maggie amongst others God bless you each one thank you Dave for for the songs and the atmosphere while we're standing let's read Ephesians chapter one I wonder how many remembers what we we spoke about a few Sundays ago on one Sunday we spoke about a sermon and we didn't finish it and I said we will finish it sometime how many members Liam and Dave and Dave remembers I I forgive the rest of you maybe you're not around you are forgiven unconditionally but while we're standing let's read Ephesians chapter one and um then we will sit down the Bible says in the book of Ephesians chapter one let's we're going to jump verses we'll read 1 4 1 3 4 5 and 11. Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus to the signs that are in Stokes Valley remember to the saints that are in lower Hutt stocks daily New Zealand 113 George Street to those ones Ryan is writing to you and to the faithful in Jesus in Christ Jesus verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ verse 4 according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world remember you were chosen if you just sit and think about it it's debate yeah and chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love this is just to the world this is philosophy but to us it's life amen listen to that verse according as he has chosen us right when you choose something that means ah it's not you choose it it's not with you you are choosing it right as he has chosen us in him in we were in him when he chose us before the foundation of the world I thought we are living here but we you were there before the foundation you were there and he chose you in other words he singled you out you know when you when you sought diamond in your mind they say there's a room called Diamond sorting room they sought it out according to their quality according to the value according to all the the requirements that are there they sorted out yeah so we were not chosen because of our quality we were just chosen because he loved to choose you he must have seen something in us and that's something something he put himself this is just for honey in the rocket right let's read verse 5. having predestinated us and to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen in whom also we have obtained an inheritance upon being chosen he also gave you an inherent tense you see the word Wilder will also go to this Testament and and inheritance and and and and an estate Heavenly estate those are the kind of related things that are yours inherit tense if I have got any inheritance today I just wake up they said there was an uncle of mine who who's a billionaire with I didn't know him man how do you think I'll feel yeah how do you think I'll feel to realize that I've got an uncle who is a billionaire he I mean he's just giving me those things he wrote me on his will how do you think I'll feel I don't know how you'll feel but a normal human being will feel Blown Away if a human being can feel so happy for the Heavenly riches that when he die is not going to take them how much about eternal life you me just be chosen of all the people people why you so that is a great Mysteries that's powerful isn't it you'll sit down now I didn't forget being pretty no no just let's just finish this one brother sorry I'm sorry sister Mikey being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worked on all things after the Council of his own will I just love that okay you may enjoy the comfort of your seat I'm so sorry I won't do it again and my sister I promise you that the thing is this I just wanted us to read it together while standing you know the Lord the Lord appreciates it when we honor his word amen of course we don't make it alone yeah so last time we spoke about uh the believer's position in the mystical body how many remembers in the mystical body of the Lord amen so I said we are going to continue and finish it off but we'll just recap a little bit and then we jump to the part that we um the part that we didn't finish last time and then I'll bring something towards the end we will not deter we just take another you know when you drive you find r58 State Highway 1 and then you can take either way going to paraparaumu you can go that way Johnsonville you can go akas you can go hey so we're just going to the talk instead of hey who's we take acas but we are going to all right amen so let's just uh first let's just put the word I'd like to be sensitive of the watch and we just put stopwatch to say reset and we let it count it will tell us so last time we we spoke about the believer's position just to recap and then we'll jump quickly to the last point that we were we we learned last time that uh um as Paul has spoken we learned that there's a mystical body and we learned that each part of the body is important and we also learned that you need to find your position that an ear cannot take the part of your nose so the tongue cannot take the part of an esophagus and esophagus can take the part of a pancreas and a pancreas can take the part of a brain yes each part has got its own position role and Duty by position we said we are not talking about you know in church the levels of the structure the hierarchy we're not talking about being a trustee on the charger Army and Isaac we single ourselves we say this is our position in ND and then the pastor says this is no no that's not what we are talking about we are talking about the position in the body yeah because we learned that position determines your possession and that's what we are going to talk about today we learned that the book of Ephesians Ephesians parallels the Book of Joshua as you read in this book you'll find in this book that the you wear a prodigal son but when The Prodigal Son came home he was given a gown amen he was not given a a where were you going attitude right he was not given what why were you what were you think you're doing no he was given a golden ring no the man who went and wasted his resources right right he was given account but I don't believe that that prodigal son being accepted even though his brother was unhappy I don't believe his father was allowing him to bring the behavior of the pig stalls well he was do you think that because his father accepted him allowed him and loved him he allowed him to come and bring Hollywood to the Palace he did not right love does not mean that you can do what you want right we also learned that Joshua was given the responsibility to see to to allocate the land we learned that Joshua was given the responsibility to allocate the land of inheritance in the promised land are we remembering that so that's our recap and we are recapping that as many as we can be members then will be the Benjamin will be there Joseph will be there manasa will be there and all the children of of Jacob will be allocated according to their time levers will will have their position each one right yeah I mean so now today we are going to look at having having recapped about that we are going to look at the position which determines the position we you cannot be able to get your possession if you lost your position sorry we gave it many examples including sport in sport we gave many examples we gave examples that in sport you can you you must keep your position in order for you you know in soccer they say the the other team had a ball possession the whole 80 percent of the time if you if you check that game profile you'll find that those guys have maintained their position they've maintained the ball they keep the ball they pass between each other they score goals and they they shoot and they give position and they don't give it they keep it positioned why so that they can win the game keeping your position the likeload of you winning the game is very high the likelihood of you overcoming the devil when you keep your position it's very hard AI with a Believer it's not high it's guaranteed now if you keep your position don't worry about other things you keep your position where in the way in the promised land where you are you are given the Holy Spirit and that Holy Spirit does not mean that the devil is not there to shock you a little bit when you are given the holy spirit in your spirit you find that if there are still some demons there [Laughter] whether you are given the Holy Spirit it does not mean now you are immune from from demons some of the habits I have not died it is your duty now okay let me show you this way when they go to the promised land right they they found that they were strange Nations and they arrived there they close the Jordan they arrived there brother Jimmy do you think it was easy do you think afterwards it was easy they arrived at the land of milk and honey where is the honey where's the milk well if we are going to fight the amorites and the jebusitis where is the milk I don't see milk and honey here is there so they still had to fight the up the amalekites the Philistines and the Canyons they still had to fight them even though they arrived in the promised land but one thing was for sure that every footsteps that they walk every step every piece of land that they walk belong to them right so now they had to maintain a position tonight I want us to look at this interesting aspect if you look at your spirit it has got five senses how many knows those five things five senses Liam One Phil which is not the flesh my boy not the outside not the seeing smell those ones are fired for the outside for the spirit huh let me see you Bible readers you message Believers let me see reasoning Isaac memory oh man this side come on decide imagination you guys are getting a plus now ah is it affection another one yeah nah is it conscious is it conscious so those are the five spirit I mean senses of the spirit now the Lord give you the Holy Spirit right the pastor taught us here he said when he gives you it comes like a little button ah have you ever you know do you know that thing that will stick just stick it on the fridge there oh you stick you stick something with a glue stick or a Bostick on the fridge sits there so he comes and give it to the Holy Spirit to you right because you can't imagine you can't say it's too big it's too small huh because you can never measure the weight of God and finish it so he gives it to you you and me are given inner measure right it gives us a measure you paste it on you paste it paste it paste it but hey this is like a land you know the holy spirit is Our Land right that's our holy land where we arrive that's our inheritance it's our promise right Joshua allocated Joshua means Jesus Jesus Jehovah savior am I right that's what it means so he allocates and the Holy Spirit is there he's the one now he's growing now he's find that there's some jealous eyes in this land there's some uh Strange Land system strange people that are there there in the in the soul in the spirit I mean there's some strange habits there's some cultural things there's some family Spirits there's some habits that you came with from the world they are there but he gives the holy spirit so now the Holy Spirit you feed him you feed him you are fighting in this you're fighting in this you're fighting in upon sword you're killing and you are eating the word of God so you're starting to grow that Spirit starts to grow as you would overcome you will overcome your oh it's close and growth the more Joshua and them were moving forward the more land they were taking the mo and that is given to them the Holy Spirit gave you the lord gave you everything built in that little button of the holy spirit it's going to be a mountain of a warrior it's going to be fully fleshed adopted son of God but if you start you are fighting man you've got everything built in that button but hey you're struggling is the battle but every time you fight you win and then as you take your position it starts to grow the land starts to grow and he allocates it he grows he grows he goes remember I want to give you an example and a parallel example that the lord gave me here of the five Kings these five senses of the spirit reminds me of those five Kings reminds me of those kings the Bible says here in the book of uh where did I want to read for you why there's just too much food here for me to Dish to you amen now he says uh but now uh brother Ed yeah we're gonna come there now are we are we there yes we are there can we just go to the next page now on top he says in yellow now we have a promise cause our promise is spiritual rest huh where there are there was physical rest this was physical rest right there was to get into the land take everything and rest right our one is a spiritual rest that's what we are given and they and so they was coming to a land that could say This Is Our Land we are no more Wanderers we are settled down in this land and here we have rest amen this is where the fruits of the spirit will emerge why because we are now settled in Christ Jesus when you are studying you are settled in Christ Jesus you are fighting the battle but you are at peace because you know among here there is a captain of the house who is leading this battle who is giving me everything that I need on a daily basis now in the middle then now but it but but it was such a great thing that the inheritance how it was in inheritance in the land that no one else but a close Kingsman could redeem that inheritance now let me just drop a little token here that I touched on the other night you to you mothers how many here has prayed uh for your loved ones lost all right there you are again see you are inheritance in other ways everything that God has given you is yours is your inheritance your children your relatives anyone you confess your power given to you that you can think and love someone and ask God to bring you and you with the power given to you bring that person your power is unlimited you know when they give you a bank card an open check that's what you have tonight do you realize that you and I have an open check let's quickly jump to the next verse I want to get somewhere now we read in the Book of Joshua I think it's Joshua 18 or Joshua 10. I didn't put it here we find that there were five Kings and the first king yeah that's Joshua 10 let's go to the next page brother at page 11 sorry sorry my brother next time I'll do as you told me I won't tell them what you said hey page 11. what now I want to start from Top there on the Yellow Part the Joshua of today put us put the church in his order giving to each one gives places position amen that's what the Joshua of today is doing who is the Holy Spirit right and he is the voice of God speaking through the inner man that Christ has saved the Holy Spirit now you get that much of it now we are getting over into the book of Ephesians are you attending with me let's go down he's positionally placing the church where they belong now Joshua placed them in the natural land now the holy spirit is placing the church positionally in the land that they that they in the position that they belong in their inheritance what is our inheritance is built there in the word of God right now I want to read about these Kings let's look at the story of these Kings they gather themselves huh they gather themselves and they said they're going to fight Joshua they're called and they form a coalition they formed an alliance that's a I don't know I don't need some names you can't you can hear that this is a demonic name I'm sorry I don't need it will you ever find a brother called Adonis oh am before it was taken so those guys five of them came and wanted to fight Joshua right now you find them when you get there to the promised land you'll find them there on your spirit you find that you are affection it's got stings on it and you find that your your your conscious it's got things on it you find that your your your memory has got things you find that your your what is your imagination you imagine things and those guys were not the only ones I just came across this five but there was a plethora of things a multitude of things there were many nations there in your memory there's things right now and a God the Holy Spirit Joshua he's gonna fight them one by one one by one and the more he fights is the more he's Gathering the land is the more it takes position all right imagination all of them there are things built up some of them you can't even remember them in your active memory your your active memory when you are awake they are hidden there some of them don't want to be seen man all of them but the holy spirit is able to thrush them out only thing me and you must allow him must allow the captain of the host to fight you know Joshua came there and he said okay the people went and they fought them and they captured them kept all of them your memory your everything Joshua captured them and he said you know what put them in a cave you know the story he put them they put them in the cave and they went after other people to conquer them to conquer them to conquer them as long as they had those ones in the cave after they've killed them and they their hands were even sore from from dega you know a Deca who knows a dagger they came back now Joshua said okay take them out they take them out and he said to the young people put you know I can see David putting his food there yeah on the neck there I did on the neck as you know deck whatever his name is and I see Ben you know you know Ben will even put his his knee right there to conquer them to destroy them because all those senses of ours with things that we came with from the world must be must die they must die a new memory a new clean fresh brand new yeah imagination comes how many have experienced this you know when you were in the world you used to imagine things man you know this sometimes we need to just to pass and assess our progress when you were in the world there's things that did not disgust you but now they disgust you when you're in the world there's things that you used to love now when you think of them you say hey what are you thinking yeah Hannah you you reprimand yourself why the Joshua is doing the work if you have grown that far the things that I used to do you know the song so it is Joshua now you need to be able to know that they are dead those ones these are the new ones upon your spirit you are gaining more and more than and I I just had such a burden about these Kings I had such a a real burden but ah on our spirit there's there's things that we come are over Jordan with and those things must die those things must we are God's children make no mistake the none God's children have remained on the other side of Jordan those ones are we don't even talk about them we talk about you a Believer a Holyfield a holy spirit child of God you come through with things yes there's nothing like you cross Jordan and you don't have things you they're still there diamond is a very who knows a tick who knows a tick there's no parasites in this country are there things here a tick you know you live in the pharmacy Hannah you'll know us who comes from you know in the city you don't know anything you know I take Marion yeah personally you know that thing there is another tick that is so dangerous the teeth is something that sits on the skin of an animal it's a parasite it sits on the skin of the animal and then it sucks blood it can only live by Blood it is the blood of an animal whether a dog or a chicken or or chicken is even too soft a tick won't go on it maybe lies lies in please one chicken but on big animals like cows you know they stick on them if you don't uh spray them and clean them up there's another tick that is so dangerous you know you you try to pull it out no no no no no no no it rather his head can remain in the skin that's like a demon yeah a demon is like that it's so hot with a demon will remove it with his head and his poison that's the holy spirit amen the Holy Spirit can do that you can never do away with your habits you will never be able to do you have to allow allow the growth of Joshua to grow allow him give him a chance to fight for you yes open your heart amen give your affection your memory everything to him you and watch and see that tick you know if you find it it's so hard it you know it sticks on on the skin when you want to remove it like it's a struggle as boys we used to to play and sleep in the bush in summer there's some little small small ticks you know they stick on your belly button around you you just itching you're not doing what's wrong you know we used to be like wild boys I'm sorry so you'll find that man you're like you know until you you develop what you call a tick tick flu I still have it sorry I still have a scar of a tick that I beat me when we were in the booze playing there and can't remember what happened and I got so sick because of that demon that's how a demon is wow it comes to destroy because this is a battle Yeah so those demons they are like that there's only one pesticide which is the holy spirit amen that one is applied you can remove them oh yeah clean clean memory no why are the things that you used to like you can't even start to believe and think about them now if you are experiencing that in your life be joyful be happy know that hey I am no more what I used to be devil and that's your Victory statement amen that's to say yeah that's for you to realize you need to come to the realization that what you used to be yeah you're normal amen once you see that that means other demons have died if there's more you must identify them yeah don't shy away from identifying them when you see wrong I'll show you now I'm not saying don't guilty destroy yourself yeah but identify the wrongs when he's a child of God is a pliable person it's a correctable person a child of God is not someone who is defensive someone who don't who cannot correct be corrected no a child of God says ah thank you Lord for correcting me thank you Lord can you while we are on it father can you can we deal with this one because this one firstly give me a heart to hate it amen I like brother Ben when he says we we must hate the devil must know that we we mean business when we say we hate him even if he can come and kick me tomorrow the kick that I'm gonna give him is going to be a million times hot so he must know that that we are not fearful of him yeah bring those demons on let them die bring them devil if you are threatening us bring them they're going to die we've got a pesticide that will apply and that's our stronghold that's our help that's our Strong Tower that's our safety baby in The Mother We said that's our safety that's our safety that's our protection it's our safety Glory I need to emphasize it stop it that's our safety what if you say safety is too soft safety oh no no no safety protection that's your safety so those guys must die yes all across to affection level in that area why must they die so that the spirit of God that button can grow and they feel that whole area I asked the Lord one time I said Lord when I was a boy I said Lord help me to dream about you only I don't want these bad dreams as a young man yeah help me Lord and the Lord developed it and I started to dream about him and I used to worry when I'm sleeping why when I'm in trouble and I'm Dreaming why don't I say call the name of Jesus I asked Lord Lord give me to call the name of Jesus I must not forget in my dream amen that's where the fight is in the subconscious when you are sleeping you think you are sleeping no your spirit is hard at work why only the flesh because he's too lazy and too the spirit is busy yeah those five senses they're busy they're busy with a guy called adonizedek to deal with him he must die he also he made coalitions he called a whole group of people to come and fight Joshua so he said well but he said it's we for the winning and that's the beauty of it when we are at War and we know that we are many of the people that goes to war including Putin yeah they don't know whether they're going to win or not they are not sure we when we go to war you know that it's a battle one and that's the beauty of it that tells you that hey you must go full force you must go full speed amen so that adonisetta can die him and all his friends yeah now I want us to quickly jump to that detour that I spoke about but before we do that before we do that mean the message and know it did not preach 1965. and that is page 12 my dear brother he says now and just to re-emphasize on this aspect of these Kings that will rule you my body that we're really ruling my Promised Land huh that to show that they are going to die just to show you that who are they the prophet says now it it's got five illness the spirit right and then five unless I don't know whether I can call them right off now when the first I know is thought is thought conscious and I love and love choice no conscious love reason you know all of the men I'm looking for a place where I wrote where the Prophet says you know he says you see you you you think you think that you use your mind to think and or your brains no you don't you use your spirit right it is your spirit that thinks it is your spirit that do all these sorts of things in your your reasoning is not your your medulla you know medulla or do you call it medala here yes it's not your medulla oblongata It's Not Your Surrender and your your upper Thalamus all those biological things no it is your spirit yes yes something you that the scientists cannot show you the top March of the flow where does the process of thought come on they don't know they think it's from the the even the mind the moment you talk of mind I would like to believe that the moment you say mine that's your wealthy term we say spirit and why is the mind can you say he's here or is here or is here oh wait the spirit is here I don't know where but it's called those five senses and it's their body and and and and I want to tell you that you use the spirit to reason to it is the spirit that feeds your thoughts process and the nerves and all those things once this thing is out this guy he can have as much senses as he like there's nothing you can do once the spirit is deactivated if the spirit leaves the body he even die he's got now the soul goes the spirit you know so the spirit is such a powerful powerful power and the devil knows it that's why it's called the Battleground because we who are on Earth met with this guy called The Devil in the place called Middle Ground called the spirit or the Mind fighting here fighting where for access to the feet of God the inside where the fighting to get there in the inner holy of holies that's why he's fighting he wants to take control of the inside the soul he wants to take control because he knows that there's no five Kings or anything there's other one king and one enemy and he wants to take that imagine he wants to take a place of God imagine I make you and you want to take a place my place what a disrespectful guy but God made him that way and God made him that way so that he can show his honor his glory let's quickly jump to pay charm 13. we want to take a small detail a small David right and and say you have taken your position you have been adopted and now you worship God you have to come to a point where you are a true worshiper of God and I want to read for you the Book of Genesis chapter 4. Genesis chapter 4. it says 4 from verse 3 and in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord came brought the fruit of the ground to come and worship God yeah and this for an Abel he also brought the first Links of his flaw and the fact they're all and the Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering huh and Abel also brought sorry verse five but unto Cain and to his offering he had no respect and Cain was very rough and his countenance fell he loses his position there and there because the true worshiper When God says Ah I don't respect this you'll say how Lord what must I do to be saved you know you don't get upset and say no that's why that woman there was told that ah come on why must we give dogs if I tell you today when you ask me something unexpectedly when you're not in the spirit or you are not up there and I call your dog I'm telling you I want to see the light of day I say no no brother I don't give that to dogs would even forget that I'm his big brother he'll say no no brother but don't talk like that so but that woman never never overreacted yeah he said Lord she got a revelation he said Lord even the dogs eat the she got a revelation that she is a dog and that's by believing that She chased from dog to sheep hallelujah thank you from a doctor a sheep instantly that Revelation he has always been a sheep and he came here the people take her land and everything and as you look like a dog then she got the revolution or faith like this I've never come across in the whole of Israel from that point she was clearly a sheep hear the revelation so now a True Believer if you want to worship God truly if you really want to worship God truly you can see that this process of worshiping God the reason why God created us to worship you was to bring Glory and Honor that's the reason why you and me exist yeah everything that God made was to bring glory and honor and praise to himself including you and me and all the universe everything was to show that God is God it was to show honor and Glory every day everything that you do that you think it must bring glory and honor to God in some way or the other I don't know and I'm not saying go find it but it must now how do I know that I'm worshiping him in truth and in spirit you must always go to the beginning if you see a Cain and Abel but that when God made them and what they were bringing worship can you see where worship started in the Garden of Eden there were the first two people the prophet says that started to worship and a worshiping you can't help it if you don't want to worship God you're going to worship something else because a human being it is in his nature that's how God Made You To Worship it's my nature I can't help it if I don't want to worship God I'm going to find myself worshiping another God yes yes whether sport whether you troop whether documentary of the military whether whether I worship my job or my car or my clothes or my business or my job or whatever something you're going to worship yeah I don't care what you say you are going to worship something amen so it's not a strong tone that's the son of the Devil Himself had to come and bring worship to God he knew because God put in the nature to worship amen but when he brought things to worship God God said no no no okay I don't think God was wrought with him God was not wrong God was just being friendly and simple he said no no no I'm not saying you can't worship when I give you example I don't want to touch anyone else because he said okay no no I I don't respect you your your sacrifice your your worshipmen I don't I don't that one I respect it okay instead of engaging God he did notice the mind he said he got so angry he turned around and I'm sorry kick those apples and bananas you are so angry right instead of asking God okay my Lord because you made all things and he was only showing who he is yeah if it was Abel let's say Abel made a mistake there when he was not having that lamp God shows what does he think he knows this guy all the way from Africa there to tell us yeah no he doesn't say that yeah it should believe us they speak to me a lot no I haven't came he him he was angry we know God designed a man to worship you now let us go to the upper points I've made a few points upstairs there upstairs I mean that's my English now we go to the beginning to worship right yeah I said they check on how it was done from the beginning Jesus Christ told them that from the beginning it was not so I don't think he was only referring to marriage right when he said from the beginning he said even worship I believe he the things that they were doing the Lord could not just tell them at the time but because they were talking about marriage he has to tell them that no from the beginning it was not so Moses allowed you because of the hardness of your fathers but from the beginning yeah I think that statement is applicable to everything right whether worship whether what we do prayer everything our lives from the beginning we're not the way they are today if we want to worship God truly and worship him we must go to the beginning and check how it was done why because a true worship let me know jump ahead of myself a true worship must it is originally a true worship is original if you go down there you you you you'll see that I wrote just before Genesis 4 originality of faith two two worship will bring that yeah yeah original Faith original prayer original worship original we want original Christians a true worship will bring that the origin we mean we mean origin the one that was there at the beginning you you must look like the ones that were there at the beginning chapter 4 says that that our hearts are going to be taken back to our forefathers it must look like when the gospel started in the gentle dispensation it must go back there and look like that one to the original one and that original one must look like the original worship yeah you must have the faith of of uh of Abraham and Enoch our origin the way we I must end up today must be like this if you find that you are deviating go back to the original yeah yeah otherwise you are lying to yourself you're not worshiping God right and I'm sorry if this is hard I appreciate it's because I love you I don't mean to be hard but I'm just wanting to show you that the true worship must go back to the origin how things were through faith original Faith original Christians yeah in this age that we are living in where there is everything of this civilization our civilization our worship must reflect we must be what we call oddballs you know it's an oddball yes when they look at us they must feel comfortable that oh yeah yeah yeah yeah no they must be uncomfortable I don't mean God brought us here to make us suffer no but love is corrective God brought us here to to show Glory bring honor to himself right I feel good I mean Cain got upset the purpose of why we exist we find it part of it in the book of Isaiah 43 where he says fear not for I am with thee says the Lord I am with you I will bring thy seed from the East and gather thee from the West verse 6 I will say to the north give up and to the South keep not beg my children bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the Earth bring them because verse 7 says because even everyone that is called by my name everyone for I have created him for he have created him for mine Glory that's why God Made You and Me For His glory amen not for our Glory not for any man's Glory of course we must love one another I must love my brother and respect the position that God gave him as my pastor and the Elevate him lift up his hands but I must not worship Him amen so God may I must worship the god in him it's just a quiet defined line eh but it's a very clear like this for me it's very bold he's very bolded I worship the father and I worship God if God is in you I worship God who is in you you Worship the Lord that is in me does it come above your eyes I hear this I can I can hear the silence that's why everyone is created for him for his glory and I am formed and I have formed him I have made him everyone for his glory you know you know in the Lord the Lord you know in literature we talk of personification God says I'll call the north you know he he personifies the north as if the north is a person yeah he says I said to the mountains jump like they are humans God talks to them just like that mountain hey you hot River come here and hi people come running yes Lord he says come here I want you to jump and go sitting right behind capite Mountain he says I call them and they come running to me like little cows [Music] how are you boy Jupiter says here I want you to not to orbit this way nowadays I want you to change it Jupiter you know how big is Jupiter there's other bigger planets that are millions size bigger than our planet you know I was thinking the other day I said Lord you are so great I sent Ed a message and I was almost kind because I just looked to the sky and I was crying wow because you know our Earth our Earth this one is such a blessed Place God chose it the way he chose you of all in the bigger scheme of things brothers and sisters of this world you are nothing you are nothing you think we are somebody dead no my boy no and I'm not disrespecting you I'm just trying to help you to realize that in the bigger scheme of things you are nothing I am zero in the bigger scheme of things the moment you realize that and you realize that but it's a big God inside you you know this Earth was chosen yeah there's a massive massive systems out there but God chose this minute little planet to put life on it you can go anywhere you won't find life in any Planet all the big ones some of them are don't even remember their names big they say some of them the way they're so big they're like if you take your golf two hands you feel a bus with a golf good golf balls our head being a golf ball you feel a bus 65-seater 15 people standing you fill it up with gold balls wow it will make one of some of the planets yeah with our planet filled up in that bus to make one planet God calls it one way and say come here yeah so that God chose our little planet to make it nice and beautiful and put life on it doesn't that look like you that look like you man there we go that little planet God chose to make life and choose and say you have I Choose You among many I Choose You and I put life you God chose I I'm gonna Dell in this body I'm gonna tell in this man I'm gonna make you my son in the bigger scheme of things man today we've got over seven billion people on Earth just imagine how many people lived before us from the beginning until today and those that are now being born as we speak God chose you in the bigger scheme praise the Lord what was F why what was Earth doing to qualify to add ethics like you were it's like me so now we go to Matthew again now here we want to talk about worship right they worship God in the mountains according to Matthew 4 the woman was talking to the Lord and he said Lord the Lord you worship but you know not what don't know what you're worshiping this is the story how it started and this is you know our fathers told us that we we worship Our God in this mountain and you use you say you worshiping me Jerusalem why why is there some says Mountain some Jerusalem why are we different why why doesn't our worship bring the same results there's a problem our worship must bring results of the word of God we must not be different if Brothers keep short hair I'm sorry Brothers what I'm trying to say is that our our life our the fruits of Our Lives must bring what God has predestinated for us to bring it must not bring conflicting results and yet we say we are believers we're in the same church we are in the same Spirit but yet our spirit finds conflicts but yet when I see my brother I'm not so happy but yet I gossip but yet I think about these thoughts but here I'm a two worshiping believer and I don't think right about my brother my sister those are ABC's Elementary things there's different things deeper things one of them is love so powerful it is that you can make another Earth now now you can take love and create another Earth with it it's such a powerful force I I was shocked when Isaac said when we had a meeting he said and I went home and I thought about it Isaac I must pray for me he said he can make this place and everything and and then if we live it's all right we bless the next person I said this brother [Music] so only later I realized that is that kind of a thing is called love it's called love to say that you you want to make this place and everything and when we leave and then no no it's okay the next person will enjoy what we did how many love can do that but if you don't have the love to the next person how can you be a child of God how can you create as an example so but what I'm trying to say is that love is so powerful it's got a creative power love for one another brothers and sisters are you brothers and sisters hey friends if you are you can love your brother beyond measure you can draw a big circle your attitude can always be positive by the way these things that I'm telling you just to remind you to wake those who are asleep I'm talking too much I'm referring to this man standing here in front of you is double applicable double applicable because I'm the one even saying it I must believe it if this correction if there's any correction is directed to me just remember that you can choose whether it's to you as well but what we know is that we are in the service and the word of God is going forth each one grab their own position if you snooze you lose amen now you guys Worship in the mountain and this and that and that he said no no no no no no no in verse 10 in verse 10 he says oh no no that scripture I meant the best I meant John but anyway that Matthew talks about when Satan Satan wanted the Lord to worship you because when you be so the devil knows that worship is what God why God made everything and the devil knew that God wants him to worship you he knew but the problem with the devil was that he himself wanted to be worshiped that was his predicament yeah because he saw in heaven the angels for millions of years may be worshiping God and he said man I like this this Arrangement are like but for myself right that's out the devil if your brother buys a new car don't say hey I like that car for me no no no no enjoy it for him like it for him be happy very happy you know now my brother I can he can keep me so happy as if it's your car as if it's your house be so happy when your brother don't I I I yeah I think I was thinking of get no no no no no this time we are not talking about you don't know why I'm talking about that but that's what the devil did when he saw that God was being worshiped the idea or the thing of worshiping is what God made everything we must worship him today in truth and in spirit and that's the reason analyst to worship God in truth and if so the Bible says God the Lord Jesus Christ told him and he said get thee behind me Satan for it is written and because the devil is he promised God things in that scripture there if you read it carefully he said if you bow to me I'll give you everything if you worship me I'll give you because the devil wanted to be worshiped in verse 10 John John chapter 4 the following scripture down there downstairs it says our father's worship is the story of that woman that I was telling you about and because worship is not much about the mountain it's not much about you are coming here to come here is nothing yeah you can go anywhere you can go anywhere worship God in truth and in spirit and the truth is the weight right amen God is a spirit verse 23 of John next one or is it disappeared page 15 God is a spirit and we must worship Him in truth and in spirit right God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth two things spirit and truth and the truth is the weight Jesus Christ said I am the way the truth and the life and we know that he is the weight yeah he came to his and they did they refused him but he came to his let's look at that other point worshiping in truth and his Spirit just imagine worshiping God all your life only to find that you are worshiping him in vain that would be a painful State of Affairs right you need to make sure brother sister that you are worshiping him in truth truth means sincere truth means you know the the idea of just coming to church and we we go home and we take off our jackets we feel good why because we are from church he's not founded just to come to church Mama puzzle and we come together I'm not meaning you I mean us just for us to come to church and we're so happy hey today just because we went to church that's the spirit of religion isn't it it's a religious spirit it's good to come to church we know what because we are made to worship but we cannot just be satisfied and happy because we come to church every Sunday right that's because I'm asked to stand here to preach I feel ah I'm a saint I'm more than I'm powerful now I'm above everyone you don't want to know that's because you are preaching does not mean that you're worshiping God correctly no that's the truth for the bit that's because I am a pastor sorry brother that's because I'm a deacon that does not mean that I'm worship you God in truth and in spirit to preach is one thing to live for him is another you know God can make you a vessel the cell phone is not this catch it it's not it's not what is inside the gadget it's just a body there's things in here you can say wow that's what a lovely phone for product it's got how many cameras but you open my phone you get shocked when you find things in there oh boy you see so worshiping God can just use a tool so don't just be a tool for God don't just be a vessel for God be a true vessel that worship Him in truth and in spirit truth meeting sincere meaning in that context when God corrects you or shows you you know to show that you are sincere and you are truthful you know how do we see you know how God knows when you take that correction when you do it but when God correct you and it shows you and you don't take it you are simply showing that you are like okay now nowadays the case of today they don't get angry they say oh amen amen amen but they go and they don't do it they say yeah that's right you're right brother God bless you and they go home and they repeat the same thing if we say sisters must wear appropriately according to the Bible we mean it that's what it's not us and the sisters need to get to the point where they do that and it was their brothers must love your wife and be priest of your house and pray for your children and guide them and don't be wrong unto them we mean it and the brothers must do that if you don't do it you're not taking God's correction the only thing that you are not doing is that you are not getting angry where we can see you but you're not doing it so are you worshiping God in truth and in spirit I bet the truth is that you must do it but God tells you huh that's the wait you I must do it if I don't do it I'm not correctable and I must start to look at my waist right if we say the church is a place of worship and the deacons tells us that we must have church order not being legalistic and then we don't keep the church order we just go there at the back and talk another Beaver is still praying here yes huh he's still in the atmosphere so we must not those little things the prophet calls them to Loose Ends that we go we go and start to comfort ourselves and say oh no that's not bad what the brother no it's up to how I see it no take correction brother take Corrections sister when the when the Lord corrects you just like when he blesses you because God's correction is actually a blessing isn't it it's a blessing God is an honor to be corrected by God Amen who are you in politics in politics in closing in politics they say the you won't find another politician talking about another politician even if it's something that can benefit you know I a a cheap politician they can talk about other politics politics who will everything that politicians do must bring them higher if they criticize you must leave them up if there's something for them to benefit yeah yeah if they talk bad about you it's something that takes everything for them that's how the devil works right I don't know why I said that point but I wanted to show you that when God directs you be correctable right go and think about it do it because you are doing it in sincerity you are worshiping him in truth you are truth unto yourself you are truthful unto yourself you do what God says go do and you go and do and you read the word god talks to you learn to know when God talks to you amen may do up to so far but when God talks to you and directs you learn to be correctable to be pliable and go not only that go and do it to show God for that you are worshiping him in truth and in spirit then you will see the state of our church you will see our true inheritors we will see it coming to pass in our lives if you fail to take correction and your mistakes when God corrects you if you fail to do that that means you're never sincere in the first place wow you never God talks to you to correct and you're not correct were you ever sincere I don't believe so right and it says You must worship Him in truth truth is to be sincere with yourself first don't prevent the little small voice talking to you I mean it's not this is hard brothers and sisters I'm so sorry thank you Preacher Brother let's finish off with these people draw it nigh unto me with their mouth and honored me with their lips but their hearts are far from me the Lord said but in vain they do worship me teaching of doctrines and Commandments of men saying no brothers must do this must do this must do this but he go home but at the point he doesn't do it right what kind of a truth and and truth and spirit is this one but I can promise me the first one if he produce it he must be the first one to lead that's the truth sister wow isn't it when you sing a beautiful Chorus for us and we cry and we get blessed and we want to pick you up because we don't know what to do with you we are so blessed you must be the first one to lead it oh that's a challenge yeah sister while we are not challenging you I'm just trying to show you brothers and sisters that we must challenge ourselves about what God wants to fulfill in our lives you know and assess and say ah I've been here now I'm here thank you Lord but Lord I want to go more I want more land I want you to grow more in my life I want to take my position and I can do that by worshiping you in truth and in spirit I can do that and let's let's not be a dismissive defensive because those Spirits are demons oh yeah in this day and age they've become so subtle oh yeah that sometimes you don't even realize that ah happy day I was wrought over my brother for no reason Rose I was like Cain in other ways have mercy my father my savior and he worship God in spirit and in truth when you are in Christ Jesus that's God's plan for you to worship Him in Christ Jesus a man yes and that is this I mean that is chapter page 15. Romans 8 we know he did just just refreshing you there is therefore now no more condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus there's no more that's that's that's for sure to them that I encourage Jesus to you who are in Christ Jesus there's no more condemnation why because that walk not after the flesh to walk after the place you know I just walk after the flesh to last after women and smoke is very clear that if those are flesh things I'm not talking about those I'm talking about things that are not easy to detect because remember that that thick that told you about it doesn't just sit there where you can see it and remove it now you stick to it to the skin sometimes you think it's just a little pimple it's just itchy you can just put Vaseline in just a shower you put Navy on a demo [Laughter] no no worshiping him in truth and in vest maybe you don't know I'm back you know so things of the flesh creepy more so brothers and sisters to us as believers they don't want to be visible they don't the devil when he comes he doesn't want to be seen and he'll come and hide the best he can that's right our job is to have more Spirit of the Lord yes to expose him our job is not to to go hunting and say no no I want to see where Naomi is driving to tonight I want to see I want to drive where now why doesn't she go that way I'm gonna let's follow Naomi tonight honey I just want to see my yellowish is going because I want to protect my sister there's nothing like project no I I must have my spirit that will will pray for now measures to drive home no problem why must I follow him the spirit in me in here will just solve things right now my job is to look up to myself my job is to look after your self your own self to a point where it may sometimes even it may even be difficult for us parents that before you even tell them the young ones you must be prayed up man you must be plater because that Spirit you're correcting a child on you may find that is actually on you I read it the prophet said somewhere you're praying for your child you want to kick him and everything you find the desperate is on you actually wow you are the cause wow I ready I can't remember where but please don't ask me to go find it but I read it so I must be prayed up to a point where when I say killer I must be ready that I'm clear I'm praying foreign have you read your Bible tonight come and I must behave in the spirit that read the Bible I must have ready don't tell me to live the life just leave it live the life don't tell others to leave it just leave it they leave it they leave it before you know it that button is a big water hey you know those battles for ladies for those big dresses heavy butter for those some of those jackets you know full the old jacket is taking 25 of the jacket one butter right the here the prophet says in the in the spoken word trying to do got a service without being his will in closing he says no matter how sincere what good motives what good objectives how people want these things and see the need for it there is a will of God to be carried out in these things we must always fulfill his will and his will is for him to be worshiped in truth and in spirit that's his will when we make decisions when we think families it must be God's will it must be God's will when we do things we mustn't just do them we must seek his will because I am a daughter and a son of God and I'm part of this bride therefore every decision everything about me and must I be encompassed by his will flesh how I walk how I address how I think how I eat you may not think it how I eat yes everything how you dress how you make up your hair my girl Diana I'm so sorry I like doing this to people but you know my weakness by nowhere and at least how you prove that brochure how you talk how how easy you get upset we don't get upset easily as believer we can but the Bible says the sun must not sit while you are still angry so if you get upset towards sunset be careful stop it before Sunset because the Bible says don't get be angry until this if you get in the morning it's fine by the time the sun set sister Megan you'll be okay but if I get upset from morning until ah until the sunset I'm still upset no no no but that time my love should have erased everything at that in the evening I should already be telling my boss God bless you see you tomorrow man you are such a wonderful guy meaning it not deceiving here meaning that he's a good man that one who said in the morning here you know if you don't do this we're going to fire you at that one she's the one I'm saying God bless you I must say you know what my brother must be the Lord who's directing you God bless you so much you know I wish I could bring you with me to Heaven meaning it that one who says I'm gonna fire you if you don't do this by next week this Statistics I'm sorry they don't say we're going to fire you they say um we are going to ask you to leave [Laughter] meaning that we are going to show you the door that one that's the one that when you come across him on the road hiking I must stop and give him a lift and driving at his house yes because I'm I'm different I'm an oddball I'm a Christian I can't do things the way the world does things the one who upsets you that's the one you must bring in here and help him truthfully with all your heart and a blessing if the Bible says bless your enemy how much more about your brother right the Bible says your enemy when he's hungry give you food how much more about your sister and your brother the person who's called by the name of God just that he's got a weakness or she's got a weakness you want to be upset with him my sister don't see my brother that one you know butter him decide and decide you know butter when you ask me that should I put your butter at this side and this side I said I think that's a strange question how can you ask me that question Pata only goes on one side you're finishing butter if you hear him asking that which means he he himself his butter is amazing we are done I mean to say our love must be so strong to one another and we must be correctable yes yes and we must not use anything of this world no Act of action or anything or coming to church will ever make you worship God truthfully those are actions that are of the flesh they only confirms who we are but they are not it's not the other way around we don't do them to pray that we are Christians no no no no no no we they happen because we are Christians that we worship Him in truth and the spirit and they automatically happen we don't do them first then we we satisfy ourselves just coming to church alone just being a member of shakana Tawana just paying tax pay your tithes but that's to pay test does not mean that you you have made it but pay your tax please this church needs your ties to survive there is not actually your money the money is not yours it's for the Lord and he says you wrote me you you wrote me I must look for that verse that says if you don't give tithes when you bring it it must come with five percent I must find that scripture you know it I don't mean to scare you I just mean prioritize on time because it's not yours is God's money because after all he gave you the job he can take the job he can give an increase so just don't count it as yours simple as agency so I didn't write here honestly I didn't write here about ties I'm just trying to motivate you that the Lord wants us to worship Him in truth and in spirit and the truth is everything of the word of God the thing oh all things that's what he means please let's get on our feet God bless you richly if I was hurt please I feel somehow that I was a bit hard and not the Brotherhood that you are used to if that's the case I would like you to please before we just forgive me just find you somewhere to forgive me because I love you and I mean I love you with the love of the Lord and and I think the prophet felt the same but he said you know it's because I love you if I don't love you the sign that I don't love you is when I don't tell you if you hear me not telling you the truth and I just keep quiet who cares I don't love you I lie because I love you it's because I'll be free to say Brother Bear my friend you know you're wrong ah you must call me Big Brother when you talk to me if I correct him like that I mean I love him this is not a place to joke let's just get a song and bring invite the musicians to come and then we're just going to Worship the Lord and give him all the honor and just close our eyes and be reverent just going to be reverent and worship him in truth and his Spirit from our heart and just just pass for a second and close your eyes and just let one thing occupy your mind just for a second what God did for you you see when he was at the cross it was the most painful painful event it was so painful because we only see what is happening on the flesh but actually there was way more pain much more catastrophe that was happening in the spiritual Realm his Spirit was tortured so much what you see on the flesh is little that is why when he was at the Garden of Gethsemane he sweated the Bible says he even sweated blood there was too much pressure [Music] so what do you think about that and you think about him hanging at the cross you know people think that he died because that blood and and they broke his bone by hanging him on the cross the the Romans were actually killing you by suffocating you you know they know when they're hanging you like that and then your body weight goes down and the lungs and every the diaphragm are blocked you can't breathe you suffocate it was the most painful death with within of the whole world upon his shoulder and a person like that why would he leave heaven because he loved you love is such a powerful force he did it because he loved you [Music] that's a song that says leaving he loved me dying what does it say living in love loved me you know that one yeah yeah let's sing that one for the Lord I can't remember the ways I'm not sure if it's in our you know my girl let's sing that one dying he said carry my sins far away War Rising he justify [Music] truly forever one day he's coming oh glorious day okay let's pause let's pause it's a beautiful soul I'm gonna ask for a local tune or on a local you know the song but maybe you know it in a different term yeah let's sing it in the local in a kiwi tune in a way which we sing it here locally so that we can all blend in and and just Worship the Lord you know I said you know yeah just hit it that's right that's the one leaving here [Music] leaving me like me dying his savings myself [Music] that is [Music] foreign just to pray because I'm gonna teach you a song and while you are raising your hand maybe you've got a desire and a prayer maybe you've got a burden maybe you just have something to talk over with the Lord show it by the sign of the lifting of the hands as we close our eyes and becoming reverent before God don't have to look around just close your eyes I'm closing mine I lift my hands up before God he can see your heart he understand your desire and your need and he wants to give it to you as we are taught that he wants to give us what we need more than how the rate we are asking he wants to do it for us way more than that my heavenly father Lord we can speak too much we can cry too much we can walk too much but there's one thing that we will never do too much that is to worship you that is to pray to you Lord that is to speak to you father now even now your children are lifting up their hands as a sign to talk to you master as a way heavenly father to express their needs to bring their petitions to bring their their supplications to bring their worship Lord to you you can see them my father and you understand you know our situations you know our desires you know our weaknesses you know our strengths Lord you know we don't have much father and there's nothing much we can bring but Lord into that presence we come I pray for every uplifted heart law I pray for every uplifted hand Lord Jesus some are not
