[43:44] you brother James I liked all those new
[43:46] songs
[43:46] well they be original verses of that how
[43:48] great is our God son Laura they know who
[43:51] wrote those ones okay good you know I
[43:56] didn't think that was the songwriters
[43:59] verses they were the his verses praise
[44:03] the Lord I like new songs it's um
[44:06] there's something
[44:10] the the fresh emotion and inspiration
[44:13] that was expressed in a song when you
[44:17] first hear it for the first time or the
[44:18] second time of the third time that you
[44:20] catch that that emotion and their
[44:23] inspiration you know maybe after we hear
[44:26] the song for a while and we get used to
[44:27] what we get used to thee for that
[44:29] inspiration of what the song was but
[44:30] when we hear it for the first time on
[44:32] the second time or they know the early
[44:34] stages it's got that it's got that
[44:36] anointing to it so I enjoyed that this
[44:39] morning I enjoyed those new songs you'll
[44:40] have to do that sit again like on your
[44:43] Knicks but no I'm serious maybe when you
[44:44] do your next one just repeat the same
[44:45] sit so we you know because when we get
[44:47] to know the songs then we can you know
[44:49] forget about trying to know what the
[44:51] words out we can just enter into the
[44:52] song but you've got to start somewhere
[44:54] you've got to do something you can't
[44:55] learn a new song without learning a new
[44:57] song and the fact that you learn a new
[44:59] song which you didn't talk before you
[45:00] lent it that's all quite simple praise
[45:05] the Lord how's everyone doing this
[45:08] morning doing good yeah I like a smaller
[45:11] crowd actually it makes me feel more
[45:12] relaxed more at home it feels like you
[45:15] can it's more of a Bible study you can
[45:17] just relax and talk to the people and
[45:19] there's not as much pressure on I was
[45:21] going to say to brother bin I don't
[45:23] think that I've ever maybe there's been
[45:27] one preached in a service when he's been
[45:28] here for not been I'm one of the
[45:31] old-timers in the Fellowship you know
[45:32] I've been here since the maybe two weeks
[45:33] after we started but I don't think I was
[45:36] just thinking this morning I don't think
[45:37] he's ever been in the service said that
[45:39] I've preached then apart from maybe one
[45:40] about five years ago yeah interesting
[45:44] not that he doesn't like me it's just
[45:46] that when he's away you know that's
[45:48] that's when he he calls up the reserves
[45:50] and then when they're not available they
[45:52] call up me praise the Lord so I've got a
[45:58] different thought this morning and the
[46:01] way the Lord gives me my thoughts is
[46:04] sometimes slightly challenging because
[46:06] sometimes I just get one word and I
[46:08] don't really get much else on top of
[46:10] that and um I was saying to brother
[46:15] James this morning maybe the those of us
[46:17] that minister you know wouldn't it be
[46:20] interesting if everyone had the same
[46:21] sort of subject and then they had a
[46:23] challenge too
[46:24] to administer on that exact same subject
[46:26] and it would be so interesting to see
[46:27] what each different Minister gets out
[46:30] from their subject because we all look
[46:32] at things from a different perspective
[46:33] you know and the Lord's made us a
[46:35] different way that we that when we look
[46:37] into things that just it's to do with
[46:38] their whole being you know we just look
[46:40] at it a certain way and the things we've
[46:43] guarded over the years we sort of ant we
[46:45] tie them with what we're talking about
[46:46] and everything but wouldn't that be
[46:48] interesting if we did it because I
[46:49] thought if they did this subject they
[46:51] would probably do it far better than me
[46:52] you know like that but this is the
[46:55] Lord's given maybe I'll just started off
[46:56] the Lord's given me this one and maybe
[46:58] the other guys can make something decent
[47:00] of it but the thought that I got the
[47:02] word that I got was negotiation right
[47:05] negotiation and when you first get a
[47:10] word you think man I can't extract five
[47:11] minutes out of that word you know to to
[47:13] to speak about it but as you look into
[47:15] it after a while you the Lord shows you
[47:19] a few things and you you're kind of a
[47:21] few little things come together so let's
[47:23] just see what the what the Lord has this
[47:25] morning but yeah the thought that I've
[47:28] got our heart this morning is
[47:29] negotiation negotiation it's actually a
[47:33] funny we're at the meaning of the word
[47:38] is quite funny because it's it doesn't
[47:40] actually the original design of the word
[47:42] it's almost not really what it is today
[47:45] I think we've slightly changed it but
[47:47] I'm going to go with what we think it is
[47:48] today but it's um I think it comes from
[47:53] it
[47:53] it's a it comes from either Greek or
[47:55] Latin and it's and two portions and
[47:57] there's Niko and then she a ssin is two
[48:01] portions of it and I think maybe it's
[48:03] Greek what's the Greek word for know
[48:06] what okay it's lesson I think because
[48:11] that means no and then the other word
[48:13] was leisure no leisure interesting and
[48:16] that's what um the the people would say
[48:20] about businessmen that they were
[48:22] negotiators they hid because they were
[48:23] too busy doing all their business that
[48:26] they had no leisure so we were these
[48:29] other men and the different industries
[48:30] they could just enjoy life a bit more
[48:31] but that's the funny place that's a bit
[48:34] of a lesson for business men this
[48:36] hundreds of years ago I was saying these
[48:38] business guys got so caught up and what
[48:39] they were doing they had no leisure so
[48:41] we work we if you know if you're
[48:43] conducting business or anything don't
[48:44] get so caught up in it you know that you
[48:46] have no no leisure but that it wasn't
[48:50] what I was going to speak about let's um
[48:53] this is my this is just an open
[48:54] description but it's not really what I'm
[48:55] going to talk about but maybe we'll just
[48:58] stand up when we read this one and then
[48:59] anymore then we've got a few more
[49:01] scriptures as we go through but I just
[49:04] want to start off with this when a
[49:05] strobe one is seven to eight and the
[49:09] Lord said unto Satan whence comest thou
[49:11] then Satan answered the Lord and said
[49:13] from going to and fro in the earth him
[49:15] from walking up and down in it and the
[49:17] Lord said unto Satan hast thou
[49:18] considered my servant job there is none
[49:20] like chemin all the earth a perfect and
[49:23] an upright man one that feareth God and
[49:25] a sewers evil amen praise the Lord you
[49:30] can take your seats this morning
[49:34] wouldn't that be awesome and I think it
[49:37] does happen that is this meeting between
[49:40] God and Satan and do you know your name
[49:45] comes up
[49:48] imagine if Jobe knew that the pressure
[49:51] that he would have felt that Almighty
[49:53] God said have you considered my servant
[49:55] job is none like him in all the earth he
[50:00] would have felt some pressure and that's
[50:02] the sort of confidence God has in his
[50:03] children and I believe that God has the
[50:06] same confidence than you I believe
[50:07] there's been a little conference a bit
[50:09] of a negotiation between God and Satan
[50:11] and he said have you considered my
[50:13] servant James is none like him and all
[50:16] the earth that's an amazing idea
[50:21] that God can have that much confidence
[50:22] and man and he knew Jobe would stand the
[50:26] test of time but you know the reason why
[50:28] I brought this this here up is because
[50:30] God's our negotiator
[50:32] yeah and Satan came up before God and
[50:35] they had this little negotiation between
[50:37] themselves you know and I think he
[50:40] learned a few things about Satan that
[50:41] that Satan is an evil negotiator Satan
[50:47] just does evil things and you almost
[50:49] can't negotiate with them because
[50:50] I don't think he I think he found Satan
[50:52] to me not trustworthy and look even in
[50:54] this situation he's Satan sitar job's
[50:57] just happy because you have let him
[50:58] you've blessed them but you you take
[51:02] your hand off him a button you let me
[51:03] get Adam and I'll show you the he'll
[51:05] kiss you we hope he'll his ideas will
[51:07] change he won't love you as much what an
[51:09] evil person that is that Joe had done
[51:11] nothing at all to Satan nothing
[51:13] whatsoever didn't II didn't Satan didn't
[51:17] really know him before the study because
[51:19] he said if you consider Jobe Oh who's
[51:21] Jobe oh okay well oh now just go and
[51:23] cause havoc and his life for no reason
[51:25] that's evil that's Satan that's what
[51:27] they did to Christ when he was here they
[51:29] hated me without a cause
[51:30] anything that hates without a causes is
[51:32] from Satan that's what he does he just
[51:34] hates without of course and he just kept
[51:36] on hating without a cause but his end
[51:38] will come now moving on to negotiations
[51:44] there's basically four general
[51:48] negotiating boxes or ideas I suppose you
[51:53] could say some of them kind of interlace
[51:55] and like parents at one with each other
[51:57] but generally speaking these are the
[51:58] four that that there are adversarial
[52:03] negotiations when winning negotiations
[52:06] when lose negotiations and collaborative
[52:09] negotiations
[52:10] generally most negotiations will fall
[52:12] somewhere within the spectrum some of
[52:14] them are kind of both like a like a
[52:17] wouldn't lose negotiation and an
[52:19] adversarial negotiation will kind of you
[52:22] know when someone loses they're not
[52:23] happy so they're quite competitive to
[52:24] try and win and the upset so they you
[52:26] become adversarial and the win-win
[52:29] negotiations in collaborative
[52:30] negotiations are generally positive ones
[52:32] where you're working together to achieve
[52:34] something you know but nonetheless
[52:36] there's these we're just going to go on
[52:38] these for now I'm going to speak about
[52:39] some natural things but but we've got to
[52:41] keep our spiritual thinking caps on
[52:43] because this is all spiritual as well
[52:44] it's not all natural everything we see
[52:47] in life was actually a type of the
[52:49] spiritual everything that there is in
[52:50] life and there's so much wisdom out
[52:52] there when we look you know the Bible
[52:54] says wisdom cries out it's everywhere
[52:56] you look because everything we see is a
[52:58] reflection of something in the spiritual
[53:00] somehow somewhere God's made such an
[53:01] awesome earth and it's such an awesome
[53:03] design that
[53:04] we can just we can stand back and live
[53:06] life and not say a word and just be fed
[53:08] wisdom all our life I mean now I'm just
[53:14] going to start off with adversarial
[53:16] negotiations you understand what they
[53:17] are they're by the word adversarial
[53:20] meaning they are there's a conflict
[53:22] involved in these negotiations they're
[53:24] not nice happy negotiations there
[53:25] there's a conflict I'll just read you
[53:27] out these things adversarial
[53:28] negotiations are highly competitive in
[53:30] nature when losing the and lose-lose
[53:32] negotiations are most likely to be
[53:34] adversarial nobody wants to lose this
[53:37] tends to drive intense competition this
[53:39] man's fallen nature right there in
[53:41] extreme cases negotiations a adversarial
[53:44] because the parties involved intensely
[53:46] dislike each other in such cases
[53:48] negotiators may not be interested in
[53:50] winning instead they may seek to
[53:52] maximize the losses of the other party
[53:54] what have we just read about in job
[53:58] negotiations between political rivals
[54:00] may turn destructive in this way how
[54:02] much have you how many times have you
[54:03] seen that in politics it's just a
[54:05] hateful mess sometimes adversarial
[54:09] negotiations require battle strategies
[54:13] now I'm sorry but you know what I'm like
[54:15] when when I read that I think what our
[54:17] battle strategies been hey because we're
[54:20] all in a fight we're all in a battle I
[54:21] thought okay maybe I'll just quickly
[54:23] find out what some battle strategies are
[54:26] you say here's I was like honors war
[54:27] thing again but hey life is a war that's
[54:30] a battle we're in a fight we're not
[54:32] we're not studying back with an enemy
[54:33] that's you know doesn't care the enemy
[54:35] is out to destroy us as we saw with his
[54:37] negotiations with God he given a
[54:40] smallest given the smallest opportunity
[54:42] that he can get he'll destroy you he'll
[54:44] do anything he can without cause without
[54:45] you haven't done anything to him you
[54:47] haven't
[54:47] you're a good man good woman you'll just
[54:49] come and destroy you doesn't care hates
[54:51] you that's what he's like so I thought
[54:55] I'll quickly be a run through the nine
[54:57] main nine principles of battle strategy
[55:03] now this comes from the the American
[55:06] army field manual and they've won a few
[55:08] battles I figure heads we should be on
[55:11] the right track here number one in terms
[55:15] of battle strategies we have
[55:17] have an objective we've got to have an
[55:19] objective if you've got an objective
[55:20] what are you doing
[55:21] every operation must have a clearly
[55:23] defined an actionable objective gold
[55:26] even minor initiatives and quick ones
[55:28] must have objectives it's got to be some
[55:30] objective in it offensive I like this
[55:33] one now think about this in your
[55:34] Christian walk
[55:35] offensive never forget that no military
[55:38] leader has ever become great without
[55:40] audacity the offensive attack is
[55:42] considered the primary means of
[55:44] achieving victory in other words you
[55:46] aren't going to win anything if you
[55:48] don't go on the offensive how can you
[55:50] win without going on the offensive the
[55:52] offensive is the most important strategy
[55:55] mass concentrate your resources at the
[55:57] right time and place for maximum effects
[56:00] they get spread too thin and you know
[56:02] fighting wars all over the place
[56:04] maximise it for the main objective
[56:06] that's why the Bible will say so he that
[56:09] Waris doesn't get caught up in the
[56:10] affairs of this life you know you've got
[56:11] to be fighting this fight and you can't
[56:13] be all over the place and having all
[56:15] your mind on all these other things in
[56:16] trying to fight the fight the good fight
[56:18] of faith with Christ and you're
[56:19] stretched thin economy of force every
[56:25] unnecessary expenditure of time every
[56:27] unnecessary detour as a waste of power
[56:29] and therefore contrary to the principles
[56:31] of strategy in other words don't waste
[56:33] your resources doing things that they're
[56:34] not going to advance the main objective
[56:38] resources should be deployed with
[56:40] maximum effect no resource should be
[56:42] left without a purpose the resources
[56:43] used to achieve secondary objectives
[56:45] should be minimized the allocation of
[56:47] resources should be continually measured
[56:49] and optimized isn't that a good lesson
[56:51] in life you know we we have secondary
[56:54] objectives in our life with all our
[56:55] responsibilities but they are secondary
[56:57] objectives and they need to be given a
[56:58] certain amount of time but they've got
[57:02] to be continually measured and not the
[57:04] most
[57:04] maneuver defeat in anniversary by moving
[57:07] quickly and intelligently incapacitate
[57:10] their decision-making capabilities by
[57:11] surprising them with your movements when
[57:14] you don't feel like going to church go
[57:15] to church you'll surprise the enemy I
[57:19] didn't realize you'd go he's there
[57:21] they're doing it they're following
[57:22] through what's that mean oh this wasn't
[57:24] supposed to happen like this they were
[57:25] down and out for the count you know
[57:27] we're eased up brother Annie was going
[57:29] to give up but he was there and he was
[57:30] going
[57:31] this surprise objective unity of command
[57:36] responsibilities must be clear every
[57:38] objective must be the responsibility of
[57:39] exactly one commander that's what I like
[57:41] about the kingdom of God it's got
[57:42] structure it's not just a you'd out
[57:44] there and every man to himself do
[57:46] whatever you want this structure in the
[57:47] Army of God security particular
[57:49] resources never can permit your
[57:51] competitor to achieve a surprise
[57:53] advantage protect your resources that
[57:56] also means look after yourself to don't
[57:58] look after your spiritual state
[58:00] don't yourself get all worn out and and
[58:02] then the enemy can come in and disrupt
[58:03] you you see I've had that lots surprise
[58:08] strike at a time place and manner that
[58:11] is likely to surprise the competition I
[58:13] think the Lord surprised Satan when he
[58:16] came down he didn't know who he was if
[58:18] they'll be if they'll be who was this
[58:20] guy simplicity of order everything a
[58:24] more is simple but the simplest thing is
[58:25] difficult the difficulties accumulate
[58:27] and in by producing a kind of friction
[58:28] that is unconceivable unless one has
[58:30] experienced war make your order simple
[58:32] concise clear and uncomplicated complex
[58:35] instructions are likely to be must
[58:36] understood mismanaged or botched what I
[58:39] thought about that's what I thought you
[58:41] know what the message that we have I'm
[58:42] so glad that we got a what is it sixth
[58:45] grade or fifth grade I don't know how
[58:48] they do it in the states with the
[58:49] educational system but you know the
[58:50] Prophet had like he finished up school
[58:52] by the time he was 12 or 13 you know
[58:54] he's done that some that's probably like
[58:57] year nine here you know he had a year
[58:58] nine education and you know he didn't
[59:03] come out with all these complex
[59:04] instructions on fifty-five steps how to
[59:06] make your life successful you know when
[59:08] you when you listen to the message
[59:09] letting off the pressure you think well
[59:11] I'm going to get some great all these
[59:15] steps to know how to lead off the
[59:16] pressure in my life the gist of it is
[59:18] just get into the presence of God and in
[59:20] being as presence and that will let the
[59:22] pressure off you think that that simple
[59:24] is that all I have to do why don't I
[59:27] know this a long time ago it's a simple
[59:28] instruction can't be botched cut we
[59:30] messed up nice and simple get into his
[59:32] presence but don't you don't need to get
[59:34] caught up in all these complex
[59:35] instructions they always cause confusion
[59:39] so now back to our topic of adversarial
[59:42] negotiation so I'm going to I'm going to
[59:44] type the
[59:44] one more - like a negotiation like a
[59:48] conflict situation in terms of like a
[59:50] hostage situation because that's a lot
[59:52] of the times they're that very
[59:53] adversarial you know you have hostage
[59:55] negotiators that that their job is to
[59:57] try and negotiate with some person that
[1:00:00] is or a group that has got that a I
[1:00:03] guess evil a nature and they've taken
[1:00:05] over some hostages and then this this
[1:00:07] hostage negotiator has to try and talk
[1:00:09] and negotiate with this person to get
[1:00:11] the hostages released sometimes it works
[1:00:13] sometimes it doesn't and there's a lot
[1:00:15] of techniques they use but ultimately
[1:00:17] there's not going to be a nice outcome
[1:00:19] in the end really there's no it's a it's
[1:00:21] a bad situation there won't even be a
[1:00:23] nice outcome they they're not going to
[1:00:24] release the hostages in the hostage
[1:00:26] takers go free even if they release the
[1:00:28] hostage takers the hostage the hostages
[1:00:30] the hostage takers getting up in jail
[1:00:33] there's never really any nice outcome
[1:00:35] but I thought I'd look into a few know
[1:00:38] and I'll put it this way a lot of the
[1:00:40] time in these situations these
[1:00:42] adversarial say the hostage situations a
[1:00:47] lot of the time there comes a point and
[1:00:50] the negotiator has to determine that
[1:00:52] point where the negotiations break down
[1:00:54] and the there can be no more dialogue
[1:01:00] the dialogue between the two parties are
[1:01:02] starting to break down to where they
[1:01:04] they have to make a call and say the
[1:01:06] situation is going on to another level
[1:01:08] now where the negotiations can't
[1:01:10] continue because that the parties can't
[1:01:11] come to any sort of agreement and the
[1:01:13] threats that this other party the
[1:01:16] hostage takers are going to the threats
[1:01:18] they're going to do that they they want
[1:01:20] to do they will do those threats they
[1:01:23] will kill hostages they will do whatever
[1:01:25] so they get to a point where they're hot
[1:01:27] with us where the negotiations break
[1:01:29] down and that's where we're going to
[1:01:30] start this because I don't think God can
[1:01:32] negotiate with Satan then it come to a
[1:01:34] good outcome
[1:01:34] I think the negotiations always break
[1:01:36] down they break down there's no there's
[1:01:39] no negotiating although there was a bit
[1:01:41] of negotiating I want to tell you I want
[1:01:43] to show you this a few little stories
[1:01:45] just to get our mind into this idea this
[1:01:48] was in the seventies and this was I
[1:01:49] think it was an Air France plane flying
[1:01:52] from Israel calibre I think over two
[1:01:57] maybe it was flying into Paris and it
[1:01:59] was hijacked and this plane was diverted
[1:02:02] from there and it got diverted into
[1:02:06] Uganda but the place was in tibi it got
[1:02:12] diverted over at Entebbe now this was in
[1:02:13] the seventies and they the the people
[1:02:19] that took it were Palestinians and they
[1:02:21] were wanting the release of Palestinian
[1:02:23] prisoners that the Israelis head so they
[1:02:26] release all of the non Israeli citizens
[1:02:29] from the plane
[1:02:30] British American whoever they were they
[1:02:33] they landed at this Airport in Uganda
[1:02:35] and then they released everyone apart
[1:02:37] from the Israeli passengers now in the
[1:02:45] airport they landed that was called
[1:02:47] Entebbe and it was on I think this is
[1:02:49] Lake Victoria which surrounded the
[1:02:52] airport it was kind of on the peninsula
[1:02:54] and the Israelis were trying to
[1:02:58] negotiate with that the terrorists to
[1:03:01] secure the release of these some
[1:03:03] hostages but I think after about three
[1:03:06] or four days through trying all sorts of
[1:03:08] different channels they were going to
[1:03:09] different countries to say to that
[1:03:11] country could you ring your friend in
[1:03:12] that country and tell them they've
[1:03:14] trying all these backdoor deals but
[1:03:15] nothing was working and I think it got
[1:03:16] to a point where they realized that
[1:03:17] these negotiations are breaking down
[1:03:19] this is not going to go as we planned
[1:03:21] and so they had to go on to plan B which
[1:03:23] was send and guys to try and rescue
[1:03:26] these hostages send in their their army
[1:03:29] to rescue these hostages because they
[1:03:30] said that even if it doesn't work it's
[1:03:33] not going to work anyway
[1:03:35] now the first idea they had was to get
[1:03:37] dropped into the lake these um Special
[1:03:41] Forces dropped into the lake and then
[1:03:42] they were going to swim over to the
[1:03:45] airport because it was right on the edge
[1:03:47] of the water but they did the research
[1:03:48] and they found out the the Nile
[1:03:50] crocodile lived in the lake so they
[1:03:55] didn't do that so
[1:04:03] so they are right they they built a
[1:04:05] special compound very quickly this is
[1:04:08] over the course of seven or eight days
[1:04:10] they've built a special compound because
[1:04:12] they got intelligence from an Israeli
[1:04:14] company that actually built this Airport
[1:04:15] and they built a mock compound and they
[1:04:18] trained to how to storm this compound
[1:04:21] that their I mean the hostages were in
[1:04:24] at the airport and they trained for a
[1:04:26] couple of days built the thing trained
[1:04:27] and then they flew into the airport and
[1:04:30] their planes and they pretended like
[1:04:32] they were the it was a guy I forget the
[1:04:34] leader of the country they pretended
[1:04:36] yeah yeah they pretended they were him
[1:04:39] and they had black Mercedes and these
[1:04:41] black armored vehicles they were going
[1:04:42] to pretend that that the leader of the
[1:04:44] country was going into you know come and
[1:04:46] see assess the situation so they've all
[1:04:51] landed they had a quite a big operation
[1:04:53] hundred or 200 guys and they landed at
[1:04:55] this Airport and they they drove these
[1:04:56] SUVs and this Mercedes out of the
[1:04:59] aircraft they actually worked on was I
[1:05:02] think it was Kenya to refuel here and
[1:05:04] come across because no one else would
[1:05:07] cooperate with him and the at the start
[1:05:11] the situation didn't go too well at the
[1:05:12] start because one of the guys that was
[1:05:15] at the gate he'd knew that he knew that
[1:05:17] the President had just gotten a new
[1:05:19] fleet of vehicles and they were white
[1:05:20] Mercedes not black ones so when you saw
[1:05:22] these black ones coming in they gave
[1:05:24] orders to shoot at these guys because he
[1:05:26] said this isn't the president so they
[1:05:29] shot these these the first line of guys
[1:05:32] but that kind of lost in the element of
[1:05:34] surprise because that was supposed to
[1:05:36] get past everything and be in the
[1:05:37] building before anyone knew what was
[1:05:38] going on so they tried to have the
[1:05:41] element of surprise but they lost it but
[1:05:43] nonetheless these guys stormed into this
[1:05:45] building the Israelis and they yelled
[1:05:47] out in Hebrew they said we are you know
[1:05:50] we are soldiers we're Hebrew we we're
[1:05:52] Israelis we're going to save you even if
[1:05:53] you once stay down the only person that
[1:05:55] got shot was actually a French guy that
[1:05:57] had emigrated to Israel Indian he didn't
[1:06:00] know Hebrew Israeli so he stood up and
[1:06:03] he was they thought he was a he was one
[1:06:05] of the hostage takers so they shot him
[1:06:08] but of all the other about a hundred
[1:06:11] people there they they shot all the
[1:06:14] hostage takers and rescue these 100
[1:06:16] people and God
[1:06:16] onto the plane they had a fight with the
[1:06:19] Ugandan army because they came and they
[1:06:21] so they fought them for about 45 minutes
[1:06:22] out on the airport and then they flew
[1:06:25] away with all these hostages so they
[1:06:27] basically risk feeling they rescued all
[1:06:28] the hostages and this was the compound
[1:06:32] that they were and then for the state
[1:06:34] he's still bullet holes in the walls
[1:06:35] there from there from them taking these
[1:06:39] hostages and the the one person that
[1:06:43] died there was actually the only the
[1:06:46] only person that died was a guy in
[1:06:47] Netanyahu which was Benjamin Netanyahu's
[1:06:49] older brother actually was killed in
[1:06:51] this and this operation the current
[1:06:53] Israeli prime minister so he that was
[1:06:55] the only casualty when you think about
[1:07:00] that story I want you to start thinking
[1:07:01] about you know the negotiations between
[1:07:03] God and Satan for the souls of us broke
[1:07:05] down and God had to implement Plan B
[1:07:09] what's our sin to send on a rescue
[1:07:10] operation to come and rescue you and me
[1:07:12] God had to come up with a plan because
[1:07:14] he knew that negotiations with his enemy
[1:07:16] were going to break down he was going to
[1:07:18] follow through with his threats to kill
[1:07:19] and destroy but I want to tell you one
[1:07:22] more story and this is such an
[1:07:23] interesting story this one I haven't
[1:07:27] heard anything like it but it's so
[1:07:28] fascinating what these mean did this was
[1:07:30] South America and there was a there's a
[1:07:34] I don't know a lot about the mother I
[1:07:36] have read about them there's a left-wing
[1:07:38] group called FARC they're somewhere in
[1:07:39] Colombia and they they've been content
[1:07:43] anti-government they've been around
[1:07:44] since the 70s and they are a reasonably
[1:07:47] powerful group but they are made up of
[1:07:50] just farmers indifferent people that are
[1:07:53] disgruntled with things so they're not
[1:07:55] they're not necessarily an organized
[1:07:57] military group although they do have
[1:07:58] guns and everything but they're just
[1:08:00] made up of all these farmers and
[1:08:01] different ones and they've been taking
[1:08:04] people in that country in and around
[1:08:06] their hostage for years and years and
[1:08:08] years and they had they some of the
[1:08:11] people they had taken hostage with some
[1:08:13] of these guys been hostage for 15 years
[1:08:15] 15 years they were hostage for and one
[1:08:20] of the men that was that worked for the
[1:08:22] government that was always trying to
[1:08:23] free hostages and fight against this
[1:08:24] group he was due to retire but he knew
[1:08:26] that there were I think they were about
[1:08:28] twenty or thirty of these
[1:08:30] police and army soldiers that had been
[1:08:33] suddenly held hostage for 15 years and
[1:08:34] he didn't want to retire without seeing
[1:08:37] those guys free now these guys to
[1:08:45] understand the story about these guys
[1:08:46] out in the bush were also they were
[1:08:50] given radios because they could listen
[1:08:52] to the radio and and so people that had
[1:08:54] been a hostage and have been released
[1:08:56] they started broadcasting on the radio
[1:08:57] different stations out to these areas
[1:09:00] messages from families so families will
[1:09:01] get a 30-second slot to broadcast a
[1:09:03] message hoping that their brother or
[1:09:05] father or whoever it was would hear the
[1:09:07] message and just to say hey we love you
[1:09:08] you know we're gonna we don't give up on
[1:09:11] all those sorts of things so so it was
[1:09:13] quite common for these guys to have a to
[1:09:15] have a radio and that they would I think
[1:09:17] that the hostage takers realized that if
[1:09:19] they had a radio and they could just it
[1:09:21] would help them just they listen to
[1:09:22] music and they would be a bit easier to
[1:09:25] deal with because they would just calmly
[1:09:27] lovely life while they were under well
[1:09:31] they were prisoners now the challenge of
[1:09:35] these mean that they had was they wanted
[1:09:36] to send and the army to go and rescue
[1:09:38] some of these guys but they wanted to
[1:09:40] let the soldiers and the guys that were
[1:09:43] held hostage know that they were coming
[1:09:44] in but they didn't want the hostage
[1:09:46] takers to know they were coming in so
[1:09:48] that was a challenge we have to get a
[1:09:49] message through to these people that
[1:09:50] held hostage but we can't leave the
[1:09:51] hostage takers no and these guys away
[1:09:53] from the bush because once they knew
[1:09:55] they would probably just shoot the
[1:09:57] hostages
[1:09:58] they wouldn't care just shoot them and
[1:09:59] move on and the other thing was the big
[1:10:02] guys that were held hostage they they
[1:10:04] were certain such remote areas and the
[1:10:05] bush that they felt they couldn't just
[1:10:07] run away because they would die out in
[1:10:09] the jungles now they wouldn't make it
[1:10:10] out alive even if they escaped they
[1:10:12] wouldn't make it out which was the case
[1:10:14] in a lot of these cases where prisoners
[1:10:16] of war were held in remote locations and
[1:10:18] hostile countries they didn't bother
[1:10:19] escaping because they thought once we
[1:10:20] escaped this compound we were in a
[1:10:21] hostile country we were maybe a
[1:10:23] different kind of skin we are we
[1:10:25] supposed to go right so so they had a
[1:10:27] challenge of sending a message through
[1:10:29] to these guys to say we're going to
[1:10:30] we're coming to get you if you do manage
[1:10:32] to escape we'll save you but we are
[1:10:33] coming we're coming for you haven't
[1:10:34] forgotten about you
[1:10:35] so you well no one man came up with an
[1:10:38] idea of Morse code we'll send them a
[1:10:41] code and Morse code right
[1:10:43] you think oh how they're gonna do that
[1:10:45] so they had this idea they said I'll
[1:10:48] tell you what we'll do
[1:10:49] they said our soldiers and our police
[1:10:51] for know Morse code but these other guys
[1:10:52] they're just farmers they don't know
[1:10:54] Morse code so they had this ingenious
[1:10:57] idea they said we're gonna write a song
[1:10:59] we're gonna write we're gonna try and
[1:11:01] write a hit song popular song and we're
[1:11:05] going to have portions in the song where
[1:11:06] we're going to put a Morse code in the
[1:11:08] song and the Morse code is going to be
[1:11:10] misses to these guys so we've always
[1:11:13] have the verse then we'll have the
[1:11:14] chorus this isn't this isn't 2008 2010
[1:11:17] we're gonna have the verse the chorus
[1:11:19] then we're going to have like a little
[1:11:21] segment and we're going to put an
[1:11:22] instrument and there that's that makes
[1:11:23] the sound of a Morse code but you're
[1:11:24] gonna think it's part of the song and
[1:11:25] they see all of the all of the radio
[1:11:30] stations in the rural areas we're all
[1:11:32] government-owned so they were going to
[1:11:33] have the governments play the song and
[1:11:35] just play it like it's a normal pet song
[1:11:37] and so they wrote the song they get
[1:11:40] songwriters in and they wrote the song
[1:11:42] and they put this Morse code in the song
[1:11:44] and in there contacted all the radio
[1:11:45] stations they seed play this song play
[1:11:47] it broadcasted out to the jungle every
[1:11:48] day play the song and in the biggest
[1:11:51] cities they didn't know it that much but
[1:11:53] this song became a hit out in the all of
[1:11:55] the rural areas everyone knew the song
[1:11:56] they just thought it was another song
[1:11:57] this is a great song a hit song but it
[1:12:00] had a coded message in the song and when
[1:12:04] they did that too they before they did
[1:12:06] that the guys that were negotiating with
[1:12:09] the hostages sending out messages saying
[1:12:10] you know hey look these guys have radios
[1:12:12] but people say why you'll give the
[1:12:14] deploy away but they said no we won't
[1:12:15] because they know that their families
[1:12:18] broadcasts on different stations to say
[1:12:20] to them the are okay you know so that
[1:12:21] was why they were saying let them have
[1:12:22] radio so they they said let all the
[1:12:25] hostage hostages have radios so they all
[1:12:28] had radios and listening for misses from
[1:12:29] family and so I'll just I just want to
[1:12:34] read you the verses so these guys were
[1:12:36] so cunning they even wrote in the verses
[1:12:38] this is the song they wrote but they
[1:12:40] kind of worded in such a way in the
[1:12:42] middle of the night thinking about what
[1:12:44] I love the most I feel the need to sing
[1:12:47] what my heart has to give I talk about
[1:12:51] those I love about how much I miss them
[1:12:53] I talk about pride and strength which
[1:12:55] beat inside my heart yeah this is in
[1:12:56] Spanish
[1:12:57] that what's the next fit and this is the
[1:13:00] chorus a new dawn singing the message
[1:13:03] from my heart although I'm tied up in
[1:13:05] alone I feel as if I'm by your side
[1:13:07] listen to this message brother then
[1:13:11] after that is the Morse code and the
[1:13:13] Morse codes is nineteen people rescued
[1:13:15] you're next don't lose hope and in verse
[1:13:18] two says I want to keep on fighting for
[1:13:20] my friends my family my children we will
[1:13:23] soon see each other again
[1:13:24] I'm sure better days are coming and the
[1:13:26] song was called better days I've got
[1:13:31] I've got like I just got to the last bit
[1:13:34] of the chorus there it's played three
[1:13:36] times throughout the song but I've just
[1:13:37] taken it from there just being that
[1:13:39] we're the singing is in the chorus in
[1:13:40] there kind of interlude before the next
[1:13:42] verse and then when the next verse
[1:13:44] that's hopefully this will play out I
[1:13:45] wanted to play this because you think
[1:13:47] now that can't be how would that work
[1:13:48] but this is what they broadcast and the
[1:13:50] jangle can you play that
[1:14:05] [Music]
[1:14:18] get it and it worked
[1:14:23] these soldiers see if they were listen
[1:14:25] to the song and they they said and they
[1:14:28] picked up the miche's that was in the
[1:14:30] song the hostage-takers would like in
[1:14:33] the song too but they didn't know there
[1:14:35] was a message in the hidden in it and
[1:14:36] there was a Morse code message and it
[1:14:38] word got round through all the camps and
[1:14:39] they say there's a message in that song
[1:14:40] they come in to rescue us they're gonna
[1:14:42] come and they spread spread the word out
[1:14:44] and guys within after that they weren't
[1:14:46] scared to escape their thought if we
[1:14:48] escape the guys around us they're gonna
[1:14:49] rescue us and a lot of men escaped and
[1:14:51] they were rescued they managed to get
[1:14:52] all of the men out and it was a result
[1:14:55] of that song but there was a message it
[1:14:58] was a message hidden in that song just
[1:15:00] seemed like another song you know there
[1:15:02] was nothing to it it reminds me of what
[1:15:05] we going through saves it seems our
[1:15:06] there's just another guy coming and
[1:15:08] speaking is a message in the mist
[1:15:10] there's a voice behind the voice there's
[1:15:12] a message saying it's alright I'm coming
[1:15:13] to rescue you everything's gonna be
[1:15:15] alright
[1:15:15] but see we are hostages here I think
[1:15:18] that's an amazing story of and a type of
[1:15:21] what God is doing the exact same thing
[1:15:23] for us no one even knew that it was
[1:15:24] there but the ones that were the ones
[1:15:27] that understood the other language they
[1:15:30] understood there was another there was
[1:15:31] another language that these other people
[1:15:32] wouldn't understand with and has stood
[1:15:34] the language they see can you hear it in
[1:15:35] the song I can't hear anything
[1:15:37] there's something in that song amen
[1:15:40] now now gonna move on now so now be all
[1:15:44] that in mind right we're going to talk
[1:15:45] about every serial negotiations because
[1:15:47] you know the negotiations between God
[1:15:50] and Satan broke down man was taken
[1:15:54] hostage when man fell they were taken
[1:15:56] hostage by Satan he had us hostage we
[1:15:59] became a hostage to Satan and you know
[1:16:02] God began his negotiations to get us
[1:16:04] back to get us back yeah I'm just gonna
[1:16:09] put this Godhead little ways to try and
[1:16:11] sneak a few hostages out here he came up
[1:16:14] with a little idea and it was this you
[1:16:18] know he we're going to type this in a
[1:16:22] hostage situation you know with the he
[1:16:24] said okay because the wages of sin was
[1:16:25] death the God said okay if you sacrifice
[1:16:28] the pure lamb or a pure
[1:16:31] dove or a pure bull then the net blood
[1:16:34] will allow you to kind of kind of escape
[1:16:37] but when you think about it they weren't
[1:16:39] they didn't really escape fully did they
[1:16:41] under the blood of bulls and goats they
[1:16:43] were this is kind of a funny situation
[1:16:44] but they they had managed to get out but
[1:16:46] they weren't fully free where they right
[1:16:48] they were just say so you had you had
[1:16:50] Satan still taking over this hole that
[1:16:52] he had mankind hostage in but a few
[1:16:56] people have managed to escape to some
[1:16:57] other little safe zone but they weren't
[1:16:58] really free but God had to come up with
[1:17:02] a plan to free them to free us and the
[1:17:06] heating you in negotiations are broken
[1:17:07] down I want to read you this verse here
[1:17:10] just to talk about about Samuel and him
[1:17:12] then I'll carry on this is from Samuel
[1:17:15] this is about the people that were in
[1:17:16] their place saul went to the though
[1:17:21] Witch of Endor
[1:17:23] and he said to her bring me up Samuel
[1:17:28] then said the woman whom shall I bring
[1:17:30] up and he said bring me up Samuel and
[1:17:32] when the woman saw Sam you should cry
[1:17:33] with a loud voice and the woman spoke
[1:17:35] this all saying why has thou deceived me
[1:17:37] for thou art saul and the king stood out
[1:17:38] there who'd be not afraid for what
[1:17:40] source now and the woman said unto Saul
[1:17:42] I saw gods ascending out of the earth
[1:17:44] and he said that to her what form is he
[1:17:47] off and she said an old man cometh up
[1:17:49] and he has covered with a mantle and saw
[1:17:51] perceived that it was Sammy when he
[1:17:52] stopped sleep with his face of the
[1:17:54] ground and bowed himself now isn't that
[1:17:58] an interesting scripture he actually
[1:18:02] said they came up out of the youth they
[1:18:04] didn't say they were in glory and came
[1:18:05] down now now I don't know but they were
[1:18:08] in this place they had to be freed as
[1:18:10] well they were just under the blood of
[1:18:12] bulls and goats there and they could
[1:18:13] still come up and they could actually
[1:18:14] talk with these people I don't think you
[1:18:16] could now because it's a different a
[1:18:18] whole different dimension but they were
[1:18:19] in this other place so these may need to
[1:18:20] be rescued as well even though they were
[1:18:22] they were free they were still on this
[1:18:24] twenty place right but now God started
[1:18:31] to send out a message like a little
[1:18:34] woman well then what he was doing he
[1:18:36] started to send out a message to the to
[1:18:38] their to us to say I'm going to be
[1:18:40] coming to rescue you help is on its way
[1:18:43] I'm gonna come to rescue
[1:18:44] you he started within his scriptures
[1:18:47] putting little messages in there that
[1:18:49] that the common man would read and
[1:18:50] overlook but those that understood the
[1:18:52] language would start to see there's
[1:18:53] going to be a deliverer coming to rescue
[1:18:55] us the Lord though God will raise up
[1:18:58] their prophet from the midst of thee of
[1:19:00] thy brethren like unto me him shall you
[1:19:02] hearken therefore the Lord himself shall
[1:19:06] give you a sigh and behold a virgin
[1:19:07] shall conceive and bear a son and shall
[1:19:09] call his name Emmanuel God started to
[1:19:11] send a message I'm going to come for you
[1:19:13] I'm gonna rescue you even hidden in the
[1:19:16] Psalms for dogs have compassed me the
[1:19:18] Assembly of the wicked have inclosed me
[1:19:20] they pierced my hands and my feet
[1:19:22] most people would read that Simon think
[1:19:23] there's nothing in there but that was a
[1:19:24] mission saying I'm gonna be pierced for
[1:19:26] you I'm gonna come and rescue you but
[1:19:29] unto us a child is born unto us a son is
[1:19:31] given and the government shall be upon
[1:19:33] his shoulders and his name shall be
[1:19:34] called wonderful counsellor the mighty
[1:19:36] God the everlasting father the Prince of
[1:19:39] Peace more messages I'm going to come
[1:19:41] for you I'm gonna rescue you the Spirit
[1:19:44] of the Lord God is upon me because the
[1:19:47] LORD hath anointed me to preach good
[1:19:48] tidings unto the meek he has sent me to
[1:19:50] bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim
[1:19:53] Liberty to the captives and the opening
[1:19:55] of the prison to them that are bound I'm
[1:19:58] gonna come and rescue you I'm gonna come
[1:20:00] for you God had to come down on a covert
[1:20:04] operation to rescue the hostages now you
[1:20:11] know we say the element of surprise we
[1:20:15] talk about the element of surprise the
[1:20:17] covert operation the men that sneak in
[1:20:19] they sneak in you know what to me this
[1:20:22] looks like God snuck in no one even knew
[1:20:25] he had arrived apart from a few
[1:20:27] Shepherds on a hill that the the mighty
[1:20:31] deliverer snuck in secretly I'm gonna
[1:20:36] call this operation Liberty the
[1:20:37] Americans always call their ones
[1:20:38] Operation Eagle Corps or this I'm gonna
[1:20:41] call this operation Liberty because God
[1:20:43] realized I'm gonna have to go down and
[1:20:46] rescue these hostages myself I'm gonna
[1:20:48] go down and rescue them he had a plan
[1:20:51] when he turned up he was on a mission to
[1:20:53] rescue us we were taken hostage and he
[1:20:56] had a covert operation and he
[1:20:58] snackin no one knew he was there and
[1:21:00] snuck in quietly he snuck in quietly
[1:21:03] even the enemy didn't really know who he
[1:21:05] was when they tempted him they said if
[1:21:07] thou be the Son of God command these
[1:21:10] stones to be made bread
[1:21:11] they had their suspicions but they
[1:21:12] didn't know if there be he didn't he
[1:21:16] didn't come like you'd think he would
[1:21:17] you think this is not Almighty God this
[1:21:18] is this is not the mighty army of God
[1:21:20] coming to deliver this is just a man
[1:21:22] walking around he was secret and as in
[1:21:26] his little plan he wanted to keep the
[1:21:28] element of surprise that but he knew he
[1:21:30] was the only one that could go and do it
[1:21:32] and even though even as the Pharisees
[1:21:36] they also didn't know who he was
[1:21:39] then the Jews and all the the the
[1:21:41] Satan's children then the Jews came
[1:21:44] around about him and said unto Him how
[1:21:45] long do they make us doubt if thou be
[1:21:47] the Christ tell us plainly his cover
[1:21:50] wasn't blown yet they didn't know who
[1:21:51] you are so if you I just tell us you
[1:21:54] know we want to know but they didn't
[1:21:55] know but he was on a mission to rescue
[1:22:00] now when you think about it where did he
[1:22:03] have to go to to rescue us he had to go
[1:22:07] to the place of death he had to go there
[1:22:10] that was the place we're here to defeat
[1:22:13] so you think about how how could he get
[1:22:16] to the place of death he's came on a
[1:22:19] journey from here all the way down there
[1:22:20] how could he get there
[1:22:21] he had to die himself and to venture all
[1:22:25] the way down to the place of death and
[1:22:27] his operation
[1:22:27] his objective had to end up down there
[1:22:30] the only way he could get there was to
[1:22:32] become like us and then to die every
[1:22:35] time every minute he was here he wasn't
[1:22:37] here to do miracles and all these things
[1:22:39] he was here to end up in the place of
[1:22:42] death to conquer it and to free us
[1:22:44] that's what that's why he came here for
[1:22:46] this whole objective it as much as he
[1:22:48] may have been having a good time with
[1:22:49] the disciples and all that his objective
[1:22:51] was to end up in the place of death
[1:22:52] there was this objective he was a
[1:22:55] deliverer and operation Liberty now what
[1:23:00] was he after what was this objective
[1:23:02] what was this objective when you think
[1:23:04] about it he didn't want to some
[1:23:06] country's gone to another country and
[1:23:08] taken over because they want the
[1:23:09] resources they want the country he
[1:23:10] didn't want hell
[1:23:11] he didn't want the he didn't want the
[1:23:13] place itself what was his objective when
[1:23:16] you think about it he wanted access to
[1:23:18] it he wanted to take it over to get
[1:23:20] access to it he was after the keys I'm
[1:23:23] after access to that place because
[1:23:26] you've got them hostage oh and access so
[1:23:28] not so I can free the whole place I
[1:23:30] don't want to free the whole place but I
[1:23:32] want to free my people from that place
[1:23:34] when I want to I want to be able to have
[1:23:36] the opportunity that if I want to I can
[1:23:37] have access anytime I want and go down
[1:23:39] and free my people so he needed to get
[1:23:42] access he wanted access to death and
[1:23:45] hell that's why the scripture says I am
[1:23:46] he that loveth him was dead and behold I
[1:23:47] am alive forevermore and have the keys
[1:23:50] of death and health that's what he went
[1:23:51] down to to get were the keys the access
[1:23:54] to it he's gonna destroy the place later
[1:23:56] on but he thought in the meantime I need
[1:23:57] access to get my people out of there not
[1:24:00] everyone but my people out of there
[1:24:01] amen now I just want to throw the city
[1:24:04] has a little sight that when I was
[1:24:05] thinking about this you know the gates
[1:24:06] of Hell are always locked that's why I
[1:24:08] need the keys cuz he locked you know why
[1:24:10] they're locked no one wants to be there
[1:24:11] no one wants to be there always locked
[1:24:14] and everything Satan does is binding a
[1:24:16] bind you and locks you in I like in
[1:24:19] Revelations assists the gates this is
[1:24:20] heaven the gate shall not be closed it
[1:24:22] all by day for this should be no night
[1:24:23] there God doesn't have to lock his gates
[1:24:25] no one's gonna leave Satan can't sneak
[1:24:28] into the kingdom of heaven and I'll come
[1:24:29] out with me on rescuing you we're like
[1:24:31] we're not going anywhere we're free to
[1:24:33] go anytime we want we're not going
[1:24:35] that's Satan's Kingdom all he can do is
[1:24:38] bind you and Nestle had this place
[1:24:39] locked up and God wanted the Lord wanted
[1:24:42] to go down and get the keys and get
[1:24:43] access to this place now that was that
[1:24:49] was here wasn't the end of it even
[1:24:51] though he's here that has finished he
[1:24:52] said that wasn't quite the end of his
[1:24:53] journey we look at the cross and that's
[1:24:55] what we see but when he died he went
[1:24:57] down further to get the keys to get
[1:24:59] access to deliver the people to rescue
[1:25:02] them deliver the hostages so he can come
[1:25:03] back and any time he wants have access
[1:25:05] to it the scripture here that we've got
[1:25:07] and I love the scripture wherefore he
[1:25:12] saith when he ascended up on high he led
[1:25:14] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[1:25:16] men now that he ascended what is it but
[1:25:19] he also descended first into the lower
[1:25:22] parts of the earth he that descended
[1:25:24] they went
[1:25:25] down it's the same also that ascended up
[1:25:28] far above all things that he might fill
[1:25:30] all things now before that he had
[1:25:32] everything under his domain except death
[1:25:34] there was the one thing here because
[1:25:37] Paul says he had all things under his
[1:25:38] feet except death you didn't have death
[1:25:39] under his feet he didn't have that still
[1:25:42] had that was still not in the kunda his
[1:25:45] control but he went down there and he
[1:25:47] got those keys and I think it was a
[1:25:49] surprise attack I think when he showed
[1:25:50] up they they realized they'd made a
[1:25:53] mistake you know that put when you mess
[1:25:54] up you realize you made a mistake
[1:25:55] I think the demons and Satanist whole
[1:25:57] kingdom realized they'd made a mistake
[1:25:59] he is God when he hit and followed
[1:26:02] through with his idea he went and did it
[1:26:04] himself he actually came he had a
[1:26:06] surprise attack and he went in there and
[1:26:08] he got access and got the keys and
[1:26:10] that's why he says I'm here that loved
[1:26:12] us and was dead and behold our life for
[1:26:14] evermore amen and have the keys of hell
[1:26:16] and death so that's that where he ends
[1:26:19] up now the keys of hell and death this
[1:26:20] where is that now that's what he's got
[1:26:22] so he's he hasn't freed everybody but
[1:26:25] he's got access to free whoever he wants
[1:26:27] now we want to move on with negotiations
[1:26:29] right this idea now who said this one
[1:26:32] who's this principle before negotiate
[1:26:34] from a position of strength
[1:26:35] keep that in mind all right because
[1:26:37] we're going to go on to another topic of
[1:26:40] negotiations it's just tie those ones
[1:26:41] and what we were talking about we're
[1:26:43] going to move on to win-win negotiations
[1:26:45] one min ago she ations involve expanding
[1:26:48] apply for example of two people decide
[1:26:49] to go out the business together their
[1:26:51] partnership negotiations I wouldn't win
[1:26:52] the deciding we're going to work
[1:26:54] together and grow something we're gonna
[1:26:55] we're gonna both prosper women
[1:26:58] negotiations may be just as focused on
[1:27:00] building a bigger pie as dividing the
[1:27:01] pie fairly every effort should be made
[1:27:03] to keep negotiations friendly and
[1:27:05] constructive right now when when we're
[1:27:07] all going to win there's no need to sort
[1:27:08] of battle each other we're negotiating
[1:27:10] together to try and one more right now
[1:27:15] keep this idea in mind you negotiate
[1:27:17] from a position of strength we're going
[1:27:21] to go on to win-win negotiations now God
[1:27:25] the Lord had taken over the kingdom of
[1:27:28] hell did you take him here take he had
[1:27:29] access to it right then he could start
[1:27:32] to come down and negotiate with you and
[1:27:34] negotiate with me from position of
[1:27:37] strength
[1:27:38] I love the scripture as I 1:18 says come
[1:27:44] now and let us reason together come now
[1:27:46] let's have a negotiation saith the Lord
[1:27:49] though your sins be as scarlet they
[1:27:51] shall be white as wool though they be
[1:27:55] red like crimson or they shall be white
[1:27:57] as snow though they be red like crimson
[1:27:59] they shall be as wool there's still a
[1:28:01] little bit of negotiating and by the way
[1:28:04] I'm negotiating from a position of
[1:28:05] strength because if your sins are
[1:28:07] scarlet I can make them white as snow if
[1:28:10] they're red like crimson I can make them
[1:28:12] white like wool he comes in because he's
[1:28:16] got access now to to hell to death to
[1:28:19] where we were he's got access he can
[1:28:20] come down and negotiate with us now
[1:28:23] these are wouldn't win negotiations he
[1:28:26] say he's not in there to negotiate our
[1:28:28] failure he's in there to negotiate our
[1:28:30] success the Spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:28:34] me because he has anointed me to preach
[1:28:36] good tidings unto the meek he has sent
[1:28:38] me to bind up the brokenhearted to
[1:28:39] proclaim Liberty to the captives the
[1:28:41] opening of the prison to them that are
[1:28:42] bound to proclaim the acceptable year of
[1:28:44] the Lord and that their vengeance of our
[1:28:46] God and comfort all that mourn so point
[1:28:49] unto them that mourn in Zion and here's
[1:28:50] as negotiations to give them beauty for
[1:28:54] Ashes here's my negotiation with you
[1:28:56] I'll give you you got a Shazz I'll give
[1:28:57] you beauty have you got morning I'll
[1:29:01] give you joy the oil of joy for mourning
[1:29:03] have you got a spirit of heaviness I'll
[1:29:05] give you the spirit of praise that we
[1:29:08] might be called the trees of
[1:29:09] righteousness the planting of the Lord
[1:29:10] that he might be glorified these
[1:29:12] wouldn't win negotiations are very very
[1:29:14] good negotiations that's the type of
[1:29:16] negotiations that he has when he comes
[1:29:18] in negotiating with us this is what I'll
[1:29:20] do for you that's his negotiations with
[1:29:22] us you believe that now as an every
[1:29:26] negotiation right every parties got to
[1:29:29] come out of it with something it's got
[1:29:30] to be one one he's saying if you're
[1:29:33] bound I'll make you free if you're
[1:29:35] hurting I'll heal you if you're
[1:29:37] brokenhearted I'll make you happy if
[1:29:38] you're sad I'll make you happy if you're
[1:29:40] a second oh he loved you if you're if
[1:29:42] you're in Chains I'll deliver you
[1:29:44] anything you want I'll do it for you
[1:29:46] that's this this is what I'm gonna give
[1:29:48] to the negotiations because I've
[1:29:50] conquered everything I can give you
[1:29:51] anything you want
[1:29:52] right but there's always a catch to it
[1:29:55] because these are negotiations that one
[1:29:57] one what does he want I want to be your
[1:30:00] God I want to be your God you be my
[1:30:02] people don't I'll be your God now should
[1:30:04] have no other gods before me that's
[1:30:05] that's that's my term with you you just
[1:30:08] do that from L do this for you so
[1:30:10] likewise who superbear view there
[1:30:12] forsake us not all their death cannot be
[1:30:13] motorcycle forsake all you have and
[1:30:15] follow me that's what I want from you
[1:30:17] what do you want from me and this what
[1:30:18] do I have to do do this
[1:30:19] that's this negotiation back it's not
[1:30:21] just I'll do or listen you and you
[1:30:22] deliver we need the way you want it's a
[1:30:24] negotiation between parties and we all
[1:30:26] agree okay there that's that's a fear
[1:30:28] that's a fear deal I think I'm coming
[1:30:30] out of this deal quite world you ever
[1:30:32] been in the negotiation when you come
[1:30:33] out really well you think man I won that
[1:30:35] negotiation everything went well he says
[1:30:38] if you walk in my statues and keep my
[1:30:41] commandments and do them this is my deal
[1:30:42] with you if you walk in my ways and do
[1:30:44] them then I'll give you rain and juice
[1:30:46] season in the land shall yield her
[1:30:47] increase and the trees of the fruit
[1:30:49] field shell yield their fruit and your
[1:30:51] threshing shall reach unto the vintage
[1:30:53] and the vintage shall reach unto the
[1:30:54] sowing time and you shall eat your bread
[1:30:56] to the full and dwell in your land
[1:30:58] safely and I will give peace in the land
[1:31:00] and you shall lie down a none shall make
[1:31:01] you afraid I will read evil beasts out
[1:31:03] of the land neither shall the sword goes
[1:31:05] through your land and you shall chase
[1:31:07] your enemies and they shall fall before
[1:31:09] you by the sword if five of you shall
[1:31:10] chase in hundred and 100 of you shall
[1:31:12] put ten thousand to flight and your
[1:31:13] enemy shall fall before you by the sword
[1:31:15] for all have respect unto you and make
[1:31:17] you fruitful and multiply you and
[1:31:19] establish my covenant with you and you
[1:31:21] shall eat old store and bring forth old
[1:31:24] because of the new and I'll set my table
[1:31:26] and among you and my soul shall not
[1:31:28] abort you and I will walk among you and
[1:31:30] will be your God and you shall be my
[1:31:31] people
[1:31:32] what a great negotiation that is for us
[1:31:35] he came down to hell and he negotiated
[1:31:37] with us to the place of death negotiator
[1:31:39] this is what I want to do with you this
[1:31:41] is my deal with you you know when we
[1:31:43] agree we get it we see you know what I
[1:31:45] agree to that deal yep I'll do it I'll
[1:31:47] forsake all I'll follow you
[1:31:49] he says right let's get out of here
[1:31:50] let's get out of this place come with me
[1:31:53] Satan can't negotiate with any of us to
[1:31:56] go back he tries but he can't do it that
[1:32:00] says that's that wouldn't win
[1:32:01] negotiation the God is with us now the
[1:32:03] next one I want to touch on I've got two
[1:32:04] more these ones are quite sure
[1:32:06] this one is when lose negotiations right
[1:32:09] once of the one lose one there which
[1:32:10] gets a little bit negative in terms of
[1:32:12] the outcome of it now in game theory
[1:32:14] they call a win lose negotiation a
[1:32:15] zero-sum game a common analogy for a
[1:32:18] zero-sum game is dividing the pie the
[1:32:20] pie doesn't get smaller or bigger the
[1:32:21] players play a game to decide who gets
[1:32:23] the bigger slice so now we're not and a
[1:32:25] wouldn't win one you're deciding we're
[1:32:26] going to be expanding and you know we're
[1:32:28] going to just work together this one
[1:32:29] here it's a sin amount and we're gonna
[1:32:31] fight over who gets what if you're
[1:32:33] facing a one lose negotiation focus your
[1:32:35] strategy on determining the other
[1:32:37] party's minimum minimum requirements
[1:32:39] what's the least you're gonna need out
[1:32:41] of this agreement and I'll kind of try
[1:32:43] and get as close to that as I can so
[1:32:45] that I get as much as I can right the
[1:32:46] pie is not getting any bigger right
[1:32:48] they're called win lose because
[1:32:49] essentially you try and divide it but
[1:32:51] you know someone if they get it but more
[1:32:53] the other ones gonna lose it there's no
[1:32:54] real is that real overall gain it's a
[1:32:56] zero-sum game someone loses the gauge
[1:33:00] negotiations and normal life can get
[1:33:03] into negative gain situations all right
[1:33:07] now I've coined this little phrase ramen
[1:33:12] won't mind me telling this because I
[1:33:13] said I was going to now this is a
[1:33:16] natural negotiation right because I I
[1:33:21] heard of a situation hit ramen that
[1:33:25] years and years ago before she realized
[1:33:28] it was a negative gain so she doesn't do
[1:33:29] it anymore
[1:33:32] so now you need a new tie for your car
[1:33:35] right your tire you need to get a new
[1:33:37] tire so there's a place in New Zealand
[1:33:41] called Tony's tires and they have a
[1:33:43] policy if you get a quote from another
[1:33:46] tire place we will beat it by X percent
[1:33:48] 15 percent whatever it is as a 15
[1:33:50] percent 20 doesn't do it anymore see he
[1:33:54] just pays a fair price right 15 percent
[1:33:56] say most of its about 15 percent so if
[1:33:58] you can go on the other say I've got a
[1:33:59] quote from John's tires for a 100
[1:34:02] dollars they'll give you 15% off that
[1:34:04] hefty so now Rama knows this right so
[1:34:08] she's not just going to go to Tony's
[1:34:11] tires and get a tire she's going to go
[1:34:12] to other places and get quotes and then
[1:34:13] take it to Tony's get 15% off that again
[1:34:16] so she goes to one place and
[1:34:20] she's getting a quote and this is the
[1:34:21] way that I understood the story she may
[1:34:23] differ but for the purposes of the story
[1:34:25] it sounds better she basically said look
[1:34:29] I'm not really going to Cecily she said
[1:34:31] I'm not really going to buy the toy from
[1:34:32] you I'm just gonna take your quote and
[1:34:34] go to Tony's tires you know so yes it's
[1:34:39] honest you know look I'm just here to
[1:34:40] get a quote I'm just kind of gonna waste
[1:34:41] five minutes of your time then I'm gonna
[1:34:43] be out of here so I'm not gonna buy
[1:34:44] anything off you so the guy said well if
[1:34:47] you're gonna do that I don't like Toni's
[1:34:49] tires I'm just gonna I'm gonna give you
[1:34:52] a quote for a below cost so then when
[1:34:55] you take it to Tony's tie is he gonna
[1:34:56] get it down even further than that and
[1:34:58] you're gonna get the fire way way below
[1:35:00] cost because I'm gonna give you a below
[1:35:01] cost quote then you're going to go there
[1:35:02] and get even more below cost but he
[1:35:04] wouldn't give her that price if he knew
[1:35:06] that she wasn't going to Tony's right
[1:35:09] she's only gonna give her that that
[1:35:11] price because she knows he knows you're
[1:35:12] going to attain his tires so she gets
[1:35:15] this below cost quote and then goes down
[1:35:18] to Tony's tires and say it's how I got
[1:35:19] this quote for this tire and apparently
[1:35:21] the guy they said you what no it's too
[1:35:25] cheap like this the time might be a
[1:35:28] hundred dollars a good price she might
[1:35:30] have got a quote for 50 he's got a beat
[1:35:31] 50 he's got to get down to $40 or $42
[1:35:34] you know did they give you this quote
[1:35:36] yeah they gave me the quote they were
[1:35:38] going to give it to me for that they
[1:35:39] weren't they just wanted to nice with
[1:35:42] these competition true story right okay
[1:35:49] so she gets a tie for way way below cost
[1:35:52] you know got the tie put on off she goes
[1:35:54] you know happy now I hear about the
[1:36:00] story right know something any sort of
[1:36:03] just begins to swirl around and in my
[1:36:06] mind and I'm going there's just
[1:36:08] something about that story that I just
[1:36:10] there's something about this situation
[1:36:11] that it's not really settling well the
[1:36:14] pieces aren't really going well together
[1:36:16] and my my mind right
[1:36:19] not that it's anything on here was just
[1:36:21] the I thought what is it about that
[1:36:23] situation that I just I can't seem to
[1:36:25] make it all work properly it doesn't
[1:36:27] seem doesn't seem hundred percent right
[1:36:28] to me and and this has helped me in lots
[1:36:32] of situations to understand
[1:36:33] this principal not that ramen was wrong
[1:36:36] but it was just there was nice that I
[1:36:37] could keep me thinking about this now
[1:36:39] any pre transaction say say that you do
[1:36:43] naturally in life this is a little
[1:36:44] lesson they should be our interactions
[1:36:47] with each other and with the general
[1:36:49] public in people they should be 1:1 in
[1:36:51] terms of you know there's an amount that
[1:36:53] some people say you're doing a business
[1:36:54] transaction they've got their costs and
[1:36:56] they want to make the imagine the other
[1:36:57] business forgot their costs they want to
[1:36:59] make the imagine and if you are one one
[1:37:00] is look we both make our fear honest
[1:37:02] margin you know it varies a little bit
[1:37:05] but in general most transit the
[1:37:07] transaction should be that I make my but
[1:37:10] you make your but you know and say and
[1:37:12] what's the tire it's like I want to pay
[1:37:14] the market price plus a better picture
[1:37:16] of profit for the tie because that's
[1:37:17] what it costs you to do it I'm getting a
[1:37:19] tire out of it you're getting a business
[1:37:21] you can run your business everything
[1:37:22] it's a fair transaction what happened in
[1:37:26] that transaction was it got into
[1:37:28] negative gain to where one person's gain
[1:37:30] didn't come from the profit it started
[1:37:33] the other party had to lose now they had
[1:37:36] to actually lose for the other person to
[1:37:37] gain their to lose more so then the
[1:37:40] extra bit of profit they got was not
[1:37:41] what wasn't a fair amount it was
[1:37:43] actually it was coming via gain was
[1:37:46] coming from someone else's loss so there
[1:37:48] was this way called negative gain now
[1:37:50] now if you get caught in a negative gain
[1:37:52] situation you're not going to have a
[1:37:53] nice taste in your mouth towards the
[1:37:55] person that you just got ripped off from
[1:37:56] are you you know and I thought you know
[1:37:59] we can operate in a way in life that we
[1:38:01] don't have to make money from negative
[1:38:03] gain no one else has to lose past what
[1:38:05] they should in order for us to gain as a
[1:38:07] Christian I thought you know I thought
[1:38:08] when I when I do it when I do things I
[1:38:12] want to make sure they every deal it's
[1:38:14] fear I don't want to start profiting
[1:38:16] from someone else's loss you know I
[1:38:18] thought that wouldn't be in that I'm
[1:38:20] sure God can make us prosper without
[1:38:22] having to do that because to me that's
[1:38:24] that's what that's there's suddenly that
[1:38:27] evil mean and do that not that ramens
[1:38:30] evil but I'm just I'm glad she gave the
[1:38:32] situation to me but you know James talks
[1:38:34] about the you know the hireling in the
[1:38:37] field is he's crying out to me because
[1:38:38] you've held Becca's wages by fraud you
[1:38:40] know he's ripped him off they should
[1:38:41] have gotten more for what they were
[1:38:43] doing he's done some scheme to rip him
[1:38:45] off to not pay the money worth
[1:38:47] he's keeping the money himself see he
[1:38:50] would still have had a lot he just
[1:38:51] needed to give him his fair share and
[1:38:52] that's the way that a Christian kind of
[1:38:54] operates and that's how Brahman operates
[1:38:56] all the time there even so much so that
[1:38:57] she does it too much I have to tell her
[1:38:58] look we need to make money here Brahman
[1:39:01] no no
[1:39:02] so negative gain situations right I want
[1:39:07] to tell you that but there's a bit now
[1:39:08] there's a time when we do negative gain
[1:39:10] situations that's why I said it right
[1:39:12] who knows this place Mara Largo so this
[1:39:16] is now the presidential retreat in
[1:39:18] Florida they have different retreats
[1:39:21] this one is actually one of Donald
[1:39:24] Trump's how retreats but now it's a
[1:39:26] presidential retreat because he's the
[1:39:28] president and I want to tell you the
[1:39:32] story about negotiation too just to get
[1:39:34] us onto this idea of he's wouldn't lose
[1:39:36] negotiations so I think it was the ATC
[1:39:41] Donald Trump went to Florida and saw
[1:39:43] this place here and he wanted to buy it
[1:39:46] that's the place I want I want to buy
[1:39:48] that it's about 17 acres the old mansion
[1:39:51] and the family that had it the mother
[1:39:53] had earned a lot of money and she it was
[1:39:55] her place if she had died and the
[1:39:56] daughters were kind of looking after it
[1:39:59] but I don't think they were as shrewd as
[1:40:02] the mother was in terms of acquiring
[1:40:04] assets because they just acquired this
[1:40:06] thing from an inheritance but this sum
[1:40:12] and that they had actually the
[1:40:15] government used it for a presidential
[1:40:17] retreat as well but the different
[1:40:19] presidents had gone to other places
[1:40:20] instead like that if they were from
[1:40:22] Texas they Cibolo in a row I'd rather go
[1:40:24] on stream ultimate Texas or spend more
[1:40:25] time we run from rather than go to
[1:40:26] Florida I'm not from Florida so a lot of
[1:40:29] the prisoners weren't using it and so it
[1:40:33] was kind of becoming costly to upkeep so
[1:40:35] it was it became a bit of a no one
[1:40:37] really wanted it no so expensive no they
[1:40:38] couldn't really sell it cuz it was such
[1:40:40] an expensive place to sell it was a
[1:40:42] mansion and so the but then in the end
[1:40:45] the daughters thought okay what we'll
[1:40:46] sell it we'll just sell it you know
[1:40:47] because it's not really what it's not
[1:40:50] really working for us and the upkeep of
[1:40:51] it every year was about a million
[1:40:53] dollars that keep this place you know so
[1:40:56] so Donald Trump goes here's a look at it
[1:40:59] any Danny says right
[1:41:01] and I'll give you 25 million dollars for
[1:41:03] the place they said no that's not enough
[1:41:05] we need them we need more than that 25
[1:41:07] million okay it's fun that's all I'm
[1:41:09] gonna offer I'm going in the meantime
[1:41:13] you see the little stretch of beachfront
[1:41:16] where there's a little house in a little
[1:41:18] pool in that that was up for sale for
[1:41:20] two million dollars they bought it I'm
[1:41:22] gonna buy the front I don't know if they
[1:41:24] sold or someone else sold it but that
[1:41:25] was a different lot he bought that
[1:41:26] different lot he said okay that's what
[1:41:28] I'm gonna do now this is an evil man
[1:41:29] it's not good right this is what I'm
[1:41:32] gonna do
[1:41:32] I'm gonna build me and big tall ugly
[1:41:35] skinny long building along the front
[1:41:37] there because in that place that the
[1:41:39] back is not going to be able to be sold
[1:41:40] because it's gonna have no beach view
[1:41:42] it's gonna have nothing and it's gonna
[1:41:43] have a stupid 8 story thin little
[1:41:47] apartment block he doesn't he had an
[1:41:49] architect design up this little squiggly
[1:41:50] long building purely to to force the
[1:41:57] people behind them to sell and he drew
[1:41:59] up plans and the community was like you
[1:42:00] Capital bit junk me you know it's gonna
[1:42:02] ruin the look of the beach you said ok
[1:42:04] that's what I'm building here that's
[1:42:05] what I want to build he was doing it too
[1:42:06] so I could negotiate with the people at
[1:42:08] the back once people knew that he had
[1:42:10] that he had bought the beach and he
[1:42:12] wanted to build that ugly building up
[1:42:14] the front to block the view off no one
[1:42:17] wanted to buy the mera Lago anymore no I
[1:42:20] wanted to buy they couldn't find a buyer
[1:42:21] because they said he Trump's is gonna
[1:42:23] build an ugly wall of the front in your
[1:42:24] place is gonna be worthless no beach
[1:42:26] view and and so the price went down down
[1:42:31] he ended up buying the place for 8
[1:42:32] million dollars because they got
[1:42:33] desperate so they went from 25 million
[1:42:36] to 8 million thank you bye bye
[1:42:39] now that's that's quite hard
[1:42:41] negotiations I think that's a bit
[1:42:43] dishonest but you know but there's a
[1:42:48] principle and that though that when we
[1:42:52] negotiate with Satan this when you do
[1:42:55] wouldn't lose negotiations negative gain
[1:42:57] negotiations you don't give up an inch
[1:43:00] see these things in our life that belong
[1:43:03] to us there are promises of God Satan is
[1:43:05] going to try and negotiate you and me
[1:43:07] out of having all of it you know see I
[1:43:08] just you take 50 percent I'll keep 50 no
[1:43:11] you got whatever it might be you know
[1:43:14] you're kind of
[1:43:15] must be healed but uh you know who
[1:43:16] you'll never quite do that well if
[1:43:17] you've got promises don't let Satan
[1:43:19] negotiate you out of anything your
[1:43:21] desires the whole lot
[1:43:23] you got to play hardball to get the
[1:43:25] whole lot don't don't don't give up oh
[1:43:27] well he's he you know he wants to keep
[1:43:29] it all no no it's yours you can take it
[1:43:31] you can take it I want to read this
[1:43:35] quote from brother Brennan and I've got
[1:43:36] one more after this this is about the
[1:43:39] statue of a perfect man and I like this
[1:43:42] because God's given us a promise that
[1:43:44] we're going to grow into the statue of a
[1:43:46] perfect man but how many feels like you
[1:43:47] are you know who's telling you hit it's
[1:43:50] Satan trying to come in and the ghosts
[1:43:52] yet you're not quite gonna get there
[1:43:53] just don't quite this bit in your
[1:43:55] character is not quite gonna because you
[1:43:57] like this you know he starts to try and
[1:43:59] negotiate his way to not to you giving
[1:44:02] up some of your inheritance that's all
[1:44:05] that stuff is because of God's are you
[1:44:06] going to come into the statue of a
[1:44:07] perfect man than you are and don't let
[1:44:11] Satan negotiate you out of what is yours
[1:44:15] add to your faith virtue into your
[1:44:17] virtue knowledge into your knowledge
[1:44:19] temperance to your temperance patience
[1:44:20] to your patience godliness to your
[1:44:22] godliness brotherly love to your
[1:44:23] brotherly love the Holy Spirit and
[1:44:24] Christ will come because just beneath
[1:44:26] him the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of
[1:44:28] Christ into the church to manifest those
[1:44:29] virtues then as a he says if he's
[1:44:32] anything he says I pledge this morning
[1:44:34] to him with all my heart that by his
[1:44:36] help and by His grace grace I will pray
[1:44:38] I pray that I'll seek daily without
[1:44:41] ceasing until I feel every one of those
[1:44:44] little requirements flying in this
[1:44:45] little old stature of mine until I
[1:44:47] became till I can be a manifestation of
[1:44:49] the Living Christ for he became son like
[1:44:52] me that I might become the righteousness
[1:44:54] of God like him he took my place Lord
[1:44:57] let me take his now because that's the
[1:44:59] purpose he died for how many will pledge
[1:45:01] that same thing by the grace of God with
[1:45:03] their hearts bound now and their hands
[1:45:05] up I pledge it Lord Jesus our Lord this
[1:45:08] church pledges at the full stature of
[1:45:10] Jesus Christ so he's saying when you go
[1:45:13] to the negotiating table
[1:45:14] you want the whole lot don't budge on
[1:45:16] getting the whole lot everything any
[1:45:19] promise in the Word of God this for you
[1:45:21] any anything that's a general promise
[1:45:23] anything that's for you anything don't
[1:45:25] let Satan negotiate you out of a little
[1:45:27] portion of that you want the whole lot
[1:45:28] you
[1:45:29] total negative gain total negative gain
[1:45:32] he comes out losing every time and you
[1:45:34] know what who cares you're unhappy
[1:45:36] because that's not my I don't have to
[1:45:39] keep you happy I wanted you to have
[1:45:41] total negative gain and I believe that's
[1:45:43] what Caleb said Caleb had a promise this
[1:45:47] was his and years and years went by but
[1:45:49] Caleb said look I received a promise
[1:45:51] years ago and I'm gonna go and get it
[1:45:54] that was that was my promise even though
[1:45:57] I'm old now God's gonna give it to me
[1:45:58] I'm gonna go and take what's mine it's
[1:46:00] my inheritance um they're gonna be
[1:46:01] negotiated out of it
[1:46:02] it's all mine I'm gonna go and get the
[1:46:04] whole lot the whole pie
[1:46:05] I want everything there's people here
[1:46:06] that want the land is theirs guys living
[1:46:08] on the mountain that wants it now I'll
[1:46:09] tell you what it's mine
[1:46:10] you're gonna leave it's mine that was
[1:46:12] that says negotiations will go now I've
[1:46:16] got one last one this is quite short and
[1:46:17] then then we'll and then I'm about to
[1:46:19] close collaborative negotiations is the
[1:46:22] last one now collaborative negotiations
[1:46:26] creative and friendly for example
[1:46:29] business partnership negotiations are
[1:46:30] often collaborative when when
[1:46:32] negotiations that are expected to yield
[1:46:33] big ones tend to be collaborative that's
[1:46:35] when you collaborate together you work
[1:46:36] together work together to to achieve
[1:46:41] more than what you currently have now
[1:46:42] and you're you've got no animosity with
[1:46:45] the other party because you're now
[1:46:46] you're just working and you want to like
[1:46:48] a fellowship you know we work in with
[1:46:49] brother Ben what's your what's your
[1:46:50] desire what's the Lord laid on your
[1:46:52] heart we want to help where we can we
[1:46:53] want to support you know we we work
[1:46:54] together
[1:46:55] we're not scrapping over this we want we
[1:46:57] want it to grow so that we all benefit
[1:46:59] you know we want a nice fellowship to
[1:47:00] grow and everything like that right now
[1:47:02] but this is an interesting one you know
[1:47:04] because NER and the way that we
[1:47:06] understand it was the Lord we're not the
[1:47:07] sort of people that we don't go and
[1:47:08] force the promises of God if I could put
[1:47:12] it in the correct way to happen and our
[1:47:15] life outside of what he would want
[1:47:20] you understand like when you know the
[1:47:24] Lord you know I can't just walk in and
[1:47:25] pretend that I haven't got a
[1:47:26] relationship or don't say Lord I want
[1:47:27] this and listen us because we know him
[1:47:30] we say Lord you know my situation we
[1:47:32] talk the understand well when you know
[1:47:36] him you're not pushy and - trying to get
[1:47:40] from him what you want you know you deal
[1:47:41] with Satan and
[1:47:43] pushy manner right so this is the way
[1:47:44] it's going to be that but I wouldn't
[1:47:46] know maybe that's my approach but I
[1:47:48] wouldn't walk to God and said this is
[1:47:49] the way it's going to be you understand
[1:47:51] we have a different approach therefore
[1:47:54] when we when we do our initial
[1:47:56] negotiations in negotiate negotiate we
[1:47:58] negotiate our way out of death and hell
[1:48:00] we're happy so we're not going to keep
[1:48:03] going back and I'll give me this give me
[1:48:04] that I want all this you know but yet we
[1:48:09] didn't start to negotiate with God as in
[1:48:11] our walk with the Lord as the as the
[1:48:13] years go on we negotiate we're both at
[1:48:17] the same table but we're not going to
[1:48:18] say what I want this I'm sick of having
[1:48:20] to go to church on Sunday I want to be
[1:48:21] able to go out and do my thing yeah we
[1:48:23] it's different but I hit this idea his
[1:48:26] description that Psalm 37 it says
[1:48:28] delight thyself also in the Lord and he
[1:48:30] shall give thee the desires of thine
[1:48:32] heart now you think about this every
[1:48:37] time you when you feel a bit tired but
[1:48:40] you think what I'm gonna go to church
[1:48:41] anyway because I love you want to serve

[1:49:04] with God starts negotiating the deepest
[1:49:07] thing you have in your heart that you
[1:49:08] want you don't know you're doing it if
[1:49:10] you look back on your life and thought
[1:49:11] well I've been look what I've got now
[1:49:12] didn't even really ask for it but look
[1:49:14] I've always wanted this and well I've
[1:49:16] actually got it and I didn't even go and
[1:49:18] ask for it you did the desire of your
[1:49:20] heart was negotiating with God as you
[1:49:22] were but you you're not busy trying to
[1:49:24] pursue that you're busy serving God and
[1:49:26] delighting yourself and home but as you
[1:49:28] do that the desire of your heart is
