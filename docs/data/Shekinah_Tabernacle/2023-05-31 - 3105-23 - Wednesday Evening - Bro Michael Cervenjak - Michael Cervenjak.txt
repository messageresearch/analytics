together praise God so it's great to be here tonight amen it's great to have our brother Michael Cervin Jack from Melbourne here we met him uh 13 years ago I think it was down in Christchurch and haven't been in touch at all but it's been great to spend a few days together and have some real good fellowship and I believe running for a real treat tonight remember God knows everything about our lives sometimes we think does God know us does he care does he understand what we're going through he knows everything and I believe he can take a brother from Melbourne who doesn't know anything about us and he can speak directly to our lives from the end from the start to the end of the service and meet every need I believe he can do that amen because the word is still a discerner the thoughts and tense of the hearts it means let's just say Lord amen we serve the same Lord Jesus the Same Lord Jesus in Melbourne the same Lord Jesus here in Stokes Valley and you know it's this wonderful bride of Christ around the world so let's just let's just enter in tonight and say Lord you can do the supernatural incredible film we can imagine tonight amen so amen let's just sing that um magnify the Lord with me just the courses brother Michael come but yeah God bless you amen magnify [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise the Lord God bless you it's good to be here after a long long time some 40 years since I walked down the streets of Wellington it doesn't make thank you sisters we'll just finish with the music for now that doesn't make me old it just means I started when I was very young it's uh good good group of musicians and of course Wednesday night those that love the Lord usually come on Wednesday night amen those who love the church come on Sunday morning so we want to be where he's amen he's worthy to be praised I hope you'll uh get to pick up my English accent uh sorry Australian accent we all speak English but uh I won't hold you too long but I do want the Lord to move tonight amen amen and you know ministers come and they usually say well if the Lord touches one heart we'll be blessed well I'm a little bit more greedy than that I'm not so humbled to say Lord touch my brother there and all the other 99 go home and get nothing I believe the Lord has something for each one of us tonight amen as I said it's certainly glad I'm glad to be here with brother Ben who um just about the whole world knows for his youth came so praise the Lord for that that's good you're doing such a good thing and just continue because it's a blessing to the people of God Amen and also I hear that you have Fellowship on Wednesday before the service then on Sunday these are some original things that you do do which perhaps are different than some other people do just continue anything you can do any excuse you can do to have Fellowship that's just wonderful amen and um especially Wednesday night children need to go to school the next day and so forth and you know it's the middle of the week it's what we call the hump of the week but uh as good time as any nice and warm cold windy outside we're here praising the Lord why not it's a good place to be in amen whenever we come to God's house friends there is always something good that can happen and thus happen amen and if you draw on the word not so much on me as I said tonight I'll just maybe share a little bit I didn't want to get into a perhaps the subject and really preach but uh just to get to know you because I believe we have two common things we have the same enemy who respects no borders no visas he doesn't need a visa to come to New Zealand or back to Australia or to South Africa but we have the same Lord and that's the one I'm more we have the same Lord as in our brother said we have a same message that binds us together we have never seen most of you yes some of you I have seen in the last few days some of you I have known uh Sister Christine there from her father and her mother that the main thing is that the Lord is the one who makes a difference friends it's to know him is life eternal see some friends and so forth so I just believe we've come to a good place you know it's very hard when you come for the first time just to get right into it and start preaching and expect everybody just to respond you know in a phenomenal way but uh oh I like this violin no it's not a violin I thought why they reduce the well your island is a little bit smaller than Australia isn't it but uh we've come here with one purpose I believe you know and if we've come with the right attitude yeah he will never disappoint us amen amen it will never let us down you know when that woman came in the Press of hundreds of people thousands of people Milling around the Lord I still didn't even get to the introduction but I'll get there she only had one thing in her mind she had a need actually one who hide it she spent all the money on the Physicians and they couldn't help her but she said if I can but only Touch the Hem of His Garment and friends you know what I believe that there'll a lot went behind the scene the disciples didn't see the others didn't recognize what was happening but I believe our Lord sent a couple of angels down Gabriel and Michael maybe and so listen just make a bit of room so she can get there and friends she got there and she got her made met he's the same today I believe whatever you need is regardless of the words that I may speak if he's the same which he is then he can meet all of our needs here all of us I see some young teenagers there coming to church on Wednesday that's very good see some younger ones you know school children that's very good I see some older ones I see some that are a little bit tired from work today that have come to God's house that's also good amen amen we've come to the right place friends he will never disappoint us he is a good God we sing about it we praise him and so forth but he's a good god well I think brother Ben for allowing me to come as I said he knows some of my children and many of our young people we always try to encourage to encourage to come to your October Camp as I said which has become an international thing and they always get a blessing they say they've just got a nice group of people there but friends it's the law that makes a difference whether it's at the camp whether it's on Wednesday night amen so may the Lord just speak to us I have a little uh Rosebud for our brother you know a lot of people brother Branham told us to give person a rosebud while they're still alive than to get a great big wreath on their funeral casket and put it on the coffin and say this is from family such and such too late let's rather be kind to one another while we still together amen and I just thought I'll give a little uh poem now of course this well I'll read it and then you decide whether it applies to you or not all right but this is what it says never satisfied if the pastor is Young which is they say that he lacks experience if his hair is gray then he's too old for the Youth if he has four children then he has far too many yeah if he does not have any then he's a bad example if he preaches from notes his sermons are dry and very conservative if his messages are not prepared then his topic is insufficiently profound if he cares for the poor in the church it's only a pretense if he turns his attention to the wealthy then he is appeasing to them if he uses too many illustrations he disregards the Bible but if he does not illustrate then he's preaching is not sufficiently coherent if he condemns the evil he has no confidence if he does not cry against sin then he's trying to compromise not an easy job if he preaches the truth he's overly contentious if he does not declare God's complete counsel then he's a hypocrite if he's unsuccessful in pleasing everybody he is offending the church and should retreat if he makes them all satisfied then there is no compunction if he drives an old car it is a reproach for the assembly if he purchases a new one then he's prone to secular values yeah if he alone preaches all the time people get bored listening to the same preacher if he invites preachers as guests then he's neglecting his pastoral Duty if he's well paid he's inclined just for the income if he's paid if his pay is low then they say that it's a proof that he isn't worth much anyway therefore my friends and my brother if you think that he is justly Accused come and walk in his shoes and try to please people who are never satisfied I wish you a lot of success and hope you have found yourself in my story why I read that frenzy is that you need to appreciate your pastor you need to support him you need to pray for him secretly and privately it's not an easy job I tell you what I would rather be the president of the United States than sometimes be a pastor of a church yeah but it's the it's God who gives the Ministries it's God who gives the gift gifts to the people and if it's used according to his word then the pastor can bless you it can be a blessing to all of you individually and collectively of course and then the work of the Lord can progress amen so careful never speak against the pastor brother Branham told us amen so I just want to um mention maybe one more thing for young people listen I always appreciate young people in a church because they are the office bearers of tomorrow if there is a tomorrow that was spoken to me 40 years ago brother Michael you are young you know just serve the Lord with all your heart because if there is a tomorrow you need to perhaps have an office and and do some of the duties that you can do for the Lord well friends I didn't think that 40 years later I would come back to New Zealand and see many of you that I have never seen before but what I'm saying is a generationist past in that generation if I quickly do a cross-section many of you perhaps weren't even born in in 1983 well many of you were but some of you weren't but you know what we had four giants that I met that year in Gisborne brother Perry green is gone brother Roger maybe they're just names to you he's gone brother Harold hildebrain from Canada Edmonton he's passed on brother Reginald Searle many of you know by name or have met him or so forth he's gone on Friends four Giants have moved on of this message but there's got to be others to take that place and I thank God that brother Benny's one of those a young giant but becoming one amen we heard some of his preaching and so forth and it's just a blessing so anyway let's just read this for the young people because we need our young people it says a quote to remember you've heard it before it's look friends let me just get this out of the way there is really nothing new that I could deliver to you and if I did I'm sure brother Ben would have something to say so I'm not here to bring you something new I'm just here to remind you I'm here to encourage you as a visiting minister to to tell you that you can move on you can have the victory you can be victorious in the Lord Jesus Christ today just as the world seems to be going down the gurgler France we're living in a world that has never seen some of the things that we are seeing with our own eyes I myself in my short generation as a Believer 40 odd years I've seen so many changes and I say to myself and my children I wonder what's the next thing that Hollywood is going to come up with is there anything else that they can develop you know there is hell is being expressed on this Earth devil is slowly trying to see how far he can push his people he's subjects but thank God that we can see the light frames thank God that we're not part of that group that is just following like blind sheep but God has given us the light amen and with that light we can overcome but it's it's serious the the the world has become insane insane brother Brandon preached the letting of the pressure and he said you know it's the world will become insane well back in the 60s there was still some sort of sanity but I tell you what today our dare say it would be pretty hard to find a bit of Sanity out on the streets and amongst the people that's how far it's gone friends cannot go any further well possibly a little bit more until the Lord calls her to a halt yeah amen when he calls to a hold they say listen let's have peace in this world let's have United Nations let's really get something going friends they there can be no peace on this Earth until the Prince of Peace comes and we join him as his bride in the Millennium amen amen so keep looking up don't allow the things of the world to encapture you and enshrine you there is a better way and I want to encourage our young people and then we'll get to the word it says a quote to remember sin will take you further than you want to go slowly but surely taking control sin will give you short-term pleasure but long-term pain sin will keep you longer than you want to stay and sin will cost you far more than you ever want to pay that's not just for young people that's for all of us amen so may the Lord truly help us not to be bound by any things of this world Amen amen but just line it up with the word see where it fits and say Lord with your grace I am bound more than ever before to make it through I'm not stopping here this how this Earth is not my home this world is not my home I'm just a passing through amen my treasures are light up somewhere beyond the blue I believe that's our expectation that's what we're looking forward amen so friends um young people always look after young people any church that loses the young people it's not a healthy Church yes my wife and I just recently sat down and I said darling let's just see how many of our young people are not coming to our church we haven't got a big church but over the years we've had people come and go like you have had and to our surprise we came up with about 70 people young people that are still around in the world somewhere but are not coming and serving the lord and I said that's quite a shock over these years they could be there a part of the assembly uh serving the lord loving the Lord being an example and so forth but the devil has managed to deceive them friends and we live we live in an age of deception as we're going to see later on brother Brown preached a sermon to deceived Church there's nothing more powerful today than the deception that the enemy is using on his subject and you know when you get these scams I think you have them here in New Zealand like we have them back home what is that that's a deception yeah in the natural that is a Deception comes on your phone comes on your computer comes in your emails or whatever it is a form of deception friends the devil is just trying to use every means to deceive his people but thank God that God's people will not be deceived amen amen praise the lord well you know as I said as a visiting preacher I thought he was appropriate just to uh uh encourage you because we all need encouragement once in a while is that right none of us are so immune from the things of this world that we can say brother Michael I'm walking this road with my Lord I'm so close with him that nothing of this world troubles me sooner or later we all get uh uh pested or trouble a little bit by the things of the world and if we're not careful they can actually become part of us this is what we're going to talk about tonight is there a spot in your heart it's pot in your heart I'll you'll understand by the time I get to the end all right but friends that encouragement we need once in a while I'll just give you one example just to free you up a little bit to show you that I'm not a a starchy Presbyterian preacher um I think it's a true story but you know how the preachers are they hear one story they get it from someone else and they borrow they add a little bit and brother Ben hears it then later on he forgets a little bit he adds a bit of his own it's still a true story friends no no we're all subject to a brother I'll tell you what if my wife was here she said Michael you've taken three stories and put them into one she said you added a little bit you have exaggerated darling but it's not intentional yeah you know we are humans and a different atmosphere we react differently anyway the pastor's wife so very good I tell you they have a special Ministry it's not one of the gifts in Corinthians 14 but it's somewhere there keep an eye on him so what happened is this young this person uh he he lived in a certain place and his work was on the other I'll assume this is the no that's not that's a bad example the cemetery was here and his house was here and his job was here and every day when he finished work he would just pack up and just come through the cemetery and come home as quickly as he could to see his wife and his children and once he was working a little bit late at his job I call it over time without pay so he worked a bit longer he was getting a bit dark and he said to himself I really want to get home quickly he won't go his usual way which he knew you know pretty much off by heart he said he'll take a shortcut and as he's taking Ashoka watch those shortcuts friends yeah I'm glad there's no Shortcuts To Heaven amen there's only one way and Jesus is that way anyway so he said I'll just take a shortcut so as he takes the shortcut he goes through a different part of the cemetery and as he's walking he falls into an open grave just Falls in it didn't hurt himself sort of gets up and he says to himself oh I'm just get up and go home so he tries to get up and every because it was a fresh grave every child every time he grabbed the edge of the Grave the soil crumbled in so he tried a few times he'd tried a few times he screamed of course to the gravedigger but he was gone so there was no one around so he tried a few times and every time he did the soil crumbled in he said well I have another option except to realize that I've got to stay here all night sit on this coffin that was under him sit in the corner and in the morning the gravedigger will come and he'll get out so he he was happy with that that was his only option then as he was sitting there in the corner he comes another man but this man was a bit more chirpy brother he was a little bit more filled with something some sort of liquid that makes you a little bit sort of happy and chirpy and you know not water of course so he was singing to himself you know coming along and here he comes and he comes over the grave and he falls in this other man and this man is in the corner and he sees there's a man here on on the other corner here fell down on the coffin so this drunk he was drunken he was drunk so he starts I'll tell you what I think he's sobered up very quickly but uh he he says oh oh he says how I'm going to get out of this so he tries to jump up any same problem the soil crumbles and he can't do it some of you already know what's going to happen look at that and uh he tries a few times he tries he tries and he can't just had enough I just can't get out he says to himself and as he's just about had enough he hears a voice from the other side of the grave he said friend don't try there's no use trying I couldn't get out and neither can you you know what friends he sobered up he jumped up he jumped over the grave got outside and I'll tell you what he was sober going home after that so what I'm saying is we need sometimes a bit of a nudge a bit of a push even in in this story we can learn something you know the the power that it didn't have somehow you found it within himself and she jumped over the grave and I'll tell you what he was running home he thought that the deceased person was talking so so may the Lord help us to uh just get a little bit you know from him today and say Lord thank you for speaking to me amen well you receive that one nicely I'll just give you one more and then we'll certainly get into it look I do believe that this is not a place for joking but sometimes an example does more than perhaps many words that I could say all right and uh may it just help you and you know like brother Branham in his sermons when he goes to a new place he usually gives one or two stories or examples you know let's sort of people calm down a little bit accept him and so forth and then he preaches the word amen there was another example where you know sometimes these pushers are good there was a rancher in America who was very very rich and he had a pool party a barbecue we'll call it all right around the pool and he put a reward and he said he had a swimming pool in his backyard and he filled it with crocodiles alligators piranhas and all you know those fish that are not very nice to us and so it was the whole swimming pool was full of these fish and um the reward was he was very rich and he said look whoever can swim through that pool without getting bitten or eaten by The Animals uh we'll either get a million dollars a thousand acres of land or they can have his daughter in marriage so people were Milling about you know looking at it it's not worth the risk you know what's the point of trying to go there and be bitten or eaten or maimed for the rest of my life for the sake of a million dollars most of us also would say no thank you but as people were Milling about on the edge of the pool we there was a sudden splash splashing the water and everybody's turned around and they followed what happened there they saw this man in the Water swimming for all with all his might for for his life and he was swimming and you know dodging the animals and and sweating is not the word when you're in water I suppose it's all wet but it's a matter of life or death so he was swimming swimming zigzagging and he finally made it to the other side of the pool and the owner came the Rancher came and he said young man can't believe it that you made it I didn't think anyone could swim through all these animals here but since you did which of the three rewards they want to take he wipes his bra from the water and he says sir I'm not after a reward I just want to know the name of the person who pushed me in yeah friends it might be in your life that you feel like you've got crocodiles and alligators and everything around you but friends God will see us through amen amen let's stand to our feet as we just open to a couple of verses and try to get you out before nine I heard there was a clock here but I can't see it oh it's coming up tomorrow wow I'm a day early all right well I better preach till tomorrow brother all right let's open to Second Peter second Peter just as I said I thought I had other um thoughts on my mind but you know how it is you just want to share something that you believe the Lord's placed on your heart that can be a blessing for the local Fellowship in here in New Zealand amen so second Peter 3 let's just read a couple of verses there we're talking about our subject today is is there a spot in your heart now I haven't come to criticize I haven't come to correct you but I have come simply to preach the word and because we have come to the house of correction then it's God who needs to speak to us amen amen so let's have a look at second Peter three verse 11. seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved things that are around us what mineral persons ought you to be in all your holy conversation and godliness that word conversation life it means your life everyday life looking for and Hasting unto the coming of the the day of the Lord God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent Heat one press and the bomb might do that but it's not time yet friends because we are here amen wherefore beloved seeing that you look for look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace with air spots and blameless amen let's just turn to our author Lord Jesus we thank you for these words Lord I pray for the inspiration thereof Lord may you speak to every heart from the youngest to the oldest Lord we all need a touch from you Lord none of us can walk out he's saying that we just don't need another touch but Lord I believe you have a touch for your people here tonight I believe you can speak to us in such a way that we can have the victory law that we can you can deal with our hearts Lord and cleanse us from every spot that we truly would be holy in all of our conversation and in all of and in all our lives thank you for this opportunity bless the local assembly I pray in Jesus name amen you may be seated and God bless you well friends needless to say we are living as I said in the beginning in a very very upside down world it's a world that we don't want to live in it's a world that's certainly my parents and my grandparents would have never wanted to live in they lived in a lot more different world than what it is in 2023 and uh as I said this is this Insanity everywhere and the only problem is there is more of those that are insane than of us who are sane now I'm not putting people down I'm just being honest you just need to walk down the street and and and and just uh uh push in in front of a car my they take out a knock an ax or a baseball bat and you're in trouble if that's not insanity Prince you road rage is just such an awful it's almost the pandemic in this age you hear of I don't know if it's in your country like ours but people were killed for the sake of just pushing in or or not giving a blinker indicator and they moved in front and it's happened it's happening all the time in America especially you know what's feeding it Hollywood movies but anyway that's by the way anyway so friends it's not the world we want to live in amen there is another Spirit that's coming and I'm talking about not just people's ideas but I'm talking about spirits that are actually ruling and controlling people there's another Spirit that's come very strongly in Australia and as I said I believe it's here too because it respects no borders is this and it's a very nice term but a very nasty term what's behind it is what we call political political correctness if it's not politically correct you know this and all you can be in trouble they can you can they can throw you in prison they can you know do all sorts of things to you you've got to you know political correctness has gone to its limits you all you know you've got to ask a person sorry are you a he or a she or how should I address you address you friends that is insanity but that's what our children our young boys and girls that are going to school are exposed with and grappling with they may not know what it is but you and I know we know that there's those uh Devils that were tied up in the river Euphrates that have been released in this end time to bombard God's people and come against God's people and also look the devil is not smart at all he's got his people and he makes it so hard he's a very awful taskmasket to be under his control so he's got all these people in his uh torturing with all these spirits that are released and you know they call it politically correct and so forth France are the only book that I know that is politically correct is the Bible hey amen and as we're going on as we're going on they are trying to take this away from us they're doing a Bible now so if you know this or not or what religion you are but Pope has commanded or ordered that they should do a Bible that is neutral that is uh neutral in terms of God that anything that is repeated in the Bible you know more than once it should be done away with so they're going to take the 66 books that we beloved a love and believe there are sent from God for us and turning into a small little handbook and called I'm not even going to call it the Bible it's just a book but friends they're working on it seriously very soon it'll be out there'll be no God in in masculine gender he and the Bible says he is our God I'm sorry you know God created it that way God created he and she amen but today they're just trying to they don't know what they're trying to do but there's one thing they're trying to do if they can get this book out of our hands for instance especially the King James version because all the other versions have been tampered with you take a seed and you cut it and you put it in the ground it won't grow I got a pamphlet some time ago to send to my house and it says kurong Bookshop I think you might have it here too so I said oh let me see if I maybe I need to buy a new Bible listen to me 39 versions of the Bible not one was King James you think the devil is not attacking this book sure is all the other versions are wrong I'm not saying you can read it and refer to it but I'm saying that while this book was used as amongst the English-speaking people as the Bible there were revivals 65-66 there were revivals the moment they introduced The New American version and the new standard version and the New Jerusalem version and all and many many other versions friends they you know what the devil wants he wants to attack that word sure we haven't got persecution worldwide as yet but if he can take this word out of the hands of the people friends we are powers we need every word that's here I'm not so fanatical if you want to read a new King James version but that's got 200 mistakes others have hundreds and thousands and you know what are some of the main things that he has done he's taken away the blood of Jesus he's taken away the name of Jesus that's right acts 8 I can show to you it's all there I've got a painful that exactly Compares all the inter uh translations with this King James now I didn't come here to sell your King James Bible but I came to tell you to show you how that the world we live in if they can attack this word friends if they can downplay its Authority if they can change the name of God and call it a neutral name or something which is coming out so you for young people don't you touch that Bible when you go to the Bookshop don't even look at it it's not for you it'll come out soon and it'll be called the new Bible that'll be the acceptable standard friends thank God that we know what we are holding in our hands but I'm just showing you that that the devil is so fly you see many of you don't know but all the other interpretations of the Bible have Jesuit priests behind it and and and and changing it progressively the devil doesn't come and say oh get rid of this Bible and we'll give you uh some new version he progressively changes the words friends he progressively dilutes it he progressively takes the name of Jesus he progressively takes the blood of Jesus and many other things I mean if I started telling you here we would be here till tomorrow and you'll be surprised and you'll say listen I don't want any of those yeah it's all right children it's probably about 30 40 words that you need to learn from Old English and you've got it it's not so hard right I'm sure it's not so hard my but I'm giving you an example that we are living in a world that the devil is acting and uh so you know such a Sly manner yeah and unless we are spiritually alert unless our eyes are spiritually open friends we will fall in for it amen and that's why I believe God has sent the message in the same time to alert us to keep us away to tell us that the devil is a soil Fox amen and we need to keep away so this political correctness has gone mad I think your ex-prime minister was asked can you define a woman and one of ours was actually or this current one I think he couldn't do it ridiculous brother absolutely ridiculous it's it's it's it's putrid and you get your children and my children and my grandchildren I will be exposed to that that's why they need the cover of the word and that's why they need to come to church that's why they need a Godly home listen the raising of children starts in your home not in school friends you teach him reading and arithmetic at home before they go to school yeah you prepare them as my granddaughter came the other day to her grandmother and asked a certain question and she explained it a proper way friends you give the right education to your children at home then you're going to prove bulletproof them so they won't be affected by the spirits that are in school not just amongst their peers their students but the teachers teachers don't know what they believe they don't know what they can say they don't know what's right they're all just everybody's just well well it's just the way it is well we've got to accept it no you don't have to accept it no friends we don't have to accept it young boys and girls you don't have to accept them when someone at school tells you something is different than what you learned at Sunday school so listen I'm not sure about that but I'm going home and I'll ask my mother and my father that's the attitude you should have children and I will help you listen if anyone is going to tell you the truth it'll be your mum and your dad not your teacher as good as she might be or he might be not your friend at school but it's your mother and your father in fact you'll hear some good things in church too especially in this church where the word is preached amen that's the protection we need to put around our children friends what is the point if we gain the whole world and lose our children to the world to this evil satanic World in which we live so political correctness Now it only happened yesterday again I'm not here to preach uh news of the world but we the scripture says that we need to have our eyes open yeah we need to look at the current events that are happening and place it in the word place it in the message and say this is really happening many things that brother Branham prophesied back in the 50s and the 60s we thought perhaps would never happen they're happening they're being fulfilled yeah yeah they just found that off the shore of California the two plates that have this certain oil or liquid whatever it is that's between them that keeps the place from rubbing each other and then exploding or lifting up it's they just found out that there was a a lot of a lot of steam and a lot of something coming out from the ocean floor off the coast of California off not far from Los Angeles how far maybe I don't know if you maybe 50 or 100 kilometers it doesn't matter it's not far but friends it's she's honeycombed underneath it's preparing for a big one and people are just sitting you know by and saying oh well what will happen will happen but let's be ready let's be prepared let's not be called unawares amen let's not be off guard because as I said even through the the way they are introducing to us the new Bibles and everything else it is all a ploy of the enemy to dilute the word of God and friends what I was trying to say in the 1960s and so forth the moment they started playing around with this word and bringing in all those other uh new standard American translation and new uh version and so forth you know what happened follow it Revival stopped brother Ben do some work on them tell me where is our TL Osmond and Oral Roberts it's gone their sons come and they just have a few hundred people and that's about it there's something about it because you see when you take away the word of God from the people God cannot work the way he wants to work let me tell you another one this is not in my notes but it's in the Bible the boy let's turn to it because I think this is one that New Zealand uh is attacked by this and so is of course in Australia and all over the world actually you know where it comes from it comes from Hollywood again comes from Hollywood listen to this let's turn to Sam 139 well at least you'll remember this amen amen Sam and your children too you need to have it written down somewhere Psalm 139 verse 20. listen to what it says for they speak against the wickedly people and thine or your enemies take your name in vain what do you have little girls in every girly film oh my God they use that name so freely and so often anybody that's talking on the phone and something's gone wrong OMG I want to mention it because it's not for us to mention friends but that is using the lord's name in vain here it says that the enemies take your name in vain that has become the catch word or if any phone conversation anybody's saving they're constantly using it you know who's using it Indians Muslims Christians everybody yeah and the scripture says Ten Commandments there shall not use the name of the Lord thy God in vain so that has become the catch word in in Hollywood and the devil sort of slip that in through some of the movies there and and so forth and it's become acceptable who speaks against the brother Well everybody's using it I've even caught some Believers starting to use it watch it that is that you should not use that not in that way when we worship God and we praise him and we talk about him sure lift up the name of Jehovah amen but do not use it in a vain profane manner watch it you've got to work tomorrow wherever and you'll see how it's used everywhere hey you know it's just bad it's really bad that's all I can say so all those things are happening in America just yesterday Target one of the department stores has lost 10 billion dollars because they did not want to promote some of the girls clothing that has come in in 10 days they have lost 10 billion dollars because they made a stand but friends no one last they'll have to bow into it and accept it they didn't want to Market this certain clothing I don't want to mention it it you know they just felt it wasn't for them to Market it and they just pulled away from it and they lost 10 billion dollars in 10 days you talk about financial pressure you talk about uh you know Target if you don't want to go our way and you don't want to promote this clothing that we have here yeah you're 10 billion dollars poorer and then they just won't even go bankrupt but good on them took a stain amen and I think every believer should friends let's make a stand it's all right if it costs us a little bit the Lord will make it up amen amen and I said I don't want to talk much about it but so forth so this world system is not only corrupt rather Brandon said uh flashing red lights of his coming friends those flashing red lights from 1960 to 2023 are a lot stronger a lot more persistent a lot more reoccurring these volcanoes these these earthquakes these uh tornadoes in America and in other parts of the world which they never had but it's all happening because the scripture says so that in the end times they'll be shaking and the Bible says and everything that can be shaken shall be shaken friends but praise God that if we have the word of God in us we will not be shaken amen we can watch what's happening and we say well that's just the Fulfillment of scripture amen amen I stand on the scripture I'm not going to be shaken by these things friends but everything the scripture says that can be shaken shall be shaken yes it's happening thank you thank you it's happening but thank God for our little bride right here in this little house this room here that gathers on Wednesdays and Sundays that is not shaken by the things that are happening in the world Amen in fact it's just fulfilling scripture so all we do is say Lord that's fulfilling your word look friends don't get me wrong we are not rejoicing when people die yeah I don't like a single person to die amen I don't honestly I have a natural feeling towards people but I don't want to see anyone even hurt if I see blood I run away from it I can't take it just as well I'm not a nurse or a doctor you see but I can't but the reality is it's happening thousands by thousands of dying and so forth and it's all fulfilling the scripture how glad and thankful we need to be for the for God's word amen amen Now quickly because we're living in this age the type that we have in the Old Testament in Exodus 12 you all know it so I won't just refer to it I won't read it it says that at the time of the Passover at the time of their Deliverance which is our going home amen which is our Rapture that's the only thing brother random say that we're waiting for now is the rapture of the church 60 years ago brother but it's still as fresh today we still believe it and if there's another tomorrow and there's another 10 15 years brother Ben keep on preaching it because the Lord is still coming oh I gotta go you know what I said my brother-in-law just came back from Belgium and I said brother how are things there he said not very good I said why what's happening he said they have come up with new laws that there's only two churches a state church and if you're not a state Church you'll be persecuted and if you are in the state church just do churches Universal Church they call it maybe that's another name for Catholic church but anyway that's what they call it and you know what if you're a minister of that church you have to sign certain papers that you will only preach what they tell you to preach and if a single one of your members uh reports you and says listen we don't like what Michael is speaking and talking they can just do away with you in no time now listen to this brother they have to sign a notice of memorandum which just means a sheet of paper with some things on it to say that the Rapture of the church will not take place absolutely the very yes very last my brother-in-lawing I wish I had it here he said they have to sign that's agreed as in the country of Belgium that the Rapture of the church is no longer applicable and it's not going to happen the next event to happen is the great white Throne judgment friends that's happening right today these days they're just signing them absolutely but you see what the Believers rejoicing and are waiting for they're taking it away you know what they're taking it away because they thought it could happen before it hasn't happened so they're logical human mind tells them well there's no such thing but they're not allowed to preach that the moment they do their license is they're disqualified and and so forth that's happening and as I said it's not called the Catholic church it's called The Universal Church in Belgium anyway I got sidetracked but some information for you all right but these are the spirits these are just not good ideas that are happening or bad ideas in fact but these are spirits that were Unleashed that are really really working on the world today on the population of the world today but we thank God there is a little bride that is hid amen under those shadow of his wings and although they do all their friends that only makes us love this word more and more amen when he said that I said brother but that's the very thing we've been living for that's the very thing we're expecting yes the Rapture might not happen tomorrow but I'm living as if it will and if it doesn't happen tomorrow brother I'll come back in 10 years and I'll tell you the Rapture is still a scriptural teaching amen so God sent the prophet to tell us that there is no Rapture come on come on but that's the blindness that's in the world today yeah this is this is what's happening all around so with all these things happening what should we do pray for our children friends the greatest wealth you and I have I have four children by God's grace and two grandchildren and a third one on the way the greatest thing we have is our Offspring yeah does that matter cars don't matter jobs don't matter Prestige doesn't matter nothing matters but it's our children I believe it's coming home to us to say yes we need to protect them we need to cover them by the plan we need to cover them with our parental praise amen don't try to save all of Wellington get your children in first then once you get them in then yeah perhaps venture out a bit further and not being so facetious now to you but I'm actually telling you the truth the truth in the sermon Souls that are imprisoned now in case you haven't read it for a long time brother Brandon preaches and really says that things are really happening the way the Lord showed me in a vision and right towards the end and I can read it to you now he said Lord please I have Joseph Rebecca and Sarah that need to come in Lord is there still time for them to come in he goes a little bit further and he prays for his children again weeping if I read it to you it's just words but if you hear it on tape you can actually see the emotion he goes a little bit further I have it right here and he said Lord please I hope the time is not over yet I hope that my children can make it yeah friends that's the heart of a prophet that's the heart of a preacher who knew he's God and the value of his family amen that's the priority for me and my house We Shall Serve the Lord amen so pray for your children to be protected so in quickly as we go in Exodus at the Passover these just two things I want you to notice before they did leave Egypt there was a couple interesting things that I had to do you may not like this but it's true they ate the Passover which was a lamb and unleavened bread with bitter herbs brother it's right here Exodus 12. I have it all here you know I'm preaching the word anyway I'm just adding in it it's in there it says eat it with bitter herbs so when you have a roast on Sunday and your mother makes a nice roast and so forth melts through the house let someone put some bitter herbs there you say oh brother Michael that's not the best meal I've got to go back to my macca's friends but it's a type that we have to take the whole word of God and every trial that comes our way even if it's bitter in your life take it ask from the Lord and that will give you strength to go 40 years through the Wilderness and have the victory in the End Amen and you know what they also hated being dressed yeah what does it say and the bride has made herself ready let's put that garment on friends again it's another subject then not only that but they ate it with their shoes on their feet no Barefoot ones going across the Red Sea there brother whose shoes what are shoes the preparation of the Gospel of good of Peace amen the gospel they were ready and then they had a stick brother I had a staff that I had next to them picks it as 12 uh it's 11 yeah it's all there so in other words they were in a state of preparedness yes because they didn't know when the death angel was going to come but when he did come the Passover was ready which is our Lord Jesus Christ amen and they were ready they were dressed prepared they had a stick they had the shoes on and they were just listening perhaps for the cries all around them the angel came and struck the firstborn but those oh oh brother Michael you're only giving us half of the truth I sure am here's the other half there was another thing they had to put the blood on the doorpost on the left-hand side and the right hand side that's the door post of a door and the lintel is the top part of the door France the token had to be applied and you know if the token was applied they were ready the moment the death angel came they just got up and off they went how do you gather without a microphone without a computer without an internet without a mobile phone to send a text Brother Moses two and a half million people two and a half they say two to two and a half brother Brandon refers to one and the other and if you look at it it's 650 000 men plus women plus children so we're talking about two two and a half million people no text brother right no uh multiple broadcasting just one button and it goes to everybody yeah but you know what they had brother they had the word of the Lord amen and they had one voice that spoke with authority told them what to do and if all the two and a half million people listened which they did when the time came when the death angel came through the land they were ready and off they went no need for these modern things brother they were ready because they listened to the voice amen amen and um off they went the blood was sprinkled sorry the blood was applied on the doorpost and the lintel but not on the floor we don't walk over the blood of Jesus Christ and having it there and there it forms a cross that's the token we need to have amen even today amen surprise the Lord so and off they went and uh I won't spend much time there but another thing that's very important let's turn to it Psalm 133 is a local church I just want to encourage you not knowing perhaps when we'll be back again but just to help you stay together friends I Fellowship a little local church that stays together and is in unity in in one spirit and in one mind and in one Accord God can do something amen God can begin to heal the sick amongst them God can begin to bring the prodigals back brother the children that are in the world we're praying we're weeping he's saying Lord bring him back bring him back you be United as a body one by one there'll be a knock on the door and say listen I'm coming home I'm coming home I'm sick of this world I'm coming home too long I've walked and wondered in the world now I'm coming home amen friends and this is the unity that we're talking about listen to this even if I don't get to the other notes who cares Psalm 133 behold means look and watch how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren that means Brethren means brothers and sisters to dwell together in unity so it says first of all it's beautiful for husband another husband wife two years but a church to be in unity just like husband and wife yes watch this it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard right down the beard even Aaron's bead that went down to the skirts of His Garment friends it was something special about this oil it came from the head it came on the face on the bead on his garments and down to his feet yeah yeah a type of the Holy Spirit protecting us hey man hey amen praise the Lord amen that's not all as the Jew the Jew of Herman and as the Jew that descended upon the mountains of Zion for there the Lord commanded the blessing even life forevermore you want to have life have Unity you want to have blessing have unity and when you have Unity you know what the Bible says here when you have Unity you don't have to say Lord give us blessing give us blessing blesses the Bible says that God automatically sends the blessing yeah so if you are united as a body of Christ Acts 2 and they were in one mind and in one Accord and the Holy Spirit came and did the rest if you are united my friends the holy spirit will work as he Wills yes amen you don't have to cry and say brother give me blessing uh the blessing will come from God it says there the Lord commands His blessings you know what the word command means God sees a group of people that are united here he says Holy Spirit Angels whatever pour out the blessing He commands and it says the blessings got to come to this little church in Stokes Valley because they are united you don't have to pray for it and not only is it a blessing but you know whether he gives life yeah don't we all need a bit of Life a bit of life from the Lord amen so be United and you'll see how the Lord will move amongst you as he has listen to this just two quotes here brother Brown says knowing that what we say we mustn't just say because we are gathered together to just haphazardly speak on anything I'm not speaking too about anything listen to this but it's something that will help stabilize stabilize the people friends for we are going to pass through dangerous treacherous Waters we already sailing through them oh yeah and sometimes I guess it's with you as it is with me there seems to be so much of it it's so scary so we need to preach about things that will stabilize the people friends your pastor cannot live your Christian life for you he can pray for you he can help you but you need to go home and live your Christian Life hey then you need to be a witness for the Lord your pastor cannot be at your place or work and and witness and and testify and baptize people there it's your job brother it's your job sister we all have a duty see God has strategically placed Us in different places for that very purpose you know for what purpose that the last seed of God predestinated seed of God may come in and when it it when they do come in Gentiles mercies over and God moves over to Israel so that scripture brother absolutely and there's one other condition before it happens it says that the cup of the Emirates or the enemy will be filled up so the cup of this evil the things that I was talking to at the beginning will be just so full and then the Lord's coming back for us you say brother Michael you're speaking and preaching as if he's coming back tonight well why not amen amen if I didn't I wouldn't be saying these things friends I believe he can come back tonight oh brother Michael Andrew deceived a little bit you know too excited about it no if I know the Lord's coming back tomorrow I'm going to go up on the roof and put my roof up on the house and you who are in living and you've got a lot of gardening places there go and plant your potatoes is that right yeah sure that's the right attitude to have but anyway we got from the blessings there that the Lord commanded his Blessing don't have to pray for our friends He commands it he makes sure that it comes on the people here in quotes uh sorry this is my little book it's see what I've decided and what I heard over the years we as message people we hear so much we hear the tapes we hear the sermons together as a fellowship or whatever and we hear it and we hear it and we hear it and we hear it and we forget and I said Lord this is just not right I've been listening for many years and I forg I forget some of the basic things I'm only limited to how much I can retain things so I got myself a little book called The assimilation book so in other words I hear it I write it down just in my handwriting different quotes but they are there and I look through them every so often I know what sermon they come from and so forth and it has helped me because friends many things that we do here in church brother Ben preaching and other ministers preaching here that we hear on tape we forget let's be honest many of you will walk out of this door tonight and you'll forget what brother Michael was saying except you'll remember those two funny examples is that right I hope it's more than that I hope I didn't come all the way from Australia just to tell you that here and that's what we come to church for okay why do we come to church for is to find out where Our Faults Are you don't believe in church attendance I think you've got three beautiful faults you better come to to church you'll find out where your faults are I'm not scared Lord let brother Ben preach you like to clean preach and these are things in my life which will be referring to a spotting on My Heart Lord I want that removed I don't understand before the Lord and the Lord says Michael why don't you deal with this this and this but now is the time to deal with the friends we come to the house of correction for God to speak to us hey man and listen to me and when he does speak to you to us do something yeah yeah what I've spoken thus far maybe I've spoken to this brother in a certain thing this sister in another way this is in another way and on and on but friends we all have something that we need the law to deal with us it says we come to church to find out where our faults are and the things that we might better ourselves by if we come to church for any other reason objective rather then this I'm afraid we won't get too much out of it you come out of routine you come out of habit you come because your mum and dad tells you've got to come you're coming because it's a Sunday morning and you're honoring the resurrection good but not why you should come to church see that's why I'm calling it a book of a simulation I have it here and I'm looking at it and say Lord am I coming to church with the right motive are going to church we must come to find our weaknesses find our bad places see how little we are and put our trust in somebody that's strong perfect strength by Perfect weakness amen well since you like that one you'll like the next one from perfect strength and today we know that we need a Revival we know we need a stirring amongst the people so don't tell me it's over don't tell me there's no point preaching in Wellington and telling others France God still has these little Remnant that needs to come in if it's no one else it's my two sons that are in the world are the two are praising the Lord and saving the Lord but I've got two that are not and if we pray for them every day so much so that we talk about it that the one boy that I haven't seen for eight years because he walked out on us I just by talking we have dreams I have dreams and I dream that I'm talking to him that he's coming home and so forth I'm actually expecting it amen I'm actually speaking it into existence why not use the spoken word for that too brother hey man don't you use it to to say something negative about your brother use it for the Salvation of your family amen come on that's right and when the bride becomes mature enough that spoken word will come into operation won't that be wonderful brother yeah amen we need a friends we need it but that's the unity and that's why we come to church okay we're just going to leave it there I'll just touch on a couple more things and I can't see a clock but I assume you're still all looking at me none of you are tired none of you are sleeping that's a sign for me to go on is that right brother amen Amen brother Phil had a hard day perhaps today with his uh Refrigeration mechanic work and so forth and he still come here to to Worship the Lord that's great amen now our spiritual life our personal walk with the Lord is very very crucial friends you can come to church be the best one in the church you can sing you can praise the Lord you can lift up your hands oh my that person is really really good friends hair is your personal walk with the Lord because that's what matters you see there's an example that they gave us once they said that there was a house fire and in that house fire there was some certain Plastics and other materials and the thing was so pungent I think you know what the word pungent is it's an English word it's an Australian word it was so thinking young children that when they walked into the house everything stunk on this particular plastic I don't know if any of you know but when you burn some plastic oh it can stink for days I've tried to do some cooking brother and I put things in the pot and I forget about it I come back the whole house thinks my wife is in the car she's walking through the front door she said Michael have you been trying to cook and you made a mess I said yeah I suppose so how do you know well she said I can smell it friends this house stunk so much from this thing that burnt in the house oh praise God here it is but there was one article that did not smell from that awful smell and that was a jar that had a lid on it don't you be a jar without the lid for the Lord Brother you make sure when he feels you that he really closes you up hey man puts your hand and puts it puts us in his Shekinah Glory puts the top on and you won't be affected by the things of the world it might think and it does It might smell and it does but God protects his people amen amen praise the Lord now as we bring it to a close you know again I'll just quote it for the sake of time you'll have to believe me if you don't come and see your past and he'll tell you there is a great evil Mighty spirit that's working in the world today Daniel 7 25 and it is called it talks about that the Antichrist in the end time watch this he said he will have the power to wear down the people let's turn to it just in case you are dubious um Daniel 7 25 all right this is a very strong spirit because I see it happening I go to a church I come back next time there's half there come back again there's a third there what's happening people are being tired I don't know what other words you use it says and he shall speak great things against the most high and shall wear out the signs brother we are not living in an easy time that Spirit of the age is there to wear us out to where us down to cause the society it's not worth it I have served the Lord for all these years and nothing's been happening friends serve him a little bit longer amen serve him until he says come home my good and faithful servant amen but that is a spirit thank you for bringing it up you you mark that now that is a spirit for our day because he's talking about the Antichrist Indian times it's a spirit that will wear the Saints out why don't you come to church on Wednesday well I work double shift oh why do you need the money well I've got three houses so I need to look after them and I've got six cars and I only need one that I drive and on and on friends it's wearing you out I'm not saying if you have to work go and work but watch your balance there is a spirit in the world that is affecting our message churches more so than others I don't know about others or don't go there but it's wearing us out we run running all day then when it's time to come to church we are tired Saturday night is a party it's a birthday party we have to go and visit this one nothing wrong with that don't don't think I'm saying anything against it but it's wearing us out and then we come to God say ask him yeah I suppose brother Ben preached okay he was all right ah it was really good for that sister I really knew he he's going to strike at half for her friends is for all of us don't be war or don't feel worn out a Saints it says so that's you and I that's the spirit of the age you know what another Spirit of the age is one turn to it you'll find it in your scripture it says that the gold the gold that has a nice glistening color and appearance it says that the gold will be tarnished tarnished you know what that means the shine probably just like my wedding ring that I've had for 37 years is going to be tarnished but it's still in the wedding ring but you know the goal that we should be is that what we are in his eyes friends it says in I won't tell you because I want you to look for it it says it will be tarnished it says it's the children of God sons of God is that happening perhaps you come years later where's his brother oh he's left and on and on I won't talk about that um you know Matthew Matthew 24 there's another actually we better turn to it and put it up uh whoever's doing the overheads please Matthew 24 watch this end time spirit and Friends these are not just Concepts these are not things that preachers preach about these are spirits that are uh uh are attacking not so much the world but you and I you see the devil's got no business at attacking his own because they are his it's like one person had a dream and um she she dreamed it was a woman usually a woman dream I don't know why more than men supposed to be Daydream and I actually dream during the night and uh she dreamed that she had she saw a Catholic again I've got nothing against Catholics don't get me wrong a Catholic if they believe in Jesus Christ they'll be saved a message person that believes in Jesus Christ will be saved they won't be saved because they're coming to a message Church let's get that right I think brother Ben explains that to you nicely okay it is your experience with the law that matters but she had a dream and she saw the devil sleeping on the steeple which is that thing there on the Catholic Church usually he was just sleeping on the top and then at the same time she had another dream that there was another church in that City where she was and the devil was very busy every Sunday morning coming to the door and and putting different thoughts into people's minds and everything and she said I don't understand why is the devil sleeping there and why is he so busy in the real Church of Jesus Christ and then the lord gave her the explanation she said my daughter they are his he doesn't have to do anything they're his whether they go to church or the pub or the wherever they go there he is he said but he's there where the Lord is working doing something amen friends that's why you and I are getting attacked by the enemy these days more than any other church around us that's why there are spirits that are coming that are trying to inject all sorts of teachings and and and and uh understandings and explanations you know what friends many times we miss the message of the message the message was not sent for us to debate over and interpret and for brother Ben to get here and give you a new teaching every morning the message was sent to bring us back to the original and if we use it for that wonderful you know what I believe I believe that if we all adhere to the message the way it was delivered there would be one Church brother there would be one little group and there'll be no issues I could come here or I could go to Gisborne or anywhere else and feel right at home but Francis human interpretation sorry I'm getting sidetracked but we'll get to it I'm getting you know this human interpretation that people put onto it we call that a spin you know spin a little bit it looks like this but brother I think I better put a little spin I spoke about this on Sunday I've got to continue with this thought on next Sunday I'll just put my own little spin this and see people you know what there is not a single person right here or perhaps in the city of Wellington that thinks they are wrong they all think they're serving God they all think they are right but friends there's another Spirit which we just turned to in Matthew 24 and that is a spirit of deception it's mentioned there three times it says be careful in verse 5 saying I'm Christ and shall deceive many okay first time then in verse 11 many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many not one or two but many okay let's go further verse 24 if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect three times the words came is mentioned right in the same time brother the deception wasn't so great during Martin Luther they sort of had a more black and white you know you believe or you don't and that's it but today there's so many deceptions the devil is using every possible means the the media the computers the whatever you have just deception yeah it's called Uh back home they call it con um conspiracy theory I have a certain person whom I know well back home I wouldn't again mention the name but soon as covert came my did she get right into it just about every day she's sending some conspiracy theory on her hair she said she didn't even talk to me but she just kept on sending it in the end I just didn't even look at it friends there's no into it the devil will use anything to deceive the people it doesn't matter whether you love sport whether you love alcohol whether you are living wrong whether you are not serving God the way you should as long as the devil has he has you in his hands friends he's happy with that and it's going on and on and three years later if I showed you my mobile phone these hundreds and hundreds but it's amazing she never sent anything positive about covert or anything good it was always the negative the negative the negative and negative and if I was inclined that way and if I sort of gave in to it I would have to come back to and say sister hope this is an awful world we live in this is an awful thing that's happening no I just disregarded because I know what the word says covert or no covert friends let's serve the Lord I don't know what you believe about covert but France I believe that was only a small foretaste of the what an enemy put out just to see how he can get the whole world whether he came from China or America Australia or New Zealand doesn't matter but the whole world was caught up in it and you know what was the catch word it wasn't God it was covered yeah how many new words have we got about 20 new words locked down uh and on and on that's became a new dictionary brother a new catchphrase a new buzzword as they call it yep wasn't it for two years 2020 back home until maybe six months ago it was all about coven did you get it are you scared did you get injected what happens if it happens to you oh look at the consequences oh look at this one got it and they died and look at this one they've got a heart attack and everything friends that was a little Prelude of the pressure and the squeeze was going to come or globally on the Bride of Jesus Christ we better be ready this is kind of she's come and gone but these uh there's a greater squeeze that's coming all right so in there okay I did turn to Matthew 24 sorry I I got sidetracked you're such a nice people to talk to it's so easy just to talk there's few amen Corners around so I just feel right at home amen amen 24. so I got onto the word deception deception brother Brown preached the deceived Church okay now verse 10 and then shall many be offended tell me is this true in New Zealand as it is in Australia and around the world you tell something to this sister listen your glass is a little bit crooked she's offended and she doesn't come to church you know this one here I say listen your Thai is not right up to the uh collar there brother oh who's he to tell me I'm just using examples I know you can accept them I wouldn't joke if I didn't love you you know and people it works for them you know how many times have you had a phone call and someone said listen brother uh in 2021 on the 17th of January you said this and this I don't know where I was on that date but they've kept it in their heart they harbored it and you know what it does it causes a fence where are most of the message churches uh people in message churches today they're offended they're not coming to church they're staying at home because you said something it's something that they don't agree with that's what causes offense so we're living an age of offense that's the subject in itself maybe brother Ben can take it up listen go it goes further and shall betray one another when I offend his brother it's very easy for him to betray me so I don't even know brother Michael I don't have anything to do with him and he talks to me roughly and so forth It's the Betrayal you know what it is a betrayal of Christian love and fellowship and unity that should be there ah but there's one more brother Michael and shall hate one another you talk about a hate-filled generation yeah get on the road stranger that you don't know look at him this way and bang you've got to smash something coming through your glass through your window the hatred I hate you I don't even know who I am what did I do wrong with you I've been praying for you and you hate me why you see it's a hate-filled generation for it these are real spirits that are affecting the people outside and unless we had our borders around us they are trying and they are coming a little bit at a time into a messy Church on this first floor hey maybe the government doesn't know where you are but the devil knows your address I think I'll call it is probably one one three I think there's a big number there he says demons cohorts imps on Sunday morning make sure you are there at nine o'clock before they turn up because they believe they should be here at 9 30 brother Ben I think I'm preaching the truth here now come there at nine o'clock someone will come to musicians will come and they'll just start playing and they just won't get the song right and this will be upset and on and on they're starting to work brother Bennett comes under the anointing of the Holy Spirit comes out of that office ready to preach the word friends and you are already oh seething you know what that means yeah all right seething all right whatever I suppose that's a word that we use in English all right so we're finishing soon and I want you to turn to this and put it up brother so I'm talking about spirits that are working and that are really really doing whatever they can to destroy the work of the Lord in this end time in air time in our message that we are so jealousful when you came to the message you would you probably said to yourself my this is just such a truth I would even die for it now you don't even look at it and you have it on your mobile phone the whole table or whatever which one you got it's a matter of pressing three buttons and you're right there listening to the message but no there's news ah but these current news ah these worldwide news oh there was an earthquake oh there was a tsunami oh there was a tornado oh that was a mass shooting you know how many the way in America this year mass shooting is anything over I think three or four people according to the account 279 mass shootings this year in the country called America which was a Godly country over three and plus another one just got shot nine Prince I don't dwell on that but listen if you keep on feeding on that that spirit is just there's something that's sort of attracting you to it yeah that's right yeah so all I'm telling you I'm just telling you a fact so you don't have to look for it don't go Googling because when you come home just take my word for it that's the spirit that's in the age 335 million people in the city in the country of America and so many shootings people are being killed every day every day you don't is that a normal spirit no I think it's an unnormal Spirit second Peter two I'll come and finish on the spiritual side of things and we'll need to finish all right listen to this now preachers don't usually preach from this chapter I hope your brother your pastor and your ministers do because it's a very Tatty chapter it's very direct it's very uh real and you say brother Michael no no you got it wrong Don't Preach this to us go to the Pentecostals and assemblies in UPC and others and preacher they no friends I'm not interested in them because I know that those Devils I was describing about they are here on Sunday morning at 9 30 ready to fill your mind with something that's right ah that song later he's always got the same songs can't he choose something else look what they're saying in America why don't we just join in and sing some new choruses well you get one of your people anointed and let them write the songs then you sing those songs which I believe you do brother Isaac yeah so he's already got you something and brother Ben he's going to come again and he's going to give us part six of the sermon that he started five weeks ago come on there must be something new brother Ben haven't you gone on the internet and see what others are preaching oh yes he's in touch with it the Juana that's above you know AI it's a new buzzword oh everything say hi watch it there it's going to start controlling our lives and the way they present that looks pretty scary brother is going to come in in my bank take all my money not do this much there so it's wasting time am I going to brother Ben's but you know if I reckon if the AI I've got a brother-in-law who knows about these things if AI merges with the common internet we're all in trouble but you know what God had it first yeah sure AI Almighty intelligence go to Judges chapter five six and seven and God was dealing with a city called AI That's right where was that City she was in the valley where is our Silicon Valley right in the valley what happened to AI it was burned by fire what's going to happen to California and that west side of America she will be burned by fire friends God had it first yeah so I'd rather spend time with this than trying to figure out something on you know that's right so chapter two uh second Peter two listen to this but there were false prophets also among the people all you can say about the fault preacher about false prophet brother Michael hey if there's a true one there's false ones we can you listen to this listen to the way the gods wisdom put put it even as there shall be false teachers didn't say prophets but teachers how many of us preach the teachers have we got today everybody preaching their own thoughts their ideas their interpretation their interpretation of the message and it's not even theirs I had an experience one with one brother and I said brother I'm coming to your house and you tell me everything you want why we are different than why we can't Fellowship together he said okay I'll do that I came there we started talking and he said now I've got to ring America to get first-hand evidence of things I'm talking about from someone else I said brother that wasn't the deal I came to your house and you were going to tell me why we are different oh he said but he can explain it better I said listen I won't be judged on the day of judgment what brother in America so so said I'll be judged by what the word says and in the end after about 45 minutes of talking brother there was about three things that divided us one was an interpretation of Greek word which I and he doesn't know what it means anyway the other one was something insignificant and the third thing is not even worth mentioning because I've forgotten so that's how much divided us for 20 years he kept his Fellowship away from the other fellowships in Sydney and you know what happened tell you what happened most of those people in that Fellowship disappeared someone to the world some married and went somewhere else some backslid many of them died and I did say when I go back which was a beautiful Fellowship about 70 80 people there's probably about a dozen because he kept it to himself friends we are to have fellowship with whosoever Will amen but not with the unfruitful works of darkness but be an example yeah these others that don't want to but you say brother why not come from fellowship Fellowship won't hurt you and then you what you when it comes in and the word works on him he'll be a different brother so there were false teachers among you who private privilege means privately or in a secret manner rather shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the Lord that brought them and bring upon themselves with destruction they teaching right now to say that the Lord Jesus Christ we've done away with done away with his blood in the cross brother Ben you've probably heard it and then on and on and on what does the scripture say here deny the Lord that brought them so the very Lord Jesus that saved them now they're saying they don't need him France it's something's gone wrong something's done around about turn yeah and listen to go let's go further and many shall follow their pernicious ways that's all right it's not a big word you know what pernicious means I'll explain it to you and you'll know for the rest of your life now highly injurious or destructive in the highly injurious or destructive way let's go further tending to fatal issue and deadly harmful effect brother Michael can my words have that upon someone else absolutely if I came here with the wrong motive if I came here to proselyte if I came here to get some money if I came here just to see what I can teach in France and I'm not based on the word then my motive is wrong it's deceitful and it's it's fatal issues and it's deadly ah especially I like this thank God for a good dictionary Webster is all right you don't know a Webster was a Christian by the way yeah sure I don't know this is Webster one of you others but it doesn't matter especially in gradual and subtle manner wow so I don't come here wants to convert you all and take you away from this Fellowship I come progressively I come slowly I come with another agenda in my pocket I come to see if I can slip one in as brother Branham said he said they they put the something on the bait he said they throw it in he said the fish catches it and he said then they Jerk It France I'm not that sort of a Preacher I didn't come for that reason but I came here to tell you that the word says pernicious means uh gradual and subtle manner how many have left our fellowships worldwide because of other teachers that came subtly and gradually and worked on them and worked on them and showed them greater light just like Eve and where are they today they're in the world would have been better for them not to have known the truth they've lost their children they lost their families they lost their husbands they lost their wives uh and on and on and on that's right I've seen it I know myself I know one sister she was so precious little sister I mean short sister and had a daughter called one better not saying and she listened to brother Reginald sales tapes she listened to him for many years never met him and brother Rachel was in Melbourne with me and I said brother sister I'm going to bring the brother that you've been listening to for many years on tape so you can come and see you oh she's a brother that would be wonderful I just have not seen that man I took him there we had Fellowship white told him about middle of the night the sister was really encouraged and strong and so forth a few years later I found out that she's left the message gone her own way she was she left her first husband because the husband left her because she became a Believer now she went back and went into the world brother and married another unbeliever absolutely you talk about gradual and receptive manner of she was feeding on something wrong and some of you that are failing on a certain thing on the internet raise it don't read it because friends anything that we feed on sooner or later it becomes a part of us amen so we don't need to come on Sunday and discuss and say listen did you see the latest one such and such I won't mention it because then I'm giving you I'm giving seed to that I don't want it just leave it friends if we haven't got enough truth and if we don't know what the truth is then forget about the internet we have it all right now so you know the word punishes they had this young sister will remember that big word that you never knew gradual and subtle manner of deception back to deception brother listen to this chapter verse 3 and through covetousness that means a bit of money behind that shall they with find words make merchandise of you make merchandise of you how much can I grab out of this one how much can I grab out of this one how much can I you know pull through my preaching merchandise means making business that's what it means making business okay now the word feign it means to pretend and to be insincere it means listen to this sense of hiding true feelings and emotions by presenting something else so I'm hiding the truth but I've got a hidden agenda that's what these teachers are I'm still talking about the end time teachers and on and on okay I think it's just a good example we just mainly there's another one there in Ezekiel we'll have just quote for the sake of time it says no I've got to turn to it because you need to remember it amen it's nothing like turning to the old printed Bible amen ah you can have it on uh on your mobile phone and so forth but let's turn to it Ezekiel 33. it's something better you know why I'm so proud of my Bible and why I appreciate it and why I don't have any other uh things except written things because I'll give you a secret I'm a printer by trade so I've got to support my printing trade I'm not I eat I'm not an I.T rather another I'm still a printer I was a printer rather when I started my apprenticeship and I just believe it's good to get this brother Brown said have you got your Bibles he said very good he said let's have a look let's open them and let's read there is something about to him that heareth listen to this and read us the words of this prophecy hey man don't just listen to it say to yourself it's just a double entry point hearing and looking Ezekiel 33 I know I believe the time is time to finish so I will listen to this beautiful verses but again it's for our day and I'm talking about have you got a spot in your heart I'm just going to get to it as I finish now listen to this Ezekiel 33 will start from 31. and they shall come unto you as the people that do come I'm just sort of paraphrasing it a little bit just to show that this King James version is not too hard after all they sit before you as my people when brother gets on Sunday morning you sit here in front of him as God's people not Ben's people but as God's people right and brother Ben's ready to preach and they hear your words brother Ben that was wonderful that was good brother Ben what did he say oh I'm not sure if I forgot I better I don't have anything written down I think I forgot what he said and you didn't even go out of the church yet happens we are you know humans that are not very good retaining some things that we don't want to retain amen I'll put it that way but they uh sorry they will hear your words but they will not do them so God places something with brother Ben's heart he comes here he Thunders and he preaches for an hour and a half and you say praise the Lord that was off the Lord that was really for me you heard it but you're not ready to do them for with their mouth they show much love but their heart goes after their covetousness the heart is deceitful Above All Things who can know what the scripture says so they hear it it sounds good they're ready to sing about it but they go their own way we're not there yet not at the end and lo you are unto them a very lovely song that was a beautiful sermon wow I don't think we heard this anywhere in the world today and the way it was presented very lovely song and of one that has a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument but they hear thy words but they to not do them is it possible that it's a prophecy for today that's all right bring in the next verse brother and what is an end a conjunction it binds the whole thing together and when this comes to pass in 19 2023 on the 31st of May the last day of autumn it's falling the leaves are falling Winter's coming and when this comes to pass and it will for long it will come then shall they know that a prophet has been amongst them if that's not the picture of the message movement generally what is don't you touch that oh there's very special oh I love that voice oh when I hear that voice I can just fall asleep and just oh just wonderful that's exactly right what's the effect of it and when you understand that these words are so beautiful and sweet and they'll know that a prophet has been amongst them come and gone brothers and sisters 60 odd years come and gone we're a lot further than that amen amen so let's allow him to remove every spot I'll read that quote might give you one more story if time permits and then I'll finish listen to this one of these days if you haven't already you'll and I'm not scaring you now please get me wrong don't get me wrong but we need to sound warning we need to preach the truth friends because it is for everybody it's as much as it is for me as much as it is for you you don't know what I'm going through back home you don't know what issues I have you don't know how holy I am and so forth neither do I know about you but he does and one of these days if you haven't already you'll cross that line You'll Never desire no more to do what's right did you hear what I said what did he say you'll never decide to do what's right it's a matter of brother sister do you realize what has been said you'll cross that line and you'll never want to do it again you'll still hear the gospel you'll still come on Sunday and listen but you'll never accept it you can't accept it and all and on I just don't want to go too far friends there are people that have heard this message all their lives and right now towards the end instead of being on fervent and on Zeal more for God than ever before they've walked away from it and said there's nothing to it and that's it where do they get that from from the internet what spirit is feeding him that Spirit that's behind that on and on um I'll leave the brother Ben to preach but that's the truth anyway now listen to this while you continue singing I want to ask you something is there a spot in your heart that's what I've brought you to now I didn't bring you to another new message or something else to tantalize your ears and senses but I brought you to this is there a spot in your heart that seems to be darkened by sin if it is now is the time to get rid of it right now friends if I've said nothing please remember that and if there is if you've got any Darkness on your life won't you come right here around the alternator while we continue to sing right now if there is a spot don't put it off any longer yeah yeah God's speaking to all of us we all have spots we all have imperfections we all have shortcomings we all have things that shouldn't be there friends now is the time to react in your own way and finally said Lord Jesus I've done the best that I know how I've done all that I know how Grand Lord that the mercy doors are still open of these hundreds literally hundreds seeking thee at this time at the altar take away every sinful blot Lord and take them in today friends we have some of those spots let the Holy Spirit work on us and let's really come to a new love relationship with our Lord Jesus Christ don't let it be just words but let's start acting let's start assimilating I don't know what that word means so when you go home young ones you can go on the computer for that and find out what it means assimilate I do know what it means I shouldn't be sarcastic let's love him more than ever before amen let me say this story a true story rather a true happening and finish many other things but anyway I think you've got you've got the gist of offered what I was trying to say amen what sport have I and you have in our lives that was a man listen to me young ones just before you fall asleep true story said and spoken by a man the brother Branham prayed for and the brother Branham said that he had uh certificates to plaster the whole wall so much so when brother Brenham started speaking to him he fell over the desk it's all in the message I'll give you his name his name is Paris reedhead read him a very powerful preacher back in the 50s and 60s and 70s and had a lot of contact with brother Branham that's the one that said brother Branham I don't think I have the Holy Ghost I've got all these certificates it's not helping me and he said brother Graham said he got the Holy Ghost and he was a different man thereafter and this is the example he said sometimes look sometimes it's good to know that background all right so we're not plucking it out of air and and so forth but it's a real man that had contact with brother Branham quite a lot favorite 1956 sorry 1856 170 odd years ago there was a prospector a gold prospector that went left England and went to America and he went there for a number of years and he earned a fair bit of money prospecting or looking for gold and it was his last day in America he was in the State of Florida right down the bottom there on the east side of America where the ships were sailing from Florida back to England he had a couple of hours to twice so he was addressed however he left his dirty gold miners boots on we call you know they were really dirty for some reason he still had them on he he gets his suitcase he's got everything ready the ship's leaving it in the afternoon he has got a couple of hours to waste he goes past a certain Gathering and while he's in that Gathering walking past he hears a lot of noise so how what's going on he said I've got a bit of time let me see what's going on there so he comes through the back door he comes in and it's an auction an auction is a place where they sell things here they were selling people they were called slaves African slaves true story and as he came to the back he said I'll just see what's happening now God made man and man-made slaves it's wrong it was wrong and it's not acceptable and it's an anti-word all right we know that so don't you try to make a slave out of anyone not even your husband or Your Wife by the way all right know your children that's right and um he stands at the back right there brother and there are two men at the back that are bidding for this woman I'll make up the figure because he didn't mention the figure but not just to help you understand the two men are saying when we get this woman a slave she was banned with chains on her hands and fetches on her feet so she couldn't walk very fast and she couldn't run away so the two men at the back that were bidding that it was their final bid and the auction is looking at him right at the back and he said going once going twice he'll be Soul she'll be sold and that Gold Miner prospector something Rises within his heart doesn't know he said the man the auction he said it's going she's going for fifty dollars a human being fifty dollars friends you know how much a human being's worth for what will the prophet I mean if he gains the whole world and loses his soul brother Brown said uh our souls are worth more than ten thousand worlds there's no price on our soul and every living soul that has been born is a soul before God and has the same value equality all the way amen I wish I was around in that time brother I'd be talking against those things but anyway there's many slaves of different types that we need to talk against today so he's the auction he says she'll be sold for fifty dollars if there's no further bidding going ones go Empires going third and final call and our prospector from the back he yells out a hundred dollars stops silence people can't believe what they heard they said oh a slave has never been sold for more than ten twenty dollars these people are paying 50. and this stupid man is paying a hundred so the auctioneer before he sells the woman he says sir but do you have that that much money as well I've got to do it it's going once going twice going third and final time sold to that gentleman at the back for a hundred dollars he comes forward to the front he takes this poor woman they can barely walk he's got chains on hands and feet I've been a slave all her life he takes outside of the auctioneering room and the woman looks at him the first thing she does she spits in his face she's only known hatred and abused Prince all her life she spits in his face he being a gentleman he took his slave like this and he just wiped it off not a word and she says I hate you I hate you but I want to be a slave I hate you why did you buy me you didn't say a word and he wasn't a Christian he just took her along went to the office across the road and you you used to get what we call a bill of emancipation yeah yeah which some of you know it was just a bill to say that that person is yours you have a title deed like you have for a house or a car oh that you I think I call it a warrant here and she's yours so he goes across to the office there and he says can I have the papers I bought her and the clerk in the office looks at it and he says sir there's a mistake here you paid a hundred dollars we've never paid that much for a slave it's a mistake he said I bought her but do you have that much money the papers if he gives him the key she unlocks the lock unlocks her feet the chain her fetus on her feet and they walk outside from the office and the woman says sir rather he spoke first and he said lady you are free go false on her knees instantly she grabs his dirty muddy workers boots and starts crying and says sir you bored me you liberated me and now you gave me the freedom and now I'm free I will serve you for the rest of my life let's stand to our faith friends isn't he Worthy shouldn't we love him he paid the price not with silver and gold but these Precious Blood friends not a hundred dollars but a price that cannot be measured he paid the price for you and I he set us free he liberated us and now we want to be his servants for the rest of our lives is that right lift your hand up it you really got a heart to do then you had why not friends Lord Jesus let's pray Lord as I've said this story and some of these words that I've spoken to my dear brothers and sisters here Lord I pray that your Holy Spirit would come now and begin to work uh on the hearts of the people Lord we want our hearts not to have any spots and if there are any right now we pray that your holy spirit will show them would uh reveal them to us and Lord that we may get rid of those
