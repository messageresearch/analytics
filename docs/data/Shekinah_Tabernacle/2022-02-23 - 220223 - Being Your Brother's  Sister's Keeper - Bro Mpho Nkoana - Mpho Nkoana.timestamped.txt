[39:03] Jesus Christ I pray amen
[39:06] greet you once again in the name of our
[39:08] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[39:10] amen we always get a bit nervous when
[39:12] you come here because it's not a place
[39:15] to actually
[39:16] um
[39:19] uh play jokes
[39:21] and say things that you are not
[39:24] aware
[39:25] or know what you're talking about amen
[39:28] so we just want to thank the Lord thank
[39:30] you so much bent and the musicians
[39:32] thanks for the David for leading the
[39:34] songs
[39:35] that someone was telling us
[39:38] oh I was listening to the service of the
[39:42] memorial of our departed brother Gideon
[39:45] and they say in his first service his
[39:47] brother was telling us that you know in
[39:50] his first service he did like what David
[39:52] did read the scripture and uh started
[39:55] preaching and forgot to let people see
[39:57] that
[39:58] so because when you get here in the
[40:01] pulpit
[40:02] uh it's not an easy place just like when
[40:05] you're standing there it's a very
[40:07] serious place to be in the presence of
[40:08] the Lord and brothers and sisters let's
[40:10] read the scripture before we can go too
[40:13] much in preliminaries let's read the
[40:16] description the Book of Genesis chapter
[40:18] 4.
[40:20] I'm glad to see each one of you and you
[40:21] are more than welcome to be here in the
[40:24] presence of the Living God Amen let's
[40:26] read Genesis chapter 4. and from verse 2
[40:29] up to verse 9. we are going to do a bit
[40:30] of reading of the scriptures tonight in
[40:33] fact I've got something that I would
[40:35] like to tell the tech guys let's leave
[40:37] this first and sit down I would like to
[40:39] to do something amen
[40:41] are we there if we are there just say
[40:43] Amen
[40:44] so you can see they also just read
[40:46] together
[40:48] and she again bear his brother Abel
[40:52] enable was a keeper of sheep but Kane
[40:55] was a tiller of the ground
[40:57] and in process of time
[41:00] it came to pass that Cain brought of the
[41:03] fruit of the ground and offering unto
[41:05] the Lord
[41:06] and Abel he also brought the of the
[41:10] first Links of his flock and of the FED
[41:13] thereof and the Lord had respect unto
[41:16] the unto able and and to his offer
[41:19] verse 5.
[41:22] but I'm talking and and to his offering
[41:24] he had no respect and Cain was very much
[41:27] Roth and his countenance fell
[41:31] right
[41:32] and the Lord said unto him why are thou
[41:34] wroth and why is thy countenance Fallen
[41:39] if thou do as well shall thou not be
[41:42] accepted
[41:44] and
[41:45] um
[41:46] accept it and if thou do as well sin if
[41:50] thou doest not well sin lieth at the
[41:54] door
[41:55] right
[41:56] and unto thee shall be his desire and
[42:00] thou shall rule over him and Cain talked
[42:03] with his brother
[42:05] Abel
[42:07] and and Cain talked with his with Abel
[42:10] his brother and it came to pass when
[42:13] they were in the field that Cain Rose
[42:16] against him against Abel his brother and
[42:19] slew him
[42:21] and the Lord said unto Cain where is thy
[42:24] brother where is Abel Abel thy brother
[42:27] and he said I know not he just lie I
[42:31] know not am I My Brother's Keeper
[42:35] if you listen to verse two this actually
[42:37] was uh
[42:40] two yeah it says and she bear
[42:44] she again bear his brother Abel this is
[42:47] Eve right
[42:48] and Abel or Abel was a keeper of the
[42:52] ship he was a keeper
[42:54] right he was a keeper
[42:57] but he was keeping life
[43:00] right he was providing life he was a
[43:02] keeper but
[43:05] on the oppos
[43:07] Ed Cain said to God am I My Brother's
[43:09] Keeper
[43:11] so you can already see that these two
[43:13] are not on the same page
[43:15] let's pray Heavenly Father
[43:19] we will never pray enough Lord
[43:21] all I'm trying to do Lord is that you
[43:24] can take over

[44:34] little topic not so little

[46:27] okay so these people that has been
[46:29] volunteered or volunteered themselves we
[46:31] are going to read a couple of scriptures
[46:33] tonight
[46:34] um you can share with the one next to
[46:35] you but as I just want to make it a bit
[46:38] participatory because I would like us to
[46:40] follow one another as we go along but
[46:43] the thought of the night you know I've
[46:45] been thinking uh not just to deviate a
[46:47] bit brother Ben I've been thinking
[46:50] with so many Pastors in the lately who
[46:53] has been going on and leaving us
[46:56] I was asking myself what is the Lord
[46:58] actually trying to tell us
[47:00] and a thought came to me that maybe you
[47:04] know I mean I know we are going to be
[47:06] able to know them and see but perhaps
[47:09] these people that are going on who are
[47:11] pastors who are known probably not only
[47:13] in their church but everywhere maybe the
[47:16] Lord is this Resurrection is about to
[47:18] happen
[47:19] and the Lord wants you to know and see
[47:21] those pastors that ah oh
[47:26] pasta you know that could be a
[47:28] possibility the lord gave it to me when
[47:31] I was busy showering
[47:33] and the Lord said ah maybe that could be
[47:35] the reason
[47:36] that the Lord wants us to to know and
[47:38] see them maybe we see a brother
[47:40] somewhere in Chile I may not know him
[47:42] that has gone on but if I see a pastor
[47:45] in Chile who I saw on YouTubers ah that
[47:48] brother they were burying it I remember
[47:49] this pastor maybe I used to follow the
[47:52] services there right so maybe I don't
[47:54] know this is just me I wish it wasn't
[47:56] recorded
[47:57] but now let's come back to our thought
[48:00] being your brothers
[48:03] or sister skipper
[48:05] I would love to to think it like along
[48:08] the lines of saying am I My Brother's
[48:11] Keeper
[48:12] am I My Brother's Keeper or My Sister's
[48:14] Keeper am I am I really dead
[48:18] and I want us again to put another
[48:20] thought on top of that that is which is
[48:22] actually the the gist or the core of
[48:24] what I want us to think about I I
[48:26] understand and I appreciate that on the
[48:30] physical side we can be Keepers and look
[48:33] after for one another that we can give
[48:36] one another we do those things and
[48:38] that's wonderful unbelievers also do
[48:40] that by the way
[48:42] unbelievers look after one another a
[48:45] smoker will never finish
[48:47] a cigarette another one just say to him
[48:49] safe
[48:51] and then he gives him
[48:53] you know what Escape
[48:54] it means just please just
[48:57] give me some little bit and they love
[48:59] one another and he'll suck that
[49:01] cigarette where his brother was sucking
[49:04] without no questions without asking him
[49:07] when did he last have flu or anything
[49:09] like that
[49:10] and he will just suck that cigarette
[49:12] because they look after they keep one
[49:16] another
[49:17] when he gets something he'll call his
[49:19] brother hey I've got some packet can we
[49:22] meet later on tonight the devil teaches
[49:25] them to look for one another on how to
[49:27] take one another to hell
[49:31] he's the best planner
[49:34] below Jesus Christ
[49:36] the devil so the devil and his people
[49:39] they do those things church people they
[49:41] do those things so that is why I want us
[49:43] to go a little bit higher right and
[49:47] think of more the spiritual application
[49:49] what is it that I'm doing for my brother
[49:52] to keep him to be in heaven what is it
[49:55] for me that I'm doing to keep my brother
[49:57] to be delivered from this evil spirit
[50:02] what is it that I'm doing to give him
[50:04] eternal life that's what I'm I want us
[50:06] to think along those lines of course the
[50:09] examples we are going to talk about are
[50:10] much more
[50:11] physical on the physical but let's apply
[50:14] let's put our spiritual jacket as
[50:16] brother Marcus would say Amen
[50:18] now we have read that and we have heard
[50:21] about this man who for the first time
[50:24] him he was offended when he was asked
[50:27] where is your brother and a God knew
[50:29] that if I ask him
[50:31] where is your brother he's going to be
[50:33] offended
[50:34] that is why God asked him where is your
[50:36] brother do you think God did not know
[50:39] God knew even when he was asking them
[50:41] where are thou Adam and if he knew and
[50:43] he knew they were going to lie to him so
[50:46] sometimes children
[50:49] when we ask you we know
[50:51] what you're going to say
[50:53] yeah and your wives
[50:55] and you husbands
[50:57] sometimes your wife will just ask you
[50:59] but he knows that actually this is what
[51:02] you're going to say but anyway
[51:04] let's talk about God
[51:06] God knew that they were going to tell
[51:09] him wrong God knew Adam came was going
[51:14] to say I don't know
[51:15] how rude and how arrogant
[51:17] I don't know
[51:19] okay he even went forth and had the guts
[51:24] to ask God am I My Brother's Keeper
[51:27] because he knew God was asking him why
[51:29] did you not keep your brother
[51:31] he knew God was asking him hey why why
[51:35] didn't you keep and preserve your
[51:36] brother's life
[51:39] huh why were you angry
[51:41] right so
[51:43] we find that the root cause of Cane's
[51:46] Road
[51:48] was not actually did not actually begin
[51:50] when they were born or when they were
[51:54] busy cultivating or other looking after
[51:57] the Sheep it's It came it really the
[52:00] peak of it came when they started to
[52:02] worship and serve God
[52:04] it came when they came in the service of
[52:06] God when they came in church
[52:10] that's why those ones they can escape
[52:12] for one another they can kill one
[52:14] another anytime for them is tea time
[52:16] it's not a problem they are permanently
[52:19] Sinners until we bring gospel to them
[52:21] but you who is in church the moment you
[52:24] start worshiping God and doing God a
[52:26] service that's why the spirit of Cain
[52:28] starts
[52:30] that's why the spirit of Cain begins
[52:32] and then you see your brother with a
[52:35] gift instead of being happy
[52:37] you get rough
[52:39] that's the spirit of Cain
[52:41] there's somewhere in the Bible where the
[52:43] Bible says when you see your brother be
[52:45] happy with him when he gets something
[52:47] happy when he does something good be
[52:49] happy like it's yours there's somewhere
[52:51] in the Bible I've read it where it says
[52:53] why be happy with those who are happy
[52:56] real happy like it's you
[53:00] like I've told you before when I see
[53:02] brother Armand with him what do you call
[53:04] that car Tesla amen I get happy like
[53:07] like I'm gonna drive with him it's
[53:09] almost like my car I get so happy one
[53:12] day my brother I'll get a chance even me
[53:14] because my brother bought that nice car
[53:16] I get happy
[53:17] because I know it's it's it's it's it's
[53:19] it's also I've got a share on that car
[53:25] thank you brother man
[53:28] so
[53:29] the point I'm trying to say here
[53:31] brothers and sisters
[53:33] is that
[53:34] when Abel and Kane started to do a
[53:36] sacrifice for God
[53:39] and then worship God bring things for
[53:42] God that's where problems begun
[53:46] and I want to bring it to you that uh
[53:49] often people will mention things like
[53:52] you know you think you're holy
[53:54] holier than thou mentality
[53:57] if you hear someone asking you you're
[53:58] holier than thou
[54:00] and that that's a cane spirit
[54:03] I'm sorry
[54:05] you cannot say to your brother you are
[54:07] holier than thou
[54:09] appreciate what your brother is doing if
[54:12] you say a good thing if it's a wrong
[54:14] thing help him
[54:16] if it's a good thing happy happy with
[54:18] him right you can't say yeah you know
[54:21] you know the spirit of Cain is like this
[54:26] Abel never said to Cain no no don't do
[54:29] the fruits come come and do the sheep
[54:32] with me he never said that all what ivel
[54:34] did he just sacrificed for God and Abel
[54:38] never said a word
[54:39] he never said a word to offend or to to
[54:42] provoke Cain only God said
[54:46] uh
[54:47] God I like this sacrifice and that was
[54:51] the crime for Abel for what God Said
[54:53] that was the crime for Abraham many
[54:55] times the holier than thou mentality
[54:56] people you don't do anything Uma you you
[55:00] just serve God then they say you think
[55:01] you're holy
[55:03] because they feel wrong and guilty
[55:06] instead of repenting or appreciating you
[55:09] and encouraging you say oh my sister you
[55:11] are inspiring me I'm learning so much
[55:14] from you no no they don't they say she
[55:16] thinks she's holy
[55:18] that's the spirit of Cain
[55:22] what sort of discussions do you have
[55:24] yourself in your private space
[55:28] what what sort of thoughts do you do you
[55:30] engage with the devil regarding your
[55:32] brother
[55:33] or your system when a thought come the
[55:36] Pastor said here there's nothing wrong
[55:37] with the thoughts going flying above us
[55:40] the problem is when they start to stick
[55:42] in here when you start to entertain them
[55:44] now what do you do what what does do you
[55:48] engage the devil about your sister or
[55:50] your brother what can not with other
[55:52] people alone
[55:54] privately in your private space What
[55:57] thoughts am I thinking about my sister
[56:00] or my brother what am I thinking they
[56:03] are
[56:05] or they do
[56:07] it's just a question mark and what what
[56:09] what thoughts and discussion do I engage
[56:11] with God about my brother or my sister
[56:14] do I go before God and and talk about my
[56:18] brother positively before God or I go
[56:21] there trying to say oh Lord just help
[56:23] him the way he is
[56:27] because I'm already judging him and I
[56:29] think God will listen to such attitude
[56:32] but I don't go with sobriety of saying
[56:34] Lord I you know how much I love my
[56:36] brother I'm praying you give me more
[56:38] love for him to pray for him more okay
[56:41] what thoughts because God said very
[56:43] clear I know the thoughts I'm thinking
[56:45] about you I know that I've got the plans
[56:48] for you and it's the thoughts of
[56:50] prosperity it's the thoughts of
[56:52] everything nice
[56:53] but what does to me and you have
[56:57] to discuss with these two persons the
[57:00] devil and God
[57:02] that's the question mark That's part of
[57:04] our introduction
[57:06] in your private space
[57:08] is it the thoughts of bad thoughts or
[57:11] ugly thoughts or inferior thoughts or
[57:14] lesser lesser is lesser or she's lesser
[57:18] than me
[57:21] remember thought speaks powerfully
[57:23] thoughts don't speak like I'm speaking
[57:25] now thoughts thoughts are so powerful
[57:27] the Bible says they actually speak
[57:29] louder before God than our ways their
[57:33] thoughts
[57:34] it didn't say a light thought or heavy
[57:38] thought or what or or lighter thoughts
[57:41] not thoughts
[57:42] the moment I thought a thought is like
[57:45] you know sometimes effort goes through
[57:48] your mind and you don't know it
[57:50] they say we process over sixty thousand
[57:52] is it sixty thousand thoughts a day
[57:56] we process them in our minds
[58:00] my friend likes to preach Brothers India
[58:01] about the subconscious some of them go
[58:03] through the subconscious they only come
[58:05] at night when you are sleeping
[58:07] they pass through your mind and you
[58:09] didn't realize
[58:10] something happened in the spiritual
[58:12] realm and it linked to your thoughts
[58:13] some of them you entertain them some of
[58:16] them just a demon just came landed there
[58:20] to wait for an opportunity
[58:22] and then a thought come
[58:24] and then the devil create a situation
[58:26] that connects with that thought and then
[58:28] you entertain it
[58:30] about your sister or about your brother
[58:32] what kind of thoughts are we ought to be
[58:34] entertaining
[58:36] huh
[58:37] so that's our introduction
[58:39] or or do I in my private space when I
[58:43] talk to God do I think better thoughts
[58:45] good thoughts holy thoughts protective
[58:47] thoughts you know in you know thoughts
[58:50] that uplift my brother or my sister
[58:53] the moment I hear any form of evil I
[58:56] know there's a demon there what do I do
[58:58] until the prophet preached that message
[59:02] and a reaction to an action am I right
[59:05] is there such as someone yes
[59:07] okay let's take the first scripture and
[59:09] then our first volunteer is going to
[59:12] read for us but the first scripture that
[59:14] we want to take
[59:16] is a comparison of David and Saul
[59:20] you remember David so many things we can
[59:23] talk about David pray it please pray a
[59:25] night tonight we won't go long
[59:27] but David
[59:29] when there was an opportunity for him to
[59:32] destroy a soul
[59:33] the person who wanted to destroy him
[59:36] but David on two occasions that I know
[59:39] of saved his life
[59:41] let's read that scripture first Samuel
[59:43] 26 11 to 12.
[59:45] you got this sister Maggie
[59:48] go for it don't don't read faster
[59:51] uh read like you are talking to these
[59:53] people like you are preaching to them
[59:55] you know I know you're not preaching but
[59:57] don't read faster as if you are reading
[59:59] for yourself read like they hear you
[1:00:01] that it can sink in
[1:00:04] 11. the Lord forbid that I should
[1:00:07] stretch forth mine hand against the
[1:00:10] Lord's anointed
[1:00:11] but I pray they take their now the spear
[1:00:15] that is at his bolster and the crews of
[1:00:18] water and let us go
[1:00:20] so David took the spear and the cruise
[1:00:23] of water from Saul's bolster and they
[1:00:27] get them away and no man saw it nor knew
[1:00:31] it neither awake it awaked for they were
[1:00:35] all asleep because a deep sleep from the
[1:00:37] Lord it deep sleep from the Lord
[1:00:40] because God wanted to make sure what
[1:00:43] kind of a keeper is David going to be
[1:00:47] and David
[1:00:48] said
[1:00:50] this is a pure seed of Abel or self
[1:00:54] this David he said he's the LIE is that
[1:00:56] line you see what he did there what do
[1:00:59] you think would have would have happened
[1:01:00] if so if it was opposite if it was soul
[1:01:05] because he wanted to kill him anyhow
[1:01:07] the reason why he was in that thing he
[1:01:09] was looking for him he was in that cave
[1:01:11] it's because he was looking for him not
[1:01:13] to have coffee
[1:01:14] no no no
[1:01:17] he was looking for him to have dinner to
[1:01:19] kill him
[1:01:21] but David know him very well no wonder
[1:01:23] the Bible says even the enemy your enemy
[1:01:26] give him food the one that you know can
[1:01:29] kill you today the person that you know
[1:01:31] can kill you bring him in your house put
[1:01:34] him on the couch and give him food
[1:01:36] ah the one that can kill me
[1:01:38] yes
[1:01:40] that one and that's the message for
[1:01:42] today if that happened to David and we
[1:01:45] are in the seven Church eight in an
[1:01:47] eagle age where we are supposed to be
[1:01:49] higher and see better
[1:01:52] are we not supposed to actually be
[1:01:54] taking a plus
[1:01:55] we are the a plus group today man we are
[1:01:58] the A-Class group today brother Ben we
[1:02:01] are not the the the the the lower grade
[1:02:04] C down no no no we are top today we are
[1:02:07] the a plus great and that must happen
[1:02:09] everything that they did
[1:02:12] and that the Lord did we are even going
[1:02:15] to do more things because the Lord
[1:02:16] promised us that even greater things you
[1:02:19] are going to do
[1:02:20] so David could have smashed him
[1:02:24] he would have killed him I said last
[1:02:26] time I I left you
[1:02:29] now is your time be a goner he could
[1:02:32] have destroyed him but David because
[1:02:35] he's the keeper of his brother
[1:02:38] he kept
[1:02:39] in his mind he had everything of the
[1:02:42] best about Saul
[1:02:45] clearly knowing that Saul has got
[1:02:47] everything to harm him
[1:02:50] that is against this flesh isn't it it's
[1:02:53] against the thinking he just that that
[1:02:55] clearly just separates
[1:02:57] they keep us in the non-keepers it just
[1:03:00] shows the line of Cain and the line of
[1:03:02] good clearly
[1:03:03] and that's where me and you should come
[1:03:05] tonight to that point
[1:03:07] because today is Battle is no more do
[1:03:11] you know what we call an as a guy
[1:03:12] [Laughter]
[1:03:14] sorry I'm half Afrikaans
[1:03:16] and After High
[1:03:19] is a
[1:03:22] sphere
[1:03:23] thank you Uma
[1:03:25] almost Yemen I think
[1:03:30] are you German or Dash over
[1:03:32] Dutch that's why as a guy it's a spear
[1:03:36] and spear where you know if sharp one
[1:03:43] so what did I want to say about that as
[1:03:45] a guy
[1:03:47] okay
[1:03:48] David would have took his as a guy and
[1:03:51] then destroyed him one time
[1:03:54] that's what David would have done but he
[1:03:56] did not do that he preserved him you can
[1:03:59] see him there can you see it on the
[1:04:00] picture
[1:04:01] that man actually told him hey
[1:04:04] the Lord has given him to you today that
[1:04:07] man told you what you can go and read it
[1:04:09] that man told him that David
[1:04:15] and of course I would have believed him
[1:04:19] I'm sure I would have believed him
[1:04:21] and and said yeah you are you are right
[1:04:24] that's why the Lord made them all sleep
[1:04:27] that's why the Lord made him and they
[1:04:29] sleep was from the Lord the Bible says
[1:04:30] so the Lord made them sleep for me too
[1:04:34] to finish him
[1:04:36] that's not the eagle age thinking
[1:04:38] David said
[1:04:41] I don't touch them I don't touch the
[1:04:43] anointed of the Lord
[1:04:45] knowing very well that this man he's a
[1:04:47] killer
[1:04:49] this man he's a promise breaker this man
[1:04:53] he's everything bad but he says he's the
[1:04:56] anointed of the Lord
[1:04:57] knowing that my brother yesterday was
[1:04:59] angry and swearing at me and I say this
[1:05:02] is the son of the most high God yes
[1:05:06] yes we must be opposite the thinking of
[1:05:10] this world when the devil goes this way
[1:05:13] we go that way when the devil go that
[1:05:15] way we go always go opposite praise
[1:05:19] God's children even if you see them
[1:05:21] doing wrong
[1:05:23] don't break them
[1:05:25] amen
[1:05:27] that's what David did it's not for David
[1:05:29] to judge Saul
[1:05:32] right it's not for me
[1:05:34] to judge you
[1:05:37] or to be judged by you
[1:05:40] no no it's not for me or for you our job
[1:05:43] is to bring to give eternal life our job
[1:05:47] is to because we'll see as we go along
[1:05:50] what the prophet says let's jump to
[1:05:52] another example you pass on the my gear
[1:05:54] or do you want us to go this side my
[1:05:56] sister
[1:05:57] um we continue with the next speaker
[1:06:00] almost ready then we are looking at the
[1:06:03] next example
[1:06:05] can you see it that is example of
[1:06:08] Abraham
[1:06:09] many examples
[1:06:11] he was his brother's keeper until he
[1:06:14] left with him when God told him you I'm
[1:06:16] saying You must go and he takes Lord
[1:06:19] because inside his nature is of a keeper
[1:06:22] he wants to keep the best thing the Lord
[1:06:25] has called me so surely the Lord won't
[1:06:27] have a problem my brother if you come
[1:06:28] with me
[1:06:30] you know what that was not what the Lord
[1:06:31] wanted but he said he's got the nature
[1:06:33] of God God would have stopped him if he
[1:06:35] wanted him
[1:06:36] he'd have stopped him and say hey I'm
[1:06:38] saying you and Sarah I never said Lord
[1:06:40] but he still because he's got the nature
[1:06:42] of God and God allowed him
[1:06:45] practice what he's best what he is
[1:06:48] and later on God separated them because
[1:06:51] in any case initially God wanted only
[1:06:54] him
[1:06:56] are we together
[1:06:58] so what did he do if all married for us
[1:07:00] Genesis 13. from verse 8.
[1:07:04] and Ibraham said unto lot late there be
[1:07:07] no Strife I pray thee between me and
[1:07:11] thee and between my herdmen and thy
[1:07:14] herdmen for we be brethren
[1:07:17] is not the whole land before thee
[1:07:20] separate thyself I pray thee from me if
[1:07:24] thou Wilt take the left hand then I will
[1:07:27] go to the right
[1:07:29] or if they'll depart to the right hand
[1:07:31] then I will go to the left
[1:07:34] and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld
[1:07:38] all the plane of Jordan that was well
[1:07:41] watered everywhere before the Lord
[1:07:43] destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah even as the
[1:07:47] garden of the Lord like the land of
[1:07:49] Egypt as thou comest unto zoah
[1:07:53] then lot chose him all the plain of
[1:07:56] Jordan and Lot journeyed East and they
[1:07:59] separated themselves the one from the
[1:08:03] other just listen to that attitude thank
[1:08:05] you Uma listen to the attitude of a
[1:08:07] keeper he he he doesn't put himself
[1:08:10] first
[1:08:11] he says Lord
[1:08:13] I understand it he didn't take he didn't
[1:08:15] say this but this is what you can see
[1:08:17] Abraham knew that he's senior
[1:08:20] he's his uncle
[1:08:22] in our culture the small one don't
[1:08:25] choose first before the big hour
[1:08:27] you know first bondsman's always choose
[1:08:29] first sorry about about that attitude of
[1:08:31] Facebook
[1:08:33] first ones okay the Elder one chooses
[1:08:36] first you can't let Talia choose first
[1:08:38] before Tiana
[1:08:42] you can't ah
[1:08:46] now
[1:08:48] Abraham also knew that it is not Lord
[1:08:50] who God called him
[1:08:52] it is him
[1:08:55] and Abraham knew also that he also needs
[1:08:58] green grass for his heads
[1:09:01] he knew all these things
[1:09:03] but what did Abraham say
[1:09:06] he said if you go to the left let's not
[1:09:08] fight for we are brethren
[1:09:11] probably the the guise of Lord are the
[1:09:14] ones who started
[1:09:15] I'll find out when I get there
[1:09:18] I think they started
[1:09:20] why why Lord the spirit or the spirit of
[1:09:24] us wanting to have everything you can
[1:09:26] see it now when they are their owner
[1:09:28] chooses he's looking at the Green River
[1:09:31] and everything you can see it that could
[1:09:32] have been the spirit that was on the
[1:09:34] Saints and his family
[1:09:35] he was better and best God calls Abraham
[1:09:38] and Lord wants to take
[1:09:42] now he looks he said man what a lovely
[1:09:45] man he said okay
[1:09:46] I must choose first or thank you
[1:09:49] he doesn't say no never Uncle no ways
[1:09:52] he doesn't say that he doesn't say uncle
[1:09:55] I can I was never called by God
[1:09:58] I'm not a prophet
[1:10:01] you go in fact you tell me where to go
[1:10:04] that's what Lord's attitude should have
[1:10:06] been
[1:10:07] then him he said ah yeah thank you Uncle
[1:10:11] and then he said like this you know
[1:10:13] those proud people brother and he told
[1:10:14] us about right
[1:10:16] he said yeah
[1:10:18] this thing is worrying me Uncle anyway
[1:10:21] you should be choosing but I'll choose
[1:10:24] anyway I'll choose you know with pride
[1:10:28] I'll choose and go
[1:10:30] and he's looking
[1:10:33] it's just that your guys are actually
[1:10:35] wrong
[1:10:37] it's going on and on and on
[1:10:40] then eventually as he's looking don't
[1:10:43] know how many days Abraham gave him two
[1:10:45] shoes he must have given he was an
[1:10:46] adjustment
[1:10:48] he chose the best location
[1:10:50] even to the Garden of God like Egypt
[1:10:53] the Bible says he chose that best
[1:10:57] and that was
[1:11:00] Sodom and Gomorrah towards the east
[1:11:04] towards his Road LED towards Sodom
[1:11:10] okay okay and Abraham said okay sure
[1:11:12] I'll take I'll take this side if you
[1:11:14] take the East obviously Abraham took the
[1:11:16] West
[1:11:17] because the gospel moved from the East
[1:11:19] to the
[1:11:21] right so he went to that West didn't you
[1:11:24] hear he said if you just left I choose
[1:11:25] right if you should so able to help
[1:11:27] myself gone to the West that is why
[1:11:30] today even the brother brother said I've
[1:11:32] got a yearning to go to the West
[1:11:35] is the end so she's off my boy who's
[1:11:37] there oh it's outside sorry
[1:11:41] I thought it's one of my children
[1:11:45] sorry about that
[1:11:47] I thought it was you Jonah
[1:11:50] now
[1:11:53] Shalom team
[1:11:55] goodbye go to the east then he took the
[1:11:59] less apart or what appeared to be lesser
[1:12:01] and a little did Lord realize that what
[1:12:05] is not good in your eyes is good in the
[1:12:08] eyes of the Lord surely God will even
[1:12:10] tend that desert for Abraham into a
[1:12:13] magnificent career
[1:12:15] Hallelujah
[1:12:16] do you understand what I'm trying to get
[1:12:18] it
[1:12:19] now do you always want to take first
[1:12:22] do you always wants to bless you
[1:12:24] yourself first
[1:12:25] When you pray when you think you always
[1:12:27] want you know the more you bless other
[1:12:30] people first
[1:12:31] it come it will come to pass that you
[1:12:33] get blessed before you even mention your
[1:12:36] name he said in the scripture even
[1:12:37] before you ask I will answer you so do
[1:12:40] not waste time praying for yourself
[1:12:43] first
[1:12:44] I'm not saying don't pray for yourself
[1:12:46] but please cry
[1:12:49] really
[1:12:50] for your brother and your sister
[1:12:53] best priority

[1:12:58] mic next door
[1:13:00] sorry we okay let's finish this Row
[1:13:03] first hopefully there will be more
[1:13:05] scriptures for you to read if finished
[1:13:07] next time
[1:13:08] you'll be like the kiss
[1:13:10] who's honest volunteer we're going to
[1:13:12] read sister test um Matthew 26.
[1:13:16] and we are looking at the story of uh I
[1:13:19] think is Judas
[1:13:21] in Jesus
[1:13:25] Matthew 26.
[1:13:29] start from 48 yes yes please 48.
[1:13:37] you got it yeah now now that we betrayed
[1:13:40] yeah yeah that one now that he betrayed
[1:13:43] him gave them a sign saying whomever I
[1:13:46] shall kiss that same is he hold him fast
[1:13:50] you you yeah
[1:13:54] he's called colludas yeah the one that
[1:13:57] I'm going to kiss a kiss is a beautiful
[1:13:59] thing you you you you you you you
[1:14:01] Embrace someone he's saying the one that
[1:14:04] I'm going to kiss
[1:14:05] Judas
[1:14:07] conniving
[1:14:08] go on my sister
[1:14:11] and for where they came to Jesus and
[1:14:13] said hell master and kissed him
[1:14:17] Jesus said unto him friend where
[1:14:20] wherefore art thou come
[1:14:23] then came they and laid hands on Jesus
[1:14:26] and look at them look at these two
[1:14:28] characters
[1:14:29] he is coming to destroy him
[1:14:32] what does Jesus say to him
[1:14:35] Fred
[1:14:39] of all things
[1:14:41] friend I was gonna say what do you want
[1:14:43] now
[1:14:45] yes finish
[1:14:48] I'm dying anyway
[1:14:51] probably many of us would have been
[1:14:52] overtaken by emotions
[1:14:56] God forbid I wouldn't I shouldn't have
[1:14:58] done that
[1:14:59] but Jesus said friend and I believe he
[1:15:01] meant it there's foolish people sorry to
[1:15:04] mention that way but with this attitude
[1:15:06] that says no Jesus was sarcastic it was
[1:15:09] not a sarcastic he meant it
[1:15:12] he meant all poor thing friend come
[1:15:16] are you ready to come do your thing
[1:15:18] who are The Seekers who are you seeking
[1:15:21] I'm here my dear friend
[1:15:23] he meant friend
[1:15:25] you'll see now
[1:15:29] and
[1:15:30] okay so that is if you are okay you can
[1:15:32] pass it to next one to finish off the
[1:15:33] other 51 and 52 if you are okay unless
[1:15:36] you want to eat it up and behold one of
[1:15:38] them which were with Jesus stretched out
[1:15:40] his hand and Drew his sword and struck a
[1:15:43] servant at the high priest to smote off
[1:15:46] his ear
[1:15:47] then said Jesus on to him put up against
[1:15:50] thy sword into his his place for all
[1:15:54] they that take the sword Shall Perish
[1:15:56] with the sword what they keep up
[1:15:59] what day keeper is he
[1:16:02] then one from his was on Camp the one
[1:16:05] who's not even a betrayer Peter he
[1:16:07] slashes the ear quickly it was him he's
[1:16:10] fighting a physical one
[1:16:11] because he said oh my friend we keep we
[1:16:14] don't kill
[1:16:16] we are the keepers
[1:16:18] of our brothers
[1:16:19] we don't cut we don't cut their ears
[1:16:23] stop him pick up the ear
[1:16:26] and he puts it and he then preached that
[1:16:29] you know Peter in that sermon that
[1:16:31] sermon should have struck home
[1:16:34] he told him he who the way that you
[1:16:38] slash your brother with a sword
[1:16:42] remember that be very careful
[1:16:44] the way you think about your brother the
[1:16:47] way you conclude the way you go on and
[1:16:50] on and on you and the devil
[1:16:54] or the way that you bless your brother
[1:16:56] you go on and on and bless him uplift
[1:17:00] him that way that's gonna be your
[1:17:02] destiny of eternal life
[1:17:05] there's no other way you say law
[1:17:08] of how things work the tree falls to the
[1:17:13] side where it is leaning
[1:17:15] you bless
[1:17:16] you get blessed
[1:17:17] you cares
[1:17:20] that's that's what the Lord says here
[1:17:23] he's saying you're telling him he says
[1:17:25] remember that then Jesus said Jesus said
[1:17:28] then said Jesus unto him put up again
[1:17:31] thy sword he was reprimanding Peter
[1:17:34] into his place for all they that take
[1:17:38] the sword Shall Perish with the sword
[1:17:42] well silly he was telling him even for
[1:17:45] future
[1:17:46] and Peter got it later on
[1:17:48] until they crucified him
[1:17:51] Peter would have fought a feather later
[1:17:53] on but no no that time he got it
[1:17:55] it was revealed for him so bless more
[1:17:59] bless hundred percent
[1:18:02] yeah
[1:18:03] then you are a keeper you are of the
[1:18:06] opposite of Cain
[1:18:08] if you do that
[1:18:10] you're gonna jump to the next example
[1:18:12] let's go this side let's start from the
[1:18:14] back my friend you'll be the finisher
[1:18:16] that was there there so we take an
[1:18:19] example of the the prodigal son and his
[1:18:21] brother
[1:18:23] I just want to show you these three
[1:18:24] examples brothers and sisters so that we
[1:18:27] can put our spiritual jacket and apply
[1:18:30] them to our life today
[1:18:33] on more of spiritual things
[1:18:37] your brother come from the world
[1:18:41] from drinking from doing all sorts of
[1:18:43] things and you saw him and you had him
[1:18:46] how is your attitude towards him
[1:18:50] how is your attitude to your sister or
[1:18:52] your brother about the things that he or
[1:18:55] she gave you as a testimony and you
[1:18:58] start to allow the devil to think like
[1:19:00] about him that way or about her when
[1:19:02] their testimony was about praising God
[1:19:06] let's hear a man in the church a man in
[1:19:10] the ministry you'll hear now where he
[1:19:12] was this man he was preaching in the
[1:19:15] field let's read it to Mama Landing Luke
[1:19:18] 15 25-29
[1:19:20] now his eldest son was in the field and
[1:19:22] as he came and draw night to the house
[1:19:25] he heard music and dancing hold on a
[1:19:27] second where was he
[1:19:30] wishing this man
[1:19:32] he was working hard
[1:19:34] denominational or chairs whatever
[1:19:36] Pentecost about he was a Domini
[1:19:41] [Laughter]
[1:19:43] you are the minister
[1:19:45] and then he come he hear this noise of
[1:19:48] dancing
[1:19:49] say man this people government
[1:19:52] men in the Church of the Living God what
[1:19:54] are they doing
[1:19:55] remember brother Branham did the same
[1:19:57] so that girl dancing in the spirit of
[1:19:59] the Lord and density
[1:20:03] Prophet said ah
[1:20:04] this girl come on
[1:20:06] David they blamed you
[1:20:10] ah
[1:20:12] now if you can't dance that brother and
[1:20:14] you don't don't criticize you
[1:20:16] okay if you can't dance like him at
[1:20:19] least go to him to teach you his step
[1:20:21] how he does it no one who deals like
[1:20:23] brother in if you don't know don't
[1:20:25] criticize him
[1:20:27] can I say my brother I want to be in
[1:20:30] Symphony with you how how do I do it
[1:20:33] so because the moment the moment you go
[1:20:36] negative you open up for the Devil the
[1:20:38] slightest smallest thought
[1:20:40] in the presence of God brings a big
[1:20:42] devil not a small devil so there's the
[1:20:46] the the the the sanctuary as we get in
[1:20:49] the presence of God is supposed to be so
[1:20:52] sober
[1:20:54] so sober
[1:20:56] just like when you come to preach you
[1:20:58] must be so sober so silver
[1:21:01] that I'm thinking of no one I I must be
[1:21:05] muted
[1:21:07] the minister must be muted and let God
[1:21:11] the moment I I'm preaching about Ben I
[1:21:14] must sit there
[1:21:17] I'm not fit to stand here and God will
[1:21:19] punish me for that I must be sober and
[1:21:22] clueless let the spirit of God
[1:21:25] speak
[1:21:27] that's how a minister should be
[1:21:29] right
[1:21:31] and now this man he hears the music
[1:21:34] there is a jubilee in the house
[1:21:37] that is dancing and happiness
[1:21:40] and he comes
[1:21:43] with my sister from verse 26.
[1:21:45] and he called one of his servants and
[1:21:48] asked what these things made and he said
[1:21:51] unto him thy brother is come and thy
[1:21:54] father has killed the fatted calf
[1:21:56] because he has received him safe and
[1:21:58] sound
[1:21:59] and he was angry and would not go in
[1:22:02] therefore came his father out and
[1:22:05] entreated him and he answering said to
[1:22:08] his father love these many years do I
[1:22:11] serve thee neither transgressed I at any
[1:22:13] time thy commandment and yet though
[1:22:16] never gave us me a kid that I might make
[1:22:19] Mary with my friends can you hear that
[1:22:21] denominationalist spirit
[1:22:24] who are you your brand name is
[1:22:26] who you just come now
[1:22:29] you know the church started in Asia
[1:22:31] Council we have been in this business
[1:22:33] for long
[1:22:34] we have found many denominations who are
[1:22:36] you to start it yesterday you didn't
[1:22:38] even go to a Bible School
[1:22:41] who are you and that's what that man is
[1:22:44] saying we have been you know you know we
[1:22:46] go to these churches like the one that
[1:22:48] mokoma called us the the church in the
[1:22:51] church you see this is Justice these
[1:22:54] people are along and everything is
[1:22:56] organized even the walls the tiles on
[1:22:59] the the churches are you know they they
[1:23:01] have been far long in this business
[1:23:04] they know how to change
[1:23:07] and how to build their church and how to
[1:23:09] be you know
[1:23:11] and then when they read everything is
[1:23:13] organized and there's someone Hallelujah
[1:23:20] everything is organized
[1:23:22] they are church people they know how
[1:23:24] then you come here and you say you are
[1:23:27] going to be telling us to bring life
[1:23:30] you're going to impart eternal life who
[1:23:31] are you hey this man for many years he's
[1:23:35] asking the father he the Bible says it
[1:23:37] he entreated his father I don't know
[1:23:40] what's the meaning of that we didn't
[1:23:41] treated Andy what does it mean David to
[1:23:43] intake you know and I'm sure he was
[1:23:45] talking serious business he called his
[1:23:49] father to a meeting
[1:23:51] but no ways this doesn't work this way
[1:23:55] for how long did I save you and I never
[1:23:59] transgressed against you
[1:24:02] isn't it fair in New Zealand we say fair
[1:24:05] enough fair enough yeah
[1:24:07] fair enough what this man is asking
[1:24:11] but this man is the eyesight is limited
[1:24:15] so little
[1:24:19] to where he can see
[1:24:21] about the riches
[1:24:22] about the wrongs of his brother
[1:24:25] he can't see eternal life
[1:24:27] you can see beyond what his father can
[1:24:29] see
[1:24:30] Beyond see over see what God sees about
[1:24:33] your brother
[1:24:35] see what God sees understand about your
[1:24:38] sister and your brother what God
[1:24:40] understands about them
[1:24:42] are we together
[1:24:43] so that is the story of this wonderful
[1:24:46] man who did everything to the letter
[1:24:49] and he forgot that the letter killeth
[1:24:54] he forgot
[1:24:56] he is supposed to be a life preserver
[1:25:00] I don't know
[1:25:02] what was he going to do if the report
[1:25:04] came home
[1:25:05] and they said your brother has died in
[1:25:07] the uh
[1:25:09] swine pen
[1:25:11] they found him dead for three days and
[1:25:14] he was rotten
[1:25:15] so he was even gonna say he must not be
[1:25:18] buried here he must be buried there
[1:25:21] that's attitude
[1:25:23] he must not even be brought here what do
[1:25:25] you think that he must not be that boy
[1:25:27] he's
[1:25:29] careless
[1:25:30] he must be buried there with the pigs he
[1:25:32] mustn't be brought here too his cop does
[1:25:34] not belong to be buried on our ground
[1:25:37] that's what this man was gonna say if he
[1:25:39] the report came home that your brother
[1:25:41] who taken all his riches and he went
[1:25:44] away we had a report that he was
[1:25:46] butchered by the criminals after he
[1:25:48] finished all the money they took some of
[1:25:50] the money they killed him and he was in
[1:25:53] sin he died in sin this man was gonna be
[1:25:55] happy
[1:25:57] is that what me and you are supposed to
[1:26:00] be today
[1:26:02] we are supposed to be very happy See
[1:26:05] Beyond
[1:26:07] my brother's faults see beyond the
[1:26:10] perceived because remember everything
[1:26:12] that the devil is blaming you it's just
[1:26:14] perception it's not reality everything
[1:26:17] that the devil you think the Devil Makes
[1:26:19] you to do that and you blame yourself as
[1:26:21] brother Ben always say is him he make
[1:26:24] you to blame yourself he questions and
[1:26:27] make you to blame yourself and then
[1:26:28] saves you
[1:26:31] that's what he does
[1:26:34] so
[1:26:35] we're gonna close with the last
[1:26:37] scripture
[1:26:38] and what did I say I did it you're gonna
[1:26:41] allow mom
[1:26:43] because it's the last scripture
[1:26:45] sorry baby next time

[1:26:52] let's go oh yeah there's two of them
[1:26:53] sorry yeah you can have a chance let's
[1:26:55] go for the one first on the right sister
[1:26:57] Shannon Genesis 37 27.

[1:27:14] let's hear about
[1:27:16] his brothers first
[1:27:18] I I decided to put them together
[1:27:21] let's hear about Genesis 37 27.
[1:27:26] 27 yep Come and Let Us sell him to the
[1:27:30] is ishmaelites and let not our hand be
[1:27:33] upon him for he is our brother and our
[1:27:36] flesh and his Brethren were content
[1:27:39] then they're passed by midianites
[1:27:42] merchantment and they drew and lifted up
[1:27:45] Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to
[1:27:47] the ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver
[1:27:50] and they brought Joseph into Egypt
[1:27:56] oh yeah thank you so much did you hear
[1:27:58] that kind of a reasoning they they they
[1:28:01] went to sugarcoat they are conscious
[1:28:03] they said Remember the boy is in the pit
[1:28:07] he suffered in the weather is bitten by
[1:28:08] a Mamba whether it's broken on his leg
[1:28:10] fractured his spine they just threw him
[1:28:12] there they don't care but now they say
[1:28:15] ah because it's our brother they knew
[1:28:18] he's their brother but no no no guys
[1:28:20] let's make our eyes comfortable because
[1:28:22] it's our blood
[1:28:24] let's let's tell him so that because
[1:28:26] it's our flesh it's flesh of our flesh
[1:28:29] but no no let's not save him
[1:28:32] I thought they would say ah because it's
[1:28:34] our brother no no no guys let's repent
[1:28:35] man this guy let's take him out so how
[1:28:38] can you say the Flesh of your flesh
[1:28:40] you're not taking him out to save him
[1:28:43] you'd rather sell him for why are you
[1:28:45] selling him so that your conscious can
[1:28:46] be bad that's the reason why
[1:28:49] night
[1:28:55] did you see them that they sell him in
[1:28:57] Chains
[1:28:59] go
[1:29:00] why they do that why why they don't just
[1:29:02] leave him die in there they want to
[1:29:04] comfort their conscious their guilt
[1:29:07] they want to say oh yeah no no he didn't
[1:29:09] die out of our hands
[1:29:12] think who are they fooling
[1:29:14] who are they fully
[1:29:17] now let's go to the last scripture the
[1:29:19] Genesis 45 let's hear about the keeper
[1:29:22] of life our identity our represent our
[1:29:27] forefather you and me
[1:29:30] let's hear what him what what does he
[1:29:32] say when the same people
[1:29:35] who would have killed him
[1:29:38] let's hear what he said
[1:29:40] Genesis 45 3-5
[1:29:43] and Joseph said unto his Brethren I am
[1:29:46] Joseph doth my father yet love and his
[1:29:48] Brethren could not answer him for they
[1:29:51] were troubled at his presence and Joseph
[1:29:53] said unto his Brethren come near to me
[1:29:55] let us listen to that come near what
[1:29:59] you
[1:30:01] I mean is that real Is that real this is
[1:30:04] out of this world man this is out of
[1:30:07] this world this is the keeper of his
[1:30:10] brother
[1:30:11] read on my brother
[1:30:13] and like I'm near and he said I am Joyce
[1:30:16] of you brother whom he is sold into
[1:30:19] Egypt now therefore be not grave nor
[1:30:22] angry with yourselves that ye sold me
[1:30:24] Heather for God did send me before you
[1:30:27] to preserve life
[1:30:33] I'm so blessed by the story of Joseph
[1:30:35] I'm so blessed by the story of Joseph
[1:30:37] because
[1:30:39] not even a drop of anger
[1:30:43] when he reminds them of what they did
[1:30:46] he's telling them instead no no what you
[1:30:48] did was all right
[1:30:49] Is that real brother Isaac
[1:30:52] what you did was alrighty
[1:30:55] to sell me yeah yeah you know a child of
[1:30:58] God take the things that his brother
[1:31:00] does and he lift him up with those
[1:31:03] things
[1:31:04] he doesn't say Yaya I know you are bad
[1:31:06] man
[1:31:07] no no no it's just no my friend you know
[1:31:11] that was to give God the glory wow
[1:31:14] yeah what matters is now because me and
[1:31:18] Andy we say we saved the now God what
[1:31:21] matters is now
[1:31:23] not what you did not what I did we
[1:31:25] served there now what matters he saved
[1:31:28] you now
[1:31:30] that man that we spoke about previously
[1:31:33] instead of saying what matters is that
[1:31:36] my brother is back he says no no no no
[1:31:38] no no no no no he took his riches
[1:31:43] yeah can you see the difference yeah
[1:31:45] yeah Joseph
[1:31:46] he says come come closer to me
[1:31:49] amen I mean that that was that was
[1:31:53] the most powerful
[1:31:55] backslaughter I've ever come across
[1:31:59] have you ever felt it
[1:32:01] if you want to give someone a real
[1:32:03] Pakistan
[1:32:04] don't revenge on them treat them well
[1:32:09] and leave the rest to God
[1:32:11] a sensible person will repent and feel
[1:32:14] pain because that's very painful backsla
[1:32:16] you do me bad and I come to you I say
[1:32:19] come
[1:32:21] the bed for you
[1:32:23] the food for you and yeah you can take
[1:32:25] my car I'll take a bus to the station
[1:32:27] use my car then and then I can
[1:32:31] I'll take your bus because the bastard
[1:32:33] stops my destination you take my car and
[1:32:35] use it but yesterday you you wanted to
[1:32:38] shoot me
[1:32:40] that's what Joseph did yeah
[1:32:42] and all these things that we are talking
[1:32:44] about I would like us to take them and
[1:32:46] convert them to the spiritual Realm
[1:32:49] what are those things that I am doing to
[1:32:52] lift up my brother spiritually to make
[1:32:55] sure that I help my brother and my
[1:32:58] sister to see Jesus to be in heaven
[1:33:01] what is it that I'm doing I'm thinking
[1:33:03] about my life daily
[1:33:06] eternal life is living for others
[1:33:10] how do we do that now the first thing I
[1:33:13] want to say is Jesus never lived for
[1:33:16] himself
[1:33:17] his life was spent off for others that's
[1:33:20] perfect that's perfectly eternal life
[1:33:24] so
[1:33:25] if I do all spiritual good things and
[1:33:28] bring people you know in Daniel chapter
[1:33:30] 12. you say those that led many to
[1:33:33] righteousness will shine like stars on
[1:33:35] that day you know that scripture
[1:33:38] so so
[1:33:40] eternal life
[1:33:41] is living for others forget about
[1:33:43] yourself
[1:33:44] and here I'm talking about a spiritual
[1:33:47] life
[1:33:48] it's all right to give me a suit I love
[1:33:50] it
[1:33:51] that's what we must do and believers do
[1:33:53] that but we are we go a little
[1:33:56] higher
[1:33:58] eternal life is living for others what
[1:34:00] my life
[1:34:01] my life must be so salty that it can
[1:34:05] lead people into heaven when I leave
[1:34:07] when I talk
[1:34:09] you know yesterday a customer sweat at
[1:34:12] me so much
[1:34:13] until my team member came to me and said
[1:34:15] are you okay Samson you know that I
[1:34:18] found out that that team member
[1:34:19] her name was Grace
[1:34:21] [Laughter]
[1:34:24] except to me
[1:34:27] to the call I said yes you know in the
[1:34:29] morning meetings you know we've got this
[1:34:31] commentary when someone did something
[1:34:33] you go and send a message a feedback to
[1:34:35] the whole company for everybody to see
[1:34:37] what happened and how so she sent that
[1:34:39] message unbeknown to me
[1:34:41] how I handled that man until at the end
[1:34:44] of the call that man apologized and
[1:34:46] cried to me
[1:34:48] and and the lady the lady's name is
[1:34:50] Grace
[1:34:51] so so we we need to be able
[1:34:55] to to live our life until people come
[1:34:57] and ask Ben
[1:34:59] how do you do it
[1:35:02] how do you live like this
[1:35:05] man I remember we used to dance together
[1:35:08] but tell me how do you change like this
[1:35:11] what make you change
[1:35:12] you say you say to them come and see
[1:35:15] that's how we must live our lives when
[1:35:18] those that know me that I used to run
[1:35:20] around and do all sorts of rubbish when
[1:35:23] they see me standing here they say ah is
[1:35:25] that
[1:35:28] then I say yes
[1:35:29] I must live my life to a point where it
[1:35:32] can take people into heaven
[1:35:34] it can make people to want to love Jesus
[1:35:37] to want to associate with Jesus it must
[1:35:40] be an oasis my life
[1:35:44] giving life to people
[1:35:46] I'm finishing
[1:35:48] when you say you go to church and you do
[1:35:51] good things that's fine
[1:35:53] but when you live your life to yourself
[1:35:55] you haven't eternal life you have not
[1:35:58] I'd like to put each other that way you
[1:36:00] have not heaven is not it's not it's
[1:36:02] just like I jump it's like I jumped the
[1:36:04] weight not
[1:36:07] eternal life is living for others it it
[1:36:09] proved it when it came in the lamp of
[1:36:12] God
[1:36:13] he took his life and gave it to us
[1:36:19] and you receive eternal life by
[1:36:22] receiving that day and you don't live
[1:36:24] for yourself no more you live for others
[1:36:32] hmm that's what eternal life is
[1:36:36] and I would like to say to you
[1:36:38] not is one thing to and I would like to
[1:36:41] re-emphasize is one thing to give people
[1:36:43] all the wonderful things that are
[1:36:45] suffering and give them food and share
[1:36:47] with them that is scriptural we must do
[1:36:50] that but we've passed that that is like
[1:36:53] year eight
[1:36:56] which is good you cannot go to
[1:36:57] irritating without passing Aid that is
[1:37:00] necessary
[1:37:02] but we are now past year 13.
[1:37:05] we are now astronauts we are no more
[1:37:08] taking off like an airplane we are
[1:37:10] astronomical isn't it we are now flying
[1:37:14] beyond the ozone if you if there's
[1:37:17] something like that we are in the solar
[1:37:19] system now
[1:37:21] where nobody can be
[1:37:23] we are orbiting with the planets
[1:37:27] where the space only spaceships can go
[1:37:29] where if anyone go there you die because
[1:37:32] there's no Oxygen for you there there
[1:37:34] there's only connection of of heavenly
[1:37:37] oxygen only and you have to have the
[1:37:39] right pipe to connect if you are there
[1:37:41] you'll die yeah yeah you can't fly there
[1:37:43] if you are not in the relevant suit
[1:37:45] space suit and everything you'll die
[1:37:48] so when they go there beyond the skies
[1:37:51] beyond all in space
[1:37:54] you know they have got oxygen connect
[1:37:55] they don't breathe oxygen over here
[1:37:58] when they are there no they don't
[1:38:00] breathe oxygen of Earth they are too far
[1:38:03] from Earth
[1:38:04] isn't it they've got their own little
[1:38:06] tanks of oxygen and we saw them there on
[1:38:09] the movement okay pumping on the on on
[1:38:11] air you know when you are a Believer
[1:38:13] astronomical you you walk on air
[1:38:16] that's what they do I'm strong in them
[1:38:19] right didn't you see them even though
[1:38:21] they say is hoax but but at least we've
[1:38:24] had an idea the drama test is so well
[1:38:27] at least we have an idea of how to walk
[1:38:31] on air you know we saw them with oxygen
[1:38:34] they that's a type of who we are we are
[1:38:37] way above that us
[1:38:39] we live for others we die for others
[1:38:42] come to a point where you can be ready
[1:38:44] to take a bullet for your brother
[1:38:48] who thought about that protecting my
[1:38:51] back and you know
[1:38:53] if I get shot I'm taking a shot for you
[1:38:55] boy you make sure that you take
[1:38:58] right that's what we do to take a bullet
[1:39:00] for real
[1:39:02] can you take a blame for your brother
[1:39:05] I think that's part of what I'm talking
[1:39:07] about
[1:39:08] huh say I don't know brother leave it on
[1:39:11] me
[1:39:12] I like brothers when we go for for meals
[1:39:15] they say our brothers on me I like that
[1:39:16] kind of Brothers
[1:39:20] now listen to this as we finish listen
[1:39:23] to this
[1:39:24] do something good for someone
[1:39:27] if you want God if you want to do
[1:39:29] something for God huh if you want to do
[1:39:32] something for God do something for his
[1:39:34] people
[1:39:35] if you want something good said about
[1:39:38] you you say something good about someone
[1:39:40] else
[1:39:42] bless so someone else and you as you are
[1:39:47] blessing someone else you are blessing
[1:39:49] God for Jesus said in so much as you
[1:39:52] have done unto this list of this my
[1:39:55] little ones you have done unto me
[1:39:58] so we know that that's the truth so may
[1:40:01] the Lord Jesus bless us tonight
[1:40:04] now as we read his weight
[1:40:07] you cannot want to be blessed when you
[1:40:10] are not blessing others
[1:40:11] and the promise is if you bless others
[1:40:14] you are going to be blessed
[1:40:17] in God you just jump in in a in a bowl
[1:40:20] of the cream of God
[1:40:22] you're in there just by blessing people
[1:40:25] you find yourself swimming inside the
[1:40:27] cream of God's blessings and you don't
[1:40:29] know which way to eat
[1:40:31] isn't that lovely just by simply
[1:40:34] blessing God's people protecting them
[1:40:36] ensuring that they are well that their
[1:40:39] spiritual well-being is well
[1:40:43] wonderful physical well-being spiritual
[1:40:45] well-being
[1:40:46] get worried if you don't see your
[1:40:48] brother in church find out hey my
[1:40:50] brother I didn't see you in church today
[1:40:51] are you okay I've been praying for you

[1:40:57] in your private space you are your
[1:40:59] brother's keeper

[1:41:02] so we are taking it with a spiritual
[1:41:04] application I want to put it to a
[1:41:06] spiritual application now this code you
[1:41:09] see everyone even all the denominations
[1:41:11] I've already mentioned this all the
[1:41:13] unbelievers they can do all good things
[1:41:16] they can do nice things to everyone and
[1:41:18] much more there's no one who can be a
[1:41:21] philanthropist more than Bill Gates
[1:41:23] they do those things
[1:41:25] they give billions
[1:41:27] for for Mahala there
[1:41:30] I read somewhere where Warren Buffett
[1:41:32] said oh no no I don't need six piece I
[1:41:35] just want one bit at a time I need one
[1:41:37] car at a time
[1:41:39] and I need one house at a time
[1:41:41] what do I do with six base because I
[1:41:44] can't sleep on them at once that was the
[1:41:47] richest man one of the richest people he
[1:41:49] said that those those third statement
[1:41:51] but let's get a little bit higher our
[1:41:55] spiritual actions I'm talking more about
[1:41:57] spiritual activities and I'm talking
[1:42:00] more not things that you do in a group
[1:42:03] to be seen as an individual in your
[1:42:07] private space in your private thinking
[1:42:09] capacities alone
[1:42:12] are you keeping your brother

[1:43:47] children to know that we give the other
[1:43:50] chick

[1:46:25] judgment and whosoever shall say unto
[1:46:29] his brother
[1:46:30] Rucker and be danger of the council but
[1:46:35] who whosoever shall say thou full be in
[1:46:40] danger of Hell Fire we hear that
[1:46:43] never say to someone stupid or raka or
[1:46:47] whatever
[1:46:47] because you will be in danger of Hell
[1:46:49] Fire
[1:46:50] never
[1:46:53] I cannot over emphasize
[1:46:56] last person I think Debbie raised a hand
[1:46:58] decide was it you Debbie or who was it
[1:47:02] huh sorry I volunteered for you then
[1:47:05] read that one Michael sorry about my
[1:47:06] presentation tonight I don't know what
[1:47:08] happened there
[1:47:09] a
[1:47:11] I must have done it from Samsung and
[1:47:13] this is Apple
[1:47:15] [Laughter]
[1:47:18] so read for me that last chapter that
[1:47:20] last verse and then we go home
[1:47:23] can you see that one what is it brother
[1:47:25] Ed that last scripture is a h
[1:47:30] Romance
[1:47:32] I think it's Romance
[1:47:36] yeah I think it's Romans 14 I'm sorry
[1:47:39] here I don't see and it's affecting them
[1:47:41] is it thank you and everyone read that
[1:47:45] one my my girl
[1:47:47] Romans 14 I can read it for you if you
[1:47:49] can so then everyone every one of us
[1:47:53] shall give account of himself to God
[1:47:56] let us not therefore judge one another
[1:47:58] anymore but judge this rather that no
[1:48:01] man put a strong a stumbling block or an
[1:48:04] occasion to fallen in his brother's way
[1:48:07] I know and am persuaded by the Lord
[1:48:09] Jesus that there is nothing unclean of
[1:48:11] itself but to him that esteemeth
[1:48:14] anything to to be unclean to him it is
[1:48:17] unclean But If thy brother be grieved
[1:48:20] with thy meat now walk us thou not
[1:48:22] charitably destroy not him with thy meat
[1:48:25] for whom Christ died
[1:48:29] huh that last part
[1:48:33] not then you're good be evil spoken of
[1:48:37] for the kingdom of God does not meet and
[1:48:39] drink but righteousness and peace and
[1:48:41] joy in the Holy Ghost
[1:48:43] see this is the spiritual part now can
[1:48:46] you see the things that matters is not
[1:48:48] meat suit
[1:48:51] oh you didn't call me oh no no you never
[1:48:54] invited me or you invited me oh no you
[1:48:57] never called me for Auntie Mario oh you
[1:48:59] called David the kingdom of God is not
[1:49:01] for Sagittarius
[1:49:05] or meat no I don't eat chicken I eat
[1:49:07] fish no no that's not the things of the
[1:49:09] kingdom of God and that's what the
[1:49:11] things that we offend one another with
[1:49:13] useless things brother Isaac said those
[1:49:16] things don't matter yeah
[1:49:18] whether I wear a purple shirt like my
[1:49:20] brother today or is that Pingo people or
[1:49:23] I wear a blue one
[1:49:26] it does not matter the point I'm trying
[1:49:29] to say brothers and sisters is that if
[1:49:32] that is an issue for me I must bring it
[1:49:36] to the Lord in prayer seriously so
[1:49:38] because I believe he's serious and my
[1:49:40] brother is in the wrong it's time for me
[1:49:42] to kneel down it's time for me to cry
[1:49:45] until I win my brother until that thing
[1:49:48] changes until my brother can connect to
[1:49:50] my energy I was gonna speak about sound
[1:49:53] and energy tonight but the Lord said I'm
[1:49:55] not done with that same one I was gonna
[1:49:57] talk about sound and energy I was so
[1:49:59] blessed on Sunday when the Pastor said
[1:50:01] you know you know the sound has got
[1:50:04] waves I almost jumped off of the roof
[1:50:09] so brothers and sisters there are things
[1:50:11] that matters
[1:50:12] and there are things that doesn't matter
[1:50:15] Kane should have repented he killed his
[1:50:18] brother for nothing
[1:50:20] simply because he was too proud
[1:50:23] he was too angry he was too jealousy he
[1:50:27] was too hatred full or whatever the name
[1:50:29] is he had hatred
[1:50:31] and Abel did nothing wrong
[1:50:34] he did nothing wrong brother
[1:50:36] and he killed him for nothing he
[1:50:38] destroyed his character and he killed
[1:50:40] him and God said ah I'm warning you sin
[1:50:44] is waiting for you
[1:50:45] and you can control it
[1:50:48] but you can take it can win you if you
[1:50:50] are not careful he was given a chance
[1:50:52] God is such a keeper
[1:50:55] he even wanted to give Kane a chance
[1:50:57] knowing very well that he is the son of
[1:50:59] the devil he still want to say again you
[1:51:01] can repent man I can accommodate you
[1:51:05] just believe in me
[1:51:07] and he came and said no I don't know
[1:51:09] what you're talking about
[1:51:10] I don't know what I did to my brother
[1:51:12] you don't know what
[1:51:15] that's what he says I don't know what I
[1:51:17] did to my brother
[1:51:18] he was so rude
[1:51:21] amen may the Lord bless you tonight
[1:51:23] brothers and sisters the purpose of this
[1:51:25] sermon is not to
[1:51:27] try to
[1:51:30] get on you or reprimand you
[1:51:33] the purpose is that as a family we need
[1:51:35] to come sometimes and be friends with
[1:51:37] one another and talk about these things
[1:51:40] and encourage there will come a time
[1:51:42] when the pastor will come and teach us
[1:51:43] and and teach us about you know Heavy
[1:51:46] Deep things and we learn there's
[1:51:48] teachers among us but sometimes this you
[1:51:51] know I like talking about the Loose Ends
[1:51:54] sometimes those must be cut
[1:51:56] must give life to one another
[1:51:58] who must promote one another
[1:52:00] who must lift up one another beyond what
[1:52:04] the flesh can think
[1:52:06] that's our thinking and God bless you
[1:52:08] tonight
[1:52:09] it's my prayer may the Lord bless each
[1:52:12] one of you and we are going to pray
[1:52:15] and you want to stand up and stretch
[1:52:17] your feet or you'd like to sit down
[1:52:20] okay musicians can come
[1:52:23] I believe musicians can come
[1:52:25] and then we're going to read the prayer
[1:52:27] requests
[1:52:28] and then we will we will pray together
