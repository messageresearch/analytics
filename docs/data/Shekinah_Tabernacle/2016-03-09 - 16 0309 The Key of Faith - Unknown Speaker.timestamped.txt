[32:14] the divine nature having escaped the
[32:16] corruption that is in the world through
[32:19] lust amen hallelujah and then we'll go
[32:21] to Revelations chapter
[32:26] 3
[32:27] and then we'll go to uh Revelations
[32:33] 3:7 and it says here and to the angel of
[32:37] the church in Philadelphia right these
[32:40] things saith he that is Holy he that is
[32:42] true he that hath the Key of David he
[32:45] that openeth and no man shutteth and
[32:47] shutteth and no man openeth I Know Thy
[32:50] Works behold I have set before the an
[32:51] open door and no man can shut it for
[32:54] thou Hast a little strength and Hast
[32:56] kept my word and has not denied my name
[33:01] amen may the Lord bless his word you may
[33:02] be seated amen now I want to I want to
[33:05] take a just a uh couple of a couple of
[33:09] uh words there from that scripture we
[33:11] read in second Peter about exceeding
[33:14] exceeding great and precious promises
[33:17] now this is not a service of positive
[33:19] thinking but God has given us something
[33:22] in this age that is very different you
[33:24] know it's incredible when you just when
[33:26] you just listen to the message in you
[33:27] and you just see how it unfolds not only
[33:29] not only does it unfold to you but it's
[33:32] it's unfolding to the prophet of the
[33:33] Lord as God is revealing himself and
[33:36] it's incredible that we could be
[33:37] standing here in this age where the word
[33:39] has become open to us you know we're not
[33:41] we're not just you know we're not
[33:43] wondering who we are we're not wondering
[33:45] what Jesus has done you know we we know
[33:48] who we are in Christ amen we know our
[33:50] position in Christ and we know what God
[33:52] has made us and and it's important
[33:54] because you know we have we have as as
[33:57] as brother Bram he heard brother Neville
[33:59] preach and he and and brother Neville
[34:01] preached about it's like a big arcade
[34:03] it's like a big you know you know you go
[34:05] into the arcade then you have a look
[34:07] around you know what's there and what
[34:09] belongs to you and it's the same thing
[34:10] with the word of God you know we should
[34:12] look into the word to see what belongs
[34:14] to us amen we shouldn't just say it
[34:16] looks nice and isn't that pretty isn't
[34:18] that neat we should go in see what
[34:20] belongs to us and try it out amen it's
[34:23] like if you had your favorite kind of
[34:25] store and you said here's the you can do
[34:27] whatever you want you just wouldn't open
[34:29] the front door and close again say that
[34:31] was neat you'd go in there amen you'd
[34:33] take supplies with you and you'd say hey
[34:35] I'm busy for a few probably a few years
[34:37] maybe I don't know and you would open
[34:39] every box you'd try everything
[34:42] Hallelujah and you'd probably try it
[34:43] till it breaks the things you really
[34:45] like amen so now we you know you just
[34:48] take that and you take it into the word
[34:49] of God we have exceeding great and
[34:51] precious promises and I read that
[34:54] scripture in um in Revelations there
[34:56] because we must understand that the ages
[34:59] lap from one into another and so the
[35:01] blessings of all the evil and everything
[35:03] that's been building from the first age
[35:05] has built down to now and all the
[35:08] blessings to the believer have built
[35:09] from the first age down to now and so
[35:12] when when it was declared to the
[35:13] Philadelphian age there you know we know
[35:15] this is John Wesley Age The Great
[35:17] missionary age that age overlaps into
[35:19] this this age and so Jesus now is saying
[35:23] behold I set before you an open door and
[35:26] that open door we understand where Jesus
[35:29] would say in John chap 10 he'd say I am
[35:32] the door amen he says I am the door to
[35:34] the Sheep amen so this door that was set
[35:36] before them was an escape out of the
[35:39] world saying now I'm going to open a
[35:40] door of Revelation that you can escape
[35:43] this world and he was actually saying
[35:45] this open door cuz he is the door and
[35:47] this is the age because the you know the
[35:49] the Revelation and the baptism of the
[35:51] name of Jesus Christ that was before
[35:53] isusa Street amen it was right at the
[35:55] end of that uh Philadelphia age where
[35:58] these things were unfolding so God was
[36:00] now declaring behold I I set before you
[36:02] an open door that no man can shut and yo
[36:05] y he yo let's just I'm going to read
[36:07] that again because we must understand
[36:09] the devil cannot take anything from us
[36:12] amen amen he says here he that is true
[36:16] and he at the Key of David and he that
[36:18] shutteth no man I mean he that openeth
[36:20] and no man shutteth and shutteth and no
[36:23] man openeth so what he's saying is that
[36:25] what whatever God has revealed the devil
[36:27] can't take it away from the bright amen
[36:29] the devil can't steal what is what is
[36:31] your god-given rights Hallelujah he
[36:33] can't he can't steal God back away in
[36:35] history amen if he has if he has
[36:38] revealed himself in this age and he has
[36:40] Hallelujah then then then the devil
[36:42] can't smother him away amen so what God
[36:45] has opened the devil cannot shut and
[36:47] what and what God has shut the devil
[36:49] cannot open Hallelujah so we have we
[36:52] have an exceeding great and precious
[36:54] promises in this age now I just want to
[36:57] read this is really the door now brother
[37:00] B preaches a a service and it's called
[37:03] the key to the door amen yes sir the key
[37:05] to the door there's only one door and
[37:10] that is Jesus Christ amen he is the door
[37:13] amen amen so there's only there's only
[37:15] one door now I'm just going to read this
[37:18] this is basically my whole sermon is in
[37:19] this right here and I just because I was
[37:21] thinking you know in the Book of James
[37:23] be not just hearers of the word but
[37:25] doers and sometimes we think do is asn't
[37:28] dress right speak right clean up your
[37:30] house but a do is actually putting this
[37:32] word into action amen where Faith puts
[37:34] legs on and actually lives out the word
[37:36] that is being a doer of the word
[37:38] hallelujah where where where you're sick
[37:40] you say buy Stripes I'll be made well
[37:43] amen and you actually put legs on your
[37:45] faith it's not just speaking about it
[37:47] but actually lay hold that's right
[37:48] Hallelujah of what belongs to you amen
[37:52] hey we've got an arcade I've heard this
[37:53] before we've got an arcade have you
[37:55] searched that well I I've gone down this
[37:57] aisle hallelujah what about this aisle
[38:00] amen what about oh I've been healed what
[38:02] about this aisle amen amen well I
[38:04] believe my own salvation go down this
[38:06] island what about the salvation for your
[38:07] family amen because because brother Ram
[38:10] tells the same Faith you have for
[38:12] yourself to get saved apply to your
[38:14] family
[38:16] Hallelujah yes sir he says there's not
[38:18] another name given under heaven whereby
[38:21] you must be saved only through the name
[38:23] of Jesus Christ no church no
[38:25] denomination no read no do doctrines of
[38:28] anything only through jesus' name this
[38:32] is the key amen amen no wonder Peter
[38:36] could use one of them on the day of
[38:37] Pentecost they wanted to know how to get
[38:40] into that door he used the key and
[38:43] there's only one key because there is
[38:46] only just one door I am the door Jesus
[38:50] said and Peter had the key to it and he
[38:52] said now he's going to show how the keys
[38:54] used he says repent everyone one of you
[38:56] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[38:59] Christ for the remission of your sin and
[39:01] you shall receive the treasures of God
[39:04] it's the key to the door and Jesus is
[39:07] the door there's only one door to
[39:09] healing and Jesus is that door there's
[39:12] only one door to peace yay my peace I
[39:14] give you he's the only door to genuine
[39:17] peace you might think you've got peace
[39:20] you might accumulate enough money to buy
[39:22] your home you might accumulate enough
[39:24] money to get your children clothes have
[39:26] food to eat but you might have
[39:29] accumulated enough popularity to be
[39:31] popular amongst people but when you slip
[39:34] off your shoes at night and get ready to
[39:36] lay down there's only one thing can give
[39:39] you peace that is if you know you were
[39:43] dying that night there's only one peace
[39:45] that's Jesus is the peace he is our
[39:48] peace he is our healing I am the Lord
[39:51] thy God that heals all your diseases he
[39:53] is the door to Heaven there's no other
[39:56] the door or no other way but through
[39:58] Jesus Christ he is the door to heaven
[40:01] and now Jesus is the door of all these
[40:04] things and faith is the key that unlocks
[40:07] the door now if Jesus is the door to all
[40:10] these promises Faith now I just wish I
[40:13] had this in you know massive massive
[40:15] text here right here faith in his
[40:17] finished work unlocks every door to
[40:21] every treasure there is inside the
[40:24] kingdom of God see the key is Faith is
[40:27] the key that unlocks every promise he
[40:29] makes the key of Faith does that faith
[40:32] in his finished work it's these keys
[40:35] that we're speaking on right amen so
[40:38] faith in his finished work amen we'll
[40:40] open every door we'll open the door un
[40:42] need Hallelujah faith in his finished
[40:46] work because we see that you know when
[40:48] Adam and Eve were upon the Earth before
[40:49] there was sin they had Direct communion
[40:51] with God they had perfect Fellowship but
[40:54] then sin we know made a Chasm and it
[40:56] separ separated God and man but then
[40:58] when Jesus came he reconciled heavens
[41:00] and earth am mean heavens and earth are
[41:01] reconciled in one man amen hallelujah
[41:05] and then so and so he had to give us
[41:08] life to bridge that Chasm that as we as
[41:11] we uh as I mentioned the quote last
[41:13] Sunday that his blood puts us back on
[41:16] speaking terms again it puts us back in
[41:18] that condition amen so it's his finished
[41:20] work that Bridges the chasm that God and
[41:23] man can become one again and that man
[41:26] could have that key of Faith again and
[41:28] open the door of everything they have
[41:30] need of cuz we see Adam Adam you know he
[41:33] had control over the Earth he could just
[41:35] speak and things would move amen because
[41:39] Jesus demonstrated everything Adam lost
[41:41] Jesus was demonstrating everything that
[41:43] he had amen he he had control over
[41:47] nature he had control over life he
[41:49] brought you know he he everything he was
[41:52] in Supreme control over everything in
[41:55] his environment
[41:57] amen even even the you know the soldiers
[42:00] and things that came to get him in the
[42:01] Garden of Gethsemane they didn't you
[42:03] know they didn't take him he says I give
[42:06] my life I Lay My Life down no no man
[42:08] takes it from me but I lay it down and
[42:11] the prophet says you can say
[42:14] that amen you can actually say that
[42:17] because if he if that was the man what
[42:20] about the woman if he was under Supreme
[42:22] control are he following me if he is
[42:24] under Supreme control and you read that
[42:25] in the Garden they all come in with
[42:27] their swords and their staves and armed
[42:28] men and and he just asked a question who
[42:31] do you seek Jesus Nar us I here they all
[42:34] fall down backwards then they get back
[42:36] up who do you seek Jesus of Nazareth and
[42:38] they fall back down amen he had to
[42:40] actually get consent to be taken amen
[42:43] that's right Hallelujah here's here's
[42:45] the devil coming in the power of
[42:46] Darkness Amen to take our Lord and he
[42:49] had to actually consent for for for them
[42:50] to take him away amen cuz he was and
[42:53] that was remember in the garden the left
[42:56] him he went from that before that moment
[42:59] he went as a man cuz God can't die you
[43:02] following me amen so he was he had
[43:06] Supreme control over every
[43:08] circumstance
[43:11] hallelujah amen and then now he he
[43:14] demonstrated that because he's going to
[43:16] he demonstrating to a people in the end
[43:18] time this is how you're going to be and
[43:21] he showed this in the life of the
[43:22] Prophet amen amen where where sure you
[43:25] can see maturing through his ministry
[43:28] but he came to a point where he could
[43:29] Master every
[43:31] circumstance that's right
[43:33] amen you see you hear the bar you know
[43:35] you know you know you hear the
[43:37] testimonies that say you know he just he
[43:39] just knew how to handle every situation
[43:42] why is that because he's a man who has
[43:43] had Mastery over every
[43:45] circumstance amen that's and that was
[43:49] done to show this is what you're going
[43:50] to become amen hallelujah hallelujah so
[43:55] now the the key of Faith opens every
[43:58] door every Divine promise is opened by
[44:00] the key of
[44:02] faith and this is very important to us
[44:05] because we must understand that God in
[44:08] this end time has taken away all the
[44:09] Creeds and dogmas amen he's taken away
[44:13] everything that is a lie of the Creeds
[44:15] of man and he's taken it away that man
[44:18] is not believing into a church you know
[44:20] through a church and through that church
[44:22] they might receive you forgiveness of
[44:24] sins but now he's taken that away that
[44:27] God that man can have a genuine faith in
[44:30] the genuine Lamb of God amen amen
[44:33] Methodist have their own interpretation
[44:35] of the Bible and they believe that but
[44:37] it's Creeds of man mixed with the
[44:39] scripture and you know you take that to
[44:41] every denomination there's the Creeds of
[44:43] man have mixed in that and the people
[44:45] believe that amen but there came a time
[44:49] where God would do away with the Creeds
[44:50] of man and he would reveal himself
[44:52] saying here is the Lamb of God that
[44:54] takes away the sin of the world Amen
[44:56] amen amen hallelujah so now it actually
[44:58] takes away it takes away what God I mean
[45:01] what man has added to it and so and this
[45:04] is very important you say well why is it
[45:06] why do it matter what we believe Jesus
[45:08] said by teaching the Commandments and
[45:10] doctrines of men you make the word of
[45:12] God no effect to the people amen so that
[45:15] means if you teach the pure word of God
[45:17] you make the Commandments of God
[45:19] effective to the people amen so now
[45:22] we're not believing in we're not
[45:24] believing just in in the cre of man or
[45:26] the mind of a man but God has revealed
[45:28] himself therefore because if I believe
[45:32] in the if I put my faith in the wrong
[45:34] thing I'm not going to get the results I
[45:36] think I should get amen right but if you
[45:39] put your faith in the right thing then
[45:41] you get the results you believe you
[45:43] should get am amen right so if if he has
[45:47] revealed himself and you put faith in
[45:49] him amen then you will get the results
[45:52] you need amen amen amen he says
[45:57] this in the Feast of the trumpets he
[46:01] begins to speak about you know you the
[46:03] two witnesses of of of Moses and Elias
[46:06] he says in Revelations 11 call their
[46:08] ministry will be the ministry of Moses
[46:10] and Elias calling to Israel out of
[46:12] Jewish Traditions just as the seventh
[46:15] Angel's message called The Bride out of
[46:17] the Pentecostal tradition remember Moses
[46:20] and Elijah is to call Israel out of the
[46:22] old atonement of the lamb and sheep and
[46:25] blood and goats and sacrifice to the LI
[46:28] to the Real Living Sacrifice to the word
[46:31] and the seventh Angels message under the
[46:33] same trumpet same exact everything the
[46:35] same seal as to what call the people the
[46:38] bride out of the Pentecostal and World
[46:40] tradition to the genuine atonement the
[46:43] word Christ impersonated in his word had
[46:46] made flesh Among Us amen so he's saying
[46:49] that Malachi for's Ministry is to turn
[46:51] the people from Creeds and dogmas to a
[46:53] genuine faith in God Amen Hallelujah am
[46:55] because if you're trying if you're
[46:57] probing the wrong door you're going to
[46:58] get the wrong thing that's right amen so
[47:01] just like if I wanted to get into my
[47:03] house but I'm trying to get to the next
[47:04] door neighbor's house well I'm not going
[47:06] to get into my house right and many
[47:08] people unfortunately think they have the
[47:09] key of Faith but they're trying to put
[47:11] it in the wrong door that's right amen
[47:13] and they're not getting the results they
[47:15] think they should be getting well why
[47:17] not because they're putting the key of
[47:18] faith in the wrong door that's why
[47:20] people need to stop and look at their
[47:22] lives why are not things being produced
[47:24] you know you can take that individually
[47:26] Church wherever you say why why are
[47:28] things not being how they should be well
[47:31] what door are they putting the key in
[47:33] amen is it genuine revelation of the
[47:35] hours that things man's injected right
[47:37] amen so now if we have that genuine if
[47:40] we have the genuine door remember the
[47:44] door is Jesus Jesus is the word we have
[47:46] the genuine door do you believe it amen
[47:47] amen do you believe it's been declared
[47:50] amen so if we if we have the genuine
[47:52] door amen and we have faith to open that
[47:56] door then everything that God has for us
[47:59] is available amen amen we have the
[48:02] ability to open because remember he says
[48:04] he says here that faith in the finished
[48:07] in his finished work will open every
[48:11] what does that Encompass every promise
[48:14] of God Amen faith in his finished work
[48:18] remember in the Old Testament when the
[48:20] worshipper brought the lamb to the
[48:22] priest the priest wasn't looking at the
[48:24] worshipper
[48:26] even if he knew him and oh that's Jones
[48:28] from down the road and this is where
[48:29] he's from and you know he wasn't looking
[48:31] at him he looked at the lamb and if the
[48:33] lamb was accepted the worshipper was
[48:36] accepted amen the worshipper didn't even
[48:38] come into account of it it was the lamb
[48:41] Hallelujah it was the lamb that was
[48:43] accepted and that's all the priest was
[48:44] worried about and if the lamb was
[48:47] accepted the worshipper was accepted
[48:49] amen hallelujah so that's why it's not
[48:51] faith in you he said faith in his
[48:53] finished work faith in what he did on
[48:55] Calvary will open every promise to you
[48:59] Hallelujah hey we don't need to worry
[49:01] about what you know how good we think we
[49:03] are you know we have to we have to come
[49:05] to a place like Jacob did Jacob Jacob
[49:10] knew he wasn't worthy to receive the
[49:12] birthright but he just denied himself
[49:15] covered himself in skins and and denied
[49:18] his own self when he came in before his
[49:20] blind prophet Daddy he says who is that
[49:22] he says I'm your I'm your son Esau and
[49:25] then he felt them all over you you feel
[49:29] like Esau you you smell like Esau but
[49:32] you sound like Jacob you sure you Esau
[49:34] yes I am he denied his own self he had
[49:38] no right to receive that Birthright
[49:40] that's right amen you had no right to
[49:42] receive the birthright either amen but
[49:44] he covered himself in skins he denied
[49:46] himself amen and God has provided a
[49:48] covering in this end time Hallelujah the
[49:51] blood of the Lamb to cover you amen that
[49:53] you can deny your own self you may be
[49:55] around school it doesn't matter you know
[49:57] when the wedding Feast is being called
[49:59] Amen Hallelujah Jesus makes up a parable
[50:01] he speaks about the feast and he says he
[50:04] says you know you know a king great king
[50:06] Had A Feast for his son you know a great
[50:08] feast and he says call the good call the
[50:11] bad amen it comes down remember the
[50:13] first set They didn't accept their
[50:15] invitation then they went to the highway
[50:17] you you they went to another place is
[50:18] there's still room go to the highways
[50:20] call the good call the bad call the
[50:23] indifferent it doesn't matter amen
[50:24] hallelujah it doesn't matter what
[50:26] condition we think we're in have you
[50:29] received the invitation yes I received
[50:31] my invitation amen Jacob had to deny his
[50:34] own self even if he thought he was
[50:36] better than Esau he had to deny his own
[50:38] self he had to put on a charade to get
[50:41] what he needed that's right amen and you
[50:43] may think you don't deserve it but that
[50:45] doesn't matter amen you got to deny your
[50:48] own self and say I am righteous amen I
[50:52] am actually worthy to receive what I've
[50:54] come to get amen that's what that's what

[1:10:48] look like our brains well what makes
[1:10:50] them so intelligent they have they have
[1:10:52] an intelligence
[1:10:54] that other men can't tap into but yet
[1:10:56] you know some you know they say that man
[1:10:58] only uses not you know man doesn't use
[1:11:00] 100% of his brain that's right amen but
[1:11:03] other people can seem to tap into things
[1:11:05] and make themselves well they just are
[1:11:06] born as a genius because they tap into
[1:11:09] things amen we're not called to tap into
[1:11:12] 1% of
[1:11:14] God Amen we're called to tap into 100%
[1:11:17] of God amen
[1:11:20] amen I'll just leave you with this
[1:11:22] question how how much of him do you want
[1:11:25] amen amen well I've been walking this
[1:11:27] way many years how much of him do you
[1:11:29] want amen Enoch walked with God and he
[1:11:33] was not Hallelujah and that is our type
[1:11:37] he walked with him glory how does
[1:11:39] someone how do you get to know someone
[1:11:41] in a manner of speaking you walk with
[1:11:42] them you spend time with them they speak
[1:11:45] to you you speak to them amen and that
[1:11:48] was Enoch Enoch's great thing was he
[1:11:50] walked with God wherever God would take
[1:11:52] him he just walked with
[1:11:54] God Amen and that's the great big secret
[1:11:58] as well just walk with him and every and
[1:12:01] well well brother Tim DoD said it at
[1:12:03] Camp he said when his first wife died
[1:12:05] and and he was in the middle of that
[1:12:06] trial he said I'm going to look around
[1:12:09] because I May Never Walk This Way
[1:12:11] Again amen and to me it's like if you go
[1:12:15] and and and and I and this came to my
[1:12:18] was up at brother Freddy's it's like if
[1:12:19] you just say went to some big Museum
[1:12:22] there's a big difference in the tour
[1:12:24] if if one of their um art directors took
[1:12:27] you on the tour and pointed out all the
[1:12:29] paintings and said this is who painted
[1:12:31] this this is what it's about and this is
[1:12:32] how old it is and all these things and
[1:12:34] they can point out all the pieces of art
[1:12:37] but then if you just went in there by
[1:12:38] yourself with no idea you maybe say that
[1:12:40] was neat that wasn't neat I didn't like
[1:12:42] that then you'd walk out but you
[1:12:43] wouldn't get the full impact of the tour
[1:12:45] of the building amen it's the same thing
[1:12:48] in a trial if you don't look around and
[1:12:51] see now why is this happening what yo
[1:12:53] what's going on over here if you don't
[1:12:54] sit and look around you won't get the
[1:12:55] full impact of what God is trying to
[1:12:57] teach you in the
[1:12:59] trial
[1:13:00] amen that's why when things are good
[1:13:03] look
[1:13:04] around Lord what are you trying to teach
[1:13:06] me when things are good because he
[1:13:07] doesn't just try and teach you things
[1:13:08] when things are bad and then when things
[1:13:10] are bad definitely look
[1:13:12] around amen not just not just in here
[1:13:15] but look around here see what's going on
[1:13:18] why situation like this Lord what are
[1:13:20] you trying to teach me through this that
[1:13:22] you know that happened other day look
[1:13:25] around amen and he'll show you what's
[1:13:27] going
[1:13:28] on and that's important because as I
[1:13:31] said if you don't do that if you just
[1:13:33] kind of oh I hope this gets better and
[1:13:34] you walk along you won't receive what
[1:13:36] he's fully trying to get you to
[1:13:39] see amen it's the same thing that's why
[1:13:42] I you must open every
[1:13:45] door amen every Divine promise we have
[1:13:48] the key of Faith amen amen don't be
[1:13:52] afraid to open the door and get what you
[1:13:56] need amen maybe I just leave it
