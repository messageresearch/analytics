========================================

Amen. But you see now our wounds, God wants to use our wounds. God uses our wounds to bring us to a position. But does he really? Yeah, he does. This is Esther. Esther was an orphan girl. That's a big wound. I was blessed enough to to to to have both parents in the same house growing up. They're still together. Thank the Lord. Right. And my my my mom's parents were next door to us growing up and also my great uncle. So, I had I had I had a wonderful family circle around me growing up. So, I don't know what it's like to not have a mama or a dad or be an orphan, but it's a big hole. God can fill that hole, right? God is father to the fatherless, right? But you see now she was so this wound came into her life where she was an orphan. But God allowed, you know, isn't it amazing? God allowed Israel to fall in idolatry. You got to look at the domino effect to get Esther here. It's a big domino effect, right? It started off with with the split of the kingdoms with the son of Solomon and you know Jeroboam and Riaboam. Jeroboam made the two golden calves. Idolatry came in. All there's a domino effect starting to come. But the whole reason God allowed it is because a son of Aag and Amalachite had to be taken care of. This is this is Hmon. He was the Agite, the son of, you know, he's an Amalachite, the ancient enemy of the Jews, right? So now God allows this domino effect to come that finally we have this scene hundreds of years later. But you see her wounding caused her to be raised in Shusham. Her wounding caused her to be an orphan. Her wounding caused her to be there and then be picked. Wasn't married for whatever reason. We don't know, right? But God allowed all that to happen that she would end up in this position as queen of of of the superpower of the age. And she was carrying this secret of her identity. I am the bride. I'm the queen. The king by his grace has placed me in this position. We're carrying this mystery, too. The devil looks at you and can't quite see it, just like he couldn't quite see our Lord Jesus on the cross being the Messiah himself. But he is carrying the mystery of redemption. And then here, here comes Esther. She's carrying this mystery. This is what to me is so beautiful about the message. It reveals who God is. It reveals who you are. It also reveals who Satan is. Right? And so now here is here is Esther. This is at the second banquet of wines. And between the first and second banquet, the king can't sleep. And the book comes open. The record comes open about Mori saving the king's life. So what happens? The seals come off the book. And then and then when the seals come off the book, there's a whole role reversal goes on because in the beginning of this whole scene, the Jews are under a death sentence. But at the end of it, after the book comes open, Hmon's under the death sentence. Hallelujah. Amen. So now the book comes open. Esther stands in her God-given position carrying this mystery. Heymon, I know who you are. You're an Amalachite. You're my enemy. Isn't it amazing? She came out of the tribe of Benjamin. Saul was out of the tribe of Benjamin. King Saul. Saul did not finish the job like he was told to. So God raised up someone of that same tribe to break that stigma and finish the job. Amen. It's like many things in our lives from our forebears, they could not overcome. But God raises you up. Amen. To break that thing. Amen. that you would stand on its head and prove Satan, you put this in my lineage, but I'm going to finish it by the power of God. Hallelujah. Amen. So, there she is. She's carrying the secret. The king doesn't know who she is. Oh, she's Esther, a star. She was more than that. She was Hadassa one hidden. I think it means star. Esther means star, right? And then so finally, now she's carrying this mystery. I know who my enemy is. I know who I am. And then she reveals the whole thing to the king in order to turn the wrath of the king against Hmon. Praise the Lord. And then he his whole scheme of making the gallows against Mori. He hangs on his own scheme. He hangs on his own gallows. He's lifted up high. And then now what's happens? The signant ring that that that Hmon was given by the king is now in Esther's hand. And she has the authority and power to write a new law which overcomes what Hmon has already given. Amen. All because of wounds. She ended up there because of w I know there's probably a small you got to look at the magnitude of her life. Maybe just go think about these things. But God allowed those wounds to get her there that salvation would come to her people. Life would be preserved. And I'm going to close with that. How much you and I you say well I don't understand my life. We don't necessarily need to understand everything that happened in our life but we need to come to a peace in our hearts. God, you've allowed it that life would be preserved. That you can take these wounds, Lord, and manifest yourself through them. That they're a testimony now that they can help someone else. Amen. So, thank God for the wounds. Amen. Thank God. Lord, you want to prove yourself in the wounding. No one likes pain, but we got to count it all joy. There's a purpose in the pain. There's a purpose in the wounding. Can we have the musicians, please? Um, tonight I'll finish there. I've been a bit long. Sorry.
