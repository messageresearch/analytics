[20:13] Laurey
[20:15] [Music]
[20:20] [Applause]
[20:23] [Music]
[20:26] okay you may have your seats now Liz
[20:28] she's right here to give you the safety
[20:30] introduction thanks welcome welcome to
[20:36] forest lakes and I've got the really
[20:38] boring mundane pass of the health and
[20:40] safety if you do need to evacuate
[20:44] anywhere because of a fire or something
[20:47] else out on the playing field along the
[20:50] fence by the driveway where you came in
[20:52] but on the field side there is different
[20:55] venue names and numbers the numbers
[20:58] relate to the cabins that you're in and
[21:00] so if you line up over there then then
[21:04] they can check you off easily and know
[21:05] that you're not lost and know that they
[21:08] don't have to look for anybody the fire
[21:11] alarms are around the camp they don't
[21:13] actually connect to the fire brigade so
[21:15] you will need to dial one one one from a
[21:18] mobile phone if you're using one of the
[21:21] camp phones you'll need to dial nine
[21:23] before you ring one one if it's an
[21:28] earthquake
[21:30] it's comes down to common sense if you
[21:32] can get underneath something that's
[21:34] going to protect you that's great
[21:36] otherwise they say near a wall but not
[21:39] near a window and a little bit of hope
[21:43] for the best because we're not quite
[21:44] sure what happens in an earthquake all
[21:49] of the activities around camper
[21:51] out-of-bounds
[21:52] but there's not many children here at
[21:53] the moment but at least as an adult
[21:55] supervising them then they're generally
[21:57] out of bounds and the plague room went
[21:59] playground we asked for common sense a
[22:02] trampoline here's a hundred kilo weight
[22:04] limit on it so if you're gonna get two
[22:07] teenagers on there they're probably too
[22:09] heavy and we'll just say one if it's
[22:12] littler children in the weight limit is
[22:14] 100 kilos and the tire swing is for
[22:17] people and we recommend on the
[22:20] roundabout just one person pure little
[22:23] triangular section it's in there if you
[22:28] want to go swimming mean you're welcome
[22:30] to swim in the pole we ask that you
[22:31] don't swim in the light just because if
[22:34] you get into danger it's really dark and
[22:36] it's really hard to find you if you go
[22:39] missing in the air there plenty rubbish
[22:41] burns around the camp so please put your
[22:43] rubbish in the air
[22:46] generally we say if you can keep the
[22:48] noise down after 10 o'clock that's
[22:50] really great especially because we're in
[22:52] a bit of a hollow here and it travels up
[22:54] the hills out to the neighbors and we
[22:57] don't want to annoy it too many of them
[22:59] the other thing that's just started
[23:01] happening it camp again as its hasn't
[23:03] happened in the last few days because
[23:04] I've got colder I was going to say is
[23:06] it's got warmer as the mosquitoes have
[23:09] come out and we can't do anything about
[23:10] those because of the lake so we suggest
[23:13] that if you have your light on in your
[23:15] cabin
[23:16] you have your doors and windows shut so
[23:20] don't walk away and leave the door open
[23:21] and the lights on because you'll have
[23:23] company when you come back so just
[23:26] remember turn your light out if you're
[23:28] going to have your windows or doors open
[23:31] if you need stuff to clean and toilet
[23:35] paper and things like that just outside
[23:36] our camp office and the octagonal
[23:38] building is as the double-dog cupboard
[23:42] in this penny a toilet paper and stuff
[23:44] in there if you're in cabins 1 to 8 in
[23:47] the bottom of the Roundhouse those ones
[23:51] are slightly tricky because they have a
[23:54] cardboard core in the middle of them and
[23:56] that 8 toilet paper pulls out from the
[23:58] centre and so if it's during the day
[24:01] then grant or I will be around camp and
[24:03] we'll we have to help you tomorrow
[24:06] morning I'll be in Palmerston North for
[24:07] cricket but the rest of the time will be
[24:10] about any questions that you've got and
[24:14] we're in the office feel free to ask us
[24:16] otherwise feel free to ask being or one
[24:19] of the team because they've got
[24:21] information on how to contact us if
[24:24] we're not yeah if we're not about these
[24:29] guys have seen out the toilets over and
[24:31] here just for ladies and at the end of
[24:34] the book when you go back over the
[24:35] bridge there's a concrete block building
[24:38] against the bank over there that's the
[24:40] toilets for the mean the other place
[24:42] that there are communal toilets is
[24:44] underneath the chairman
[24:46] Capel building past the swimming pool
[24:48] over it came um other than there I
[24:50] haven't got anything else to say except
[24:52] to have a fabulous weekend

[25:23] be a Christian and when I'm blessed to
[25:26] be a Christian because I can walk

[25:37] makes me one of them I'm gonna think of
[25:39] the blessings that he's bestowed on my
[25:42] life and when I begin to think of those
[25:44] things I become thankful it just happens

[25:47] him in your heart and then wherever you
[25:49] go you just begin to rejoice I'm sure
