[47:39] times shall come
[47:41] that's all I wanted to read from that
[47:43] one and I want to go also just had this
[47:45] other scripture on my heart 2nd Timothy
[47:48] 3 verse 11 and they say seeing that all
[47:54] these things shall be dissolved what
[47:56] manner of persons ought we to be and all
[47:58] holy conversation and godliness I mean
[48:02] you can um take your seats this morning
[48:08] praise the Lord what a great atmosphere
[48:10] that we're in this morning amen it's
[48:15] it's nice to be in an atmosphere where
[48:20] you feel the Spirit of God because we're
[48:21] the Spirit of the Lord is there's
[48:22] Liberty
[48:23] we we can be free to actually just let
[48:29] the Lord have control not free to just
[48:31] do whatever we want to do essentially
[48:34] weak we can just let the Lord do what he
[48:35] wants to do because in that atmosphere
[48:38] we understand that our ideas and our
[48:41] thoughts and that uh they finite they
[48:45] fail all the time they fail so many
[48:47] times but his thoughts and his ways
[48:48] never failed so when we can get in an
[48:50] atmosphere where we can just let his
[48:51] thoughts and his ways have control then
[48:54] we are at peace
[48:55] and where there's someone likes to admit
[48:57] it or not we're all sheep we're all
[49:00] sheep and if I could put it in a even
[49:03] stronger context we're all dumb sheep
[49:06] you know what I mean so the more we
[49:09] realize that the more God can move in
[49:11] our life now sometimes likes that type
[49:13] of ourselves is where there's some great
[49:15] I know we made in the image of God but
[49:18] we're a dumb sheep and the more we
[49:20] acknowledge that we need a Shepherd in
[49:22] the more enrich their lives become and
[49:24] the more the more he can have control
[49:28] amen so I've had this thought on my
[49:32] heart that I've wanted to bring and I'm
[49:35] glad the atmosphere is like this this
[49:36] morning because it's this time there are
[49:40] a lot of ideas there's a lot of
[49:43] perception there's a lot of information
[49:45] on
[49:47] what's happening on in the world and
[49:50] some people say it's going good some
[49:51] people say it's going beard some people
[49:52] say this is the way it's gonna go this
[49:53] way that way that way yet God has told
[49:56] us there is a way that it is going that
[50:01] really it's for his bride that knows the
[50:03] way that it's actually going and and I
[50:07] believe I'm speaking to as bride this
[50:08] morning that is on a certain road that
[50:12] leads to the rapture that leads to
[50:13] eternity that's what I believe this
[50:16] morning that's the group that we're
[50:18] speaking to now if we were speaking to a
[50:19] different group we would probably say it
[50:21] this is happening all that's happening
[50:22] but with this group and we're a special
[50:26] group we're not we're the family of God
[50:29] we're not actually part of any other
[50:31] family because when it's all said and
[50:34] done an eternity we're going to be with
[50:36] the family of God it doesn't matter what
[50:38] country you come from what race you are
[50:40] nothing like that it's irrelevant what
[50:42] culture you're from all that it's
[50:43] irrelevant there's there's there's one
[50:46] Lord one baptism one faith is one body
[50:48] of Christ and that's that's who we
[50:51] belong to and you know all the world was
[50:54] like that there wouldn't be any problems
[50:55] here yeah but it's not okay so I wanna
[51:01] talk this morning now some of us not
[51:04] going to be very spiritual but it will
[51:05] be spiritual I want to make us realize
[51:08] that what we're living in and in this
[51:11] atmosphere you can catch it more it's
[51:13] we're not in a picnic when we're not in
[51:16] good times these are not good times at
[51:20] all whatsoever and there is not much of
[51:25] a future for the world as we understand
[51:28] it and we have to as believers settle
[51:32] that in our minds that it's not just
[51:34] going to go on forever it's not just
[51:37] going to happen then we can make our
[51:38] plans and fall and carry them out it's
[51:41] not going to be like that and as we see
[51:45] that they're approaching there's a
[51:46] certain way that I believe that we are
[51:49] commanded that we have to be as we see
[51:50] all these things unfolding we can't
[51:53] really just carry on and no let me just
[51:55] plan my career plan this plan that I
[51:57] know we always have to back that up and
[51:58] say but you've got to do that but you
[52:00] know what
[52:01] and I don't want to get radical here but
[52:03] in the book of Acts they didn't give a
[52:08] they didn't care did they what they had
[52:11] was worth more than this more than that
[52:16] that's what they did I sold everything
[52:19] they just serve God it was under that
[52:22] time we they didn't quite realize the
[52:23] day they were living in
[52:24] we know the day we're living in and it's
[52:27] and and I just want to this sermon this
[52:30] morning is just - it's been good for me
[52:32] to get together to understand we're
[52:34] actually in perilous time so that may
[52:36] seem like it's nice we're in perilous
[52:38] times
[52:38] absolutely perilous and I can't stress
[52:41] that enough that there is hell unfolding
[52:44] on earth and the error the Bride of
[52:47] Christ is beginning to have no seat at
[52:49] any table anywhere
[52:50] no seat at any table there's no spot for
[52:53] you there's no spot for me here it's
[52:55] becoming no spot on this earth for you
[52:59] and for me I don't want to sound
[53:00] negative but that's the facts and
[53:02] eventually there will be absolutely no
[53:04] spot for us any spot there will be as
[53:07] with them that's the truth I'm gonna get
[53:12] into this because I've got so many
[53:13] slides here I've got about 90 some of
[53:17] them are like videos are for two minutes
[53:21] men you're not gonna like some of it
[53:32] because some of it's just my head that I
[53:33] work things out you know
[53:35] some of you will you'll fall asleep in
[53:37] some parts but wake up and then a more
[53:40] interesting part is this what this isn't
[53:41] going bro we're not getting oh yeah
[53:47] thank you okay all right I want to start
[53:51] back here because I want to bring this
[53:52] in and first this is Paul as he's
[53:54] finished ministering in a certain place
[53:55] and he's going to move on and annex 20
[53:59] verse 28 30 he says take heed therefore
[54:01] unto yourselves and to all the flock see
[54:03] he's talking to all the elders and the
[54:04] the ministers that have been in the
[54:06] certain area that he's been ministering
[54:08] to and setting up the church and Paul
[54:11] has to move on and he's giving them
[54:12] commandment about
[54:14] should act what they should do because
[54:16] he has to leave them for he doesn't know
[54:18] how long any communication in those days
[54:20] was a lot harder than monitors now he
[54:22] couldn't ring all ticks or anything that
[54:24] was once you left it was a long way to
[54:26] get a message back and forth that's why
[54:29] we have the Bible because there were
[54:30] letters that were sent back and forth to
[54:31] the churches but he said take it unto
[54:33] yourselves in to all the flock over
[54:35] which the Holy Ghost hath made you
[54:36] overseers to feed the Church of God
[54:38] which he has purchased with his own
[54:39] blood for I know this that after my
[54:41] departing shall Grievous wolves enter in
[54:43] among you not sparing the flock and also
[54:45] of your own selves shall men arise
[54:46] speaking perverse things to draw away
[54:48] disciples after them now well Paul was
[54:51] there and speaking they were having
[54:52] great revivals there with healings the
[54:55] Spirit of God was falling the the
[54:58] kingdom of God was you could say on a
[54:59] high you know the the atmosphere amongst
[55:01] their believers would have been so good
[55:03] and things were happening and Paul was
[55:05] going around ministering in places and
[55:07] he was training up ministers at work
[55:09] that were receiving the word and going
[55:11] forth and and these things were
[55:13] happening but Paul said when I have to
[55:14] rideapart it's not going to stay like
[55:16] this Grievous wolves shall in surround
[55:18] not sparing the flock in other words
[55:21] this whole thing is going to get torn
[55:23] apart now if I could just put it in a
[55:26] natural perspective outside of saying
[55:29] the spiritual seed that went into the
[55:30] ground from a natural perspective Paul's
[55:33] gospel actually didn't couldn't
[55:38] withstand the onslaught that came on to
[55:40] it if you think about it just in a
[55:42] natural respect that would seem like it
[55:44] actually had so much onslaught towards
[55:45] that the gospel had so much onslaught
[55:47] that it couldn't survive the onslaught
[55:49] there grievious wolves that came and
[55:53] tore the whole thing apart didn't they
[55:55] now this is the manifested gospel of
[55:57] Jesus Christ were talking about here and
[55:59] it had such an answer it couldn't
[56:01] actually withstand the onslaught and I
[56:03] want to show you some of that onslaught
[56:05] that happened to this this gospel so
[56:08] sorry about some of this being smaller
[56:09] had to do some of them small but the
[56:11] bigger ones that I want you to read you
[56:12] can read but these that will just go to
[56:16] a principle of because I always like to
[56:18] go back this one because it's it's
[56:19] important this is a pivotal difference
[56:24] between the Bride of Christ and the
[56:26] Antichrist as is actually
[56:28] who we worship and we worship Jesus
[56:31] Christ which is which is God manifests
[56:33] in the flesh and then him dwells the
[56:34] fullness of the Godhead bodily now we
[56:37] know God fills everything about the
[56:38] fullness of God dwells in Christ and a
[56:40] man Christ Jesus and what's in us is
[56:43] Christ because that whole thing is his
[56:44] name as Jesus Christ so that's and yet
[56:46] you have this the the Antichrist spirit
[56:48] is saying that there are actually three
[56:49] different beings and you can pick which
[56:51] one you want to worship on either either
[56:52] day depending on how you feel confusion
[56:55] and and paganism essentially right
[56:58] that's the that's the Antichrist
[56:59] that's an antichrist spirit so if you
[57:02] want to find out what of what nature
[57:05] something is from you just have to look
[57:06] for this what what are they who are they
[57:10] worshipping because there's another
[57:11] scripture which I'll bring up which says
[57:12] that in the end times Satan will
[57:14] actually be in the temple of God being
[57:16] worshipped as He is God and now this is
[57:18] that this whole thing didn't come from
[57:21] God this three gods did not come from
[57:23] God that we understand it came from
[57:26] another God which is Satan okay so I
[57:29] just want to wring these ones here x2 38
[57:31] you know all these scriptures but I want
[57:32] to read it and then read some other some
[57:34] of the onslaught that came the impede
[57:36] heceta unto them repent and be baptized
[57:38] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[57:39] Christ for the remission of your sins
[57:40] and you shall receive the gift of the
[57:42] Holy Ghost x8 16 says for as yet he was
[57:45] fallen upon none of them only they were
[57:47] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[57:49] Eckstein for Yates's and he commanded
[57:51] them to be baptized in the name of the
[57:53] Lord and they then prayed they him to
[57:56] tarry certain days x19 5 says when they
[58:00] heard this they were baptized in the
[58:01] name of the Lord Jesus now those are the
[58:03] only four examples we have in the book
[58:05] of Acts of baptism okay so this is how
[58:08] they did it based on revelation of this
[58:10] is who Jesus Christ is we know this but
[58:12] I want to let this sink in because it
[58:14] will be apparent later on and Colossians
[58:17] 3:17 says and whatsoever you do in word
[58:19] or deed do all in the name of the Lord
[58:21] Jesus giving thanks to God and the
[58:22] Father by him so if you're gonna do
[58:24] anything doing in his name okay
[58:26] so so that's the gospel that Paul
[58:29] preached was this gospel now this is
[58:33] what they did to Paul in the end Paul
[58:35] was put to death our great champion of
[58:39] the faith came to a miserable
[58:41] pathetic end if you could put it that
[58:43] way he didn't go out like a hero and
[58:46] have this great funeral and they're all
[58:48] celebrating the world came together to
[58:50] celebrate this great man of God he was
[58:51] just put to this somewhere and life went
[58:52] on that's the gospel that's the gospel
[58:57] that's how much the world thinks of the
[59:00] gospel you know there's a scripture that
[59:02] says they wandered about in dens and in
[59:04] caves of the earth destitute of whom the
[59:07] world was not worthy that's how you know
[59:09] he likes to write scriptures we take all
[59:11] the scriptures for us on this side you
[59:13] know I I'm this mighty thing I'm this
[59:15] I'm that that describes us as well that
[59:18] scripture describes us - we will we're
[59:21] destitute in that we're left to just
[59:23] they were this is they were killed by
[59:25] animals there were all these things
[59:26] happen to the believer that that's our
[59:29] part as well of whom the world was not
[59:30] worthy that's that's who we are now this
[59:35] is from the Catholic Encyclopedia the
[59:39] Catholic Answers and I just want to read
[59:40] these things so you can see they began
[59:44] to be an onslaught against Paul's gospel
[59:46] and onslaught though grievious wolves
[59:49] came in and was starting to tear apart
[59:51] the the church and it and it was not
[59:56] directed by the Spirit of God and yet
[59:57] they were all Christian men that were
[59:58] coming in to help and move the kingdom
[1:00:02] of God forward for a sacrament to be
[1:00:05] valid three things have to be present
[1:00:06] the correct form the correct matter and
[1:00:08] the correct intention with baptism the
[1:00:11] correct intention is to do what the
[1:00:12] church does the correct matter is water
[1:00:14] and the correct form is baptizing and
[1:00:16] the name of the Father and of the Son
[1:00:17] and of the Holy Spirit unfortunately all
[1:00:20] not all religious organizations use this
[1:00:21] form in fact Jehovah's Witness sometimes
[1:00:23] use no formula at all and their baptisms
[1:00:26] and even larger group that Jesus only
[1:00:28] which is not quite us the Jesus only
[1:00:32] Pentecostals baptized in the name of
[1:00:33] Jesus as a result the baptisms of these
[1:00:36] groups are invalid thus they are not
[1:00:38] Christian but our pseudo Christian mean
[1:00:41] our pseudo means like an impersonator so
[1:00:47] in other words their idea is that
[1:00:49] essentially Paul as a person ater
[1:00:51] Christian he's an impersonator of the
[1:00:53] gospel that's exactly what this is
[1:00:54] saying
[1:00:55] this comes from the pit of hell so this
[1:00:59] is not God and yet they come in the name
[1:01:01] of the Lord they say we worship Jesus
[1:01:04] but this is not from God
[1:01:06] this is totally evil this here is that
[1:01:13] sorry about the small writing I was
[1:01:15] going to read these anyway diet G is
[1:01:19] that what it's the way this word is
[1:01:20] written it's like an older manuscript
[1:01:23] that supposedly was what the disciples
[1:01:24] taught and it was they put the date of
[1:01:27] this being written about they say it's
[1:01:29] 65 to 80 AD which actually essentially
[1:01:31] was when Paul was I think he was still
[1:01:32] alive
[1:01:33] but I think it was slightly after that
[1:01:34] that this was written but it is a they
[1:01:39] say it may be in like 150 AD but it was
[1:01:41] from around that period of time and this
[1:01:42] was information that was being put out
[1:01:45] and it talks about different ways of the
[1:01:50] death it says that it as what the
[1:01:53] disciples taught the Gentile church to
[1:01:55] do and how they said they should operate
[1:01:56] it not a lot of it sounds true some of
[1:01:58] it are just just kind of taken from the
[1:02:00] Gospels to be put together but they are
[1:02:03] saying and these they're saying this is
[1:02:05] how the this is how the disciples said
[1:02:07] that we should baptize chapter 7 seas by
[1:02:09] concerning baptism thus baptized ye
[1:02:11] having first recited all these precepts
[1:02:13] baptized in the name of the Father and
[1:02:15] of the Son and of the Holy Spirit and
[1:02:16] running water but if they are hair snot
[1:02:18] running water baptized in some other
[1:02:20] water and if thou canst not baptize in
[1:02:22] cold and warm warm water but if there
[1:02:25] has neither poor water three times in
[1:02:27] the head and the name of the Father and
[1:02:29] of the Son and of the Holy Spirit but
[1:02:31] before the baptism letter mu baptized
[1:02:33] earth and him who was baptized fast
[1:02:34] previously and any others who may be
[1:02:37] able and thou shall command him who was
[1:02:39] baptized to fast two or three days so
[1:02:41] this is a material that was going around
[1:02:44] this is a grievious wolf that was coming
[1:02:47] at the gospel that's what this was yeah
[1:02:55] this is from 215 ad this man wrote this
[1:03:02] when the one being baptized goes down
[1:03:05] into the water the one baptizing come
[1:03:07] shall put his hand on him and speak to
[1:03:09] us do you believe in God the Father
[1:03:10] Almighty he is being baptized shall say
[1:03:12] I believe then having his hand opposed
[1:03:14] upon the head of the one to be baptized
[1:03:16] he shall baptize and once the initial
[1:03:17] say do you believe in Christ Jesus and
[1:03:19] he says I believe he is baptized again
[1:03:21] and he shall say do you believe in the
[1:03:23] Holy Spirit and the Holy Church and the
[1:03:25] resurrection of the flesh and the one
[1:03:27] being baptized Dean says I believe and
[1:03:29] so he has baptized the third time and
[1:03:30] that's from a book called the apostolic
[1:03:33] tradition and to15 ad okay here's
[1:03:41] another one from 216 ad it's another
[1:03:43] book someone wrote after his
[1:03:45] resurrection he promised in a pledge to
[1:03:47] its disciples that he will send him the
[1:03:48] promise of his father and lastly he
[1:03:50] commands him to be baptized and the
[1:03:51] father and in the Son and the Holy Ghost
[1:03:53] not into a nun impersonal God and indeed
[1:03:55] it's not once only but three times that
[1:03:57] we were immersed into three persons at
[1:03:59] each several mention of their names so
[1:04:05] Paul's departed now here's another one
[1:04:09] 248 ad the Lord himself told his
[1:04:12] disciples that they should baptize all
[1:04:14] peoples in the name of the Father and of
[1:04:15] the Son and of the Holy Spirit for
[1:04:17] indeed legitimate baptism has had only
[1:04:19] in the name of the Trinity and that was
[1:04:22] a commentary on Romans that someone
[1:04:23] wrote in 248 ad it was circulating this
[1:04:30] one here is saying that this is what
[1:04:31] Paul did and this is 250 AD then Probus
[1:04:37] leaped into the water saying Jesus
[1:04:39] Christ son of God and everlasting God
[1:04:41] lead all my sons be taken away by this
[1:04:42] water and Paul said we baptize thee in
[1:04:46] the name of the Father and Son and Holy
[1:04:49] Ghost and after this he made him to
[1:04:51] receive the Eucharist the Eucharist of
[1:04:54] Christ so here's a here's a book saying
[1:04:57] that I was with Paul and this is what
[1:04:59] happened Paul baptized the name of the
[1:05:01] Father Son Holy Ghost I think that was a
[1:05:03] lie
[1:05:04] I think these people are telling lies we
[1:05:07] see some of that today
[1:05:09] there are Liars out there and Satan's
[1:05:12] got no problem telling lies to deceive
[1:05:14] people he's got he doesn't mind at all
[1:05:17] telling lies so be careful what you
[1:05:18] listen to
[1:05:19] it's a very very very most lucky chances
[1:05:22] if it's against his word of God it's a
[1:05:24] lie
[1:05:25] it is a lie we're honest so we don't
[1:05:28] think about people that tell lies the
[1:05:30] Satan lies all the time he's the father
[1:05:31] of lies I'll just do one or two more of
[1:05:37] these but I wanted to do quite a few to
[1:05:38] show you this wasn't just one person
[1:05:40] saying this this was over the years an
[1:05:42] onslaught year after year after year
[1:05:44] after year by this one that one that one
[1:05:45] that one that one it was an onslaught
[1:05:47] against the gospel and essentially until
[1:05:49] the gospel didn't survive it didn't
[1:05:51] survive now I know that's in a natural
[1:05:53] sense that I know that the seed of God
[1:05:55] was there and it did survive but what if
[1:05:57] you looked at it it just succumbed to
[1:05:59] the onslaught of these Grievous wolves
[1:06:01] okay
[1:06:08] okay let's read this one and the whole
[1:06:12] faith this is from 361 ad and the whole
[1:06:16] faith is summoned up and secured on this
[1:06:17] that a Trinity should ever be preserved
[1:06:20] as we read in the gospel go and baptize
[1:06:23] all nations in the name of the Father
[1:06:24] and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost an
[1:06:26] entire and perfect there's the number of
[1:06:28] the Trinity
[1:06:28] so they're saying you've got to preserve
[1:06:30] the Trinity I'll read you one more one
[1:06:38] or two more this is from 382 ad from a
[1:06:43] man called Jerome and it was a book
[1:06:44] dialogue against the Luciferians book
[1:06:47] against Satan seeing that a man is
[1:06:49] baptized in the name of the Father and
[1:06:50] the Son and the Holy Ghost becomes a
[1:06:53] temple of the Lord seeing that that when
[1:06:55] a man gets baptized in the name of the
[1:06:57] Father Son Holy Ghost he becomes a
[1:06:58] temple of the Lord and that while the
[1:07:00] older boat is destroyed a new shrine is
[1:07:01] built for the Trinity how can you say
[1:07:03] that the sins can be remitted of the
[1:07:08] among the aryans without the coming of
[1:07:11] the Holy Ghost towers how is a soul
[1:07:13] purged from its former stains that was
[1:07:15] not the hole to go sorry that wasn't the
[1:07:16] one that I was going to
[1:07:32] this was from 400 AD baptism and the
[1:07:36] name of the Father and of the son of the
[1:07:38] Holy Ghost has Christ for us authority
[1:07:40] not any man whoever he may be
[1:07:42] and Christ his truth not any men we
[1:07:45] heard that before we just follow Jesus
[1:07:49] yeah you understand what I mean
[1:07:51] that's what they said back then we just
[1:07:53] follow Jesus it doesn't matter what Paul
[1:07:55] said we follow the real Authority which
[1:07:56] is Jesus it does matter what Paul said
[1:07:58] Oh Lord God we believe you the father
[1:08:03] and the Son and the Holy Spirit for the
[1:08:05] truth would not say go baptize all
[1:08:07] nations name of the Father and of the
[1:08:08] son of the Holy Spirit unless you were a
[1:08:10] Trinity last one this is from 444 ad and
[1:08:21] what need is there of many words when it
[1:08:24] is possible to refute falsehood and a
[1:08:26] few we provide that those who year by
[1:08:28] year come up for Holy Baptism Sheol
[1:08:30] carefully learn the faith set forth of
[1:08:31] Nicaea by the holy and blessed father's
[1:08:34] and initiating them as we have me in
[1:08:36] burden we baptize them in the name of
[1:08:37] the Father and of the Son and of the
[1:08:38] Holy Ghost pronouncing each name singly
[1:08:40] so for hundreds of years there was an
[1:08:43] onslaught against the gospel of Christ
[1:08:45] the gospel of Paul for hundreds of years
[1:08:48] now keep their thought in your mind so
[1:08:54] Paul says after my departing grievious
[1:08:57] all shall enter and not sparing the
[1:08:59] flock okay now I'm going to talk a bit
[1:09:05] about I know people Bosch America a lot
[1:09:08] this is not about that but I'm going to
[1:09:09] talk about I have to talk about America
[1:09:13] because they are in Scripture the same
[1:09:15] as Rome okay so if you want to kind of
[1:09:18] look at what's happening you can you can
[1:09:20] look at Jerusalem or Israel Rome end in
[1:09:23] America because our own prophecy so
[1:09:26] you've got to see what's happening there
[1:09:27] to kind of get a picture of what's going
[1:09:29] on and this is in Revelations where it
[1:09:31] talks about the beast and I saw another
[1:09:32] beast coming up out of the earth and he
[1:09:34] had two horns like a lamb and he spake
[1:09:36] as a dragon now we know that that is
[1:09:38] that's America coming out of the the
[1:09:41] earth and it was like a lamb and then
[1:09:43] expect like a dragon now I love America
[1:09:45] I think it's
[1:09:45] right country I've been there a few
[1:09:47] times I really liked it as a country I
[1:09:48] think it's I think it's been a godly
[1:09:50] country
[1:09:50] I think it's been such a great place
[1:09:52] that meaning the gospel has gone forth
[1:09:54] from that place there's a reason why
[1:09:57] people always want to go there
[1:09:58] not leave their okay because it has been
[1:10:01] a great place as head it's troubles like
[1:10:02] every country but I'd probably rather
[1:10:04] live beer than a lot of other countries
[1:10:06] you understand what I mean I'm I my
[1:10:09] wife's American she doesn't like it I
[1:10:11] like it more than here but I want to
[1:10:15] show you something okay this this graph
[1:10:17] here is now the national debt I'm going
[1:10:21] to talk about this in a little bit but
[1:10:22] just get that image in your mind of the
[1:10:25] national debt and this is from nineteen
[1:10:30] it starts of nineteen forty but before
[1:10:32] that it doesn't really do a lot of stuff
[1:10:33] it had a bit of a thing in the
[1:10:35] depression but it doesn't do much stuff
[1:10:37] it's another graph of it just look at
[1:10:39] the way that things are going okay I'm
[1:10:44] going to talk soon about this this is um
[1:10:46] debt to GDP who's an accounting standard
[1:10:50] person here really
[1:10:54] this is debt to GDP the big spike you
[1:10:57] saw there was World War two they had to
[1:10:59] borrow to fund World War two and you see
[1:11:02] it went down after that because they all
[1:11:04] the men came home and they worked and
[1:11:06] they had factories and they worked and
[1:11:07] they they could move things forward and
[1:11:09] then it spiked up again we have had no
[1:11:12] war heavily had any war we had any major
[1:11:15] thing that would impact why we have to
[1:11:18] borrow Wallace but why do we have to
[1:11:20] borrow all this money why is it going up
[1:11:22] again there's been nothing supposedly
[1:11:25] happened to make it go up this is
[1:11:28] actually the UK as well this is from
[1:11:30] because the UK all these currencies are
[1:11:32] tied together it's all run by a similar
[1:11:35] thing right this was actually from the
[1:11:37] 70s but this graph is similar that most
[1:11:39] of the countries that deal in these
[1:11:40] currencies they all have the same graphs
[1:11:46] essentially right can anyone see that
[1:11:49] okay
[1:11:51] I've got to go through this because when
[1:11:54] you see the magnitude of what's
[1:11:55] happening now it makes you think about
[1:11:58] the plans you're going to be making in
[1:12:00] the future because you can see this this
[1:12:02] thing is right at our door well it's
[1:12:05] right at the door we don't have many
[1:12:08] tomorrow's we don't have many we can
[1:12:12] sometimes just tick over and we think
[1:12:14] we've got a job this is happening that
[1:12:15] setting everything's alright underneath
[1:12:17] this thing as as as almost something's
[1:12:21] almost taken over this whole thing
[1:12:23] that's what's happening
[1:12:25] I've got a few videos where people are
[1:12:28] news commentators are saying how great
[1:12:29] everything is we're an absolute
[1:12:32] financially speaking and the way the
[1:12:33] world is we're in an absolute dire
[1:12:35] straight and nobody has any solutions
[1:12:38] although we know what the solution will
[1:12:40] be right but I need to go through this
[1:12:43] the concept of fractional lending I have
[1:12:46] to go through it so we can paint a
[1:12:48] picture of what's going on right this is
[1:12:50] you know you know why not fractional
[1:12:52] lending is it's essentially it's the
[1:12:56] bank's ability to lend you money that
[1:12:58] they don't have you know one bought a
[1:13:00] house
[1:13:01] you've been lent money that to buy that
[1:13:05] house if you've got a loan that the bank
[1:13:06] did not have that's the way the system
[1:13:08] works and you have worked and sweetened
[1:13:13] and stressed to pay back money to
[1:13:15] somebody that didn't actually it didn't
[1:13:18] lend it to you essentially that's why
[1:13:20] when something falls over they can just
[1:13:22] write it off it was never there in the
[1:13:23] first place it's easier in America if
[1:13:25] you can't pay it they just kind of write
[1:13:27] it off because that no one had to really
[1:13:28] work for it
[1:13:29] they don't like you to do that but they
[1:13:30] tie you in right but that is the way
[1:13:33] that the system works I just want to see
[1:13:35] it show you the ludacris T of this and
[1:13:37] it hasn't always been like this it
[1:13:39] hasn't been this system hasn't been in
[1:13:40] place it's only been in place really
[1:13:43] since about 1900 but since the seventies
[1:13:46] that's really taken hold since the
[1:13:48] seventies but before that it wasn't the
[1:13:52] way that it is now right so here's this
[1:13:55] little graph right you can if you put a
[1:13:59] hundred thousand dollars in the bank
[1:14:02] the
[1:14:03] follow my little graph along the bank
[1:14:04] has got $100,000 cash okay now they can
[1:14:08] lend out the fractional reserve rate is
[1:14:10] you've got the whole five percent of the
[1:14:12] of what you've got and you can lend out
[1:14:13] all the rests well essentially still
[1:14:15] having that in your bank so you can lend
[1:14:16] out ninety five percent it's about the
[1:14:18] rate it may fluctuate but so they can
[1:14:21] mean doubt if they've got a hundred
[1:14:22] thousand dollar deposit they can lend
[1:14:24] out ninety five thousand dollars of that
[1:14:25] and essentially still have one hundred
[1:14:28] ninety five thousand dollars in the bank
[1:14:29] okay yeah I see it going it gets more
[1:14:33] and more confusing as you go through
[1:14:34] right so now they lent out ninety five
[1:14:40] thousand dollars and the their balance
[1:14:42] sheet in the event cuz $100,000 cash
[1:14:44] ninety five thousand dollar loan so
[1:14:45] they've got they've got assets of
[1:14:47] 195,000 they're up because they've got a
[1:14:50] loan plus they got cash in the bank okay
[1:14:51] but the Alaia bility is a hundred grand
[1:14:53] because of the one hundred thousand
[1:14:55] dollar deposit so essentially the equity
[1:14:57] is ninety five thousand but that one
[1:14:59] hundred thousand is backed by the
[1:15:00] central bank the central bank back any
[1:15:03] deposits because it's actually bare
[1:15:05] money they're using so they bet their
[1:15:08] own currency because they've made the
[1:15:09] deal with the bank so the bank can lend
[1:15:11] it out if it all doesn't work they give
[1:15:13] the bank the money and they don't they
[1:15:15] just put the money they print it they
[1:15:18] don't dig gold out and give you gold
[1:15:20] they princess how much do you need
[1:15:22] it'll be done in an hour or in these
[1:15:25] days it's more of an injection okay now
[1:15:29] the actual total at the bank is now five
[1:15:32] thousand dollars realistically speaking
[1:15:33] year because they've had a hundred than
[1:15:35] lent at ninety five they should have
[1:15:36] five thousand dollars sitting in the
[1:15:37] bank that's all their bank should have
[1:15:38] that's all you and I would have if we
[1:15:40] had 100 we lent at ninety five we'd have
[1:15:42] five thousand dollars left-- year that's
[1:15:44] their way the honor system works see and
[1:15:46] that's a sound system now let's say that
[1:15:49] the the person that was lent the ninety
[1:15:51] five thousand dollars he works and he
[1:15:54] struggles all his life the sweat and
[1:15:57] stress and he pays back back $95,000
[1:16:00] worth interest say ten thousand dollars
[1:16:02] interests so he pays back one hundred
[1:16:04] and five thousand dollars to the bank
[1:16:07] that they didn't lend him
[1:16:10] okay now once he pays that back the
[1:16:12] bankers now got two hundred five
[1:16:14] thousand dollars in cash right now
[1:16:17] here's where this whole system is so
[1:16:20] evil right there was only ninety five
[1:16:23] thousand dollars in circulation let's
[1:16:25] just put it that way because there are
[1:16:29] 100 thousand because that was all that
[1:16:30] he was he was he was neat ninety five
[1:16:33] thousand dollars but he paid back more
[1:16:36] money than what was in circulation where
[1:16:37] did the other money come from where did
[1:16:40] it come from someone else had to borrow
[1:16:43] it and put it into the system because it
[1:16:45] wasn't there it wasn't it was not there
[1:16:47] but someone had to be linked out and he
[1:16:50] had to take some of that and use it to
[1:16:52] pay it back
[1:16:53] when you understand this concept you
[1:16:55] understand the only way the system works
[1:16:57] is if more money is lent out all the
[1:17:00] time the minute you stop lending out
[1:17:03] money the system starts to collapse
[1:17:05] that's why they have what you call a
[1:17:06] recession or a depression
[1:17:08] that's all man-made let's just pull back
[1:17:11] on the money supply put the interest
[1:17:12] rates up the money comes back in there's
[1:17:15] less money that's why people start
[1:17:17] there's less money right you don't have
[1:17:19] as much money you can't buy as much
[1:17:20] stuff everything's that's going down
[1:17:21] it's man-made
[1:17:22] it's as easy as turning off the tap and
[1:17:25] not letting as much go out when the
[1:17:26] banks stop lending the economy goes down
[1:17:28] because people are still paying back and
[1:17:30] they select to pull money out and pay
[1:17:31] back plus the interest they've got to
[1:17:33] take other people's money the money
[1:17:35] supply goes down the only way the system
[1:17:38] works this one is by putting more deep
[1:17:41] into the system you understand that's
[1:17:44] the only way that it works it's evil so
[1:17:47] now they they can now have turn or
[1:17:49] $5,000 cash they can lend out one
[1:17:52] hundred and ninety five five hundred
[1:17:53] ninety nine thousand five hundred now of
[1:17:56] money that because they can lend out
[1:17:57] ninety five percent of that so now the
[1:18:00] real total at the bank at the end of
[1:18:01] that is negative eighty nine thousand
[1:18:03] dollars you and I would have would be a
[1:18:04] negative for insolvent actually on the
[1:18:07] banks balance sheet
[1:18:08] they've got the assets of four hundred
[1:18:11] nine thousand because they've got two
[1:18:12] thousand dollars cash they've got a one
[1:18:14] hundred ninety five thousand dollar loan
[1:18:15] the liability is still only a hundred
[1:18:17] thousand so they're their actual bank
[1:18:20] balance the equity is three hundred
[1:18:22] thousand
[1:18:23] when you and I would be negative 89 yeah
[1:18:26] that's on one loan yeah this has been
[1:18:31] happening for about a hundred years
[1:18:33] almost and this happens not only on
[1:18:37] loans but this happens on a currency
[1:18:38] every dollar that's in circulation is
[1:18:41] interest charged on it every dollar
[1:18:43] every digit in your bank account and
[1:18:45] virtually most countries in the world it
[1:18:48] is interest has done it because it came
[1:18:49] invite is interest charge somebody has
[1:18:52] been making a lot of money for a long
[1:18:55] time and it's got a lot of money all the
[1:18:59] money this is staggering now like I said
[1:19:06] earlier the money is not in the bank
[1:19:10] like the bank that but the example we
[1:19:12] gave the money is not actually there
[1:19:14] there is no money it's just and I hope
[1:19:17] that no one takes the money yet there is
[1:19:19] no money there's no money and that's
[1:19:22] what one of the banks in England during
[1:19:24] the Oh 8 financial crisis there was a
[1:19:27] rumor that they they may not have any
[1:19:30] money and as soon as that rumor got out
[1:19:32] everyone goes to the bank to take their
[1:19:34] digits out of the bank where the digits
[1:19:35] own in the bank yeah so the central bank
[1:19:39] the United Kingdom central bank had to
[1:19:42] quickly come in and top up their account
[1:19:44] with just print more money top it up so
[1:19:45] guys should get their money yeah that's
[1:19:47] the way that it works you just help your
[1:19:49] buddies out but but there is no money in
[1:19:53] the banks I was reading this was an
[1:19:56] interesting article I was reading about
[1:19:57] the fires in California and one of the
[1:19:59] guys houses that burned down have quite
[1:20:01] a burn on director all his cash was on a
[1:20:03] safe in his house I thought that's
[1:20:05] strange he said now I don't trust the
[1:20:07] banks I'm not putting my own cash in the
[1:20:09] back but a safe burnt and all his money
[1:20:11] was gone but you know some people know
[1:20:17] that the system's will root and not put
[1:20:20] any money in the bank right but now like
[1:20:23] I said the only way that the system
[1:20:25] survives is by lending because you've
[1:20:29] got to keep putting money into it in
[1:20:31] order to keep sucking money out of it
[1:20:32] there's never enough money in there to
[1:20:34] pay back so you've got to keep pushing
[1:20:35] money in but
[1:20:36] got to go on as debt rights got to go on
[1:20:39] as loans it doesn't go on as is so now
[1:20:42] what are the major things that we
[1:20:44] purchase home we purchase assets for
[1:20:48] business we purchase motor vehicles and
[1:20:50] you know we get stuff on credit cards
[1:20:51] that's about the main the big four right
[1:20:54] okay with what that all goes on your
[1:20:58] credit card you know that these are
[1:20:59] means to get you know money into the
[1:21:03] system right I want to read you the
[1:21:07] scripture here before we go through it
[1:21:08] this is revelation 13:5 says I know thy
[1:21:10] works that thou art neither cold nor hot
[1:21:12] I would that they will cold or hot so
[1:21:14] then because thou art lukewarm and
[1:21:16] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[1:21:18] out of my mouth because they are saying
[1:21:19] I am rich and increased with Goods and
[1:21:22] have need of nothing and knowest not
[1:21:25] that thou art wretched miserable poor
[1:21:26] and blind and naked now we've never
[1:21:28] lived in such a wealthy age as this age
[1:21:30] there has never ever been so much wealth
[1:21:33] winners anyone ever had so much stuff
[1:21:36] even we complain when I was a kid I had
[1:21:39] one little plastic toy you know and I
[1:21:41] played with that thing all the time look
[1:21:42] at these guys they got baskets of these
[1:21:44] things you know where has the money come
[1:21:47] from it's been linked lint we've gotten
[1:21:51] wealthy by lending to us it's all been
[1:21:55] lent you know it's like if you will lint
[1:21:57] a whole lot of money yeah you'd go and
[1:21:59] buy things and they'd say if you were
[1:22:02] silly like that you go and buy things
[1:22:03] and live it up you think man I'm doing
[1:22:04] so good I'm so I've got so much stuff
[1:22:06] I'm doing so well I'm rich if you if
[1:22:09] you've borrowed it all you're broke you
[1:22:11] just think you're having a good time
[1:22:13] there'll be a day when you got to pay
[1:22:14] that back you're not rich and that's the
[1:22:18] way this world has been rigged and
[1:22:19] Satan's rigged it this way he's leaning
[1:22:22] it's all been linked and we've gotten
[1:22:25] wealthier and wealthier and we've gotten
[1:22:26] used to having stuff and give us more
[1:22:28] money right so now the reason why I show
[1:22:32] you this one was because the first thing
[1:22:34] the system has done as as lean is lean
[1:22:36] to all of us get him lean them as much
[1:22:39] money because we are the easy targets
[1:22:40] lean lean lean lean Linda okay and this
[1:22:44] really really took hold in the seventies
[1:22:46] women in the States especially because
[1:22:48] it's the dollar is the reserve
[1:22:50] so it's the currency that everything is
[1:22:52] traded in it's the currency right and in
[1:22:56] the 70s they went off the gold standard
[1:22:58] because it used to be backed by gold you
[1:23:02] know brother branham I don't know where
[1:23:03] I heard this from somebody in the hood
[1:23:04] from somebody else that may not be true
[1:23:06] I don't know but apparently he woke up
[1:23:09] believable once though they were seeing
[1:23:10] a train and you see that gold there is
[1:23:11] hidding there's gold in that train is
[1:23:13] heading to the Vatican I don't know how
[1:23:15] true it is but when you look at the
[1:23:16] system if we talk about the way the
[1:23:21] Federal Reserve was set up which is a
[1:23:22] which is which is what's right owned by
[1:23:25] banks not not any government and they
[1:23:28] would they they lend money to the
[1:23:30] government right that's how it happens
[1:23:31] they they lend money to the they lend
[1:23:33] money to the United States people to use
[1:23:37] you so they are using somebody else's
[1:23:38] currency it's not the America's currency
[1:23:40] right and well it was being in the early
[1:23:44] days the interest was paid back in gold
[1:23:46] can you fathom that they're printing
[1:23:49] money lending it to you and saying you
[1:23:51] pay me back in gold how long do you
[1:23:53] think it took for all the gold to to
[1:23:56] take all the gold isn't that and isn't
[1:24:00] that an awesome idea if you're when you
[1:24:03] think about the scheme I think hacker
[1:24:05] these mean think up the scheme but it's
[1:24:06] evil it's a satanic scheme now the
[1:24:10] Gold's gone it used to be back that's
[1:24:13] why in the 70s they went off the gold
[1:24:14] standard because there is no gold anyway
[1:24:16] the Gold's gone it's been spent okay but
[1:24:21] in the seventies when they went off the
[1:24:22] gold standard this this currency method
[1:24:24] the fiat currency had an opportunity to
[1:24:26] now do its thing unhindered because it's
[1:24:29] not now held back by anything else
[1:24:31] anymore right they could do its thing
[1:24:33] now the only way this thing survives is
[1:24:36] by lending so what do you think is going
[1:24:37] to happen too deep from the seventies
[1:24:39] right across the board which way is it
[1:24:42] going to go ah and that's what this
[1:24:45] graph yeah this is this is actually the
[1:24:47] house pricing index of the value of
[1:24:49] houses but when you start lending their
[1:24:51] houses people start buying you start to
[1:24:53] create demand supply and demand if
[1:24:55] people have got money they want to buy
[1:24:56] there's only two houses on the market
[1:24:57] five want to buy it but the price goes
[1:25:00] up because so that
[1:25:02] look it went along for years and years
[1:25:04] and years just normal prices yes you
[1:25:06] know because because the money supply
[1:25:08] was it couldn't be artificially inflated
[1:25:10] it was limited it was limited by the
[1:25:12] amount of winner was gold and silver by
[1:25:13] the man of gold and you had to actually
[1:25:14] work to get gold and get her in the
[1:25:16] system it was a different it couldn't be
[1:25:18] inflated like exponentially like it
[1:25:20] could and now because you can there's no
[1:25:22] limit to what you can print you see
[1:25:24] that's why these graphs show it like
[1:25:26] this this is and this is from the this
[1:25:29] is from the seventies when it was
[1:25:31] completely gone this is debt so the
[1:25:33] first thing that they that this scheme
[1:25:35] was to do you got to lend money to keep
[1:25:38] it going so the first thing you do is
[1:25:39] lend to the consumer Lind to the people
[1:25:41] get every person saddled down with it
[1:25:43] get him alone for the celina metal in
[1:25:45] them that linen net make him feel rich
[1:25:47] he's rich and this is awesome I'm rich I
[1:25:49] got a house I've got a car I've got all
[1:25:50] this this is these are this is house
[1:25:53] mortgage that the reared underneath is a
[1:25:56] mortgage home mortgages and the one on
[1:25:59] Stoppers is credit credit cards this is
[1:26:03] the way that it's gone this is this is
[1:26:05] what's made us wealthy we've been leap
[1:26:07] money
[1:26:08] this is debt all of our assets are from
[1:26:11] this and you've got to keep pumping and
[1:26:13] to keep it going
[1:26:14] this one here is business loans like to
[1:26:17] buy a big business assets Annette if you
[1:26:19] notice before the seventies fifties
[1:26:21] sixties seventies it was just ticking
[1:26:22] along in the seventies when the standard
[1:26:24] was gone completely in order to keep the
[1:26:27] system going you got to keep lending
[1:26:28] money you got to keep getting people
[1:26:30] into debt look at skyrocketed
[1:26:34] skyrocketed what's another thing people
[1:26:37] buy vehicles by motor vehicles yeah
[1:26:41] boats all those big-ticket items at the
[1:26:42] consumer buys same thing it sort of took
[1:26:46] the long from the seventies that started
[1:26:47] going up because you've got to keep this
[1:26:49] thing you got to keep feeding deep into
[1:26:51] the system to make it work I haven't
[1:26:57] missed anything here but the financial
[1:27:01] crisis of 8 was essentially the point
[1:27:04] where the consumer couldn't take on any
[1:27:06] more debt he couldn't handle the debt he
[1:27:09] just you've been settled with so much
[1:27:12] debt there comes a point where you can't
[1:27:15] pay any more you just think
[1:27:16] okay you can't extract enough out in it
[1:27:19] the whole thing started to go down and
[1:27:21] the they call up their Great Recession
[1:27:23] you know it all just started to come
[1:27:25] apart of the Seas because the consumer
[1:27:27] couldn't pay anymore couldn't couldn't
[1:27:29] pay it the death anymore
[1:27:31] I got this little picture here but it
[1:27:34] was global because their money system
[1:27:37] it's all global it was a global ordeal
[1:27:39] because if you happens in one place it
[1:27:41] has in the ripple effect and it goes
[1:27:42] around some countries were worse than
[1:27:44] others but but the the the and also the
[1:27:50] banks stopped lending the banks all stop
[1:27:53] lending and so this is what happens when
[1:27:55] the bank stopped lending and stopped
[1:27:56] putting money and this is what happens
[1:27:58] it is not enough to go around
[1:28:00] the economy starts going down that's the
[1:28:03] way that the system works that was at
[1:28:06] the United States this and here was the
[1:28:09] UK they've that little downward spike as
[1:28:11] the recession is there's gonna be turned
[1:28:14] on and off on and off this is not all
[1:28:18] wow this is going to happen we didn't
[1:28:21] see that this is on and off friends this
[1:28:23] is the way this system works and then of
[1:28:26] course people then didn't have as much
[1:28:27] money consumer spending because suddenly
[1:28:29] there wasn't an application circulation
[1:28:30] because they're not putting more in
[1:28:32] right now if you ever heard this term
[1:28:38] quantitative easing it sounds like a
[1:28:44] like a nice flash term you know
[1:28:48] quantitative easing it's like like we're
[1:28:51] going to help you out we're going to
[1:28:52] look and quantify something and then
[1:28:54] just eat it gently give it to you to
[1:28:56] help everything out this was Plan B only
[1:29:00] you know this was Plan B when was 2008
[1:29:03] ten years ago this wasn't been happening
[1:29:06] since 2008 the Federal Reserve has been
[1:29:09] doing what they call quantitative easing
[1:29:11] you know what that means the government
[1:29:13] doesn't have enough money to fund the
[1:29:15] sinning by the people can't take anymore
[1:29:17] debt but the system needs money who can
[1:29:19] we give money to which said all the
[1:29:21] government with debt let's that pumping
[1:29:24] money and lending to the government by
[1:29:26] way of buying the government have bonds
[1:29:28] you know bonds are like I owe you
[1:29:30] see I'll give you a hundred you give me
[1:29:34] a hundred dollars log of your hundred
[1:29:35] dollar IOU and I'll pay back with
[1:29:37] interest at some point it's that's a
[1:29:39] bond it's an IOU they started buying I
[1:29:41] owe use of the government trillions of
[1:29:46] dollars of I use why cuz the consumer
[1:29:48] can't take anymore did he settle with it
[1:29:51] this this is this is since 2008 you can
[1:29:54] see the spike in here they call that
[1:29:56] total assets held by the Federal Reserve
[1:29:58] they've printed this money and bought
[1:30:01] and it's slowly settling the government
[1:30:03] with debt since 2008 you can remember
[1:30:05] that time this is in your last 10 years
[1:30:07] this has been happening just them alone
[1:30:09] has been to the tune of four trillion
[1:30:11] four and a half trillion or about three
[1:30:15] and a half it's about four and a half
[1:30:15] trillion now because this is this 115
[1:30:17] that's a lot of debt yeah yeah forget
[1:30:22] about our countries they we will go down
[1:30:24] together
[1:30:26] because America is the global currency
[1:30:28] that it's that it's the reserve currency
[1:30:32] everything hinges around the dollar it's
[1:30:34] these people tried to think they could
[1:30:36] go in to start using Chinese dollars to
[1:30:38] buy oil and there that soon stopped you
[1:30:40] know that soon stopped that was put a
[1:30:43] stop to now the reason why I put this
[1:30:46] graph is because you can see in 2008
[1:30:48] this is why people say well the
[1:30:50] economy's going great ad that the debt
[1:30:53] has doubled doubled all the debt that
[1:30:57] was ever there in the existence of the
[1:30:59] country in the last 10 years has doubled
[1:31:03] doubled can you fathom that and this is
[1:31:05] where we're talking 22 trillion dollars
[1:31:08] that's 22 million million that's a lot
[1:31:16] of money this whole system this is
[1:31:21] happening now this this cannot be paid
[1:31:23] back this can not be paid back anyone
[1:31:28] that tells you the economy's going good
[1:31:29] is lying to you this whole system is
[1:31:33] their purpose of it was did all the
[1:31:35] people settle with it first then you
[1:31:38] then bye-bye out this government now if
[1:31:41] you're a
[1:31:44] now look at this one here
[1:31:46] debt-to-gdp this is the United Kingdom
[1:31:49] where does it start spiking from 2008
[1:31:52] why cuz they started they had to start
[1:31:55] settling now the government with it now
[1:31:57] and the 2008 crisis the government's
[1:31:59] could step in essentially in bailout
[1:32:01] system they about it out they needed
[1:32:06] someone to bail them out now when the
[1:32:07] next one hits who's going to bail out
[1:32:08] these governments who's gonna they don't
[1:32:12] have any money left they don't have any
[1:32:15] money that the debt to GDP was like I
[1:32:18] said to you earlier was there a big war
[1:32:20] in 2008 was there a massive croc like
[1:32:22] terms of they had to buy things they've
[1:32:26] had to fund everything they've been
[1:32:27] leaked money and in all the countries
[1:32:29] look at the spike from 2008 it just goes
[1:32:32] up like that why because they've been
[1:32:34] leaked money to keep the system going
[1:32:35] and it's now being settled upon the
[1:32:37] government there'll be a time when the
[1:32:38] government cannot pay its debts anymore
[1:32:40] and it's coming close to that time when
[1:32:43] it cannot pay its debts and that's when
[1:32:46] the big change is going to start
[1:32:47] happening in the world because we are so
[1:32:48] used to living in this rich economy it's
[1:32:51] not going to be the way that it is and
[1:32:53] we're going to have two choices we're
[1:32:55] either all live like paupers with
[1:32:57] nothing because that's what it's going
[1:32:59] to be like or there's got to be a deal
[1:33:01] made and an ear is going to be a deal
[1:33:04] made that's what this is all about as so
[1:33:06] there could be made a deal you made a
[1:33:10] deal and we can understand all this as
[1:33:14] being the beginning of the tribulation
[1:33:15] you need to understand these numbers
[1:33:18] these are not just so you can carry on
[1:33:20] tomorrow in these numbers don't exist
[1:33:21] these numbers will be worse tomorrow
[1:33:23] you can't take this back this is
[1:33:26] happening like in ten years time what
[1:33:30] are these numbers going to be if the
[1:33:31] Lord should Terry what are they going to
[1:33:33] be it's going to be unmanageable it's
[1:33:36] not going to work there's no more the
[1:33:39] last people they will bankrupt of the
[1:33:41] government's there's no one else after
[1:33:44] that until this thing takes over that's
[1:33:45] the way that it is or it's in quotes for
[1:33:49] the image
[1:33:49] she'll be Great Tribulation such as was
[1:33:51] not seen since the beginning of the
[1:33:53] world to this time no nor ever shall be
[1:33:54] this is what
[1:33:56] right but at the times and the seasons
[1:33:59] brethren you have no need that I write
[1:34:02] unto you for yourselves know perfectly
[1:34:04] that the day of the Lord so cometh as a
[1:34:06] thief in the night for when they shall
[1:34:07] say peace and safety then sudden
[1:34:09] destruction cometh upon them as travail
[1:34:11] upon a woman with child and they shall
[1:34:12] not escape ok if you guys watch the news
[1:34:20] lately in the economic news I kind of do
[1:34:24] I don't know why but apparently we're
[1:34:28] doing really good apparently the economy
[1:34:30] is growing apparently it's the best
[1:34:31] shape it's ever been we're doing great
[1:34:32] can you roll that one please and give me
[1:34:34] some sound really sounding Oh beat on
[1:34:40] the economy roll tape I'm pleased to say
[1:34:44] that by these measures the economy looks
[1:34:46] very good the unemployment rate stands
[1:34:48] at three point nine percent near a
[1:34:50] 20-year low inflation is currently
[1:34:53] running near the FOMC's 2 percent
[1:34:55] objective this is a remarkably positive
[1:34:57] outlook indeed I was asked to the press
[1:35:00] conference last week whether these
[1:35:02] forecasts are too good to be true which
[1:35:04] I have to admit was a reasonable
[1:35:06] question
[1:35:07] let's get an answer on this one joining
[1:35:10] us Harvard economics professor Martin
[1:35:12] Feldstein I that was a remarkably
[1:35:16] positive outlook from the Fed chair do
[1:35:19] you share that positive outlook I stop
[1:35:22] there answer the equals I'll answer the
[1:35:23] question no no I do not share that
[1:35:29] positive outlook where did that money
[1:35:32] come from we as this money come from
[1:35:34] debt the consumers know better off is we
[1:35:38] eat the common man has got no less debt
[1:35:40] the government's got twice as much debt
[1:35:43] as what it has prepared before the
[1:35:44] recession these are terrible times the
[1:35:47] economy is an absolute dire straits
[1:35:49] about to fall over how can you say this
[1:35:54] but yet we feel good because now we've
[1:35:56] got a job I've got a job everything's
[1:35:58] going good you understand this is what's
[1:36:01] happening this is another one Bros this
[1:36:03] the next slide ok I just want to give
[1:36:04] you one more because this is a general
[1:36:06] the general feeling the only people that
[1:36:08] knock it out
[1:36:09] all cylinders get this US workers now
[1:36:13] seeing their highest pay increase since
[1:36:15] 2008 that's the employment Cost Index
[1:36:17] came out today 2.8 percent for the
[1:36:20] second quarter this as US consumer
[1:36:22] confidence continues we're all spending
[1:36:23] an income big-time solid in June
[1:36:26] households spend more money on
[1:36:27] restaurants accommodation really
[1:36:29] building that strong base building on
[1:36:31] what's already been an amazing economy
[1:36:33] and I think we've got some strong head
[1:36:35] so tell one's going into the rest of the
[1:36:37] year that's not true that's not true
[1:36:48] don't be fooled by don't watch this do
[1:36:51] our research and go well everything's
[1:36:52] great it's not it's the worst that's
[1:36:55] ever been
[1:36:57] now I want to read you some quotes from
[1:36:59] brother Branham here I want you to show
[1:37:03] you what's going on now the Bible said
[1:37:06] in here was the wealth of the world gold
[1:37:09] and silver this is talking about the
[1:37:10] Catholic Church and they kept it now if
[1:37:13] we're on the if we're on the gold
[1:37:14] standard Emily a broker that back then
[1:37:16] we were we're not anymore
[1:37:17] what's going to happen what's going to
[1:37:18] happen you know the rich people of this
[1:37:20] nation these big factories and whiskey
[1:37:21] men and tobacco mean and so forth like
[1:37:23] that it's not going to stand to change
[1:37:25] the currency and the Jews because they
[1:37:27] hold the bonds right you'll see that in
[1:37:29] a bit so the only thing we'll have to do
[1:37:32] is borrow it there is only one place we
[1:37:34] can borrow and when we do we'll sell our
[1:37:35] birthright out to it that's right then
[1:37:37] what are you going to do you are owned
[1:37:39] by that by it that system there's
[1:37:40] nothing else you can do no people don't
[1:37:43] think you may think I'm crazy but when
[1:37:46] my voice is silenced and death these
[1:37:47] tapes will still be playing and you
[1:37:49] recognize that what I've said has come
[1:37:51] to pass I would be the most silly person
[1:37:53] to take the stand that I have took to
[1:37:55] even against this thing I would be I
[1:37:57] would be against God I would be against
[1:37:58] everything that's God if I was wrong am
[1:38:01] I thinking am i calling the thing would
[1:38:03] be against God but I've took my stand
[1:38:05] because I see it here in the world it's
[1:38:07] God's Word the ERC being vindicated
[1:38:09] proven to be the truth and that's the
[1:38:10] interpretation that God gives us of his
[1:38:13] word God's own interpretation of his
[1:38:15] word is how he vindicates it to make it
[1:38:17] true there was bleeding something else
[1:38:19] but they thought
[1:38:21] about this right as brother Peregrine
[1:38:26] talked about it when I was listening to
[1:38:28] him the other night talking about this
[1:38:29] he said how did a fifth grade educated
[1:38:32] guy understand this how did he know this
[1:38:35] he wasn't an economist and yet he
[1:38:38] pointed all this out see this is the way
[1:38:39] that it's going to go this is how it's
[1:38:41] gonna work we are living off tax money
[1:38:44] that will be paid in 40 years from today
[1:38:46] the nation is broke we're a sedan who's
[1:38:47] got the money we haven't got it our
[1:38:49] bonds are no good we'll talk about that
[1:38:51] soon we've got to have gold who's got at
[1:38:53] the Catholic Church remember the Gold's
[1:38:55] gone who's got it the Catholic Church
[1:38:59] what would they do before these whiskey
[1:39:01] men and all these great holders and
[1:39:02] stockholders will ever give it up they
[1:39:03] won't absolutely sell out he's talking
[1:39:05] about the only way to fix it is to get
[1:39:07] rid of the dollar all together and start
[1:39:09] a new currency that's debt free but he's
[1:39:12] saying they will not do that because
[1:39:13] when you do that you essentially lose
[1:39:14] all your lose everything if they will
[1:39:16] not do that neither will the Jews that
[1:39:19] own the bonds because the bonds are
[1:39:21] hinged to the dollar right and that's
[1:39:24] why in the book River and Daniel they're
[1:39:26] the Jews made a covenant with the with
[1:39:28] the Catholic Church because they knew
[1:39:30] and this we have the dollar our bonds
[1:39:32] are not worth it
[1:39:32] our shears our things we own in the and
[1:39:34] the monetary system she is and this
[1:39:36] years and that all that these are hinged
[1:39:38] to the dollar if the dollar fails we
[1:39:40] lose all this yeah so you've got to back
[1:39:42] the dollar buy gold then our things will
[1:39:43] still stand that's the agreement that's
[1:39:45] going to be made one's got the bonds
[1:39:47] one's got the gold they've got to come
[1:39:48] to an agreement otherwise the gold
[1:39:50] holder will win the bond holder won't
[1:39:52] he's got a compromise and say okay I'll
[1:39:54] go with it but I've got some of that
[1:39:56] soon the Catholic Church then before
[1:39:58] these whiskey men and all these great
[1:40:00] holders and stockholders will ever go
[1:40:01] out they were absolutely sellout and the
[1:40:03] church will loan the nation the money
[1:40:04] and what will it do that will sell us
[1:40:07] both right straight into Catholicism
[1:40:08] that's what it's going to do that's
[1:40:10] that's the goal of the world and then
[1:40:12] them Jews this covenant he makes with
[1:40:14] Israel another one the only sensible
[1:40:17] thing to do change the currency but they
[1:40:19] won't do it under the present
[1:40:20] ministration Roman Catholic Church owns
[1:40:22] the gold of the world and that's what
[1:40:24] they do is sell out these rich men and
[1:40:25] so forth of the earth the Bible said
[1:40:27] what will they do before they lose the
[1:40:29] bran and Williams the Becker company and
[1:40:31] most of it the case the Kineo and all
[1:40:33] these other things what will they do
[1:40:34] there look see
[1:40:35] they'll take the money from Rome and
[1:40:37] then she sold her very birthright Rome
[1:40:39] backs are up yes sir
[1:40:40] she'll back it up and they're getting
[1:40:42] enough policy now getting enough around
[1:40:43] then bringing in this cabinet look at
[1:40:45] what mr. Kennedy is asking for this is
[1:40:47] back in the 60s it's getting to a point
[1:40:50] where this thing needs a bailout and
[1:40:52] when it starts to go down and the next
[1:40:53] one there is no government is going to
[1:40:56] be able to bail this thing out on the
[1:40:58] next recession if not the next one the
[1:41:01] one after that there's no source to
[1:41:04] barrel this thing out apart from true
[1:41:07] value yeah and you think even during the
[1:41:10] Dark Ages a time of penance you know
[1:41:12] listen this for you get pin it for
[1:41:14] everything it's been so much wealth
[1:41:16] accumulated and this way and even since
[1:41:18] the since the fifties the value of gold
[1:41:20] has gone from $35 an ounce to in some
[1:41:22] cases 2000 if you hold gold you've
[1:41:25] become very very wealthy over the last
[1:41:28] 60 70 years your holdings have
[1:41:31] skyrocketed this is a good one here
[1:41:36] furthermore the elec will not only be
[1:41:38] kicked by this would I only be kicked
[1:41:42] but as this move becomes the Emoji
[1:41:44] Richter to the beasts the Saints will be
[1:41:45] gone in the rapture and this little
[1:41:51] design 'full once a movement they
[1:41:53] started out in fellowship at Ephesus
[1:41:54] will become a monster of Satan that
[1:41:55] defiles and deceives the whole world for
[1:41:57] the church system of the Roman Catholic
[1:41:59] Church and the Protestant and coming
[1:42:00] together will control the whole wealth
[1:42:02] of the world system and force the whole
[1:42:03] earth into its religious trap will will
[1:42:05] kill them by refusing them the privilege
[1:42:07] of buying and selling whereby they would
[1:42:09] make a living
[1:42:10] okay now the system is still going to be
[1:42:12] the currency as we know it but most of
[1:42:15] it's all digital now you know imagine if
[1:42:19] you couldn't access your bank accounts
[1:42:20] one day life almost as you know it would
[1:42:23] stop imagine if you you couldn't then
[1:42:26] pay your phone you'd have no phone you
[1:42:29] couldn't pay your power you couldn't pay
[1:42:33] your rent life as you know it would stop
[1:42:37] very quickly if you didn't have access
[1:42:39] to digits and be able to operate in that
[1:42:42] trade it would stop very very quickly
[1:42:43] and I believe brother Graham said that
[1:42:45] we will actually be here during the
[1:42:47] start of all that you know
[1:42:48] and you can see it just happening life
[1:42:53] is not going to go on as we know it
[1:42:54] enjoyable and this is happening this is
[1:42:57] reality this will be a couple of seventy
[1:43:00] for the harlots daughters are all but
[1:43:02] gone back into here and the meantime
[1:43:03] Rome has acquired nearly all the
[1:43:04] supplies of gold the Jews have the bonds
[1:43:07] in all the paper their tenders to the
[1:43:08] dollar at the right time the harlot will
[1:43:11] destroy the present-day money system by
[1:43:13] calling in all the paper and demanding
[1:43:15] gold with no gold the system fails the
[1:43:17] Jews will be trapped and coming to an
[1:43:19] alliance the harlot church will take
[1:43:21] over the whole world okay now this is
[1:43:26] quite simple when you understand what's
[1:43:27] happening you can see how this could
[1:43:28] happen how did he know all of us and now
[1:43:32] I wouldn't let you know other people
[1:43:33] aren't saying this you're not saying
[1:43:35] this I want to read you this from this
[1:43:38] is a bit of a longer reading from
[1:43:39] Revelation but I want to read you this
[1:43:41] to just see that this is scriptural you
[1:43:45] know we think of the Catholic Church as
[1:43:46] a few buildings in there it's more than
[1:43:48] that and when you they're described in
[1:43:51] this passage you understand these this
[1:43:52] is more than just a few old priests with
[1:43:55] some old ladies having a service there
[1:43:57] is far more to it than this I'll just
[1:44:02] read it from this one and after these
[1:44:05] things I saw another angel this is
[1:44:06] talking about the Catholic Church come
[1:44:08] down from heaven having great power and
[1:44:10] the earth was lightened with his glory
[1:44:11] and he cried mightily with a strong
[1:44:13] voice saying Babylon the Great is fallen
[1:44:14] is fallen and has become the habitation
[1:44:16] of devils and the hold of every foul
[1:44:18] spirit and a cage of every unclean and
[1:44:20] hateful bird for all nations have drunk
[1:44:22] of the wine of the wrath of her
[1:44:23] fornication and the kings of the earth
[1:44:25] have committed fornication with her and
[1:44:27] the merchants of the earth are waxed
[1:44:29] rich through the abundance of her
[1:44:31] delicacies the merchants of the earth
[1:44:34] are waxed rich and I heard another voice
[1:44:36] from heaven saying come out of her my
[1:44:37] people and be not partakers of her sins
[1:44:39] that he received not of her plagues for
[1:44:41] his sins have reached unto heaven and
[1:44:42] God hath remembered her iniquities
[1:44:44] reward her even as she rewarded you and
[1:44:46] double her and double unto her double
[1:44:49] according to her works and the cup which
[1:44:51] she hath filled fill to her double how
[1:44:54] much she has glorified herself and lived
[1:44:56] deliciously so much torment and sorrow
[1:44:59] good for her for she saith in her heart
[1:45:01] I am a queen and
[1:45:02] no Widow and shall see no sorrow
[1:45:04] therefore shall her plagues come in one
[1:45:06] day death mourning and famine and she
[1:45:07] shall be utterly burned with fire for
[1:45:09] strong as the Lord God who judges there
[1:45:10] and the kings of the earth the kings of
[1:45:13] the earth who have committed fornication
[1:45:15] and lived deliciously with her shall
[1:45:18] bewail here and lament to it for they
[1:45:19] shall see the smoke of her burning am I
[1:45:21] going along this or is that here Hey
[1:45:25] okay okay so be well here and limit for
[1:45:34] here and they shall see the smoker
[1:45:35] through burning standing afar off for
[1:45:37] the fear of her torment saying alas alas
[1:45:39] that great city Babylon that mighty City
[1:45:41] from one hour though judgment has come
[1:45:43] and the merchants of the earth shall
[1:45:46] weep and mourn over her for no man
[1:45:49] buyeth their merchandise anymore the
[1:45:51] merchants of the earth the merchandise
[1:45:55] of gold and silver and precious stones
[1:45:58] and pearls in fine linen and purple and
[1:46:01] silk and scarlet and all thyine wood and
[1:46:05] all manner of vessels of ivory and all
[1:46:06] manner of vessels of precious wood and
[1:46:08] of brass and iron and marble and
[1:46:10] cinnamon and odours and ointments and
[1:46:12] frankincense and wine and oil and fine
[1:46:14] flour and wheat and beasts and sheep and
[1:46:17] horses and chariots and slaves and souls
[1:46:20] of men that's what these guys dealing
[1:46:24] and the merchants of the earth deal with
[1:46:26] these guys with all the stuff this is
[1:46:30] not a little Church with the priests and
[1:46:32] if your old ladies this is the
[1:46:36] essentially the queen of the world of
[1:46:39] this natural world that we know doing
[1:46:40] business with the world and I believe
[1:46:43] the further up the ladder you get the
[1:46:44] more you've got to do business with
[1:46:46] these people
[1:46:46] that's what the Bible says they are
[1:46:49] dealing in everything sheep cattle
[1:46:53] probably Fonterra and somewhere has to
[1:46:56] be involved somehow you understand the
[1:46:58] magnitude of this yeah and they've got
[1:47:01] they have accumulated all the wealth the
[1:47:04] actual gold the wealth no one's really
[1:47:06] we've got stuff but in order to have use
[1:47:09] your stuff you've got to have a currency
[1:47:10] to use it
[1:47:13] and the fruits that thy soul lusted
[1:47:14] after are departed from thee and thou
[1:47:21] shalt find them no more at all the
[1:47:22] merchants of these things which were
[1:47:24] made rich by her shall stand afar off
[1:47:26] for the fear of her torment weeping and
[1:47:29] wailing and saying alas that great city
[1:47:31] which was closed and fine linen in
[1:47:33] purple and scarlet and decked with gold
[1:47:34] and precious stones and pearls for was
[1:47:36] for in one hour so great riches has come
[1:47:39] to nought and every shipmaster and all
[1:47:41] the company of ships and sailors and as
[1:47:43] many as trade by sea stood afar off and
[1:47:45] cry when they saw as many as trade by
[1:47:47] sea they just cried when they saw stood
[1:47:51] afar off and cried when they saw the
[1:47:52] smoke of her burning saying what city is
[1:47:53] like unto this great city and they cast
[1:47:55] the stone they hidden cry weeping
[1:47:57] wailing saying alas alas that great city
[1:47:59] wearin were made rich all that had ships
[1:48:02] by in the sea by reason of their
[1:48:04] coastlines for in one hour she is made
[1:48:06] desolate but joist over here they are
[1:48:08] hidden than you holy apostles and
[1:48:09] prophets for God has avenged you on her
[1:48:13] all the ships on the sea Greece has a
[1:48:16] mess of shipping industry that's all
[1:48:19] involved you can't tell me it's not
[1:48:20] involved if this is what the Bible says
[1:48:25] okay now this is why I want to slightly
[1:48:28] turn this a different way but I want to
[1:48:29] show you something that's happening
[1:48:31] that's puzzling for me but I let no man
[1:48:37] deceive you by any means for this
[1:48:38] Sheldon for that day shall not come
[1:48:39] except there come a falling away first
[1:48:41] and that man of sin be revealed the son
[1:48:42] of perdition who opposeth and exalteth
[1:48:45] himself against all that is called God
[1:48:47] or that is worshipped so that he as God
[1:48:49] sitteth in the temple of self that he is
[1:48:50] God
[1:48:51] there's the scripture we read earlier so
[1:48:53] now it's saying that eventually there is
[1:48:55] going to be a time where Satan is going
[1:48:56] to be in the Church of God being
[1:48:58] worshipped as he is God eventually
[1:49:00] that's the way that this is going to
[1:49:01] happen and this is going to be a
[1:49:04] spiritual thing not a it's not going to
[1:49:06] be what do you call someone that's like
[1:49:09] an atheist it's not going to be a
[1:49:11] non-christian it's going to be a
[1:49:14] spiritual thing right
[1:49:16] well this yellow rose false Christ's and
[1:49:18] false prophets and shall show great
[1:49:21] signs and wonders insomuch that if it
[1:49:23] were possible they shall deceive the
[1:49:24] very elect
[1:49:25] but this is
[1:49:25] what's gonna happen and this this age I
[1:49:28] think this may be closer to home but you
[1:49:33] think there's want to go on a different
[1:49:34] track here for a minute okay because
[1:49:36] this is an interesting this puzzled me
[1:49:39] for years but I think it's starting to
[1:49:40] make sense now right if you have been
[1:49:43] following if you who's like a conspiracy
[1:49:46] theorist type person who thinks that way
[1:49:49] you know you're kind of you liked a
[1:49:52] Christian things you like I'm not sure
[1:49:53] I'm thinking something else going on
[1:49:55] here and it you kind of get drawn to
[1:49:56] things that you think hmm
[1:49:58] you'd rather kind of believe that then
[1:50:00] believe what someone else
[1:50:01] the major idea of it right I think like
[1:50:05] that because I kind of think you
[1:50:08] understand that things are not what they
[1:50:09] seem right now if you're following this
[1:50:13] there's been a main drive in this world
[1:50:19] that's been pointing out the Anakin's
[1:50:23] conspiratorial kind of way the enemy
[1:50:26] right pointing out for years this has
[1:50:28] been going on probably since the
[1:50:29] seventies but has been pointing out the
[1:50:31] evil enemy that is arising right and and
[1:50:38] they are pointing out like you talk
[1:50:40] about the New World Order and things
[1:50:41] like that right they've been pointing
[1:50:42] out this evil enemy that that is the
[1:50:46] enemy of God essentially because a lot
[1:50:48] of these people are Christian people
[1:50:49] right and they have been coming in to
[1:50:52] try and overthrow essentially everything
[1:50:56] that's godly right that's really the
[1:51:00] this really has been the the the thrust
[1:51:02] of this right and and if you look into
[1:51:04] all these when you start digging at it
[1:51:05] you see you can see evil from this
[1:51:10] perspective you can see this evil coming
[1:51:12] in now how they've gotten left and right
[1:51:15] to be left to be kind of even a right to
[1:51:17] be good i it's beyond me because it's
[1:51:20] where a righteous King has thinks both
[1:51:23] ways you know he's not going to he's
[1:51:24] going to help a person here then he
[1:51:26] wants people to work here he actually a
[1:51:27] righteous King thinks reasonably fear
[1:51:32] judgment right so left and right as
[1:51:33] nonsense has just been created to make
[1:51:35] us have to take a side right it's it's
[1:51:38] nonsense
[1:51:39] it's not justice but but in a weird sort
[1:51:44] of a way the idea has been that this
[1:51:48] whole thrust from the now they call it
[1:51:50] the leaf but it's it's not don't get me
[1:51:52] wrong it's not true right but the thrust
[1:51:53] has been they want to take out God out
[1:51:55] of everything they want to destroy the
[1:51:58] monetary system of the world so that
[1:52:00] these evil people can take over that the
[1:52:01] evil people that are and the the
[1:52:04] Freemason Illuminati kind of like their
[1:52:06] evil satanic people that that want to
[1:52:09] take over the world and an evil way and
[1:52:12] we've got to stop them and now they've
[1:52:15] taken over the news media they've taken
[1:52:16] over major corporations they've taken
[1:52:18] over Facebook if they all and all these
[1:52:19] things and they're coming in like an
[1:52:21] it's an onslaught and the Christian has
[1:52:23] got a fight against this thing if you
[1:52:27] read into it that's the DES the main
[1:52:29] thrust of this of this whole thing right
[1:52:31] and that's why I put up these these this
[1:52:34] article here say about the news the news
[1:52:35] today is so strange that it's that's out
[1:52:40] in the open that all these people for
[1:52:42] that side these ones are for that side
[1:52:43] that's not news news they're people that
[1:52:47] come and they tell you I went and talked
[1:52:50] to so this happened there that happened
[1:52:51] there that happened there they tell you
[1:52:53] the news that's supposed to be unbiased
[1:52:55] right that's what news is supposed to be
[1:52:57] but as it's come to such a deluded point
[1:53:01] to where it's depending on what opinion
[1:53:03] you want you watch this one if you want
[1:53:04] you if you're of that way of thinking
[1:53:06] you what's just one of you go that way
[1:53:07] of thinking they give you a different
[1:53:08] Pacific idea on the same you vent
[1:53:10] different slant on it and a lot of the
[1:53:13] news you read now our opinion pieces
[1:53:15] this is this person's opinion on that
[1:53:17] it's not the news on that we're not I
[1:53:21] don't like any of it because I don't go
[1:53:23] with any side because like I said
[1:53:26] earlier our we're are different people
[1:53:30] don't get sucked into all us think it
[1:53:34] sucked then we're not of all of us but
[1:53:37] yet when you look at it right from if
[1:53:39] you if you have got a bit of
[1:53:41] Christianity in you and a godly sort of
[1:53:43] outlook you start to look at this and
[1:53:45] think we've got problems we've got this
[1:53:47] evil enemy coming in and they've classed
[1:53:49] that as the left don't know how
[1:53:52] and and then when you look at the news
[1:53:55] organizations in it
[1:53:56] the majority of them are leaning left
[1:53:59] and this is in its known right and it
[1:54:02] seems like the enemy's coming in you
[1:54:06] know they're taken over everything
[1:54:07] do you understand what I'm saying right
[1:54:09] this is sort of this is the they're kind
[1:54:12] of the Christian way of thinking
[1:54:14] don't be deceived by it right and even
[1:54:17] the major the major all the media
[1:54:19] companies and all that you're all
[1:54:21] left-leaning and lifters like in New
[1:54:25] Zealand we've got labour a national we
[1:54:26] know labour is going what was left and
[1:54:27] right there sort of thing and in the
[1:54:29] States obviously as the Democrats and
[1:54:31] the Republicans Democrats being left and
[1:54:33] right and so and these people are
[1:54:36] leaning that way because they're trying
[1:54:37] to push these values of and they say
[1:54:39] it's abortion and all these sort of
[1:54:40] things and you know you're the parents
[1:54:42] don't have rights over the children the
[1:54:43] children can be their own it's you're a
[1:54:45] child of the state not a child of your
[1:54:47] parents and all these sorts of ideas
[1:54:48] right so the Christian is now saying
[1:54:51] we've got a fight against the idea cuz
[1:54:52] that's my child and I'm according to God
[1:54:54] I'm the head of that child and all these
[1:54:55] sorts of things right don't be fooled by
[1:54:58] that's been made up why no we believe it
[1:55:00] but don't get caught up in this you'll
[1:55:03] see why in a minute it's it's it's all
[1:55:06] of Satan right but just to show you that
[1:55:09] if you were thinking about it you
[1:55:11] wouldn't you would start to be worried
[1:55:12] right like companies like this is um
[1:55:15] Apple Apple the company we all give
[1:55:21] money to products okay when they make
[1:55:28] political donations their percent that
[1:55:33] they donated three three million the
[1:55:35] percentage that are donated to the
[1:55:36] Republican Party the right was 10% and
[1:55:41] the percentage they donated to the
[1:55:43] Democrats was 87 percent right so so you
[1:55:47] could you'd look at this you think well
[1:55:49] they are of you're an evil company you
[1:55:51] know they're of that that way if you're
[1:55:54] a Christian you go to and there are
[1:55:57] quite an influential company right and
[1:55:58] they hold a lot of information Facebook
[1:56:02] Facebook was even worse they
[1:56:04] gave a couple of million it'll be more
[1:56:07] than that 7% went to the Christian right
[1:56:12] which is nonsense and 91% went to their
[1:56:16] evil left okay that's a that's a biased
[1:56:22] way now that now they're gin you want
[1:56:27] people in there that actually push that
[1:56:28] way it's that's happening like that
[1:56:30] right it's happening that way like their
[1:56:32] posts they're getting since it's even
[1:56:35] there's a big there's a war happening
[1:56:37] now about this there's a war it's
[1:56:40] fighting don't get involved in it it's
[1:56:42] nonsense
[1:56:42] it's absolute nonsense and if you if you
[1:56:49] don't portray the correct I'll leave it
[1:56:58] Microsoft the same 18% to the
[1:57:01] Republicans 80% to the Democrats right
[1:57:05] so now if you're a conspiracy theorist
[1:57:07] you're looking at this and you're
[1:57:08] looking at all that control these guys
[1:57:09] have gotten yours and all these major
[1:57:11] corporations in the end you're starting
[1:57:14] to think it's this evil left ungodly
[1:57:17] evil people that are coming in to take
[1:57:19] over that's what you're thinking right
[1:57:21] and you and you're going to associate
[1:57:22] them with the monetary system this and
[1:57:24] you would order that cease evil people
[1:57:25] that are coming in to squash that
[1:57:26] Christianity I've never quite understood
[1:57:28] that because when I read my Bible it
[1:57:30] says I think seems like I mean and even
[1:57:33] from my perception of watching this over
[1:57:35] the years I'm thinking Christianity as
[1:57:37] we know it as is being beaten and yet
[1:57:40] how can it say it it's going to be this
[1:57:41] brother Brown talks about the image
[1:57:43] being there you know everyone has to
[1:57:46] take the mark and and or would they know
[1:57:48] they they will make a the church will
[1:57:50] rule and you think it doesn't look like
[1:57:52] the church is gonna be ruling anytime
[1:57:53] soon it looks like it's being defeated
[1:57:55] and liberal is what you'd call him all
[1:57:57] their articles were about you know the
[1:57:59] downfall of Christianity it's all over
[1:58:00] it's doomed
[1:58:01] you know we're winning yippee that's
[1:58:03] what's been happening right now people
[1:58:07] like this there's there's many many
[1:58:10] conspiracy like ways right and they're
[1:58:12] mainly Christian people they have been
[1:58:15] supposedly picking up what's happening
[1:58:17] in been blasting it to fight
[1:58:18] this evil thing we've gotta fight
[1:58:20] against it you know that's what that's
[1:58:23] the idea right
[1:58:25] I understand once again don't get caught
[1:58:27] no that's not happening that way not
[1:58:31] happening that way now that's why these
[1:58:34] people they thought about see Obama was
[1:58:38] supposedly left you know and and he he
[1:58:41] was this evil one that was bringing all
[1:58:42] the stuff and you know you could no
[1:58:44] longer say Merry Christmas and Walmart
[1:58:46] you had to say Happy Holidays he's
[1:58:47] getting Christ out of everything you
[1:58:48] notice he was to see they they were part
[1:58:51] of this evil group that wanted to do
[1:58:52] away with Christianity that's what was
[1:58:56] happening right that's the perception
[1:58:57] and that's what the fight was against it
[1:58:59] wasn't about who he was or anything it
[1:59:00] was against this idea right this and his
[1:59:03] fights been brewing under the surface
[1:59:04] against this idea and people are
[1:59:06] researching and thinking I can see
[1:59:07] what's happening the media's going that
[1:59:09] way the food corporations going that way
[1:59:10] the government's going that way it's all
[1:59:12] coming against our Christian values in
[1:59:13] our Christianity and they want to take
[1:59:15] over our children to make nanny States
[1:59:17] and all that sort of thing that's that's
[1:59:18] the there's a fight against there right
[1:59:20] and so when the people saw that someone
[1:59:25] like Hillary which they they think or
[1:59:27] she impersonates everything that that is
[1:59:29] she's probably a very nice person by the
[1:59:31] way I'm not going to say anything bad
[1:59:34] about people that I don't know do you
[1:59:36] know what I mean you know people just
[1:59:38] bash them best and best and she's
[1:59:39] probably quite nice you going with a bub
[1:59:41] ever dry with her she'd be quite nice
[1:59:43] she tell you some nice stories you know
[1:59:44] and I wouldn't say no I'd enjoy it you
[1:59:47] know they're still people the same as us
[1:59:49] right but now if you see that happening
[1:59:52] and you see she almost embodies
[1:59:54] everything that it was this evil
[1:59:57] darkness coming in and and if you're a
[2:00:00] Christian your prank you understand
[2:00:04] you're praying god no god no if she gets
[2:00:08] in that's gonna just take everything
[2:00:09] over they've got the media they've got
[2:00:11] the corporation's they've got all the
[2:00:12] businesses they're going to take over
[2:00:13] everything that's what's gonna happen
[2:00:15] God deliver us do you understand I
[2:00:22] should have had the photo of Trump here
[2:00:24] inter
[2:00:27] there's an N called Trump okay that was
[2:00:34] going to fight against this the whole
[2:00:36] thing I'm gonna stand up for Christian
[2:00:38] values I'm gonna be a champion of
[2:00:41] Christianity you're gonna say Merry
[2:00:42] Christmas
[2:00:43] instead of Happy Holidays I'm coming in
[2:00:45] the name of the Lord right that's what
[2:00:50] this that's what the whole election was
[2:00:52] about this man's not a Christian
[2:00:56] whatsoever whatsoever but he came out
[2:01:01] saying I'm going to fight in the name of
[2:01:02] the Lord that's what this election was
[2:01:05] about that's what it was about and that
[2:01:08] that and that's why he got all these
[2:01:10] votes because it was people that
[2:01:11] understood this supposedly understood
[2:01:15] what was happening and they said here's
[2:01:16] a man that we can back that's going to
[2:01:18] fight it because he even we're not Alex
[2:01:20] Jones Show and said I'm going to order
[2:01:21] at the Federal Reserve because they all
[2:01:22] know that this Federal Reserve is a no
[2:01:25] one knows where the money is no audit of
[2:01:27] it ever what's going on he's saying I'm
[2:01:28] gonna audit them saying all the right
[2:01:30] things
[2:01:31] yeah audit them fear the bad guys I'll
[2:01:34] do that
[2:01:35] do you understand this is what happened
[2:01:38] and all the Christians got on board they
[2:01:43] backed the heathen but then like they
[2:01:46] argue what are our options right and for
[2:01:49] all money for all money he had he had no
[2:01:53] chance of winning you know in the
[2:01:56] primary is this saying he says he walks
[2:01:58] down his elevator no he doesn't walk
[2:02:01] sorry see he stands and he goes down and
[2:02:04] he says I'm gonna run for president the
[2:02:07] next day it was the laughingstock of the
[2:02:08] world what a joke no Trump man the man
[2:02:12] that says you're fired he was a joke and
[2:02:15] he started winning winning winning
[2:02:17] winning everyone saying well he's
[2:02:19] winning he start saying all the right
[2:02:22] things now building a wall is not about
[2:02:26] I don't want people coming in that's
[2:02:27] about I don't want other cultures and
[2:02:29] religions coming in here diluting our
[2:02:32] religion and taking over because he
[2:02:33] looked at Europe he says look in Europe
[2:02:35] they're leading and I'm not political
[2:02:37] don't get me wrong I'm not saying this
[2:02:38] to back any point of view because the
[2:02:39] whole thing
[2:02:40] but he's saying look in Europe they've
[2:02:41] it and he knows and all the people that
[2:02:43] conspiracy theorists know they're doing
[2:02:45] this they're letting in all these people
[2:02:46] from these other countries they don't
[2:02:48] mind the people they don't want the
[2:02:49] religion there and they're saying in
[2:02:51] these countries now these Muslim
[2:02:52] religions all these other religions are
[2:02:53] coming in and taking over our religion
[2:02:56] that's what they don't want and he knew
[2:02:58] that he's saying I'm gonna stop that cuz
[2:03:00] I don't want all that I don't want to be
[2:03:02] flooded by non-christian immigrants then
[2:03:05] I'm going to change the culture of our
[2:03:06] country and if you're a Christian you're
[2:03:08] gonna say yeah you understand what I
[2:03:11] mean that's what you're going to say yes
[2:03:12] keep them out
[2:03:13] you're not saying don't let them come in
[2:03:15] they're saying we don't want we want
[2:03:17] Christianity preserved that's what this
[2:03:19] is about that was the whole thing
[2:03:23] don't back any of it we're not part of
[2:03:28] the Saints like I said it's that you
[2:03:29] have no seat at this table now this is
[2:03:32] this is the LA Times they had Clinton
[2:03:37] this these are their you know how many
[2:03:39] seats are going to get who's going to
[2:03:40] win the election this was up to the day
[2:03:42] before Clinton is going to get 352 and
[2:03:45] 286 these are I'm what do they call this
[2:03:48] in the there's the called certain seats
[2:03:53] but it's not like in the house it's like
[2:03:54] I can't remember the name Shannon
[2:03:56] actually wouldn't know she doesn't
[2:03:57] really follow politics even though she's
[2:03:59] an American right so here's this poll LA
[2:04:02] Times 33 and 52 to 186 another poll
[2:04:05] Clinton is going to win 323 to 197 you
[2:04:08] know these are polls a day before 302 to
[2:04:11] 235 to 74 to 190 every poll had Hillary
[2:04:16] winning Trump losing another one I think
[2:04:19] there was 228 to 164 322 to two one six
[2:04:25] okay so if you're a Christian if you're
[2:04:29] if you're if you were trying to go for
[2:04:30] this you're thinking we're going to lose
[2:04:32] you know this evil thing is going to
[2:04:35] come in and take over now this is the
[2:04:36] end of it because once they give another
[2:04:38] four years and the momentum that it's
[2:04:40] going because there have been eight
[2:04:41] years remember eight years of this
[2:04:42] momentum it's all over then what
[2:04:47] happened by some miracle you understand
[2:04:52] by miracle our champion won praise God
[2:04:59] I'm not making fun of it but I'm telling
[2:05:01] you that's what happened praise God
[2:05:03] revival broke out wow we won not we but
[2:05:10] God one to fight away this evil that's
[2:05:15] what happened and then essentially an
[2:05:18] inept way it was almost a miracle
[2:05:22] because all the lifts were like leaning
[2:05:24] that way and all the news media was
[2:05:25] saying and yet somehow or another some
[2:05:28] knight in shining armor came slashing
[2:05:30] through everything and fought and fought
[2:05:32] and fought and fought that's what
[2:05:35] happened that's why now you see videos
[2:05:37] of Trump and they the Oh heaven the
[2:05:40] super imposes hit on IRISA and haven't
[2:05:42] gone out to the WWF stage and then
[2:05:45] taking the news media like CNN and
[2:05:46] smashing them into the ground you know
[2:05:48] because he's he's this big hero that's
[2:05:50] gonna come out wipe out all the enemies
[2:05:52] you understand that's what's been
[2:05:56] happening hey that's the it was the feel
[2:05:58] amongst that the conspiracy even them
[2:06:01] guys like um Alex Jones you know he
[2:06:04] couldn't believe once they won he
[2:06:05] couldn't believe
[2:06:06] Wow and then and even guys that weren't
[2:06:08] that were very big conspiracy theorists
[2:06:10] guys were in the White House like these
[2:06:13] were guys that only had I forget the
[2:06:15] guys name he was they got him at after
[2:06:18] war because I think they couldn't take
[2:06:19] the heat from him but they were they
[2:06:20] basically very hardcore conspiracy type
[2:06:23] guys running a country now people think
[2:06:25] I can't believe this our guys are in
[2:06:27] there running the show now they're gonna
[2:06:28] get rid of all these bad guys you know
[2:06:30] you couldn't it was unbelievable that
[2:06:33] guy from Bray Bart news you know the he
[2:06:38] yes they've been a year like he he was
[2:06:42] supposedly your authority on seeing this
[2:06:44] and he was ended up in the White House
[2:06:45] and you going Wow out guys with you know
[2:06:47] the Christian people thinking wow he's
[2:06:48] gonna get rid of the Illuminati you know
[2:06:52] and then the next thing the next thing
[2:06:55] that they that he got was he gotta for
[2:06:57] his vice president was a devout
[2:06:59] Christian man Mike Pence
[2:07:01] once again probably a very very nice guy
[2:07:04] right I want to read you some of the
[2:07:05] quotes that
[2:07:06] said what the American people need is
[2:07:10] not more health care what we need is
[2:07:11] more Jesus care I believe that if we can
[2:07:15] just get more of these people with
[2:07:17] pre-existing health conditions back into
[2:07:18] churches you would see a lot of healings
[2:07:20] and many of these problems would just go
[2:07:22] away people who lead godly lives don't
[2:07:25] worry about doctors we have the Lord to
[2:07:26] take care of us he's your man yeah he's
[2:07:31] your man this is this one here is from
[2:07:36] September this year two months ago Mike
[2:07:40] Pence any time I am criticized for my
[2:07:43] belief in Jesus Christ I just breathed
[2:07:44] the prayer phrase do you do the same
[2:07:46] yes in an interview with Christian
[2:07:51] Broadcasting Network CBN Penn said the
[2:07:54] Bible says count it all joy when you
[2:07:56] endure trials of many kinds any time I'm
[2:07:59] criticized for my belief in Jesus Christ
[2:08:01] I just breathed the prayer praise this
[2:08:04] is the second most powerful man in the
[2:08:06] United States saying I'm a servant of
[2:08:08] Jesus Christ if you're a Christian
[2:08:10] you're having a revival right about now
[2:08:12] this is unbelievable you understand this
[2:08:16] is unbelievable
[2:08:18] can you play that this is that this is
[2:08:20] the primaries this is just a couple of I
[2:08:22] think this is Terry Evangelic values of
[2:08:25] love charity and faith built this nation
[2:08:34] so how can it be that our media treats
[2:08:37] people of faith so poorly one of the
[2:08:41] reasons is that our politicians have
[2:08:45] really abandoned you to a large extent
[2:08:47] and Hillary Clinton you can forget about
[2:08:52] her so let me say this right up front a
[2:08:59] trump administration our Christian
[2:09:04] heritage will be cherished protected
[2:09:08] defended like you've never seen before
[2:09:13] [Applause]
[2:09:15] believe me
[2:09:19] [Applause]
[2:09:24] I believe it and you believe it and you
[2:09:26] know it you know it and that includes
[2:09:32] religious liberty remember remember now
[2:09:40] these things were said all through the
[2:09:41] primaries I come in the name of the Lord
[2:09:45] and if you look at it from that
[2:09:47] perspective you could say God one play
[2:09:53] that one I don't know what this one is
[2:09:54] both counts
[2:09:55] well next guests thought he would never
[2:09:57] vote for Donald Trump would like
[2:10:02] millions of others he did take a look
[2:10:06] the United States so help me God so help
[2:10:09] me God
[2:10:10] Donald Trump stunned the nation by
[2:10:12] becoming the 45th President of the
[2:10:14] United States his victory over Hillary
[2:10:16] Clinton sent shockwaves around the world
[2:10:18] but many who voted for Trump never
[2:10:21] thought they would
[2:10:22] Steve Strang is the CEO of charisma
[2:10:24] media like many people of faith Steve
[2:10:27] supported Trump only because Ted Cruz
[2:10:30] dropped out of the race after he
[2:10:32] personally interviewed Trump last fall
[2:10:33] Steve became part of a team of Christian
[2:10:36] leaders who backed the future president
[2:10:38] in his book God and Donald Trump Steve
[2:10:41] shares the reasons why he got behind
[2:10:43] this unlikely candidate and explores the
[2:10:46] possibility of a divine intervention
[2:10:48] involved in his election divine
[2:10:53] intervention in his election this is the
[2:10:55] idea right because this is a Christian
[2:10:57] this is God winning this is what's
[2:11:00] happening this is our Mike Pence the
[2:11:05] vice president play this one mr. vice
[2:11:09] president
[2:11:09] thanks for doing this for being here
[2:11:11] with us we appreciate it you bet David
[2:11:13] good good to have you here on the
[2:11:14] National Day of Prayer yeah what a
[2:11:15] wonderful day let me ask you about the
[2:11:17] National Day of Prayer and this White
[2:11:19] House initiative is faith initiative
[2:11:21] explain it a little bit to me exactly
[2:11:23] and also it took a year I mean it didn't
[2:11:26] come out a year ago what why why the
[2:11:28] delay on that well I think what the
[2:11:31] American people have learned in the last
[2:11:32] 15 months
[2:11:34] the people of faith all across this
[2:11:36] nation have a champion in President
[2:11:38] Donald Trump a year ago he said we were
[2:11:42] a nation of faith and he took action
[2:11:44] last year to make sure that the federal
[2:11:46] government never imposed on the
[2:11:48] religious liberty of Americans like in
[2:11:51] cases like the Little Sisters of the
[2:11:52] Poor but this year the President signed
[2:11:55] an executive order in the Rose Garden
[2:11:56] David that establishes a policy
[2:11:59] initiative within the White House that
[2:12:01] puts faith really at the center of
[2:12:04] policy development a champion of the
[2:12:09] faith it's the way it's being looked at
[2:12:19] okay so this here this here is when a
[2:12:22] lot of pastors went to the White House
[2:12:23] and then worship broke out at the White
[2:12:27] House by this
[2:12:33] [Music]
[2:12:39] [Music]
[2:12:51] [Music]
[2:13:09] [Music]
[2:13:22] [Music]
[2:13:31] praise God
[2:13:34] you know did you ever think that was
[2:13:36] possible
[2:13:37] if you're a Christian in America was
[2:13:39] that possible the enemy was coming in
[2:13:42] now they're praising God and the White
[2:13:43] House is revival Christianity is winning
[2:13:48] again that's the idea that's the that's
[2:13:51] the thrust but this is going the way it
[2:13:53] has to be like that's an order for this
[2:13:55] whole thing to come in right couldn't be
[2:13:57] the other way here here's another one
[2:13:58] they're sitting ready having a cabinet
[2:14:00] meeting and he's always prayer this is
[2:14:03] he's not gonna ask I'm ben Carson to
[2:14:05] pray which was one of the nominees that
[2:14:07] he was a surgeon um listens it was words
[2:14:11] he says at the end of his prayer so
[2:14:15] without a good ask Ben Carson you can
[2:14:17] stay if you want it because you need the
[2:14:18] prayer more than I do I think the only
[2:14:21] may be a good solid prayer and they'll
[2:14:23] be honest then is that possible
[2:14:25] something will ask you to say grace we
[2:14:38] thank you for the President and four
[2:14:41] cabinet members who are courageous who
[2:14:44] are willing to face the winds of
[2:14:46] controversy in order to provide a better
[2:14:49] future for those who come behind us
[2:14:52] we're thankful for the unity in Congress
[2:14:56] that presented an opportunity for our
[2:15:00] economy to expand so that we can fight
[2:15:04] the corrosive debt that have been
[2:15:07] destroying our future and we hope that
[2:15:11] that unity will spread even beyond party
[2:15:14] lines so that people recognize that we
[2:15:17] have a nation that is worth saving that
[2:15:21] nation's divided against themselves and
[2:15:24] not stand in this time of discord
[2:15:28] distrust and dishonesty we ask that you
[2:15:32] would give us a spirit of gratitude
[2:15:35] compassion and common sense and give us
[2:15:40] the wisdom to be able to guide this
[2:15:43] great nation in the future we ask in the
[2:15:46] name of the Father the Son and the Holy
[2:15:48] Spirit Mike I don't know Ben but I want
[2:15:57] to say that last but came from a
[2:15:58] grievious wolf this is not God this is
[2:16:04] not God
[2:16:05] this stuff is not God we've got no seat
[2:16:10] at this table no seat this here was the
[2:16:14] nutless here circulated when all the
[2:16:16] pastor's prayed for Donald Trump who
[2:16:19] laid hands on a parade from he said year
[2:16:20] pray for me this was the this is one of
[2:16:24] the men he's actually South African a
[2:16:26] missionary in America this is one of the
[2:16:28] men that I think he prayed at a
[2:16:30] different time but just roll this one
[2:16:31] I've got a few more of these that just
[2:16:32] using Lincoln has to pull away and now
[2:16:36] Steve said before we go we're gonna pray
[2:16:38] and he welcomed that I mean just
[2:16:40] welcomed that we pray in that scripture
[2:16:43] the Bible says in 1 Timothy chapter 2
[2:16:45] and verse 1 I urge you then first of all
[2:16:48] that petitions prayers intercession the
[2:16:50] Thanksgiving be made for all people for
[2:16:52] kings and all those in authority that we
[2:16:54] may live peaceably in quiet lines and
[2:16:56] all godliness and holiness now there's a
[2:16:58] lot of people freaking out because my
[2:17:01] god they prayed in in the Oval Office
[2:17:03] separation should instead
[2:17:04] that's bogus there's no such thing as
[2:17:06] separation of church and state if there
[2:17:07] is such a thing it's means the
[2:17:09] government should not stick his nose
[2:17:10] into the church so people miss they
[2:17:13] misquote things and go you know crazy
[2:17:15] but the fact of the many the founding
[2:17:18] fathers and all about first initial
[2:17:20] presence everything was open in prayer
[2:17:22] the first mega church was in the Capitol
[2:17:24] building George Washington started that
[2:17:26] the Marine Band did the praise and
[2:17:28] worship so have we moved so far away
[2:17:30] from the founding of America that we
[2:17:32] don't even understand how our nation was
[2:17:35] founded and how that then our initial
[2:17:39] these people were people that looked to
[2:17:42] God divine providence and our current
[2:17:45] present president number 45 he
[2:17:47] understands that he realizes that he can
[2:17:49] cannot go further in what he's doing
[2:17:52] without divine intervention in his life
[2:17:54] so this is so imperative so when we were
[2:17:58] in the Oval Office we were surrounded by
[2:18:01] people of different you know Baptist
[2:18:04] they were there were there different
[2:18:06] people Pentecostal and you know majority
[2:18:09] evangelical leaders we all see things
[2:18:12] maybe a little differently but we come
[2:18:14] together with one purpose one cause to
[2:18:17] come pray for our prison we have set
[2:18:19] aside our differences in extra fact even
[2:18:21] when we met privately the leaders of
[2:18:24] some of the largest churches in Van
[2:18:26] Jellicle in America said we must pray
[2:18:28] for one another in stand with one
[2:18:31] another that is HUGE so I see the body
[2:18:35] of Christ coming together because
[2:18:36] American needs another great spiritual
[2:18:38] awakening we had one in the 1700s we had
[2:18:41] one in the 1800s we have to have one now
[2:18:43] without divine intervention
[2:18:45] it's over God has given us with
[2:18:48] President Trump a last-minute reprieve
[2:18:51] but we have a window to see this thing
[2:18:54] turned around because the enemy is so
[2:18:56] upset and what is taking place so you
[2:19:00] know understand that you see the thrust
[2:19:04] of the way this thing's going it's not
[2:19:07] God
[2:19:12] when he goes away his wife preaches I
[2:19:15] just wanted to say that and I did
[2:19:19] actually
[2:19:19] I got his statement of faith and it's
[2:19:21] the same as all the rest of him and
[2:19:23] we're baptizing the Father Son Holy
[2:19:24] Ghost
[2:19:24] it's the same grievious wolf these are
[2:19:27] Grievous wolves I'm not saying the
[2:19:28] manors but this is from Satan this whole
[2:19:31] thing is from Satan the whole thing but
[2:19:34] you know it looks so good because often
[2:19:36] wondered how's the cell like and it
[2:19:37] happened you're never gonna get that
[2:19:38] across the line with Christians they're
[2:19:40] too wise they they can see we're not
[2:19:42] gonna let this evil you know you you
[2:19:46] never would have got it across alarm
[2:19:47] with the Christians in America because
[2:19:48] really when you think about it they were
[2:19:49] the last bastion of freedom that is
[2:19:52] fighting against this whole thing the
[2:19:53] rest of us are too small to be in of any
[2:19:55] significance but it was the Christian
[2:19:56] American people that were was standing
[2:19:58] this whole thing this to me looks like
[2:20:00] it's being twisted around so they're
[2:20:02] going to be supporting it supporting the
[2:20:06] whole thing in for it we get a chance to
[2:20:08] defeat the enemy evil enemy and these
[2:20:10] are gonna be a great revival being
[2:20:13] deceived and about to sell out I've got
[2:20:20] a few more I just wanna I wanted to play
[2:20:21] a few of these just to let it sink in so
[2:20:24] this is happening like now it's probably
[2:20:26] pretty was prayed yesterday there's a
[2:20:29] there's a movement happening it doesn't
[2:20:31] include us it doesn't include the bride
[2:20:33] at all there's no place and I want to
[2:20:36] show you a few bizarre things after this
[2:20:38] this is another this he talked about
[2:20:41] Paul or white this is Donald Trump's
[2:20:43] pastor became who he apparently he
[2:20:46] called her up ten years ago I said I
[2:20:47] watch you on TV and you know can you
[2:20:49] come visit me in Trump Towers and you
[2:20:52] know they talked in there so this is his
[2:20:53] pastor is Paul or white lady I think
[2:20:56] that's significant
[2:21:01] I only know you for sixteen years but to
[2:21:03] serve with your faith leaders and to say
[2:21:05] that you always have put God first and
[2:21:08] you could challenge us and continue to
[2:21:10] challenge us as you lead us we thank you
[2:21:12] for your personal works and this I
[2:21:14] believe is a new beginning for us as we
[2:21:18] look forward we are going to see great
[2:21:20] things come
[2:21:21] thank you for you thank you for thank
[2:21:24] you pastor Jeffers yes prayer let's pray
[2:21:28] together may we yes father your word

[2:21:37] pray and seek your face you will forgive
[2:21:40] their sins and heal their land
[2:21:42] father I thank you that we have a
[2:21:44] president president Donald Trumpkin who
[2:21:47] believes in the power of prayer we thank
[2:21:49] you for a vice president like vice
[2:21:51] president pence who works alongside of
[2:21:54] him and we thank you that the president

[2:22:13] their needs help us to be the embodiment
[2:22:16] of Jesus Christ as we ministered to them

[2:22:24] our country this country has been
[2:22:26] bitterly divided for decades upon

[2:22:31] president Donald Trump who wants to
[2:22:34] bring healing to this country and he is
[2:22:36] bringing healing to this country and I
[2:22:38] pray that you would give him and vice
[2:22:40] president Pence the wisdom they need to
[2:22:43] truly make our country the country you

[2:22:48] great again and we can know that
[2:22:51] American only be great if as America is

[2:22:56] wants to make America good I pray your
[2:22:59] blessing upon him the first lady their
[2:23:01] family give them wisdom as they seek to
[2:23:04] honor you and we pray this in the name
[2:23:06] of the Lord Jesus Christ who came and
[2:23:09] died and rose again that we might have
[2:23:11] eternal life
[2:23:12] it's in his name that we pray amen
[2:23:16] saying a few more things right you
[2:23:21] understand this this is these are
[2:23:23] perilous times I don't think I play the
[2:23:27] sisters has passed they're preaching a
[2:23:29] woman a good-looking woman too
[2:23:33] there seems to be just attracted that
[2:23:38] way
[2:23:38] good-looking younger woman I won't play
[2:23:44] it I just wanted to show you the she's
[2:23:47] very um you seen on you see these
[2:23:51] denominational Borman preaching of the
[2:23:53] dress is usually a bit more nicer but
[2:23:56] this one's very seductive seductively
[2:24:00] dress like very tight and unusual for
[2:24:02] her even for a denominational preacher
[2:24:04] woman she's in very high heels and like
[2:24:06] that way I don't know if there's
[2:24:08] anything in it but I'm just pointing it
[2:24:09] out to you this is not God whatsoever
[2:24:13] and it's it's a it's it's a massive
[2:24:17] movement going a certain way as a
[2:24:20] perilous time I want to play this
[2:24:22] because now it's getting crazy I want to
[2:24:25] show you there you we're not part of
[2:24:26] this any of this right there's now
[2:24:30] protests on the streets left and right
[2:24:32] you know and it's the Christian
[2:24:34] Christians fighting gates the evil
[2:24:36] people this is one of their rallies that
[2:24:41] these people have play this one over the
[2:24:43] conservative group patriot prayer held
[2:24:45] its third rally injustice and lessons
[2:24:49] everybody came here for a higher cause
[2:24:51] it's not ourselves God's we're asking
[2:24:53] you to guide us to take the smarts take
[2:24:55] it to the right spot and make sure we
[2:24:57] show this country what it is to be a
[2:24:59] real American in the name of Jesus
[2:25:00] Christ amen
[2:25:03] Julie Gibson is the founder of peach so
[2:25:05] they pray before they going to have a
[2:25:06] big fight because it's justified because
[2:25:09] we're fighting against this lift
[2:25:11] communist way that's trying to pull down
[2:25:12] our country and this darkness come home
[2:25:14] we're gonna fight against it and they're
[2:25:15] the enemy over there these guys in this
[2:25:17] case they were anti far with just
[2:25:18] anti-fascism near the enemy there
[2:25:20] I've got no sound on this because there
[2:25:22] was a bit of thing but this is now you
[2:25:25] know play this one just elite just to
[2:25:27] see that says these are the bad guys you
[2:25:30] know it's all bad the guys on the the
[2:25:36] right the black of II like the the lift
[2:25:39] wing guys and the guys on the right of
[2:25:40] the Christians there's even Christian
[2:25:42] signage there you see some of them
[2:25:44] somewhere
[2:26:01] I stopped it before the big fight broke
[2:26:04] out but it they they leaned had a big
[2:26:06] punch up and I think that day the
[2:26:07] Christians won they drove back the enemy
[2:26:12] look at this one
[2:26:13] the this man is kicking a man on the
[2:26:16] ground that guy in the blue has just
[2:26:18] punched a woman over and the guy in the
[2:26:20] yellow top they're kicking a man on the
[2:26:22] ground a Christian man Jesus will judge
[2:26:26] you kicking him on the ground see this
[2:26:31] this is now that's not all right that's
[2:26:33] but and with on all these things you get
[2:26:35] it you get it right out this way this is
[2:26:39] I'm not going to any of these rallies
[2:26:40] either side because I'm not part of this
[2:26:42] you understand the bride isn't you don't
[2:26:45] have a seat and anywhere in this we
[2:26:48] don't have a seat if you can't read that
[2:26:52] I just down the bottom here just to read
[2:26:54] these these that you got a Facebook you
[2:26:55] read all the comments about you know
[2:26:57] when there's anything of this nature you
[2:26:59] know and the there's things like Lucifer
[2:27:01] lost this election in this country and
[2:27:05] now he doesn't hide anymore he's
[2:27:06] attacking us from all angles now you
[2:27:08] know cuz they're saying Lucifer's lost
[2:27:10] he's angry that's where all these Anti
[2:27:12] Fog ways are coming out and doing with
[2:27:13] us sort of stuff and everything cuz
[2:27:14] Lucifer lost Satan lost God won we've
[2:27:18] got to push the kingdom of God forward
[2:27:21] they're all part of the World Council of
[2:27:23] Churches all of these people and and
[2:27:25] this is their baptism as father son Holy
[2:27:27] Ghost see grievious wolves taking over
[2:27:31] take heed
[2:27:36] I just want to read this this I've got
[2:27:40] two more quotes and I'm done
[2:27:44] now the this quote is about the food
[2:27:48] pool and about the manifestation of the
[2:27:51] spoken word because the way that you
[2:27:53] look at this all happening it's becoming
[2:27:55] apparent if you're a believer you've got
[2:27:57] no you've got no place in this world and
[2:28:00] it's begin to become physically you
[2:28:02] don't have a place in this world it's
[2:28:04] happening real real quick this is my
[2:28:06] last quote well then it's right at the
[2:28:12] door it's taking over and you're not
[2:28:15] included in the at the table you and I
[2:28:18] are not included anywhere and that's
[2:28:20] what the squeeze is gonna be we're gonna
[2:28:23] be squeak we won't be able to do this
[2:28:26] you might be able to have this what are
[2:28:30] you gonna do what are we gonna do we
[2:28:31] won't have that and it's not something
[2:28:32] that's far off you look at these numbers
[2:28:35] you look at the Westone it's not far off
[2:28:37] that's why I say take heed it's actually
[2:28:40] this is this is reality as we not today
[2:28:44] we've got a our future is going to be
[2:28:46] somewhat different the monitors now it
[2:28:49] is the way that it's going to go it's
[2:28:50] just moving in that direction for other
[2:28:52] MCS now I'm going to say something to
[2:28:54] you now that I haven't said all along
[2:28:56] I'm gonna read it from here
[2:28:58] and then it's the thing that we've
[2:29:00] looked forward to for so long for at
[2:29:01] least maybe many as four or five years
[2:29:03] and maybe longer the third pull it's now
[2:29:04] being vindicated and I'm sure you all
[2:29:05] know what it is now remember you'll
[2:29:07] never be in a personation of there
[2:29:09] because it can't be see it cannot be now
[2:29:10] it's in existent and I have I'm one of
[2:29:13] the SATs own right at this time now it
[2:29:15] just happened so it could identify his
[2:29:17] presence among you but it will not be
[2:29:19] used in a great way until this council
[2:29:20] begins to tighten up and when it does
[2:29:22] when this does the Pentecostals and so
[2:29:24] forth can almost imperson anything that
[2:29:26] can be done but when the time comes when
[2:29:28] the squeeze comes then you'll see what
[2:29:30] you've seen temporarily be manifested
[2:29:32] and the fullness of its power now a
[2:29:35] musket I want to read but all this quote
[2:29:36] now I must continue in evangelism just
[2:29:38] as I was commissioned first I must
[2:29:40] continue on therefore you've had the
[2:29:41] word and you know what to look for how
[2:29:43] to stand I must continue on and
[2:29:44] evangelism and friends of mine keep
[2:29:45] still and just keep moving on for the
[2:29:47] Arabs approaching swiftly see that we
[2:29:49] something is going to be done now you
[2:29:51] might see some little odd things happen
[2:29:53] for me
[2:29:53] nothing simple I don't mean but I mean
[2:29:55] something odd to what the regular trend
[2:29:57] because where I reached to now and the
[2:29:59] ministry I'm dropping back here watching
[2:30:00] that spot and waiting for the time to
[2:30:02] use it but it's going to be used
[2:30:03] everyone knows for a certain as the
[2:30:05] first was identified so as the second
[2:30:07] being identified and if you think real
[2:30:08] hard real close to you who are spiritual
[2:30:10] as the Bible said he he is to hear as to
[2:30:14] him that has wisdom the third is
[2:30:16] properly identify see we know where it
[2:30:17] is so the third pull is here it's so
[2:30:20] sacred I that I mustn't say much about
[2:30:22] it and he told me in the beginning let's
[2:30:24] say nothing of it you remember those
[2:30:25] years ago congregation says they mean it
[2:30:27] speaks for itself see but I've tried to
[2:30:29] explain the others I made a mistake this
[2:30:31] will this will be the thing that to my
[2:30:33] opinion I don't say the Lord tells me
[2:30:35] this this will be the thing that will
[2:30:36] start the rapture in faith for the going
[2:30:38] away see and I must lay quiet for just a
[2:30:40] little while now remember and it was
[2:30:42] this thing on this tape you might see a
[2:30:43] change in my ministry right away
[2:30:44] dropping back not going up dropping back
[2:30:46] we're right at the age now and it can't
[2:30:48] be can't go on any further we have to do
[2:30:50] wait just a minute until this happens
[2:30:51] over here to catch up then the time
[2:30:53] comes but it's already identified the
[2:30:55] years coming at Tom upon in this nation
[2:30:57] to where this nation is going to
[2:30:58] exercise all the power that the Beast
[2:31:00] had before it which was pagan Rome
[2:31:02] before it became when it became papal
[2:31:04] Rome see that this nation will do that
[2:31:07] revelation 13 plainly explains that the
[2:31:09] lamb came up out of the year this other
[2:31:10] beast came up out of the water thickness
[2:31:12] in multitudes of people the slam come up
[2:31:14] we there were no people the lamb
[2:31:15] represents a religion the Lamb of God
[2:31:17] and remember it spoke like a lamb but
[2:31:18] was a lamb and then after a while it
[2:31:20] received power and spoke like a dragon
[2:31:22] and exercised all the power the dragon
[2:31:24] the power of the Dragon had before him
[2:31:26] and the dragon is Rome always see don't
[2:31:28] you see it Roman denomination to mark a
[2:31:29] Protestant denomination and image to the
[2:31:31] Beast making a power that will force all
[2:31:33] Protestants like a union have to be into
[2:31:35] this Council of Churches where you won't
[2:31:36] be able to have any fellowship or well
[2:31:38] it's practically that way now you can't
[2:31:40] go to church and preach and this you
[2:31:41] have a fellowship card or some
[2:31:42] identification and
[2:31:44] now on persons like ourselves we're
[2:31:46] going to be out cut out of all that
[2:31:48] altogether that's exactly because they
[2:31:50] won't be able to do it it's tightening
[2:31:52] and when the time comes and the priest
[2:31:54] comes to a place to where you're pressed
[2:31:56] out then watch what I'm flexing to tell
[2:31:58] you in a few minutes watch the third
[2:31:59] pull then see and it'll be absolutely to
[2:32:01] the total loss but it will be for the
[2:32:03] rydym for the church he saw all this he
[2:32:08] saw all this when we don't have a seat
[2:32:11] at any table there's gonna be a seat at
[2:32:14] the Lord's table for us and you know
[2:32:21] it's going to be worth it if you can
[2:32:26] catch what I mean a bridge won't matter
[2:32:28] then we're under an answer also this
[2:32:33] message is now under an onslaught as
[2:32:35] well and onslaught best thing about a
[2:32:38] bridge let me tell you something when
[2:32:41] the manifestation of the spoken word
[2:32:42] comes out when you need food and you can
[2:32:44] speak for me you can speak your lights
[2:32:45] on bridge is not really gonna matter
[2:32:49] dance then it's not gonna matter and
[2:32:53] this is all happening now you know I've
[2:32:59] got one more scripture I want to bring
[2:33:00] after this but these and one way I'm
[2:33:03] happy because you know that's happening
[2:33:06] the way that the Bible said it would in
[2:33:07] its exciting times but it has still
[2:33:09] perilous times the last scripture I want
[2:33:12] to give you as this because when you
[2:33:14] think about it when when the squeeze
[2:33:16] really comes on what are you gonna have
[2:33:18] and what am I gonna head hey we're going
[2:33:21] to have the Lord what else are we gonna
[2:33:23] have each other they're gonna be your
[2:33:26] only friends we're going to be what
[2:33:30] sister henna
[2:33:31] is gonna mean so much more to me the
[2:33:33] more the squeeze comes on cuz its Christ
[2:33:35] in here it's gonna mean so much more to
[2:33:36] me I say that like not that she doesn't
[2:33:38] now but that's just reality of how we
[2:33:40] work you're gonna mean a lot more to me
[2:33:44] when the squeeze is on when we don't
[2:33:45] have anything else when we've got each
[2:33:48] other inflate and the Spirit of God
[2:33:50] coming into meetings and faith rising
[2:33:54] it's gonna meet amazing time but it's
[2:33:57] only for the bride it's only for the
[2:33:59] bride everyone else is going into it the
[2:34:01] Christians are going to go into this
[2:34:02] heat long walk into it but the bride not
[2:34:06] going to walk into it
[2:34:07] we're walking out of here out of it and
[2:34:10] that's why Peter says Paul says not
[2:34:13] forsaking the assembling of yourselves
[2:34:14] together as the manner of some is but
[2:34:17] exhorting one another and so the more as
[2:34:20] you see the Day approaching I don't know
[2:34:24] about you but that's all I can see that
[2:34:25] they are approaching I can't see
[2:34:27] anything else in the news so that's
[2:34:33] that's front-page news people according
[2:34:37] to according to the prophet of God and
[2:34:40] according to his word I mean let some
[2:34:42] stand and sing turn it off let's
