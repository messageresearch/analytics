that father Lord God it's your people Lord it's all about you father Lord I don't want to show what I know and what I don't know it's all about you father God it's your people Lord so I ain't myself

and when we leave your Lord may the people say they heard from God not from 30 they heard from God so we can make the service into your hands Lord in Jesus name Amen and amen amen while you standing will just read a scripture quickly amen and praise the Lord will read Acts chapter 2 and then maybe you can also keep him and Ephesians chapter 5 amen well known scripture Acts chapter 2 verse 1 and the Bible says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly they came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and they appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance amen and in just one more scripture Ephesians 5 praise the Lord amen I believe it's 27 visions 5:27 and it says that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated in his presence amen amen so god bless you this morning a man and just greetings in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen I have to admit I have to be honest I mean we were we were very tempted just to slip in again like we did the last time and

pressure our precious pastor Ben and his precious wife I mean god bless you amen thank you for the confidence in that you have a meant to open your pulpit this morning amen and I always say I I don't consider myself a preacher I consider myself I'm a worshiper and when my calling in church is to worship God amen and I just don't need a church to do that it's my life worshiping God because I consider myself to be in Revelation chapter 5 Amen I I say because the brother branham said John types the bride and so if John types the bride and if I say I'm the bride then man because the Bible says in Revelation 5 everyone in heaven and earth under the earth said John said heard I John Amen so a lot of people tell me well you from Africa and Africans are supposed to be say no no I'm from

we you know we we that's crazy a we we love fellowship and we this what makes fellowship sweet ISM is food makes fellowship just so much just so much man I tell you I tell you man I just I love the Lord I don't need the guys at work think I'm in st. was they outside him I don't do alcohol I don't do the world I'm a believer they think life is boring I have think you mean you just don't know you just don't know man I tell you man being a believers just he's just it's awesome it's awesome you know and I and I and I don't say that because I'm standing by the pool but I I said I've served God most of all my life you know God filled me with the Holy Ghost when I was 18 years old 1983 31st of December 1983 amen and I I can tell you I can tell you I know the place I know the time I I mean I don't know how many years I can't count that father it was quite a few years I remember where I was standing I remember what I was wearing I remember what the minister said and this going back to 83 men and I've had many experiences since but it's that one that anchors you I was baptized when I was 12 years old you know I remember we mom and dad went to a prayer meeting and my sister my brother and I we were at home and we listened to brother branham's life story and when they came back that night has told dad we said we want to be baptized and you know they used to take us to anybody from Cape Town nobody home Cape Town I my sisters you know princess play suspense mystique aflame what is called anyway but it used to be this first Lake where people used to go picnic so on a Sunday you know everybody's picnic on the banks and others like and you know years us in brother Beckett's church we're going to be baptized and then a group of us and we walk it down in this crowd and I love that type of baptism you know there's baptism where they have other baptism pool in the church and you know the world doesn't see you being baptized and nobody sees I like the public a public event I love it but I want the world to know I want the world to know I'm a believer the world tells you there they they support All Blacks and they support this I want the world to know I'm a believer I want to let you know I am NOT a message member I'm a believer and yes God sent a prophet but I'm a believer I believe of what brother thus I'm a believer of the word and whatever I believe it's in here if it's not yeah I don't accept it I don't accept that it's gotta be yeah and then this needs to line up with that then I've got that saith the Lord and then I'm happy so I have that saith the Lord this morning they line up Amen so I'm a believer this morning amen and so since then I've been serving God and it's been rough that's been rough it's been rough brothers sisters it's been rough but it's been worth it all it's been worth it all hey man I remember brother Branham said when he was going through by the trials and the questioning they asked him so what kept you program said it was that thing that new birth that are dropped into his soul he said that kept him you said brother father what kept you it was that new birth dropped in my soul that's what kept me amen and that's why wherever we go brother acts 19 do you have Holy Ghost arm in the message I don't care do you have the Holy Ghost oh I know brother branham I don't care do you have the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost says that you and God are connected that's what connects you the picture brother Graham doesn't connect you to God the Holy Ghost connects you to God because the Holy Ghost God drops a part of himself in your soul now you ain't God or connected that's what happened brother that's what happened 83 God threw up something in my soul God and I got connected hey man we've been connected for 30 odd years yes I know I come from God I know that but I was born in sin shaped in iniquity yes I had a seed of representation plucked some along the line we got disconnected but in 31st of December Lord and I we got connected brother hallelujah amen and it's been awesome it's been awesome yes I fell yes I made mistakes but something keeps holding me and I tell you this morning young people if you get connected hey man what David's that was yong-nam old tell Jenny Jenny says we're getting old I said I don't join that conversation Fewster he says yeah but Ferdie we can't do what we used I said I don't care what you say so she's got a friend called Louisa we derived from church and then she and louise has this conversation about getting old I said I'm a part of it I'm a part of it I refused to be I'm a caleb you see I'm stronger than ever stronger than ever and that's why I'm standing this morning and I'm not standing on my dad's experience I'm not standing on my mom's experience I had my own experience and I will never forget brother I couldn't wash god I used to sitting Church man we used to have those big it's from my age a church we were fellowshiping in memories to listen to tape service and the brother Becket sorry of posture Beckett used to come with a reel-to-reel massive reels I remember rather Christ the mystery future home oh my those four hours sermons and he comes in with a Sunday morning brother and my dad used to be the deacon and he puts us in front in church cleaning I'm fronting Church with five siblings and my sisters with my mom at the back him and him now we listening to Christ the mystery 12 years old that's torture that is torture a 12 year old without the Holy Ghost Christ the mystery it will kill anybody telling you and you certain you watch that real brother you want I mean we put a DVD on right you ever watch that big reel-to-reel torture so I say believers you want to punish your child shut them down put on future home that's torture for child will have the Holy Ghost that's Porcher but I tell you brother and I used to sit and listen and all my and I'm honest God forgive me I hated it as mom and dad forced me but I tell you man and every who men and you know what we used to happen sorry I'm saying that the no I don't know where I'm going a man as such I tell you and if we fall asleep in church we got a tap on the shoulder my dad dad was deacon in the church go to the back and we get not spoken to we get down to serious crowd was old 11 10 whatever we get deep doubt with because we were made to listen to a reel-to-reel tape then the brother comes and he puts the next one on and then that Sunday morning four hours later Sunday evening brother bake it comes to preach a sermon speckies spoke who was under his arm and he comes running that's another three to four hours that's your Sunday hey remember I tell you man but 83 Ringo had told me and I tell you what and I couldn't worship God it was the hardest thing to raise my hand it was the hardest thing man singing hymns you know whether from the hymn books mr. to the hymn book ha brother since then I don't like him ok forgive me I'm happy with that other screaming man we got a young guy in our church at starting to song Lee they came to me say brother funny where can I get him books I said what you want him books Jude brother man you want him books ain't gonna happen the minute you give somebody a hymnbook they have an excuse not to clap hands they got a hymnbook brother on my hands-free I want my feet free but I wanted nothing to bind me when it comes to worshipping listen listen church in heaven there's worship in heaven there's glory in heaven I don't I didn't read anywhere where in heaven there's a section for quiet people I don't know anything unless you tell me show me where in the Bible show me the quote where there's a place in heaven for quiet people but I know heaven is noisy I know heaviness loud I know heaviness glory and praise and hallelujah and worship anthem that's heaven brother that's heaven so if you don't know what I know you don't know what God did for me but if you ever meet God the way I did change you my brother he'll change you he'll change you oh my I know I can hear some of you did hey man so when you get somebody like brother and you just loose him and let him go you just loose him and let

color it watch it watch it works [Applause] [Music] in the church lays the power hey men in this church lays the power this morning brother Branham says to overcome all temptation I don't ever want to hear the young people say poor Hill I can overcome like you don't want to overcome drill it's so hard we gotta stop this talk you know that's hard talk it's so hard it's so hard living for God it's so hard listen why are you living for God let God love for himself that's the problem I'm living for God I'm living for God this is your problem you're living for God let God inside of you look for himself and I will preach it through and that's why young people find it hard because they trying to oh brother you know I'm struggling to pray I'm struggling to dress right I'm struggling there is your problem you are struggling you know what I did I let God campaign and I let God love a Christian life through me no big deal no big deal you know you know you know what the young guys your brother gotta turn my head so why do you want to turn you hit her brother the naked women oh brother let God tell you hit and that's what I tell the young people I tell everybody you know the sick year yeah here's the message I'll give you the message in a nutshell you know we always say you know because when people look at the when we present the message to people we present a whole bunch of do's and don'ts all right don't do this don't do that don't do that don't do that just us don't sisters don't and with wonder why people find it odd and so we tell our young people how no social media no Facebook no this no YouTube notice no that and then our kids go behind our back and they do it I told my wife I said social media there is no problem with social media how can you blame Facebook for the problems in the world when Facebook is simply a bunch of computers and a website now you show me how Facebook a bunch of computers and a website causes problems no it's the users of the tool that causes problems so we don't have to educate Facebook educate the user so what do we do what do I do I'm not gonna stop well I can't stop the girls are mean too late for that that bird is flown in the 20s how do I stop that you know and I get told we get told that I'm an adult so praise the Lord I'm Adam you know I mean so what do we do so what I disc I decided we decided when we were younger the kids were younger we decided let's get God in the house then God in their heart we'll teach them how to deal with Facebook so when my kids were younger we did not have a monitoring system on the Internet it was open I did not trust them I trusted the God that I served would keep them and so when we get God inside of them it's God inside of them that controls the ice I can sit on my rocking chair put my head back have a cup of coffee blanket over my lap and Jamie and I we can rock away they got God on the inside so I don't have to monitor them I don't have to run off of them I don't have to check their browser history where were they on sites I don't have to think of God on the inside and God on the inside is the antivirus protection it's God that does it not me God is easy I put my head on Apple I go sleep at night they go visit their friends wherever they are having Apollo well as a dad you wanna monitor what time they come and when they are where they are but I don't have to worry God an insight and so now when we come to the young people we don't have to tell them for now now young go let's check your your length of your dress we don't have to walk with a tape measure it checked the height of your shoe and brother let's see how you dress it's tiresome it's tiresome you know it's like it's tiresome so what we do we make sure they have the Holy Ghost that's what we do that's all we do do you have only those my brother even I get it and we will create an environment for them to get it we will make sure the environment is problems so now I'm not I'm not a pastor right but as far as I'm concerned that's easy that makes it easy dealing with the church then everyone in the church gets the Holy Ghost [Applause] our precious sister doesn't have to go check up where these big kids offers like what the Holy Ghost no problem if I don't see them for the day who cares they've got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will look after them so I say now this is just Ferdie right there's my opinion so I don't preach against social media I don't preach against Internet and against mobile phones and you're either blood or mobile phones or iniquity iniquity let's poor thing is dead men and the only reason I've got this thing with me is the monitor the time all right so that's the only reason there's no clock it's only reason it's yeah this thing is dead the poor thing gets blamed for everything let's be serious this thing gets blamed for him so we as parents I won't give my child a mobile phone and I won't give my child this and my child doesn't have internet access and my child doesn't do this and my child doesn't do that and we're not preparing our children for the big world and then we wonder why our kids can't cope in the big world the kid is 30 years old still locked in their bedroom and now as a parent we start worrying oh honey much your child the way your child is as a result of how you read them now I wish I could let on saying so I won't say that but that's what I'm saying so Mira's children are as a result of hey how we taught him and so we made sure they get the Holy Ghost we make sure everybody in the church gets the Holy Ghost we make sure Thank You Barbara and you is it and so now this message that I'm in I want Christ and so all of a sudden my perspective on the message has changed I'm not telling people now do you know brother Branham do you know brother Branham no I'm telling him do you know Christ do you know Christ have you met Christ because I want to tell you this there are too many people in the message that don't know Christ and that's your problem there are too many people who don't know Christ but if we can get the people to Christ that creeps official not to knowledge not knowledge of the word or this mystery that mystery brother I'd rather not know any mystery but know Christ what if Paul say that I might know him and that's my call my man is to get to know Christ not just say Brian I know about but to know him so my whole perspective on how I deal with young people has changed because in the earlier years it used to be the law the law the law and you hard and you know mercian and you may not just kneel you look at them they look strange and you rebuke them and all you do is you got the Bibles of banging you so we do always to do if rather than in II was here he would have said ima because he realizes that's all we did nailed him so I said no I we had a chat I had a chat with the past lesson and he was saying maybe we we change our approach so if you come to our church our approach has changed so if a woman or a sister walks into the church in a trouser and we have in communion and she wants to come and have communion come and have communion and if a guy comes in and he's got an earring in his year and he comes from in the certain church and he says brother I want to take communion let's have communion because we not judgmental because what we're charge of love but I want to let you know we don't compromise on this because this is love we don't compromise on this we stand on this but we love them anyhow what about that woman that that Jesus that got caught in adultery come on you legolas tell me about that woman that got caught in adultery you know your brother's in I'm sure but I've been is none of them here but you get browsing the chest it's just waiting man for off the chest because they want to get you in the word I challenge the man there she was caught drag to Jesus she was caught and this is your loss says your Lord says and there was the law giver the one who had written the law he was the law and the law said he must hey you know what they say someone heard somebody said well normally the law says the man and the human must be stoned and the man wasn't there that's what the humans are come on come on man stop complicating stuff the law said stone and they stood the law and the Lord looked at her and the law said you were out sin cast the first stone and the lawyer looked around where's your accusers where's your peeresses how they walked away and Jesus neither do I accuse day [Music] that was law tinged with love that was law encapsulated in love that was law wrapped with love and that's how we present Christ we don't present Christ as a judge and he'll come to that part but right now we present Christ with love and mercy and forgiveness that's how we present Christ my God brother that's how we present because why all of a sudden our lives are salty we now attract people wherever you go they see Christ in you that's the church that's the glorious church that I'm spoke speaking about this morning that brother Brian says she's a powerful church God just reminded me I never finished my quote and haven't even touched my notes this umbrella venom so this morning in this church lays the power to heal all sickness in this church we're talking about our FPF in Auckland right now don't bother with him right now when I'm there I'll talk to them about this but as of this church this church in Stokes Valley inside of you is the power to heal all sickness you mean brother I don't have to call the pastor past that my child is sick right now you can do it you can do it mom you can do it man so in the church this morning in me lays the power to heal all sickness in the Church of the Living God lays the power to overcome all temptations in Lesson in the possession of the Church of the loving God lays the power to change them [Applause] and throw it away you me brother I have the right to say your sins are forgiven your sins are forgiven your sins are forgiven and I came this morning in the name of Jesus take your sudden chain it up and throw it away well then since I can but the venom says I can in the church this morning and throw it away and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost this church this church that's church that's brother this is the only inside of you there's a power you know what you know what the devil doesn't want you to recognize that but I'm here this morning to tell the devil is a liar I'm here this morning to tell the devil he's too light inside of you this morning brother and sister this thing listing on off Sunday I'm talking to myself in the church this morning in this glorious church there's a power to conquer every sin and the devil is trying to rob you the devil's trying to steal it from you the devil's trying to stop you know a brother Brahim said program since the devil he can't get in you but he can't torment you so he can't come in because God got in first but what he does he torments you and so he tries to tell you you will never make it such in a little shoulder and he says you never gonna make it such they're bragging he says you never gonna make it look at you loser the biggest losers are calling you a loser [Applause] then we tell the loser you true loser that's true devil that's true devil the minute you don't pray you saying you know devil you're right the minute you can't worship God you saying you know devil you're right that minute you can't smile for Jesus brother I never told the devil in your attitude your behavior your conduct the way you sitting here this morning Oh hallelujah that's right that's telling the devil devil you know you're right I've just read you a quote that says this power you and some of you look at me saying you listening to the devil you are listening to the devil I'm telling you according to the world this power see brother my child is back slidden so sorted out housing you rather my son Scott in drugs so put the name of Jesus over that's what you do you know you don't brother listen brother oh brother I don't qualify qualify since when does a believer qualify when what Bible are you reading brother I don't qualify but you reading around Bible somewhere my qualification is based on his qualification I never qualified I have no right but I placed it on ease it's based on ease it is grace it is love it is mercy it is forgiveness that's why I can stand with the word of God I want you to realize who you are you leaving this morning walk away said I know who I am song they sang loss that I'm a chosen generation I'm a royal priest II hey many my brother Joseph take a look at me now I heard you quote the words take a look at me now I don't know that I saw the words but anyway it's a wonder that you see I know who I am and when you leave here this morning church I know who I am you say brother is system brother and sister even if you're struggling with immigration even you

that's wood man brothers you are so powerful man I haven't touched any of that provenza bunch of powerful believers here this morning but I want you to know who you are now I know you've said amen and I know you've said hallelujah but I want you to really realize who you are and it's time sure that you talk back to that devil [Applause] brother Branham said now you talk back to the devil then you end the conversation with the devil and then you walk away and you don't talk to him again so some of you some of you need to have that final conversation with the devil some of you have been talking to him too long some of you have been given him a hearing too often I say it's time let's have the final conversation and then it's done that's right have that final conversation and you tell him devil there's nothing in my life that belongs to you yeah brother you took devil devil devil devil as a real devil is real and if you are not victorious this morning there's a devil stole your joy because God's not gonna steal your joy God's not gonna steal your joy oh brother oh brother God stole my joy what are you smoking man core doesn't want steal oh joy God gives joy unspeakable now I'm not talking about fleshly Pentecostal performance I'm talking about when your life is so lined up with the word and God dwells in your heart he gives you a joy a joy brother that when you have nothing

button that it can bring itself from a state of dormancy into a condition that you can interact with it right there's something there in the computer that does it now how many times believers did you not fall and you were flat on your face and the devil said that's it you done and the world said you done and your family said you were done and the neighbor said you were done and you were laying

found the sisters you ask brother Penner God found him ask for the nd how God found him mother man and brother Kupe and how God found them same way he's gonna find you he's gonna find you he's gonna find you we just had an experience you know Church one of our sisters was a devil attacked her I tell you brothers we've been praying and praying something till four o'clock in the morning for this praying this what had happened was the sisters brother had back slit two years two years for two years two years he was back slidden God used that opportunity to bring him back Tuesday the pastor said and now as I said meant whatever his name is he's now brother so-and-so called Norton back a lot of times after kids think they can run her God has a way God has a way and I want to let you know this morning any of you young people that were at the camp in December you are not at a higher level than what you left the camp you backslidden then backslidden but God doesn't go back God doesn't go back God goes forward so you got to tell me brother footy I left the camp there but now I'm here but if you've gone from year to year it Pharaoh's a selling you then we got a deal with Pharaoh then we got a deal with Pharaoh was Pharaoh needs to be told one more time let my people go God was toying with Pharaoh toying with Pharaoh toying with Pharaoh well God said right Pharaoh that's enough I need the blood and he said I put in a blood and Goshen and when I see the blood the Death Angel will pass and they were free that night but Pharaoh God hell of God a God hardened Pharaoh's heart so that he could come after them you know why because God wanted to finish him completely so God allowed the devil to come after you so God can finish him completely today maybe that day and God's gonna finish the devil completely but I'm sick of the devil a-and after today that meeting that general meeting that you have every Monday after church with the devil closer down closer down because on the Gables calendar in his outlook Monday morning there's a reoccurring meeting with you every Monday you have a real curling meeting and the devil calls a meeting and he has the minutes of the previous meeting and he'll tell you remember what you did last week he has admitted he has the action points and you have a reoccurring meeting in your calendar with the devil and some of you have seven days a week the devil says first thing on a Monday morning or Tuesday morning let's let's reevaluate the events of the past day and then you and the devil sit and the devil says you didn't do this look what you did there look what you do there and he has it on his agenda as action points and then there well then the devil tells you we now call this meeting to an end and we'll reconvene tomorrow morning and a lot of us walk at say yes devil we will reconvene tomorrow morning tomorrow morning you they first in the meeting sitting at the table and then the devil walks in with these pilot notes and the devil says where were we yes that is meeting and then you tell the devil thus did that you tell the devil yes us through I did this I didn't do this didn't do that I was disobedient yeah you and the devil doesn't have to tell you and you telling the devil you're rattling hood off to the devil the devil sticks off on his wrist and then the devil says we'll call this me it sounds like the oh brother time but that's what you do that's what I do sometimes next morning you're coming you'll say let's start this meeting again and I'm saying let's tell the devil don't wait for him to end the meeting interrupt him Midway tell him Satan do you know that hell was created for you and your demons and you've been trying to drag me down with you but the Bible says it was created for you Satan and your demons not for me and you tell the devil right Satan we're gonna now delete that reoccurring event that's in our calendar and some of you look at me as a bride talking nonsense and the fact that you have that attitude says you have a reoccurring event and the fact is the devil is so in control of your meetings he doesn't even wait for after church how rude how rude of the devil that when you in church he has his meeting with you how rude and you sit then he has the meeting and then he has the audacity to tell you tell their little colored boy shut up and you sit there with your attitude or whatever and you're having your meeting with a devil and you're not even listening to what God is saying over the pulpit but I want to say this morning let's call that meeting to an end and let's tell the devil we're not only calling this meeting to an end we are cancelling the reoccurring event in our calendar and you can't listen listen listen I hate him might as well let you know I hate the devil and he does the devil does everything he can to kill me and I am doing everything I can to kill him but yes the doctrines yes the difference his end is written in the book of Revelation that's his end my end you look in Revelation 5 you find about me and you look in Revelation 10 and you find about me and you're looking first Thessalonians 4:16 and you'll read about me I know he's in ICU tell him that you tell him right that's it done we're not having this anymore that's the challenge to young people that's the challenge you can continue a reoccurring meeting we draw to an end that's it this meeting ends as of now I'm a child of God I'm part of that glorious church this meeting ends right here right now I like that right here right now that meeting ends and you put a stake in the ground and you say right that's it I'm a son of God I'm leaving here I am gonna tell the devil I'm gonna enjoy the rest of my day I'm going to enjoy my lunch and I'm going to enjoy the praise and worship afterwards and I'm looking forward to Monday and devil devil you still a liar we still Alya devil we still a liar now blood when I did not preach my notes brother Ben so then he asked before once hey that's its advice Amen here that's it well then I'm saying Church I'd love to see God's people go free I want that's that's been my goal all my life since I've been serving the Lord I want God's people to go free I want God's young people to go free because I know what it what it's like to be bound but I know what it's like to be free and freedom tastes better listen believers freedom in Christ it is so much better look at me look at me I'm a wonder what's it words you're gonna give me Edwards man can you give me the words on your phone or something like that amen what's the song what's it called him are you got two words okay now man the one who is sang last night there that you were quoting you quoted the words of your phone I'm a chosen generation that one that one brother Joseph I'll quote you the words I'm gonna sing it I Know Who I am and there's a part that says take a look at me now I'm a wonder I'm a wonder look at yourself in the mirror and say I'm a wonder look at yourself in the mirror Church look at me now I'm a wonder no pressure brother Joseph no pressure but can I get it now please and so when you leave here this morning I'm gonna say my god I gotta thank you my brother there we go my my are either from the top a and let's take a look at me I'm a wonder it doesn't matter what you see now you know me I'm a colored man from South Africa I don't care what you see I know what God sees haha can't you see his glory oh can you see his glory on us a for I Know Who I am tell my my who I Know Who I am and it says I'm a chosen generation or somewhere there amen thank you brother the way I was taught the verses with a but I Know Who I am I'm done do you know who you are do you know who you are seventh church anniversary do you know who you are can you say look at me I'm a wonder I carry his glory and the Bible says Paul says we are changing from glory and to glory from glory and to glory on the outside age ages crueler amen but on the inside I'm changing and do you know the body change is from the inside out the world gets it wrong so the world tries to change them and you know what church you know watch it you know what that's what we try to do with young people we try to change our young people from the outside and we kept hammering on our young people how to behave what to wear what to do what not to do what what what we kept hammering on that and then we were wondering why it never worked and then we discovered it happens from the inside out where did I blow hams body change come from inside out and so yes the outer man is finishing oh brother Ottoman is perishing look at this after man I didn't look like this when we got married 27 years ago i Jane I didn't look like this eh believe it or not I was handsome unbelievers yeah I can't be had hey brothers that wasn't a fro either I was godly brother koukin I kept the short I had a I had when I got married I never had what you see now never had I wait 59 kgs when I got married and up till today my wife wants to know what I weigh and I refused to tell her so the outer man is perishing the outer man when I like my brother branham said when brother branham's wife said belly you losing your hair brother branham told us it austere if you tell me where my hair was before I got it I'll tell you ladies now and I can say the same but I have a condition for God I shouldn't do that but I said God if you want to bring my hair back I'm happy with every but if you bring my hair back it's got a comeback blonde and straight is anything too hard for the Lord sister nothing but the outer man is perishing but the inner man is being renewed on a daily I can imagine Abram and Sarah one morning Abraham woke up and he looked across expecting to see the wrinkles and he
