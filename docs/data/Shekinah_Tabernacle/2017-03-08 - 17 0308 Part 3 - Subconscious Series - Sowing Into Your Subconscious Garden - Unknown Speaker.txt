in the presence of the [Music] king [Applause] praise the Lord In The Presence of Jehovah sometimes you think you've got questions or things you want to ask the Lord about or things like that and it's interesting that when you get into the presence of God you sometimes you can't find the questions aren't there anymore because it's um when we meet him a lot of the even the questions we have just we wonder why we're even thinking about them in the first place it's we get to a different level of of fellowship and and things that maybe were important is suddenly not important anymore I don't know I sometimes you get to that place you know in that secret place and you I think there was there were things I wanted to ask but they just don't come anymore um but it's a wonderful thing to be in The Presence of Jehovah and to um have the opportunity to fellowship with almighty God it is really the it's it's the climax of our existence really on this in this Mortal realm um and it's it's the whole purpose of why Jesus came to take away our sins and to um break that that wall that was between us so we could come and have fellowship with Jesus Christ in that secret place I I still can't think of something better that we could get you know like like brother B talked about you know if God could give a man something better than a wife he would and this is now a spiritual union if he could if we could get something better than a than a spiritual husband a spiritual connection on that level he would give us something but that's it that's all the other stuff that comes with it is is secondary to it amen let's um let's just sing U let's just sing here as love as um Brother Andy comes this evening if here is love vast as the ocean Ling kindness as the flood when the Prince of Life our Ransom shed for us his Precious Blood who his love will not remember who can cease to sing his praise he can never be forgotten throughout him Eternal day on the Mount of crucifixion fountains open deep and wide through the flood gates of God's mercy flow of us and gracious time Grace and love like Mighty Rivers poured in s and from above and Heaven's peace and perfect Justice King is the guilty World in

Ingenuity and Lord Jesus to deliver the mail that you have given me your unprofitable messenger servant to speak tonight Lord I just lay my life at your feet I put my lips in your hands Lord and ask that you would use my tongue to minister the Gospel of Jesus Christ and that Lord lives would change and hearts would be healed and your light Lord Jesus would shine and and let no stone be unturned throughout these meetings Lord and throughout this the word of God going forth tonight in Jesus Christ's name have your way amen hallelujah thank you musicians amen it's a privilege and honor to be here if we want to just turn in our Bibles unless you just want to read from here um familiar I'm just using this verse again because it really encompasses the vision and the desire and the thought amen everyone ready oh sorry I should have said Ephesians 4: 21-23 says if so be that you have heard him who's heard him amen and have been taught by him Hallelujah I don't need to ask but we know we've been taught by Jesus amen hallelujah that you put off concerning the former conversation which is the way of life the manner of Life the the life that you lived the former life that you lived the old man and which is corrupt according to deceitful lusts and be renewed renovated made new made over in the spirit of your mind so now the Bible's talking about the the breath the life of your mind because there's a physical mind and then there's the spirit that drives that mind the spirit that's the life of that mind the breath of that mind the rer of that mind so be renewed in that amen that's a life-changing experience may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seats amen um Psalm 101:3 it says and this is about choices that we make you are responsible you are solely responsible for the choices you make because you are a free moral agent you choose amen you choose what you're exposed to sometimes you can't sometimes you're in a supermarket or whatever but as a general and in for the most part of your life you choose what you expose yourself to what light goes in your eyes what light goes in your ears and that sounds funny that light going in your ears but remember information and and a and a message is light words are not just an audible but the message and the concept that that the words carry is light now we want to I want to ask you the the light that you expose your five senses too how dark is that light how dark is it and have you and or is it very is it is it a bright light that's shining from God cuz there's light shining in all around the world there's light coming in through through screens so so so whoever the people that control the media and control the world these things here it's like a little window and light comes through it you choose what light comes through there you choose you choose what light you expose yourself to and so now that's why I highlighted the word the letter I and I put that there because I wanted to put emphasis right there because it's David now and some knew he also had a choice and his choice was and I believe and I trust this is your choice I will set no Wicked thing before mine eyes amen and and you know I David knew that this was a very important thing because David was a man after God's Own Heart I believe I'm standing before people who are after God's Own Heart a people that are hungry for God Desiring God a people that will hear the word and be taught of it and actually continue to grow in that word and have a desire not to set wicked things before their eyes amen and he says I hate the work of them that turn aside it shall not cleave to me doesn't say I hate them but the work of them the energy that they produce the the the thrust of their existence he is not like that because you see now and I'll go into this I will set no Wicked thing before mine eyes if you do if there's things that are going in your eyes that aren't right and things that are going to hurt you they will actually make you turn aside they will they will stare you in the wrong direction they will put things into your mind that you won't even realize that are going in your mind they'll put things in there that will be it might not you might not feel or or experience anything for years to come months weeks days hours whenever when you plant a seed in the fertile ground of your mind it's going to bring a harvest that seed's going to grow something now discern what that seed is discern the seeds that you're exposing yourself to and yes we know that we're in a great battle and the devil can fire all sorts of seeds into our mind as well and that is the spiritual warfare that takes place with negative thoughts that come in because we don't generate anything you cannot imagine anything that you haven't seen before so your imagination is based upon stimuli and things that you've seen in your life and your memory and things that people have told you you try and imagine something that you've never seen before you cannot just the same way you cannot generate or or create a thought a thought is given to you by either good or evil by either God or Satan when you boil it down it might be third fourth fifth sixth level back but if you tie it back if you trace it all the way back to the origin of whatever thought you're thinking you can find it in either good or evil the subconscious mind takes pretty much anything literally and this is why I want to get in I want to get go I want to just cover this subject um of what you expose yourself to be very careful be very Discerning because and maybe it hasn't been known very well but the subconscious mind picks up the most subtle and minute things from the very human nature and the body language and relationships and how humans interact and you up here if you might be watching a movie you might be watching a a TV show you might be reading a book now up here yes definitely you know oh this is fictitious this is not real this is not true and you reason but down in the heart the subconscious does not differentiate between good uh between true and false it takes things literally that's why you are scared from a fictitious horror movie not that we watch horror movies okay I'm just saying this is an example or surprised at a photoshopped picture even though you know they are not real that's why you need your reasoning right but something down here believes what it's seeing and it's producing all sorts of emotions and you can be sitting in a theater now I don't go to movies and I I don't condone them or endorse them at all right but you could be sitting in a theater right and you're watching something and up here you know it's not true but down here it's believing everything it sees and it's reacting to as if it's real and it's it's reliving emotions and it's going through all sorts of adrenaline and things that's going through and it's absorbing that light now how dark is that light what's the message of that director of that story writer what is his motive who is his inspiration who is his inspiration because really there's only like I said before if you boil every inspiration down that there is they are rooted in either good or evil and so can you say that the inspiration behind some story that you're watching before you and that light that's going in and your subconscious reacting to it what who who in did God Inspire that did that come from the word of God is that going to bring Faith is that going to direct you down the middle of the road give you a balance give you a a happy life or is that going to take you and steer your subconscious arai a little bit and it might not happen in one year it might happen way down the Trap you know it says here I said but more importantly this is why we need the Holy Ghost to be supreme leader in our lives to guide our choices and bring divine order to what our 10 senses are telling us 10 senses are see touch feel smell and hear physical and then your spiritual senses conscience affections reasoning imaginations and memory now those 10 senses without the holy ghost in your life whatever those 10 senses man the people are going all over the show and things is out of order and people are just reacting to all sorts of things and their spirit is and ruling the roof you could say And the emotions control that person's life because there's no order but when the Holy Ghost comes into a person's heart he brings divine order to that house this is a house you live in a house this is the home it want and for it to be a happy home the your spirit needs to be healthy and your soul needs to have God in it amen because you see God is when God comes in he brings divine order now he will guide your choices and you know when and I can't see anybody that's filled with the Holy Ghost that can sit and watch something and not go and not have a conviction if it's not of God and and not go you know what I don't think this is completely right but I'm going to enjoy it anyway you know and and that's probably a lot of people do that and and and unfortunately what happens is eventually the conscience gets said and it becomes okay that's a deceitful lust that's actually a deceitful lust a lust is deceitful and what that deceit is is people start compromising and they start doing a certain thing that at first they think it's it's not they're not too sure whether it's right and then after a while they're just living in that lifestyle and their subconscious and their spiritual well-being becomes complex it becomes unbalanced their body becomes unbalanced the chemical production inside their body becomes out of balance and all sorts of things can happen and that person has been LED astray but the grace of God has come to speak and when his word comes over the pulpit and people have lived in that the grace of God can come to that Pew and come to that heart and change that person back and and renew their conscience renew it amen be renewed in the spirit of your mind hallelujah it's so important to be renewed in the Spirit of your mind amen hallelujah so tonight session two of the subconscious series sewing into the subconscious Garden amen it's a garden your mind is a garden your spirit you know your mind is a fertile garden and it's a garden that will receive all sorts of seeds and you choose what seeds you are going to stay in there you can't choose what seeds fly over and what seeds come in because you know you you unless you choose to do stuff that's not right and you choose to go and watch things that aren't good well then you're making a choice there and you know good luck well I shouldn't say luck but you know really if you've chosen to go down that road and chosen to watch those things and do that sort of live that sort of Lifestyle then you'll reap a harvest but if you're living your life and you're walking with the Lord and and you know we have we can't help but be exposed to certain things in our workplaces and going out into the malls and wherever we go you know there is we've got a Satan's Eden upon the Earth and so therefore even though you uh you in your heart you're R and everything and you're walking you are going to be exposed to seeds coming into your mind but you choose what seeds can take root you choose because they'll come in there now you've got to make a discernment there this is actually not a positive thought this is not a positive thought I'm going to reject that thought I'm not going to let that thought Roost yeah I'm not going to let that thought take root because if an evil thought takes root the spirit of that thought the life the the drive behind that will actually start to take root in your life and will actually start to to to to control you because you see if it's not a thought of God it's a thought of the enemy and the enemy is not a gentleman and he will take over like a cancer a cancer in the body now physically speaking a cancer form from a tumor right maybe you can say it's a a benign tumor right and that really is a biological mess inside the body and that mass inside the body is not really your your your part of your body it's a foreign alien part but yet it's parasitic it's living off your the life in your body and yet it's got it hasn't got your life in it really it's parasiting off your life therefore it's this it's this body of fles flesh that has no life in it and yet cuz it's parasitic but now the devil can get a hold of that and put his life in it and when the Devil comes in when he sees someone's got a tumor and he comes and puts his life in that tumor he's the one that drives that tumor to kill the person because he's come into a a he's come into an entity that hasn't got your mind in it hasn't got your life in it so because he if he comes into that then that's what actually drives it that's why you see many stories of cancer and things like that where it you can see it's got this Sinister way to try and take someone's life and it grows from here and it goes into the bloodstream and it it it finds the most easiest simplest way to destroy that home to destroy that body to destroy that house to destroy that person and their family it's an evil spirit in that now that's the same thing with thoughts if the devil can just keep firing a thought at you for years and years maybe just and every now and again he just fires it again he goes around and Cycles fires it again and one day you might catch you while you're down and weak and F and and you start to agree with that that's that's a big problem right then and there if you start to reason with a negative thought from the enemy it can come in like a cancer it can take root and it will take over and it will form a stronghold inside your life and start to rudely approach rudely take over and blind you and do all sorts of things therefore if you know if you really want to walk close to the Lord if you really want to be renewed in the spirit of your mind if you really want to come to a place of perfect Faith discern and make good choices about what you expose yourself to what you expose your family too what go what light goes in these eyes and goes in these ears be Discerning quote um there is a subconscious and a a conscious and a subconscious it's just like if we start overseas and buy ship and there's a man sitting up here he's the one who gives the orders the man goes down in the ship to run the ship here well he do see where he's going but he just takes orders from up above remember the conscious mind it's like the captain in a ship and downstairs in the subconscious is The Crew That's the crew the subconscious runs the ship does all of the engine room and but but doesn't actually have sight of where the vision's going where the ship's going but upstairs the upstairs has the vision upstairs is in the bridge it's got The Radars and it's got all of the the the equipment to lead to to to guide the ship now our conscious mind's equipment is the Holy Ghost that's the that's our GPS that's our God is the Holy Ghost he will lead you and guide you into all truth amen the spirit of truth will come he will teach you he's your radar so when you as the captain in the conscious mind need the Holy Ghost to lead you to be your GPS but down here in the subconscious is dependent upon you is dependent on you to make good choices on what you expose yourself to because those seeds are going to go in there and cause a harvest those seeds are going to go in there and they're going to be a problem and so see now and this is I'll say it plain that the Lord is in the in the in the process of completely cleansing and purifying us from all our secret faults this is the season he's come to take over and do it this is the season it's not like how the season now this is a different season we've got to recognize the season that we're in now this it's a definite season of complete Purity now not about being legalistic and trying all this stuff God's doing it but he's also but you see there is a there is things that he doesn't that he he will speak to us and tell us that are wrong and we have to we've got to actually listen and listen to what the spirit is saying listen to the discernment of the spirit listen to what the spirit is saying to the churches because he's saying things and he'll declare things that will help you make good decisions and will help you in your life and will expose The Works of Satan that you didn't even know was Satan there's a lot of things in this world that we do that we don't realize are wrong you know but God will come and shine his light upon it and he I believe he is and tonight we're going to see some some of these things he doesn't see where he's going but he just takes orders from up above well now he says steer to the left or to the right or give this engine more of and that or whatever it is he just works by orders but way down in the midst of us here in our heart is the subconscious remember this was spoken in the 60s and it takes orders from up here we should send these things to Harvard because these guys are only just discovering this in the world of psychology it's these things a lot of these things some of the stuff is quite U has been around for a while but there's a lot of things in these messages that are only new information to the world of science now up here this conscious comes up to the platform brother Brandon praise the Lord I have faith up here and here because you reason and you know the Bible's true but right down here there in that other little conscience said now you know you haven't see well now if you can if you can get this one and that one in harmony with that one that you see it you want to say yes but it is just down there that little shadow that makes you if you don't deal with this little fellow down there very much well you'll find out he just kindly does the ruling you see so if this fellow after all he's the one who drives the ship you see it so and you see where I'm coming to is it's an important to get both on board you need to get that subconscious on board cuz you know and many of times in myself you come for prayer and you believe with all your heart but something down here just it's like it's antagonistic it's because of years and years of negativity or a negative upbringing or being let down by your parents and they've promised you things over and over again and let you down and humans will let you down but God won't but now it's now you've got to be retrained and you have to retrain down here which learns by repetition it doesn't just learn it in one hit unless there's a a a like a really emotional experience to cause the subconscious to to to to absorb it it will take repetition it will take singing these songs and declaring and sharing your testimony over and over and over again until down here it actually starts to believe it and that is for your safety that it doesn't just pick up everything and anything that it sees God's I believe God made that for us safety otherwise every little concept that comes our way we would just follow it but it's what we expose ourselves to on a regular basis and what we speak and what we think on a regular basis is what forms our values and beliefs downstairs now if you've got the Holy Ghost then the word of God has been is living in you and his ideas that's what you need to declare that's what you need to sing that's what you need to testify that's what you need to to live out so that down there it starts to believe it and you can start walking in perfect Faith perfect Faith your subconscious is the only thing that's holding you back from perfect Faith it's the thing downstairs that's keeping you in trouble it's stopping you and holding you back because it's been taught by you the wrong ways and many things that have been sewn down in there the tears that the devil the enemy sewed into your life but as I said just before this is the season that every single one is going to be exposed and every stone unturned amen amen place your faith in that fact that God he which is perfect is come hallelujah amen and that which is inart shall be done away and he which is perfect will shine his light upon all these things and bring all these things and and and ultimately he is the abolisher of death he's the one that's going to just abolish death out of your life and you won't even die you'll take a Rapture he's the one he is here the very personal Ministry of Jesus Christ in this end time to undo all your secret faults and everything that's hindering so don't be overburdened by the things I'm saying trying to do all these things to make it all happen he's doing it hallelujah hallelujah you don't deal with this little fellow down here very much you'll find out he just kindly does the in you see after all he's the one who drives the ship he's the one that does the steering this one might say a lot but this is the guy that does the work down here see and so we just got to get those fellows to agreeing and saying God is right this says up here God is right this says the subconscious God is right and the words and the Soul where the word is says God is right then we move forward you see we got orders every everything there's nothing in your way there's nothing to make you doubt it when the CU the word of God is in your soul your soul is sealed it believes it will never doubt and it cannot doubt brother brandom said the soul of the Bride cannot doubt the word I'm paraphrasing so the soul is sealed it's fine and and and really when you get born again it places you in dominion and gives you authority over all of your the rest of you the rest of your faculties and and absolute authority over all demon power amen all demon power regardless of how you feel regardless of what you feel regardless of how weak you feel you've got Authority but you see now these three that have to be in alignment then when there's nothing to make you doubt it then whatever you say will happen whatever you say if my words abide in you and you abide in my words whatever you are whatever you say will be you see but but there's a season for it to happen and God's timing is impeccable God's timing is perfect he's not going to bring his bride into this perfect utopic condition until she's got the maturity to handle it till she's been through enough fire and trials and and gone gone through the ringer and failed many times until she recognizes that she is nothing and he's everything so that he can actually when it finally comes that that whatever you say happens it'll be the very mind of Christ the maturity is here the character is there the character has been one it's a victory not it's not given to you you've got it's a victory that comes through your life comes through hardship all the there's nothing to make you doubt at all the symptoms you could have you might go back to the hospital in the morning that say well your arm is still stiff your Cancer's still there that wouldn't have one spec of that wouldn't phase you a bit see if that this and this agreed okay yes amen and I know I'm not the only one that has the the there two agrees and one that sort of has a bit of trouble sometimes because I know my personal upbringing was an upbringing of you know negative you know negative and again poor communication from my parents and so unfortunately that image that was lived in front of me for many years is a it's sticky it takes a long time a lot of singing the gospel songs and time in the presence of God and and God dealing in my own life for those things that are engrained down deep to change and we I know we're all in the same boat because if we're not then someone's perfect already who's perfect already I know you're perfect in the blood but you know right here right now you know we're on our journey amen well you yep okay we think of that great St Paul one time landed on a certain Island and when he throwed some wood down a great deadly Beast serpent bit him right through the hand and that Beast was so deadly till if it bit a person they usually drop dead within a minute or two now look a moment Paul looked and seen it this this and that all agreed remember we all know what this this and that is now don't we yeah this this and that so conscious subconscious and soul or the word all agrees when it's all agree so Paul here man godess blessed Paul didn't he he really blessed him he had this you know man uh where are we this this and that all agreed there was not a speck of fear he said they take up serpents and it will not harm them he looked at that deathly bite no fear if you fear then Satan steps in Satan's fear but perfect love cast out all fear I like that word cast out all fear doesn't just tell it to politely leave it cast it away Hallelujah I'm so grateful that it casts it away amen there you are this is Paul now I'm God's man there hangs the serpent but there's not one Speck of feir here here or there up there you know see it's all in Harmony Harmony and that's where God comes when God comes he brings Harmony God's come on the scene in Wellington he's brought Harmony hallelujah amen hallelujah than were so perfectly in harmony with God there there and there that the first that first church and Christian friend until we can get back to that now you we can't argue and quarrel and fuss with denominations and ever get to it denominations won't bring us to it it's a perfect love and confidence in God Amen just what brings it see and we may shout we may speak with tongues we may be great teachers of theology we may have DDS hanging on to us but it will never work until that this and this comes in harmony the Inner Man 1953 now a lot of this stuff is only really being discovered in the world of science now this we we have front page news amen and it's from a a prophetic messag amen everything you have need of in your journey and to Enlighten your understanding of the Bible is in this message amen hallelujah even the most rudimentary living everyday life stuff you don't need 20 steps to be a good dad from some psychologist you need the message of the hour amen it's all in there to to to and and God provided This Love Letter to you Amen to to to thoroughly turn every stone in your life and place you in in perfect Faith you're on your road you're it's happening you're in the process you're being ushered into your Millennial condition the beginning of the war give me your children now as parents that's coming to you now but your parents was coming to them and so we're all in it whether you're a parent now or you've got children the this commandment came comes to every parent it comes to every parent and that commandment comes from Satan but it also comes from God God has that commandment too but Satan uses this now he uses this in a big way especially now that the that the radio and television Dimension and frequency has been able to be channeled into a certain technology and placed in every home placed in every hand and placed in theaters all over the world he's got an absolute mechanism to control the culture of humanity he really does and he starts with the Little Tots that are zero years old and there's a satil here and a real thing that I'm telling you consciously you know you you it's hidden M you get things in here and you watch stuff and you get distracted but the subconscious doesn't miss one iot of information that's ever been shown it not one so every movie you've ever seen every little child program that you watched when your parents were out doing stuff your subconscious analyzed the very minute detail of every little body language every micro body language on every facial feature everything that every human that was on every channel that you ever watched and it was processing it and it was drinking it in it was forming the very image of humanity the very image of who they are their very person being formed by the things that it was watching this is the sensitivity of the subconscious to give you an understanding the conscious mind which up here as a child was yeah laughing and giggling whatever it was doing but down there that Spirit of that mind was absorbing everything they call it the theater stage of Consciousness and in a child from the age of zero when they're first born and those eyes open that conscious is drinking in an image that's lived in front of it it's drinking every detail because God designed it that way so that it would learn how to interact with itself with other people with its parents how to be a human on a level that you don't consciously even try it just you just are and you wonder why you know there's weird people around and then there's normal people and there's extreme people it's all to do with that first stage of their life that formed their personality now there's a there's there's two forces saying give me your children now and so we can choose as parents and our parents chose for us what we were exposed to train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it your choice so in the way he should go and who is the way Jesus Christ is the way the truth and the life no man shall come to the father except by me amen Jesus is the way and so this is a consolation for the believer that in in in love now it doesn't mean you just read the Bible to your children and command them to do this and and and Gru them and beat them when they don't this is actually the training is a discipleship it's an example that's lived in front of them amen and it's what you choose by your responsible choice now what you expose them to what are you exposing your children to what are you allowing to go into their eyes is it from God or is it from Satan there's only two you choose what you put in your children's eyes is it from the Tree of Life or is it from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil those are the only two and yes the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil has some good in it but it's not going to bring Faith and I'm not telling you to just cut it all out but there are certainly things that you would know out of that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil which should be cut out because remember and never forget this the subconscious of those children is absorbing the relationship and how those humans are interacting on that program and it's saying this is how a this is how a parent is to me this is how a father is and so when they later on in life try to approach God they're approaching God according to an image that Satan showed them on some TV program that you put them in front of because you're too lazy to to to look after them you know and and really and I didn't mean to say that but it just came out but it might not be always that way it might just mean you know you've got something important to do and of course we all do and I mean I I I put my children in front of stuff too so hey we're all in it together amen but I do choose very wisely Amen to try not to because now well even especially now because remember these things is just new to me as well I'm only just the Lord's just opening all this up so you know it's it's really being careful about those things train up a child disciple a Child live a good image in front of that child because they are they are using that it's and the most subtle things to form the person that they are and that's going to be the very way they approach God and perceive God and perceive their wife or their husband and their relationships with people yeah it's so important Choose Wisely all these movies and things like that you know they might not seem very bad when you watch them on a conscious but the subconscious now is picking up every little detail and so those people are not converted people 90 99% of them 99.99% of people that you watch on those TV are unconverted and so this body language going on in those movies that The subconscious is picking up on and causing all sorts of lusts and all sorts of things that are not right that's Computing into the children's mind and you watch this stuff is going to come out I know it I can I can I know so here we are this is just a diagram sorry this is quite small I didn't realize how small it was going to be but this is the the this is the a diagram of the baby now that is a full grown human but it's meant to be a baby 0 to six right and if you want to know what that all means you can watch the sermon before this diagram here I'm not going to explain that tonight because there's not enough time but the first thing that we that that affects the child now remember this too and I want to just put my disclaimer in here this I'm not perfect and I and I'm a human so I don't I probably haven't got everything in here and you know there's probably things that you might even be thinking about that I've missed but this is I've just done this to give a a basis and a foundation or an overview of of the thought so here as a baby as a child 0 to6 the first and foremost um importance is the relationship image the image of relationships and that's the parent to parent so that child is watching how you a husband and wife interact how how each one's treating each other those things the children are watching that on a subconscious level yes consciously they can reason out and they can see that humans are humans and they make mistakes and you know if you're honest with your children communicate yes daddy made a mistake or whatever sorry but the subconscious is actually what is learning all the those things and it's growing in those things and it's absorbing that image so be careful how you treat your husband or wife in front of your children be careful what you say parent a child and so the the way the parents treated you as a child and the way you treat your children as when they grow growing up you know that's such an important thing it develops the image in that child parent to their friends and how they react to their friends remember it's absorbing information it's absorbing relationships is absorbing an image now if those parents are Holy Ghost filled and they're yielded to the spirit and they're walking in the light of their day those children are going to be exposed to the image of Christ they're going to be exposed to a wholesome image that's going to help them grow up so they can tackle things as it comes and that they're going to be strong with a strong strong uh a contentment and a balance in their spirit because it hasn't been filled with all sorts of junk siblings together or not you with your friends spiritual image the religious influence in the house the family altar in the home now I don't just mean reading the family altar from brother Tim I'm talking about the spiritual participation and the the prayer life of the family and the and the the whole thing the family altar encompass is the whole spiritual image in the home the sincerity or hypocrisy children those subconscious on those children are they are picking up they can pick up trust me you know and that can that that can really affect them so who you are here be the same at home you know amen and if you're not it's time to get to praying it's time to come to the altar because if there's two people God doesn't want two he wants one he wants a person that's wholesome and he wants them stable and the same everywhere Hallelujah God Consciousness or lack of you know I David said I put God always before me how how God conscious is your house as your family do they recognize the presence of God as as God in your house and you know it and your children know that you know it and they know it as well how God conscious people are fears and opinions food choices phobias complexes World Views media exposure this is a big one this one here is probably the you know most destructive well the relationship if if this relationship I mean they're all just as important but this one here has caused so much destruction and Satan has used media to control the world now if you expose your children constantly to this media and to these games and to all these things they are going to be controlled by whoever created those things and those images are going to go to them and they're going to struggle maybe not now cuz they're innocent and young and happy and what but once the Harvest starts growing up and those little seeds that were sewing all their life is maturing the very Spirit that's behind those things will start to become an adult and start to control them and you'll have a lot of trouble and it's going to take a lot of prayer and I don't believe we're in a season where there's a lot of time for 20 years of sanctification to take place but it's go it's time that we actually recognize what is right and what is wrong and actually Choose Wisely what we're exposed to and what our children and family are exposed to amen because you know I believe we're right at the end I believe there's not there's there's only years months whatever the Lord could come tomorrow but you know so and and it's the same people can say oh we all watched movies and look we're all okay but you've had 25 years of or 30 years or 40 Years of God to deal with you to get all that junk right out again the stuff that was sewing in there and the stuff you may be still s in there going to continue washing you out and cleansing you and helping you and you wonder why you're struggling all the time what's going in what's entering here can you put Jesus on the seat next to you music TV books images movies many things but this Hollywood Disney Disney is not what you think it is Disney is pure evil pure evil and it's not on a conscious level it's on a subliminal and subconscious level Pure Evil and you can go and research it yourself outside of CHR Christianity it's it's exposed computed completely and it's not a conspiracy theory it's actual reality and it's Satan controlling that Hollywood movies I won't go into it but books and movies are quite different and yet there's still Concepts in books but it's the image it's the it's the example that's that's going in the light that's going into the eyes that and the passive the passivity of the person sitting there and when your emotions are going and this is why it's so important or so I must just nail this because the EM the movie creates such emotion and it's in that emotional state that the seeds of Satan get sewn into your mind or into the children's mind because they're enjoying it they're loving it they're having an exciting time and those emotions get stored in the subconscious those very emotions and the thought and the concept gets carried right in very efficiently and so if it's repeti especially after repetition after repetition ction because remember after the age of 0 to 6 that subconscious state it actually it draws back and it pulls back and it becomes harder to get it to the subconscious but if your lifestyle and what you always do and what you always say and what you always think your subconscious will eventually become that some interesting facts about movies what's the time I might not read this no I'm not reading it discipline Spirit of correction is it benevolent or malevolent what's the spirit of it what's the what's the motive behind your correction abuse and misuse of Authority or lack of author of of of of authority lack of Direction lack of boundaries you know these things there has to be a balance in these things communication and reasoning and reasoning with your children and actually communicating with them why these things are and and why you do these things not just I said so you do it they just Rebel humans have got human nature amen they've got you've got to actually allow them to understand amen so important and boundaries boundaries are healthy healthy for children healthy for us habits I want to out of all of these things I just want to put a magnifying glass on the on fear there's many others but fear it's fear is one of the it's the cripples faith and so if one thing gets sewn in a child's heart from Young is fear phobia is scared of this fear of this and and and scared of of trying or scared of surrendering or it's fear is a big issue in people's lives the worst thing brother brandom says in God's way that's been made for us in 52 the worst thing that the devil can put upon you is fear so that's why I chose fear to go into because if that's the worst thing well man we need to look at this if you ever if you even had a Cancer and didn't fear and belied God would heal you you wouldn't be in too bad a shape God can take care of that if you were sick whatever it is if you didn't fear so fear is one of the worst things that Satan can place upon the person so number one problem the embedding of fear into the heart of man and so I've got the same diagram here but here I've circled fears and opinions and these things that get sewn into you from parent to child parents are very good at embedding things into you and you probably know all about it things that you know that are in your life that you know your parents did and you know it's not you know and it hasn't helped you my mother made me she she man she was scared of spiders and scared of all these things and and and all these different food things she hated it took a long time a long time to get over some of those things man it's powerful how it goes in there just by the little things that they say and do so be careful what you say you're scared of in front of your children be careful of the testimony that you testify in front of them you know be careful of those things be careful of what you say to them don't tell them what they're not you might see things you tell them who they are you tell them who God is how great God is how wonderful he is how the provision of the Lord amen amen don't tell them how wrong and oh you can of course you correct them but you know don't don't put them down all the time that does nothing positive that detracts complex negative testimony phobias religious influence poor teaching you know I mean we can't we haven't all come from good religious Christian backgrounds and so you know if there is a religious influence sometimes it's been a cold formal old Tombstone of a place that has no Victory or any any virtue at all and so it puts a bad image in the child like man this stuff is just there's nothing to it you know but have a child and the family altar of your home is exposed to the glory of God exposed to that presence man you know that's something they'll never forget amen they'll never forget that you know and they may wander on their later years but they'll never forget that my parents had knew the Living God they knew the Living God and and and when they're ready and they have their their Pig pin experience they know that the father's house is Rich amen rich and and and spiritual riches Hallelujah now I want to show you how it works fear is a slave mentality as well you see here we have the murmurers in the wilderness you see they physically came out of Egypt but Egypt didn't come out of many of them they were physically taken from the slave belt and taken from the the guy that whipped them but the slavery wasn't taken out of them that slave mentality wasn't taken out of them that fear of those task Masters that they had over them all their life was not taken out of them they were taken away from the situation but the situation was still functioning very real inside their subconscious they weren't renewed in the spirit of their mind numbers 13: 25-28 and they returned from searching the searching this is when Moses sent the 12 Spies out and they came back and they returned from searching of the land after 40 days and they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel unto the Wilderness of pan to Cades and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and they told him and said we came unto the land whether thou sent us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and it is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of anch there and Caleb steal the people and i' I've kind of skipped a little bit I just went to this they was this is this is how incredibly controlling it can be be renewed in the spirit of your mind this is how controlling it can be they saw God do material Miracles creation and all sorts of things to parting Seas destroying armies they saw it up here in the conscious mind all these things that took place and yet here's this temptation that comes to them here's this this this this this challenge that they face and the same old program that was down in that subconscious the crew in the ship of those people it caused a what do they call where they what's that thing a mutiny those people had a mutiny on their hands and they and they rose up against the very word of God after all the Miracles he did and after all the things that they saw the power of the subconscious rose up and took over complet completely unreasonable they were overpowered by the emotions that was welling up from within them fear fear crippled Faith they didn't mix the word that Moses preached and the promises and the Very Miracles that happened with faith that word that was preached fear came up and strangled it away fear so you know if there's any fear in your life God can deal with it right now if there's things that have been raised up because of this preaching that you know of that in your own life it's just one simple prayer don't hang on to it amen if there's things that you know that you've been doing don't hang on to them lay them at the altar tonight you don't need to come up here your seat is your heart is the altar it's not a big complex thing you don't have to have rosaries or crawl up to some Chapel on your knees you can just lay it at the feet of Jesus right now anything that comes up amen and Caleb's I love this because see Caleb now something had happened to him Hallelujah he didn't let fear take over his sin and subconscious amen Faith got a hold of the word and still the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it he was speaking God's language they were speaking Satan's language Hallelujah and so that's what your testimony needs to be Caleb and Joshua did not say that they are they they actually agreed yes it's hard but God said this amen that's the thing that's the balance that's the balance for your testimony you don't need to pretend something's not happening and then end up sicker you need to share testimony of what God has done hallelujah and you need to not because when you speak down about yourself and and doubting this and and you're this and they're that negative negative negative negative you're speaking the devil's language but when you say we are well able to overcome it amen let's go up at once and possess our land you're speaking God's language that's God's language that's the word of God and remember that word if you're born again is in you all of it it's all in you you're not lying you're not sharing something that's a lie you're speaking the truth and the truth is already in you greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world oops I push something is it going to work huh did I turn the whole projector off okay how do you do this jomb I won't even go to the slide oh no I want to stay in the wilderness ah thank you oh I had to eat my sermon then don't let fear rise [Laughter] up let's go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land so they're speaking evil of the word at which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the land though through which we have gone to search it is a land that eats up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature and there we saw the Giants the sons of anoch which come of the Giants which we were in our own side as Grasshoppers and so were we in their sight Caleb saw the same thing but remember his testimony was different and you might be sickness under all sorts of things you might be seeing the same thing but your testimony can be different your testimony can be the word hallelujah your song that you sing can be positive Hallelujah the thoughts now you might just you might have the words covered and you might have a good testimony out loud but what's the inner testimony saying what's being preached inside your mind what's being preached down here and your thoughts that's important just as important as what you speak out and let what is in here let that be what's coming out of here all the time numbers 142:4 and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would God that we had died in the land of Egypt or would God we had died in this Wilderness and wherefore has the Lord brought us unto this land to Fall by the sword look at the the the power that the fear had upon them to doubt the Integrity of God to to diminish God from this loving pure faithful God to this God that wants to kill them and play with them and look at the power that fear can take off on a person's life it's so important now to get it dealt with God bless you Murdo we'll see you that's all good so the power of that fear is that's why you know brother Bram said this is the worst thing that the devil can put upon a man on a person as fair look what it did to these people they were scared of their circumstance and when they got scared as we read before Satan stepped in as soon as soon as the faith was crippled Satan stepped in and like a cancer and just overtook them until their very perception of God was doubting his integrity they doubted the Integrity of God thinking that he would do that to them be careful what you expose your eyes to and this is not I'm not like you know this is people are going to listen to this as well so that's not I'm not you know this is like I'm just preaching would God that we had died in the land of Egypt or would God we had died oh here to Fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be a prey were it not better for us to return into Egypt and they said one to another let us let us make a Captain who was the one that was making a captain who was the captain God had prepared for the for Israelites God was meant to be the captain God had prepared a captain for them and all they needed to do was mix it with faith and the captain will deliver them from all their enemies take them right through all their inheritance and they' have everything that God promised amen and then so before all that now the the fear just just rose up and Satan took over and now they want to make a Captain they want their own Captain because fear now Satan is controlling them fear can someone what do they call it where they just get absolutely petrified by fear physically and spiritually because there's and there's a physiological explanation is the chemicals in their body as well cuz there has to be a physical side of everything as well that we go through it it their bodies become overwhelmed then they become led by their feelings they become led by adrenaline and Cortisone and all of those chemicals that rise up inside the physical body so they say let us make a captain and let us return to Egypt Let Us return back into sin jobal I won going to spend too long on this and jeroboam said in his heart now shall the kingdom return to the House of David and you all know about jbam he was a king right before he was King Solomon's kingdom got taken from him right and not from him but from his son reab and God before as when reab I think Solomon was still alive a prophet came to Jobo and said so God now says to jerob he rents the Garment into 12 pieces and gives him 10 pieces and he says you are going to have 10 tribes God is giving you and making you King that should be good enough for anybody to have the testimony right that should be good enough not but beside all that and it actually happening it happened and he became king and yet he said in his heart so now fear comes in and takes over and throws the whole nation of Israel into idolatry because of fear he said in his heart watch what you say in your heart watch the testimony that's going on inside you and if it's negative you cast it down let it become positive think positive on positive things which is the word because otherwise if fear starts to rise up it can take you on a journey you never wanted to go down and the Lord said to Simon Simon behold Satan has desired to sift you have you that he may sift you as wheat but I have prayed for you and that thy faith fail not and when you are converted strengthen thy Brethren and he said unto him Lord I am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death up here he was up here he was ready up here he was very ready he was Peter man he was just on fire he would do anything for Jesus Hallelujah he was enthusiastic but that's not enough amen that's not enough down here Jesus identify what was going on inside his subconscious he was scared Hallelujah he was fearful so when it really came to the challenge amen when he had to eat his sermon he really got challenged man he got challenged and he failed but his faith failed not because Jesus prayed it wouldn't so there must have been a little flicker somewhere there when he when Jesus saw him and he wept you know that repentance you know the goodness of God LED that to repentance and and took him back on back onto the track humbled him down which probably did needed so that he could die to himself you know get the Holy Ghost but you should see the two consciouses going on there I for time I won't preach on it but I want to finish on this thought perfect love casts out fear and we have known and believed 1 John 4:16 to19 and we have known and believed the love that God has to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God hallelujah hello prayer people I like that line [Laughter] bin prayer you know when you're fellowshipping with God you're fellowshipping with love you are in the presence of love if you want to lay aside everything and get perfect love it's not some complex thing it's spending time with the Lord It's dwelling in the secret place of the most high I'll I'll I'll do atmosphere later on in the series where I where I where I where I really go into that but for now I'll read and God and him here in is our love made perfect or complete that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear because fear has torment he that fearth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us it's Grace Grace Grace and all Grace amen his love to is already towards us we don't have to generate it or try and call it down it's there amen hallelujah it's the guy it's the crew downstairs sometimes that Ste you away from prayer and makes it hard for you to pray you know it's it's it's got its own little agenda something sometimes and too busy and filled with information and all sorts of things going on and your affections may be set on other things just you know like I always you know just assern what are my affections set on what is make what what's giving me my joy what's giving me my comfort where is my comfort coming from is it coming from TV shows is it coming from books is it coming from God is it coming from my relationship with God and it and and it and it can take time to to steer your affections you know if your affections are set on a certain thing and it might not be a bad thing it might be work it might be something that's just but if if your affections become set on that it becomes a bad thing because it's because then for you to steer your affections back towards what is perfect love God relationship Fellowship it it can take a bit of work to stare that back because your mind is geared towards a certain thing all the time and you're enjoying it you're doing that but now you know we want to stare we want to we want to stare our ship you know because the Holy Ghost he wants to stare us into perfect love all these other things is just temporal as Isaac said earlier it's just temporal but perfect love the season we're in cast out fear brother brand says and we cuz now I'm talking about now how where does the perfect love get generated and what outworking in our life and our testimony is it generated how to get perfect love and confidence and when we were Sinners alienated without God in the world in that muck of mud as I talked about this morning God come to us God sought you you never sought God no man can come to me except my father draws him first and God came down in that muck thank the Lord that he came down in the mck amen I'm so glad for the mck for the the Lord coming into the mck amen hallelujah actually I'm so glad for the mck because it's given me some sort of you know I'm so thankful to God for a Salvation amen you know it's a contrast you can't appreciate the day without that night experience amen and we're going to read now there's an importance in that there's there's something in that that will generate perfect love for you when you realize and you can think over the what God did for you where he took you from and how he came to you when you were not even in any condition to be anything and look what he's made you now look what he's given you Hallelujah that ought to oh and God came down in that Mark what you were and sought you out and brought you out that ought to create a perfect love look what you were and look what you are what did that somebody that loved you Hallelujah can't you have faith in what he's promised you then real genuine love will create a confidence in his word real genuine love will create a confidence in his word real genuine love amen and so my prayer is Lord give me real genuine love for you and let me receive your love cuz sometimes we might love God but we can't receive his because of something in our life our parents maybe didn't love us or didn't show it they might have loved us but they didn't show it so now you find it hard to receive the love but that complex can be dealt with tonight lay it at his feet amen what did that somebody that loved you can't you have faith in what he's promised you then real genuine love or creative confidence in his word he caught me when I was nothing I'm still nothing but I'm in his hand see he caught me and he loved me when I was unlovable he loved you when you was unlovable but he changed you oh my think on it think about it pray about it confess it amen just just roll it over in your thinking let that genuine love and confidence love worketh Faith and faith and love that love casts out the fear that crippling nature that wants to doubt in your subconscious so this is dealing with that that crack of the issue to believing to be healed from a simple little cold or something simple or whatever even major stuff even if you've got no arm and you need arm to believe that an arm would grow back amen there's only one thing that stops that from happening Saints and that's doubt that's fear that cripples faith my my my now we have great things that we can do in the realm of faith faith works great things for us and if you Brethren here getting your and you can't have faith till you have love that's all there is to it you perfect love casts out all fear and as long as you got fear you can't have faith as long as you've got fear you can't have faith so you got to have love first aren't you so glad that all it requires is love you don't have to do all these works and all these things to attain to some Perfect Image you just have to have love it's what he wants he's a family God Amen he's a god of love and relationship and Grace Hallelujah it drives all fear out and then faith comes in takes the place of fear so when you have that you're coming right along amen uh we can have musicians please sorry I think I've been a little bit long oh that's okay we're still [Laughter] reasonable praise the Lord Rec so the application and this the summary of tonight recognize the season of God and live accordingly in his light so don't go and watch movies just thinking you'll come out all right in 10 15 years remember the Rapture could happen any day so don't get don't expose yourself to things that are going to sew Darkness into you and seeds that are going to need to be dealt with because believe it or not every movie that you watch unless it's some nice Christian movie I'm telling you is going to sew things in your subconscious that you don't want there that God's going to have to deal with that God God's going to have to put you through some trials to move out believe me I'm telling you this is the truth and it's going to become more clearer and clearer as the days go by you are responsible for the image you behold and portray you are responsible for the image your children behold if so be that you have heard him now this is tying it back to what we read at the beginning so you have heard him that you put off the former conversation the old man so these are things that he's asked us to do these are outworkings this is your religious activity if I can put it that way not in the wrong form of religiosity but religious activity and outworking of an inner Faith because real faith loves the Commandments of the Lord sets their affections on the things above because there's a something in them drawing them towards the rapture and be renewed in the spirit of your mind perfect love himself casts out all fear so live conscious of him amen um uh who got a song anyone got a song that's relative to the sermon I can't think of on but yeah let's sing that captain of the host as we just pray Lord Jesus father Lord there's Lord a lot of information and but father I pray you just take these words and and and Lord make sense of them to our hearts and Lord Jesus Shine your light upon every area of our lives and let your grace Lord and your love father for we found out tonight Lord Jesus that your love is the answer to the very issues of our life Lord the very thing the the main thing that cripples Faith Lord your love is the answer to antidote that is to to cast it out and I pray Lord that if there's any fear in the heart of your bride in this place Lord your perfect love would come and cast it out and that Lord if there's anything that would in our lives that would hinder perfect love coming any conflict that's stopping us from being able to receive your love Lord expose it for what it is and make it plain and let your light shine upon our lives and Upon Our Hearts this evening Lord and through throughout the week and throughout our lives Lord Jesus deal with these things Lord deal with the Heart Lord deal with stuff that we don't even know exists we don't even know it's there but it's it's been sewed in there from our lives and um our upbringings Lord father shine your light upon it Lord and expose it so that we can love and be loved and receive love so that perfect love can cast out all fear and faith can take its place oh God that's our desire Lord that
