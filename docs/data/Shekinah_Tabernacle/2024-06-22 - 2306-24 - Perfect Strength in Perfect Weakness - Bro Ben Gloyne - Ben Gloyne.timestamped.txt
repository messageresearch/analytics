[42:25] Corinthians uh chapter 1 vers 8 to10
[42:28] then we're going to read from 2
[42:29] Corinthians 3:
[42:31] 1-6 it says here uh for we would not
[42:35] Brethren have you ignorant of our
[42:37] trouble that has come to us in Asia that
[42:40] we were pressed out of measure above
[42:42] strength in so much that we despaired
[42:45] even of life but we uh but we had the
[42:48] sentence of death in ourselves that we
[42:50] should not trust in ourselves but in God
[42:53] which raiseth the Dead who delivered us
[42:56] from so great a death and doth deliver
[42:59] in whom we trust that he will yet
[43:01] Deliver us we're going to have trouble
[43:04] on this road it's going to be
[43:06] overwhelming at times but our God's able
[43:10] amen Our God's more than able amen amen
[43:12] second Corinthians then we go to chapter
[43:14] 3:
[43:16] 1-6 this is one of my favorite uh piece
[43:20] of scripture at the moment this bit here
[43:22] I mean I love second Corinthians but
[43:24] this one Do We Begin Again to Comm
[43:27] commend ourselves or need we as some
[43:29] other others Epistles of commendation to
[43:31] you or letters of commendation from you
[43:34] for ye are our epistle written in our
[43:36] hearts known and read of all men and uh
[43:39] for as much as ye are manifestly
[43:41] declared to be the Epistle of Christ
[43:43] ministered by US Written not with ink
[43:46] but with the spirit of the Living God
[43:48] not in tables of stone but in fleshly
[43:50] tables of the heart and such trust have
[43:54] we through Christ to godward not that we
[43:57] are sufficient of ourselves this is this
[43:59] is my favorite scripture right here
[44:00] right now not that we are sufficient of
[44:02] ourselves to think anything of ourselves
[44:05] but our sufficiency is of God Amen I
[44:08] like that don't you amen let's bow our
[44:10] heads in a word of prayer this morning
[44:12] amen let's let's commit our lives in
[44:14] into the hands of our maker gracious
[44:16] Lord Jesus thank you so much Lord we can
[44:19] commit Our Lives into your hands thank
[44:20] you Lord that our sufficiency comes from
[44:23] you our ability comes from you dear God
[44:25] and Father as we bow our heads we want
[44:26] to commit Our Lives commit all that we
[44:28] are into your hands father that you

[45:00] up for your glory and dear God as we are
[45:03] here today I pray that you'll just Lord
[45:05] we just want to get ourselves out of the
[45:06] way Lord Jesus and we want you to take
[45:08] over so may you take over speaker and
[45:11] hearer those who are streaming those who
[45:12] are sick and body who are not here be
[45:14] their portion Lord in Jesus Christ's
[45:17] name have your way amen amen God bless
[45:19] you friends you can have your seats uh
[45:22] this morning so I want to speak about uh
[45:24] perfect strength and perfect weakness
[45:26] now I really was thinking about this uh
[45:29] uh for a while and I really should just
[45:32] uh call all my sermons for the last year
[45:34] uh the second fold uh uh the second
[45:37] phase of God's three-fold purpose part
[45:40] 65 now you may not make any sense to
[45:43] that but brother Bram says in Christ is
[45:44] a mystery of God revealed because I
[45:46] think some people get in their mind I'm
[45:47] not saying here but people somehow think
[45:50] you got to throw out a lot of message
[45:51] terminology for it to be a message
[45:53] sermon right no you don't
[45:57] I've been preaching the seventh seal the
[45:58] whole time we've been here right I may
[46:01] not use the phraseology but I just pray
[46:03] see this message needs to go from Theory
[46:06] and concept to reality it's got to be
[46:08] appliable it's got to be where the
[46:10] rubber hits the road you know where that
[46:11] gravel and the rubber meat that's where
[46:15] it's got to be amen so so this is why
[46:17] maybe maybe some people I don't know I
[46:20] just think maybe some people think maybe
[46:21] I'm not messy enough well I think I'm
[46:23] pretty messy amen
[46:27] buzzword don't bring the Holy Ghost the
[46:30] reality of the word brings the Holy
[46:32] Ghost amen that's why we need him so
[46:34] brother Bram says this in Christ your
[46:36] mystery of God revealed now what is the
[46:37] whole three-fold purpose was see to
[46:39] express himself he wants to become see
[46:41] the world is lost now he has to express
[46:43] himself in a man to become a savior
[46:45] through the reconciliation of the blood
[46:47] from his cross now he had to become that
[46:49] to die in order to save and to bring
[46:51] himself back into a church to have the
[46:53] preeminence in his church that's the
[46:55] second fold phase to the Christ mystery
[46:58] of God revealed right so what I've been
[46:59] preaching on is that Christ would have
[47:01] preeminence in us right so so it's not
[47:04] malice Strife unbelief carnality Pride
[47:08] nothing human has preeminence in our
[47:09] lives but he does that's what we need
[47:12] amen if we want to see God live in power
[47:15] we need him to have preeminence amen
[47:17] because this is not we are not a one man
[47:19] one person denomination doing what we
[47:21] want no we want him to be our head amen
[47:24] he's our King amen he's not a rejected
[47:26] King in our lives he is the accepted
[47:29] loved adored worship King amen so now
[47:32] the Apostle Paul he says he say his
[47:35] sufficiency he would not
[47:37] trust uh he see not that we are
[47:40] sufficient of ourselves to think
[47:41] anything of ourselves but our
[47:43] sufficiency is of God now it's amazing
[47:46] when you think about this where the
[47:48] Apostle Paul if there was any man that
[47:50] had ability in himself it was him he was
[47:54] a Pharisee of the Pharisees I mean he he
[47:57] was raised up on the Bible on the on the
[48:00] what we call the Old Testament you know
[48:01] he is a very smart man very astute man
[48:04] he knew a lot of different languages he
[48:06] you know so you think man this guy is
[48:07] sufficient he's got the ability but God
[48:10] could use none of those things in order
[48:12] to to to bring Salvation to the Gentiles
[48:16] and there's one thing I just want to try
[48:18] and get across this morning is that when
[48:20] we think we can do it God can't do it
[48:24] you know I know I've used this um saying
[48:26] quite a few times and I think I haven't
[48:27] said in a long time but I used to say
[48:29] you know this is not my first
[48:31] rodeo you know and to a sense that's
[48:34] true but when we get to a point where
[48:36] we're trusting in our in in our
[48:38] experience above the god that gave the
[48:41] experience then that's a dangerous thing
[48:44] you know when we get to a place where we
[48:46] where we think well we know what we're
[48:47] doing then God can't do what he needs to
[48:49] do amen we must always perfectly depend
[48:53] upon the Lord that for him to fulfill
[48:55] his word sure we can look back and we
[48:58] can have confidence that the god that
[49:00] found us and saved us and did everything
[49:01] he did in the past will still live today
[49:04] cuz he's the same yesterday today and
[49:05] forever but when we think we know what
[49:07] we're doing his hands are tied right but
[49:11] if we stay completely surrendered sold
[49:13] out trusting and relying on his ability
[49:16] then that's where he can step on the
[49:17] scene now that's basically my sermon we
[49:19] could go home now but I just want to go
[49:20] through it a bit because I just really
[49:22] remember this is this is an age there's
[49:24] never been an age like this age where
[49:27] man can rely and depend upon his own
[49:30] ability what's the answer to every
[49:32] question I know Google will know right
[49:35] how long did that take to come through a
[49:37] couple of milliseconds and this is how
[49:38] many results you know man trust in their
[49:40] ability to find the Answer Man trust in
[49:43] their ability to work out the answer
[49:45] look at this this age we live in you
[49:47] know how do we get to the moon how do we
[49:48] fix the planet how do we do this people
[49:50] Trust on their own ability amen but the
[49:53] bride of Christ is not here we're not
[49:55] here to trust in our own abil abity we
[49:57] had to trust in God's ability cuz
[49:59] remember the ability of our God is
[50:01] unlimited what he can do amen he can
[50:04] there's no limit to our god there's
[50:06] nothing that he cannot achieve amen if
[50:08] he made the body you live in he made
[50:11] this planet that you walk on he made the
[50:13] food that you eat amen he made the
[50:14] materials that man has taken and made
[50:16] this made these clothes made this
[50:18] structure made you know he made
[50:20] everything just like the Bible said he
[50:21] made the Sun and the Moon he made the
[50:23] Stars also just as a like an offhand
[50:25] comment yeah he made all that I made all
[50:27] that by the way you know I think we can
[50:29] trust in this guy the Lord Jesus yeah
[50:32] yeah I think we can trust in God to to
[50:33] direct our paths and to work out every
[50:36] situation you see see it's the devil's
[50:39] it's it's an attribute of Satan to do it
[50:41] your own way you know I was um you know
[50:44] you know as you know I'm at work and you
[50:45] it's an it's an open plan lab and the
[50:48] and the radio was going and Frank
[50:49] Sinatra song was playing I did it my way
[50:53] and I thought if there ever was a uh the
[50:57] devil's
[50:58] testimony was that one that song I did
[51:02] it my way and the devil wants that
[51:06] attitude to be in US of course wrapped
[51:09] up in in religion in the message right
[51:12] but he but but that's the devil he said
[51:13] I did it my way he wasn't content with
[51:16] how God made him he wasn't happy with
[51:18] the POs he had the greatest position in
[51:20] all the Angels right he wasn't just a
[51:22] little lower angel I don't know what
[51:24] they called exactly he was the he was
[51:26] the top guy you know even you know the
[51:28] um you know even brother Brown would say
[51:29] that that that that that God made Satan
[51:32] basically just like him but he couldn't
[51:34] create of course limied his
[51:35] understanding all these things but he
[51:37] was basically Made In His Image in a way
[51:40] he was that powerful but yet couldn't
[51:42] create but so the devil got in his mind
[51:45] I'm going to do things my way and then
[51:47] he injected that through into the human
[51:50] race but you see we are not called to
[51:53] live in that way at at all amen but but
[51:57] our Our Song should be I did it his
[52:00] way amen I did it the word's way amen
[52:04] now if you don't you if you like that
[52:06] song have not tring on any toes I was
[52:07] thought man that's um what a testimony
[52:10] of the devil I did it my way I had it my
[52:13] way no I don't want it my way my way
[52:16] ends up in wreckage my my way ends up in
[52:18] ruin my my way ends up in a very bad
[52:21] place his way ends up in glory amen so I
[52:24] think I'll take that way amen Hallelujah
[52:27] so so this word sufficiency means
[52:29] ability amen so he said his sufficiency
[52:32] wasn't of of of himself but his ability
[52:35] or sufficiency was of God
[52:39] now brother Braham says this in perfect
[52:41] strength and by Perfect weakness because
[52:43] remember I think we've got to a place
[52:45] because it's uh I think it was uh they
[52:47] said this this year or this week was the
[52:49] 60th anniversary when the Beatles came
[52:52] to
[52:53] Wellington 1964 they came to Wellington
[52:57] I think the same time that may have been
[52:58] a different tour they they went to
[53:01] Australia and they said that that tour
[53:04] changed the face of Australia one tour
[53:06] one band four boy four men whatever
[53:09] coming singing some concerts changed the
[53:12] whole face of Australia socially was
[53:15] isolated more conservative then they
[53:17] came in an anointing was released and
[53:19] look at the place they have now right I
[53:21] say the same thing with New Zealand see
[53:23] so and then you take it on the flip side
[53:26] with the message is that it's been here
[53:28] over 60
[53:30] years we have become accustomed to
[53:33] looking at quotes and scriptures and
[53:34] putting things together and having
[53:36] church and you know it's become a
[53:38] routine but in that routine human
[53:41] strength can come up well I know the
[53:43] answer I can find the answer I can I can
[53:46] get this quote and put this together and
[53:48] I trust you're following me today amen
[53:50] you know people in their own strength
[53:52] can put the word together and put a case
[53:54] forward even Even in our own strength
[53:56] stren you know you can put a sermon
[53:58] together you can search a key word boom
[54:01] boom boom here you go an hour later you
[54:03] walk out but is that is that God's
[54:05] strength or is that the man's strength
[54:08] right is it is it the weakness of the
[54:10] man saying Lord Lord I need there's food
[54:12] for us today Lord there's something for
[54:14] us spiritually you know is it that or is
[54:17] it my human strength delivering the word
[54:20] is it our human strength leading our
[54:22] families is it our human strength
[54:24] raising our children or is it God's
[54:27] strength you can't have both operating
[54:30] at the same
[54:31] time brother R says this now he says the
[54:34] case of it is is that is not that we are
[54:37] too weak the case is we're too strong
[54:39] we're just too strong that's all the
[54:41] thing of it is we're too strong headed
[54:43] that's right we're too strong in our
[54:45] head we know too much God wants to get
[54:47] that out of us that's right we're too
[54:49] strong we're too strong to yield to him
[54:52] amen we we yield to ourselves amen we've
[54:56] got to think well now I got sense enough
[54:58] to know so you say so we yield to
[55:00] something we either yield to God or we
[55:02] yield to
[55:03] ourselves I'd rather yield to him amen
[55:06] well how do you yield to yourself yield
[55:07] to your own understanding yield to your
[55:09] own feelings yield to your own makeup
[55:12] well I'm just made this way so I'm going
[55:13] to go this way no no no that's that's
[55:15] yielding to yourself you're surrendering
[55:17] to your own will and that will is a
[55:19] rubbish will by the way that's a that's
[55:21] a bogus GPS it takes you it says you're
[55:23] on the pathway up some Mountain
[55:25] somewhere or in the valley somewhere
[55:27] you're you're totally off the course
[55:29] right but if we can if if we can lay
[55:31] aside our own strength and yield to his
[55:34] strength amen then then God can step in
[55:37] and do the miraculous God can do what he
[55:39] needs to do amen so you know the Apostle
[55:43] Paul you think about this man he was
[55:45] strong he was intelligent he was more
[55:47] than able to do the job see his
[55:49] sufficiency changed when he met the Lord
[55:51] on the road to Damascus and he stayed in
[55:53] that state all the days of his life see
[55:56] see God had to break a cycle of Revival
[55:59] and death and he broke it in the Apostle
[56:01] Paul's life he proved that it's not a
[56:04] onetime thing where you where you just
[56:06] meet the Lord then you go on fire then
[56:08] you cool off and no God continually lit
[56:10] the flame in his life he died daily that
[56:14] sent sentence of death in himself he was
[56:16] dead to self that God would deliver amen
[56:18] because he had sufficient he knew his
[56:20] sufficiency was of the Lord so he knew
[56:23] everything he did my ability is not my
[56:25] own ability now he would he would he
[56:27] would you got to think about this man
[56:29] The Incredible the Incredible thing that
[56:32] God did see Paul or Saul sufficiency or
[56:35] ability before he met the Lord was his
[56:37] own intellect how smart he was it was
[56:40] how much he memorized the scripture I
[56:42] believe he probably could have he quoted
[56:44] it from Genesis to Malachi that's all
[56:47] they had at that time he could have
[56:48] quoted that word for word it would have
[56:50] been completely right all that's fine
[56:52] right but but he would have been
[56:53] depending upon that he would have been
[56:55] depending upon his own interpretation of
[56:58] the scripture instead of asking instead
[57:00] of asking the author of the scripture to
[57:02] come interpret it to him he is asking
[57:04] the rabbi to interpret it to him he's
[57:05] asking Gia some some some some learned
[57:08] man as opposed to letting the author of
[57:11] the scripture himself come and interpret
[57:13] it to him that's why it's so important
[57:14] see we got to realize that the scripture
[57:17] is not of any private interpretation but
[57:19] God moved on men of old and gave the
[57:21] script so so so so the answer is some
[57:23] people say well it's not of any private
[57:24] interpretation then how can you say that
[57:27] brother Braham has the right
[57:27] interpretation but the next scripture
[57:29] answers it said it's not man's private
[57:31] interpretation that they work it out but
[57:33] God moved on holy men of all moved on
[57:35] prophets and gave the interpretation
[57:38] right so it's not we're not following an
[57:40] a private interpretation of the
[57:41] scripture we're following God's
[57:43] interpretation of his word revealed
[57:45] through a
[57:46] prophet amen so it's not us trying to
[57:49] depend on our own human ability to have
[57:52] the right interpretation no it's God's
[57:54] interpretation of the word because God's
[57:56] interpretation of the word produces what
[57:58] God said it will produce amen if the
[58:00] Bible says repent be baptized in the
[58:02] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[58:03] remission of sin and you shall receive
[58:05] the gift of the Holy Ghost that
[58:08] happens amen we're living evidence that
[58:11] it works amen so that's how we know
[58:13] God's interpretation is right or that
[58:15] interpretation is right because God
[58:17] produces what it says it'll produce amen
[58:21] but you see so see his human Drive is
[58:24] what he thought was uh he was um you
[58:27] know made him sufficient his ambition
[58:29] his reasoning his obtaining a letter
[58:32] from the high priest all these things he
[58:33] thought this was this was his
[58:35] sufficiency look I've got this standing
[58:37] among people he cared about what the
[58:39] Pharisees thought of him amen he you
[58:41] know he was he was all the he thought
[58:45] this was his ability was from all those
[58:46] things all of it was completely 100%
[58:49] against God all these things he relied
[58:52] on this was his identity well I know the
[58:55] scripture I'm a Pharisee the Pharisees I
[58:56] got to drive I want to I want to serve
[58:58] God in this system I want to be the best
[59:00] I can be and you know all those things
[59:02] I've got this letter from the high
[59:04] priest I've got Authority from an
[59:05] Earthly system but you see when he met
[59:07] the Lord on the road to Damascus all
[59:10] that strength became nothing I mean when
[59:12] he realized his own real condition
[59:14] everything he relied on was completely
[59:16] wrong imagine being in that position
[59:18] everything you've you've you've you've
[59:20] worked for achieved thought of
[59:24] sacrificed for you're completely
[59:27] wrong but you see God needs us to get to
[59:29] that position he wants us to come to
[59:32] that realization that everything we are
[59:35] what we think we are in terms of our own
[59:37] ability it doesn't get us
[59:40] anywhere are we together this morning
[59:43] amen see this is see it's not see his
[59:45] sufficiency changed from his own self
[59:47] and what people thought of him to God
[59:50] himself amen his his so his ability or
[59:53] his sufficiency came from only Earthly
[59:55] things but then it changed that it only
[59:57] came from God himself so he didn't rely
[1:00:00] on everything he used to rely on he
[1:00:03] didn't rely on anymore he didn't rely on
[1:00:05] his upbringing anymore he didn't rely on
[1:00:07] his family name anymore didn't rely on
[1:00:08] his his his lineage any of those things
[1:00:11] I've been raised you know my you know my
[1:00:13] girls oh and William now I can say that
[1:00:15] now you my children are fourth
[1:00:17] generation message
[1:00:19] believers they can't rely on
[1:00:21] that that is the wrong kind of
[1:00:24] sufficiency no they're suff iy has to be
[1:00:26] the Lord see God don't have
[1:00:28] grandchildren God has sons and daughters
[1:00:31] that are birthed by him amen so so it
[1:00:34] requires not just leaning on well this
[1:00:36] is my family this is my parents this is
[1:00:38] my church what you know all those things
[1:00:40] no our sufficiency has to come from the
[1:00:42] Lord amen because if we're trusting only
[1:00:46] in him then he can come on the scene you
[1:00:48] see so the Apostle Paul he became
[1:00:51] perfectly weak but then he became
[1:00:53] perfectly strong when he became
[1:00:55] perfectly weak see when he was strong in
[1:00:56] himself he had nothing with God but then
[1:00:59] when he became perfectly weak and
[1:01:02] realized his failure of his human
[1:01:04] ability now when he realized this he
[1:01:07] didn't wallow in a pity party see some
[1:01:11] people they hear perfect strength
[1:01:12] perfect weakness and they say I'm no
[1:01:13] good I can't amount to nothing and you
[1:01:15] know poor me and I've got no abilities
[1:01:17] and I got nothing I can give to God and
[1:01:19] they wallow in it and it's Pride
[1:01:22] actually coming out it's Pride that
[1:01:24] comes out and says well well I'm useless
[1:01:26] I've got no ability you know well Jesus
[1:01:29] says without me I can do nothing so I
[1:01:30] can do nothing and you know it's
[1:01:32] unbelief speaking but God God doesn't
[1:01:35] want us to speak like that see pride
[1:01:37] looks at self pride looks at own ability
[1:01:40] the Apostle Paul was a very proud
[1:01:43] man he would have had a Persona had a
[1:01:46] reputation yes I'm this oh here comes
[1:01:48] the great Minister into the town the
[1:01:50] great Pharisee of the Pharisees and you
[1:01:52] know he he would have been a very proud
[1:01:53] man but then when he met the Lord all
[1:01:56] that Pride was burnt out of him
[1:01:57] completely amen all of that all of that
[1:02:00] ability and what he thought of himself
[1:02:02] he said I count all things but D that I
[1:02:05] may win Christ he says he says do we
[1:02:08] have confidence I'll just read this from
[1:02:09] Philippians 3 he says for we are the
[1:02:12] circumcision which worship God in the
[1:02:14] spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and
[1:02:16] have no confidence in the flesh amen
[1:02:19] though I might also have confidence in
[1:02:21] In the Flesh If any man thinketh that he
[1:02:23] ought a ha thereof he might Trust In the
[1:02:26] Flesh I more I love it how God gives
[1:02:28] someone a testimony that can destroy
[1:02:31] everyone else's argument can destroy all
[1:02:33] the pride and whatever people thinking
[1:02:35] see God would take someone like the
[1:02:36] Apostle Paul and say look I've been in
[1:02:39] your shoes I don't trust in what you
[1:02:41] think you should be trusting in no what
[1:02:43] you're trusting in is completely wrong I
[1:02:45] used to trust in it but I've got a
[1:02:46] better way cuz God has shown me a higher
[1:02:49] way amen but he could relate to them
[1:02:51] saying look don't trust in those things
[1:02:54] and I'm going to tell you why that that
[1:02:56] you think humanly I should trust in them
[1:02:58] more than you because I was circumcised
[1:03:00] on the eighth day I'm from Israel I'm an
[1:03:02] Israelite I'm The Tribe of Benjamin I
[1:03:03] know where I'm from I'm a Hebrew of the
[1:03:05] Hebrews I'm not a lukewarm Hebrew I'm a
[1:03:08] real zealous Hebrew I'm a real genuine
[1:03:10] as touching the law a Pharisee I do more
[1:03:12] than what's expected of me remember they
[1:03:14] added a bunch of laws and regulations to
[1:03:16] the law right human laws he says I'm a
[1:03:18] Pharisee basically if you saw him you
[1:03:20] say man this guy is real devout but
[1:03:23] inwardly he was dead see he was trusting
[1:03:25] in his own self his own ambition people
[1:03:28] can be humanly good message Believers
[1:03:30] for a long
[1:03:31] time in their own drive and own ambition
[1:03:34] but that'll come to an end it has to
[1:03:36] come to an end because God wants to
[1:03:38] prove it ain't your ability you just be
[1:03:40] going around in a cycle of inward
[1:03:42] frustration and you know just a grinding
[1:03:44] out and these things but when God comes
[1:03:45] and brings you Liberty from that then
[1:03:48] you can Rejoice then it's no longer a
[1:03:49] burden it's a joy to serve the Lord It's
[1:03:52] a joy to be a believer if people you
[1:03:54] know the world says you can't do those
[1:03:55] things thank God I'm not in that sewage
[1:03:57] pipe of the world I'm free I've been
[1:04:00] cleansed see to be Sanctified is is is
[1:04:02] to be cleansed from one thing but it's
[1:04:04] been to to be Sanctified to another am
[1:04:06] mean so we're not just Sanctified from
[1:04:08] the world people oh from no no I've been
[1:04:10] separated to God Amen if I been
[1:04:13] separated to God then God can live in my
[1:04:15] life then everything that he gives me
[1:04:17] which is not perverted and he doesn't
[1:04:18] give anything perverted gives a lasting
[1:04:21] satisfaction and joy amen it doesn't
[1:04:23] give you an empty promise that just
[1:04:25] makes you angry and empty on the inside
[1:04:26] no it gives you a promise that is full
[1:04:29] is what it is amen see the joy of the
[1:04:31] Lord is not
[1:04:33] empty praise God the joy of the law is
[1:04:35] not frustrating amen it's not something
[1:04:37] that's just a a you a carrot that keeps
[1:04:39] moving on a stick and you're running
[1:04:40] after it no he gives you what he wants
[1:04:42] to give you and then you can have your
[1:04:44] cake and eat it too I like cake I'm a
[1:04:46] sweet too so I like that kind of thing
[1:04:48] amen you praise L yeah so he's saying
[1:04:51] look I can't he says so I'm a Pharisee
[1:04:54] concerning Zeal persecuting the church
[1:04:57] touching the righteousness which is of
[1:04:58] the law blameless this is how he was but
[1:05:02] what things were gained to me those I
[1:05:04] counted loss for Christ yet doubtless
[1:05:06] and I count all things but loss for the
[1:05:08] Excellency of the knowledge of Christ
[1:05:10] Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered
[1:05:12] the loss of all things and do count them
[1:05:15] but dung that I may win Christ so he's
[1:05:17] saying look all those things that I
[1:05:19] trusted in that's dung on the field boys
[1:05:22] don't rely on those things don't rely on
[1:05:24] your lineage where your from your mom
[1:05:26] and dad no your sufficiency must go from
[1:05:29] those things to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:31] himself amen that our ability is not in
[1:05:35] ourselves it's in him it's not in we
[1:05:38] know it's in him it's not the church we
[1:05:40] go to it's in him right amen because all
[1:05:44] human things come to an end but God God
[1:05:46] is Unlimited in what he can
[1:05:48] do Hallelujah so he said his sufficiency
[1:05:51] is of the Lord now notice this in our in
[1:05:54] our opening scripture where he said that
[1:05:55] they were you know you know saying that
[1:05:58] don't you I don't want you to be
[1:05:59] ignorant of our trouble which came to us
[1:06:00] in Asia you see when we're perfectly
[1:06:02] weak then we become perfectly strong but
[1:06:06] then that doesn't mean there's an
[1:06:07] absence of trouble and it doesn't mean
[1:06:08] it won't affect us right amen so he says
[1:06:12] we're pressed pressed out of measure
[1:06:15] above strength in so much so we
[1:06:17] despaired even of life amen so he came
[1:06:20] to a point this this trouble he came was
[1:06:23] a great trouble it was an overwhelming
[1:06:24] trouble amen it was above his strength
[1:06:27] it was you even despair that they are
[1:06:29] alive that's how vexing and heavy it
[1:06:31] became but he did not he did not allow
[1:06:35] that to cause him to rely on his own
[1:06:37] ability you see when Trouble Comes The
[1:06:40] Devil's trying to ward off a blessing
[1:06:41] coming to you right you you read through
[1:06:45] the scripture there's a trial but then
[1:06:46] there's always a blessing after the
[1:06:48] trial amen Abraham had a trial of Faith
[1:06:51] 25 years but he got the blessing
[1:06:54] Hallelujah Isaac came he was born amen
[1:06:57] that you know so you see there's many
[1:06:58] troubles like that down through the
[1:07:00] Bible but you got to realize there's
[1:07:01] always Sunshine after a storm right you
[1:07:05] may well the storm's going for a long
[1:07:06] time but there's Sunshine after it don't
[1:07:09] quit in the trouble don't quit in the
[1:07:11] trouble you see when we really sell out
[1:07:14] to the Lord when we really give our
[1:07:15] lives to him we don't get upset when
[1:07:17] Trouble Comes and throw our toys out of
[1:07:19] the cot right Jesus knew the pain and
[1:07:22] anguish he would suffer on Calvary right
[1:07:25] he never because he fully surrendered in
[1:07:28] in the garden then whatever would come
[1:07:30] to him after that it couldn't change his
[1:07:33] mind amen it couldn't change his mind
[1:07:36] because he said no Lord not my not my
[1:07:38] will but thy will be done see he was
[1:07:40] perfectly strong perfect strength and
[1:07:42] perfect weakness he became perfectly
[1:07:44] weak that the strength of God could flow
[1:07:46] through his life that he could fulfill
[1:07:48] the word allotted to him you see we love
[1:07:50] to talk about you know that we' know in
[1:07:52] the power of his resurrection but what
[1:07:54] about the fellowship of of his
[1:07:55] sufferings it's the same scripture you
[1:07:57] see you've got to have it hand in hand
[1:08:00] brother brah said that there you even
[1:08:01] Jesus would you know would be asked by
[1:08:03] the sons of thunder or the mother of the
[1:08:05] sons of thunder because mothers want the
[1:08:06] best things for their sons and their
[1:08:08] children and you know she came to Jesus
[1:08:10] and said you know can my son sit on your
[1:08:12] left and right hand in the kingdom and
[1:08:14] and you know Jesus said no it's not you
[1:08:17] know it's not given you know I can't
[1:08:19] give it to them you know it's for those
[1:08:21] who overcome basically so there's a
[1:08:23] position there's a place that the
[1:08:25] Overcomer sits with him right but then
[1:08:29] but then he asked him can you drink of
[1:08:30] the cup that I'll drink can you be
[1:08:32] baptized with the baptism I have
[1:08:33] received they said yes so that cup that
[1:08:35] he received was a cup of
[1:08:38] suffering so there's a measure of
[1:08:40] suffering that would be placed upon the
[1:08:42] church as well Amen brother BR even said
[1:08:45] that a church that ain't ain't ain't
[1:08:47] struggling don't have
[1:08:49] it
[1:08:50] hallelujah praise God amen amen that
[1:08:53] means if we got trouble we got it amen
[1:08:56] and the Apostle Paul after that Damascus
[1:08:58] Road experience he just had
[1:09:00] trouble but if you could ask him was it
[1:09:02] worth it he'd say every day was worth it
[1:09:04] every stripe was worth it cuz I was
[1:09:07] perfectly weak and his strength was made
[1:09:09] perfect in my weakness because all I
[1:09:11] desired growing up was to see this God
[1:09:13] that lived amen and God had to take me
[1:09:16] out of what I thought I knew about him
[1:09:17] into what I into who he really was and
[1:09:21] every day he began to prove himself even
[1:09:23] when I was chained to a Roman soldier I
[1:09:25] was I was in a boat in a storm I was
[1:09:27] running for my life trouble would you
[1:09:29] know start having church and the mob
[1:09:31] would come up and Scatter the church and
[1:09:33] cause trouble it was all worth it
[1:09:36] because his desire and that's every
[1:09:38] believer's desire is that God would live
[1:09:40] they don't want to live they're not they
[1:09:42] they just want to see him live am mean
[1:09:43] that that's what I want to see is to see
[1:09:45] his word live in trouble and good times
[1:09:49] you know we're not as I've said before
[1:09:52] many times you know the right condition
[1:09:54] to be in for God to live is not to have
[1:09:56] your nice quiet instrumental worship
[1:09:59] music playing and your favorite cup of
[1:10:01] coffee and your favorite View and no no
[1:10:04] it's it's faith in the
[1:10:05] word causes God to live it's not about
[1:10:09] the circumstances you're in it's not the
[1:10:10] trouble you're going through the Apostle
[1:10:12] Paul was in a storm which would have
[1:10:14] probably been worse than the cook
[1:10:15] straight when the you know when the
[1:10:16] fairies are closed all those things in
[1:10:18] this little boat I remember seeing when
[1:10:20] I was young cuz I love sailing and
[1:10:22] Pirates and you know all those things
[1:10:23] and ships and you know seeing the
[1:10:24] replica of the Endeavor coming to gizon
[1:10:27] Harbor I look at this
[1:10:29] thing this little bottle stopper and
[1:10:32] they sailed around the world in this
[1:10:33] little thing it's not big it's quite
[1:10:36] underwhelming to be fair it's quite
[1:10:38] underwhelming this thing but you see the
[1:10:41] Apostle Paul he would have been on a
[1:10:42] smaller ship than that and yet he's
[1:10:44] going up and down in the storm 14 days
[1:10:47] that's a long storm that's a long that's
[1:10:49] a long time to feel the your sear up and
[1:10:51] now I don't know if he seasick or not he
[1:10:53] didn't record it it didn't obviously
[1:10:55] that wasn't a thing that needed
[1:10:56] mentioning maybe if for argument sake he
[1:10:59] was but yet he didn't let his conditions
[1:11:02] am trouble him I'm going to
[1:11:07] Rome that that was him I'm going to Rome
[1:11:10] the angel of the Lord told me I'm going
[1:11:11] to Rome amen so it doesn't matter what
[1:11:14] comes I'm going to stay perfectly weak
[1:11:16] that the Lord can reveal and manifest
[1:11:18] that word in my life and we got to
[1:11:20] realize we're going to heaven yes sir as
[1:11:24] the angel of the Lord told you through
[1:11:25] the message you're going to
[1:11:27] glory amen so you'll go through storms
[1:11:29] you'll go through trouble you go through
[1:11:31] hardship you go through re rejection you
[1:11:33] go through all kinds of things you go
[1:11:35] through misunderstandings and God won't
[1:11:38] necessarily give you the answer I was
[1:11:40] reading John I think it's amazing the
[1:11:42] resurrection happens Peter is Peter is
[1:11:44] seen where the disciples are gone
[1:11:46] fishing discouraged you know and Peter
[1:11:48] sees the Lord on the Shore Bank he jumps
[1:11:51] in he swims to him all those things
[1:11:52] happen you know Peter's asked by Jesus
[1:11:55] three times do you love me that's all
[1:11:56] happened and then it says that you know
[1:11:59] and it's amazing John's recording this
[1:12:01] about himself that Peter spied the
[1:12:03] disciple that Jesus loved and said
[1:12:05] what's going to happen to this guy and
[1:12:08] Jesus says what's it for you to know
[1:12:10] follow thou me he's a resurrected Lord
[1:12:12] Of Glory telling one of his
[1:12:15] disciples don't even worry about that
[1:12:17] stuff I'm not even really going to tell
[1:12:19] you follow me and we want an answer from
[1:12:23] God because we've been Googled we've
[1:12:25] been conditioned by Google and God
[1:12:27] doesn't answer us all things does he
[1:12:29] have to give you an answer he's God well
[1:12:32] that's not fair well I mean Daniel it's
[1:12:35] amazing you look at the Prophet Daniel
[1:12:36] because but I've been walking with God
[1:12:38] all this time the Prophet Daniel he came
[1:12:41] from Jerusalem as a Young Man decided to
[1:12:44] follow God he comes down to the end of
[1:12:46] his Road he's been walking with God I
[1:12:48] don't know how old he was when he died I
[1:12:49] haven't Googled it and he asked because
[1:12:52] he sees you know it says in Daniel with
[1:12:55] the you know the Ancient of Days would
[1:12:57] come forth white as wool and the Saints
[1:12:59] would be given the kingdom and all these
[1:13:00] things would happen and and Daniel said
[1:13:03] Lord when are these things going to
[1:13:04] happen and he's just told it's not for
[1:13:07] you to
[1:13:08] know do you read and I Daniel complained
[1:13:11] loudly and turned my back on God many
[1:13:13] days because he didn't tell me no he
[1:13:14] just walked with
[1:13:16] God cuz his strength was made perfect in
[1:13:19] his weakness he relied on God every day
[1:13:22] of his life Monday through Friday
[1:13:25] Saturday I don't know what they called
[1:13:26] them in those days but you know he
[1:13:27] relied on God so God's strength was made
[1:13:30] perfect in his weakness he was wise he
[1:13:33] he see we all have abilities God can't
[1:13:36] use
[1:13:37] them if we're not fully surrendered to
[1:13:39] him oh but I'm very gifted doesn't mean
[1:13:43] nothing that means you're just saying
[1:13:45] you're strong you've got to surrender
[1:13:48] all that you are to him and let him use
[1:13:49] it you're the king of sarus I think goes
[1:13:51] I don't have it in me but I I don't have
[1:13:53] it in me I don't I don't have the
[1:13:55] scripture in Ezekiel exactly but he says
[1:13:57] that you are wiser than Daniel he was a
[1:14:00] man who was wiser than Daniel incredibly
[1:14:03] Gifted Man but he used that gift to
[1:14:06] gather a kingdom to himself so he used
[1:14:09] that gift in his strength to do what he
[1:14:12] wanted to do how many people these very
[1:14:14] gifted people in the world what are they
[1:14:16] doing with that gift what are they doing
[1:14:17] with their lives amen so it's not see
[1:14:19] see the Apostle Paul remember he was he
[1:14:22] was the first church age Church age
[1:14:24] messenger
[1:14:25] gifts are born in a person he would have
[1:14:28] had a had
[1:14:30] a are you all following me today I feel
[1:14:33] like sometimes you might as well be
[1:14:34] talking in the mirror anyway but you
[1:14:36] know he was a very gifted he was a very
[1:14:37] I don't do that by the way he was a very
[1:14:39] gifted person right he was born with
[1:14:41] that gift that gift gave him influence
[1:14:43] among people but he had to realize he
[1:14:46] had to count that all but D that God
[1:14:48] would live oh look what I can do within
[1:14:51] no that's the problem you should be look
[1:14:53] what he can do in me in spite of me he
[1:14:56] can live in spite of me he can speak in
[1:14:58] spite of me he can sing Lord take my
[1:15:01] life and use it for your glory Lord I
[1:15:03] without you lord I can do nothing and
[1:15:05] that doesn't make me go to us I saying a
[1:15:07] Pity P party a pride thing poor me
[1:15:10] you're Moses got stuck in that he
[1:15:13] realized he was a complete failure and
[1:15:15] that failure haunted him for 40 years
[1:15:18] and God didn't feel sorry for him that
[1:15:20] he was in that state on the back side of
[1:15:22] the desert you know Moses got into a
[1:15:24] thing Paul me you know I can't speak no
[1:15:27] one will hear me no one will believe me
[1:15:28] me me me me his strength hadn't become
[1:15:32] perfect weakness yet though he had a
[1:15:35] high tempered wife on The Backs side of
[1:15:36] the desert and both him and sapora had
[1:15:39] high tempers and you know God used that
[1:15:41] too God uses the every day to get us
[1:15:42] into
[1:15:43] condition praise God you say man we're
[1:15:46] going through something in your family
[1:15:47] praise God God's getting you in
[1:15:49] condition amen he's wanting to use that
[1:15:52] that perfect strength of his will come
[1:15:54] forth
[1:15:55] it's isn't it amazing God takes us he
[1:15:59] does the opposite to what we think you
[1:16:01] know especially this pampered world we
[1:16:02] live in this this this this um Bubble
[1:16:05] Wrap kind of a world wrap up there's no
[1:16:07] problem everything's fine don't offend

[1:16:11] outside their comfort zone try and just
[1:16:13] keep them all cotton wo wrapped up God
[1:16:16] don't work that way God stirs The Nest
[1:16:19] am mean the eagle stirreth The Nest the
[1:16:21] Bible said chos God God don't you know
[1:16:23] just like an eagle imagine a mama Eagle
[1:16:26] there all powerful big wings and
[1:16:27] everything just just kept her babies in
[1:16:30] the nest like this modern day 2024 kind
[1:16:33] of parenting kind of a world you know so
[1:16:35] careful not to offend and you know so if
[1:16:38] it was that way they'd never leave the
[1:16:39] nest they would never see their built
[1:16:41] just like Mama they would never
[1:16:44] understand the things that they see her
[1:16:45] doing they can do it's within them the
[1:16:48] life within them is the same life as
[1:16:50] within her and they can fly like her
[1:16:52] they can catch pray like her they can
[1:16:54] scream like her they can you know they
[1:16:56] can do exactly like her they can only
[1:16:58] see that when they're
[1:17:00] flying amen and that's why Trouble Comes
[1:17:02] that's why God stirs our Nest is because
[1:17:05] he's getting us in condition that we
[1:17:08] that that we fly like he flies we speak
[1:17:11] like he speaks amen we act like he acts
[1:17:13] just like the babies act like Mama acts
[1:17:15] when they're flying see it's one thing
[1:17:16] to sit there on the nest and say wow
[1:17:18] that's amazing isn't this incredible wow
[1:17:20] the Apostle Paul look at all the things
[1:17:22] he did and everything but God wants to
[1:17:24] just push you out of the nest he wants
[1:17:26] to make your life uncomfortable not that
[1:17:29] you get a pity party in the corner of
[1:17:31] the nest that you leave the nest see we

[1:17:52] tell you there's been Believers down
[1:17:53] Through the Ages had situations million
[1:17:55] times worse than us am mean our first
[1:17:57] world problems we can't complain oh the
[1:18:00] Wi-Fi is too slow oh but the him that
[1:18:03] overcometh know there's crazy stuff like

[1:18:09] you know like they people they think
[1:18:11] it's a

[1:18:16] prison he tells Timothy or Titus
[1:18:18] Winter's coming I need my
[1:18:20] coat and here's a man changed to a Roman
[1:18:23] soldier you know prisons in those days
[1:18:25] did not have under underfloor central
[1:18:28] heating they did not get three meals a
[1:18:31] day there was rats cockroaches damp cold
[1:18:35] dingy they didn't there weren't human
[1:18:38] rights today imagine the Apostle it's my
[1:18:41] human right you got to feed me man that
[1:18:43] would have been the biggest joke that
[1:18:45] went through the whole prison guards
[1:18:46] look at this guy come see him everyone
[1:18:48] it would have been so they would have
[1:18:49] laughed at him but oh but it's my right
[1:18:52] you know no so in his condition
[1:18:55] he got most of the New
[1:18:58] Testament amen his strength God had to
[1:19:01] take his strength away or get him to
[1:19:03] realize no you can't rely on yourself
[1:19:06] and that's and that and that thorn in
[1:19:07] the flesh that buffered him so what did
[1:19:09] it do it had a go him it left it came
[1:19:12] back he besought it three times Lord
[1:19:14] take this thing from me did the Lord
[1:19:17] take it from him they said no my grace
[1:19:19] is sufficient he just praised God in his
[1:19:22] trouble What About Us I'm having a bad
[1:19:26] day things are go I'm not trying to make
[1:19:29] light of problems okay but but but we
[1:19:31] need perspective I mean if if this man
[1:19:34] could be so surrendered to the will of
[1:19:36] God that he had a life of trouble now
[1:19:40] it's worth it Hallelujah but God God had
[1:19:44] him in a condition to prove it doesn't
[1:19:46] matter what's going on in our natural
[1:19:47] surroundings but God could have him a
[1:19:49] spiritual condition that God could
[1:19:51] reveal his mind to this man while
[1:19:54] sitting in prison like basically the
[1:19:56] Lord's saying well I've got more
[1:19:58] Epistles I need more more word released
[1:20:00] to my people so I'm going to put my so

[1:20:10] nope where's he going to go in that
[1:20:12] prison in the inner prison that's where
[1:20:15] he's going to write this this is where
[1:20:16] he's going to dictate this letter to
[1:20:18] someone else this is where he's going to
[1:20:19] receive this
[1:20:20] Revelation he say well that's the
[1:20:22] Apostle Paul I don't receive Revelation
[1:20:24] you better receive Revelation where this
[1:20:26] word lives in your life that it's not
[1:20:28] just ink on paper but it's living in
[1:20:30] your soul amen that it's a reality to
[1:20:32] you amen that that what the Apostle Paul
[1:20:34] wrote about you can say Amen to it
[1:20:36] because you've experienced it because
[1:20:37] it's alive to you it's not a lecture
[1:20:38] it's a living word to you amen so so he
[1:20:41] could he could live in this way because
[1:20:43] of the state he was in he was an
[1:20:47] overcomer amen he say this is a bit
[1:20:49] heavy no this is glorious you think
[1:20:52] about it there's nothing there's no situ
[1:20:54] sitation too bad that God can't reveal
[1:20:57] himself in there's no place too dark no
[1:21:00] tunnel too long no trouble too great
[1:21:02] that God could not step into and Quicken
[1:21:05] his word to my soul to give me
[1:21:07] overcoming power Amen to give me
[1:21:09] strength for the battle to help me to
[1:21:11] walk through this trial praise God
[1:21:13] there's nothing too hard for God he say
[1:21:15] but I'm living under This Cloud just
[1:21:17] open the
[1:21:18] window let Faith come in remember the
[1:21:21] Apostle Paul can you imagine here's a
[1:21:24] man whole life was against God and then
[1:21:27] God had to get him off his high horse of
[1:21:29] Pride put him in the dust of Damascus
[1:21:31] Road he realized what he was and he
[1:21:33] realized what he is now amen and he
[1:21:36] stayed in that state it never left him
[1:21:39] can we not we canot we be the same way
[1:21:43] we have a testimony do we not has not
[1:21:45] God found your life was against God one
[1:21:47] day you're walking the other way amen
[1:21:49] you are working actively against them in
[1:21:52] unbelief but then God found you God
[1:21:54] called you
[1:21:56] hallelujah praise God amen amen and
[1:22:00] that's where God's strength came into
[1:22:02] him because he became perfectly
[1:22:05] weak
[1:22:07] amen
[1:22:09] hallelujah amen praise the
[1:22:13] Lord Amen brother Bram says this he says
[1:22:16] my speech this is why the Apostle Paul
[1:22:17] could come he says my speech wasn't in
[1:22:20] enticing words of man's Wisdom but in
[1:22:22] the demonstration of the spirit of power
[1:22:24] now what what for Paul why' you do this
[1:22:27] power that your faith should not stand
[1:22:28] in the wisdom of men but in the power of
[1:22:31] God oh what a preacher this great man he
[1:22:33] sought God he said God I am weak I don't
[1:22:35] know what to do I pray you God to
[1:22:37] strengthen me take my infirmities take
[1:22:39] away from me these things so I can be
[1:22:41] stronger God spoke back to him said Paul
[1:22:43] my strength is made perfect in your
[1:22:45] weakness then Paul said when I am weak
[1:22:47] then I am strong yes he said then I will
[1:22:49] glory in my infirmities of my weaknesses
[1:22:52] and so forth I'm thanking God that I've
[1:22:54] got all of it out of me so when I see
[1:22:57] everything out of me when I get
[1:22:58] everything out of me then God can come
[1:23:00] in but as long as I've got some of
[1:23:02] myself there then God can't get in I
[1:23:06] mean there that's where we smother him
[1:23:08] out we drive them away from the poorest
[1:23:09] of us to the richest of us from the
[1:23:11] least to the greatest we keep God out of
[1:23:13] our Lives because of our own
[1:23:18] selves amen praise God we don't have to
[1:23:22] stay that way amen that God's strength
[1:23:25] can become perfect in our
[1:23:27] weakness
[1:23:29] amen praise the Lord
[1:23:31] now Moses Moses became perfectly strong
[1:23:36] when he became perfectly weak On The
[1:23:37] Backs side of the desert amen where
[1:23:40] where in his strength he failed but in
[1:23:42] his weakness he triumphed amen same
[1:23:45] thing with all the Believers down
[1:23:46] Through the Ages Amen in their weakness
[1:23:48] they triumphed and their strength they
[1:23:50] failed amen so it's when we when we get
[1:23:53] weak when we realize we can't do it
[1:23:54] that's when God can step in amen that he
[1:23:57] can do what he wants see like but you
[1:23:59] see many times we can look at the
[1:24:01] disappointments of being perfectly weak
[1:24:03] now the now I'm I I'm actually going to
[1:24:05] wind up with this okay I don't I don't I
[1:24:07] don't want to be too long today but it
[1:24:10] says in the Book of James that Elijah
[1:24:11] was a man of like passions as you and I
[1:24:15] right all the Believers see all the
[1:24:17] Believers down Through the Ages they had
[1:24:19] their good times and their bad times
[1:24:21] they had their times of Peace their
[1:24:22] times of trouble their times of Calamity
[1:24:25] they they were human just like you and I
[1:24:27] right if we were transported back to
[1:24:29] Elijah's day we talk to him he said he's
[1:24:31] just like us or all the Believers down
[1:24:34] Through the Ages yep he's just like me
[1:24:36] you know he's just like you because
[1:24:38] because that we they're all men's um
[1:24:41] subject to like passions as we are same
[1:24:43] kind of emotions you know they never
[1:24:45] became
[1:24:46] robots amen they never became robots
[1:24:49] they were they men of like passions just
[1:24:51] like we are right but you see what
[1:24:53] happens is
[1:24:54] is there can be a there can be a a time
[1:24:59] when we are perfectly weak but the
[1:25:01] outcome is not what we expect now Elijah
[1:25:05] he would have he would have you know
[1:25:07] there he goes walking down samaria's
[1:25:10] Road he's going to go see Ahab and
[1:25:11] Jezebel he didn't look like much on the
[1:25:13] outside but a sheep skinn rugged guy
[1:25:16] hairy maybe you know baldheaded yo
[1:25:19] Baldhead glistening in the Sun but in
[1:25:21] his in his little Israelite heart was
[1:25:23] the fire of God burning
[1:25:25] and he walked there into the throne room
[1:25:26] and he and he said to Ahab and to
[1:25:28] Jezebel not not there won't be any rain
[1:25:30] or Jew until I call for it amen then he
[1:25:33] then he went from there you know he's
[1:25:34] fed by the Ravens and he went to the uh
[1:25:37] widow woman there and you know that
[1:25:38] widow woman became perfectly
[1:25:41] weak came perfectly weak but she was
[1:25:44] lining up for a miracle she didn't
[1:25:45] realize it brother said her husband was
[1:25:48] a great man of Faith but then he passed
[1:25:50] away it's just her and her son and and
[1:25:52] and and she went out got two sticks
[1:25:54] she's going to make their last cake and
[1:25:56] then that you know they were going to
[1:25:57] eat it and die a brother said that those
[1:26:00] two sticks symbolize the cross are your
[1:26:02] way of making a fire that lasts a long
[1:26:03] time apparently you get two logs put
[1:26:05] them cross the log like this light the
[1:26:07] fire underneath and just push the ends
[1:26:09] in so there she there she got this she
[1:26:12] was going to have her last meal with her
[1:26:14] son then die you see she came to a
[1:26:17] perfect weakness no one else had food
[1:26:19] she couldn't go to her neighbors the
[1:26:20] supermarket was empty countdown was
[1:26:23] closed pack and saved well that packed
[1:26:25] up a long time ago there was no food
[1:26:26] anywhere right and then so so she she
[1:26:30] realized she was in a state of perfect
[1:26:31] weakness she couldn't rely on her own
[1:26:33] ability whatever but then that was when
[1:26:35] God was going to step in and she was a
[1:26:37] Believer she didn't get angry at the
[1:26:39] prophet when the prophet came into her
[1:26:41] house she didn't say well if you're
[1:26:43] really a man of God why did God allow
[1:26:45] this to happen to me and all this
[1:26:47] problems no she didn't get mad at God
[1:26:49] that's why God sent the prophet her away
[1:26:52] amen and then and then he said well make
[1:26:54] me a cake first total stranger to her
[1:26:57] but make me a cake first but then your
[1:27:00] your your meal barrel barrel won't get
[1:27:02] empty your Cruiser o will never run dry
[1:27:04] Hallelujah she was at a state of perfect
[1:27:06] weakness then God stepped in amen and
[1:27:10] then God is instructed by Elijah to go
[1:27:12] to Ahab challenge him to a showdown so
[1:27:15] then they have Mount Carmel praise God
[1:27:18] the fire falls amen the great Victory is
[1:27:21] won see Elijah was perfectly weak but
[1:27:24] then he was uh in his own self he wasn't
[1:27:26] relying in his own ability to make the
[1:27:29] Fire Fall he was following the
[1:27:30] instructions of the word amen and then
[1:27:33] when he did that he you know you know he
[1:27:34] had the Altar and the and the water
[1:27:35] around it the wood and the sacrifice he
[1:27:38] says Lord I've done all this according
[1:27:39] to your word may all the people know
[1:27:41] that thou are the god in Israel you have
[1:27:42] turned their hearts back again and the
[1:27:44] fire fell amen consume the sacrifice we
[1:27:46] know the story right but and then he
[1:27:49] prayed earnestly that it would rain
[1:27:50] again then finally the seventh time when
[1:27:52] the servant goes up the hill he say see
[1:27:54] like a cloud like a man's hand right and
[1:27:56] then and then Elijah tells
[1:27:58] Ahab get home cuz I hear the sound of
[1:28:01] abundance of rain so he was staying
[1:28:03] perfectly weak the whole time his pride
[1:28:06] didn't Rise Up When God answered by fire
[1:28:07] see I told you look what I did no he
[1:28:10] stayed perfectly weak cuz he knew it was
[1:28:13] God that brought the fire it was God
[1:28:14] that brought the answer and God anointed
[1:28:16] him to outrun The Chariot but then he
[1:28:18] got the threatenings of Queen uh Jezebel
[1:28:21] saying I'm going to kill you so he ran
[1:28:24] for his life and there so so the outcome
[1:28:28] of what happened was probably the
[1:28:30] opposite he did not expect to be running
[1:28:31] for his life he did not expect that this
[1:28:34] this queen would give him a death
[1:28:35] sentence and all these things so he came
[1:28:38] to a juniper
[1:28:40] tree amen and then he begins to pray
[1:28:43] contrary to the will of God for his life
[1:28:45] he says God first he he he conf he gives
[1:28:49] a false testimony of his own own
[1:28:52] salvation he says Lord I'm just like my
[1:28:54] fathers I'm just like them he wasn't
[1:28:56] like his fathers he was living in
[1:28:59] Revival the fire of God that fell on the
[1:29:01] altar was already in him amen the spirit
[1:29:03] of God was leading him he wasn't caught
[1:29:05] up in some dead religious system with
[1:29:06] bow worship all these things no he
[1:29:08] wasn't worshiping in the high places he
[1:29:10] wasn't doing any of those things that
[1:29:11] weren't of God he was walking with God
[1:29:13] so he wasn't like his fathers but he got
[1:29:16] so worked up from the result of this so
[1:29:19] troubled am mean he said he he he was
[1:29:22] giving a bad confession about himself he
[1:29:24] says Lord let me die he was praying
[1:29:28] completely contrary to the will of God
[1:29:29] for his life who's done that let's be
[1:29:32] honest we've all done that well because
[1:29:35] of feelings and just being overwhelmed
[1:29:37] and all these things we get to a place
[1:29:38] where we're praying earnestly I doubt
[1:29:40] very much he sitting there calmly under
[1:29:42] the juniper tree dead God writing in his
[1:29:45] journal about the day he had no he was
[1:29:47] crying out he would have be made a you
[1:29:49] know you know the Dust by his knees
[1:29:50] would been covered in tears crying out
[1:29:52] to God God take my life I you know he
[1:29:54] felt like a complete I'm just like my
[1:29:56] father's La I cannot do this but was but
[1:29:59] he was still perfectly weak but he got
[1:30:01] overwhelmed because of the rejection so
[1:30:04] God placed him under a juniper tree amen
[1:30:07] and God sent his best Angels he saw he
[1:30:10] saw a servant under the juniper tree and
[1:30:13] he you know he called down the the
[1:30:15] cooking aisle of Heaven he got the best
[1:30:17] baker not just a b he didn't get me to
[1:30:20] bake the cakes okay he got the best one
[1:30:22] not that I'm an angel but you know what
[1:30:23] I mean he got the most skilled one who
[1:30:25] knew what they're doing amen get the
[1:30:28] best cakes and then the angel with the
[1:30:30] softest hands that can massage just
[1:30:31] right go down minister to him in his
[1:30:35] perfect weakness he's perfectly strong
[1:30:38] but he just got overwhelmed cuz he's a
[1:30:41] human right so God ministered to him
[1:30:43] under the juniper tree because he was
[1:30:46] walking in perfect
[1:30:48] weakness amen and many times in life we
[1:30:51] get overwhelmed God leads us to do all
[1:30:54] kinds of things and the result is not
[1:30:56] what we
[1:30:59] expect sometimes you think I'm just a
[1:31:01] complete failure no you're not a failure
[1:31:06] cuz you've been walking in perfect
[1:31:07] weakness that God's strength can be
[1:31:10] manifested so you've been doing exactly
[1:31:12] what God told you to do amen God's H God
[1:31:15] wasn't displeased with Elijah under the
[1:31:17] juniper tree he didn't kick him and say
[1:31:19] what are you doing here boy I told you
[1:31:21] to do this why are you crying no he he
[1:31:23] told his best Angels refresh my servant
[1:31:27] he's walking in my word he's made a
[1:31:29] stand for me amen he's overwhelmed
[1:31:32] because I know he's human I made him I
[1:31:35] know he's overwhelmed by this trouble
[1:31:36] you know he's so he feels so hurt by the
[1:31:38] rejection you know he's so he's so upset
[1:31:41] by what just happened though he saw the
[1:31:43] fire he's so thrilled with what I did
[1:31:45] but the people's responses brought him
[1:31:47] to this juniper tree it wasn't my
[1:31:49] response it was the people's response
[1:31:52] that caused them to come to the this
[1:31:54] place but it's all right I'm going to
[1:31:56] I'm going to massage his brow he's going
[1:31:58] to eat these cakes you know I'm going to
[1:32:00] refresh him that he can walk on because
[1:32:03] I'm not done with him I'm not done with
[1:32:05] him he's got work to do in Israel amen
[1:32:08] he's going to anoint Elisha that this
[1:32:11] faith is going to be passed on Amen he's
[1:32:13] going to do all these things and there's
[1:32:15] a
[1:32:15] chariot that's going to carry him home
[1:32:19] amen hallelujah but the reason that
[1:32:21] those things I've already ordained those
[1:32:23] things and I made him that he can walk
[1:32:25] in perfect weakness I made him to be
[1:32:28] this way this is not his ability angels
[1:32:30] I you I want you to understand this is
[1:32:32] not his ambition not his drive he wasn't
[1:32:34] looking for this but I found him and
[1:32:37] before he ever turned up on the earth I
[1:32:39] made him that he could walk in perfect
[1:32:41] weakness aren't you glad God made you
[1:32:43] that way aren't you glad that God made
[1:32:45] you a way that you can not rely on your
[1:32:47] own strength when you come in contact
[1:32:49] with the Eternal with the almighty Lord
[1:32:50] Jesus Christ you realize his strength is
[1:32:53] perfect his strength is all you need
[1:32:56] amen see the see the devil don't want
[1:32:58] you to realize that you can fully depend
[1:33:00] upon the Lord because it's in those
[1:33:02] silent times it's when trouble comes in
[1:33:05] it's those silent times where it looks
[1:33:06] like God is not speaking he's still
[1:33:08] working amen but he's testing you and I
[1:33:11] to see what are we going to rely on in
[1:33:13] those silent times are we going to rely
[1:33:15] on our ability our strength or we're
[1:33:18] going to rely on his
[1:33:20] strength amen so so no doubt he was
[1:33:23] crying he was all worked up and all
[1:33:25] these things and brother Braham asked
[1:33:26] this question now because when a
[1:33:28] showdown comes that's when trouble comes
[1:33:30] after Mount cell was a showdown God
[1:33:33] loves to prove who's
[1:33:35] who right irrespective of irrespective
[1:33:38] of what people do you say Thank You Lord
[1:33:41] amen thank you Lord for showing up it
[1:33:43] wasn't me testify you it wasn't my
[1:33:45] ability amen I remember going to
[1:33:47] someone's house and there was a this is
[1:33:49] years ago christe and I were there and
[1:33:51] you know there was a there was a guy
[1:33:52] trying to trying to over Lord on a young
[1:33:54] well teenage boy trying to basically
[1:33:56] control him and you know try and be the
[1:33:58] father in The Father's Place try and
[1:34:01] perverted and then and then well I was
[1:34:03] there so I just opened my big mouth and
[1:34:05] we started to share about no you got to
[1:34:07] because this person was trapped into
[1:34:09] doing something then then this man was
[1:34:11] trying to tell the parents what the son
[1:34:13] had done but not in order that that that
[1:34:15] the son would be sorry and there'd be
[1:34:17] healing and repentance and prayer and so
[1:34:18] on but that this man would have control
[1:34:20] over this boy that was the whole purpose
[1:34:22] of it so we went in there we just say
[1:34:24] well you just got to surrender to God
[1:34:25] just let God do you know you know you
[1:34:27] got to give your life to the Lord you
[1:34:28] don't need to surrender to a person
[1:34:29] surrender to him amen cuz that's what we
[1:34:32] got to do we don't surrender to one
[1:34:33] another I mean you don't give your life
[1:34:35] to me that's the craziest foolish thing
[1:34:37] you could ever do in your life give your
[1:34:38] life to the Lord Jesus Christ amen but
[1:34:40] this man was trying to get this boy to
[1:34:41] do that to him and so we started to talk
[1:34:44] just just say just no give your life to
[1:34:45] the Lord he'll give you the Holy Ghost
[1:34:47] he'll change you he can help you through
[1:34:48] these things right and then and then the
[1:34:50] father go said okay we're all going to
[1:34:52] pray and we started praying and the
[1:34:54] father prayed and it was like a being he
[1:34:58] stepped in the Lord stepped in the
[1:34:59] atmosphere just changed it's like he
[1:35:02] literally joined the circle you feel him
[1:35:04] right there and then the tongue's
[1:35:06] interpretation came God backed up just
[1:35:09] give your life to me I'll give you the
[1:35:10] Holy
[1:35:11] Ghost now the man who was doing that
[1:35:14] thing he he actually just fled the scene
[1:35:16] felt very uncomfortable the spirit was
[1:35:17] very uncomfortable
[1:35:19] now the people after that it was like
[1:35:22] Mount camel they weren't
[1:35:24] rejoicing there was a big backlash
[1:35:27] against those
[1:35:28] things yeah these things happen well you
[1:35:32] just doing what you feel the Lord wants
[1:35:33] you to do and there's just this big
[1:35:35] backlash against it by so-called
[1:35:37] Christians you say well why is this you
[1:35:40] know this doesn't seem right but then
[1:35:41] you find yourself well now you're just
[1:35:43] actually under a juniper tree you say
[1:35:45] well was it worth it it's always worth
[1:35:48] it following
[1:35:49] God the Apostle Paul said I have a Crown
[1:35:52] of Life For Me he say where did where
[1:35:54] did this where did this
[1:35:56] Faith end him up where did he end up
[1:35:58] with this faith in a prison with a death
[1:36:00] sentence oh was that worth it it's
[1:36:02] absolutely would I do it again 100% cuz
[1:36:06] he said it was revealed to him in those
[1:36:08] troubles I've got a crown of life
[1:36:10] waiting for me and not me only but all
[1:36:12] those that love his glorious appearing
[1:36:14] amen so his perfect weakness revealed to
[1:36:17] him that perfect strength that he's got
[1:36:18] a crown and a body Hallelujah
[1:36:22] everything's Over Yonder waiting for him
[1:36:23] so he had he had the blessings of God in
[1:36:25] this life but it wasn't just that was
[1:36:27] just a down payment that's just a small
[1:36:29] thing compared to what he had on the
[1:36:31] other side so we can end up in a juniper
[1:36:34] tree I'm just going to finish with a
[1:36:35] juniper tree but just remember you say
[1:36:38] Lord I was following you you proved
[1:36:40] yourself why is this I feel so
[1:36:43] overwhelmed and then and then what does
[1:36:45] he do angels yeah Angel remember you Bak
[1:36:49] the cake for Elijah there's another
[1:36:51] servant of mine on the earth with the
[1:36:53] same fath the fire of God's burning in

[1:37:13] chariot waiting for them as well amen

[1:37:16] Earth amen well they they're hurting
[1:37:20] they're overwhelmed little can't you see
[1:37:21] yeah I can see but my strength is made

[1:37:26] sufficient for them I'm going to reveal
