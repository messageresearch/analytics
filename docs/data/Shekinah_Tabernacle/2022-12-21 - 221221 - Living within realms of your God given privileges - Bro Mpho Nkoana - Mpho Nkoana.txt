descend from the line of king and i will reign for eternity with jesus christ jesus christ hallelujah amen do you believe that do you believe that it says every giant that you face you'll defeat every not some of them every i feel that song was so inspired that if you're ever down and the devil is just haunting you and taunting you and laughing in your face go sing that song you want to see him be tormented go sing that song i'm not a big fan of the devil though that's you know good was walking and i was sure he was singing this song before isaac got it i'm pretty much sure because all he was saying is if there's a giant i'll just cut his head off right if there's a mountain we'll move it but i'm getting my promised land our man was on a mission under a commission in a mission all right amen let's sing victory in jesus i think that's in the key of it [Music] how he gave his life on calvary to save the rich like me and i heard about his growing of his precious [Applause] [Music] victory oh victory in jesus my savior forever how he sought me and he bought and he loved me [Music] and he plunged me into victory beneath [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and somehow jesus came and bought to me the victory oh victory in jesus my savior forever and how [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and all my love is doing and he plunged me into victory the king just cleans it up and i heard about that he mentioned built for me in glory and i heard about the streets of gold beyond the crystal sea [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen [Applause] [Music] and he bought [Music] into victory beneath the clear let's sing it one more time and no victory in jesus oh my savior forever [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen [Music] he did it all nothing we did he did it all so just rest and you'll do it all and you'll do it over and over and over again because when he said he bought you with his blood it was a finished thing just rest god bless you david good to see you so my favorite song my granddad used to sing this song and i thought it's just fitting to finish with this one as we get ready for brother memphis to come up can you put that song up when the role is called up yonder i'll be there do you believe it so take it amen it says the violent takes it by force we're not here to play games can we have that chorus oh when the roar [Music] is [Music] [Music] shall be no and the morning breaks eternal bright and fearless [Music] [Applause] [Music] and that roll is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] you'll be there and on that bright and cloud this morning when the dead of christ shall rise and the glory of his resurrection [Music] and with his chosen one

he's coming to fetch us hallelujah amen let's just be reverent in the presence of the lord these songs are true and these songs are amen hallelujah amen i just want us to just to to pray our heavenly father lord jesus we thank you as we stand in your presence tonight father we realize that we we are not capable we realize father that we are not able to do anything for ourselves we understand father by the reading of your word and the revelation of your way that you did it all father and that is why tonight lord we come here father unqualified but we come through the man who qualified at the cross of calvary we are so thankful father to be identified with you we are so thankful tonight father to be called sons and daughters of the most high god we are so thankful father because many are called but father few are chosen and lord god we are so thankful tonight to be called the chosen ones of the most high god father god in the same breath we approach your throne tonight we say lord forgive us our wrongs where we have led you down and have disappointed you father may you have mercy upon us david of all he said lord your mercy is from everlasting to everlasting he said your grace endured forever he said it is better for me to be in the hands of the lord than to be in the hands of the sinners for i know that when i am in the presence of the lord there is miss amen lord we love you we appreciate you for what you have done thank you for the songs of zion that we could sing for you lord to prepare our hearts to prepare our understanding to prepare father god the atmosphere for your weight lord come and bless your people father come and just provide like that eagle and it comes with food fresh in the nest and and they give each and every child on their peak and feeds them father come and do the same with us tonight is our desire we are waiting upon the lord and we expect him from you father but we ask these things in the name of our lord jesus christ amen before the musicians can see it there's a song also that that that the lord laid on my heart that we can sing and i'm not sure if we can sing it in that tune he says he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised do we have that one let's sing it in a slow pace reverently maybe even closing your eyes have you ever sung and well while your eyes are closed and just cruising in the presence of the lord have you ever done that just thinking about you and the lord and what you are saying like brother armand was saying think about those words because they are true the song the name the words in the song amen he was [Music] for wounded transgressions oh he was bruised oh for my [Music] [Music] oh [Music] he was wounded [Music] [Music] he was bruised [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's sing it one more time he was wounded [Music] [Music] oh [Music] thank you for taking the pain for us tonight thank you so much heavenly father amen amen brother armand has already welcomed you i really welcome you in the presence of the lord tonight and thank you for putting my volume high because my voice is not so good brother phil i mean brother hey pradharman thank you so much you and the musicians the lord bless you now you can have your sis and leave me here all alone i once again greet you in the name of our lord jesus christ and i believe that you come expecting tonight i believe that you are you didn't come here to come and listen to brother paul because if you are coming to listen to bradampo tonight i want to tell you that you will be disappointed if you have come to listen to me tonight you you will be let down i mean but tonight me and you have come to listen to our lord our husband our lord jesus christ remember i told you that all of us can sit down and he can use this mic and speak to you and communicate with you he can raise take this chair and talk to you so i am a non-issue here right i'm just like a speaker that we are using that speaker that you you you you you see here it it cannot talk by itself that speaker cannot pronounce anything it only amplifies what that that which goes through the channel which is the mic and then goes through the system and then the brothers put the volume up and then you think the speaker is talking it's not the speaker it is there's a speaker behind the speaker huh there's there's a speaker and there's a speaker so tonight i'm just that speaker dead without the real speaker behind amen so uh i was so blessed by the service sunday my brother ben i was so blessed man i wish i could just cancel and you take or continue because you know that that that that peace that you you spoke about really sits at the core of my heart you know i i don't know if how many of you remembers the same one the little someone we heard some few weeks ago where we spoke about will you marry me and we were trying to talk about that lady and i can see him i spent a considerable amount of time uh thinking about heaven how heaven will look like i spent some time and and i've got different versions you know you know the mind so and tonight we're going to speak about you know living within the realms of your god-given privileges living within the realms of your god-given privileges and and and we want to to identify a few things there is quite a lot it's quite a big salmon but we just want to identify one or two aspects you know that will actually help us because they are at a pivot they are at the center of actually not being out of the border of your privileges amen amen i want to try to speak slow as much as possible i've learned that i speak fast and many people can't hear my ways and and and so i will try to take it slowly and then but tonight is going to be a short salmon it's going to be uh you know you know when we eat then afterwards we have a a dessert or a snack but tonight we're a sharp snack you know a nice one yeah because the food when you approach it it depends on how you approach that food some are saying wow lovely food some says ah no because you didn't approach it right that food is nice just approach it right amen and let's stand and read the word of god yeah i was so blessed by the season the issue of the season you know and it reminded me of that um we're going to read from john chapter 3 we'll read from john chapter 3 we know the scripture and tonight i'm not going to bring you new things i'm just going to encourage you to motivate you to lift you up and it's like there was a woman in the uk who was very rich and she she she was she was dying and she didn't know what to do with her money so one day she just went to the bank and withdrew her cash she threw her cash and he just walked in town and just throw it to the people give it to the people and she was arrested can you imagine but the issue is not that she was arrested the issue is if you were in that vicinity at that time what were you going to do i'm telling you some of us will come out there bleeding on our hands you know and i was going to look for those specific colors of those notes which colors i wouldn't just pick any i'll pick specific ones so some of us will be pushing and fighting brothers so it is tonight where the lord the word of god is going out huh what are you doing about it imagine that woman just buntles like this you know when money is new yeah this one that is maybe a hundred or a thousand notes but it's just like this with a little rubber band what will you do but what is being given tonight what the lord is giving you tonight is a trillion times more wealth more valuable than what that woman did what are you doing about it are you grabbing ah are you pushing no no this one is mine on your smile what are you doing about it let's read john chapter 3 then we can sit down because we've got a few scriptures to read and the bible says in john chapter 3 verse 16. it says for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever delivered in him should not perish but have everlasting life let's pray together heavenly father we thank you once more the prophet taught us master that we can eat too much we can sing too much we can walk too much we can eat too much but there's one thing that we'll never do too much and that is to pray father and i pray my father god that you'll come and just anoint your weight lord may you inspire it so much so father god that by the time we leave here lord jesus christ there are answers to the questions that by the time we leave the service of the lord tonight there is healing that by the time we leave tonight lord jesus christ that there is prophetic words that has been prophesied lord and interpreted lord by the time we leave him help us father bring us in the circle of the holy spirit but that by the time we leave here my lord surely we shall never be the same again help us master take our hearts lord take them lord and the lord just murder them take our hearts lord jesus christ tonight lord and just capture them imprison them lord that by the time we leave here lord jesus we are captured lord god by your presence it's our desire tonight lord we don't want to live here the same we don't want to live here with the same thoughts we don't want to live here with the same attitude but lord if our attitude was good when we came here we want to live here with a much more improved and a better attitude lord god we want to live here with more of you tonight that is our expectation lord that is our desire i pray for everyone i pray for every heart lord some are not here that at home maybe some are at work lord may you bless our people father in the families in their homes lord may you be with each one and anyone across the face of the slope who is joining in with us lord maybe on youtube maybe on zoom may you bless them may the presence of the lord lord move through and also bless them the anointing of the holy spirit which is not limited by the airwaves it's not limited by data it's not limited by reception it's not limited by internet we pray father god that you'll also bless them in the name of our lord jesus christ we commit the service in your hands father amen god bless you you may enjoy your seats and uh i said tonight we are going to talk about living within the realms of your god-given privileges living within not without living inside the boundaries of your god-given privileges god-given then you know let's let's just unpack that weight privilege can we unpack that with privilege then we can we can we can read other scriptures like matthew i will read three more scriptures a privilege what is a privilege i didn't go to dr google i didn't go there i don't have an explanation for google and i didn't go to the dictionary i just want to say it not the way we know we've got a context of with privilege and the word also have got their own explanation but you see a privilege in my view a privilege is something that you don't buy yeah right you don't qualify or make an effort for a privilege a privilege is something that is given to you for free what are you qualified for it or not sorry brother you just happen to be in the front i'm preaching to everyone so it is a privilege a privilege is given to you it is a is something that not everybody receives but you you you you know when a child is born in the home that and the father sorry i always give whatever is there at home well the parents that that child has a privilege to be part of that family it's a privilege there's another child there fool i'm sorry to say this but the bible did say that child took the parents to court in india i think somebody said it here and wants to sue the parents for bringing him or her to earth what a wasted privilege what a wasted privilege because to be born in the family which you are born is a privilege if the only thing is just depends on how you look at it are we together so a privilege a boy who asked his father that he wants his riches and all everything of his share he wants to live he thought he was collecting all the privileges because he was measuring privileges according to money according to the things that he can see he did not realize that there was there's a blessing if you listen in the bible if you check jacob abraham david solomon all those patriarchs they i i've never seen that you know they were writing a will and say okay you are going to get this this piece of land and no no every time i hear them the bible says when they are about to die david called solomon and then he says i'm about to die and he blessed him isaac did the same and he says come because i'm going to my father now i'm going home now i'm going to bless those are the privileges i'm talking about those are the ones i'm talking about the privileges that you don't buy the ones that we can see with our eyes those are not eternal privileges so i'm talking about your eternal god-given privilege a privilege to be a daughter and a son of god right that is a privilege and then that privilege has got certain benefits a privilege that's called satan excuse me it has got uh things that comes with it yes it's the hannah it has things certain things come with privileges then the the the if you go there to parliament you'll find that they even have a committee a committee of privileges that committee is to assess and evaluate the privileges that the member of the members of parliament's health but then they look at it in terms of benefits and perks how would you say it in the accent perks you know benefits they look at it that way but we don't look at privileges that way so that committee will say what the prime minister will have these privileges bodyguards this this this a house like this a house of this standard a car of this standard huh and then you'll have and also even the spouse of the prime minister will have benefits privileges they have a commit in cabinet a committee that establishes those privileges but think about your committee in heaven think about your committee in heaven the committee of privilege is in heaven that allocates your privileges and they give them to you right so those privileges you and me are supposed to live within those privileges we are supposed to exercise them we are supposed to use them because if we don't then we are under privileging ourselves all right hold it a bit eh hold it there let's read um let's read uh i said we're going to read a few scriptures let's read matthew 22 we all know it also do we all know it matthew 22 we you know matthew 22. can you please with me do you you know matthew 22. amen that one he talks about and uh the greatest commandment amen so within this uh uh living within your privileges i want us to identify two things two things the first one is uh you know the love of god first yeah the love of god first put in the love of god first and this is why this matthew 22 comes into the picture right then from there we will talk about after the love of god first we'll talk about the prayerfulness test those two tonight just to to show you that if you if if if you are underprivileged or you are living below your privilege you tend to neglect those two things right right let's read matthew it says matthew 22 i said this let's start from verse 37 the bible says uh they were asking jesus some questions they were they were cross-questioning him and they said hey jesus what is the greatest commandment and you know they find that they always keep questioning because they are testing him and jesus said unto them unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart you see and with all thy soul and with all thy mind with all your mind your soul right all your being thou shalt love the lord your god that's the first one if you wake up if you sleep whatever you do thou shalt love the lord your god with all so what what is loving god what is it what is loving god we'll talk about that now right so jesus answered and let's let's go to verse 38 then this is the first and greatest commandment this one of loving the lord your god right and then verse 39 and the second the second one is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy self practically speaking according to the laws of satan's eden there's no way you can love someone like yours you love yourself can i can i demonstrate that to you if me and brother ben are sitting here now and then something happens on that side huh something that is so harming that wants to harm me and him the instinct is going to he's not going to try to protect me he's going to try first to protect himself but the bible says he must love himself like he loves me so why is he not protecting us why when a driver drives a car and then there's an accident always they say the safest seat is behind the driver because the driver instinct by instinct will try to you know to dodge the danger for his skin so but the balance is the second important rule love your love your neighbor as thyself can you see that is now not according to the laws of that is the privilege of heaven to love my brother and my sister like myself not just as a talk in reality the real thing which you can do i always say you know the truth is always when you are alone you see when you are alone the truth always has got no way to hide because you are just you and god the truth comes so that person you must love him or her even when you are alone you can confess it to the lord and say i love my brother like myself i'll i'll die for him that's too strong not too strong okay now jesus christ told them to love your neighbor thou shalt love thy neighbor as their self we live with that one let's go to romans remember the emphasis on that chapter is love and there's no way you can be able to do that if the love of god is not in you and that's the point i want to show you that in order for you to do that the love of god comes first for me to be able to to do that to life unconditionally is when i love god with all my heart my soul and my mind then i'll be able to say ah but isaac i don't have to tell you i love you with everything within me not to please him when i see him i say oh i haven't seen no no no for real when whether i see him or i don't see him amen that's the reality that i'm talking about only if you love god let's look at it from the perspective of romans chapter 8. romans chapter 8 what does he say i also love it i also love romans chapter 8. let's take it from verse 35 and i'll try to be quick the children can you hear me say amen my children you can hear me praise the lord right romans 8 35 i'll take it from okay let's take it from 34 who is the who is he that commandeth it is christ who died yeah rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also make it intercession for us right now i like to read this scripture the bible says best 85 who who who shall separate us from the love of christ who what where how any of those things can separate you from the love of god what can okay shall tribulation or distress or persecution or faith or famine or nakedness or peril or sort the list goes on it's inexhaustible the least is inexhaustive you can't finish it nothing can separate you and me from the love of god why because it it was god first and the bible says god is love god by his love by his word him because remember okay let's go back to genesis in genesis the bible says god created all these things by his word right plus the logos and then the prophet dramatizes it and then as the son of man playing them trillions and trillions of years ago and then from there he said okay let there be logos and there was logos and then he started to create and then they're spinning and they said stop and then they stop and then that planet was there from brother i was like one time drama testing and then and then and then then then the lord was the wow the lord said wow today we say wow the lord loved it the lord loved his creation can you hear that he loved it god is love that is why on top of the pyramid we've got love i made a statement here one time and i said i suspect that at the bottom of the pyramid below faith there is also love you know have you ever put a sandwich together huh it's love love love at the beginning love at the end in fact love before the beginning right so what can separate us right as it is written for that i say we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us you see i always want to underline the word love where i come across it because god is love and then in this in his love he chose you he chose you and he chose me listen to this that means you are part and parcel of god's love that means you if god is love and you are the bride of god you are loved so it's impossible therefore for any one of us not to love for real because you are love love does not love loves love covers a multitude of sin love love protects love forgives love do all those things love creates love embraces have you ever ever i'm just like brother ben says he's going everywhere i'm also going everywhere have you ever had a young man or a young woman and saying hey oh i love him so much or i love her so much you know she she's everything to me have you ever had that statement did anyone ever heard that oh i love my boy you know i love my son he's everything to me how can you say that that is true because jesus christ loves us we mean everything to him we mean everything to him so just just pause and think about it we are everything to him what are we who are we can you see now that takes you deep on the center of your god-given privilege because there's no way anyway someone can love you like that and you live outside of the boundary of the privilege you live below your privilege huh you and the bible says we must not be like the world and even the very appearance of the world we must shy away from it right we must be away from the things of the world and the very appearance that means that not even as aspect of the worldly appearance we should be closer to it because it takes us away from our privileges so if someone says i love him so much he means everything to me or he is everything to me she is everything to me he is my world you've had this statement before please let's be realistic you've had it he's my world you know i love him so much that's my wife now he's my he's my world yeah you've heard this kind of statement you've had it sister it's not the first time you've had it yeah little children you love mama and daddy so much they mean everything to me mom and dad and that's how the lord jesus christ looks at you that's how me and you should look at him on a daily basis right so let's come back to that point of the scripture of the one i was reading of romans did i finish it he says for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels no principalities no powers no things present no things to come this is so serious a statement because paul is trying to over emphasize to emphasize that nothing nothing absolutely zero not in this world not outside this world not angels he says here no angels no principalities will separate me from the love of god that is what the prophet said you know even if he throws me in hell i will still love you this is this is a powerful statement that many times we think we understand it he says if he throws me in anywhere i'll still love him does that make common sense no but that that makes holy sense it's a holy sense that one that he can throw me there but i still love him because god is the fountain of love and that's where things begin that's where things start let's hear from matthew 24 this is the last scripture then we finish our same one meteor 24 i wrote it here if i'm not reading it correctly just say sorry brother and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold remember i spoke about satan's eating now we are living in satan's eating the devil wants to works called our love for god and for one another and he there he knows if he's doing that he's pulling us out of our privileges he's pulling us out of our day god given privileges and the devil gets you so well and so easy if you're living outside the realms of your privilege let's talk about that boy who left his home didn't the devil get him did not the devil get him he first finished his money and then he got him to eat with pigs that's what happens when you move away from the realms of your privileges now because this is laodicea the spirit is so subtle it's almost like when serpent came to the garden of eden he was so subtle he was so innocent he was so like anyone who could reason who said no no no come on this is a nice guy what are you taking him for if anyone could have said that meanwhile god created all the animals male and female i was telling brother ben i said you know after god created all males and females the serpent was also an upright animal the prophet taught us that he was an upright animal and working and and reasoning talking that's why he could when he could go there to eve and speak to eve and reason with if you are so subtle he was the reason showing her he was speaking more sense than if her husband he was so subtle and he made sense and then these days that we are living in we are living in those subtle days the devil is not gonna come and say uh you know like in the dark ages or in the in the days of when rome was making people pay money i mean in today's world really people will say come on really now that's what today they will say you want to make me pay for my sins really now that's how we will talk today because it doesn't make sense because those are the dark ages that today we are living in the apex of satan's idiot he doesn't come like that and say brother for you you must pay first before you can be forgiven no today he comes so subtle so subtle that the enemy can come in here if we are not aware and we are not aware of him and he sits here with us and then he spends time with us and we are not realizing that hey this spirit we must cast it out but hey the devil can come in your life let's forget about church a bit he can come in your life and every day you say every day and every hour and you come to church but the devil has encroached and he's going to hold on certain things that you can let go you are living below the privilege are you not you are because the bible says search yourself do an introspection don't be afraid to look into your life and say god open me remind me lord show me the things that i don't know about myself ah brother ended up to preach about the subconscious you know you can you can stop unconsciously disbelieve god unconsciously not intentionally not on papers but just because you move away from your privilege lying and you unconsciously unaware at my work one time the previous week they taught us about unconscious bias unconscious biasedness where someone just treat you and but in a bias way and away not on papers so that thing happens so let us not unconsciously live below our privileges and the only thing that is going to help us if we get more exposed and closer in the center of this pivot called the love of god putting him first with everything amen that is what will help us that is what will actually make our love not to works cold there's no way i'm gonna say brother ben i love you so much my friend i'll i can even give you my car but i don't love god what kind what kind of love is that one it's true i must love him but do i did i put god first because the first commandment is to love god with all my heart and all my soul are we together saints now when we talk about love and we are now into that first aspect the first point of putting god first loving god unconditionally with those everything within me right now when you talk about love you see when you talk about love you talk about a a decision i like to believe that love goes together with a decision there's no way i can love without making a decision huh there's a decision when you talk about love you hear about a decision i make my mind i make up my mind to take god's way for the rest of my life you made up your mind so when you talk about love we talk about sacrifice you hear those things there's no way you can talk about love without talking about sacrifice didn't he die at the cross because he loved us didn't he go and sacrifice there can you love your brother and your sister but not sacrifice for him so carry thy cross and follow me that is sacrifice are we together when we talk about love we talk about commitment do you children understand what is commitment what is to commit to commit is to it's almost like to bind yourself for the camera income sanction yes my goal what is commitment to to give everything to say here it was him who preached the same one here he said today draw a line here i'm not going that way i'm making a commitment devil i'm not going to cross this line no not today so commitment is about that and when we talk we hear about love it was a great commitment that the lord did to leave heaven come here to earth to come and be crucified for me and for you that's why i wanted us to sing that song at the beginning when we talk about love we talk of action there's no love there's no love if there's no action i love you every day i love you honey but you never buy me a flower ah come on foreign flavanana they're from levine yes that's for you so not necessarily a flaw i'm just giving example because he's my friend but i mean love without action have you seen it so all these things that i'm counting you can think of the lord jesus christ he did them he did all these things and you are the bride of the lord that means there are certain things that we need to do yes we are the bride remember it's not this way it's this way let me explain to you it's not that you are a son and a daughter of god therefore is automatic you'll go in regardless no no it is because of the what the way you do things and you live the the life and the weight of the lord that actually shows that you are a son and a daughter of god it it actually proves that you are a son and a daughter the way you do things the way you sacrifice the way you live within your privileges god given ones we say oh remember there was a story in the bible that says i can't recall very well but oh yeah after they crucified the lord jesus christ after they crucified him they said there was earthquakes and things like that and they say they started to say oh they said truly surely he was the son of god remember surely so when we walk on earth brother arnold here people should say no surely there's something about that man in the train people must say you know people must see the love of god in your daily life they must feel it they must want to be next to you because you are admitting it you know there's some atmosphere around you the prophet says here oh yes i wanted to say there's attachment also you know there's attachment you know no no there's when you are attached to something the lord attached himself to us he said i cannot this is the apple of my eye he had faith in you the lord who created you remember the lord knows you more than you know yourself and he created you and he knows all the ingredients in you he knows the qualities in you he knows your character you're a real one he knows your personality he knows everything and then he's saying to you i've got faith in you and confidence and then you don't want to have confidence in yourself ah have confidence in the word of god because when you are the word of god you are part of the love of christ then you are going to find not having confidence in yourself in a proud way in the in the love of god because in there you are there in that pot that's where you are and that's where your confidence is then you can do this thank you lord that i'm your son and i'm your i'm your daughter and people say hey you know you know you know if you can stand in the train and say i greet you people today i want to tell you about what the lord has done for me and i love you he loves me so much they are going to say so he didn't love us people would say but didn't he love us they want to say ah tell us about that love no they say no didn't he love us if he loved you didn't he love us that's the mentality the devil always wants to put things upside down so now now you'll be trying to tell them what god has done for you and what he can do for them you will be trying to tell them to bring them within the realms of their privileges god-given privileges let me read for you a few things here then we can close and what the prophet said here now he says the prophet in the message love he says now this is very nice he says now do you do you hear are you enjoying the golden nuggets are you enjoying the disease he says now do you realize do you realize being a son or a daughter the father did not put their sisters out sister sister he talked about daughters as well do you realize being a son or daughter of god that you you sorry for pointing at you you you are a minor creator do you know that do you know that you are a creator you are an amateur god can i hear amen because it is true that's what you are that's who you are you are an amateur god you are a minor creator you can create oh they said i must not call the tea i i can't help it someone said we mustn't call it he must say creda sorry i don't i don't mean to joke just but you can hear me you are my people you can hear me hopefully on youtube and hear me you are a creator a minor creator you can create because why what makes you a creator because you are part of god so that's why i'm emphasizing that as a child of god beware of living beyond your privilege you are a creator once you are on that pivot you know a pivot brother is that a thing that they use a pivot line that they use to spray for vegetables in the big farms you know they put a pivot it goes around it's called the pivot sprayer it's got the people then it can go around you know it does not lose the light it's on the pivot so it can go all around those little wheels they don't lose it's pivoted so once we get pivoted in the center on the pivot of the lap of god that's when you realize that hey that's why the lord jesus christ could not say hey rise up he had to specify lazarus that's why brother branham when he was this is the haiti right huh she could have got anything it is true she would have got anything tonight my brother my sister you can get anything just be pivoted just be within the boundary you know when we said boundary we said this is the boundary this is where your privileges are around this white board and then we find you here how do we expect to get the benefits or here no we can't so our daily life is to ensure that we love god so much and that is what is going because god is on the center he's on the center of this thing that we are talking about of our privileges of our benefits of our safety of our redemption of our eternal life of our everything he's on the center and that's where we must be to love him so much because once we are there they say the rest is history the rest is history you can name anything you can you can think of anything you what are you talking about when you are on the center when you are pivoted your privileges everything is autopiloted everything is automated do you know you can create at the atmosphere that you live in you that's the prophet here in the spoken word called love 5607-26 you do you know you crea you do you know you create the atmosphere that you live in we create atmospheres but which ones yes are we great what atmospheres are we creating because we've got the the power we have been given a privilege to be able to create the right atmosphere one day the pastor said a statement and i never forget he said atmosphere is everything oh yes atmosphere me and you have got the power to create the atmosphere that we live in right do you realize that the atmosphere that you dwell in you influence somebody else i can't emphasize on it loving the unlovable unblocks god's love loving what nobody may want to love written offs have you ever heard of the people called written ops loving those ones the lord loved those ones he was associated with those ones he was found among them eating with them the people that today me and you will say oh no just give them food let them go just give them food let them go they're just you know and then no no him he said let them come in he put he that's why that man martin he cut his jacket and shared with that man on the street because he loved the unlovable now when you are on the pivoted love of god that's the kind of things that you do you do things that nobody understands because you are an odd ball now listen to this one let me throw let me just throw this one in now in state in instead of well i'm sick i'm i was scared sure but when i looked at him something began to happen instead of thinking oh if i was a big enough i would whip you instead of that i god of thinking poor brother the devil's got him pound why why did the devil get involved he'll want to love me as much as i love him right he can't help being like that the prophet was talking about someone someone else who who was who was upset with him huh and that's that's not him kissing me that's the devil that is with any man is not the man that is kissing you that you want to be get to have to get angry with and kill him in a few minutes no it is the devil making him to do that not your brother is the devil he is possessed with that's what the prophet says here now that one is the one you must love the one who will say i'll did anyone ever did that to you so that one is the one that you must look at him differently and and love him because the prophet and the word taught us that love is a powerful force it's so powerful and they will talk about the power the force of love because it quenches anything you can think of they say water is the hardest surface no it's not love a christian loves the lord and he loves him with in such a way that there is nothing can separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus paul said neither death nor sorrow neither perils or prisoners or anything can separate us from the love of god that's in jesus christ oh my and real true the prophet is just re-emphasizing what i was saying in the message near the church age he said you just just keep loving i don't care how much people hate you you love them anyhow because you've realized something you have realized something something has been revealed to you that if i do that i'm within my privileges i get what i want i get my benefits i get my relationship with my savior is everything is at its best when i do that when i love the lord so don't allow no one to take you out of your privileges by making you bitter but no no no no no no that's for them not for you that's for them you rather pray for them for because it's not them amen let's leave that one because any root of bitterness is the devil and a believer must be able to know that oh a root of bitterness is imaging how am i supposed to react to my brother or my sister how you you many times we try to help others even the bible says as i'm trying to help you i fall because maybe you're heavy for me the bible says beware be careful that when you are trying to help your brother that you fall on the same because in my behavior i might be trying to lift up brother phil and a car and i follow i fall on him so therefore when i lift him up i must make sure that i'm standing right properly oh call brother ben to come help me he lift him because you see otherwise sorry brother just using that's a physical example otherwise we fall on that spot where he is so be careful don't allow anything to obscure you amen only if you are within the love if you love god so much you'll know that him have you ever watched that film called the passion of christ have you watched it it's one of those that is so moving so so moving that you know you see you can imagine that what they did to him spitting and whipping him until you know they were whipping him with a whip which has got some spikes that when they hit him when he they pull it it removes flesh and you see the bones why did he choose to do that they whip him so much when he finishes there he look at them he says lord forgive them for they don't know what they are doing that just makes you cry you know to to go through that and then someone where do you find the courage he was supposed to be focusing on himself saying oh lord just help me to sustain this pain please no he didn't instead he says oh just forgive the poor souls and they were eating so hard you know when they were hitting him they the blood is spat on them and they wipe and they saw soldiers they were inspired by that evil devil and they were hitting him so much why did they do that i mean why did he agree to go into that because of me and you because of me he loved us so much he one we are so much part of him that he'll he's gonna is creating another world a new dispensation a new civilization for you and me don't you realize that is too much love that is a lot of love so nothing should separate you from that love and then because when you are in there in that love you are sorted all is sorted so don't allow no nothing to disturb you let's talk about prayerfulness and then we close i think we've talked we're spoken we'll never talk enough about love it is such a powerful force now we find one place there where the son of god spends so much time in prayer and if jesus had to spend much time in prayer to stay in fellowship in with spirit that was in him in other words if jesus had to pray so much so much spending so much time in prayer he says here how much more do you and i have to spend in prayer this is the challenge to me to me we sing a song isn't it he says it's me not my brother not my sister let's not only sing it when we want blessings it's me oh lord who wants the healing who wants the blessings yes but also it's me who wants correction amen it's me who wants to be reminded here that lord is brother who must spend time in prayer so that when he comes here to preach he must be inspired he must be taught of god to say the things that god wants he must have repented from his sin before god and put himself aside when we come to church we need to put ourselves aside not just the minister and us the the people who are sitting down to set ourselves aside to pray for the service we don't have to be going in the closet at that special time no no while you are working while you're walking while you are thinking praying say oh tonight lord won't you help that brother he's got weaknesses i know but won't you help him lord just use him even if he's just one weight load i'm asking father god you know just talking to the lord as you go along having time to think to bring yourself closer and closer to the atmosphere healing of jared's daughter get away from this old lukewarm halfway say a little prayer of of a morning a little prayer at night and then go go to bed and get up the next morning no no no he says get away from that kind of a prayer this is hard you need to pray morning evenings the best time and everybody says no no get away no wonder we are getting wealthy no wonder the world creep into the church because we don't stay in prayer we don't brother and we don't god help us there's no more organizing there's no more staying before god there's no more digging out cleaning up i salute the young people join them if you can every monday here half past seven to pray let's support them it is the secret prayer that jesus spoke of this is in the message 570301 and it is the secret prayer that jesus spoke of saying anti-ye into a secret closet and close the door and when you have had its soul pray to your father who sees in secret and he that seeth in secret shall reward you openly there seems to be something to to the prayer that takes all the hypocrisy out of it it seems like that we get in a better connection with god when we do that kind of a prayer and i've experienced it when you take the time and you are alone not tell us that they don't call me i'm now in prayer no no no don't whatsapp us take time go in the closet and pray it's easier it seems like that we get in a better connection with god to get alone you know there's something about getting alone to yourself how many are going to do that how many are going to do that i'm not looking at you the lord is looking in the message that was pretty 52024 christ gave us the authority with his name by being christians it is a privilege it is a privilege yes not general christian no to be a christian it means to be christ like that's what it means to be a christian is not religion it's not church if you come here to church every sunday and you no no that does not make you a christian just to come here to shakaina or to be born in the family of message believers who are a christian because my parents are born my parents are christians no no that doesn't make you a christian to be a christian is to be class life right the most powerful weapon the world has ever known is prayer you have been given authority in his name of being christians and i say christian one of the most powerful force or weapon is prayer we find that prayer brings you closer to god you find that prayer brings you closer in fellowship with god it brings you closer in love with god prayer the christian doesn't realize what a force he has when he kneels under his knees before almighty god in the name of jesus christ he doesn't realize what what powerful that is so powerful it's so powerful that the devils are running as you are starting to kneel because you come already you're entering in the atmosphere the demons are jumping and bumping each other's heads as you do that you don't see them the prophet used to see them they're running around panicking he used to say use it another one like a tortoise there another one like your bed they say come help me they are calling each other as you start to pray that's why he could say the prayer a very sincere prayer even for a weakest believer i consider myself weak even for the weakest believer when he start to pray sincerely things move when a sincere prayer comes from the weakest heart of life when it comes sincerely the way the prophet says the demons they call each other for help so isn't that a privilege i think that's the greatest privilege i don't even want to see them i know they are running apply the token in prayer with with with consideration with believing apply it with such love can you feel the connection again he's talking about apply talk the token in prayer and do it with such consideration believing it apply it with such love how can i just tell my wife oh i love you but i don't mean it yeah no me need when you say god i love you you come before him you'll if you don't you feel like you're short ask him lord give me more of your love because father i want more i want i want an overdose of your love i want to be overdosed with your life i want that overdose i really want it i want to be overdosed to be immersed that when i walk it's just love of god everywhere everyone can touch it that's what i want do you remember that little bear that that bear that was leaking on that little one he had honey everywhere honey everywhere he was sticky with love with honey that's what we want that's what we want that is the glue that is going to bring us together that is what is what is going to bring us closer to the lord within our privileges then when we ask yeah god will say no no no no they don't even have to ask gabrielle before they will even start to ask are we here before amen why because you are asking from the pivotal area so i would like us to go and do that i would like to talk one time about other things you know about uh removing fear we'll talk later on about taking stock taking stock you know if you want to live within the rails you need to top to pause to pause and take stock to be able to understand your identity we'll talk about those things one time right we don't want no identity crisis we are not in an identity crisis right we'll talk about those ones but for today i just want you to go home and regurgitate those two being in the love with god first and prayerfulness go read more about them i can send you this news and i can send you more but go read about them go pray about it lord i want to be pivoted all the time whether the wind is blowing whether the rain is coming unpivoted on the center of the love of god remember when you start to pray demons they run eight minutes past nine we are finished it wasn't as short i apologize
