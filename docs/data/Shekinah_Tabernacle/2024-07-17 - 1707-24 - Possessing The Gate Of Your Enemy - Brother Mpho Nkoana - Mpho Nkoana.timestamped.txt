[8:06] When the Children of Moab and another
[8:09] country rose up against Judah um when
[8:12] Jehoshaphat was King and um they
[8:15] consulted the Lord
[8:17] and and verse 21 of Chronicles here says
[8:22] and when he had consulted with the
[8:23] people he appointed singers unto the
[8:25] Lord and that should praise the beauty
[8:27] of Holiness as they went out before the
[8:30] Army and to say praise the Lord for his
[8:33] mercy endureth forever and when they
[8:35] began to sing and to praise the Lord set
[8:38] ambushments against the children of

[26:13] the the greting modalities afterwards
[26:15] brother Marion thank you my brother and

[26:21] make the
[26:23] job a little easier it's never
[26:26] easy it's never easy absolutely speaking
[26:29] but the atmosphere you create I can
[26:32] assure you without any shadow of a doubt
[26:35] without any fear of contradiction they
[26:37] say in English I can assure you that it
[26:40] creates a wonderful wonderful atmosphere
[26:43] more especially if people enter in you
[26:46] know and we forget about what happened
[26:48] this afternoon amen let's read Genesis
[26:51] chapter 22 then we can sit down we'll
[26:55] read two scriptures Genesis and then
[26:57] we'll go to gal but let's start with
[26:59] that
[27:00] one Genesis 22
[27:03] maybe maybe if you like let's just start
[27:05] from verse
[27:09] 16 is that okay
[27:12] yeah
[27:14] and this is now God talking to Abraham
[27:18] this is after the the issue of God
[27:22] fulfilling his promise when he has
[27:24] finally fulfilled
[27:26] it suddenly
[27:28] now this is if I was Abraham I'll say
[27:31] suddenly he tells me to take my son that
[27:34] I waited for 25 years he tells him take
[27:39] him to the Mount Moriah and and
[27:43] sacrifice him for
[27:45] me this is after that is done and
[27:47] Abraham did it he went right this is now
[27:51] God God now responds to what Abraham has
[27:55] done you know the story let's read it
[27:59] and said this is God by myself have I
[28:02] sworn you know when we say you you
[28:07] swear no sister Noel you SW by you swear
[28:11] by someone in Authority above you
[28:15] because swearing putting an oath is
[28:18] something of a legitimate strongest
[28:22] possible terms that it cannot not be
[28:25] done if somebody say I swear
[28:28] then they go back on their word you just
[28:30] know that they are not God Only God can
[28:33] keep his word they probably I don't want
[28:36] to say they're not God's children but we
[28:38] are not supposed to go
[28:40] back in fact we can
[28:42] swear only God only in marriage hey
[28:46] nowadays they even change it to make it
[28:49] acceptable let's read it I saw by myself
[28:52] have I swor this is God speaking sayith
[28:59] the Lord for because thou has done this
[29:05] thing now this is the verse I want us to

[31:19] something that's right amen right so
[31:24] tonight I want us to speak about this
[31:26] subject POS possessing the gates of your
[31:29] enemy The Prophet preached this message
[31:31] a couple of times but uh because I was
[31:35] not going to preach this Sone but what
[31:37] happened to me is that let me just set
[31:40] up my alarm I always forget what
[31:42] happened to me is
[31:44] that uh there are some brothers who came
[31:48] here in the
[31:49] front and they preached my
[31:53] sermon so so I told them that Brothers
[31:57] you blessed me so much and you took my
[31:59] seron and the notes and you even added
[32:02] and did better than how I was going to
[32:04] do so I've got no more semon to
[32:07] preach because in the last few few
[32:10] Services
[32:11] men amen if anybody listened carefully
[32:15] those message were jointly connected and
[32:18] talking about the Jews and the Israel
[32:20] coming out of Egypt and what happened to
[32:23] them I'm so inspired by their Journey
[32:26] the Jews from egyp egpt to Canaan
[32:29] because it talks about your
[32:31] journey you are a you are a spiritual
[32:34] Israel it talks about you to them it was
[32:38] talking more as a nation it was talking
[32:41] more you know I can say Canal spiritual
[32:44] but more on the negative side you are
[32:46] the true reality of what happened that
[32:49] time I can't repeat those sermons just
[32:52] go listen to them again they on YouTube
[32:54] but they blessed me so much so then the
[32:57] Lord said talk about because now we have
[33:00] seen them they've entered but now in the
[33:04] process of entering there's things that
[33:05] are happening we don't we can't talk
[33:08] about them tonight the Israelites but I
[33:09] want you to focus on
[33:13] yourself possessing the gates of your
[33:16] enemy let's read
[33:19] Galatians amen who wants to read
[33:21] Galatians with
[33:24] me remember when I don't hear you saying
[33:26] amen
[33:30] you know I don't I don't want to be like
[33:31] those preachers who say somebody say
[33:33] Amen
[33:34] there you should just be automatic hey
[33:38] let's read Galatians 3 we'll read a few
[33:40] a few a few areas Galatians 3 let's
[33:43] start with verse
[33:45] 25 H what did I
[33:48] say yeah
[33:51] so verse three I mean chapter 3:
[33:55] 25 but after faith
[33:58] after that faith is come we are no
[34:01] longer under the school Master which is
[34:04] the law for you are all the children of
[34:07] God by faith in Jesus Christ are you
[34:10] listening carefully you must believe
[34:12] that for real real real like when I say
[34:14] to you tomorrow you're going to wake up
[34:17] and eat breakfast that's for real more
[34:18] real than that that's who you are don't
[34:21] ever let the devil make you doubt
[34:25] yourself verse 20
[34:29] six for ye are all the children of God
[34:33] by Faith by faith in Christ Jesus for as
[34:38] many as you have been baptized into
[34:43] Christ have put on Christ you are
[34:47] baptized into Christ you believe by
[34:50] faith God Gave You Faith you you
[34:52] believed it was revealed to you you're
[34:54] baptized in Christ now you are a fully
[34:57] fleshed son or daughter of
[34:59] God there there is
[35:02] neither Jew nor Greek there is neither
[35:04] born nor free there is neither male nor
[35:08] female for ye are all one in Christ
[35:12] Jesus and if he if ye or you be
[35:18] Christ if in other words if you now are
[35:21] belonging to him Christ
[35:24] then are ye Abraham's seed
[35:28] and as according to the
[35:31] promise you know in that scripture God
[35:34] the first one that we read God made
[35:35] promise to
[35:36] Abraham he made a promise to Abraham and
[35:40] he said Abraham because you have done
[35:42] this
[35:43] thing in other words Abraham challenged
[35:46] God to the point where God said you know
[35:49] what I'm going to promise you and your
[35:53] seat that is still coming because God
[35:56] knows everything isn't it if God even
[35:59] knew God is so amazing last time I told
[36:01] you that God is a strange God it's not
[36:04] like God did not know that Abraham is
[36:06] going to believe him God knew but the
[36:09] question could be then why did God do it
[36:11] we we maybe we'll talk about that God
[36:13] knows everything but he still did it
[36:15] you'll see why so he promised Abraham
[36:20] and his seed that is why the Bible says
[36:23] there that if you are in CHR because
[36:25] Christ is the true f is the true seat of
[36:29] Abraham so because he's the true son of
[36:31] Abraham SE of seat of Abraham and you
[36:34] are Christ you are Christians you belong
[36:37] to him therefore that makes you the seat
[36:40] of
[36:42] Abraham that means you are partakers to
[36:45] the promises that God gave Abraham are
[36:50] we together I would like us to be
[36:52] together because I won't be long then
[36:53] I'll finish but I want you just to grasp
[36:56] it to grasp it the with the intensity
[36:59] that the Bible says
[37:00] it so okay in blessing I'll Will Bless
[37:06] The so this sounds like it's a it's a
[37:08] it's a promise even before I born and
[37:12] God already knows my mistakes God knows
[37:14] that I'm going to be born a sinner but
[37:16] he's already promising me why because he
[37:20] predestinated you he chose
[37:24] you some foolish person can ask and say
[37:27] say but why then if God predestinated us
[37:31] and he knew why all
[37:34] this H or not foolish person maybe
[37:38] someone small in faith or something who
[37:41] hasn't got the Revelation yet but you
[37:44] see God likes to fulfill and prove his
[37:47] word and nothing comes to God that
[37:50] belongs to him comes
[37:53] untested nothing comes to God even God
[37:57] himself he tries his own
[37:59] we and he he that is why he when he saw
[38:03] he knew this will happen there's no way
[38:05] God can say something and it doesn't
[38:06] happen so everything that is of
[38:10] god and everyone must come accordingly
[38:14] according to his word that's why when
[38:16] Abraham did that then God spoke and
[38:19] spoke for you and he says I'm going to
[38:21] bless them in blessing and God still
[38:23] knew that you're going to
[38:26] lie but God you he doesn't see any life
[38:29] from you because you he gave you a conf
[38:31] a confessing heart he gave you a
[38:33] repenting heart he gave you a a heart
[38:36] that accepts him he gave you a heart
[38:39] that accept the word and go do it when
[38:41] he preached and God God never doubted
[38:45] you God never doubted you so don't doubt
[38:48] yourself and don't doubt your brother
[38:50] because God never doubted
[38:52] them all I'm trying to say you tonight
[38:54] here is maybe somebody can say but then
[38:56] why would God allow all these things to
[38:58] happen if God knew because God wanted he
[39:01] had certain things in him that he wanted
[39:03] to bring out God wanted to be a Healer
[39:06] God wanted to be glorified to be
[39:08] worshiped he wanted to be God he wanted
[39:10] to be a savior and he wanted those
[39:12] things for them to happen all these
[39:14] things had to
[39:15] happen he he needed to find someone
[39:18] who's lost he needed a sinner tonight to
[39:22] come to Christ he needed a heart to
[39:25] repent he needed someone to tonight who
[39:27] seek to be
[39:29] healed otherwise how will God do it and
[39:32] God saw that as the best fit to do it
[39:34] and he saw it all in his mind and he
[39:36] said ah I'll do this all what we are
[39:39] doing now is like we are playing a a
[39:41] script that is all God has already seen
[39:44] everything we are just playing out
[39:45] everything and the way you
[39:48] play the way you play is exactly how God
[39:52] saw it so be careful how you play be on
[39:55] the right side amen amen now let's let's
[40:00] let's hear this okay possessing this now
[40:04] the question now can be you who is your
[40:08] enemy you've got to be able to identify
[40:11] to know your
[40:13] enemy I've never seen a battle where we
[40:16] fight sister armor and then you don't
[40:18] know your
[40:21] opponent your opponent is not
[40:24] Lilia sorry my girls
[40:28] Lilia your opponent is not
[40:32] armor even though sometimes you can not
[40:35] see things the same way you can differ
[40:38] and the more you differ the more you
[40:39] love one
[40:41] another that's how we possess we possess
[40:44] the more I can I I can you can be in
[40:47] trouble the more you can be in hardships
[40:50] the more you can be in anything is the
[40:51] more I must get closer to you the more
[40:54] you hurt me I know we don't just go all
[40:57] out to head is the more I love
[41:00] you that's how we possess so I want you
[41:03] to know that the enemy is not my brother
[41:07] the enemy is not even that person out
[41:09] there who's trying to destroy you who's
[41:12] trying to take maybe business from you
[41:14] or who's trying to kick you out of the
[41:15] job or who's trying to steal Factory
[41:18] Pizza customers that's not the
[41:20] enemy no no that one we love him we
[41:23] actually give him a free pizza isn't it
[41:27] yeah
[41:28] the more he try to bring us down we give
[41:29] him free free pizza and win him to the
[41:32] Lord so know your
[41:36] enemy and then it says they are going to
[41:40] possess the gates of their enemy you
[41:42] need to be able to know what are your
[41:47] Gates because if you don't know your
[41:50] Gates or the gates that you you have to
[41:52] possess how then will you possess
[41:55] them right I might not be be able to
[41:57] tell you tonight it may not be for
[41:59] tonight how and what are your Gates
[42:01] because I don't know your Gates but
[42:03] you've got to be able to know that this
[42:05] gate I must possess this one this one I
[42:08] must possess it because Joshua even
[42:11] Samson he picked them up not me that
[42:14] Samson he picked them up those gats
[42:17] remember he picked them up and he threw
[42:20] them
[42:20] away now there are gates in our
[42:24] lives right and those things that are
[42:28] the enemy uses that the enemy uses to
[42:30] deter or prevent you from overcoming and
[42:34] getting your promises those are your
[42:36] Gates the enemy uses them big time and
[42:40] me and you can allow the enemy to build
[42:42] strong gates to block
[42:46] us so possessing also comes from when
[42:50] possessing can I've never heard about
[42:53] possessing or winning a battle without
[42:55] any fight
[42:57] you've got to understand brothers and
[42:59] sisters that we
[43:01] fight and it's a fight it's not a joke
[43:03] it's a fight where we fight and we are
[43:05] fighting and fight fight fight if a
[43:09] politician can be shot almost to
[43:13] death and then they try to help him to
[43:15] take him off the stage he stand up and
[43:17] say no leave me fight fight fight a
[43:20] politician like Trump if he can do that
[43:23] how much more about me and you the
[43:25] spirit that is in you that we are
[43:27] singing about it it it's like a you know
[43:29] a revolver it's like oh last time I made
[43:31] a mistake I must make a
[43:33] correction I spoke about a matter how
[43:36] many remembers I said what is a matter
[43:39] remember and we got home and my family
[43:41] corrected me you know husbands you must
[43:45] be allowed allow yourself to be
[43:46] corrected by your families my family
[43:48] corrected me and said ah up you missed
[43:51] point the D I said what now huh they
[43:55] said no no no no calm down you you
[43:57] missed a point the matter that you spoke
[43:59] about the one of science matter is
[44:02] anything that can occupy space and have
[44:05] weight it's not the one that the
[44:07] scripture was referring to the there's
[44:09] matter and there's matter so because me
[44:12] I'm not English that's the excuse I
[44:14] always
[44:17] give It's a Wonderful excuse cuz I'm not
[44:21] English if you say matter it's matter
[44:27] and if I say
[44:29] sorry you might not know what sorry am I
[44:32] referring to I could be meaning that I'm
[44:35] not sorry so because I'm not English but
[44:38] the point is last time I made that
[44:40] mistake and I said matter so the matter
[44:44] was about the whole issue the whole
[44:46] matter in its
[44:47] entirety right the whole matter of you
[44:50] existing not that matter like this
[44:53] object that can occupy space no it's a
[44:54] whole matter of of your life
[44:57] that is what I wanted to say right
[44:59] forgive me for that so back to our
[45:03] possession
[45:04] possessing you have to
[45:07] fight and fighting in my language is got
[45:11] actually the real fight has got no
[45:15] rules this fight that they say no no you
[45:17] must have fight according to the rules
[45:19] of what they
[45:20] lie because they themselves don't fight
[45:22] according to the rules of Fight is a
[45:25] fight yeah
[45:27] if I bite your ear and cut
[45:30] it and you say oh my ear I hold it not
[45:36] you we are fighting the devil right yeah
[45:39] if in a fight we fight and a fight can
[45:42] get ugly yeah when two elephants fight
[45:46] even sister analis you know who suffers
[45:48] the grass say where can I run to because
[45:52] this is hot hot hot hot hot hot don't
[45:54] expect the battle to be nice and
[45:57] everything no you are a daughter of
[45:59] Abraham Abraham fought and he made
[46:02] mistakes as well the great father
[46:06] Abraham the father of Faith he also made
[46:09] mistakes so the only thing that you've
[46:12] got to know be on the right side yeah
[46:14] know your enemy know that you are in a
[46:17] fight and it can be ugly amen but
[46:20] there's some assurances I will tell you
[46:21] now Mel there's some
[46:23] assurances our fight is not like a
[46:25] worldly fight where you fight without
[46:28] hope yeah come on HH you try to fight
[46:32] you don't know who you are fighting like
[46:35] I was driving and then someone just come
[46:37] and just pass our car and just go in
[46:39] front and that person is under pressure
[46:42] he thinks I'm the enemy because I don't
[46:43] want to give him space for him to move
[46:46] you see he doesn't realize I'm not the
[46:48] enemy I'm just obeying the rules of the
[46:51] road you see so you you you need to know
[46:55] your enemy because
[46:57] sometimes the enemy can come by means of
[47:01] habits the enemy comes in many forms and
[47:04] shape one day we will talk about the
[47:07] intellect of the enemy for you just go
[47:09] and read that message of demonology and
[47:12] read about demons in the Physical
[47:14] Realm and read about demons in the
[47:16] physical real in the spiritual realm and
[47:19] understand your enemy and not dwell on
[47:22] much on him just read that one because
[47:24] he's exposed in there and you'll know
[47:26] know that he is fighting this battle but
[47:30] if you know and you he has been exposed
[47:33] in your life then he's not going to
[47:35] confuse you or or or or or somehow
[47:37] trigger you no no you know him you know
[47:40] his thoughts and you know when he comes
[47:42] that this is the devil and you deal with
[47:46] him very clearly Jon very clearly don't
[47:49] allow the devil to to to to bring you to
[47:52] low as if you don't know who you are you
[47:54] are an amateure God you know what is an
[47:57] amature God the only thing now that
[47:59] prohibits you you know it's just this
[48:01] flesh otherwise you could just create
[48:04] another
[48:05] Earth that looks like the guga national
[48:08] park J and only you and your dad just go
[48:11] there on your birthday so it's only this
[48:14] flesh and but we've got that power
[48:18] yeah
[48:20] amen sicknesses Temptations death habits
[48:24] many things can come but remember the is
[48:27] an assurance that not even death
[48:30] Christians don't die we we don't we it's
[48:33] just a doll God opens a a a window there
[48:37] then they they look at us and they
[48:39] they're smiling they say when they come
[48:42] here they're going to meet us by the
[48:44] gate when those great P of gates you
[48:47] know those great Gates of P
[48:50] opens that day the devil will know where
[48:53] he
[48:55] started so don't be of good courage know
[48:59] that you and me are daughters and sons
[49:02] of God and we are going somewhere the
[49:04] reason we are fighting is because God
[49:06] has got a mission to fulfill yes amen
[49:10] right so I said the love Faith and
[49:12] acting on the word of God and fervent
[49:14] and sincere prayer when you do things
[49:16] for God do them sincerely and fervently
[49:19] be consistent the only thing that you do
[49:22] you is up up the devil says you're going
[49:25] down you say I'm going up up up up up up
[49:29] you know that song up up up I'm going up
[49:32] you know that one maybe my wife know
[49:34] yeah brother know it so let's just read
[49:38] a few quotes and we close but I want you
[49:42] to know and get this assurance now
[49:44] before I even forget an assurance is
[49:46] this your battle has already been
[49:50] won how is that wonderful so you are
[49:53] fighting a battle that has already
[49:55] beenen
[49:57] how wonderful is
[49:58] that you have never had in the history
[50:01] and the future of this Earth that we're
[50:03] fighting a battle but it's already be
[50:05] otherwise they won't do it but we do it
[50:07] because God has got a mission to fulfill
[50:10] against the devil that you thought you
[50:12] can defeat me look I've won the he
[50:15] already won it that is why the scripture
[50:16] says but he has given you a promise
[50:19] already the promises for you for healing
[50:22] the promise for deliverance the promise
[50:24] for anything that you asking God he's
[50:25] already been given God is not a
[50:28] liar healing you already been
[50:33] sealed you are already been healed amen
[50:37] the only thing that you need to do the
[50:40] rest is done we can just take up BS and
[50:42] go everything is done for you this is
[50:45] the only thing that you need to do you
[50:47] just believe the word of God Amen and
[50:50] hold on that's all believe because it's
[50:54] done listen no amount of your unbelief
[50:56] believe is going to change God's
[50:58] plan whether you believe God and I'm
[51:01] sorry to speak this harshly but I'm
[51:03] trying to say this whole world if they
[51:05] can't believe God they won't stop the
[51:07] plan of God it's done done it is done
[51:10] sealed and dusted you are
[51:13] in prove to the Lord by believing his
[51:18] word believe it every second and hold on
[51:23] there hanging there hold on and he has
[51:25] already given you already the power to
[51:27] hold on yeah so he will hold you with
[51:30] that power you heard on Sunday that we
[51:32] don't we can't hold ourselves it's him
[51:35] who holds us so just believe don't be to
[51:38] the left to the right and then ticker
[51:41] and someday no no there will be Sunshine
[51:44] there will be clouds there will be that
[51:46] but believe even if it's unbelievable
[51:49] and hold on right that's what me and you
[51:53] has to do let's listen here for the
[51:57] Bible said that when we are dead in
[52:00] Christ we are Abraham's seed and as with
[52:04] him according to the
[52:06] promise the Bible was not written now in
[52:09] 1976 when I was born no the Bible is has
[52:14] been written for a long time God had
[52:16] this in his mind even before it was on
[52:18] paperwork God had it it was already
[52:21] there the word of
[52:25] God oh my
[52:29] now it says that when we are
[52:34] dead to
[52:36] ourselves when we
[52:39] die then we are as we are we are the
[52:42] ones that
[52:43] inherit we are Abraham's
[52:46] seed when you die to
[52:50] yourself according to the promise we are
[52:52] Abraham's ass with him according to the
[52:54] promise and we receive Abraham's seed
[52:56] when we receive the Holy Spirit now this
[53:00] can be tricky but let nothing confuse
[53:03] you if the devil tries to confuse you
[53:06] just say hey man you are wasting your
[53:08] time because that scripture that he's
[53:10] reading the one that you are saying
[53:11] confuses is is fulfilled in me whether I
[53:14] see it or not when you receive the Holy
[53:17] Spirit then you are actually fulfilling
[53:21] or showing this that you are the seat
[53:23] you receive your seat of you a seat of a
[53:26] Abraham when you receive the holy spirit
[53:28] because it's a process and you will see
[53:30] now what I mean by a process so we
[53:34] receive a Faith with his holy spirit
[53:38] that was the faith that was delivered
[53:41] for Father
[53:42] Abraham for when we die in Christ we
[53:46] take on the
[53:48] promise we believe I'll show you now we
[53:51] believe and we get the Holy Spirit and
[53:54] we get trials and temptations and then
[53:57] all the process come and then God comes
[53:59] to a point where now he now recognizes
[54:01] your faith you are now adopt an adopted
[54:03] son and daughter of God but all along
[54:06] all the time before you get there is a
[54:09] process of you getting to that
[54:12] point but I'm saying to you already you
[54:15] are but you just working to a a process
[54:17] of repeat you are repeating what God has
[54:19] already fulfilled but you're getting
[54:22] there that's what you need to know that
[54:24] it is a done job but I'm in the process
[54:26] of fulfilling what has already happened
[54:28] in God's mind that is why we are saying
[54:31] it's a one battle it's already won it's
[54:34] already the devil is already been
[54:35] defeated but you need just to be on the
[54:38] right side believe believe believe
[54:44] amen and promise that in the days of how
[54:48] he would confirm the same thing that he
[54:51] spoke to Abraham he will confirm it
[54:53] again with Abraham's seat which is you
[54:58] are you the seat of
[54:59] Abraham if you the seat of Abraham
[55:02] everything that Abraham Abraham has gone
[55:04] through the seat will go
[55:07] through huh imagine waiting for a child
[55:10] for 25
[55:12] years and you are an old
[55:15] man maybe the gynecologist of those days
[55:18] and the urologist told him that H Papa
[55:22] it can't
[55:23] happen but Abraham never worried about
[55:25] never worried about what they tell him
[55:27] he never all what Abraham did he didn't
[55:30] complicate things he just
[55:32] believed he didn't bother him whether
[55:36] he's 150 years old or his 100 years or
[55:40] SAR whatever stories no no that's not
[55:42] for him the devil brought that to him
[55:44] many times but he never entertained all
[55:46] what Abraham did is that I'm a Son of
[55:48] God and I believe the word of God God
[55:50] says I must do that I do it I believe
[55:52] that Lord give me more love for you
[55:54] that's what all what Abraham did
[55:56] you see so look there I got that picture
[55:59] for you guys is is it a lovely
[56:03] picture look at Abraham and Sarah they
[56:07] are not
[56:08] worried the devil wants you to be
[56:10] worried so that he can steal your rest
[56:12] as we had on Sunday he can steal you a
[56:14] pieace so that he can steal he he says
[56:17] slick tell him that I said so he's a
[56:21] Sleek so anything that he can bring to
[56:23] your mind be careful eval and review
[56:27] your thoughts brother and sister don't
[56:29] just allow every thought to go through
[56:30] your mind and every activity and let the
[56:33] devil make your mind a basketball court
[56:36] no don't allow him every thought like a
[56:39] ball that comes bumping say wait you
[56:43] because because you've got the authority
[56:44] he gave you the authority so he gave you
[56:46] you've got authority to command the
[56:48] devil and say V know you've got he has
[56:52] given it to no don't doubt yourself my
[56:54] children know that what we are telling
[56:56] you now is the truth and it's real
[57:00] that's right we are not we are not g
[57:02] gaming ourselves and wanting to you to
[57:03] be good people and come to church and
[57:06] have good families that's not the real
[57:08] aim that we have yes we want those
[57:10] things we want you to be soldiers of the
[57:13] Cross so that when we cross over we know
[57:15] those boys are coming amen and they're
[57:18] coming with a wi because the wi is given
[57:20] that's what we want to live this life to
[57:22] prep for you to be inspired and get the
[57:25] same holy Spirit that's what we want
[57:28] we're not trying to indoctrinate you we
[57:30] just want to live a life for you to know
[57:32] that we are going home very soon if you
[57:35] want to come believe the word of God
[57:39] yeah believe it do it believe it do it
[57:45] don't worry about whether it's hard or
[57:46] not that's not that's not your business
[57:49] that's the business for God hard easy
[57:53] what what the world say or anything just

[58:41] discussing my watch changed and changed
[58:44] the the it just started and started with
[58:46] 3 minutes started
[58:49] over my watch it's not me here started
[58:54] just cancelled everything and started
[58:55] from zero so you know what I
[59:00] mean I don't know why I never touched it
[59:04] but
[59:07] anyway Abraham disregarded his State of
[59:10] Mind his state of health his state of
[59:13] whatever he disregarded that in the
[59:15] little red box I wrote there he
[59:17] disregarded himself and everything
[59:19] around him he disregarded his current
[59:21] state of health and circumstances around
[59:24] his wife he disregarded the people's
[59:26] opinions about himself and God he he
[59:29] just ignored flatly he disbelieved
[59:32] anything around what whatever was
[59:34] happening he just believed
[59:36] God Abraham believed what God Said was
[59:39] the truth he didn't consider how old he
[59:42] was how old Sarah was that the seem so
[59:45] that's how we
[59:47] possess the
[59:48] gate can I tell you can I shock you if
[59:52] you wake up in the morning and the devil
[59:55] say oh you feel like the pain and you I
[59:57] can't go to to church you know can I can
[1:00:01] I tell you something if you just jump
[1:00:03] and get ready and go to church before
[1:00:05] you arrive to church it's gone it it
[1:00:08] never happened to you me it happened to
[1:00:11] me even last night I had a charger of a
[1:00:15] laptop that has not been working for
[1:00:18] months or for weeks it was never working
[1:00:21] on my phone no more I tried at work even
[1:00:24] the work gadgets never worked
[1:00:26] you know the things we take and plug on
[1:00:28] the phone to church at work they were
[1:00:30] not no more working on my phone and it
[1:00:32] was only at this charger that we pl
[1:00:35] Samsung one that we pl that work my
[1:00:37] phone we tried everything the charger
[1:00:39] for the laptop and any other charger
[1:00:41] were no more
[1:00:42] working last night I didn't have any
[1:00:45] charger and I wanted to my phone to
[1:00:47] charge because I was going through the
[1:00:49] seron and then somehow I took my laptop
[1:00:52] I took my laptop charger without
[1:00:54] thinking about it the devil said oh no
[1:00:56] no no no it doesn't work I said I just
[1:00:57] didn't think about it I just didn't
[1:00:59] process that thought I just took the
[1:01:01] Char plug it and plug on my phone that
[1:01:03] same charger and it worked so who fixed
[1:01:08] it who fixed it now are you able to see
[1:01:12] God on such
[1:01:13] things now bigger things will you see
[1:01:16] because if you can see God on those
[1:01:18] things that God can send his Angel to
[1:01:20] inspire that that charger because he's
[1:01:22] looking at the inside he's looking at
[1:01:24] your motive and you
[1:01:26] objective why do you want that CH to
[1:01:28] work so that you can be praised or me
[1:01:30] can be praised that's what God checks
[1:01:33] and you me and you must think according
[1:01:35] to God's line of thinking when we when
[1:01:38] he acts we see oh this is God we must be
[1:01:40] able to see so Abraham was like that AB
[1:01:43] baby calling his wife baby she was how
[1:01:46] many 60 years 65 we going to have a baby
[1:01:50] love
[1:01:52] said you
[1:01:54] see so
[1:02:01] yeah so
[1:02:03] stop
[1:02:04] so let's just finish off with
[1:02:08] this Abraham first believed God sweats
[1:02:13] separated he got tested and he got
[1:02:15] blessed and that's what those are just I
[1:02:18] just put them there based on what
[1:02:20] Abraham experienced what Abraham went
[1:02:23] through there's many other things that
[1:02:24] he went through right
[1:02:26] now Abraham after he was called out to
[1:02:28] the land of Chalin he was called out God
[1:02:31] spoke to him and he believed you start
[1:02:33] by believing right and you believe
[1:02:36] everything that God says regardless and
[1:02:39] then you
[1:02:42] separate separation means
[1:02:45] cutting that is why God even gave him a
[1:02:47] sign of circumcision as a sign cut your
[1:02:52] flesh cut the Habit cut your time of
[1:02:56] phone cut your time of not increase the
[1:02:58] time of of of praying and cut the other
[1:03:01] times of other
[1:03:02] things if you eating more on the
[1:03:05] physical cut it and eat more
[1:03:07] spiritually yes everything that benefits
[1:03:09] flesh cut
[1:03:11] it even your
[1:03:15] budget okay sorry brother Isaac I don't
[1:03:18] mean to get in that
[1:03:21] territory brother Isaac is the trust you
[1:03:24] so he will say brother leave that area
[1:03:26] for me to address
[1:03:28] okay so believed separated
[1:03:33] tested very hard and blessed and me and
[1:03:37] you we will be tested very hard the
[1:03:41] devil even want you not to see that you
[1:03:43] being tested he wants you not even
[1:03:45] realize in other words he wants to do
[1:03:47] like a washing machine you know washing
[1:03:48] when he's in the washing machine it gets
[1:03:50] so Ted that does not know where he's
[1:03:52] going so that's what the devil wants to
[1:03:54] do to tell you that you don't even know
[1:03:56] when he's actually testing you you're
[1:03:58] confused then you're just you're just it
[1:04:01] takes you and put you in the
[1:04:03] dryer so we must never be confused and
[1:04:07] be tumbled by the devil we must be able
[1:04:10] to identify him and for you to identify
[1:04:12] him if you can only do that when you've
[1:04:14] got the atmosphere of God because you
[1:04:17] believe the atmosphere is on you you
[1:04:20] believe Against All Odds I cannot
[1:04:23] overemphasize that point but anyway
[1:04:26] these slides I can send you for you to
[1:04:28] enjoy and see what I have enjoyed and
[1:04:31] I'll just jump through to some of the
[1:04:34] things that I want to read for you uh at
[1:04:36] the end and then we can we can
[1:04:40] close on this one it was about
[1:04:42] circumcision it was about testing it was
[1:04:44] about separation it was about us
[1:04:47] believing so that's what we will go
[1:04:49] through and they will come when they
[1:04:51] come don't cry and say why
[1:04:53] me no say bring it on it's okay because
[1:04:56] even death cannot touch
[1:04:57] you what can he do he cannot touch you
[1:04:59] he can't touch your children all that
[1:05:01] you love he can't touch them you you
[1:05:04] claim them because God said even those
[1:05:07] things those that you love I'll give
[1:05:09] them to you God even G showed brother
[1:05:12] bam a
[1:05:14] dog and a horse and a
[1:05:17] chair that he loved how much more about
[1:05:20] your family man come on be serious now
[1:05:24] how much more about the people that you
[1:05:25] love so love love them regardless
[1:05:29] because that love is going to bring
[1:05:32] them claim them why did God do give
[1:05:36] Abraham a promise and fulfill it why why
[1:05:39] did God ask Abraham to to sacrifice his
[1:05:42] son that he loveed very much obviously
[1:05:44] God knew the
[1:05:45] outcome but but then why did he do
[1:05:48] it you see God knew that me and you are
[1:05:52] coming that is why I think that's why
[1:05:55] the reason brother been Abraham was not
[1:05:56] in the in the first church age or maybe
[1:05:58] during Martin Luther that's why Abraham
[1:06:01] had to be there at the beginning because
[1:06:04] God had to set an example to show us God
[1:06:07] was doing it for me and for you yeah
[1:06:09] that's what the prophet say I can read
[1:06:11] for
[1:06:12] you if you have been faithful to eat and
[1:06:16] you you're 100 years old old now now I'm
[1:06:18] going to prove my power to you this is
[1:06:21] now God brother bam talking as if God
[1:06:24] was saying I'm going to prove my power
[1:06:25] to you because you believe me Abraham so
[1:06:28] that the seat after you will know to
[1:06:30] take a hold on God's weight who's the
[1:06:34] seed us God was doing that and he knew
[1:06:39] Abraham would do that and he allowed it
[1:06:41] to happen so that me and you when we
[1:06:43] come here we do the same he was doing it
[1:06:46] for us
[1:06:47] everything I mean I've never had a man
[1:06:50] that says Ah everything in this house
[1:06:53] okay I do it for my mother
[1:06:56] or my last born of course he do it for
[1:06:58] them but that man actually everything
[1:07:00] that he does in his house is for his
[1:07:02] wife the wife is the apple of the man's
[1:07:06] eye I even told a good friend of mine
[1:07:09] today they did law and I said happy wife
[1:07:13] happy
[1:07:16] life I told
[1:07:18] him cuz we're discussing something over
[1:07:21] the phone I said happy
[1:07:23] wife so the God knows the Lord Jesus
[1:07:27] Christ knows he knows this principle of
[1:07:29] happy life I mean happy wife that's why
[1:07:32] he makes you happy he knows it and he
[1:07:35] knew that we are going to catch on it as
[1:07:37] if it's he you know it has always been
[1:07:39] there even before we thought about it
[1:07:41] God knew that I want to make my wife
[1:07:43] happy I want to make my bride the apple
[1:07:46] of my eye you know the when we say the
[1:07:48] apple of your eye I don't want to
[1:07:49] misrepresented but you know what what
[1:07:51] they mean about the apple of an ey I
[1:07:53] don't want to interpret it and then tell
[1:07:55] Bing Apple the apple of God's eye is
[1:08:01] you you are the apple of God's eye the
[1:08:09] nucleus can we say without you God is
[1:08:13] not
[1:08:14] complete you know that so you're not
[1:08:17] just a a cheap cheap human
[1:08:20] being I don't mean for us to be proud
[1:08:23] but I mean that when you possess real
[1:08:26] possess go all out and say Lord cry even
[1:08:30] have you ever found someone beating you
[1:08:32] defeating you but cry because now you
[1:08:33] are fighting a real battle you are
[1:08:35] possessing cry to the Lord cry if you
[1:08:39] want to cry don't prohibit it cry and
[1:08:42] call the name of the Lord and say Lord
[1:08:44] take me out of this is a thorn on my
[1:08:47] flesh Lord I don't like it remove it I
[1:08:52] want this way your word so God will hear
[1:08:55] you
[1:08:56] don't don't don't don't do things
[1:08:58] fictitiously and then when you are here
[1:09:00] you're a different person when you are
[1:09:02] at home when you are there no no no no
[1:09:04] be the same person just like when you
[1:09:06] are alone in your closet with God be the
[1:09:08] same one cry to God the same
[1:09:11] way right and then God will make sure
[1:09:15] that you possess the gates of your enemy
[1:09:18] and it is given already you see little
[1:09:22] Denny there God already know
[1:09:26] if the Lord Telles whatever he he when
[1:09:28] he grows up God already know his
[1:09:30] challenges he already know what is going
[1:09:32] to make him happy he already know it's
[1:09:33] over he already given I mean look at
[1:09:35] here God already know God already knew
[1:09:37] when me and you were
[1:09:39] born I would like us to
