Clarity of thought Lord an open word that tells us where we are Lord Jesus there is no confusion here we know where we stand Lord and we thank you for that Lord I think sometimes we don't thank you enough Lord Jesus but I just want to say thank you Lord blessed be the name of our Lord Jesus Christ for now and forevermore amen amen do you love him amen thank you musicians you may be seated all right God bless you Saints um so we all dressed up and we all come to church tonight all ready to to do some some fellowship with our lawn so please don't get distracted try and try not to fade away you know just it's hot sometimes it's it's people get tired you know but tonight go get your blessing amen because there's definitely one for you there um let's let's open our first thing I've got a little side note this is a thought that came today now hear this out this is about other mine thought forgive me so if they say that when you're having fun time flies and it really does fly who knows to all your kids when when we having fun how fast does the time go you're just about to have fun and then Mom and Dad goes we need to go and you're like oh but I had so much fun and then you go how did two hours or three hours before just go gone well now let me tell you this is a thought you have to take so if Heaven has eternity how much fun aren't you going to have there when there's no stop to it think about that God had to make a place where there is no time because we're going to have so much fun nobody's gonna stop it just think about it you know there's a stop to a fun year but in heaven it's just going to be all different I think sometimes we we're so stuck in this round that we forgot that there's a better world coming there is no sin no cell phones no emails no nothing that's going to chase us you know no no bad guys no no things that can upset you no sickness no Sorrows no no breaking your toe Joshua no cutting your leg Jonathan you know you'll be just good every day you won't fall asleep when when the angels are singing you'll just be awake and ready amen hey man I think that's good that's something worth looking forward to especially not having a phone praise the Lord so um I don't want to do a I always say this but I don't want to have a serious sermon but I want you to to put yourself in the shoes of David tonight just for a brief time so so if you can take yourself and put you in the place where David finds himself tonight and then see how God works around David to get him in that position try to see that and make it personal don't leave it by David make it personal because I can tell you that this pleased me so much because I came in the same space we we a couple of things or multiple things happen and I was standing in a spot where I said Lord what am I doing here what what am I doing here I need you to step in now so so I encourage you don't think anything else don't think preaching and boringness and Bible and all these scriptures put yourself tonight in the shoes of David amen and may the word bless the reading oh Lord brace the reading of his word tonight we're going to go to First Samuel chapter 30. so I'm going to kind of Hit the the back part of the story and then we're going to go a little bit back and see if we can fill in the rest because then um hopefully and if I leave my notes tonight who cares okay so then I was meant to do it if I do say anything that you don't understand please forgive me I'll speak English and self-defense and uh anything I do say I say out of love I'll never mean anything harsh about it because I really love all of you like you're my brothers and sisters okay amen so let's go to two verse number one it says and it came to pass when David and his men will come to zieglag on the third day that their amalekites have invaded the south of Ziegler and Smith and Ziegler and burned burned it with fire and had taken a woman captive they were therein they slew not any the great uh great nor small but carried them away and went on their way so David and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives and David and the people that we were left were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep amen may the Lord add his Blessing to this word you may have your seats so it it sounds like this is now a real sober moment and I'm gonna it's gonna be a tough one but nah just just hang in there it's actually there's a good good into this the Lord don't put us in the place and don't make a way out if you want to want to find a scripture for it I got it let me tell you here we go listen to this one in First Corinthians and the 10th chapter 12 verses is therefore let him that think of he stand take heed least he falls there I have no temptation taking you but such as Comet to man but God is faithful who is who is willing that you not suffer or be tempted above what you are able to withstand but every Temptation also is a way of Escape that he may be able to bear it so remember you sometimes find yourself and this is where I'm kind of just going to leave my note to find yourself in a in it I call it the the ziglag moment you know because I always want to identify somewhere in scripture we where God could have gotten my attention so I can I can encourage you young people before you know all um try to go somewhere else stay here but if you read your Bible hear me out if you read your Bible there will be things that pop out there that God would place in your heart and then when you come and sit here it will be things come over the pulpit that will take that little thought that God put in your heart and just go but the moment you get distracted the moment you start thinking of basketball and 100 meter finals and uh football called it football this time or TV games or javelin throw what happens is God wants to bless you and show you that he's real but once you start wandering a little bit oh that's just that they were distracting you don't fall for his tricks try to stay in it it's a fight amen so my sermon title tonight is losing touch with reality now how does that go into the Ziegler moment where we David came and all of a sudden he finds himself looking at a city burned to the ground while it's pretty much easy if we go a little bit back and we go now to um one Samuel 27 and I'll just read it for Saving Time uses and David said in his heart I shall now perish One Day by the hand of Saul there is nothing better for me to do that I should speedly escape to the land of the Philistines and shorten and soul shall despair of me to seek me any more in the coast of Israel so shall I escape out of his hand now for me is when I look at David David used to pray just before this happened he used to pray and ask God for everything shall I go shall I go shall we do this he had such a relationship with God and God was busy training David because before this very moment before Saul even took a evil spirit before he got there David was was led by God every step of the way so he was chosen by God he was told what is his identity you're going to be King David knew this and then all of a sudden he sends him a bear he sends him a lion he sends all these trials on his face sends him Goliath and things just start falling into place but now he finds he's in a very cushy seat in the king's Palace and he's fighting the king's battles and he's winning the king's battles and all of a sudden the women come back and they sing David uh saw us as slain His Thousand Davidson ten thousand and Saul look at this and he goes hey oh my so what's the next thing to give him the kingdom because all the people has already got favor and they like David and he gets a complex and now that he has a complex he gets fear because he doesn't want to lose the kingdom and now he opens himself up to a evil spirit and it says if you go to Samuel 18 it says an evil spirit from God went on soul so this doesn't mean God is the evil spirit this means that all Spirits are subject to God so now here it is all spirits are subjected to God he owns it all he owns the devil with job he said hey have you considered my servant job he used that Spirit to drive a testimony to say that job was faithful you know and he was going to continue in the no matter what happens he will not curse God so he used that evil spirit to get job to say testify of me that I am God and you are a Overcomer and he had tough times and it was real bad now think about job and I'm kind of jumping off you but you get home and at one two of it comes and goes you just lost all your your stock that's just all burn okay gone then they they came over and then they killed all your sons and daughters if that's not worse they burned your bonds and all those things you kind of well I think it was burned your bon secunda remember there's four guys that came to him but this all four events happened like in as the one was finishing his sentence the next one shows up and so I got more bad news and now job sits in this situation now look at that and he's thinking something's going on here but he got God God giveth God take of away blessed be the name of the Lord so he goes back to his training he goes back to his experience with God but David here now he comes to Ziegler so before he got to zeklag if you go to 17 or 28 and this is where it's actually where I want to talk about it says um no that's 27. he went he went now to the Philistines so he went to akish and he got to akish and he says King akish I pledge allegiance I'm gonna fight your battles but aches is so he got hurt in church Israel and something scratched him and all of a sudden he finds himself in a place where he's fighting for the enemy because he lost who he was he lost his identity God said you're king of Israel not Philistine God says I'm going to put all your enemies in front of me you're gonna destroy them all he's going to do it he said I will make you King and that's why when Saul was was persecuting David and he was kept on persecuting him David said even whenever Abisha was next to him and say just put the spear through him he said nah it's God's anointed one I will not kill him because it's not me that removes the king it's God that removes the king but see just a couple of chapters before this he knew who he was but then he got to such a place after after Jonathan and Hima split up and you could see their friendship they had a real deep friendship and he had heartache and he had now I don't understand why Saul wants to kill me I've lost my best friend whom I love so much and now I'm here with men that's all rejected from Israel basically came around me and and all they want to do is kill me so I'm going to take all these guys and I'm gonna go bat for the other team I'm gonna fight against Israel but what place is he now in now this is what I want to say is are we forgetting what God put in our heart we God put us and what the promise he put over you he says you're going to take a Rapture he said we'll have Great Fellowship together he says your brother is there for your Affliction for a season you know he says iron sharpens iron you know there's a reason we all gel so nicely together because we were designed to rub we were designed to get close and get get in each other's Comfort zones because if you get out of your comfort zone then God can start moving you but now David just goes to a a a Lucas his self-preservation and he says well I know that there's one guy that that fights against Saul and that would back me in this fight okay and I'm gonna go and support him now in the church not our church I don't know any politics and churches but in the church I've seen people turn against each other and take different opinions and form it to their little bit of opinion so that they can have a reasoning or a justification to what they do don't do that don't do that because what you're going to find is God will slowly let you in that in that permissive will because I believe as a Christian and this is not this is not brother bran versus me believing it is if you're on God's permissive will and you do something wrong God will still come and step in and guide you all the way back because you are predestinated for a certain outcome but the way he does it is not always nice it's not always nice so when you look at other Spirits you know like sickness why did I get sick after camp we go to Camp we're having a wonderful Jubilee and all of a sudden half of everyone there is sick and you go God but what have we done wrong no see that's the wrong attitude Armand it's not what have you done right what a wrong what have you done right you know and now you seek where you're going to go to now you just come from Camp I'm putting a half a trial on you and all of a sudden oh why don't you go Lord you know what thank you thank you you know yes I feel bad but you know what that doesn't matter but see what happened is we quickly forget just after a jubilee we walk out of them quickly we're back here and then we forget who we are and what what God said we are the bride the one that will overcome I wish I could explain to you overcoming overcoming for me is annihilating anything that's in front of you that's gonna get between you and your end goal overcoming is not trying to tiptoe Plus past a sleeping dragon or a lion there and going and then Reuben of course he goes steps on the biggest tweak and you're like oh and then you get to the other side and you're like I overcame nah overcome I say sit down done that's where you belong you you're not scared you're not intimidated you just you know you are you know where you're going that's an overcomer so that's not somebody that when sickness comes or when the evil spirit comes upon you you ask why we don't ask why we say Lord your will be done I still walk on okay the Overcomer there's no reasoning in here that you want to punish me God but when he does put it on you you just go where do you want me Lord yo your mindset change when you do that you where do you want me what do you want me to do do you want me to just sit down for a couple of days and be sick hey well then I sit down I'd be sick you know if I can't stand up I'm fine I'll be here but you know what something in me said I can't stand it I'm gonna go and do it anyways and you're limping and you're doing your thing and you go praise the Lord but you're going on we don't just die brother Isaac I look at you you your Priestess sermon your Gods so if you're a God if you're a God and the the almighty Creator The Sovereign God dwells within you just pause for a fake listen to this the almighty God created heavens and earth takes the time to come and dwell within you and then he says it will be so who can stop you who can stop you because it's not you speaking you just say Lord I'm not I'm not able but I'm available okay so now here David comes and he forgets who he is and he gets there and he goes to the king of akish and before that he Plays the Fool in front of him the Nile he is they're not completely used to survive okay then he goes back to that same King and he goes begs for a place to stay think about it and then he goes well King I will prove myself I will fight against the amalekites I will fight against all the borders I will claim your land I will make your name great he didn't say it in so many words but he was doing it because when he came with a report to the king of aches he said I've done all this I've made a way everywhere we just listened to it in the car I made a way for you then here comes the test because God now goes and he looks at David and he goes David you're not in your position and actually the things are not really going according to plan and you're backbiting and you're fighting and you're against people that I love and what are you doing there now make this personal you know Sticky Fingers you are not where I want you you know because sometimes we want to go for a job we go Lord can I have that job yesterday Lord if it's not going to be my job hey just just let it don't let it happen but you put it in but if you're really sincere you'll stop and say Lord I need an answer before I go ahead I need your answer shall I go shall I Stay shall I sign shall I not take your Bible open it up have a prayer meeting ever one and one with God when there's big decisions in your life should I go play that game on a Sunday or do you want me in church you know should I write this text message out of anger or should I pause and just think about it the only these times in your life where you you really want to do something and it's all boiling up inside but you forget to really ask the will of God because what we do is we we kind of make God do what we want him to do through us for other people which is not his will and and it's just a mess and then what happens is you you all start hurting people and you burn studies down and you burn relationships down and you hurt people's feelings but you don't want to do it because but I asked God but have you really stopped because I believe if David stopped here before he went to the the king of of of or akish before he really went there and he said okay alone every other battle I fought that I fought for you I said bring that your own Thunder bring the linen ephod let me pray I need your answer here Lord Saul's trying to kill me you know what Saul could not kill him even if he threw ten javelins that is it says Saul had it now if you know Men of War in the old days they didn't miss targets now if you really think about it they didn't miss talking their job was to kill people and to win because the thing is it was his life or your life so when Saul had his Javelin sitting at the table in his hand and David was about a couple of meters away from him how could he miss Ed twice and then he threw the same Javelin at his son and he couldn't even hit him but the thing is God will not let anything happen to you David just keep walking just keep trusting but David lost confidence in what God can do for him and that's when he started looking towards the Philistines don't lose confidence and I say it in a nice way don't lose confidence in this word and start looking at the world because there's only one true thing on this Earth and that's the word of God everything else I can tell you is fake fake they can make it look real they can make it look good it is fake it's engineered to distract you you little eaglets and the big eaglets and all the other eaglets okay think about it there is nothing I used to watch I used to watch wrestling oh boy I'll say it yes man and my favorite favorite character was was there was two it was rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin and one day these two guys made up and you know what happened Stone Cold Steve Austin was running towards the Rock and before he was even halfway to him the rock or rainy wind and Steve Austin still went and completed the move and fell over him and that's the day where I knew it was fake it was all scripted but before then I thought this is it man this is wrestling hey you know I loved wrestling but it's all that's how the world is but you can't see the fakeness if you're so entrapped with it all you'll see is what it is but when I took a step back and I went whoa let's rewind this one and I saw it again and I thought man this is fake and that's the last time I watched fatty because I really thought it was real I promise you I'm not lying I thought it was real but when I saw the fakeness of it and I was young to be my defense you know I was about nine years old I was like Liam's age and I really thought it was real and it shocked me that they would they would be fake you know and I stopped watching it now I hope you see that the world is fake and you stop watching it amen I encourage you the world's fake stop watching it distract you second is distract you it's going to get you to a ziglag moment because you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna do that now here we go here we go let's go all turn your Bibles brother Ed if you can put this one up I just want to find it I kind of go to is definitely number two here Proverbs 3 and we're gonna go the one to twelve so remember we're still with ziglag I'm about to close guys so just hang in there I don't want to make it too loud but we're still with z-glax so remember David is still sitting in a very tight spot because the king of akish is going to ask him to go fight against these people proverbs 3. Davey uh proverbs 3. and we're going to go verse one so so so remember the king of akish after this is actually or the king whoever he was one of the Philistine Kings he's going to ask David to go fight for him now against his own people now see what mind space David is is in at the moment he's so confused that he would fight his own people and he would willingly do it and even prove because it says there when he said that to him he says and I will even he says now oh that's the other one he says um uh chapter 286 and it came to pause though I have to tell you this in those days that the Philistines gathered the armies together for Warfare to fight with Israel and ake said unto David no thou assurity that thou shall go with me to the battle and thy men and David said to Achy surely thou shall know what thy servant can do now is a man of war and he sees to achies bro I'm going to destroy them I'm gonna I'm gonna destroy them so all these guys are so against them issues that says I want to destroy it I want to I just want to tell them something don't let God get on your case because what David had to go through was not nice to get him back on track to make him a king and if you're predestinated you will come regardless of what you think or where you are you will come God don't play games he does not play games so let's go to if you can put that up brother Ed please um Proverbs 3 and verse 1 and I've got a deal on my phone just so I don't miss it if I can foreign and this is this is Solomon now talking so now I say how all these things just died together he says my son forget not thy law but let thine heart keep my Commandments for length of days and for long life and for peace shall they add to thee so it says hey if you just stick with reading your word you pray and you just keep the Lord's commandments you'll have peace here you won't have battles you wanna you get tested but peace is not the fact that you're in a battle peace is how you feel in the battle okay so when you're in a trial and you are and it's a heavy fiery trial and your heart's all over the show and your emotions are up and down you're not having peace but if you're in a trial and you know that God has the trial you got peace you actually have peace and you know that whatever is going to happen in this trial God has control okay he says so shall you find favor and good understanding in the sight of God oh let not mercy and true forsake thee bind them about the neck right um write them upon the table of thine heart so shall thy find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and Men trust in the Lord with all thy heart and lean not to thine own understanding so David was leaning unto his own understanding okay he was going his way he didn't ask God he didn't consult God I'm pretty sure he just kind of had made a I just don't like that guy type of thing you know in all the ways acknowledge Him in all the way he did come on he look he looked at Saul like and he says sore men I could have killed you twice okay and then you make peace and then you still want to kill me like I'm over this brother like seriously every time I tell him God bless you he just shakes his hand away you know every time I want to want to give him a hug he wants to give me a bump you know and and it's it's just it's it's that attitude where you get to a point where you're tired but then you act out of the flesh you act out of your own understanding because you think if I apply it this way he'll get it it's not the way you have to go back to God you have to say Lord how can you help me get through this trial and help him get through the stroll that's the right attitude but we go on Amen I enjoyed that brother Ben in all the ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct your paths in all thy ways acknowledge Him God should I do this God what if I don't do this God should I go wash the car the rain clouds us out no you're wasting your time but I'll just go and do some fellowship you know like consult him in everything you do you cannot go wrong you cannot go wrong man should I take this job should I quote this job is it actually worth it Lord what would you do this is your business this is your life this is everything for you what would you want me do and wait don't go on with it wait wait till it tells you clear in the scriptures in the word yes son go that's that's how I would do it don't don't fill in anything and sign for anything until you hurt and you know God is with you because it's going to cause you grief he says some be not wise to their own understand to your own eyes fear the lord and depart from evil so basically stop watching YouTube and Twitter and all that nonsense get off those stuff there's no good that can come from it the only thing you should watch on YouTube is a sermon by Brother bean and all those Awesome Brothers out there you know if you're gonna do something if you're gonna use the internet use it for God okay if you need to find out how to make a table Brother Andy and all those things than it is for your business it's all fine but be careful because it quickly goes like this and before you see it you're not even at a table anymore you're flying to Hong Kong and seeing all the exotic animals you never knew before what am I doing you're not gone man I was looking at a table how does reason get to Hong Kong I don't know but it went that way okay everything goes to China so you go I go to China quite often oh praise the Lord hey man I do and I do I got Expressway there all right I definitely but I kinda I do it in a loving way so I go and trade for all of you as well bring some cool cheap gifts back um you see so um but late note that our own eyes via the uh what be not wise in our own eyes fear the lord and depart from Evil it shall be Health to thy navel and Marrow to thy bones honor the Lord with thy substance and with the first fruits of thy increase don't forget him when it's going good I don't forgive him when he's going good because you're going to need it when it's going bad so don't forget him when it's going good [Music] um my son despise not the chastising of the Lord neither be wary of his correction because he's gonna give you a makulupak's law if you're not in your place and it must hurt it must hurt it must give you a place where you can stop and realize that the almighty God is trying to get you attention to get you back on track because God would not have to give you correction if you're walking in his way he doesn't have to because you're in the way so when things start happening strange things and and a lot of things around you stop think pray get on your knees seek the scriptures say Lord what is going on here why why is my son doing this or why is my daughter doing this or why is my husband acting out or the boss all of a sudden had a situation man I never got in trouble at work no sense or I've got in trouble with plenty of times but but since I took a fleet manager role I used to always just you know nothing nothing it's all just cruisy we look after stuff the break we fix it we go on I never had a conflict or a or a real discussion with my boss was actually angry with me I hope he's not watching this but hey you know and all of a sudden one day I get to work and everything is wrong the workshops is wrong and I'm just hearing a little bit of a testimony he's angry at me the one of the workers is angry everything and I seriously have not done anything so maybe I should have done something I don't know but I haven't done anything and I stop halfway through the then again now Lord I said no no no no no something something's going on you want to move me here uh you got my attention but never have I come here and I got so much resistance never I was comfortable and then he goes no I don't want you to be comfortable I want to move you so I go back in the woods and I start going and I get into this book of David and Samuel by read David and I can identify exactly where I am find yourself in the scripture and I read God I you want my attention you got it what do you want me to do and all of a sudden he's starting to move things around me and I'm still not completely sure where he wants me to go but I know he's now doing the work so I'm waiting hands off saying Lord show me what to do but he got my attention because it was so rough that I knew that this is not normal this is not normal I walked into a Ziegler moment things were burning down man and I was like this is not normal so God wants your attention then you have to stop and get let him get your attention he says um so then in verse 10 so shall thy Barnes be filled with plenty and the priests show both a burst out with new wine so now we go back to David so and then I'm going to close with this because I'll leave my nose now because I know where I want to go thank you Lord so you find yourself in a place where you haven't heard from God for a while I don't know if anybody of you were there before but I was there like a Saul asks you know should we fight against the Philistine so what's going to happen and he gets no answer back because he sin you know and and God said to him just you know don't do this I think you shouldn't you should have killed what's his name um yeah a gag you should have just utterly destroyed him and he didn't and God said not not happy with you you know this is where it stops and now he gets to a place where he's actually in in in he wants the the Council of God and he goes seeks it through that that um Witch of indoor and he goes to a so desperate to hear from God but he still does it his way he doesn't wait he doesn't and he doesn't understand so he goes another Channel and Samuel says this day you'll you'll be tomorrow this time you and your son will be will be dead so has all gone to hell just to answer that question no okay what God says if you're saved you're saved you cannot be unsaved unless you grieve the Holy Spirit it says grieve not the Holy Spirit how you grieve the holy spirit is if you actually say I don't want you I and you openly cast say Lord I don't want your way okay that's the only way I feel my I'm saying it that you you push God totally away in your life okay but what happens is if God puts a evil spirit upon you like Saul Saul the evil spirit Came Upon Soul because he opened himself for it but God had to get David into position so he was going to use Saul as an instrument to get David into his position so don't get it wrong so if somebody gets really sick or somebody changes and they're a little bit angry and they get all my just pray for them because no matter what God does God does don't try to do God's work don't try to understand what he's doing just keep praying for that person because God might only anoint him for a season to push you into your position or somebody else close to them so don't get worried if somebody is looking like they're off the rails that's not God's final say if he said it's done it's done if he gave you the Holy Ghost if he sealed you to the day if you received a Redemption it's done he sealed you he will not unseal you and brother Benham if you want to question and answers he answers it I think it's in 59 because I went in there because I thought man how could he give um 59 12 19 questions and answers he says every spirit is subjected to God um just remember that and he speaks about Joseph fate and ayab and all how he made those prophets lie so don't you worry if somebody is acting out pray for them pray for them it's okay so you'll go David goes to goes to war and now he goes and he wants to fight gets to war and God is mindful to keep his word because he will not let the King fight his own people because that is a kingdom against itself divided amongst itself shall not stand cannot so if it works for Satan if it if Satan cannot be divided why would God fight his own people okay so God cannot break the scriptures so now he gets David right to the enemy line right to his friendly fire line I would say and he goes now and go back home and all the Philistine King says no man we don't want this guy because he's got a reputation you know we just lost 200 good soldiers just for a bit to get a wife you know so let's just let's just pull back boys this guy's dangerous he was he was so anointed man think about it huh so safe to go get me go get me the the four skins of 200 Philistines if you want um Michael if you want to just go get it he grabs a couple of guys and goes boys here we go there we go not doubting it comes back to underskins there you go you said 100 I got you 200. he's so anointed and now he's gonna go and fight against his own people and the enemy the enemy noticed there's something wrong not David the enemy stops and go Hawkeye boys something's wrong he killed Goliath he killed 200 of our finest men now all of a sudden he's standing here and he's fighting for us is there something wrong here and they say not sending him home and he regrettedly goes home now he gets to the ziglag moment and he sees everything is done and what happens he falls on his Rejoice he rejoices in the Lord and says Lord you know what it's happened but I now remember what I was supposed to do oh I was supposed to hate the Philistines because when he went to fight and he fought and he got everything back in that time the Philistines destroyed Seoul and Jonathan and he loved Jonathan so much and the News comes to David now and he's just come back from that war got everything back rejoicing spread this massive Slaughter he just got all cows and and animals and he gives it to everyone many gives to everyone okay that's how much he got back and more and then they come to him and they say soul and Jonathan's date and something just goes and he goes oh yeah are supposed to hate these guys I'm supposed to to destroy them supposed to be a king and he turns around and he starts becoming a king and he takes them in and he gathers to himself and he starts pushing up and he takes Judah back and he starts rolling ruling the house of Judah and he starts being being a leader but now all of a sudden a little situation where people wanted to Stone him turns around and now all of a sudden they go with him and within this time when they go and get everything from zekeg I hope you follow me I didn't lose you now he's going now to go get everything back that was taken from zieglag left 200 men behind then when the all 400 men came back because it was 600 400 came back and they said no we're not going to give these guys any of the spoil what did David do he goes if they fight or if they stay if they play or if they worship they all get the same if it's a preacher or a cleaner or a evangelist or a prophet or whatever don't you worry I just want you all just to just remember I if if we come to the word of God you get the same get the same we don't get less or more we don't get more healing because you're a pastor sorry brother being you know you don't get you don't because you stand here and you're this massive cool awesome song leader then then when the trial comes he goes I remember Lord I'm a song leader and he gives you more we all the same I'm not saying anything bad I want you to realize there's no big or small we don't need a little platform here to get someone higher and closer to God we're all the same the only thing is the gift that God placed in your midst respected your pastor because he's the one that has the closest contact with God for the will for us here as Shekinah and that's it why this one in taranaki and that's why there's one in Auckland or two or three or four now that's why God faces them everywhere because they're different people in different places and God takes a different lure to keep you in your place because what happens in this church might not be the same as with taranaki and we don't we we won't you know our fellowship is different than these and same as with Auckland we are made different that's the reason for it but the man himself brother being bleached just like us he prays just like you you know he's got also frustrations I know him I I had a privilege of you know being close to him for a couple of years and man praise the Lord thank you for that man you know um so I just want to tell you and I don't want to lose the trait of this David hit a Ziegler moment and things were going wrong in his life because he wasn't in where God wanted him but you know what if he didn't stop and rejoice in the Lord and got back to where God wanted him then he would have lost all but see God being mindful of this said I will move you I will move Havens and Earth I will get you in your place if it hurts sorry brother Ben has a cool testimony I wish he shares it one day that he he's like and it got you out of work for how long ACC and you were just you're just like I just don't know why do any weeks you just stopped me but you knew it was God stopping you what did you start doing you start praying say Lord why am I here what what's going on you know and that's how we should be but pushing on in your own strength keep going on don't give up don't go lie down and uh and why me why now you know just don't do that all you have to do is just keep push forward but keep in mind this if something happens in your life what does God want from you because if you don't act on it he's going to bring you a trial he's going to bring you a Ziegler moment he's going to stop you on your tracks and he's going to get you back in that way but praise the Lord he does do that or else we would we be amen um yeah maybe last thing and then you know musicians you can come up maybe the last thing I want you to realize is I was in the world okay here's my here's my clothes I was in the world hey man I love you guys I I did a lot of stupid things okay you children Liam Reuben Jonah Abes Malachi Rebecca Danny Jay Noel Mercy Faith Daniel uh Davey got you Debbie you were hiding there behind sharing this sister Shannon I tell you something Jonah got you two who else did I miss Joshua AMA katyama welcome God bless you when you when you go into the world when you start looking at things you shouldn't look I want to get your attention it will distract you from who you really are think about King David he's a king anointed by God chosen by God to be a king of Israel and he came to a place where he forgot who he was but God had to bring such a great event in his life that it had to the the they they cried so much when they saw their family was gone they cried so much they didn't have energy they didn't have any any strength left they they were gone they were so drained with this event and emotionally drained and God did that to get their attention to say don't do it your way so I encourage all of us stay off devices as much as you can get away from YouTube Pinterest is a bunch of nonsense I'm talking to the kids this is my burden is you David forgot his identity and if it was different he could have lost his wife and kids if God wasn't merciful because they were already gone what if they came to Ziegler and everything was destroyed just to make this to get him back in his place so I'm telling you stay with those things you know why don't you put I encourage you why don't you just take a phone whoever has a phone thank the Lord Reuben you'll get one just after the Rapture and Liam YouTube take your phone for a week I'm I encourage you put it at do not disturb from four o'clock the afternoon to the next morning nine o'clock kids parents may be here from eight because you've got jobs and everything from F4 to eight you know just put on dinner if somebody wants to reach you they'll call you twice okay and just put the sound spend time with your family spend time with God because we are so entrapped with this world we're actually forgetting Who We Are we're forgetting our we're forgetting where our strength lies we forget the power of prayer we forget that actually I've got a brother that still needs to come in we forget that I've got a family that needs healing and prayer I forget that these people on the other side of the world struggling because I'm so lost In This Moment then I forget my identity please do it I I encourage you please put it down it would be the greatest blessing I'm telling you now that would happen to you forget books Forget music you know what seriously even if you stop music for a week give your brain a chance to think on the Lord it says meditate upon the word how can you meditate if your head is spinning at a million miles a moment every day spinning spinning spinning spinning the song that song this that this read this do that how can you meditate upon the word of God if everything in here is everywhere out there how can you have peace how can you say Lord you know what thank you for this awesome day you know what Jonah could have gotten really hurt thank you Lord for protecting him because then the little things you start seeing God but when you're on all these other things there is no God because you're so busy you don't think about it so how is it having a relationship with God if it's only coming from one place only from him how's that a relationship there was a thief that got into the back part of Heaven he come through a window got into the The Waiting feast okay he was a brother let's call him a brother brother without a waiting robe you know garment or whatever and Jesus comes and he looks at this man and he says Hey where's your rope how did you get here and he said I came by the window okay guys take him through him out I don't know you you worker of iniquity I don't know you you don't know me because if you knew me you knew you had to come through the door so I don't want to turn this into a bed I just want you to realize that that busyness got David in a Ziegler moment where he had to look at destruction of a city that he owned which was not his in the first place but it's still to the tribal Judah this day and he and he was looking at that City and he was in such a way that he was thinking he's a Philistine I'm a worldly person I belong in soccer and I belong in cricket and I belong in music and and this is my genre and this is my identity because what happens is he got distracted and because he couldn't find Joy there because he wasn't wanting to find Joy there he went to find Joy there he wanted to find peace in the Philistine camp because all David wanted was peace I just want peace God I want peace I don't want soul to try to kill me every day I don't want to be like a vagabond year and day and then there and I just want my family I just want peace but he was in the wrong camp and that's where our Lord Jesus Christ steps in and he starts moving you but you don't need to go there so I encourage you put those things down put the things of the world down put anything that will distract you down put it down seek first the kingdom of God you will never ever ever be disappointed go take proverbs 3. stick it on your fridge stick it on your wall it's a promise if you keep my Commandments I will guide you all the way there if you meditate upon the Lord he will come down he will meet with you if you pray without seizing pray without ceasing is walking and talking to God every day of your life [Music] take phones away take emails away take anything that would distract you after fall because guess what by the time you get to nine o'clock you haven't done anything for the Lord not one thing because we have to mow lawn we have to get everything ready then we have to quickly say hey family prayer all in a bed another but you not you have not communed with your lord get to 10 o'clock you're sitting there on the bed okay it's to 11 o'clock where's your time with the Lord but we're quick to do this just to do more videos [Music] I'm not a liar I I do this as well but when the god when God corrects you when God shows you the way when he gives you a zekeg moment and he says to you I don't want you to do this don't do it don't do it this is not me speaking this was not in my notes my notes was if you come to a place where God moves you stop and ask him where that was my notes my notes wasn't this stuff but I do feel that this is a big a big hinderest keep playing that song sister Diana I want to encourage you tonight close your eyes it's not even nine o'clock we still win plenty of time close your eyes don't look at anyone okay if you feel in your heart I don't want uplifted hands I don't want anything like that I want you to clearly think about your life tonight think about the amount of time you spent outside fellowship with the Lord so all I want you to do is think how many times your mind goes to work to soccer to to music to anything that is not from the Lord [Music] now think about the times when you were praying in your room or when you were praying with someone you could feel God drop down right there right there you could feel the presence of the almighty God coming to that room we had a pre-meaning of brother binster one night and it was the most amazing feeling knowing that deity just entered the room don't you want to be in that place every day don't you want to be in a place where your mind is so clear then when God says I want you to move I want you to pray for brother Armando I want you to go to sister tipian say to her I love her do you not want to hear the word of God come to you personally and saying my child I want you to do something for me do you want to be in that space or do you want to just flick to the next video what do you want tonight what do you want because God can deliver you from that right now right now he can take that desire out of you right now you confess it unto the Lord I don't want to I don't want anything fancy I want the real moment between you and God and say Lord search my life right now right now and tell me how can I go a little bit closer to you what can I let go to receive more of you I want to give myself away tonight I want to give myself away to you Lord Jesus if there's anybody that is here tonight and just want to ask the Lord you can uplift your head nobody watch please look down say Lord Jesus I know I am at that David moment where things are happening and confusion is in my heart and I don't quite understand what I'm doing here and I've got to ought either against a brother or a sister or or I'm actually in a point Lord where this device is taking over my life it's actually running my mind and keeping it busy I have no Clarity of thought I have no singleness of Mind Lord I need I need a reset Lord I just need a bit of a reset I need your peace I need your I need your Holy Spirit to just come in and search me and take all this trust and bring it to the top and so it can be scooped off tonight and the Sea of your forgetfulness Lord and show me and teach me your way in your statutes Lord so that I can move away from this if there's anyone like that you raise your hand to the Lord tonight and you pray I pray we all pray now together musicians keep playing please we all pray together you don't have to pray loud just by yourself I'll start the prayer off but I want you to have a one-on-one with God tonight and so Lord I'm at that ziglag moment I have lost a bit of my identity I am confused Lord I'm seeing more things out there than things in your word turn me back lord turn me back lord Jesus Lord give me that desire that real desire for you increase that Lord give me more faith give me more strength Lord to stay against these things of the world time is no more if you ever want to listen to a sermon listen to the flashing red light time is no more so I encourage you tonight have a one-on-one with God right now in your seat I will start praying and then you just say Lord Jesus here I am Lord I want you to come and clean me out Lord but I want you to give me overcoming power to overcome devices to come overcome complexes Lord to overcome past hurts to overcome confusion father I want to stop me tonight Lord in my track Lord and give me a real experience with you Lord that I know that I know that you got this Lord I know that I know this enemy has been cut

all their ways the Lord Jesus I pray be merciful tonight Lord I pray Lord that you would come and have your way tonight Lord Jesus and and come to our personal door knock on it Lord and say I am here
