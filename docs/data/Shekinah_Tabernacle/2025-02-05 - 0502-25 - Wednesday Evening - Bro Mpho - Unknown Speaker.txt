musicians and uh I think you are free to to sit I was hoping brother James sorry to put on the spot James I was hoping you they'll manage to to display I don't have a PowerPoint H but I had I've got a Word document thank you so much so I was praying that maybe you know the better most better skills than I they can get but be that as it may if you don't have a display I'll just be reading for you while we standing let's just read the scripture how many are happy to be here tonight and I pray that you have come prayed up that is my prayer because I've come prayed up and I want to believe that you have come pray them because that stimulates your expectation amen you pray you say Lord doesn't matter who's speaking tonight it's not about a person or a man it's about you speaking so I'm praying that if you can use a stone can you use that brother tonight that it it it raises your expectation before the Lord and then you'll see God will just use a dead stone amen and let's just read while we standing in the book of U John we'll read two scriptures then then I'll let you see down John chapter 17 amen John 17 Hallelujah once you get it you can just confirm by saying amen am the Bible says in the Book of John verse 17:3 and this is and this is life eternal that they might Know Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou H has sent I want to focus on that part that says and this is eternal life that they might know amen that's what we going to focus on tonight let's read Philippians chapter 3 Philippians 3 and then I promise you you see down Philippians 3 verse 9 oh James you're good man thank you son put under pressure okay the Bible says from verse 9 to verse 10 and he found in him not knowing mine own righteousness which is is of the law but that which is though the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith verse 10 please listen attentively to verse 10 that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sick of his suffering being made conformable unto his death let's pray together our heavenly father Lord Jesus Lord thank you for dying at the cross for us thank you for such a wonderful sacrifice Lord we would have been lost but father because you knew us before the foundation of the world Lord you knew us before you formed even this the universe you knew us father and you knew us by name and you predestinated us father that the fact that you knew us Lord just give us courage tonight to know you as well and I pray my heavenly father tonight that you'll bless us as a collective that you'll bless us as individuals that you can speak to us as a church that you can speak to us as individuals you are a personal god father and Lord I believe that tonight as you speak your children will benefit something and they'll take something home Lord bless bless every ear and every heart and bless the speaker as well father forgive us our wrongs and our mistakes because we are born in sin shaped in iniquity without you lord there's nothing good in us and I pray therefore my father my God that we confess our sins we confess our our secret faults Lord even those that are hidden from us I pray that you wipe them up with your blood settle your children father and I pray as we invite you and welcome you in our midst in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you please enjoy the comfort of your seeds so um tonight I would like to speak about the subject called to know him is life eternal to know him is life I I didn't hear this side to know him is life ET Eternal so forgive me once more once again I like to interact and talk to people you know as we as we speak but um I so much wish brother Ben that the friend SE were filled you know that's my my my prayer my desire but I understand you sit where you are comfortable you see to know Jesus I I'm taking it along the side that says you know in the Bible the Bible will say that and so and so knew his wife and he bore him a son and then he knew him he knew her and he bore him a daughter that's the kind of knowing that I'm talking about in the spiritual realm I'm talking about knowing Jesus intimately knowing him not not not feeling him not feeling like you have him you know knowing him because to know him is life the Bible says are we together so in the spiritual realm things do happen you know the scripture that says if you look to a woman and you last after her you have already committed adultery with that D if you last after him so there has been a connection but physically you were just walking or sitting or whatever you were doing you haven't done anything physically but the Lord says you have already committed sin how in the spiritual realm are we together and that's what I'm talking about that we need to know Jesus Christ that intimate until you and him me and him are one because that's what he said I will be in you you in me and we will be one you agree with me amen I I want us to walk together so because you see to know your church or to know your pastor to know your Deacon to know your friends to know even I like what other friend I listen to a seron this afternoon he just said what I wanted to say if I'll even tell you that to know the Bible that cannot give you eternal life just to know the Bible many people know the Bible the theologians they know it better than me and you even the devil he knows the Bible so even to know the Bible and the spoken words Cote from cover to cover to know it in that knowledge mental knowledge won't give you eternal life but I'm talking about the knowing of knowing him that will bear him a son the knowing that will bear fruits we together let's just move on a little bit now I like what Philippians Paul says in the Philippians in the book of Philippians he says sorry what we read he said that I may know him and the power of his resurrection because you see no man ever prophesied his own death and then he die he told us first that I'm going to rise and then he rise for real no one only Jesus could do that so there's power in there the power of his resurrection so let's just look at this little subject because tonight is prayer meeting as brother Aran said I won't take long and hopefully we'll be we'll be done H in time I want to read for to bring you to your attention to what I call the middle cycle the middle you know a cycle the middle cycle anointing brother teaches us in the book of The Thinking men's filter that you know we know the three circles the soul the spirit and the the brother was preaching about it the other day and the outer body the body now he says in that book you know the devil or the Holy Ghost not the devil the Holy Ghost is is able to anoint you and you even on your your your spirit and you do things and you are you are a son of God I like brother Greg Greg preached here some time ago the old old church he said you know the sin question is settled there's no debate about who you are and who I am there's no debate about that you are a born son and daughter of God that is no question that is not a debate the issue is to know him the issue is to to know him in the power and the power of his resurrection that's the issue I'll show you so let's just take step by step he says you know the the the how that the spirit on the outside between the soul and the body can be absolutely Anointed with the Holy Ghost did you all understand that he he asked the congregation now to follow that to follow it up with the continuity of the message he was talking about the message that he preached a few days ago or a day before the god the God of this world and the anointed ones in this last day he says that outside that outside that middle circle first circle is the the human senses feel touch smell right the second circle is the spirit senses willpower you know we know those senses right he says there you can be anointed there and then you you think that you you are anointed in the inner Circle the very Inner Circle and you do things and you are a son of God when you are not yet there you know that I'm not here to judge you right I'm just here to encourage you to remind you that it doesn't stop at sanctification it does it doesn't stop at justification no it goes to the Inner Circle to the inside and that's what me and you has to Avail ourselves and until God absorbs Us in the Inner Circle and he he he adopts us we will see let me not go ahead of myself you understand so so so so so it's very dangerous that's not what we want in the the end results brother Ben what we want is that the Holy Ghost can go deeper to the heart of your of your being in the soul then then you you you know him because you and him are one you think the same thoughts you act the same way so wonderful I look at you and we are we live life outside here I see people brothers and sisters are acting the same I say ah Lord thank you for confirming because people who are the same you see them that they think the same if you've got spiritual eyes you see that they act the same they behave the same you can see that this one ah this is my brother or my sister because you don't you don't search them and investigate them amen amen so let's just go to the next quotation I I put my own title subtitles I say here adoption fulfills knowing him your adoption it fulfills is the manifestation of actually knowing him what do I mean by that what I mean is that H I'll read for you uh brother Brenham says in this spoken word called um everlasting life and how to receive it he says h and a man in the Old Testament when he had a son born into his house you know the story he you know the process of adoption right he do you know it yes I can tell you now the process of adoption listen to the to the man of God here he says he was he was a he says um let me start again sorry and a man in the Old Testament when he had a son born in his house he was a son when he was born this son right but but there was a choor raised that that child until they come to a certain age right then if this chor was brought with the way to the father that the child was worthy and all and all right and everything now it had he was he was the he was then adopted into the family you are part of the family no question about that but you are coming to a point of adoption where your sick nature and God's sick nature is the same your will and God's will is the same your thoughts you remember the Lord said my thoughts are not your thoughts so you come to the point where now your thoughts are the same thoughts with God's thoughts you think the same way that God thinks about his children you think the same way that God thinks about his weight you think the same When God says I feel I want to be praised you praise him he comes to you to praise him because that is God's thoughts are we together so this young man but if he was the prophet says here he was adopted into the family but if he wasn't He Still Remains a son but he wasn't adopted so it's very important brothers and sisters to make sure that the Lord adopts you are adopted in the family and by the way that is all his work not much about what me and you can do all what me and you can do is to surrender total obedience and total surrender to him with everything then you wait and see amen God adopted his own son let me just back check a bit and then he's adopted in the family it means that now H meant just the same as his daddy and then this boy sign nature on the check meant just as same as his daddy just the same for he was adopted in full Fellowship into the family amen so God adopted his own son when he took him up took Peter James and John as Witnesses amen and I wrote it reminded me of justification sanctification and baptismal of the Holy Spirit and the Bible says there's three Witnesses even here on Earth water blood and the spirit can you see that the pattern can you see you get baptized wash through the blood you forgiven your sins and everything you're in then you get baptized that is why even as human beings we've got three circles outer middle IM inside because the water also washes outside isn't it so it correspond in the mouth of two or two witnesses okay I'll jump this part I'll jump this part because I want to make sure tonight that I I I don't I don't go over the time let's get to the next quotation here you need the soulmate you need someone heart to heart you know husband and wife they've got a Ministry they to a point where you know their hearts they aligned their minds everything when they get into that inner chamber in that inner bedroom they you know the their thinking is the same nowadays children can manipulate mother and father and and say oh Father and just they they analyze the strong strong strong points of the father and of the mother and they see who's lenient on what area and they play around but if we are aligned I already know know when you come to me what mama would have told you that's right or when you go to to death you already Mama already you know you go to Mama or you go to De the both of them give you the same answer but the key is not just that the key is to be even spiritually aligned together because that's how us and Christ ought to be we are like that amen you need to have that soulmate who is our Lord Jesus Christ inside your soul not Spirit mate not flesh made amen and he says here in The Invisible Union of the Bride he says and and that's my message to you Church you that's the that's a union a spiritual union by the word that you are dead to this old husbands you are born a new don't try to dig him up he's dead if you are a born again Christian that little gam that was predestinated to you is word coming on word amen wait on word wa on word wait on word come into full St of Christ that's right so he can come get his bride now we are just ready for one thing that's the coming of the Lord once we get there precept upon precept word upon word then we we are ready for his coming we we are just ready we we will know that now we are going is our time to go now because he will also be knowing the same thing that is ready they are ready now to come home amen that Union must take place while we are here it must take place while we are here because we cannot you cannot Rapture without being in the union already James and Tiana blessing and and and Mimi they already in a union what is left is only the manifestation of the marriage the the what you call your official but brother says the moment you engaged to her you are as good as married because we are still living in flesh we we just formalize things but they are already husband and wife they're just waiting for the pastor to pronounce you see sorry to give you an example with you my children but you understand it by now you understand me but I just wanted to give that example that me and you and the bride we are already taken up by him all what we are waiting for is to go to the honeymoon so do not being a Son of God predestinated born in the family do not let him down by being because by by by remaining behind or by manifesting the fruits that are not what you have been born into I I hope you understand me are we together I hope you see it all believers that comes through the blood into the body of Jesus Christ worship God through the shed blood and Jes of Jesus Christ in line they are positionally placed in Christ you see how do we get in what wish we had time I wish we had time for it about six more minutes look how do we get into Christ by one Spirit now if one Fellowship no no no the the first thing the first thing thing comes first by one Church he's putting a question mark by one Church obviously no by one letter no but by one Creed no by by but by one Spirit we are all baptized into the body not by water not by power not by might by but by my spirit say the Lord one Spirit we are baptized what by the spirit where does the spirit say where is life in the blood coming through the blood of Christ so you see it's a process it's a process water blood baptism in the Inner Circle in the inner Inner Circle where your affections your thought because sometimes okay let me leave that one I'll leave that one let me talk to you about being POS positionally placed then we close now positional placement is that now you are taking your rightful position someone may ask our brother po do you mean that when I was born in the family or when Jesus was born on Earth he was not the Son of God he was but even when he was baptized he was already a Son of God and the Spirit came as the dove but there was a time when he went to the mountain God brought him there Peter James and John were there as Witnesses and he was adopted am I teaching too much Doctrine tonight positionally placed they don't know what they are he's talking about people out in the world you are Sons and Daughters of God and a lot of times you are looking for something great to come but you already got you already got that the greatest can be given you now we are the sons of God I like to say and daughters not we will be we are now now right now we are daughters and sons of we right now that's where you should me and you are do you believe that the enemy must not give you the thoughts of doubting that ah no no you believe it it's like that you doubt it is not like that amen now and we are seated together in Heavenly places the scripture does not say we are going to be seated together it says we are already seated I wanted to preach the same one brother Ben where I was going to talk about access to Heaven life you know living in heaven but here on Earth I wanted to that was just on my heart but the Lord just I don't know what happened it was so much on my heart to talk to you about being in heaven while on Earth because people are already in Hell while on Earth so living in heaven while on Earth I don't want to to die you allow me just to take a little Loop you know to to live like a king and a queen here on Earth despite all the challenges of the devil but when you want to call Heaven you don't even need air time you you access heaven and because you are a son and a daughter of God you are you already seated you don't conduct yourself like a a disillusioned desperately hopeless person you are a son of God the suffering that you are going through they just like joy to you because they bring Glory and Honor I don't know brother AR how many of us when we go through hard painful time can say glory to God God thank you Lord bring it on because you will take me through we need if we come to that point they say in English it's easier said than done but I say to you it's easier to believe than and to be done it gets what what how can I put it if you believe it it's easy you believe it is it happens as you believe it because God said it you see God is not a liar God we were singing beautiful songs here I'm not sure how many of us when we sing those song do we really internalize them you read through them and you say wow wow that was the real inspiration when those songs they talking about you and they're talking about me those songs are real the Bible is so real that the word of God everything that is said in here is a promise to you so powerful it is God is so big that our mind and our ideas cannot imagine him so once you get to the point of believing him fully in his word you realize that ah up for me until Paul said you know what for me to live is Christ and to die is gain I don't lose in this battle I'm not I'm not losing because you are a son of God when when you go through that heavy heavy heavy moment and you know what your wife just see you smiling or your husband say what how can so no you know what we are the winners and that frustrates the devil heavy because you confessing the word of God and God is not I put a status today it blessed me so much he says God is not a man that he should lie he's not in the book of I think is numbers 23 he's not a man God what he said about you will happen despite your you are you are failures or anything that is why he made think if I was in the corporate you know in the business environment I would say he has put systems in place for you to make for for his word to be fulfilled what we are doing here tonight coming to church is part of the process of God for me and you to bring the the full manifestation of what he said because he saw us even sitting here in this church tonight so we better than believe it because there's no going back you are the Son of God already so you can't help it even a man called called A Jonah he tried but he once born a prophet you are a prophet of God God can change his word once a Son of God you are a son of God so you if he says you will go through here you will go through here why you are going to cry you better just laugh and smile them because you are you I can't say you are stuck with him you are his son so you better me and you come the way that he said the way that he said he will bring us because in the first place we can't bring us ourselves through he will pull you through and see you through right are we together brothers and sisters do we believe it let's read let's read uh one more about being positionally placed um from Israel and the church part two now we are the sons of God when now tomorrow night no right now we are the sons of God did I read this one oh no no I didn't read this one so this is repeating the one I read earlier was from expectations so now this one comes from the spoken of Israel and the church now now we are the sons of God now we are seated together in Heavenly places right now now when now now we have eternal life will you get eternal life when you die brother bham they're asking him he says no I have it now I now possess it how Jesus Christ said so that said the Lord so it's not a time for me and you to question is a time for me and you to make sure that our salvation is sure and we we we we are in the knowledge of him knowing him not just theoretically knowing him in the way husband and wife will know one another spiritually that it's like that exactly it's intimately like that amen because you are his wife right let's just talk about the last quotation and then we are going to pray I call this subtitle the Inner Room knowing him the Inner Room knowing him then they come into the second Veil that was that was where M where where Martin Luther preached justification Wesley preached sanctification the second Veil where the altar Sanctified the vessels the third room house first we where where you come into the kitchen you only live in a you only live in a three-bedroom house you say mine's got 10 well you just got some extras see you just got a three room house that's all you can leave in the kitchen living room and bedroom you eat in the kitchen you commune in the living room and then you rest in the bedroom in there when you know him is a you you are at his rest it is peace in other words nothing makes you panic nothing takes you by surprise because all what is happening now in your life around you has already been prophesied has already been told to you has already been said that we will see what we are seeing today you it was already been prophesied that you are going to live here and you are going to Rapture it's it's a done deal so there's no second thoughts that you should be thinking oh Lord I'm struggling so much I wonder if I will make it no no there's no discussion about that just get in know him amen amen that's where the church has come it it comes through Martin Luther just the just shall live by faith wly communion sanctification cleansing up and now we are in the baptism of the Holy Spirit I will give you the rest unto your soul I will give you the rest unto your soul he says when a man went into his inner Veil a second Veil and he was hid from the world the curtains dropped around him and when he he can lose what now when we can lose ourselves in Jesus Christ I don't care what your denomination is that them things don't bother you anymore because you have losed yourself you have losen yourself you know the Bible says if you lose your life you just lose him you just lose it and you just sit here on the edge you put yourself so vulnerable because you know that in his hands you'll never fail he will never fail he says if you do that you're going to and you fall that's what he's going to do you'll never you know the mother eagle goes top top top top of the sky and then he he takes his two children and then today the eagle has star at her nest they're going to fly she takes them up and the higher you go the colder it becomes and then he leaves them cuz he was holding them she leaves them there and not they have to fly one thing is very they won't touch the ground the only thing the eagle must do is to know that I am an eagle and I have to fly crying folding hands not praying looking at each other wrongly allowing the Devil want help you flying like Eagle cu the when you start flying you go higher you even see better huh the more the more the more someone draws a smaller Circle you draw a bigger Circle of Love cuz that's the thing about the brothers and sisters love is so powerful man love is so powerful that actually it doesn't see no no no no wrong love doesn't see no wrong it doesn't see no evil see you see if a Minister stands here he allow himself before God and he just lose himself and he just love the people and not have no pre preconceived ideas and thoughts and things he just love them and the people do the same you know what's going to happen an explosion is going to come the devil is going to be blown away with a motor bomb because he he cannot just he can't love so love is so strong that until the Bible said God is love he said God is love because he first loved me and you he first loved the world he is love he loves the unlovable huh isn't that wonderful so me and you must love the unlovable the dirty ones the dirty ones that when you pass they stink those ones you hug and take them to your house right forget about your brothers and sisters that one is not even a question about those ones out there that you think ha those ones and serve them food cuz in there there's a Son of God there's a daughter of there's your brother in there you can't see him with his eyes but there's your brother inside it's hard for this flesh but once you get insight why do you think Martin Luther was it Martin Luther who cut his jacket in half and give that man on the street sleeping s St Martin he did that walking on the street realize that this man is freezing on the street he took off his jacket cut it half with his sword and give this man on the street so I I spoke about losing yourself I'll finish up with this one brother go onto the inner Veil God is the light in there it always light the Shak Glory lit up that place and never did go out because the out the light on the middle room H it can it can it can go out it can it can you can need to blow it up and remove you know and and do this and that the light the light in the middle room but not in the in the in the Shak glory in the Inner Room the the Inner Room the light there even the Mana put there remains fresh even the Aron Aron Aron stick it BS in there is a different world and guess what you are still here on Earth physically but you are you are living in the Shak Glory your manner is always fresh ah because that the light in there is life it doesn't die out that's where we are brothers and sisters I'll read for you in closing Philippians 3:14 Philippians 3:14 I'll read it for you just to encourage you you can put your name there and say Paul now I press toward the mark of the price for the price of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus now that's what me and you are going to do to press towards the to press the mark for the price of a high calling let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if in anything he be otherwise minded God shall reveal this unto [Music] you Hallelujah so I want to say to you know him let him know you know him in my language they say it's like don't second guess yourself no no no no don't second guess yourself be a true daughter and a true Son of God doesn't matter who thinks what about you be a truer you do your part forget about what is around you that boy who won the race they say he focused he focused his eyes there at the end and then he rode and he never fell but everybody who focus on the side on this left it's not like those people are not there or those problems are not there they are there and they'll always be there because we fight against our our our what do we call him our accuser he's there until the day we go home then he will be there no more but until then we keep on working him with the word it is written it is written have you realized that the more you say it is written it is written it is written get the behind me Satan before you know it is not there did you know he's not there anymore but the more you entertain him your eyes are not focused there at the end can you see what I'm saying so we need to put our eyes at the end Hallelujah so that is just my closing
