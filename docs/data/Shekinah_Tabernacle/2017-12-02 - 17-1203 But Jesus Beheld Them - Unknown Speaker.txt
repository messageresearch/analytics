father may you grant it Lord we want to commit the service into your heads lest i anoint your word bless it to our souls Father in Jesus Christ they may you grab that amen amen amen good morning everyone it's great to have everyone here god bless you welcome welcome to this part of the world trust you feel at home god bless you good to have all the visitors here if you could just have your seats we're just going to have a bit of housekeeping before we turn to the scripture so we've had a you know the church has evolved from the 11 er you know a living of us that we had in the very beginning five years ago there's a few more of us now and so I've been wanting to kind of just place everything in its order but also to see the church evolve you're the officers in the church how they operate to see them evolve into how the Bible of the message says a church should function and so a part of that is um so brother could bin if you could come up here please come stand by my side I mean so as we all know brother Campinas our deacon we love him dearly and but we know that we know that it's not only that we love him but I believe that he's a real deacon and we've all seen him how he operates how he conducts himself you know he doesn't he doesn't you know he he handles every situation in a very godly manner and that's very important because we know a deacon as the policeman of the church he's here to keep the order of the church and you know make sure that everything is how it should be this is a deacons responsibility a deacon is not a glorified uh sure you know I'm just laying these things out because we need to be reminded of these things this is I want to empower every officer in the church they can function how they should so a deacon is not a glorified uh sure so brother could be and he can delegate this job even though he does it very well and you see his training in warehousing to put everything in its place and you can see that there's been training for for this place but the families in the right place so it all works out but that's not as main function as main function is to be a policeman of the church to to keep order that when the word is going forth or witness you know singing is happening that that this order in place so it's not there's nothing in place that can disrupt the spirit moving because we all want to have an environment where God is welcome and God comes down and God meets us this this is what we want this is why we have things in place that's why we have church order and so so if he wishes to delegate the job of ushering you're welcome to do that should you wish do so if you get deputized it's um that that's that's all up to to to brother convene so now and and the message God hiding himself in simplicity brother brems dedicating the expansion of the tabernacle before he preaches the seals and he says and any any scissors is now this may seem a little rude but this is not a place to visit he's speaking of the sanctuary of the church now we know we don't have a sealed-off sanctuary we can't put a wall in the landlord won't let us do it and even if we did would be too small you know but this is this is a place this is God's place we've we've dedicated this for the service of God and there's plenty of other places where we can go visit each other and the wonderful thing about us is I believe there's no cliques among us we all love each other we would love to spend time with each other we love to talk to each other so it's hard to separate and go our separate ways after a service bishop when God comes down we're all happy and we're being delivered and we feel you know rejoicing and you know we want to have fellowship and so on but this is not the place to have that after service okay so you can go we have put a black line on the wall you know on the floor so feel free to have fellowship that side of the line or go on to the kitchen or go outside you're more than what but please do do not speak in here say God bless you hello but you know keep it to a bare minimum if you want to have any kind of discussion please take it out he says now it's not a place to visit it's a place of worship we should never even murmur a word inside here outside of worship to one another unless it's absolutely necessary see we should never rally around we should never run through the building or let our children run through the building and so doing this feeling not long ago that of doing this we constructed it so we could take care of all that now we can't do that but we still want to have the same thing implemented okay because we should respect you know you know this place here we pay the same rent as we did downstairs and it's far bigger God as God has been good do you say well that's just a natural thing I believe God inspired the landlord who's not even a believer that I know of to allow us to have this place and Rick and and if you ever search for rent for anywhere else it's far more expensive we couldn't afford it so I believe God has given this to us and we don't have to sit up and pack up every service and you know have a hall or someplace we're gonna place it's always set up it's always dedicated to the service of God so I think we should appreciate this place you know I know you do but I think we should appreciate it more thank you Lord that you've allowed us to have this this little place amen and so now we have the city of course many people are strangers that Tabernacle folks know this that the building's going to be dedicated to the service of the Almighty therefore dedicating ourselves let's remember when we enter that sanctuary be still to one another and worship God so when you come in this door please just this is the sanctuary of God okay now and if you want to visit each other there are places that you may visit each other but never walking around where you can't hear yourself thinking that some person comes and they just don't know what to do see there's so much noise and things it's just humanly I've seen it in churches until it makes me feel real bad because we don't come into the sanctuary Lord to meet each other we come here to worship God then we go to our homes this sanctuary is dedicated to worship amen and then he says and then this is from church order and then I'm so a deacon is asking a question he says now in respect to the order of the church we try to do according to the way we understood it given in the dedication of the new church so there's what I just read so this is after this and now our deacons putting question to brother Brown he says now that's correct you're doing right now this is supposed to be deacons I suppose cause it's right here it's a deacons job to keep the order it's not my job to keep the order of the church my job is dedicated to spiritual things the word the Deacons did a cap to keep the order of the church trustees are the finances and to look after the building Sunday School Superintendent the teachers there for the Sunday school music and audio that's their job musicians that's their job you see so we're gonna I wanted to see it all separate it out because I'm wearing too many hats and I still hold on to these heads I need to let go because as part of why we're doing this now so it's a deacons job and by doing so so there's a person saying we have often people often get mad at us then brother ham says they do it me too they'll do it any man see that person that does that there's something wrong with that person so if brother could be a member it's the office even if it's my children it doesn't matter hood as if brother convinces can you please and you've seen him I'm sure you've seen him in the past he doesn't come in as first little whimper you know commands you to drag them out he comes in a godly way he comes in a respectful way I mean I'm sure you've all seen it so when he comes you he doesn't have a you know he doesn't have a bone to pick with you it doesn't have some vendetta but he sees this is this is not right but he does it Ikuo he does it in a godly way okay and so so they're not right with God for the Spirit of Christ is subject to Christ's teaching so people so people who come against the deacon in the wrong way I mean this is what brother Bray I'm saying um he says for the Spirit of Christ is subject to Christ teachings Christ house Christ Odyssey and any man or any woman any person child that will get angry with a godly deacon that would tell them or any parent would get angry with a deacon really we want everybody in this church that we can but it would only cause trouble somewhere else and he says there's a thorn or a rabbit and the woodpile we used to say that person isn't right this is brother brems words he says now if they leave there's only one thing to let them go pray for them see then maybe some of the Deacons go to their house sometime find out why they left and ask them what was wrong then enough they see if he can reconcile them if they can't two or three witnesses with him that they might be understood then if they can't be understood then it stole before the church if they're a member of the church and then there they go so brother cabinas also if you have a need and you can't get to me and you need prayer or you need we need some counseling brother cabinas is also on the job and he's very wise men I believe how he handles things Amen so this is all part of a deacons job and I said god bless you brother could be and also brother Edwin has taken over charge of the logistics and everything related to the music as well the so brother Isaac can focus on the recording and everything he's doing because we want to divide out all the work so if you have any music any questions or comments or something about the music go see brother in one a man cuz he's now in charge of music now let's stand shall we just as we read the scripture crab that slideshow please brother David okay so we're going to Luke chapter 19 so look 1935 237 oh no we're gonna keep reading gamble against up in verse 35 he says and they brought and they brought him to Jesus this is this is the cult and they casted garments upon the cult and they set Jesus thereon and as he went they spread their clothes in the way and when he was come nigh even now at the descent of the Mount of Olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest and some of the Pharisees were among the multitude said said unto Him master rebuked by disciples and he answered said unto them I tell you that if they should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out what a scene but then now look that but now this is Jesus now he's coming and he says and when he has was come near he beheld the city and wept over it saying if thou had known even though at least in this thy day the thing which belong unto thy peace but now they are hid from thine eyes for the days shall come upon thee that that enemy shall cast a trench about thee and can pass the round and keep thee and on every side and they shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee and they shall not leave thee one stone upon another because they all know us not the time of our visitation I mean this just this just bow heads in a word of Prayer gracious father we have read your word Lord we have come to this or this part of the service may you just take control of every spirit to have preeminence Lord and get glory to yourself father we commit this time into your hands and Jesus Christ then we ask amen amen you may have your seats this morning so it's quite a quite a contrast of a scene we just read here comes Jesus he's coming up and I know you know this story very well but but let's just go back there here comes a man on a on a donkey and and many many men no doubt have written into that gate on a donkey before well this is a different kind of meeting this man has has spoken to two storms and they've been still he spoken to dead people they came back to life again he spoke to all manner of sickness and they were healed hallelujah he cast out many devils he did many incredible things and here and here he was riding on this donkey and the multitude begin to be caught up in a vortex of prophecy being fulfilled and they begin to rejoice Hosanna blessed be the man that comes in the name of the Lord and they lay their garments down this was a procession like no one had ever seen before the people were caught up and worshiping around Roger and and rejoicing because here comes their king helu here comes the he comes the Messiah up into the city and they're all rejoicing but now look at what happened when Jesus beheld the city I want to really I pray if this would just be anchored to every every heart now this is when he beheld the city so these were the people that are beholding him Hosanna blessed be as he that comes in the name of the Lord and thou worshiping him as he as he came into the city but then he beheld the city and wept over it he wasn't rejoicing he was weeping he was crying he was broken he was upset by what he saw saying if thou had us knowing even now at least in this day the things which belong unto thy peace or my at least see but now it has hid from mine eyes he's saying if you had only know the things that belong to your peace if you only knew what you really possessed what was really in titled to you this was the city of the kings this is where the temple was many great prophets had walked through the gates many kings had walked through the gates that incredible things in the city because there were things that were allotted to the city amen but he said if we only knew if you only knew which belonged unto thy peace but they didn't know this is why he whipped do you know what belongs to you he whipped over these things and now the word beheld if I can just I just get the definition if you don't mind me trying to use a bit of technology here the would be held here at so in the Greek it's used only in certain past tenses and it means properly to see figuratively or blah implication that means in the perfect sense only perfect tense only to know to be aware to behold to consider to look on to perceive it's not just a casual a glance he's really beholding everything that's in the city here's these people they're rejoicing in this man riding in this donkey Hosanna to the highest and here he's looking at them and as I said on Wednesday when when Jesus beheld the scribes and Pharisees what did he see when he was looking into these people because God when God looks at a person he doesn't look at maybe their facial expression or even what they're saying he goes beyond the veneer of the mask that we can put on he goes beyond the veneer of what we can try and project I mean but he looks down he looks even past your spirit he looks into your soul Emme he looks into really what is in you holy is like he saw the woman at the well I'll say he beheld the woman at the well I mean even before he went there he says I need to go by the way of Samaria because one of my children are there hallelujah and all the rest of her village said this is a woman that that she's not accepted in our village anymore she's an outcast in our village I mean because she had too many husbands that's why she went to the well at the time she did because she wasn't welcomed with the other woman I mean so so if men looked at that woman you'd say I don't I wouldn't want her as a neighbor but he comes the very God made flesh hallelujah he's looking for a part of himself and he beholds one in her brokenness and her sadness and her in her state of just being unsatisfied with life cannot find lovin in the right places here she is in her brokenness in her rejection and God beholds her and says this is mine this is one of mine but then when he looks at the scribes and Pharisees they may they could have quoted all of the old testament from even from back to front upside down whatever way they want to put it whatever language they could have quoted it could have said all the right things done all the right things they could have said look at my lineage it's perfect that's why I can be a priest a member when he beheld them he said you're of your father the devil and his works you do what a contrast what a great contrast and now I put it in your lap this morning what does he behold when he beholds you Amen because the same Jesus in a different form was walking in this generation and when he's walking upon the earth hallelujah to find his elect at once to find his beloved ones hallelujah and there's many churches around but what happens when he beholds you what does he see I would ask I pray with all my soul Lord may you see a part of yourself I don't have a picture here but I was looking I've been pondering you know how there's especially in South Africa there's all the slag heaps is all the waste dirt and rock and stuff that's there there's piles of it in Johannesburg or maybe used to be and people of mining companies have have gone and they've remind all of those waste heaps and they've got tons of gold out of them now if you look at a photo of these things many times just looks like a big mound of dirt there's nothing really a value nothing's growing on it there's no life there and to me that's humanity we may have this kind of natural life don't talk about eternal life where see where's the precious metal so where's the precious park just a big mound and here comes Jesus now because because the devil looks at you any pie thinks there's no real value always make you a little slave you'll be a slave down here you'll just look after this little thing there's no great really value in these people but when God looks at you I trust he sees I can see a big waste heap but in that waste heat this gold and this one and that waste heap there's something for the Masters use and we know gold represents deity in the scripture hallelujah so I trust when he looks at you I mean he he's not looking at the dirt he's not looking at maybe the no life he's looking at the gold holy that's buried in the dirt amen I trust that's what he does and you've got to look at yourself and say Lord I'm more than a bunch of dirt walking around some life in it you know I've seen you on Wednesday when God just came down in the pre meeting I was thinking how great is our salvation how great do you really appreciate how great it is I mean the salvation of the Lord is an incredible thing it's not just a haphazard you know maybe just a casual thing you say some sinner's prayer it's so greater than that I mean what God would take your people who are not a people and call them by his own name and get them to himself I mean watch them in their in his own blood amen redeem them lift them up to the place they should be hallelujah his salvation is incredible it's so great I mean do we really appreciate what he's done amen to take your people who are not a people take just a bunch of wasted humanity what the devil thinks of you amen and and not only just just wash them but put his own life in them I mean that they became a they become identified in him I mean that everything hears they become who you you know there's a reason why John saw the book being taken and he said everything in heaven and in earth and under the earth heard him cry out glory honor pal hallelu here's rejoicing I mean because he lost yeah he saw the lamb come forth I mean to lay claim on what belong to him hallelujah and he knew he was part of that book amen brother I said John saw John that's why he was rejoicing hallelujah should be the same thing with us I mean when we see when we see this message come clear to you hallelujah and God is trying to tell you you came from eternity you're going back to eternity I mean you should be able to see yourself in there you should be able to see yourself as the eternal attribute of God holy that God will come down and find you Amen this is not some casual just a church or just some nice idea of something this is God's Redemption being experienced hallelujah we're going to be rejoicing around the throne and I came to the conclusion a while ago if it's an eternity it's going to be manifested upon the earth so John's revival become as the bride's revival I mean there has to be a people when they see the land come forth hallelujah and the second part of redemption taking the book I mean opening the sails releasing the inheritance down to God's people I mean and we say we receive that holy we receive our king coming hallelujah should be a rejoicing everything in heaven and earth under the earth should hear your voice Saint glory blessing honor be to the lamb I trust they do our voice transcends dimensions hallelujah so you should tell the devil glory I've been redeemed I mean you have no hold over me anymore I've been loosed from your grip hallelujah because our King has come we know foot will meet him in the air but as spirit is here everything that God is is upon the earth everything heaviness is upon the earth hallelujah we're not waiting for another outpouring the outpouring is happening I mean God has put a spirit out upon all flesh hallelujah do you really appreciate you know I trust when Jesus beholds you he doesn't weep he doesn't weep he doesn't say if they only knew what belonged to their peace but now it's hid from their eyes I trust when he beholds you he wouldn't be weeping for sadness he'd be weeping for joy I mean they know what belongs to their peace I mean they know what belongs to their salvation I've given to them hallelujah they know who I am they know what I've done for them hallelujah I trust that so that's how he feels when he sees you know this is from what's the attraction on the mountain by the way I'm saying prophecy being fulfilled this is what was happening in that day prophecies being fulfilled now we see what takes place now in the book of Zechariah the nineteenth chapter xix verse Secor I one of the prophet spoken the spirit saying this rejoice greatly o daughters of Zion hello that's you Amen shout o daughters of Jerusalem we're not with we're not the daughters of a natural city I mean we belong to a heavenly City hallelujah shout o daughters of Jerusalem behold thy King cometh unto thee haloo you and his spirit coming to you that's him coming amen you say well well we'll see him as he is whinnies when we meet him in the air now you see him here during his appearing and he's appeared among us hallelujah the Centurion now I'm not jumping around but once you to understand something if God is his word and if God has sent his word he is present I mean if God has sent his word he is present the Centurion understood this because the Centurion said to Jesus he said I've got a sick servant and Jesus says I'll come to your come to your houses no I'm not worthy you come under my roof just speak the word only amen and he'll be healed because of Centurion you if God sent His Word that's exactly the same as he physically standing there in a physical form I mean because of the he and his word are the same holy and that is Gentile faith I mean that is Gentile faith you can understand if his word is present he is present a man so therefore everything God is present I mean cuz the whole books come open I mean we don't have a partial revelation we have a full revelation of who he is I mean the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound all the mystery of God should be finished everything God is this characters nature everything is is it's not a mystery to us hallelujah so we should I trust you have the same thing God sent his word his word is upon the earth that's that's Jesus is upon the earth hallelujah everything heaven as is present I trust you I trust it means something to you now thy King cometh unto thee many times Jesus comes in a way we don't understand we think oh he should come another way no this is how he comes Allu you having salvation lowly riding upon the ass upon the fall the cult of an ass now what's the matter with those scribes cuz they're saying tell your disciples to be quiet and he said if they hold their peace the rocks will immediately cry out and I pray you probably heard people say it many times I don't want a rock to take my place I don't want some some piece of stone to take my place amen now what's the matter with those scribes or the matter with those priests what's the matter with those religious people this was right 487 years before it happened and by vindicated prophet and was already put into writings and called the Bible it Scrolls to the Old Testament has already put in the Bible I mean why couldn't they see that that's that prophecy being fulfilled the same reason they can't see it today they took the word of God and made of none effect of the people by teaching for traditions the commandments for doctrine the the traditions of men hallelujah now let's go to 2nd Samuel 5 because when a king when a king comes into us into power on his throne it actually joins the people and the king together there's a uniting taking place let's go to 1st Samuel I'm sorry second Samuel 5 see this here he says so sick and Samuel five one two three then came all the tribes of Israel to David under here bran and spake saying behold we are thy bone in my flesh we're becoming one where your boat we are thy bone and thy flesh also in times past when Saul was king over us thou wast he that leadeth out and brought on Israel and the Lord said to thee thou shalt feed my people Israel and thou shalt be a captain over Israel so all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron and King David were made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord and they anointed David king over Israel we we are by bone and thy flesh we are your body this is what he's saying to them we are your body now this is what should have happened when Jesus came into Jerusalem he comes like king unto thee and it should have been he should know we know he wasn't ordained to become an earthly king and that part of his ministry that's for the Millennium when he becomes son of David but this is what should have happened he comes the king and they should have cried out to him we have our bone and my flesh you become the head will be your body I mean whatever intelligence you have I mean we'll carry it out I mean whatever your thoughts are we'll carry it out whatever your desires are we'll carry them out I mean just like david's mighty men he doesn't say you must go get me a drink of water from the well of Bethlehem he says I long I long for a drink and finally I could drink that water again and three of his mighty men took the smallest of his desires and made it the greatest of his commandments amen and they cut their way through those Philistines and they brought a fresh drink of water back to their king hallelujah now if that's if that's just three men they just have an earthly king under the blood of bulls and goats the blood of bulls and goats didn't connect them to you didn't connect them together David as a type of Christ I mean but if that is just earthly Pete earthly men under the blood of bulls and goats his smallest desire became the greatest commandment now how much more the Bride of Christ amen that have been united to their head by the blood of Jesus Christ amen that al King is not we become one without King I mean that the smallest of his desire becomes our greatest commandment that's how it should be I mean what is pleasing to you I want to be identified with you guys I want to be identified with your word not just the nice bits I mean but the not nice bits I mean the bits that being a bringer approach I mean the bits that make me look like an oddball to the world I want to be identified with those boots the bits that make me an outcast I want to be identified with those boots because that's all part of them you know we can all stand and we can rejoice and we can air fellowship with anyone who who claims Christianity jesus paid it all you get a wonderful fellowship and you know you can you can rejoice in certain things but when it comes down to different things even basic things like baptism you don't need the Prophet tells us you don't need a revelation for baptism it's all in the scripture you just go read it and it makes sense even things are that people say I have nothing to do with that and it's crazy because that's the one thing that you are showing this world of the next world I'm being buried with my husband I'm taking on his name amen I'm being United with him in baptism they'll come forth in Eunice of life even that part Malta's you say why that's not important and and that's their attitude is we don't care what the word says we're not worried about it we're not interested we don't want to be identified what does that know that's the casual relationship I don't want to catch your relationship I want to be married hallelujah on being United a man I trust you've experienced the same thing hallelujah so we are his bones in his flesh now let's go let's go here now this is speaking of this is speaking of our day he says then shall come all the tribes of Israel are waiting I haven't yeah for Zions sake now Zion we know speaks as the Bride of Christ it's not just a place in the promised land it speaks of you it speaks of you here's the Zions sake I'll not hold my peace and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest now will go read in Revelations after this that the New Jerusalem speaks of you that's not just a physical city there's a people that are part of that city amen and so when he's talking about Jerusalem that's why that's why the Son of Man in this age when he came down revealed himself through a prophet he came to Jerusalem he came to the churches and he whipped if they only know and the peace that really belonged to them if they only knew the day of their visitation he came the greatest ministry that's ever been recorded God came down into a generation and what are thee and then what the religious world say why are these people rejoicing tell them to stop and here's the people to get liberated from Doc denominationalism they get liberated from the world they begin to see who they are in him and they begin to rejoice and the church world says have nothing to do with this and he comes in for it here comes the Prince of Peace Jesus Christ Himself being revealed through a prophet amen here he comes and the people don't want it and it causes it it causes the Lord to weep behold I stand the door and knock If any man hear my voice and they open that's the speaking of this age we don't want to be we don't want to kick him out what does he see when he beholds you he beheld and he beheld a city and he wept what does he see when he beheld you the rich young ruler I'm just gonna go this way for a little bit the rich young ruler epitomizes this age he was rich and he's increased with Goods brother bran one of the last services here preaches his leadership and he's speaking to Pentecostal people people have seen the you know times interpretation miracles signs and wonders and he's speaking about divine leadership and he takes the rich young ruler and he says now he rejected the leadership of eternal life and he's telling these people don't reject the leadership of he colonel life amen even though and they and and you can hear the service is so quiet and probably no doubt they're sitting there saying what is he talking about we seek God's Spirit move we see healing we see deliverance we seal different kinds of things and he's telling them don't turn down the leadership of eternal life you must receive the leadership of eternal life which is Christ hallelujah you've got a and here's the rich generally takes a rich young ruler rich increased with Goods and he thinks and then he he rejects me but Jesus that sees in the scripture beheld him and loved him he beheld this man this young man and loved him he had qualities that he loved but he said now you see your identity that you hold so dear of your riches and your place in society oh my what do my friends think of me what does my group think of me what will my work colleagues think of me I don't care what they think of me amen who would you rather please I mean what is what is my family think of me who's going to be judging you on that day if you come up in the second resurrection remember this messages as a rapture call but we've got to think now who who were really caring about but what will this person and the rich young ruler in his mind I was looking at the painting a couple of nights ago I just begin to cry we have it at our house and Jesus is just it's just you know the picture Christ in the rich young ruler and Jesus kind of motioning like this to the poor he's looking at the rich young ruler the rich young ruler is kind of downcast like this because he's may actually made up his mind but then he just had to unfortunately he said the wrong thing he weighed it up he took he took what must I do to inherit eternal life he asked the right questions I trust you asked that question too what can I do to inherit eternal life this is what I need he knew that his synagogue and his priests couldn't give him eternal life even though he followed it to the leader and then he comes to the very fountain of eternal life he says just sell your goods give to the poor take up your cross and follow me and he goes away say it and then but brother Bram links that parable and in the rich man and Lazarus together and he said there's a certain rich man and he increased with Goods and he pulled down his bonds and built bigger barns and all these things and then finally he said to himself one night you can rest my soul all as well and that night the Lord came to him said you know your life is required of you this night and he died and he went to hell so here was a man trying to find comfort in his riches rich and increased with Goods he says now I have need of nothing I have everything that I've wanted but he was Richard Palmer's will blind and naked and he didn't know it now that is this age that man epitomizes this age we don't want to fulfill that part of the scripture amen but you've got to be willing to take what does everyone think of me peer pressure is a real thing peer pressure is a real thing not just when you're young when you're old because you get set in a certain way well this is me and this is my identity this is what I've been doing for years and you get sitting a certain way and then Jesus comes your way and then you've got a and then there's a peer pressure what will my buddies think of me we've been through so much together well Jesus is coming and telling you I'm going to be your buddy and we're going to go through a whole bunch of different things which those buddies know nothing about I mean I and I just won't leave you like they may leave you I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee hallelujah and so now you gotta weigh it up like he did and you gotta take everything Moses was another rich young man and he took being the next Pharaoh he weighed that up against leading these people into a promised land these bunch of slaves and he esteemed being being led by Christ greater riches and all that of Egypt I trust because he wanted to be identified he wanted to be identified with these bunch of slaves he wanted to be identified with a with a god and a burning bush amen he wanted to be identify with him so he says I'm gonna unite myself to him and I'm gonna forsake this throne you got to be willing to do such things they meant you can't just you can't just walk yeah there's always been approach with the gospel the way every generation has been her approach no would have had a lot of approach it's gonna rain and the Sun does yell back and ever has it's gonna rain prove it I believe it you're crazy he's a madman but faith is the substance of evidence is the evidence of things hopeful so he actually possessed the faith it was revealed to him it's gonna rain and no man could shake him no one could shake him he started building that Ark and he didn't care what everyone made fun of you think of all the websites imagine if there was a man mention if we lived in the days of Noah because it's repeated again mention all the websites he you Google's Noah first prolly 10 pages false prophet expert nor exposed YouTube channels all about how Noah's wrong but no I just said no God told me it's gonna rain prove it prove it I'll show you by how I live I'll prove it by my building I'll prove by getting my family under the syphilis I'll prove by showing them God said it's gonna rain we're going to build the sport I'm going to prove it by Highland brother grant preached works as faith Express and he brings it down into his own life having to show the what's been revealed to him of the ministry he had aim it as expressed in his life and God comes out the end of that service to confirm he's telling the truth hallelujah and he did that many times now are you willing to be there approach what have you been one of what do you be the ninth person on the ark what have you actually said no I'm gonna identify myself with this man and his ministry and what he's doing you got to be willing to amen that's the same thing Paul the Apostle Paul said to Timothy he said you are not ashamed of me don't be ashamed of me I mean the gospel or has messenger or my chain they meant there are things there there are whole groups of Christendom that actually say that Paul was the Antichrist they actually do believe it they believe he was the Antichrist and they have there they try and prove it in some way but you had to be able to bear the approach and that day of the messenger and everything that was said against him so here's a man he's a convicted felon he's been in jail he stirs up trouble wherever he goes that's I believe he that this been saying gospel has been given to that man that man he's only got one coat loose got this affliction in his flesh and he can't see sometimes in all these problems he's the messenger from God you had to be the reproach and God is the same in every generation I mean just like if you're living in Germany there's Martin Luther you'd say I believe this man is preaching the truth and I've come out of Catholicism what this this high-tempered German monk used to be a monk he's just got an axe to grind against the Catholic Church I believe it's him I believe the just shall live by faith what this guy at least dad look he got caught up at although I believe that's him John Weasley the same thing I mean bring it down on her the same thing in this hour I mean with this messenger I mean with this prophet that we've received I mean everything this you you got to be there approach because what does it produce it doesn't jesus said he said search the scriptures and actually in the Bible says ye search the Scriptures for they are they are the way to eternal life and they are they which testify in them you think you have eternal life they are they that testify of me he says ye searched them but they testify of me and they were looking at him saying this man's Beelzebub Alleluia but the disciples that they said I'm going to be identified with this man he died you know no doubt they would have testimony services what did he do he raised the dead and healed the sick and calmed the storm and cursed the fig tree and all those things well how did he die he died on a cross oh so you mean the government didn't like what he said the the churches didn't receive him and he died the worst punishment that could be that yo that could happen yeah hmm that's a bit funny people ice had a brother Brown died a car accident hmm they just don't understand the scripture but you had to be there approach you following what I'm trying to say you got to be there approach because there's something more there's something more than just a prophet's ministry that's he uniting where he would take a vessel speak through that vessel hey well Peter was Peter winter Cornelius this house this is not crazy Peter goes to pour nearly I mean Cornelius house he preaches the Gentiles and while yet Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost fell upon them they're sealed into the kingdom they men said Jesus came and dwelt in those Gentiles and it's the same thing at the end now amen they got United for Zions sake I will not hold my peace and for Jerusalem's sake I'll not rest until righteousness thereof go forth as brightness and salvation thereof as a lamp that burners amen and the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all the kings like glory and thou shalt be called by a new name amen I'll no longer call you Church I'll call you bride hallelujah cuz the name designates an office amen isn't that right so when he's calling you brightest God is elevating you - what you mean to be hallelujah and then a bride gets married Amen I trust you've been United to him and you name which the mouth of the Lord shall name thou shall also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord our world a royal diadem in the hand of thy God this is what you'll be never think you're downtrodden you ever think you're not worthy I mean if you have you Google slag heaps and waste heaps from mines they don't look all that good but then there's the gold and those who have the intelligence the mind that they say there's got to be something of value in here and they mined out the gold they don't care how much how much rubble and rock they've got to move at all the different things all I care about is the gold hallelujah you take diamonds diamonds don't look all that uncut diamonds don't look all that wonderful compared to the cat one amen but it's just like us we're we're we're part of this earth God reaches down gets a hold of his jewels but then he's got to cut those jewels and he's gotta polish those jewels and then he doesn't just do that he sets them in his crown hallelujah because you know when you see a king you normally look at all how BIG's the crown look at those big jewels in the crown hallelujah it's the same thing with you be with me this is what God thinks of you I roll diadem in the hand of thy God thou shalt be no more term Forsaken we are not a forsaken people I mean we remember if they only knew what belong to the apiece this is part of our peace I mean we're no longer forsaken people Alleluia neither shall thy land be turned desolate but thou show up but thou shalt be called Hezbollah and thy land Beulah for the Lord the lighteth in thee hallelujah and thy land shall be married shall be United this talki of you amen we're not we're not a widow with nothing I mean we're all desolate hallelujah we are married people I mean we'll be United there's been a uniting taking place the marriage of the Lamb happens down here hallelujah and we've been married I trust you have but you can be willing to lay aside all your old life you can't bring your old life into this new marriage I mean you got to cast it out hallelujah now and the land shall be called married for as a young man marries a virgin so shall thy sons marry thee and as a bridegroom rejoices over the bride so shall vive God rejoice over thee hallelujah this is this is what he thinks about you this is what he thinks about you amen as a bridegroom rejoices over a bride I mean all those have been married you remember finally this is all maybe sometimes these years or months of preparation finally the day and then the ceremony happens hallelujah and and you're so happy amen finally you're together forever finally you're identifying yourself do you take this woman absolutely absolutely I take this woman unto myself I mean to be my lawful wedded wife hallelujah or the other way around do you take this man yes I take this man I love this man I love this woman hallelujah I've been looking forward to this day hallelujah and you don't care you don't care about everyone in the crowd I mean you're listening to the words of the minister marrying you and you're looking in the eyes of your beloved and you're saying finally the day's come and you begin to rejoice hallelujah hallelujah this is how our God rejoices over you I've been waiting for this moment hey we saved buddies an eternal God but he's watching his plan unfold he's watching his plan become manifested amen in you're part of that plan hallelujah the bride is part of that plan amen we rejoice when when finally our sins are all washed away and we are redeemed and we know who we are I mean but he's rejoicing hallelujah here's the people that know me Amen I reveal myself to them hallelujah and they rejoice in my salvation hallelujah he's done so much for us I mean you you just think about when we around the throne that day hallelujah we'll be rejoicing I mean it will be a glorious time and it'll never get common if we could really grasp the magnitude of what he's delivered us from what he's gathered us to hallelujah where the bride will not see the tribulation Amen we will not stand in jeopardy of a judgement he that heareth my words and believe on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come to the condemnation but is passed from death to life I mean that's a bright scripture amen who's heard his word who's believed on him who sent him Amen well then you have you presently and you're in your possession everlasting life and you shall not come to the condemnation the judgment be is passed from death to life hallelujah we're not standing in jeopardy I believe in eternal security I believe the proper to do Alleluia the bride is eternally secure glory to God I am Annie rejoice over thee now if we are to be united with him then what he thinks about things his his nature his life is in you I'm gonna read some from the church age book I'm sorry I don't have it up on here and so I don't have it in Spanish but here it is this is a page 172 this is the Pergamon age he sees the members this is just part of it says the members of the virgin bride will love him and they will have his potentials for he is their head and all power belongs to him they are subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads they meant my fingers subject to my brain when I say finger move my finger doesn't say no I'm not going to move it moves amen when my hand moves like this it has no say it just moves that's that that's how the bride is subject to Christ because he says now you have the mind of Christ amen remember it's a love relationship Alleluia why do why am i Christian because I love him why do you live this way because I want to please him he trying to in salvation no sir Amen it was paid for on Calvary but this is my appreciation he's been so good to me he's so lovely he's so wonderful I mean he's so gracious he's so kind isn't he amen that's why I live this way as appreciation thank you thank you Lord for saving me thank you thank you Lord for setting me free once I was lost but now I'm found hallelujah I'm glory bound thank you thank you Lord for saving me well how do you show it how you live this is my appreciation Lord this is my appreciation to you amen and if you do it that way everything will come out right and you glad he found you and you glad he saved you and you glad he open your eyes I mean you're stumbling and darkness someplace and then he found you there he be told you he saw the potentials in you there's gold this deity in that one I mean this is a part of me in that one but they must know me I mean they must come to me hallelujah Angie did Alou yeah Amen now notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until was first showed him by the father this is in John 5:19 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride I mean this harmony he says verily verily I say to you the son can do nothing till that which the father shows him and what the father shows him the son does likewise that's John 5:19 I mean so he says now this harmony is said now exists between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm oh not even death hallelujah what can this world do to you what can this will do to you what can it do to me nothing it may harm this thing but this thing if time would go on its gonna be in the ground someplace anyway I mean said no harm can come to you I mean we should be ragged in our faith I mean we just be burly brother may seem to be burly in our faith hallelujah cuz nothing can harm us not even death for if the seed be planted the water will rise it up again here is a secret of this the word is in the bride as it wasn't Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he does once done with his word amen she performs the commandment of the Lord in his name for she has thus saith the Lord because we have the true interpretation of the scripture I mean then the word is quickened by the Spirit and it comes to pass amen I trust you've seen that in your own life amen it comes in and got quickens and you see it manifested hallelujah then the word is quickened by the Spirit comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will amen no one can make him do otherwise they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still they know it has to be God and them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work well in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will fulfill he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for the specific time he didn't come to New Zealand and his earthly journey he didn't go to South Africa there's a lot of places he didn't go but he goes in his bride to finish his work hallelujah mmm buddy says they do not have their own will I'm glad that's the case I'm glad we don't have our own world when Jesus came to the greatest the greatest victory he had wasn't guess M&E where he laid down his own will he said not my will he wasn't rejoiced I think I said it last Sunday he wasn't rejoicing now I'm going to go to the cross now I'm going to die cute humanly he wasn't rejoicing because he knew the agony he knew the painting knew the sorrow he knew the rejection that he had to experience so he wasn't rejoicing in that way and it's the same thing with us many times we we come to agus M&E you have to have your own guests M&E where you lay aside your own will and what you think about everything everything and say not my will but thy will be done amen you have to come to that point hallelujah now this is from a song Hosanna it says break my heart for what breaks yours everything I am for your kingdom cause as I go from nothing to Eternity now I put this in Google Translate so I don't know if it's exactly right but break my heart for what breaks yours this should be very true whatever breaks his heart because if we're one we have the same mind we have the same motive and objective with the same heart amen so what whatever breaks his heart should break yours whatever hurts him should hurt you amen that's what it must because if his spirit is on you brother om says he said if Beethoven's and me I'll write music if Michelangelo if the spirit of Michelangelo is in me I'll paint great masterpieces if the spirit of John Dillinger's and me I'll shoot guns and south he says if I have the Spirit of Christ in me then I will do the works of Jesus Christ and he says not two people could live in the same place one has to be dead in order for the second one to come in images is no longer me living its Christ that liveth in me hallelujah so now this must manifest in us I pray break my heart for what breaks yours amen and we understand in reality this is not necessarily just what the world does what really broke the heart of Jesus Christ it was what the religious people were doing it's what the church was doing he came to his own but his own received him not but as many as received him gave he power to become the sons of God even those that call on his name that's what broke because he came here was he was the Lamb he was the very God that gave the law and Mount Sinai now became flesh I mean to lose the people from that law having to put a spirit in them that the that that he would live the word through them and he came to his own here's the Messiah I were looking for a messiah God send us must Jehovah send your Messiah send your Redeemer when will you restore the kingdom he comes a baby in a manger here's my answer here's my answer and it's in the bite it was prophesied to happen here's my answer and then he grows up he comes into US ministry we will not have this man rule over us incredible and the Bible says I think it's an easy cure that those who are sealed in the kingdom of the ones who side and cry for the abominations done in the city and brother Graham says we should have joy unspeakable full of glory hallelujah but at the same time we should try and cry for the abominations done what city is he talking about he's talking about that the church world the religious world amen you say but everyone likes them that maybe so but this is not a popularity contest this is not world do you like me or do you not like me if you like me I'll continue being a Christian if you don't like me all stop it all and I'll compromise so I don't offend you no this is not how does Elijah and lied you stomped out the wilderness he didn't care now will Jezebel will I fender will I offend a hem how's it going to happen he just stops in there that's saith the Lord it's not gonna rain no rain no jus until I call for it hallelujah you say well that's just an Old Testament prophet there should be the same kind of gumption and us amen that you understand the world will be offended the world will not accept you it doesn't accept him all the prophets were killed amen all of them were rejected hallelujah if they call the master of the house Beelzebub how much more those under him break my heart for what breaks yours people that live under their privilege breaks my heart people that the head salvation if you only knew the peace that belong to you if you only knew the peace that belonged to you a peace that passes all understanding hallelujah a real identity as salvation so rich and free amen this bride this bride is the woman that God has been waiting for for thousands of years he started an Eden but in his mind as it's going to be a bride there's gonna be a people I'm going to unite myself worth a mint I've been waiting for her to come and he's watch this plan unfold and unfold and unfold and then he came and died on the cross purchased our salvation and he said to be seven Church ages he watched a woman rise up out of every kindred nation tangen people they will know my Redemption they will know that that I belong they belong to me they're part of me Amen we are one flesh hasn't a wife become one flesh hallelujah I'm gonna I'm gonna break the chains of sin off their life I'm going to doesn't matter what they come out of hallelujah I'm going to deliver them from from drugs from the whole from prostitution from religion whatever it'll be I mean nothing will hold us in lick one my elect lady will come forth hallelujah that's the purpose of us hug I mean that will be really free he that the Sutter's hit free is free indeed not just a little bit free not just part time free completely free I mean when the jubilee trumpet sounded in Israel I mean they weren't part time ok weekends all come work here and jus then during the week I'll go back to my possession no they drop whatever was what was holding them down and they walk back into their possession and this gospel trumpet is the jubilee trumpet I mean if you've really heard it you're free indeed well I look back to the slave master the slave master you know what can he do for you Oh give them a bit of house I'll give them a bit of job I'll give them a nicer place to live you know I'll give them a nice circle of friends I'll make the world think nicely of them still a slave master who cares about that stuff I mean they'll come a time when that's not even remembered I want to be there eternally don't you hallelujah that's where I want to be break my heart for what breaks yours you should think about that what actually breaks his heart don't live below your privilege how God has done so much our Lord Jesus has done so much for us just as a peek under vigil II he's done so much for us we are the most privileged people in all the earth I mean when we are not wandering along and darkness caught up what's going on what's happening with Trump and Russia and all these different things in the Vatican my my my focus is not on world events my focus is on his word I mean because when his bride counts to maturity they all come in I mean then the rapture will go I mean his focus is like I've seen about Abraham 25 years of Abraham's life these nations rise nations fall civilizations are founded new land is discovered all different things are happening in the world it's not in the scripture it's not in the scripture why is it not in the script it's not important to God goddess Abraham come out Kolia come to a new land and then he takes his son by the hand that's what's important to God amen and it's the same thing today here he is calls you finds you gathers you to himself he knows all the stuff must happen he says he puts it in their hearts to do his will see everything you see in the world is actually God putting in their hearts he's doing his will nothing's out of cater the devil there's nothing over our God all his prophecy is turning sure a man is totally in step with his timepiece he knows exactly where down to the picosecond what's going to happen hallelujah he's not getting anxious and worried he sees his word being fulfilled and that's what his focus is upon his bride upon as he lik lady his focus is upon you hallelujah now this is from first Corinthians 13 charity we know is divine love it's suffereth long now this is more than nice scriptures that people may speak about it a wedding this is to be manifested in a people Amen because our Lord Jesus is a person he's a reality he's not an idea he's not a nice thing he's a person and if he comes into you then he'll manifest these things charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked now when I'm reading this I trust you and go back in your life and say I've seen this and we understand that if the Holy Spirit is in you then you'll believe every word because he cannot deny Zone word I mean if his spirit of the earth spirit of the author is in you you'll say Amen and even if you say I cannot obtain two that you'll say Lord caused me to become that and you will become a member you're not that he cannot deny his own word he cannot you cannot say that's just a man's opinion that's just the Apostle Paul's your opinion the Apostle Paul writes if any man is spiritual among you let him acknowledge what I read to you as the commandments of the Lord amen rejoice is not an iniquity this is why this should be in you thinketh no evil rejoice is not iniquity but rejoices in truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things hallelujah I trust you say that's me that's to be in the bride now what is he I'm gonna wrap this up cuz I've kept you when he beheld you I choked that member we've come up into a rapture season this may be the last if we're here until Christmas I always think about Christmas Christmas is such a big calendar time for Christians and they have their manger and I think about his first coming at least several things Jesus has come again the second time he's walking upon the earth and just like in the first time they missed him and they didn't want him and they rejected him and he wept because if they only knew what belonged to their peace if they only knew and what now is but they didn't know but here we are coming into another Christmas season and I trust when you when you approach the season you've got to think now you came the first time you weren't born in December this is when we celebrated you came the first time the world just turned you down very few received them and now here I am seven billion people upon the earth but there's something in me that's caused me to receive you in this season and the world will you know the rapture will go and no one will really know we've gone it'll just come you think about Jesus coming upon the earth the first time hundreds of prophecies being fulfilled the word becoming manifested God's God became flesh and dwelt among us incredible things happened but just passed through and it was done and it was gone and here we are in a second coming in the days of Sodom and and and Noah that shall be when the Son of Man is revealed and the same son of man was revealed through a prophet and it came and it fulfilled Scripture and the things he said is still being manifested upon the earth and as bright as be the Bride of Christ is being called and then we'll be done and she'll be taken up to the wedding supper and the world will go on now I say all that because we don't want to let it pass us by you say well if I meant to be there I'll be there I'm not I'm not no don't say that you and I say Lord this is my season I want another day of my visitation I don't want to take it haphazardly I don't want to take it casually I mean we have one life to live amen and here's walking he is passing this way just like he went through Jericho amen and Zacchaeus went up in a tree he saw him in the tree amen he's come to this hole in the ground here amen any and he knows you're here hello he knows you're here and this I trusted something in you says Lord I want to behold you and when you behold me may you not see my pain and my hurt and my sorrow I have you but see something of deity in me I mean that you can take me and heal me and deliver me because you've already done it on the cross I want to see it manifested be with me quit some musicians
