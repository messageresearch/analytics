[1:16:03] own hombre in order to fully express
[1:16:05] himself but if instead of saying
[1:16:06] completamente he was wild with moses el
[1:16:10] sistema de Ville and when we says to to
[1:16:13] show his mighty power of deliverance
[1:16:15] animal terror super dev supremo then
[1:16:18] delivery soon and and every prophet he
[1:16:20] was he was veiled
[1:16:21] yelling Cara Profeta so when I live in
[1:16:24] London so when a prophet came to the
[1:16:25] earth a sequin don't profit a venal a
[1:16:27] tiara
[1:16:28] God use their profit do so as a
[1:16:30] professor to make himself known but el
[1:16:32] sur sur le malade oh but there was just
[1:16:34] a part of God being revealed through a
[1:16:36] serious element una parte yo Cinderella
[1:16:38] but then when Jesus was here there
[1:16:40] Wonder Hazuki Rita - Agha although the

[1:16:52] who do you mean say that I am gay look
[1:16:54] anything so many can say yo they say

[1:16:58] prophets
[1:16:58] I'm gonna listen hearing me as a Leah I
[1:17:00] will not refer them because they could
[1:17:02] say what that profited they they could
[1:17:04] see Jesus doing the same thing but can
[1:17:06] you put it on we're looking a prophet a
[1:17:08] CNN he has - Christos the LME Marcos's
[1:17:10] but if you take all the prophets
[1:17:11] together but instead to my provider
[1:17:13] juntos what you say God and impart on
[1:17:15] each one
[1:17:16] it's just any party an Indian cada uno

[1:17:33] understand us better can pull on think I
[1:17:36] ain't a in there no mucho mejor de
[1:17:38] because it's when you experience
[1:17:39] something but you want to fake
[1:17:40] pedimental
[1:17:41] then you can understand someone who's
[1:17:43] gone through the same thing cuando se
