thank you musicians Hallelujah you know it would be so nice to just have that music playing the whole time but it's not really the conventional thing that's done but it's just so nice you know you hear that sound and it can be arranged he said well amen well you know we're already quite different from other places that'll just make us even more different wouldn't hallelujah amen it's such a privilege to be here again this morning and we'll just get straight into the word of God because we don't want to have you standing too much longer so we're going to talk now uh from um 1 Samuel chapter 1 and this morning's sermon is on driving out the debus sites and the subject under that title if you will is an anointing David King amen amen and we've alluded to this in the subconscious series quite a bit and this I is part of the it's kind of part of the subconscious series The to finish it off but it's also definitely a standalone sermon in itself and so it reads here in 1 Samuel 1 verse 1-17 says here now there was a certain man of ramam Zam um of Mount Ephraim and his name was elaa the son of Jim and the son of ALU and the son of toou the son of Z and ephrathite and he had two wives the name of the one was Hannah and the name of the other was panina and panina had children but Hannah had no children and this man went up out of the city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts and Shiloh and the two sons of Eli Hoff and finaz the priests of the Lord were there and when the time was that Kaa offered he gave to pan his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions but unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion for he loved Hannah but the Lord had shut up her womb and her adversary also provoked her sore for to make her fret because the Lord had shut up her womb may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated Hannah had to suffer a reproach Hannah had to go through some great trials Hannah had to Bear the reproach of a Barren womb she wasn't able to have children and the the wife the other wife of her husband because back in those days they had polygamy where husbands could have multiple wives um and so she was sharing her husband with another another woman named panina and panina could had she had a lot of children so God was planning something for Hannah and so Hannah had to wait for children and God would shut up her womb and Hannah would would be laughed at and ridiculed and pressure upon her for many years of her life the prophet actually says that it was about 60 years of her life before she had a baby she was 60 years old so God has an appointed time and so you can see now that in Hannah was this promise because we're going to continue reading soon and you'll see but I want to just put that in there that God shut up her womb it wasn't nothing that she did but God had an season for her to have a baby God made the season not Hannah and Hannah would have tried everything she could but God was developing a character in Hannah because Hannah was going to be used in a mighty way for the Lord and you'll see soon that Hannah was actually at the pivotal role the pivotal place of Israel's future the future of a Nation hinged on a on a 60-year old woman that was Barren so I'll just continue reading the story here and it says um from it says and as he did so year by year when she went up to the house of the Lord so she panina provoked Hannah therefore she wept and and she didn't eat then said alaa her husband to her Hannah why do you cry why weepest thou and why do you not eat and why is your heart grieved sad am I not better to you than 10 sons and so Hannah rose up these are key words now she rose up something started rising in her amen amen amen something that was e external from her own being yes was starting to stimulate and stir within her life because she was sick of being Barren she was sick of being tormented she was sick of having a life that didn't have any fruit glory amen hallelujah and I'm sure we've all been through this Hallelujah no one wants to sit and be a fruitless person for the Lord amen hallelujah so Hannah rose up Hallelujah I like that and they after they had eaten in Shiloh and after they had drunk now Eli the priest sat upon a seat so here's the high priest now of Israel and he sat upon a seat by a post of the Temple of the Lord and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the Lord and she wept sore so she was screaming and crying so emotional so desperate she needed to have a contact with God Amen she wasn't going to leave until she met God that day amen amen that's right Hallelujah and that makes me feel excited Hallelujah because I can identify with her I can identify with Hannah spiritually speaking amen amen hallelujah amen so now Hannah sorry I've lost my place here and and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the Lord and wept saw and she vowed a vow she made a promise in other words and said oh lord of hosts if thou Wilt indeed look upon the Affliction of your handmaid and remember me and not forget your handmade but will give unto your handmaid a Manch child then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life and there shall no rer come upon his head and it shall come to pass as she continued praying before the Lord that Eli marked her mouth so now the high priest was watching her amen now we've got to look prophetically at this we can't just look at this in the natural because yes Eli was a natural man and he wasn't a very good high priest either he was old and he was and he was getting a bit slack but we're not looking at the human side of this now we're looking at the position cuz he was still the high priest he still was holding the most prestigious position in Israel yes and so we can't look we're going to look at the prophetic of this not the natural so now here's the high priest marking the mouth of this woman who wants to be fruitful and bringing in because with Israel your fruit is also part of your inheritance yes now therefore Eli thought oh here Eli marked her mouth now Hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not heard now therefore Eli thought she had been drunk you know drinking and and Eli said unto her how long will you be drunk put away your wine from thee and Hannah answered and said no my Lord I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the Lord am Hallelujah you know when you really get serious with God he knows when you really want something from God and you need it he knows he's listening to what this heart is speaking when you pour your soul out to God Amen he wants reality he wants sincerity he wants someone that means business that's serious with God that's that's certain of God count not thine hand made for a daughter of beel for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto which means it's up to this point then Eli answered and said go in peace and the god of Israel Grant thee thy petition that thou has asked of him this is a glorious piece of scripture here is a woman that has been Barren and has been irritated by her sister you could say she's not quite her sister but she I guess she's the sister in the Lord in the Old Testament but panina now this other woman in her life was do you know the name panina means Pearl no and do you know what a pearl is it's a product of irritation when a piece of sand gets inside an oyster it bring that oyster now to protect itself it develops a pearl inside it and so you can see now that God is telling us through these people and through his stories because he remember God writes the Bible with these lives and he's telling a story and not just a story that you read and that's it but it's a prophecy he speaking of a people in this day he's speaking of you and me am right now that we also have had irritations come into our life that's right and if we can just keep our eyes focused on the vision and just be patient it might be struggling it might be hard it might it might almost destroy you yes but a pearl is forming amen there might be an irritation but a pearl is forming you cannot be destroyed every promise that God's promised you will be fulfilled in you just keep your eyes on Jesus Keep Your Eyes on him no matter what no matter how hard it is no matter all that's going on keep your eyes on him never let your testimony never let your testimony become negative that's right Andy it's very easy to default and and and and and and and and and and succumb and and allow your thoughts to just go down that negative path but something in Hannah all her life hallelujah amen I believe something in Hannah all her life was in there amen I believe there was a predestined plan for her amen I believe she had a predestined plan and God placed a seed of faith in Hannah's life Hallelujah that no matter how much hardship and how much trials and how much destruction and how much irritation and how much ridicule and how much reproach and all those things that faith never let her go and fall apart amen because Hannah plays a pivotal role who knows what pivotal means it's like the point of a turn where a nation would turn a corner Hanah played a pivotal and crucial role now God this is the amazing thing God placed confidence in that little seed of faith that he placed inside Hannah a woman that was Barren until she was 60 years old Hallelujah God knew that the fruit of her womb the fruit of her life would bring a nation to change would change the history and the future sorry not the history it would take it would turn what has been historically a foundation for Israel of confusion and destruction and idolatry and all sorts of a people that have no headship a people that have no King and God would hinge the future of his holy nation his holy people on the faith of one Barren 60y old woman who can identify with that who can identify in their own life how insufficient you feel when you know that God has placed a seed of faith in you that can change Nations that can change the world inside you you can't do nothing you just have to be faithful right you you cannot try and make it happen but there's times in your life where you need to go down to the temple yes Hallelujah there's time because there sometime that seed can lay dormant in your life that seed of Faith that's a nation changing world changing rapturing seed inside your life and that can lay dormant until you have had a visitation from the high priest Jesus Christ until you yourself have come down now Hanah she I might be getting a hit of myself but anyway she Hallelujah she actually when she came down she doesn't she wasn't worried about what all the other women were doing she didn't care about The Prestige of the temple and how good and nice it is she didn't even worry about anything that was going on about Eli's Sons or anything politics and this is wrong that wrong she had no she didn't want to she didn't want to borrow that stuff she meant business she was serious she came to the temple and she bypassed all of that amen you know that song Take Me pass the out of cours and the priest to sing your praise pass the Brazen outter Lord I want to see your face you know the song that song well that's the reality now this is Hannah now she's going past the brais AL pass the out pass the priest to sing your praise pass all their problems and politics and everything she wants to meet the high priest she wants to talk with God Amen because something was rising up within her a seed of faith was rising up Hallelujah Hannah rose up you see when she rose up something was actually Rising within her something was stirring some light must have been shown and maybe a scripture was read maybe a verse was read to her or someone shared a story about the Bible with her and that seed started rising up within her and it caused her to do things that she wouldn't normally do it caused her to make a fool of herself in front of other people amen and you know when that seed starts to work within you it can make you do things that you wouldn't normally do it can make you do things that would seem foolish to the world and foolish to those that don't have faith but amen you see she went down there and she got on her knees and she had a visitation from the high priest because God had placed in her a faith that would change that Nation Hallelujah a faith that would change that nation and this would change the administration of the time of Judges you know the time of Judges was before her so here you have a woman at which is the type of the church now here you have a church right that is placed in the in a pivotal point in time now we're speaking prophetically here so you need to spiritually think about this she was placed in a point of pivot where behind her was a time of judges behind her was a time of great politics fighting and all sorts of stuff a failure a great failure and in front of her was the prospect of a future of a righteous Godly King that would take now just please go with me I'm going to explain all this but would take everything that Joshua promised the everything all the inheritance and everything that was promised by Joshua would be that king would be anointed to take that and give it and claim it and make it yours now I believe we are in that same position amen amen we are in that same position and thank the Lord and praise the Lord that we've moved from that position in the positive way Hallelujah you see we but there are still many people and and as an indiv and and individuals would still be there because you've got to recognize now what are you going to do with your pivotal position what are you going to do when you're placed in that position of power that God has entrusted in you will you continue that in the time of Judges where there was no King where there was no headship where the after Joshua had died and the elders had gone and the people had just taken this whole message of Joshua and made a big mess out of it made it a big political thing and they fight this one and they don't talk to this one and that one doesn't happen and these ones are in the Millennium these ones have two Souls they can go and sin and do whatever they want right this is the time of Judges that Israel found themselves in and it's exactly the time of Judges that the people that came out under brother Brandon's message found themselves in but we now because we're at a purpal point where there's been a change of dispensation and that's a these are big words but this is what I believe the we are at a pivotal point where there's been a change of dispensation not because we've been any better not because we've done anything more but because this is the season this is the time this is the time where a heners would rise up Hallelujah and a henna would be able to choose now Hallelujah she will be able to choose now is she going to listen to that voice of Faith that's within her that voice that's Sayang go down to the temple go and meet the high priest become a fruitful person aren't you second warming up you and that alone aren't you sick of being baren don't you want to bring forth fruit Hallelujah that's right amen and you see now there is an opportunity for us as a group as individuals that make up a group to fulfill the scripture amen and we can choose now are you going to ignore that voice that's within you that's saying you know you just meet the high priest and become fruitful because of life that you bring forth this life that you'll bring forth will anoint David King you see Hannah because she was unselfish in her desire you see the prayer that she prayed she didn't just pray to have a child just for her and have riches or whatever and for selfish reasons she said oh Lord give me a boy I want to dedicate him to you Hallelujah her motive was right her objective was right you know what God blessed her so much he blessed her so much he gave her a prophet he gave her a man that would change the nation a man that would restore the people and the life that she brought forth brought the Thunder back to Israel amen you see because Samuel when he prayed down at ebener Hallelujah the Lord thundered against the enemies and it drove the enemies away amen hallelujah that was a life that Hannah brought forth amen was the fruit of her womb you see now everything you see in a natural way in the Old Testament she P for the natural child we're spiritual the natural child's finished with Mary when she had Faith she had to give birth to a natural Lamb of God she had to give birth to the Lamb of God who would atone and make the atonement for all of our sin right but that was still a life that she brought forth now I'm not ascribing Mothership to her because she wasn't the mother as such she was the incubator she brought forth the child but the faith that she believed she had a visitation from the high priest amen hallelujah she had a visitation from the mighty Angel that's right Hallelujah she got into an atmosphere amen and that angel preached a message to her and she received that yes and her life started changing amen she became fruitful she was no longer a Pew warmer amen amen she was no longer just a dormant person sitting in a synagogue listening to the priest Hallelujah she was far more than that now amen because she now came into personal contact with God and God made her a fruitful person and brought forth a natural living baby but you see now there does there is no need for a natural living baby to be born in our lives anymore but we bring forth a spiritual baby a spiritual child a spiritual life that will be raised up and continue to grow and grow and grow until it becomes a mature man and that is the man Christ Jesus on display that is the life that we bring forth and we've been placed in a pivotal point now prophetically speaking over the age now we're in a pivotal point where we can choose and many people unfortunately have chosen the wrong thing there are still people that Proclaim this message even ministers that continue in the time of Judges they continue fighting with each other they continue with their political ways they continue in this old administration because you see the the biggest issue that's gone on in history is that the doctrines have been right and the preaching's been good but the Min Administration has been wrong people have forced an image upon people people prob in the time of Judges after Joshua died there would have been zealous ministers and Priests that forced it upon the people that forced it and tried to make it happen and you know they corrected everything so hard so harsh and so negative that the people just crushed down and couldn't bear it ruling with malevolence ruling the way that they were brought up by their parents that's right ministers with good intentions legally brought up their Church the way that they were brought up by their parents hard cold you know strict so hard and you know it doesn't work it doesn't work like that but now that the time of Judges has come to an end now that we have a point here where we like Hannah we can choose are we going to continue down that path are we going to continue going that way or are we going to come under a different headship Hallelujah are we going to get serious with God till we meet the high priest and the high priest speaks a spoken word into our life and gives us an Immaculate Conception you know the Immaculate Conception was the the that Mary didn't know a man and gave forth a baby now we now can have an Immaculate Conception where we meet the Lord the high priest when we get serious with him Hallelujah and maybe it might take a bit of Shame Hallelujah it might take a little bit of embarrassment you might have to do things that you don't normally do to get it Hallelujah but you'll get it when you weep from your soul and bitterness of Soul however it happens when that desperation strikes you you cannot get desperate until God speaks to you did you know that you cannot become desperate until the voice of God speaks to you amen and you see I I believe that you know Hannah the voice of God would have spoke to her just before she rose up because something would have gone boom and that little seed inside started tingling or whatever it did it started moving Hallelujah she couldn't control herself anymore she just had to go there she had to go and meet the high priest Hallelujah because she played a pivotal role in the future of Israel because the life that she brought forth a prophet and that Prophet restored the seven Thunders to Israel in tight now that life was the Thunder that thundered out against the enemy yes and we've been told the same thing that what we need in Wellington amen what we need in sh Tabernacle is thousands of lived voices amen amen thundering out against the enemy amen now if you meet that high priest that high priest going to make you fruitful and that fruit of your womb spiritual womb is going to that that's going to bring forth a life that Thunders out against the enemy and humility such a testimony of an open book a testimony of the reality of Jesus Christ manifested on the Earth right now Hallelujah all right well we've got the overview now we'll just continue because I believe we are a privileged people amen a very privileged people we don't have to work through all of the baggage of having all the time and judges it's fresh amen amen amen amen we got a a white canvas Hallelujah that's been cover colored in by the the colors and paint of God amen I'm so happy about that that's a great thing Hallelujah and so we have the choice now as individuals now to get down and get serious be a be have conviction about your religion have conviction about Christianity not casual Christianity is not a casual thing amen hallelujah it's not casual God is not a casual person he's a friendly person and he's gracious but he's not casual I don't believe God's casual he's not this cool guy that mixes around and can fit in so well he's got a serious personality actually he's balanced because he's good and severe it says behold or behold the goodness and severity of God so there's a severe side to God that you don't want to cross and then you know he tells the a testimony from the prophet he says that the Lord said to him and he gave him a vision of the mber you see you binded and unbind the m and and he said he said you've got to be more sincere and I was thinking to myself my goodness if he's got to be more sincere wow you know I couldn't think of anyone any more sincere Hallelujah so you see God was calling him to a place where he could entrust him with power and and God is bringing us as individ ual to a place where he can entrust us with power and that leadership starts in your own life how do you lead your emotional realm how do you lead your spirit do you lead your spirit with legalism do you force it upon yourself or are you able amen this is key are you able to catch the anointing are you able to contact God and allow his leadership to lead your spirit that's true benevolent leadership in your own life and until you can master that amen because that's how you're going to lead in the Millennium I believe this is just me I believe that that's how we're going to lead like that not with some horrible Draconian malevolent harsh leadership which is the old school time of Judges stuff it's not going to work we need to we have a we have the grace of God the Capstone himself the very the person of Jesus Christ crying Grace Grace he's come with grace that Grace is available to all of us for leadership Amen to lead Our Lives individually to lead our families as men and for the for the mothers to lead the children with the Fifth Gospel that's ministered to the children while the men are at work and however you know those things and how it all goes amen now to be able to lead in that way because that is a a huge thing in our own lives let's just go back to the word go back to where we were at now and I'll I'll jump into a bit more of that later on it says here in Philippians 3 13-4 says Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before amen I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus this my friends brothers and sisters is the high calling of God Amen the High Calling of God is that you the life that comes out of your uh bows that comes through all the trials all the hardship and you meeting the high priest that life is the high calling that's calling that life is there's a there's a purpose in that life to come out of you there's a purpose there's a there's a place in the very cogs of God's Great Symphony God's great plan God's Great everything that God has planned for this hour comes from that life that comes from you yes amen now that life is got it's the will of God you can't produce it you have to have it you have to get it you have to come to a place where you where where you've really got it really got it and we have the choice now and once you've got it you can still choose now how you administer that because the administration is where people a lot of the times can go wrong or right the sermons and the doctrine can be correct but the but the administration can be wrong how do you administer it to yourself will be how you administer it to your children and to other people and so search thine heart oh man and and search the scriptures and see how Christ does it because we need to continue on because that life we don't bring forth a prophet we bring forth the testimony of Jesus this is where it ties in the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy that's the life that we bring forth that ties into Hannah's life that shows in her life she brought forth a natural Prophet we bring forth the testimony of Jesus the spirit of Prophecy that Spirit of Prophecy is the life of the prophecy that's within you to fulfill the scripture of your life amen to fulfill the verses that pertain to you that's right Hallelujah that's the spirit of Prophecy that's working within you mightily Hallelujah to bring forth the vision so that you're walking in harmony with the notes of the music that God has written Glory that Spirit of Prophecy is is within you Hallelujah and until you get to the high priest Hallelujah and hear the spoken word from his mouth directly Hallelujah that high priest let me tell you from another picture is revelation chap 10 a mighty angel coming down with an open book in his hand saying come and eat from me hear my words yourself Hallelujah hear you listen to the voice of the Prophet but you need to hear the voice behind the voice that's the voice that you can personally hear Hallelujah and if God desires and decides to speak directly to you look to ear then praise the Lord that's also wonderful that's right it doesn't happen as often as we would like it but it does happen amen and God can speak to you hallelujah it's just where are your affections set where is your entertainment coming from what are you what's what's appeasing your appetite amen your affections and your your your imaginations what's appeasing that appetite for entertainment Hallelujah because if that if the tree of knowledge is appeasing that appetite then it's going to be very difficult for you to hear the voice of God because you've got other voices going on there's other things happening Hallelujah your subconscious is listening to the body language of all those movies that is being watched and it's clouding the discernment it's clouding your perception of reality as much as you can reason it out and go it's not true and it isn't your subconscious thinks it is amen it might not be for anyone in this room but someone might listen to that one day but your subconscious believes everything it sees and hears amen and so what you choose to expose yourself to will deter your so your subconscious you've basically told your subconscious this is good this is right that's right believe this and it it comes into your life and it affects you and it affects your judgment and it affects your your prayer life it affects everything either negative or positive it'll take you either way so that's why we have a great choice to choose amen because we have a high calling of God in Christ Jesus that high calling now that because you see Hannah wasn't just to bring forth fruit that fruit had a purpose that fruit that life that came out of hannnah that life had a reason to live that life that Samuel did great things and the greatest thing from my understanding is that he anointed David King so Hanah as an individual now she brought forth a life now catch this think very deeply here she brought forth a life that anointed David King and we're going to get we're going to go right up to Hebron the whole nation anointed David King now that is awesome because there is a unification of the nation but it's because it's not enough for one or two or six or whatever just individuals for them to anoint David King it has to be everybody and until everybody comes together and catches that vision and meets the high priest and becomes fruitful the complete inheritance cannot be attained that's right because because it's not attained until the whole nation is ready until the whole nation has anointed David King they come together and we'll go into that a bit later but I thought I'll drop that there because it's there's it'll it'll release its SE now and we can preach on it a little bit later on where did Hannah get her inspiration you know and this is where we can get this inspiration I want to encourage you God wrote the Bible with people he didn't these people someone yes they pinned it down and wrote the history but that's all they did they just wrote the history but the actual Bible was written with these people's lives they lived a life and they didn't try they didn't just make it all happen and do this oh I got to do this now this is my queue I got to come in here and say this and be there God said no they lived a natural life they worshiped God they had Faith they had to have faith because that's what Bible says by faith they did this by Faith by faith by faith they believed and God then could use that Faith to lead them guide them and and so you see the whole Bible was written by people just living a normal life people walking talking doing worshiping whatever they did they wrote they were writing scriptures and God pended all down and you know how accurate that was how accurate that those lives would test testify of the perfect prophecy of what is happening today only God can do that but you see contained in their lives for us as hanners that have been uh privileged to receive the open book to receive the revelation of the Seven Seals to receive the fullness of God in this hour come down where God would open his book to you he didn't when he opened the book he opened Tamar's life he opened Sarah's life life he opened all these books of life that was written by these people that God wrote he opened their lives and contained therein was rapturing Faith Hallelujah contained in those lives was Faith contained in those lives was your identity Hallelujah because they're part of the land that you're you're laying hold of that's already within you amen they walk that natural land and you've got that spiritually in you and so all those lives was open so that you and me could read them and be encouraged by them and you see now Hannah would have known those stories and she would have held to those story she would have said no but you see Rebecca she was Barren for so long and she believed God and God gave her a baby amen and Tamar you know you see Tamar was an interesting story but you that's a powerful story there Tamar you see she she had to have a baby amen she tried to have a baby of judah's son and then the next son and the next son and they something was trying to stop the king's lineage from coming forth something was trying to stop the lineage of Christ from being manifested but her faith rose up within Tamar's life and she couldn't help herself she had to do something she got desperate Hallelujah and she she did everything in her power to make sure that she had a son Hallelujah that she could have a baby amen and so she believed something rose up within her because that lineage must come forth Hallelujah and I believe that Hannah was encouraged by these stories and that you see something she knew that there was a living God in Israel she knew that he had answered prayers she knew that he had taken woman away from being Barren and couldn't have a baby and she had given and and she knew God would hear her prayer so she got serious with God because she wanted to be fruitful and I believe she got her encouragement from there and you can too you can get your encouragement from the story because you see what God did then he'll do for you today amen you just believe Hallelujah just have faith the devil will try everything he can to try and make you not believe it he'll throw doubts at you like you wouldn't believe that's right but you just resist those doubts you just cast those doubts aside when a negative thought comes in here you cast it aside every time yes it gets a bit worrisome it gets a bit tiresome sometimes sometimes you get attacked all day long never give up amen never give up because those days that you're getting attacked all day long could be the day where a great Victory is waiting for you at the temple Hallelujah you can be a fruitful person and no longer a Pew warmer amen hallelujah glory to God Amen Hannah wanted the reality amen she was sick of warming a Pew it was time to mean business and get her heart in line with the true visitation of the high priest she had to act upon her faith she couldn't just have faith faith without works is dead we can't just sit there and have faith it's not it if you're just sitting there and you have faith and you say you believe that faith is incomplete it's hope because real faith will generate a true work of God it will bring forth fruits Hallelujah 30600 it'll bring forth fruit Hallelujah and we will manifest one of those things and I believe now this is just me but I believe that your your level of fruit is not is not a predestined thing even though God for knows it I believe that that's how what you do with the word it's how you react to the word it's how it's what you do with the word that's been revealed to you and you can choose now how much you're going to do for the Lord you can choose that you can be one of those people that God has to poke and completely like give you a supernatural thing to show you something or you can just take the word with what it says and do it and start acting upon it and see something and go Lord give me a burden for that and go out there and do it Hallelujah and once you start doing that the ball starts rolling you start becoming more like him you start going through greater trials and your character becomes more and then he entrusts you with more of the land amen because you've got the maturity to handle your inheritance that maturity comes from trials that maturity comes from Hard Times hardship oh my glory to his name glory to his name so that life that Hannah brought forth that life anointed David King that life the spirit of Prophecy Samuel but it wasn't enough for Samuel alone it wasn't enough for Hannah alone there had to come A Vision amen and so you see and this is how God works sometimes that Vision starts off with something that seems to be completely opposite and God gave Israel the desire of their heart and and gave them Soul as a King instead of his perfect will which was David because you see now that life that King that needs to be anointed is going to rise to power he's going to have to rise to power and meekness he's going to be an example of that life that you bring forth to show us something there a great lesson that when that life starts to come forth in you you do not need to make it do anything you do not need to try and put it in its position you do not need to try and kill the soul that may be in your life thank you Lord God don't don't touch God's anointed you don't not need to do that that life has got a life of its own it will rise Hannah will rise up Hallelujah it might start with just a little prayer but that's the beginning it might start with just a little time but that's the beginning Hallelujah there is a great thing that's going to rise and rise and rise and continue on until finally here's David that's been anointed and he starts to rise up when you have anointed him king of your heart now it's not by what you say as much as yes confessions good we don't want to eradicate confession because I've just preached almost eight series eight sermons on it but confession is good don't get me wrong but it's not just by what you say it's mainly by what your life says amen that's what is the voice that anoints David King that's the testimony of Jesus Christ not just coming out of here that's just to exert the authority of what's already in here amen but the reality the Thunder the thing that hurts the devil is the life that's lived what's on display amen and I don't mean just on Sunday and Wednesday I mean every day every day that life on display every day that's the thing that hurts the enemy Hallelujah now David being anointed this king and you start to see the fruit come in your life because you've met the high priest and that fruit and you can see it generating and things happening and a desire and a burden and all those things and there may be a saw that comes because the lord always does these things to test you to see whether you are going to operate your gift amen or see whether you're going to allow God to bring it to its position and operate it himself that's the way and you see now David after he was anointed king 12 I don't know how old he was but he was young he's anointed king and the spirit of God was with him from that and he went on his journey and he killed this bear and he killed a lion and he had Faith but you see even after he killed Goliath and the people started rallying around the gift he never put himself in his own position that God had ordain for him that's patience that's why we run this race with patience because there is a balance yes we want to be doing yes we want to be acting yes we want to be working with the Lord and doing the things of God but there's also a balance of Lord Place me Lord where is it Lord let me not try and force my way into anything but Lord you placed me you've anointed me to be this you know to my position as a king and priest yes because that life that Hannah brought forth and came out and became Samuel and then anointed David King that life and the whole process happens within your own heart it happens within you yes and that start to rise up within you and I'm sure I'm speaking to people here that have experiencing this that are experiencing David rising in the heart amen that have anointed David King hallelujah amen because you see you know when you first and we we're just going to go right back now we're going to go back to the time of Joshua and we're going to remember this that Joshua when they crossed over Jordan was like the baptism of the Holy Spirit to us but when you get baptized with the Holy Spirit that's only the beginning of your journey you're just a little B Hallelujah just a little baby and there's so many enemies all around so many troubles and all these things and you realize my that's only the beginning but you have something within you you have a seed of Faith within you you have that down payment within you that token life Hallelujah and that's that that little white button that you get Hallelujah brother brandom says it's like a little white button and it's like that's a light like a little round thing and it comes inside you oops comes inside your heart and it pushes and you feed on the word and you feed on the word and you continue feeding on the word and you worship and you water it and you give it some light and sunshine and eventually that spirit of God Amen takes over your whole life and it pushes you like the grain you know and it pushes out the grain the wheat grain and it pushes out and it takes all the husks and Shu and it pushes them off amen until you until until you can come to a place now where your life anoints David King yes amen so what I'm talking about is not the baptism of the Holy Spirit here I'm talking about the end of your faith I'm talking about where we are at as a as a as an age individuals might still be in Egypt we got to go get them individuals might still be at kades barer about to die and get the Holy Ghost individuals might be you know got the Holy Ghost and they've still got lots of stuff to go on and we've got lots of stuff to go on but you see the age the the time the Rapture the Millennium and all those things right at the door and so you see as individuals we're now posed with a opportunity yes to meet that high priest to get a word from him so that we can become fruitful amen hallelujah and not just sit on a Pew brother brandom said and I shouldn't just say brother brandom said all the time but I like it okay because it's just easier I could take it back to the word he said that you no actually let's just wait we'll wait for that one CU important I think it's important I just go through this first yes let's go through this first just wait when the nation now from Joshua and the Holy Spirit when they got the Holy Spirit and they were here they are in the land and there's all the enemies that are rallying around them and you see God said I will not give you all that land until you've got the maturity and you see now when they get the maturity you'll inherit the land I'll give you another little piece when you get the maturity and it's the same with us you cannot get all of your inheritance at once even though all your inheritance is already in when you've got the Holy Spirit but you can't have access to it all at once because you won't have the character to handle you might get a bit angry one day and fly off the handle and say something and then it will change the world because that power to change the world that power of God that spoke worlds into existence is actually your inheritance and imagine having all of that and yes you do it's and within you already that power but having access to it all but there's some hard trials to go through because David you know they went through all of that until finally they went through the time of judges and then Hannah comes on the scene and here's David and she's got to anoint David King and sorry Samuel anoints David King and David now rises in meekness to his position that's a long process they waited 400 years from the time of Joshua when Joshua took the people across Jordan 400 and something years until David was anointed king that's a long time that's that time has been a bit shorter for us it's been 40 years and now 50 but 40 years in about 200 uh 6 2005 was 40 years that's that's right 40 years from the seals being opened the the the people of this message went through the same thing as Israel went through but now we as a people are in that pivotal position where we can choose are we going to remain in that way or are we going to forget that old Administration and continue now because Christ himself the stuff that people preached about the ministers and the Ministries they were preaching good preaching nothing wrong with the preaching nothing wrong with them and they're all people we're all a work in progress the ministers were a work in progress unfortunately people didn't show their own weaknesses a lot and and the image that they were portraying was just this big put on show and people were really so bad and so wrong on the inside because they were ruling their spirit with malevolence legalism trying to make this image happen trying to make the children do this and trying to make the people do that make the parents do this and separating this and doing all this stuff to try and en force a Perfection upon the people it doesn't work that way can't work that way we have to forget that way we have to forget the way of our fathers naturally speaking now the way our parents brought us up and not all of us may be like that but mine was certain like that I'm sure most raised us in a very harsh way never spoke good things about us never gave us praise or encouragement many people because they were raised that way and the problem that then that that whole model was taken into the ministry and it was ministered that way but now we have to forget that whole thing and and and and if we're suffering from it we need to come down and get prayed for yes and get healing from it so that our life can stop being affected by those old past things amen yes amen it's true we need to get set free and there is a power in this room present today to set you free amen absolutely free to heal you of those small little things that may affect your whole life you can be fully completely restored right now healed you can be healed in your seat as I'm speaking the Holy Ghost is here to heal you just ask just ask right now in your head in Your Heart Lord heal me I don't want to be holding on to the things of the past anymore I don't want to hold on to those pains and hurts that my parents gave me and that Administration the way that they brought me up they meant well maybe some probably didn't but most meant well but it's affected you and it's made you a certain way and it makes it very hard for you to communicate and whatever with people you can be healed right now you can be healed in your seat amen if it's been identified and you know it you know what it is that's affected you all your life you can be healed of it right now just pray right now you can pray you can believe now it can leave you that that scar that pain cuz he's here to bind up the he breach of his people and heal the stroke of your wounds that's right all of them that's right cuz he wants that so that you can in your life your life not just what you say and what you sing on Sunday but your life can anoint David King so that your life can actually do it not because you're trying to make it happen like the old judges way the old Administration but the new administration because you see what was preached about that image that was preached and the opening of the word and the Mysteries and the the great mind of Christ to come down on the people one day becomes flesh amen we're in that day we're in that day yes we're here where what was preached about is becoming flesh now you can choose amen you can choose now and the gift uh we we take it back now because you see we're humans but within each one of us when that life comes forth within each one of us as gifts talents that God has given us he's given us a talent or talents that's when that gets anointed by the age anointed by God and what he's doing now when the I am that spoke to Abraham I am that I am comes to that my this is is deep this is real deep yes but this is real real for us when the I am comes to that gift if you really yield that gift and the complexes and the pains that surround that gift can be dealt with then it's really going to be the fullness of Christ operating and so you can see pastors that are raising up now are pastoring very different from the pastors that just as much in this message and bride and what back in the day different why because they were operating their gift in the age that it was there but there's and I declare that there has been a change amen there has been a change and I and and only by the fruit and by what we're looking at and what we're seeing because a tree is known by its fruit and the fruit of the ministry is changing the gifts are operating different the parenting is parenting different the gift of Father the talent of mother is operating different than it used to be and it's not because we're any better we haven't done anything more other than we're receiving the ministry as we're actually being ministered an entrance into the perfect will of God Amen we're being ministered true instruction and righteousness amen a more perfect way a more complete way of parenting a more complete way of living a more complete way of pastoring a more complete way of evangelizing a more complete way of teaching a more complete way of apostolic missionary a more complete way of life not because we're any better or done anything more or fasted more we probably fasted less definitely fasted less we're not you know those days they were hardworking people they were Ardent men and women that just they were strong in faith they were at every service they never missed a beat amen but the administration wasn't complete because the the the fullness they were preaching it and it was coming out of the the spirit and yes the Divine intelligence would come and they were preaching the Mysteries and the book and all those things but there has to come a time when what's being preached puts on flesh and we are in that time Saints we are in that time and we can make a decision am I going to continue in the old Administration or am I going to walk into the new administration of the king the true headship who's come to the body the true headship is here hallelujah Christ himself and now my life and let my life anoint him King Hallelujah let that be your testimony let that be your prayer let my life anoint him king that's right not just by what I say cuz that words can be very cheap but the life the fruit the reality what's on display is what's really important that's got the the dollar value the gold dollar behind it amen come on that separates the the wood and the the the chips from the gold and the silver amen amen is what the life is hallelujah amen hallelujah because that's the high calling that we've been called to hallelujah amen hallelujah let's just read now from 2 Samuel chap 5 verse 1-3 you can turn there if you like or you can just follow along with me here and this is the unification of the holy nation of Israel Hannah's Revival spreads to become a national Vision Hallelujah a people because you see now where the old Administration is and and this is and don't get me wrong there is definitely the will of God to have a pastor in the church and a local body right amen but the old Administration is it's like me and us and you guys just stay away you might infect us with some funny Doctrine but there is an actual when the head comes when the headship comes he is the Divine Shepherd Hallelujah he can bring the unity Hallelujah and so you see now us as a as a responsibility as a stewardship let's anoint him king of our life let's see what happens when the local body comes together and anoint some king that's right gets really serious really sincere amen hallelujah hallelujah and really convicted about it do you know an Ardent conviction this is Christianity this is this is what I do this is what we do we become rugged we can learn from the old school the old school as much as we want to say how wrong everything was and what not because hindsight's a great thing you see and they were they were in the in the will of God they were going according to the program the program was there the administration was different but we have an opportunity to learn from them also that they were stalwart rugged they were conviction they had real conviction about their Christianity K were committed and they were they they were they stood for what they believed they were strong minded and too strong actually in some places because that's what caused all the divisions and the and the but we can learn from that and not get too casual with our law of Liberty cuz yes we have Liberty and yes the administration's changing because you see the Pastors in this day are allowing God to mature the people rather than them for forcing it upon the people but we can't take advantage of that that's right we don't take advantage of that we have to actually have that conviction that's right Hallelujah God loves that he loves someone that makes a decision and that's it amen when it's right of course I don't want to make a wrong decision and that's it you know we have to we have to have a comma there you know because sometimes we've made a wrong decision and we say that's it and then that's not it amen so we have to be we have to be Discerning and and we always have to have the right nature about us because you see if you lose your lamb nature and become a lion all the time if you lose that lamb nature the dove can't lead you the dove scared of you that Tim and Dove and it sounds a bit weird that the Holy Ghost would be scared of you he's not scared of you he he could destroy the whole earth in a minute and a second but the timidity of that Holy Ghost if you lose your lamb nature and keep going in your line cuz we are a lamb and a lion as well you know we can there are times where the lion comes out you know when you're having a you're talking to somebody or you're fighting the enemy that's right the lion might need to come out yeah but the lamb needs to be out you need to walk as a lamb nature that's right sensitive yes a nature that God can lead yes maleable in the hands of God hey let's get to the scripture here because see more Believers want to anoint the same life as Samuel anointed king so it says here in 2 Samuel 5: 1-3 it says then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron and spake saying behold we are thy bone and thy flesh also in time pass when Saul was King over us thou was he that lest out and broughtest in Israel and the Lord said to thee Thou shalt Feed My People Israel and thou shalt be a captain over Israel so all the Elders of Israel came to the king to heon and King David made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord and they anointed David King over Israel this was the coronation of of for us now this is the coronation of Jesus in our heart and like I just said when we all come together and anoint him King you Watch What Happens because the purpose of all this and the title of my sermon is driving out the jebusite and we're going to read now because here this is the very occasion that actually brought to pass everything that Joshua promised everything that Joshua gave to them who knows the word Beque it means to give the inheritance Joshua was anointed and he he preached the message the message he preaches was all the land and he says here's yours and yours and place the people but now here the event takes place where the final frontier is going to be conquered yes amen and we all have a jebusite you know what that name jebusite means to trample and to thresh and there's something in each one of our Lives some people call it the right punch from the enemy he's got one on each one of us one weakness and sometimes there's other ones as well that you've allowed in but there's always this one thing that's your jebusite that jebusite is going to die that jebusite is going to be conquered yes hallelujah amen that jebusite has got an expiry date amen and yes that jebusite might put some um special needs people out the front to mock you sometimes amen like they did with David they put all the special needs people out there to say ah you can't get in here but David was anointed see David had the anointing he's the king he can do anything yes Hallelujah nothing can stand before him but Israel wasn't access to that power until they anointed him King Hallelujah and you're not access to that power until your life anoints David King amen amen cuz he can't and your life you can say anything you like and and you can confess anything you like but until that reality is in your subconscious until that faith is really down there and dropped into your subconscious it's all Tau it's all hope and there's nothing wrong with hope don't get me wrong we there's things that we're hoping for as individuals there's scriptures that we see and promises that we like and then we're hoping that's right you know what hope is it's an expectation an anticipation with pleasure amen because you know it's yours you know it's yours and you're holding on to it one day that hope will be substantiated because faith is the substance of things hoped for Faith substantiates your hope amen so there's nothing wrong with hope don't get down on the fact that you may be hoping so Hallelujah stay hoping so until you get to substantiation until God comes on the scene Hallelujah that high priest and he says have it it's yours I grant you the desire of your heart and he speaks it to you and it becomes a reality amen hallelujah are you with me amen amen amen praise the Lord so David now they didn't have access to this Israel didn't have access to Joshua yes they did in one sense of course don't get me wrong they did have access Joshua preached it and the mighty Captain was there and he would drive out the inheritance but what did Israel do they went off on another way they forgot about these things the administration of Egypt and the administration of their parents and natural stuff got in the way and they started forcing these things and doing all the stuff that was not really according to the plan of God and they started worshiping Baal and they started going all on different ways and all sorts of worse things happened and almost worse well some places that was worse than Sodom and Gomorrah and these are meant to be the promises children of God and they were doing worse than Sodom and Gomorrah and yes the history in this own message has the same testimonies now I'm not saying that they're elect because yes there's a mixed multitude it comes but you see right through it and I praise God for this there was ruths and rabs and people that went right through that time of Judges Hallelujah that stayed with God through the whole thing it might have been just a few people here and there because God was planning something he was bringing forth a lineage he was waiting for a henna to come on the scene amen waiting for a henna to rise up Hallelujah waiting for someone to hear the voice of Faith within them and someone to get serious and come to the Altar and get and meet the high priest and get a word directly from God God so that their life can become fruitful so they stop just warming a Pew now and actually find their purpose for God find their talent and what it is and refine it down and hone it until they're a well oiled machine amen for God cuz each one of us has talents yes amen and then that life now comes out and flourishes and anoints David King giving you access to the power of God am giving you access to the power that's within David himself the king now we're talking about King Jesus not just David the natural David but Jesus the resurrected Living God the almighty Jesus Christ when your life anoints him King all the power in Heaven and Earth the omnipotence of God is manifested in your own life because he can trust you trustiness Romans 5 let me just quickly read there it's not in my script but I'll just go to it because it's quite it's quite good I'm so glad we're good for time today praise the Lord therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into his grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God Amen hope nothing wrong with it you stand and rejoice and Hope for the glory of God when you look to him and he and and every now and again he just drops in the Revelation he drops in some Faith Hallelujah never stop hoping never stop having that attitude oh God I need you oh Lord hold the scriptures before him hold the verses that are for your life before him never never never give up always Testify the word amen amen and not only so but we glory in tribulations and also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience that word experience is trustiness Trustin us it's one thing for us to trust God and we can easily trust God unless there's complexes that stop us from trusting him and if we go through those but God can deliver us right now but there's another thing for God to trust you can God trust you I ask myself could God trust me and if I look at myself naturally I think oh my maybe not so you see we we're a work in progress amen a work and progress but here it is tribulation knowing that tribulation worketh patience but you're not if you just warm a Pew because this is what I'm dealing I'm dealing with the initial spoken word of the high priest for you so that you can just not just be a Pew warmer but you're you're in a effective member and part of the ministry of God amen amen that your talent is actually changing people's lives that your talent is winning Souls whatever it may be if there's prayer Warrior locked up in one of you in in some of you and you don't know it yet it's time to find out what that is it's time to find your talents for the Lord you know we spend a lot of our life and giving all of our talents to the tree of knowledge and I I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with going to work and we and and we we're very serious about that brother Ed's been finding a job you know you get serious about finding work how much more serious should we be about finding what God wants us to do finding what the talent is inside of us and yes we may have a vague vague is not enough vague yes if you've got a vague and you start putting yourself in a certain place and it's not quite the exact then it's just only going to be slightly effective it's not really going to be in its full effect cuz it's like a cog in the whole machine that's right Hallelujah and when all those cogs and the whole machine come together you know this is when this is Hebron now we're we're talking Hebron now the nation coming together to anoint David King the power that's contained in the very soul of God the power that's contained in the spirit of God the power that's contained in the one that said all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me becomes ours becomes out but you see now and while I was talking about the tent is because when you when that Talent comes into its place my you will go through tribulation for that because now you're fighting the enemy directly now you're really becoming a threat to him he's going to do everything he can to destroy you he's going to do everything he can to take you on a field take you down a path of lust or take you down a path of distraction he's going to do everything and you're going to be bombarded with it my he bombards you before you get that and then he bombards you when you've got it and then he bombards you when your talent's being used more and more and more but what now you see we don't want to shun that never shun it yes intellectually and the flesh is always weak the flesh doesn't want to go through those things but you've got dominion over your flesh that's right you've got dominion over your flesh don't you listen to what your feelings are saying I don't want to go through that it's going to be too hard I don't want to fight directly against the enemy it's going to be too hard I'm going to have to go through trials my goodness man if you only realized the glory and the gold that the trials are amen for you to go through all those things so that you can have patience and then from patience trus in us so that God can trust you because when he sees and you can try and you cannot pull the W over God's eyes you can't just act out a whole thing and think God knows and when you're ready then you can actually go further into your inheritance amen like I said before you need to hear the high priest voice when you've got a need when you when you've got a need you got to hear the high priest you've got to hear him speak you've got to hear him now don't get me wrong about hearing an audible voice because otherwise you know you'll end up going on a a journey that may not be for you but when he speaks it might not just be an audible voice it might be a direct Revelation from the word it might be just a thought that comes directly into your heart whatever way he will speak and you will know you will know when he speaks to amen so don't try and bind yourself to hear the vable voice of God because you might be there for a long time because God might not want to speak to you because we cannot see we we're not twisting God's arm here we're actually making ourselves available for him and when we're serious he will speak CU he wants us to be in our position he wants us to anoint him King but like David he's not going to arise by force yeah he's going to rise in meekness he will never force you to become anything but he in meekness will rise until the soul of your life we're changing the whole kind of picture here but the soul in your life gets cast off the throne amen don't worry it will happen don't worry Hallelujah those complexes of inferiority will go amen amen amen those complexes of soread scared of men we'll go I'm so glad of that because that's one of the ones that I suffered with is the fear of man I don't know why I I I can't find why but that was one of my ones and you know what that's gone Hallelujah by the Lord's Grace amen hallelujah amen all right I'm going to go back to my thing here let's just read now from one Chronicles sorry no we're going to read from 2 Samuel 5: 6:10 this is where gets really really good so you just need to really be thinking now cuz I love this amen it says here and the King and his men went to Jerusalem unto the jebusites that's just basically following on from before the inhabitants of the land which spake unto David saying except thou take away the Blind and the lame Thou shalt not come in here thinking David cannot come in hither nevertheless I love this now remember bring this into the context that now Israel has got access to the power contained in David yes okay Israel now has access to the power and that anointing completely yes under Saul there was there was some same as your life you have some but when this all is ruling in the complexes are still there the full power of David being anointed is not right had come into its full power cuz he's not enthroned completely even though God has made him King here he sees David cannot come into nevertheless Hallelujah David took the stronghold of Zion the same as the city of David and David said on that day whosoever GTH up to the gutter and smiteth the jebusites and the lame and the blind that have hated of David's Soul he shall be Chief and Captain wherefore they said the blind and the lame shall not come into the house so David dwelt in the fort and called it by the city of David and David built round about him from Milo and Inward and David went on and grew great and the Lord God of hosts was with him so you see now Hallelujah that from David being anointed king and Israel gaining access to the power that was within that anointing now the very final frontier of the Jerusalem the very heart of Israel the place where the throne would be the temple the soul of Israel would be conquered because those jebusites that trampled down in the threshing threshed and threshed and threshed and they were the ones that held on the longest but when David was anointed king that final push that final anointing to conquer that right punch that punch ing you all your life can be dealt with amen can be delivered those enemies can be destroyed and he comes up through the the gutter the Honan tunnels and I walk through those tunnels and you see now this is where it comes into to be glorious here you know the Great Captain that was introduced to them when they crossed over Jordan you know the mighty angel that descended down in the middle of this mystery Babylon with the open book that Captain the captain of the host yes it was the captain of The Host that went through the tunnels to open Jerusalem and it's that Captain it's that book it's that Feast that you're feeding on at the king's table amen by the grace of God like Mish feasting amen at the king's table and yes they said that the lame and Hal couldn't come in but there was a Grace from AEF amen there was a Grace that a lame man could come and sit and feast until you know he was look just like the rest amen hallelujah at the king's table amen and you see that Captain is the one in that book that you're feeding off that open word that's why I say you're so important to read the message to listen to the message get that message on listen to sermons make sure you do your flesh is going to tell you no I'm too busy your spirit's going to definitely say no no no reason reason reason but your soul is going to say yes your soul is going to make the decision not your spirit don't let your spirit rule your life amen don't let your flesh rule your life you rule it for he that has no control over his own spirit is like a City built Without Walls amen and the captain of the enemy's host will come in to your hesm monian tunnels and come up and destroy you and let Satan into your heart so you don't want that now I'm not speaking to people that are sealed but you know what I mean you don't want to let Satan influence you you don't want to let Satan in anywhere because if you give him an in you'll take a mile that's right so you want to be now allowing access to the Divine Captain you want to be giving him access Hallelujah to your life amen by anointing David King because once David's anointed king that captain now the captain now Naturally Speaking he came on the scene and he went an open and now read this in one Chronicles he says and David dwelt in the castle hallelujah what was David doing amen David rebuilt I just read it therefore they called it the city of David and he built the city round about even from Millow round about and joab now the captain of the host repaired the rest of the city you see now when you let the captain in and you start feeding on that word your city is being repaired Hallelujah your Jerusalem is being rebuilt amen he is rebuilding your life those tapes are rebuilding your life you're not just sharing information and you might listen to them 10 times and you're getting rebuilt 10 times Hallelujah if you can just have the faith and you can receive them in the spirit they were given if you can recognize what is being spoken what has been recorded onto magnetic tape and caught up in that fourth dimension for you to listen to when you can sit there and go my I am not just listening to a seventh grade Kentucky I'm listening to the voice of God that's speaking to me and it's rebuilding my Jerusalem it's rebuilding me and it's really David dwells in this castle and you see he rebuilt the city of David what was he doing he was rebuilding he was building up the palace because there's a queen that's going to come there's going to be a people you see when your life can anoint David King it doesn't just stop there you don't just conquer the jebusites but you're getting prepared for queenship you're getting prepared like B Sheba amen who brought forth the son of David amen yes the story has a negative tone but we're looking at it prophetically now because you see God bypasses the natural sometimes to show you a prophetic message a prophetic story that a nation anointed the true king king the power of God came into the nation and rebuilt Jerusalem rebuilt the soul rebuilt the people rebuilt the palace ready for the king and queen to come to together why why does the king and queen need to come together because a life needs to come for and that's the real life that's going to come forth that life is the son of David and that's the life that your union with David brings when you anoint him King your life now all the trials and all the stuff that goes on because your life has anointed him King because you have had met the high priest that life now brings tribulation into your life like you wouldn't believe but you see you keep your eyes on Jesus you keep your eyes on him the whole time and no matter what happens you walk unconscious of of all the ridicule you walk unconscious of all those things so you under all those trials and all the maturity that raises up in you and all of those things so that you can come to your position because David rest assured when you anoint him King your Jerusalem is being rebuilt the Palaces are being rebuilt ready for you to come to your queenship ready for you to come to your position as Queen that's ruler that's why I tied in the talents and the gifts because if you can be faithful with the small things he says he that's faithful with the small things I will make him rulers of many cities and who there is great reward by you finding your talent and giving it to the Lord now God himself will operate that Talent when God operates that talent in your life when God operates it not you and it's very easy for you to operate your own gift but when God operates that gift he will operate it according to the very fulfillment of scripture yesen that gift will not take the people already into the Millennium it will not hold the people out in the wilderness that gift will be exactly the voice of the I am that is the everpresent Living God speaking to the people fighting the fight with David ready to take Jerusalem that's where we're at Saints if the musicians could come and just start playing number 48 lest I forget Gethsemane king of my life I Crown thee now thine shall the glory be amen and I'll read this quote while the music is playing if our hearts condemn us the prophecies we want complete deliverance we we don't want to be halfway church we want to be a real church or no church at all we want to be real Christians or no Christians at all we want Total deliverance from our habits from our sins from our evil thinking from our evildoing from our negligence whatever we've done we want Total Deliverance so that when people come into this church to be prayed for there will be just this little group maybe not over a hundred or two sitting here but they'll be completely in the hands of God do you follow me is this all tiing together praise the Lord and when we pray then God will hear from Heaven God wants somebody that he can hold in his hands somebody that he can say I got confidence in I can send this my sick servant to the brandom Tabernacle at Jeffersonville and that group of people are one Accord something will happen now I'm speaking to you as a as us as a group now can God have confidence to send someone to this group amen now it might sound like I'm I'm not angry or anything but I'm just saying I'm excited about it can God have confidence when someone comes here that they're at the they are coming to Father's House they're going to get that total Deliverance can happen Hallelujah their lives can change in a second because there's a people in one Accord there's a people that have got a vision there's are people whose talents are given to God Amen because there's a provision in this room to heal every complex to heal every pain to heal every hurt to heal all the past right now right the second you can be healed and if you want to There's an opportunity for you to drive out the jebusite to drive out whatever inhabitant that would hold you back from your talent from your gift and your life being used by God well look what he does for us in the condition that we're in what would he do if we were one heart and one Accord the only way we can do that is unify our hearts together with Brotherly Love obey the offices of the church and the pastor and the pastor obey God then God works through the pastor through the board down into the church and all together are one unit to the kingdom of God then God will hear when we have UniFi a unified group let nothing bother you don't be dismayed at anything now that's the kind of a person that God ordained to take the land Moses was complete he was a man that wouldn't compromise if there were stews and fusses and so forth he wouldn't compromise that's what God wants us now pharaoh wanted to agree said Moses you all can go but leave your children behind or leave some of your cattle back here that's the way the devil wants a Christian to come it'll be all right for you to join the church but don't never give forgive Jones it'll be all right if you can bring in your if you can go if you don't have to give up your smoking you're drinking you're lying you're stealing you're fault finding backbiting you don't have to give that up just join the church but Moses wasn't a compromiser he wasn't he he wanted complete deliverance he said we'll not leave one hoof behind we'll take everything that belongs to us when we go to Worship the Lord that's the way the church ought to be we'll take righteousness we'll take Holiness we'll take the Holy Spirit we'll take a unified group when we go to the altar we'll be a real group who has that desire who desires to be a real Church real Christians amen totally delivered forgetting the old Administration forgetting the way our parents bought us up doesn't matter you can be healed of those things forget that and walk into the vision where David King Jesus becomes king that headship that Administration is love pure love everything is done in love you see in the atmosphere of love someone that is not right become right amen and an atmosphere of legalism someone that's not right will leave or they will become legal but when there's love that person can grow into the person that God has made them with the law of Liberty Mo that's the way Moses and his group did they got over there and got under the blood you notice until they got under the blood there was no total Deliverance Moses himself he was unified with God but it wasn't but Israel wasn't there still was sin and they murmured against Moses and they said why why do you do this you bring more trouble upon us cuz Pharaoh just doubled their tally of bricks and so forth that was Moses he was completely in the hands of God totally delivered from sheep hurting to H God's she he was totally delivered himself but the people wasn't delivered because there was still murmuring among them one night when God ordained that a lamb should be killed type of Christ and the blood was dipped in hisop which just weeds common humble just put over the lentil of the door and on the post that's when Israel became completely delivered with not a hoof left behind all that belonged to them was delivered their families their loved ones and everything was delivered when they completely come under the blood that's when the church shall be completely delivered when everything comes under the blood when your sins come under the blood when you're smoking when you're gambling when you're cheating when you're stealing when you're lying when wrong somebody make it right you can't bring that under the blood it won't stay you can't bring it something won't let you do it when yourself is completely totally brought under the blood there will be a total Deliverance then you'll have a freedom like you've never known before when everything is brought Under The Blood Bought and sub submissive to the kingdom of God there will be a real Deliverance everything and so as we sing the song Now mean it with all your heart pray it to you can you testify truthfully king of my life I Crown thee now thine shall the glory be can you will you I desire that with all my heart and I'll just read this one quote before we sing now this is a prayer line and this is a lady that's been trampled down by enemies lies but when God says no more Satan there's no more Satan he has to go Hallelujah and God is saying to you no more Satan today no more lies don't listen to them anymore never conf them anymore all the lies that people told over you all the the negative things that your parents may have spoken to you reject them renounce those things that's not you it's not you anymore this morning this afternoon you have total Deliverance right here and so your life can anoint him King so all of the problems that are surrounding the talents in your life can be cleared away at the foot of the cross at the foot of Calvary at the feet of Jesus tonight this morning you can be set free completely heal in your seat I'm not calling an altar call for you to come and pray though you're allowed to but when we sing as the words gone forth you can be freed right now you can have Absolute Total deliverance and be born again by the spirit of God if you need that now Hallelujah you don't have to earn it it's given freely free to you Hallelujah he says here now look sister now let me tell you something you can't get hold of yourself Satan tells you you're going to lose your mind and everything you will if you continue on but look here see here look you got to get hold of yourself before you can do anything the blessing up on there you wouldn't get out of this building till Satan would tell you wasn't nothing to it and then when he does you're lost back again see you've got to get your up here see you've got to believe you're well and then go you believe that you're healed then go and act like it see just go thanking God don't even say nothing about nervousness no more go on don't accept nothing that the devil gives you I tell you that never accept anything that the devil gives you never accept any sickness that the devil gives you never accept any mental illness that the devil gives you never accept any depression or anything that the devil gives you never amen you might have to go through it but don't accept it because your hope will turn into Faith one day Hallelujah and you will be total delivered amen from everything so that your life can anoint David King and then youve got access to the power that's in David I can't stress that enough I know I've repeated it myself but that's true this is where we're at Saints this is where we're at this is where the age is at we're right at the brink where the sun of David is going to sit on the throne of the Millennium and so you can see that Jerusalem is being rebuilt so you can see that the jebusites are starting to be delivered out of people's lives Hallelujah now I don't say it's just one day but the process isn't happening now the process is happening Hallelujah the nation the people the church is coming together we're becoming an invincible Army hallelujah praise His holy name amen give him praise and when he does you're lost back again you see don't even say nothing there says you but you believe you're healed and go act like it just go thanking God don't even say nothing about nervousness no more she was nervous go on don't accept nothing the devil gives you just go on thank God you've been all scrupled up in your life too I see that all kinds of mixups now you go on believ in God you're a little nearsighted too aren't you when you read anything you hold it close to you I seen you when you was just a little child in school now you go on and believe God and you're going to get well now go shouting and rejoicing and thanking God hallelujah amen and that is the attitude regardless of how you feel regardless of your circumstances amen your testimony is what the word the Bible says about you that's what your testimony needs to be amen let's stand let's sing that song King of my life I Crown the now let it mean something more to you this morning let it mean the reality king of my life
