are revelations 12 day and night and they overcame him now they're talking about me then they talk about you they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death therefore rejoice ye rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell on them woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth he hath but a short time I'm glad he's got a short time has expired date is here Amen god bless your friends you may have your seats this morning like to speak about having a and and this will become more clear as we come as we journey along this morning but I want to speak about having a clear title now we know the devil as as we read he's the accuser of our brethren he he had a right through thee through the ages to to stand before God and and excuse the saints before God saying you know they did this and she did this and they did that and they were born wrong and you know they were born with a full of nature and look what they did and the and and and he has a right you know to to stand there and and tell God everything that you have done accuse you of it now but there comes and into that so I don't just wanna you know so because well we'll get there I just don't want to fire it all out in one go so you know but but the word accuser means to be one that is a plaintiff that is to charge with some offense to accuse or to object so to be the accuser of your of the Brethren he's the one that charges with summer feet so he charges you saying look hey God they did this and they did this and they thought this and this is how they are and this is their natural lineage and you know and and and this is how they think and this is how they act and you know cuz the devils are he's a person of detail too you know so he wants to hold those things because he knows God is holy and he knows that if he can if yes you're the devil can make basically God agree with him that you deserve to be destroyed then then then the whole plan of God's and jeopardy because God can't lose one son or one daughter he says all that the father has given me Jesus had already given me will come to me and all that comes me I'll no wise cast out so you know so the devil knows if he can just get one attribute of God I mean to be destroyed then he's won the whole day doesn't matter if he goes down with the ship hey he's gonna go down he's trying to drag everything every everyone he can down with him amen but so so he knows if he can get one then he's won amen right so am i doing something okay so he has a so so becomes but there comes a time it comes a time where where the devil cannot go no more and accuse now we read yo oh yeah we weren't read it well you don't need to turn to it but enjoy one and six think you know there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them so Satan had a right to go up into heaven go before the throne of God actually have a conversation with God and God gentleman he allows his enemy to come and talk to him right but but when we come to revelations four and five and this is where I've got my my thoughts form of having a clear title where John John we know as a symbolic of the Bride of Christ one man in a vision represents the whole body of people you come down to the seventh church age after the seventh Church agencies their voices speak with me was now up in heaven a door was open and their voice said come up hither and I'll show you things and so John was transported from the earth taken up into heaven speaking of the translation of the bride at the end of the seventh age right so so one man in a vision represents a whole body of people so John is a representation of you in the scripture I mean that's why the book of Revelation is the bride's book it's not everyone's book its veiled amen for a reason right but it's revealed to those that God wants to reveal it to so we represent John represents us hallelujah I trust if you could just you know if the Lord would just reveal that to you the book of Revelation would be very precious to you I mean because you know where you've been where you're going and where you are hallelujah so now so John has lifted up now but in this scene in in Revelations four and five we have the Lord sitting on the throne he sees him right he sees the four cherubims around the throne he sees them he sees the four and twenty elders representing all the redeemed through the ages hallelujah he sees him he sees the angels all around but when the lamb comes to step forth and take the book there's one person that is not there and Satan is not there right Satan is not in that scene he's not present why because he's been cast down he can no longer stand and accuse I mean because the lamb steps forth hallelujah and now he comes to claim what belongs to him and if he claims what belongs to him therefore every accusation that the devil could hold against his property has been struck off I mean there's nothing that the devil say oh no that one's mine or she's my no he's mine because of their sin because of their fall I mean no all of those things have been struck off Holly the devil has no no more to stand as the accuser he is cast down hallelujah there has to come a time you gotta read revelations four and five you weren't fine the devil there why cuz he is cast down I mean that's why we ever we have a reason to rejoice I mean where the devil's voice must be silenced hallelujah and it's the blood of Jesus Christ our lamb stepping forth silences he accuses voice amen hallelujah amen if you recognize the devil has no hold or no claim at all on you hallelujah that should make you happy and free and glad the devil's got no claim on me even with what we remember we did God says I don't I don't attribute that to them hallelujah death they're born of me hallelujah and what I am I cannot send my attributes sure and then they're part of me hallelujah so what they did in their flesh is not attributed to them he following me holy even though we may have the memory of it that's why we've got to recognize God took our shame he took our guilt I mean he took our he took all the bad parts of us washed it clean stuff hallelujah then he doesn't attribute it to you blessed is the man that God does not impute sin to amen in the only way he can not impute sin to us by perfect blood that He shed for you yeah so the devil's not there when the lamb takes the book now we know that their book as a as as the ABS is the title deed to the earth so so it's everything that Adam fell forfeited in order to fall with Eva's wife to try and redeem her but you're off also a represented in their book let's say it's a symbol of you as well when the lamb takes because member Jesus died see it's one thing to purchase something but then it's got to be claimed right it's got to be actually what you buy that's like you buy something in the store you don't just go buy it then don't take it away with you right you go you go buy it you say this is mine you you you pay the pay the money you pick it up you walk away and it's like on the internet you may buy something on the internet if it doesn't come to you then you begin to complain where's the thing I have bought where's the thing I have purchased haluya and it's the same thing with our Lord he purchased our salvation on Calvary struck off all of the sins that were held against the Old Testament Saints because the blood had blood of bulls and ghosts just covered their sin but when Jesus died he he he he washed all their sins way that they could have seen hallelujah up and to you know you know hide them where they were in the waiting place rights and so so he struck off all their sins but he didn't just strike off their sins he struck off all the bride down through seven Church ages I mean so so what he did that day didn't just deal with what had been past but what would be future hallelujah because garden is mind when he thought of you he says I I see them redeemed I see them in my image I see them like me I see them around the throne I see me seen them at the wedding supper I see them in the New Jerusalem I see them rejoicing hallelu that's how he saw you right I mean he didn't see us this is Syria he didn't see us in our struggles he didn't see us in our hardship hallelujah he didn't see how we are right now our bodies our spirits our souls are redeemed right but he didn't see us in this fallen condition and eternity holy he knew you had to go through it to develop character holy he knew you had to go through this because you want to say Satan I'm going to show you something I'm going to show you the power of my blood as more than enough I mean to keep her people to cause them to be overcomers and then to cause him wholly to walk in victory no matter what age they're in holy no matter what condition no matter what circumstances are against them I'm going to show you the power of my sacrifice I'm going to show you the power of my atonement hallelujah so you know God knew we would be here he's not worried we shouldn't be worried I mean remember the scripture says we were all means that where my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock so there come a times when we feel overwhelmed we can't handle what even just life can get just too much and we feel overwhelmed but there's a we can say Lord lead me to the rock lead me to you which is higher than I holy well I don't know the answer you know we can get so frustrated why do we get frustrated because we can't see a way out hallelujah that's why we get so or because we can't see an answer they say Lord lead me to the rock lead me to the rock which is higher than I hallelujah and then you get led to him holler you just have you can just let off the pressure Amen every everything that builds up pressure has to have a release valve otherwise it goes kaboom right that goes kaboom hallelujah we need to let off the pressure and the best the only way to truly lead off the pressures get into the prints of God just relax amen I know even coming to church can build up some tension right because you like Lord speak to me deal with me Here I am meet my needs it can actually build a tension but just relax you want to see the supernatural relax I'm sitting at his banqueting table hallelujah just enjoy it you know a thing I've seen before yo you take your spouse order you know you're out on a date and if you hear you want to take them to a certain place and you know and you get so tense I've got to get a park right by the door the tables going to be at the right place you know y'all hope there's not too many people there want the right kind of atmosphere yeah it's so kind of tense as the food hot and offers a call ever I should ordered that you know I need to drink yeah and you get so caught up and those things the you you forget who you're sitting with having and having a meal with you know you get so tensed you actually missed the blessing that you're actually in that's the same thing with you know here where he he put me at his banqueting table and his banner of me as love her lujah so I think we should just be happy Lord you found me you found me lord I was lost and undone I thought I had life all mapped out but you know I had my plans but you came and interjected my plans following you showed me no don't go this way go this way hallelujah he took me by the heart hallelujah let me up into glorious places and it's been worth it all amen so you know we should just be happy hallelujah now what's wonderful about the Old Testament as Redemption has woven through the law and a and an Israelite had a right to be redeemed or to go free like the year of Jubilee they had a right of faith if they chose to because the law is full of cycles and not every cycle is a bad cycle right because cycle you can say well I'm in a bit of a hard period of life it'll come to an end I'm going through a struggle it'll come to an end right I'm going through you know maybe the children are being children you know they'll grow out of it hallelujah I'm going through a time of my life it'll go I'll grow out of it these cycles in life hallelujah but and it's the same thing with the law there's cycles of yo 50 years and Jubilee and different things like that but that shows that now those things that can be redeemed must be redeemed they must be restored like those who you know if someone you know had to forfeit property sell themselves into slavery if they wanted to go free the law said they had to they had to go free by the word said they must go through to a certain time and so now everything that is redeemable must be redeemed okay so now brother baron when he's when he's preaching the breech and I'm gonna I'm gonna go through it a bit but you know he comes into the story of Ruth and he sees about the lamb taking the book he says he says Boaz marrying Ruth as a beautiful picture of this this is where I wanna kind of dwell for a while to hear us so here's Nate so here is Naomi she goes with her family into Moab she loses her father and and her two sons and laws and now she hears this grain back in Israel and so she decides I'm going back home I'm going back to what I forfeited when I left I'm going back to it and then so Ruth decides she's going to go with she says you're gonna be my god your people my people will you die all die she just made a clear-cut decision I don't know where we're going but I'm going I'm following you so now here a woman that because because Noemi had lost some ground and because Ruth as her daughter-in-law she's actually standing in a place where there's a dispute over her because she has to be redeemed so here she is she's carrying this now I I trust this comes out because I'm gonna say God God is so intent on redeeming his people he can't God doesn't like God loves to settle disputes right the devil loves to continue disputes on he loves her he just if he could he was and he's tried to stop the plan of redemption coming to its climax right so he loves disputes he wanted to continue on but God says no there comes a time where this is done there comes a time when there's no more dispute I'm gonna wind it up you're going to shut up devil you're going to burn and we're gonna roll into eternity that's what God God always brings things to an end so there here comes here comes Ruth with her with her pain with her you know her husband dying her brother-in-law dying you know coming from a place you know she's got all this yo she's carrying all this but yet she's carrying something else she's carrying the ability to be redeemed because of who she is hallelujah so here she's she's got to find someone which will actually settle that dispute in her life hallelujah so here she is carrying this she wasn't skipping happy from from Moab unto Israel she wasn't rejoicing she lost her she lost her husband lost her brother-in-law lost her father-in-law and she's gonna go into a foreign land where she doesn't you know she's not even by the law not even allowed to come into the congregation of Israel but yet there's something in her that there's a dispute and it has to come to an end because Noemi says I'm gonna go back and and she has a parcel of ground that has to be restored to her and the only way cuz she can't do it are you glad you can't do it are you glad you can't do it and then so and then so Nomi comes back she's got a piece of ground that her husband had but of course that was four footed because they left the land and so now that has to be restored to her and the only way that can be restored to her is that if someone over near kinsman someone who's family will come by the law and and and purchase it back for her hallelujah but then there's not only that there's also now and their cousin must must marry know me to raise up as the Bible says seed for the dead par lujah so now it's not only the land that has to be restored but it's also Nomi has to be married and that's the only way that the sorry Ruth has to be married hallelujah I got some prompts appreciate that uh you know yeah anyway so so someone has to marry roof and this is you now here you are you're carrying this who's going to settle my dispute who's gonna who's going to clear this all up you're not going to clear it up you can't clear it up amen you can't you can't be redeemed by your own ability so now here she comes she's carrying this with her pain with her bad memories of you know with her hurt but here she is and she comes into Boaz is filled and then now there comes a time so so so the head Reaper points out you know Boaz comes to the field the chief Reaper is there organizing the laborers and then so your bow is awesome who's this damsel and the chief rumor says this is this is this is Ruth hallelujah means for the chief Reaper introduces Boaz to Ruth and he goes off the scene brother bran was the chief Reaper we're living in a harvest day amen he pointed out what he point out Boaz the mighty man of wealth our Lord Jesus Christ he pointed you out to him hallelujah the message pointed you out to him and then now the Lord looks at you and says I've gotta settle this because there's a dispute who does the bride belong to because the devil says no by their first birthday - I have claims on them because of their first birth I made their forebears fall and every generation has been born wrong - therefore I have claims on them within God's no no they're mine but he's got to do something see God doesn't just talk about it he does it right he doesn't just say yes this and this and this and promise the world no he actually delivers so what he says he'll do he will do I mean so now his boys he's got to settle this dispute because he's a question over Ruth's life and then he goes to a near kinsman and then he says you know are you willing to redeem Naomi's field her position yes but then he also says well if you're you know but then you also have to marry roof he says I can't do it so forfeited it so then Ruth got married to Boaz and then now so so what did Ruth do I mean what do Boaz do all of that all that Ruth was he took care of it he's a mob itis he was a widow you know she wasn't even meant to be in the congregation of Israel but then by him marrying her he took away her past and gave her a new identity hallelujah so now so now every dispute oh she has no right to be here what's she doing in the land she wasn't even born here she doesn't belong here he can say no no she is she is my wife holy abayas you saying that a ruse is my wife she has every right to live in Bethlehem because she is married to me Holly so what they do clear every dispute that can be held against her Amen it's just like just like um you're Rahab married Salman from from Judah here she was she as a harlot she as a Gentile but by being United with salmone hallelujah she had a right to be in the promised land every dispute I mean and when Jericho was destroyed her past was destroyed holiest so none of her accusers could stand all the evidence of her old life was eradicated Pollan so she had a right Amen to dwell in the promised land by being United with salmone lujah why God showing I take care of it that all disputes are struck off hallelujah Amen why do we the devil wrestles he yo he fights with us doesn't he he fight here he brings our past that brings our humanity how we think those things and he tries to pin us down by who we are doesn't he yeah and sure because of this you know because of our first birth you know we are still a flesh body but we are not only that but we redeemed hallelujah so now because of that our souls are redeemed but our bodies are not redeemed we need a body change I mean but that doesn't remember but that doesn't change the fact we redeemed just because we're living in these fallen bodies it doesn't mean our souls aren't redeemed remember the devil has the right to make you sick because of this the devil has the right to fight you in here but depends what you do at the thoughts I mean but he can't get your soul I mean your soul was never has and never will be has it's God's and that's why she does blood on coverings is their souls belong to me hallelujah amen so so sure he can say you know he can fight you in here that doesn't make you an unbeliever he can fight you in here but that doesn't make you an unbeliever right he can't get your soul though well yo my battles come in trouble comes and what's the first thing we begin what yo what's the first thing the devil tries to a road when those things happen I do you really have it arolea believer he really sincere is it just me he does that do see that's what he so he's trying to break your foundation of who you are but when God looks at you he doesn't hold those things against you Pete he became flesh because he wanted to take on human battles he wanted to know what it was like to be a man in order to understand your daily life to understand your thought processes understand what it's like to have struggles I understand what it's like to be tempted hallelujah undeclared how God understands us I mean he understands what it's like to be a teenager he understands what it's like to be an adult he knows what it's like to be a child he knows what it's like to be rejected to be misunderstood to be retiro to be made fun of he understands hallelujah so when you when you go through the same things he's his child I know what you've gone through cuz I walked those same places he was tempted on all points yet without sin huh all points so whatever point you name he was tempted so he knows what it's like for it to be put in front of him but he knows what it's like to overcome that thing who you now well the brem sees in the breach because if we read in Revelations 5 it comes a time when John doesn't weep no more the devil's not there and he's weeping he says I wept much it's got 2 revelations 5 and 5 because it's John here's the 1 he walked with Jesus he saw Jesus resurrect you know he saw incredible things but now he's looking he said who's worthy to take the book who's worthy not just do you know to actually claim all of creation back he says and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lamb I'm inside the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals off and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth and he came and he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of the saints there comes a time when these prayers are actually released and they're answered and they sang a new song saying now i worthy to take the book and to open the seals role for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made unto us kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth so they came a time with this where they were now going to sing a new song because God had opened himself to them he had done something that he had not done in the past right they knew him as their sacrificed their high priest I mean but they'd never known him as stepping forth and taking the book and opening the seals they never knew him in this way so they sang a new song holy earth they hadn't you worship hallelujah they weren't just singing the old songs are singing new ones after which tied him with what God was doing in their day hallelujah so now they begin to end in now John he begins to rejoice because he knows that because he was because without a man stepping forced to take that book the devil can still lay claims and say they did this and they do this and they said this there's still disputes but now when someone steps forth a man hallelujah sets forth and takes back everything that Adam lost he's actually declaring to the devil now I have purchased it now I've claimed it you have no part in them you have no part in this world and then you have come to your end hallelujah now it's settled wholly there's no more dispute devil you can't accuse you can't say but-but-but because now your buts have come to an end hallelujah all the disputes are gone hallelujah I mean that's why they sung a new song that's why we can truly now sing I am free free free from this world of sin Holly I never I no longer do the works of the flesh hallelujah I don't I'm not it's just a religious person no more I'm free hallelujah we got to come to a place with a bride recognized as I'm free I'm free from whatever my parents did in the end and we're given to me I'm free from the culture of this world I'm free from the influences of this world I'm free from sin there's no more sin working in my and my body no more hallelujah I'm a free person hallelujah well how do you overcome you got to recognize what God has done for you amen that's how you overcome it's not you overcoming it's him overcoming in you hallelujah amen let him just anoint your faith hallelujah and spy your faith now he sees in God hiding himself in simplicity he says then when a man before he send it he says he says when a man sinned he separated himself from God and closed and cross the great chasm and put himself in death on this side he left there's no way back exactly there was no way for him to get back but when he did he accepted a substitute which was a lamb or a goat or a sheep or something for blood which Adam spoke Abel spoke of on the other side of the chasm on that side he's the son of God he's an offspring from God he is an inheritance of of the earth he can control nature can speak into existence why he's a creator himself he's an offspring of God but when he crossed he separated his sonship he's a sinner by nature he's under the hands and Dominion of Satan right this is those who are on the wrong side of the chasm they still do the works of this world they're still under the influence those who overcome overcome right they don't just say I am saved by grace and still wallow on and sin that's not overcoming that's not having victory they're actually just confessing something they don't possess I mean but those who really have faith will possess it amen just like Caleb said that mountains mine I believe it he got it hallelujah he didn't just talk about it he really dwell on that mountain hallelujah I mean that's why she'd always have a positive confession my God is able I mean he's purchased a time in the blood is more than enough his Redemption is more than enough I meant more than enough to cleanse me to heal me to redeem me it's more than enough to keep me from furnace water well enough to make me an overcomer you've got to confess it hallelujah what did David do this Goliath bring me a man the great challenge what did David say what's this uncircumcised Philistine doing here why is he defying the armies of the Living God here he was he confessed it no I can kill this man hallelujah and he did it because it was revealed to him it can be done he didn't confess what the other people are saying around them you got to be careful what kind of atmosphere you built and your home in conversations if you're if you you know if you always talking negative and how can this and I don't know and your what kind of atmosphere that doesn't build faith it just builds doubt holier we shouldn't build down now homes you're building faith God's more than able how's this going to happen we need prayer first I don't know but he's able to do it I mean how's this going to work out I don't know I don't know the way but he knows the way amen hallelujah if we knew what would happen to us every day from now to the rapture we wouldn't need faith this is a walk of faith there's a walk we don't even where's this going Lord I'm walking according to your word but I don't know where this is going he says just just believe and walk hallelujah hey our faith is tested isn't it has to be tested what's the other thing as brother and Paul said what is good what what good is faith without it being tested only it's got to be put to the test so now and God took a sacrifice a chemical of the blood but the blood of bulls and goats did not divorce in it only covered sin if you've got a red spot on your hand and cover it with white the red spot still there see it's still there but God sent down from heaven a bleach person it was the blood of his own son that's it when our confess sin drops into blood God's bleach try to find it again the coloring of sin goes back through the mediators goes down through the time until it hits the accuser Satan and lays on him till the day of the judgment I mean because there's got to be it's just like in the garden God came down he says Adam where are you he knew where they were but he comes down to their level we're here and then Adam and Eve sinking was changed by the fall saying God's angry at us he's going to say we were scared what where did they get that thinking from wasn't from God amen that was from the devil right but now God comes down and now he's going to take care of this so so he asked Adam Adam what happened well the woman you gave me did this so he's blaming he's blaming God for his predicament but his own choice got him there that's human nature isn't it right and in and in and in and in so now it passes now Eve what happened the serpent and then now the serpent has no answer so now everything that happened has put on the serpent how lujah because God always gets down to the bottom of it you know it's like you you know you walk into the room and your children you know they're all this one's crying this one's angry this one's this you gotta go okay now what happened I got hold on what happened and then finally you boil it down boy this happened amen and so God does that because someone's gonna pay someone's gonna pay and it's not it's not it's not God's children's going to pay totally if someone's gonna pay for this and it's not us hallelujah it's not you and I that's gonna pay I mean but the devil's going to pay that's why when yours when your sinners confess into the blood of Jesus Christ how do you do that out of a sincere heart say sorry Lord come me and your blood forgive me I'm wrong hallelujah then what happens debts confess yet to the blood of Jesus Christ it's not covered it's taken from you but someone's gonna pay where does it say go goes I know who started this in the beginning and in the devil gets the mail he gets a package and he's got to carry that to the day of judgment hallelujah amen amen now he's free what happens what happens to the son he becomes in perfect fellowship with the father again see the blood is so perfect that puts us back in perfect fellowship hallelujah takes away the chasm brother Brahim says the blood puts us back on speaking terms with God isn't that wonderful so are you just talking into the air I mean you talk to him he talks back to you hallelujah I'm glad we can talk to him and you a man takes all our worries away hallelujah so he becomes in perfect fellowship with the father again standing on the other side of the chasm with no remembrance of sin against him no more there is no more stain of bleach can be seen anywhere he's free hallelujah this is that Clorox oh that ink can never be inked no more because it's broke up and sent back again and when confessed and has confessed and being dipped a man or a woman's been dipped into the blood of Jesus Christ it kills all symptoms every molecule of sin goes back to the devil and laid on him to the day of judgment where his eternal destination will be thrown into a lake of fire hallelujah and the chasms bridged never to come and remembers no more immense it's justified as the Son of God hallelujah the devil's gonna burn because what he made you do everything you did is attributed to him hallelujah amen now it says speaking of Ruth he says the Book of Ruth gives her so there's about taking the book The Book of Ruth gives a beautiful picture of us how Boaz and no me had lost the estate you know he says so Boas had become a redeemer he's the only one that could he had to be a kinsman and their kinsman and in redeeming know me he got Ruth that was Jesus Boaz type in Christ and when he redeemed Israel he got the Gentile bride so then you see so every face is so very beautiful police is now notice he must be a kinsman see he couldn't do it as an angel cuz we're not we're not conferred to angel right he see a man can do it must be a man but it can't be born of a woman as a sex act so the virgin birth the Holy Spirit overshadowed Mary therefore Jesus was not a Jew Jesus was not a Gentile Jesus was God I mean we don't worship you know yo hood I heard um brother man sat the other day I don't worship a Jew because he wasn't a Jew he was a Gentile he was God made Immanuel God with us God made flesh hallelujah he was the holy created blood of God we're not saved by Jewish blood neither saved by Gentile blood we're saved by the blood of God that's according to the Bible it says so - so you see Jesus was God he was not the third person not the fourth person not the second person he was the person he was God you see he was God Emmanuel God came down from his glory and revealed himself hallelujah now let's go to Isaiah 54 and 16 because I'm sure we can just get our rejoicing shoes on and we can recognize God's blood is more than enough so you see the battle always as the devil comes against you but you've got to point him to your sacrifice right because it's your sacrifice the word you have received makes the difference and I'll come into that soon right so it's what you have received makes the difference it's not you that makes a difference Amen so Isaiah 50 for in 16 he says behold I have created the Smith to blot the coals in the fire and that bring us forth an instrument for his work I have created the waster to destroy that God just made him no weapon that's formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against the in judgment thou shalt condemn so when the devil comes against you you've got to condemn that voice I meant when when the devil comes against you I'm just gonna repeat it when the devil comes against you you're going to condemn that voice I mean you shouldn't agree with them oh you fell don't say yes I did fell know once it's confessed just get back up God doesn't remember it hallelujah amen you know you can delete something off a hard drive but people get software and go find it again when God deletes your sin from your record you can't find it so every tongue that shall rise against thee in the judgment thou shalt candy I was talking about spurts coming against you well hallelujah you've got to condemn that you got to think where did this thought come from it wasn't God hallelujah you've got to condemn it why because you've got a perfect blood I meant this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me saith the Lord so the reason that you can rise up and condemn every tongue that comes against you every spirit that comes against you is because your righteousness is of him hallelujah we have his righteousness glory to God I'm glad I'm his righteousness God is righteous by the blood of Jesus Christ amen now as I said so but but what the devil has done as well is down through 7 Church ages is that as that white horse began to ride and and put bringing the deeds of the Nicolaitans he was bringing false doctrine against the church because when the church was birthed it was free amen Pentecost gave a free born people hallelujah because what happened now was there they were in the upper room and they had claims to what God had done but now they are waiting for something to come and clear all claims against them hallelujah just like you go buy a piece of you know you know brother Brown calls about man abstract title deed so what that means is it's like you go buy a house if there's any anyone else that Scott claims against their property then you can't buy it cuz that dispute has to be settled I mean before you can actually take possession of what you've bought hallelujah so now here's God and the devil saying oh but yo you just think about those in the upper room Peter tried to kill a guy he wasn't just trying to wound him cut off his ear he was trying to take off his head but he wasn't a swordsman there was a woman at the well being married too many times right looking for love in all the wrong places there was Mary Magdalene that had Seven Devils cast out of her hallelujah you know Matthew worked for the IRD so you know you know here's the tax collector you know there was all everyone there was broken you know you could say lives were ruined you know outwash of the world they were up in the upper room hallelujah all those kind of people so the devil will say I have claims on those 120 I've got claims god they're mine by their first birth to their first nature they received they are mine so now there's a dispute hallelujah but now the abstract brother says now they're waiting for the Holy Ghost to come the abstract to come down to the title hallelujah so now when the Holy Ghost came upon them God was proving to them everything the devil could hold against you and has held against you has been struck off how they said every single thing that devil held against you has been struck off malius from now so now they were they weren't just title holders they had an abstract title so that means everything that Christ died for they now felt it to a mean said you know yours just like you know you know it's just like Moses taking the children of Israel and - well Joshua did it took them into the Promised Land there were nations in that land that said it belongs to me right Jericho said no this is belongs to Jericho AI and whatever more so now what happened God came down and said I'm going to strike all these people off the deed I'm going to push them out of the land that everything that I have given you in the promised land you will possess it hallelujah and then what happened God came down took over the battle he lead them in the battle they took Jericho they took they either took every paddle and hallelujah amen and that was and we know that was finally fully done under thee under the rulership of King David they took the fullness of the land hallelujah amen now so there has been no now when when Samuel and and I'll just go into this quickly now when Samuel took the annul he's told Samuel took a Horn of oil and and and he was instructed to go to Jesse's house and anoint one of his sons because one of his sons had been prepared as a king of Israel now he took that so here was a vindicated prophet he took the Horn of anointing oil and he didn't just dribble a bit I believe on on David's head he poured the whole thing out so anointing an anointing was released upon an age right so when for a time of Judges Saul fails now a kingship was going to be established the hair he took the Horn of anointing oil and poured it out hallelujah and it all went over David so now what was in the horn the the the the anointing oil horn what was in it was now upon a man so God poured out the fullness of that anointing upon a man David hallelujah so now here is a man who has gone to fully establish the kingdom everything every part of the land that was promised to Joshua right King David is going to take it now amen and so here he was so so the anointing was fully poured out on him and then what was in David came to life amen so now but then they had anointing that came upon David at what you know didn't just fall on him it fell on his mighty men right the anointing that was on him fell on his mighty men they did great exploits fighting battles and it wasn't Hollywood it wasn't choreographed it was just all that bloodshed but one killed 800 you know your others stood and did great things why was the anointing that was on David because they knew he was coming into power fell upon them but then just fall upon them I mean David received the play for the temple rites the what was in the horn was now being manifested through an Ag following me I mean so that wasn't just on now the plans for the temple but then David you know his inspiration came upon the musicians came upon the singers right so what was in the horn came upon him came upon the mighty man came upon the musicians came upon the priests I mean when David brought the ark unto thee and to the you know into the city and it was building the tabernacle of David he wasn't an outer court there anymore is just as your center tent and those who gathered round their tent around the Ark they received the inspiration from the word hallelujah I mean so so all of that was in the horn and it was poured out now here we are here we are living in this day where we have received a vindicated prophet a proven prophet vindicate / vindicated and wasn't it what was he really told to do take the horn take the word pour it out pour it out upon a people hallelujah that's what is in the word will become manifested everything that was in the horn put on flesh hallelujah wasn't just now just an anointing that sat there know when God pours out his anointing I mean when God pours out his word as to manifest what's in his word when Samuel you know God told um yo yo I believe it's in Genesis he says now the scepter shall not depart from Judah until Shiloh come right so there will be a kingship come out of Judah so that was fulfilled when David became King because he came out of Judah Allu yeah right so now here was the kingship and Judah so the anointing that was poured out from Samuel made that manifest hallelujah I mean so so here comes a vindicated prophet in this day because it's got to be a time where the day of judges or the seven churches comes to an end rice no longer revival people come free the devil comes in with false doctrine different things binds them down and then and then you know other people get free and then they get bound down by the devil again there's got to come into that right the Lutheran's came out of the Dark Ages Jesse I lived by faith they were free they see now how can we organize this to keep it as it is they put a pier at the end of their beliefs put God in a box God couldn't God cannot be bound he's got to move on in the Methodist different ones rose up but they put God in a box God cannot be boxed so God has to move on while the people get free but then they say how can we keep this and we control it they try and control and the good intentions put God in a box God has to you know the cycle of revival and death continues down through but there has to come a time when that cycle has ended hallelujah where it's not just revival and death its revival how they're just unfolding as I said these bad cycles is good cycles we happen to be living in the best cycle I mean where where where time is coming to an end and time is blending with eternity how it's just like when Samuel came along he anointed David there was now the end of Judges had come to an end now a different cycle was coming into Israel I mean when now the kingship was going to be established hallelujah it's just like now we have a vindicated prophet come to this age he poured out the anointing why because the millenniums coming I meant the cycle of time is coming to an end the cycle of the church ages has come to an end hallelujah amen so now in that in that anointing oil and that horn that was poured out as I said was David as mighty men the singers the musicians I mean there was the worship all those things were the plans for the temple that was all poured out lujah so now here we are and God has poured out his anointing who believes it Amen we know we know you know you just go look at history they attribute there's a there's something called the post-world War two a healing revival it changed the world change the world who initiated it they say brother Bram did even those who are just historians those don't even believe the message they say his ministry did it it sparked all Roberts it's back Tommy Osbourne sparked many ministries that have changed the world but it was his ministry that did it what happened he was a prophet he is pouring out an anointing hallelujah but this anointing this anointing they poured out of the horn is different to the to the anointing that he poured out on Saul cuz Samuel took a vial of oil and ported on Saul while speaks of a judgement you know the book of Revelation is the vials are poured out it's God's wrath God's judgment poured out right so we haven't a we haven't received an anointing like salted we're its judgment being poured out this is not that no no this is to establish a kingship this is to establish a kingdom hallelujah this is to establish a victory hallelujah amen so now so now here comes as I said brother brown he poured out the anointing on this age and you see everything from that time till now has manifested in its fullness I mean you see people they come under the and and it's what's in you comes out I mean you see people they come in under the word and what's been buried in them comes to life hallelujah and it's not always weak amen but then it's not always you know because in us and this is a carnal nature you see Peter you know you see him he came under the anointing in his age tried to kill the you know high priests servant you know you know the sword do that and the garden you know he did all different kinds of things cuz in him was a pride it had to come out he was still he was still seed God knows how to cultivate hallelujah he knows he doesn't just want dormant seeds and you know in people he wants them to come out so he can grab them out hallelujah so so Peter needed a grubbing hallelujah but it was all for as good Amen but you see people come under the anointing and and things just start growing out of their lives didn't even know was there hallelujah but even all within that I believe I'm looking at God's wheat hallelujah amen that has come to life brother Brahim says in the from from reading revelations 5 there when he's speaking of the horns on thee when we read how the lamb stepped forth with seven horns and seven eyes he speaks about that was in the breeches the seven horns was the seven churches see the seven church ages because there was the Lambs protection what he take that his rights worth on the earth was a god-sent group of people that protected see the Horn of the Lamb so now the devil has claims to this world it belongs to me he says because I made it fall of now God right of this world but if as long as God has a witness upon the earth is a dispute and that's why down to why did he kill Abel because now if he can kill Abel now no one can claim it's mine right God has no one on the earth that's why he tried to kill Moses you know that's why he tried to stop the deliverer coming isn't it amazing this is the devil's scheme he builds a civilization he tries to wipe out the one who's ordained to to tear it down and deliver God's people and the very one that's going to do the job he actually protects in the palace hallelujah Moses Moses was the ordained one smoke you're his mother said you know you're going to do it you're going to fulfill the prophecy and he said you know the devil gets a word he tries to kill all the male children and then the very one that's going to do the job comes into his palace comes into Pharaoh's Palace hallelujah and and he's nurtured from Pharaoh's table he's he's protected and Pharaoh's Palace right and it's the very one that's gonna tear his kingdom down it's actually the living right in the throne room you could say hallelujah Amen yo the devil made the civilization here we are in the civilization hallelujah amen but we're ordained actually that the civilization will come to an end why has it come to an end the bride takes a rapture amen is a wedding supper than in this millennium hallelujah and then all the devil's devices are done away with amen we're here to end time if I can put it that way because once the brightest translated then we have three and a half years and we have a thousand years of millennium and then there's a season with the devils loose but times coming to an end you know how you feel I'm running out of time because time is running out I mean so they are these seven horns represent Christ and his bride the seven church ages and they are protecting they are what he protects his rights with on the earth so now here we have down through the ages God has always had a witness hallelujah because as long they are there the devil can't say it's mine because there's actually others on the earth actually saying no it's mine God take no no my children on the earth the earth belongs to them why did he make this earth Adam and Eve it's yours subdue it do what you want your gods over this earth he made this earth for his children he didn't make the earth for the devil righteous it's just like this this earth he didn't make it for the devil he didn't make our minds for the devil right here and make it for his mind battles and stress and problems and you know things that upset us this isn't made for the devil it's made for God hallelujah this is actually we are a temple of the Holy Ghost we know a temple of Satan oh yes but the devils is not there gonna be my house then God's is no no not in my house there my place of my rest they don't belong to you hallelujah but we need to recognize that as I said when the Holy Ghost came down in the upper room was it they received an abstract title deed no have you received that abstract have you received it tarik if you if you really met him God is saying that I've I've wiped away what you've done and what you will do sure you have to confess your sins but he but when when he saves you you're not under probation are you gonna you know if you're good enough in you know maybe you'll make it now you're sealed in you seal them howl ooh you doesn't that make you happy you say but I don't know about that bull are you fully believing and trusting in the blood because if you're worried about or how you're gonna do you're putting yourself into your own salvation and God will not let any man glorify himself Helly that's why we say oh we've got to do to him we get all all of us he actually allows you to fall because you've got to come to a place where it's like lord I can't do this at my own strength and he doesn't want you to do it in your own strength he wants him to do it amen now where are we okay I'll just I'll just wrap this up but brother I'm seasoned gods provide a place of worship he says and we're in Christ Jesus by spiritual baptism not by water by spirit baptized into one body which is Christ the worshiping place then being in there we are on this ground like it's like the abstract deed you say I bought a piece of ground it isn't yours until you got an abstract but if you've got an abstract that shows that everything was ever against that piece of ground has been struck enough and when you become a Christian and accept Christ as your Savior then when God sends down the abstract that shows no matter what your father did your mother did or anyone else did your mother daddy might have been drunkards prostitutes whatever it was every sin is stricken off you've got an abstract title there is nothing can put you off it and look everything that's on the grounds belongs to you amen and when you're in Christ Jesus by the bettors baptism of the Holy Ghost every gift of God belongs in the church amen it's an abstract title deed you it's yours it belongs your quickens your mortal bodies oh my if we think of it let's take well um look at those faithful ones at Pentecost they were all in the upper room there they all was scared they had the title alright but they was afraid and all at once they came a sound from heaven the abstract sent down to them like a rushing mighty wind filled all the house where they were sitting and they were so quickened by that till all the cowardness one of them was afraid that even the night he wasn't a Pharisee you know even a said you see ever win that Holy Spirit fell and baptized them into Jesus Christ he became flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of his word he was a new creation he was a new person at quicken his body look what it did what is it what does it do when it comes in it won't make you go out and say I'm Methodist I'm Baptist oh I know I oughtn't to smoke in order to do this or to wear these kind of clothes I want to do this or to do that it's so quick and you till you have to do it it quickens your mortal bodies so when you've really received the abstract the Holy Ghost it will bring this into subjection I mean to the things you once loved you cannot do because you don't ever desire anymore and it's not you training yourself just like as I said before I could live in a brewery and I'd be the most sober man in all the world because there's no desire in here way from alcohol I don't have to struggle every day thou shalt not drink I mean it's written God writes it in your heart however he reprograms you aim in this that is therefore now I don't I just don't want it hallelujah it's not me trying to keep myself from what I once did no it's taken out of me I mean just like computer games you'll move your rock-and-roll music whatever it was I don't have to keep away from those things I don't have to live in just like a monastery somewhere there's nothing in me that wants it no more and it's not me that changed my desire he changed my desire he changed me to love his word what happened the abstract came down and quickened me to his word hallelujah and that's what this message does I make quickens us that the word lives out of us we don't have to try and be Christians he's the Christian in us if you just let him come and he will be the Christian in you I'm glad that's the case isn't it I mean God said I'll walk on them I'll be their God they'll be my people hallelujah walk with me Lord Jesus walk at me amen so I mean so so quickens you too you have to do it a quickened your mortal bodies amen now notice how lujah so now here we are now as I said the devil he said I've got claims on them because of false doctrine and that's why God sent God sent a prophet in this day because they had to be a title search I meant just like a piece of ground you say now does anyone else have claims on this what are the boundaries yet all those things we've got to be defined before it can be sold rights as someone who's qualified has to do a title search they're going to search is there any other disputes any other problems on this piece of ground and once they have all been struck enough then it can be sold right so now God sends God sends the Prophet on this day and he does a title search he starts from water baptism why cuz what happened God said baptize in the name of Jesus Christ take on my name just like a woman takes on the husband's name take on my name be buried with me in Baptism you'll come for the newness of life hallelujah but in the Kable oh don't do that just say didn't say the words name a father son Holy Ghost Oh them but God didn't say say those words when you baptized baptized in my name hallelujah so he changed the baptism there's baptizing a babies and not adults no more sprinkling of water or whatever what's happening that is now the devil's inside now they've received what I have given them so now I I can accuse them and then they and then the devil came in took took God from the Old Testament saying behold thy Lord as one is now you're three three three substances three three persons and then another devil says now they believe my Godhead and all the way down through and now they believe it but and and then he changed the communion now they believe that the bread and the wine literally become the body of Christ and down on down on down but that's why now we've come to an age where God said I shall restore but he seemed to vindicate a prophet to do a title search struck off the Godhead showed us who God was showed us how to be baptized showed us how to love struck up all the liens that the devil had against the church they were struck off and this last day hallelujah so now the devil has no claims whatsoever amen here with me I mean the blood of Jesus Christ has cleanse us from all sin his word has been restored that we don't believe in lying be damned by it hallelujah amen and that's why it's so glorious in this day because now there's nothing holding us that we can't take a rapture there's nothing holding us when God calls we have to go there's nothing there's no chain of unbelief or doubt or false doctor anything that's I can't hold the bride down hallelujah there's no habit there's no sin there's nothing that will hold her down hey God wants you all to himself he doesn't want to share you with nothing amen we have a clear title I mean when Jesus said the devil there's no part of me and I have no part in him you can say the same thing the devil has no part of me I have no part in him I have not associated with him in any war I've got no relationship with him anymore that's all severed that's all been struck off and there's no claims you say but I did this and I did this and I thought this did the blood take care of it stop trying to inject yourself until you taking a rapture he will take you in the rapture right hallelujah he saved you salvation is not your your ability least yeah it is a it is the grace of God a gift of God least any man should boast hallelujah it's not us both you know oh you both know we don't boast in ourselves we boast in him hallelujah he called me has he called you has he justified you he just has he sanctified you has he filled you with His Holy Spirit is he walking on you are you maturing in his word becoming more like him hallelujah if he said all that he's going to wrap you hallelujah he's going to change these bodies amen if he if he turned your soul from doubt - - to faith he can change these these mortal quicken them change these mortal bodies holy we've got a clear title but I have this guilt let him take the guilt he took let's go to Isaiah 53 let's just read this because I love it you know God doesn't leave loopholes hallelujah he covers everything let's go to Isaiah 53 and three let's just read this he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief if you're acquainted with it you you have a relationship with it so he knew always like to be acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows when you carry something you understand what it's like yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities you mean even the things we know not to do we do it anyway iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed we're all like sheep have gone astray all of us we have turned everyone to his own way and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he has brought as a lamb to the slaughter as a sheep before his Shearer's is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who probably shall declare his generation for he was cut off of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him and he has put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand so that covers everything transgressions and it could ease and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes were healed that covers everything so why do we why do we carry regret and and guilt why do we do it if he's taking care of it give it to him walk on he said well I fail them every day but that's why he died for us that we could serve Him amen he's not angry at us because we're human right God looks at the heart what we want to be amen Oh God looks at the heart many people use it as an excuse I mean cuz it because of God yet God does look at the Hat what do you want to be because what you want to be is what you will become right just say I want to be an astronaut if that's really the desire of my heart oh and if I have the ability I will become an astronaut right he said I want to serve the Lord I want to serve him with everything I have you will become that as you yield to him you will become it olia why do we carry such things if God's taking care of it we have a clear title Allu yeah but you've got to put your life in his hands even you know it's wonderful when you first get saved hallelujah right but when you start walking with him for some reason we get because we so want to sincerely serve Him we don't want to displease him we don't know we don't want to hurt him in any way but yet we we overcome but yet we fail sometimes and we carried it I failed the test y'all but get up it's got him the Falls at home that gets back up it's not him that falls and wallows in the mud of the world does him that gets up Lord wash me try me once more hallelujah don't carry guilt don't carry shame he took your shame he knew where you would be he knew where you would go amen he knew Peter would deny him three times he told him you'll go I'll date with you where's the sword but you'll deny me amen did that change the Lord's attitude towards Peter he still said you're gonna have the keys you're gonna be the spokesman on the day of Pentecost it didn't change that hallelujah and if he's declared you're my bride you're my beloved hallelujah my desires towards you hallelujah I'm gonna see you around a wedding supper time you know God what what's going to trigger the you know you're the dead in Christ raising the Lord can't stand it anymore being separated from you and I I can't I he just looked down you know he said I can't I can't put up with us no more I've got to take her home hallelujah you look at the scripture why sisters he's found found Grace and favor in the side of the King you see so many ones they find favor or grace on the side of you know the king of whoever why is that because God is saying that's how you were he just happened to fall under his eyes this is all they find favor and say I love this woman I love these people amen we just got a brother versus when you receive the token it makes you so relaxed now that relax doesn't mean you just let the will go by and don't do nothing but that relaxes now all my striving has come to an end because I'm sealed in I'm in the City of Refuge the hounds of hell were chasing me and I ran holy and I made it in the gates and now I'm safe hallelujah so now if it makes us feel so relaxed why do we get so worried the devil wants us to be all you know stressed and tore up about things we said no no the blood and sorted it out God said I'm going to take care of her I'm gonna wipe out all disputes I'm gonna wipe out all questions I'm going to take care of it all and it's been taken care of I am so glad we don't live in the Old Testament looking for a perfect woman to come amen I'm so glad what I was saying one day the Messiah will come one day he'll come I'm so glad we can say he's come he took care of my sin my guilt my shame my iniquity everything and now he's coming back for me and you glad it's that way they stand to our feet shall we have the musicians lujah our God is great what makes him so great is he can forget if he can forget can't we you say well I I fail them every day sure but don't let it get you down I
