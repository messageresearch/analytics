[12:51] Lord the enemy is end is coming soon and

[13:07] years and he's not happy and Lord he's

[13:11] this end time but father Lord we know
[13:14] that when the enemy pulled out all the
[13:16] stops
[13:16] but how God came down and pulled out all
[13:19] those stops
[13:20] hallelujah Oh God a Living God without

[14:23] in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen
[14:28] god bless you
[14:30] welcome to the house of the Lord it's so
[14:34] good to be here amen anyone with income
[14:36] song leading image but you're welcome a
[14:41] man who feels welcome does everyone feel
[14:43] welcome tonight amen hallelujah you know
[14:46] you know brother Branham in those prayer
[14:48] lines he he would know there was a
[14:50] welcomed spirit when a true believer
[14:52] came before him and he said your spirits
[14:54] welcomed and I believe tonight if you
[14:57] feel welcome it means there's something
[14:59] anew that's resonating with the Holy
[15:01] Ghost and if you don't feel welcomed or
[15:03] something's grating just snicker
[15:05] something wrong something good will
[15:07] happen to you hey man hallelujah amen
[15:11] god bless you thank you brother bin for
[15:13] the opportunity to minister and you know
[15:15] you get a burden on your heart amen and
[15:18] the Lord knows and he tells the pastor
[15:19] amen
[15:21] thank you musicians who loves the
[15:24] musicians they men came in praise the
[15:26] Lord
[15:28] we appreciate you guys amen hallelujah
[15:33] creating an atmosphere hallelujah while
[15:37] we're standing can we turn in our Bibles
[15:40] now just to John chapter fourteen
[15:44] hallelujah and I want to speak on
[15:47] smitten by my first love and we all know
[15:51] that our first love as Jesus Christ amen
[15:54] and he's coming this day to smite us
[15:59] with love amen and so you know you you
[16:03] want to be you want to be you want you
[16:06] want that love to strike you deeply in
[16:10] your life so that it's not just and you
[16:13] know knowledge I mean we can have a
[16:15] knowledge of his love and we should and
[16:17] it's good to have a knowledge but it has
[16:19] to go deeper than a knowledge and even
[16:22] experience you can have an experience
[16:24] but if that experience doesn't remain
[16:27] and continue then it's just a past thing
[16:31] but to be smitten as to be consumed by
[16:36] his love amen and so that's the context
[16:38] of the title and we're in part two it
[16:43] says here in John 14 verses 18 to 21
[16:46] yeah man can you please turn that heat
[16:50] down a little bit I'm gonna cook
[16:52] actually take this off now she's here in
[16:57] John 14 18 I will not leave you
[17:02] comfortless I as a personal pronoun I
[17:05] will come to you he says this is Jesus
[17:08] speaking to his disciples while he was
[17:10] here in corporal form and he says here
[17:13] yet a little while and the world seeth
[17:16] me no more but you shall see me because
[17:20] I love ye shall live also
[17:23] amen you know he was we've sung was
[17:26] trampled on the ground but he lives he
[17:29] rose again a man that wasn't the end of
[17:31] the story
[17:32] I'm so glad who's glad that that's not
[17:34] the end of the story
[17:35] hey man ate that day you shall know that
[17:40] I am in my father and your and me it
[17:45] makes you an eternal being and his mind
[17:48] and his thinking somewhere in that
[17:50] eternal mind of God you were there we
[17:53] were there at that day you shall know
[17:55] that you shall know that I'm and my
[17:58] father you and me
[18:01] I knew and it could say because I'm in
[18:05] you and in here he that hath my
[18:11] Commandments and this is where I want to
[18:12] focus now into our for this particular
[18:15] subject he that hath my Commandments and
[18:20] keepeth them he it is that loveth me and
[18:25] he that loveth me shall be loved of my
[18:28] father and I will love him and will
[18:30] manifest myself to him may God bless his
[18:33] word you may be seated now that is the
[18:37] burden of my heart for this and actually
[18:41] was we never got to it in part one
[18:43] really but as the scripture here because
[18:49] for all my life ever since I was first
[18:52] Saved should I say when I say life I
[18:54] mean my life after getting saved because
[18:57] that's when life only began life never
[18:59] really began until then really truly
[19:02] because you had to find other things to
[19:03] make you happy and all the stuff you
[19:05] would never satisfy but then God then he
[19:08] came he changed everything
[19:09] hey man who can who can testify that
[19:12] life began when you met the Lord Amen
[19:14] you may sit in church all your life but
[19:17] life will begin when you meet him Amen
[19:20] really true life and I can speak to all
[19:23] of you little young children tonight all
[19:27] the young children so life begins when
[19:30] you meet him and church stops becoming
[19:32] something you have to enjoy you don't
[19:34] want it to end after that Amen I don't
[19:37] want it to end amen my stomach starts
[19:39] getting hungry I don't care I just want
[19:41] to enjoy rejoice in the lord because i'm
[19:43] enjoying hearing what he has to tell me
[19:46] and his spirit we're communing as a
[19:49] communion with the real joy giver you
[19:51] know we sing this song you alone are the
[19:53] real joy giver the ethel of my eye you
[19:57] know this is real close stuff here this
[19:59] is relationship this is this is a
[20:02] relationship that you feel and i want to
[20:05] get to that because god wants us to feel
[20:08] he wants feeling to be involved in our
[20:11] relationship with him and with each
[20:13] other
[20:15] and yet we're in a world this world is
[20:17] designed to break that I mean ultimately
[20:21] wants to break the relationship between
[20:23] the bride and Christ by distractions and
[20:26] all these other things but you know he
[20:28] he takes pride this is the devil now he
[20:30] takes pride and and breaking down human
[20:32] relationships natural human love he
[20:36] takes pride and breaking that down
[20:37] that's what society has done that's why
[20:40] friendships now are through a screen how
[20:43] easy it is for you to really speak your
[20:45] mind through a screen through a text or
[20:48] through some media you know or even not
[20:51] even directly to someone but just to
[20:53] everybody you can just speak your mind
[20:55] you can say whatever but then you go in
[20:57] person and you and you meet the people
[20:59] and you can't actually communicate and
[21:02] the reason is is because of the ease of
[21:05] this whole media world and it's designed
[21:08] to break the connection between human
[21:11] beings right and we don't want that
[21:14] because connection is everything you
[21:17] know when it comes to relationship
[21:19] you've got to be connected and there's
[21:20] many reasons why it's hard for people to
[21:22] connect many reasons complexes hurts
[21:25] whatever that happens in their life that
[21:29] make some oneness kid you know something
[21:32] maybe you know like a child that loses
[21:33] their parents young you know from that
[21:36] time you know they're scared to connect
[21:38] with something they don't want to go
[21:39] through that pain again they don't want
[21:41] to go through the pain of being so
[21:43] connected with somebody in and they
[21:45] don't want to save as a fear of
[21:47] separation as the fears and anxiety it
[21:50] can cause all types of trouble and
[21:52] therefore they struggle to love now
[21:55] that's a very severe example there's
[21:57] many examples this that comes in many
[21:59] levels it can be a mild thing but still
[22:01] the mild things as the ones that really
[22:03] when we start to really get serious with
[22:06] God and he starts to deal in our life
[22:08] and we want to really be connected to
[22:10] him and we want to see the supernatural
[22:13] right we want to see the supernatural in
[22:16] our life we want to see we want it we
[22:18] want him as he says here to manifest
[22:21] himself to us I mean there is your
[22:24] inheritance and if he's not it doesn't
[22:27] mean you're not a believer
[22:28] you're doing something wrong they just
[22:30] maybe a little thing in your life that
[22:33] is just the bridge a little bridge
[22:34] something that's why when we're at
[22:37] church judgment begins at the house of
[22:39] God and you sit here not with the guard
[22:41] up and like oh man I'm just gonna I hope
[22:44] he better not preach against me you know
[22:45] that there when you do that if you get
[22:48] that my scene you get like it maybe a
[22:50] bit angry or a bit resentful about
[22:52] what's coming well actually you're just
[22:54] gonna miss your blessing you'll miss
[22:56] your opportunity because no preacher
[22:59] well I can't stand for everybody but at
[23:02] least me in and I know brother Ben would
[23:03] sure no one here would preach I'm gonna
[23:06] just I'm gonna hit the head I'm gonna
[23:08] get that I know all the stuff not it's
[23:10] not like that you just got to do what
[23:12] the Lord wants you to say right and the
[23:14] Lord is working so powerfully now you
[23:17] know like it's just really the the Word
[23:19] of God is just so strong it's so
[23:21] accurate and and he's getting down to
[23:24] the weightier matters of our life and
[23:26] he's coming down into our homes he's
[23:28] coming down into our families he's
[23:29] coming down into our bedrooms he's
[23:31] coming down everywhere into our life to
[23:34] to to to bring everything back to the
[23:36] way it should be the way it was before
[23:38] Satan corrupted the human race and he is
[23:42] doing that by his love he is doing that
[23:44] by his grace now remember when divine
[23:47] love is projected when you start to
[23:49] radiate divine love when divine love
[23:51] starts to come out and starts to
[23:53] manifest in your life you what happens
[23:57] is your flesh starts to really have love
[23:59] in it because now you're expressing the
[24:01] love it's now coming all of a sudden the
[24:03] atmosphere is changing the church
[24:05] changes and lives people feel like God
[24:08] you know what I can actually I might go
[24:10] to the pastor now he's not gonna laugh
[24:12] I'm he's not going to just ridicule me
[24:13] he's gonna help me people want to help
[24:15] each other because that's love and and
[24:17] so a prophet would come and say when
[24:20] divine love is projected Sovereign Grace
[24:22] can take its place amen
[24:24] now ultimate the ultimate revelation of
[24:27] that of divine love being projected was
[24:29] the father came and stepped into a human
[24:32] body and what the earth is a savior that
[24:34] was divine love manifested in the flesh
[24:38] this was the greatest personification of
[24:40] love was
[24:42] when God became a man and suffered like
[24:44] nobody else could suffer and take the
[24:47] penalty of sin so that we could be free
[24:49] and so divine love was projected and
[24:52] Sovereign Grace took its place in the
[24:55] form of God and flesh that's and and so
[25:00] and then then he said right here I go
[25:03] but I will send you a comforter I'll
[25:05] come to you amen and he's in love with
[25:08] me so here you see where I'm going
[25:10] there's a connection now he that loveth
[25:13] me will keep us my Commandments not he
[25:18] that thinks it's a good idea and I
[25:20] should do it because I have to and it's
[25:22] enforced upon me by leadership that's
[25:24] not it that doesn't work the human
[25:27] nature never gets changed in their
[25:28] sovereign grace can't work in there it's
[25:31] not the right atmosphere but there's an
[25:33] atmosphere that can change there's an
[25:35] atmosphere that can change people that
[25:37] can raise people up and work on them and
[25:39] that's love and so here we are in this
[25:42] end time to connect with God and so I
[25:45] encourage you work on your relationship
[25:47] with them work on it it takes work
[25:50] that's not works but it takes work do
[25:52] you know what I mean now you are the
[25:53] branch and here's the vine and has
[25:55] spirit is like the SAP and it's
[25:57] energizing you you just got the branch
[25:59] and you you just do what the vine the
[26:01] set comes up and you just say I'm
[26:03] fruitful amen
[26:04] hallelujah that's what you need to do
[26:06] just be fruitful then I have to produce
[26:08] it you the law will make you try and
[26:10] produce it there will be a pressure on
[26:12] you to push you into an image to push
[26:14] you into something but that that's not
[26:16] the kingdom principle kingdom principle
[26:19] is the step comes out love comes unto
[26:22] you and you work on your relationship
[26:24] with him and you identify things come
[26:27] over the pulpit things come through
[26:28] sermons or whatever when you're praying
[26:30] and God speaks into your dreams whatever
[26:32] it visions however he wants to show you
[26:35] and he starts to help you he gives you a
[26:37] key little points something that you
[26:40] need to do too so that that's that maybe
[26:43] it's a behavior or an attribute or a
[26:45] family trait or something that's
[26:47] hindering and we're talking like minut
[26:49] little things but the Lord is particular
[26:51] you know his grace see His grace looks
[26:54] beyond
[26:55] and it's not that mean you're not saved
[26:56] it doesn't mean that you're out of us
[26:58] out of his favor but it's just we're
[27:01] just getting the land you know we're
[27:03] getting a little bit more every day
[27:04] amen we're growing into his image and so
[27:07] because of that you know he'll put his
[27:09] finger on something and you say yes yes
[27:11] or I don't want that in my life amen
[27:14] I need because you see now through this
[27:17] connection as you work on your
[27:19] relationship with him and love now love
[27:23] real true love should not stay just in
[27:27] your heart you know what I mean now I'm
[27:30] going oh I know it sounds a bit
[27:32] different but it's actually true true
[27:35] love should not remain enclosed and
[27:39] sealed in it needs to be expressed amen
[27:43] this is like a way of explaining it if
[27:47] someone says to me how do I bring Jesus
[27:50] on the scene you know I will tell them
[27:53] fall in love with them love them so much
[27:57] just fall in love with them because
[27:59] because the love yes they word of I hid
[28:02] in my heart and my love it's in my heart
[28:04] but you see it's got to break out
[28:06] there's more I mean it's not gonna run
[28:10] out you know he he broke the seals he
[28:14] opened the book you are also a book a
[28:17] living written epistle and and and in
[28:20] the breaking of the seals that released
[28:22] him but it didn't just release him it
[28:24] released you and so there is grace today
[28:27] to release you so that divine love can
[28:31] be projected and then Sovereign Grace
[28:33] takes its place but now you are his
[28:36] representative you are the branches
[28:39] you're the place where his fruit is born
[28:42] you're the place where his fruit cancel
[28:45] can go Wow
[28:45] I like that there's something about that
[28:48] person there's a sweetness there there's
[28:51] a purpose for further
[28:52] it's the carry seed it's to bring forth
[28:55] life and when there's fruit in your life
[28:58] when you're so in love of the Lord amen
[29:02] it makes you act a little bit different
[29:04] it makes you change things now it
[29:06] becomes a motive
[29:08] and it's the key motive of the economy
[29:11] of God is love he don't need no money in
[29:14] heaven actually actually the money that
[29:17] the pinnacle of money on this earth was
[29:19] going to be our pavement hey man we're
[29:21] gonna walk on it
[29:22] streets of gold amen worthless up there
[29:25] but that's the devil's that's his
[29:28] economy and that's what man strives for
[29:30] this metal that's our pavement now God
[29:33] was telling us something there at the
[29:35] pinnacle of what the devil now God says
[29:38] I'm going to make that pavement you
[29:39] watch and my people are going to
[29:40] overcome the devil overcome all of us
[29:43] evil and they're gonna love each other
[29:44] even at a time where there is no love
[29:46] left in the world there's going to be a
[29:48] people that are in perfect love
[29:50] manifesting the grace of God and
[29:53] becoming God's grace and flesh this is
[29:56] what it is with your yielded to the
[29:59] spirit and you're a branch that has
[30:01] grafted on the vine you are His grace
[30:03] and flesh because he will use you let
[30:06] your speech be alway with grace seasoned
[30:09] with salt knowing how you ought to
[30:11] answer every man but take no thought
[30:13] what you shall say don't concoct up a
[30:16] big thing in a big essay and some big
[30:18] intellectual thing it doesn't work but
[30:20] the father's be desire that you may be
[30:25] inspired by the Spirit of God because
[30:28] that is what he wants don't think nets
[30:31] just for the ministry don't think that's
[30:33] just for some preacher or some prophet
[30:35] or something there no every life can
[30:37] have a portion of his inspiration have a
[30:40] portion of his power have a portion of
[30:42] his grace have an anointing there is an
[30:45] anointing of God that is for you
[30:48] according to your calling according to
[30:50] your gifting as this Watersafe brother
[30:53] sweet something heavens to Stokes value
[30:58] water when you leave it in the glass it
[31:01] turns into like cyanide or something I
[31:07] don't know why it must be a chemical
[31:09] reaction amen
[31:13] and so to consolidate all of us
[31:20] the more we love him the more he comes
[31:22] on the scene in our life and our family
[31:25] it sounds too easy and too simple to be
[31:28] true but it's actually but that's
[31:30] basically the whole that's what you're
[31:33] asked it's the main thing that's your
[31:34] ask just fall in love with them the
[31:36] Bible says and brother and posted it
[31:38] last week he says use the scripture thou
[31:42] shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
[31:44] heart all thy mind and all thy strength
[31:47] all thy soul spirit and body so that
[31:51] every part of your life will be per
[31:54] Grady it permeated love them with all of
[31:57] it amen when you lift your hands up in
[32:00] the service responding to the presence
[32:03] of God you're loving them with your
[32:04] strength amen when you say amen and
[32:07] you're agreeing and you begin to behave
[32:08] differently you're loving them with your
[32:10] spurred and when you're in your soul as
[32:12] a born-again soul is just by default in
[32:15] love with Jesus amen amen
[32:17] you just you love them and many times we
[32:20] love them and we don't know it yet
[32:21] because it's so buried down and there's
[32:23] so many two miles and troubled when
[32:25] Israel came into the land they didn't
[32:28] have the land straightaway but it was
[32:30] this when you got born again you didn't
[32:33] have all your inheritance but it was
[32:34] yours and it was in you he came in and
[32:37] he started the work but then little by
[32:39] little little by little little by little
[32:41] you began to get all of that inheritance
[32:43] as you don't look that way or that way
[32:46] and don't get distracted by the politics
[32:48] all that sort of stuff but stay with the
[32:50] Lord
[32:50] stay with him he's the one that knows
[32:53] hey man he's got a whole system set in
[32:55] place he's got a whole economy and as we
[32:58] love as that love starts to come out as
[33:01] we love them with all of our heart all
[33:02] of our mind all about strength every
[33:04] area of our life begins to love them it
[33:06] begins to radiate what does what happen
[33:09] you book it becomes easy to do his walk
[33:11] we'll it becomes easy you you don't want
[33:14] to hurt him you begin to have a close
[33:16] relationship with them you begin to feel
[33:18] his presence more you begin to enter
[33:20] into intimacy greater than you've ever
[33:23] had it becomes more than just a robotic
[33:26] form we we've got to keep the message of
[33:29] the hour you know we're going to we're
[33:30] going to be this certain way the
[33:32] prophets did this and we're going to be
[33:33] like
[33:34] but you see it's gotta go higher than
[33:36] that it's got to be deeper than that and
[33:38] it can be and it's not hard as long as
[33:41] you fall in love with him John season 1
[33:44] John 5 he says his Commandments to those
[33:48] true believers the sons of God it's not
[33:50] Grievous it's not a hard thing but you
[33:54] see you can be a son of God born again
[33:57] but if you're but if you get over
[33:59] encumbered and you start to get
[34:01] distracted and you start to veer on
[34:03] different things than you spread your
[34:05] affections you now your spirit now that
[34:08] you meet to love them with all of it
[34:09] remember all of it all can anyone say
[34:13] all in here all your spirit love them
[34:17] with all of it he wants all your
[34:19] affections now I know that's not easy
[34:21] because you know as a man and as sisters
[34:23] you you start to enjoy doing nothing
[34:26] maybe you enjoy making cakes or and you
[34:28] you can get really you can get really
[34:30] carried away with that you know and I in
[34:32] a man you can enjoy your you know you
[34:35] might have a hobby car or something and
[34:37] you can really start to put your
[34:39] affections just go they gravitate now
[34:44] all I'm asking is just monitor then
[34:46] monitor it because you what you'll find
[34:49] its before long it won't just be the car
[34:52] it'll be this project it'll be that
[34:54] project it'll be your job maybe you want
[34:56] to get a promotion you start to put your
[34:57] heart more into that and all of a sudden
[34:59] your whole spirit is now divided out and
[35:02] it's divided over all these things which
[35:04] aren't necessarily bad things but they
[35:06] as a man or as a woman they take the
[35:10] place of God collectively now one thing
[35:14] maybe okay or two or three maybe all
[35:17] right but win it but what happens is it
[35:19] just goes like this and it just
[35:20] snowballs until your life is full and
[35:23] your affections of sprit twosome and
[35:26] then it then that love know that the
[35:29] love I'm talking a feel the true deep
[35:33] rich personal love the contact the
[35:36] connection with God the the the thing
[35:39] that makes it easy for you to live a
[35:41] holy life that makes it easy for you to
[35:44] walk with God you
[35:46] an opportunity amen hallelujah and the
[35:50] opportunity is fall in love with him
[35:54] amen
[35:55] you know the ecosystem and economy of
[35:59] God personified anew we read in Song of
[36:03] Solomon 2 verse 8 to 15 it says the
[36:06] voice of my beloved behold he come
[36:08] leaping upon the mountains skipping over
[36:11] the hills my beloved is like a row a
[36:14] young heart behold he standeth behind
[36:17] our wall and he looketh forth at the
[36:19] windows showing himself through the
[36:22] letters see this is a love affair this
[36:25] is a love relationship this is this is
[36:28] how the Lord works he begins to reveal
[36:29] himself to you and he and well what he's
[36:32] looking for is he's looking for he's
[36:34] looking to woo he's looking to bring
[36:36] he's looking to stir your emotions it
[36:39] sees it he's looking now this sounds bad
[36:42] but this is King James language he's
[36:44] looking to move your bowels it sounds
[36:46] really bad but this is the old English
[36:48] language it actually means to to you
[36:51] just feel like you're almost going to be
[36:53] sickly you're so infatuated ly in love
[36:57] now I know that we preached about going
[36:59] beyond a crush and this is beyond a
[37:00] crush but you see there is a higher love
[37:03] but then it's got to drop down it's
[37:05] going to be everywhere it's got to be
[37:07] more than just an idea or a glorious
[37:12] thing that you rejoice about
[37:13] you can rejoice about the love of God
[37:15] you can rejoice about the word but are
[37:18] you experiencing it is it as it let has
[37:21] it landed has it landed down home is it
[37:24] down in the house is God in the house
[37:27] you know it's really really manifesting
[37:30] in your life where where you've got
[37:32] victory amen hallelujah okay I just
[37:36] oki on reap so it says here see he's
[37:41] wooing you he's drawing you he shows
[37:43] himself through the lettuce be my
[37:45] beloved spake and he said and said unto
[37:47] me rise up My Love My Fair one and come
[37:50] away you see sometimes we find ourselves
[37:54] behind the wall behind a wall some wall
[37:57] that's distracting her some wall that
[37:59] keeping us from from really coming into
[38:02] a connection with him and he shows
[38:04] himself through he say Here I am
[38:05] come away just just just put down all
[38:09] those things listen to what your prophet
[38:11] told you lay aside everything until you
[38:14] get perfect love because without it or
[38:17] your works or your faith all of your
[38:19] things anything you could do for the
[38:21] Lord isn't it doesn't mean anything it's
[38:22] got you it means nothing that divine
[38:27] love with charity charity this is the
[38:31] the core of your connection to God this
[38:33] is the core where it would cause a
[38:36] church to succeed as divine love and
[38:39] this is why things work because of love
[38:43] love conquers all amen love is greater
[38:47] than all other I don't know what you
[38:49] would call them but things God is love
[38:52] and then so love is the greatest thing
[38:55] and when and in its and it's an
[38:58] opportunity now as you hear what I'm
[39:00] telling you because these things are
[39:02] very good not because it's me because
[39:04] it's the word but you can fall in love
[39:06] with him amen
[39:08] it can go beyond a duty of a believer I
[39:11] can go beyond a great rejoicing about
[39:13] Revelation and seeing a tall piece
[39:14] together which I love and it's glorious
[39:17] and we should love it but there is a
[39:19] love that makes all of that even greater
[39:22] because you see the one that wrote it
[39:24] the one that made it he will manifest
[39:27] himself to you
[39:28] amen you will see the supernatural in
[39:31] your life the gifts that he's placed the
[39:33] callings he will manifest them and your
[39:36] pew you will adore you just will go
[39:39] beyond warming up you you'll go beyond
[39:41] just living a mundane life amen
[39:44] it will become so much greater so much
[39:46] more hallelujah but so don't let the
[39:49] circumstances pull you down don't let
[39:52] all of the things that all the woes and
[39:54] all the thoughts and you get up in the
[39:55] night and all the thoughts come and all
[39:57] those things don't let them pull you
[39:59] down amen
[40:01] you said no Satan get away from me you
[40:04] know warfare now you have to use your
[40:07] authority you have to use what God's
[40:09] given you your a son your daughter you
[40:12] have a jurisdiction
[40:13] you have authority over him he doesn't
[40:15] he has no right to hold on to you he has
[40:17] no right to keep you down he has no
[40:19] right to hold you on the ground you can
[40:22] rise up above it and actually love the
[40:24] Lord even if you suffer with any type of
[40:27] mental things or whatever it may be you
[40:29] can love them more hallelujah amen who
[40:33] wants the Lord to manifest in himself to
[40:35] them you know what that means to reveal
[40:38] openly to declare the the fullness the
[40:42] revelation of him not about him but him
[40:45] himself we're talking about a being a
[40:48] person love himself real true love if
[40:53] you want that you need to love him you
[40:56] know it's like this is this whole thing
[40:57] in that day you shall know that I am in
[41:00] the father and you're and me now love
[41:03] will really bring that into ya you know
[41:07] we want to call Jesus on the scene and
[41:09] prayer and call him down and he and he
[41:11] comes down amen and we enjoy it but what
[41:14] if you were just so in love he's always
[41:16] with down hey man and I believe that
[41:18] sound heritance why don't you claim it
[41:21] why don't you claim it and never let the
[41:23] devil rob you of the hope that you're
[41:26] gonna have that Amen I'm talking about
[41:29] biblical hope now not just lotto hope
[41:31] it's not hope that's just something
[41:34] dangle but I'm but real hope is an
[41:38] expectation with pleasure and
[41:40] anticipation
[41:41] based on a true biblical promise a
[41:43] biblical promise that you can have
[41:45] divine love soul in your life so in your
[41:49] life that it would just radiate amen
[41:53] hallelujah

[42:13] rise up my love my fair one and come
[42:15] away come out from those walls come out
[42:18] from those family things come out from
[42:20] your the culture that would limit you to
[42:23] what you think that you are and come out
[42:26] of it and come with me
[42:27] come and skip on the mountains with me
[42:28] come down and I'll lead you through the
[42:30] valleys and I'll take you through it all
[42:31] amen
[42:32] just fall in love she's here now the fig
[42:35] tree put 1/4 of green figs and the vines
[42:37] with the tender grape give a good smell
[42:39] arise my love my fair one and come away
[42:44] o my dove they're out in the cliffs of
[42:47] the rock in the secret places of the
[42:49] stairs
[42:49] let me see thy countenance let me hear
[42:51] thy voice for sweet as thy voice and thy
[42:53] countenance is comely hallelujah but
[42:57] take us the foxes the little foxes that
[43:00] spoil the vine for our vines have kinder
[43:04] grapes ya see you see as a believer the
[43:08] Lord is always budding there's always
[43:10] something welling up there's always
[43:11] something happening in your life there's
[43:13] always something there's a little bad
[43:14] these little grapes coming but there is
[43:17] foxes you know these foxes want to come
[43:19] and pick them and take them and break
[43:21] your vines down that's what they're
[43:23] trying to do I'm gonna hit that god is
[43:28] hitting it he's hitting it amen
[43:31] you know this is a real basic simple
[43:34] elementary thought but he's hitting that
[43:36] he's really hitting that in your life
[43:38] and and you know we we if you really see
[43:42] what's going on here you our soul
[43:44] especially the teenagers and the young
[43:48] children but all of us there is a battle
[43:51] for our soul our soul is what is the
[43:55] battle for that between God and Satan
[43:57] and and and and there's it's raging
[44:00] because you see Satan's not a gentleman
[44:02] he'll just rip you and he will pull you
[44:04] into what he wants he won't care about
[44:06] being gentle but he has he does have his
[44:09] limitations he can't step up beyond the
[44:11] boundaries of God's spiritual Lords and
[44:13] and what God said in place for you
[44:16] beings otherwise there wouldn't be even
[44:17] anything because he would just destroy
[44:19] everyone so there is boundaries for him
[44:21] but it's not a gentleman and if you let
[44:23] him in if you just give him a little bit
[44:25] he'll destroy but if you give God just a
[44:28] little bit that's all he'll take he will
[44:32] never breach your free moral agency he
[44:34] will never go beyond what you allow
[44:37] people who you and he knows you more
[44:40] than anyone else and he knows what's
[44:42] gonna innos what will bring you in he
[44:44] knows what's going he knows you more
[44:46] than you know yourself he knows the
[44:48] chemicals your body made of he knows all
[44:50] the glands and he knows all of that and
[44:52] he knows how to make that nice he knows
[44:55] how to keep your house this is your
[44:57] house and we find so many people
[44:59] suffering under mental conditions and
[45:01] then they go to the doctor and they take
[45:03] their blood and they see there's a
[45:04] chemical imbalance it's not because
[45:06] they're born that way it's not born
[45:08] that's the breach in this buret there's
[45:10] a emotional bruise that's a scar
[45:12] something deep or multiple and those are
[45:14] the things that the devil uses against
[45:16] people those are the little foxes that
[45:18] will spoil the vine all right but if you
[45:21] walk now this is where because we've got
[45:24] to walk this walk and we're not perfect
[45:26] yet in this flesh right but there's a
[45:27] victory to be won
[45:28] there's a victory tonight there's a
[45:30] victory next week there's a victory
[45:32] every day if you want it amen there's a
[45:35] victory for you you can walk into that
[45:37] victory you can claim that victory but
[45:38] there must be a fight in you there must
[45:41] be some real you're gonna have guts amen
[45:44] you understand don't don't just cower
[45:48] down all you know because that doesn't
[45:50] work don't have a pity party even if you
[45:52] feel like it
[45:53] tell your flesh you can shut up I'm
[45:56] gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna praise God
[45:58] right now carry your sorry flesh to what
[46:02] it should be doing and love the Lord you
[46:05] just say you know what yeah what can I
[46:07] do Lord then I can love you more and
[46:09] I'll tell you something you know even if
[46:12] you don't want to do it because maybe
[46:14] you're in a condition or someone's in a
[46:15] condition in their struggling just
[46:18] absorb the word
[46:24] to move of the word anew that's just the
[46:27] basis to start to build you to give you
[46:31] some strengths so that you can now we
[46:34] know when you start to do that it starts
[46:36] to generate a strength of with a new
[46:38] until now now you can say lord help me
[46:42] love you more
[46:43] what is it and then you come in church
[46:45] and because you've been listening to the
[46:46] word because you there's something
[46:47] you've been feeding the right thing in
[46:49] your life now you become a bit more
[46:51] sensitive and now when the preacher
[46:53] preaches you get affected by it and it
[46:56] actually it does something for you you
[46:58] know you you begin to engage with the
[47:00] Lord you begin to hear a fruit you begin
[47:02] to hear a nugget and it's for you and
[47:04] you hear it and you receive it and you
[47:06] don't miss it because I can tell you
[47:08] even if you don't see it and you missed
[47:11] it if it's like these nuggets for
[47:13] everybody all the time you can every
[47:16] person in this room can leave the
[47:17] service blessed completely changed if
[47:22] you see it if you catch it just be alert
[47:24] you know and I think you know we want to
[47:26] fall in love with the Lord because we
[47:28] won't love to be here in this mental and
[47:31] here we want you know we want God was
[47:33] skinned on
[47:34] we want God around us amen hallelujah I
[47:38] know it sounds real simple but just fall
[47:40] in love with them fall in love with him
[47:43] work on that and for profit we know to
[47:45] be on the other could and the time and
[47:47] comes back and he says lay aside

[50:53] it you will come to a point where you'll
[50:55] have full access to all of it and it
[50:57] won't trouble you anymore you won't say
[50:59] that stupid thing anymore you won't get
[51:01] yourself into trouble by the things you
[51:03] say hello me let's me okay
[51:05] I'm always getting myself in trouble by
[51:08] this and I pray every night lord please
[51:10] when is it time when there's a Time Lord
[51:14] but this thing here and I can really
[51:17] mean who says that James I think me and
[51:20] James up in heaven you know James the
[51:22] the writer of Booker James he says the
[51:24] tongue can no men tame and unruly evil
[51:27] but the Holy Ghost now there is the Holy
[51:30] Ghost the Holy Ghost can come soul into
[51:34] your life hallelujah that will give you
[51:37] such temperance that you will be able to
[51:40] decide you may still get angry something
[51:43] might upset you but you'll have the
[51:44] power of decision the power to decide
[51:47] whether I hurt somebody with my tongue
[51:49] or whether I say no you know what I'm
[51:52] gonna have divine love right now and if
[51:55] you've got love in your life like real
[51:57] love the practicality of this is is
[52:01] working on their Lord how do I love you
[52:04] more as there is this something in my
[52:05] life that would hinder that is there
[52:07] something that I'm doing is there
[52:08] something in my in my spirit that would
[52:11] breech-block it here's the Lord is here
[52:15] to deliver that the Lord is here to heal
[52:17] if there's a breach he says I'll bind up
[52:20] the breach of my people and I'll heal
[52:21] the stroke of their wounds that's what
[52:23] he says this is the promise for our hour
[52:25] I'm gonna heal the stroke heal it wounds
[52:27] and I'm gonna bind up the breach of my
[52:28] people so you don't have to have
[52:30] breaches and we've got breaches right
[52:33] and because we got breaches we have
[52:35] troubles but there's something that's
[52:37] going to subdue that and that's love
[52:41] love will subdue your unruly your unruly
[52:46] spirit until we and because you need
[52:49] something to walk in love because as
[52:54] time goes on is the end draws near the
[52:57] devil's game is getting stronger and
[52:59] stronger and the Lord is getting
[53:02] stronger
[53:02] stronger and the more that we raise up
[53:05] to our position the more the devil gets
[53:07] cast out the more he gets pushed down
[53:09] because he's getting pulled out of his
[53:11] position by the by your rising to your
[53:13] position and we've heard that so as you
[53:16] rise up as you take it as the love of
[53:18] God is so thick in this place until
[53:20] there's nothing he can do because
[53:23] there's just love and no matter what he
[53:25] tries and this is like a this is part of
[53:29] it the faults that get revealed in your
[53:32] life can be healed not judged by each
[53:36] other
[53:36] there's no prickles to go home look at
[53:38] that I've got that one hole we better go
[53:41] and attack that and then they stay the
[53:43] same no this is about growing this is
[53:46] about there is a love atmosphere that
[53:48] can allow change that is sovereign grace
[53:52] taking its place sovereign grace takes
[53:54] its place when divine love is projected
[53:57] and divine love will be projected when
[53:59] you fall in love with him fall in love
[54:02] with him in the name of the Lord I I
[54:04] just encourage you work on it work on it
[54:08] there's something in your this there is
[54:11] something for you to have it's love more
[54:13] of love and so as I said earlier don't
[54:16] hide it in your heart it's not made just
[54:19] to stay there it's actually it's a love
[54:22] the eternal life its living for others
[54:26] and so it's going to come out it's got a
[54:28] break you see you see the seed of your
[54:31] life like the the holy of holies it's
[54:33] like your heart and and it's brought the
[54:36] veil was rent right the that's been
[54:39] broken the seals been broken the tomb is
[54:42] open of your life
[54:43] like Martha here's the resurrection her
[54:47] life and he's standing there and it's
[54:49] roll away the stone Martha you've gotta
[54:51] roll away the stone the stone is
[54:53] standing between your resurrected life
[54:56] in the resurrection himself and that
[54:59] stone is whatever is holding you back
[55:01] that's told us he's standing there is
[55:03] the resurrection he's looking at you
[55:05] through the lattice through the wall he
[55:07] say come out come away roll away the
[55:10] stone and come out come forth come with
[55:14] me walk with me
[55:16] walk with me hello yeah we can find it
[55:20] we can run we can do whatever but we'll
[55:22] never be satisfied until we we come to
[55:25] connect what we're made here what we're
[55:27] made for you're made for it he didn't
[55:30] God is God right now we can go and watch
[55:32] this other stuff and it can distort our
[55:34] image of God it can distort our image of
[55:36] humanity and we start to think our life
[55:39] was about something else but life is all
[55:42] about God God created the world he
[55:45] created the universe and then he created
[55:47] people and there was a people that he
[55:50] would be in fellowship with and He
[55:52] commands to be God that you would let
[55:57] him be God and he made you for that
[56:02] divine purpose and he's placed talents
[56:04] and personality in you to perfectly suit
[56:08] that coin anything else will never
[56:11] satisfy it'll just be a temporal thing
[56:14] and it may wreak havoc there may be
[56:16] confusion but it will never satisfy like
[56:21] being connected you know about the
[56:34] Brenham he sees us in dr. Moses there is
[56:40] a great oh sorry it's my little title to
[56:43] know what I'm talking about I read that
[56:46] and now know the context of the quote so
[56:48] we certainly welcome you eases our
[56:51] beloved friends and love with the Lord
[56:55] Jesus may his spirit stir you tonight
[56:58] and your emotions greatly to love her
[57:02] more and more let's see this is
[57:05] something and I pray and I say Lord I
[57:07] can just I can share but you need to
[57:10] stir the people it's your grace it's
[57:12] your anointing it's your that's it's you
[57:15] Lord to stir the people to stir up
[57:18] because our emotions need to be stirred
[57:21] and I know we don't judge everything by
[57:23] emotions and feelings but they are part
[57:26] of it
[57:26] they are
[57:27] company they're complementary just like
[57:30] a man in his home his wife is
[57:33] complementary and the man doesn't just
[57:35] get rid of his wife because he doesn't
[57:37] want to be led by his wife or live by
[57:39] you know the the feelings of his wife
[57:41] and any but we should we should actually
[57:43] incorporate our wife into a
[57:45] decision-making and we should you know
[57:47] she's part of us she was helping me for
[57:49] us she's part of us and so we should
[57:51] respect that and enjoy it and actually
[57:53] embrace that imbalance right perfect
[57:57] balance and love divine love because
[57:59] divine love redeems your wife to be a
[58:00] reflection of who you are hey man and
[58:04] she's just pushed down like this then
[58:05] then you know like that's not going to
[58:07] work either but she is the emotional
[58:13] part of the you know a lady is more
[58:16] emotional than a man and many respects
[58:18] but not always but generally typically a
[58:21] lady is the more is more the emotional
[58:23] part but you don't push her down and if
[58:25] you push her down that is a legalistic
[58:28] some tyrannical leadership that is based
[58:32] on some cultural limitation it's not
[58:35] it's not godly it's not kingdom of God
[58:38] ways and it's the same thing now in your
[58:41] own life your emotional realm she's like
[58:43] your complimentary help meet your
[58:45] emotions she's the one that helps you in
[58:48] decision making that doesn't make the
[58:50] decisions for you but you need emotions
[58:52] you need feelings about things you need
[58:54] to you need to be at interact with the
[58:56] world around you the people around you
[58:57] to be able to feel when when something
[59:00] happens this should be a register that
[59:03] is healthy that is holy that is
[59:06] righteous bettors has feeling Amen
[59:10] hallelujah we don't want to push that
[59:12] down but we and I promise you know just
[59:16] say mate this is what the Prophet says
[59:18] around and receive it may his spirit
[59:20] stir you tonight and your emotions
[59:23] greatly to love her more and more so
[59:26] there is something that the spirit can
[59:27] do there the Spirit of God can come and
[59:30] stir your emotions where it doesn't have
[59:33] to happen in the service but he can stir
[59:35] your emotions he can stir you greatly to
[59:39] make him love them
[59:40] you lover more and more because this is
[59:43] what we need we need that grace
[59:45] hallelujah he says here in questions and
[59:51] answers
[59:51] now I'll admit that people study too
[59:54] much they try to go too far ahead and
[59:58] try to sink too hard and sometimes have
[1:00:01] mental breakdowns and things on account
[1:00:04] of studying about the word you must quit
[1:00:07] there you don't have to do that remember
[1:00:14] now because of the education system you
[1:00:18] know we were geared towards our
[1:00:20] strengths will give us the knowledge
[1:00:23] because there's no life in education as
[1:00:26] Laurel doesn't it's not God right
[1:00:28] there's no there's no spirits well there
[1:00:31] are spirits and they're not good ones
[1:00:32] and they're not going to help you but
[1:00:34] God and the different he changes the
[1:00:36] whole thing around he's just become like
[1:00:40] a child and then and just yield and let
[1:00:46] me teach you let me reveal myself to you
[1:00:51] hallelujah this is the kingdom of God
[1:00:54] you don't have to do that the only thing
[1:00:58] I like that and I underlined only thing
[1:01:01] you have to do is fall in love with them
[1:01:04] I can't stress this deeply enough fall
[1:01:09] in love with the Lord and man if this is
[1:01:14] the last service I ever preached him we
[1:01:16] go to a rapture and I could just if
[1:01:19] there was one thing I could tell you and
[1:01:21] say to you that was the deepest most
[1:01:23] richest thing I could ever tell you as
[1:01:25] fall in love of Jesus Christ full of
[1:01:28] love with him amen
[1:01:30] approach God has provided way and fall
[1:01:33] in love with them everything else who
[1:01:36] jizz on that the whole commandments in
[1:01:38] the Lord the law and the commandments in
[1:01:42] the prophets hinge on that thou shalt
[1:01:45] love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
[1:01:46] and all thy soul and all thy strength
[1:01:48] and thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[1:01:50] thyself her man and he says in the whole
[1:01:55] all law and comprar verts everything
[1:01:57] hinges that comes from that there's a
[1:02:02] great wellspring of glorious glory that
[1:02:08] comes out of this your connection to God
[1:02:11] your connection to the supernatural
[1:02:14] manifestation of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:02:17] your connection to the operation of the
[1:02:20] Holy Ghost in your life
[1:02:21] we need the operation of God in this
[1:02:24] church we need the supernatural
[1:02:27] manifestation of the Spirit in this

[1:02:32] our homes in the family altar we need
[1:02:35] the operation of God in our workplace in
[1:02:37] our fatherhood in our motherhood in our
[1:02:40] childhood hallelujah and our brother in
[1:02:43] sisterhood and our professional life we
[1:02:47] need the supernatural manifestation of
[1:02:50] God because you see he has names he has
[1:02:54] a people that he's looking for that
[1:02:57] people that would choose him that he
[1:02:58] knew before the world ever began people
[1:03:00] and he wants to show you he wants to
[1:03:03] lead you he wants to cause divine
[1:03:06] appointments in your life and therefore

[1:03:40] love what does it do it just brings it
[1:03:45] right up into a plane it's just you and
[1:03:48] the Lord you're walking the grassy
[1:03:50] meadows Amen hallelujah amen hallelujah
[1:03:55] you know you get a preview of what its
[1:03:58] gonna be like but just as just the spawn
[1:04:01] cuz neon my what is it gonna be like
[1:04:04] when we go there when we've got a body
[1:04:08] that can handle
[1:04:09] that type of glory you see there's only
[1:04:11] so much this body can handle but why not
[1:04:13] get it all why not have it all why not
[1:04:17] have all that God has allotted to the
[1:04:20] man who is walking adoption in a fallen
[1:04:23] body why not have everything that's
[1:04:25] available there is there's an allotment
[1:04:28] to men there's an inheritance to men and
[1:04:31] we are privileged in this age knowing
[1:04:35] that we're at the end knowing that he
[1:04:37] would give everything hey man he came
[1:04:40] down himself to give everything over and
[1:04:43] hand you the fullness of redemption and
[1:04:45] hand you all of it and say Here I am
[1:04:47] arise my love my fair one and come away
[1:04:54] come on walk with me come I rise up
[1:04:58] above those things let my love come down
[1:05:00] into your temple until your religion
[1:05:04] can't even stand in his presence you
[1:05:09] know amen and just go right on loving
[1:05:15] him he says amen that's not trying to
[1:05:18] push into something or make yourself
[1:05:20] something you're not just go ahead and
[1:05:22] let God use you in the way he wants to
[1:05:24] just yield yourself commit yourself and
[1:05:28] walk on happy singing rejoicing that's
[1:05:32] the way hey man I know it's real simple
[1:05:36] but you see now when when you get that
[1:05:39] right if we can just get that right the
[1:05:42] simplicity of having a joyful
[1:05:44] relationship with God does anyone in
[1:05:46] here just love the joyful relationship
[1:05:48] with God joyful now you're head of your
[1:05:51] times you'll have your moments this
[1:05:52] thing's thought to come out there's
[1:05:54] trials to be overcome all of those
[1:05:57] things but we want to walk rejoicing and
[1:06:02] you can you don't have to have a
[1:06:05] mediocre Christian walk you don't have
[1:06:07] to be boozed out you just need to
[1:06:09] believe believe them and fall in love
[1:06:13] because heat oh my I feel like I'm just
[1:06:16] repeating myself but you know you just
[1:06:17] really I've got a burden on my heart and
[1:06:19] I'm trying to just get it out and that
[1:06:22] is
[1:06:23] if you can just catch it the simplicity
[1:06:25] of it falling in love with Jesus is the
[1:06:28] most important thing the only thing is
[1:06:32] is that you have to do is fall in love
[1:06:34] with them you know and Song of Solomon 4
[1:06:43] 4 verse 9 it says now now that there's
[1:06:49] our love right and we love them and want
[1:06:51] to fall in love with them but now I want
[1:06:53] to just kind of switch around just
[1:06:56] quickly in closing man we only got like
[1:07:01] that far down but anyway and there's now
[1:07:07] a whole other side and it says love now
[1:07:10] when you really really there's a key in
[1:07:12] this because it's actually his love that
[1:07:14] will really help you fall in love with
[1:07:15] them more when you really now you've got
[1:07:18] to meditate on it this is not some
[1:07:20] intellectual thing you have there is a
[1:07:21] meditation on the word that's actually
[1:07:23] effective it will actually help you so
[1:07:26] you see there's a difference between
[1:07:27] trying to push ahead and learn and grow
[1:07:29] annoy and a strength of humanity but
[1:07:31] then there's a meditation on the word
[1:07:33] you know where you actually do just
[1:07:34] before God you know when David is set
[1:07:36] before God and then after he heard all
[1:07:38] that stuff from Samuel it's a set before
[1:07:40] the Lord basking in his presence just
[1:07:43] meditating on what was just told him
[1:07:45] there's a you know you've it's important
[1:07:47] to meditate on there if you hear
[1:07:49] something it's just for you meditate on
[1:07:50] it you know like actually think about it
[1:07:53] ponder it own it say Lord you know
[1:07:56] because quite often we get into a habit
[1:07:58] because we're in a busy age that was so
[1:08:01] good man that service was awesome and
[1:08:03] you enjoyed it and you rejoiced but then
[1:08:04] that's it where's the meditation with
[1:08:08] those nuggets that was just for you just
[1:08:11] for you and you never even bring it up
[1:08:15] again it might come back when you talked
[1:08:18] in fellowship Lynette but there's a
[1:08:20] power in meditating and in this instance
[1:08:24] has love you know when you really if you
[1:08:28] can just pray you know when his presence
[1:08:31] comes the Lord's presence is real thick
[1:08:33] and you you just appreciate even the
[1:08:36] smallest thing
[1:08:37] well you know that's I believe and you
[1:08:40] can have that in your house it doesn't
[1:08:42] just have to be a great service in
[1:08:43] Jewish or a great convention meeting it
[1:08:46] can be in your prayer room it can be
[1:08:48] with your children in your living room
[1:08:49] hey man hey man that can be right down
[1:08:52] there in your home and you're rejoicing
[1:08:54] with the Lord and he comes down and now
[1:08:58] when he comes down you know just
[1:09:01] meditate on the word when he comes down
[1:09:03] because what happens when he comes down
[1:09:05] as your mind becomes more alert and more
[1:09:08] you actually start to appreciate more
[1:09:10] and the little things and win it and so
[1:09:13] here when we start to read this when we
[1:09:17] read this in Song of Solomon 4 9 and
[1:09:22] this is now the Lord addressing the
[1:09:24] bride and he says here you have ravished
[1:09:29] my heart you know this is really really
[1:09:33] powerful you now you he's speaking to
[1:09:36] you you have ravished his heart that
[1:09:40] will ravish as to be transported by love
[1:09:42] to take it into another condition you
[1:09:47] have taken the Lord's heart you are a
[1:09:50] man and woman after God's own heart you
[1:09:53] know now we get distracted and we fail
[1:09:55] and we have all those other things but
[1:09:57] ultimately that seed with a new that's a
[1:10:01] new by predestination is ravished as
[1:10:04] heart that's so in love with God and
[1:10:06] it's a love that your even your flesh
[1:10:09] would disintegrate if it fully
[1:10:10] manifested because it's so powerful
[1:10:12] that's beyond this whole earth would
[1:10:14] just melt if that love that's already in
[1:10:16] you in a seed form and your soul that
[1:10:20] loved that's there ready to just break
[1:10:22] open into a new body and meet your Fiat
[1:10:24] any one day and go into a venture that
[1:10:27] love it's so powerful so thick so
[1:10:29] glorious now that love is a love that
[1:10:34] has and as that but what happens is that
[1:10:38] little seed that begins to grow in your
[1:10:40] life and you become more and more like
[1:10:42] them more and more loving more and more
[1:10:44] of an atmosphere in your life more of an
[1:10:46] anointing more of an
[1:10:48] action you know you want to be you want
[1:10:51] to have an action that pleases God or
[1:10:55] you say you just in a channel and you
[1:10:58] say that thing you know you say the
[1:11:00] right thing you say something and all of
[1:11:02] a sudden the presence of God just swoops
[1:11:03] down you said something that just
[1:11:05] resonated with the spirit you know that
[1:11:08] happens maybe we could say occasionally
[1:11:10] and sometimes it comes and seasons where
[1:11:14] it's happening a lot more and then it
[1:11:15] and it can dry up a little bit and then
[1:11:18] it comes back and you start to have that
[1:11:19] real closeness I truly believe that as
[1:11:23] we near therein and as we love them more
[1:11:25] because I believe you know this sort of
[1:11:28] stuff
[1:11:28] we are just like kind of just oh the
[1:11:30] Lord will just say speak around this
[1:11:32] sort of subject but there's a purpose
[1:11:34] for it it's not just to please our ears
[1:11:37] and make us feel nice and get us more
[1:11:39] victory there this is prophetic you know
[1:11:42] not the this is so but the whole the
[1:11:45] story about our church right we're in a
[1:11:48] prophetic line of we're just going in
[1:11:51] the prophecy of God and and we're
[1:11:53] eventually going to come into something
[1:11:54] and I believe that you know the love of
[1:11:57] God will come so thick and so strong out
[1:11:58] of our own life like a well because you
[1:12:01] are a well of living waters and we're
[1:12:03] just coming out and that resonation
[1:12:06] between us and the Lord will just become
[1:12:08] you know it's like musicians will know
[1:12:11] this but when you or people that know
[1:12:13] sound but when you the wind you resonate
[1:12:15] and you're bringing something into tune
[1:12:16] it goes at us and as it gets in tune it
[1:12:19] goes
[1:12:21] you know vibrates at the same and that's
[1:12:25] exactly what's happening with us we are
[1:12:27] coming into resonance with the Lord and
[1:12:30] if we now and again when his presence
[1:12:31] comes down and you just something just
[1:12:33] quickens to you and you say it and then
[1:12:35] he just swoops all over you and you just
[1:12:37] get caught alone that's some saying come
[1:12:39] away with me oh my you're coming up
[1:12:41] higher now you know we're going up into
[1:12:43] a more heavenly atmosphere we're coming
[1:12:45] up into a more glorious resonance coming
[1:12:48] in tune he's tuning you and tuning me
[1:12:51] and hallelujah this is here you have
[1:12:57] ravished my heart not me but have you
[1:12:59] you have ravished my heart my sister my
[1:13:03] spouse you have ravished my heart with
[1:13:07] one of your eyes man with one chain of
[1:13:16] unique how fear is your love my sister
[1:13:20] my spouse you know when brother Branham
[1:13:22] went up into heaven and his wife he saw
[1:13:26] her in a higher relationship which was a
[1:13:30] sister but a guest of honor that is the
[1:13:34] highest form of marital relationship as
[1:13:37] when you realize in an eternal
[1:13:40] perspective that your wife is actually
[1:13:42] your sister in heaven because you're all
[1:13:45] brothers and sisters and under God and
[1:13:47] yet she's a guest of honor in that place
[1:13:50] so this is just a little bit more closer
[1:13:53] than the rest but still a sister and I
[1:13:56] believe that he would express this to
[1:13:58] her as the highest form of love he would
[1:14:02] say you my sister my spouse I just love
[1:14:05] you you've ravished my heart you've
[1:14:06] taken my heart from being alone you know
[1:14:10] in Eden he said it's not good for men to
[1:14:12] be alone I must make I must bring a wife
[1:14:14] out so that he can have fellowship but
[1:14:18] he was resonating his own desire before
[1:14:20] in himself was a wife that needed to
[1:14:23] come out so that he could fellowship and
[1:14:25] so this love relationship is what we are
[1:14:28] really experiencing and the church has
[1:14:30] been through all the battles all the
[1:14:32] wars all of the ups and downs gone on
[1:14:34] the ground be
[1:14:35] come back up in a resurrection and grow
[1:14:37] and forth into denominations everywhere
[1:14:39] but then finally at the end it would be
[1:14:42] a true seed again that would rise up and
[1:14:45] she would get filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:14:46] and the word would open she would meet
[1:14:48] him and he would bring her out and she
[1:14:50] would come into a resonance with him
[1:14:51] again and vibrate at the same frequency
[1:14:53] until you have a John 5:19 experience in
[1:14:57] your own life who can I use kuben
[1:15:02] moodily does nothing unless the father
[1:15:05] reveals it to him from above you know he
[1:15:07] says here the son of man towards nothing
[1:15:09] except he sees what the father shows him
[1:15:11] that doeth the son of man likewise that
[1:15:13] doors could be moved into light like
[1:15:14] that door has been going likewise that
[1:15:16] doors shannon lee i likewise this is the
[1:15:20] resonance this is us coming up but it's
[1:15:22] what is the vehicle love is it something
[1:15:27] that you have to learn no are you glad
[1:15:30] you don't have to have intellectual
[1:15:31] power and some massive degree or
[1:15:34] anything like that or something you got
[1:15:35] to go on your knees up to the stairs or
[1:15:37] nothing just fall in love with them you
[1:15:40] want a ticket you want a ticket to a
[1:15:42] better walk fall in love of the Lord
[1:15:44] amen no matter what condition you are in
[1:15:46] now whether you're living in a sinful
[1:15:49] way or whether you're doing something
[1:15:50] they told us or whatever condition just
[1:15:54] fall in love of the Lord and force-feed
[1:15:57] yourself a little bit of message until
[1:15:59] you get to a point where you want to
[1:16:00] listen to it that's my testimony I was
[1:16:03] running from the Lord I ran from him for
[1:16:05] a long time about a year did my best but
[1:16:09] your doesn't work when the Lord's
[1:16:11] wanting you he's gonna get you a me and
[1:16:14] I'm so glad hallelujah and it came to a
[1:16:18] point where I realized you know this is
[1:16:21] this the black dog inside me she's
[1:16:22] gotten pretty strong and and he's
[1:16:25] calling the shots but something spoke to
[1:16:27] me as if no matter what you feel just
[1:16:30] put the message on so I tend to at night
[1:16:33] rule oh I don't want to hear it because
[1:16:35] I was still living a simple life but I
[1:16:37] just put it on and and be at work Here I
[1:16:42] am he did it
[1:16:44] something happened what happened was
[1:16:46] that I got stronger all
[1:16:48] sudden things started to change and I
[1:16:49] got strength hey man
[1:16:52] and then one day on the end of my beard
[1:16:56] I laid it all down and I got converted
[1:17:00] by the Holy Ghost
[1:17:02] everything changed from there now that
[1:17:04] was just a simple experience it wasn't
[1:17:07] some big massive thing it doesn't have
[1:17:09] to be a big massive thing it doesn't
[1:17:11] have to be a big meeting or a glorious
[1:17:13] sermon or anything it doesn't have to be
[1:17:15] that it's just what does your heart say
[1:17:19] and I say that to my children often the
[1:17:22] Lord is listening to your heart more
[1:17:24] than your mouth he listens to what your
[1:17:27] heart is saying yeah that's what really
[1:17:29] matters that's why it's so important
[1:17:31] that our heart and our mouth say the
[1:17:34] same thing because the Lord is listening
[1:17:36] to the heart and it's so much better
[1:17:39] when our heart and our mouse is the same
[1:17:41] thing and it pleases the Lord amen it's
[1:17:45] very helpful and that's an prayer
[1:17:48] because you can cry louder in your heart
[1:17:51] than you came of your mouth if you try
[1:17:52] crying as that in your mouth as you can
[1:17:55] with your heart you will break your
[1:17:57] voice box yeah when you're crying to the
[1:17:59] Lord you're so desperate and you can't
[1:18:00] even say anything you can't talk and you
[1:18:04] say and that's when you think net
[1:18:05] scripture oh God may you interpret this
[1:18:07] you know because I can't say it it's so
[1:18:09] it's so burden on my heart or it's so
[1:18:11] deeply desirous to to to to to
[1:18:14] understand something or know something
[1:18:16] what to do next
[1:18:18] you know we need to know the captains
[1:18:20] will show us and sometimes you get into
[1:18:23] a state of desperation before the Lord
[1:18:24] Lord I can't I can't move another step
[1:18:27] without you showing me Lord
[1:18:28] it won't work I've done that before I've
[1:18:30] done my own steps and it didn't work and
[1:18:33] so I had to surrender everything yo and
[1:18:36] you come to a point where you say nah
[1:18:37] there's no more steps today it's my Andy
[1:18:40] and he doesn't take any of his own steps
[1:18:42] anymore my word is a light unto my feet
[1:18:44] and a lament of my path and lord I need
[1:18:46] a revelation of that I need to know what
[1:18:48] you want me to do which way you want me
[1:18:50] to go this Forks in the road this Forks
[1:18:53] in the road tonight this Forks on our
[1:18:55] road you know we can take a path and we
[1:18:58] just say Lord
[1:18:59] I'm here Laura at your will which way do
[1:19:02] I go old which is the way which is your
[1:19:04] perfect will hey man I'm gonna finish
[1:19:07] now if your musicians could come you
[1:19:11] know it's hard for me you know I had to
[1:19:13] pray a lot to come back to this because
[1:19:15] you get so much more and I've had some
[1:19:19] inspiration on other things and I really
[1:19:20] didn't know I felt like maybe I had a
[1:19:23] battle you know to find out whether the
[1:19:25] law wanted me to revisit this subject
[1:19:27] because there was other things coming
[1:19:28] and it was like do I go back to that and
[1:19:31] I very rarely go back to a subject and
[1:19:33] do a part two because you just there's
[1:19:35] the Lord's opening things up as you go
[1:19:36] and and and we're traveling right and
[1:19:39] you don't want to just you don't want to
[1:19:41] hold things back and stay there if it's
[1:19:43] moved on so you've got to kind of just
[1:19:45] move with the Lord but I I heard the
[1:19:48] Lord really lead me to carry on with
[1:19:50] this but I don't know whether I'll come
[1:19:52] back to this or not but so I'll just
[1:19:54] read get the burden can you play what's
[1:19:58] that song called everything's open just
[1:20:01] play that in I'll just read these things
[1:20:02] while it's playing it's in C amen and
[1:20:10] Zephaniah 3:17
[1:20:14] says here the LORD thy God in the midst
[1:20:18] of thee is mighty he will save he will
[1:20:23] rejoice over thee with joy he will rest
[1:20:26] in his love he will joy over thee were
[1:20:29] singing I want to read this in the Bible
[1:20:35] basic English because you understand why
[1:20:41] this is here and that day it will be
[1:20:44] said to Jerusalem have no fear Ozai on
[1:20:48] hello
[1:20:48] Zion have no fear o Zion let not your
[1:20:53] hands be feeble the Lord your God is
[1:20:57] among you as a strong Savior he will be
[1:21:01] glad over you of joy he will make his
[1:21:05] love new again he will renew his love in
[1:21:09] your life maybe there's somebody here or
[1:21:12] on the state that needs to be renewed in
[1:21:15] their love now right where you're
[1:21:17] sitting right here you can be renewed in
[1:21:21] your love tonight because there's the
[1:21:23] power to change you and if you can
[1:21:27] relish his heart let him ravish your
[1:21:30] heart that means to your heart to be
[1:21:33] transported out of the condition that it
[1:21:36] may be in right now or your hearts in a
[1:21:39] good place how about a better place how
[1:21:41] about even more love you can't exhaust
[1:21:44] it you can't sit there and say I'm there
[1:21:47] nobody can sit there and say I've
[1:21:49] arrived because the moment you do that
[1:21:52] you start to die because we're on a
[1:21:54] journey and we got to get this more love
[1:21:58] there's more affection in Christ for him
[1:22:03] sit your affections on things above not
[1:22:05] on the things of the earth where moth
[1:22:08] and rust corrupt us
[1:22:10] but sit them on things about hallelujah
[1:22:16] the Lord will he will make his love new
[1:22:19] again he will make a song of joy over
[1:22:23] you as in the time of a holy feast I
[1:22:27] will take away your troubles lifting up
[1:22:30] your shame from off you see at that time
[1:22:33] I will put an end to all who have been
[1:22:35] troubling you I will give salvation to
[1:22:38] her whose steps are uncertain I will and
[1:22:41] get-together her who has been sent and
[1:22:44] flight and I will make them a cause of
[1:22:47] praise and an honored name and all the
[1:22:50] earth when I let their fate be changed
[1:22:53] now remember he's speaking ultimately of
[1:22:57] Israel but you first inside you you are
[1:23:02] the Israel of God
[1:23:03] hey man you received this inheritance
[1:23:05] just before them and then they'll get it
[1:23:08] after when we go on the rapture hey man
[1:23:13] hallelujah and just finally the last
[1:23:17] thing I want to read
[1:23:23] [Music]
[1:23:34] this is the ultimate and absolute
[1:23:35] necessity that his love would be in our
[1:23:39] life
[1:23:44] season here 1 Kings 8 6 and the priests
[1:23:47] brought in the Ark of the Covenant of
[1:23:49] the Lord unto his place into the Oracle
[1:23:52] of the house to the most holy place even
[1:23:55] under the wings of the cherubims for the
[1:23:57] cherubim spread forth their two wings
[1:23:59] over the place of the Ark and the
[1:24:01] cherubims covered the ark with the
[1:24:02] staves thereof above and they drew out
[1:24:06] the states that the ends of the stage
[1:24:08] was seen out in the holy place before
[1:24:10] the Oracle and they were not seen
[1:24:12] without and there they are and to this
[1:24:15] day there was nothing in the ark safe
[1:24:17] the two tables of stone which Moses put
[1:24:19] there at horrible but when the Lord made
[1:24:22] a covenant with the children of Israel
[1:24:24] when they came out of the land of Egypt
[1:24:26] and it came to pass when the priests
[1:24:28] were come out of the holy place that the
[1:24:30] cloud filled the house of the Lord so
[1:24:33] that the priests could not stand to
[1:24:35] Minister because of the cloud for the
[1:24:37] glory of the Lord had filled the house
[1:24:40] of God amen hallelujah did you notice
[1:24:44] that the glory didn't stay in the Holy
[1:24:46] of Holies but their glory and this is
[1:24:49] for you personalize it tonight there is
[1:24:52] if you haven't got that yet then the the
[1:24:55] Ark can come down now and till your
[1:24:57] lives into your heart into you - to such
[1:24:59] a degree
[1:25:00] amen to such a place that it wouldn't
[1:25:04] just stay there would permeate right out
[1:25:07] and those priests and those ministers
[1:25:09] stand for human effort human liturgy
[1:25:14] human order but there comes a time when
[1:25:17] human order won't stand anymore
[1:25:19] it won't work anymore because the love
[1:25:23] of God would come down so much all your
[1:25:26] complexes all your fears all of the
[1:25:29] troubles in your life is holding you
[1:25:31] back from your blessing your promise
[1:25:33] can be clouded by the love of God that
[1:25:38] would come down and so I believe the
[1:25:43] season for this is now I believe now I'm
[1:25:46] not going to go into all of it there's a
[1:25:48] huge prophetic background all of that to
[1:25:51] show you that it's right now maybe one
[1:25:53] day but now just remember this this
[1:25:58] you've got to pray according to the
[1:25:59] season and the season is now these
[1:26:02] things for her to happen where the love
[1:26:04] of God would come so thick and rich down
[1:26:07] into your life that would just take over
[1:26:10] until all your human effort will fall
[1:26:12] down and say God I can't even minister
[1:26:16] anymore it's not me I can't be a dad
[1:26:18] anymore Lord it needs to be you I can't
[1:26:21] be a mum like I should it's just got to
[1:26:24] be you Lord let the cloud come into my
[1:26:27] life he's the same all the things came
[1:26:31] into a lime and all the things you could
[1:26:33] say Israel fell in love was God and then
[1:26:37] all of a sudden the cloud came down and
[1:26:39] filled the temple it didn't just fill
[1:26:42] the Holy of Holies it went out into the
[1:26:44] whole temple and what happened you watch
[1:26:47] Israel received a golden age amen do you
[1:26:52] want a golden age in your life who was a
[1:26:55] golden age in their life who wants peace
[1:26:57] hey man you want peace from all the war
[1:27:00] well it's coming amen hallelujah coming
[1:27:06] now you can pray and season
[1:27:08] ask the Lord when it's all coming down
[1:27:10] and the Devils around you like a flood
[1:27:12] Lord
[1:27:13] when's your cloud coming down Lord come
[1:27:16] down Lord come and just come and consume
[1:27:19] my life for everything's open all these
