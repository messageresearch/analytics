people here that on sunday you've recovered from covert and you're back in fighting fit and amen we're happy to to to see you here so god bless you um praise the lord so daniel three and we're reading from verse 14. and uh this is a very familiar portion of of the account of shadrach meshach and abednego speaking to the king and uh so we're going to read from verse 14 down to verse 18 we're going to read hebrews 11 and verse 1. so near because nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true oh shadrach mesa meshach and abednego do not ye serve my gods nor worship the golden image which i have set up now if you be ready that at that time you hear the sound of the corner the flute the harp the sack but the pulsary and the dulcimer however you say that and all kinds of music ye fall down and worship the image which i have made well but if you worship if you worship not you shall be cast the same out into the midst of a burning fiery furnace and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands shadrach meshach and abednego answered and said to the king oh nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter so they're not going to beat around the bush they're just going to say if it be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand o king but if not be it known unto thee o king that we will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up amen i was going to go to hebrews 11 and verse 1 just a an incredibly fundamental scripture of the whole christian life hebrews 11 and 1 it says this it says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen amen may the lord bless the reading of his word tonight you may have your seats so i want to as i said on sunday i want to go into the difference between uh intellectual faith and real faith and what we need in this hour is real faith not not intellectual human faith now brother brown makes a statement that's in christ the mystery christ is revealed in his own word in 1965 he says now the stabilizers have been put on the ship talking about the ship of you know of zion this great gospel ship great fearful waves are out before us but we know just beyond that wave yonder we're nearing the shore amen so you can see why the world's getting worse because the waves are getting bigger hallelujah it's yeah the waves are the you know the world getting worse now we are nearing the shore it says just stay stabilized just stay in the woods stay with god no matter how you feel or what anything else just stay right with the word let it stay stable when you see all these great big old clouds around us and storms coming and atomic bombs and everything else they're talking about but our stabilizers is right straight in the word god said it would be here we'll crest every one of them yeah we'll go right over the top of them yes indeed they they can't sink us they can't drown us you put us in the grave we'll come out again that's just all there is to it there ain't no more in the world to keep it uh down there we'll crest every one of them because our great chief captain is calling at the other side so he's saying now stabilizers having put on the ship now what are those stabilizer ask the question now how do you stand the word because he says just stay in the word stay with god well how do you do that having real faith real revelation faith stabilizes the christian that is the stabilizers on the ship that's how you stay with the word how you keep walking with god is real faith not an intellectual faith where where it's just a collection of facts and that are put together that makes sense you know it's not that that's human faith but when it's revealed to you that is that is real faith because we know from james 2 and 19 it says thou believers there is one god thou doest well the devils also believe in tremble so the devil has a kind of faith the devils in hell have a kind of faith but the faith they have does not give them a body change does not give them eternal life doesn't give them heaven so it's an intellectual faith see so everything as i said on sunday everyone has a measure has a faith even atheists and evolution they have to believe because there's got to be a time element in their theories to make it happen but it's faith that puts the time element there see everyone believes in something doesn't matter what they say it is they still have a faith so as a and as as i just quoted the devils have faith too but their faith doesn't save them but the real faith of a christian saves them amen but it has to be revealed now faith is something this is brother brahman in 1951 faith is something that you it's absolutely it's not what you imagine it's a reality many people i say this with humble humility because i mean because i may never see you all again tonight there's probably people i never see in my life now but i say that eighty percent of people that comes to the platform doesn't know what faith is they have a hope but not a faith but faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so many people have a hope well i hope it works i they say they believe or really they have a hope because it hasn't been revealed to them it's a mental understanding yes well i know there's a god i know jesus died on the cross yeah but it's a hope i hope he died for me i hope he purges my salvation but to a believer he doesn't hope or she doesn't hope she knows she knows he died that down calvary for him or her they know that he washed all their sins away that's a real faith it's a reality amen not a imagination now so real faith is knowing and resting this is just me now real faith is knowing and resting that our lord is in control and that he's leading doesn't matter what happens what comes what goes real faith stabilizes there's gonna be a lot of storms and many storms are unexpected right but if you have real stabilizers of real faith you'll crest every wave it may look like you're going to capsize but hey you got to keep going because you've got stabilizers on the ship and those stabilizers stabilize you it's not you stabilizing them amen now he says it works as faith express right there'll be a bit of reading tonight but i'm i'm going to lay a foundation kind of thing going into sunday because i kind of cut my notes in half so i can't put the salt and i can't make you enjoy this all now so um now faith is a revelation from god faith is a revelation that's where i want to stay just a moment it's a revelation he's revealed to you by his grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself into faith you you ever have faith it's given you by the grace of god and god reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation and the whole church of god is built upon revelation remember salvation is a gift of god unless any man should both so that that salvation is a gift right it's nothing we earn it's nothing we mirror it doesn't matter how good you have a perfect spotless life but without god revealing him himself to you his salvation to you you don't have real faith yet i say yet but it's it's a god-given revelation see the world didn't give it the world can't take it away that's why the martyrs could go into the coliseum be eaten by lines and things so they had a revelation faith it wasn't based on circumstance how good or bad life was going it was anchored in them and nothing could take it out of them amen and it's got to be the same thing with us that faith is such a revelation that it's not our own human mind putting it together now since faith is a revelation from god it's not generated by man neither it is is it worked out by man see some people they like to say well they believe something because it makes sense don't ever stay in that bracket well the message makes sense oh that doctrine makes sense no that's just human reasoning by a collection of facts you've come to that conclusion never ever stay there because someone else can come with better reasoning and say no that doesn't make sense this makes sense that's oh i'm so glad i'm out of that now no no that is just human faith by taking a collection of facts and saying it's true no it's got to be more than that it's got to be the god of the bible revealing himself to you in his word amen brother brahm would say your baptist minister told him one time i can't accept revelation he says and you cannot accept the bible because the bible is divinely inspired i remember the first lockdown we ever had i um before that lockdown at work they had a whole bunch of books someone was giving away and there was one book i read when i was like 10 or 12 a novel and i thought i'm going to read that again now it's been a long few decades since i first read it i finished reading it and i realized it's exactly how i remembered it but this is a different kind of book this is a very very different kind of book i mean we can read the same scripture fifty hundred thousand times but every time it gets richer greater deeper means more to you i mean because it's god's eternal word hallelujah so but you've got to allow god to to reveal it to you by revelation amen it's not our own human mind amen that that will take us in a rapture otherwise i'm out hallelujah but god never wanted it that way he wanted it that salvation is all him amen so we must see so since since that so since real faith is a revelation then someone who's received it cannot boast in what they know or what's been revealed to them because they realize it was god given it wasn't them given it wasn't them that generated it it wasn't them that worked down their mind or put no matter how perfectly the quotes and the scriptures all dovetail together unless god comes down anoints that and makes it living in you that's just human faith and human faith both in itself the scribes and pharisees they were big boasters they loved to show off by how they dressed and the big prayers they gave and all the outward things but it was all human faith it wasn't a divine revelation from god so if faith is really revealed to you you cannot boast in it because it's god-given amen it's god himself speaking to you and revealing yourself and revealing himself to you where you might begin to say well if it's all god-given and it's nothing i can do what's the point of reading your my bible listening to the message and praying if i can't if i can't get revelation myself well the answer is very very simple the reason we do those things is that god can reveal himself in it to you i mean because it should be a hunger lord i want to know you more like we read i mean like we sung lord i want like um i remember francois lipper card he's a pastor in switzerland he says every time he reads the bible he prays lord may the character of you that's revealed in here manifest itself in me that's his whole purpose of reading the bible not the stuff is head full of theology but that god's character which is revealed in here will be manifested in here amen so that's why you read and pray and listen be so god can take his own nature put it into you because lord i want to know you more i want to have a greater relationship with with you i mean i'll also say cries lord i want a deeper walk i want a richer walk i want a better relationship i mean then i had before i want to be more like you so if you spend time in those things you you're giving god something to work with to give you revelation who wants revelation who wants to be more like him i mean so so there's great value in those things but don't rest on your laurel saying well i know all these things some great intellectual giant walking around of quotes and scriptures and you know it's got to become living it's got to become flesh amen because otherwise it is just human intellectual faith now it says in romans 10 and 17 so faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god i mean so if you really want faith you've got to hear the word of god it comes by the hearing of the word of god that's how faith is transmitted into us see amen so now intellectual faith just makes people as brother brown would call them a stuffed shirt he says you take a stuffed shirt thinks they know it all look how great i am you know they've got message books and bibles you know this carrying them around and thinking they've got it all together all the pins and the belt buckle and all those things they think they're something you know they think they're god's gift to the bride now the only gift that god's given is himself amen so now so a stuffed shirt thinks they just know everything so brother man says this in the message fellowship he says you take a fellow that's always lord i'll do this if you'll do this and things like that god knows he'll be a stuffed shirt anyhow so human faith is all on condition lord if you do this i'll do this lord if you know it's all about condition but but real real faith is sold out a person has real revelation faith is totally sold out to god no matter what happens what comes what goes trouble no trouble good times bad times they're sold out i mean so we don't want to be stuffed shirts i don't believe i'm looking at stuffed shirts i'd love to look at genuine christians amen they're like lord it's all you amen he would say and and and the message that day on calvary he says now for repentance a remission of sin must be preached in his name to all the world beginning at jerusalem hallelujah glory there you are he says what does calvary mean to you what did that day do to you what a good question did it stuff you out with some theology did it make you a stuffed shirt or did it make you a christian sold out i mean to ask the question what did that day do to you amen that day took my sins far away that they gave me the new birth that they may be a new creature in christ that they gave me the baptism of the holy ghost that's what it did for me hallelujah and it didn't make me a stuffed shirt i trust you can agree that this is from your own personal experience it did not make us stuffed shirts but it made us a christian sold out sold out to what his word to his leading no matter where it takes you amen a believer who who is totally surrendered to god does not put conditions on god when he comes to him or she comes to him so it's not like lord i'll give you my life if you give me a good life oh lord i'll serve you if you give me this job or if you give me this spouse no no that's not what it's about see that is an intellectual faith that's not sold out i mean sold out is willing to to be led wherever god will take you he may take you through heartache he may take you through disappointments he may take you through sickness he may take you through loss through hurt amen but you'll just go on rejoicing and conducting yourself in the trial like a child of god amen jesus would say to john's disciples john was in prison brother braham says like his eagle eyes were filmed over and he sends his disciples to to jesus saying are you the one or do we look for another now remember john saw the spirit of god descend upon jesus like a dove and that was the sign he says here's the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world great things happen but he finds himself in a hard spot in prison because he does not expect his life to end up that way and i could guarantee a hundred percent of us would say when bad things happen i'd expect that to happen right but then jesus just told john's disciples when when that question and to me that was the greatest i think brother brown said it in this kind of way too it was like the worst question you could ever ask jesus are you really the one or do we look for another and then jesus did not seem to send john a couple of books on how to behave in prison he said to john's disciples just sit here and watch what happens and the sicker healed the dead erased the gospels preached to the poor many mighty signs and miracles are done and then so john and he says blessed is he who's not offended in me so he's saying to john basically if you're not offended you're blessed so if you're not offended where god takes you in life you're blessed amen because we all we we would always think there's just going to be a great power of overcoming and victory and stomping on every devil and you know hey we do get that in life right but there's pain and heartache and agonizing moments and hardship but blessing you if you're not offended at god in those things see we should never ever blame god for where we end up god it's your fault i'm annoyed at you i'm gonna i'm i'm not gonna talk to you for a while now i'm gonna give you the cold shoulder and you know we should never treat our god he's god he's he's not a man that's a flawed human being that has to grow and learn no no he knows all things he's the almighty he has no flaw in his character he cannot you know he doesn't he's not like me that can offend people just by how they don't do things or do things you know he's not that kind of a man he's god so we should never ever be offended where he takes us in life amen and i say real faith is not offended if you have divine faith reveal faith there should be no offense now that doesn't mean you don't feel pain and you don't feel heartache or disappointment or loss or sickness we're not exempt from those things we don't we have no free pass right everything that we face the world has two right but we should be so sold out lord if you're gonna take me through you're gonna take me through lord if this is today's schedule praise god if this is my decade schedule praise god how you doing he's leading me that's the thing that matters i'm not doing too well but he's doing real good amen he'll lead me through that's real uh faith amen now it could be easy i just put here this is not even the beginning but to begin with what faith is not real faith is not these things now he says here there's an expected expectancy faith knows no defeat faith is perfect faith brings things when there is no things to be brought faith creates faith takes doubt away takes negative makes positive how beautiful the old man has a basis for faith now listen this is what faith is not faith is not so mythical something mentally worked up it's an absolutely fundamental result that happens in a person's heart so it's not something that's worked out it's not something that's just imagined and this is how it's going to be and this is how the situation is going to pan out and this is how i want things to go that's not faith that's something that's mentally worked up he says look not because i'm standing here saying it but if you can understand how it is that faith is not something mentally perceived but it's a myth but it's a revelation a revelation of god by faith not intellectual but by his heart so it's not something that you mentally perceive remember this is not a university lecture hall glory hallelujah this is not inorganic chemistry 101 oh calculus or whatever things i endured too much of you know this is not what this is about this is not sitting an exam to working out everything and then you're going to go on a rapture this is not this is not how faith works that is just mental understanding amen see faith is not what you feel faith is what you believe so it goes beyond feeling it goes beyond the five senses you know the prophet said that real faith is a sick sense i mean that you used to contact god with because you don't contact god with your eyes or with your even just your vocal cords or how you feel or taste smell all those things no it's by faith you touch god by amen you know faith is a subconscious thing it's not like oh i need faith for this right now no no no no it's subconscious you have it and don't realize see he says faith is a subconscious thing lady faith is not a mental act see it's something that you subconsciously do it people trying to look to their intellects for faith when faith doesn't lay their reasons lay their faith lays in the soul i say reasonings work against god unless they are you you can take your reasoning back to the scripture you know so i'm sick but your reasoning says buy stripes i'm healed or he's going to see me through this problem that's that's good reason but but reasoning of trying to work out how it's going to happen that that ain't going to help you but faith is subconscious it's not like oh there's a trouble now now i've got to try and get some faith no no you've already got it if you've got it amen now jesus was asked in luke 17 and verse 20 he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of god should come he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation neither shall they say lo here or there for behold the kingdom of god is within you so they wanted to they wanted something physical they could see you know when's the kingdom gonna come i want to know i need to know the facts all these things but he's saying it's not with observation so it's not something that you just read about that you can observe it's in front page i'll say this even front page news it's not with observation the kingdom he says the kingdom of god is within you so it's not something that can be that can be researched out mentally or or or seen with your eyes or your five senses it's not with observation you cannot observe this thing coming it's got to be within you what is the kingdom of god within you the baptism of the holy ghost that is within you so i say even now when the world is falling apart and russia is doing what it's prophesied to do no no you say well the rapture's close because that's happening no that's just the backdrop but the main character is on stages is actually you and god and god is wearing you talking to you making him making you more like him getting you into his image right because when the bride realizes what she is then the rapture will go when we realize we are the word made flesh today amen we are the revelation of god made manifest what we read on paper here shall be material in here hallelujah so it was once once on tape form it's now in bright form amen so that's how it should be right so you know we are actually the sign that the end uh world is falling apart because we're getting ready hallelujah i mean so the kingdom of god is within you it's not by observation it's not that you can search the right websites to find it no it's within you the holy ghost amen now faith is not denying symptoms it's not denying symptoms the three hebrew children do not deny now i'll hopefully come to them again and if not we'll be there on sunday but they did not deny that they were facing the furnace they did not deny or say no we're not we're not going nowhere near that furnace this is not how this is going to work out no they resigned their fate to god because that was real faith whatever happens we're not going to bow down if he delivers us praise the lord if not we're not we're not worshiping your image so whatever the outcome is of our walk he's in control and we're not going to sweat it out because he's in control amen so he says brother braham says and um how can i overcome he says you can't say i've got a sickness i don't believe it's a sickness he says oh yes it's a sickness you've got cancer you say i don't believe it's a cancer it's a cancer it's a cancer some people say no no i don't have it. he's saying don't do that he says but remember greater is he that is in you that's he that's in the world you must realize that the holy spirit that's in you has already overcome this thing and he is in you and you can overcome by him he says that's exactly sensible it's exactly the way the scripture's written overcoming she can't say i don't have it no no you've got it right but you know sometimes you know i believe in medical science right and we'll go into how god answers in different avenues but sometimes it can be just be good to go to the doctor to find out the devil's name that you're fighting sometimes it's just a good oh now i know what it is i can call it out now you say well i but even in saying that you say you can't get a diagnosis just know no devil can hide from god amen so it's exactly sensible to recognize the enemy and then realize the one that that is in you has already overcome that enemy doesn't matter what form or shape or size it may be and now some people just want to go to the quote and we're going to go into it where brother ram says don't don't sign for the devil's parcel and they take it out of context they think that's basically just flat denying it's there but let's just read this he says he says symptoms is something like say tomorrow when you go home now to your place the express agent will come and say hey mrs doe or you say the courier comes that's the express agent are you mrs doe you say yes i have a present for you all right what is it hands over a basket or a box yeah something hitting in that box you look it's a big box of snakes rattlesnakes well you don't want them things well you say i don't want them oh but they're yours somebody sent them to you here's your name here's the name it's somebody sent these snakes to it's yours you have to have them now in one sense of the world word they're yours in the other sense they're not somebody sent them to you but they're not but they're not yours until you sign for them that you've received them now i'm going to go on to that and when you sign you've received them then they're yours but if you refuse to sign for them he has to take them back to the express company the express company has to send them to the one that sent it to you is that right well don't sign for nothing the devil brought no sir just refuse to have it no sir say i haven't got it devil you'll take it all back that's all i won't have it refuse to have your sickness your arthritis whatever it is i haven't got it by his stripes i'm healed stand right on your ground confess it believe it stay there god will bring it to pass no matter what it is just believe him what's he basically saying he doesn't say deny it's on your porch or just turn a blind eye to it don't receive it when you receive something it becomes part of you right when you receive something it becomes part of you so now two to stand there and refuse it sure you've got the symptoms but you're not accepting it it's not part of you you haven't received it though it's on your porch and you can hear the snakes rattling around in the box and it's in your house that's there but you don't accept it you want it out right see it's very you know it becomes part of you if you accept it so when it comes to sickness don't ever say it's yours or you've got a real heavy depressive spirit on you don't say it's your depression i mean never say it's your cancer or your diabetes or your high blood pressure or your vertigo what is that that's receiving the snakes right but if you say this is not mine i don't want it it doesn't belong to me then god i believe will take it away from you in his time amen is that is that in balance i think you know because we can't deny if you've got something you can't just deny and say it's not there right now the prophet said you've got to recognize it's there but recognize the one in you has already overcome it and you don't receive it right you send it back stomp on box return to sender hallelujah amen now he says in jehovah gyra i've seen so many times that people say well i've got it all figured out i've got to understand it then it isn't faith anymore faith is not what you understand faith is what you accept and can't explain it's an act of faith he says faith is not a myth neither is it something you just imagine faith is positive faith is a substance just the same as this glasses or the same as this book is now real faith will speak when david faced goliath it wasn't him and his humanity speaking the outcome it wasn't him deciding i'm going to kill you it wasn't him just mentally see it wasn't a power of just a positive confession that we mentally say this is how it's going to end up he did not he did not in his own mind say i'm going to cut your head off and then i'm going to kill all these philistines too i'm going to feed them all to the birds that wasn't him speaking the outcome in his humanity that was god taking his lips and prophesying the enemy's doom amen there's a big difference between me saying well this is how this is going to work out and god's saying this is how it's going to work out and and really it's when the holy ghost gets a hold of you and speaks the outcome that's when god's going to do it but we can sign our mind well this is i believe this is going to happen it could just be hope it could just be i i think so i'm you know this is how i think it's going to work out that's not speaking your outcome that's just you hoping it's going to happen but when god speaks it it's very different thing because we know the end of the story with david he killed goliath he used goliath sword to chop his head off and and the rest of israel the only reason david didn't go kill them all is because the army of israel chased after the philistines hallelujah but you go read the account he says i'm going to kill you and all your buddies behind you i'm going to wipe you all out and he had five stones in his in his script bag because goliath had brothers and relatives other giants he just killed them all but that was god speaking through him the outcome amen it's exactly the same when brother tim pruitt a few years ago his wife's sister karen had the first brain bleed and they were there in the icu he had the family there and he said no no we believe we believe god can do it because that's what believers do we believe the word of god and he said that she'll be in icu that night she'll be in a normal ward the next night and the third night she'll be back at home and that's exactly what happened why because god took his lips and spoke the outcome it wasn't him in his mind saying this is going to happen it was god speaking the outcome through him and it happened exactly that way amen so we're going to let the lord do that kind of thing when faith speaks that revelation begins to speak it's not you speaking it's god speaking through you i mean you see the reason david could do that is because it was revealed to him that it could be done it wasn't just a faith or or they knew uh he knew it could be done i'll just read the quote he says here now a little david's standing there little piece of leather goat skin or sheepskin with two strings piece of string tied to it but it was revealed to him revelation struck him amen he said the god that took me out the pores of the bear took me out of the pores of the lion how much more will he deliver that uncircumcised philistine into my hand his brothers were more than able to do it saul head and shoulders above his army but you see it wasn't revealed to them amen there it was they believed it could be done and that faith was just human faith intellectual faith they believe that god could do it but it wasn't revealed to them but it was revealed to david see now there's a difference right there if it's absolutely revealed to you that god is going to heal you you're going to get it you're going to get it i don't care what's wrong with you what's the odds that may be worse than david and goliath but if it's revealed to you and notice when it's revealed david became fearless he says today i'll cut your head off amen that's our god by grace and that crucial moment when decisions had to be made that same god that produced the grace in that day and dropped that seed of faith in that little hunchback looking boy being in his heart that same god and this crucial moment could take that woman from that wheelchair that man this woman here that child that little grain of faith is revealed to you he says then i don't care how long it takes because it's revealed it's not a hope or an intellectual faith it's revealed faith amen you see his brothers when he first turned up to the battle one of his brothers said you're just naughty you've just come out here to watch the battle you're being naughty and they just thought it was just bravado but it wasn't bravado speaking it was revelation speaking when he was speaking to goliath and saying who why doesn't someone go face this guy he's uncircumcised philistine who's this one who defies the army he's a living god they thought you're just being a naughty boy go back to your sheep go back to father's house but it wasn't bravado it was revelation speaking now today the girls had their cross country at school and we saw especially with the boys running a lot of bravado they would start sprinting and they and they went round the field then they went off you know went off somewhere came back the other side of the school those ones sprinting weren't even at the front at all when when when the finishing line was coming it was all bravado but they didn't have what they needed to finish the race you see it was all in the head it wasn't in the heart but those who had more than bravado but they knew i could win i can run this race i can do it i don't need to stop they were the ones who ran all the way and they won the race it means it's got to be the same thing with us it can start with brava yo it can appear see bravado is just trying to show off to see who can win it's the same thing with intellectual faith it may appear good at the beginning but it doesn't last the distance amy but so intellectual faith is what but the thing is intellectual faith is what we start with but don't stay with it because it will fail see what if that bravado was actually real stamina to run they would have won but they started sprinting and then when the you know going got hard they just quit i don't believe we've start when we're not on the christian journey like that amen it's actually when we need that faith it actually comes to the forefront it's not just provided not just an intellectual faith now intellectual faith is not enough it will bring you to the holy ghost the prophet says he says earnestly contending for the faith he says now he says he says you get the intellect um he says paul was down there in the natural realm with his phd he didn't know he had an intellectual faith but he didn't have a divine faith it's quite a difference in me having an intellectual faith in a divine faith that's where you my baptist friends fail to go on you get the intellectual faith by that but it must be a divine revelation of jesus christ you that takes sin out of the heart intellectual faith is not enough it's all right but it only brings you to the holy spirit so an intellectual faith will reveal to you that you're a sinner an ethical intellectual faith will reveal to you there's more to life than what you see that there's a world after there's somewhere where you're going to go intellectual faith faith will show you that jesus died on calvary to make an atonement for you that you can go to heaven it will just bring you to it but don't just stay there you've got to go from intellectual faith into a real holy ghost personal experience that'll give you a genuine new birth and will give you divine revelation amen will make you a new creature in christ hallelujah there's seat that's where the difference comes see we start off all start off with intellectual faith but don't stop there see some people stop there because they say well the great mystery in the end time was the holy ghost you're the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation but they just leave half the quote because the rest of the quotas but the works of christ did you like you did before hallelujah so but some people just say well oh our sensation nothing happened but praise the lord i must have it it can just be intellectual faith that's why you've got to be able to say no i really met him he changed my life what i once was i'm no longer that person it may happen very different ways to different people we've got to say there's been a change in me since i really met him amen now faith faith is knowing the lord is completely in control and fully trusting in him and being willing to accept however he wants to answer now now i'll just read this so he says faith finds a source that other people don't know nothing about just like the ones who won the cross country today or kept running the whole race i'll put it that way when a man has got faith in god he's got a hold of something that he can't explain it it's something he's got a hold of he cannot push it or shove it or pull it it takes him that's the way faith is when a man really has got faith in god it finds that source that others don't see i mean so real faith you can't push you can't shove you can't pull so you can't push it to happen you can't pull it to happen you can't shove it say god make this promise happen you can't even though we call out that way but but you can't shove it you can't push it you can't pull it it takes you your faith takes you to the promise hell it's not you you're humanly trying to work it out your faith will take you to the promise amen it takes you hallelujah now god is not a cookie cutter he doesn't answer the same time every way you can see in david's life he killed the lion and the bear and goliath with the slingshot he never used it after that right sometimes god told him go attack them other times he's waiting and praying and god says no don't go yet but go this way or when you hear the sound of it going through the mulberry trees you know so god is not a cookie cutter but we need to be surrendered to however he wants to answer us see the hebrew children did not have their preconceived idea of how it's going to work out they had real faith they did not speak their outcomes saying we're not going to go anywhere near the furnace and all those things they just went they knew god was able to deliver if not well they're not going to bow so now so we must real faith is willing to be led to however the answer comes you know there's um we know that there's the four four living creatures around the throne the four cherubims right as the holy ghost and different me uh different dispensations or however you want to put it down through the ages so the first anointing has had a face like a like a lion and sometimes god will just heal in a miracle like this supernatural just just like that something can happen right sometimes he'll answer that way i'll leave the ox till last but but then sometimes it can be through the face of a man which is man's understanding like medicine or a change in diet or you're getting enough sleep and god can heal you that way see lord i need i need help with this ailment in my body you know show me know touch my life change me then someone comes along and says how's your diet are you getting enough sleep you know are you you know how's your how's your quiet time you know and and you find that that's gone that's how the lord answered but if you're just looking for a bolt from the blue you'll miss the answer right um and then there's also divine healing and ego anointing lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover it's different to a miracle but it's still divine healer it's still god right there's a difference between an instant miracle and a divine healing divine healing can take a process of time lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover he doesn't give a specification of the time but then there's also the ox anointing which he had to carry unto death but are we willing to be led whoever god wants us to take it remember sickness is not a sign of unbelief trouble is not a sign that your faith is dropped remember faith is not some kind of force field that keeps all trouble away no faith gives you overcoming power to go through the trial conduct yourself like a believer that's what real revelation faith does amen so we've got to be willing however god will lead us through every trial are we are we surrendered to it like the hebrew children they didn't make up their mind this is going to happen they say well god can do it if not we're still not bowing so we're still going to die in the faith we're going to die believing and and and if they went into the furnace got burnt up would it be any more of a supernatural thing would it be less it'll be the same because everyone else bowed but their faith overcome in the pressure i mean otherwise you look at you know you can take examples and i'll just give this real quick then we'll then then we'll push pause and continue on sunday but you see peter peter was in prison in the book of acts and he was going to get beheaded and he got delivered james got beheaded some people say well james had less faith than peter no james finished his course ran his race and god said i'm taking you home now peter did not get beheaded because his course wasn't finished amen you take daniel the lion's den the lions didn't need him but then you take the martyrs you know you know who are feet to the lions which one had more faith well they both had faith god wasn't finished with daniel and god was finished with them on this earth he wanted to take them home but he's saying daniel i'm not taking you home yet you're actually gonna you have to live out a bit longer then i'll take you home see it's however avenue god will take our life we've got to be remember real christians sold out and that's why you can't compare your life with someone else's because some people just seem to tiptoe around trouble and some of us just wade through it you know but who's got the more faith see all that no no they both have the same revelation some through the fire some through the flood you know but all through the blood but it but it's all it's all god has pre conde you know he has predetermined our our walk and if you go through a trial the prophet says actually he's counted you're worthy to go through it so we can rejoice and say lord thank you but intellectual faith we'll just look at the here and now and say this ain't fair but real faith looks beyond the now and looks to the prize say lord jesus you're in this with me you didn't lead me here to leave me here you're going to lead me all the way through amen so real faith is a revelation it's revealed to you it's a substance of things hopeful the evidence of things unseen it anchors into your heart and you know it's going to happen you don't know how but you know god's going to do it it's not something you work up pump up push pull whatever no god just drops it in changes your whole life and you go on rejoicing saying thank you lord the answer's on the road amen we're gonna we're gonna push pause right there and we'll continue on sunday but aren't you glad for real faith it's more than this when this fails it's in you know it's in here you know there's some some christian denominations they they say well if you get alzheimer's you're lost because you can't think of god anymore god's greater than his mental faculties you know someone can be full up with with dementia all kinds of things but their soul is sealed into the kingdom what happens to this body is actually it doesn't matter when it comes to salvation if you're sealed to the day of your redemption you can lose your mind you're still going amen you say well would the lord allow that to happen he allowed a lot of things to happen to a lot of people it didn't mean god was remember brother brahm says that sunny days is not a sign of god's pleasure or rainy days a sign of his displeasure in your life that doesn't even come to the equation he loves you he died on calvary for you his love doesn't change your love of god how rich and pure how measureless and strong it's not conditional like our level doesn't fluctuate like the stock market or the currency it doesn't go up and down because of market forces it stays constant and you're glad he doesn't change his mind about you at your worst he loves you at your best he loves you all the same and your down times and your broken times you can be upside down don't know which way you're going you can be walking in totally the wrong direction he still loves you and his love will just pull you back on the road hallelujah amen let's have some musician musicians please tonight so i think i've been slurring a lot here but i trust you know what i say you know i think i said too oh yeah anyway praise the lord real faith matt go beyond here go down into here amen from intellectual to a revelation faith be revealed to you see the the rapture is a revelation when it when he anchors it into your heart that he's taking you home all the fear goes we shouldn't be afraid of a body change what's happening in the world it shouldn't it should just make us excited and the world might think how are you excited well we're going to glory soon and very soon we're going to see the king amen amen let's um do we have that song faith turns the night into the day amen because it does doesn't it turns the night into

hallelujah amen let's uh bow our heads in a word of prayer tonight gracious lord i just want to pray father for each and every one of us may we not just have an intellectual faith something that's just in our mind that we have worked out that it makes sense because we've put a couple of facts together and lord i'll walk with you is never meant to be that way lord our walk with you as lord you reveal yourself you become alive lord your lord where you were once a god of history you become a god of the present you step out of history into time into our lives and your word becomes alive comes

pray for anyone here lord lord as we read tonight lord our intellectual faith will bring us to the holy ghost but lord we don't want to just stay like that lord but we want to make a full surrender that you can fill us oh god you can reveal yourself to us lord that then after that we no longer live by our own intellectual faith but as the apostle paul said the life i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god which is real divine faith o god may that be all our testimony tonight lord if there's anyone here who doesn't have that kind of a testimony lord maybe there's hunger and thirst or may they give all their life to you grant it dear god your god to be met lord you're a personal god you're more than an idea or a nice a nice phrase or lord you're more than that lord
