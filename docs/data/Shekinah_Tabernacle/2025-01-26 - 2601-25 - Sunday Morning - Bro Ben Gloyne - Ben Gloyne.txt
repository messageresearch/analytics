========================================

[Music] for l h [Music] praise the Lord good morning how are you doing this morning it's good good I know I always say that but I always want to [Music] know always like seeing you always like coming up here and you know seeing the different Brethren and and some I know quite well some I know not as well as others but you know I do I know all of you and I know the different Pathways you've taken and the different places where the Lord's LED you um in your life and here we are here in this moment here just the Lord's just intertwined all of us um this morning and we're on a journey we and our journey didn't start here it started in the mind of God before this all began and you're on the most amazing Supernatural Journey you've ever been on in your entire life and you're the star of the show I don't care what your life might look like you're the star of the show the whole show has been written about you all the twists and turns that we might take and everything like that you know the Lord the Lord's in the whole thing he's got to be you know and even even when we the things that we don't understand he's still in it all you know he's been to every single place that that every single place that a human being could end up in there's only one place that of all those places where where there's no way back from it you know when we blaspheme the Holy Ghost but apart from that every other place where a human being could possibly find themselves stuck and mired down in somewhere the Lord's been there and he's able to take us from every single place you know we sometimes in life it seems so complicated like like even you think of David and Beth Sheba you know it seemed like such a complicated awful situation and then suddenly it was just it was like a big mess that that that really shouldn't have happened in the first place and then nothing should have become of that but then out of that whole big mess came Solomon you know which is which is one of the greatest kings that that there ever was and out of that mess came Jesus actually and when you think about that you think you know sometimes I think God just puts these things in there to show us it doesn't matter where like our picture I imagine a sheep you know it sort of gets Tangled Up In some mess somewhere but the Lord's able to go anywhere and untangle it and get it out of there and even even in that mess that David created the Lord showed I can even get to there and untangle it all and make something of it and that's the god that we serve this morning so let's let's stand and let's let's just come in adoration to the Lord that you know he's a he's a great Redeemer that that that he's got our life in the palm of his hand and that's all everything's going to be all right amen Lord we just commit the service to your hands this morning we can just see Lord your great power Lord and your glory that you're you're mighty to save Lord and you're not Lord you're such a bold Redeemer Lord you have boldness to go to every part every place that there is Lord You're bold Lord every every area that we could find ourselves in Lord you're not scared but you're bold Lord to to go to that area wherever we are Lord and to redeem us from whatever situation we might be in Lord and then when you do Lord you just give us such a wonderful life Lord you you fill our heart with good things Lord we have this relationship with you in our heart Lord and we just begin to worship you and praise you and we we act different we think different we talk different Lord there's something burning in our hearts that just makes us happy to be alive Lord so we're here this morning and we're so thankful to be alive today Lord we don't have any negativity in our hearts Lord because everything you've ever

to read just this one uh or these two verses here am then we'll go to prayer we got one prayer request um all my Robins asked for prayer she's been a well for the last two days so pray the Lord will touch her even now and she'll be well amen so let so let's read here Hereafter this is our Lord Jesus speaking he says Hereafter I'll not I will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me but that the world may know that I love the father and as the father gave me commandment even so uh I do arise let us go hence amen praise the Lord let's bow our heads in a word of prayer shall we if you ever need you want slip your hand up to the Lord amen let's talk to our great king almighty God we're so thankful Lord at the sound of Your Great Name Lord Jesus

the promise Lord that by your stripes she is healed so father I pray every symptom would leave her body now may she raise up strong and well and anyone else who's not here because of sickness Lord May

these moments Lord pray you ever prospered Lord may may Souls be borne into the kingdom there father Grant it Lord we thank you Lord we commit the service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats uh this morning so I want to talk about we have no part in him and that's the devil right we have no there should be something burning in our souls that I want nothing to do with him he has nothing to do with me anymore I want nothing to do with him I mean if we read the same scriptures from the Amplified uh version here I'm just going to read it says I'll not talk much with you more for the Prince which is the Evil Genius ruler of the world is coming and he hath no claim on me he has nothing in common with me there is nothing in me that belongs to him and he has no power over me but Satan is coming and I do that as the father commanded me so that the world may know be convinced that uh I love the father and that I only do what the father has instructed me to do I act in full agreement with his orders arise let us go away from here amen I believe both those scriptures is a bride's commission amen that the devil has no claim in US he got nothing common with us we've got nothing in common with him we should abhor the very thought there's even a little part of him that overlaps our lives amen because we have nothing in common with with him this is the theme of the service right amen so as as as John would write or the Lord Jesus would have written down that he our Lord the king of kings and Lord of lords has washed us from our sins in his own blood now when you wash something you separate the dirt the muck from the Garment amen so the power of blood has loosed us from the chains of Satan amen so if we've been loosed we've been loosed I mean we haven't been partially loosed we've been completely loosed by the blood of Jesus Christ amen so if that be true the devil has nothing to do with us we have nothing to do with him the only thing we got to do with him is cast them out amen it's the principal work of the church is to drive out the devil wherever we find him amen cuz he does not belong where you are and we don't belong where he is amen we belong in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we don't belong in the carnality the muck and Mar of unbelief and sin and all the nonsense that the devil has now we're going to realize that we're dominated by a spirit right everyone here who is alive has a spirit in them working right amen and so brother Braham says this in the waters of Separation he says if he only knew friend that's spiritual you have to realize that every person has a spirit in them and if the person could only see what kind of a spirit dominated your life that you act indifferent towards Christ You' be ashamed of yourself no matter how you're dressed how well how popular you are with the peoples yet in your heart if God could only turn the Looking Glass to your heart you see the thing is the devil Works in deceit he will make you think that his thoughts are your thoughts he'll make you think that his ways are your ways see he never just comes to you and says I'm the devil think this way no he always puts thoughts in your mind which are first person towards you so for example you know you get big melancholic bit down you say well I feel sad I feel depressed you know I just feel life's too to hard where are those thoughts from they ain't from God Amen now Jesus came to give us life and life more abundantly every day should be a joy and be in excitement because we're walking with our resurrected savior am me every day is an opportunity for him to prove his word in your life amen every day is full of possibility of the supernatural of God fulfilling his word in your life so why would we feel down depressed in the dumps that ain't come from God you see but the Devil Makes Us think it's us thinking that or all to get brother or sister oh they did this she said this he said this whatever no that's the devil trying to bring separation amen but the problem is we think it's us thinking that it ain't us thinking that it is the devil putting those thoughts in your mind even someone asked brother brand and one of the questions that answers how do I know I'm thinking God's thoughts well brother R says well God's thoughts are his word it's not very complicated right so if your thoughts are not matched up with God's word towards one another towards God towards yourself towards the devil you're not thinking the right kind of thoughts it's actually the devil thinking his thoughts in you he because we got to realize that the devil wants to dominate I mean when when when when um you know Pride he was lifted up in Pride and arrogancy when he was when he was the uh you know the Cherub anointed CH that cover and Heaven thought he was better than everyone else there he he had this domination that wanted to come out subdue but his whole plan was to divide amen the great Angelic host and we know that that war that started in heaven amen came down upon on the earth cuz Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and his angels and the devil lost that battle he was cast down to the Earth so now that same battle is come down upon human beings brother man speaks about this in greatest battle ever fought and so that same battle that that was being fought up in up in heaven now has come upon you and I now we've got to realize the devil's purpose in heaven was to divide to rule that was his purpose he wanted to gather gather Angels ZD him to make his own kingdom which was contrary to God's Kingdom so we're going to realize that the same battle comes in amongst you and I because this battle's upon you and I see the devil doesn't want us unified he doesn't want us to have one heart one mind one Accord full of the love of God praising him living for him sold out Blood Washed Blood Bought full of the Holy Ghost he doesn't want us to be a unified group he wants us to have clicks and Clans and different different different things going on in the church this ain't some High School lunchroom right I went to boarding school we had a lunchroom and the the first 15 sat there and eight the Nerds were there and everyone else was kind of there but everyone had their table and their friends and this ain't like that here that's carnality that's the devil dividing Humanity based on bunch of nonsense that don't last too long but no we're here to be United under the Eternal Word of God am mean we're to realize that we're a United body and anything that comes in between you and your brother or sister is actually a demon Spirit trying to divide trying to break the power of the church amen now if this battle's come upon human beings now then as I said before the devil's so crafty he makes you think you're thinking his thoughts if we could only see in the spiritual realm I think we'd look at things very differently I remember there was brother Daniel white at one of the uh where a youth camp uh Youth Camp up in taranaki years ago and he told a story of when him and some brothers went to a restaurant to have a meal and I and and I'm not sure if he or one of the other brothers saw it but there's a waitress there with a lust Spirit on her and and and when the brother saw that Spirit on her he threw up in his plate he vomited because of what he saw he's so shocked and so detested by it but people will look at that say oh look at her but it's a spirit projecting itself through someone and but we can't see it for what it really is what if we could see ought for what it really is Discord malice strife Envy it don't look like a Christian if we could really see it for what it really is we'd run a million miles if we could see unbelief really for what it is sin that that Spirit see if we could really see it for what it is man we would run a million miles and we'd realize I want nothing to do with it then if we want nothing to do with it why do we entertain it why do we make it feel welcome I think we should drive that thing out that ain't welcome here amen everyone's welcome the devil ain't welcome amen this this should be one of the places like your own home should be a sanctuary for the holy spirit of God am mean that God has feel so welcome there ain't any Strife malice trouble there cuz God's in in control amen same thing here don't get too crabbed up on me amen because we have no part in the devil the devil's got no part in US amen now brother brother Braham speaks about how uh well let's just read this from the church H book now he's speaking about the Book of Genesis and Revelation how it's always attack the devil hates to be exposed and in those books he's exposed for exactly what he is Jesus said about Satan he has no part in me I have no part in him the devil would like to prove that different but he cannot so he does all he can to destroy confidence in the word but when the church disbelieves Satan and believes the spirit's revelation of the word the Gates of Hell could not Prevail against her let me just put in a word here from my own Ministry if you don't mind we all uh you all know that this gift in my life is Supernatural it's a gift whereby the holy spirit's able to discern diseases and the thought of men's hearts and other hidden things that only God could know and then reveal to me I wish you could stand with me and see the faces of people when Satan knows he's going to be exposed why do the person's face change because the person thinks it's them but it's the devil right if we could realize this I think we would think a lot differently I think we would treat each other a lot differently I think we could act a whole bunch differently we realize hey this thing that's trying to to motivate my life is not me it's not my conscience it's not my memory it's not my understanding it's the enemy right that if Satan has got a hold of their lives through sin indifference and disease but you should see their faces Satan knows he's going to be exposed and the most peculiar change comes over the people's countenance Satan is afraid he knows that the spirit of God is about to let the people know of his works that's why he hates these meetings so much when names are called diseases revealed Satan hates it now what is this it's not mind reading it's not telepathy it's not witchcraft it's the Revelation by the holy ghost that is the only way I can know this of course the carnal mind will call it anything but the Holy Ghost this why the word is so important see the word should never just be over our heads it should come down right to our address where we're living to the battles of everyday life amen and this is why we need to look at these things because it should be our uh Mantra whatever you call it I have no I have no part in him he has no pardon me hallelujah amen now I'll tell you why Satan fights so much here so I'm just I'm just laying a bit of a foundation I will actually build a house this is the statue of the perfect man brother Bram taught it here from the um you this is from second Peter now we live in an age where is the Capstone of divine love himself comes upon the church right this is the age of divine love now you got to realize why why the devil fights brotherly kindness so much why he causes ought and fussing and fighting and not even Hardy welcomes and a God bless you anymore people people get to be in their Bonnet and they and they and they treat each other they won't even say hello to a to a fellow brother or sister because of something going on in their life he tries to he tries to destroy brotherly kindness because he knows if that's not their Divine love can't come upon people's lives amen because remember we've all got to be capped not just an age or not just a the bride but individuals we to be capped by Divine love himself amen the baptism of the true baptism of the Holy Ghost but brotherly kindness must be on display in order for that to happen this is why this is why this is why the devil brings in niggles and fusses and stews and all this kind of nonsense because he's trying to stop Divine love coming on people do you know how serious it is when we treat each other wrong when we just give an ugh and oh hello how are you doing not even a hearty God bless you and a and a welcome you're stopping Divine love coming on people this is Ser this is the devil trying to stop God living but we're here that God would live isn't that right so we should never get caught up who cares what people have done love them anyway I'm going to jump down to the end of my service right here then we'll come back am mean this oh wait oh wait I'm driving to it once it gets scary I mean this man on the right here Desmond Desmond T dos who's heard of Desmond T dos I mean he won he won uh you know the highest one of the highest um Awards in the American Military because as aican World War II he saved 75 men during the Battle of uh hacksaw Ridge on the um island of okona there against the Japanese now this man this man refused to uh carry a firearm into combat he refused because he was Seventh Day Adventist and he and he took the Ten Commandments very literally that and he said Thou shalt not kill so he enlisted but he refused I'm not going to fire a weapon I'm not going to kill anyone but I'll be a medic and he was ridiculed he was persecuted from basic training all the day to the end of his combat combat times we got to realize he he saved 75 men with a bow Bola knot going up this this this this Bluff here I think he's actually standing up there in the black and white photo exposed to um exposed to enemy fire doing far more than he could I mean I mean you know humanly just by himself but with that KN he saved 75 of those soldiers and I bet you a vast majority of them would have been making fun of him for not carrying a weapon they would have been you ridiculing him making fun of this guy oh look at this guy goody two shoes not all kind of hly than that Christian won't even join us in combat he's a coward all these things all these snide remarks would have been fired his way but he went beyond that amen he saved them he didn't care what they said to him what they did to him he was going to get them off the battlefield I mean get them back to safety where they could be treated now if a man you're saving people naturally could do this look Beyond what's being shot at him and save his fellow man how how much you and I amen by the baptism of the Holy Ghost who cares what snarks and what's niggles and nonsense and drama and who cares about drama smash the drama mask and let's just walk on with God Amen but if he could do that how much more you and I friends amen praise the Lord now that's why the Apostle Paul say endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace we're going to Endeavor to keep that Unity something you got to work at like a marriage you got to work at it right a relationship you got to work you got to put effort in energy thought time love emotion into it that's the same thing with keeping the unity of the spirit amen I pray if we're known for anything here that that that we love each other this is a this is a church of love divine love amen that's that's what I pray if we know more than anything else that that that people know these people have genuine Divine love amen praise the Lord but you see now the devil wants to get into human beings and do the opposite now we know as you as I said here there's a statue of the perfect man well in the book of uh in the Book of Proverbs there's the statue of the imperfect man both are religious these six things does the Lord hate yay seven are the Abomination unto him a proud look a lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood and heart that devises Mis uh Wicked imaginations feet that uh be Swift in The Run um sorry feet that be Swift in running to Mischief a false witness that speaketh lies and he that sth Discord among Brethren amen then you go down to uh chapter 26 he that hateth dissemble with his lips and layeth up deceit within him when he speaketh fear believe him not for there are seven Abominations in his heart whose hatred is covered by deceit his wickedness shall be showed before the whole congregation this can be among Believers but this is the devil making an imperfect man with these things but we have no part in him he has no part in US amen he this don't belong in our lives but he the devil wants to put it in and make us think it's us aren't you glad that these things don't belong in our lives at all praise the Lord I trust we hey we're just going to get through this okay amen now the problem with any of the devil's works is is people think as I said think that it's them or or it's not them yet okay now in the book of Acts in Acts chapter 8 when when um Philip goes down to Samaria and uh you know he you know he begins to preach the gospel to them and they get baptized and miracles are done there's one Simon the Sorcerer a great a great man among the people who thought that you know he was he was a man from God and did great things but he just he just Bewitched them with their sorceries but he received the word also and and and he became a Believer but then now he had and uh then what happened is when Peter and Peter and um John came down from from Jerusalem laid their hands upon them they received the Holy Ghost then Simon wanted to be able to do the same thing because his desire was to be a great person still you can get this through me it'll cost you but you can get this through me trying to be someone great among the people and then but then he uh but then he came to Peter and said you know give me um he he offered he offered him money that he could do this but then Peter said to him thy money perish because thou Hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money thou has neither part or lot in this matter this is how serious it is when you when you let the devil in and let him rule your life you actually have no part in the matters of God though sincere though wanting it you actually know have pardon it because your heart is not right amen and then and then so Peter would say you know repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray God if perhaps the thought of thine heart be forgiven thee for I perceive thou in the gall of bidness and in the bond of iniquity but then Simon um answered him and said pray ye to the Lord for me that none of these things which you have spoken come upon me he was already like this he didn't realize it he thought this is just how he was and this is him but it was the devil in his life ruling him we don't want to be like this okay we don't want to be like this now human Shields are are a real thing not just in the natural but in the spiritual people will will bear human shield for the devil either wittingly or unwittingly okay like like this woman here you can see the look in her eyes she's got a baby in her in her arms there's a guy using her as a human shield but you see now if we if we agree if we agree with the devil's thoughts we become a shield from to shoot from right I pray we could really God will just put a light over all of our Lives me very much included and if there's anything of the devil in me I'd say God take it out and shoot it take the Rascal out and get rid of him amen but the thing is if you can't differentiate the devil from yourself you'll always think it's you well you know like anything now remember people people Shield him without realizing it justifying see the devil Works in reasoning he will just ify he's a great salesman he'll he'll sell to you the reason why you should have ought or why you should be unforgiving and he'll give you all the evidence he'll give you all the and because you were there you know because you experienced it right and and and he will he will cause you to hold on to these things that he can shoot through your life see but you know but people say if you only experienced and knew what I did then you'd feel the way I think I mean I mean I mean then you you then you would feel like I'd feel then you would think the same way but if you've ever been with Jesus you think very differently amen he's the Cure All for all these things but you see when when whenever they uh whenever you put my in a in a in a statement about something negative you're being a shield you you're being a shield for it well it's my anxiety it ain't your anxiety it's the devil's anxiety he just sold it to you and you've just taken it on yourself or my anger my temper it ain't your temper that thing came from Satan is now and you get rid of it stop shielding it well my dad was like this my Grandad my grandma my auntie you should have seen my uncles that ain't your lot okay well it's my unforg I just can't forgive this person if Jesus could forgive you if Jesus could go to Calvary and you caused him to be M more than any other man the reason the nails were driven in his hands and feet was because of you you and if he could so freely forgive you why can't you forgive someone else oh but it's my my temper my sickness it ain't your sickness it ain't yours stop stop owning these things amen my shame it ain't your shame it's a devil's shame amen because remember every work of darkness is his work it ain't the believer's work it isn't the Son and Daughter of God's work it is the devil's works of my shame no let your shame be turned into a testimony when when people hold on to things it's a shame but when it's when it's because why because you're shielding it when you realize this is not me this is you Satan I want your head to come off and you let God take care of it it's no longer a shame but he makes you feel shameful cuz he wants you to hold on to it he makes you feel guilty and keep feeling guilty and you feel like you can't expose him and can't express it because he's trying to hold on to you that you'll be his shield I ain't the shield of I ain't a human shield for Satan I'm a temple of the Living God Hallelujah my resentment my grudge ain't your Grudge ain't your resentment you have no Parton that that has no part on you amen none of those things are rightfully yours oh but if you only knew my upbringing listen we were all born in a mess doesn't matter if you had the best mom and dad in the world the best idolic childhood in the world we were all born in a mess shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies sin ruled Our Lives we were a messed up broken people but God rich in Mercy did a work amen the blood of Jesus Christ heals restores renews transforms makes a new creature hallelujah amen I believe that that's right do you amen amen why cuz it's it's my freedom it's my Liberty amen it's my restoration it's my salvation it's my Redemption it's my Rapture it's my joyj Hallelujah it's mine those things definitely say it's yours but the devil's Works no it ain't yours cuz everything that God has is your part everything the devil has is not your part amen we got to realize see this woman you say well she feels she looks very trapped in that situation and and that's what the devil wants to do you're trapped if you confess that you're going to be it's going to be real bad for who not for you you're going to be free can you imagine the look on her face when that Gunman's gone or somehow she escapes him just be relief her baby's free she's free she's not trapped against a window and bullets flying at her and all these things and a and a musket being shot right over her shoulder deafening her and all these things see there's a problem we we get so worried what what the fallout's going to be I'll tell you what the Fallout is be you'll be free and the devil will be defeated that's good that's a good deal well people won't look at me the same I think they'll resp respect you more if you're spiritual you respect someone more who's actually confessed and forsaken his sin I'll say amen for you I appreciate a real man or woman that will face facts and face up to what the devil's done in their life and get rid of it amen I appreciate those kind of people anything we give to the Lord will be healed I believe it just like when Moses was at the burning bush God said put your hand in your bosom came out leprous put it back in his bosom came out well so everything every sin every leprosy you give to Lord he'll take to his bosom bring back restored hallelujah amen says in James submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he'll flee from you amen so if you know want to longer be a human shield resist the devil submit yourself to God how do you submit yourself to him submit yourself to his word Lord how should I think about my fellow man go look in the scripture by this you men shall know you are my disciples because you have loved one for another love covers a multitude of sin right all these kind of things that that's how you submit yourself to God submit yourself to the word of God resist the devil see the opposite to resist is I mean the opposite of resist is to receive CU if you're resisting there's a force pushing right if you if there's some resistance so if you want to get rid of a you if you want to get rid of a you the the enemy working in your life resist that thing you feel ought towards someone you say no I love that person they're part of the word they're my family amen we've been through some battles together we've got we've got experience together Hallelujah you begin to think no Satan I'm not buying you a lie about them amen they are a child of God no matter what they've done I did a lot of bad stuff but Jesus loved me and if he loveed me so much to save me forgive me and take all my sins away I can look at my brother or sister the same way hallelujah praise the Lord it says in Ephesians 2 you ha he quickened who were dead in trespass and sins in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power the a the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience we were all human Shields once upon a time we walked according to the prince of the power of the Year this is what we all did right but then it says but God rich in Mercy Hallelujah cuz he wanted to you to realize you have no part in Satan he has no part in you amen so so you once a human shield but then you realize hey this is not me this is sin this is the devil ruling my life and you what did you do you gave your life to the lord the devil got dethroned and Jesus came in now he's the king of glory in your life amen that you're not walking by the prince of the power of the air anymore but you're walking by the amen the Resurrected Lord Jesus amen the Holy Ghost himself praise the Lord you say well why do you know like brother Braham says when you got sealed in the devil got sealed out the only problem is you went out to him right how do you go out to him you begin to agree with what he's saying you got to look at your thought patterns and think where is this going to take me is it going to take me that I'm annoyed at someone I'm frustrated at someone I resent someone I can't stand someone who's that that ain't the Holy Ghost amen that ain't the Holy Ghost friends now forgot this here right Daniel and and and the three Hebrew children they they left Jerusalem in difficult circumstances the temple was B I mean you know they got captured they were taken away as slaves but they begin to realize you know because you think about walking from Israel to to um Babylon there it's a long way to walk and no doubt when they were leaving uh leaving Jerusalem they would have been reflecting a lot how come we ended up like this why why has why has God sure God prophesied it would happen but why did he allow it to happen to us and why are we in this mess and so what would have happened is well I believe that just me I like to color in the story a bit but they No Doubt because they knew the Bible they would have spoken about the failures of all the kings of the past and they begin to realize you know maybe Daniel would have said to his friends here listen we are Abraham's Covenant children we are we we are sons of Abraham God made a covenant with us amen we are we are in Covenant with God and friends if we can really just come to a conclusion the reason that we are in the state is because our Kings and our rulers and our forbears forgot that we have no part in What the world is doing around us and we should have no part in it they forgot that that's why they were worshiping you know the Kings before them and so on they're worshiping Idols because they forgot that they had no part in the world and the world had no part in them amen they you they they forgot this but Daniel and his friends purposed in their hearts that they were they were going to they were not going to defile themselves with the king's meat these are young people these are young people they realize no Babylon has no part in us and we have no part in Babylon sure we're going to work there we're going to live there we're going to serve the king we're going to do what we you know those kind of things but anything that comes to cross the word we have no part in it this is our line we're drawing FRS we're going to sink or drown whatever happens we don't know what's going to happen but but but Babylon has no part in us and we have no part in Babylon friends if they could stand without the Holy Ghost without the blood of Jesus Christ without a resurrection message without a church to go to without great singers and great musicians and great songs and preaching and all these things if they could stand just with that revelation we have no part in it there has no part in us how about us friends how about us amen how about us hallelujah remember we are of the world I mean we we are not of this world we're in the world but not of the world it has no part in us we have no part in it that's why we shouldn't be fear feeding off all these things on social media and so loving it social media in itself is not evil but what are we feeding on what are we wanting to become amen we should be very careful what what's motivating our life because if those things are motivating our life we need a different motivator amen we need the Holy Ghost to motivate Our Lives hallelujah amen so I'm just trying to find my bearings here amen so we are God's covenant people praise the Lord amen Daniel Daniel could stand there and say I'm not going to defile myself with these things this thing has no part in me none of the devil's Works have any part in me then said now as they were God's covenant people so we are the morning God has called us by his grace amen he was looking for us and he was searching for a people that would realize they came from God and they go back to God Amen this is this is what the message came to do to to make us realize we came from God and we're going back to God and everything in uh in the in between that's of the devil has no part in us and we have no part in it now when Abraham was called Abraham was separated from the world God called him amen God called him separated him unto himself to walk with God now he gave him the sign of circumcision to show that this is you know that that this is my Covenant with you I've separated you from the rest of the world now we have a far greater Covenant than a than a than a physical circumcision but our circumcision is by the baptism of the Holy Ghost because because God wants us to realize sure we were born lost we were born in sin we were we were led by the spirit of this world but when God comes in and makes a clearcut makes a division he wants us to know we have no Parton the world and and the world has no part in us the devil has no Parton me I have no Parton the devil amen that we would realize that our part is only in God praise God Amen so now when Jesus was on Calvary he says but God but uh God forsaw the bride and the groom Hallelujah see so to save his wife like Adam he had to go with her Adam knowed what he was doing Eve didn't know what she was doing but Adam walked out with his wife seeing Jesus took his wife's place and became sin for her remember he became you he stood your punishment that you might stand in his place he stood in your place that you might stand in his place what a love what a fellowship how can we deny it how can we do anything but love him friend he I could I could stand up for hours but let's move on a little further like the Pentecostal experience today and the coming of the Holy Ghost in This last days his promise is like the abstract to a title deed now you can get a title sure you can get a title to a place but that still don't say it's yours no sir somebody way back Yonder could come in and put a claim on it but when you get an abstract that shows that everything that's ever against it is struck off Plumb right back to the foundation is that right so there's a search that goes back and Strikes off every claim that that that anyone could put upon it that's why Abraham when he bought the ground for Sarah to be buried he made sure the boundary was set he made sure that there was a public witness this is the boundary of this cave um you know boundary around this cave this is mine um and and they wanted to give it to him he says no I'm going to buy it cuz he wanted to remove every single dispute against that piece of ground that where he buried his beloved bride was his amen and now we have a burying place as well amen in Christ amen and God made sure the devil had no claims on everyone that was buried in that burying place I mean that they would know that the devil has no part in them and the and and we have no part in the devil right amen so what does he do now when the Holy Ghost comes down he strikes off everything that was held against us amen and that gives you permission when you have that um um abstract that every bit of it belongs to you everything on it belongs to you amen and that gives us the abstract when the Holy Ghost comes upon this title deed that God saw back Yonder for the foundation of the world and put it name on The Book of Life it was born through a man and a woman and subject to sin and guilty of sin but when I believed on it I received the deed and when the Holy Ghost come it was the abstract that everything against me whether my mother done it my father done it my grandmother done done it I mean just doesn't matter what anyone done back in my lineage when the Holy Ghost came in it struck it all off Hallelujah so family curses have no part in me cuz they have no part in God am mean whatever traits from my family family Spirit has no part in me because it has no part in God I mean a national Spirit fussing and fighting and all these things has no part in me because it has no part in God hallelujah he says like the little epileptic child I prayed for a few minutes ago that come through the four come through from the grandparents epilepsy fell down upon the child I said but when the abstract had come it struck off I omitted everything I'm an abstract holder then amen and ass sure as the spirit that raised up Christ from the dead I have an abstract deed that I'm part of that body and with the abstract of the Holy Ghost making that body of the word live out just exactly like it did in him as he promised in the last days the abstract all my sins are struck out all your sins are struck out by the blood of Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost has come as an abstract to the title deed that God Gave Me by Grace by for knowledge oh my what are you scared about what are you scared about amen no wonder he said fair not I am he that was dead and alive again I am alive forever more and have the keys of hell and death don't worry about nothing even death ain't going to hurt you he says notice beautiful so we got to realize now everything's been struck off who did it God did it God struck off everything that was held against us doesn't matter how far back everything's gone Hallelujah and he puts it in the sea of his forgetfulness he puts a sign no fishing hallelujah amen so now if if God has struck off everything the devil could ever try and put Upon Our Lives we're to realize we have no part in him amen that's why this word has called us to a total separation to God is that we for us to realize that all niggles all fussing all fighting all ought feelings that's not from God Divine love should flow there should be such a Harmony in spite of what if oh but you don't know what's happened I know what God I know what happened on Calvary I know what happened when the Holy Ghost came into my life I know what happened I was there Hallelujah I know what so I know the full story actually Hallelujah why cuz that's the full story amen so if that's the case then why do we why do we lean to what the the enemy wants to put down our throats amen so I'm just trying to find something here just want to jump back to it why do we want to maintain paralyzed with a gossip Spirit shooting people through us oh I just love I just thrive on those things why don't thrive on the love of God why don't you thrive on Harmony and peace and love those are good things to thrive on jealousy is not you have no jealousy has no part in you malice Strife lust whatever it is those things have no part in you why why invite it in why stand paralyzed and say oh what am I going to do and I yeah I'm trapped by this thing I'm just a victim of circumstance why let it control you I just I just feel like I don't fit and I and I don't belong who's telling you that who's telling you that it ain't God God says come home come to the table you're part of me I want you to be I'm proud of you I bought you on Calvary you're mine come home amen I want to live in your life I want to be I want you to be my temple Hallelujah I don't want you to be a a a human shield for the Enemy No More come home oh but I'm justified in what I do yeah it's amazing how people use quotes and scriptures to justify being a human shield oh this is in my life to keep me humble who told you that I've heard such nonsense like that I think no don't try and put yourself with the Apostle Paul the Apostle Paul actually prayed and found out that thought In the Flesh and it wasn't sin as a thought in the flesh some people let sin rule their lives well this is this is this is to keep me humble no the thing that keeps you humble is the love of God in your heart shed abroad by the Holy Ghost that's what truly keeps a person humble amen that's what keeps a person thankful is is is God in their lives cuz when you really realize God you've separated me every part of me to yourself hallelujah how can you not be humble and thankful and appreciate what the Lord has done and love everybody Lord if you can find me HW me out of the pit I was in that my nature drove me into and you cut me out of it you took every part you washed me every part clean there's nothing there's not a single stain of it anymore Hallelujah can he do it for someone else praise the Lord amen so friends you know we got to realize we got to realize Church doesn't I'm I'm going to finish with this statement well maybe Church doesn't finish here church is not oh God's going to move in church today is it just here that happens what about what about when we have lunch what about when we see one another through the week that's church God can come down we're two or three together in my name there I am in the midst have family prayer you can have camp in your family prayer time Camp atmosphere can come down and change everyone's lives because he's God hallelujah so we got to we got to change maybe our mindset that oh when we have lunch that it's it's different remember Jesus is the same everywhere he was the same in the synagogue as he was in Mary and Martha's house but but Martha didn't realized that Jesus was doing the same work talking to Mary that he was in the synagogue healing someone and we should never see the devil wants us to try and interrupt what God wants to do how do you know that there's lunches going on maybe you're working maybe you're helping or whatever more and you see someone who's just having fellowship with a another part of the body and what you're seeing actually is Jesus ministering to Mary maybe a Eternal moment's going to take place in a conversation and the devil makes us all upset or makes us tries to make us upset thinking that's wrong like Martha was getting all huffy and puffy because of what was going on there but she didn't realize churches happening in their Lounge we need to look at life differently Friends Church is everywhere it ain't just oh God's going to move on a Sunday and a Wednesday what about during the week what about when we have lunch what about when we meet up see we can't say God's different or only God's in the in a four walls no God's in these four walls and he acts the same everywhere I trust so you got to realize that the devil's trying to get you to be a human shield of self-righteousness from to fire shots to try and stop God doing what he wants to do why don't we just take the devil out and just let him get killed today why don't we just say Lord these things are not me I actually Lord you purchased me on Calvary that I would have no part in any of the devil's nonsense remember Sin is Sin doesn't matter how big we call it we quantify sin it's all the same in God's eyes we have sin has no part in our lives we have no part in it oh but I'm in this flesh the Holy Ghost has come to take this guy under Dominion right the Lord Jesus wants us to have Victory now not just in the Millennium not just in a new body right now over every work of the devil so friends let's just stop stop owning this is mine and my situation and my problem and my anxiety and my fear and my sickness and my ought and my history and my problems and my family stop owning those things and swap the list I'm going to I can the musicians come I'm going to stop with this why can't it be my joy my peace my love my thankfulness my gratitude
