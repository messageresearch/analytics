[7:22] thank you
[7:27] praise the Lord
[7:29] I can feel and sits that we are in for a
[7:32] good time this morning
[7:34] I feel like there's anticipation and
[7:36] there's excitement in the air
[7:38] because we're going to meet with the
[7:40] King of Kings amen how are you all
[7:42] feeling you're feeling good feeling
[7:43] ready to praise the Lord
[7:44] amen it's the it's the greatest thing we
[7:47] can do is get into the presence of God
[7:49] amen that's where that's where
[7:51] everything starts and everything ends
[7:53] there
[7:54] all of Faith starts the all of the
[7:57] promises of God start there and all the
[7:59] doubt ends there
[8:01] it's a it's a great transitional place
[8:03] now if you ever go through a hard time
[8:04] you just get in the spirit of God and
[8:08] your circumstance might not change but
[8:09] everything else changes and it makes
[8:11] everything else that it makes the
[8:12] circumstance seem like just become
[8:14] smaller and smaller and smaller as you
[8:15] get into the presence of God and it
[8:17] gives you a peace that passes all
[8:19] understanding you can't understand how
[8:21] maybe an hour ago I was so burdened and
[8:23] worried about something and then an hour
[8:25] later it's all gone
[8:26] and yet the situation may still be even
[8:29] worse than what it was
[8:30] an hour ago and yet it's
[8:33] there's a piece that passes all
[8:35] understanding and I can't work it out
[8:37] but the Bible said it passes my
[8:38] understanding so I don't really try and
[8:39] work it out anyway but we're in for a
[8:42] great time in the Lord this morning
[8:45] um I want to say hi to my mother she's

[31:34] Steiner I stay with him yesterday last
[31:37] night so um a fantastic fellowship with
[31:41] them
[31:45] and this song um
[31:47] for quite some time I've been looking at
[31:49] the titles of is it coming up
[31:54] of Brother Bruno sermons and I thought I
[31:57] reckon I could put them into verse one
[31:58] day
[32:00] so um
[32:03] the more um common recognized sermon
[32:07] titles I've managed to put in diverse
[32:09] and I've I've brought it together with
[32:11] the chorus Kumbaya
[32:13] the reason I chose that apart from the
[32:15] fact that it fits but um
[32:18] I think it means you know can you hear
[32:21] or you yeah yeah
[32:23] and Jesus said
[32:25] um
[32:26] Terry you here at Jerusalem until you're
[32:29] from power from one eye
[32:31] and then when the vision came and the
[32:34] top was cut off the the mountain and um
[32:37] brother Brown said stay looking on this
[32:41] so um
[32:43] that's why I find Kumbaya
[32:46] it's very appropriate and you're most
[32:48] welcome to sing the verse with me

[49:54] let's turn to the Bible this morning
[49:56] we're going to go to uh Galatians 2 and
[49:59] 20 we're going to continue on with our
[50:01] um little thought on faith from
[50:03] Wednesday going to take a different
[50:04] direction though because um I just want
[50:06] to ask well I want to make a statement
[50:08] you know faith faith is a condition not
[50:11] an outcome
[50:13] all right
[50:14] it's a condition you're in not an
[50:16] outcome
[50:18] um because I because you know because I
[50:19] mean basically the whole sermon is
[50:21] how how's your stand when everything
[50:23] doesn't seem to go right when prayer is
[50:25] not answered where it seems like your
[50:27] life is going in the opposite direction
[50:28] do you just throw it all in and go on a
[50:30] drunk and a go into the world and
[50:32] whatever or do you just keep walking
[50:33] with God God bless you Kerry great to
[50:35] have you here God bless you my bro
[50:37] welcome amen good to see you good to see
[50:39] you amen so it's basically my whole
[50:40] sermon let's go have lunch amen but you
[50:42] know but but that's the question you
[50:43] know
[50:44] when it seems like nothing God is not
[50:47] answering nothing seems to be happening
[50:49] what's your stand
[50:51] because that's when faith is tested
[50:52] that's actually Faith amen so let's just
[50:55] read this here Galatians 2 and 20. I'm
[50:57] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[50:59] live yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[51:01] and the life which I now live in the
[51:03] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[51:05] God who loved me and gave himself for me
[51:09] amen then we're going to read from Job
[51:11] chapter 13. uh I love this just there's
[51:15] just uh on my mind if you know you know
[51:18] through the week because I was seeing
[51:19] how this you know works in the scripture
[51:21] side and things continue to open up but
[51:22] there's the last last bit that came
[51:24] though he slay me yet well trust him
[51:28] Hallelujah Glory I trust that's your
[51:30] confession amen
[51:32] amen here we go yeah praise the Lord
[51:34] okay so hold your peace let me alone
[51:36] this is job speaking that I may speak
[51:38] and let come on me what will
[51:41] Hallelujah he surrendered into the hands
[51:43] of God Amen wherefore do I take my flesh
[51:46] and my teeth and put my life in thine
[51:48] hand see well why should I why should I
[51:50] put my life in your hand that made he's
[51:52] talking to his uh his friends we say
[51:54] that a very you know anyway
[51:56] um though he slay me yet will I trust in
[51:59] him and but I will maintain my own ways
[52:01] before him he also shall be my salvation
[52:03] for an hypocrite shall not come before
[52:05] him amen so let's just bow heads in a
[52:07] word of prayer this morning amen
[52:09] gracious Heavenly Father we're so
[52:11] thankful we can come before your
[52:12] presence today Lord not by our abilities
[52:15] or anything we have done Lord but what
[52:16] but by what you have done Lord because
[52:19] what you have done that down Calvary
[52:20] that's what matters Lord Jesus so so
[52:23] thankful we can look by faith To You O
[52:25] God we're so thankful we can just relax
[52:27] in your presence oh God let off the
[52:28] pressure and praise you I pray dear God
[52:31] you'll anoint your word Lord as we've
[52:33] read your great Eternal Word Lord we
[52:35] know your word meets every condition and
[52:37] every age so I pray Lord may just come
[52:38] and speak to our hearts like only you
[52:40] can and may you raise is our faith May
[52:42] stabilize our faith Lord may you grant
[52:44] It For Your Glory May birth all those
[52:46] who are streaming this morning as well
[52:47] Lord May bless them and touch them oh
[52:49] God we love you so much you may meet
[52:51] every need Lord according to your riches
[52:53] and Glory we commit Our Lives into your
[52:55] hands May blood cover all of us oh God
[52:57] that only your spirit can operate in our
[52:59] midst Lord please may you grant it in
[53:02] Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless
[53:05] you friends you can have your seats this
[53:06] morning so that's the statement I want
[53:08] to make is that faith is a condition not
[53:10] a outcome
[53:12] because many people say well you know I
[53:14] prayed and I got faith and therefore
[53:16] everything's fine but what happens when
[53:17] it seems like prayer is not answered
[53:19] does that mean you have no faith you
[53:20] know because real Faith holds on to the
[53:23] word of God no matter what happens it's
[53:25] actually irrelevant on the answer Faith
[53:27] isn't based on God answering prayer amen
[53:30] because that means he's just an errand
[53:31] boy to you that means he's just well he
[53:33] does what you want so therefore you
[53:34] serve him now he actually in your mind
[53:36] he's serving you but if you serve him
[53:39] doesn't matter what comes what goes you
[53:41] love him anyhow see and that is real
[53:43] faith faith has got to be tested
[53:45] everything must be tested love true love
[53:48] is tested amen but it comes through as
[53:50] gold right faith has got to be tested
[53:52] everything must be tested the greatest
[53:54] militaries in the world have been tested
[53:56] the greatest generals have been tested
[53:58] and if they're really great generals
[54:00] they win the campaign right so so it's
[54:02] not those who just sit in the classroom
[54:03] and say well yes I'm the best and blah
[54:05] blah blah blah and theory and all those
[54:07] things it's when it's put into practice
[54:09] put into manifestation that's really
[54:12] proves you know what's what's going on
[54:14] or not now can I still drive cool I can
[54:16] still drive all right so you know it's
[54:18] amazing how you read through the book of
[54:20] Acts you know they here they are
[54:21] preaching here and they come to this
[54:23] place they come to Iconium and Antioch
[54:25] in different places and they're
[54:26] confirming the souls of the disciples
[54:28] and exhorting them to continue in the
[54:30] faith basically don't leave the faith
[54:31] you know it doesn't matter what happens
[54:32] stay in the faith of the word of God and
[54:35] that we must through much tribulation
[54:37] enter into the kingdom of God yeah I
[54:39] wonder I wonder how much you know these
[54:41] days do we really emphasize sure you
[54:43] become a new believer right amen the
[54:45] Lord saved you on Calvary you know he's
[54:47] washed you in your blood but now you've
[54:49] got great tribulations are going to come
[54:50] you know you've got to look at really
[54:51] the greatest battles come when you
[54:53] really meet the Lord you know when you
[54:54] look at the children of Israel when they
[54:56] went from Egypt into the promised land
[54:58] where were all their battles they had a
[55:00] few battles in the desert battles when
[55:01] they crossed Jordan enter the promises
[55:03] of God that's when the enemy came and
[55:05] actually the enemy found them in a lot
[55:07] of cases it wasn't them finding the
[55:08] enemy so amen so when so when trial
[55:11] after trial Comes Trouble after
[55:13] I mean you're actually walking in the
[55:15] right way hello you're actually on the
[55:17] right course praise the lord it's not
[55:19] actually the other way around because
[55:20] remember fear is not like a bug spray
[55:22] that keeps bugs away it's not a mozzie
[55:24] repellent right that keeps Devil's way
[55:26] faith is not that actually Faith brings
[55:27] trouble
[55:29] Hallelujah Faith brings tribulation
[55:32] praise God why because God wants to
[55:34] prove in your life that your faith is
[55:35] genuine amen that it's actually the real
[55:37] deal that you actually have the goods I
[55:39] mean so if Trouble Comes and you go on a
[55:42] drunk or go on drugs or go on the world
[55:43] or whatever just you know many people
[55:45] they say well you know people get bitter
[55:47] at God this day and age well I asked God
[55:49] this he didn't do it so I'm just not
[55:50] going to serve him anymore they never
[55:52] had Faith to begin with that's not real
[55:54] Faith they just wanted God to do
[55:56] something for their own selfish slaves
[55:57] no that's not Faith that's just people
[55:59] just say well well if he's really real
[56:01] God prove yourself and he made the you
[56:03] know people walk over Blades of grass
[56:05] they look at his spoken word that they
[56:07] live in amen God made the body that
[56:09] they're alive in and they say well God
[56:10] you really here prove yourself to me and
[56:12] it's creation speaks amen that that he
[56:15] is alive so through much tribulation
[56:17] we'll enter into the kingdom of God
[56:19] praise God the gospel is the same every
[56:21] every age doesn't matter how much
[56:23] technology and Comforts we have through
[56:25] Great Tribulation we're going to enter
[56:26] in amen but true Faith looks beyond the
[56:29] now and looks to the End Amen so I trust
[56:32] amen if you know if this is a quiet
[56:34] service it's fine I don't mind I've been
[56:36] enjoying this thought this week amen so
[56:39] you know so so we'll have tribulation
[56:40] amen we won't faith is not does not take
[56:43] trouble away it brings trouble but it
[56:46] overcomes the trouble
[56:47] amen see now Jesus would say these
[56:50] things have I spoken unto you that in me
[56:52] you might have peace in the world you
[56:54] shall have tribulation this is the these
[56:56] are the words of our Lord Jesus you're
[56:57] going to have tribulation in this world
[56:59] man's man's days of a few but full of
[57:02] trouble I think job said praise God but
[57:04] be of a good cheer for I've overcome the
[57:06] world Amen so you're you're going to
[57:08] have trouble you're going to have
[57:09] hardship you're going to have times
[57:10] where all you see in your bank account
[57:12] is zeros and if you have an overdraft
[57:14] there may be a negative before there but
[57:15] you know you'll have trouble in this
[57:17] world you'll have it seems like you know
[57:19] you'll be praying for something it seems
[57:20] like the answer doesn't seem to come but
[57:22] you know Faith worketh patience and that
[57:25] patience is patience with God
[57:27] Godly patience is patience with God that
[57:30] he will answer in his time now when I go
[57:32] through these things don't swing the
[57:34] opposite way and say what's the point of
[57:35] praying what's the point of seeking God
[57:36] no if you have faith you will seek him
[57:39] right if he if he'd become real to you
[57:41] seek him with over with your heart
[57:42] you're pressing the more trouble just
[57:45] drives you towards God Amen that's what
[57:47] it should do trouble should not drive us
[57:49] away from God if it does drive us away
[57:51] there's something wrong with our
[57:52] experience right but if we really know
[57:54] him trouble actually harnesses actually
[57:57] it's like God I mean brother bam said
[57:58] that it's like a bit in a bridle and a
[58:00] horse's mouth that actually stares us to
[58:02] a trouble stares us towards God
[58:04] Hallelujah and and you know if you're
[58:06] going through trouble you've actually
[58:07] found favor with God
[58:09] you know I you know you know you know
[58:11] the youth just sang I see the evidence
[58:13] of your goodness all over my life many
[58:15] times the world will take that while I'm
[58:16] blessed I got this big fancy car
[58:18] multi-room house and all these Blessings
[58:20] Now many times physical blessings were
[58:22] what we call blessings is not actually
[58:24] God's blessings no it just takes people
[58:26] just think it's you know this is an age
[58:27] of prosperity but you know you think
[58:29] about Jesus he was homeless yeah our
[58:31] Messiah was homeless he didn't have a
[58:33] big fancy house he didn't have a palace
[58:35] to live in he said a fox have dense
[58:37] birds have their nest son of manners
[58:38] nowhere to lay his head and and and this
[58:41] day and age Christians would look at him
[58:42] and say he's not good with his finances
[58:44] all right obviously he doesn't have the
[58:46] character he's not a good Steward you
[58:47] know the whole parable of the
[58:48] stewardship sure there's money involved
[58:50] but actually it's actually the gifts the
[58:52] talents in your life it's actually you
[58:54] it's actually what's in you it's not
[58:56] money because God is not good we're not
[58:58] going to stumble with a great white
[58:58] Throne judgment and then he's going to
[59:00] say well let's look at your bank account
[59:02] let's look at your Investments you know
[59:05] and okay well we're entering the joys of
[59:07] the Lord because you didn't know the
[59:08] gospel doesn't go forward by money the
[59:11] gospel goes forward by the by the
[59:13] anointing of the Holy Ghost as the
[59:14] spirit of God that packs the gospel look
[59:17] at the first church they had nothing but
[59:18] look what they did amen and yet we think
[59:21] we need a lot of money in the bank
[59:22] account to do any kind of mission no if
[59:24] God puts it on someone's heart then God
[59:26] will furnish the ability to do it I mean
[59:28] that's the main thing is the spirit of
[59:30] God that makes the gospel go forward
[59:31] amen so he's not going to give we don't
[59:34] have we won't give an account on how
[59:36] well we used our money sure we should be
[59:38] wise and all those things okay don't go
[59:40] don't go penduluming right now okay sure
[59:42] we must be wise with those things but
[59:44] God is not going to make us give an
[59:45] account on our finances how many houses
[59:47] we own our cars whatever more no it's
[59:50] the gift the talent in your life did you
[59:52] bury it because you're afraid of God or
[59:54] did you actually allow him to use the
[59:56] gift because we're all gifted people
[59:57] right we all have a gift we may not all
[59:59] be preachers or singers or musicians or
[1:00:01] whatever more but we all are gifted
[1:00:05] to let him let him amen draw dividends
[1:00:09] from what he's deposited in you
[1:00:13] here's job and here's his uh friends
[1:00:16] here they've come to accuse him
[1:00:17] basically you're a sinner and this is
[1:00:19] why trouble's gone on and you know but
[1:00:21] Joe Joe was job was a great man he
[1:00:24] didn't understand what was going on you
[1:00:26] know God does not give us a schedule for
[1:00:28] the day he doesn't give us a schedule
[1:00:30] for the year saying now in June this is
[1:00:33] going to happen and this one's going to
[1:00:34] break their leg and this trouble is
[1:00:35] going to come in and there's going to be
[1:00:37] this disagreement in the family and in
[1:00:39] the church and you know he doesn't do
[1:00:41] that because if we knew every day we
[1:00:43] wouldn't need Faith to walk through the
[1:00:45] day see Faith gives us the ability to
[1:00:48] walk
[1:00:48] to look Beyond right that's real Faith
[1:00:51] so job didn't job had didn't get a text
[1:00:54] on his phone saying from God listen I
[1:00:56] just had a testimony time with the devil
[1:00:58] and testified about you and you're a
[1:00:59] perfect man and this is what's going to
[1:01:01] happen to you Joe no job's living his
[1:01:03] little old life going on his Merry Old
[1:01:04] way and then he gets messenger after Mr
[1:01:07] came these ones died these people died
[1:01:09] by the way your children are all dead
[1:01:10] you know he lost everything apart from
[1:01:12] his wife but the thing is he says though
[1:01:14] he slay me yet I'll trust in him that
[1:01:17] was his testimony he didn't know where
[1:01:19] he was going to end up he didn't know
[1:01:20] God was going to restore double he had
[1:01:22] no idea the outcome of this trial was
[1:01:23] him he said though he slay me I'm going
[1:01:26] to trust him anyway and that is real
[1:01:28] Faith now this is a man under the blood
[1:01:30] of bulls and goats he had no he doesn't
[1:01:32] have the Holy Ghost amen he doesn't have
[1:01:34] the blood of Jesus Christ to cleanse him
[1:01:36] of his sins to change his nature he
[1:01:38] doesn't have thousands of years of
[1:01:39] testimonies and you know God living
[1:01:41] through people and things that he could
[1:01:43] draw from don't know if he had a bible
[1:01:44] to read to never treasure to go to I
[1:01:46] don't know but yet he said though he
[1:01:48] like me I'm going to trust him
[1:01:50] amen and to me this is overcoming Faith
[1:01:53] amen though everything goes terrible
[1:01:55] everything goes bad I'm trusting God I'm
[1:01:57] not going to become an unbeliever I'm
[1:01:59] not going to turn my back on God and try
[1:02:00] and ignore him because I'm upset with my
[1:02:02] little thing I'm going through I'm going
[1:02:04] to praise God anyway
[1:02:06] Hallelujah
[1:02:07] that's how we should be amen I I really
[1:02:10] believe that's how we should be
[1:02:12] Hallelujah
[1:02:13] praise God see so job
[1:02:16] was in this case see but he didn't he
[1:02:18] didn't know that God had testified to
[1:02:20] Satan that this is a perfect man there's
[1:02:22] none like him in all the Earth wouldn't
[1:02:23] you like your God to testify about you
[1:02:25] like that
[1:02:27] you see that one
[1:02:28] Satan I've got to point out one of my
[1:02:30] Jewels I'm proud of this one she's the
[1:02:33] best he's the greatest he's there's none
[1:02:35] like them in all the Earth actually
[1:02:37] Satan go through all of history there's
[1:02:38] been unlike them upon the Earth they're
[1:02:40] perfect why but why was job perfect
[1:02:42] because he had perfect faith in the
[1:02:44] blood of the Lamb that's what made him
[1:02:46] perfect it wasn't his wisdom wasn't as
[1:02:48] rich as wasn't his family wasn't those
[1:02:50] things because he had perfect faith in
[1:02:52] the blood of the Lamb because he had
[1:02:54] faith that what God had made required
[1:02:56] him to do he did in faith and it's the
[1:02:58] same thing what makes us perfect is not
[1:03:00] our ability it's not our tall or short
[1:03:02] or white or thin or whatever color we
[1:03:04] are it's none of those things it's not
[1:03:06] our personality it's because we're
[1:03:08] perfect faith in the blood of the Lamb
[1:03:10] got a natural lamb but the Lamb of God
[1:03:13] right that's what makes us perfect
[1:03:16] Hallelujah so therefore we should just
[1:03:18] say Satan look at my lamb stop looking
[1:03:20] at me you're looking at the wrong person
[1:03:22] Hallelujah
[1:03:24] praise God basically job didn't
[1:03:25] understand what was going on but he said
[1:03:27] though he slay me hey if I die praise
[1:03:29] God I'm still going to believe in him
[1:03:31] I'm not moving from my position
[1:03:34] amen CeCe we should have a stand and
[1:03:36] that's it I'm serving God no matter what
[1:03:38] happens I'm not going to go off on it
[1:03:40] see job didn't go off on some tantrum
[1:03:42] you know he didn't he didn't he didn't
[1:03:43] he didn't leave church he didn't quit
[1:03:45] being a Believer didn't quit Fellowship
[1:03:46] he didn't go into the world didn't do no
[1:03:48] he says I'm staying right here I don't
[1:03:51] understand what's going on this makes no
[1:03:53] sense to me but yet here I am this is
[1:03:56] how we should be
[1:03:57] that's real faith I'm talking about I'm
[1:03:59] talking about substance Faith that's
[1:04:01] unmovable it doesn't doesn't move with
[1:04:03] opinion or how you're feeling you're
[1:04:04] feeling happy praise God feeling down
[1:04:06] praise God feeling all mush in her heart
[1:04:08] whatever praise God anyhow family's
[1:04:11] doing good praise God family's not going
[1:04:13] good praise God finances are good praise
[1:04:15] God no finances praise God food on the
[1:04:17] table praise God no food praise God
[1:04:19] hallelujah no holiday praise God holiday
[1:04:21] praise God whatever it is praise God
[1:04:23] it's like a default setting of a
[1:04:25] Believer praise God none of these things
[1:04:27] will move me I'm gonna stay right here
[1:04:29] I'm being a Believer doesn't matter if
[1:04:31] he answers me or not you know I came to
[1:04:33] a conclusion years ago he's already done
[1:04:34] too much for me but we never do another
[1:04:37] thing for me in my entire life I'll
[1:04:39] praise Him anyhow because he's already
[1:04:40] done so much
[1:04:42] how long do you think of the Saints of
[1:04:43] the ages the things that God did for
[1:04:45] them maybe one or two things their whole
[1:04:47] life and God comes service after service
[1:04:49] day after day speaks to our hearts
[1:04:52] Paul's blessing upon blessing upon us
[1:04:54] answers prayer heals the sick amen saves
[1:04:57] the lust does incredible things time and
[1:04:59] time in this little room
[1:05:01] and they praised him for one thing and
[1:05:04] we get down to the dumps because you
[1:05:06] know
[1:05:07] help us Lord help us just to be here's
[1:05:10] our trajectory Hallelujah
[1:05:12] praise God see could you imagine job and
[1:05:14] Joan being broke out with boils all
[1:05:16] these things gone losing all his wealth
[1:05:18] and children everything it wasn't very
[1:05:20] easy but God was going to prove to Satan
[1:05:22] he had somebody he could put confidence
[1:05:24] in maybe he's trying to do the same
[1:05:26] thing in your case and the rest of you
[1:05:28] see he see God is trying to prove to
[1:05:31] Satan he's got confidence and see he had
[1:05:33] God had confidence in job
[1:05:36] right God did not set job up to fail God
[1:05:40] actually had confidence in Job that God
[1:05:42] is gonna that job is gonna though he has
[1:05:44] no idea what's going on this is the
[1:05:46] worst time of his life ever ever ever
[1:05:48] ever ever he's still going to say though
[1:05:50] he slam me yet I'll trust him right and
[1:05:53] see God has to have see every generation
[1:05:56] God has someone on the earth he has
[1:05:58] confidence in
[1:06:00] I try to say Lord I believe you got
[1:06:02] confidence in me
[1:06:03] Hallelujah sure he's got confidence in
[1:06:05] his salvation but remember we've got a
[1:06:06] free will what are we going to do if
[1:06:08] we're of real Faith we're going to stay
[1:06:10] there on the word of God
[1:06:11] Hallelujah
[1:06:13] see Oh They'll forsake you oh no job see
[1:06:15] he couldn't they couldn't make job do
[1:06:18] that no sir he oh he was only trying to
[1:06:20] prove them
[1:06:21] Hallelujah now
[1:06:25] see many times we forget who's in our
[1:06:28] boat
[1:06:28] see he said he'd never leave us nor
[1:06:30] forsake us and that's not just when he's
[1:06:32] talking that's when he's silent see many
[1:06:34] times God sometimes God will allow us to
[1:06:37] feel like he doesn't care like we're an
[1:06:39] orphan child that everyone's forsaken us
[1:06:41] but that's when faith is proven
[1:06:43] right because because you've got to
[1:06:45] realize Yo God you know it should be
[1:06:47] with us in the Lord basically Lord I'm
[1:06:49] on your hands
[1:06:50] I'm your problem I'm not going anywhere
[1:06:52] else I'm you you are in charge of me I
[1:06:56] am your responsibility Lord I'm not
[1:06:58] leaving I'm staying right here I'm gonna
[1:07:01] bother you I'm going to annoy you God
[1:07:03] here I am whatever comes whatever goes
[1:07:06] see that's your beat see that's faith
[1:07:07] faith is unmovable
[1:07:09] Hallelujah so you remember in a few
[1:07:10] minutes oh you you have little faith
[1:07:12] this is Jesus winning when he comes the
[1:07:14] storm when he's in the boat couldn't you
[1:07:16] understand about the breaking and the
[1:07:17] feeding of five thousand don't you know
[1:07:19] I'm the same Jehovah that fed them for
[1:07:21] 40 years out there in the wilderness out
[1:07:22] of ovens out of heaven when I poured it
[1:07:24] out every night what are you so scared
[1:07:26] about don't you know I dried up the Red
[1:07:28] Sea one day don't you know I opened up
[1:07:30] the Earth swallowed the unbeliever one
[1:07:32] day I measured the Earth and spurred it
[1:07:33] off out into space Yonder and he's in
[1:07:35] the ship now it's that's not mythical
[1:07:38] that's truth yes see isn't he great
[1:07:40] Jehovah God we could stand here for a
[1:07:42] while I'd run out of life and my body to
[1:07:44] go through everything God's ever done
[1:07:45] isn't he the same today is he the same
[1:07:48] God that saved you years ago isn't it
[1:07:51] the same God that provided back then
[1:07:52] he'll provide today as anyone that
[1:07:54] healed you when you were sick when you
[1:07:56] were troubled he gave you peace isn't he
[1:07:58] the same Jehovah God right now isn't he
[1:08:00] the same God or the prophet is here
[1:08:02] right now this morning the same one in
[1:08:04] the ship is the same one right here has
[1:08:06] he not proven himself over and over and
[1:08:08] over over again that he's faithful and
[1:08:10] true that he's more than able to keep
[1:08:12] his word has he proved himself he's he's
[1:08:15] God has overproved himself hey you know
[1:08:18] some people like some kids on the sports
[1:08:20] with that look at me dad I can do this
[1:08:21] and after the 50 millionth time I know
[1:08:24] you can do it Glory but God does that I
[1:08:27] want to prove myself to you it's not see
[1:08:29] he's not just satisfied with him being a
[1:08:31] god of the past to you no he wants to be
[1:08:33] God of the present to you see the same
[1:08:35] God that lived back there he wants to
[1:08:37] live in your life to prove himself to
[1:08:39] you he loves to prove his word amen he's
[1:08:41] not afraid of the challenge he comes
[1:08:43] against he is unconquerable
[1:08:45] Hallelujah he is undefeated he's the
[1:08:48] Undisputed champion of the world Amen by
[1:08:50] trust in your heart he is that to you
[1:08:52] hallelujah sister why are we so afraid
[1:08:55] about what are we getting scared about
[1:08:56] oh he's not answering my prayer how do
[1:08:58] you know he's not answering your prayers
[1:08:59] see many times we give God a list of
[1:09:02] this is how I want this answered Lord
[1:09:03] this would be so cool Lord if you did it
[1:09:05] X Y and Z and he just said no no no no
[1:09:08] I'm going to do it ABC see and then we
[1:09:11] oh God didn't hear my prayer yeah he did
[1:09:13] and he's working but our eyes need to be
[1:09:15] opened to see actually God answers
[1:09:17] according to his good pleasure not our
[1:09:20] good pleasure his good pleasure you see
[1:09:21] it's not see it's not Lord may my will
[1:09:24] be done in heaven and is it on Earth no
[1:09:27] it's Lord may your will be done in earth
[1:09:28] as it is in heaven right so that's how
[1:09:31] we should be it's not well God you
[1:09:32] didn't do it how I want therefore I'm
[1:09:33] going to quit no that's not Faith amen
[1:09:35] that's right
[1:09:36] amen see see same now he tries to prove
[1:09:39] us and see where we'll we will stand or
[1:09:42] not praise the Lord take a Revival away
[1:09:44] start an argument in the church just to
[1:09:47] see what you'll do turn Satan loose
[1:09:49] among you among you and see how you'll
[1:09:51] stand
[1:09:52] remember Satan has to ask permission
[1:09:54] from God before he can ever come near
[1:09:57] you see Satan had to ask God about job
[1:10:00] can I do this yes you can you can take
[1:10:03] his family do all these things don't
[1:10:04] just touch him and Satan couldn't go
[1:10:07] beyond those parameters of what God Said
[1:10:09] right and then next time Satan comes up
[1:10:11] well Satan said well the only reason he
[1:10:13] still loves you is because he's got his
[1:10:14] health so God said you can you just
[1:10:16] can't take his life so he went to the
[1:10:18] very Nth Degree
[1:10:19] but Satan could not go over the
[1:10:21] boundaries of what God had said him to
[1:10:24] do amen so we've got to realize when
[1:10:26] Trouble Comes In God gave permission for
[1:10:28] the trouble wow Hallelujah when sickness
[1:10:30] strikes God gave permission for the
[1:10:32] sickness wipers do you love God because
[1:10:34] you are just healthy
[1:10:35] or do you praise him when you're sick do
[1:10:37] you love him in the down times as well
[1:10:39] as the up
[1:10:40] Hallelujah because remember fruit life
[1:10:43] is not produced on the Mountaintop amen
[1:10:46] it's down in the valley where the
[1:10:47] Orchards and all the everything grows
[1:10:49] and there's a life and everything so
[1:10:51] it's in the hard times life Fruit is
[1:10:54] produced praise God for the hard times
[1:10:56] hallelujah amen see we just can't lose
[1:10:58] you can't lose being a Christian say
[1:11:00] this is not my kind of service well I
[1:11:02] think we need these kind of services you
[1:11:04] know because faith is tested Hallelujah
[1:11:08] I remember when I so and so an American
[1:11:10] Samoa this is years ago now I was
[1:11:12] working on a building site and when they
[1:11:14] pour concrete that that take two
[1:11:16] cylinders of that concrete and on day
[1:11:18] three and day something that put it in a
[1:11:20] pressure tester and it had to be above a
[1:11:22] certain pressure before it broke
[1:11:24] if it didn't I mean if it broke under
[1:11:26] that pressure then I mean I mean lower
[1:11:28] than the specified pressure they had to
[1:11:30] pull the concrete out and pour it again
[1:11:31] it's like Faith it's got to be tested
[1:11:34] yeah it's genuine yeah it's real faith
[1:11:37] and it's actually genuine Faith like our
[1:11:39] opening scripture says Paul said the
[1:11:41] life I now live I live by the faith of
[1:11:43] the Son of God so God's own faith comes
[1:11:45] into you by the baptism of the Holy
[1:11:47] Ghost it'll stand every test it'll stay
[1:11:49] you can't break it you can't crunch it
[1:11:52] you can't tear it it's indestructible
[1:11:55] Hallelujah so God will allow all these
[1:11:59] things to happen Mommy
[1:12:00] amen and it's why to prove our faith
[1:12:04] praise God hallelujah this is basically
[1:12:07] my whole sermon I'm just going to go
[1:12:08] over this time and time because you've
[1:12:09] got to look at your life say when
[1:12:10] trouble strikes what do I do do I turn
[1:12:13] to God do I praise him in the trouble or
[1:12:16] do I get down in the dumps and have a
[1:12:17] pity party
[1:12:18] what do I do do I become all shelled up
[1:12:21] and insular and ever it's all everyone's
[1:12:22] else's fault or do you love the Lord the
[1:12:24] same
[1:12:25] amen because God hasn't changed God is
[1:12:27] the unchanging God he doesn't change
[1:12:29] based on Seasons or weather or trouble
[1:12:31] or Prosperity no he's the same God Amen
[1:12:34] remember he loves us all the same see
[1:12:36] his love his love is not shown like a
[1:12:39] parent's love to a child her parents
[1:12:41] love to a child is is a love that tries
[1:12:43] to protect him from trouble
[1:12:45] right you know have you ever seen your
[1:12:47] kids out there saying get hurt today
[1:12:49] go break a leg go have some trouble have
[1:12:52] a hard day we love you
[1:12:54] no that's not appearance love you want
[1:12:56] to keep them from all those things do
[1:12:57] you know amen but God's love is not
[1:12:59] shown that way and people misunderstand
[1:13:01] us love his love is shown by election
[1:13:04] right Jacob have I loved any sort of our
[1:13:06] haters before they're both born he loved
[1:13:08] one and didn't love the other one his
[1:13:10] love is shown an election right so with
[1:13:13] it so he so you know he loves you
[1:13:15] because he elected you he predestinated
[1:13:18] you he called you he justified you right
[1:13:21] he's glorified you already that's how
[1:13:23] you know he loves you he'll allow you to
[1:13:25] go through trouble
[1:13:27] praise God because he wants to prove
[1:13:29] himself in the trouble
[1:13:31] right see We're Not Gonna what what are
[1:13:33] we gonna praise God about in glory
[1:13:36] be we're going to praise him because
[1:13:38] Lord
[1:13:39] that great trial in my life you brought
[1:13:42] me through the trial that great sickness
[1:13:44] in my family and my life you brought me
[1:13:45] through the sickness Lord in the silent
[1:13:48] times you were still God I can look back
[1:13:49] you will praise him because of those
[1:13:51] moments amen I was lost but then I was
[1:13:54] found so I praise you because now you're
[1:13:56] my savior right we will praise him out
[1:13:58] of experience right because testimonies
[1:14:01] are an experience you go through right
[1:14:03] but it's God's hand in the testimony
[1:14:05] that counts hallelujah amen that's what
[1:14:08] we'll Praise Him for we won't praise him
[1:14:10] out of theory
[1:14:11] well this is a good song let no every
[1:14:13] song we sing that means something is
[1:14:15] because we've been through what the song
[1:14:16] is singing Hallelujah
[1:14:19] praise the Lord
[1:14:21] Amen to heal to all these things now
[1:14:23] praise the Lord every son that comes to
[1:14:26] God must be chastened and corrected
[1:14:28] right we we don't have a flower bed of
[1:14:31] these people
[1:14:32] amen see and so it's a brother bam
[1:14:35] dramatizes speaking of adoption or that
[1:14:37] because adoption in the Bible is the
[1:14:38] placing of a son or a daughter in a
[1:14:40] position of power and authority in the
[1:14:42] family right that's what adoption is
[1:14:43] amen it's not taking someone who's not
[1:14:46] part of the family bring them into the
[1:14:47] family now you're part of the family no
[1:14:48] we are adopted or positionally placed in
[1:14:51] the body of Christ
[1:14:52] hallelujah praise God now look at this
[1:14:55] he says yep sure said the Holy Ghost I
[1:14:57] give him tests boy I tried him this way
[1:15:00] I tried him that way I throwed him down
[1:15:03] Sick I mean put him under I stopped him
[1:15:06] I let the devil do everything I could to
[1:15:08] him he'd just come right back up again
[1:15:10] he come just up the same see come up
[1:15:13] again this is Faith see yeah I mean
[1:15:16] there's all drum times but it's like
[1:15:17] look I let Satan against him I stomped
[1:15:19] him I allowed him to get sick he just
[1:15:21] bounced right back praise God anyhow
[1:15:23] hallelujah hallelujah how are you before
[1:15:25] the trial hallelujah how are you after
[1:15:27] the trial hallelujah hallelujah plus
[1:15:30] because I've been through the trailer
[1:15:31] amen I've got another verse on my song
[1:15:34] praise God hallelujah
[1:15:36] amen now no one likes trials I mean
[1:15:38] let's be honest you know we don't love
[1:15:40] no one likes well some people like pain
[1:15:42] but they need prayer I think you know
[1:15:44] but people in their rational mind do not
[1:15:47] like pain no one lines up for pain oh
[1:15:50] yeah good yeah break my arm oh well
[1:15:51] that's one no no one signs up for that
[1:15:53] stuff rationally right but you see
[1:15:56] trials are good for us because it brings
[1:15:58] us forth as gold that brings us forth as
[1:16:01] deity amen that's what gold represents
[1:16:03] hallelujah amen just like many of the
[1:16:05] things in the Tabernacle in the
[1:16:07] wilderness they were covered with beaten
[1:16:08] gold
[1:16:09] amen so it's not just Christ as was
[1:16:12] beaten he was bruised you know all those
[1:16:13] things but also represents us as well
[1:16:15] yeah oh amen why we we're actually in a
[1:16:18] veil of humiliation this body amens
[1:16:21] regard to mold and shape us into His
[1:16:23] Image see the Way Up Is Down
[1:16:26] see the way up is not Prosperity
[1:16:28] everything goes fine no the way up is
[1:16:31] through trials and hardship and
[1:16:32] tribulation but God if you have real
[1:16:35] faith will take you through them all
[1:16:36] amen you say well I failed in a lot of
[1:16:39] Trials that's fine get back up
[1:16:40] you know well I actually had a pity
[1:16:42] party the other week that's fine just
[1:16:43] get back up amen say Lord I'm still on
[1:16:45] your hands I'm still walking forward
[1:16:47] sure I failed you many times but
[1:16:49] remember a champion doesn't stay down a
[1:16:51] champion gets back up amen so though man
[1:16:53] the Bible says Falls many times as him
[1:16:55] that gets back up you want to be an
[1:16:57] overcomer just get up I mean the devil
[1:17:00] knocks you down get up even your own
[1:17:02] Humanity you actually so annoyed at your
[1:17:04] own self just get back up say Lord I'm
[1:17:06] walking on I'm not staying in the dust
[1:17:07] I'm getting up Hallelujah
[1:17:10] praise the Lord amen I made him sick I'd
[1:17:13] done this I throwed him in the hospital
[1:17:14] took him out here I've done this I've
[1:17:16] done that I turned his wife against him
[1:17:18] I turned his neighbor against him I
[1:17:20] turned everything that didn't make a bit
[1:17:22] of difference said though he slay me yet
[1:17:24] I'll trust him I killed his family I
[1:17:26] took this I did this I'd done this I did
[1:17:28] all this other still he stood right up
[1:17:30] though he slay me and I'll serve him
[1:17:32] he's mine hell is he see this should be
[1:17:35] an attitude though hardship after trial
[1:17:37] after bad times come we're not leaving
[1:17:39] I'm not leaving the word Lord I'm not
[1:17:41] leaving you I'm on your hands amen you
[1:17:43] turn around God I'm still there I mean
[1:17:46] you try and walk away from me I'm still
[1:17:47] there Lord I'm following you whatever's
[1:17:49] going on in life Lord I'm walking with
[1:17:51] you all the way Hallelujah that's real
[1:17:54] faith Hallelujah yes like you see like
[1:17:57] some kind of superhero and a sidekick
[1:17:59] the sidekick is a real psychic is always
[1:18:01] there
[1:18:02] God's more than a superhero and we're
[1:18:04] more than Sidekicks right but we should
[1:18:06] be wherever he is there I am
[1:18:08] oh it's you again yep Lord here I am
[1:18:10] what are we doing today praise God you
[1:18:13] can't get rid of me though whatever
[1:18:14] Trouble Comes see that's real faith
[1:18:16] how's your faith today
[1:18:18] Hallelujah am I looking a bunch of
[1:18:21] Overcomers today
[1:18:22] Hallelujah
[1:18:24] but you see faith is not faith
[1:18:27] throws it in
[1:18:29] see we've got to come to a place and
[1:18:30] everyone I believe will where you go
[1:18:32] through a trial and you want to quit but
[1:18:34] you can't quit you go through a hard
[1:18:37] spot in life you think I'm just going to
[1:18:38] throw it all away I'm just going to hit
[1:18:40] the demolition button let the whole
[1:18:42] thing blow up and I'm just walking away
[1:18:43] but there's something in you that just
[1:18:45] can't do it I mean you
[1:18:47] what is that that is Faith and you
[1:18:49] realize it's not you holding on to God
[1:18:51] there's actually God holding on to you
[1:18:52] oh look at now that's real overcoming
[1:18:55] when you realize when you think man this
[1:18:57] this is not worth it I've wasted my time
[1:18:59] God's not real he doesn't care about me
[1:19:00] I'm just going to throw it all in and
[1:19:02] you can't
[1:19:03] you want to say it I Quit I'm done see
[1:19:06] you bye but it's like the word just
[1:19:08] can't get out what is that that's Faith
[1:19:10] saying you can't do that
[1:19:11] because it's not us holding on to God
[1:19:13] see it's not us oh Lord I've got to hold
[1:19:15] on to another day and give me strength
[1:19:16] to hold on to you no no it's God holding
[1:19:18] on to us
[1:19:20] it's God that keeps us in the hard times
[1:19:22] as God that keeps us in the good times
[1:19:24] God keeps us through trouble God it's
[1:19:26] God see we won't see there'll be nothing
[1:19:29] that we can boast in on that day
[1:19:31] remember salvation is by grace alone not
[1:19:35] by works list any man should boast
[1:19:36] there'd be no actually part of us that
[1:19:37] says look what I did God
[1:19:40] look what you did God that's my life
[1:19:43] that's what's going to be praise the
[1:19:44] Lord
[1:19:45] Hallelujah
[1:19:47] when you've done all you can do when
[1:19:49] you've come through the prayer line and
[1:19:51] been prayed for your heart doesn't
[1:19:52] condemn you you're living right with God
[1:19:54] just hold on to it God has to answer
[1:19:56] he's testing you if you turn loose the
[1:19:58] next morning say well I'm no better I
[1:20:00] guess there's nothing to it then you
[1:20:01] didn't have faith to begin with see
[1:20:04] Faith holds on even though the answer is
[1:20:06] not there it seems but Faith worketh
[1:20:09] patience patience with who with God
[1:20:12] amen so you know you've got faith if
[1:20:14] you've got patience amen
[1:20:15] right that's real that's that's the
[1:20:17] proof you have faith
[1:20:18] see this is an instant world
[1:20:21] all the answers are instant you can get
[1:20:23] every answer whatever Touch of a button
[1:20:25] but God hasn't changed just because
[1:20:26] technology just poured it out right so
[1:20:29] if you've got real Faith then you have
[1:20:32] real patience
[1:20:33] and it doesn't upset you
[1:20:37] you don't get mad at God it's never his
[1:20:39] fault
[1:20:40] that's one thing that's not in a
[1:20:42] Christian's vocabulary is it's God's
[1:20:44] fault
[1:20:45] this is the reason I'm in this state is
[1:20:47] because he did X Y no it's never God's
[1:20:50] fault
[1:20:51] and if you're seeing it that way you're
[1:20:53] not looking through eyes of Faith you
[1:20:54] need to readjust your
[1:20:56] glasses or your binoculars refocus on
[1:20:59] the word
[1:21:00] or all your contacts or whatever it is
[1:21:02] you just got to refocus actually saying
[1:21:04] Lord you've allowed this because you
[1:21:05] want to show yourself in this Hallelujah
[1:21:08] maybe because what faith always looks
[1:21:10] for God on every hand
[1:21:12] praise the Lord see if you've got real
[1:21:14] faith you'll hold on to the last breath
[1:21:15] has gone from your body you're certain
[1:21:17] that God is God for he that cometh the
[1:21:19] God must believe that he is and a
[1:21:21] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[1:21:23] him Hallelujah
[1:21:25] now brother Brown would tell a story of
[1:21:27] a woman she was married to a colonel or
[1:21:30] something in the military and and they
[1:21:31] were stationed in Germany they had a
[1:21:33] little baby and the baby was sick and
[1:21:35] was going to die and actually died and
[1:21:36] they were Believers and they actually um
[1:21:38] called for brother Brown to be flown
[1:21:39] over to Germany to um to to to pray for
[1:21:43] the baby because they'd seen him do
[1:21:44] Mighty things I think I think the father
[1:21:46] of the child was um Julia stanscliffe
[1:21:48] that wrote the book prophet of South
[1:21:49] Africa I might be wrong but you know but
[1:21:51] they'd seen God do many things
[1:21:53] and they asked and the military is
[1:21:55] actually going to fly brother Byron from
[1:21:56] America to Germany to to to pray for the
[1:21:59] baby and brother Brown went to pray
[1:22:01] before he got on the plane and the Lord
[1:22:02] said no this is my hand
[1:22:04] this is my hand and so now the parents
[1:22:07] of course are naturally upset here's
[1:22:09] your baby and now your baby's dead and
[1:22:11] you're believing it's going to be raised
[1:22:12] right real Believers believe for
[1:22:14] anything
[1:22:15] amen we don't limit God for nothing
[1:22:17] right but then there came to a point
[1:22:19] where later they came back to America
[1:22:21] and they met up and so there's now the
[1:22:23] mother saying and now when she came over
[1:22:24] to see us that night left her at the
[1:22:26] house when I left yesterday she said
[1:22:28] what was it brother bear my weakness of
[1:22:30] Faith see this is what always comes
[1:22:31] through our minds if it seems that
[1:22:33] prayer is not answered my faith wasn't
[1:22:34] strong enough to get the promise
[1:22:39] not necessarily it's God is answering a
[1:22:42] different way
[1:22:43] see faith will receive whatever answer
[1:22:45] God gives
[1:22:46] amen sure we we believe for Supernatural
[1:22:49] healings do we not we've seen them amen
[1:22:51] We Believe for God to do the miraculous
[1:22:52] we've seen it many times it means I'm
[1:22:54] not saying don't think I'm preaching
[1:22:56] unbelief this morning I'm trying to
[1:22:57] preach a stability into our lives that
[1:23:00] no matter how God answers if he does or
[1:23:02] not we still believe and we don't we
[1:23:04] don't get disheartened we don't get
[1:23:06] discouraged but we keep pressing the
[1:23:07] battle anyway amen so she being thinking
[1:23:10] what was the week was it the weakness of
[1:23:12] my faith and now my brother said no you
[1:23:15] have great faith
[1:23:16] so many times we think well God didn't
[1:23:18] answer therefore I didn't have the faith
[1:23:19] for the answer no if you have the Holy
[1:23:21] Ghost you're full of faith
[1:23:22] because you're full of God Amen right
[1:23:25] Hallelujah you have great faith you
[1:23:27] prayed for your baby you and your
[1:23:28] husband held on to it God to raise that
[1:23:31] baby and he refused to do it because he
[1:23:34] knowed what's best and still you love
[1:23:36] him
[1:23:37] see that is that's real Faith though the
[1:23:40] answer may be contrary to what you want
[1:23:42] you still love him anyhow you don't get
[1:23:44] mad you don't build up a complex against
[1:23:46] God don't build up a grudge don't get
[1:23:48] resentful you love him anyhow see David
[1:23:51] would be in prayer for his son that he
[1:23:53] had with Bathsheba the child was going
[1:23:55] to die right and he was fasting and
[1:23:57] praying and seeking God but then when
[1:23:59] the word came that the baby died what
[1:24:01] did he do he washed himself changed his
[1:24:03] clothes went into the temple and praised
[1:24:05] God anyhow see that was real Faith
[1:24:08] Hallelujah
[1:24:10] praise God anybody when mountains are
[1:24:12] moving and things can have faith amen
[1:24:15] see see it's very easy to have faith
[1:24:17] when we're in a camp kind of service and
[1:24:19] God's moving empowering people's lives
[1:24:21] are being touched it's easy to believe
[1:24:23] in that kind of an atmosphere but what
[1:24:24] about when that atmosphere is not there
[1:24:26] what about when we're going through
[1:24:27] day-to-day life and there's troubles and
[1:24:29] hardship and it seems like Lord where's
[1:24:31] the answer to this
[1:24:33] right because that's when faith is
[1:24:35] proven amen but let it go backwards one
[1:24:37] time and see how it works that's when
[1:24:39] you can prove whether you've got faith
[1:24:40] or not I mean so if things are going
[1:24:42] backwards do you still believe anyhow do
[1:24:45] you still love him anyhow do you worship
[1:24:46] Him anyhow see that's real faith
[1:24:50] praise the Lord
[1:24:51] Hallelujah see faith is a state of being
[1:24:53] not an outcome
[1:24:55] let's say in Hebrews chapter 11 but
[1:24:57] these all died in faith speaking of The
[1:24:59] Heroes of Faith they died in faith see
[1:25:02] it's having it having faith did not
[1:25:05] dictate their outcome
[1:25:07] amen you look at a lot of the Believers
[1:25:09] Through the Bible they didn't have a
[1:25:11] Victorious well what we would call a
[1:25:13] full of Faith outcome
[1:25:15] they got sick they were destitute
[1:25:17] tormented Afflicted of whom the world is
[1:25:19] not worthy but they all died in faith
[1:25:21] why because God revealed himself to them
[1:25:23] because remember faith is a revelation
[1:25:25] it's not something you work out it's not
[1:25:27] something that you put one plus one
[1:25:29] equals two no it's God reveals the word
[1:25:32] is true to you and then you act on that
[1:25:33] word and that is Faith it's not
[1:25:35] something you try and stimulate
[1:25:38] amen whether you say what's the point of
[1:25:39] praying and singing and things it's to
[1:25:41] create an atmosphere of faith for God to
[1:25:43] anoint your faith and make the word come
[1:25:45] to pass that's why you seek Him do you
[1:25:47] not see mentally you can read a promise
[1:25:49] in the Bible but when you want that
[1:25:51] promise to be confirmed whether you seek
[1:25:53] the Lord in prayer about that scripture
[1:25:54] and he anointed to you and it becomes a
[1:25:57] revelation it goes from a nice idea to a
[1:26:00] revelation when it's a revelation you
[1:26:02] know that it's done
[1:26:03] you may not see the outcome you may not
[1:26:06] know when but you know it's done you can
[1:26:07] rest in it and you go from seeking God
[1:26:09] for it to happen to praising God it's
[1:26:11] happened
[1:26:12] Hallelujah but if it's just in your mind
[1:26:14] you think well I think this will work I
[1:26:16] hope this is going to happen yes this is
[1:26:18] going to happen because I've worked this
[1:26:19] out that's not Faith that's just a
[1:26:20] mental idea we need the word to Anchor
[1:26:23] and to hear amen by Revelation see these
[1:26:26] all
[1:26:27] died in faith not having received the
[1:26:29] promises but seeing them are far off
[1:26:31] were persuaded of them and embrace him
[1:26:33] confess that they were strangers and
[1:26:34] pilgrims on the earth they for they that
[1:26:38] say such things plainly declare that
[1:26:40] they seek a country and truly if they
[1:26:41] had been mindful of that country from
[1:26:43] which they came out they might have had
[1:26:45] opportunity to have returned see someone
[1:26:46] who's really received faith
[1:26:48] their old life is gone
[1:26:50] it's dead
[1:26:52] they can't go back the bridges have been
[1:26:54] blown up there's no Crossing back
[1:26:56] there's no u-turn right but they say
[1:26:59] they're plainly seeking a country and
[1:27:01] that country is a Heavenly land
[1:27:03] amen see see but now they desire a
[1:27:05] better country that is and Heavenly
[1:27:07] wherefore God is not ashamed to be
[1:27:09] called their God for he hath prepared
[1:27:11] for them a city see real Faith looks
[1:27:13] beyond this life and says I know where
[1:27:15] I'm going I mean you've heard from your
[1:27:17] theophany amen you've heard from your
[1:27:19] Eternal Body you know you have one
[1:27:20] waiting in the heavens already like the
[1:27:22] Apostle Paul said that's what faith
[1:27:25] declares and if you've had a revelation
[1:27:27] that that is so Glory what does it
[1:27:29] matter if life has gone good or bad or
[1:27:31] indifferent what really is the Troubles
[1:27:33] of Life compared to that what you
[1:27:36] already have over there
[1:27:37] see it should give us such a stability
[1:27:39] if God has called you by his word he
[1:27:41] didn't call you to leave you remember
[1:27:43] this message is an individual call to
[1:27:45] the marriage supper of the Lamb right of
[1:27:48] and and if the word is quickened into
[1:27:49] your heart the reason that has happened
[1:27:51] is because you have a place at the table
[1:27:53] Glory Hallelujah I mean can't we just
[1:27:56] Rejoice then you're there I have a place
[1:27:58] I don't know what my name what because I
[1:28:00] don't think we'll speak English in
[1:28:01] heaven
[1:28:02] and we all say praise God
[1:28:05] but whatever my name is written there
[1:28:07] but I have a place setting that's mine
[1:28:10] Hallelujah and I know it's there because
[1:28:12] I've heard from it
[1:28:14] Glory so what really matters sure we'll
[1:28:16] get stressed and worried and troubled
[1:28:17] that's why David's will say when my
[1:28:19] heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock
[1:28:21] that is higher than I because God knows
[1:28:24] we're still these in these frail bodies
[1:28:26] he knows we'll get times when we'll feel
[1:28:28] overwhelmed that's normal if you don't
[1:28:30] feel overwhelmed in Life or trouble any
[1:28:32] kind of emotion there's something wrong
[1:28:33] with you you've become detached from
[1:28:35] your emotions and that's very very
[1:28:37] unhealthy you need to be connected you
[1:28:39] need to feel you know your heart is not
[1:28:41] just a muscle that pumps blood it's your
[1:28:42] seat of your emotions right you should
[1:28:44] be in touch with your spirit
[1:28:46] come on you should be able to feel happy
[1:28:48] you should be able to feel sad you
[1:28:49] should be able to feel worried love all
[1:28:52] the range of emotions but with hatred
[1:28:54] only against the devil
[1:29:01] you know what I mean but but we
[1:29:03] shouldn't be see but David's here when
[1:29:06] my heart is over well and Lead Me To The
[1:29:07] Rock that's higher than I what is that
[1:29:09] rock God is our Rock he's that rock of
[1:29:12] Revelation so when you feel all
[1:29:13] overwhelmed you say Lord lead me to the
[1:29:16] rocks and Lead Me To My Testimony lead
[1:29:18] me to you what you've done in my life in
[1:29:20] the past and what does that do it
[1:29:22] actually makes us feel less overwhelmed
[1:29:23] yeah I mean because we say God to
[1:29:25] deliver there he's faithful and true
[1:29:27] back then he's faithful and true now he
[1:29:28] delivered me there he delivered me here
[1:29:30] he answered me there he'll answer me
[1:29:31] here how he does it that's up to him the
[1:29:34] details the problem the you know the
[1:29:35] details is his left but he is faithful
[1:29:38] and true there he cannot change his
[1:29:40] faithful and true here what happens then
[1:29:41] we start we the the overwhelmingness of
[1:29:44] situations go down praise God aren't you
[1:29:46] glad we have a rock
[1:29:48] you can go to go don't go to yourself
[1:29:50] help books go to your rock
[1:29:52] Hallelujah
[1:29:54] now many times Well actually 100 of the
[1:29:57] time our Christian walk we would never
[1:30:00] ever imagine it would go the way it's
[1:30:01] gone or is going right if you yeah
[1:30:04] that's what we should do maybe someone
[1:30:06] comes meets the Lord now write down what
[1:30:08] you think you're Christian what gonna be
[1:30:10] and then five years later read it you
[1:30:12] say I'm so wrong I should have just put
[1:30:15] the opposite just thinking you know but
[1:30:17] many times we have a have an idea how
[1:30:20] things are going to happen
[1:30:21] now John the Baptist Jesus Jesus gave
[1:30:24] him the greatest compliment after this
[1:30:27] but then John gave him the actually the
[1:30:29] probably the worst kind of uh
[1:30:32] uh attitude towards them that you could
[1:30:34] give anyone see John was ordained to to
[1:30:37] introduce the Messiah right but then he
[1:30:39] got to a pla but he never thought no
[1:30:41] doubt in his life that he would end up
[1:30:43] like this
[1:30:45] he had he would never have fathomed in
[1:30:48] his wildest nightmares that a little
[1:30:50] girl would dance at a feast and that
[1:30:51] would cause his head to be taken off her
[1:30:53] shoulders and he'd be in prison you see
[1:30:55] but many times life can end up this way
[1:30:58] but was God displeased with John
[1:31:01] did John do anything wrong did he did he
[1:31:04] introduce the wrong Messiah did he get
[1:31:05] caught up in the scribes and the
[1:31:07] Pharisees and the religious movement of
[1:31:08] the day no he stood true to his calling
[1:31:11] right he stood true to his calling but
[1:31:13] you see his life got to a point he
[1:31:16] actually said I'm he must increase speak
[1:31:17] of the Messiah and I must decrease he
[1:31:19] didn't realize this was the decrease
[1:31:21] this was actually what he you know and
[1:31:23] so there he is he's in prison
[1:31:25] and then brother Brahms his eagle eyes
[1:31:27] begin to film over
[1:31:29] why because he doesn't understand what's
[1:31:31] going on and how often we can get to a
[1:31:34] position like this
[1:31:35] but then now
[1:31:37] you see and it came to pass that when
[1:31:39] Jesus had made an end to commanding his
[1:31:41] twelve disciples he departed things to
[1:31:42] teach and to preach in their cities now
[1:31:44] when John had heard in the prison The
[1:31:46] Works of Christ he sent two of his
[1:31:47] disciples and he said unto him art thou
[1:31:50] he that should come or do we look for
[1:31:51] another
[1:31:52] what up what a thing you think it wasn't
[1:31:54] that long before this there was John
[1:31:56] saying Behold the Lamb of God that takes
[1:31:58] away the sin of the world and he was
[1:31:59] double sure he was the Messiah right and
[1:32:02] then God came down your incredible the
[1:32:04] the whole purpose of his life upon the
[1:32:06] Earth had been manifested because he
[1:32:08] introduced the Messiah to the people
[1:32:11] but then he got put in prison and now
[1:32:13] he's asking this question did I really
[1:32:15] do what I was called to do
[1:32:17] see situations can begin to Cloud over
[1:32:20] our mind
[1:32:22] Jesus answered said unto them go and
[1:32:24] show John again those things which ye do
[1:32:26] hear and see the blind received their
[1:32:28] sight the lame walk the lepers that
[1:32:30] cleans the deaf here the dead are raised
[1:32:31] up and the poor have the gospel preach
[1:32:33] to them and blessed is he whosoever
[1:32:36] shall not be offended in me
[1:32:38] so John you're blessed if you're not
[1:32:41] offended because you ended up here yeah
[1:32:46] yeah see we should not get offended that
[1:32:48] our Christian walk takes us into some
[1:32:49] dark prison sometimes
[1:32:52] see it wasn't it wasn't because God
[1:32:54] wasn't punishing John he wasn't
[1:32:56] displeased with John he said there's
[1:32:59] actually no greater man born of a woman
[1:33:01] than John the Baptist he said he said
[1:33:03] he's actually greater than all the
[1:33:04] prophets of the Old Testament as John
[1:33:06] why because John was the breach between
[1:33:07] the Old Testament and the new amen
[1:33:10] because after John what happened the
[1:33:11] kingdom of God was going to be preached
[1:33:13] and people were going to be born into
[1:33:14] the kingdom by the Holy Ghost which
[1:33:16] never happened in the Old Testament
[1:33:17] under the blood of bulls and goats see
[1:33:19] so John was in this position and Jesus
[1:33:21] gave him the greatest compliment that
[1:33:23] that God could ever give her believer
[1:33:26] he said there's not he said look you've
[1:33:28] got your you've got Moses Elijah all the
[1:33:31] ones the other in the Old Testament this
[1:33:32] man's greater than the more you see but
[1:33:35] John was stuck in prison saying this is
[1:33:38] not right what is going on see we should
[1:33:40] not be offended that last verse there we
[1:33:43] should never get offended at God because
[1:33:45] life seems to be going through a certain
[1:33:47] way
[1:33:48] no God wants to prove himself and you
[1:33:51] think about it
[1:33:52] if you came to a point in your life you
[1:33:54] realize my mission on Earth is done
[1:33:56] what God has sent me to fulfill has been
[1:33:59] fulfilled when you just raise your hand
[1:34:00] and say thank you Jesus thank you Lord
[1:34:02] that you allowed me to be surrendered to
[1:34:05] your word that my part of the book has
[1:34:08] been manifested that you don't have to
[1:34:10] push me and pull me and throw me around
[1:34:12] to get it done by actually I was willing
[1:34:13] say Lord here I am remember he was he
[1:34:15] was 30 years prepared for a six-month
[1:34:17] Ministry six months that's all he had he
[1:34:20] was like an orchestra where the guy
[1:34:21] picks up the big symbols he goes push
[1:34:24] once in the whole orchestra that was
[1:34:25] John he had the main fiddle party he
[1:34:28] wasn't the main leader different things
[1:34:29] he just picked up the symbols and went
[1:34:30] bush and they sat back down
[1:34:33] but wouldn't that be a pleasing thing
[1:34:35] just as long as you know you're in the
[1:34:37] orchestra just as long as you know
[1:34:38] you're playing the sheet music
[1:34:40] Hallelujah maybe maybe your your purpose
[1:34:43] in life was fulfilled years ago
[1:34:45] wouldn't that be satisfying that'd be
[1:34:47] satisfying to me praise God I've done
[1:34:49] what you've wanted me to do Lord upon
[1:34:51] the Earth Hallelujah now I'm just going
[1:34:53] into overtime just praising you amen if
[1:34:55] you never use me again that's fine Lord
[1:34:57] I'm here for you whatever you want me to
[1:34:59] do Hallelujah
[1:35:01] amen see if we think about it that way
[1:35:03] how can we get offended
[1:35:05] just love the Lord
[1:35:08] amen hallelujah but you see many people
[1:35:10] who don't have the right kind of Faith
[1:35:12] they look at success in many different
[1:35:14] ways that's success
[1:35:17] that is Success right there to the world
[1:35:19] that is failure no that's success
[1:35:22] Hallelujah but you see some people get
[1:35:24] so caught up in what they call success
[1:35:26] now
[1:35:27] Paul would get to a position where he's
[1:35:29] writing
[1:35:31] to Timothy
[1:35:33] and he would begin to say they're all
[1:35:34] men have forsaken me
[1:35:36] and he's and he's come down to the end
[1:35:38] of his Road he's in prison he's going to
[1:35:39] get his head cut off and all that your
[1:35:41] troubles and things and some people
[1:35:43] begin to think that he he got washed up
[1:35:47] God wasn't happy with him anymore
[1:35:49] and he would say for demons hath
[1:35:51] forsaken me having loved this present
[1:35:53] world and departed under thessalonica
[1:35:56] accessories to Glacier Titus unto
[1:35:59] Dalmatia see only Luke is with me take
[1:36:01] Mark and bring him with thee for he is
[1:36:04] profitable for uh to me for the ministry
[1:36:06] and uh takius have you say that have us
[1:36:09] into Ephesus the cloak that I left at
[1:36:10] trolls uh with Corpus when thou cometh
[1:36:13] bring with thee and the books especially
[1:36:15] the parchments see here was Paul he was
[1:36:19] a church age messenger hey God lived in
[1:36:21] great power in his life and he's come
[1:36:24] down to a spot which says uh bring the
[1:36:26] cloak I'm cold
[1:36:28] yeah he's calling for a particular cloak
[1:36:30] he's in prison all Minneapolis he says
[1:36:32] Demas had forsaken him now Demas Demas
[1:36:35] was a Godly Man
[1:36:36] brother M said he was Spirit-filled that
[1:36:39] he didn't just forsake Him and go into
[1:36:41] the world no but he thought that he
[1:36:43] thought that Paul Paul had become washed
[1:36:46] up
[1:36:47] and he's beginning to reason saying why
[1:36:50] has God allowed Paul to get to the state
[1:36:52] where he's actually calling for another
[1:36:53] cloak and he's in prison and all this
[1:36:55] trouble's gone on WE we've seen so much
[1:36:58] power in his life it's like God doesn't
[1:36:59] use him anymore
[1:37:01] see he had the wrong kind of faith
[1:37:03] towards Paul
[1:37:05] he was looking at what he considered
[1:37:07] success which was miracles signs and
[1:37:11] wonders no true success is staying with
[1:37:14] the word of God because there's many
[1:37:16] false anointed out there that boast in
[1:37:18] their miracles and wonders but are they
[1:37:19] on the word no they're not so true
[1:37:21] success is staying with the word of God
[1:37:24] amen see he says no I don't imagine
[1:37:26] Demas um didn't forsake Him and start
[1:37:28] off to nightclubs I don't imagine Demas
[1:37:31] did that because Demas was a
[1:37:32] Spirit-filled man he was a great helper
[1:37:34] if he ever took the history of Demas he
[1:37:35] was a notable preacher a fine cultured
[1:37:37] man highly polished educated he was a
[1:37:39] smart man but why would he forsake Paul
[1:37:41] that's the thing what made him do it for
[1:37:43] Saint Paul I don't believe he wanted to
[1:37:44] go to a nightclub or anything but I
[1:37:46] believe it was God separating Paul now
[1:37:48] let's take a summer demas's thoughts as
[1:37:50] I was sitting down on the hillside
[1:37:51] wondering the other day about daylight I
[1:37:53] was thinking why would Demas want to
[1:37:55] leave that fellow what would make him
[1:37:57] leave that little preacher that led him
[1:37:59] to the Lord the man who spearheaded the
[1:38:01] Revival among the Gentiles
[1:38:03] a prophet indeed no one could say that
[1:38:06] um but he was a prophet he was among he
[1:38:08] was more than a prophet he was an
[1:38:09] apostle and the Great Mighty Apostle to
[1:38:11] the Gentiles and demons would have
[1:38:13] associated with Paul had fellowship and
[1:38:15] seen the spirit of God move upon that
[1:38:17] man
[1:38:18] see but then he got to a point why would
[1:38:20] he turn his back on such a person
[1:38:22] Vindicated he was a servant of Christ
[1:38:23] but did he notice Paul here loving this
[1:38:25] present world is what what said about
[1:38:27] demons I don't think demons backslid I
[1:38:29] think he didn't do that but I think he
[1:38:30] got the wrong opinion of Paul
[1:38:34] see Paul got to a point God was using
[1:38:37] Paul in a different way still living in
[1:38:39] his life but Demas had the wrong idea of
[1:38:43] Paul see how many times we can get the
[1:38:45] wrong idea of one another
[1:38:47] oh they're on the hilltop praise God
[1:38:49] they're a Christian they're really
[1:38:50] overcoming but then they go into a night
[1:38:53] season you know brother and says like
[1:38:54] the seasons of the yeah you know of
[1:38:56] nature we go through Seasons we we have
[1:38:58] our summer time but then sometimes we go
[1:39:00] into an Autumn season it can be a winter
[1:39:02] time everything's just it's like we're
[1:39:04] basically skidding in the ditch we're on
[1:39:05] fire flipping around you know down the
[1:39:07] ditch but then we come back and do a
[1:39:08] springtime again we go up and down
[1:39:10] Cycles but that doesn't mean God's
[1:39:12] displeased with us
[1:39:14] amen I I trust this brings stability to
[1:39:18] someone we're going to look at our lives
[1:39:19] in a different way I think
[1:39:20] amen see Demas he came out of a rich
[1:39:23] family sorry for the reading but I felt
[1:39:24] it was important he was wealthy money
[1:39:26] sometimes makes religion to people would
[1:39:28] you like saying California if you
[1:39:30] haven't got three Cadillacs you're not
[1:39:31] spiritual so it means if you're not if
[1:39:33] you're not successful if you don't have
[1:39:35] the finest church out here in the city
[1:39:36] and people won't go that's almost the
[1:39:38] way it is here poor you you've got to
[1:39:40] have the finest Church in the country or
[1:39:41] they say Oh you mean you join that
[1:39:43] little Bunch like that did you know that
[1:39:45] our Lord didn't have a place to lay his
[1:39:46] head did you know he only owned one
[1:39:48] coatsi and he just it was a kind of a
[1:39:50] person was pushed about he didn't have
[1:39:52] no place to lay his head but they could
[1:39:54] have had thought the same thing and did
[1:39:56] about him and now I believe demon saw a
[1:39:58] failing seemingly in Paul's Ministry I
[1:40:00] think you're he thought the old fellow
[1:40:01] was washed up before God we can't get
[1:40:04] that opinion about one another
[1:40:06] amen no where Faith looks beyond
[1:40:10] see faith is actually as I've said it's
[1:40:12] it's faith is actually unconscious yeah
[1:40:15] it's a subconscious thing you possess
[1:40:16] it's a condition that the Holy Ghost
[1:40:18] puts you in it's not something you
[1:40:20] mentally work up
[1:40:21] right it's something that's unconscious
[1:40:25] amen some see your faith is not a
[1:40:27] conscious thing we don't work it out see
[1:40:29] the kingdom of heaven doesn't come by
[1:40:30] observation I'm going to try and wind
[1:40:31] this up real quick I know time is
[1:40:33] running away see you don't see don't
[1:40:35] press now or jump you jump away from it
[1:40:37] it's right with you just relax yourself
[1:40:38] and believe what is that God is more
[1:40:41] than able to do what he's promised to do
[1:40:43] he's a keeper of his word amen that's a
[1:40:45] real Faith amen but see sometimes your
[1:40:48] faith says unconscious and you don't
[1:40:49] know it see that's why we've got to go
[1:40:51] beyond well our mental work up see it's
[1:40:53] actually a condition you're in
[1:40:55] are we all together this morning right
[1:40:57] are we just let's just slog through
[1:40:59] we're nearly done okay see now Jesus
[1:41:02] didn't have to go out and fast all day
[1:41:03] pray all day and say no I wonder if I've
[1:41:05] got enough Faith to do this
[1:41:07] you don't read them doing that do you
[1:41:08] see he was unconscious of the faith he
[1:41:10] had any man or woman that's ever made
[1:41:12] real Warriors in the kingdom of God is
[1:41:14] perfectly unconscious of their faith see
[1:41:17] we keep trying to test our faith I
[1:41:18] wonder if we all have enough faith for
[1:41:20] this I wonder if I can actually have
[1:41:21] faith to make this promise see no don't
[1:41:23] test your faith no do you believe the
[1:41:26] word of God is he more than able to keep
[1:41:29] his word it's not you performing see the
[1:41:31] devil aways see what does the devil do
[1:41:33] like he went to Jesus in the wilderness
[1:41:35] if thou be the Son of God prove it
[1:41:37] turn the stones into bread do this do
[1:41:39] this do this if you're really the son of
[1:41:41] God come off the cross and we'll believe
[1:41:42] you see it's basically the devil tried
[1:41:45] to make Jesus prove himself to him
[1:41:48] and people say if you're really the
[1:41:50] bride of Christ do this pray for this be
[1:41:53] like this we don't have to prove nothing
[1:41:55] it's God that proves his word in our
[1:41:58] lives we don't have to prove his word in
[1:42:00] our lives We Just Surrender ourselves to
[1:42:02] him and he fulfills it
[1:42:05] why is the devil saying if thou be if
[1:42:07] you really are do this I don't have to
[1:42:08] prove nothing
[1:42:09] God proves his word see Hallelujah
[1:42:14] amen see God said so do it anyhow God
[1:42:16] said so have you ever tested your faith
[1:42:18] whether you've got no faith to come to
[1:42:20] the meeting or not tonight who did that
[1:42:22] this morning
[1:42:23] no you just came to church didn't you
[1:42:24] you'd have to test your faith I wonder
[1:42:26] if I can believe enough to come now you
[1:42:27] just come see did you test your faith to
[1:42:30] see if you had enough Faith to eat your
[1:42:31] supper
[1:42:34] right you have a need and you eat you
[1:42:36] want to come to church you just come to
[1:42:38] church you don't want to come to church
[1:42:39] you come anyhow
[1:42:40] you don't feel like rolling out of bed
[1:42:42] you roll out of bed say praise God I'm
[1:42:44] going to church today
[1:42:45] Hallelujah
[1:42:47] amen amen do you think you'll have
[1:42:51] enough um do you think you have to fast
[1:42:52] a while test your faith to see if you've
[1:42:54] got enough Faith to drive your car home
[1:42:56] who's going to go on a fast to see if
[1:42:58] their car works
[1:42:59] that sounds ridiculous but this is how
[1:43:01] we approach the promises of God
[1:43:03] do I really have enough Faith to do this
[1:43:05] do I really is it really going to happen
[1:43:07] you don't fulfill the word
[1:43:09] he fulfills it in your life God has more
[1:43:12] than enough Faith to prove his word
[1:43:13] right God is more than enough ability he
[1:43:17] doesn't just scrape through and pass an
[1:43:18] exam 50 or 45 percent no no 100 120
[1:43:23] percent amen so this way certainly not
[1:43:25] see it's just automatically you believe
[1:43:27] it and that's how we should be that's
[1:43:29] why I mean by faith and subconscious you
[1:43:31] just automatically say your word is true
[1:43:33] Lord you're more than able to do it Lord
[1:43:35] I believe your word
[1:43:36] see faith is a revelation amen it's
[1:43:39] something that's been revealed to you
[1:43:40] you don't have to it's like when you get
[1:43:42] a revelation the Bible is the word of
[1:43:43] God you just you just live it out
[1:43:46] right it's not well is this really your
[1:43:48] will God no it's his word it's not man's
[1:43:50] opinion amen it's no it's it's his word
[1:43:52] so you automatically live it out you
[1:43:54] don't need to struggle with it because
[1:43:55] why it's revealed the Bible is true amen
[1:43:58] faith is a revelation this is Elijah on
[1:44:00] Mount Carmel see human faith is like the
[1:44:03] prophets of Baal they tried to
[1:44:05] manufacture a faith by fleshly
[1:44:08] manifestation see they were singing and
[1:44:10] dancing around the altar doing all that
[1:44:12] they could do and Elijah said well maybe
[1:44:14] he's asleep maybe he's pursuing maybe
[1:44:15] he's busy whole little louder so they
[1:44:18] started to cut themselves and cry all
[1:44:19] the more they're trying to manufacture
[1:44:21] an answer from God but you see Elijah
[1:44:24] before he ever went to Mount Carmel he
[1:44:26] saw a vision and he saw this happening
[1:44:28] so when he went up Mount Carmel he
[1:44:30] wasn't guessing well I think God will do
[1:44:32] this no it was revealed to him he went
[1:44:34] up Mount Carmel in faith in a revelation
[1:44:37] that's why when he built rebuilt the
[1:44:39] alternate everything he said he said
[1:44:40] Lord I've done all this according I've
[1:44:43] done all these things at Thy word that
[1:44:46] means he rebuilt the altar at his word
[1:44:48] amen he put the bull a coin and
[1:44:50] everything at his word he he made the
[1:44:52] water put onto it according to his word
[1:44:54] so then when he prayed he said Lord what
[1:44:56] you showed me in vision is now
[1:44:57] manifested now you bring the fire amen
[1:45:00] and that's what happened so he wasn't
[1:45:02] guessing or hoping that God will send
[1:45:04] the fire he went in confidence that God
[1:45:06] was gonna perform his word and it should
[1:45:09] be the same thing with you and I with
[1:45:11] the word of God we've seen this by
[1:45:13] vision
[1:45:15] amen well what do you mean by that if
[1:45:18] God was revealed to you this is his word
[1:45:19] that's like Elijah seeing a vision
[1:45:23] amen you know he's going to fulfill it
[1:45:25] hello she can walk in confidence
[1:45:27] according to his word and then God will
[1:45:30] fulfill what's left of it
[1:45:33] amen amen it's like it says in these
[1:45:35] signs Mark 16 these signs shall follow
[1:45:37] them that believe who believes that you
[1:45:40] know many you know a lot of Bibles they
[1:45:42] put a foot though these last few verses
[1:45:43] weren't inspired
[1:45:45] people have told me that and I've told
[1:45:48] them testimonies of laying hands on the
[1:45:50] second happening oh no that's not
[1:45:51] inspired well hold on
[1:45:53] it is because it happens
[1:45:55] who's had hands laid on them and you've
[1:45:57] been made well or God's touched you what
[1:45:59] is that that's Mark 16 in action but
[1:46:01] notice this because faith is
[1:46:02] subconscious right it doesn't say and
[1:46:05] they will pray and lay their hands on
[1:46:06] the sick and they'll recover no they'll
[1:46:07] just lay their hands on the sick it does
[1:46:10] we of course we pray right we always
[1:46:12] pray but the Bible hears it doesn't even
[1:46:14] mention prayer why because that
[1:46:16] quickening power to bring healing to
[1:46:18] someone is already in You by the Holy
[1:46:20] Ghost right and that quickening power by
[1:46:22] faith but in faith doing what God says
[1:46:25] lay hands upon the sick causes it to
[1:46:28] happen
[1:46:28] why because faith is unconscious you
[1:46:31] don't have to manufacture well Lord I
[1:46:33] hope you do it this time because at that
[1:46:34] time no you have a perfect confidence
[1:46:36] these signs shall follow them the belief
[1:46:38] I'm a Believer so therefore Lord You're
[1:46:40] Going to fulfill this in my life
[1:46:42] Hallelujah
[1:46:44] isn't that neat I think that's pretty
[1:46:46] neat see we see we should have
[1:46:47] confidence we've got sick children you
[1:46:49] pick them up what are you doing laying
[1:46:50] hands on the sick
[1:46:51] amen you believing now that
[1:46:53] subconsciously that that quickening
[1:46:54] power of the Holy Ghost is going from
[1:46:56] you into their bodies and bringing
[1:46:58] healing into their bodies
[1:47:01] praise God Hallelujah
[1:47:04] amen just like the same thing with Paul
[1:47:07] when he took the Hat sick handkerchiefs
[1:47:08] and aprons and so on from his body so he
[1:47:11] doesn't even say anything about praying
[1:47:12] for these what we call prayer cloths
[1:47:14] today they're just on them the
[1:47:16] quickening power of the Holy Ghost went
[1:47:17] into them and then those in faith will
[1:47:19] take it saying this is on the Apostle
[1:47:21] Paul's body we'll send in the Old
[1:47:22] Testament with Elijah and the shooter
[1:47:24] woman's son and different things and you
[1:47:25] know God raising the dead and healing
[1:47:27] because of these things so they had
[1:47:28] Faith now that when this touches my
[1:47:31] second individual I mean I mean love one
[1:47:33] whoever it's going to happen and it's
[1:47:34] exactly what happened
[1:47:36] why but it was a it was a subconscious
[1:47:38] thing see we have faith we're going to
[1:47:40] let it just work
[1:47:41] amen
[1:47:43] Hallelujah now Elijah I mean Elisha had
[1:47:47] had real faith
[1:47:49] Elijah tried to say stag gilgal stay
[1:47:51] here stay he says no I'm not leaving you
[1:47:53] amen I'm not living I I am your problem
[1:47:56] I'm gonna hang around Hallelujah right
[1:47:59] and then and then Elijah said after they
[1:48:01] crossed the Jordan now what what do you
[1:48:03] want from me he says I want a double
[1:48:05] portion I want to double anointing of
[1:48:07] what you have received and Elijah said
[1:48:09] well that may be a hard thing but if you
[1:48:11] see me go you'll receive it now Elijah
[1:48:13] represents Christ Elisha represents the
[1:48:15] church amen so the the anointing on
[1:48:18] Christ now a double portion comes upon
[1:48:20] the Believers amen hallelujah what
[1:48:23] happened to so so Elijah parted the
[1:48:25] Jordan with the with the with the mantle
[1:48:28] right and then the last year after he
[1:48:30] received the same mantle took that same
[1:48:32] mantle to the same spot in the Jordan
[1:48:33] and said where's the god of Elijah and
[1:48:36] God now proved to Elisha the god of
[1:48:38] Elijah was now his God it wasn't just
[1:48:40] walking with the prophet that God
[1:48:41] dwelled in now that same God was now in
[1:48:44] him and that must be the same thing with
[1:48:46] you and I that the same anointing on the
[1:48:48] prophet now brother Branham that a
[1:48:50] double portion comes upon the bride of
[1:48:52] Christ and we see the same God that you
[1:48:54] hear on tape is the same God that lives
[1:48:56] in our midst Hallelujah but you see now
[1:48:59] Elijah God now here's a man who had
[1:49:01] double portion he did eight Miracles
[1:49:03] Elijah did four Elijah to date now you
[1:49:07] would think well he's got a double
[1:49:08] portion so he's gonna probably go in a
[1:49:10] double Chariot right up into heaven
[1:49:13] because he's got double portion no not
[1:49:16] necessarily so you want to be very see
[1:49:18] John the Baptist he got cut off because
[1:49:19] a little girl danced right the Apostle
[1:49:22] Paul's he got cut off you know all these
[1:49:24] things you know but it says now Elisha
[1:49:26] was full and sick of the sickness wrath
[1:49:28] he died he was a man with a double
[1:49:29] portion
[1:49:30] doesn't mean that God was displeased
[1:49:32] with Elisha no this was the Avenue God
[1:49:35] was going to use to bring him home see
[1:49:38] he took a chariot right I mean he's a
[1:49:40] chariot right for Elijah right he used
[1:49:43] sickness for Elisha did they end up in
[1:49:45] the same destination
[1:49:47] amen see see death is just a travel bus
[1:49:50] to get us to where we really want to go
[1:49:53] it may come in cancer it may come in a
[1:49:55] car wreck it may come and you know a
[1:49:58] stroke and the different things that may
[1:49:59] come in a sickness it may come in many
[1:50:01] different ways it may go by the way the
[1:50:03] Rapture your bodies have changed but
[1:50:04] we're going to end up in the same
[1:50:05] destination it's God's prerogative to
[1:50:08] how we get there
[1:50:10] now we surrendered to his leadership and
[1:50:12] his will
[1:50:13] Hallelujah but you see now Elisha when
[1:50:15] he got Fallen sick and he died he was
[1:50:17] actually one Miracle shot
[1:50:19] seven were done
[1:50:21] right but maybe he had a double portion
[1:50:24] yeah there was one that was not done and
[1:50:26] no doubt the critics begin to circle
[1:50:28] around saying Elisha I thought you had a
[1:50:30] double portion where's that eighth
[1:50:31] Miracle because you're being prophesying
[1:50:33] that you've got a double portion and
[1:50:34] yeah but you know since when the critics
[1:50:36] come in but you see God was going to
[1:50:39] show that Elisha did not have to be
[1:50:41] alive for that last miracle to take
[1:50:44] place why because the quickening power
[1:50:46] that took Elijah up in a Rapture was the
[1:50:49] same quickening power that was in his
[1:50:51] mortal body Hallelujah so now Elijah
[1:50:53] died they bury him they think well he's
[1:50:55] one Miracle short many people think the
[1:50:57] bride is one Miracle short we ain't one
[1:50:59] Miracle short because the last miracle
[1:51:01] the bride is going to do if God through
[1:51:02] them is the resurrection of the Dead
[1:51:04] amen is the change of the body
[1:51:05] Hallelujah that's the last miracle the
[1:51:07] bride's gonna do if Elisha's last
[1:51:09] miracle looked see so there's you know
[1:51:11] there's fighting going on they're
[1:51:13] carrying their dead friends some
[1:51:14] soldiers and they just see an open
[1:51:15] Sepulcher it was Elisha and they threw
[1:51:17] the dead man's body in there and
[1:51:19] Elisha's body was just bones it was
[1:51:21] decay right and rotten away but as soon
[1:51:23] as that dead man got landed on Elijah's
[1:51:25] bones he came back to life why because
[1:51:28] the resurrection happened just by a man
[1:51:30] hitting the grave of Elisha why because
[1:51:33] the quickening power was in his body see
[1:51:36] Elisha did not have to be alive for the
[1:51:39] miracle to take place it was faith is a
[1:51:42] subconscious thing I don't think you're
[1:51:44] dead like Elisha was friends but you've
[1:51:46] got a subconscious faith that can make
[1:51:48] the word of God operate however he wants
[1:51:50] to operate Hallelujah see this is why we
[1:51:53] as we're not here to mentally work
[1:51:54] ourselves up no if we have faith in the
[1:51:56] word God will answer his word according
[1:51:58] to his time exactly how he's going to do
[1:52:00] it I mean I like you know I remember I
[1:52:03] remember Christine to her this is a big
[1:52:04] testimony you've seen many things happen
[1:52:06] and then our our washing machine was
[1:52:09] broken and someone said just go pray for
[1:52:11] it so she laid her hands on it we've
[1:52:13] prayed for appliances before
[1:52:14] they get fixed amen thank you hey God
[1:52:18] can do anything why should we limit him
[1:52:19] right but then she lays her hands on the
[1:52:21] washing machine she prays she goes to
[1:52:23] turn it on doesn't work
[1:52:24] but then a voice said to her but you
[1:52:26] believe me anyhow and she was dancing
[1:52:28] around the kitchen having a jubilee time
[1:52:30] because our faith is not based on how
[1:52:32] our prayers are answered you might say
[1:52:34] well she didn't have enough Faith yes
[1:52:35] she did
[1:52:37] but you see faith is not based on
[1:52:39] outcome faith is a condition you're in
[1:52:43] just like Elisha what's his condition
[1:52:46] well he actually died in faith he's full
[1:52:48] of cricketing power oh that should be
[1:52:50] the same thing with you and I if you've
[1:52:52] got the Holy Ghost we're full of
[1:52:53] quickening power amen so faith is a
[1:52:56] subconscious thing so don't ever make it
[1:52:58] a thing you're going to mentally work up
[1:52:59] I wonder if my faith will work no if you
[1:53:02] have faith to get salvation
[1:53:04] then you have faith for healing because
[1:53:06] the because your faith is in the same
[1:53:08] atonement that is for your soul is in
[1:53:10] the healing of your body and your spirit
[1:53:12] amen hallelujah
[1:53:14] praise God so things go sideways
[1:53:17] don't worry about the sideways
[1:53:21] amen see see this little fellow picked
[1:53:23] up that robot type of the church against
[1:53:25] he picked out that robe he'd done Twice
[1:53:26] The Miracles which is a type of Christ
[1:53:28] in the church the Elijah down for he
[1:53:30] donates he now he was had double the
[1:53:32] power
[1:53:33] Hallelujah he died that took him out and
[1:53:35] buried him you know well that quickening
[1:53:36] power didn't leave him many many years
[1:53:38] after that when that flesh had all
[1:53:40] rotted off his bones just laying in the
[1:53:41] Tomb and there they're packing a dead
[1:53:43] man one day they saw the enemy they just
[1:53:45] throwed this man on top of Elijah's
[1:53:47] bones there was so much quickening power
[1:53:48] on those bones so the man jumped up to
[1:53:50] life again oh it'll Quicken your mortal
[1:53:52] body though dead and rotten in the grave
[1:53:54] and yet that quickening power rested
[1:53:56] over that dirt Hallelujah he raised he
[1:53:58] that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:54:00] shall also Quicken your mortal body amen
[1:54:02] so this is how we should be see faith
[1:54:04] fight the subconscious you have it or
[1:54:07] you don't
[1:54:07] amen if you if your Christian Walkers
[1:54:10] like this all the time based on
[1:54:12] conditions you need Faith you need a
[1:54:15] stability in your life right but if your
[1:54:17] Christian Walkers just even if you've
[1:54:18] got your ups and downs but you keep
[1:54:19] walking on
[1:54:21] you've got real faith
[1:54:23] amen amen
[1:54:25] I'll finish with this quote Jesus Christ
[1:54:27] no matter if he was in a storm and a
[1:54:29] girl was knocking the boat from one side
[1:54:30] to another or he is standing in the face
[1:54:32] a mess of demons if he is hanging
[1:54:34] anywhere it never moved to him he walked
[1:54:36] right on just as calm as quiet he as he
[1:54:39] could be why he was simply unconscious
[1:54:41] of fear or anything around him now that
[1:54:43] doesn't mean he had blinkers on
[1:54:45] right that's right whether what was
[1:54:48] going to happen whether it wasn't going
[1:54:49] to happen he knowed it was going to
[1:54:50] happen because God said so
[1:54:52] see this is why when we pray we should
[1:54:54] pray in faith
[1:54:57] will it happen or not no God said so
[1:55:00] amen he didn't say oh have I prayed
[1:55:02] through wonder if I've fasted long
[1:55:04] enough wonder if I did this he just
[1:55:05] walked right on unconscious that's right
[1:55:08] he believed what God Said was truth the
[1:55:10] words must be fulfilled and he knowed
[1:55:12] what what his life was to fulfill them
[1:55:15] that's right and you're here to fulfill
[1:55:17] it too
[1:55:18] just walk on unconscious of fear walk
[1:55:21] unconscious of criticism walk
[1:55:24] unconscious unto the world walk as you
[1:55:26] walk in Christ walk with him not paying
[1:55:28] any attention to the right or left hand
[1:55:30] just keep moving on if something comes
[1:55:32] up in church walk with God hallelujah if
[1:55:34] sickness strikes you walk with God if
[1:55:36] the neighbor don't like you walk with
[1:55:38] God just keep walking on with God Enoch
[1:55:41] one day walked like that you know what
[1:55:43] he done he walked all the way home with
[1:55:45] God got so far far up the road he didn't
[1:55:47] want to come back anymore amen walk with
[1:55:49] God doctor says you're going to die walk
[1:55:52] with God yeah doctor says you can't get
[1:55:54] well walk with God just walk with God
[1:55:56] that's all for God has promised you I'll
[1:55:58] never leave you nor forsake you I'll be
[1:56:00] with you to the end of the world and he
[1:56:02] took an oath by that Covenant that he
[1:56:04] give you and that he would confirm it
[1:56:06] just walk with God then you'll have your
[1:56:08] ups and downs don't worry you've got to
[1:56:11] go through Briar patches over sharp
[1:56:13] rocks over Bluffs over the side down
