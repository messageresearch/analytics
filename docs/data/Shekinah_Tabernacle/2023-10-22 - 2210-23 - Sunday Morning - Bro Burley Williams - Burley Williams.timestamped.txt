[1:02:12] um I don't know what I have a lot of
[1:02:15] stuff but um I'm I'm trying my best to
[1:02:19] get to that sermon that I told you about
[1:02:23] uh
[1:02:24] Lord have mercy
[1:02:26] reasoning I'm going work my way to it
[1:02:28] but we turn to galatian
[1:02:32] 4 I'm going to try my best to get
[1:02:41] there Galatians chapter 4 and I want to
[1:02:44] go to verse one this is a very familiar
[1:02:53] scripture
[1:02:55] it's one of the worst things you can do
[1:02:56] when you have to
[1:02:57] minister is talk to other
[1:03:00] preachers and you sit at the table and
[1:03:02] you talk and you tap they tap into your
[1:03:07] sermons like me and brother Adrian going
[1:03:09] at it and he tapped and I said Lord have
[1:03:12] mercy but still I have to just preach
[1:03:14] you know amen so galatian chapter 4
[1:03:17] verse1 now I say that the heir as long
[1:03:21] as he is a s child differs nothing from
[1:03:24] a servant though he be Lord of all but
[1:03:27] is on the tutors and governors until the
[1:03:30] time appointed of the father
[1:03:33] amen verse verse three even so we when
[1:03:36] we are children were in bondage under
[1:03:38] the elements of the world but when the
[1:03:41] fullness of time was come God sent forth
[1:03:43] his son made of a woman made under the
[1:03:46] law to redeem them that was under the
[1:03:48] law that we might receive the adoption
[1:03:51] of
[1:03:52] son because you are Sons God has sent
[1:03:55] forth the spirit of his son into your
[1:03:58] hearts crying oh my father wherefor
[1:04:01] verse 7 said wherefore Thou Art no more
[1:04:04] servant but a son and if a son then an
[1:04:07] heir of God through Christ let's read
[1:04:11] verse 7 again wherefore Thou Art no more
[1:04:13] a servant but a son amen and if a son
[1:04:18] then an he of God through Christ may the
[1:04:21] Lord add a blessing to the reading of
[1:04:23] the word you may be seated
[1:04:25] it and
[1:04:28] uh Lord I pray that he would help us and
[1:04:31] it's good to see my my friend brother
[1:04:33] Paul
[1:04:34] Mett I love that
[1:04:36] man praise the Lord God bless you
[1:04:40] Soldier just was good to see him and
[1:04:42] shake his hand uh uh my first time
[1:04:46] coming to New Zealand brother Paul

[1:04:55] but we just thank God for his grace and
[1:04:57] mercy I enjoy your heels and the and the
[1:05:00] sceneries and so forth but uh New
[1:05:03] Zealand is too quiet for
[1:05:06] me and uh we we like a little not
[1:05:10] spiritually not not spiritually now
[1:05:13] naturally uh I can I I I like it but you
[1:05:16] know when we from a Little Noise We just
[1:05:18] like a I like to hear
[1:05:21] [Music]
[1:05:22] cars just that's just I'm from you know
[1:05:25] so but praise the lord we just thank God
[1:05:28] for his grace and mercy I I I I do want
[1:05:31] to I'm still going to try to get to that
[1:05:33] service service but uh uh I was reading
[1:05:36] this morning something that's come up
[1:05:38] also on my heart and and I want to talk
[1:05:41] about growth how that we grow and how we
[1:05:45] mature in things that we go through in
[1:05:47] life and uh I want to TU a thought uh
[1:05:52] language language to the bride and a
[1:05:56] subtire is servants and Sons because
[1:05:59] there's a different from a servant and a
[1:06:01] son is that right you know we don't
[1:06:05] lose make no difference what we go
[1:06:08] through we don't
[1:06:09] lose uh I was just thinking how God does
[1:06:12] things in reverse and uh how the devil
[1:06:16] thinks that he's getting ahead of
[1:06:17] something and God just flips it and
[1:06:19] change it back around I thank God for
[1:06:22] that you know uh
[1:06:24] Adam uh Adam raised the devil's
[1:06:30] son he raised him is that right I
[1:06:34] promise you somewhere when Adam looked
[1:06:37] at Abel and he he looked at Cain as they
[1:06:40] begin to grow I'm pretty sure he begin
[1:06:42] to like yeah they're
[1:06:44] different but he raised that guy
[1:06:47] son and the and the boy that he raised
[1:06:51] caused problems in the house yeah
[1:06:54] he raised somebody else's son and it
[1:06:56] caused him problems in his house amen
[1:07:01] God said I'm going to do the same thing
[1:07:03] as Adam raised the devil son God let
[1:07:06] Pharaoh raise Moses
[1:07:11] on God said I'm going to reverse it and
[1:07:15] then Moses caed problem for Pharaoh's
[1:07:18] house is that right see that's how God
[1:07:20] do things God let the Pharisees raised
[1:07:26] Paul is that right God let the Pharisees
[1:07:29] educate him give him all his schooling
[1:07:31] and all those things then God turned it
[1:07:33] around then Paul caused them
[1:07:35] problems can we say praise the Lord he
[1:07:38] does things in the reverse God let the
[1:07:41] world raise
[1:07:43] me God let the devil raise me now I took
[1:07:46] everything that I learned from the devil
[1:07:48] switching around now I cause the devil's
[1:07:52] problems so we don't lose we just don't
[1:07:55] lose I just thank God for that and I
[1:07:58] think about those things a lot how that
[1:08:00] God just does things so
[1:08:02] wonderfully praise the Lord you know uh
[1:08:05] as we grow um and and and and we going
[1:08:08] to just maybe deal with some things and
[1:08:10] and I pray that the Lord would help us
[1:08:12] because these things are
[1:08:14] serious is that right and I like
[1:08:16] preaching to the young people because
[1:08:18] you got to you got to go there and then
[1:08:20] plant the right seeds that when they get
[1:08:22] older they'll come back I remember
[1:08:24] certain things and we got to do those
[1:08:26] things is that right and there's so many
[1:08:29] uh unbalanced things around the message
[1:08:31] but that's okay because I believe there
[1:08:34] is a
[1:08:34] balance is that right and and and uh
[1:08:37] we're in the season of balance how God
[1:08:40] is balancing everything out amen and I
[1:08:42] and I like that amen I it's good to see
[1:08:45] young people uh grasping hope to not
[1:08:48] just the letter of the word but the life
[1:08:50] of the word and seeing their lives
[1:08:52] change and it's Wonder ful to see those
[1:08:54] things Amen to see uh young girls
[1:08:57] turning to ladies and young boys turning
[1:09:00] to men uh the gospel can change
[1:09:03] you do you believe that and and I'm
[1:09:06] thankful for that and uh I'm not a
[1:09:08] Critic and I'm not don't trying to be
[1:09:10] critical but I like to be honest and
[1:09:11] just lay things out the way it's
[1:09:13] supposed to be I like for a man to be a
[1:09:15] man and a woman to be a woman that's why
[1:09:18] we teach the young boys you need to be a
[1:09:21] gentleman is that right don't play with
[1:09:23] girls emotions don't play with girls
[1:09:25] feeling be a gentleman amen the prophet
[1:09:27] warned us about those things how a young
[1:09:29] man is supposed to he said remember that
[1:09:31] is a daughter of
[1:09:33] God can we say praise the Lord you know
[1:09:36] down through the years I hear preachers
[1:09:37] talk about sisters need to be virgins
[1:09:40] sister need to be virgins let me tell
[1:09:42] you too boys need to be virgins
[1:09:44] too can we say praise the Lord they need
[1:09:47] to be vergins too praise the Lord not go

[1:09:51] brother L brother Isaac read last last
[1:09:53] night the prophet don't go out there
[1:09:55] trying to se your Wild Oaks and so forth
[1:09:57] come on now he said don't be doing that
[1:10:00] praise the Lord amen the message came to
[1:10:02] keep
[1:10:03] us and rais up a generation can say God
[1:10:07] kept me uh my son got married six months
[1:10:10] ago and uh uh a lot of unbelievers was
[1:10:13] at the funeral a lot of them was there
[1:10:15] on the uh his wife's side and uh when
[1:10:18] they come up to the Altar and so forth
[1:10:20] and and I and I just made a statement I

[1:10:24] in courtship for 5 years and today is
[1:10:28] the first day they
[1:10:30] kiss on and people like I said yeah it's
[1:10:35] possible it's very possible I said this
[1:10:38] is the first day they lips would touch
[1:10:41] in five years of courtship these things
[1:10:43] are possible if you keep God in the
[1:10:46] midst can we say praise the Lord that's
[1:10:49] why you got to be careful brother and
[1:10:51] sister young people uh treat a woman a
[1:10:53] sister like a lady she's a sister in
[1:10:56] Christ he's a brother in Christ don't
[1:10:58] get anxious about things don't get
[1:11:00] curious about things because these
[1:11:02] things are precious if I ask you young
[1:11:04] man why do you want to get married what
[1:11:06] are you going to tell me what is your
[1:11:08] answer what are you going to tell me why

[1:11:17] lonely like Adam was lonely can we say
[1:11:20] Amen wasn't Adam
[1:11:22] lonely but he wasn't lonely for sex cuzz
[1:11:25] that wasn't in his mind that wasn't in
[1:11:28] his vocabulary he was lonely for
[1:11:30] companionship so why do you want to get
[1:11:32] married is it physical spiritual ask
[1:11:35] yourself these things as we go through
[1:11:37] the service because it means something
[1:11:41] amen I I take those things personally
[1:11:43] when a young man decides to La a man's
[1:11:46] daughter let me tell you something fella
[1:11:48] you you got to come
[1:11:50] right you got to come right you can't
[1:11:52] come unbalanced you got got to come
[1:11:54] right you can't bypass the man don't
[1:11:56] talk to the girl we her hard then once
[1:11:59] you get her hard now you want to talk to
[1:12:01] the father that ain't the way it works
[1:12:03] can we say praise the Lord you got to
[1:12:05] approach the man approach the father and
[1:12:07] I always tell young girls if you don't
[1:12:09] have a father you got a pastor you got
[1:12:11] deacons you got Elders in the church
[1:12:14] because we got to watch these things
[1:12:15] guard these things because I've seen I'm
[1:12:19] it hurts my heart to see so many young
[1:12:21] people get married and then six months
[1:12:23] they're not married it don't work
[1:12:26] something went wrong
[1:12:27] somewhere can we say Amen that is not
[1:12:30] what this message supposed to
[1:12:32] produce it's supposed to produce Sons
[1:12:35] and Daughters of God that's what it's
[1:12:38] supposed to produce and I believe that
[1:12:41] amen uh I just like I'm just kind of
[1:12:44] relax my spirit so I'm just talking amen
[1:12:46] just got to talk to try to get into a
[1:12:49] channel that just the way the way that
[1:12:51] it is and uh but you know it's a family
[1:12:53] camp and if you want a strong Church you
[1:12:56] got to have strong families because
[1:12:58] that's how it starts amen but you know
[1:13:01] we have to grow and uh uh none of us uh
[1:13:04] when it comes to serving the lord uh
[1:13:06] just that just the same as a child it
[1:13:08] don't start out walking they have to
[1:13:10] crawl and so forth same with
[1:13:12] Christianity we grow but we have to see
[1:13:14] a progress I want to see myself growing
[1:13:18] more today than it was yesterday I want
[1:13:21] to look at my spirit look at my life am
[1:13:23] I closer to God today than I was
[1:13:26] yesterday that's the way I look at
[1:13:28] things and that's the way I want it to
[1:13:29] be but I want to just uh if the Lord
[1:13:33] would just help us uh uh uh servants and
[1:13:36] Sons that is totally different things is
[1:13:40] that right but God want us to be Sons
[1:13:43] now you can start out as a servant but
[1:13:46] God intent is for us to be sons and that
[1:13:50] takes time and it takes training for
[1:13:52] those things to happen but but my thing
[1:13:55] is uh language we are identified by
[1:13:58] language how many you know the bride is
[1:14:00] identified by language you go to a
[1:14:03] denomination of church and saying I feel
[1:14:05] the pool they'll look at you
[1:14:09] like you go to a denomination church
[1:14:12] sing I'm going to step into my theop and
[1:14:14] they'll be like what are you talking
[1:14:17] about because they don't understand our
[1:14:20] language we have a language God has
[1:14:23] given the bride a language and we
[1:14:26] understand that language can we say
[1:14:28] praise the Lord so as we go through
[1:14:31] these things cuz language it changes as
[1:14:34] you actually grow language change as you
[1:14:38] grow can we say praise the Lord I always
[1:14:41] tell the young people if you want to
[1:14:43] know where you're at if you really want
[1:14:45] to know where you at listen to your
[1:14:47] parents' language how they talk to you
[1:14:50] and you'll find out where you're
[1:14:52] at
[1:14:55] some of you looking at me like I fell
[1:14:56] off the moon somewhere I'm just telling
[1:14:58] you the truth we are identified by our
[1:15:01] language how how we speak how we talk
[1:15:03] back your speech give you a away same as
[1:15:06] Peter his speech gave him away he
[1:15:08] couldn't hide it they say oh you want
[1:15:10] you you with Jesus he no see your speech
[1:15:12] gives you away can we say praise the
[1:15:15] Lord so when we conversate with one
[1:15:17] another me as being a pastor I listen to
[1:15:20] how people talk and I want to pick up
[1:15:22] their language to find out what's is in
[1:15:24] their heart and where they're at
[1:15:27] sometimes people when they're
[1:15:28] discouraged in their heart they try to
[1:15:31] use a different language from their
[1:15:33] mouth that they're happy it won't work
[1:15:37] can we say praise the Lord it won't work
[1:15:39] you're trying to trick yourself that
[1:15:40] you're happy but down in your heart you
[1:15:42] know you're not that won't work and you
[1:15:45] can discern those things but notice when
[1:15:48] when everything is all right and your
[1:15:50] heart no condemnation your language
[1:15:53] speaks a certain way a person can feel
[1:15:55] this is a free person this is the person
[1:15:58] that is not under
[1:15:59] bondage can we say praise the
[1:16:02] Lord all right language from servants to
[1:16:07] Sons because it's different this this
[1:16:10] message come we believe we're in the
[1:16:12] adoption season how many of you believe
[1:16:14] that I believe that with all of my heart
[1:16:16] we in that time now of the maturing of
[1:16:18] the Bride let me just read a few things
[1:16:21] to you if you don't mind uh
[1:16:25] which I have a lot here but let me just
[1:16:27] I want to just show you something if the
[1:16:28] Lord would just help us this come from
[1:16:32] uh uh adoption part three and and and
[1:16:37] this sticks out to me he said Jesus was
[1:16:39] training 12
[1:16:41] men that through those 12 men was to
[1:16:44] take the gospel to the world he said
[1:16:47] father for their sake I sanctify myself
[1:16:51] make yourself for your neighbor's sake
[1:16:53] for somebody else's sake don't use your
[1:16:55] Liberty for a cloak said
[1:16:57] Paul but sanctify yourself behave
[1:17:00] yourself in the neighborhood like a real
[1:17:03] Christian ought to let your
[1:17:05] communication be if you meet your enemy
[1:17:07] sanctify yourself for his sake not
[1:17:10] knowing what you might do now the
[1:17:13] placing the sun first thing after the
[1:17:16] son was in he became a son but then we
[1:17:20] find out his behavior is what set him to
[1:17:24] adoption whether he behaved right or not
[1:17:27] so Behavior has a lot to do do with
[1:17:30] adoption which would be character can we
[1:17:33] say praise the Lord but I want to just
[1:17:35] point out something when he make the
[1:17:37] statement Jesus was training the 12 all
[1:17:40] of the time when Jesus the disciple was
[1:17:43] walking with him he was training them
[1:17:45] because he knew they going to have to
[1:17:47] carry on the work after he depart they
[1:17:50] are going to be the one to be the
[1:17:52] representatives of him so he had to
[1:17:54] train them to be exactly the way he want
[1:17:57] them to be can we say praise the Lord
[1:17:59] you see what happened God had to send a
[1:18:02] prophet in this day to bring us back to
[1:18:04] the true revealed word the life of the
[1:18:07] word can we say amen he had to do that
[1:18:09] first knowing that there's going to be
[1:18:12] Ministries to come after that that's why
[1:18:14] the prophet said it's important to only
[1:18:17] say what the messenger had said because
[1:18:19] we're identified with him that's why we
[1:18:22] don't add don't take away because the
[1:18:24] pattern has been
[1:18:26] laid so all these things is trainings
[1:18:29] even in brother benham's life his
[1:18:31] failures his faults all of that was just
[1:18:34] training can we say man his ups and down
[1:18:37] training you see in the midst of his
[1:18:39] ministry how he began to listen to
[1:18:41] different men and get himself in trouble
[1:18:43] with God he leared from those things can
[1:18:46] me say Amen but you will find after the
[1:18:49] seals you don't find brother Brandon
[1:18:51] being persuaded by men
[1:18:53] worried about the feelings of man he
[1:18:55] been through those things but that was
[1:18:56] just a part of his training can we say
[1:18:59] praise the Lord and we go through those
[1:19:01] exact same things of training amen but
[1:19:04] when he talked about the disciples amen
[1:19:06] training the 12 I want to just go if you
[1:19:11] will uh let's go to
[1:19:16] markise the Lord if I can find it right
[1:19:21] quick
[1:19:23] we'll read a few scriptures
[1:19:26] here y'all just really pray for me
[1:19:28] because sometimes it get
[1:19:31] pretty difficult with vision but we keep
[1:19:34] pressing
[1:19:36] on just like now my scripture
[1:19:40] um I want um I think it's
[1:19:44] Mark uh hold on one
[1:19:49] second matter of fact it's
[1:19:51] Matthew let's go to Matthew
[1:20:06] 16 Matthew 16 I want to go to I don't
[1:20:10] even think that's my I'm
[1:20:21] sorry
[1:20:24] I'm looking for the scripture when he
[1:20:25] fed the 5000 but it's a certain one I'm
[1:20:28] looking for y'all ain't in no hurry are
[1:20:31] you just pray for
[1:20:39] me Matthew
[1:20:42] 14 let's try that
[1:20:47] one want it go to Matthew
[1:20:51] 14
[1:20:55] and let's go down to uh verse
[1:21:04] 14 I always go to this scripture for a
[1:21:07] reason and uh to
[1:21:10] show how when brother Brandon said he
[1:21:13] was training his
[1:21:14] disciples I take this personally when it
[1:21:17] deals with Ministry because Ministry is
[1:21:21] important every one of us ought to be
[1:21:24] thankful when you have a pastor that'll
[1:21:26] stay with this
[1:21:28] message and has a balance of this
[1:21:31] message you ought to be very grateful
[1:21:34] and thankful cuz those things are
[1:21:36] sometimes very rare where somebody can
[1:21:38] has have a balance of this word and uh I
[1:21:41] appreciate brother Ben he's a he's a
[1:21:44] he's a young fell but he thinks
[1:21:48] old I'm saying that with a compliment I
[1:21:51] listen to his language I say he thinks
[1:21:53] old but that's I praise the Lord I thank
[1:21:55] God for that that means maturity because
[1:21:59] maturity what matures you is the word is
[1:22:02] that right you see when when you when
[1:22:04] you come to things in the scripture now
[1:22:06] my mind is going everywhere now when you
[1:22:08] come to things in the scripture we got
[1:22:10] to understand the terminology even Jesus
[1:22:13] when uh remember when they brought the
[1:22:15] children to Jesus they brought children
[1:22:17] to them and the disciples tried to
[1:22:19] discourage that Jesus didn't like that
[1:22:22] Jesus said except you come as a child
[1:22:24] you can't even get into the kingdom he
[1:22:26] he he he he applied using a child about
[1:22:29] getting into the kingdom why didn't he
[1:22:31] say
[1:22:32] teenager why didn't he say adult he said
[1:22:35] a child he used that for a reason
[1:22:38] because a child and he used the nature
[1:22:41] of a child because a child want to learn
[1:22:44] a child want to receive so that's what
[1:22:46] he used we got to approach Jesus as a
[1:22:49] child see in the Bible language how God
[1:22:53] looks at maturity is different the way
[1:22:55] we look at maturity because sometimes in
[1:22:58] spiritual things a man can think he's a
[1:23:00] man but yet he's a I mean an adult but
[1:23:03] yet he's in a child and then you find
[1:23:06] God would put a child in an adult
[1:23:09] situation for instance Josiah was 8
[1:23:11] years old God let him be a king Daniel
[1:23:15] was 14 years old carried down into
[1:23:17] Babylon but look how mature Daniel was
[1:23:20] you remember the prophet said Daniel
[1:23:22] when he went down in Babylon he was
[1:23:24] between the age of 12 and 14 but look
[1:23:27] what Daniel was able to do he said OED
[1:23:29] from his family don't have a church to
[1:23:31] go to but he sat down in Babylon with
[1:23:33] one quote book The Book of Jeremiah and
[1:23:37] he overcame Babylon Babylon was not in
[1:23:40] Daniel Daniel was in Babylon but Babylon
[1:23:42] never could get into him because he
[1:23:44] committed himself to one quote book and
[1:23:47] that brought him out of Babylon now if
[1:23:49] Daniel can take one book of Jeremiah and
[1:23:52] be Overcomer how about the over 12200
[1:23:54] messages that God have given us in this
[1:23:57] day we can overcome this l c and AG you
[1:24:00] see that's the way God looks at things
[1:24:02] amen can be a child but now I like even
[1:24:06] in the scripture as you go down Jeremiah
[1:24:08] he was a young man in the time of Josiah
[1:24:11] Jeremiah wasn't old he was around 18 but
[1:24:14] look what God did at that age said I
[1:24:16] have placed you over the
[1:24:19] Nations when you look at those things
[1:24:21] young people out to Jo that you don't
[1:24:23] have to wait to get old to get a
[1:24:25] commission from God you don't have to
[1:24:26] wait to get old to start timeing to ser
[1:24:28] and God can take hold to your life at a
[1:24:31] very young age God can do
[1:24:34] that and he done that amen and then you
[1:24:37] find all down through the scripture how
[1:24:40] he used young people put them in adult
[1:24:42] situations and then when Paul talked to
[1:24:44] the Hebrews which was Men He said you
[1:24:47] are like children you the one need to be
[1:24:50] taught you're a bunch of babies not Paul
[1:24:53] calling grown men babies that's Bible
[1:24:56] language let me tell you something
[1:24:58] brother and sister I always come as a
[1:24:59] child when you're dealing with the Lord
[1:25:01] Jesus Christ let me tell you a person
[1:25:03] can sit in church all their life and be
[1:25:06] 60 70 years old and then when God
[1:25:08] finally touched their heart when they
[1:25:11] come down to the altar they can't come
[1:25:13] to the altar as a man they'll have to
[1:25:15] come as a child and say father here am I
[1:25:19] speak to me I'm learning I need
[1:25:22] something
[1:25:23] that's how you and I got to praise God
[1:25:24] we have to face God the same way as a
[1:25:27] child when You Face God as a child when
[1:25:29] he anoint you give you your answer
[1:25:31] you'll walk away like a
[1:25:33] [Applause]
[1:25:34] man amen that's how he does things but
[1:25:38] we are called for a time of
[1:25:41] maturity excuse
[1:25:46] me let me slow down just a little
[1:25:51] bit and here in the
[1:25:56] scripture let's go down to verse 14
[1:25:58] Jesus went forth saw a great
[1:26:01] multitude and was moved with compassion
[1:26:03] toward them and he healed their
[1:26:07] sick and when it was evening his
[1:26:09] disciples came to him saying this is a
[1:26:12] desert place and the time is now passed
[1:26:16] send the multitude away that they may go
[1:26:18] into the villages and by themselves
[1:26:21] victuals verse 16 but Jesus said unto
[1:26:24] them they need not depart give you them
[1:26:27] to eat isn't that
[1:26:30] interesting Jesus telling them you feed
[1:26:33] those people he's telling them to do
[1:26:36] something he know they can't
[1:26:42] do he's training them he know they can't
[1:26:45] do it but he said give them something to
[1:26:46] eat what was Jesus doing he's dealing
[1:26:49] with Ministry letting the Ministry know
[1:26:53] up front you can't feed the
[1:26:57] people you can't do it watch his next
[1:27:01] step can me say
[1:27:03] amen he
[1:27:05] said and they said unto
[1:27:08] him we have but here but Five Loaves two
[1:27:12] fishes he said bring them hither to me
[1:27:15] otherwise Jesus know they can't feed the
[1:27:18] people then they show Jesus this is all
[1:27:20] I got then he said now give me what you
[1:27:24] got he's training the ministry can you
[1:27:27] say amen that's why when I come when I
[1:27:29] get the realization when I got
[1:27:32] understanding God I can't feed your
[1:27:34] people but you gave me a gift so now I'm
[1:27:38] going to give the gift back to you the
[1:27:40] same as they gave Jesus what they had we
[1:27:43] give the gift back to God can we say
[1:27:46] Amen now watch what Jesus does here it
[1:27:49] he commanded the multitude to sit down
[1:27:51] on the grass took the Five Loaves the
[1:27:53] two fishes and looking up to heaven he
[1:27:56] blast and break and gave the loaves to
[1:27:58] his disciples and the disciples to the
[1:28:00] multitude see the beauty of that when
[1:28:02] Jesus broke the laws he didn't give it
[1:28:04] to the people he give it to the
[1:28:07] disciples then the disciples to the
[1:28:09] multitude that's the same with Ministry
[1:28:11] God I can't feed your people but I give
[1:28:13] you the gift that you gave me back now
[1:28:15] you give me a message and I'll take what
[1:28:17] you give me and I'll give it to your
[1:28:19] people that's God changing in the
[1:28:21] ministry
[1:28:23] [Applause]
[1:28:25] that's why the prophet say every one of
[1:28:27] us got to master that human ability that
[1:28:30] we can do it we think we can handle it
[1:28:32] no we can't do nothing without him
[1:28:34] anointing us because God does not want
[1:28:37] you and me to be under uninspired
[1:28:39] headship uninspired leadership he want
[1:28:42] us to be uned by
[1:28:46] him praise the Lord and here's the
[1:28:49] beautiful part about it prise Lord
[1:28:52] as they fed the people verse 20 they did
[1:28:56] eat and were filled took up the the
[1:28:59] fragments that remained 12 basket full
[1:29:03] and they they had eaten were about 5,000
[1:29:05] men besides women and children this is
[1:29:08] what I love even most after the
[1:29:10] disciples done fed the people what Jesus
[1:29:12] gave them what Jesus multiplied they fed
[1:29:15] the people and then he says the
[1:29:18] straightway Jesus constrain his
[1:29:21] disciples to get into a ship and to go

[1:30:18] we as ministers begin to realize more
[1:30:20] and more and more I need something from

[1:30:27] own ways and my own thoughts I need

[1:31:10] with an
[1:31:11] angel this is not just for
[1:31:16] preachers hello look at the adoption
[1:31:20] message I when I first come the message
[1:31:22] I was taught that this really was for
[1:31:24] preachers but I found out that is not
[1:31:26] necessarily so how look what a prophet
[1:31:29] done even in the adoption message start
[1:31:32] talking about
[1:31:33] [Applause]
[1:31:36] Housewives me say Amen housewife putting
[1:31:39] things in there let you know every one
[1:31:41] of us got a position everyone of us got
[1:31:43] a place oh my friend think about it in
[1:31:46] that story the brother B told it was a
[1:31:48] woman sitting in a service God was
[1:31:50] telling her to pray pray for a child she
[1:31:52] wouldn't do it but God wouldn't stop
[1:31:55] pushing on her he kept pushing on her
[1:31:58] and then all of a sudden she said I'm
[1:31:59] sure she got a prayer call or whatever
[1:32:01] but God kept pressing and then what did
[1:32:04] God do she kept pressing the sister then
[1:32:06] she said sister can I pray for your
[1:32:09] child then she prayed for the child but
[1:32:12] then the woman still came to the prayer
[1:32:14] line when she came to the prayer line
[1:32:17] the prophet said your your child is okay
[1:32:20] he's already here said because that
[1:32:22] sister back there she said he said you
[1:32:25] didn't want to pray for her because of
[1:32:27] respect for me he said but you are a
[1:32:30] mother your prayer will be better than
[1:32:33] mine cuz you are a
[1:32:37] mother praise God so sisters has the
[1:32:41] part twoo but God want us to be in order
[1:32:44] so that character could be right so that
[1:32:46] power could be there so he can use us
[1:32:48] the way that he want to use us it takes
[1:32:50] maturing
[1:32:53] praise the
[1:32:55] Lord I love this placing manifest take
[1:32:59] him out there put a ceremony on him
[1:33:02] visit him with an
[1:33:04] angel tell him something now he's told
[1:33:08] the truth if he's just making up
[1:33:10] something it won't work that won't work
[1:33:13] we had a lot of that but I mean
[1:33:16] manifestation of sons of God when God
[1:33:20] manifest himself sends him out then he
[1:33:23] goes forth what he says is truth what he
[1:33:27] does is truth what he does he manifest
[1:33:30] Christ he said oh my that's the way it
[1:33:32] supposed to be when God send you when he
[1:33:35] send me he backs us up truth backs us up
[1:33:39] because we become ambassadors of Jesus
[1:33:41] Christ that's why we don't worry about
[1:33:42] what the circumstances are because our
[1:33:45] perfect faith will Master the
[1:33:46] circumstance when it try to comes up to
[1:33:49] [Applause]

[1:39:48] really you got to be kidding me haven't
[1:39:51] we talked about this haven't we been
[1:39:54] through this really that's a sign you're
[1:39:56] not growing because you're hearing
[1:40:04] repeats
[1:40:07] language it changes as we
[1:40:10] grow that's why God we see in the Bible
[1:40:13] All Through The
[1:40:14] Years Seven Seals it been been there all
[1:40:18] through the years Church age all that
[1:40:19] been laying there but no I didn't
[1:40:21] understood that language to this time am
[1:40:24] in the time of Wesley I mean in the time
[1:40:26] of Luther the just shall live by faith
[1:40:29] has always been written in the Bible but
[1:40:32] it came in a lot at time amen that God
[1:40:35] was there start a Reformation he
[1:40:37] anointed Luther then that word comes off
[1:40:40] the page he said the just shall live by
[1:40:43] faith but it always been
[1:40:45] there right then that became a language
[1:40:48] of that day but then the seven is the
[1:40:51] Revelation 10 always been in the Bible
[1:40:53] but in this time Thessalonians about the
[1:40:56] Rapture always been in the Bible but
[1:40:58] this is the age all of those scriptures
[1:41:00] have been magnified because God had to
[1:41:03] send a message to let you know it's time
[1:41:05] for the things that been written to step
[1:41:07] off of the page and step into a body of
[1:41:10] [Applause]
[1:41:17] Believers so the language
[1:41:19] changed
[1:41:21] what's so
[1:41:22] beautiful in
[1:41:25] Genesis in Genesis look at God's
[1:41:29] language all
[1:41:32] right he would say it's good it's very
[1:41:36] good that was all God's language how
[1:41:40] good things
[1:41:43] were God never asked a
[1:41:48] question until after the fall
[1:41:55] that's when his language
[1:41:58] change
[1:42:00] Adam where are
[1:42:03] you what have you
[1:42:06] done see let me tell you something when
[1:42:09] questions are asked many times is a sign
[1:42:12] somebody got something in their life is
[1:42:14] not
[1:42:15] right because the question are asked to
[1:42:18] get a person to respond back to see
[1:42:20] where they at when God said where are
[1:42:22] you Adam he knew exactly where Adam was
[1:42:25] but he was asking the question and
[1:42:27] asking Adam that question so Adam can
[1:42:29] say no not where your physical condition
[1:42:32] Adam not where your location at in the
[1:42:34] Garden of Eden but now Adam where are
[1:42:38] you
[1:42:39] spiritually what done happen Adam where
[1:42:42] are
[1:42:43] you God language
[1:42:46] changed first it was good very good let
[1:42:50] it bring for for but when the fall took
[1:42:52] place language
[1:42:54] changed oh yes are you with me same as
[1:42:58] Church sometime you see your pastor he
[1:43:00] come and preach so
[1:43:02] humble so nice you say oh what a
[1:43:07] pastor then you come like by the next
[1:43:09] service like he just mad at
[1:43:12] everybody he be like what happened no
[1:43:15] something don't happened in the church
[1:43:17] now God said let me change that language
[1:43:18] a little bit to get their attention
[1:43:22] [Music]
[1:43:28] can we go
[1:43:30] on after the fall that's when language
[1:43:34] change God began to tell Eve he no he
[1:43:37] began to tell her in gen Genesis 3 unto
[1:43:40] the woman he said I will greatly mify
[1:43:42] thy sorrow thy conception and sorrow
[1:43:45] thou shallal bring forth children and
[1:43:47] thy desire shall be to thy husband and
[1:43:50] he shall rule over thee really in verse
[1:43:52] 16 really in verse 16 a person should
[1:43:56] see serpent
[1:43:58] seed just in verse 16
[1:44:00] alone when people talk about want to
[1:44:03] know what happened in the Garden of Eden
[1:44:04] I don't just go straight say uh he had a
[1:44:07] relationship with a serpent I don't go
[1:44:09] there I ask them
[1:44:10] questions my question be I said can you
[1:44:13] answer this for me I said whatever it
[1:44:16] was whether is a fruit whatever took
[1:44:18] place can me you agree on something
[1:44:21] they say what I said children came
[1:44:25] forth
[1:44:27] they children you you're right I said
[1:44:31] God talking about
[1:44:33] conception they said that's right that's
[1:44:36] said you right children did whatever
[1:44:37] happened children came forth then I just
[1:44:39] flip it around so what fruit did they
[1:44:42] eat to make the children
[1:44:46] come then they begin to realize you
[1:44:48] can't eat a fruit to bring children
[1:44:53] ding it's that
[1:44:55] simple and we are thankful that we don't
[1:44:57] struggle with it we see it God revealed
[1:45:01] it to you but many struggle with that
[1:45:03] and the devil want them to struggle that
[1:45:05] cuz you can't catch the serpent seed you
[1:45:07] w you can't really clearly see the Plan
[1:45:10] of
[1:45:11] Redemption you won't be able to see it
[1:45:13] you won't be able to see the two Vines
[1:45:15] if you don't catch Genesis that's why
[1:45:17] the devil hates the Book of Genesis he
[1:45:19] don't want us to see his
[1:45:25] origin pray I just threw that one
[1:45:29] there turn me to John
[1:45:43] 13 John
[1:45:49] 13 I want y'all to just kind of go on a
[1:45:52] little journey with me in the scripture
[1:45:54] and then we'll bounce
[1:45:58] back wow I ain't even started 47
[1:46:02] minutes verse one now before the Feast
[1:46:06] of Passover when Jesus knew that his
[1:46:08] hour was come that he should depart out
[1:46:11] of this world into the father having
[1:46:13] loved his own which were in the world he
[1:46:16] loved them until the
[1:46:18] end supper being in it the devil having
[1:46:22] now put into the heart of Judas his
[1:46:24] carrier Simon's son to betray him
[1:46:27] friends don't take this likly even when
[1:46:29] we reading this before Judas betrayed
[1:46:32] Jesus look at the scripture verse two it
[1:46:35] said it put it in his
[1:46:36] heart are you with me we we that'll get
[1:46:39] a little more uh clear in a moment
[1:46:42] because let me tell you I'll tell
[1:46:44] anybody when something comes into your
[1:46:46] heart in this eror you need to get it
[1:46:49] out that's right because once it get
[1:46:53] into when it come from the Mind get in
[1:46:55] the mind drop to the heart that's a
[1:46:57] problem and if you don't get it out of
[1:46:59] the heart you'll fulfill whatever was
[1:47:02] planted see that's how Spirits work
[1:47:04] don't play with them when you know
[1:47:06] something is wrong cast it down don't
[1:47:08] reason around it don't play with it
[1:47:10] wrong is wrong stay away from it that's
[1:47:13] why the prophet just gave us Lord have
[1:47:15] mercy he gave us the simple conclusion
[1:47:17] how to solve a problem he said if you
[1:47:20] got a question about it don't do
[1:47:25] it that's simple see the message is so
[1:47:28] simple to people stumble but the answers
[1:47:31] are so
[1:47:32] simple pise Lord verse verse three Jesus
[1:47:37] knowing that the father had given him
[1:47:39] all things into his hand and that he had
[1:47:41] come from God and went to God verse 10
[1:47:45] Jesus said unto him he that is washed
[1:47:48] needed not Sav to wash his feet but it's
[1:47:51] clean everywh and you are clean but not
[1:47:54] all I want you to watch Jesus language
[1:47:56] now he's talking to his disciples but
[1:47:59] his language he's telling them you you
[1:48:01] you you you clean but not all because
[1:48:04] Jesus knew Judas was there the disciples
[1:48:07] they had no clue what was going on but
[1:48:09] we understand now because we can see the
[1:48:12] language how Jesus is using it watch
[1:48:15] this verse 11 for he knew who should
[1:48:18] betray him therefore said he you are not
[1:48:21] all clean now let's go to verse
[1:48:24] 26 Jesus answered he it is to whom I
[1:48:27] shall give so when I have dipped it when
[1:48:30] he had dipped the sock he gave it to
[1:48:33] Judas is carried the sonon son of son he
[1:48:36] already giv them a sign right in front
[1:48:38] of f who it is sitting right in front of
[1:48:40] him but then verse
[1:48:42] 27 after the S Satan entered into him
[1:48:48] notice now the devil don't entered in
[1:48:51] first he put it in his heart now the
[1:48:53] devil don't entered in so that's why you
[1:48:56] got to be careful about the wrong
[1:48:57] thoughts and things don't let them drop
[1:49:02] down can we say praise the lord lord
[1:49:05] just got to be very very
[1:49:11] careful I'll get back to there another
[1:49:13] thought came but we'll get back to that
[1:49:17] listen verse 27 he said after the
[1:49:20] after the SOP Satan entered into him
[1:49:24] then said Jesus to him that thou doest
[1:49:27] doest
[1:49:29] quickly no man at the table knew for
[1:49:32] what intent he spake this thing unto him
[1:49:35] for some of them thought because Judas
[1:49:37] had the bag that Jesus had said unto him
[1:49:40] byy those things which thou have need
[1:49:42] against the feast that he should give
[1:49:45] something to the poor see you can come
[1:49:47] up all kind of ideas when you don't
[1:49:49] understand what the Lord is doing
[1:49:51] he did hav received the sock went
[1:49:52] immediately out watch the scripture said
[1:49:56] and it was
[1:49:59] night God is putting a scenery let us
[1:50:02] know at the time that the Betrayal take
[1:50:05] place in judah's heart is a night
[1:50:09] time can we say Amen now aren we in the
[1:50:12] darkest age so we're in the darkest age
[1:50:16] in the darkest time so that's why in
[1:50:18] this age it'll have to be a betrayal
[1:50:21] again of the revealed
[1:50:27] word something
[1:50:29] happened when Judas
[1:50:33] left something changed when Judas left
[1:50:37] and I'm going to show you in scripture
[1:50:39] when Judas left Jesus
[1:50:43] language
[1:50:47] changed and it was for a reason
[1:50:51] when Judas left
[1:50:54] Jesus Jesus could
[1:50:56] not well Jesus could not say let not
[1:51:00] your heart be
[1:51:01] troubled you believe in God believe in
[1:51:03] me so I go prepare a place for you Jesus
[1:51:07] could not say that as long as Judas was
[1:51:11] there cuz he would have been
[1:51:17] lying when Judas left
[1:51:21] Jesus language changed to talk to his
[1:51:24] elect he spoke a language to his elect
[1:51:28] that he could not speak to
[1:51:30] Judas Hall are y'all with me some of you
[1:51:35] are I can tell some of you I'm I'm close
[1:51:39] keep going just keep going I'll get it
[1:51:42] I'll get it just hang on because this is
[1:51:44] important how God is speaking to his
[1:51:47] bride now he's speaking to his bride now
[1:51:50] in a personal intimate relationship he
[1:51:53] talking to you
[1:51:54] [Music]
[1:51:56] individually that's why God got to get
[1:51:58] things out of your life get F people out
[1:52:00] of your life certain situations out of
[1:52:02] your life so he can speak to you give
[1:52:04] you another
[1:52:06] [Applause]
[1:52:11] language John
[1:52:15] 13 oh Lord verse 31 where we at listen
[1:52:22] therefore when he was gone out
[1:52:27] Judas Jesus said now is the son of man
[1:52:32] glorified and God is glorified in him if
[1:52:37] God be glorified in him God shall also
[1:52:40] glorify him in himself and shall
[1:52:43] straightway glorify him verse 33 Jesus
[1:52:47] said little children
[1:52:51] he couldn't say that when Judas was
[1:52:53] there Judas is not his
[1:52:58] [Applause]
[1:53:00] child his language changed cuz Judas had
[1:53:03] to go are you getting it friends you can
[1:53:06] hear all kind of voices but God want to
[1:53:08] speak to you but he got to get certain
[1:53:10] voices out of your life certain
[1:53:11] situations out of your life so he can
[1:53:13] speak to
[1:53:14] [Applause]
[1:53:18] you yeah a little while I'm with you you
[1:53:21] shall seek me and as I said unto the
[1:53:24] Jews where I go you cannot come so now I
[1:53:27] say unto you now let's go to John 14 all
[1:53:31] the things that I'm reading if you just
[1:53:33] take all of the scriptures when Judas
[1:53:36] left and then take all the read all of
[1:53:39] the scriptures in between until the time
[1:53:41] that he came and brought them roing them
[1:53:44] soldiers to Jesus in the garden just
[1:53:46] read all them chapters in there Jesus
[1:53:48] language is actually different he's
[1:53:51] talking to
[1:53:55] elect verse 14 John 14 let not your
[1:53:59] heart be trouble you believe in God
[1:54:02] believe also in me in my father's house
[1:54:05] are many manions if it was not so I
[1:54:08] would have told you I go prepare a place
[1:54:11] for you he couldn't tell Judas that now
[1:54:14] there is a place prepared for the devil
[1:54:16] but the one he's talking about is not
[1:54:18] for Judas
[1:54:21] and if I go and prepare a place for you
[1:54:24] I will come again receive you un myself
[1:54:27] that where I am there you may be also
[1:54:30] that's the language to the
[1:54:34] [Applause]
[1:54:37] elect verse
[1:54:39] 12 verily verily I say un to you he that
[1:54:42] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:54:45] shall he do also Greater Works than
[1:54:47] shall he do because I go into my father
[1:54:50] and whatsoever you ask in my name that
[1:54:52] will I do that the father may be
[1:54:54] glorified in the son if you shall ask
[1:54:57] anything in my name I will do it he
[1:55:00] couldn't tell Judas this kind of
[1:55:05] language are you with me jump to verse

[1:56:14] of
[1:56:15] Israel when Pharaoh persecuted the
[1:56:18] children of Israel you you know what
[1:56:19] made Pharaoh mad the Bible said the more
[1:56:22] they persecuted him the more they
[1:56:25] grew I want to be the exact same way the
[1:56:27] more problems the devil give me the more
[1:56:30] I want to go to church the more I want
[1:56:31] to pray the more I want to do the work
[1:56:33] of God I want to grow the devil cannot
[1:56:37] stand

[1:56:42] growth
[1:56:44] [Music]
[1:56:47] amen John 15:14 I'm sorry
[1:56:52] one Lord I love this verse
[1:56:57] three he now you are
[1:57:00] clean through the word which I have
[1:57:02] spoken un
[1:57:04] you abide in me and I in you Judas is
[1:57:10] not
[1:57:12] there
[1:57:14] HL cuz Jesus know I'm not going to abide
[1:57:16] in you you ain't going to abide in me he
[1:57:18] some my language is to the
[1:57:21] elect this message is for the
[1:57:24] elect that's why we understand the
[1:57:26] language of this
[1:57:29] message praise the
[1:57:31] Lord let's jump down to verse
[1:57:36] 14 you are my
[1:57:39] friends if you do whatsoever I command
[1:57:43] you for I call you not
[1:57:48] servants
[1:57:51] let's go back to
[1:57:53] galatian you're no longer servant you're
[1:57:58] Sons why is he telling them that now he
[1:58:00] said you get ready to change of
[1:58:01] dispensation now from a servant attitude
[1:58:06] to a son attitude which is a bit
[1:58:08] different he couldn't tell Judas
[1:58:12] that I just love this
[1:58:14] friend for the servant knoweth not what
[1:58:19] his Lord do
[1:58:21] it but I have called you friends for all
[1:58:24] things that I have heard of my fathers I
[1:58:27] have made known unto you aren't you
[1:58:29] thankful for that God don't make
[1:58:31] everything known to his elect why do God
[1:58:34] make things known to us because we're
[1:58:36] the children of Abraham when God
[1:58:39] promised Abraham when he was getting
[1:58:40] ready to destroy solom he said can I
[1:58:42] hide anything from Abraham the things
[1:58:45] that I'm about to do by you and I being
[1:58:47] children of Abraham if he didn't hide
[1:58:49] nothing from Abraham he won't hide
[1:58:51] nothing from you and me because we are
[1:58:53] the hirs can we say Amen he'll reveal
[1:58:56] everything to us that's why the books
[1:58:57] has to been open the seals had to be
[1:58:59] released he said I want you to know
[1:59:01] [Applause]
[1:59:03] everything can me say Amen a servant
[1:59:07] can't be a Heir a son can only be an
[1:59:12] heir that's why Abraham when God was
[1:59:15] talking to Abraham go Abraham said he
[1:59:18] said uh who where's my Heir he's the
[1:59:20] only one I got it the servant El as God
[1:59:23] said
[1:59:24] no your servant will not be your Heir
[1:59:27] but the one that comes from your own
[1:59:29] lungs would be your Heir that's why only
[1:59:32] your son can be an heir then when
[1:59:35] Abraham departed his Goods the Bible
[1:59:38] says he gave everything to Isaac but to
[1:59:40] the concubines he gave gifts but to ask
[1:59:44] Isaac he gave all that's why the
[1:59:46] churches they got gifts they got
[1:59:49] Miracles they got signs they got wonders
[1:59:51] but the bride got it all God had given
[1:59:54] everything to the Bride of Jesus
[1:59:55] [Applause]
[1:59:57] Christ
[1:59:59] [Music]
[2:00:01] amen he giv us everything he didn't hold
[2:00:04] nothing back he give it all people talk
[2:00:08] about yeah the the lid been torn out of
[2:00:10] hell but Heaven has also been emptied
[2:00:13] [Applause]
[2:00:16] too so Jesus language
[2:00:19] it
[2:00:20] changed because of the
[2:00:23] circumstance the same with you young
[2:00:25] people you'll know where you at by your
[2:00:28] parents
[2:00:33] language God praise the
[2:00:38] Lord let me drop this in young
[2:00:41] people be
[2:00:45] honest never tell a
[2:00:47] lie be honest I say this all the time
[2:00:50] but let's be
[2:00:52] honest cuz it'll take you it it honesty
[2:00:55] cause pain even honesty sometimes
[2:00:57] calleda disappointment but honest is
[2:01:00] Still
[2:01:01] Honest anybody that got any dignity at
[2:01:04] all will respect
[2:01:08] honesty whether you like it or not you
[2:01:10] respect honesty well at least you were
[2:01:14] honest brother B even said this he said
[2:01:18] well you don't like me
[2:01:19] he said what can I do to help you like
[2:01:21] me that's a mature man what do we say
[2:01:25] you don't like me that's your
[2:01:28] problem but look how mature he was he
[2:01:30] what can I do to help you like
[2:01:37] me praise the
[2:01:41] lord we talking about from servant to
[2:01:45] son yes it takes a character change
[2:01:49] God want to see himself in you and me he
[2:01:53] don't want to see other he want to see
[2:01:54] himself being reflected through you and
[2:02:00] me I want to go back to John 6 for a
[2:02:07] moment if you notice in John 6 Judas was
[2:02:13] there in verse 70 John 670 Jesus
[2:02:17] answered them have not I chosen you
[2:02:21] 12 and one of you is a
[2:02:24] devil now Judas is there now go to John
[2:02:28] 16 Judas is not
[2:02:34] there I want you to notice what he says
[2:02:40] yes we got to go backwards
[2:02:46] first don't John 15 I'm sorry
[2:02:50] and John 6 Judas was there he have I not
[2:02:52] chosen
[2:02:53] you he said but when one of you a devil
[2:02:58] but in John
[2:02:59] 15:16 he says you have not chosen me but
[2:03:03] I have chosen you notice it's more words
[2:03:07] though and ordain
[2:03:10] you that you should go and bring for
[2:03:13] fruit and that your fruit should remain
[2:03:16] he couldn't tell Judas that he let and
[2:03:19] Judas was there he said I chosen you and
[2:03:22] one of you a devil but when Judas is
[2:03:23] gone he said but I ordained you for a
[2:03:28] purpose total different
[2:03:34] language can we go a little
[2:03:40] further
[2:03:44] Lord the Bible
[2:03:47] says go with me to Proverbs
[2:04:00] 29 let's go to verse
[2:04:04] 16 it said when the wicked are
[2:04:07] multiplied transgressions increase but
[2:04:10] brandom used the scripture here in the
[2:04:12] message the ark he that's why he said
[2:04:14] cities the bigger the cities the more
[2:04:17] sin because it's more people people
[2:04:20] there but the righteous shall see their
[2:04:22] fall verse 17 17 correct thy
[2:04:27] son and he shall give thee
[2:04:30] rest yeah he shall give Delight unto thy
[2:04:33] Soul now remember when we read the
[2:04:36] scripture when it say correct thy son
[2:04:38] that also means sons and daughters so we
[2:04:40] can't be say oh all thing we supposed to
[2:04:42] do is correct man no it means
[2:04:45] both but he said correct thy son and he
[2:04:48] shall give thee rest rest why what makes
[2:04:51] it when you correct the son you correct
[2:04:53] the daughter what gives you the rest is
[2:04:56] when they receive the correction and
[2:04:58] they learned from that correction and
[2:05:00] now you see them growing that gives you
[2:05:02] rest you say now they are growing and I
[2:05:05] see that's right cuz there's nothing
[2:05:07] trouble a parent more when they see
[2:05:09] their child they can't see where the
[2:05:11] child actually at and they struggling
[2:05:13] and that that that that's that that
[2:05:15] troubles a parent cuz we want to know
[2:05:17] where the child what's going on what's
[2:05:19] going on that's what we want to know but
[2:05:21] in those times that's when Faith need to
[2:05:23] be high to realize go back to what the
[2:05:26] prophet said amen the same faith that
[2:05:28] you have for your salvation just applied
[2:05:31] to your
[2:05:33] family those things are hard to do but
[2:05:35] if you do what he said it'll happen God
[2:05:37] will save him how he's going to do it I
[2:05:39] don't know but he'll do it see some of
[2:05:42] you young people hearing me pleading for
[2:05:44] parents now you might be one in one
[2:05:46] causing them to go through something but
[2:05:48] let let me tell you something when you
[2:05:49] get older when you get children they
[2:05:51] start acting up you'll come back to the
[2:05:56] sermon that's why I tell young people

[2:15:07] word of God lord show me my purpose what
[2:15:11] you want me to be I want to be a
[2:15:16] man
[2:15:21] can I just show y'all some uh I'm just
[2:15:24] going to go through some quick examples
[2:15:25] of what a servant versus son
[2:15:27] is because you got to go back to galti
[2:15:30] it said the son
[2:15:33] differ nothing than a
[2:15:36] servant until the appointed time of the
[2:15:40] father because his attitude his maturity
[2:15:43] got to come for sunship and he Chang see
[2:15:47] what what you can do I'm asking a lot of
[2:15:49] question saying a lot of things when you
[2:15:51] can see transition from servant attitude
[2:15:54] to son attitude cuz it's a big
[2:15:58] different the difference between the
[2:16:00] sons and servants y'all just follow
[2:16:04] them Sons will build a house servants
[2:16:08] simply serve in a
[2:16:10] house a servant attitude I'm just an
[2:16:14] usher that's all I
[2:16:16] am but a son would say the church is of
[2:16:19] God I will assure that every need of the
[2:16:21] pastor and the people is met to the best
[2:16:23] of my ability but a servant attitude why
[2:16:26] I got to do
[2:16:29] it a son attitude will see something
[2:16:31] that need to be done need to be done and
[2:16:36] go do it but a servant will see the need
[2:16:39] but he'll sit back and wait for somebody
[2:16:41] else to do
[2:16:46] it it kind of like siblings and you got
[2:16:48] a couple of siblings the parent ask one
[2:16:50] of them to do something why why he can't
[2:16:51] do
[2:16:53] it why I always got to do why you can't
[2:16:55] get there they ask you to do it just do
[2:16:58] it see that's a servant
[2:17:01] attitude but when it's a son the parent
[2:17:04] a got to ask cuz he already don't seen
[2:17:06] it so let me take care of
[2:17:09] that Daddy come home said who did that I
[2:17:13] was just going to do that so I got I did
[2:17:15] it Daddy That's my boy
[2:17:21] I don't know how it is here but back in
[2:17:23] the States you get a lot of bar to cut
[2:17:24] grass as long as you got a ride in
[2:17:32] lawnmower let me tell you God know how
[2:17:34] to Humble you
[2:17:35] friends he humbled me all time I
[2:17:38] remember one time I got a new
[2:17:40] lawnmower rod and Lawn more you couldn't
[2:17:43] tell me
[2:17:45] nothing it's called a scy
[2:17:49] I even cut the neighbor's
[2:17:52] grass I got out there and cutting the
[2:17:54] neighbor's grass cuz you know that was a
[2:17:56] little sickly I'm just cutting the
[2:17:59] grass I got off the lwn more take care
[2:18:02] of your neighbor I was just oh
[2:18:05] yeah and then while I was walking with
[2:18:08] my chest stuck up the Lord said if you
[2:18:11] had a riding lawnmower would you cut
[2:18:14] their
[2:18:15] grass I said
[2:18:22] I probably would said do you want to
[2:18:24] borrow the lwn more cut your grass see
[2:18:26] it was easy to do it with the
[2:18:29] writer but when something a little more
[2:18:31] personal will I do
[2:18:34] it sometimes we want to take we want to
[2:18:37] say we sacrificed and we done something
[2:18:39] because it was
[2:18:41] easy we was able to do it you say I
[2:18:44] really done something no sacrifices when
[2:18:46] you ain't even got it to do do it but
[2:18:47] you still do it it's just like the Widow
[2:18:50] what she do she gave her
[2:18:56] all are we all
[2:18:59] right how many you can give me five more
[2:19:02] minutes how many you can give me five
[2:19:04] more minutes 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 40
[2:19:10] oh I'm good I'm saying about 4
[2:19:16] hours bring it up
[2:19:21] friend we have to
[2:19:30] grow a
[2:19:32] son a son
[2:19:38] attitude he would say this need to be
[2:19:42] done why not I I need to do it why not
[2:19:45] why I can't do it I'll do it that what
[2:19:47] the son would do but a servant would say
[2:19:49] that ain't my
[2:19:52] job that ain't my job why I got to do
[2:19:55] it are you with me just keep following
[2:19:58] them
[2:20:01] down when you dealing with even
[2:20:04] Ministry when a preacher got a servant
[2:20:07] attitude he'll try to reach for a
[2:20:11] Ministry to make something happen but a
[2:20:14] son await for his ministry
[2:20:22] hello sons are
[2:20:24] sent servant just
[2:20:27] go a son is sent with a commission
[2:20:30] knowing what he doing but a servant is
[2:20:32] just go and hope he can figure out what
[2:20:33] he's doing but that's not a
[2:20:37] son a servant attitude will split a
[2:20:41] family over a disagreement of
[2:20:44] issues servants will attempt to draw
[2:20:47] people people to his or her side but
[2:20:50] sons are interested in the father's
[2:20:53] agenda rather than doing his own
[2:20:59] thing are you with me praise the Lord
[2:21:02] see Saul was nothing but a servant
[2:21:05] that's right but David was a
[2:21:08] son Saul was only interested what people
[2:21:11] could do for him but David was
[2:21:13] interested in what he could do for
[2:21:15] people that's why Samuel gave them the
[2:21:18] prophecy told them exactly what Saul was
[2:21:20] going to do go read the scripture he
[2:21:22] told them everything if you look he said
[2:21:24] he'll make your son your daughters
[2:21:26] confiar he'll take the goodness of your
[2:21:29] cross he'll do all of this for himself
[2:21:31] and his servants it don't say nothing
[2:21:33] about what Saul would do for the people
[2:21:36] it's everything what the people do for
[2:21:37] Saul see that's a Saul Spirit you always
[2:21:40] want what people do for me for me for me
[2:21:42] but what about what you can do for
[2:21:43] someone else the prophet of God said
[2:21:46] eternal life is is living for somebody
[2:21:53] else a servant is all about me me me me
[2:21:56] me mine mine mine mine but a son know we
[2:22:04] ours so you can have a servant spirit in
[2:22:06] a
[2:22:07] marriage or a son spirit in a
[2:22:10] marriage servant spirit in the mar is
[2:22:13] all about you hurt
[2:22:15] me my feeling
[2:22:17] look how you treat me this look but
[2:22:19] never look how they treat the
[2:22:23] other but a sunship spirit in the
[2:22:25] marriage did I do anything offend you
[2:22:27] what can I do to help you oh my wife
[2:22:29] looking right at
[2:22:33] me I got no problem preaching these
[2:22:35] things from my wife cuz I got nothing to
[2:22:39] hide see the servant Spirit son Spirit
[2:22:42] can be in church marriage personal life
[2:22:46] it can run all the way
[2:22:48] [Music]
[2:22:53] down almost done a son is always
[2:22:57] interested in the father's AG
[2:22:59] jend sons are privileged
[2:23:03] servants sons have privilege they
[2:23:06] understand what their privilege is but a
[2:23:08] servant will always fight for
[2:23:12] rights you would never find David
[2:23:14] fighting for the
[2:23:16] throne
[2:23:17] cuz he know God gave it to him that's
[2:23:20] why he would give it up absolon him act
[2:23:22] up David just take off and go why he
[2:23:24] knew why should I fight for something
[2:23:27] when God said it was
[2:23:28] [Music]
[2:23:31] mine can we say amen that's the same as
[2:23:34] the Bride of Jesus Christ the devil I
[2:23:36] know what's mine so the devil can't take
[2:23:37] it
[2:23:38] away cuz we know what's been given to us
[2:23:42] can we say Amen we don't got to push
[2:23:44] ourself in some kind of position God put
[2:23:46] us in that
[2:23:49] position listen friends the more to much
[2:23:53] is given much is required right when
[2:23:56] your life grows you get add-ons in your
[2:23:59] life right I'm trying my best to
[2:24:08] quit when you grow addon come in your
[2:24:12] life when you're
[2:24:14] single if a man is single he can't say
[2:24:16] I'm a
[2:24:19] husband he can't rightfully have that
[2:24:22] title but when he gets married a title
[2:24:26] adds to his
[2:24:27] name
[2:24:30] husband girl wife
[2:24:35] right and way family structure
[2:24:38] is when something add to your life it
[2:24:41] adds to the family
[2:24:43] structure cuz when you become husband
[2:24:46] wife your parents become
[2:24:51] in-law right so it's adding to family
[2:24:55] structure now you're a husband and wife
[2:24:58] but you can't say
[2:25:00] parent cuz you got no
[2:25:02] baby but when the baby comes now you're
[2:25:06] parents right if you got siblings they
[2:25:09] become Aunts
[2:25:11] Uncles now the parents get another
[2:25:14] addition on their name Grand
[2:25:18] parents so the more you grow the more
[2:25:21] asss right praise the Lord the Apostle
[2:25:26] Paul you watch his ministry he'll say
[2:25:29] Paul servant of Jesus
[2:25:32] Christ then he'll say Paul Apostle of
[2:25:35] Jesus Christ he'll say Paul the age then
[2:25:39] he'll say
[2:25:40] Paul
[2:25:45] prisoner
[2:25:48] he realized as I'm growing I'm growing
[2:25:51] now I become a prisoner to the Lord
[2:25:55] Jesus
[2:25:56] Christ and then the prophet when he was
[2:25:58] preaching the seals he said I no longer
[2:26:02] call you church I call you
[2:26:06] [Applause]
[2:26:08] bride why it puts us up
[2:26:11] higher bride means a mature woman that
[2:26:15] come to a place have a husband Lord have
[2:26:19] mercy now I feel like
[2:26:23] preaching it's elevated in our lives
[2:26:26] where God had put us today no other age
[2:26:29] it been called
[2:26:30] bride been called church church but this
[2:26:33] age bride wife cuz this is the
[2:26:41] end Lord all
[2:26:44] right how much more time we got here
[2:26:51] you know being a
[2:27:03] son a son would
[2:27:05] build on a vision that his father gives
[2:27:08] him amen but the servant seek to build
[2:27:11] their own
[2:27:14] Vision the whole sum of adoption
[2:27:17] is being about the father's
[2:27:22] business that's the
[2:27:24] son I listen to brother Bron make a
[2:27:28] statement when he get up sometime he say
[2:27:31] Lord what would you have your servant to
[2:27:33] do
[2:27:35] today that's powerful to me I don't do
[2:27:38] that every
[2:27:39] day I
[2:27:41] don't but it should be that way
[2:27:43] Lord lead me today who you might have me
[2:27:47] to speak to uh witness to talk to would
[2:27:49] you help me Lord we're seeking we want
[2:27:52] to know what he wants us to do cuz our
[2:27:54] life is not our
[2:27:56] own are y'all with me this
[2:27:59] morning I'm what I'm speaking to you is
[2:28:03] bride
[2:28:04] language this don't work in
[2:28:07] denomination cuz they do whatever they
[2:28:08] want to do whatever they feel they Creed
[2:28:10] is that but the bride we can't be our
[2:28:14] own I'm closing when Paul said he was a
[2:28:18] prisoner to Jesus Christ if you go back
[2:28:21] to the message uh I think it's Paul a
[2:28:25] prisoner but B said Paul was sitting in
[2:28:28] the prison when he wrote
[2:28:31] that he said but what Paul did he be to
[2:28:35] look at Natural Things a prison life I
[2:28:39] can't go when I want to go can't leave
[2:28:41] when I want to go whatever they give me
[2:28:42] I have to take it he said then Paul went
[2:28:45] to another level with it
[2:28:47] he took it
[2:28:48] spiritually he said when he said when
[2:28:51] Paul wrote that he said I don't think
[2:28:53] Paul was talking about the prison that
[2:28:55] he was in he was relating to I am a
[2:28:59] prisoner of Jesus Christ yet I'm in a
[2:29:02] prison but not in this prison I am a
[2:29:04] prisoner to Jesus Christ he was able to
[2:29:06] take his surrounding and put it to
[2:29:08] himself to realize who he
[2:29:12] is somebody just asked me the question
[2:29:15] recently a trick
[2:29:18] question brother I'm
[2:29:21] confused aren't there Seven Ages I said
[2:29:25] yes why why are we preaching bride age
[2:29:29] see that's
[2:29:31] trick trying to find a trap in the
[2:29:33] message said I'm confused in my mind you
[2:29:36] ain't confused you just hope I can't
[2:29:39] answer your
[2:29:41] question I said listen brother let me
[2:29:44] explain something to you in brother
[2:29:47] Brandon's Ministry you first have to
[2:29:49] understand what he said he said each
[2:29:54] messenger comes at the end of their
[2:29:58] age didn't he say it he said they come
[2:30:01] at the end I said you got to understand
[2:30:04] his ministry I said he had to first come
[2:30:07] to the
[2:30:09] Pentecostals first I said brother
[2:30:12] Revelation three when Jesus was knocking
[2:30:15] at the door
[2:30:17] in the beginning of brother Brandon's
[2:30:18] Ministry that was that but when they
[2:30:21] rejected the ministry he's no longer
[2:30:23] knocking at the door he's saying come
[2:30:26] out cuz he's not trying to go in the
[2:30:28] pull amen he said come out of her my
[2:30:30] people he tried to when the prophet were
[2:30:33] going around the Pentecost trying to get
[2:30:34] them back to the word they rejected it
[2:30:37] right he said okay okay I said so
[2:30:39] brother when they reject it now it come
[2:30:41] to the other part of his ministry is to
[2:30:43] call out a bride I said let me tell you
[2:30:45] something friend I said the church age
[2:30:47] is all these things I but when it comes
[2:30:49] to the seal I said that ushers you and I
[2:30:51] to a bride
[2:30:53] age I said not only that brother we're
[2:30:56] in layer to sin
[2:30:57] age when you're not born again you are
[2:31:00] lay to sin I said but when I'm born
[2:31:02] again I'm ushering into a pride
[2:31:09] age that's why we're in this world but
[2:31:13] not of this world yes we supposed to be
[2:31:20] different if somebody was to ask you do
[2:31:23] you think you special do you know what
[2:31:25] your reply ought to be
[2:31:28] yes yes I am a royal priesthood I'm A
[2:31:32] peculiar people yes I am special in the
[2:31:36] eyes of God that's the attitude you're
[2:31:39] supposed to
[2:31:40] have and live above this
[2:31:45] world
[2:31:47] Hallelujah I guess got so much going on
[2:31:49] right
[2:31:51] now let me drop down I'm
[2:31:55] closing musician can come there'll help
[2:31:57] some of you
[2:32:00] out how many y'all know what the best
[2:32:02] Resurrection service are when the
[2:32:04] preacher say I'm F the
[2:32:07] clothes let some people alive in up
[2:32:09] about time musicians
[2:32:14] come praise the Lord
[2:32:19] only
[2:32:20] God could mature us to
[2:32:22] sunship the holy spirit it's nothing we
[2:32:25] can do ourself in galatian that's why it
[2:32:28] says it's the appointed time of the
[2:32:30] Father the Son could say Daddy I'm ready
[2:32:33] I'm ready for this Authority I'm ready
[2:32:35] for this position but no it's not in his
[2:32:39] hands it's in the father's
[2:32:45] hand I want to say
[2:32:51] something to the young
[2:32:54] people I I don't know what goes on up
[2:32:57] here I just know the devil is everywhere
[2:32:59] make no difference what country you go
[2:33:01] to the Devil he's
[2:33:05] everywhere but I do know this according
[2:33:08] to prophecy and according to scripture
[2:33:12] the way things are lined
[2:33:14] up some of the biggest
[2:33:16] issues young people have is
[2:33:19] movies
[2:33:22] music sexual things some of the biggest
[2:33:25] struggle have and they don't want to be
[2:33:26] honest about
[2:33:28] it but you truly be honest about
[2:33:33] it I rather for somebody to tell me a
[2:33:37] struggle that they have just be open
[2:33:39] with me instead of finding out some kind
[2:33:41] of way I just just be
[2:33:43] open are you with me but I'll say this
[2:33:47] to you you cannot play with
[2:33:51] spirits in the Book of
[2:33:54] Daniel when they was calling them to
[2:33:57] come to worship to the image of the
[2:33:58] Beast I mean the image that they had
[2:34:01] built what brought the
[2:34:04] call was
[2:34:07] music when you
[2:34:09] hear the sounds of the plasy the Tumo
[2:34:13] the trumpet did ads
[2:34:17] all kinds of
[2:34:18] music then you
[2:34:21] come that still is a part of the
[2:34:24] day even in the prophet when he had a
[2:34:27] vision of the bride and America they
[2:34:30] both was dancing yes to music one to
[2:34:34] rock and roll one was marching arm with
[2:34:37] Christian soier music plays a very part
[2:34:40] in this end
[2:34:42] time Hitler himself said give me the
[2:34:47] music that youth listening to and I'll
[2:34:49] gr I can win the youth he understand the
[2:34:53] power of it that's that stuff is nothing
[2:34:56] to play
[2:34:57] with that's why you go to different
[2:34:59] places music they play now back in my
[2:35:02] days you go to a shopping center they
[2:35:05] used to play instrumental
[2:35:07] music but now they play all kinds in
[2:35:11] there and then you could find yourself
[2:35:14] going home and just sitting at home not
[2:35:17] even thinking about it and your fingers
[2:35:19] start
[2:35:20] tapping or be in a restaurant your
[2:35:22] fingers start tapping then you catch
[2:35:24] yourself because science says
[2:35:27] this music is the only thing that can
[2:35:30] invade your subconscious without your
[2:35:35] permission it's music and many don't
[2:35:38] understand the power of music what it
[2:35:40] actually can do so there's all kind of
[2:35:44] music today see I used to be a dis
[2:35:47] jockey I can tell you a lot about music
[2:35:49] the stuff that I come out of and I can
[2:35:51] show you the trends and the changes of
[2:35:54] music what done happen today uh how
[2:35:58] music done evolved that you go and do
[2:36:01] your study on it in the Bible times when
[2:36:05] the the music was considered also
[2:36:08] Psalms they called it
[2:36:11] Psalms but then uh the according to
[2:36:14] history when the children children of
[2:36:16] Israel when they came out of Babylon
[2:36:18] they were strict they didn't want
[2:36:20] nothing but Psalms PSAL in the synagogue
[2:36:22] Psalms Psalms Psalms but then as a
[2:36:26] progress begin to go into the
[2:36:27] reformation and then it start turning to
[2:36:31] hymns they start calling it gospel
[2:36:35] hymns and then you got many they would
[2:36:37] just stay with hymns but then that's
[2:36:40] things start progressing up to the 70s
[2:36:42] that's when the word gospel music was
[2:36:46] starting to be add to music and they
[2:36:49] said that's where the problem came when
[2:36:52] they called it gospel music cuz now you
[2:36:56] can put any beat to it but label it
[2:37:02] gospel so then you get the R&B gospel
[2:37:07] you get the rock and roll gospel you get
[2:37:09] the Hip Hop gospel now heavy metal
[2:37:14] gospel and the of the devil is it's
[2:37:18] gospel listen to the
[2:37:20] words what the message is bringing forth
[2:37:23] I said
[2:37:24] no it's a whole deal I don't listen to
[2:37:27] none of it because I know the spirit
[2:37:29] that's behind it we're in the age of
[2:37:32] all kinds of
[2:37:35] music and it's a power to it young
[2:37:38] people if you've been doing things in
[2:37:39] your life you know that it's wrong but
[2:37:42] then whenever you God touch your heart
[2:37:44] and you want to start serving
[2:37:46] and then when everything get start going
[2:37:48] wrong for you that's a sign God is
[2:37:52] actually dealing with you but the devil
[2:37:55] want to shake you off the path you have
[2:37:57] to keep pressing on cuz Satan looking at
[2:38:00] I'm losing one I'm losing one I got to
[2:38:02] do this I got to keep pressure I'm
[2:38:03] losing one that's how the enemy works
[2:38:07] whenever you want to start serving the
[2:38:09] lord some of the things that you used to
[2:38:12] try to achieve that's wrong and you
[2:38:14] couldn't achieve it but when you start
[2:38:16] wanting to serve the Lord them
[2:38:18] achievement come back and then seem like
[2:38:19] you can have it now that's the devil
[2:38:22] trying to trap you are you with me I'll
[2:38:26] tell young girls whenever you you feel
[2:38:29] lonely not nobody want you or whatever
[2:38:32] but then all of a sudden you say God you
[2:38:33] want me I want to serve you and when you
[2:38:35] make that
[2:38:37] confession that I want to serve you Lord
[2:38:39] then here come Mr Prince pop up in your
[2:38:42] life what you think that is the devil
[2:38:46] son to distract you same thing with a
[2:38:49] boy girl you might like she never paid
[2:38:52] you no attention now you want to sell
[2:38:53] out to the Lord now she shows interest
[2:38:55] in you that's not
[2:38:57] God that is Satan realizing I got to do
[2:39:01] something to keep
[2:39:03] them are y'all with
[2:39:05] me I had a young boy I'm getting I'm
[2:39:08] finishing I had a young boy come to me
[2:39:10] in my own
[2:39:11] church bragging Pride brother bur I
[2:39:15] pastor test I said I'm happy for you
[2:39:18] what was the test he said this girl came
[2:39:21] to talk to me he said I told her I'm not
[2:39:24] interested I told her I'm young and I'm
[2:39:26] not interested he I noticed the language
[2:39:29] was
[2:39:30] Pride I asked him a question I said this
[2:39:34] girl that come to you was she attracted
[2:39:36] to
[2:39:37] you he said no I said that wasn't a
[2:39:43] test I said but if she would have been
[2:39:46] one that you drool over like you got to
[2:39:49] have her then you would have told her no
[2:39:51] you passed the
[2:39:53] test are you with me let me tell you
[2:39:56] something young people God wants you to
[2:39:59] have a healthy marriage healthy
[2:40:01] relationship but it starts with him
[2:40:04] first he can make those things work
[2:40:07] exactly right are you with me look you
[2:40:11] might get mad you might get offended at
[2:40:13] me that's fine but all texting that
[2:40:16] young people do amongst each other boys
[2:40:19] and girls and stuff I don't agree with
[2:40:20] none of that
[2:40:21] stuff because what it does is create Rel
[2:40:25] relationship through text there's no boy
[2:40:28] sitting in here has a right to
[2:40:30] communicate with a girl without consent
[2:40:33] of the
[2:40:34] parents Paul said let everything be done
[2:40:37] decently and in
[2:40:39] order if a boy can bypass your father
[2:40:43] and you marry somebody like that let you
[2:40:45] going to have problems in that marriage
[2:40:47] cuz that's a sign of
[2:40:49] disrespect a young man got to respect
[2:40:51] the father if he interested in that
[2:40:53] man's daughter he got to respect that
[2:40:55] man oh yes if the man ain't got a
[2:40:57] husband if I mean she ain't got a father
[2:41:00] he got to respect the mother and the
[2:41:01] mother by the grace of God I hope she
[2:41:03] would talk to the
[2:41:05] pastor cuz sometimes when it's just a
[2:41:07] mother and her daughter a boy take
[2:41:09] advantage of that cuz a man is not there
[2:41:11] to challenge
[2:41:12] [Music]
[2:41:14] him I through incidents like that I saw
[2:41:17] a young boy talking to a mama and her
[2:41:20] daughter just pretty bold just talking
[2:41:22] to cuz her daddy was dead I got him to
[2:41:25] myself I said let me tell you something
[2:41:26] fella I noticed how you talk to this
[2:41:28] girl and her mom I said that's not right
[2:41:31] he oh we just joke like that I said no
[2:41:32] sir I said the reason why you talking to
[2:41:34] them like that there's not a man there
[2:41:37] to challenge you I said but I'm the man
[2:41:39] I'm going to challenge you you don't
[2:41:40] talk to that lady like
[2:41:42] that you got to do things in order and
[2:41:47] that's just the way it supposed to
[2:41:49] be that's why young girl if a boy
[2:41:52] interested in you tell him talk to your
[2:41:55] father but if you're not interested in
[2:41:58] him tell him straight to his face I'm
[2:42:00] not interested don't play games say nope
[2:42:04] not interested if you keep coming say
[2:42:07] brother if you keep trying to talk to me
[2:42:09] I'mma tell Daddy on
[2:42:10] [Music]
[2:42:12] you because some boy will keep pressing
[2:42:15] a girl
[2:42:16] pressing with words words and you keep
[2:42:19] listening sister you'll break in break
[2:42:22] down for the
[2:42:25] words oh you can sit here and say I'm
[2:42:28] I'm too high level for that say that all
[2:42:31] you want to but the one that you think
[2:42:33] is so cute start talking to you huh them
[2:42:36] little ARS get
[2:42:39] big they get big I like what he saying I
[2:42:42] like uh no no no stay with the gospel
[2:42:46] stay with order stay with the word are
[2:42:48] you with me I had a niece take her
[2:42:52] life playing with a Ouija board them
[2:42:55] things are not
[2:42:57] fake they're Real playing with a Ouija
[2:43:01] board and I don't know about you but uh
[2:43:03] what it call a sounding board where they
[2:43:05] got these little jars
[2:43:07] and anybody know I'm talking about it's
[2:43:10] a called a sounding board you hit it and
[2:43:13] it makes a Melody that is demonic
[2:43:17] inspired my nie got caught up into all
[2:43:19] of that stuff and it cost her her life I
[2:43:24] speak things because of incidents and
[2:43:26] things I've been through and experiences
[2:43:28] stay away from certain things things
[2:43:30] music and all this kind of stuff look
[2:43:33] gospel music worship music what does it
[2:43:36] do to
[2:43:37] you if you want to judge yourself about
[2:43:39] music when you listen to it what does it
[2:43:42] minister to your soul or your flesh
[2:43:47] yeah it's going to minister one or the
[2:43:49] other if it pulling you to the Lord fine
[2:43:52] but if it getting into your flesh and
[2:43:53] make you really want to get down you
[2:43:56] better leave it
[2:43:57] alone how many y'all ever heard of a man
[2:43:59] called Kurt
[2:44:01] Franklin that man got the biggest
[2:44:03] Antichrist Spirit on him in any musician
[2:44:05] that I know
[2:44:07] of he does and he's the one that made
[2:44:11] that Twist of Music R&B and gospel all
[2:44:15] come together and yet sing some of his
[2:44:18] songs now the question come up you know
[2:44:21] all these singers and some of the songs
[2:44:23] that they sing then should we not sing
[2:44:25] them that's a good question but here's
[2:44:28] the thing you have to understand even
[2:44:30] though they are worldly people that gift
[2:44:32] they have in them is of God to write
[2:44:36] music but you have to be able to take
[2:44:39] them words but not their tune not their
[2:44:41] beat if the words line up with scripture
[2:44:44] but not get get into their Rhythm that's
[2:44:46] what'll mess you
[2:44:48] up I'm just trying to balance it out
[2:44:50] because you know cuz you can't you can't
[2:44:52] be uh deny the
[2:44:54] gifts but these things carry
[2:44:58] Spirits I'm telling you this from the
[2:45:00] depths of my heart I don't lost loved
[2:45:02] one because of music and things like
[2:45:05] that and there was nothing that I could
[2:45:07] do so be careful young people be careful
[2:45:10] of your friends be careful of the ones
[2:45:12] you hang around even in church just be
[2:45:14] careful
[2:45:15] if somebody you hanging around cannot
[2:45:17] talk about the
[2:45:19] word talk about the goodness of God how
[2:45:21] they want to grow and be more closer to
[2:45:23] Jesus and they can talk about every
[2:45:25] sport and every little thing everything
[2:45:27] a celebrity is doing that's really not a
[2:45:29] good person to be around cuz when they
[2:45:31] talk to you about them things it'll
[2:45:33] build an
[2:45:34] appetite in you to make you want to go
[2:45:39] Adventure I'm just being I'm just
[2:45:41] pouring my heart out to you stay in
[2:45:43] these tapes stay in this
[2:45:46] message let let more than your body be
[2:45:49] in church let your spirit be in church
[2:45:51] too listen to the move of God when God
[2:45:54] is doing thing take heed to those things
[2:45:57] that's my heart I'm just pouring it out
[2:45:59] to you can we give the Lord a
[2:46:08] hand
