[36:40] we're not going to be long tonight i've
[36:42] just got a small thought here but you
[36:44] see i've always read that scripture
[36:46] there and i've gone
[36:48] i don't quite understand it because you
[36:50] know we talk about we hear
[36:52] strongly don't desire spiritual gifts
[36:56] don't desire a ministry don't desire to
[36:59] have have gifts operating in your life
[37:01] just let god do what he wants to do
[37:03] right do we hear do we agree that god
[37:06] will put in the body that god will use
[37:08] you how he wants not how we would
[37:10] perceive ourself but you see i've read
[37:13] the scripture here and actually that
[37:15] word gifts so it says follow after
[37:17] charity and desire spiritual gifts but
[37:19] that where gifts was added it's not
[37:21] actually in the scripture it was added
[37:22] by the translator and so it's actually
[37:25] saying that you should desire and you
[37:27] should pursue divine love
[37:29] and follow after the supernatural
[37:32] amen not to follow gifts or to desire
[37:35] gifts it says desire be zealous for the
[37:38] supernatural do we have a people here
[37:40] tonight that is zealous for the
[37:42] supernatural who want supernatural
[37:45] things to happen in their lives to
[37:46] happen in their family because you see
[37:48] without it there we can't go any further
[37:51] so the to get any further would there
[37:54] must be supernatural hallelujah where
[37:56] you're at right now you ain't going
[37:57] nowhere without a supernatural event to
[38:00] take you further
[38:02] because the devil devil's not going to
[38:03] let you just walk into your victory oh
[38:05] my you've got to fight into your victory
[38:07] and it's god's power behind you it's
[38:10] like a river to break forth all the
[38:12] walls amen it wasn't israel that broke
[38:15] the walls of the freed rahab was it amen
[38:18] they just followed the word of god they
[38:21] followed the instruction of the captain
[38:23] and the captain gave them the the very
[38:26] thing that they would never
[38:28] who
[38:28] could you do you think israel would have
[38:31] come up with that idea
[38:33] no way
[38:35] and the victory
[38:37] tonight that we're going to win in
[38:38] prayer
[38:40] for whatever the needs are it says let
[38:41] your request be made known to the lord
[38:43] the victory
[38:45] tonight the lord will reveal that
[38:48] how to pray
[38:49] amen
[38:50] he'll reveal what to pray and i just
[38:53] encourage you tonight
[38:54] avail yourself
[38:56] to the leadership of the holy spirit
[38:59] so that he can pray according to his
[39:02] will
[39:03] and pray through you
[39:05] not because you're worthy or you've done
[39:06] anything to to to earn it it was because
[39:10] he's worthy it's because he is worthy
[39:12] that we can pray and he can use us to
[39:15] deliver to change
[39:18] for you
[39:19] all of you from the youngest to the
[39:21] oldest
[39:22] are life-changing
[39:23] amen so gifts
[39:25] you know this that to see that that was
[39:27] added it just
[39:28] opened it to me
[39:30] and actually i went into the original uh
[39:33] emphatic diagram that we that brother
[39:36] branham used a lot to see the original
[39:38] and it says here
[39:40] it says pursue the love which is the
[39:43] agapo love
[39:45] and be zealous
[39:46] for the spiritual be zealous for the
[39:48] supernatural amen
[39:51] but more that you should prophesy
[39:54] amen hallelujah so there you have there
[39:59] is something that he's telling you here
[40:01] that you should
[40:02] pursue love
[40:04] the divine love of god goes first
[40:07] pursue love get god's love in your heart
[40:10] get god's love in your life till you're
[40:12] so saturated that all there is is love
[40:15] amen hallelujah i would rather have
[40:17] divine love than all of the supernatural
[40:19] gifts operating but when you do have
[40:21] divine love that is the key to the
[40:24] supernatural operating it is the key to
[40:27] holiness did you know that that living a
[40:30] holy life if you do it because you have
[40:32] to you've missed the mark but if you're
[40:34] living us a holy life because you're so
[40:37] full of his love that his commandments
[40:39] are not grievous
[40:40] oh the supernatural will flow through
[40:42] you he will manifest himself to you he
[40:45] promised to he said he that loveth me
[40:47] keepeth my commandments and i will
[40:49] manifest myself to him
[40:51] and her
[40:52] hallelujah but love comes first
[40:55] and so i asked you the question if
[40:57] you're living a holy life why are you
[40:59] living a holy life why are you doing it
[41:01] what is the objective what is the motive
[41:03] behind it hallelujah amen
[41:07] so it says here and i just want to
[41:09] reiterate this pursue divine love
[41:12] and be zealous for the supernatural
[41:15] amen but more that you would live
[41:18] love and speak by inspiration
[41:22] a divine influence
[41:24] see god wants to be a divine influence
[41:26] on your life and he wants to reflect it
[41:29] that's grace
[41:30] amen and when divine love is projected
[41:32] sovereign grace will take its place out
[41:35] of your belly shall flow rivers of
[41:37] living waters
[41:38] do you believe that
[41:40] amen
[41:41] it starts
[41:43] with humility humble yourself say lord
[41:46] here i am
[41:47] i'm not going to do these things i just
[41:49] lord lay my life at your feet i lay my
[41:51] life on your altar you made provision
[41:53] for me i'm i'm coming before your throne
[41:55] lord deliver me and whatever it is
[41:58] that's stemming the flow unblock it lord
[42:01] be specific
[42:03] because there's things in our life the
[42:05] devil does everything he can to stop
[42:07] this flow of the supernatural but
[42:10] the lord has made provision for that to
[42:12] flow
[42:13] to constantly flow so that you can be a
[42:16] tree planted by the rivers of living
[42:18] water amen no and every season fruitful
[42:22] an evergreen tree
[42:24] we don't need to be deciduous
[42:26] you know you look out there the trees
[42:27] and the branches and you can see trees
[42:30] in the winter they lose their leaves and
[42:32] they become deciduous but there is
[42:34] people
[42:35] on the earth there are trees on the
[42:37] earth that never lose their leaves amen
[42:40] and there is a people that are planted
[42:42] by the rivers of living water a man who
[42:45] believes that tonight that can stay
[42:47] fruitful that can stay green
[42:50] amen so that you can let the light of
[42:52] god shine on you and fruit will come and
[42:55] people will be changed because a
[42:57] fruitful tree that is green is a
[43:00] life-changing tree and you can be
[43:02] life-changing trees tonight and i'm
[43:04] encouraging you tonight
[43:05] be life-changing
[43:08] god wants to use you
[43:10] you may feel unworthy right now but it's
[43:12] not your worthiness that'll make you a
[43:14] life changer it's the grace of our god
[43:16] it is what he did on calvary he did that
[43:19] for a purpose so that he could use you
[43:21] and change people's lives
[43:24] oh my
[43:25] hallelujah i believe lives are going to
[43:27] be changed tonight
[43:28] i believe god's going to use us tonight
[43:31] to change people's lives
[43:33] to change situations
[43:35] hallelujah
[43:37] amen wow it's good to be here
[43:40] you know amen unwound from years of
[43:43] pressure
[43:44] hallelujah
[43:46] years of pressure
[43:48] marion's got a little taste
[43:50] amen
[43:51] hallelujah
[43:53] god bless marion
[43:56] hallelujah give him a handclap of praise
[44:01] he's doing a
[44:03] gallant deed
[44:05] by doing that job because lots of things
[44:07] are opening up for us as a church but
[44:09] it's also for businesses and for the
[44:11] movie to be made all those things it's
[44:13] all part of the plan and so
[44:15] it's not easy
[44:18] all of these things are not easy but
[44:20] they are part of god's plan and so when
[44:22] we find ourselves doing his will
[44:24] amen we find that the more that god
[44:27] places in the situation it enables us to
[44:30] go and do other things and develop so
[44:33] praise god
[44:34] amen hallelujah i just want to read from
[44:37] 1 corinthians 14 23 let's just build
[44:39] this out a little bit
[44:40] so it says here
[44:42] and we'll read down to verse 25 it says
[44:44] if therefore the whole church be come
[44:47] together into one place and all speak
[44:50] with tongues now it's a continuation
[44:52] from what we read earlier at the opening
[44:54] scripture
[44:55] um
[44:56] but i didn't want to read everything on
[44:57] that
[44:58] chapter there but you go back and read 1
[45:00] corinthians 12 all the way through to 14
[45:03] and you'll get a big picture of this
[45:06] narrative that we're dealing with
[45:08] tonight um and it says here if therefore
[45:10] the whole church become together into
[45:12] one place and all speak with tongues and
[45:14] and there coming those that are
[45:16] unlearned or unbelievers will they not
[45:18] think that you're mad
[45:20] right
[45:22] but if all prophesy
[45:24] and there coming one that believeth not
[45:26] or one unlearned
[45:28] he is convinced of all
[45:30] he is judged of all
[45:33] and thus are the secrets of his heart
[45:35] made manifest and so falling down on his
[45:38] face he will worship god and i'm so glad
[45:41] that see we have a a course here that is
[45:44] showing us and i looked at this and i
[45:47] thought does that mean we're all going
[45:48] to stand here and begin to just tell the
[45:50] the future but it's not meaning that
[45:52] what he's meaning by that you should
[45:54] prophesy and he's saying and he says it
[45:56] a few times in this 14 his desire that
[45:59] you may prophesy covet earnestly that
[46:02] you may prophesy what is he talking
[46:04] about he's meaning be inspired
[46:07] be inspiration in flesh
[46:10] let the spirit of god take you
[46:12] yield relax
[46:14] let the tension go down and crumble
[46:17] like rahab's past
[46:19] amen
[46:20] let it crumble because you don't have to
[46:22] hold it and it's those things when you
[46:24] try and make it happen you try to
[46:26] conceive god's plan for your life you
[46:28] try and you get tense and he can't use
[46:31] you you can't work even on a day-to-day
[46:34] basis
[46:36] when you get tense and when you get
[46:38] stressed and when you try so hard oh i
[46:41] just want the supernatural to happen and
[46:42] it says be zealous but part of that
[46:46] is relaxing
[46:47] part of that is letting go and letting
[46:50] god and just waiting i've got a quote
[46:53] later on
[46:54] and it talks about them in the upper
[46:56] room and for so long i've always thought
[46:58] they were crying and praying the whole
[47:00] time but he didn't say that he said
[47:02] terry
[47:04] wait
[47:05] wait
[47:06] there's a difference
[47:08] i thought my they did i thought for a
[47:11] long time thought they would pray for 10
[47:13] days or however long they were there
[47:14] just crying out to god but he didn't say
[47:17] you should pray all this whole time he
[47:18] just said terry in jerusalem
[47:20] terry and wait
[47:22] for the spirit of god the promise of the
[47:23] father to come and so there's a waiting
[47:26] on god there's a waiting and tonight
[47:28] while we're here while you're listening
[47:30] wait on god
[47:32] wait on the spirit
[47:33] wait on him he's going to say something
[47:35] to you he's going to speak to you who
[47:38] expects that tonight that god will speak
[47:40] to you amen he will he will do something
[47:43] for you
[47:44] hallelujah and he'll prepare you because
[47:46] you see the purpose of tonight is that
[47:48] we would pray
[47:49] amen the purpose of tonight is that that
[47:52] after we hear the word we will we will
[47:54] pray and lives will change situations
[47:57] will change healings will take place
[48:00] cancers will go
[48:01] lives will be changed people will give
[48:03] their hearts to the lord the holy ghost
[48:04] will be poured out revival will strike
[48:08] hallelujah
[48:09] he will turn deserts into blossoming
[48:11] roses wildernesses into edenic
[48:14] conditions amen in lives in situations
[48:18] in places where there's strongholds of
[48:20] witchcraft and strongholds of darkness
[48:22] he will change those things believe it
[48:25] hallelujah
[48:27] and he wants to use
[48:28] you
[48:30] he wants to use these girls
[48:32] he wants to use all these children
[48:34] avail yourself to him because you're not
[48:36] too young
[48:38] neither are we too old i saw something
[48:39] on my facebook feed of a 100 year old
[48:42] man getting baptized and i rejoiced i
[48:44] thought praise god you're not too old or
[48:46] too young amen if a hundred year old man
[48:49] can get baptized i thought that was just
[48:51] powerful
[48:52] amen
[48:53] hallelujah i was going to send it to my
[48:55] family
[48:56] i thought well i might get in trouble
[48:58] but oh well we'll just let it happen
[49:00] [Laughter]
[49:01] oh my
[49:02] you know the devil will say that people
[49:04] are too old and they just think it's
[49:06] just past it but they're not past it
[49:08] today is the day
[49:10] hallelujah
[49:12] oh glory
[49:14] and so i just want to show you here that
[49:16] there is a powerful
[49:18] message of what paul is saying here that
[49:22] that there's all these tongues and
[49:24] supernatural but it has to be done in
[49:26] order and there is something far more
[49:28] profitable than the gifts operating
[49:31] there is a prophecy to unfold for the
[49:34] people a prophecy of inspiration that
[49:37] your life it says here that they are
[49:39] judged of all these people that would
[49:41] come into this church they would come in
[49:43] those doors or come into your house or
[49:45] come into your workplace come into where
[49:48] you're sitting and all of a sudden the
[49:49] spirit of god comes down and he begins
[49:52] to say things through you that's just as
[49:54] natural as can be but you're speaking
[49:56] the very things of their heart
[49:58] discerning the thoughts and intents of
[50:00] the heart who believes that god can use
[50:03] them that way that god can use you and
[50:05] prophesy through you he can inspire you
[50:08] he can give you a word and sees and how
[50:11] sweet is it when an unbeliever and you
[50:13] begin to speak at everything they're
[50:15] thinking and what they've been talking
[50:17] about and what they've been wondering
[50:18] god answers that
[50:20] hallelujah
[50:22] hebrews 4 12 for the word of god is
[50:24] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[50:26] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[50:28] dividing a part of soul and spirit and
[50:31] as a discerner of the thoughts and
[50:33] intents of the heart and that word is
[50:36] here
[50:37] that word is in you that word is in me
[50:40] and it can discern it can change
[50:42] people's lives because what does it do
[50:45] it begins to get down into their life
[50:47] and it begins to divide and open up and
[50:50] reveal truth
[50:52] reveal who they are
[50:54] only the word can do it
[50:56] there is power and inspiration of god
[50:59] there is power in a prophetic utterance
[51:01] of god and when none of us are out of
[51:04] its reach
[51:05] i'll read it let me read
[51:10] one corinthians 14 39 i'll get to this
[51:13] wherefore brethren covet to prophesy and
[51:16] forbid not to speak with tongues let all
[51:18] things be done decently in an order who
[51:21] is eligible to speak under inspiration
[51:24] let me let me let me share this with you
[51:26] from questions and answers on the holy
[51:28] ghost says but how do you get into it
[51:31] them gifts are in the body
[51:34] how do you get in the body not by
[51:36] speaking your way in
[51:38] but by being baptized into one body
[51:41] not
[51:42] one by one spirit we're all baptized
[51:44] into that body
[51:46] one corinthians 12
[51:48] 13
[51:49] and and it says here one spirit we're
[51:51] all baptized into that body and subject
[51:54] to all the gifts
[51:57] the lord bless you it says
[52:00] so you see
[52:01] there's not one person in this room
[52:04] with the baptism of the holy ghost and
[52:06] even i mean you could even venture to
[52:08] say that even without the baptism of the
[52:10] holy ghost the spirit of god can still
[52:12] get upon people it can get into their
[52:14] spirit realm and and begin to do
[52:16] supernatural things how much more a
[52:18] spirit-filled believer who's sitting
[52:20] there is resting as worshiping and is
[52:22] entering into a place with him where he
[52:24] can use you hallelujah maybe something's
[52:26] blocking in your life right now in the
[52:29] next five seconds you can it can be
[52:31] dealt with because the blood is enough
[52:34] the blood is still there the blood's
[52:36] still speaking so if there's anything in
[52:38] your life maybe you came in that door
[52:40] with something hanging on you it doesn't
[52:42] have to remain on you because we're
[52:43] going to pray why pray with something
[52:45] hanging on you why pray with an
[52:47] unforgiveness or a scornfulness or a
[52:49] discontentment or or any jealousy or any
[52:52] fear
[52:54] or any lust or anything
[52:56] why
[52:58] we may have walked in that way but we
[52:59] don't have to remain that way and so
[53:01] here is your opportunity just say lord
[53:03] let it be gone
[53:04] oh forgive me father take it away from
[53:07] me cleanse me and let me be a river
[53:10] oh my let me prophesy i could desire
[53:13] earnestly that you would inspire me
[53:15] tonight i want to pray for something and
[53:17] let it be changed let lives be changed
[53:19] and let it change
[53:21] the course of history
[53:24] amen you know that you can change the
[53:25] course of history amen hallelujah you
[53:27] know that you're a very powerful people
[53:29] tonight a very powerful people not by
[53:32] your own intellectual your own might or
[53:34] you not by might nor by power but by my
[53:36] spirit saith the lord that power that
[53:39] dunamis a dynamite is where dynamite
[53:42] comes from the word dunamis power
[53:44] god has got dynamite in you and in the
[53:47] power of your tongue he can release the
[53:49] dynamite and that dynamite will break
[53:52] any wall it will divide any small you
[53:54] know this
[53:56] no matter how thin the slices there's
[53:58] always two sides but the word of god can
[54:00] discern between
[54:02] the word of god can take all matters and
[54:04] make clear and bring balance
[54:07] hallelujah
[54:08] so maybe there's someone that of your
[54:10] loved ones that may be in something
[54:12] wrong or going down the wrong way sin
[54:14] the word
[54:15] amen said god speak through me
[54:18] hallelujah
[54:19] of all the testimonies we've heard of
[54:22] how people have come up to prayer life
[54:23] and and and ask for their loved ones and
[54:26] then hours later they've come running
[54:28] through the altar from their houses and
[54:30] their lives have been changed because
[54:32] the spirit of god goes out and finds
[54:34] them because they spoke the word
[54:36] can god use you
[54:38] are you anything different than them
[54:41] no
[54:42] as we just read here
[54:45] one spirit we're all baptized into that
[54:46] body and subject to all the gifts
[54:49] subject to god using you
[54:51] can god use you
[54:53] yes he can
[54:54] god can use you mightily
[54:56] hallelujah just remain humble
[54:59] just humble yourself
[55:01] under the mighty hand of god and he will
[55:03] use you humble yourself the way up is
[55:06] down
[55:11] one corinthians
[55:13] 12 7 it says but the manifestation of
[55:15] the spirit is given to
[55:18] some men
[55:19] does it say that
[55:23] hallelujah that word manifestation is
[55:25] the supernatural operation of god
[55:28] so the supernatural operation of the
[55:30] spirit is given to every man
[55:33] to profit
[55:34] with all
[55:36] for to one is given by the spirit the
[55:38] word of wisdom to another the word of
[55:40] knowledge by the same spirit to another
[55:43] faith by the same spirit to another the
[55:45] gifts of healing by the same spirit to
[55:47] another the working of miracles to
[55:49] another prophecy
[55:52] now in this case it's prophecy as in a
[55:54] prophecy to where god would speak lip to
[55:57] air or begin to speak through a person
[55:59] to tell a future thing that's about to
[56:01] happen or
[56:04] to another discerning of spirits to
[56:06] another diverse kinds of tongues to
[56:08] another the interpretation of tongues
[56:11] but all these worketh that one and
[56:14] selfsame spirit dividing to
[56:17] every man
[56:18] severally as he will
[56:20] never rule yourself out of being used of
[56:23] god in a supernatural way
[56:26] and i believe tonight god is going to
[56:28] use you in a supernatural way and i just
[56:30] want you to own that for yourself i want
[56:33] you to say no matter what i feel about
[56:35] myself no matter how i've performed
[56:36] today i've been maybe been a failure all
[56:39] day i maybe doubted things but i'm
[56:41] asking for forgiveness and lord tonight
[56:44] i'm going to stand and you're going to
[56:45] use me you're going to speak to him i'm
[56:47] going to pray and something's going to
[56:48] happen
[56:49] amen hallelujah
[56:51] hallelujah
[56:52] oh my babies can be healed old people
[56:55] can be healed lives can be changed
[56:57] tonight
[56:58] who believes that who wants to walk in
[57:00] that reality because this is our reality
[57:04] what you see is not complete reality
[57:07] it's just physical it's just a physical
[57:09] thing but there is a greater reality
[57:11] there is a greater power there is a
[57:13] greater sense that is the sixth sense
[57:16] that is the sense of your faith let that
[57:18] faith put all those other senses subject
[57:21] amen what you see what you hear what you
[57:23] feel what you taste and what whatever
[57:26] else there is
[57:28] let them be subject
[57:30] amen to the sick sense of faith
[57:33] hallelujah
[57:36] it's just a gift that you just humble
[57:38] yourself or relax before god and he uses
[57:42] your speech
[57:43] god has no voice but yours and mine he
[57:47] our hands are his hands
[57:49] if we can just be so submitted to the
[57:51] spirit
[57:52] that it can use our voice and use our
[57:55] hands and use our eyes
[57:58] oh lord help me
[57:59] now if you don't have to you don't have
[58:02] to do these things but god just sets
[58:04] those in his church whoever it's signs
[58:06] that the people might know that god
[58:08] still lives it's jesus the son of god
[58:11] working through his body that he has
[58:13] redeemed
[58:15] we're not worthy certainly not but he's
[58:18] worthy
[58:19] can everyone just say he's worthy
[58:22] he is worthy
[58:24] amen
[58:25] hallelujah
[58:28] oh my
[58:31] prophet says this
[58:33] i just want us to this is like a checkup
[58:35] for us
[58:36] because and and if anything you know
[58:38] because you see with the grace of god
[58:41] see there's grace for us to be changed
[58:43] there's grace for us to remain evergreen
[58:46] there's grace for us to stay fruitful
[58:49] there's no excuse for us to be stagnant
[58:52] there's no excuse for us to have
[58:54] festering wounds
[58:56] or festering troubles or something that
[58:59] just keeps haunting and haunting there's
[59:01] no reason to remain that way
[59:03] no reason
[59:04] the moment you you'd reject that
[59:07] it's a lie
[59:09] and and really reach out to god and
[59:11] believe and you receive your healing
[59:14] or you receive deliverance or closure or
[59:17] whatever it may be that the blood can
[59:19] speak over your life
[59:21] amen
[59:22] you can be free
[59:24] that's what grace is for
[59:26] amen
[59:28] but
[59:29] sometimes we let these things pay
[59:31] tribute
[59:32] like the children of israel they got the
[59:34] promised land they were given it all god
[59:36] gave them the power he said little by
[59:38] little i'll give it to you but just keep
[59:39] getting it but there was many times and
[59:41] he said don't don't don't just save
[59:44] nothing get rid of everything and just
[59:46] take the land don't take prisoners
[59:49] take no prisoners
[59:51] but what did israel do many times you
[59:53] read later on there's all these hittites
[59:55] and high bites and whatever and they're
[59:57] part of the economy they're paying their
[59:58] taxes and they become comfortable and
[1:00:01] it's the same thing in our life
[1:00:03] sometimes we let tributaries start to
[1:00:05] work in our life and we just get
[1:00:07] comfortable with these things but
[1:00:08] tonight you don't have to stay
[1:00:10] comfortable with those tributaries
[1:00:11] because those tributaries are not part
[1:00:13] of your body change those tributaries
[1:00:16] are not in your heavenly body so why
[1:00:18] leave them in your earthly amen because
[1:00:20] there is grace tonight for those things
[1:00:23] to be done
[1:00:24] hallelujah
[1:00:26] hallelujah and if any of those things
[1:00:28] are affecting your influence
[1:00:30] with god
[1:00:31] because that's what they do
[1:00:33] they affect your influence
[1:00:35] they affect your standing in faith
[1:00:38] because they they twist your perception
[1:00:40] of things and then god can't trust your
[1:00:42] discernment because there's something in
[1:00:44] there that's
[1:00:46] taunting you or causing a twist of your
[1:00:48] perception of what's happening it clouds
[1:00:51] judgment
[1:00:52] by having these little tributaries and
[1:00:54] so tonight
[1:00:56] let god's grace
[1:00:58] just say you know you just make yourself
[1:01:00] to the lord and say lord i'm going to
[1:01:02] pray tonight without anything in my life
[1:01:04] that's going to hinder my judgment oh
[1:01:06] take it all out all of it
[1:01:08] amen and now i read this
[1:01:11] amen
[1:01:12] then we just take the name of god and
[1:01:15] use it anyway prophesy it
[1:01:17] when means nothing but some kind of
[1:01:19] carnal influence and so forth and say
[1:01:21] things that never happen and act like it
[1:01:24] never pay any attention or if you say
[1:01:26] something and honestly it didn't happen
[1:01:28] and repent and tell it
[1:01:30] that you were wrong then your influence
[1:01:32] will come back
[1:01:33] the man is honest so he's a hypothetical
[1:01:35] situation says these angels he's talking
[1:01:38] about influence and and and isaiah as he
[1:01:41] saw the lord high lift it up and he saw
[1:01:42] those seraphims and how their wings and
[1:01:45] everything was covering there was a
[1:01:46] reverence and a humility and yet they
[1:01:49] were perfect hallelujah but they were
[1:01:52] reverent humble and an action he says
[1:01:55] and so he's talking about them here he
[1:01:57] says these angels seraphims never know
[1:01:59] sin or nothing about sin they just
[1:02:01] burned the sacrifice and to make a way
[1:02:04] for the worshipper the saints and they
[1:02:07] have to have their faces covered
[1:02:09] what would that be up the side of uzziah
[1:02:11] the one that went and burned incense out
[1:02:13] of his position
[1:02:15] cover their holy faces in the presence
[1:02:17] of god with reverence
[1:02:20] god help us with our reverence
[1:02:23] he says the prophet says here
[1:02:25] now i'm not that this here if if if this
[1:02:28] hits your home then just repent if it
[1:02:31] doesn't then i'm not saying it's hitting
[1:02:32] people's homes but it's going to go over
[1:02:34] the church right now and if it hits you
[1:02:36] and you're honest with yourself just
[1:02:37] make it right now there's no reverence
[1:02:40] there seems to be that we can just do
[1:02:43] anything in the name of the lord oh my
[1:02:46] lord help us and get by with it
[1:02:48] just as long as we belong to some
[1:02:50] certain message church or that's got a
[1:02:53] good social standing and they don't take
[1:02:55] our papers away from us the presbyters
[1:02:58] and the bishops and so forth don't call
[1:03:00] our papers and we still have a good
[1:03:02] influence amongst the people but
[1:03:05] and this is the but that really struck
[1:03:07] me
[1:03:08] what kind of an influence do we have in
[1:03:10] the presence of god
[1:03:12] because you can have a great influence
[1:03:13] in the presence of the people
[1:03:15] but what about when you go before god
[1:03:18] does he appear
[1:03:19] to you
[1:03:21] does he come down into your prayer
[1:03:22] meetings
[1:03:23] when you're at home does god come
[1:03:26] if he doesn't why not
[1:03:29] be honest
[1:03:30] because there's grace here to let any
[1:03:33] festering issues
[1:03:34] not remain there anything it's all to be
[1:03:38] changed it's all to be made right and
[1:03:40] it's destined and it's planned for you
[1:03:43] to be freed from anything that would
[1:03:45] block the river from flowing
[1:03:47] because there is a river that flows from
[1:03:49] god above that's filled with his love
[1:03:51] that can change people's lives and
[1:03:53] tonight if there's anything that has
[1:03:56] struck your home or anything that has
[1:03:58] hit you and you've gone that's me then
[1:04:00] you've made it right i believe by faith
[1:04:02] you've made it right right now whatever
[1:04:05] it may be so that we can pray without
[1:04:07] hindrance so that all of these
[1:04:08] tributaries will come into a river and
[1:04:11] flow and reach heaven so that god can
[1:04:14] answer with fire and with change and
[1:04:17] with prophecy
[1:04:18] hallelujah
[1:04:20] i like that but
[1:04:22] what kind of an influence do we have in
[1:04:24] the presence of god the prophet says
[1:04:26] this does our rep prayers return void
[1:04:30] or are they answered
[1:04:32] and that's a personal question for all
[1:04:34] of us
[1:04:36] if you have embarrassed the balance and
[1:04:38] the answer if you abide in me
[1:04:41] and my word abide in you
[1:04:44] ask what you will and it shall be done
[1:04:48] so if you abide in me and my word abide
[1:04:50] in you you've got the mind of christ he
[1:04:53] can you your discernment is right
[1:04:55] there's something taking place where
[1:04:58] your prayers is exactly what he wants
[1:05:00] you to pray
[1:05:01] there's no other hindering spirit or
[1:05:04] some tributary or some sickness in your
[1:05:06] mind or some hurt from your childhood or
[1:05:09] some past thing that is blocking and
[1:05:11] tilting your perception
[1:05:13] tilting your judgment he's got but when
[1:05:16] there's a word you abide in him and his
[1:05:17] word abides in you he corrects you and
[1:05:20] you stand in the stature of the perfect
[1:05:22] man you stand in a way with clear
[1:05:24] discernment clear judgment the mind of
[1:05:26] christ operating in you so that when you
[1:05:29] pray you're praying according to his
[1:05:31] will
[1:05:32] and then he answers then he begins to
[1:05:34] appear in your life now remember this is
[1:05:37] not based on performance now hallelujah
[1:05:39] there's a there's a motive behind this
[1:05:41] and we'll get there in a second
[1:05:43] if you abide in me and my word in you
[1:05:45] and ask what you will and it shall be
[1:05:47] done he that believeth in me the works
[1:05:49] that i do shall he do also amen who
[1:05:53] believes that tonight
[1:05:54] even more than this shall he do for i go
[1:05:57] to the father
[1:05:59] amen
[1:06:00] hallelujah i believe that we're in the
[1:06:02] age where that is being completely
[1:06:04] fulfilled that christ is appearing
[1:06:06] amongst his people christ is appearing
[1:06:08] in the mama the data christ is appearing
[1:06:11] in the pastor christ is appearing in the
[1:06:13] minister christ is appearing in the
[1:06:15] brother the sister the the children he's
[1:06:17] appearing in the people
[1:06:20] hallelujah and he's doing the changing
[1:06:23] in the people amen
[1:06:25] that's his love
[1:06:27] so why would you live a life that he
[1:06:29] would want to do this
[1:06:32] love
[1:06:34] and that is the real
[1:06:35] essence
[1:06:37] that connects us to that walk
[1:06:40] so i encourage you
[1:06:42] don't go and beat yourself up right now
[1:06:44] oh i fail and oh i'm so wrong
[1:06:47] just fall in love
[1:06:49] fall in love with jesus and if you know
[1:06:51] you can say oh i want to fall in love
[1:06:54] you just get down and say lord oh i just
[1:06:56] want to fall in love with you jesus
[1:06:58] really cry out the fervent and effectual
[1:07:01] prayer of a righteous man avail of much
[1:07:03] touch heaven you know these people that
[1:07:06] approached jesus when he walked they
[1:07:07] didn't approach him haphazardly they
[1:07:10] really meant it they were sincere she
[1:07:12] said bartimaeus
[1:07:13] was sincere
[1:07:14] you think he cried out he cried out and
[1:07:17] even though jesus couldn't hear him he
[1:07:18] heard the cry
[1:07:19] hallelujah
[1:07:22] amen
[1:07:23] hallelujah
[1:07:25] he was walking and he stood
[1:07:27] and i believe that you can cry out
[1:07:29] tonight
[1:07:30] to let god unblock the channel that love
[1:07:33] can flow that that motive behind your
[1:07:36] life to live for him
[1:07:37] would be cleaned out
[1:07:39] would be clarified would be calibrated
[1:07:42] would be in line
[1:07:43] not by your works not by your own merit
[1:07:45] nothing to do with it not by might not
[1:07:47] by power but by my spirit
[1:07:49] saith the lord to bring you into
[1:07:52] alignment just by humbling yourself and
[1:07:54] praying and letting god do the work
[1:07:58] that he has already provided
[1:08:00] says here what kind of an influence
[1:08:04] even more than this shall i do for i go
[1:08:06] to the father
[1:08:07] where are we pentecostal people
[1:08:10] find ourselves on the road map this
[1:08:12] morning this evening let's not be
[1:08:14] bypassed
[1:08:16] let's not get bypassed no sir there's
[1:08:18] one road to heaven and that's the road
[1:08:20] of holiness
[1:08:22] the righteous
[1:08:26] the righteous walk in that road of
[1:08:28] holiness
[1:08:29] and when they fall they get back on the
[1:08:30] road and then they make a mistake they
[1:08:32] get back on the road and then they do
[1:08:34] this and they get back on the road
[1:08:36] because there's grace for it but what
[1:08:38] i'm speaking of is a festering issue
[1:08:41] that doesn't need to fester that doesn't
[1:08:43] need to block your prayer life that
[1:08:45] doesn't need to block your influence in
[1:08:47] the presence of god you can't you can
[1:08:50] fool people you can have the greatest
[1:08:52] prayer life in front of everyone and
[1:08:53] they think you've got the greatest
[1:08:54] prayers and you just break through to
[1:08:56] heaven but what does god think
[1:08:58] what's going on in heaven
[1:09:00] oh my
[1:09:01] hallelujah
[1:09:03] and so we need to be honest with
[1:09:04] ourselves we're in the last days saints
[1:09:06] we're right at the end it's no time to
[1:09:08] play church anymore there's no time to
[1:09:10] try and put on something in front of
[1:09:11] people but then yet you're rotten behind
[1:09:14] in front of god
[1:09:16] because you're not accepting the grace
[1:09:19] that is available to change you just
[1:09:22] because of something that's blocking and
[1:09:24] all you need to do is say lord
[1:09:26] i lay that at your feet
[1:09:28] oh here i am jesus
[1:09:30] all your grace is hear your blood
[1:09:32] speaking hallelujah
[1:09:34] this brings us now to the importance of
[1:09:37] prophecy
[1:09:39] when your life is inspired or a little a
[1:09:41] young girl gets up and sings a song and
[1:09:43] sees it god let them and then that song
[1:09:46] begins to deliver people and that thing
[1:09:48] that was festering gets delivered
[1:09:51] how important was that prophecy
[1:09:53] how important was it that that prophecy
[1:09:55] happened that someone was inspired by
[1:09:58] god and then someone gets up and they go
[1:10:00] and say something after the church
[1:10:02] service to or
[1:10:03] to somebody because it was on their
[1:10:05] heart to say and it was exactly what
[1:10:06] that person needed and they were
[1:10:08] inspired
[1:10:09] desire that you may prophesy you are a
[1:10:12] life changer and god has got a body hair
[1:10:16] that is functioning that is eligible for
[1:10:18] the supernatural so that the
[1:10:20] supernatural can flow in your life so
[1:10:22] that he can appear before you so that
[1:10:24] when you pray hallelujah there is an
[1:10:27] influence in the heavenly realm that
[1:10:29] begins to come down and begins to settle
[1:10:32] in your room and you god begins to speak
[1:10:35] and lives begin to change and walls
[1:10:37] begin to crumble and healings begin to
[1:10:39] take place and the dead are raised and
[1:10:41] the lepers are cleaned amen
[1:10:46] my
[1:10:47] hallelujah
[1:10:50] amen
[1:10:54] the righteous walk in it the unbeliever
[1:10:57] laughs at it
[1:10:58] depends on what yeah
[1:11:03] john says here john 14 21
[1:11:06] and we're just bringing this out now to
[1:11:08] a close
[1:11:10] almost he says this
[1:11:14] he that hath my commandments and keepeth
[1:11:17] them haters that loveth me
[1:11:19] and he that loveth me shall be loved of
[1:11:21] my father and i will love him
[1:11:24] and will manifest myself
[1:11:27] to him
[1:11:28] amen there you have
[1:11:31] a love connection
[1:11:33] to your
[1:11:35] your behavior to your life
[1:11:37] there is a question is your life worthy
[1:11:39] of the gospel
[1:11:40] because the gospel is the power to
[1:11:42] transform your life it is a supernatural
[1:11:45] manifestation that is available to the
[1:11:47] children of god to change you to equip
[1:11:50] you to empower you to deliver you to
[1:11:53] heal you so that you can function in
[1:11:56] full function and power
[1:11:58] so that you can be the fulfillment of
[1:12:01] she or he that believeth on me the works
[1:12:03] that i do shall she or he do also
[1:12:08] the provision is so available it is so
[1:12:12] here
[1:12:13] right now
[1:12:14] whatever you're going through whatever
[1:12:16] there's troubling you whatever tributary
[1:12:18] that's been in your life that's been
[1:12:20] easier you can live with it but you know
[1:12:22] it's hindering
[1:12:24] just lay it at the foot of the calvary
[1:12:25] now
[1:12:26] lay it there now
[1:12:28] and see god move in your life
[1:12:31] so that those commandments become easy
[1:12:33] become non-grievous the bible says
[1:12:35] because it's like that he that loveth me
[1:12:38] the commandments of god are not grievous
[1:12:40] to those
[1:12:41] i think it's in 1 john 5.
[1:12:43] amen
[1:12:45] hallelujah
[1:12:48] says here and these are this is just my
[1:12:50] questions i just want to ask these
[1:12:52] things
[1:12:53] one wonder why the supernatural does not
[1:12:55] manifest
[1:12:57] check up your motive and your objective
[1:12:59] are you living right yes okay
[1:13:02] more importantly check up your motive
[1:13:04] for your holiness because this is the
[1:13:06] keys here
[1:13:08] 1 john 2 15 it says love not the world
[1:13:11] neither the things that are in the world
[1:13:13] if any man love the world the love of
[1:13:15] the father is not in him
[1:13:17] so if the love of the father is in you
[1:13:20] there's no way you can love the things
[1:13:22] of the world because it's full of god's
[1:13:24] love there's no other room for love or
[1:13:26] affection because you see god's love
[1:13:29] trumps
[1:13:30] your
[1:13:30] affections trumps everything when you're
[1:13:33] in his presence no lie
[1:13:35] no veneer no scheme of darkness is
[1:13:38] plausible this complete and full
[1:13:41] discernment by the mind of god when
[1:13:43] you're in when there's love is in you
[1:13:45] hallelujah
[1:13:46] fall in love
[1:13:48] hallelujah that you can be enabled into
[1:13:52] a life-changing situation
[1:13:54] hallelujah it says here
[1:13:57] now watch this influence that comes down
[1:13:59] on the day of pentecost
[1:14:01] he says watch him he didn't go around
[1:14:03] and say this is peter now after the
[1:14:05] spirit of the lord had come down after
[1:14:07] they had tarried in jerusalem and the
[1:14:09] power from on high the thing that would
[1:14:11] change them came down and it says watch
[1:14:13] him he didn't go around and say some
[1:14:15] kind of a creed he went right straight
[1:14:18] back to the word
[1:14:19] this is what the spirit of god brings us
[1:14:21] to this is what real inspiration real
[1:14:24] influence of heaven brings us to the
[1:14:26] word your life goes back to the word the
[1:14:30] things that you say anchored in the word
[1:14:32] and it takes you to the word and it's
[1:14:34] the word that speaks and lives a change
[1:14:37] that's why it's so important to be
[1:14:39] inspired of god hallelujah don't warm
[1:14:43] that pure in your strengths for 20 30
[1:14:46] years and live a life of mundane
[1:14:48] christianity that's not our portion
[1:14:51] hallelujah it's not man ages we're going
[1:14:54] beyond that we're going beyond an
[1:14:56] intellectual understanding we're going
[1:14:57] beyond it to a supernatural inspiration
[1:15:00] to a supernatural so i encourage you be
[1:15:02] zealous
[1:15:03] be zealous for the supernatural
[1:15:06] who here is zealous for the supernatural
[1:15:08] who loves it when god moves i believe
[1:15:10] tonight god is going to move
[1:15:12] hallelujah when we stand and we pray
[1:15:14] god's going to move because i believe
[1:15:16] that through this time as was spoken
[1:15:18] that there if there's anything in any
[1:15:20] life that's fixed it's sorted because i
[1:15:23] believe we're sincere people and
[1:15:25] sometimes all we need is peter says to
[1:15:26] bring to remembrance little things and
[1:15:29] under the inspiration of that moment god
[1:15:31] begins to knock on you like he knocked
[1:15:33] on peter's side he was stuck in a prison
[1:15:35] if the head of the church can be stuck
[1:15:37] in a prison through some devil's you
[1:15:40] know temptation and got him physically
[1:15:41] in a prison the head of the church and
[1:15:43] then an angel comes and knocks him on
[1:15:45] the side and says rise up peter and walk
[1:15:47] out of this prison and peter had to walk
[1:15:50] out of that prison and walk right out
[1:15:52] under the word of the angel of the lord
[1:15:54] hallelujah so if the angel of the lord's
[1:15:56] come to your seat tonight and he's begin
[1:15:58] to knock on your side you see what
[1:16:00] happens when you stand up and those
[1:16:02] chains begin to fall around you because
[1:16:04] you're the word of the angel because
[1:16:06] there was people that were praying under
[1:16:08] inspiration and they prayed and they
[1:16:10] touched heaven and he sent his angel to
[1:16:13] peter and rescued him amen you may be
[1:16:16] peter or you may be those people tonight
[1:16:18] but whatever you may be god
[1:16:20] will change lives because you are a life
[1:16:23] changer
[1:16:24] just accept it
[1:16:25] can everyone just say i'm a life changer
[1:16:28] i am a life changer hallelujah
[1:16:32] amen god christ in you the hope of glory
[1:16:35] amen it's christ in you amen hallelujah
[1:16:38] out of your belly shall flow rivers of
[1:16:40] living water amen
[1:16:43] lay everything at his feet now
[1:16:45] be prepared now as we pray
[1:16:47] hallelujah it says here
[1:16:50] peter didn't go around and say some kind
[1:16:51] of a creed he went right straight back
[1:16:53] to the word and said you men of
[1:16:54] jerusalem you that dwell in judea let us
[1:16:56] be known unto you and hearken to my
[1:16:58] words they are not drunk as you suppose
[1:17:00] seeing it as the third hour of the day
[1:17:02] but this is that that was spoke by the
[1:17:04] prophet joel and it shall come to pass
[1:17:07] in the last days saith god i'll pour out
[1:17:09] my spirit upon all flesh
[1:17:12] they were influenced by the word
[1:17:15] to the word
[1:17:16] oh i like that
[1:17:17] it's so solid
[1:17:19] across the solid rock i stand all the
[1:17:22] grounds are sinking saying
[1:17:24] when i'm influenced of my king it
[1:17:27] anchors me in the word it anchors you in
[1:17:30] the word it brings solidity and
[1:17:32] foundation so that you can stand and
[1:17:36] speak and let him inspire you
[1:17:39] to be a life changer and i'm not just
[1:17:41] meeting tonight for this prayer meeting
[1:17:42] but i mean forevermore
[1:17:44] because you see the game if you want to
[1:17:46] call it that
[1:17:48] excuse me for the terminology but this
[1:17:50] last game you could say
[1:17:52] this last stretch of the race this last
[1:17:54] part of the fight
[1:17:56] that
[1:17:57] if you can take an og in the old organ
[1:17:59] you pull out the stops and you and when
[1:18:01] you pull all the stops out it's just all
[1:18:02] of its glory all the sounding all the
[1:18:05] symphony everything
[1:18:07] all the stops have been pulled out the
[1:18:09] devil's got all his stops out all of us
[1:18:11] stuff's out on the earth he's doing
[1:18:12] everything he can to stop the river
[1:18:14] flowing in your life but there's nothing
[1:18:16] to stop the shout that is in god's
[1:18:19] people
[1:18:20] there's no devil no resistance no lie
[1:18:23] nothing that can remain plausible when
[1:18:25] you get in god's presence and tonight i
[1:18:27] believe that we can pray
[1:18:29] and we can just really reach heaven we
[1:18:31] make everything right hallelujah it
[1:18:33] doesn't take long it just it just means
[1:18:35] a sincere heart before god put those
[1:18:37] things aside put all those resentments
[1:18:39] aside put unforgiveness aside whatever
[1:18:42] anyone's done just forget it lay it all
[1:18:44] at god's feet and let the blood cleanse
[1:18:46] you so that we can enter in and there's
[1:18:48] no hindering spirit so that when we come
[1:18:51] together that and god's influence and
[1:18:53] the presence of god will be clean by his
[1:18:57] grace by his merit not our worthiness
[1:19:00] his worthiness
[1:19:01] his worthiness
[1:19:03] amen
[1:19:04] and all arises they were influenced by
[1:19:06] the word to the word it ought to do us
[1:19:09] the same way
[1:19:11] they got an actions yes
[1:19:13] when his promise was fulfilled when they
[1:19:16] seen that jesus promised them
[1:19:19] that he would send the promise of the
[1:19:20] father upon them luke 24 49 behold i
[1:19:24] send the promise of my father upon you
[1:19:26] but tarry you
[1:19:27] terry don't mean pray it just means wait
[1:19:30] terry means wait wait up there at the
[1:19:33] city of jerusalem until you're endued
[1:19:34] with power from on high and when this
[1:19:37] influence of the holy ghost struck them
[1:19:39] it filled them they sing the word
[1:19:42] that jesus promised fulfilled
[1:19:45] oh glory
[1:19:46] hallelujah now i wonder if it would take
[1:19:49] the same influence on us
[1:19:52] this evening
[1:19:54] if we seen what he promised to do in the
[1:19:56] last days fulfilled what kind of an
[1:19:58] influence would it give us what
[1:20:01] all we have seen done in these last days
[1:20:03] ought to put us in action hallelujah
[1:20:06] it sure ought to
[1:20:08] with reverence and humility
[1:20:10] and an action who believes that action
[1:20:14] you know we as human beings we get
[1:20:16] exposed to great things and it becomes
[1:20:18] common but i i just want you to pray to
[1:20:21] the lord tonight lord reverse that amen
[1:20:24] reverse the commonality of this glorious
[1:20:26] message of all the supernatural that's
[1:20:28] taken place right here in this place
[1:20:31] with this vision let alone all that's
[1:20:33] gone since the last uh of the 60s and
[1:20:36] when the when the message came but what
[1:20:38] about now
[1:20:39] oh lord let us never make it common you
[1:20:42] know the ark returns and we gotta dance
[1:20:44] amen david danced around that ark he got
[1:20:47] excited and i just want you to ask god
[1:20:50] bring back the excitement bring back
[1:20:52] that zeal for the supernatural let me
[1:20:54] rejoice
[1:20:56] at what he's doing because i want to be
[1:20:58] impressed by it i want my heart to be
[1:21:00] touched amen
[1:21:03] oh it's a normal human thing to be
[1:21:05] things to become common but we can
[1:21:07] reverse that we don't have to
[1:21:09] surrender to a humanistic
[1:21:12] fallen nature
[1:21:14] thing
[1:21:16] glory
[1:21:17] now i wonder oh i've read that
[1:21:20] he goes on to talk about the pillar of
[1:21:22] fire and the appearing of the third
[1:21:23] exodus and you know we read these things
[1:21:26] and we've seen every type and we've seen
[1:21:27] every shadow and we've seen the glorious
[1:21:29] word unfold even before our eyes and our
[1:21:31] hearts and we've rejoiced for many years
[1:21:35] but never let it become common never let
[1:21:37] it become i've heard that before amen
[1:21:39] but make it so real to me lord excite me
[1:21:43] lord bring back that that first love
[1:21:46] experience
[1:21:47] hallelujah let's stand

[1:22:32] are walking after the spirit tonight you

[1:22:36] have because i have and i've made it
[1:22:37] right with my god and and and you've

[1:22:44] us to forgive us but not just that but
[1:22:46] to make it right to cleanse us to
[1:22:49] deliver us amen it's not your battle
