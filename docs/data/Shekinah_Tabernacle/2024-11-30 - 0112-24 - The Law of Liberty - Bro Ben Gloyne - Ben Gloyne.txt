morning a TR you feel at home amen praise God thank you brother Isaac thank you musicians amen how's everyone today trust you well praise the Lord amen let's um let's go to the scripture this morning we're going to go to Psalm 119 and uh verses uh 41 to to 48 amen I feel there's a real Liberty uh in the house of God today Lord amen so basically I brother Isaac's already sung my sermon preached my you know sermon so we can go home amen so because I want to talk about living in the law of Liberty we're under a different law it's a good one the law of Liberty is a very good one amen so amen just going to read here so Psalm 119: 41-48 he says let thy mercies come also unto me oh Lord even thy salvation according to Thy word so shall I have uh wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me for I trust in Thy Word and take not the word of Truth utterly out of my mouth for I have hoped in thy judgments so shall I keep thy law continually forever and ever and I will walk at liberty for I seek thy precepts I will speak of thy testimonies also before Kings and will not be ashamed and I'll Del Delight myself in thy Commandments which I have loved my hands also will I lift up uh unto thy Commandments which I have loved and I'll meditate in thy statutes amen so let's uh let's bow our heads in word of prayer this morning morning if you have a need you just want to slip your hand up to the Lord amen gracious father we thank you so much as we have have gathered this day Lord in your great presence we want to First tell you we love you with all our hearts today thank you for what you've done and what you're doing Lord we praise your mighty name we thank you that Lord that truly the gospel is the good news Lord father thank you Lord It's good news for us we want to praise your name this morning asking Lord you'd have preeminence I pray that Lord your blood Lord I plead your blood over us as a people Lord over everyone who may be streaming as well may you be our portion Lord this day may you anoint your word as we've read it Lord anoint speaker and hearer dear God may you just come and take complete control us want to get myself out of the way for you to do what you want to do father so may you have your way we love you Lord we thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning so I want to talk about the law of Liberty which which we uh find ourselves under this morning amen so as we read here in Psalms David will be writing I will walk at liberty for I seek thy precept so there is a there's a liberty for the people of God now we know that uh in in um you Paul would Paul would speak of these things and he'd say you know uh here in 2 Corinthians he's speaking with Moses and how Moses's face was veiled and the hearts of Israel were veiled but in the in Christ that Veil will be taken away but he's saying now where the Spirit uh now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty so there's not bondage there's not depression there's not a heavy weight that binds us down but there's a liberty for us to walk as God would have us walk and be as God made us to be amen but we with all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into that into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord so there now there is Liberty I pray that we would you have have such a time of Liberty not just in service but but in our everyday life that we can walk as God would ordain us to walk now this word liberty and and I think maybe in this day and age we kind of forget about the uh because we live in a a a a a country of Liberty that's right you can believe what you want to believe you can dress how you want to dress you can do what you want to do there's no in terms of social constructs we have great Liberty but in the but uh but I'm not talking about a a a a natural Liberty I'm talking about a spiritual Liberty now now the Apostle Paul would say when he speaking about Liberty here it say it'd say to go as to be unrestrained so to go at pleasure so basically to do what your desire would be to do now we know when in the Lord this is a desire to do as God would have you do right and that is to be as a citizen not a slave and it means whether to be either Freeborn or ma uh manumitted however you say that which means someone who's been released from slavery so he's saying it doesn't matter what state you were born into or found yourself in you can go free as a citizen now if we're a citizen of a kingdom or or a nation you've got the rights of that Nation right so as a New Zealand citizen I have the rights as a New Zealand citizen to to to to live under the rights of this nation now if I was under a different Nation I'd have different rights so for example if I was living in Afghanistan I'd have different rights to New Zealand you know if I lived in America if I lived in different parts of the earth I'd have different rights based on my citizenship right now we have a we have greater than Earthly citizenship I pray you just just you know let's have church today all right let's have church today amen because because remember the purpose of the message is for us to be reminded and told who we are in Christ right that's the whole purpose of the of of of Malachi 4 coming to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers is that we would know who we are and we need to be reminded who we are amen I think it's very important we know who we are because the devil in this day wants to mix up everyone's identity right so that's why I just want to talk about these things and I've spoken about these things before but we find ourselves here again amen so now we have a citizenship in heaven right so so therefore we have the rights of Heaven hallelujah amen so we have the rights of Heaven amen so so we don't have the you know so when when we're in this law of Liberty which we are if you're in Christ amen then then we don't live under the under the slavery of the devil anymore we don't live based on these five senses right we don't live based on this flesh we don't walk according to our feelings or the vibe or you know things are going on no no we walk by the word right because we're under a different citizenship see when we're born we walked by our flesh very much so you he children I want this I want this I need this I want this it's all about what their flesh wants right that's why McDonald's is a multi-billion Dollar business is because it panders to the Flesh and it's and it's popular because they've tapped into what what taste buds and how to manipulate all those things and price points and whatever more and it's very popular it would never be popular if it was super healthy and very Bland it would have closed long the first McDonald's would have been the last McDonald's right but you see but you see because it panders to the flesh it it it it pulls people in by an Earthly desire and that's how we're born that way right but we live under a different citizenship if you know the Lord see more than just coming to church if you know Christ you're in a different citizenship amen you live in a different whole world than than this world would live amen so we we are unrestrained so whatever is restraining you this morning you got to realize you're under a law of Liberty that that that that that thing that holds you back must let go in the name of Jesus Christ amen because we are called to go as unrestrained now if we look into uh here with um you know the Lord would the Lord would stand in Nazareth now to me it's amazing when you look at what he's going to declare to to the Jews they've had four 400 years of Silence from Malachi till John now the Messiah himself is standing in flesh he he came to church this was his custom to go to church and uh so he would stand up and he was given the book of The Prophet Isaias and when he had opened the book he found the place that it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance of the captives and the recovering of the sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is the scripture fulfilled in your ear and all bear him witness and wondered at the gracious Words which proceeded out of his mouth and and they said is this not Joseph's son so to me this is amazing when you see the word himself opens the book and then and then begins to reveal to the people this is their inheritance this is the season you live in you're not going to live under the blood of bulls and goats no more where it's a you know but you're going to but but the the spirit of God is here to set you at Liberty to set you in Freedom Amen to to to deliver you from these things so you know when you think about who was declaring this it was not a religious leader declaring this it was not a a leader of a bible school that had a nice idea that maybe put some scriptures together and you know tied some things and say this is what it means no this is The Interpreter of the word himself standing there in flesh opening the book declaring what was in the book to them you see so it was incredible how this was the Messiah himself telling them this is the season you're living in I'm going to set you at Liberty the prophecy of Isaiah that maybe people debated maybe they talked about maybe they would wrestle with was now living in front of them and they were and they were living in it amen but you see how often is it that spirits will come and try and take someone else's inheritance and place it on someone else you know how often that spirits will come and displace the word for people like for example you know I've been talking I don't think we're going to be talking much more but talking with a sect or a group that think that they are the 144,000 Jews they're not Jewish at all they're gentile people they think it's some tribes and you you know they think they're the Lost tribe of Israel and they think that you know the day of the Jew is over there's no more grace for them you know they are they are it I thought what a deceiving spirit that would come along because we know the Bible tells us that the Jews have three and A2 years of Grace allocated to them still am mean as Paul would say in the Book of Romans he said he said that they are blinded until the fullness of the Gentiles comes in right and the prophecy of Daniel says that there's 3 and 1/2 years of Daniel 70 weeks that that that is for the Jews right we know these things you know there's prophecy in Zechariah saying that he'll o open the fountain in the House of David for them right so so what is causing them to think they are they are someone else's inheritance it's not God right it's not God it's some it's it's a spirit that's come along and how many other groups are out there saying they're the 144,000 they are not the Jews are right but what happens is that there's a promise given to a people and the devil will take that try and take that promise from them and give it to another group of people and how often does he come to you now and try and make you think the promises of God are not yours I mean to try and make you think that they for someone else they're from a different age therefore for maybe in the future somewhere but the Bible says today is the day of salvation I mean today is the day of the promises of God I mean that's what our God tells us does he not amen so we're got to realize that whenever a thought comes into your mind that no you know maybe you're not the bride maybe you won't overcome maybe you'll never get out of this problem I mean that's a spirit trying to dispossess you of a promise but you've got to look into the law of Liberty of the word of God and see what it speaks about you and actually look at that and continue it and say no God you've given me the promise it wasn't a man that gave me the promise it was you amen amen because we're living in a day where everyone's inheritance is being allotted out that's right just like in Moses's day when they were traveling from from Egypt into the promised land and you know Moses would tell the children of Israel you know you're going to pass through Moab don't fuss with them that's their inheritance I mean Edom that's their inheritance leave them there these different ones you all the all the nations around were allocated an inheritance right but the but the thing is with the with the believer now you know they belonged on the right side of Jordan they did not belong on the Wilderness side of Jordan their inheritance was going to be on the right right side of Jordan but it was what kept a half the tribe of Manassa and different tribes out of the promised land is because they looked at the cattle they had and said well actually this side of Jordan the wrong side of Jordan is the place for what we actually have right now so what they brought with them hindered them from going into the land what they should have done is said well God you we've got this cattle you've gave us the cattle if you want it in the land you'll bring it over with us if not well we're going to have a cattle sale and the price of beef is going to go way down because the Market's going to be flooding right but what they did instead is they said well this is what we have this is what we're journeying with and this is going to dictate to us where we settle now how often it is it people would say well my family was this way I'm this way I'm stubborn they're stubborn our last name should have been stubborn it's a trait of the family I guess this is just and so what will that that will cause someone to settle in the wrong inheritance right or there's always being lust bir or trouble or unforgiveness or whatever these family strains that come down but you see in the L of Liberty those things have to let go I mean those things do not define you the word of God defines you amen that your identity is not in your natural lineage anymore amen but it's in the word of God Amen so those things will keep people unfortunately on the wrong side of the Jordan but You' got to realize that no when God allocated the inheritance of the Bride in this day it wasn't on the wrong side of Jordan it wasn't just looking you know outward in but no it was that we would be in Christ amen in our Promised Land amen because we belong you to realize you belong in the Holy Ghost that's where you belong more than just coming to church you belong in Christ amen that's your inheritance this morning I'm here to read the will I mean the Lord Jesus died that we'd Reed promises and that's what preaching should do is actually say this is your portion it's not your portion to be in debt to sin it's not your portion to be burdened down with troubles no your portion is you'd walk at Liberty amen that you'd walk as Christ walked amen you'd walk in Freedom amen that you would not walk in so sure we'll go through troubles but as I've said probably no I don't think I've said it enough we'll go through the trouble am it's not your end they went through the Wilderness but the Wilderness wasn't their End Amen they went through some battles but the battle wasn't their End Amen it was actually living in the what God gave them to possess amen so God has told his bride in this day that we belong on the right side of Jordan amen with the resurrection remember the resurrection happened in the promised land Abraham buried Sarah in the Promised Land amen job was buried in that land Joseph commanded when they leave Egypt take my bones and put them in the land amen Jacob you know he could have had a great tomb down in Egypt but he said no bury me back in the promised land why because his inheritance he knew by his Birthright was I'm going to go on a resurrection one day where my redeemer liveth am me where my redeemer stands upon the Earth but it's in the land and that's why the prophet told us don't bury me in some church system bury me in Christ I mean don't bury me in a religion bury me in Christ amen cuz those which are in Christ God will take with him am mean you say well how do I get into Christ take God at his word see I think we complicate things way too much well how do you do that you repent you give your life to the Lord don't just come to church give your life to the Lord open your heart to him let him come and rearrange your life and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost AM me what's that now your Resurrection ready hallu Hallelujah you got to realize that's your portion that's why God pul you and that's why God's called you am mean not just to sit in a Pew but to walk with him in his resurrection am mean because remember God's inheritance for us is himself like he told like he told Abraham I am your exceedingly great reward amen his reward wasn't just a promised land no it was God himself amen like brother Bram when he you know after he saw orl Roberts's state-ofthe-art building and he saw uh Tommy Osborne's headquarters you know he felt pretty small because they had great big multi-million dollar businesses going on and systems and regimes and he had a little trailer with a typewriter in the back of it that was his office you think about that here was the ministry God used to spare here to post world to Healing Revival and not just that but to call a bride to be reunited with the word of God and he had a c he had a trailer there in his backyard or wherever it was just with one typewriter and he felt so small saying Lord I guess you you you can't trust me with this kind of stuff that's why I don't have it but then he heard a voice said look up I'm your portion I'm your inheritance I'm your reward so those ones had their things on this Earth but I'm not looking for rewards on this side I'm looking for rewards on that side am me that my inheritance lays over amen over in glory hallelujah amen so our our our um promises are all in Christ Our inheritance is his amen see he's saying you belong in me I'm your exceedingly abundant portion I'm your inheritance I'm your resting place Hallelujah I am the resurrection and the life all that I am is yours amen our lord Jesus has set us free to enjoy every promise of the word amen not just some of them every promise amen we're at Liberty that our desires in him can be manifested we're at Liberty see we don't need to ask anyone permission can we we don't have to ask the devil we don't have to have to ask anyone can we receive all Promises of you know of God no because God says it's yours amen so whatever hindering spirit is coming against you you have a right to say get out of my way in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen praise the Lord now so here was the Messiah himself he was telling everyone where they belonged but they said is this not Joseph's son are we still there you we there now brother Bram says as in recognizing your day and its message he says now I'm going to say something National Force put Israel in her Homeland National Force will put the church and the World Council of churches but the power of God will put the people people in The Bride the world forces this way the world forces that way but God forces upward the spirit of God which is the word of God my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place cuz she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in Christ she will put her uh will put her in her place no National Force will do it but the National Force that drive Israel to the Homeland the national forces of the Council of churches will drive every organization into it but the power of God will raise the bride into Glory out of it amen so we got to realize now it's not National force that pushes the bride together it's not National Force that puts people in The Bride so it's not our national force of our intellect our ability that will push people into the bride that will actually cause people to get saved no it's the power of God Amen that will put the people in The Bride you got to read see friends our inheritance is a Rapture remember it doesn't matter where you came from what your past was that's irrelevant in God's economy am mean that don't matter am me the woman at the well had a bad past but that that had nothing to do with that c gen of God on the inside of him am mean Abraham had a lot of shady deals a lot of trouble in his life that didn't stop him being the father of faith I mean David committed adultery all these you know all the Believers down Through the Ages have done some nasty things but yet that wasn't who they were in God Amen so don't let your past you're at liberty to leave your past behind you're a perfect Liberty to leave your past behind and walk on with God hallah amen so it's so it's the power of God Amen that will put that will put the bride into Glory see cuz there's a law of Liberty see gravity is a law right you can fight against it all you want but it's a law yeah okay there's law of electricity there different laws and if you want something to work do it according to the law right there's like a law of lift right you know aerodynamics of a of a of an airplane wing the the right Brothers has finally got that law right and what they do it they lift it off the ground who's ever seen footage of that we could all make a better airplane than that you see in this day and age but what did they do they they didn't just haphazardly make the make the wings they designed it because they realized there lift just like when you you know you're driving along you put your hand out the window you tilt it up there's a lift that happens right right so so so they were so they took off they made a record of the first human powered flight by Tapp into that law of lift they didn't work against that law if you wanted to work against the law you would have added weight on the plane and you would have made the wings upside down because if the Wing's upside down then it'll actually cause you to be stuck to the ground there be the lift will actually be in a opposite side right so they work things according to the law so if we want to if we want to walk in in a greater Liberty we must walk according to the law of Liberty right now that law of Liberty is looking to see what God has said about you amen and focusing on that right it's really that simple this is not a complicated deal what God said about me is who I am amen right what he said about me not what my past says about me not what the accuser of the Brethren says about me not what others say about me not even what I know about me what he said about me amen hallelujah praise the Lord so now the power of God will put the people into the bride and that power will take amen the uh see as I said about those who try and make the 144,000 some Gentiles and displace the displace the um the Jews from their promise so the Devil comes along and tries to make us think that we are not fit to be the bride of Christ who's had that thought that's a real common thing isn't it because the devil's trying to push you off your inheritance you don't you don't belong here you're not worthy you've done this and remember he's the accuser of the Brethren if he's accusing you you should say praise God I'm part of the Brethren amen hallelujah why because he's accusing you right always use what he does against you against him just take vice versa like brother Braham said when he was trying to you know meet God there was a pull towards God he you know would you know thought he'd write God a letter and put it on going you know put it on a tree cuz God will walk there you know you know through the woods one day and read his letter then he said well you I'll go pray and he goes into the C and he's you know trying to say do I put my hands like this do I do this how am I meant to pray and you the devil came along and said well you've left it too late and then so he actually used that against and say well God if even if I'm too late anyway I'm going to tell you about it anyhow and had had a glorious conversion he met the Lord because what he used the accuser of the Brethren was trying to keep him down but the law of Liberty in his life allowed him to use out against the devil and he got what he needed praise God so he used the devil's accusations against him do the opposite amen amen so there is this of course there's an accusation that comes against us we are not worthy or fit Amen to be the bride of Christ right how could God ever work through a people like us but remember there's a law of Liberty right it's not about us it's about him you start to focus on you you're looking at the wrong person right so now as as as God would in the beginning make a bride for for for Adam forgot this here he says now and the Lord said it is not good that man should be alone I'll make him and help meet for him and out of the ground the Lord formed every beast of the field uh um and every foul of the year and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to all cattle and to the foul of the air and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found and help meat for him so Adam named everything but every time Adam saw an animal come up doesn't matter how how similar it looked to a human being remember because he saw the serpent right upright could talk reason all these things but there was nothing in him said this is part of me right this is not part of me right so so so he could not find the other part of himself and so now finally the Lord but then I guess the Lord needed him to realize this because really his the help meat for him was in him and had to come out and then so now the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the Flesh and stead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said now this is bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man so when when Adam saw Eve he saw the feminine part of himself I see me walking towards me amen hallelujah this basically what he's saying cuz remember before the fall they were called Adam they had one name she was only called Eve the mother of all living after the fall right so so they they were called by the same name Adam Adam saw himself in femin feminine form walking towards him now a help meet is not a subordinate it's not someone who's less okay now this may be very Elementary for everyone and praise God if it is we're back in Sunday school but a help meat is not a something lower it's equal remember because under the blood of Jesus Christ the bride has been elevated be joint ears with Christ right we're not we're not subordinate I mean we're not I mean we're we're subordinate in the fact that we are under him but we're not less than him remember a a a marriage is between a man and a woman right that's what Believers believe right you don't have someone Marrying an animal you don't have like marries like amen maybe Sisters You may look at your husband say are you sure but you know like Mary's like right amen we'll get there one day I think anyway but you see so this help meet as the Bible say this meat for him is actually one word and it means the part opposite especially a counterpart or a mate now that word counterpart I love this he says a thing that fits perfectly amen just it's so it's not something that doesn't fit we got to realize we fit with the word I mean when you heard this message something in you said this is home this is me something in you says I fit with this this this this Rings true you know I was in I was in different D you know I I had to go to Presbyterian boarding school Anglican boarding school went to uh Pentecostal Church Charismatic Church nothing seemed to fit but when I heard that voice good evening friends that word spoke to me like no nothing else ever has and will I mean why because I'm going to realize I fit with this see many times we think we just stumble into this or well my parents were raised in this or my grandparents were in this and this is just a family thing we do but there comes a season I pray now is Amen to all of us that it becomes a personal relationship with Jesus Christ am mean it's not your mother's experience your dad's experience your grandparents experience or or the culture that you find yourself raising no it's you and God Amen so you begin to realize that you fit the word amen now I'm not talking about your natural ability there's a there's a seed in you right am mean that fits there's a Harmony what a Harmony that is between the bride and the bridegroom Christ the word and is bride am mean a Harmony of love and faith working together Hallelujah am mean it's something that completes it's a compliment this is a help meet I mean something that completes the other half so so Eve completed Adam right Eve without Adam was5 of a person right so so they completed they complimented one another so what he now lacked she had and what she lacked he had they were complimentary are we all here today are we all okay you say not my spouse you need a revelation all right you need a revelation no we compliment one another well we have different um personalities and different likes and different things yeah but you when you bring both together praise God yeah there's a saying Opposites Attract and that's true you say we're very similar that's fine as well right but you see you compliment one another God brought you together you said we made out in the world God was guiding your life before you even knew it he was with you the whole time amen he never he always had his hand upon your life I mean didn't matter what you were going through the struggles the troubles the fog whatever God had his hand upon your life because he was determined they're going to hear my law of Liberty in their season they're going to walk with me they're going to know me in the power of my resurrection and that's it and Satan you've got to let go of them they have no right you have no right to hold them back anymore there's a law that's been declared am mean there's a gospel trumpet that's been blown amen that there's a law of Liberty that must be manifested Hallelujah that's why if you look at Rahab now Rahab was in was in um she was in Jericho right amen but now when God formed Rahab he did not see a hot in Jer sealed up in a gentile system he saw a part of himself he saw the lineage of Jesus Christ passing through her body amen she that's how she was seen in the mind of God so now now now to me you I love it how how Joshua they had to March around the city but then on the 13th time however many time it was on the seventh day they went seven times right all right I remember Jimmy's um uh when he preached on that put the question up had to think about that anyway you see there's a reason they blew the trumpets and they shouted to cause the walls to come down because through that trumpet was a jubilee cry a jubilee sound I mean there was a declaration now that Liberty a law of Liberty was now spoken into Jericho amen so the so so there was Rahab her pass bound her down you know her her City bound her down there was a death sentence over the whole place but yet she found Grace in the sight of of God because she realized if judgment was coming Mercy was coming too amen and that's what happened with you and I we see the world falling apart but we realize that there's judgment coming there's got to be Mercy somewhere because our God is rich in Mercy amen he's rich in Mercy this morning amen so when she when those trumpets were blowing what happened is that law of Liberty caused every obstacle in rahab's life to be destroyed amen it caused the walls to come down am mean it caused it caused every hindrance to come down and it caused her past to die why because every man that she ever you know slept with died when that City was destroyed her past was killed am mean so then when finally the day that she uh was married into Israel and maybe the rabbi don't know if they do if they stand up and say if there if there's anyone here who who who who who can testify against this Union stopping speak up and maybe maybe there'll be just some little uh Israelite princess would get up because they were going to marry um Salomon you here's a prince of Judah this is the one that Rahab married and maybe you they thought no I'm going to put an end to this cuz he's meant to be mine maybe she stood up maybe someone stood up and said you have no right to marry this Gentile and then maybe you know Solomon would have said okay you you say she did these things where's the witnesses you'd hear a pin drop cuz God takes care of everything he takes care of your past see she was now at Liberty the law of Liberty had come into her life cuz she was a citizen of Israel am mean now how much more you and I friends we've heard the a a word of Liberty amen you got to realize now which voice you going to listen to which voice you going to Panda to the voice of Liberty or you going to listen to that the voice of the devil holding you down so you're going to realize if something's making you reason away following the word that's not God it's not God causing you to reason away the word of God that's not the law of Liberty speaking the law of Liberty wants you to fulfill his word amen he wants you so for example people wrestle about being baptized or not what is why is there that wrestling because the devil says no I don't want you to actually come under the full law of Liberty to be identified in the word you see but God's calling you come amen what does hinder thee it's not God Amen prise the lord it's not God Amen praise the Lord so so it's something that compliments we haven't gone off the slide yet amen they are one remarkably similar to another amen a counterpart to help me they're remarkably similar now we may we all look different God is a god of variety I say thank God for that amen thank God you're not all like me praise God hallelujah I'm happy about that and you can say Amen too that's fine amen but you see now see but but but we are remarkably similar to Christ why because there's something in us that actually believes his word see brother bam said when you know before there sun moon and stars he said let there be and he believed his own word so he had faith in what was spoken right and then now what does every believer do they have faith in the word spoken amen they have faith in the word ultimately this is this is what makes us Believers we take God at his word above our feelings our whatever whatever whatever we take God in his word we believe his word amen so so we are remarkable similar praise the Lord you know they see you know it's like when Jesus was here you know the days of his flesh and he would ask his disciples in Mark 16 who do men say that I am and they said you're Jer you John the Baptist or Jeremiah or one of the prophets because what they saw Jesus do was remarkably similar aming to what the prophets did now we know the reason for that is because because Jesus Christ was the fullness of the god here bodly right he was God unlimited all that God was was in Christ right but upon the prophets was was was God in measure so it's like a you know like light you have a three-sided prism you shine light through it you know the white light goes in that comes out red and yellow orange green and all those things right so the green is not the fullness of the light but it's part of the light same with the blue the yellow Indigo whatever it is right but when you put those back all together you get white light again you get the fullness of the light so when so when the prophets were here it was God in portion amen right but now Christ was the fullness of all the prophets were amen cuz he was the full word right so now when they saw Jesus do certain things they say that's like Jeremiah he's a weeping prophet that's like Moses he did this this is like John the Baptist you know they could see what what the previous prophets did and that's sort in his life why because he was remarkably similar why because the same life was in him now I pray to God that when you know when when when you roll out of bed in the morning a shutter goes through hell like that through every imp through every devil there's a shutter goes through them saying they're awake again they're awake again because when they look at you they see something that even humans don't see I mean they see the life of God I mean they see there's a fire the pillar of fire is burning Veil behind human skins once again and so when they look at you they see something that is that is to them terrifyingly familiar to what they've seen in past ages amen so when God when when Michael and his angels fought against his dragon you know in his angels in Revelations 12 before the foundation of the world Amen that look in Michael's eyes is now in you amen that look was in Noah's eyes it was in moses' eyes in John the Baptist's eyes I it was in every believer's eyes was that same look cuz God was veiled in them I mean God was living himself out of them and the same thing of course in the life of our Lord Jesus and then of course in the upper room that same God came down and the look that was in the disciples eyes was now different they looked the same the house looked the same but there's a Burning Flame the lights turned on Hallelujah I pray the lights turn on Amen not looking here in particular but I pray the lights turn on right that there's now there's that burning Eternal Flame is now burning amen so so whenever the devil I pray that when the devil sees you he sees that life and he says there they are remarkably similar am what the first church was and what the end time bride is they say they are remarkably similar one to another Hallelujah am mean one having the same functional characteristics as another it's counterpart amen what's the same function in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they'll take up any deadly thing that shall not harm them they'll Che on serpents amen they will they will the gospel will be manifested in power same function what is the function of the church that God will come and dwell in us and fulfill his plan upon the Earth remember he purchased everyone that day on Calvary right amen but he's going to live through us that Redemption would come through the body to everyone around us we got to realize I've got a function I've got a purpose amen I'm not here just filling up time amen but I've got a function what is that to worship and praise God in every circumstance Amen to live for him am me because that's the law of Liberty the law of Liberty dictates to you that your worship is not meant to be dictated to by circumstance amen trouble comes in you're at liberty to praise God hardship comes in you're at liberty to praise God God you don't know the way forward you're at liberty to praise God that is not that is not what's happening in your life controls no it's the law of Liberty it's like Caleb and Joshua they were under the law of Liberty they came to trouble they didn't murmur like the rest because their walk with God wasn't based on what God was doing it was or where God was leading them through it was based on who God was amen so they went there they were praising God in the desert praising God going through Jordan praising God on the other side praising God why because they were under the law of Liberty they knew that their citizenship was not based on natural Israel it was in heaven praise God Amen you see the life of God see the devil I pray shutters at the thought of you because he thought he snuffed out the life of God long ago but he can't do it amen the life of God can never be snuff snuffed out praise God Amen even as brother Brown would preach the statue of a perfect man but he didn't call it that do you know that he said this morning want to speak on the subject or teach rather of building the living Tabernacle building the living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place the perfect man amen that's what he's preaching right so the and and and this is this is what happens is when the Living God comes into you and I then what happens is we are a help meat for him thank you Lord amen as he you know that that when when people see us they should see his character on display more than anything more than Miracles more than signs and wonders they should see the characteristics of the word the nature of Christ in you and I living out amen you say well the power of God will put you in that position amen because it says in Romans 8:29 for whom he did Forno he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren praise God remember that's your law of Liberty got to look into that say Lord you predes me to be conformed to the image of your son which is the word of God Amen praise the Lord now let's go here because we got to realize see the devil wants to try and push us down that we are you know we are nothing no God has made us something we may be a bunch of nothings but God has made us something right what is that something jewels in his crown love gifts to Christ brother B says many times when people come forward and give their lives he says Lord I present them to you as love gifts amen you say I've got no value you're a love gift and God knows how to give the best gifts amen he's The Ultimate Gift Giver he's now brother R would say now the greatest thing that God could give man outside of Salvation was a wife aen that she was to comfort him help him to bless him to console him to be a real companion to him amen praise God now this is the same now if you take it in the spiritual sense where where you know the greatest thing that God could give Christ if I put it that way is a bride that's you and I you're under the law of Liberty to become this amen praise the Lord but you got to see now we going to look into this where you say well what is now driving what's motivating my life cuz these two laws CU remember we are still in these bodies right we these bodies need changing and more just because they're getting old yep remember you get a certain point it's all downhill right it's not the sense that these bodies get old we want them change it's because of the nature the sin nature that's in this flesh right the wrestling match that we go through every day amen because this thing is is bound by a chain of circumstance which is the holy ghost in your life right but it's rather you feed the animal or not who do you who do you lean to amen because the remember the law of Liberty is greater than the law of sin and death yeah amen amen but you see now you got to look at now what so if we go here now so James would ask the question who is a wise man and endured with knowled endued with knowledge among you let him show out of um of a good conversation with his works with meekness of wisdom but if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts Glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but is Earthly cental and devilish I'll say it is not the law of Liberty right if you got striving and envy and bitterness and stuff no that is not the law you should be living under amen all with me now amen for where envy and strife is there is confusion in every evil work but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then Peaceable gentle easy to be intreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace so now we have a choice now if the wisdom in our hearts is strife and envy and you got to realize that is not the law of Liberty right remember we're called to live out I'm just going to repeat this because you realize what law am I under what rights remember a law brings rights right so what rights do you have amen under the law of Liberty you have a right to walk with God that his life and nature will live out of you right amen but then you can be still a slave and then you can let your own natural carnal life live out but I think no we need to look at now what is what is motivating us is it strife and envy and all these things that say that's not the law of Liberty amen we got to realize now that that you say well this character that that that that this Liberty should produce remember it's a victory character is a victory right so this law of Liberty just because we live under this law doesn't mean we don't have an opposition I mean doesn't mean the devil quits and gives up says well I guess I just can't win no he's going to he's going to resist you as much as he can right you got to realize you're Victorious amen nothing can stop you am mean nothing can stop you you can press on am mean so brother Bram says that now the reason for this is so so unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him we have to suffer to Reign the reason for this is that character simply never uh is never made without suffering character is a victory and not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule am mean so this is why now character is a victory it's not a gift that means you got to you have to fight you've got to over come something for that character to come into your life now what is that thing you've got to overcome is actually your first birth am me it's your first birth this own nature that you inherited you say well I don't like this nature I have or none of us like the nature we're born with right it's all very much a lord changes thing right but that doesn't mean we focus on it we focus on the law of Liberty right because if you keep looking at yourself you're not looking at the law of Liberty you got to look into the word of God now brother has asked a question a couple of places how do you overcome a complex cuz we unfortunately we inherit them or we Reed him during life's journey so so he asked the question now how how do you overcome this now he would say this in God being uh misunderstood sorry I don't have it up here but he says now he says my brother or my Christian brother or sister whoever it may be most times when you find people uh it's got stubborn Spirits it's usually a complex that causes this either they have inherited it from mother father uncle aunt grandmother grandfather somebody like that and if you'll trace it back down through your life you'll find it see I've taken this by experience under discernment because I've met cases on the platform thousands of those who have had that Spirit and the first thing you'd know I'd chase that Spirit right back by discernment and find out there was a granddaddy or grandmother that was somebody else bound uh back down there and you inherited that by Nature he said well do I need to realize where this thing came from no you just need to realize it's not yours your it is not your portion it's not part of the law of Liberty that's the main thing cuz many people say well I've got to retrace everything in my life and then finally I can untangle it no you've just going to look into the law of Liberty and realize it's not part of that law and if you're living under that law of Liberty you can say you can walk on and say Lord this is not my portion you did not die that I would live in this thing amen but you died you died that I would live in you and joy and peace and love and everything amen and then so he says now when you feel that you've got a stubborn spirit lay the thing on the Altar and believe God and believe God the thing is dead and you'll never have to have it no more and go on and don't even pay any attention to it no more and the thing is it'll leave you see if you give it attention it'll stay see the devil wants your attention amen that's what he wants he wants your focus this is why people you see spirits that just run rampant on social media and all these things because they want the world's attention right sure there should be free speech whatever whatever but but you know the thing a thing becomes greater if its attention is it's got your attention right Goliath like brother chrisan at Camp he wasn't actually that big but his height and stature got the people's attention and that's what caused him to come under that fear and be intimidated by this thing but if they realize no my Covenant with God the law of Liberty is greater than that giant or that guy he's going there wouldn't have been a 40 40-day pause going on there the stalemate says resist the devil he'll flee from you that's get away quickly so that would be my advice how to overcome it we overcome the Devil by faith and that's what we overcome all evil is by faith then he's asked the same question about a complex and um this is questions ansers 1964 he said take exactly the opposite if you're always wanting your way and that one little brat that wants to always have everything your way turn right back around and give everything you've got the other way this is how you overcome see this is how you re this is how you let the law of Liberty govern your life you say I got a complex I just want everything I'm so selfish and you realize that what do you do remember character is a victory not a gift that's right right so you got to take the opposite instead of wanting it all your own way let others have their way I don't want to do it that way well let them do it that way right amen it's really not complicated it's not even a seven step problem thing it's just no do the opposite amen if you're selfish you want to hold everything then start giving away all you've got see just do the vice versa that's the way to overcome anything it's an antidote beautiful over amen you are self-centered be be be focused on other people amen you you you feel sorry for yourself well be loving to other people amen just do the opposite it's the antidote amen praise the Lord now where we going with now you see there's um and we're running out of time let's let's just let's just be quick here now we're living under a promise right of this law of Liberty now there's always a struggle that we have to overcome in this age because there's a law because the this this age is such a deceiving age that you know of lukewarmness where people think they're fine just coming to church which is it's good to come to church we must come to church we must assemble ourselves together but God never intended us to to to just be part of a group he wants you he wants to know you he wants to walk in you he wants to be your personal God I mean not just a collective God never deals with the Gentiles as always individuals right so now these so he but but he even said in this you know he called it worldly things about I'll just be a good church member I'll be a good man a good woman I do this see he says no it's but he that overcometh he that overcometh all those worldly things of this age so just to be to to to reason it away and say well I'm a good person that's actually not the law of Liberty now the law of Liberty is when you come into Christ amen where he changes you transforms your life amen now we are so I'm just trying to find where to where to pull over now amen now the Apostle Paul if you read the book of Galatians he would tell them that they are not they are not not even children just of the natural Jerusalem and that they are they are as as um he would contrast you know isma and Isaac and he'd say that the Church of Jesus Christ is not the child of the Bond woman right so we're not being born we've not been uh come into this world by uh I mean sorry into Christ to be in bondage again we have a different inheritance okay so he says now tell me if ye that desire to be under the law do you not hear the law it's written that Abraham had two sons one by a bondmaid one by a free woman but he who um who was of the Bond woman was born after the flesh but he of the free woman was by promise which things are an allegory for for these are the two covenants one uh from Mount Si that gendereth to bondage which is AA and for this AA is Mount Si in Arabia and anth to Jerusalem which now is is in bondage with the children but the but Jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us um of us all for it is written Rejoice thou Baron that beareth not break forth and cry thou that travaileth not for the desolate hath many more children that that she that had a husband now we Brethren as Isaac was are children of promise but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that is born after the spirit even so is now nevertheless what sayith the scripture cast out the Bond woman and her son for the son of the Bond woman hath not be ear with the son of the free woman so then Brethren we're not children of the born woman but of the free am amen now that woman that that free woman is the same word that we spoke about Liberty one who is a citizen am mean ones who can one who can go free amen now but you notice here where it says that that Isaac was the child of promise now but but but ishma was after the flesh you'd say well but they were both born naturally yes so they both You' say born after the flesh but God wasn't looking at how they came to the Earth he was looking at the promise they were born under now you to realize you were born under the law of liberty before you ever came to the Earth God when he when he thought of that law of Liberty of you walking free as a son or daughter of God walking in his promises having preeminence over the devil and everything walking in Victory he thought of you amen when he thought of that promise he thought of you amen just like when before Isaac was born amen he said no he's a child of promise that through him Jesus Christ is the the Messiah is going to come to the Earth amen so that word promis now means an announcement it means a promise it means a you know a a promis good or a blessing amen so Isaac was a was was a promised good or blessing he was he was a child of an announcement now friends we have an incredible announcement in this day amen we've got an incredible announcement amen of a you know I'm just going to maybe finish with these few statements you know but we we live under incredible promise of a Rapture in this day amen where where they which are alive and remain shall not uh hinder those which are asleep and you know the dead in Christ there's the people who are alive and remain that will walk from this world to the next World and that is the ultimate end of the the culmination of the law of Liberty and it's not just our soul becomes free from sin now faith comes in and Faith governs our life but this body that so wrestles against us is changed amen our human spirit is changed amen that we step into a glorified body amen that is the greatest that is the culmination of the law of Liberty so as you walk in Christ now you just keep walking and your body will be changed amen cuz you're living under that law Hallelujah so we're living under that promise amen that we are children of the promise of the Rapture Lord praise the Lord amen if you look at you know even if you look at the promises that you know that you know as Paul would say until the fullness of the Gentiles come in when did what were the Gentiles God was thinking of you and I amen I'll s Elijah the prophet for the great and Dreadful day of the Lord he'll turn the hearts of the I just got the the yellow here the hearts of the children to their fathers those He he'll turn people's hearts back to the original Faith who was born under that promise amen God will send who me you Elijah the prophet what do that that word that law of Liberty that's preached will turn us back to the original Faith hallelujah amen I'm just going to I'm just going to um come down to the last bit here you say well what can I do to overcome as I said about complex do vice versa but what are you focusing on what are you focusing on see the devil wants you to look one way God wants you to look the other way right one is the law of Liberty one is the law of bondage and slavery to your past to your problems to your situation to whatever but one is the law of Liberty that God wants to Li cause you to live in that law that no matter what's happening in your life you say no I'm unrestrained by these things this will not dictate to me how I praise God remember because we worship God not based on circumstance we worship Him based on who he is amen he says this now for if any be hear of the word and not do he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself and Goth his way and straight away forget what manner of man he is but whosoever lookth into the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein he shall not be a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed amen amen so this man so so who looks into the perfect law of Liberty that perfect means a complete law it's a complete Liberty it's not a partial Liberty it's not sometimes you're the devil sometimes you're Gods no that complete law is I always was God's and I always will be God's I mean sure there was a time when I walked in this world and I didn't know him but he came and found me revealed himself to me am mean now I'm walking in that law of Liberty amen and the more you walk the more you realize you have amen praise the Lord see at first yeah I was just happy I got saved amen but then I got happy I got saved then I realized praise God I've got overcoming power against this flesh and then as you mature your walk becomes more stable you you know you begin to enjoy more of the word right amen your your walk becomes more stable and then you begin to also realize praise God I'm saved by from sin but I now I've got a home in heaven already this is part of the law of Liberty I've got a body waiting for me in the heavens amen and praise the Lord by his blood God's opened a door for me to step into that body amen what does that do that gives you that what is that that's a law of Liberty having greater impact in your life than ever before so let's just finish with that uh you yeah we'll maybe pick it up another time somewhere but you know what are you living under this this is now the take-home thought are you living under the slavery to this guy what he wants all the time selfishness and greed and strife and whatever you know that your habits of the you see your your family strain ruling you or are you living under the law of Liberty where the Holy Ghost controls this guy sure you have your ups and downs you have troubles all those things but what is ruling you you got to realize I'm a child of the King how did I become this he made me thus he knew this is we have the musicians please you know come forward and you going to realize no I'm a child of the king I'm a citizen of Heaven in spite of my doubts in in spite of my troubles in spite of everything I'm going through that LW of Liberty has come into my life amen so I think let's walk on Amen praise the Lord amen let's um let's stand sorry for the abrupt ending but amen let's stand let's I want to sing sorry brother ISAC I'm just going to steal your song list I thought it so perfect but I want that song I'm so glad Jesus Lifted Me are you glad he lifted you amen you're no longer a slave you're no you're a free man free woman amen you're a you're a citizen of the Kingdom of Heaven because God ordained you to be this amen he say well see to walk at Liberty doesn't mean you don't have trouble I just want to I just want to speak about this real quick many people think once I'm free then I can be a Christian no as you walk with God God gives you over overcoming power right so it's not a tranquil State no we can be we're living in a time of trouble but the trouble's not in here right that we can walk you said I've got so many things going on I don't know how to cope with all these things no but there's a law of Liberty that you can walk with God through your trouble right so it's not a you know we don't have to get to a state where everything's fine then I can praise God no praise God in the storm praise God wherever you are amen God's more than able amen let's just let's just sing this amen I'm so glad well I'm so glad
