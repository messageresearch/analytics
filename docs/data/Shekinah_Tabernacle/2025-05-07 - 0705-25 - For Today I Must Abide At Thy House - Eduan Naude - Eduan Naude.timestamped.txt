[0:00] [Music]
[2:14] God bless you saints. Welcome to the
[2:16] house of the Lord. Let's just stand this
[2:18] evening and open in a word of prayer.
[2:23] [Music]
[2:25] Thank you, Lord, for this wonderful day
[2:27] that you've given us, Lord, and that
[2:28] you've been with us every step of the
[2:29] way, Lord. And Lord, that we could come
[2:31] here tonight once again, Lord Jesus, to
[2:33] your house, Lord, to come and hear from
[2:35] you once again, oh Lord. And Lord, how
[2:37] we've come, Lord Jesus, and we want to
[2:39] come and lift up the prayer request, the
[2:41] requests tonight, Lord Jesus, to you,
[2:43] Lord. And Lord, I just pray, Lord Jesus,
[2:46] that you hear our cry, Lord. Lord, I
[2:49] pray you be with those that couldn't
[2:50] make it this evening. Lord Jesus, be
[2:52] their portion, Lord. Lord, I just want
[2:54] to pray for all the needs amongst us,
[2:57] Lord Jesus, spoken or unspoken, Lord.
[2:59] You know them all, Lord. Lord, you can
[3:01] see the intents of our hearts, Lord
[3:03] Jesus. And Lord, I pray that you just
[3:05] go, Lord Jesus, with that torch, Lord
[3:08] Jesus, of the Holy Ghost, and look
[3:09] through our hearts, Lord Jesus, and and
[3:12] show us, Lord, what's may be between us
[3:14] and you, Lord Jesus. And Lord, may we
[3:17] just grow ever closer to you, Lord. Be
[3:18] with the service, Lord. Be with brother
[3:20] Ed as it brings a message, Lord Jesus.
[3:22] Lord, I just pray you speak through and
[3:24] may be an open vessel to you, Lord. And
[3:26] Lord, as we just worship you this
[3:28] evening, Lord, I pray that you
[3:30] just, Lord Jesus, yeah, we've come to
[3:33] worship you again tonight, Lord. And
[3:35] Lord, I pray you be with us in Jesus
[3:37] name.

[22:28] [Applause]
[22:29] here. Always a big spoil for me standing
[22:33] at the back and there's newcomers coming
[22:35] in. I like that. I love that. Now
[22:37] midweek. Wow. This must be Christmas.
[22:40] Okay, let's read from our from our
[22:43] Bible, from the
[22:45] word. 1 Corinthians
[22:48] 16:13. 1 Corinthians
[22:50] 16
[22:53] 13 and say amen if you're there.
[23:00] Watch ye stand fast in the faith. Quit
[23:03] you like men. Be
[23:06] strong. God bless you. May you have your
[23:09] seats tonight and may God bless the the
[23:12] reading of his
[23:13] word. So, just to maybe get me my nerves
[23:17] a little bit settled, I thought I'll um
[23:20] I'll just give a bit of a a quick
[23:22] testimony or two and then um jump into
[23:25] the thought that I have for tonight.
[23:28] I'll start my stopwatch.
[23:30] Um, I just want
[23:32] to first and foremost
[23:36] really thank you all for for the prayers
[23:39] for the prayers to the NIA family. Um, I
[23:43] would say the last 18 months has been
[23:46] um, awesome. Um, if you if you if you
[23:49] believe in testimonies and trials and
[23:51] challenges and going up um, but um, yes,
[23:56] thank you. it it's really carrying us
[23:58] and I'm I'm just seeing the
[24:01] uh the fruits of it. Um the Lord's just
[24:04] working tremendously from every every
[24:07] side and every angle and direction. And
[24:10] um I just want to quickly um people that
[24:14] might not know and I just want to
[24:15] briefly touch on it a testimony from our
[24:18] from my South African trip and then a
[24:20] testimony just you know in in searching
[24:23] for a job. Now, you've all seen um a lot
[24:25] of a lot of prayer requests going for me
[24:28] for a for a job or where the Lord wants
[24:30] me. Um it's it's a tremendous time
[24:32] because um I'm not actually asking the
[24:36] Lord per se for a job. I'm asking for
[24:39] his perfect will. And that is sometimes
[24:42] quite different to our expectation as as
[24:46] humans, as as men, as husbands, as
[24:49] providers to the family. So um but I'll
[24:53] I'll share this the the testimony South
[24:55] African trip. My my dad passed away.
[24:57] It's almost now a year ago on the on the
[25:00] day. So, I think it was the 18th of May
[25:03] and
[25:04] um everything worked so tremendously um
[25:07] timing wise and again the Lord was in
[25:10] this
[25:11] um
[25:13] that that I was able to fly with the
[25:18] with the limitations and restrictions we
[25:20] had. I didn't have a passport. Passport
[25:22] expired. had to get a emergency travel
[25:24] uh certificate and that could be done
[25:26] within the time frame and I could fly
[25:30] and basically in short flew about
[25:34] probably close to 12,000 kilometers. I
[25:37] was about 1,000 ks away from seeing my
[25:40] my dad. Not a lot of people know this,
[25:43] but um I think it's it must have been on
[25:46] the plane. And I was probably listening
[25:48] to a to a a sermon um and somewhere it
[25:52] dropped just into me that when Jesus
[25:55] went to Gyrus's um daughter and he laid
[25:59] upon her that image stuck with me and I
[26:02] thought and and and and I knew in my my
[26:06] heart if I do this to my dad if I throw
[26:10] my body on top of him he will recover.
[26:13] He will heal. And that was that was what
[26:16] I walked with, right? The Lord had other
[26:19] plans. And I was about 1,000 km away uh
[26:24] into this almost 12,000 km flight. And I
[26:27] got the news that he passed
[26:29] away in this and and all this the trial
[26:33] coming from there coming back all that
[26:36] through this timing. The Lord showed me
[26:38] he's in control. His plans is not our
[26:42] plans. His thoughts is not our thoughts.
[26:44] And that's that's that's what I took. I
[26:46] was surrendered in him. And I was um I
[26:50] wouldn't say happy. I was I was joyful
[26:54] that the Lord is sovereign in my life
[26:57] and in my family's life and all the
[26:59] plans that he's prepared before the
[27:01] foundation of the this earth. The
[27:04] testimony of searching for a job. I'm
[27:06] actually quite gutted. Brother brother
[27:07] Isaac is not here. Hopefully, he's
[27:09] listening and streaming. But um through
[27:15] numbers of this last job and I'll I'll
[27:17] I'll quickly state that um the job I
[27:20] applied for okay so I applied for about
[27:23] 109 jobs from end of Jan to now. So uh
[27:28] that was now before last year. So from
[27:30] end of Jan to to now where we now the
[27:33] 5th 6th of Mar May or somewhere um 109
[27:37] jobs but I got one
[27:39] interview and the screening that I did
[27:42] with the HR lady um by the way her name
[27:46] was um EFA or Eve um and the company I
[27:51] applied for I'll just say the prefix of
[27:53] it is Miracle. So I thought this is
[27:56] interesting that the name got me and
[27:58] that's why I guess one of the reasons I
[27:59] applied um and the first uh the
[28:03] screening went well and the first um
[28:05] interview that we had um was also sort
[28:08] of not expected. It was an in-person
[28:11] interview and today's age is very easy
[28:14] to have a first interview technical
[28:16] things or maybe if it for team to just
[28:19] do it over teams or Skype Skype is
[28:21] probably no no longer anymore. Um and um
[28:25] and this HR lady said, "No, it's in
[28:27] person and there's three people meeting
[28:29] me, brother Isaac. Three." So these
[28:32] three gentlemen meet met me and they all
[28:36] under three years for this company. They
[28:38] were working less than three years for
[28:41] this company. The first guy I met's name
[28:44] was Adam. And I go, "That's
[28:46] interesting." So I've met Adam and I've
[28:48] met Eve. This is a miracle that I'm
[28:51] here. Um very
[28:54] interesting and the the interview went
[28:57] very well. I thought no I haven't heard
[29:00] back um today or this week I I should
[29:03] hear back and when I went back to home
[29:07] and um sort of un unwind and I saw seek
[29:11] that I applied through sent me an email
[29:14] to say that the candidates the the the
[29:16] the the vacancy has closed and it's
[29:19] done. And at the bottom they say how
[29:21] many candidates um applied for this job.
[29:24] And it said 77 candidates applied for
[29:27] this job. And I thought isn't that
[29:30] interesting that seven comes out and
[29:33] three comes out and Adam and Eve is
[29:35] there. And that's all in the middle of a
[29:37] miracle. It's it's incredible. Now the
[29:41] Lord's also prepared me for this that
[29:44] through this numbers God just showed
[29:47] he's in control.
[29:49] If it's a yes, he's in control. If it's
[29:51] a no, he's in control. So, I just wanted
[29:55] to leave that there with
[29:56] you and uh try and settle my nerves. So,
[30:00] tonight we are I want to speak on for
[30:03] today. I must abide in thy house. Now, I
[30:08] wrote here in my notes, children, I
[30:11] promise there's pictures. Just Just hold
[30:13] on. Okay, I'll get to it. There is
[30:16] pictures coming. Okay, we first need to
[30:18] get some of these adult stuff out of the
[30:20] way. So, yeah, bear with me, please. So,
[30:23] if I can refer back to our first
[30:25] scripture, watch ye stand fast in the
[30:27] faith. Quit ye like men. Quit me. Uh,
[30:30] caught me quite. And this is I think I I
[30:33] think this is where the thought sort of
[30:35] um sort of germinated if I can say is
[30:38] the word quit. I had to go and I don't
[30:41] speak English so I had to go and look up
[30:45] what what this in in this context what
[30:49] the word quit mean quit in the scripture
[30:52] here does not refer quit like we know it
[30:54] otherwise the sentence will not read
[30:56] correctly so you know quit we quit quit
[30:59] you like men and be strong that's sort
[31:01] of a paradox right there so I had to go
[31:04] and look and this quit is behavior or
[31:07] conduct or carry Conduct yourselves like
[31:11] men and be strong. I said, "Aha." Then I
[31:14] did some some quick searches and it
[31:17] seems like the Bible only uses this quit
[31:21] in this context within the Bible. Never
[31:24] it uses quit as in how we understand it
[31:27] today in the modern version. So it's
[31:29] always as a conduct or as a behavior.
[31:32] And that made me start thinking about
[31:34] quitting like we understand quitting,
[31:37] giving up, about surrendering.
[31:40] Now this is fascinating cuz as I got the
[31:44] thought as I got the thought
[31:47] um I was as a as a minister when you
[31:51] come here you always want to preach what
[31:54] and and give the people what God wants
[31:57] them to hear and never what I want you
[31:59] to hear. There's there's a few thoughts
[32:02] I want you to hear. It is not the Lord's
[32:05] will that you need to hear them, but uh
[32:08] it's is really good ones. It's actually
[32:10] very good. So, I'll use that for a for a
[32:12] youth service one day or some sort of
[32:14] youth camp where I can get some vigor
[32:16] and um but no and and and last Sunday um
[32:22] brother Ben preached and and and I'm
[32:24] sure maybe some of you might have missed
[32:27] it. I thought it felt like a perfect
[32:29] segue that the Lord planned to say, I
[32:32] want you to I wanted to say this. I want
[32:34] you to go down this this vein and I've
[32:37] quoted him by using a YouTube and
[32:41] transcript, but he was offended. So now,
[32:44] brother Ben here is talking about Peter,
[32:47] right? Uh he was offended and denied the
[32:50] Lord. He swore and cursed and doing all
[32:53] these things before the crucifixion. But
[32:55] he thought my willpower I can be a real
[32:59] Christian. It ain't willpower. It's give
[33:02] up. It's surrender. Oh, there it is
[33:05] again. Okay. Because and this give up,
[33:08] surrender. Oh, that's weakness. No,
[33:09] that's strength. Because when you give
[33:12] up, then you then he can take over.
[33:15] Amen. the
[33:18] unconquerable, allconquering, all
[33:20] powerful Lord God Almighty can step into
[33:22] your human battles and take over. Okay?
[33:26] And that was that was confirmation. I
[33:28] had two thoughts coming together here.
[33:30] That's the first thought. I said, "Well,
[33:32] praise the Lord. We'll we'll hit this
[33:34] vein then." So, I started studying about
[33:36] that and got everything together. So
[33:38] now, not to leave you guys and myself um
[33:43] without uh with with with confusion,
[33:45] let's break down this quickly and build
[33:46] a little foundation. What is give up and
[33:49] what is surrender? Right? And here's
[33:51] give up. Well, can read there. It's not
[33:53] too small. Praise the Lord. Give up to
[33:56] healed
[33:57] uh control or possession. Surrender. I
[34:00] go, "Oh, okay. That starts off to be it
[34:02] looks like it can be interchangeable,
[34:04] you know, give up and surrender cuz
[34:06] there they use it." And then it carries
[34:08] on to desist and abandon. I go okay
[34:12] that's taking a turn to declare
[34:14] incurable and insoluble it goes okay um
[34:18] doctors will get to a point where they
[34:21] will give up you know cancer patients or
[34:24] um leukemia whatever it is they they can
[34:27] give up and this is where they say
[34:29] incurable. Um we've got a wonderful
[34:31] testimony of Sister Lundy that said uh
[34:34] one
[34:35] morning. She went to the doctor um
[34:38] unaccompanied by me. She's she's um
[34:41] we'll sort that out between me and her.
[34:43] I didn't accompany her. I didn't drive
[34:44] her there. She was really in a in a bad
[34:47] state. I was getting the kids ready for
[34:49] church. And this is all law led by the
[34:51] Lord and she the doctor just said,
[34:53] "Well, you're my mystery case for the
[34:55] day, you know." And that was it. The
[34:58] doctors gave up. So here we are to
[35:01] abandon oneself to a particular feeling
[35:03] or influence gave them into
[35:07] despair. We' given you up. So little bit
[35:11] uh dropping down there to number five.
[35:13] We've given you up. So Lord have mercy.
[35:16] If he g given up on us uh where would we
[35:19] be? You know, to seize doing or
[35:22] attempting something, especially as
[35:24] admission of defeat, and then drop right
[35:27] down, giving up the ghost, to cease to
[35:30] live or function. Die. That sounds quite
[35:34] horrible and very, very negative. So,
[35:37] no, the two words is not
[35:39] interchangeable. Cannot be used. Get
[35:42] here we go. Surrender to yield to the
[35:45] power. It starts off again. controlled
[35:48] possession of another compulsion or
[35:50] demand to give up completely or agree to
[35:53] forgo especially in favor of another.
[35:58] Okay, now we getting somewhere. What is
[36:00] it talking about here? And right there
[36:02] at the bottom to give oneself up into
[36:05] the power of another and healed. So here
[36:09] the word healed is quite important for
[36:11] me because that to me feels like that's
[36:14] more a surrender than giving up. I'm
[36:17] yielding to something to something
[36:19] higher a higher power. Right? So we've
[36:23] got the two definitions out so I can
[36:25] take my lab coat off and we
[36:29] can crack into what is this um how does
[36:33] this look like? How does it how does it
[36:36] um how would that speak to you? Uh sort
[36:39] of on a practical sense
[36:42] maybe surrender versus giving
[36:46] up. Giving up is rooted in defeat.
[36:50] Giving up feels like a soul slump. It's
[36:53] the moment you throw your hands in the
[36:55] air not in worship but in weariness.
[36:58] It's when you say, "I guess this isn't
[37:01] for me." And just walk away. Not because
[37:03] you were led, but because you were
[37:05] crushed by
[37:10] discouragement. Giving up is born from
[37:13] fear. Fear that things don't won't
[37:15] change. Fear that you're not enough.
[37:18] Fear that you misheard God or that he's
[37:21] gone silent. I've had that quite a bit
[37:24] this uh last couple of months, last few
[37:27] months actually.
[37:29] Um, giving up. It's passive. It's
[37:34] heavy. It leaves a bitter taste in your
[37:37] mouth. Abandon something sacred. That's
[37:40] the feeling it leaves you
[37:43] with.
[37:44] Surrender. Surrender is rooted in
[37:47] trust. Surrender. Surrender is
[37:51] powerful. It's active. It's brave. It's
[37:56] bold. you will take that leap. You will
[37:58] be um as Joshua said, be be strong and
[38:02] very courageous. Right? That's where
[38:05] we're going to.
[38:09] Um it releases control or you release
[38:13] control. I release control.
[38:19] Um not because I'm losing, but because I
[38:22] know you're winning. The Lord's winning.
[38:25] Surrender is not walking away. It's
[38:27] walking with God. Even when you don't
[38:29] see what's ahead. It's putting your
[38:32] dreams, your relationships, and your
[38:34] battles at his feet. Not in despair, but
[38:39] in faith.
[38:40] Amen.
[38:43] Giving up says, "I can't do this
[38:46] anymore." Surrender says, "God, I was
[38:49] never meant to do this without you."
[38:54] One is hollow.
[38:58] One is
[39:00] holy. You still with me? You love the
[39:03] Lord. Okay. So, let's crack into this.
[39:06] So, why surrender? Lord, why do you want
[39:10] me to surrender? Lord, why do you want
[39:13] to uh let me give up maybe give up my
[39:16] dreams here on earth and surrender my
[39:19] whole vessel, my whole
[39:21] heart, see see me as an as an empty uh
[39:26] wine vat, and come and refill me. Why,
[39:29] Lord?
[39:31] And Jesus said unto them, "If foxes have
[39:34] holes, and birds in the air have nests,
[39:36] but the son of man hath not where to lay
[39:39] his
[39:41] head." This morning's uh daily altar, if
[39:45] you read that, who read that? This
[39:46] morning's one, that was the confirmation
[39:49] to the second piece of my thought
[39:50] because that was the very first thing I
[39:52] wanted to highlight in my in my sermon.
[39:55] So, that got
[39:58] stolen. that just got uh got taken. And
[40:01] that that's the Lord's hand. That's
[40:03] absolutely the Lord's hand. So Jesus at
[40:05] the wedding feast, he comes where he is
[40:08] invited, right? That's why we surrender.
[40:11] And straighten way many were gathered
[40:13] together in so much that there was no
[40:15] room to receive him. No, not so much as
[40:18] about the door. And he preached the word
[40:20] unto them. And they come to him bringing
[40:23] one sick of the
[40:24] pulsy which was born of four. So they
[40:27] were four people carrying him. and they
[40:29] could not come nigh unto them for the
[40:32] press. They uncovered the roof where he
[40:35] was, and they had broken it up. They led
[40:37] him down the bed wherein the sick of the
[40:40] pulse he
[40:43] lay. When Jesus saw their faith, he said
[40:46] unto the sick of the pulse, his son, thy
[40:49] sons be forgiven. What was striking
[40:51] here, they did not say one word. They
[40:54] caused the ruckus. Okay, go preach the
[40:56] gospel. You can just carry on and walk
[40:58] and be in conduct. Be strong, you know,
[41:01] be upright. Don't have to say a word.
[41:04] Jesus will see your faith. Amen. Yes,
[41:07] sir. Praise the Lord.
[41:12] So marvelous time in Oakuckland. So in
[41:15] Oakland, we had this wonderful time of
[41:18] fellowship of camp. Brother Andrew,
[41:21] brother David Silas just came together.
[41:24] So awesome. But for me the importance is
[41:28] also the fellowship among the brethren.
[41:30] So I usually try and have a bit of a
[41:32] one-to-one. So had a chat with this
[41:35] brother and we were just discussing you
[41:37] know like the healing where one of the
[41:39] sermons where brother Brandham healed a
[41:40] particular person and it's awesome and
[41:44] it's just struck me. I go well praise
[41:46] the Lord we don't have to live in
[41:49] 1965. We're living right now. And I gave
[41:52] him the testimony of Omar Robin and just
[41:55] came forward and she got a healing and
[41:56] she was she was she was healed in Jesus
[41:58] Christ's name. I said, "Praise the
[42:01] Lord." We we we don't we don't pray and
[42:04] we don't worship this God of history,
[42:06] but he's the same today, forever and
[42:10] yesterday. Then we It was also um
[42:16] incredible how the Lord orchestrated
[42:18] this from from a from a mistake. So from
[42:21] a mistake end quote um this brother I
[42:26] asked him send me the address of your
[42:28] church and uh he sent me but he sent it
[42:32] he didn't send it to me so I stopped him
[42:35] and I confronted him I said have you
[42:38] sent it and he's on his phone yes I sent
[42:40] it I said I haven't received it he said
[42:42] but I can see it's the two ticks you
[42:44] know WhatsApp has got the two blue ticks
[42:47] I said but I haven't received it he goes
[42:50] Oh, it's the wrong brother. Sorry. Sent
[42:53] it to the wrong
[42:54] brother. Name's sake. Right. So, he sent
[42:58] it to me. Sends sends this to me. Maybe
[43:01] I can read that to you then in reply.
[43:05] So, this is now camp and we setting up
[43:07] camp. Uh, sorry. We we packing up
[43:09] helping them. And
[43:11] um he sent me he sent me this um a
[43:16] couple of days later. That was about two
[43:18] days later.
[43:21] This is the reply. So we sent this by
[43:24] mistake to this other brother for not
[43:27] coming to church for a long time. Don't
[43:28] know how to come back again. Glad to see
[43:31] your message. Even though it was just
[43:33] three words, it carries a lot of
[43:35] meaning. Three words was all I need to
[43:37] show me the way back. A light in the
[43:40] dark. Any other reason, any other person
[43:43] wouldn't see the deep meaning. Only the
[43:45] messenger and the person receiving the
[43:47] message know what it means. I thank the
[43:49] Lord for your life and for someone that
[43:52] the Lord can use. God bless you
[43:54] abundantly. And those three words was
[43:57] the uh church address 30 stood road and
[44:02] that he didn't know how to come back and
[44:04] that's how so by a mistake the Lord can
[44:09] still use the testimony. He is alive
[44:12] today brothers and sisters. I cannot
[44:15] tell you how much alive. Right. So
[44:18] quickly let's jump back to that previous
[44:20] story and just we read now about where
[44:24] where these people with their faith
[44:26] dropped their their beloved down to get
[44:29] healed and they got healed. He got
[44:31] healed by their faith. Now if we talk
[44:35] about the testimonies of now and not of
[44:37] yesterday year in our little body of
[44:40] believers, who do you think can we put
[44:42] in there? Who would be one of those four
[44:44] that will break off a roof and drop
[44:48] someone down, get him close to Oh. Oh,
[44:52] is it? Oh, is it? Okay. Who can tell me
[44:55] who's that? Who's
[44:57] that? Who's
[44:59] that? Who's that? Can you see who's
[45:02] that? Brother Ben Bailey and Brother
[45:05] Armand on the left. They love breaking
[45:08] things. Trust me, I work with them. They
[45:11] love breaking things.
[45:13] So here, not maybe a roof, but they took
[45:15] off the fence to get this uh cherry
[45:18] picker through and get on the roof on
[45:21] the chimney. Put a little top. What do
[45:23] you call that top again? It's just a
[45:26] cap. Cap. See, I can't speak
[45:30] English. And and and that's and that's
[45:33] and I amen on that. That's a brother
[45:35] that will that will break down the
[45:37] walls. that will break the roof to get
[45:39] that last one in cuz we are going up,
[45:42] right? I'll give you another example.
[45:44] And Jesus entered and passed through
[45:47] Jericho. And behold, there was a man
[45:48] called
[45:49] Zakius, which was his chief among the
[45:52] publicans. And he was rich. And he
[45:54] sought to see Jesus who he was, and
[45:56] could not for the press because he was a
[45:59] little of
[46:00] stature. Maybe a clue. And he ran before
[46:03] and climbed up in a sycamore tree to see
[46:06] him. for he was to pass that way. And
[46:08] when Jesus came to the place, he looked
[46:10] up and saw him and said to him, "Zakius,
[46:14] make haste, and come down, for today I
[46:17] must abide at thy house." And he made
[46:20] haste and came down and received him
[46:24] joyfully. And when they saw it, they all
[46:28] of them, they all murmured. They say,
[46:30] "That was going to be a a guest with a
[46:33] man that's a sinner. So, okay, let's
[46:35] place us there. Let's place ourselves
[46:38] there. Are we or were we all not
[46:41] sinners? And Jesus came our way. What
[46:45] mercy. So, Gakus stood and said to the
[46:49] Lord, "Behold, Lord, half are we there?"
[46:52] Yes. Half of my goods I give to the
[46:54] poor. He hasn't done it. He will do it
[46:56] right now. For I've taken and and if
[46:59] I've taken anything from any man by
[47:01] false accusation, I restore him
[47:04] four-fold. And Jesus said unto them,
[47:07] "This day uh is salvation come to this
[47:10] house for so much as you also is a son
[47:14] of uh of Abraham." Now using this
[47:17] example, thinking about our little body
[47:19] of congregation uh body body of
[47:21] believers, who do you think would this
[47:24] fit uh with uh our little
[47:27] Zakius? Our little Zakius. And Jesus
[47:31] said unto them, "This day is salvation.
[47:34] Come to this house." Amen. For as much
[47:36] he is also a son of Abraham. Now I'll
[47:39] pause you there and I'll tell you why I
[47:41] thought of him. Not of what everyone
[47:43] thinks, right? Okay. Not the white
[47:47] elephant in the
[47:49] room. Zakius met Jesus up in the air.
[47:54] And that guy Yes, sir. got changed, got
[47:58] transformed on a plane ride to New
[48:01] Zealand. Amen. And just to think if if
[48:04] if he had a passenger, if he had a a
[48:07] relative with him that you were flying
[48:09] alone, eh, they would not have
[48:12] fathomemed what would have gone on
[48:14] between Chile and New Zealand. It would
[48:16] have been back to the future type
[48:18] things. He was a new creation when he
[48:20] got off here and the Lord got hold of
[48:23] him up there in the air. Praise the
[48:26] Lord. Hey, a few few hours with him and
[48:30] that's it. you are a a changed man and I
[48:33] wish so you had a a photo of you in the
[48:35] plane. I was just man we were trying but
[48:38] anyway I I was really blessed by that
[48:40] when I saw Zakius and I thought a yes
[48:43] this this fits perfectly cuz it is it is
[48:46] our Jimmy and Jimmy received him
[48:49] joyfully
[48:52] joyfully not with happiness. Now, I just
[48:55] want to make a little segue to give a
[48:57] little bit of context about this
[48:59] happiness thing. Now, Jordan Peterson,
[49:02] someone interviewed him one
[49:04] time and um he he asked him, "Are you
[49:08] happy?" And the interview started in
[49:10] this this weird way and and the the the
[49:13] the interviewer said, "So what should I
[49:16] ask you that will that will make it more
[49:20] I guess compelling or more I more
[49:23] empathy or something? Is it are you
[49:25] happy or is it just and as he wanted to
[49:28] say this, Jordan says, "How am I? How
[49:31] are you?" And he goes, "How are you? How
[49:35] are you doing?" And he breaks down. He
[49:38] cracks up. He He There he is. The tears
[49:40] are going. How are you
[49:43] doing? And then his response from there
[49:46] is like, you know, and you know how
[49:48] philos philosophical he gets. But this
[49:51] got me. So bear with me. You know, when
[49:54] you listen to a profound piece of music
[49:57] and see how it ties it in now with good
[49:59] old Jimmy there in the back. Hey,
[50:01] profound piece of music. Some some sort
[50:04] of spans the whole emotional experience.
[50:07] It's not happy. Happy is elevator music
[50:10] and probably you shouldn't listen to it
[50:12] at all. Right? And you think why? Well,
[50:16] it's harmless. It's strictly. It's
[50:17] sweet. It's simple, but it lacks depth.
[50:21] It's shallow. And that's a problem. Now,
[50:24] tying that back to and Jimmy received
[50:26] him joyfully and we received him
[50:29] joyfully when he came our
[50:31] way. He needed a house to meet you.
[50:35] He wants to dwell in your house. Amen.
[50:38] He wants to have fellowship while
[50:40] dwelling in your house. And how much
[50:43] more can we not um be joyful? Happiness
[50:48] is a is an emotion. It's a state here on
[50:50] earth just so limited. But didn't didn't
[50:54] David
[50:55] say restore the joy of my salvation?
[50:59] Doesn't it say count it all joy when you
[51:02] fall into diverse temptation? count a
[51:04] joy and I'm counting a joy. The Lord
[51:06] knows my heart, but he needs that house
[51:10] to dwell in. And that's why that's why
[51:13] we need to
[51:15] surrender. If I um if I can call up the
[51:19] musicians and we can maybe start winding
[51:21] this down. I just want to to leave you
[51:24] with a few thoughts then.
[51:39] Matthew
[51:40] 26. Now the first day of the feast of
[51:42] unleavened bread. And the disciples came
[51:44] to Jesus, saying unto him, where wil
[51:47] thou uh that we prepare for thee to eat
[51:50] this uh Passover? And he said, "Go into
[51:52] the city to such a man, to such a woman,
[51:55] to such a child, to go, the master
[51:58] saith, my time is at hand. I will keep
[52:01] the Passover at your house with my
[52:04] disciples." But a minister come, the
[52:07] preacher come, your friend, maybe from
[52:10] school or whoever come sit next to you
[52:12] in the pew and say, "The master said
[52:15] that your time is nigh. Your time is at
[52:18] hand." And the disciples did as Jesus
[52:20] had appointed him, and they made them
[52:23] ready the
[52:24] Passover. Now when the evening was come,
[52:28] he sat down with the
[52:30] twel. It is thus sayeth the Lord. Now
[52:33] please see yourself in this. See
[52:35] yourself that your your master is
[52:38] looking for that house to dwell in, to
[52:40] have the Passover, to have that meal,
[52:42] that special time uh with
[52:46] you. And while I was looking for um sort
[52:50] of a place to
[52:51] end, I wanted to say or see what the
[52:54] what what the prophet says about
[52:56] surrender and how did he use it? And and
[52:58] I knew that and and a lot of the prayer
[53:01] lines and a lot of the ways that he ends
[53:03] his prayers is is that I'm surrendered
[53:06] to you, Lord. I surrender to you. But
[53:09] this one just pops out and and and I
[53:12] think it's so relevant for us today.
[53:15] I think of our president across there in
[53:18] that meeting now with the nation of
[53:19] Russia knowing that have every the very
[53:22] weapon that will blow this place till
[53:24] there wouldn't be hardly life left on it
[53:27] again and could do it before day's dawn
[53:30] in the morning and then God I think what
[53:33] keeps them from doing
[53:36] it because there's some righteous people
[53:39] yet praying and God have mercy I pray
[53:42] father have mercy grant tonight than
[53:45] this little church sitting here as a
[53:48] lighthouse. A group of people who
[53:50] surrender their hearts, lives,
[53:53] everything they've got, willing,
[53:55] willingly walk out just now and give
[53:58] their life freely for the cause. They
[54:00] believe in you, Lord.
[54:03] Oh father, I pray that you'll endure
[54:05] with them with great power tonight.
[54:06] Great power of faith and may every
[54:09] thought be moved from their mind, from
[54:13] their subconscious that it will be
[54:15] contrary to your divine plan tonight.
[54:18] Take it away, Father, and be with us
[54:21] now. And that's what I really if that's
[54:23] your desire tonight. If that's if if the
[54:27] Lord's speaking to you, if he's
[54:29] saying move now, surrender now, open
[54:33] your heart now. You know, if this is
[54:36] your
[54:37] desire, he wants all of you. He wants to
[54:41] occupy your whole
[54:42] house, will you receive him
[54:46] [Music]
[54:48] joyfully? Is tonight the appointed time
[54:50] that Jesus comes to your house? And is
[54:53] tonight the appointed time where you
[54:55] surrender a bit more or even fully to
[54:59] his perfect will for your life to this
[55:02] word in due season.
[55:04] I'll c close in prayer and
[55:07] then while you raise your hands and
[55:10] while
[55:11] you are surrendered in this atmosphere
[55:15] and the fellowship of the Holy
[55:18] Ghost, Lord Jesus, I I say thank you,
[55:21] Lord, that I could just be a messenger,
[55:24] Lord, and then just deliver the mail.
[55:28] Lord, so many times there's
[55:29] neighborhoods where this messenger has
[55:31] to run through and there's angry dogs,
[55:34] Lord, that they want to attack,
[55:37] Lord, and I have to be quick and I have
[55:41] to stay focused, Lord, that this message
[55:44] get to the get to the address, Lord. Get
[55:47] to the destination to that surrendered
[55:49] vessel, Lord.
[55:51] But I pray that it gets there and I pray
[55:55] that that that gets opened in now in
[55:58] this due season, Lord. Lord, that it
[56:01] maybe to glorify your name to maybe to
[56:05] just get us one step closer, Lord, to
[56:08] that wonderful time when we will have no
[56:11] pain and no suffering, Lord. We don't
[56:14] have to stand here, Lord, and just uh or
[56:17] be on our knees, Lord, in our prayer
[56:20] closets saying, "Boy, where's that last
[56:22] one?" Praying for our children, Lord.
[56:26] Lord, I pray that you just be with us
[56:27] now as we as we just enter in a time of
[56:31] prayer. Lord, may you just have
[56:33] preeminence and and the rest of the
[56:35] service. I pray that
[56:38] you that you take full
[56:40] control, Lord. see every heart, see
[56:43] every need, Lord. You know the desires
[56:45] of our
[56:47] hearts. We love you, Lord. We appreciate
[56:49] you.
[56:50] And you just cannot stop looking after
[56:54] us, Lord. You cannot stop loving us,
[56:58] Lord. You are keeping, you are so
[57:01] persistent,
[57:02] Lord. You're holding our hand. We cannot
[57:05] even let go, my
[57:07] God. And I praise you that we that we
[57:10] did that. We made that step in obedience
[57:14] and in faith that we
[57:16] surrendered. Thank you my
[57:19] Lord. May we sing this now in Jesus
[57:22] Christ's
[57:23] name. I want more as brother Ben

[1:02:04] Grant tonight, he says, "Why? What keeps
[1:02:08] the chaos breaking out upon the
[1:02:11] world?" Because there's some righteous
[1:02:13] people yet praying, "Oh God, have
[1:02:15] mercy." I pray, Father, have mercy.
[1:02:17] Grant tonight in this lovely little
[1:02:18] church sitting here as a lighthouse, a
[1:02:21] group of people who surrender their
[1:02:22] hearts, lives, everything they've got,
[1:02:24] willing to walk out just now and give
[1:02:26] their life freely for the
[1:02:28] cause. A surrendered heart. See,
[1:02:31] surrender is power, as Brother Ed was
[1:02:33] saying. I'm not trying to repeat what I
[1:02:34] saying as well. I just pray this sinks
[1:02:36] in. There's still peace upon the earth.
[1:02:39] Chaos hasn't broken out cuz there's
[1:02:41] surrendered vessels who say, "Lord, I
[1:02:43] want more of you, Lord. I want you to
[1:02:45] live, Lord. Here I am, Lord. Take over.
[1:02:47] Use me for your glory,
[1:02:49] Lord. You're very powerful people."
[1:02:53] Thank you so much, brother. I really
[1:02:54] appreciate that for tonight. Amen. God
[1:02:56] bless you. I'm just going to read some
