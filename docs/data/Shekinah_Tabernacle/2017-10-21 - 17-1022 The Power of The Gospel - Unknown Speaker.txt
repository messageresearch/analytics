========================================

[Music] this morning we're gonna have to sing and talk really loud to compete for um sound waves we did um propose to the landlord about putting a wall all the way through there okay do a thing me ever don't know how far along that's gotten anyway I like children I like I actually enjoy children laughing in and jumping around like we know when you've got a family if you've got children have you noticed when all your family go away and maybe you're just at home by yourself you know and you get home you walk in the door and us eerily quiet you kind of enjoy it for about half an hour and then you're kind of like no this is kind of weird it's all just quiet and not like we don't like quietness but you can go out somewhere and get that but I don't know you get used to just life and laughter and and hey with children and family there's a lot of Meece and a lot of disruption but it isn't an enjoyable thing proverb says we're no oxen are the crib is clean but much increase comes by the strength of the Ox so children are the same you know if you you get a lot of rewards but it's a lot of work in effort than the mean time and a lot of miss you know your cribs not clean you're you're you're doing things but if you don't if you don't have a mess you can't really have progress if you don't have them it's like that in anything you know if you just sit back and do nothing then there's no messes no nothing there's no drama there's nothing but when you go out and try and do something that's win everything that's when the good comes that's when the bad comes but we happy that in the Lord we were always successful in all that we do whether we naturally succeed or fail it doesn't matter the Lord's always got if we one of hers he's got a plan in it and and everything is always for our good and for our being but so we can trust in the Lord with that Anna let's let's stand this morning and we'll sing um are you looking for the fullness of the blessing of the Lord in your heart

Amen praise the Lord who knows the song count your blessings name them one by one all the old-timers will know that one who doesn't know it the man that wrote the song was um Johnson Oatman jr. this man he was born in 1850 1860 died about 1925 or something around there so in that era he was a pastor as well as he did a he worked in insurance and different businesses with his father but this man who wrote about 3,000 songs 3,000 incredible I didn't believe it at first when I read this then I started looking at the songs that he wrote and that the scrolling through the songs and this was one

he will surely bring you up take your burdens to the [Music] [Applause] Amy and praise little what a great song you can take your seats this morning that song was written by a man called Charles Tim Lee no Charleston Lee he was he was actually born around the same era time as the other men that wrote the other song this man was an african-american that wrote that song and his mother was free but his father was a slave and then his mother died when he was quite young so his mother's auntie took him in otherwise he would I guess because his father was a slave it wouldn't quite work out for him to live with his father I guess so yeah and a lot of the things he learned he was self-taught like in his music and everything because I guess you know I'm really to teach him so he taught himself music and all that and he actually became he went into the ministry he ended up having a church a massive Church actually about 10,000 people this man had yeah and he would often bring his songs and throughout the services you know as a service would come he would bring out a new song he wrote quite a few maybe not as many as the other guy the other guy was up in the thousands his name was in the hundreds hundreds of songs that he wrote amazing people in very great songs and the other song which he wrote is the one that we've been people have been what's happening about this week that Shannon's something at the pre-meeting what she's gonna do again today and it's called um nothing between my soul and the Savior she's looking at me all funny can you put that up David so this was another one of the songs that the same man wrote that wrote leave at the nothing between my soul and my Savior nought of this world's delusive dream I ever announced all sinful pleasure Jesus as wine there's nothing between and in the chorus there's nothing between my soul and the Savior so that his blessed face may be seen nothing preventing the least of his favor keep the way clear leave nothing between there's a few other verses we can do but such a great such great verses and such great ways that the Lord works you know he was a man that maybe could have been better and all these different things in his life and yet he when we serve the Lord it overrides our circumstances and we can live a victorious life regardless there's no complaints there's no excuses we can live a victorious life and look at the things he's the life that this man lived in out of hard circumstances and what should have made him better but had made him better so well um we can always think that but I want you to come up because I actually had a song as well but I'm too shy so I'm gonna get here after sing the song let's get here a microphone brothers we got a microphone here oh and they were singing all

Isaiah and we'll go to Isaiah 43 and 21 I mean so just just bear with me with a bit of Spanish as well but do you know where they're away but I'm well that's here so serious and I was over 43 and 21 it says this people have I formed for myself they shall show forth my praise amen and then we have a mensch let's just let's just stop but they're made the Lord blesses word you may have your seats this morning so I want to talk about the power the power of the gospel this gospel has power it's not words it's not just a change in mind there's a power in the word amen a program says this in 1961 he says I'm expecting that the Holy Ghost to come down and see it an order a church that will go to meet him will with the power and the resurrection of Christ I'm expecting me and I believe it God promised it that'll that there'd be a church there without spot or wrinkle on it I'm expecting it because God said sure let's be expecting this be on let's be under expectation oh I expect the church to be on fire the glory of the Lord falling everywhere and centers around the altar people getting saved and filled with the Holy Ghost and just the great thing my anticipations and expect a expectations is built way up high hallelujah now how much more I mean when he had the expectation but how much more now in 2017 rule furnace brittle felt God is pouring out of his holy spirit upon all flesh amen he is gathering his children and there are people around the world that are getting in or any filled with the power of God amen to meet him hallelujah and I trust even when you read that you say that happens to be me I trust when you realize oh hey he's talking about me and 1961 I wasn't even born maybe then but he's talking about me hallelujah but the main thing is is because I'm expecting it because God's it was so I mean and that's exactly what the Bible promises would be here and we happen to be living it out by His grace so this gospel has power now this is 1st Thessalonians 3 maybe if you want to turn or you can read that's fine here remembering without ceasing your works of faith I'm just gonna read it from here so this is this is the this is the Apostle Paul and he says in 1st Thessalonians 1 and 3 it says remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of Hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of God and our Father knowing brethren beloved your election of God for our gospel for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake then we can read 5 verse 6 as well and you became followers of us and of the Lord having received the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost see saying it doesn't just come with words doesn't come with just intellectual understanding doesn't just come with things being put together very nicely but it comes with power Amen and and the Holy Ghost and the Apostle Paul knew what it was like to put words together very well he knew how to make a very eloquent speech before he met the Lord he was raised under Gamaliel he was a very smart man but that was all burnt out upon the road to Damascus I mean so he knew he says to the Corinthians I came with you not an enticing words of man's wisdom I remember with meekness and trembling and in the power of God hallelujah the here was a man who knew what he was talking about amen that it came with power Allu you and we have been restored the same gospel he preached is alive and well today I'm in the same words this is more than just words this should be a reality to us I mean when we see that the word came to the yoke this this gospel then just come to us in word only he didn't just learn this gospel but there's a power behind it I mean God came and backed up his word and with much assurance Oh blessed assurance Jesus is mine I mean because remember this is not a bunch of doctrines this is a person the word is a person a man doesn't mean to be a love relationship between you and God that's not learning different doctrine unless unless unless he's a person and in if you know the person all the duction will come into place I mean would have thought about learning doctrine I know this unless unless unless do you know him because if you don't know that he won't be there but if you know him you'll be there I mean she must know him this is why it comes with power I mean because when the Lord says I have formed this people for myself this is what God is declaring this people I trust you could say I'm one of them I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them amen i form him for myself so amen and they shall show forth my praise that's why we get so happy when we think about Redemption nothing between my soul and my Savior I'm in this power and the blood there's power in the blood of lamb blessed assurance Jesus is mine don't doesn't just throw your soul when you sing those words I mean because way you shall show forth is praise Amen there's the people built upon your upon the earth that willingly out of a willing heart say I'll serve you Lord I'll praise you God I'll stir into my will to your will they may not become a love prisoner to Jesus Christ I trust you can say that's me I mean cuz God is looking for prisoners and only prisoners will be there amen I want to be a prisoner now this word formed in the English it says through the squeezing into to mold into a form especially a Potter so there's a forming there's a molding that must take place I mean there's going to be you're going to feel that unseen hands of Jehovah take your clay put it on his wheel feel the water a man banzi molds you and shakes you takes the stones and all the things he doesn't want because he wants you to be a perfect vessel then when you get put into the fire you don't blow up I mean because you're gonna be four I remember yeah I classes school since you've got to build it just right otherwise when it goes into the kiln it blows up we don't want to blow up when we go into the kiln because you got to Gombe bread with Holy Ghost and fire I mean you've got to gone to the kill you can't just be a wet piece of off clay on the Shelf you have gone to the farmers present I mean and then you can be used for a service I mean so we don't want to blow up I may take everything out of Hilo that needs to be taken he knows what he's doing so it's got to be a forming going on that's why he called you that's why you know that's why he gets ahold of your life yeah that's why it's you know being a real Christian it's not just accepting something means to lean just walking on it's got to be a death yeah brother Graham preaches on the baptism the Holy Ghost it's been specially their entire service saying you're gonna die and rot and be born again have you listened to their service he's like the whole thing just ladies you're gonna die the seats gonna die you're gonna literally die and the outsides gonna write the she can come forth I mean that's what is the wrestling you got to wrestle with God you can't just say some Creed you know you gotta know now we're gonna go into the forming I know this may be familiar to a lot of you but first John five and six is this here let's just see if you don't mind a bit of Bible reading first John five and six this is he that came by water and blood even Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the Spirit is truth and there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word in the holy ghost these three are one and there are three that bear witness in earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one no these three are one God is not three persons in a committee three three persons one and purpose whatever they try and fandangled terminate you know your terminology it's one God you believe in one God you do well the devil also believes in trembles she even do well just to believe this one many people do not do well because they believe in three but they are one but in the water the spirit and the water and the blood of theirs the witness on earth these three green this is the three just like a natural baby there's three stages to a birth there's the water breaks in there's blood and then the child the life comes with a child and they cry out their spirit and this constitutes a real new birth that's got its own these three agree in one now this is the molding process you say well how long does it take to go from a sinner to be filled how how quickly do you really want to die it's the goodness of God that leadeth to repentance and because people can be justified by faith and not sanctified and people can be sanctified and not justified but you must be justified sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost and that's the whole new verse for some people they're sanctified they say well I've never done anything wrong in my life you know I've never done what because they've been cleansed but they've never really recognized they need salvation they've never cried out God I'm lost let's truly some people love it some people just being justified but they're still living an ungodly life they need to be cleansed and set apart for service in filth amen where where are you today because we're all on the subway now notice now this is from future home and notice how God makes plain to us his plan of redemption oh this just through my soul one assert how he makes plain to us here how his plan of redemption now compare what we see with her own eyes what God has done to redeem his world he's done the same to her Dimas people for the unchangeable God changes not in any of his plans or anything such a glorious thing how he leads us to himself who's been led to him amen to a tab in it to be a to a tabernacle in us by three stages of grace just like he led the world in three stages to come to the world as God will come to the world after it's gone through three different stages of purification that's exactly he comes to us through three stages of grace and remember the definition of grace in the New Testament as a divine influence upon the heart and the reflection in the life that's what the word in the Greek means doesn't mean God just just just winks at your Center whatever that's a divine influence upon the heart and it's reflection in the life that's so if someone says I've received the grace of God and will be reflected in the alarm I mean they will be thankful they'll be so glad God you changed my heart you turn me I mean that I can walk with you and it'll be reflected in how they live and how they treat each other and how they treat God that's how you know Grace's come upon you I trust Grace's come upon you if not you just thank God Here I am Here I am mould me and changed me we can't just say Austin you know by grace are you saved yeah God got ahold of you it says grace is as goodness it leads you to repentance and you recognize your lost and undone you call out to him that's God leading and then and then he leads you through a real death amen the akan 4th and Eunice of life amen now in secondly comes this right may have jumped around he says now this secretly comes sanctification which sits out in the mind in order for holiness to think right take away signification as a compound Greek word which means cleanse and set aside for service there next comes the baptism and fire of the holy and Holy Ghost that God might dwell in us and the fire and all cleanses our hearts from sin and puts the Holy Ghost inside then we bring forth the same life that this did because that's enough by your fruits you shall know them it's more than just saying nice things and maybe dressing right amen but a real sanctification remember people people think that you know a real sanctification is not exactly your your ability or you doing it God has to change your heart member we were just like the earth you know Adam and Eve were kicked off the throne Satan took over but then God said I'm going to redeem it I'm going to restore it back and so now the finality of that is God's throne sits upon the earth there's no Devils anywhere there be near be burnt up but his throne sets up upon the earth that's the same thing with you and I when we are born there's the enemy on the throne of our heart and enemies here there's got to be a revolution I mean this coming it's going to be a coup I mean it's got to be a reinstatement of a real king tells me to be there in the first place I mean so that's why it all stems down to who was on the seat of your heart because the scribes and Pharisees they were religious they did all the right kinds of things they quoted the right scripture they are very fundamental but when the very King came to the earth God became flesh he came there King what did they say they didn't say oh host add it to the highest we've been waiting for you to come we knew you'd come this is how you had come glory to God no they said will not have this man rule over us they had another King and in their religion they kept that king but they're ones like the woman at the well I'm gonna bring forth my praise and here she is sleeping around in her darkness then comes the king she says we know where Messiah cometh he'll do these things earlier there was a there's a coup there's a revolution I meant she didn't have that woman problem anymore cuz a new king came on the throne I'm enjoy as a flag flying high from the castle of my heart because the king is in residence here she is not joy kids what the enemy does against you enjoy what other people do joy worries three much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God through hardship and trial I want to be able to stand next to the Apostle Paul I want to say I made my stand in my age what about he made us stand he said he fought with the beasts of Ephesus he was shipwrecked he was beaten here's Rob he was driven out of cities I would have bail the status so I made my stand in my age what about you he had hardship he's here but yet none of these things move me there's a lot of things trying to move him he says I'm gonna stand on this rock and then I know the rock bass you nod off it's Christ hallelujah how about you but depends who's on the throne don't get you know sometimes we do get a bit of shell-shocked but there's a bomb in Gilead I'm in favor of observed lying vanities forsake their own mercies that's what it says in the Book of Jonah anything that happens to you there's not eternal as a line vanity I mean why do we care about how well yo how other people treat us what they say what the will says that is lying vanity because one day I won't even be a memory to just kick it to one side kick it to touch just forget about it because if you observe those things what does it mean to observe you study it I'm observing my hankerchief look his eternal life but I'm observing this this is really a lying vanity doesn't matter that may have tried to kill me multiple times they tried to smother me in my sleep but it's still a lying vanity compared to this and if you observe lying vanities you're forsaking your own mercy I don't want to forsake my own mercy it's my mercy I want it if it's for me I want to have about you I mean it will bring forth the same life that listed a man there is when when God comes and dwells like if I moved into your house and what we mean to be prisoners to him so just say I'm movin to your house you say do what you want in this house eventually you'll see there's a chair moved and maybe a wall will be painted and I'll rearrange things because you say have control and I've moved in you'll know someone's in the house I mean maybe there you know the law and stuff may be changed outside people will drive past what's happened to that place lady they don't like that kind of thing why is it different let's say well because someone else is in this house and it's the same thing with you and God moves into your house I mean he rearranges what he wants to rearrange and people will know people will know yes I was working when I was it unique was that you need far too long but when I was there I was working in a kitchen part-time I meet the Lord in this time in Christine and I get married she works in this kitchen when we first moved to Christchurch for a couple of weeks I don't tell they so the look gets a hold of me I don't tell the shifts and stuff with her there they're still working me when Kristi's here for a couple of weeks and they say to her we were so happy when being meters God Hey because before handy is empty alone and upset they saw a change I don't have to say no I'm a Christian they saw it as a Christian shouldn't that be how does that should be how does a man what happened to you I'll tell you what happy way hallelujah Jesus alive notice the natural birth when a woman gives birth to a baby the natural life types of spiritual life when a woman gives birth to a baby the natural the first thing happens braking of water then blood then the then the spirit the life grabs a little fellow spank him with away he goes screaming water blood spirit and when a baby is born to the kingdom of God he comes the same way water blood and spirit I mean brother Brahim says I think it's it's one of the last services he's he preaches at SRI port I think it's the invisible Union he says people don't want crying acts 2:38 youngins around miserable creatures the church thinks she is Brett but he says that's the only kind the word can bring forth and then if it brought it forth on the day of Pentecost it will bring forth when people are really burst into the kingdom I mean they'll be acts 2:38 Amen screaming speaking tongues crying shouting babies hallelujah because that's the one that the word brings forth amen I don't care what Pentecost is made of those things they're still a genuine I was talking to God last night I see God that the skies are full of the genuine indi the skies on us full one we want some substitute of some conformity to a good behavior or some saying the right thing you can take that I don't want that why can't we have the junior he says the Pentecostal skies are full of the genuine and Pentecost is an experience it's a real experience we must have that experience and I believe this cuz it happened to me now notice sanctification oh I see it's the second stage of it cleanses the mind six the heart the mind the heart and order of holiness so a man can repent of sins and still thinking of maybe he's an immoral man every immoral looking woman he finds he's still there maybe he's a drunkard every time he smells a drink it's still there see but when he gets sanctified that cleanses that desire out of him see it takes the want of it away he can still be tempted but it takes the want of it away still he's not right yet amen you must be justified you must be sanctified but you're not there you're on your way you're on your way then he is baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire cleanse burn out cleaned up and then put in the service of God sanctification only sets him aside for service just like when the what your the parable of the wise and foolish virgin they were sanctified all ten of them were sanctified that come up to sanctification they were clean living according to the word this is a message realms by the way they were living according to the word but only half them had the Holy Ghost only half them were not just set aside for service they were in service because the God himself the oil represents the Holy Ghost himself I mean so because it's so it's not it's good to be cleansed and he does the cleansing but you've got to say God take the desire out of my life and stay there till he changes you amen of course you're gonna be tempted but when he takes the desire as I've said I could live in a brewery but I'd be sober every day of my life not a single drop of that beer would be drunk and it was a part time I used to brew the stuff but he took the desire out of me I'm not afraid of alcohol I'm not afraid of I'm not afraid of Hollywood I'm not afraid of rock-and-roll music I'm not afraid of movies or whatever because of desire where's the gone I don't know not gonna find it that was buried someplace I don't care I don't even worry where the grave is it's gone that's all that I'm worried about where did it go I don't know end of story let's move on all I know is gone hey man so now but that's why now we must go from just being sanctified to God comes and dwells on us because when God comes and dwells on us he gives us a life of power overcoming power amen are more than just more than just taking the desire out but you see you we have to go back to the pattern look at the book of Acts everything that came against them God raised the standard and they overcame does that right you know the enemy said don't preach in his name anymore they beat them they were rejoicing earlier than they had a prayer meeting and God came down and took all the complex and that pressure out of their lives and they went forth with boldness to combat what the enemy was doing and that's the same thing we really need to do amen is actually when the enemy tries to give a complex against you don't just try and compartmentalize it and put a tag on it but have a prayer meeting until God comes down because that same God that was there is still here and then had come down and break the complex I mean that's the only way can be overcome otherwise you're carrying around something you know me to carry I'm not meant to carry some kind of burden like that why do I want to carry the devil's mail he can have his own couriers I'm like I'm not working for me I mean I got fired now I quit Kahlua and I didn't care about redundancy by the way amen now taking Peter three and four they see is here this so brother BAM takes listen a bit more with the when he's preaching about future home he's saying well let's go from verse three no I must first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking in their own lusts and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the father's fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation people still say that today where is the promise of us coming and we could be gone tomorrow all right now I'll take us out off the world Jesus for this there willingly are ignorant of that by the Word of God the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished amen let's just keep reading but the heavens the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and the perdition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years is one day the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness our God is not slack in this thing our God is busy I've got is very busy all around the world he is working he is finding his children he is four million to bring for this praise God is busy in the same time I mean cuz he he said I'll do a quick short work upon the earth and we happen to be living in that Kwik shop work fine I mean God is moving in a powerful way all around the world hello yeah like I heard testimony from I think brother Bram I don't know how many people he raised in this ministry I think maybe five or six or may be wrong and then there's believers I think it was in Ghana they had a convention and I said how many of you have been raised from the dead in this country forty-one people stood up well it bonafide raised from the dead so I was in one man now the same spirits everywhere doing the same thing and doing greater because it's in a multi mean but bodies it is one just like Jesus he didn't you know just in one man they went to 120 the same life the same way of spread around hallelujah and it did more more one started in the body of the Southwest but it's more when he caught diffused out and she just being in one ministry I mean so now I'm glad he's alive aren't you we're by the world now so so the world so as just as it's three stages to our birth we were appeared to be baptized name the Lord Jesus Christ remission of sin that was like in the days of Noah the world was baptized but sin came through over the ark right to the world so I was all washed off but sin still came through and people can repent Umi baptize and be justified but there's still a sin nature in them and then now when Jesus died upon the earth his blood sanctified us and sanctified the earth laying claim upon us he says by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all and every priest stands daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins Amen it's only by his blood son can be taken away I mean but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God so we are sanctified by his sacrifice his blood sanctifies us hallelujah and winning in where he poured his blood out upon me oh it was laying claim to it this belongs to me and everyone that will come out of the earth they belong to me hallelujah so here's laying claim because you member this thing is part of the earth this was once this was once soil or plants or animals this thing is part of the earth so when his blood fell upon the earth he is like claim to you how many said there is a people that will come forth maybe two thousand years later he knew when I was going to be they belong to me Satan take your hands o from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified Alleluia hello sanctified ones the word Saint means sanctified one I mean but then of course when he gave us life there's still sin here but then of course there'll be the new heavens and new earth and all the devils and everything will be burned off this place will be vaporized I mean all the Devils so everything in this realm and the unseen is going to be burnt off and a new heavens and new earth it's gonna be set upon I mean it's not so that new that the word new heavens doesn't mean it's going to be a brand new one it's actually the same one being renovated but says it shall pass away maybe we haven't even got to that year let's read verse 10 in second Peter 3 but the day the Lord shall come as a thief in the night and which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be an all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of of God wherein the heavens shall be on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to us promise look for new heavens and new earth we're in dwelleth righteousness hallelujah so cease winner shall pass away that word is actually the same word where Jesus tells - you know when Lazarus is raised from the dead he says lucemon let him go that word loose is the same word as passway changing I mean take off his grave clothes the man is still the same only so but take out the outside and it's same with the earth the earth will still be here but this stuff and although this is going to become vapor it's gonna be this place is going to be burnt up and I say glory to God could it happen now I want to be taken away amen I want to walk on streets of gold don't you don't you want to see that permit City and we'll live in that place and time is no more an eternity Rosana hallelujah we'd have no sickness or pain or sorry or bad so bad day you can't wake up on the wrong side of the bed I don't think we sleep but you can't wake up on the wrong side those only the good side of the beam that sides done away with don't you want that don't you want to go to heaven amen so now what's the same with us he does the same thing now and from Jesus Christ I just like this and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness the first forgotten of the Dead and the Prince of the kings of the earth and to him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and if made us kings and priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever amen amen so he is look he loved us under him that loved us and washed us I mean from our sins in his own blood Bholu yes weird a dirty government we were a dirty government and then he washed us hallelujah and there's no stain there's no residue hallelujah because of yo your brother BAM talks about the blood being like a bucket of bleach and you drop an ink you're a drop of ink into that bucket he says it breaks down and I don't know how worked for he says he sees the ink becomes bleach Peleliu you can't find it anymore it's the same thing when sinners truly confessed into the blood of Jesus Christ amen you can't find it why would you want to dig it up glad you got our memories or such a we waste many times we think about the wrong thing we think about the bad side I mean you think about the good side the devil says remember when you did listen you thought this and you did this and you did this and did this you should just go back to the hold on that's not the whole story as brother Quadra preached here last year to be continues turn the page there we'll turn the page oh look I confessed it and it was made right and it's gone we've been washed I mean because God lays claim and what he lays claim doing they're coming in with these no more disputes nothing can stop him claiming his own oh wait we had it there I mean see what then what manner of persons ought way to be an all holy conversation and godliness now to me one you can take this as as living in fear or you can take it as joy and speak more full of glory because God is not slack concerning his promise I mean God has not slack it's going to happen hallelujah so if you think about it then this is all going to pass wear and burn up because remember faith brings the promise it takes it from far away and faith brings have promised you where you are now I mean faith speaks on this way the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth in thy heart that's why it says in Romans so the faith faith brings our promise close so now when we read this kind of promise that the world's going to be burnt up new heavens and new earth things are going to pass away you know I say Lord I want nothing between my soul and my Savior I would have more belong to you can I belong to you more Lord only totally hundred million for senior but if you had to proceed hallelujah because he's doing this because he's going to burn it off because we're gonna live here amen nevertheless amen we've already read this so he says now and it's like now when the Holy Ghost and fire comes you say well how can that be when you receive the Holy Ghost now brother Brown talks about there's a is the Battle of Armageddon which is a nuclear war yeah right dinner is the millennium then there's the new heavens and new earth and yeah I mean then there's where this happens right so now it's like us now when the Holy Ghost comes into us amen the enemy is pushed away that it's like a millennium where the enemy is bound he should be banned from your life of God as unusually sure he wars against you but there should be an overcoming power and then there should be a power on you but this body hasn't changed this body has to change Rice's like the earth has to change but it's after the Millennium with is the burning of everything it's not a nuclear war does anybody understand what I'm saying I mean they should be when the Holy Ghost comes into us we have power to overcome amen we have power to overcome we are not blind we're not ignorant of the devil's devices I'm in but there comes a genuine power in you and I wear whatever he comes against us worth we shall overcome amen it says it says in Psalms 91 we will trample on the dragon and upon the young lion early we will trample upon the head of the enemy it says that yeah now let's go to Ezekiel 36 a little bit I trust this is straightforward you need power if you don't you know if there's a constant war you need power it's not meant to be a stalemate shouldn't be a stalemate should be a victory after victory I mean we're not here just a just to fight trench warfare build up our build up our defenses and build our bunkers and dig them deeper and go underground and build concrete and try we'll just outlast this we're just going to out survive this campaign now we're not meeting to sit there and a siege mentality I mean but you know we're cool to do like a blitzkrieg let's take the enemy's ground I mean doesn't matter what it is sometimes you're the biggest enemy you have and you've got to die but but don't just sit there and say well this is how does this has been this way for years this traversing this becomes a time where things come to an end and you're gonna be willing to say well Lord I don't want to continue this way why should we live below our privilege why should we let the devil's lying vanities dictate to us how we live in how we treat others why should we that's living below your privilege why would you be if you are if you're a prince in the palace why would you say no I think I'm gonna live in a cowboy box on the street because that's what people actually deciding and and their Christian walk by living under privilege I say now I don't want that I'll take this I'll pull me this is horrible I've been helping this for years and they and they worship their own situation instead of worshipping the God that can deliver them from you for I will take you we're in Ezekiel 36 for I'll take you from among the heathen now I trust you can say he's talking about me because when I read this I'm not I'm not saying that as a joke you should be able to see yourself a little scripture this is personal for I'll take you from among the heathen and get you out of all countries and bring you into your own land bring you to your own inheritance I have men bring you to your own land and we've been brought then I'll sprinkle clean water upon you he'll wash you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you has he has he preached out the temple taking all the idols out of the temple out of here as it cleanses them as you cured it down i trusting hairs because if there's an idol you know no idol can be a little thing just sit there yeah get rid of the thing you know it was like I think I may be wrong but what are the South American Empire of the Incas or the S nothing as the Incas big massive temple complex they go up and these just this little wooden statue of a God in this big temple and they worship somehow this sometimes it's like us with this little bitterness this little resentment against someone and that thing is just like basically in front of you all the time and you're walking around and and you see everyone through this little Idol yeah may not even be there for it can be such a small thing and because you know people pack their idols with them oh this man did this to me and he carries around and you don't know what they did to me here's Jesus on the cross Father forgive them they don't know what they do and they had meetings and they strategized it and they planned it and then Judas gave him the ability and they said now that you now let's execute our plan and they could have they could have they could have said when he's on the cross they could have said well done boys that worked and he's there saying forgive them they don't know what they know now humanly you say they planned this they knew what they were doing but they didn't know people come against you believers unbelievers make believers what it doesn't matter who they are don't categorize people who cares what are you gonna do with it Oh give me more bitterness No take this cup what way we don't have to drink oh you know just just let this root of Brutus you know you're a garden you know you're a guy - no she's in Song of Solomon coming to your garden we're a garden know some people you know you look at their gardens and there's beautiful fruits and veggies at all yeah well what an amazing garden and then and then and then there's other ones where it's just I don't know what tree makes goodness pistol goodness same ground what a way you don't want to eat this I hear we're gonna harvest it's gonna be great that's gonna be better but it's my garden this is me well why would you why would you let it grow where's the joy the Lord God where is the peace that passes all understanding because it's just like because many times we leave Jesus somewhere we're walking on our journey and we leave them somewhere and then you say well what's happened to me where's my first love gone where's my joy gone where where's the place where you don't care about here and all you care about is him you know that place your kiss who cares about what other people do and saying Lord all I care about is you and then you got to go back and find him because where you left him that's where you find them and many times people will come along and they'll do things against you it makes you drop them and you keep walking but now you're holding this bitterness in front of you for I will cleanse you this is the Lord's doing you've just got to be willing to stay on his wheel stay still until he changes you and you had also will I give you in a new spirit while I put within you and I'll take away the holy the stony heart out of your flesh now some people they're so hard no I won't change I know you know they've got a heart of stone why get rid of it you're gonna be willing member God doesn't force anything against your own world he you have to say yes Lord if you don't say yes Lord you'll stay as you are because he's a gentleman and maybe you know at no days thinking in his mind I have the bomb I can so I can do a perfect I can fix you perfectly just let me know Lord and it's normally pride or a fence and people will hold back I said lord I think it was our they are quote I think it's Keith green well he said I want a heart with skin that's like baby skin I want a soft heart I don't want a heart and heart I thought Lord I agree I want a baby skin I want to have a soft heart because I may have a soft heart he can change your mold you and change your affections and mold you know he can govern you and work with you but notice so he says I'll do this but me people stop there with a new spirit a new heart girls done a great work he has and I'll put my spirit within you that is where where we must be then I'll put my spirit within you to cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them why does some people try to keep the wood and there are nobility but the real believer God puts his spirit in them there's a power and maybe when the Holy Ghost comes into a people is a power to keep us wordless statutes and walk in them and do them hallelujah and that's what we must have is that it's not you being the Christian God becomes a Christian in you it's no longer I that liveth but Christ liveth in me Rickon yourself dead or alive in Christ that's what you've got to do and if you are dead and alive in Christ then his word he will live out of you if it's if it's prophecy or healing or miracles or whatever it may be a character of nature will be will be manifested hallelujah see I'm so glad at some doing it and ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your father's this is our land our inheritance in Christ well they're just words on a in a book and you shall be my people and I will be your God who wants that that's what I want to be I want to be his people and I want him to be my god this gives you power you see the believers all the way from Genesis to Revelation they overcame him they overcame the enemy whatever the enemy did against them they didn't let it overcome them I mean they had overcoming to him that overcometh will I grant and then in this age we know all the promises all the curses from every age you know snowballs to this age we says to him that overcometh in this age well I grant to sit in my throne as I sat down with my father in his throne so sit down you'll sit down with me and my Dominion hallelujah and thus now I say don't just look to the Millenium for that Dominion there's a Dominion today amen let's go to revelations chapter 12 it's just let's just read a bit there is power wonder-working power in the blood of the Lamb there is absolute power amen there's nothing the blood of Jesus Christ is never insufficient it can't there's never a circumstance that could not fix Amen he says it remember there was war let's just read revelations 12 and 12 and 7 and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him so there was a war in heaven jesus said I saw the devil fall like him like lightning from heaven so there was war in heaven and the devil was cast out now that war has come upon the earth right and then I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the power of our God I mean that's how the Kingdom of our God the power of us Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night now now the battles come now he lost in heaven now the battles down here we're going to see how's it going to pan out for you Satan and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death therefore rejoice are ye heavens and ye that dwell on them work to the inhabitants of the earth and to the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time so the same life that was in heaven cast out the devil and then and then now the devil's cast out and God chases them down to the earth I mean it comes and dwells and his people and they fight the battle again and the Devils catch it again and because the same God that cast them out up here it's causing him out down here hallelujah that the enemy has no dominion of the people of God that's the same God the devil would know what I say I've seen this one before how the look I've seen this one before I can't escape this one hallelujah is now rockin flee hallelujah the same God let's what it does and so you say well how's that so well the devil was cast out of your life I mean once you're a slave you're no longer a slave I mean once you were dictated to by what he told you to do but now he's under your feet who you are crushed that's your case I mention the devil was cast out there when he gets cast out here amen and now there's are people that have been formed amen to bring forth his praise hallelujah amen and here we are I trust I trust you say well as that power that is absolute power that's absolute power friends there's power in this word don't let anyone try and tell you otherwise don't let anyone tell you the day of miracles has passed there's more miracles today than they were when ever amen there is not the same God he is the same yesterday today and forever amen and only the devil try and tell you otherwise I mean what he said well used to 20 30 years ago you still used to do great things what about today I mean what about today because they see it's like with David you know hey he killed the lion he killed the bear it killed Goliath and then he came to a CERN and he took the whole kingdom the same God that was with him back there was with him at the end I mean he didn't use a sling all the way three just use this twice or three times rather but then after that he used to saw I mean God God was equipping him to tell him I'm not a cookie cat I'm gonna lead you through every battle I'll lead you through every trial because we have to unfortunately we will be tried by every spirit in the world every spirit we'll try you either if it's pride mining woman popularity you know whatever it is religious spirits I'm in lust spurts whatever it is it will come and try you it will come and attack you I mean but God has his salvation will never come up insufficient funds I mean but you will be tried bitterness hardship disagreements whatever it may be it will come and try you amen but do you have I trust you have the wherewithal I have what I need to overcome every trial I am every Valley every Hill every whatever it is I can overcome it because I can do all things through Christ Jesus which strengthens me how we're gonna get through this one well how'd you get through the last one when he lead me through well he'll leave me turned out how am I gonna get through that's what all this was a closed great let's just keep walking just keep walking doesn't matter remember it's you and him as it you know it's not you him and the guy attacking you are you him in the sister attacking you are you him in the disagreement with someone else that's not you walking together I didn't sign up in the Lord because it's an unconditional covenant when he came to me and said take my yoke upon me I've been upon you I'm in and I'll give you a rest it wasn't take my yoke upon you and then sort it out with all these other people that will come along and will attack you and come against you no it's just me and him there's nothing between my soul and my Savior the devil will try and put something between you and home amen put bitterness or hardship or unforgiveness whatever will be he'll try and reach something in there because if the devil can keep you from the life maybe there's one baptism but many fillings I just won sealing but many fillings and you see you see in the book of Acts he came down God came down the day of Pentecost but there many times that says they are filled with the Holy Ghost again hallelujah God drove out all the works the enemy out of their lives Gouri you say well that was back then he's the same God today we should expect the same things I mean if we've been restored to the original faith and that's how the original faith produced then oh god we thank you here it is amen but if the devil can keep you from that life and take you down some side road you just you're all you're doing it was observing lying benefits your faith your forsaking your own mercy I want to walk with him not worried about anyone else who's your god is it your memory of something that happened to you years ago because sometimes people walk and it's a memory they're haunted by a memory and how someone treated them and what someone said and they're walking according to that maybe they're young maybe they're old you know goddess God can forgive he can forget he said well why can't we forget you ever go and bring healing to that place I mean he can bring healing to that place where you're not a captive to a memory or a situation but when you come to them and you be healed of Versalles because the problem is sometimes we form our dented ease around bad things happen to us and we've become whatever anonymous you know misunderstanding Church split anonymous whatever it is you know better nurse anonymous and we should form a form a support group with our own selves leave the group just leave the group if you want to walk there but there's a gospel of power the gospel came to you in power so if it came to empower you receive that power I mean you should be walking in the power of the Holy Ghost and that power is given to you you say well you know the powers given to you you can overcome look at Peter persecution comes in when he's there and he's and he's there outside jesus' trial he buckles under the questioning of three people and he swears and does all these kind of things pressure comes on and he runs and before that it's his old with you Lord all have the sword oh yeah I'll be the defender of the face that he cuts the man's ear off and all these things but then when when the question are you uh are you one of them are your disciple do you believe do you believe this one oh no I don't I don't know I don't know anything about him pressure came on and then because he didn't have overcoming power he never ever going about anything God comes down the upper room fills him up and then he's brought before the Sanhedrin before that I was just a couple of woman and a man outside the Sanhedrin questioning him now isn't from the same court that condemned Jesus he says who should we obey God or man and they beat them and they sitting them out and they're rejoicing now counted worthy to be beaten for the name of the Lord hallelujah cause he an overcoming power the disciples head over koper and he's the same yesterday today and forever to come Lord I need some overcoming power there's a balm in Gilead friends there's a Jesus Christ here he's a God of power I wanna sing that song be nothing between my soul and my Savior if he doesn't mean everything to you right now you say Lord take out whatever that is between cuz at the end of the day who cares what other people do don't worry about them he should be everything to you he should be your first love well we're not cool to leave our first love in this hour amen let's not plateaus it's love or more honestly I thought Lord I want
