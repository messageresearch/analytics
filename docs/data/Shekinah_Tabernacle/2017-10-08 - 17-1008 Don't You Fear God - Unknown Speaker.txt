just going to the snow it was the first is what we wanted to do but then there was a lot of thought a lot of planning involved and behind the scenes I want to thank these people that helped us as well it's very important to see that that it wasn't just a camp it was it was two days with the Lord came down and he and he could work and even just in fellowship he was doing amazing things so people that we have to think for making a thank for making it possible sister Robin thank you so much we're sister Robin thank you so much for your trailer it's small things but it got us all they and man the youth camp act like it was for ten weeks we were prepared for the worst well there wasn't space or anything what we made at the end we made it back so sister oh man thank you so much it is it is wonderful you always help out and it's the little things that matter and the Anzac biscuits we we really enjoyed those biscuits kids didn't get many of them but you had to feed the army yes all right sister Kay thank you so much other things you see it today but thank you so much for sister Kay for the snow gear it's it's tough when you play in the snow and your hands get cold so all that gear was put to good use trust me you'll see when the presentation comes up and then sister Christine for the food even if you had a house inspection and you were still making food for us and it was divine it was absolutely fantastic anyone we had to keep brother either one away from the lasagna all the way they and brother Cuban they just wanted that lasagna so I'm glad it made a day because we all enjoyed that the evening was really really nice so thank you so much and for everything that you you do for us so things behind the scenes but it makes a camp a camp and we didn't we didn't need anything maybe milk on the first day for the coffees but that's all we needed and we would have kind of by a day so we didn't need anything thank you so much and then brother Ben you're very special thank you so much for for making that week impossible for also the church for providing for the funds to get a stay and to enjoy and to rent the this Iggy and all those things it wouldn't have been possible without it so thank you thank you for having that burden to give the kids something special the reward it is very nice and I pray the Lord keeps you and that candlestick firm where it is in its place thank you so much and then to the team that wing with this is this is this made the weekend brother Cuban thank you so much who you are you know you weren't you weren't the Deacon this weekend you were the biggest child around there you were awesome it was so fun and and you changed the whole atmosphere you just changed the whole atmosphere and the kids could be there kids there wasn't I mean you can ask all of them brother came in was man I couldn't believe he could cheat so much you know they were I just adjust I'll use this the example we were playing ping-pong and it was the girls against the boys and the boys was dominating but the girls still managed to win I don't know but you asked him I asked you where they I've never heard there were so many rules broken a pimple before what again and then brother 801 thank you so much everything you do for us the logistics the packing the stuff the gaming the kids up the mountain getting them down the also the atmosphere because they they were the biggest kids on that plane where it was awesome to see them and and they made the kids feel like children that they could just relax and it's a it's a gift it's an absolute gift and we had some some tough discussions here on the camp there were some real good things that came out because of the atmosphere was right God could work it wasn't we going to this camp and you're going to learn about God and if you don't understand we can oh there's going to be a thickness was just fellowship like never before thank you thank you so much you want a blessing we have and then brother Isaac sister Shannon you Space Shuttle the games night after they've had so much fun I couldn't love my tummy was so it was it was ridiculous how much fun I had it was awesome it's a gift it's a gift and I see what you guys do and will pray for you so that gift would stay away as well because the children just met they were out of their skins man I was out of Moscow I was running around they having just as much fun and it is because you you absolute we created such a space that they could just be themselves and and then you can start seeing what's the burden on their cuz kids just want to play and have fun they want to be children and we saw that weekend and it was a big wake-up call for me to see that they're just a games night they it it just changed everything everything the whole dynamics of the thing so what a gift thank you and I pray that the Lord will keep that gift and that bless you for everything you do it's wonderful to have you and my wife I want to thank you specially you were logistics you do it so well we didn't short food we didn't show to get to the camp everything was organized we walked in that the bargains was ready and it was just wonderful there's no stress i I had most recent a and I know you were running around phoning everyone it's thank you it's such a gift you have somebody has to take care of all the stuff ordered stuff you know and I really would like to but I've still eight you know I can't count therefore so thank you I really thank you and may the Lord bless you and and now that that is your gift you are so talented in what you do and and I wish I can our prayer could be the same I wish our prayer could be the same so thank you so much and then for the youth man did you show up thank you so much that you came and you came with with the right attitude we didn't have problems that the camp was clean it was awesome having you guys you made the camp it was it was your camp you made the camera when we said we move on the kids were they and when we when we were singing the kids were singing and when we were doing stuff the kids were just man and I have to say the girls they they were when we had a saw you'll see it come up and the girls was just owning that man we had to get the boys in the game it was good it was good to see and and it was wonderful to spend time with you and get to know you and I pray that makes you would be the same and I would I would make it a very pray for your kids as well that will we'll keep on doing it till the day the Lord comes because it's it's a very very place of time that I had I felt ideas all the games now just to break the camp down quickly the way they said it was going to be horrible God said there was going to be amazing the day on the mountain we didn't have the wind blowing we didn't have a cloud in the sky it was perfect I mean they witnesses we drive up it's raining it's good and it's not looking too well for us it looks like it's gonna be they said it was gonna be a storm coming so well not a storm very hard rain coming through the next day it didn't happen God wanted this God will take care of us and it was he's well so I thank the Lord for giving us perfect weather we went up the mountain the kids the the first day when we got to the Friday we went up the mountain we had a bit of snow play on the mountain I had a wonderful time they then it within we got down to business we wind down the mountain again and we went to do tobogganing some serious tobogganing get very tired was awesome and then we had the Bible study the evening no I don't I don't want to speak too much about the Bible study because it was for the children and I think if it will come out if somebody speaks about it it will be great but just the thought was you're a fig tree don't forget it don't let anybody else tell you different you know what God made you and where God placed you is what God wants you and that's it don't let anybody convince you of it there's a reason you're here just as much as any other parent is here okay and then the food was we had the games night was brother Isaac and I hope you've got those things in there it was I was advising and then we had the base food thank you sister Christine it was good we had the lasagna the evening and we ended up a good day a full day we all were tired and we went to sleep and the next day we just played I think it was ultimately I still couldn't move my legs for a week it was amazing and it was fun to just fellowship with the kids and we had no plans but yet it was a wonderful day and and then the biggest thing that happened for me is we had fellowship around the world because the kids was in the right atmosphere they could actually speak about things that was in their heart and battles that was going on and and we had a Davey with no as well we had a couple of heated discussions like really good heated discussions around would and and to keep keep your your eyes on Jesus because there's a lot of voices speaking in and this time and it's hard to discern them if you're not in the word so there was a lot of things that we had one and one talks on and I know that that was that was strongholds being broken and if you didn't know you know now and and I pray that that next year's camp would be the same that the kids can come with questions and ask them and and that we can fellowship around the world it's very important that's what is full and then the Miche got sick on their Friday night after the big day apart the Saturday ya know what's the Friday and before the games we were gonna play games and Dmitry was really really not feeling well he was sick and I went down and I took some tablets and I wanted to give him some tablets and and it's just a bit of a taste amount it's quite for me it changed a lot of my thinking as well and I got to his bed and you know when somebody is dehydrated and and the staff a bit of sunstroke it takes a long while to get over it because you have to get nutrients back in your body and water to get over it and I went to him and I said how you feeling and he says he feels terrible you really feel so terrible and I said okay can I pray for you and says yes you can pray for me and I said do you want the tablet she says now we don't I don't drink tablets um we will take medicine but not not tablets I said okay it's fine then don't drink it but can at least pray for you he said please do we prayed together and animal the witness right here half an hour later he was sitting in between the children having fun normal normal his eyes were blood-red when I got they they were red you can see when somebody is not feeling like her not really in a good place and then he came back and he was there was nothing wrong nothing he joined in and he was playing this is witnesses that's God and because he took a simple step of faith and he said that that prayer would help him he go heal and that's God and he was working the whole weekend addicted and in it brings me to the last thing what do we as parents give our children because the the battles that we fighting out there is very real and they fighting it how can I explain it they finding it even with with a covering over the eye sometimes because we've got revelation and we walking in the Lord and we strong and we go forth but remember they they still young and they don't see the punches coming but what we feeding them as parents that is what they have to work on so if we feed them junk food and we feed them the world don't expect that they would would have faith to - and this is just my burden and I pray that you forgive me because it's just me but if we feed them junk food and we give them the world the only thing that they have is strength to handle the world and they'll fail because there's no substance in there we can't give them burgers and expect them to be strong they need vitamins they need minerals they need vegetables and it might not always be nice as a parent to withhold them from stuff but the battles that we fought this weekend when we were away was voices that comes from every direction and is from the friends and it's from Christianity's from from denominational Christians and it's from and it's from brothers and sisters and and and it's real battles and these brothers and sisters are telling this person that this it's right you can do it because they don't even know the truth and because it's so close to them they just accept it so the biggest thing I can after the week and ask you is what are we feeding our children if they ask for a piece of bread are you gonna give them a stone if they ask for a fish are you giving to give them a Serb that's happened they ask for more of the Lord you should we should just listen it broke my heart to hear how children can be deceived so easily so I pray that the Lord would help us after this week and I prayed even more that the Lord would help us to teach our kids what is right and what is wrong and if we say as parents it's wrong to stand on that regardless of what the world says our family our friends whatever if it's wrong we stand against it if it's not according to God's Word don't do it I encourage you because I've seen this weekend it's hard man they fighting real battles remember our battle when we were young wasn't as bad as now the internet and those things and Hollywood and music it's just out there and this weekend we had no Hollywood we had godly music and we had God's atmosphere and you could see the difference you know the atmosphere we have at Kemps that's the atmosphere that was there and it wasn't grownups making it it was them having the atmosphere they had love for it's 81 another their patience meekness gentleness kindness long-suffering there was nothing was camp atmosphere there was no grownups so they can have it say okay they can take more food that we think they can take they are ready for vegetables and you can give them that minerals so yeah I won't say anything more praise the Lord thank you for the weekend and brother beam once again thank you for making it possible and it opened a lot so much and in my first candidate to come up Joshy he wants to say something about the weekend as well good morning church so on earth on Friday morning we all went up to the mountain and first we went up the ski lift and then didn't we played a little bit and my favorite part was when my dad decided to build a snowman and then well brother month was tackling the snowman when my dad finished we were throwing snowballs at him and we took a slow-mo video of it and then we came back down the mountain had food and then we went to the toboggans and then we played there a little while and then we came went back to the village and then we had this Bible study and then after the Bible study we had food then we had the game night and then yeah that's all and the next one was Easter good morning all um yesterday I just want to thank the Lord for what he did on the ski trip for the youth firstly I just want to thank the Lord for personally revealing to me about the Bible study that brother mine held on Friday night he spoke clearly about how we should be fig trees and that we should be a fruitful Jesus Christ and I believe that I used to be the sincere fruits of the spirit it was just really clear to me that God does truly love our youth and yes the atmosphere was really nice the place we were at yes it just gave us the youth the opportunity to fellowship with one another and to know each other boy yes so I just really want to thank God for this wonderful experience and brother being and everyone who helped us and organized everything you send yes the parents especially here with us say god bless you [Applause] hello everybody so after the slow fire lightweight or sometimes like games first up was table tennis and brother Kuen keeps us entertained by breaking up heaps of table dears rules that never existed and then after that we played a row a bad game where you get a row event and you put it around your head because it has to go from here to your neck the house real hard for some people who had beards and then though played that other game was basically like tug-of-war but you know stopping over your head that made everybody look a little bit creepy and then after that we are playing a game similar to the last week in the stocking you put it on your forehead and you've got an apple on the other end you got to swing the Apple around doc over cups and some people race hurt themselves with be able and then last of all my personal favorite was our article the scaring game it was basically went there were some boxes lined up on the table and someone's got left up the box and you gotta guess what's in the box in the air several sounds easy until someone lifts up the box and these brother and once he'd stuffy up and screaming at you and generally the people on the receiving him was screaming as well so that's all he did on Friday night I just I just want to correct Davey there was one more thing that we did sister Shannon took the men on in arm wrestling yeah and needless to say she's the undisputed champion there was one though that that that correct the case Carrie congratulations man thank you so much for coming it was wonderful having you they you were awesome part of the whole weekend and we hope that you will come again it was really nice and yeah he was the only one to beat sister Shannon so here we go [Applause] you guys to just put a visual to what you've just heard most of the things they've talked about are in this video so brother Ian can you make sure the camera is sort of up on the screen so that people streaming can see it yeah just make sure it's all going correctly so that's that's that's just progress a bit and they should be sound as well where's Andy can you make sure we need to sound - because we um so we actually wrote a song well we wrote words to a tune it was it was brother bin song who knows brother beans song so we've modified it even more so it's got the first verse and then it's got brother bins verse and then it's got the camp verse so on the the that was the Saturday morning we all practice that song finished off the verses and recorded that so I've got that we've got the song playing and then we've got some photos and videos over there but just want to make sure where the music comes through we should be going we will get it we've got five brilliant minds standing around the computer back there so we should be able to make it work what youth remember their last verse of the song that we wrote so each one's so it was who knows it yes I was thank you thank you Lord for this weekend and what was the next line oh no no they were too was it twice thank you thank you all for this weekend thank you thank you all for this weekend it was an echo and the net said they've just put the reverb effect on lasagna for dinner oh what a taste ping pong games and it wasn't race thank you thank you Lord for this weekend and in the second verse we were trying to think of something different we could sing for brother beans verse and then brother little GC comes out with this American accent so he got the job of singing the second verse solo with his American accent yes I have a nice and loud so we can hear and yet thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] Amy and praise little DEP that was all there so thank you everyone for making it impossible so it's a different sort of morning this morning but we've got brother Venus going to share some now from his Papa New Guinea truck you know that video is all on YouTube now I mean god bless you all as you got the PowerPoint there can you can you put it up yes I'm Papa New Guinea for just over a week I thought Bernie know where they would have been here but so this is the theme of the of the Convention was behold at midnight there's a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him and thy way I can drive this kind of so just a background of just a bit of a geography lesson so Papua New Guinea snore north of Australia Australia's down here Solomon Islands is along here so I went up to so where's where my parents used to be in in rebelle so this is where I went to three brothers three pastors from just west of kunde our here in the highlands region came to the meetings as well I have been there as well once so they came over and it was good by the a moss who was the pasture and rebell he he had it that it wasn't just me taking all the services and to me that was the major highlight was to see a people stand up under the anointing of this word and preach it not just not just parroting something they've heard from New Zealand or wherever but the same revelation we have they preacher with that same you know same anointing and it was it was incredible to see that because they had the Saints Vichy and rebell had suffered a lot of persecution 2010 I went over there and I baptized pasty Massey and 15 other people the church came out of their denomination the Pentecostal denomination they embrace this message but because they were baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ the other church they came out of the great persecution past Dimas was banned from preaching for a year the couple whose whose choice to land us on the banned from going to church for a month a lot of and a lot of pressure from these other churches you know what he you're listening to a liar and this man's a false prophet and there's one man I am when I was EO 2010 I preached in his church is part of this denomination they came out of and he was actually he was actually wanting to get baptized he passed him most of whom were very good friends and they any and pass Dimas you know do you believe this he said yes then they had a council meeting with all the other elders of the other churches because the denomination control these are always a committee in charge and then he turned against and he wrote letters against this message and he and he sent it around everywhere he was in his 30s I think of that he got a disease in his kidneys and he died and there was another another another pastor in the same denomination the last year stood up and started attacking this message and against the believers he was he he became paralyzed and he died this message that we believe is not doctrine it's the Lord Jesus Christ himself and so sometimes people just go into the world they continue against it other times God just takes them to show you're not against these people you're against God can you play this all the upside down ones of videos that comes right away so just a so this is basically where they live this is their house very third world they just got power in the village into last year let's hear so this is this is where we were there's only like a short video that saw one of the brothers modem there there's a brother got baptized this is the house that we stayed and they built this house just before we turned up and the pastors from the highlands they they they dedicated this house it's two-bedroom place they just to give you an idea this is not staying at a Hilton and preaching in some way you know this is third world but they have something we do not have they have a simple life they don't have all this clutter in this this thing and all this busyness and stuff and to me I think they're very blessed but they want what we have but I wish we had what they had we are blessed in this country but yet there's a curse worth worth civilization this is this is my room this is just to show you he says a couple of sleeping mats a third mattress couple clothes in a mosquito net I had great sleeps I was actually pretty comfortable oh yes that's where I was there's the next one as you know Jonah play at least a hundred people on Sunday and from the Monday [Music] but a lot of people have been at nighttime if you saw as that as the shot was petting around there's some big speakers they had at nighttime or when it wasn't raining the speakers on this side were put outside just to blast into the jungle hallelujah hey give the winds a mighty voice and so so there are a lot of people not just in the back there's more people there than in the video sure but they'd be out and the bush just sitting there listening and pasty most translated for me so it was good because um so we had three three services a day we two in the morning we had one dinner break then another one I took those ones but it was basically unfortunate because you're translating or you're being translated you preach half half the amount and twice as much time because going to be translated and then the brothers took the evening services I took one of them but it was good it was just really a real blessing so this is this is one of the night services these are all the children hello children they would sit in the morning for about four hours no break didn't get up that's concrete floor with the tarpaulin for hours they would sit amen we we're soft they they would sit there literally for four hours and I'd listen to me and that would be listening and it's past emo so what would happen at night because the first first because yo behold the bridegroom cometh fast the moistures said hey the bridegroom's come you gotta go out to meet him go to boil the oil have you even baptized the right way have you given your life you know just straight up are you ready we're at the end and so huh by that time half the children were asleep so as the altar call is being made there's our sisters would come drag the asleep children to the back to to make some room because from where I was standing here by one of the so the first night it was about twelve people came and in twenty then about thirty I think about maybe 40 by by Saturday night and I was standing here and that was full of people just full of people just coming and they were crying on God they're sincere they wanted to down to make sure they're ready yeah just say yeah we're saying now saying the tribulation is coming you don't want to go into that place big play heavy Amy come up which is the tribulation is going to come are you ready the bridegroom is coming where he's come go out to meet him so it was a tremendous time and uh here's pastor Nikolas he's preaching on the seven seals Church ages this brothers from the Highlands they had elections in July this is the kind of country does that elections in July national elections he's in charge he's head over to cleanse within the tribe I'd know how many people that is but it's quite a few people he told us people this election don't vote we voted for Jesus Christ we're not going to vote this election he just felt it and then what happened as the results the election came in and there were two MPs said they won the they won the district to be in Parliament in this tribal fighting people got killed but because his himself and his people didn't vote they weren't caught up in it it's a wreck I was at his place a few years ago preaching there was a it was a gunshot one night during the surface I didn't hear it but opposed he or did you hear that gunshot no I didn't and they you know they you know we don't hear about what goes up in this place and if we did our newspapers would be full and you'd be shocked by the death and the killing and the hardship and the droughts and the famine and the starvation and the sickness and that's just life for them yeah yeah once upon time he led his people into war then then he got shot by the police threw a leg he said he was going to start a tribal fight and he wanted to start it started the fight this before he became a Christian sow the fight the police shot him in the leg so I got taken to hospital his life was speed people died in that fight this is what they cooked on this is the air this was the kitchen hundred hundred people a couple of logs and a thing this is it this is how they live we had a toastie maker as well because they just got power so we had ox and palm beef and onion toasties they're very good I'm sorry so and what they decided to do is they so for the Saturday they decided let's go have an open-air campaign at the market and rebell so they packed up all that sound equipment load it in one in a truck and they went to the market place on its own can you play that one [Music] market on Saturday and then she died probably 2000 people and the vast majority here in that come forward and stand here in the front to listen but because it was so loud they could just stand and listen and there were people standing and there were listening and this is the first time this has been done here in rebel open-air campaign because the hand they were a persecuted they were but they've stood up and this isn't even before I thought there wasn't much you know those days they said no this is the word this is the truth this is Jesus Christ I mean so this is this was groundbreaking because this place is full of religion Catholics everything every denomination honor the sons their you know she's a lot of lot of religion it's a place of bloodshed as well the Japanese had the headquarters and rebell here during World War two Admiral Yamamoto had his headquarters for the Pacific Theater in this place so there's been a lot of bloodshed a lot of conflict over a religion but God's bride is standing I mean now let's just can we play this one as well this one this is massive and he's asking the question do you know what time you're alive you know what your message is do you know where you are in the Bible do you know what age you're you're Europe and people were listening the market manager after they finished they said you must come back again I've never heard this before you must come back again so I just thinking well you should do what you're told so they've got an open door invitation those people actually want to know there's people out there there's a lot of a policies like in the book of Acts they just don't know up there it was a real unity of spirit like we're one flesh beautiful is so amazing to see harmony you know not trying to emphasize this very strongly this message there's not a white man message that it's not an American message this is mission from heaven I mean I saw it preached and about you know two languages past the emos would be preaching you know Justin Justin pigeon then he'd gone to his local language this well what capitis is is at least 800 languages in Papua New Guinea language is not dialects languages but to see him stand there preach it in his own language but with real authority and real you know real anointing of Oz just just made my life so now we come to the point where he says people come to the front they want to give their lives someone to get baptized and Sunday morning we had Sunday nights no Saturday Saturday night there was one person that gave their name forward and then Sunday morning before service 20 and then by the end of the morning service on Saturday there was 28 and there was a few others who wanted to get baptized as well but they couldn't make it to the baptism so he hired this vehicle we packed everyone in like sardines this is this is public transport over there and most of these ones that got baptized are actually from a Methodist Church and two weeks before the meeting say yeah this is youth and two weeks before the means I start having prayer meetings and calling upon God and I think those would eat calling to the deep you should have you should hear these people pray they're not quiet you know in those services and everyone prays you can't hear yourself think and I'm just praying there God take control bind every religious spirit you know don't need anything else have preeminence in this place break the chains yeah I'm praying because I don't know what they're praying about I don't know what spirits on them because they're from any church Under the Sun yeah there's people there you know there's Pentecostal church they came out of miracles sure this healing sure but they they won't even be baptized in them Lord Jesus Christ and the prophecies you don't even need a revelation for that you just read the scripture but they won't even accept this word well that's not God's Spirit that's a demon power so these things these things you're to fight against that's the same thing here but it's more prevalent they're you know Hollywood and lukewarm living is probably the battle here more it's still the battle there as well yeah so praise the Lord there was it was amazing so let's just go the next one okay let's play this this is just thee no this is this is a good road in Papua New Guinea but I want to show this because now you can't really see it but so that's most of the people are getting baptized so that you we just saw that's that you were three on the back now we're so sorry so we're behind them and you look at those back tires you think they're gonna burst how are we going to get to where to get a baptized and and the driver was worried driving down he's like well I think you know I thought the Lord was too heavy the same amount of people come back on the same vehicle and he and his testimony is it's like I had an empty load driving back and he's not even a Christian at all yes that's so that's the typical Road I'm the Brethren from the highlands their their plane was come in their boat so there's only one ship that services the New Guinea islands and when we're there we found out it's in dry dock and Madang on the mainland it's going to be there for a month because the yes oh so they're all worried how they're going to get home they have to get home so we so we bought them plane tickets to get home so they flew to lay and then they had to get up you're the main highway up to the Highlands and ask them well how long does that take and past Nikolas said well depends you know if the bus drivers tired we just pull over and sleep and then we can we start the next day so it could take a few days and he said you know sometimes these holdups but if they don't have high-powered weapons we fight them but but if they do we give up he says but it's never happened to me that's what he said but you know that's um so here's some of them so here's the people with the baptism site here's the people who were getting baptized very sincere and tears very sincere one of the other brothers brother model before they went to the water he spoke to them and said are you ready you know do you want to give your life a listen and all the world yes and determined and yes I want to I want to serve the Lord and it was wonderful to see here so here's here's one of the shots and here's pastor he must pass to Nikolas baptizing I thought it was good I said I said you baptized them because I said I'm just a tourist I come and go you know but this is your work the people because the people have to see it's not about the visiting minister they have to acknowledge the gifts in their own mitts and in their own country because they they have to rise up to their position but if but a visiting ministry always comes always look to them and they don't and they belittle the gift that's in their own country and I feel many times the gifts in their own country are far greater than the ones that you know the visit just just speaking of my own self and see anyway so here's so this lady so so watching the baptisms and she so she takes takes people from the beach out to hear pastor Nicholas pasty Massa baptizing and I'm thinking what's going on here and I asked them out after the end she is actually one of the adult youth leaders in the Methodist Church she doesn't get baptized but she's helping her people get to the baptism effect so i said god bless her i don't know what her name is but lord i say god bless that woman you think that's quite strange but hey God God works in mysterious ways now now here's a burden I wanted a place I know meet you this so this is not a curved building is just a Pam Eric photograph there's a three story department building this is this is the capital of the province East New Britain so this is a basically a harvey norman and a supermarket all meshed into one now you can buy plenty of dictionaries these are all dictionaries you can buy heaps of dictionaries there you can buy any assortment of statues of Jesus or Mary glow-in-the-dark crucifix dongle on the dock this is your choice I'm not saying this as a joke I want you to really think about this this is the Bible selection most of these are Catholic prayer books we have a English English standard version Bible or a good news Bible both of those translations are no good this is this is the biggest store in the province and this is it here I put the Spanish infant booty no earlier but anyway so King James Version for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the Holy Ghost these three are one and there are three that bear witness in earth the spirit and the water and the blood these three agree in one English standard version for there are three that testify the spirit and the blood water and the blood and these three agree this is the Bible they can get and it's no good we have access to the word I'm so thankful we do now this is this is a serum sister Sarah and this is modeled as severe so their marriage so this is the so they own the place with the churches they got baptized years ago she is so happy at the end of the services just crime she said God has shaken this place she's so happy to see people you know cuz they're like because I asked you these people in the message they need to get into the message that yo this is true yeah these people have sold out they believe this is the Lord Jesus Christ they're fully persuaded hallelujah and the husband madam yeah they are these people are oil tea I'm showing you these photos because we're going to see you meet these people one day it's either going there or in heaven you'll meet so pray for these people because they have a tremendous burden for their community they have a tremendous burden for thee for the work there's 7 million people that they know of and Papua New Guinea it's very hard to travel nationally there's not interconnecting roads like we do barely tar sealed on a good day the potholes have potholes you know the plains are very expensive the shipping doesn't work anymore so it's it's quite a it's quite a big country but God will find his own this is this is past a mosque this is his wife metalita now this is the firstborn Emma this is the youngest Lydia I can't remember their middle child's name and I don't and this is a girl that I think just just lives with him so this is pasty moss and he's on fire Hey and he knows and whom he has believed and so she and it's tremendous you pray for these people whatever you do because if we're not in our place within order in their place we can't go home we're stuck here and you know it goes both ways so this side is not a good photos past Amasya this is past the necklace so these brothers are from chim businesses this is a brother John and pastor Anton these brothers are from Jimbo and they they have and they're and they're wonderful mean and they know in whom they have believed they preached this word with everything within them and even and they have a real burden too to see the word spread and yes oh so we got them plane tickets to go home because I real upset how we're gonna get home we have to get home and so it's a week so we help them out they this is this is brother Boniface this is the first man I baptized in Papua New Guinea back in 2009 I believe it was but he doesn't come up to fellowship here he needs fellowship but he's he's got a he has a gifted man and he's a real blessing so pray for me he said it so his wife didn't come to the services he only came for the weekend but it but he said to me you know my wife wants to get baptized now so there's a stirring going on so God's elect will respond and this is Ruth oh that's that's me that's Ruth she is the first this is my parents house maid that started it all back in 2008 I prayed Lord how can I share this with people I don't even understand their language I only speak a little bit but a pidgin and the Lord said very clearly tell her your testimony when she comes to work tell her your testimony show the deep calls that they've been explained the ministry from scripture and God supernaturally got ahold of her and she started to be a witness and she witnessed to to the people up in toto Vail we passed a mosses that's how the missus got there and that's how they embraced it so but pray for her if she doesn't go to fellowship and she's kind of leaning back towards her old denomination you know there's a call come out of who my people be not partakers of her sins and we don't want to we don't want to humanly just say it's all right sure people may stay that they may get saved but I don't want anyone to go into the Great Tribulation I don't want anyone to stand before the great white throne judgment because the great white throne judgment is not really we think our mercy will be given to some it will but the God that's full of mercy and grace today standing before you will be a god of Wrath and judgment in that day and he's not a respecter of persons so they must come out they must come out oh this is the video from the baptism is that the ending we were there for a good few hours [Music] well this thing about they think I'm looking at the Jesus base here singing is Solomon he's still in the denomination that passed him off from the church came out of but because they have such good influence with the people you know they got all the musicians from the church that used to be against them and and they wanted them there in the meetings to God to grip them because you are they fight against the Baptist and all these things you know you can say yeah I showed them in the word Howard his name will be called Prince of Peace the mighty God the everlasting father you know Emmanuel all these different things but then why the Angels say caller's name Jesus and Jehovah Jireh and you're all the all the names of the Old Testament are in Jesus Christ you know so why wouldn't you take on the name of the one who redeemed you and yeah [Music] go here drive she's calling on God most of them work I wouldn't just dry out condition you know these people are like Lord off I want and don't leave me behind the way that was very good we we go into the rainy season it rained when I first attack and then when we needed to go down to the market for the open air it just started raining yeah it only rain yes a night like in the middle of night some people could walk to the services not in the rain people could sit outside not in the rain God undertook in a lot of ways but supernaturally was the bride is on this plane Papua New Guinea and it was the mighty Isis brothers the success of these beings is not me it's not because I'm here it's because you the Lord has taken you under using you in this place and that's what I want to say I said I'm just here to visit that is you have taken this and for once a somewhat a group was downtrodden and there was fear and all kinds of things now they're on their feet and now it's the enemies on the run I thought either chase them down kill us kill him don't just watch them flee pursue hallelujah so God bless you all thank you for everyone who pays Tyson and give to the church because without you I could never go and it was a trimming it was the best time I've ever been up there so the work is expanding so keep them in prayer yeah okay brother Isaac I'll pass back home to you god bless you all as a little oK we've got the item special from Rebecca and I think Easter and then we just saw a worship song after that and then rather pinkie minister god bless you so they're going to sing play through a duet of the national anthem and I don't know if all of you foreigners that have migrated here know our national anthem but it's a powerful prayer it's probably the most Christian anthem in the world and we've probably only ever heard the first two verses at a rugby game but actually you'll hear because we'll sing as a congregation after they do they do it this just stand and we'll sing and just you'll see the words and you'll see how powerful the prayer is and just pray it as you sing it because you know as both Isaac was saying we have a we have a Goshen you could say on an actual perspective where we can we've got a country we can worship garden you know and we've got freedom of religion still and we want to maintain that we want to keep that we want God to defend it amen and so let's just pray that with their hearts as we sing you really bicker three two [Music] Hey hi - oh my ha ha ah

grandfather filled glory in Jesus Christ's name Lord just take the service under your total control and Jesus Christ's name we ask these things amen amen hallelujah god bless you think of realizing hey man god bless you all good to have Rachel here god bless you welcome bless you amen wasn't sure if you're here or not and then here you are so god bless you great to have you here amen yes it is just so the sunday of of Labor weekend which is a 22nd of October we're gonna have Communion and foot washing that evening also be we need to organize a working B to finish everything in here put the stage in fix that wall and we need to move the shelf with all the message books out there as well so everyone because they're all free and available for everyone who's ever will but let's when he does this because we've moved in let's finish moving in amen now let's go to Isaiah 62 and then we're gonna go look 23 thank you for your praise as well when I was away I made a world of difference eternity will show just how important you know Priya Priya changes things so as I a 62 and verse 1 it says for Zions sake will I not hold my peace and for Jerusalem's sake I'll not rest until the righteous this there of go forth as brightness and her salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth and the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all Kings thy glory and thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord shall name thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God thou shall no more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land anymore be termed desolate but thou shalt be called hip-hip Sabah and I'll and Beulah for the Lord delighteth in thee and thy land shall be married for as a young man marries a virgin so shall thy sons marry thee and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride so shall thy God rejoice over thee hallelujah and let's go to let's go to Luke chapter 23 and we'll read verses 38 to 43 and it says here and superscription also was written over him and leaders of Greek and Latin and Hebrew this is the King of the Jews and one of the male factors which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be Christ save thyself and us but the other answering rebuked him saying does not thou feed God seeing thou art in the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our deeds but this man has done nothing amiss and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto Him verily I say unto thee today thou shalt be with me in paradise Amen may the Lord bless his word this morning you may have your seats now we just read two very contrasting scriptures one of one of where God is saying that the bride you know that national anthem is thinking it should be God defend the bride God defend yo this land this word that we have you know I you know I was very blessed by that but you know it should be more than just more than a country's national anthem I think as brother nd said but you see we have a such a contrast in these scriptures where one is saying that the Lord will you know delight and delight in thee as a bridegroom rejoices over a bride of a freshness of a love of a union coming at the place and then we read a scripture where there's two thieves hanging on a cross and they and one is railing on him you know if you're really God if you're really true if you're really what you claim to be saved me and you just do it you know what kind of attitude that is and then the other one says does thou not fear God seeing that thou art thou art in the same condemnation now the now the two hanging on the cross they saw Jesus at the last kind of manifestation of his earthly journey yeah because he would die but when he resurrected he was in a different form than just a natural body and so we are living we are basically the thief thieves on the cross I mean we're at the end we weren't here when when when the Son of man first arose and there was the healing ministry the first pull the second pull yeah we're living in the time of the third pull but we're right at the end where the door to Mercy is being shut yeah and God was closing a door to the Jews in the state where the where the lamb sacrifice of the temple yo before this happened it was fine but after it happened it was not fine because his access to Mercy was changing and he was closing a door to a people and he was and so I wonder if I could entitle this something I'd say don't you fear God there should be you know we maybe it's my fault but sometimes we lean too much on the love mercy and grace but we should have a real godly fear you know because God God it says in Romans 2 11 it says for there is not a respective persons with God he doesn't he doesn't have any respect you know if it's if it's one of us bride you know the wise virginal the foolish virgin or or or those in the Beast system he doesn't have any respective person hey yo he doesn't have any respected person he holds everyone accountable to the same thing which is his word I mean he does not he shall not wink at our ignorance ow our professed ignorance you know unfortunately we know too much we've been it's been yeah this word himself in this hour has been known to us too much I mean that he could just wink on our ignorance and and we can scrape in does there not fear God we must be careful we must be very careful where that we you know these are saying that brother Bram users yeah this is saying where man will walk with hobnail choose where angels fear to tried so I'll just wait on like nothing there's no danger there's no worry and they just wade on through because jesus loves me this I know for the Bible tells me so but what is your response to that love what is your response like you know he said in Isaiah 62 as a bridegroom rejoices over a bride shall sow thy god be with thee so now what should out be our response be to the scars where he's now now purchase your salvation I've lifted you up I've called you out of darkness County out of her my people be not my taker place there's been a call come and we responded to this call and he's rejoicing here's my bride I'm gonna unite myself with her hallelujah our love can be manifested we're gonna really become one I mean like a new love our first love hallelujah you know you know in the in the Eastern culture the bride groom took care of everything he called the guests he furnished the wedding he did everything so imagine now you've been planning now I've got been planning for many thousands of years before there was time he was planning it in his mind hallelujah how the ceremony is going to go and how he's going to send the invitations and how they're going to be arrayed in fine linen clean and white the Rice's of saints and the food we get to enjoy the banqueting table he's going to layout and the decor and you know all the he's been planning it and then finally he sees that become manifest hallelujah all the planning all the detail I'm God is a God of detail oh I want to be like that I mean so now he begins to see it all being laid out and he sees the guests arrive hallelujah he sees us he sees his bride is now right in the wedding garment then he picked out and here she comes don't you think you'd be he'd be excited don't you think of that is just a natural bridegroom who remembers the wonderful day when you got married and the summer six now the day it arrived maybe enough was the morning feels the afternoon for us and it was like a you're waiting and you're waiting even though it's just a few hours under such expectation you've gone through the rehearsal but this is more than the rehearsal I mean you've you've promised everything you are to your spouse but now here's the official ceremony you know even though that unites you know your value nights you but here they so you remember that time and then you're standing there at thee you know foot of the stairs or whatever in the church and then the music begins to play and then and then the bride and the bridesmaids come on or whoever comes in but the one you're looking for to come here she comes why should God and then now you see here walking up then you get real nervous because you're excited and you had your heart's full of love and you don't know what's what you're gonna do you in terms of you gonna start crying you're gonna you know I was standing there and my knees begin to shake I thought I hope this is not up but I'm so happy because the day had arrived amen and then it seems all over so very quickly but that's just the it's a yo but doesn't in there it gets more wonderful and more glorious and you love them more and you appreciate them more and you enjoy them more hallelujah now if that's just a natural wedding how much more God thousands of years in the planning and here we are what should our response be to that what should our response here's the bridegroom oh my love I'm so happy with Mary we're 1 hallelujah I'm sorry it's a it's a joy to wear to show that I'm United with you Alleluia by you know by wedding band and you know we're mr. and mrs. and you know we're the couple and you know I'm so glad this day is taking place and what if she just like yeah yeah good ahead better desert you know didn't really like it what kind of response now would be I'm not saying that as a joke but just think about it because this is how a lot of people respond to God this is their attitude now it's not convenient for me I want to do it my way I'm gonna I wanna I have things I have to deal with know that is actually just a defense of actually I don't want to surrender that's all it is oh I've got to deal with a few things though let God deal with it and it's from when you fully surrender to him that's when he deals with it Amy but if you're holding a bit of yourself back how can he fully take you and use you and mold you over I mean that's how that's how people's attitudes are now I'll do it later it's not convenient for me yes you put out this big spread you see it ministry you seen the lives of the Prophet you yourself have revealed yourself through your word in this hour you have / vindicated yourself God you've proven yourself alive and well you've shown this is more than a storybook you know you come down service after service or just listening to a tape or hearing song or and prayer you come down with us all the time let sure you do those things but not now it's not convenient for me what kind of the choo-choo we have how good is our God how great it is his word hallelujah had tremendous Izzy hey so good to us I don't just want you get excited you to really think about how good is he that the winning go off without a hitch yes did he free from darkness yes did he call you out was there something in here that said that's my Lord speaking and you responded you began to walk hallelujah did he do all these things did he purchase your Redemption and then we look at it and say well maybe another time God is not a respecter of persons doesn't matter all we say well I'm the Bride of Christ well God will actually hold you more accountable amen he actually hold you more accountable he's not a respecter of persons he respects us he so he treats everyone the same everyone exactly a level playing field the rich young ruler came to Jesus and Mark chapter 10 and he was a man now he was a man he was a good young person it could be any age it doesn't really matter you know for us but he saw that Jesus had something that is that his teachers and his churches did not have so he ran to and mark 10 and 17 and he and when he was gone forth into the wastes this is Jesus now there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life said so when he was in the way this man came running he wasn't dragged he came running what shall I do what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life and Jesus said why course thou me good for there is none good but one that is God but they lost the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud honor honor thy father and mother and he said any answered and said unto master all these have I observed from my youth now this is the very God God in flesh knows all things he didn't deny that this is in mark 10 and 21 then Jesus beholding him loved him so Jesus loved them the love of God doesn't keep people out of destruction the love of God does not because it says that Jesus when he saw him this is a good young man this man has got qualities he's a devout man he's a sincere man you know he's not just floating along with the tide he wants to know and he's come to me he's got good qualities the things that he that no doubt he wanted to see manifested any any young people under the law this is what he's singing this man so he loved them and he said one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou has to give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and take up the cross and follow me and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions now this man needed a revelation and he received his revelation revelation doesn't always make us happy it doesn't always make us say yes I'll do it amen but the final thing that you've got to die to that's when you got to see you're gonna hold on to your own world only those who have surrendered their entire will to God will be in heaven those who keep their will will not be in heaven yet they become a prisoner and so he needed a revelation what can I do to inherit eternal life and Jesus gave him that revelation I'm going to tell you what you need to do sell oh you have give it to the poor and you have treasure in heaven take up your cross and follow me you must be willing to bear their approach but it wasn't willing to do it he and he countered his natural life and the things he had understanding in the community and all those different things greater greater things than being in heaven you say well that's crazy well people are still doing the same thing today don't you fear God well at another time I can do it at another time is more convenient but there comes a time when there's no other time rather Bram said so people say well I need a revelation on the word it's in here if you sincerely pray it will be here and you won't go anywhere till you come back to that spot and God's on the obligated tip on once whether we like it or not you know we have it so good sometimes we can just just keep plowing over God's mercy and there's a line is a line between mercy and judgment and if we cross his word we don't get to choose our own judgment we don't you know if we if we step over the boundary of his word you can't choose you know David was David was smart actually God did give him a choice but he said Lord whatever's best you judge me and and there's a plague and killed a whole bunch of people but we don't really keep the choose just have you step over the boundary well it doesn't matter you know it doesn't matter if I go against his word he still loves me no he'll make you pay do you want to pay those wages you want to suffer that I mean I just want you to think about this thing do you want to suffer those things because it says in Hebrews 12 and 14 it says follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God least any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and whereby many be defiled he's talking to believers he's talking to believers with us this is we are not exempt from anything we have the same battles that they have in the world whether we like it or not we have the same enemy comes against them comes against us but the real believer that separate themselves to God has an overcoming power and it's not a legalistic way of being separated it's being separated and heart I mean being separated and hard as how you separate to him you know there came a time when when there's a restoration there was near Myron Ezra and they had to separate out from the priesthood all those who had mixed themselves with the races of the world around them they had to separate those people out you say well that's pretty harsh you know they couldn't change what they did but we can get a new birth this morning we can be how nature can be changed everything the devil is mixed into us can be separated out of us he did and then Ezra so astonished he hears that the people married with people around them the heathen nations and he's astonished and he sits the Flex Somers Somers beard out I think and he and he sits there astonished she's so shocked what the people have done with the holy seed it says in the Bible that's the same thing we can be we should be so you know people don't blush anymore people aren't shocked by anything anymore program sees in one place that blushes actually if you do it's actually it's a defense he sees because we should be we shouldn't be so numbed to sin we shouldn't be numb to iniquity we shouldn't be numb to the effects of darkness oh that's just what happens no we can't just accept it and say well no we should be shocked by it we should be we should be upset yes I mean we should be upset when people are those do things that are know that aren't right not against them but God they're living below their privilege they're living below what God has ordained them to be God set them free from that darkness because it says he'll seal those that that sign cry for the abominations done in the city I meant you know you know I think it's an easy kill here's the man that had an income and he sealed those on their foreheads gave them the Holy Ghost those that sighed and cried for the abominations down in the city and this was before those came with the slaughtering weapons to kill everyone the destruction and the city the city that we should sign craft the abominations done in is this city yeah we can't condemn those out there they're in darkness they are lost to begin with you gets like your brother has his about a pig you can't tell a pig come out of the mud get dressed and you've got to live a better life by nature he's a pig you can't help him he's going to get a new nature at him and then he can live then he can live a different kind of life but now those who have started for the kingdom never sinned send his unbelief and they condemn brother Graham says they condemned already out there because they either believe not i condemned already the scripture tells us so you can't condemn them all that trouble that's trouble it's horrible but you've got to start they've gotta start on their walk be with me and so now it's not they it's not that necessarily we should just saw him cry forward but we should but we should sign crafts the abomination is done within the city of the believers hey with me not to put people down you understand that you shouldn't just be numb because people who just wait on and sit and unbelief we can just continue on continue and continue on he'll come to a time just like the days of Noah I'm done I've tried to persuade them I've sent my word I am my word I've said can be united to me they won't come I see it the invitation it's done you say but I'm in the message that doesn't mean too much you don't we don't get into heaven by association you don't come into you you don't come you're not gonna be in a rapture because you come to this place I mean or we're any other churches around the world that's not a ticket to the rapture I took it to the raptures because you've received a new birth and a real one it produces the real fruits of the spirit and not a pride and arrogancy lifting yourself up above others isn't that right and our religious spirit will exalt itself and it will proclaim itself brother Bram never proclaimed himself he never advertised himself cuz it was real humility real humble spirit II head and that was god-given but God will not always strive with man he says and so this is back in Hebrews 12 and 16 he says so he speaks about the root of bitterness it says lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright for ye know that afterwards when he would have had inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears so Paula sang do not be like him he was he was entitled to the birthright he was entitled by his birth I couldn't receive this birthright but he took a natural thing and he put that at a higher esteem just some food and we can take well our lifestyle and how we dress and what we do you know if the things we do our country to the scripture and makes you do things which are not according to this which is ungodly things I would I'd find something else to do I would seriously find something else to do but God overlooks that God is loved but he's also God of wrath yes and a God of judgment and God is not a respecter of persons you know God is not an old doting granddad which just spoils as kids you can do what you want that's what Israel thought he was will never be taken in to bad blood well now we can do yo we're God's chosen people we're in the inheritance they were but they did not fear the Lord they they took it for granted who they were by the associate our living all we're in the message we believe this message we believe God's in a prophet God can't take us you know God can't take us out of this place don't take it for granted he say while you're leaning one way pretty hard I I maybe I don't think I am because because there is a there's a flip side to fearing the Lord and that flip side I'll come to later okay brother BAM sees in leadership 1965 speaking of the rich young ruler life though he had achieved this young fellow he had achieved all good things in school being fine as a good boy no doubt he'd been good as a real father and listening to his daddy in business he had been a good boy good to his parents he'd been loyal to his priest he'd been loyal to his church had been loyal to the commandments of God but he lost the greatest thing and the rest of them didn't mean very much to him when he turned down the leadership of eternal life Jesus Christ buh-bam said he turned down eternal life the leadership of eternal life notice this leadership confronts every one of us today the same thing as it did that young men no matter how religious we are you may be Catholic Baptist Methodist or maybe Pentecostal or whatever you are this same thing confronts you tonight I'll say this morning eternal life that's acceptance of Jesus Christ we're given this opportunity he turned down eternal life and the last and the next part brother Graham links the two parables together there's a rich man and a bigger called Nazareth and they both die the rich man goes to hell Lazarus the big goes up into Abraham's bosom and brother bad links the two parables together where he turned down now I don't believe this this rich young ruler became an atheist he would have ploughed on I'll give more I'll serve more I'll do more but doing more serving more giving more without the leadership of eternal life doesn't do you all that much right it doesn't do you all that much we don't want to be like Esau Esau sold out he didn't hold dear what he had he took it for granted we don't want to stand in jeopardy like that amen we don't want to take it for granted you say well why don't I have you say but but God has done great things for me God thing did did great things for Balaam anointed of many times and he prophesized God did great things for many people who have just been anointed but just because someone's anointed doesn't mean they they go to heaven jesus said many will come to me in that day saying Lord Lord have I not done many mighty things now what's this person doing he's actually actually making an appeal they're standing in a judgment Lord have I not done things for you have a not cast out Devils in your name though many mighty works preached in your name lifts for you in my day and hour and he and he doesn't deny they see is the for me either worked iniquity either work I never knew you so these were religious people these are religious people God uses them benefit gifted people hallelujah Amen but they were workers of iniquity see God is not a respecter of persons he doesn't take yes you preached in my name you did miracles you proclaimed my name therefore I'll let you in know I see it's not you were a work of iniquity I can't let you in God is not a respecter of persons and there were people upon the earth that will fulfill that scripture there are whether we like it or not because God is not a respecter of persons so why would we sell our birthright for such a small thing well what will my family think of me what will my you know you know the people who do the same hobby or sport I do what will they think well my family think what will these people think who cares what they think who's going to lead you into heaven as it Jones at the golf club or wherever is it you know or is it God himself who's gonna let he's not gonna be standing there so who's your God who's your God is it is it this not just part of it we don't want to live now you say it's very easy to bash the nomination I'm not talking about them it's very easy for people they may say they believe it but in reality they've taken twink and they'll begin to twink out versus now that's that's old-fashioned to live a wholly separate life to God no you mean I have to quit wearing this and doing this and saying this twink it out doesn't matter that's what people do I wouldn't you think about this we don't want to be caught with a twink toute Bible because anyone like that hasn't been fully converted yet because if the same God at the same spirit dwells in you and wrote this word you'll say yes something I say yes that's true yes that's your word God yes I believe that truth because you can't deny it if the same one how can an author how can an author reject his own work an author cannot they say yes that's my handiwork so how so how much more now if this is a perfect word which it is how can God say no that that doesn't apply for today oh that's wrong with no that's not right but people act that way but God is not a respecter of persons season Hebrews 13 in 13 let us go therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach we don't want to stand our own camp you know your lifestyle your culture your society your comfort zone you go beyond those things you have to be carrying you got to be willing to carry his reproach Jesus and every age has always had her approach you know it's not been oh just a sweet easy ride for the believers there now suddenly harder than this day they had they had it hot in every day you go back into the real me status age which John Weasley was there he had he got kicked out of the churches isn't here to preach open em it was a reproach to be a Methodist in that day it was our approach to be a real Lutheran in the Lutheran Day it was that elzar approach to be a disciple in Jesus's day yes I made it every every age down through it was her approach but the question was are you willing to bear his reproach are you willing to say yes Lord I'll carry that for you I'm carrying like a trophy or a crown I'm so proud to carry your approach are you willing I'm very willing I say yes what I'll do it because I'll have treasures in heaven hallelujah you know the believer is the best businessman in all the world because they invest in the right place are you investing in the right place he'd better be investing in the right place because one day this will be ashes and then when you go to the bank of heaven do you have an account sir ma'am no I'm sorry you're not here off you go for some people that will be that way but I serve this church I did this I did this no you're not here but I did this and this and this and this you're not here sir hey sure we've never had a virus in our computer system sir because they're placed razors in the wrong place I want to put treasures in heaven it's been his approach you know there's a reward we forget sometimes you're the devil says well if you stop if you got to dress modestly you've got to dress this way and speak this way and get rid of your shorts and the tight pants all these different things or people will make fun of you and he doesn't show you if you do these things because you love them and it's in this word you'll have eternal life that the reward is so much greater than their then their perceived retina and the end the stigma of it mid 30 degree temperature all but it's tropical wouldn't you wear truffle of clothing I did and the sisters dress the right way hallelujah and it's and it's hot and everyone sweating doesn't matter if you're local or not a local that's thinking hot but the believers still address the right way oh but it's hot over there so what I'll bear theater approach I want to be idea I don't want to try and be different but I'm proud few people say well why do you like this well do you really want enough beer you must be let us bear his reproach let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach Hebrews 13 13 see it's not just under something else it's under him where he is you we're gonna be where he is you understand Esau sold his birthright we must be careful we not do that we must not do the same thing now a season in hearing receiving acting on the Word of God 1916 now we find that this birthright mean everything to Jacob now he didn't care for it for nothing else but that birthright he didn't care what it cost him I trust me and say ah I'm a Jacob today if it was a mess of pottage he was glad to give it back to Esau so what so does with any man a woman that's been ordained to eternal life that God is called to eternal life is willing to sell out anything of the world to obtain that birthright you can call them anything you want to you can tell them they've lost their mind gone off on the deep end bunch of holy rollers I don't care what you call them they're seeking for that birthright and that means more than anything else they are after that birthright no matter how they have to get it they're ready to get it remember the birthright today is being sealed into the kingdom by the Holy Ghost and you're blessed to hunger and thirst so I just got to thank him that your hunger and thirst account or mine wants God to bring the birthright down to their level make it more approachable for me god that's what a cattleman wants to do but for me and I believe all true born Christians we meet it on God's level which is according to his word I don't care what I have to do or what I have to say or how I have to act the only thing I want it it means more than my popularity it means more than my job that means more than my mother more than my wife more than my children more than every friend I've got let me have that birthright hallelujah that's that's how it's got to be I don't care what people think of me I don't care I actually have one in my jacket pocket I don't care what people say about me I don't care about how people treat me what are the inside ones I want that birthright hallelujah remember God is a gentleman he doesn't enforce anything upon you you may even say I don't understand I don't even understand why Cain Cain was told by God you don't even need to understand why it was blood just do like your brother did you'll be accepted that that's what God told them you go read Genesis 4 just do like your brother did and you'll be accepted and so it's very simple you see people who are rejoicing good times and bad times and they're victorious life and they've pushed through and they're happy and why is that they've been accepted remember Jesus was accepted in Iran on our behalf we always need to accept him the person Jesus Christ hallelujah and so now you see others have been accepted they say just do like your brother done just do like your sister then you'll be accepted Cain was given an opportunity you say well are you calling me a cane or a niece or well you may be but you don't have to stay in that condition that was under the blood of bulls and goats their nature could never be changed that way but under the blood of Jesus Christ there's a power prison in this room right now that he can change you from a nice order or a cane amen he can change you from them the son or daughter of God he can I've seen it happen too much first Peter 13 wherefore gird up your loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to reboard unto you by the at the revelation of Jesus Christ we're living in that hour as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts and your ignorance but as he saw first Peter 1 and 15 now but as he which has called you as holy so be holy in all manner of conversation because it has written be holy for I am holy and if you call on the father who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work past the time of your sojourning here and fear for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things we ought to think about what redeemed us it wasn't the blood of a juror of Gentiles the blood of God himself God Himself became your sacrifice hallelujah the varying his name shall be called Emmanuel God with us Amen God salvation was manifested in a man I mean to bear our infirmities amen to take our whooping to take our judgment I mean the reason the cross was such a severe penalty I mean it's because that was the penalty God required for sin to be done away with amen he was mad beyond any man beyond any man he was mad and he and there was the joy of sit before him I'm willing to take these beatings I'm willing to be scourged I'm willing for a crown of thorns be put on my head and they poisoned from my stones were into his hidden sand and caused it to puff up I'm willing for my bed to be ripped out to be spit on to be mocked to be rejected to die with a broken heart because it's worth it to redeem them hallelujah there wasn't a small thing it wasn't a small thing to be done and he win as a sinner he he went to hell as a center in your place amen yeah it's not a small thing oh my we should be the happiest people in all the world for as much as you know that you're not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your father's but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish blemish and without spot who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifested in these last times for you I mean the son of man has been revealed in the cellar who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your hope so that your faith and hope might be in God at least he says so past the time of your sojourning here in fear and then Paul even says that you know he walks he lives in such a way that's so he doesn't become a shipwreck like others so even Paul himself it yo he had the revelation he had a dispensation of the gospel most the New Testament was written by this man but he didn't just wait on through he knew what it mean he knew what the grace of God really was he says I want to live a live a life in such a way that I do not become a shipwreck I like other people this was Paul's attitude amen and we're being restored back to the gospel that Paul preached howl ooh yeah amen now let's go to Philippians 2 I believe it is it says wherefore my beloved we'll just turn we've got to take it serious you know let's not just wait on through cuz it's tradition well this is what we've been doing for a few years now no let's let's take it I'm more thankful for the grace of God I'm more thankful for him calling me now that I was 10 years ago I'm more thankful I ask of my heart Lord keep me keep me when I just say a simple prayer that girls in the morning Lord we give our lives to you keep us every day I mean it with all my heart I say Lord we surrender our wills we don't want our own will any more I don't want to speak of me how do you know Jesus said I come to do only my father's will so how do you know you're redeemed you no longer want your own will who's redeemed and maybe you trust the question well if you still want to do your own will you should say God redeem me Ephesians 2 and 12 wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed not as much as my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure so that's it is actually so you got to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling and for it's God's it's God which worketh in you both to will end do it as good play it's God working but you can't just take it casual well if I'm bright are bright if I'm not bright I'm not bright if I'm not bright I'll be fullest version of I'm fullest version I'll go white throne judgment and if I grow the white throne judgment I'll get mercy I wouldn't ever want to that's it's like a suicide machine you're never you never we should never have that kind of you know that's just unbelief speaking if you lean too much for if I'm in are moving from outer mount no as I seen a few wind days it you know your Wednesday's ago about here's the Ark and we know the rain fell before the monkey here before the animals are going home but just imagine the animals are going up just say you're a chimpanzee or a monkey and you're going up the ramp and there's a male and female monkey ahead of you of your same species and you're the third one what are you gonna do are you gonna say well I guess I wasn't ordained to go on the ark and you just die perish with the rest of the world or are you gonna are you gonna push the other one off the ramp and get in what's your attitude what do you want to be because faith would say no it's my promise faith and say no I belong in that Ark I must be in that ugh I'm more danger be in that oh and you will push you on off the red you say well that's not nice to the other one but you talk about your own eternal destination amen so or do you say well I guess I'm just not ordained to be in there what do you want to be if I'm the third monkey on the ramp I'm not gonna stay the third monkey I'm gonna be the one offs first or second monkey because the first or second monkey have a place you gotta think what do you want to be say well I guess I'm not ordained no how do you know that that's the devil lying to you yes that's a devil oh you haven't responded yet that's the devil lying to you he's lying to you because he doesn't want you to accept what you have your eternal life because when you begin to really say no this is my promise and I don't care what others think I don't even care what I think oh my god I'm gonna take you at your word and I'm gonna live according to your word because I love you so my heart and you died on the cross for me I don't care about anyone then the Devils in trouble it goes that because that slave muscle that's been beating you down with reasoning and good eye things that be seemingly good to Aqaba mind then he goes under your feet I want to trade on the devil the Bible said I'm going to trade on the young one and the Ender and the dragon so I said god I want a manifest that scripture that's my scripture I mean I don't want to be beating around and just go with the tide and all this is this and this is listen if one you know let's let's press into the kingdom the violent take the kingdom by force it doesn't mean you get a whipping and you and you invade that way but the violence god I want it I don't want to be lukewarm and just lie back and but Lord hears your promise I want to press into the kingdom hallelujah we can do it the reason I'm saying this thing is because we can do it well what do you want to be because God gave you a free will even Cain would have received eternal life you know that as he was willing to soar into his will to God's will he would have seen actually that's why I sacrificed I want to be accepted one of your lambs and because I was manifesting God because there's only a few of us well how do you receive it he rejected truth and he came against the ones who had the truth and then he was sealed to his eternal doom and he was sent out from the presence of God and that's what happened to him and God doesn't change a man doesn't change but if he was willing to surrender his will we would see him one day in heaven but he wasn't willing to give it over as pride pride manifests in a lot of ways he's too proud too proud to Humble himself to the word in his hour how about you how about you you say well what's the flip side of all this thing the flip side is if God has given us access to eternal life you know think about it in the book of Genesis I believe it's four it says the cherubim was was put there to protect you go read the words away then tree of life is Jesus Christ so here's these cherubim self and this do they still cherubim are still protecting this word and Matthew 28:19 baptized the name of Father Son Holy Ghost which is the Lord Jesus Christ brother his debt is a gospel god that's a chairman particular way the life is always what's your business doing here I want eternal life you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the full Europe even die you must be born again going to give you a whole heart everything you are you say that's awfully harsh no God we are not the top of the food chain yes we are not the top of the food chain God is the top of the food chain and God is sovereign God chooses who he will he calls who he will be justify so he will hear he Dean's who he will he condemns who he will but God doesn't condemn someone without giving them warning he doesn't he doesn't he's not going to cast anyone into hell just be just just no reason whatsoever yo come a point just like the rich young ruler he'll come before the throne and that and when this one was standing in front of them one thing now let's tell all that you have give to the poor take up your cross and follow me you'll have treasures in heaven that conversation will come back to his mind and also the feeling he had walking away said we'll come back to his mind and that will be unfortunately his own condemnation well his own actions condemn them unfortunately but that's how it is because God gives your choice so now if that's the case and you've come and gods allowed you in God allowed you in one day on my knees I meet my when you really died out hallelujah I was sitting I was I was listening to brother Branham I was in university drinking and doing all these things God delivered me of the alcohol and everything one day I was studying organic chemistry in the science library at Canterbury University and that's just this just out of nowhere just as this conviction came upon me and God said to me he said if you died right right now without the Holy Ghost you'd be lost it's just how the conviction came on me I don't know where but God has been dealing with me for quite a while I pack up all my books I go I go back to my house I lay it all down and then after that the Bible became a new book God filled by love with us Hardy did many things but I believe was true what if I just did not convenient for me would I be here I believe by God's mercy and grace because he knew me before the foundation of the world I wouldn't be here but what if not to me I know I'm produced no because he's transformed my life push you to make sure you actually have what you believe you have and then we can't just wait on sin and say but I'm the bride your life will prove what you are I'm gonna read this one more thing as I know it's late there's in the sixth seal and I think it ought to be truly settled in every believers heart and this that this church never takes the tribulation period you cannot put nowhere the church in the tribulation oh you can put the church there but not the bride see the bride goes on because she's got not one sin not a thing against her the grace of God has covered her over and the bleach has took every sin so far away there's not even a room Aaron saw it not a thing but purity perfect in the presence of God oh it ought to make the bride get down on her knees and cry out to God hallelujah for us to really do you really recognize that you possum get the life do you really know that God has allowed you and here's a chair you gave you all over I'll let you in and we can't go to the Great Tribulation the bride comes I mean I pray that your life is proving that today I mean I've passed from death to life my fiction to sit on things above amen and I don't just talk about it it lives I'll be made a new creature in him hallelujah cui have some musicians to come they say well I don't know if I have that yet he will give you the answer amen he said I'm hungry and thirsting well don't just reset hungry and thirsty say thank you Lord on bless because a hunger and thirst and your voice is I shall be filled and just thank him we have been given access to eternal life God is not a respecter of persons just say that's like just say oh there's division or whatever God is gonna deal with it he's not a respect oh they can be they can be a little bit this way there's okay now God will God will deal with it you know the devil doesn't like us being happy the devil doesn't like a sting of one accord the battle has only just started we can't be a respecter of persons this is not a popularity contest we all love each other so we're all the evil equal playing field anyway but you got to go beyond that that's how the devil worked in the guy I'm yo-yo up in heaven well he's a great anointed cherub that covereth respect pride a nickel he was found in his heart they say no he knows what he's talking about and they placed his word above God's Word and then those angels fell and he fell and pride comes before the fall amen let's stand shall we we had that song all that I am all that I have ever I wish to be cannot repay this love did I oh ok don't worry let's just um let's just sing that song Jesus all for Jesus all my ambitions hopes and plans I soar into these tours hands I trust you've really done that and if you haven't why don't you do it now you don't need someone yo-yos like brother Billy Paul lying there in the hospital if you want prayer you're welcome to come forward for prayer but God's dealing with brother Billy Paul in the hospital and he and his dad and no sisters dad pray for me dead and if there's no you did the sitting you do the frame you gotta talk to him yourself you gotta you gotta settle the account yourself and I wouldn't you know brother Aaron speaks of a lady that comes to comes to him you God's called me to go this and do this and do this and brother Brahim see it well have you received the Holy Ghost no but I'm but I'm by God's dealing with me about it and brother ham says she did everything but do what she should have done which was meet God for herself first and people get all religious they want to do all these different kind of things but have they been born again you know and we run around and sometimes but have you really come to the issue have you passed from death to life let's just sing this Jesus or Jesus lead the way let's just go that please let's just go the next verse next one all of my ambitions hopes and plans I surrender these into your hands so everything that I am I no longer want my own will none of my will thy will be done on earth as in heaven but if you say actually part of your will and part of my will you can end up with the disappointment of the judgement amen but if you're truly surrendered to him then he'll take care of you hallelujah let's go the first verse all for Jesus all I and half and ever hope to be Jesus
