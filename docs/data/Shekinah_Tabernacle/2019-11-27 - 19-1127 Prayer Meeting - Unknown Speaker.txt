to look at chapter 2 from verse 25 amen are we older if we founded you can just say Amen the Bible says and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolidation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord the Lord's Christ verse 27 and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then took him up in his arms and blessed God and said Lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy weight verse 34 mine eyes have seen thy salvation let us pray together if there's a need in your heart and can just lift up your hands

service in your hands in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen we can enjoy the comfort of our seats while I remain standing amen god bless you Caleb I trust this thing works that's right amen I am not a I'm not that much of a preacher myself as you all know so if you maybe hear something tonight that is not so agreeable with you and on the Prophet taught us that if you eating meat any fan that is a bone you don't throw the whole plate of meat isn't it you throw only the bones and you eat the meat isn't it so if you find that tonight that maybe there's a little bone that I say don't throw the whole plate just understand that as I told you I'm not a preacher I mean I want us to speak tonight for a short few minutes about the message called expectation I mean the Prophet taught that message about oh but over 10 times amen sometimes he was calling it expectancy sometimes was calling it expectation and something in the leading sometimes you just call it expectation amen so I trust that this evening you are under expectation because it's not broad impor and employs just like a cell phone that is being used tonight you are talking to somebody in Australia but that person is not inside your phone he's in Australia but you are using some form of a device to connect so that you can hear that person that's what I am tonight you see so it gets all the cell phone you buy a new one that's what is a freaking I don't know I've never seen it there is a spare wheel of a car that is that is not all like this you know they even right there that that spare wheel when you put it on don't drive more than 80 kilometers and now you drive only eight max so tonight just an eight with me because the main wheels at the big day and then what bless you richly amen let's come back to the service expectation is what we are going to speak about tonight but before we speak about expectation we have read the scripture now this scripture tells us about him main course immune this man called Simeon he lived in the temple the Prophet says amen and it has been many many if you take on my bed too old ancient Israel it has been many centuries they essentially hundred years I was asked if I thought my family on the road what is the century because I didn't want to confuse essentially and a decade millennium is a thousand years so it has been many many centuries that the nation of Israel has been waiting for the Messiah to come it has been many years and then this man called Simeon he was living at the time of the great expectation but the point with this man about him is that he was under great expectation the Bible says he had the baptism of the Holy Spirit amen he the Bible says that he was filled with the Holy Spirit right and then him the Spirit spoke to him and told him that or he will let me put it that way it revealed to him huh it revealed him is not an angel that came to you know not vision did he see the Bible says the Holy Spirit revealed to him that he's not going to die before he see the birth of the Messiah so that's what the revelation of the Holy Spirit told simu how he together and therefore therefore he was under great expectation you believed the Word of God he was under anticipation that is why if you go to we'll come back to this scripture but let me just show you something that the word s that expectation comes from the word expect expectation is a noun right for those who in Lisbon is there now expectation it comes from the word expect so to expect is to is an act or a state of Lu you forward towards something you see you you anticipate something to happen you are looking forward we anticipation that something is going to happen or you're going to get something is an act or a state of expecting in other words they say in I went to the dictionary and upon that it comes from the width called expect re at the bottom here can I point this yeah it comes from the expect re is the Latin word with rate of two ways this expectation X which means out state are a means to look so in foolish expected meaning look out for so expectation is that you are looking for what for something to happen or to get or whatever but there's an expectation we all together we understand the real expectation now we find that that the expectation goes hand-in-hand with faith the Prophet says expectation it usually works together with faith in other words you you is a process it's an action that happens as a result of your faith it's an action that happens whether visible or not visible we agree that subjects are not visible all right some actions are happening in your mind is an action it's an activity it's happening in your mind or in your heart you believe God by faith faith is a substance right so there's an activity there's an action there's something happening in the spiritual or physical you can see me I'm doing something right for something to happen so faith is something that happens inside you but there's an expectation for something to happen out of that faith I will together so I'm saying here that it can either be it can have the downside expectation can have the downside if you left the downside or the upside let me give an example you you you can expect someone to die huh you can expect something bad to happen you can you can you can expect not to find something face on your face right or based on one you know that this is effect so you you don't expect it to happen now I don't expect them to come because they were here last week can you see so that's not really positive but the point of the matter is that there is an expectation of something to happen it doesn't matter we site you are but you you you you you expect whether tonight they expect you to hear from God or you here only what is that you everybody expecting something to happen I meant sodium I sound like you teach yourself and so that's why when I said then I expected I expect a response event so I thought you expect something to happen or respect something not to happen but you are and the expectation believe it or not amen so now and if we just continue a little bit we go to the next slide so I never really priest with a slide we spoke about this man Simeon the Prophet says this man Simeon he was not afraid he was not afraid to express his expectation because the what is pretty revealed it to him he was not afraid to declare his expectation we sing a beautiful song I'm no longer the slave to feel we are not Simeon was not under fear he was declaring to the people what the Spirit has told him he was convinced he was fully 110 percent expectation that he is not going to die can you imagine let's just practical eyes it we hear of many miracles in the Bible and angel come we hear about things that happens we hear about miracles and things but if San Simeon was exactly like us today ask me how he was like us because he may never saw any angel he never saw a miracle the Holy Spirit was upon him and the Holy Spirit today is upon who you the volunteers upon you today that means that the expectation of Simeon must be on me in you this evening because Simeon only had the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit the Bible says it revealed to you you the word was revealed to you right in so many ways sometimes maybe even more than Simeon because we have seen miracles to consolidate but Simeon he only got the Holy Spirit anointing just like we have today do you believe me for the Holy Spirit so the Holy Spirit reveals to you that something is going to come Jesus Christ is going to come and fetch us so we must be under great expectation because Simeon was in the same boat with us amen Jonah he he was expecting to see a he was an old man the Bible says you see when you read the Bible slowly you pick up these things he says that he was not going to die before he sees that the Christ the bone crimes but he was an old man the Prophet says any for any reason or anyone will expect you to die anytime but the Holy Spirit said is not going to die so any he was he was sure that he's not going to die before you sees the Christ now when God says something it must happen that's effect so this is just to help you out in case expectation is on the low side god it's not a question of debate or anything god it's got no element of fail I need you the point about this is that why I'm saying this is just to help you and me and by the way everything that I say I'm also directing it to myself so I'm preaching to myself the God never fails everything that he says will happen so that is clear is like when you are paging a book yet we are done that chapter it's not whether God so we're gonna happen or he's at it that's the effect the issue that is remaining is between you and me about whether we believe what God said is going to happen or not because God does not lie so the Prophet says when God says something it must happen this need not raise I'm supposed to sorry when God says something it must happen this need to raise your positive attitude in us this needs to raise the positive attitude in us because when God said something we know we are sure that God is the one who created the heavens and the earth from his words we know that God we know those things so when we hear that God said something ours what is left it's just for us to to find a positive attitude towards what God said so that the promise of God can happen because God never fails what he said it will happen regardless whether we believe it or we don't so it is up to us now to fight to line up with what God had said you see because what he said it will come to happen isn't it analyst it's true my game so now now we find that there for example I say then let's just expand a little bit to this word expectation if you if you lose something in the house something very important something precious something that as they always say it means life or death huh and you lose that thing in the house you can't find it very serious commodity that you need to pass and you must find it within a specific time let's just say there's a deadline you know that this thing last week you have put it somewhere in the house but you can't find it you know what you think you you give me to bring a prayer request to change for the believers to pray with you because you are under expectation you believe that if we pray this item will be found right we believe that if you ask the brothers to group together with you in prayer and we put our faith to this item will be found right now you you look with a great expectation to find this item and I wrote there not to find remember I told you it just got some people when we done they loop or when they they find they want to find something they don't expect positive outcome it can happen like I've explained earlier on that but we are on the positive side the message that I want to bring to you on the positive side itself to show you that be careful of the negative side of them not find you because we are not there that's not for us now expectation you look by faith not by doubt right you you you go that because you know that this thing that I'm looking for it is there the existence of this thing that we are looking for is not questionable it's not whether it exists or not exist we know is day it's an item that you put it somewhere but you can't find it we are going to look for it with great great seriousness and persistence and you are going to be persevere and you are going to persist to look for it why are you doing that because you are and the expectation to find this item because you know that is there right your point to say no no come help me you're going to to talk to people in your house and then please help me find this item right let's say is your passport and you're going to check out and your body to book them flats sorry word for beat but the point that I want to illustrate is that coupe you can't find this Passport and you must travel so and you know that last week you've just put it here on your bedside but you can't find it now you're going to go with a great expectation with the old house will be 10 ups upside down yeah that's how we say don't look for that password because you know that it is day right now you you'll ask anyone in the house you talk to anyone and then ask people even from outside Lausanne you come in tell the believers I must find a passport yeah and you're looking for it why are you so persistent when you can't find it where you put it if you don't find it there where you put it why can't you just leave and say no well I put it is not this the children all of them no one said they saw it why can't you just give up because you are driven by your faith you are driven by your expectations so that is why you go all out to go look for the passport to find it because you know that you have put it some way I mean so now you you can't be under spectating and do nothing are we together the person who is under spectating tells the house upside down expectation EU works because he knows that there is a place called Stokes Valley let's say you're driving from Wellington and they say there's no more place there is not a place called Stokes baby but you know that you've checked it on the map you know that we have had your friends telling you that this Stokes very and you know driving day you not gonna listen to that person you are going to drive and once the way you're going to get maybe if you get lost you're going to ten and if anyone to get to Stokes baby because you are under expectation to arrive in Stokes baby because you know Stokes really exists so now you will use your you do something when you are unexpected you know you want you know and expect things to happen but yet you call yourself the person whose and expectation so that means that if you do that and you do nothing and you are telling me or us that your and expectation you are lying to us because you are not because the person who's unexpected you we seem by doing something we seem by acting to us getting what he wants if you do nothing you are demonstrating that you don't have expectation and by extension because we said is an act of faith the level of faith is questionable can you see what I'm trying to say so we must be under great expectation we in other ways we must pray to God to help us to give us faith so that our expectation can run because believe what the heart expectation the higher there is the reward that you receive amen the higher expectation the higher the reward so if we expect what God will give you what because your faith will be higher all right you get results wisely you know Gentiva results quickly not quickly all the time but you will get them for sure I mean so you expect but otherwise you are not under spectating if you don't act I mean so what what do you do you illustrate by doing something when your hand expectation you don't see it you look you check you look for that passport you look for that what you have your ask you going to give you a men so now if we can just continue the end now I want to read for you what the Prophet says this he says you had about the lady that played for the mountain to be moved and then when he played for the mountain to be moved wait am i you heard about the lady then pray for the mountain to be moved and got up the next morning and looked out of the window and said just as expected the mountain is still expected that's right now you want to have an expectation all the way from heart soul body and mind that God is going to give you to give us a great outpouring of the Holy Spirit you see this woman pray that God can move the mountain he the one who asked God no one else Hey but he didn't expect that the mountain that's the problem you see so when you pray for God to give you something when you ask for God to give you something you and me must be an expectation because it does not help what is not listening to your player from the mouth looking at the heart what do you say you're asking for something and yet you are not anything but if you're an expectation that's what God responds to because you I expect you've got to give you in fact in the morning you may not even wake up to go to the window because you know the mountain is gone you know God has moved the mountain your only one - yet you're done can you say mama I know I know the mountain is gone I know the one who prayed for it expectations that's what expectation talks about it talks about faith it is emanates from phases an activity is one of the actions that shows that you believe what you have requested that God will give you - the promises now you want to have expectation oh the way you want with you now you want to have an expectation of all the way and this is what excites me very much this red this red highlighted this one this one this one in this one you need to expect God that God will do something for you from your heart your soul is our body and your mind meaning that every fiber of your body you must be expecting that God is going to do something in other words you you know when when we baptize people who run baptize them and hand is left outside no we baptize them food if we mess them food way from top from top to head from head to toe Fuli so you must be believing God you must be under fixation from your heart your body your soul and your mind everything otherwise think about this think about if you have an expectation and then your only expectation with just your mind right what will happen oh I don't know if you can believe or expect just from your soul I don't know it is possible but the point I'm trying to show you is that Tecna bottom you only believe just with one part on the physical side that's what more normally we see on them on their own their own their own their spiritual on their own the spirit side you are just imagining you say I believe you know you've got what you call mental faith ah not from your heart so how is God going to help you because the Prophet here the men of God said all the way everything am i right so that's what we need to do we need to believe God all the way and then let's continue and see what I what I said here another quotation yes another quotation that I had there for you from 1950 April he says the Prophet that then we always get what we expect very fundamental that's very very important because what I'm saying is fundamental yes ABC of this distort do not go and extend or not expect but expect to get do you get my point don't go out an extent but not expecting anyone get what I'm trying to say so don't expect God to give you something but you're not really expecting you another was being in doubt not fully being a mess not billing you from your heart mind soul and body but confessing not oh I've got you who have to confess but that should filter through right through the whole system of your body amen you need to believe God we we always get what we expect when people expect anything well then they usually get what you look for it is it is a mental attitude that you have that the Prophet says that our mental attitude determines or is laid health to believe to get what we are expecting from God our mental setup remember remember that this and never forget it remember this and never forgetting the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass right the right mental attitude toward God's promise to bring it to pass so that's why you believe you you expect from your mind from your soul from your everything about you all right then you use your your positive to us what you are talking about towards what do you believe Amen you I'll be together so I'm trying to say to you that your level of expectation will determine you a way of your attitude will get your mind how you're going to believe God's will it's going to determine how your faith is going to be to as well as what respect you from God amen that is why Paul says that in the book of Romans that for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the ls expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God if you listen to the word expectation you will pick up that the word expectation inside it has got a weight that man called Simeon that we spoke about he was waiting he was under great expectation he was looking forward for something to happen Frank and then he was waiting for the Messiah to come and that is why here Paul contends that any sense that then the creature that for the manifestation of the sons of God this is a grace is an NS expectation and NS and it means that who can give me a simplistic explanation open-ended you know when we say something's and NS it means that it has been is that upfront deposit you see so our expectation because it emanates from faith right and paint is a substance and a substance is something is tangible in my life and substances are something that you can touch that you can move so the endless of hearts petition is that a deposit what is already being update upfront halfway through and then so that is what we polish talking about you also in the book of Philippians he he says for I know for I know that beasts shall tend to my salvation through your prayer and my son and the supply of the spirit of Jesus Christ I know but this is talking about expectation amen according to according to my expectation and my hope that in in nothing I shall be ashamed but that in all boldness in all boldness has always shown so now also the Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be in life or by death so my phone is blow do certain things in yes I keep on looking them so Paul is trying to demonstrate our expectation in what is expecting is trying to show you to confirm what the Prophet says that our expectation is already an upfront payment there's already an upfront payment of our expectations so now we are we've got no reason not to expects that God will give us we've got no reason to not expect that God will come in for no reason at all with what no reason not to expect that when you come to change despite the path of who is preaching that God can talk to you man beyond expectation because you are not going to see a minister you're going to hear God and you pray that God can use the vessel for your benefit you receive what God what you are pray from what to give the Bible says God can raise stones to preach the gospel and a God can make a donkey to talk and you see the angel better than me and you so how much about you and daughter and the son of God a wife of God how much about you so the question is that it is not of God because God already said in his word that we're two or three I get that I will be in their Messiah that in my name he already said that and I will be in your midst he already said if you ask me I will give you the already that all those promises the issue is just for me and for you to pray that God please come and fulfill your weight I am ready so now you ain't got meat follow him from from Sunday's message in conclusion okay before we go there I picked up this Psalm 24 and the thought about the Sun Sun Sun body - sorry 742 is why it talks about the deep end the deep : today that means that what is trying to say is that as the Prophet was it that for a fish to exist there must be water for Ritu's to swim for a fish to have a fin before there could be a pin on a piece you know a pin of the fish before it can be there on the fish for it to swim there must be water somewhere there must be a corresponding environment or setting for a fish to be able to swim how is this relevant what we are talking about today if you can find that you've got a desire in your heart and you find out what they need or you find that you put your yearning for something which mister something somewhere that God wants to give you the only thing that is there for you to do is to believe God because that's already responding a response for you otherwise there was not going to be any desire from your heart why would God allow you desire why would the Holy Spirit promise you something why would God say I'll give it all in spirit and you feel I want this real feeling of this place you can feel it you can feel it better you can hate ah from yourself you can hate and now why would God put it there what is the reason for God to put things in your heart because there's already an answer I just provided for you there was a reason why God will create a fish because he already made no provision for the fish to swim I know I've God was not going to make the fish spin fish we're going to have Pete's walk because they couldn't assume can you understand what I'm practicing so now I'm sorry Caleb if you have a desire that's what I was trying to say now for something tonight there must be a fountain of that in some way otherwise there will be no desire in your heart right we know now that sorry to the Judah was again my brothers are going to fly and sisters to fly to Nigeria to go visit their families now they are under great expectation why because it's a pike waiting ha there's people waiting that side they also could have a cross posting desire to meet them their content is that so there's a dip college and to that tip so you can the carpool flies end up going to go but now they are just waiting and they're not excited that there's nothing good in the expectation they can tell him that no but flight is cancelled that flight that you couldn't fly god forbid is canceled telling me prathana and the family they are not going to put their base down I can assure you that won't were the airport is the one is gonna fly rota under a station [Music] this must raise our level of expectation tonight if God said something I mean what never lie if God's if we all agree with one point that when God says something it will happen then this master raise our level of expectation because it means that God said something I've got a desire for that to receive that thing so what is left what is left for me to receive what is left is that if I pilla I'm not getting to answer I must pray to God to give me more expectation dude I like what you said last week is that if you don't have that it then I've got to give you how many rating if you don't have because the Word of God said ask anything and sometimes the devil seeks us behind this with anything we think anything is not anything he is like an open check just the hacker I've gotten you that you want you didn't ask for something awkward because you've got the Spirit of God in you so God knows when he says to you ask anything that we are going to ask for anything within the bounds of the Holy Spirit with this the boundaries of heaven that's not of God won't ask that no God give me those what can I give an example and sound of God one asks for something evil he won't ask for something and scriptural you ask for something that we do according to your spirit is inside you so that is why is that ask for anything because he knows that you are going to ask for something within the and anything means anything prison for example and when I do get brother James I don't understand him you know sometimes the devil can make you just to forget then you can ask God that you don't have to join what are you waiting for because you're he already said to you ask anything you feel that you you anything you know anything anything simply means anything you you think that and God cannot give you anything as he said the problem we are going to end up limiting God we are going to end up taking anything and cut it and reduce it not to be anything because he said anything ask for it so you go before God and ask about anything and from there heaven expectation it doesn't matter how is going to take God is going to give it to you amen so that should raise our level of expectation amen on that think you know that of the Sunday sermon upon the been preached you see he I hate him this way maybe you hate him differently but what you are saying is that for God to help you you must do something for God to be able to raise Lazarus and call him Marian Martha had to roll a stone you need to rolled a stone right to show that you are an expectation otherwise time you would have said no no no no no everyone not everyone a second you yourself you know that resurrection is coming at the end I was going to prove that they are not and expectation even if he tells them I am the resurrection and life that would demonstrate to them the level of faith but they start remote we know resurrection is going to come at the end time he said to them I am the resurrection and meaning that I'll can deselect him now therefore on a stone what they did their openness to because they knew that what is this it must happen immediately when you said that I believe that their level of expectation winner immediately and the promises of God our level of expectation must shoot our anticipation is for our the moment you you you here you feel a desire for something in your heart don't suppress it instead have your expectation to go Aven may God bless us amen in conclusion as I've said that they our ultimate goal is to have the positive faith based positive what did I say our ultimate goal is to have a positive and a faith-based expectation that's what I wanted to see so we need the support that I have for you tonight the whole idea is that whenever we ask or something whatever God has promised in fact we must ask for God to raise needs for us in our hearts so that we can be able to ask him so that sometimes the devil hides your needs he hide the things that you need so that you cannot recognize because you know that this was if I show you he's going to ask good and God is going to give you so as forgot to expose them you know that I can ultimate goal to have a positive mental attitude mental way of looking at God's Way faith-based expectation that's what we need to have this evening now we we read that Scripture right any alone I said I'll come back to it so Matthew 22 says Jesus said unto Him it was a loyal soldier suspicious it was a loyal asking sister ask him that the Lord Jesus Christ about tempting you about about the law because you see alone and he was asking you which one is the greatest law and the Lord gave me a direct answer but I pick up something in that answer and this links up with what the Prophet said in that message earlier on that I read for you remember when you said when you expect when you do something you must expect with your mind when you ask God some you must expect with your soul your mind everything about you amen he says to this man jesus said unto him thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all their mind now in closing this is very key for me I love this scripture my families is I'm sure they're getting annoyed with me because I always read this one most of the time lately because it has got key things for me we know how are you so treasures three circles that I like very much the soul the spirit and then let's just put it I know I know I know those are not directly those ones I know those are not direct to do this but just let's look at them heart soul and mind and think of them huh and think of these three circles that makes a human being so he says the key word here is this one this one love the Lord your God with your heart your soul and your mind with your soul with your spirit we your flesh everything of you love you why did you not say to them to that man why didn't the Lord when he gave Moses that lo why wasn't the best law about respecting the Lord your God with all your mind why love and can you see what I'm trying to get God is love the Bible says God is love God is divine love therefore to come to him you have to come through the way of love but it's why we are the bride of the Lord Jesus we come through the way of love and it you cannot love God halfway through whatever measurement you want to boot you have to love him with everything within you so that your expectation can rise so not everything that you as you can get you have to love you God couldn't say he didn't say but the greatest commandment is to love your God with all your heart could upset no worship the Lord your God that's the first commandment no I didn't say that the first law that he put not even a proposition not even a you may do it is a commandment it's like when we do put watching and communion that thing is an ordinance is something that we've got no choice we have to do it this we must baptize you you know certain things we can say it legal are that one get those check that check they do it this church will do it you know those are not things that God commanded is according to how the Lord has revealed it to you maybe how the Prophet set it and everything you know but this is hello with all you had your soul and your mind so I'm saying to you I'm putting the other wisdom with all your soul with all your spirit and with all your flesh outside face everything about you reflect must him about God must love lob amen so now you see but when you love you you are taking a different picture the expectation is not a problem to happen anything that
