TRANSCRIPT
========================================
great thing the problem with it is is that people create one little great thing but that one little great thing that's got to work with all the other great things that have been invented and say with technologies like that people create small components and you get another component that's got to work with that and then if you've got three that's gotta live with it and that and then that net-net and it's all got to work together but it never does it's always like this one doesn't like that one if this one has a little sitting it messes with that one it's all it's kind of like an unconverted people you know they're always just he's all fusses and arguing and complaining but you see God's creation he made this one with that one in mind and with that one of mine with that one and that one and that one has his creation of the the universe it all works together perfectly he made the whole lot but let's see if one person made the whole all the technology and decided that's how they wanted to do it it would be fun but it's not because that's the way men is we just find out beings we're not we're clever but we're not it's clever as God and yeah but that would be good when we don't need all the technology stuff it's not yeah it's a good aid but it's a means to an end let some stand this morning and thank the Lord for being here and just coming out on to him Heavenly Father were so grateful Lord that we can just be a part of the wonderful creation that you've made Lord is David often pondered it Lord and he looked out at the universe and all the things Lord the works of your hands and he started to think lord of how that you know his thoughts are far off Lord that you just know all things and Lord he got to the point where he said such knowledge is just too much for me to comprehend I can't understand it Lord and it was so grateful that we can be who you created us Lord and just come as as beings that have the ability to worship you lord have the ability to appreciate

felt your presence Lord may it be tonight I just pray heavier way and take control of this meeting and ask and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated thank you well praise the Lord I had a wonderful day I really enjoyed the meeting this morning really good message and I thought it started to get better and better as it went along and there's a lot of little things which were said which maybe you called it or maybe it didn't but it was very profound and you know sometimes when you speak about the things of God the things which come out and you don't even know about it that's the things the Lord wants to emphasize on and tonight it's a communion and you know once you've had communion a few thousand times a few hundred times or how many times it appears to be the same thing every time but it's new every time and I like to look at it from a slightly different angle tonight but to begin with I still want to read just a passage in 1st Corinthians 11:23 234 about the communion and then we talk about one or two things here it says here for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take heed this is my body which is broken for you this doing the remembrance of me after the same manner he also took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as he drink it in remembrance of me for as often as he eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup oh sorry drink of this cup of the Lord no I got mixed up I start again wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if you we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that he come not together unto condemnation and the rest will has said in order when I come that is what we read every time we have communion and you know it's very interesting I have experienced it myself some people have different understandings of what communion means or what it does Woodhead commune in awhile ago and two brothers stood be didn't take communion because the heart wasn't right somewhere I know I said look let's pray ask the Lord to forgive you cleanse you put your hearts right and then their communion you say communion is not salvation communion is to remember the Lord and I like to read I've got three quotes written out which I like to read just a general understanding about communion his communion does not pertain to salvation communion does not give you salvation whether you take it in your death or what it does not have anything to do with your salvation it is a commemoration jesus said in the gospel he said this do in remembrance of me not in learning or leaning or pointing to salvation but in but it's in commemoration of a finished work that's been done in you by the Holy Spirit I love this it's a commemoration now there's many to take the communion they're not saved many eat the Paschal Lamb and perish in the wilderness and many take the communion today that will never see God I hope not here tonight but you cannot be a partaker of his salvation and not see him because salvation is a gift of God and communion is commemoration of the great all-sufficient sacrifice that was made for that salvation it's so to let people see that we believe in the death burial and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ it represents a finished work I think that gives you so much peace and rest well you know it's a finished work and so many times we we get trapped into thinking now we have to just finish it properly so there is a work to do but the work of Christ is finished like we read this morning we were perfected in heaven perfected so we we have a perfection an earthly perfection we tried to grow and and and come to a full understanding but in Christ we are perfected so communion we testify of that just we testify of it I'll give you another one here but in the offering of the shewbread that was laying on the kasha plate in the jewish sacrifice at the cleansing of the Tabernacles ask any Jew on those three pieces of bread the middle piece was broken there was Christ it's representing Christ the middle piece was broken Christ in the in-between showed that there had to be a breaking somewhere for redemption and their piece was considered Redemption and the caution on the kosher bread and here he is and tonight when we take the communion we break the cost bread for it's the body of Christ and he was broken to Calvary to be a propitiation for our sins that through his righteousness we might become his righteousness because he became our sin that we might become his righteousness brother that's purely grace absolutely there's no way any other way you could justify that's a scripture he became my sin so I will become his righteousness well what an exchange or an exchange you give him your misery and you give him give you your righteousness why because you believe in him I have many times in my early Christian days arguments with people especially with my mother and as a mother I say what the Bible says you say what do you think so I said what the Bible said that makes me right and you wrong what are your faith in Jesus Christ you become part of him and then you become what the word says it's not that we have to achieve something we already have it it's a free gift you know a gift a gift is something you cannot demand some people demand Lord I want this gift to soothe you to do this there was one in the Bible I want a gift so I lay hands on other people to get the Holy Ghost I want that gift too and I think it was Peters through him blind or whatever you know it was he called him the child of the devil yeah we can't demand gift we can ask for gifts but we cannot demand it or buy it or it's a gift and salvation is a gift or we can is accepted is it if it's offered to you if it's not offered to you you can't claim it you can't say yeah it's a gift Lord I like this gift and he says to you I've done it for you and then you say thank you Lord and then you receive it and then you have faith in what he's done for you and then you become righteous you become holy you become glorious like the scripture says nothing to do with our effort not at all give you one more here there's not many of us and we'll take the communion it is not closed a closed communion it is absolutely for every Christian believer God doesn't have the line drawn between Baptists and Methodists and so forth we all we are all by one spirit baptized into one body and we are fellow citizens of the kingdom of God and if there be someone among us who's strange I'm not here to and don't know who is members and who is not remember no matter what church you belonged to that has nothing to do with it there's only one church anyhow and you don't join it you born into it that's right then and you born into the this Church of God and we pray that you receive Christ tonight commune with him as we remember his broken body and these and these little elements that we take of the Passover and may God sprinkle our hearts and conscience with the blood so it is a body we are born into born into you know people talk about denominations you're the word denomination it has a common denominator that makes a denomination a common denominator and what's a common denominator of the Church of the Living God it to be born of the Spirit of God some people say they make a common denominator because they belong to a certain church or I'm in a message this is denominator you still have to be born again absolutely it leads you to them if you receive a correctly it leads you to that place but we like to identify we like to have a label we like to be part of something but the common denominator is the Holy Ghost filled with the Spirit of God you born again we a little while ago we had a a merry man come to church a prayer meeting he turned up and he asked if he's allowed to come to the prayer meeting very nice man and he said look he prayed and he sang and he was just part of it and he said look I'm catching a plane at midnight I went over us to Australia I'm going over there to see my old friends to tell him about Lord what the Lord's done he had found the Lord something happen in his life guess what I never even asked or church do you belong to where do you go to church which fellowship has nothing to do with it you know when you gods and when God calls you he calls you when you were in Egypt it doesn't call you when you're already in a promised land but it's the same Jesus that spoke to you way back when you were either a child or or or in you worst days of real life it was Jesus they talk to you he calls and visits you while you're in slavery while you imprisoned while you're in the world he visits you there and we sometimes think it's only Jesus after I've seen this after I've seen that that's not true that's not true you see it is important that we get together not only to encourage and help each other but also in order to express our faith in his word Jesus said in Matthew and that just struck me afresh slightly 18:24 where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them you know it is always exciting knowing that Jesus himself is at the meeting and as we gathered in his name he is here and they anything can happen but you know only people have faith belief that so if we go to church and you know some want to meet in the name of Jesus Christ you can be assured he's right there then anything can happen but those who have not faith it's just another scripture they quote sometimes and sometimes they don't but I believe is here and whether see him or not he's still here I absolutely believe that and the word says oh jesus said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me see we can see Calvary his body was broken his blood or we remember but as I said the same Jesus you may not have identified with Calvary at the time came to see you to visit you when he was still in the world I remember I remember you know it's funny this Labor weekend and brother Isaac's sister Shannon's wedding anniversary yeah remember it's really well because Jesus was there so I want to remember Jesus Christ who was at your wedding at communion day there was Jesus there was--there I always said there was the second best wedding I've ever been to it but it was such a sweet presence and I felt so privileged there was part of her I wasn't the bridegroom I wasn't the bride Isaac and Shannon but I was part of their picture a part of what when God was there I was part of it we sang that song sing Hosanna give me all in my lap sing Hosanna you scripture many rods riding into Jerusalem they put palm leaves and their coats on the ground was that a praise the Lord King you know I had an experience when I was I can't explain it but I was translated to Jerusalem I don't seen the crowd crying Hosanna I was crying at the end I was by myself a good hook come here again I was right there because Jesus was there and I remember that so I want to remember Jesus when he made himself real to me like and I want you tonight it's not Sunday school but I want you tonight to remember situations where you knew Jesus you know maybe 10 years ago 20 years ago five years ago yesterday today just remembering the Lord ministered to you spoke to you when he was right there with you I want to remember it tonight do these things in remembrance of me we never can't have a complete fullness understanding of what he's done on the cross until we can't see what he's done beforehand and what he's still doing today it's the same Jesus doing the same thing absolutely you know this labor weekend 1978 I want to remember Jesus okay labor weakens 978 I was dead lost in sin and I was I went up to Taronga on the motorbike I went to a pub and a few drinks went to another pop another pop another pop and each time was a bit more drunk and I was totally lost said this way then outside a pub there was a little square I saw two three people and one with a guitar and it was this merry fellow is a guitar and he looked at me each time I walk past when I went from one pub to another edy comes 11 o'clock I was coming out the pub quite drunk so I went to him that's it you do a good job here convert those heathens out here I said to him that I believe in God you know I was hardly could stand up and you know Jesus was there he was in this man that's a one of the early encounters ahead and he looked at me was Isaac I can't explain such an expression he looked at me and said may I pray for you can I pray for you I wrestled what praying for me never heard of that I thought if he pray you pray for yourself praying for somebody else wouldn't deliver of cross my mind I pray Lord I want this help me here help me there you know and I said whoa even before I said look I believe in God he just answer my prayer and I showed him all the money I made him pop playing poker in a pub you know and he realized I didn't know Jesus and then he prayed for me and you know I sobered up and the presence of the Lewis Thea and I knew there was a moment I knew that Jesus was God that's the moment I knew so I remember I do take communion tonight because I remember these things do these things in remembrance of me not just imagining the Cross and him dying for you that's part of it it's part of it do you know when when I received the Holy Ghost I didn't see the cross of Calvary hey water I was just taken into the heavenlies I couldn't but scream and worship God who couldn't do anything else but you know let's remember these things let's remember it and you know that man prayed for me and I sobered up and first time in my life for years and years are cried you don't believe the next day Sunday how long ago was that 39 years ago 30 years ago I took my motorbike went to Rotorua labour weekend everything booked out couldn't find accommodation I went to a pub and had a drink and I thought I don't want to get drunk and I remember Jesus I looked up said Jesus if you God you know I need a place to sleep tonight you find me a place I was a trusted that he would I got out of the place it was raining I went to the first Motel across the road no sorry the whole town is booked out no accommodationist area maybe a station railway station or a waiting room somewhere you know no and then I left at the call me back say look we have some address here from some people sometimes they have exchange students maybe I could give them a ring sure enough they rang up and I went there and they were Christians and they gave me a Bible I remember Jesus doing that I remember Jesus tonight on our way back home to New Plymouth as I read the Bible and he started convict me I tried to live a religious life and try to put things right and I tried so hard you know and then one night I smoked cigarette was it to my friend that's the last one ever smoked him alive he laughed because he seen me give up smoking so many times now in the bedroom and that's it Lord Jesus I know it's wrong to smoke I don't want to smoke please take it off me I was instantly delivered I remember Jesus tonight I remember Jesus what he's done in my life and I want you to remember when he came to you you see I was still in Egypt but was still Jesus the voice of God Moses spoke in Egypt first then speak in a promised land that was Joshua yeah but it was first in Egypt I know I've have been told no not that kind of been the Lord because he haven't heard the message who else leads you to in I may have shared that before but in 1982 I was on the business trip and I was in Saudi Arabia for three weeks and dinner in Dubai for a week and then after all that I took a holiday so I was booking I booked the plane to Egypt and then to Israel but tom was in Egypt I was so desperate for fellowship desperate you know you don't have fellowship in those Arab places this for for real fellowship I went on my knees and said Lord Jesus I would love to have fellowship please lead me to real children of God not just a church to real children of God you know I went to Jerusalem the next day hired the car whenever Jerusalem lost my way I thought and I worked in a hotel was a Jewish one and I talked to the receptionist and then I said what's what's all that stuff here is all that Sabbath regulations you know it's it's four o'clock you light the candles and you do this and you know this Jewish people are religious people she said she said you can go down to waste and wall and watch them pray I said hey I don't find pleasure in watching people pray I pray myself I'm a Christian and then I heard somebody in the background praise the Lord then his embarrassed young woman came out really embarrassed and her parents picked me up to a meeting the next day I remember Jesus answering my prayer answering my prayer it was the most wonderful meeting I was just sitting there knowing the Lord led me here and after the meeting people ask me questions you know what do you think you see when you get to heaven or how do you see this what do you think about she's women have long hair or you know all these questions are just answered and they said how do you know this not having heard of brother Branham who is he never heard of the man but I thought he must have been a good man if that's the product but you see Jesus was there and he led me and he still needs me so I want to remember those things and you know I want you to go back in your life to all these different points where you remember something the Lord stands for you we had a meeting a few years ago at home and it was a real sweet atmosphere I just felt just ask everyone to give a short testimony and there are thought of how they received the Holy Ghost but then I thought nope because not everybody had been through that experience so I said look everybody give a testimony of something that happened in your life where you know the Lord was there remembering Jesus that's what I was wanting them to do you know it came to the last person I think it was a woman and she said I was about 13 years old came home from school just when I was going into door a voice spoke and said don't go in she got a fright and rented an either inside the house was her dad who committed the suicide so the Lord stopped her from going in and then she said today I'm a Bronwyn I heard the same voice and I've always said I want you to be like here remembering Jesus she remembered she she wasn't there she hasn't had this Holy Spirit experience but she remembered the same God that spoke to her then spoke to her again well let's remember Jesus tonight when we take the communion just go in your mind to the places where he ministered to you where he spoke to you you may have been sitting in a meeting and something happened and it spoke to you remember Jesus speaking to you you know I can tell you hundreds of times with Jesus was there I mean every day and will never leave you nor forsake you he's always there he's here tonight if we can believe that when two or three are gathered in his name he's right in our midst praise the Lord welcome Holy Spirit welcomes know Jesus welcome it's a wonderful thing in 1984 when I lived in a bush for four and a half months I tried to become a more holy person don't have to go to a bush for that I'll tell you that right now but you know when you're all on your own as much as the Lord is with you the devil is our deity trying to get you you know it's Christmas Eve I was sitting in that little house I was living in I hardly had any food I wasn't on a doll and I didn't have money so yeah I didn't eat very much at the time so I was there a little candle and the thought about when I was a child Christmas you know and then you know almost almost started emotional did they will try to come and look you're on your own and and you know all all that stuff no I thought no I'm not having that I didn't blow out the candle but I opened the Bible and they rate the story of his acquire and then I was so encouraged to read how God undertook for that man when the whole army of Syria was there - and told him T to surrender and all these things and no he trusted God now what did God - he slew 180,000 people in the enemy's camp now I don't do that very often better do it for you I remember I have to read that Jesus came on the scene oh man I picked up the guitar and I just I started like this I mean I never knew you didn't have a song or anything just pick that up - guitar star walk around by a little hat and they started [Music] there is power in the name of Jesus Christ there is power in the God of all yet she slew hundred thousand in need there is power in the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah our God cream later this same [Music] his name I remember so clearly I was so you can see lowly I mean I was alone I was alone I remember Jesus coming on the scene I had such a glorious time because I wasn't alone he was there and it's good to remember Jesus it's good I was a Christian thing but I remember Jesus but it was in a world when he ministered to me when he helped me you know Bible says even if we are unfaithful yet he remains faithful so when God answers your prayers it's not a sign that you've been faithful not at all you know you answer prayers of demons Lord leaders going to the pigs the answered their prayers you know with something you think ho going to answer my prayers how much be right with God you know he's faithful but I remember Jesus I remember I remember that so many times when he just come on the scene come on a scene and look even in normal everyday circumstances I remember when we were a bit younger we have we still have quite a few children but we didn't have all that much money and remember one Saturday morning I went for a little Drive we had a little station wagon some visitors bought it and sold it to us really cheap after they finished their tour in New Zealand very very nice of them I drove to town and then I don't know I felt like I'm sort of not quite there but I went to a castle have a look of course when you go to castles it's like when you touch a spiderweb says straight out you know they come and you know and cut a long story short they sold me a car I went out for a quick drive and come home with another car ron was quite surprised the car was a bit dearer so I left my car as a trade-in some money and I had to pay them another I think another thousand dollars how we can do finances no I don't buy anything on higher pitches and I don't do that I said look I'm getting paid that day I can pay then and then in next 10 days I can pay it so we agreed and they they they gave me a little insurance with it you know for three months and and all that I went for a drive on Sunday was born to Rotorua came back and the car used over a liter of oil doing a hundred kilometres so it was short the motor so I went back on Monday and said look this car has a problem it needs to be fixed and the servants are no that looks pay for the insurance if you already come back with it you know I said now don't care how bad it looks I mean I've gotten insurance you sell me a car that's no good I want it fixed and then they took it and had a fixed then it needed new pistons and new rings and and the new clutch and all sorts I got a back no I didn't get it back they said I have to pay an extra I don't know $700 because the insurance only pays so much so I have to have another $700 or whatever it was I didn't have money I didn't think there was right so I got to be disturbed he's a rock if you don't pay you can have the car and then I lifted I went home then I went to work and shared it with a few people at work and you know the advice you get when you share things like that Oh take him to fair go take him to court do this you know all that kind of advice you get but I didn't feel comfortable with that so I had an appointment with the manager so I went there and the managers sit sit there behind is this consumers rude you know we're in business here you know you've got to pay and that's that's why this and then I remember Jesus I remembered Jesus I remembered tonight that Jesus came on the scene I remember so clearly you know suddenly something came over me I was super happy I mean you can't not but be happy in the presence of the Lord it's no other way I've felt the presence of the Lord I'm so super happy and you know I can't say what he said to me or hell but I know he was there unless it to the man yes I know you're in business so am i but you know my business is happening on a higher plane bit higher than yours so the way I do business with you I said you have I have my trade in you already sold it you have the money if the car you can keep the Lord and I walk from now on you know he turned white red green every color you can imagine and he said just take the car and go don't have to pay anything but I remember it was Jesus that came on the scene so I want to remember these things I don't want to tell these things yeah that's so many many times I I mean I can go on for hours when Jesus comes on the scene I remember you probably know all the story but when Christine and I worked at our little shop I used to have motorbike in the pocket in the back there was a restaurant there or another two three shops and one afternoon I want to go home go to know nokey motorbike a very complicated law I had no key they went out to the bike then I thought I lifted in the bike and somebody stole the key didn't steal the bike stole the key and I went back in the workshop and said lord I need that key show me where the key is what you have to switch off your natural mind and approach him in faith natural mind says how can you find it keep somebody stole it you want to go through people's pockets downtown or what do you want to do and I said show me where the key is a man I went out and I walked down that mall and looking for my key I was going downtown to go and look for the key you know at the end of the mall there was a gate there was two pillars I went to the left one went down on my knees and look praise God I remember Jesus showed me where the key was I remember Jesus tonight the same Jesus that I don't Calvary for me the same jesus showed me where the key was and you know there was a man in the restaurant next door here often came over quite sarcastic you know making silly jokes about Christianity and all that and running you down he was the first one I went to witness telling him how the Lord showed me where the key was I looked in his eyes and I said you know the law can show me who took it but I don't need to know it he'll see you know I'm pretty sure it was him but you know hiding it somewhere laughing to see me walking home and you know but the Lord showed me what it was I remember Jesus tonight you know the Lord is wonderful and I believe every one of us can remember a time with Jesus did something in your life I think every one of us we wouldn't even be here if nothing ever happened in your life we wouldn't be here but I want you tonight to remember Jesus as you take the bread and the wine remember when he called you when you were yet in your sins and the Bible says why we were yet sinners Christ died for us and it's it's so clear to me when you look at the children of Israel as a type here is Moses God spoke to them while they were yet in sin and slavery he spoke to them and he knew that most of them would forsake him again once he showed his power he spoke to them he laid them out with power he laid them through the Red Sea I always say he didn't delete them over through it you know if he come to a a big trial he lead his true he doesn't just transport you over it he leads his through he can do that I remember one other one just Bala say this where Jesus came on the scene we had visitors coming for three weeks a family and I had to pick him up in Auckland at midnight I was very very tired so I had to drive up there and then that took them ages until they came out through customs and all that and I was so tired and these people were tired and too and and the woman she had a well she had a little I don't know how to put it a little mental problem okay and that made it even worse I was driving and fighting with you know not my tiredness not to fall asleep I was driving and listen to all these things and then I said it's now we coming to Piru next place is why he and then I said the next place will be Katie Katie and you know Katie Katie never came next place it was just outside Toronto I don't know how that happened I was just there and I remember Jesus I can do that I checked the time it took me from Auckland to Tehran and it was a around 1/2 hours and you don't drive in one half hours from Auckland to Tara yeah even if you do hand the 50 all the way it wouldn't work you know it normally is - and the cooler air from the airport if you have no traffic 1/2 hours I was there I remember Jesus you know supernatural God our God and we want to remember him tonight in our lives what he's done in our lives and you know if God did only that much in your life if you haven't got all these tremendous big things but as long in all of us Jesus who did remember him tonight at that place where he ministered to you or did something for you remember him tonight as we eat the bread you know I always said when we did the communion you break off the breath because he was broken for you it's your doing that broke him your sin broke him so we take the bread we stand around in the front we take the bread we eat it all at once at the end and then remember Jesus try to remember Jesus if you want to pray pray if a scripture comes to your mind speak out the scripture if you feel like singing sing you know it's it's not a ritual you know it I'm not here having a ritual we're remembering Jesus tonight and I'd like you to remember Jesus you know you know when he spoke to you in your life you know when it was him who did something for you I want you to remember it tonight now so many wonderful things you know we can talk about him day and night so many wonderful things he's done in our lives and I remember so many things with the Lord's done for me you know and for others and for others and I was allowed to be part of that picture no I want to close with this before we have communion you know when my children were smaller you know sometimes you want to entertain them and yeah just one thing we used to have our celebration night on Friday and then I used to do something special with them or we had a special treat or something like there they always looked forward to celebration night and one night I was busy I had to do something so I didn't know what to do so I had a few old business cards of mine which we're obsolete and I've just handed out three cards see if we want and said look just write down on the back of the cards what you really would like I said it's not that daddy will give it to you but so I know what you like and just thought it gives me a ten-minute break he gave those cards and disappear in my room and of course that came out again and then sit down again and then cats came Albert's oh what a chainsaw strawberries and then Melanie chocolate fish and and all these different things you know what the children desired and then and then neck Christine was you card and then there's she looked all strange you know I didn't know what's going on then she threw them there took the card empty next one empty next one I want to give my heart to the Lord you know what is it I remember Jesus was they that no that's I remember you see these things I was part of their picture I remember I was in my room and I don't say that for an example but you know when you have a lot of children they always knock on the door you can't even go to bathroom there's somebody knocking and calling you you know it's this way this that's the way it is and you can't get away from things so so I went to my room 10:30 at night I said get away get away you don't leave me alone third time leave me alone fourth time open the door what do you want xalbert I wanna give my heart to the Lord oh man that changed things I said oh come in we maintain our knees we prayed together you know I know the Lord was there and he learned very early in life what it means to prison you know that's really at the prison and you know you know he turned off this doesn't work you turned away nothing seems to work you press in anyway that's what I love about this morning about the message you know it's you and God it's you God you know you got Church the one next to you you might not like the people or you might not like somebody else who cares it's between you and the Lord if you believe that Jesus is here tonight you want to be in church wouldn't you you want to be where he is and I believe there's more than two or three here gathered in his name so he is here and we remember our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ you know just closes this one we had we had this aboard an old picture frame sometimes I used to go to the auction once a week and they had oh you know five picture frames for a dollar or you know really a whole box full of stuff and the children like that you know I said the race we can dump again you know if it's no good it only costs a dollar so I had this big picture frame and so I just took the picture I turned it around was nothing fancy and then scribbled through a little house on it and the children sitting around and I said oh look he is it house and here is a farm dog and then I made a little pond ELISA pond and he little ducks and and up there put a little aeroplane in the air and the hot-air balloon and here a train line and everything here's captain here's burden and the children had always called it the busy picture busy picture and I say that in relation to what I said about the Isaac and channels wedding it was a picture so the picture was there's a bride and the groom getting married and the Lord was there I know that but there was the beach there was to see there was but I was there as part of the picture and when you see this busy picture even if you're a little bird somewhere you had to find you part of the big picture and you part of the Lord's picture and it's such a blessing just to know we part of it if we're there when it happens we part of it where a witness would we've been there when the Lord moves we've been there when things that were happening we part of the picture we may not be the main character but we privileged to be part of it and I love that so tonight we believe by faith his word there were two or three appear that he's in elements so if Jesus is here like I said anything can happen so when we take the communion as I said who we can meet those who take the communion perhaps stand here around near the front and oh should I hand it out okay I'll hand out the bread you break your own breed off and then we eat it all together and that's the Lord ministers to you if as you remember the Lord praise them to remember a scripture speak it out whatever the Lord lays on you have because we are here to remember Lord Jesus Christ amen can I ask you to come forward please
