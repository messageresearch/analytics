sought and they're found Lord Jesus say we just want to continue to commit the service to you thank you for this opportunity that we can be gathered here amongst Brethren Lord and to sing praises to

the Son of God Lord You're the king of kings and Lord of lords Lord it would be such a wicked thing if we didn't know that Lord if we didn't understand that and we just went about going through this life without acknowledging you Lord but it's by your amazing grace that we can call you our Lord and savior Lord so we just love you with all our hearts Lord in which pray you bless those that are

them I think one two three four five six seven eight nine ten that's a big band praise the Lord our band overfloweth amen that's that's what the Lord does Amen Let's uh just where you're standing I just want to um I can drive this from here let's I will go to um we're going to read from X 16 30. how are you all this evening you good yeah good you had a good day yeah yeah you awake are you you see I I was in Camp and spirit so I watched the services I was there but um my body didn't pay a price but I I thought you know a lot of the Brethren may be quite tired you maybe some of you drove back yesterday some on Monday I think by the Empire got back I saw you Sunday night maybe one or two in the morning or something yeah man and then different ones were sort of trickling back so um it's okay to be tired but not tonight no look hey that we understand but I think it's a it's a you're here because you love the Lord and God will reward you you know we sometimes think God is this God that doesn't really see these things but he sees them he sees it when you're tired and you carry on anyway he sees it amen let's just read acts 16 Verse 30 says this is we're cutting into the story of Paul and the the prison and went after all the chains broke but we're just going to start from here and brought them out and said this is the Jailer talking to Paul and said sirs what must I do to be saved and they said this is Paul and Silas their belief on the Lord Jesus Christ and now shall be saved and thy house and they spake unto him the word of the Lord and to all that were in his house praise the Lord may God bless his word you can take your seats um this evening now the thought that I've got to speak about this evening is not a new thought and it's not going to be something that you don't already know there are sometimes when I may think I speak something that maybe you haven't heard but that's not tonight is just a simple one but it's a very very important one because it affects all of us probably to our core this concept here because you know the most beautiful thing the most precious thing in this world is the Lord and the second most beautiful thing are people and then there's the people that are close to us that mean more to us and this is dealing with that those people and so I think if you had to give up a lot of things in life maybe you had to slowly offload things that you own things that you wanted to wanted to um possess I think you're a family member would probably go after you would give up a piano you would probably give up a piano first and you'd keep your brother or your mother yeah you're probably empty your bank account first before you gave one of them up you know if you really in the core of you you'd for me I'd give up everything and that would be the last thing that I would give up and I would give up myself before them and that's what the Lord did for us so this is a this subject I think is a very important subject and I'm I'm going to try and more teach rather than preach because it's an exciting thing to preach about but sometimes when we preach we miss the just teaching and talking about it because it's something that I think is as a fundamental belief for it for a fellowship that everyone understands this concept and and is on board with it because it affects all of us this this concept of me and my house and and what we are able to possess what that means me and my house now this is this is pertaining to Salvation and this basically what I'm going to be talking about is is there is one faith that we have for ourselves initially for our own salvation and then we are given opportunity if we want to possess it which we all do that we can apply that same Faith to our house whatever that might be and they can receive the same salvation that we receive based on our faith well that sounds like a big big subject or a big matter but that's actually the truth our faith can save someone else not that we can save them but our faith in the Lord can cause them to come to Salvation okay and and we need somewhere in the Bible to base this belief on like we I can't just come out and say to you oh this is this is the way that it works you know and it's just that you know we have to have a as Believers we have to have a reference point in the word of God somewhere where we can say okay from this example here this is why I believe that well from this word here it has to be somewhere I can't just come and say it and then because when you go through a tough time Where Are You Gonna anchor it too you have to have some point where this thing gets anchored onto so the first thing I want to show you was we're about this this where do we put the anchor what part of the word of God do we put that onto now this is an interesting concept I'm going to go through four examples first just to say we understand this is how we get to this uh belief as a believer you see because that's because we are believers and so we see the word of God and then we believe it that it's true and then we anchor onto that and our life can be built on that okay this is an interesting place that we anchor this one to because essentially we are anchoring this onto a I would say a private conversation that happened between Paul and a jailer about two thousand years ago they had a private conversation that Paul spoke to another man and said the the Jailer asked Paul sirs what must I do to be saved and Paul's response to him it's just it could almost be deemed a strange thing that we then latch onto his responses say well I claim that for myself but you see we understand this concept that if God does it one way for one person and if that's then he will do it the same way for other people so so even though Paul was speaking to the Jailer that see that they were in prison singing songs and after they'd been beaten for preaching the gospel and that they were Paul and Silas ended up in prison they were singing they were rejoicing the other jailers would have heard it and they were down in the inner prison and the Jailer was told do not let these guys out you've got to look out you've got to keep them secure down there the Jailer would have heard them singing in that sort of thing but eventually he fell asleep and they were still singing and about midnight the prison shook all the doors were open and the prisoners were free the Jailer woke up and he thought man this is an awful situation to be in these guys I'm supposed to look after are running out the door it's it's either I finished my life now or tomorrow when they find out they're all gone I'll be off with my head so I'd rather just be a bit more graceful and take my life now so he went to take out a sword to kill himself and Paul saw this happen and he said don't kill yourself we're all still here and he knew they were Christians because word gets around you know okay that's these guys they're following this Jesus guy that was in you know in Jerusalem and they they're this funny Bunch they're always jumping up and down and singing carrying on and doing all these funny things and word would have got around who they were they knew why they were there yep they're now they're in this town trying to talk the same thing and these guys the town had enough of them so they put them in the prison so he kind of knew what was going on but but there was enough inside of him there was something inside of him they said that when this happened he said sirs that was his first word sirs what must I do to be saved that's that was his opening question like oh how did this happen it was what must I do to be safe so he knew that what they were preaching was something to do with salvation of his soul something happened now the response that Paul gave him was believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you and your house shall be saved so and now don't miss the point that Paul is speaking to one person but giving him a promise to other people that we're not there okay now now we can look at that and say okay why did Paul say that he must have because God was going to do what Paul said would happen he's saying if you believe you'll be saved in your house so that's how we can latch onto this and say well Paul wasn't saying that as just a one-off thought he's saying this is the god that I serve and this is what he'll do if you'll go about it this way so we can go about it the same way and achieve the same result okay I want to go through four of these really quick the second one was um Cornelius yeah you like the pictures you little guys and girls good day yeah Uncle Isaac always gets pictures hey now I'm going to warn you about Brother Andy when we telling you last time what did we say he's listening he puts pictures up for you guys and girls that don't even relate to the words just put a picture there hey don't be fooled by that man I've done the hard work I've got pictures that relate to it man you know hello Brother Andy praise the Lord um okay Cornelius now there was a man called Cornelius and the Bible says he was a good man he was a just man a good man and he and he did a lot of uh Good Deeds he was he just had a good heart in him and he prayed to God whichever God that would be to him he felt like it was God he didn't really know who God was but he prayed to this God and it must have been the God because his actions were kind of living out what a Christian would do I'm sorry I just changed that okay at devout man one that feared God so he was fearing the god of the the Jews this this God I believe and then it says in a vision he saw in a vision and an angel came to him and said uh thy prayers and thine arms have come up for a memorial before God this is an important concept uh Cornelius the things you're doing haven't just gone unnoticed your heart and your actions uh they've come up before God and as a result God's going to do something special for you go and get these men go down to drop it get these men and have them to come back so what and sorry I want to go back to this one send men to Joppa and call for Simon whose surname is Peter who shall tell the words whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved so he said it's for you and all your house so then Cornelius acted on the word that he'd been given and he gathered all his family around and he gathered all his friends around too he he took advantage of the situation all his friends because it says and Cornelius waited for them and in court and had called together his Kinsmen and their friends all of his friends too he's like hey if you're coming too you know and then the Bible says that Paul went and spoke the words uh sorry Peter went and ministered to them and as he spoke the Holy Ghost fell upon them and they received the Holy Ghost him and all of his house and all of his friends as well okay so this one was another example he was told something but they said if you want to you can bring in whoever you want to and they can receive the same thing and he acted on it the other one that we go on is the other example so these are examples we can realize okay if God does it this way for them he'll do the same thing for me but this is just a place where our faith is this is the story of Rahab you wanna know the story of Rahab behold when we come into the land Thou shalt bind this line of scarlet threat in the window which thou did US let us down by and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy Brethren and although father's household home unto thee and it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be Guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our head if any be upon him so this example here is raheb had this promise now even though the the spies see the spies went into Jericho Rahab realized who they were she had respect to what they were doing and she said the whole city is scared of you they know that that God is with you and we're all scared here even though it looked like a powerful City she confessed we're all scared and the spies went back and told Joshua they're all scared and that gave them faith but but she had something in her that respected these men and she and then the the word got around that these men were in the city and they and the the guards and everyone tried to find them and she hid them in a way and said no they're not here they were here but they took off they ran away and then when all the men went out to find them then she said to the men okay now oh you need to get out once there once they've gone for a couple of days and you I'll let you down the wall and you get out and you'll be safe so she helped these minute Escape but she said I want a short token I want I want to be saved when you come back here I know you're going to wipe the city up and save me now those men gave her a promise on behalf of God because those men didn't hold the walls up they didn't hold up the walls God held up the wall so they had the authority to actually give her a promise that God would back he said you hang the Scarlet thread get everyone in here in here nothing will happen to you and but what if see if it wasn't true they would have just died there and there would have been a Scarlet threat under the rubble on the side of the building but God held that building up because he actually made the promise see when you respect a man or or a minister of the gospel and you receive it as from the Lord then it's the Lord working like the Jailer received that word as from the Lord and claimed it from the Lord so him and his house got saved that's how and when we have respect to the gospel then it works for us the last one I want to show is is the Passover this is another example of a of it of something being applied to a family and whoever is within that can be saved for then I'll just read the scripture for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will Smite all the first one of the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the house where ye are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt okay the concept behind this was if there was this Blood applied onto the door and that's what it looked like that's all I had to do quite a simple thing to save your family wasn't it they just had to paint it on there but they had to believe it if they respected it they said that's it yep they got some hyssop as brother Ed spoke about they got some blood they put it on the door and they sat inside that was all they had to do being saved was very simple just receive it it's not you don't have to do all this Penance and walk up these steps and say all these things and slash your back and all these things you just receive it it's very easy salvation is very easy okay so now I want to look in this with all of these examples you you would say what is your house because we all have different well what what is in my house what can I claim as being my house because I don't believe we can there's no basis to pray a prayer Lord save the whole world because we want to Anchor that on what basis would I anchor that on and I'm just praying the whole world will be safe because I know that it can't happen it doesn't really work like that you know and and even you need to you need to have faith in something you need to know something that's true in order to Anchor your faith onto it if you didn't believe something was true then you wouldn't act on it okay so we need to understand that this is true we can anchor our faith in here then once you've got that you don't have to move for nothing you can stay there okay so the um the the Passover if we if we just take the Passover first as an example who was the Passover uh who sort of who who was over that house you'd say okay it was whoever whoever was in charge of the house it could have been a grandmother could have been a uh Uncle like it wasn't just dead and it was my house because some people maybe the dad was dead and uh and it was the grandmother looking after the house so in this case the grandmother's Faith could say okay this is what I've heard uh children everyone come into my house and put this on and then we're saved I just want to say this because it's not just like the Jailer was the man of the house but it's not just that that's not how this works because that's the Grandma's house that could have been sister's house and all their little siblings because mum and dad are dead but the sister is in charge there it's whoever you understand it can be right uh Rahab that was Rahab in relation to everyone else was either a sister or a daughter but she was able to say come into this house and you'll be saved to the father so so she could say to the grandfather come in and they were saved through her okay uh Cornelius he was the man of the house he was a soldier you know so he was family coming he maybe was quite influential that's where all his friends came to friends coming yeah we're coming too you know that was his influence he had and the Jailer was he was obviously a father because he had it says that his house came in but I put these other examples because you don't just relate it to a man it's your house like sisters everyone has houses this is my house and this is what I can claim for me okay now I'm going to turn this slightly a little bit still going on it but you know I'm going to apply this you know we we have relationships family relationships which are powerful our mothers father in a little powerful relationships but I think I'm going to go more to the children one for a wee bit a parent children one if you don't have children you just have to listen in and when it's your turn you'll remember back to what I said okay because should the Lord Terry okay because that's quite a powerful one because it means something to you you know we we in life we kind of just maybe separate from our natural brothers and sisters and go our own way and that but you know but there's something about our children that are quite close to us you know they they're a bit harder to separate from that because it's like this there's a connection there it's a powerful connection and um the reason why I wanted to speak on this within us too is that here's an interesting concept that six percent of adult Christians that only six percent of adult Christians made their decision to follow the lord after the age of 18. so that means 94 make their choice under the age of 18. so only so very very few people statistically followed the law later on in life they make a decision after 18. if you got saved after 18 you're in the minority you're on the 10 percent and even brother Brown talked about this that you know the the young folk is where the activity is when people get to a certain age they get set they've obviously had their choices they've been in this flexible place and then they get set and then that's the course they generally will take it's a miracle when an atheist of 60 or 70 actually repents and fully comes to the lord it's a very it's a miracle okay but it is possible because anything's possible with God but but in this time of in this youth time here I've just got this one here up there's this transition point where where children where you have people grow up in their their Under head ship and under in their minds you're under head ship too and there's a point where in their mind they start to think actually I'm a person as well I can do things too uh who says you're right that that's human development right we start to grow and it's that's about I don't know 10 11 12 that 12 they start to think these thoughts and it's a transition from being under everything else and then transitioning to actually I want to be my own person you know that's what that's what it's all about I want to be my own man young men I want to be a man you know I'm the man of the house now dad's like no you're not you know I am why can't I be because I pay the bills or you know we it gets a but see when they're small their concept's not there like yes they're no dead you know they're just but it's a transition so then in that transition you have a lot of that's where Satan moves and that's where God moves because they have to then make choices there's a lot of choice being made there it's a very very powerful there's no other time like it for a human being then in this 10 to maybe 17 18 that that time there no other time like it in a in the lifespan of a human being the only reason why I put the other one there is because there's a menopause woman guys that got it easy we just have one little change we're done done and dusted We Carry On women do go through another cycle where it changes their even mindsets it has an effect on on their natural makeup and how they I think their mind thinks and that the same as see the transition here affects people's minds how their minds think they think funny thoughts it's all it's not normal sometimes so these two transitions are unique and Satan knows that that's why he gets in there when he can to mess that up right now the reason why I wanted to speak about this a bit with us is because in our fellowship it just happens and you're looking for yourself hey Divi yeah I love that about human beings that we all love ourselves you know and when we put a picture up where's me whoa where's my son you look for your children hey who look for their children see that's the redeeming love of God is the same where's my son where's my daughter but hey that's how we work and I think it's great like I like a little guy that's me me because I think you know if you were like that you'd probably die you know you need to be calling out I like it I don't think it's selfish I think it's fun but just if I could generalize it seems to be that in our fellowship we have this we've got some some of us have older children that have sort of been through it but and but there's actually I've just noticed the age group of people here there's a sort of big crop you know like they call the Baby Boomers you know that the men came back from the war and then they all settled down and had children and a lot of them and like a short space of time these families exploded across the world and then as a result you had this big age bracket of people moving through Society like now they're all retiring that's why you see uh uh Rest Homes and that that are springing up everywhere it's to accommodate for the Baby Boomers the there's a massive age that are coming through that are working their way through the system so there's there's this age group of people that are more than the other age groups of people that are working its way through statistically that's that's that is the fact so and I just look around us and I've just noticed you know within this little age bracket we're talking about there's like this big crop right in the middle of it working their way through you know like there aren't many below it and there aren't a lot above it there are a few but the crop is sort of all coming through so we're all coming into I mean I've had I've sort of been I've got a few left in there but I kind of me and brother and a few of us have got a few on the other side you know we're we're wiping our scars we're lucky you know we're but we've got a lot this Fellowship has a lot in here a lot a lot and that's why I wanted to talk about this now because this is we're going to be involved in this in a big way some of it's going to be pretty some of us not okay and that's going to be the way that it is but we're we're but that's why we're speaking about this because we want to get it out in the open because Satan always tries to mess around and when there's big Transitions and things he always tries to mess with us and you see when we're going along a straight everything's quite easy but when it's when you have to turn a corner that's when things get funny that's when accidents happen that's when things are different difficult okay we took the children go-karting the other day it was actually for Richie's birthday and and I recorded some video and this video shows people going along a straight all like everything's all nice and these youth are going along everything's all nice and then they hit this age of about this they try to take the turn you know Jay tries to go and all Ricky's going a little bit fast boom Nails them but Tamers held back a bit though there's trouble here timer decides the coast is clear but no there's another crop coming on and it's AV oh it's that all comes in again meanwhile Hannah see your children are different story of your life once everyone's made their kindness just leisurely goes around you know as if nothing was going on and I think you'll find that we are I don't know what the Lord's going to do I don't know what the law is going to do but it may there may be some of those situations some will just easily go around other ones there'll be a bit of Crash and Carnage that's it may be all 100 no crashes it may be a couple of crashes maybe all crashes you know and we don't want any crashes but that's just you've got to be honest there's a sharp corner there's a big transition there's going to be there's going to be something happen okay there's going to be something happening somewhere okay now before I get into this I want to take a big picture perspective you know when we speak about raising children of things we can we can go down to small things and say well if you do this this will affect their psychology and then later on they'll think this and that and that that's good to do that because you know you're zoning in but when you take a big picture perspective you think okay what's the what's the what's the most important outcome for my children that I want you know do I want to have this little attitude or that or overall if I could only choose one thing what would I choose you choose their salvation right that's okay that yeah I don't care if it's a horrible child just save them you know rather he'd be horrible and safe to obviously if they say they won't be but I'm saying when you pull it right back right that's what you would want and the only way that that can happen is if the Lord does it is the only way no amount of all your effort all your work all your trying your this and that now that can Aid it I understand that but I'm saying from a big picture perspective the only thing that can save your child is the Lord nothing else if you think that you can do it you've got if you you'll see as you go along down the road that it's not quite that simple that there's a thing in everyone's mind that only God can work there's somewhere in them that you can't touch just it doesn't matter if they're close to you or not close to you you there's a place that only God can touch right and you you have to accept this concept in order to be able to apply faith okay because when you understand this do you think Lord okay I'll do everything I can I want to yeah I understand these things I do yes I understand that but there have been people saved that the parents did nothing hated them cast them out and that person got saved you think it was the dad's great parenting the dad wasn't there the mum wasn't there you see okay so I want to get that young that were you happy with that concept yep okay so now we get this funny hand dealt to us in life that some children are one way and some are the other right like some people just are born like this they're just angry other girls are just like they're just real nice they just or is it the other way around guys the girls are grumpy and the guys are like hey they just you know but you get dealt a different they just come out different you think well I've got this whole parenting thing all down you know and then the next one comes along and it's different you're like well hang on hang on no no this doesn't I've got that one sorted out this one I apply the same tactic to this one and it doesn't quite work the same it's a complex situation okay very very very complex oh here we go is this is this is this more what it is hey that's what it is alien yes Liam there and who's that we won't don't answer that man that was close brother very close to you could have could have been a rift in the youth group in the Sunday School you bet it would have had the same school teachers would have had some work they're just different people are just all different that's how we we we just and they can be different in the same household one thinks one way and is like this one another way and you think it's the same household like like this one the The Prodigal Son versus his brother I'm gonna venture to say they say essentially were born in the same house raised under the same ideas and and belief systems and everything and the same amount of let's go ahead that he had that I I think it was hey within the whole sibling thing he got more than me no they got more than Me overall you'd say they were reasonably the same right like it's not not different like one was adopted in when he was older and so he was from a whole different background it was the same and yet one decides I'm out of here one decides I'm staying so then you look at that and you think so in this situation here see because parents can sometimes get a bit down but this what did the dad do wrong in this situation and the other one came out all right so but this one's disappearing when you look at it like maybe if they both would have gone you may have said oh maybe the dad did something wrong because that's how we like to think but then you've got a 50 50 split something it just it just was now we have to some that sometimes that just is now we go into parenting right I haven't got where I've got the fix on I don't okay we go into parenting you know and we think we've got it all together hey here we go this is just this picture no no that's not the one sorry we're going to Parenting and we think oh man my parents were nice but they weren't there no we're near as good as what I'm going to do and you know I'm going to do it so much better than them because they did this and this and this and then we go and do it and we get down the road a while and we're like oh okay it's not quite as easy as what I thought and then we get further down the road and we're like man and then in the meantime our children are saying I mean when I ever have children man I'm not going to be doing it like them and and our parents know that we've said the same thing about them and so on goes the cycle of life that none of us really know what we're doing when we when we accept the reality of it and we say Lord It's Only by your grace and mercy that I'm going to ever amount to anything can you just help me Lord and you know you think you're doing the right thing and then maybe 10 years later you realize man I've just messed up for 10 years I should have been doing it this way and you're like but I've come 10 years down the track I've got to try and write this wrong and then you try and do that and it's just all and maybe you do something right and then the next one you do it wrong it's all just it's complicated it's never as easy when we do it but I want to I want to say this to to keep our minds our attitude corrects that if you have a prodigal son or daughter that goes a certain way it's very important don't beat yourself up self up over it because that's the first thing Satan's going to try and make you sure you can look back and think you know we always like to contemplate there's nothing wrong with that but we can get really beaten up by this now I know what I'm talking about because I've been through it right and we can start to really beat ourselves up over it and and it's all us and you imagine someone that just had one and then they went out like that you know and they've got no other reference like maybe the the the father was with the prodigal son at least he thought wow I can't be all bad this guy's still here and he's all right you know there's a there's a bit of a balance for his mind but it's important that that you don't beat yourself up over because that's what Satan wants you to do right but then if you've got a couple of stayers some people just like Say the video that I showed you of the cars you know these guys are Crash and Burn and that and then one of the girls just happily goes around makes the transition carries on down the track some people are just like that now God's got all sorts of different stories he wants to tell okay and we need to start to accept this as being like that and we're we're not the be-all and end all and in control of everything okay we need to we need to understand that way like and I want to I want to touch on this topic because we like to we have this like testimonies like like we like to hear interesting testimonies uh brother John shared testimonies on on the weekend right and what testimonies did he share of he shared uh this person this girl was going through this hard thing and she was cutting her wrists you know and now we hear that and that sounds drastic because we're like wow she's got a knife out you're imagining in your mind she's got a knife out and she's slashing her wrists and so it's an intense it's a powerful story so it's worth retelling because we like to hear powerful stories and then how then now God came through but you didn't hear a story about another sister in the church that you just never heard nothing of she's been there since she was a little girl now she's playing the piano and praising the Lord and never cause no one any trouble and she's like well what about me I've been right well if I buy battle so I just wasn't slashing myself but you know but they like if we applied the same logic to like a race say a a bike race right one person I think I could say this one person is in a bike race and they they do really well you only ever talk about people that do well in races eh like well you see that person that ran that did that bike race at the start they took off and then they rode really fast they took that corner really well and then that's straight and they were so fit and then they went up that hurling down and they how they took those Corners there and then they came in and they won the race they're awesome you'd clap clap clap but then this other guy man he started off didn't get five meters before he's off the bank and then he he's out there and he goes and he takes the wrong way the guys are trying to tell him it's this way and he goes the wrong way ends up in a river and then he's lost his bike and he's got to walk the rest of it and his shoes fall apart and he he finally gets to the end and we laugh at him good on you for trying you know now and a testimonial sense we would testify that guy's this guy here oh man it took a while but he made it you know I don't want to be little with the story because because the thing about it is God's got stories he's also a storyteller and that's why I say this sometimes God just wants to tell a story and and you hear the testimonies but you can't have a testimony without a test and some people just got to go through a test like that that girl if she didn't cut her wrists you wouldn't have heard the testimony you understand it and that's why I say don't beat yourself up don't think oh if you have committed everything to the Lord sometimes God's writing a testimony this is an important concept because it seems like we're throwing out all of our parental duties but when you understand God's a bit bigger than all this sometimes he wants a testimony like we'll tell a story about this guy that went out and wanted to be a gang member and he did this and that but then God called him home God's got those stories he says this is going to be your journey because I want to do this story that's why he says here how thank you if a man have a hundred sheep when one of them be gone astray the Earth he not leave the 99 and Goth into the mountains and seek us that which has gone astray sometimes he's got the story wait here sheep I'm gonna go find that one you know and the sheath rule back there wow is he going to find him that's the story and then he and they they might see the Sheep way up on the side of the cliff is he going to get him I think he will and the Shepherds scaling the side of the mountain pass and he's and the rocks are slipping down the side of the mountain and he's hanging on to the the roots of the trees and he and he has his he can't quite get to it so he gets off his he's got maybe a scarf around him and he ties it onto the the tree branch and he lulls himself down and he rescues the sheep and all the Sheep are watching it going wow what an amazing Shepherd we have I mean something's trying to mess with me the screen um I don't say anything um so you see God's got stories so we we you have to accept sometimes if you're a believer in your plan then there's going to be some people will take a path okay now I'm not going I'm not saying you understand what I mean okay yeah good good because it's it's um otherwise we can think wrong in our mind when we see someone going somewhere and we can start to think oh maybe that parent did this maybe they did that maybe they didn't what did job do last time I checked he didn't do much wrong you understand there has to be a test if there's a testimony if you want to have a story of redemption somewhere then someone's got to go to a dark place to be redeemed amen now sometimes it's the grace of God that allows that because then there's a story there's there's hope for other people you know you can say look there's hope for you I've been through that you know and if I could speak just from my heart for a few minutes then I've got some I just want to speak to you about my journey because I've been the Lord's been gracious enough to me that I've been able to go through take a few of these different pathways on this journey I've had I've had one I've I'm just going to speak openly from my heart you know I've had I've had happiness and I've had sadness on this journey I've been a path of happiness and I've been on a path of a lot of sadness and and I thank God for the journey I think Lord sometimes I sit back I think Lord you've brought me so through me through so many hard things in my life like just sometimes it's not bearable Shannon said my hair's growing back now but but this stuff makes you lose your hair you just you're under so much pressure for years that just your body is is getting worn down under this pressure but I'm glad the Lord let me go through it because I can understand it and I have had to take this journey and I I've looked around on the journey because you know God's gracious and you can look around and realize wow this is this is what this path looks like and I just want to tell you a few stories and Dave won't mind me saying this because you know why go through a path and you can't actually tell some of your experiences on the way that other people that are going through something maybe you can say hey look I know what you're going through it's all right it's going to be all right but this is just some you know you know me I do a lot of song leading not not because I really want to but I always get told I have to songly so a song Lead and that's the truth God knows that's the truth it's only been the last 12 months I've actually enjoyed it for the first time in my life I've actually thought I enjoy that but the rest of the so who remembers this camp this was uh brother Diggs you remember this time that that service everyone in the whole church is up on their feet praising the Lord You're all about most of the people there some that weren't this was what was happening the Lord was moving everyone was up praising the Lord singing and on their feet now there was one person there was one person in the whole of the congregation that was sitting down not into it one person who do you think that was David right if you don't mind me saying this okay I need I'm going to talk about this right I remember sitting at the back because we we had our seat near the back looking around at everyone praising the Lord and look and looking and seeing there's one person in this whole building of 300 people that's just not into it at all stubborn not gonna move not gonna do nothing sitting down and I thought that's my son of everyone here and you think about I'm not the only one that can see that right you guys are all conceived with your eyes you can look around and you probably glanced over and other people did too oh there's David not standing up right now you think about I've got to get up there walk up I've got to see that and I know what's I know he doesn't want to be there he's not into God I'm just I'm done with all this nonsense I'm not into it I've got to see that then I've got to walk up here and I've got to walk up here and say praise the Lord we're going to have a good time in the Lord this morning who's ready to praise the Lord do you know that was hard to do you don't know that that was hard to do I was sitting down there thinking Lord I don't want to get up there I just don't want to get up there no man it was hard and you know I had to go up there you put on a brave face praise the Lord now that at some point it becomes a real face like no this is what I believe I'm going to praise the Lord you know but there's a point of challenge where you think this is hard this is It's not like oh I I don't see what's happening I saw what was happening and it was hard then the next Camp the next Camp was even slightly harder because I think there was there were a few messages that talked about it basically if your children are like that then it's the parents fault and this one David wasn't even there I remember on the Sunday afternoon I left the camp and I drove down to otaki Beach and I parked at the beach and I said Lord I just I just don't want to go back to that camp you realize how hard this is for me like everyone knows Dave's not there you know and and here I am and I'm supposed to get up and lead people and worship like yeah you know the the this affects our mind right this doesn't just we don't just leisurely stroll through this and it's all easy it's hard for about it was hard for my mind Lord this is hard for me now these are just a few examples that you would know because you were at these camps and you you would have seen me go up there and say we're going to praise the Lord now but it wasn't easy it wasn't like there was a sacrifice for praise okay but so if you're going through this I know what you're going through I understand that's why I'm very gracious of people are going through it I'm like no no it's all going to be all right you you're not going to hear you're not if my thoughts could speak they they're not going to speak anything negative about you or your situation at all because I've been there I know what it's like and there's a lot of twisting and turning in your mind was it because I did this did I do that did I do that and Satan's always trying to play at you like that oh you did this it's because you did that it's because of this it's because of that he's messing with you for a lot he's saying it's all it's all you we have to say no we have to pull back and say no I'm applying the token it's all going to be all right I don't care what I did you know and you know I used to in in my in my times of thinking I would I I would think a lot and I would think I said to Shannon we know the sister that we actually baptized here in Gisborne and her mother believes the Lord her father not interested in God says it's all a load of nonsense not true and I said to Shannon and so this this girl has come out serving the lord loves the Lord baptized at a young age younger than Dave I said to Shannon that's what I did wrong I should have said to Dave I should have just disbelieved God look he had he disbelieved God he just he told her this other father told his daughter her whole life don't believe God don't go to church it's all a load of nonsenses don't do it and he wasn't saying that to use reverse psychology he doesn't believe in God and he was telling her it's nonsense I don't know where you're going every Sunday when she go to church I don't know where you're going there it's a waste of time still is the same to this day right and I thought well and and look at his result how does this work here's me I've been doing this for 20 years man week after week after week and this is what I get no I wasn't saying that but the devil's saying and you'll be doing that all that time and that's what you get what of it it messes with our mind you know we we battle but we think no it's all going to be all right the the Lord's he's and actually that idea was powerful for me the Lord said I'm just writing a testimony you've got to go through a test to get a testimony I couldn't tell you the story if I didn't go through it sometimes it's just writing a testimony was I did I do everything all wrong this one here I don't really care too much for Christmas trees and all that but this but you know one of my desires of my heart was I came from a sort of semi-broken family where it all kind of people went away from serving the lord and then we would have these big Christmas parties and they were never nice because there was always different partners from my family each year and it would be different children would sort of they would be with someone and then they would have two children they would have two in this so each year you'd see different people would turn up because it was all broken families and things and then it would just be a whole lot of drinking and not not a nice environment and I thought Lord I never want this from my family like when I'm when I'm here and I and I've got this family sort of when I'm the patriarch and got this below me I just don't want that I just want Believers I want my children to marry Believers we can come together on Christmas we can all gather and and they can be an atmosphere that we're all just love the Lord and then we're gonna I'm just Lord It's we don't even need to talk about the Lord but we will but you know it's just the atmosphere I just want that and we all we all know hey we just we love the Lord that's that was a desire of my heart and so when I started going the other way Satan was always messing with me oh he Dave's probably going to go and get someone pregnant and then then that'll be your whole idea of a of you have that nice Christmas thing is going to be all messed up because you can have and he may not be with her then you're gonna have this other little kid some you're going to be a grandfather of some kid you don't really get to know much and just all this stuff you know he was saying that's the way it's going to happen you know it's not going to you're not going to get what you want but you know God will give us the desires of our heart if we say Lord I'm going to serve you and I'm going to Delight myself and you and you'll give me the desires of your heart of my heart one more this was another this is uh this this little concept here is a part of the journey too though because I've seen people one day when I was lying in bed and it was the whole fight between David and I was the fact that he didn't want to serve God and I did that that was the old that when you boil it down that was the issue one didn't want to one did so then that at a certain point down the road I because I didn't like the fractionist I thought this is not the way I I didn't stay out of family to be fractured like this and for this to be a war I didn't start it for that purpose and I don't want to be in this war I I wanted it to be together and we're just happy I'm just a nice I like things to be together and happy so there was a point where I was laying down on my bed and and then it I saw it that not that that's the problem but the issue is one wants to serve God and one doesn't so then the option came well you realize if you just compromise and just don't worry about so much stuff and just let the bars down a bit and do that then you could you guys could get on in other words go down to go to the other camper but more and then then you guys can have Unity again and that's the option that some people take they realize oh if it's going to cause a friction a husband and wife uh uh okay or I'll stop going to church as much then and I'll just I'll go there you see it's called compromise and sometimes that's the path that people take but I can assure you it never gets anywhere and but the Lord knows our hearts so in this situation here when I when I read through this verse I read through I read through for I am think not that I am come to send peace on Earth I'm not come to send peace but a sword for I am come to sit a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law and a man's foes shall be they of his own household and it dawned on me okay Lord if I'm going to serve you and if it cost me this then it cost me this now that sounds like a harsh decision but that's the decision I made Lord oh well yes I can see it's because I want to serve you he doesn't there's going to be a sword okay then there'll be a sword that sounds harsh but that's the choice I made okay Lord if that's what it's going to be I read this and then you warn me you might come into a situation where this is going to happen what are you going to choose and he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me he that lover son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me when it dawned on me that this was happening and that I had the choice to make in here I said Lord that's it then there's a sword and I was happy well then there'll be a sword you understand I was content I could live with the sword for the rest of my life Lord that's what you said it would be no I didn't want a sword but I was I accepted it does that sound harsh that's because that's what you should do if you come in the same situation you may come on this point in the road I'm just saying on this junior you may come here thankfully the Lord took away the sword because he's true to his word okay and we and and I you know we stand our ground for the Lord and the Lord fights our battles and he he makes things his way now I'm gonna just go through a few of these then I'm going to be done okay but I want to touch on this right because this is another we can't just pretend nothing happens and it's not hard you heard the saying One Bad Apple spoils a bunch you know that one bad thing amongst the group it just look at this apple it's rotten and it started to spread through all the rest I'm not gonna I'm not gonna come out and say that if someone in the church starts to go if a young person starts to go a certain way it does cause trouble that's the reality of it right we can't pretend oh no no it does start to do this right now that's an issue now it's not an issue that we want to deal with but sometimes we get forced with this issue well uh brother so-and-so's kid is um you're not doing so well and uh you hear what he said to the other girl there the other day at church or you know when they start to now that's reality so and it's a hard situation because they these things do happen in a fellowship and and I want to put it like this I'll just show I'll put it here I need to explain those situations just so everybody knows that it's a bad situation okay and there's no perfect option nothing you choose the best of a bunch of bad options or the lesser of two evils do I let my children go with them do I not none of the situation one's not right one's not right they're both they're both not good don't go into it thinking oh what's the perfect thing to do there is no perfect thing you're a negative territory it's very important you understand this if you have to go through this leave everything there when you get out of it because there's no right in this situation this is very important to understand this like oh well you know when I was Baxley and silento didn't let their children with me so maybe they knew that their children at that point were a certain way they're like I just I just can't take the risk other families like now my child's fine yeah go on go on to them but you need to understand there is a this is happening okay so you can't deny that's happening and we've all got to be understanding in this situation some parents are happy with this other ones are not they're not right or they're not wrong you know that's important that we talk about this because it's it's like and you can't look back and think wow and analyze the situation later on Everyone likes to do that you know like uh something goes wrong in a game and they've got it happened in a split second moment and yet people have got weeks to talk about that moment that people have to make Split Second decisions Okay so and you've even heard some preachers say oh they they should have let their children go with them well no I think even the parents need to be honest like I liked Shannon Shannon's stance was she told the people no no actually don't bring your kids around my place at the moment sorry but he said no Dave's not doing so well and I just it's not a very nice atmosphere I'd rather you just didn't you know did you know that okay but thanks for going through that Dave because this is this is you know this is we can talk about it and we can say Hey you may end up in that situation and you as a parent need to say hey look guys you know yeah the reality is sorry at the moment I know I know God's gonna come through there's a bit of a Bad Apple going on here and I wouldn't want you know if your child's a bit you know if the and the transition too we don't want a big pile up on the corner that's just maybe you know don't think if they don't let their child around the oh well that's it you mustn't you don't love me no what's the best option they're all bad options you've got to be very gracious just go look whatever you want yep do it this way do it that way okay you've got to be very gracious and and this the and it's like when people I just want to labor on this one last but when when when Financial stuff falls apart when it's all gets into negative territory there's no good option everything's bad just accept it as being bad don't think I need I'll take that five dollars and listen nitty-gritty hey everything's bad man let's just try and wrap it up move on who cares there's no good option right and so it's very important that in this situation and every situation is different one child you may think yeah I like that other another child you're like oh no I don't really want you to go around there it's just or another one you might think no I really feel that you should go and okay but be gracious if that happens parents and uni so it run on both sides the parent of that child needs to say look hey this is acknowledge this is the situation and this is a challenge other parents will have and vice versa okay because if you and don't don't think anything negative about that ideally what we want are two uh two children that love the Lord serve the Lord of meat together Fellowship praise the Lord that's perfect right this other stuff's not perfect so don't expect this gonna be perfect it's it's not there's going to be challenges accept it do what you feel you've got to do don't judge someone else because they did this or that just okay because we're all Christians and we all just want to make it through but we all don't really know what we're doing we're just trying to serve the Lord the best we can right that's how let's see I actually was trying to find this one before I'm almost done we've got about five more minutes okay I actually was looking for this one you know here's the appearance and there's the Young The Young new parents thinking I'm going to do this way better than my parents did and then you kind of do the first one this way hey then and then you realize oh man I shouldn't have done that so you do you pendulum swing and do the other one the other way and then you're like wow they're actually different I should have done that to that one that to that one you're like you spend your whole life trying to figure it out then it's finally all over and you're like man I'm just getting this sorted out you know and but the reality is parenting is a bit like gardening and people are like a garden when they're small you can sort of just walk through the Garden Walk Through open the gate and weed you know we weed we we try and keep the bad things out and grow the good things because we have access when they're small we have access to their mind and we can allegedly come and go as we please in the children let us in but you know some children just after a while close the gate all right I'm good other children just leave the gate open yeah come on what do you see well that eventually we want God in there working right because we as parents are trying to do all this and that but we say you know eventually we're like Lord you just I I'm not good at gardening board I've tried my best can you now take over and start gardening that area Garden them Lord and just and see when that happens everything the garden's going to turn out all right you know when that turns out like that but but hey at some point the the child may just stop letting you in and you you try and get in as much as you can you do everything you try and coerce him you're trying all these things you just can't get in and then you see we've grown you're like no weeds are growing uh let me in now you're not coming in that's all right it's not all right but sometimes that's a we do our best okay but when we pull out to the bigger picture we want God in there and all of us believe us for every one of everyone here we want God in your life that's what we want I think God was gracious to us because even Billy Paul turned away isn't it amazing isn't it amazing that the prophet of God's son was started to smoke cigarettes you think man of all the things you know it's like your dad's a prophet you're you're just you've seen Angels you've seen all this stuff and yet you imagine what brother brown felt how human he must have felt when he saw a vision isn't that amazing at a prophet saw a vision and then the vision it's his son smoking like a very spiritual occasion and there's his own son smoking a cigarette what it's it's an oxymoron so such opposite it's like man it's but you know and then we then we hear the story of um Rebecca you know you hear the story of Rebecca how she you know that wanted to play that they probably were playing Beatles songs or whatever and then she came home played on the piano because the music teacher was teaching her and then the mum didn't like it and and you know and she said and Rebecca just said to him mum what do you want me to stay here and be a Wallflower all my life and slam the door and walked out and you know and the the brother Brown was like well I'll show here I should get my belt off and you know get it pull it back from the yard and you know force that gate open I'm gonna weed this Garden you know but in that situation with Billy Paul he said you've got to make a choice you do that you're out make a choice there's one way or the other you're going to carry on you're out to stand on my Ministry you can't stay here but with that's interesting with her he said just love her just just say it's all right we're going to love you anyway everything's all right he said he actually applied different ways to different right there's another daughter called Sarah you never hear anything about Sarah Sierra probably was just one of those people that just sort of drove around the track afterwards you don't hear about Sarah but they they have a variety that's just how it works I'm just going to I'm going to wind this up thanks for listening and thanks that I could thanks for letting me share this this thought with you um I'm going to read really fast okay this is about the token this is now pulling out and saying what what is ours then when we pray we must have the token present with our prayers as I said and now I believe for ourself and apply the token to our whole family like in Egypt Jericho or either an acts 16 31 which was the Jailer we find out that Paul told the Roman Centurion believe thou and all thy house shall be saved apply it to your family if you've got an unsaved child lay the token right on top of him say Lord God I claim him stay right there if you've got a mother or a loved one that's lost lay that token on them say Lord God I claim it but there's always a I would say a catch I need to read this as well but you all do this anyway right you're all believers you can claim all this move out move out all of the worldly trash out of your house get get ready for it burn up your shorts throw your card tables away get rid of your cigarettes dump your unbelief and your church papers in the trash can where they belong amen then you're getting ready then what what do you do then apply the token and prayer with real evidence real Faith apply it apply it with confidence when you apply the token know that you are cleaned up if a house condemn us not then we have our request see as long as you people are doing them things that's wrong how you're going to ask God to do anything for you when you know you're wrong that's the reason why we just stagger up and stagger back I'm not saying this to hurt I'm saying this to straighten out to get things right how are you going to build it up voted upon the Charles of a Sodom and Gomorrah come back associations and ministers have let the people do anything and get by and just put their name on the book and call them this that and the other when it's a disgrace and it's got so that faith is something that's not even don't even very seldom ever know what it even is because they've got nothing to really anchored into they've got to Hope but not a faith you've got to get back to everything back to everything is combed out and cleaned then take your token that you know that it's Jesus Christ then you then apply it if something don't happen there's something wrong go back again get the wrong thing in your got the wrong thing in your hand he promised that he was the one who promised it apply it read Ephesians 2 12. if you're wishing you'll find out there I needed to read that because this is not so he was in a place where you know the it's the denominations were going all over the place I need to say this don't beat yourself up too hard because I believe we're Believers and we're actually living that way you know like you know we uh I know your lifestyle but I had to include that in the quote because you've got to preach the word of God and that's why I said at the start the the jailer he was actually a just man and he was serving God as much as he could and it says Hey thine arms have come from Memorial before God yeah I I actually have respect for your life and honor I want to bless you this lady here this is um sister Hattie right her children weren't serving the lord but I believe she loved the Lord and she was every day saying Lord can you just do something for them and help them but the brother Branham said when he was speaking the boys were just over in the other room snickering and sort of carrying on and joking around and not much into it but when she when then when brother random was speaking she said that's nothing but the truth he's in there just enjoying the presence of God and then that's when the Lord said to you who ask whatever you want and you'll get it and it was the salvation of her children and her boys at that moment repented that shows it's God she would have tried a lot of effort before that but it was God I'm almost done here this is another one that little fella the other night about 14 years old our pastor brother Neville he had his hands on I'm praying for him the cutest little thing now this one here brother Ed Dalton seen that happen he was praying for his children now brother and helped brother Branham a lot in the ministry he was was around places helping him out really loved the Lord you could you could see love the Lord and he said when they went outside he was praying for his children he Brethren said I got outside and he turned back around and the Holy Spirit said speak for Ed's children and I said brother Dalton the Holy Spirit tells me by that same gift that we're looking to be perfectly manifested soon I give you your children in the name of Jesus Christ and when I got when he got home near his daughter and son already gave the house to Christ just a few miles down in the country from me and I think every one of your children are saved and filled with the Holy Spirit and you know is that right brother Dalton there's there any of them here with you I had one daughter was that the one that was saved right away the oldest daughter was saved the next morning and every one of his children is now saved how the Holy Spirit When God says anything he keeps his word now how could I have saved those children see it's not your own words it isn't your own thinking it's ever what's inspiring you and if God's uh and if it's God then it's God's word see um and if you'll just believe it then that's all you have to do just believe it that's brother Dalton what effort did he put in he just believed right we're almost there we'll just sing one song then we'll close the cakes finish at nine that's the that's that's the role myself imposed rule the sister says just pray I have six children that I and I ask God to heal and save God Of Heaven grant that her six children that she desires be saved she has heard the testimony of brother Dalton his lovely daughter she desires her six children father may she have them may they meet here in the land where there is no night safely protected and sheltered by the blood of Jesus Christ amen two more and I'll tell you what I want to do you know this is a ladies talking to brother Brandon she said Noah took his whole family in with him and I want my whole family and they they have a little conversation that says my husband his brother and says yes yes and then he said you know he told the Roman when he pulled a sword to kill himself up at Philippi when he was in jail and the earthquake shook the jail down he said believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and thy house shall be saved did you ever hear that thigh and thy house now look if you have faith enough for salvation for yourself can't you also have faith enough for your house God in the same way will do it then he says and Lord I pray for sister Spencer and brother Spencer tonight that every child them and their children will all be in that glorious Happy Land where there will be no sickness or no old age no sorrow or disappointments and all this little life here will fade into a nightmare that's passed by may they receive this May and may all of her children and your husband and your loved ones and all that love her and all that she loves may they be with with her in Jesus name amen one more now but it was such a great thing that the inheritance how it was that an inheritance in the land that no one else could but a close Christmas Kinsmen could redeem but that inheritance and that this is he talks about inheritance and he's saying inheritance for a mother now let me just drop a little token here that I touched on the other night to you mothers how many hearers prayed for your loved ones lost all right there you are again see your inheritance Paul told the Roman said believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thy house shall be saved if you've got faith enough for your own self to be saved have faith enough no matter how Wayward that boy is or that girl is they'll be saved anyhow God somehow if he has to lay them on their back laying there in a hospital dying they'll be saved God promised that the inheritance oh and they shall be there said ozai and all The Offspring with them they shall not hurt or destroy in my Holy Mountain saith the Lord one more if you can believe for yourself you can believe your house also have enough faith in God to believe for yourself then believe for your children also the same faith will save your children that saved you if you just keep praying gobble answer prayer don't worry just ask him and believe it and get it anchored in your heart and just keep moving on that's the way it's done yes sir there's a whole lot more but
