saints it is a tremendous time to be living in and it is a great honor to be standing here before you amen and tonight we will go straight to the word and we'll just trust in the lord to deliver the message and i will yield to him and let him have his way and so i just encourage you to let your needs be made known to the lord now and and if there is an amen corner somewhere over there that they can at least unmute a couple that would be very very nice hallelujah so amen thank you brother ben for this opportunity really appreciate the um the this opportunity and i just love you all and just want to give god the glory and if we can turn in our bibles right now to matt you 11 verses 28 to 30. amen i want to speak a little bit tonight on a subject um as the lord leads around the thought of rest amen who who enjoys the rest of god amen hallelujah you just wave your hands if you enjoy god's rest hallelujah amen and and whether the subject around that that i feel is the burden of the spirit is staying in god's rest amen entering and staying in his rest and amen and we'll go into that what that actually means hallelujah and what context so if we can just read now as everyone there matthew 11 28 to 30. great all good i can see everyone's already and and and waiting so he says here jesus to his disciples and to everybody he says come unto me all ye that labor and a heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer lord jesus father this is your word father and we believe father that that invitation is just as real now lord jesus as it was father when you spoke it and father it is an invitation for humanity to to to to find rest to find peace to find calm in the storm to find an anchor to build their lives on a rock of revelation lord to to to be rescued father from turmoil and storms and and unstability lord and and to find rest and to be lord settled at heart and lord i pray that tonight lord jesus that but what you've placed on my heart lord would be revealed and it would just be expressed lord i yield myself to you and just pray that you would utilize lips and ears and hearts this morning of this evening lord and may we just have fellowship lord around the the shed blood of our great king's sacrifice and lord we we just believe tonight lord that it is a finished work and we can enter in lord you've made a way lord you paid the penalty of sin you paid it in full and now lord you're saying come to me for i'll give you rest and i'll give you peace and i'll change your situation and i'll oh i'll arrange it all you just just trust in me oh lord we trusting in you tonight we're looking unto you jesus and we're saying we trust you and and we're looking to you lord for our rest and we're looking lord to maintain rest as we walk this earth and as we father lord carry the spirit and flesh lord jesus that's subject to all sorts of variables and situations and our past and and all of these things that come against us lord and the enemy and how he would seek to pull us down and and destroy our lives and destroy our experience lord but he cannot take our soul he cannot get into that anchor and take us out of our rest but lord truly father lord there is an element of a fight that we must fight lord as we're resting in you and father we believe that you've got the sword you've got this covered you've finished the work and you fight our battles this is how we fight our battles lord and father i just pray lord tonight lord you would speak to our hearts in the name of jesus christ bless your word lord amen hallelujah god bless you saints if you're standing you may be seated hallelujah is there anybody here that has an amen amen do i hear i hear rustling going on somewhere in there i'm sure there's somebody that's got a microphone amen hallelujah amen oh i can hear somebody amen hallelujah so tonight i just have a little thought here it's called staying in god's rest and hallelujah it just came to me about two weeks ago um and i just want to read now the same verse um from it's matthew 11 29 but it's actually out of the um the the apostolic um polyglot which is the literal formation of it without you know changing anything for english purposes and so it says here and it just will illuminate a little thought here um that's very important um for entering into rest amen i want to just go through a bit of entering into god's rest and and the benefits of god's rest and then i want to talk about uh as the lord leads um how you know there is an element where the devil will use our past against us and will use our weaknesses and things that are in our life that against us to pull us out of the experience of what our rest the fullness of it and all of its benefits to try and bring us out of that and he cannot take us out of our soul but he can certainly trouble us in our spirit and trouble us and our mind and trouble us in our flesh because those parts are subject to the fall amen so in this verse it says here now it's this is 11 29 so it says here lift my yoke upon you and not just take my yoke see taking is a verb it's a doing word it's an action but here it actually refines it slightly to say lift my yoke upon you you see many times in the in the altar call in the prophet's message he would he would he would say you know raise your hand if you want to give your life to god lift your hand stand up there needs to be an action and he says there's some spirit that's driving you to do that because gravity will hold your hand on the floor but something's causing you to lift your hand and you're making an action towards something and in this case an action towards giving your life to god and here jesus is saying you need to take action you need to take action towards this promise that i've made for you and i say this to you all and to anyone that would hear this that there is a definite action that you need to and put in place and to act upon the promises of god we are to act upon this call of jesus christ saying come to me all that you labor in a heavy laden who's burdened who's just troubled in their heart and troubled in their mind and tossed to and fro and and struggling in many different fronts lift my yoke upon you he says lift it raise your hands stand up get out of your situation come towards the promise make an action towards the promise that i am going to give you rest i want to enter into your life deep into your life and change the things about you so that you can reflect me amen amen amen lift my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am gentle and humble in the heart and you shall find rest for your soul you see now the lord is dealing with the very heart of the believer he's saying i will give you an anchor of rest in your soul you come to me and find rest you cease from your works as god ceased from his and we'll get into that a little bit later you enter into this rest and you take a step back from the leadership of your own life and stop yielding to your own will and your own ambitions and your own dreams and and and surrender them and let and let me lead you you will then find rest to your soul because the headship you see now this there's a beautiful picture of lifting his yoke upon you amen it says that the government is upon his shoulders and you see the yoke is a two two part thing it's him and you and you come into it he becomes your head and you come under his yoke you lift his yoke upon you and you come under the covenant of his leadership of his government of his husbandry you see he wants you to yoke up with him he wants to be your leader he wants to be the strong one in the yolk you see in a yoke of ops and they have a bar or however it looks and if i was brother isaac i'd probably have a good old picture up there but you know it didn't quite happen this time but um you see in in a yoke you have um in a typical yoke you have two um option per row and so the lord is saying come and join my row come and lift my yoke upon you my burden's not going to overbear you my yoke is easy hallelujah and he's saying let my headship come upon you the government's on my shoulders so why don't you just now enter and take this promise and and find rest for your soul now the soul when it finds rest and he comes to live inside you through the baptism of the holy ghost and you see you completely yielding to him now and the government and the care is upon his shoulders and god becomes totally sovereign in your life who knows what it's like to have god sovereign in their life if you don't know what it's like to have god sovereign in your life you have never really had joy you've never really had peace you've never really tasted truly tasted and experienced heaven in your soul you might have had anointings you might have had wonderful experiences you might have had thrill rides and fizziness and all sorts of different ideas and things and great things but unless he's become sovereign unless he's become the king unless his government is upon his shoulders and you've taken that yoke upon you they tasted nothing yet and it's beyond anything you could ever dream anything you could ever imagine it's the greatest and you see even as we read through the message and we and we and we and we go through the church age book and we we talk about and we read about who's read about the key of david yeah see the key of david and i think this is a very beautiful picture because the key of david if you look at what god promised david in david is the promise of heaven and david is the promise of of of of of the throne and david the davidic covenant and if you go read that you'll enjoy it and you'll have a good time regarding the access and he promises david that your son shall sit on my throne forever and and and the millennium is under the throne of david and and there's an access granted you know you go out to a high security gate and you you've got the key and you and you click the key amen and and it says and it goes green and it says you can enter and something goes click hallelujah you get the door you get a revelation hallelujah and the key to the door is open and all of a sudden you get access to everything that is inside amen and so the key of david is divine access into heaven and not just when you get a body change but now now it's an access that as god becomes sovereign in your life as you truly deny yourself and enter into this rest and he becomes the headship and the government comes over your life that you are willing as the bride who knows the picture of the jewish wedding and and she takes the veil and she places it on his shoulders and it shows that he now they're shutting together in the secret place and and and he becomes the headship and it's a great beautiful love relationship and it's and and and it's completely his sovereignty and his leadership and the son of god becomes the very keeper of your life and and the son of god the second adam is now coming into your garden and he finds the garden a terrible mess you see but when he comes in it's a terrible mess and if you haven't had him come in you may think that your life is all good but inside it's a terrible mess because you see the only way for your garden the only way for your land for your life to be cleaned up and to be worked by the true husbandman is when you truly find rest is when you cease from your works so that god can come in and be sovereign and he wants sovereignty he doesn't want 99 percent he wants 100 sovereignty in your life and he's calling you and he will never force you you see if you think about it he says lift my yoke upon you he says it doesn't say i'm gonna place my yoke on you it doesn't say i'm gonna lift it for you it's saying lift my yoke upon you raise your hand defy gravity stand up enter in come across come out go be on the camp and enter into the fellowship come there's a promise that's hanging over your life there's a promise to enter in there's a promise of life for you right now to come and have stability and come and have life under the baptism of the holy ghost to truly find rest so the son of god can come into you and begin to work your life begin to create an edenic condition within you because this is the prerogative this is the will of god that he would take a vile old sinning heart and he would turn it into something beautiful he would turn to something that's worth living in he would give it a heavenly atmosphere in the soul hallelujah now when there is an identity condition within you because you have finally entered into rest and i want to speak to spirit-filled believers not just i'm not just dealing now with people that need to enter into that rest of their soul but i'm also want to speak to the people that have entered into the rest in their soul and and and yet they still have trouble and i saw a great picture about an hour ago as i was studying and praying and and and i believe the lord just showed me a beautiful picture that you see right at the beginning we have god and we have him rooted over the earth and he put the son of god the first adam he put him on the earth to till the soil now this was while god was resting and you see amen i want you to realize that you're called to enter into rest as and cease from your works as god ceased from his works and so i was taste tracing this back and i was like what happened after god ceased from his works in god's eden that he created for the first adam for the son of god under the adamic covenant what happened and and what happened and what what came about in this garden that was perfect and these people were perfect and yet there was an ability to sin and under that adamic covenant if there wasn't the grace to to to bring you back instantly like there is now and we'll get into that a little bit later because you see the first adam was god's son and yet this adam it says in the bible that through the first adam all were lost hallelujah but through the second adam all was given life hallelujah who loves the second adam tonight amen who's who's all for jesus tonight amen hallelujah this this jesus is a different son of god and he's living in your eden but back in the other eden back in the first eden we have now god resting and god plants his garden and he begins to have a family resting just like you you're resting and you've got a family and you've got a home and you're planting your garden and you're doing these things resting and the son of god's in your life and he's got it sorted and he wants to keep you sorted he wants to keep your home identic he wants to keep the atmosphere in your house real good providing you cease from your works providing you stop doing it in your own strength providing you stop using your own intellectual ability to to harness your family to to run the show but let god let the son of god the one that's gracious the one that can redeem you the one that can keep you let him be the keeper let him be the husbandman in your soul in your garden to hold you because i'm going to promise you something there is trouble coming and if it's not coming it's here amen real trouble but your soul is anchored don't be discouraged when you fail because your soul is anchored spirit-filled believer yeah hallelujah resting his god on the seventh day and he's planted a garden he's a husbandman he wants a family and he begins to start a family in this edenic condition that he made and it didn't start like that he made it like that just like you didn't start like that but he made you like that he gave you life he gave you endemic conditions his grace has brought you here oh yeah [Music] this grace is what's raised the standard in your life against all the floods of the enemy i don't even know there's trouble even though there's hardship even though you fail his grace the son of god is different from the first adam who's glad for that who's glad that the second adam in you is far greater covenant than the one under adam the first adam but you see god in his rest on the earth and the land edenic he has trouble coming the the sun that he placed in there see god now in his rest and in his time now has to come down to the earth and begin to sort out the trouble that has been created and through the fall and he begin to redeem man and so this is as far as we go this particular picture because i want to show you a picture that yes even though you're resting and your soul is anchored in a haven of rest and you're completely sealed until the day of your redemption and your spirit filled but then there will be times where just by some temptation or by some failure or some past experience there becomes a trouble in your eden a trouble that begins to pull you down it begins to break you down it begins to make you nervous it begins to tear you apart until you're struggling with all sorts of things and and and the devil comes to you and says oh you're not even a believer or you're not even filled but actually even it says there just cease from your works as god did from his see god knew that the first adam had it sorted in the garden god knew that the first adam he was keeping the earth he named the animals he moves the trees he had his title deed and he could do that and so god rested and he enjoyed his family hallelujah every night he'd come down and have fellowship with his son and with eve and his daughter and and just have a good time but you see when the trouble began to happen in the land god had to administer redemption through that trouble through in that idiotic condition to show us a beautiful picture i believe which just came to me about an hour ago that that even though your soul is anchored and there is an identity condition in your life there is still going to be trouble and there are going to be times where you need to just step back and say god i don't have the first adam in me this time he's the one that's caused all the trouble actually i do he's in my flesh and he's like that part of that old nature he's that tree of knowledge but let me declare something to you saint spirit-filled believer the tree of life is blooming in you oh louie i'm going to read a quote in a second and in your eden in that paradise that you have inside you regardless of how you feel right now regardless of your condition if you're filled with the spirit there is an identity condition birth blooming within your life because the second adam the one that can't fail the one that can bring you back the one that can pardon your transgressions hallelujah that one is inside you that's the one that can change the situation hallelujah so cease from your works as god did from his hallelujah because the difference is now god in his full measure has come down into his bride and it's that god the same god is the one that's not ceased from his works anymore god is working hallelujah he's working in your life he's working in your soul glory to god amen amen no matter where you're at you come god's provided way and you lift his yoke upon you and you say lord jesus and you mean it with all your heart oh god be sovereign in my life i want to have your yoke upon me i'm going to lift it up i'm going to put it on me and i'm going to put my veil on your shoulders lord i trust you lord jesus i'm trusting you lord hallelujah you see what happens you will enter into rest and you'll let the real true son of god begin to work in your heart begin to work in your life and then when trouble does come and when the i will call it for this case trouble in the land trouble in your promised land hallelujah because you see when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost and you enter into rest you see it is not the end of your troubles it's not the end of your your failures it's the end uh what's the word now i have to read this quote because i i love the word that the prophet use amen it's the end of you going astray under your own leadership hallelujah the prophet says it's the he says that they which have entered into his rest has ceased from their going astray hallelujah like that i'm going to claim that who claims that tonight they that have entered into his rest have ceased from going astray because you see you've been tied to your absolute you've been tied to the holiest of holies your soul has been entered into that rest but you still have a spirit and you still have a flesh and you still have a past and you still have these things that the devil will try against you all the time and it's those troubles it's those temptations it's the tree of knowledge and when you begin to yield to that tree and you begin to bear fruit for the tree of knowledge and and you you become very fruitful in in this kingdom of knowledge and education you are becoming more susceptible to the troubles and the temptations because you can only do so much this human being has only got so much capacity to to yield some dead members to so the so paul in the bible in romans 6 and i he says in this subject around there who you yield your members your arms and your mouth and your ears and your eyes and your legs your members too is to whom you obey and to whom you obey that's this is who you're yielding to what is the spirit what is it and how is it pulling you and what is the influence of it amen amen laurie so i asked this question do you really trust him amen do you totally trust him because it's very easy to trust god for most things and then hold back some things and you begin to worry about your outcome you begin to worry about your finances you begin to worry about your friendships or worry about whatever's going on in the world worrying about the unsettled times in the war but do you totally trust him have you found rest for your soul and let me tell you this the rest is not just for your soul the rest is for your spirit and your flesh the rest is a total deliverance the rest is a total healing it's a total all-encumbersome reality for you to be at complete rest and to be completely healed and to be completely free from your past and free from all the memories and free from all the troubles and the depression and the and the anxieties free completely free and you see when there's trouble god went down to eden and you begin to sort it out and he sorted out so much that now we have a redeemer living inside of us amen so how if there is a redeemer living inside of us when there's trouble in your eden when there's trouble in your home when there's trouble knocking at your door there is a son of god that is ready and waiting to raise a standard against it but the trouble and the challenge of the whole thing is are you going to do it or are you going to let him do it all right because we can figure things out and you may have a good idea but most of the time it's not the way that the lord wants to do it and i can i can put my hand up twice for that although i'm sure anyone that's honest with himself can say yep i know what that's like oh man you know because sometimes you you we have and actually there's a quote later on that says we're too we're too strong in the head oh my help me lord oh my oh let's read this quote here actually this is the quote here it says the cases with us that not that we are too weak the case is we're too strong we're just too strong he says that's all the thing of it is we're too strong-headed that's right we're too strong in our head we know too much god wants to get that out of us yeah take it out help me jesus that's right we're too strong we're too strong to yield to him i thought well that's this is this is coming right home to me we got he says we yield to ourselves now paul says this and he's speaking to spiritual believers who are struggling and getting pulled and tempted because of the their past and the religion the religious past of jew of judaism and the mosaic covenant and the law and obviously all of the um pharisaic and rabbinical uh attributes of judaism that had crept in that jesus rebuked the pharisees for he said that how bad in vain do you worship me because you're teaching the doctrine the commandments of man and they raised up the commandments of the rabbis and all of that over the word of god and and they they missed the word and so jesus rebuked them for that and yet these people true believers now paul speaking to the galatians in galatians 3 1 he he he's now addressing the galatians and he's he's basically got to rescue these people because they've allowed their past to come into the to the present and it's an old covenant it's in its and it's in it and it won't work you see because the covenant that we're under is not by works it is not by what we can do to enter in it's by what he's done and by us surrendering there's nothing else you can do other than and believe and say here i am lord i surrender all it just come a total absolute trust in him and surrender and faith in the finished work of the cross and what he did that he promised and is willing to give you the holy ghost amen you come as provided way you come according to his word and you find rest for your soul and you see the galatians had found rest and they had come as provided way and these are spirit-filled men and women that paul now god has sent paul with a burden to rescue them from coming out of god's rest in their mind and the beginning to teach the people unrestful things beginning to bring the law back in and beginning to bring works back in and and the studies of all different things and so just read this here because why i want to read this is to show you that it is possible for spirit-filled people to to not lose their salvation to not lose their souls rest but to come under a guise or a cunning craftiness or some ideology that can pull them out of actually living in their rest and and and i i'm gonna call this trouble in your land and if the devil's tempted you to go into a legalistic ideology or to begin to try and do it yourself or to introduce your own ideas or to introduce your own ability your own intellectualism your own understanding and knowledge to try and figure it out then you come to fall in this category even as a spiritual believer in the mind realm and this is the time like god when he ceased from his works he still went down and rescued his son he still went down and caused the reverse of the destruction of human beings he he changed the situation and and you see now the beautiful picture that we have here is that we have the son of god living in us right now and he's the one that when we cease from our works and maybe we get to go into something that is a little bit off or a little bit funky or we begin to get torn down in our mind about something and here is the son of god just waiting for you to say oh god here i am come back he says i'm not going to destroy you i'm not going to judge you i'm going to bring you back you see he's always willing and waiting for you to come back he's always waiting for you to make it right and just get back down and let him be the king let him be sovereign again and when he's sovereign you will taste your heavenly inheritance again you will come back into your heavenly atmosphere again and it's you don't have to earn it back you just need to make it right you don't have to try and work anything up you don't have to grovel you don't have to spend 10 hours crying and you can if you like i'm not saying you're not allowed but the moment that confession leaves your lips the moment you make it right the son of god is ready to restore heavenly access to you ready to restore that beautiful fellowship with you ready to give you all the access back to you all of the things and the first love that you had when you first got saved and you were so happy and you know that who remembers that who has that you see it's already yours it's already yours to walk it hallelujah it's just sometimes you begin to do it in your own strength sometimes you begin to figure it all out yourself and all of a sudden you find yourself out of the atmosphere and you're and there's a bit of a wilderness going on in your life but thank god for the wilderness that can teach you not to do that again not to yield to your own self again and so paul says here he says o foolish galatians who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes jesus christ has been evidently set forth crucified among you it's finished hallelujah you don't have to earn anything you don't have to be anything to be accepted you are accepted you're completely accepted you're not just accepted in christ you're accepted in the beloved hallelujah you're accepted in the family of god hallelujah you young children if there's any young children listening to this you don't have to earn your place in the circle you don't have to be something to be accepted you are accepted amongst your brothers and sisters you just accept that hallelujah amen why are you accepted because of what he did we're preaching christ crucified among you he's the one that was accepted he's the one that had to earn it he's the one that did it who believes he did it tonight who believes that our champion conquered death hell in the grave took the keys of satan raised the people out and gave us access back and that's the one that's living in you that's the one that's so concerned about everything in your life he's the one that's saying let me be sovereign he's the one that's saying come to me if you're laboring a heavy laden i'll take that off your shoulders i'll give you my yoke and you can just follow my leading you can learn of me and let my mind be in you and you can understand what it's like to be loved to be accepted to be under grace and not under the law hallelujah lord hallelujah this only what i learn of you paul says to the galatians receive ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith and i ask you shekinah tabernacle and whoever's listening received you the holy ghost by the works of the lord by the hearing of faith the hallelujah to the son of god living inside you to create your edenic condition to give you a paradise inside to give you a ticket a token a sure token of your rapture amen are you so foolish paul says to the galatians having begun in the spirit are you now made perfect by the flesh you know there is nothing you can do i can do none of us can do that will give us any cubit on our stature that will give us any um you know benefit in eternal things of the kingdom hallelujah all he's asking is that you take his yoke lift his yoke upon you and let him lead you in his purpose for your life so that you can walk in that purpose because that's the very essence that's the very thing that he has called you to do and the only way that you can truly discover that is by being yoked together with him amen amen joshua 1 13 it says remember the word which moses the servant of the lord commanded you saying the lord your god has given you rest and has given you this land you see the believer's rest is tied into the promised land israel's rest was entering into the land entering into the promise and as they entered in here comes the captain of the host down into the land to take over the battle to lead them in the wars and to give them everything that was promised by moses and joshua and everything that god promised abraham that god was there the land received god himself under the captain of the host to baptize them to baptize the land and to bring the land into rest amen hallelujah brother branham says this in adoption number two he says god by his election grace called you god by his election grace sanctified you god by his election grace and his power i like that baptize you and put you into this land of rest amen they which they which have entered into this rest has ceased from their dying astray they cease from their works like god did from his they have can you just say they have joy unspeakable and full of glory and full of glory now i want you to say i have i am joy unspeakable hallelujah this is what the prophet's saying now i want you to own this for yourself he's saying that they which have entered into this rest has ceased from their going astray which we read before they cease from their works like god did from his and both times when god ceased there was the first adam keeping the garden doing the natural things and doing the physical stuff on the earth keeping it nice keeping it under control and here we're called to cease from our works as god did from his so that god in the sun can come and live inside of us under the second adam and under that covenant of grace hallelujah hallelujah he says here so and and here i want you to think now have i got this and is this me have i got this rest that he's talking about have i got this joy unspeakable that he's talking about and am i living in this as a consistent thing i'll have my ups and downs i'll have my days but as a general in my life if i look at my life is this a reality and is this a constant thing that's going on is this a trend for for the this is like a layered descend word now is the trend of joy in your life has your life got a trend is it trending in you has your land got joy unspeakable are you full of glory are you having supernatural moments of pleasure with the lord he said he will give to those that fear him a river of joy and pleasure this is something that happens when he's sovereign and i want you to realize that the key of david unlocks that privilege for you and and it's the government the key brother branham says in the church age book go read it just search key of david and you'll just have a glorious time to understand the key of david and how it's upon his shoulders and the government is upon his shoulders and he shall be called the prince of peace because when you're resting you have peace hallelujah when you're resting you have a wonderful counsellor to cancel all your mental troubles so you don't have to go and manifest the things that's the battles that's going on in your mind he begins to work through them with you hallelujah you begin to get stabilized thank you mate i'm telling you now and we need that you can't go without that we're not exempt from it we're not exempt from any of these battles but i tell you what we have diplomatic immunity hallelujah amen we have diplomatic immunity we are um we're above now don't get me wrong i'm not trying to say we're going to be anarchists but we are really spiritually above the laws of physics and the laws of the land and the laws of all these things because what if pharaoh tries to put us under slavery by making us bondage to money and because we can't afford to live you don't have to live like that you don't have to have financial pressure you can just believe and god will provide you just work his system hallelujah and you can't cheat a system you can't fraud a system but you can certainly work it you can certainly be a giving person a cheerful giver god loves a cheerful giver amen and when he begins to see a cheerful giver in your life in you he begins to bless your life because this is the economy of god that that the people would give that have and that they that have would give and it would just begin to cycle around and there wouldn't be a in inequality it would just be all things to all men hallelujah that's the kingdom of god hallelujah i don't know how i went there but there you go amen they have joy unspeakable and full of glory amen and if i'm not there now i need to go lord why am i not there why is that i'm down why am i flat i've been flat for so long what is it don't lie to yourself and think don't let the devil lie to you and say oh that's just you that's just your makeup no no your makeup is joy unspeakable and full of glory hallelujah amen you just say that tonight my makeup is joy unspeakable and full of glory that's me hallelujah i'm not going to settle for anything less and if there's something going on i'm going to get the mind of christ in me and i'm going to go down to the eden in my life and i'm gonna meet with the son of god inside me and we're gonna have fellowship and we're gonna find out what's wrong because i've got the counsellor inside me i've got the prince of peace inside me i've got the everlasting father inside me oh hallelujah if i need to know how to be a daddy i've got the everlasting father to do to work in my life to make an e din in my life hallelujah says the lord oh do you know who's inside you saints hallelujah i just want to remind you who's inside you i want to remind you what he's able to do amen all he says is cease from your works cease from your labors cease from your own intelligence stop yielding to your own ideas and yield to me because when god came down he dealt with the first adam and he had to deal with it all but when you come down to your troubles in your own heart you've got the second adam and he's got it all under control and he just wants to tell you what to do amen and lead you through it hallelujah and he will use whatever means necessary to bring clarity for you that's why it's so important that when you're at church you're open to the lord to speak personally to you and never close or put a full stop on your troubles never put a full stop on your personality flaws never put a full stop because the wonderful delivering counsellor is inside you and he wants to change your situation he you see i want to talk about trouble in the land for a little bit you see here in the promised land just a little time after they the the land had received the captain and here's the promised people and they're in the land and the land had the the ark of the covenant in its position the captain leading the way but all of a sudden after a bit of time there was a bit of trouble in the land just like there's a bit of trouble in your land sometimes and it came to a point now in the time of eli and huffny and finney harrison here they had the ark and and they were in the land had the captain but they had lost access there was trouble in the land and they begin to go the wrong way and it was time for somebody to come down you see what can happen in the land is that even though in your own life you can be filled with the holy ghost the ark of the covenant the baptism of the holy ghost in your life and yet there can be trouble so much that you can lose that experience and and begin to get down and begin to to listen to the wrong voices until finally your experience has changed and you're going down the wrong path but you see now it didn't stay that way let me tell you tonight that not long after they had lost their experience not long after it you see god had made a way back he started to trouble the enemy's camp he started to cause all those false gods and the things that was going on dagon broke and he fell down all those idols of your past will fall down and worship they will have to they will be made to break in the presence of god even if you're in a bad condition because of the ideals of your past because of the idols of your here in the heritage that has troubled you and has brought you now trying to ruin your life and trying to tear you down tearing them from them you see the lord will cause those idols to bow before him hallelujah the lord will cause dagon as you know in the story when the ark went to the philistine camp you see now they put it into the temple of dagon and and they came in the morning and dagon this big concrete flush god was broken and bowing before the ark so they were like oh what's going on here so they put it back up and they were like oh dagon we're so sorry and then the next day it was even worse for dagon hallelujah so let me tell you you may be going through some hard times your past may be just troubling you so much sometimes let me tell you you are a spirit-filled believer and you will come forth god will cause your enemies to fall at your feet he will do it you less than that let me tell you rest little bride rest because the lord is jealous over you and he will cause those things of your past to full breakdown until the point where they have to purge it out they cannot stand it no longer because the presence of god begins to manifest in your life and let me tell you that not long after this a man a type of christ in the land david the king begin to bring it all back see god is a god of restoration and god does a proper restoration he doesn't just do a partial restoration he does a full restoration of body spirit and soul so that you can be whole so that you can worship according to the dictates of the heart of god with the mind of christ to restore you back don't put a full stop on any of your troubles because it's not over only as brother cadre preached to be continued amen see god is able to do it and all he's saying is cease from your works hallelujah amen rest because inside you is the son of god and he's the wonderful counselor he's the one the mighty deliverer hallelujah i feel like i've run across country oh man i haven't had that feeling for a while i don't know if anyone's ever had a stitch from preaching but i got one of those i guess i'm not moving you know i can't move i think i move around usually amen let me just say that yes israel had a hard time and and and yes if you look at it in the type the captain was there he'd been ushered away had been pushed out because of their behaviors and the way they were but he was still dealing he still had samuel building up he still had vision it might have been not huge in the land at that stage but it was there see god cares he's not going to let you fall away he's not sometimes you get brought right down to the very stump and and you strip down to nothing and you think everything's going wrong just like israel they had the captain they had the arkhan chalo and they had all of the the idea all of the things that moses and joshua and yet they were brought down to a stump they were brought down to nothing and this was the land of rest and god in his grace even under the blood of bulls and goats he was not going to leave that land in that condition he was not going to leave his people like that and he's not going to leave you in any inferior condition or under any complex or have the devil have anything over you because he's called you to be the head and not the tail amen he's called you to be above the devil actually he's got the devil to be under your feet and that's where he belongs they have joy unspeakable and full of glory says here the tree of life is blooming in them hallelujah praise the lord amen that you know i was i was just sitting there thinking about god resting when that whole edenic thing opened up to me about god's rest and how he had to come down and rescue the land and cause bring redemption to adam and as i was reading i was like wow that's amazing because you know we've got this eden in our life and then my my eyes went straight to that the tree of life is blooming in them it was just like a confirmation to show that there is a blooming tree of life within you and even though it's blooming there is still going to be trouble in your spirit and trouble in your flesh amen but the right person is living inside you just remember that so rest and as the days come on god knows what's going to happen and we got a a little idea of how things are going to pan out right and it's not going to be physically speaking very um assuring or these the situations are going to be very diabolical is the right word because the devil is finally getting his way he's going to just go completely crazy on the earth and it's just going to turn different but rest because he that is in you is greater than he that it's in the world amen the tree of life is blooming in them they have long suffering gentle goodness patience made of made faith meekness gentleness and so forth the tree of life is blooming in them because their hope is anchored in christ jesus the witness of the holy ghost bearing record with signs and wonders following the believers amen now if you find that there is a bit of a stop going on then there is a reason it's time to just go i'm going to punch the screen where am i tampering with the evidence what have i am i am i trying to inject my own ideas into this or and have i taken my own family or my own life down a certain path that is just off from the will of god have i reacted in a knee-jerk reaction to a situation in an emotional condition and i've caused destruction in my family or in my life where am i how lord remember who's in you remember the solution to your troubles right now the solution is within you the solution is in your heart and there is an identity condition in there and it's tied to the absolute you cannot be broken from that nothing can separate you from that love nothing can separate you from him he's the one that's just waiting for you to take the step back and go okay where are we at lord if i you know it's time to have a conference it's time to recalibrate it's time to come back to the son of god within you and find that grace to bring you back in into that step to bring you back into harmony with his purpose for you to bring you back to restore to redeem you because he's he cares about you he's mindful of you he understands you he understands the the weaknesses in you that the devil uses against you to try and bring you down to try and tear you but you see he's the wonderful counselor that can heal you and close that door so the devil can never touch it again hey man man i'm just being real plain amen the holy ghost bearing record with signs and wonders following the believers hebrews 4 9 and 10 it says there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god for he that has entered into his rest he also has ceased from his own works as god did from his amen amen hallelujah there's a few things that the devil can use against us in our humanity to pull us and to bring us into the flesh bring us into a carnal condition and one of those things is vengefulness you see if somebody pushes the right button in your life and you you get offended in a deep way then avengefulness will if you don't you know you have to be careful this is why the spirit of god is truly meek see meekness is not letting people get away with sin and injustice it's simply not meddling with god's divine system vengeance is his timing is perfected in him so why do we need to fight in our own strength to resolve a situation like that when within him as vengeance within him and true meekness understands that yes there needs to be something done about these things but let god do it let god unfold the very solution you may be part of that solution but it'll be the spirit of god leading you through it it'll be the inspiration of god's love that will push and will do guide you and and it will bring fruit for repentance it will bring restoration it will restore relationships or will resolve things in a likely manner hallelujah amen hallelujah what's the time now i've got just a couple more remarks and then we'll close a man who loves the lord hallelujah you know in the land when there's trouble in the land and there is an attribute when you read in the old testament and you read about the promised land and you read about certain stories in that land and you can relate to those stories i was reading about joab and how joab you know he had done a lot of bad things in the past who knows who joab is can everyone tell me you children does any of these young children know who joab is hallelujah does anyone know who joab is joab is the man who was the captain of david's host and you see he was a man of bravery and he was a man that could do great things but in that ambition and in joab was also a downside to that was that he always got himself in trouble and he went and did things um that he shouldn't have done and you know there was a judgments for those things under the blood of bulls and goats there was judgments for the things that joab had done and so um this was joao's past you know he was the man that when david was taking jerusalem and he was about to be you know come into his full kingship and be crowned king by all the tribes he'd just been crowned and there was unity in israel and david says whoever goes up to these gutters and um let's opens the gates for jerusalem will be captain of the lord of the host you know he'll be the captain of the army and and so this was joab he was a mighty man of valor and yet now here's this man under the blood of bulls and goats now i just want you to think about that under this covenant under this covenant of judgment for sin and there wasn't grace like there is grace now here he is now after all he had done and he had killed abner and he had killed other men that was not he shouldn't have done god's anointed people and and and done it unjustly murderous type of things and now it came to where he was being recompensed for that and you could say that we can find ourselves things that we've done in the past that we've been forgiven for and they're in the sea of forgetfulness and yet in the flesh yet in the land there's trouble and it's chasing you down and it's trying to bring you back into something that you've been delivered from that's not even in the memory of god and yet the devil tries it anyway and that's like joao he was running when solomon had become king and now all the judgments of david was being issued unto the son of david and here he is now joab he had done the wrong thing again and he had tried to get one of the other guys to be king out of niger and here he is running for his life you see his past his past was chasing him his past was about to destroy him and sometimes we find ourselves where our past or something from our heritage is trying to destroy us but it doesn't have a right under the blood of jesus hallelujah you have the blood of jesus and you you don't have to let your past destroy you you there is deliverance for you there is healing for you but you see job he's running there's trouble in the land and there's trouble and all of a sudden here he's crying on the altar of god and he's screaming for mercy or he just doesn't want to die and his past caught up with him and under that covenant he lost his life under that covenant he was destroyed but let me tell you about another covenant that you're under and no matter what the devil tries to chase you down with no matter what condemnation it will not destroy you it will not because there is a remedy there is a vaccine a real vaccine for you amen there's an inoculation amen that will bring you back there is a bomb in your billiard hallelujah there's a gilead inside you and there's bomb for you amen there if you're blind there's an anointing oil for you amen if you can't see if you've been clouded over by something of your past been chasing you down and it's trying to bring you down it's trying to tempt you and it's doing all sorts of things just remember there's i said for you to see there's bomb for you to heal hallelujah just take it take it i want everyone to say i'm taking it amen i'm taking it it's mine hallelujah oh glory well amen i just think under the law job had to die under judgment because of his past but under grace your judgment has been taken by the son of god because i'm preaching him crucified among you i'm preaching a crucified sacrifice among you who finish the work who's who's broken the power of sin who's broken the power of your past who's broken all the trouble that could ever raise up in your land in your home in your family in your spirit and in your flesh all that has been conquered it has been completely and you are healed and hallelujah all you need to do is say it's mine all you need to do is raise up defy gravity lift his yoke upon you and let him be sovereign let him trust in him for your outcome trust in him to navigate you through the uncertain times that we live in who thinks that god knows what's going to happen amen god knows what's going to happen amen and he's inside you so if the one that knows what's going to happen is living inside you i feel like you're in a really good place i believe you're in a real good position amen you have the advantage we've got the advantage saints amen it's unfair hey man you like that it's unfair we have the unfair advantage in our favor oh yeah because we've got the one that knows everything that's going to happen has already healed us from everything and has defeated the enemy on every front oh my i like that that's good odds to me who believes that's good odds i like that it's rigged it's rigged and you've already won oh there even though you're called now for a character development session oh my hallelujah it's all just for your character or just for you to appreciate how much you love him amen who loves the lord amen glory to his name amen final scripture and then we'll close just uh i just want to tie in that when you're when he's sovereign now if you if you take one thing from this whole thing you've lifted the yoke on your on you his yoke and you're connected with him by marriage and he's leading you and he's sovereign and you're completely totally trusting him and now you've got the key of david open heaven to you so you're fully in his joy um and and this is the access through his sovereignty this is where full and free access lies is when the god that lives in you that's not in the question right now for the spirit-filled believer it's are you completely letting him be sovereign and completely submitting to that sovereignty and trusting in them regardless of what's happening completely totally trusting and resting in his promise resting in his ability in his management in his governing he's the greatest king he's the greatest governor there is no one like him and he has got it all under control and you see this is where you you completely trust in no matter what and here you have this beautiful situation where even though it's crazy unvariable and dark all around you have a beautiful edenic condition within you and it's your inheritance amen and you and that there is is what i'm meaning here now as we read this john 15 7 to 11. it says if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be to my disciples as the father has loved me so have i loved you continue ye in my love if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love these things everyone say these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full see it's tying together your experience of joy in amongst storms and amongst everything that's going on because believe me right now this is not work as bad as it's going to get for society for the world and you know before we get taken off the earth there is going the need for you to rest because right now you know you you work and you go and you rely on monetary system and you've got all these comforts of this you ain't gonna have that soon let me just tell you now it's gonna be stripped away and the tree of knowledge is going to be stripped away and you're going to have no access to it for a season before the rapture and it's going to be like it was for the church when they were hunted down and they were under the the full leadership of the angel of the lord and they were traveling by thought and and they were in divine love and then all of a sudden the saints of all the past will begin to raise up and you'll see them and you'll be caught up hallelujah there it's going to change and so leading to that is going to be a tough time physically speaking it's going to be a time where you're ready for it because you see the one that's living in you it will make you ready it actually says that she made herself ready how did she do it there was trouble in her land and she came down to the eden in her own life and had fellowship with the son of god that is the gardener of her own heart that is the one that's keeping her the one that's tilling your soil right now saints the one that is the husbandman that turned a filthy dark earth without form and void into a beautiful garden inside you amen oh yeah that's it god bless you brother ed all glory to god give him praise amen hallelujah oh
