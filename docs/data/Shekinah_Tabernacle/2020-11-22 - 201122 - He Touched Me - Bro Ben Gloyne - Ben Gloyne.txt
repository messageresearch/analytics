to 13 and then we're going to go to Luke 8 and we're going to read there as well I mean I trust everyone's had a good week and the Lord's been good and undertaken and guided you and kept you and amen may the Lord just bless you today and amen we love each other eh you know we're going to make it I mean we're in this together praise the Lord hey man what a day that'll be remember on the other side Hallelujah amen you know we've got the down payment of that already the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen amen Luke 5 and 10. and uh and so I was also James and John the sons of Zebedee which were partners with Simon and Jesus said unto Simon fear not from henceforth thou shall catch men and when they had brought their ships to land they first saw called and followed him that's a good thing to do and it came to pass when he was in a certain city Behold a man full of leprosy who sing Jesus fell on his face and besought him saying Lord if thou wilt thou cast make me clean and he put forth his hand and he touched him saying I will be thou clean and immediately the leprosy departed from him amen then we just go a couple of chapters over to Luke 8 and um from verse 43 to 48 here this is the woman with the uh blood issue here I know it's a familiar um story but uh with this just where we are so Luke 8 and and 43 and a woman having an issue of blood 12 years which has spent all her living upon Physicians neither could be healed of any came behind him mean touched the border of His Garment and immediately her issue of blood staunched and Jesus said who touched me when all denied Peter and they that were with them saying Master the multitude throng thee and press thee and sayeth thou who touched me and Jesus said somebody hath touched me for I perceive that virtue has gone out of me and when the woman saw that she was not hid she came trembling falling down before him and she declared unto him before all the people for of course she had touched him and how she was healed immediately it's good to give a testimony and he said unto her daughter be of good Comfort thy faith has made thee whole go in peace amen praise the Lord let's just uh bow heads in a word of prayer you have a need this morning he's going to raise it before the Lord an uplifted hand amen let's pray together let's join our faith together for this meeting dear God we thank you so much we can come

leadership sure we can rest in your provision rest in your comfort and your guidance Lord we love you so much we thank you Lord you take the service over now dear God For Your Glory anoint each one we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may have your seats uh this morning I want to take a subject about he touched me you know when you think about what God has done it makes you happy eh makes you makes you rejoice it makes the burns of life just just kind of go to one side and amen because we really have a perspective about what God has done for us you know it really brings everything into perspective you know where you know it's one thing for you we read a couple of accounts there where where the Lord It's amazing when God touches someone you know I was thinking about that song and I put it in the queue we'll sing it maybe at the end he touched me and all the joy that flood my soul something happened and now I know he touched me and made me whole you know there's something about how you can never really fully describe what happened when he touches you when he changes your life you know um you know we watched a few I'm not putting a plug in for this but you know if you watch it good but you know we watched a few uh episodes of The Chosen and one of the First episodes was with Mary Magdalene and you know she's possessed with those demons and Nicodemus couldn't do anything he had no power just having a dead formal religion but then Jesus came her way and and and and after those demons that came out of her she's a totally new person and your Nicodemus was um you know came and found her to see really what happened and you know you know she just said you know I was one way and then he came and now I'm another way you know and it's the same thing with you and I I trust when you've really met the master you're one way maybe you're religious maybe in the world maybe whatever more just sitting in a message Pew you know knowing all the doctrine in your head but not knowing him but then he came and now you're another way where the word is a reality he's a living reality in your life you know so but you know yeah I know that was just drama but we could never really describe what happened you know brother Brown would speak about the third pull and when he was talking about the third poll you know he'd speak about the three manifestations of his ministry the first one where he take the People by the hand he'd see what was wrong with them by uh bumps and things which would happen in his hand he'd tell them what's wrong Faith would rise he'd pray for them they'd be healed and then the second phase was Ministry where he'd be able to discern the thoughts and Tents of the hearts of the people he'd call people out by name addresses and specific things you know call them out what was wrong and then we know that was the high priest being revealed through the prophet but then the third pull of his ministry was a was it more of a mysterious thing because he tried to explain those gifts you know the manifestation of God to the people and it just caused a lot of carnal impersonations but when he saw a vision of the third pull he said it was like a a wooden building on the platform a little wooden building it was like a big massive Church there's a wooden building and people would would would would line up one by one they'd gone to this wooden room and they'd walk out they came and crippled or maimed or whatever in wheelchairs and things they'd walk out totally whole and a and a person would be standing if they came through and they you know she'd ask them what happened to you in there and they said I don't know but something happened and brother Graham said you know the pillar of fire said I'll meet you in there and so it's a mysterious thing when God changes someone because it can't be it can't be you know it can't be manufactured it's not like one testimony has to fit everyone you know we don't have to have all the same kind of testimony the main thing is he meets you and when he meets you he doesn't just anoint you but he lives in your life and he changes you forever where once we were maybe walking life spiritually crippled spiritually hope maybe people had to literally pack us amen around we're spiritually Dead We once were dead and trespasses and sins but then we came into that little room we had a we had a one-on-one meeting with God himself and God touched us amen that's incredible we think any you know because that leper said if thou will and you think about who he came to he didn't just come to a prophet he didn't come to a religious leader he didn't come to one of the scribes of the Pharisees or whatever more but he came to the very Messiah God made flesh and there he was he says if thou will here's the Fountain of healing the Fountain of restoration the Fountain of eternal life he says if thou will you can make me clean and of course the Lord's or you're the Lord's heart is I will he came in faith and he and Jesus touched him see it's one thing for us to touch him but it's one thing for him to touch us now we know when both happened when faith when faith gets a hold of him something's got to happen amen and when he touches us well something's got to happen I remember when he touches us there's a purpose for it he doesn't just change our lives and then we just kind of wander on haphazard but he puts us on a road he puts us on a path now this word touch here it means to properly this from the Strong's Concordance it means properly to attach oneself that is that is that is to touch so so when the Lord touches us he actually attaches himself to us it's not just a touch like this he actually attaches himself where where it's no longer just us walking alone but it's us and him walking together amen and the and the and the root meaning or the reflexive uh reflective reflexive of this word is to properly fasten two and that is specifically to set on fire I mean so when he touches someone he sets them on fire they don't start they don't understand some religious Christian culture wandering along but something happens where a flame of Eternal God steps into that person's life and they're not just dormant but you know a potential but it's actually a manifestation of God where where all the words you know brother Brahm says it's like the word can just lay in someone's life all the right teaching and the right approach to God the white rated dress all these different things all the teaching of the scripture can be laying there but it's like a candle it can be a perfect candle the wick can be perfect the you know you know the wax can be perfect and and you can know all all about how bright it can shine but once it's lit that's the thing that makes a difference and it's the same thing with you and I we can have the word laying in us all your race and you know Sunday school incredible teachers in there can teach us incredible things that you know we can hear incredible sermons but it takes the lighting of the candle a fire experience where God where God touches you and sets you a flame Hallelujah and from that moment we are never the same Now isn't incredible I was I was thinking about this this phrase you know I get phrases jumping to my into my heart as I'm thinking about you know surfaces and so on and and and one of my favorite chapters in the whole Bible is Ephesians chapter 2. that's my chapter I love your the whole book is incredible but I love chapter two and uh there's a there's a phrase where where in in verse 12 maybe we'll start reading from verse 10 here um he says now for we are his workmanship praise God Hallelujah I'm under construction but it's not some construction company that's going under you know that's that's way behind schedule way over budget no no I'm on time I'm under budget Hallelujah and there's no half you know you know there's no remedial work what God does is perfect right and he does it perfectly every time amen where his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them so God ordains he you know it's hard I find it hard to start somewhere and stop somewhere in the scripture because really we'd just start from Genesis 1 1 and have a good time all the way to the amen at the end but even you know and especially this chapter too because I love the first part of it but you know so so we're God God ordained that we should walk in Good Works but he had to touch Us in order for us to do so wherefore remember that ye and times past Gentiles In the Flesh you are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision and the flesh made by hands now that at that time now this is the phrase that jumped into my heart that at that time we were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of Promise having no hope and without God in the world now some people will take this as a dispensational thing that well before Calvary we're without the covenants of Israel we were aliens from the household of God all those things but to me yes that is true but to me this is a personal scripture because it was once a time when I was having no hope and without God in the world one time in life I had no hope you know what happened you know I remember when I was about 18 had you know totally lost in the world and we were living in American Samoa and a and a hurricane came through came around the South part of the island and where my parents lived it was it was like lava you know a big lava shelf and there's about this much soil so when this hurricane came through you know all the trees blew blew over apart from the coconut trees and so the next morning um I had this blunt machete and I had to cut my way through our driveway so my dad could get on his motorbike and go see if his work was still intact because it used to manage he used to be a engineer chief engineer at a tuna Cannery and so he had to go see if the place was still standing because you know you'd look at the island afterwards and then you know you see a valley like just so here on you know the side of Stokes Valley one side of the of the hills was just twigs and the other side is looks like totally untouched and people lost lost roofs all kind of things happened I'd never been in a storm where there's been so much noise and so much water in the air and anyway I'm cutting my path you know a path through these Fallen trees because everything fall over apart from the coconut trees it's still gusting I don't know how much and there's all these coconut trees and you know coconut trees have coconuts and coconuts are hard and they're up there and it's gusting like crazy and you know all I could do was sing every every every hymn that I heard you know you know at church I mean I mean I mean at boarding school of the chapel but I had no hope I was scared that these coconuts one of them's gonna I'm gone I'm still here but you know what I mean but you know but I had no hope I had no assurance that if a coconut hit my hit my skull you know my next moment I'm in glory I had nothing I was without God in the world but that was at that time I remember there came a time when he touched me Hallelujah where where God came on the scene and it's incredible thing you know where you think he can do it but then after he's done it amen where our faith Rises and God comes and touches you and changes your life amen so there came a time that at that time see we were without Christ and I trust this is your testimony but now you're not without Christ you're with him in the world Amen that you're not an alien from the Commonwealth of Israel you're not a stranger from the covenants of promise but you've become one with that Covenant of promise and you don't have no hope but you have hope and we know Bible hope is not hope like I hope something's going to work out but Bible hope means an expectation with pleasure so you have an expectation I know my redeemer liveth I'll stand that day with him upon the Earth amen so those skin worms the saw this flesh yet in with this in this flesh with these eyes I shall see God Amen and we're not without God in the world but we're with him he said I'll never leave the nor forsake thee Hallelujah so to me that's an incredible thing Hallelujah that one time I was without God but now I'm with him I was once shut off from him without hope but now I have hope amen so now there's moments in life where that they greatly impact us yeah and and this is not just even with God this can just be in the world people get impacted by moments I remember when I was sitting in fourth form uh science class and and the teacher drew a diagram of an atom on the board that impacted me because I ended up studying science at University being in that field but you know but you know it can be a it can be a moment like that it can be words it can be an atmosphere it can be a song you know all those things are moments that can touch someone's life and put them on a path now if you take that in the natural but we are we can we can take it into the into the supernatural enter the Eternal you know Abraham who became Abraham was like any other ordinary man until God called him that's what made the difference he wasn't special he wasn't richer than everyone else he wasn't smarter than everyone else he didn't have the best family than anyone else he was an ordinary man he was a Joe average but then God called him and that's what made him special that's what made the difference it's the same thing with you and I there's nothing special about us some people are looking at me like hold on we're just like anyone else if you think you're more special than the next guy you've got it all wrong it's the grace of God that saved you it's the grace of God that found you it's the grace of God that keeps you amen we're not special anyone else it's just God found us that's what made the difference amen we had nothing that too married what he has done for us amen there's nothing that we have in our personality it's not like I like this personality I don't like this one so I'll save this one no it doesn't work that way God is Sovereign in his election and is choosing amen so Abraham was like anyone else but God called him and that's what made the difference now it's amazing when you think it's just such a small phrase in the scripture now the Lord said unto Abraham get the out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from my father's house into a land that I'll show thee and I'll make thee a great nation I'll bless thee it'll make thy name great and thou shall be a blessing and I'll bless them that bless them curse thee that curse him that curses thing and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed now I'd know how long that took me to read it wasn't very long but that moment that moment when God's word touched Abraham changed his whole life change it from living in the you know or the child is whoever he was living in that time maybe an idolater or whatever he was and may to put him on a path to walk with God that's how powerful when God's word touches you and I am amen it changes our whole life it puts us on a path from just being a religious person to Walking with God there's a big difference between those two things I mean the world is full of religion but those Walking with God is a totally different thing God never intended that we'd have religion he'd intend that we'd know him and walk with him and numb according to his word that's what he's always wanted to have a personal relationship with you and I Hallelujah so God spoke to Abraham his word impacted him it he touched him and it set him on another path and it was more than a path to Canaan though that was part of it it was more than just a path to the promised land and you know all those things because when God touches somebody it gives them Direction it gives them purpose you know we should never get to a place where we think we're just occupying time we're occupying weeks I'm looking forward to Christmas or New Year wherever you know no we're not here just occupying time God puts us on a specific path and we're here for a purpose now when God touches someone as I said ignites a fire in their soul Hallelujah once I just you know like the woman of the well God touched her by his word and once he's just occupying time maybe thinking this is just how my life is going to be but but but when she was touched by the master I mean she ran into a city saying come see a man who told me all I ever did is it's not the very Messiah amen so she was touched and her life went on a totally different path her Lisa Abraham's life went on a totally different path and it was more than just a Canaan because because when Abraham met God as as the Apostle Paul would ride in The Heroes of Faith in Hebrews chapter 11. it says by faith when God touches you gives you Faith he gives you revelation police I thank God for the Master's touch he imparts with us touchy in Parts Revelation and parts Faith Amen to by faith Abraham when he is called to go out into a place which he should after receive an inheritance obeyed he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he so adjourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise you know we can we can have Fellowship about the same promise Hallelujah for he looked for a city which had foundations whose Builder and maker is God see think about here's this man now he's living he's living you know he comes into the promised land and God says this is all yours but he's not looking for a physical City anymore you see it see when God touched him he put him on a path not just for a natural walk see see this is not the end you know our our future is not here our future is there right and if someone gets touched by the master of his word becomes alive to them they realize I'm just a pilgrim I have no continuing City amen I have one that's Eternal but upon this Earth I am just passing through amen so he was walking around on the very place in New Jerusalem was going to rest upon we'll rest upon amen he was walking in that very area because he but he was looking maybe he had journey to one place and someone would ask him you know what are you doing here I'm looking for a city anybody asked well there's no City around here you know you just passed a few he said no no I'm not looking for those cities I'm not looking for Sodom or Gomorrah or any natural kind of city I'm not looking for those cities what kind of city are you looking for I'm looking for a city whose Builder and maker is God can you tell me where it is there's a hunger there's a longing I want to be in that place see because when he touches you he puts a hunger in you for that land oh Leah so you know you know it's one big thing you know he's touched you as that one you live according to his word you love his word because that's him there's also a longing you want to go to that land Hallelujah see I trust we can just just change our perspective today doesn't matter what's going on in life you may have troubles up to your eyeballs and over your eyeballs but I trust you're looking for a sitting whose Builder and maker is gone see he was looking for that New Jerusalem amen he is looking and the reason he is looking for that Heavenly city is because he met the king of that City amen he met Melchizedek after he came back from rescuing Abraham um rescuing lot now we know Melchizedek was not just a natural King where the Apostle Paul would describe him in Hebrews chapter 7. he says this melchized the king of Salem preached the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and also after that king of Salem which is king of peace now he begins to describe him here without father without mother without dissent having either beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the Son of God abideth a priest continually so you know there's a lot of thoughts in the world about this Melchizedek some think well he is just a natural King but the Apostle Paul says he didn't have a father or mother beginning a days or end of life so he's Eternal and the only one that's Eternal is God and then other people think well he's a priesthood but we just read here no he's not a priesthood he's a man amen but he's not just a natural man but he's God himself came and after Abraham had had had got back as Fallen brother then then Melchizedek came and and served him the first ever symbol of communion of the bread and the wine showing that after the battle's over amen you get to commune with the Lord and and it shows that actually because remember many people think well that's going to be in the new heavens and you and new earth sure it will be or the Millennium sure it will be but really when you when you get the Battle of your own self see when you get yourself whipped out amen and let the Lord take over your life then he comes and communes with you Hallelujah now brother Brian would would preach a service at the near the end of his ministry Ministry who is this Melchizedek now to me the very title of that's very important because he doesn't say who was that Melchizedek but who is present tense this Melchizedek and then he begins to describe how how our lord Jesus through the through the Old Testament condescended down through various forms and he became flesh and and and on his descension down he was Melchizedek in a uh in a theophanic form right then he became flesh in Jesus Christ because we know that the god of the Old Testament is the god of the new right he's not a separate God right amen so so this Melchizedek is still alive today he's still present today because Melchizedek became Jesus Christ not a different God he's the same God just changing form and then he had asked the question now if I have preached the truth let him come forth now and vindicate it to be true and then there's people in the audience and then he calls out a woman or a man he says and he begins to describe their life and what what need they have and it's specific and accurate I don't have it on me right here but then he asked the question well who did they touch he said they didn't touch me he said there's no point touching me I'm like any other man but and you know and they're 30 feet from me who did they touch he said they touched the high priest because he's the high priest Can Be Touched by the feeling of our infirmity amen so he's saying that the high priest was there revealing himself through brother Branham the same Jesus Christ was revealing himself through brother Bradham and he is our high priest now he can still be touched by the feeling of our infirmity like the woman with the blood issue touched him physically but it was her faith that touched them because many other people thronged and bumped into him you know like the soldiers would slap him and beat him there in Pilots Jasmine Hall and mock them and different things but their touch did not get any healing their touch got no Deliverance because they had no faith in their touch rights are the same thing with you and I we've got to believe when we call upon his name amen that he's more than able to do that which we have asked Hallelujah like she did she came to a place she said well I've just got to touch him I believe I just get a hold of him and our faith can get a hold of him today amen it can change our lives now praise the Lord and then and then he would show this now show the condescension of God in that way he says we just bypassed our theophany so he skipped around you know the same way Jesus knew all things because he was theophany then he became flesh now we were with God in the mind of God we have eternal bodies waiting for us already we'll get to that right but we bypassed our theophany and became flesh and that's why when we when we're born in this world we didn't know who we were we had spiritual Amnesia right we thought we were from New Zealand or Africa or wherever right but then one day God came our way and he touched us and he opened our eyes amen and changed us and we never been the same just like the woman at the well she thought well I'm a Samaritan this is who I am this is you know you know this is my culture this is my Villages where our fathers used to worship and all these different things this is her identity but Jesus came to him saying no that's not your identity that's who you think you are but I want you to know who you really are in my mind and that's why he opened her heart amen opened her understanding and then then her eyes came open and so this is Messiah now when you see Messiah there's a reason you can see him in your days because you're part of Messiah you're part of the word amen that's that's way that's why we can see him and his Word is Alive with us today Hallelujah because why we're part of him that should make us happy you're having a bad day one part of God that's all right he's my father he'll take care of me he knows what I have need of amen he is my Hallelujah then I was rejoicing in this because uh so Genesis so so after after Abraham uh meets Melchizedek it says Genesis 15 1 and after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abraham in a vision saying fear not Abraham I'm thy Shield and thy exceedingly great reward maybe you want to put that up can you put that up Genesis 15 and 1. you think about this here he is here's Abraham he's got all these servants he's just got locked back and he's just had he said communion with God and different things he says no fear not I'm thy I am my I'm my shield I'm your protection that that word Shield you know there's a root meaning of it it means you know I'm your I'm your hedge I'm your protection I'm your Shield I'm your protector earlier so so who who can we fear if God's our Shield he's the best armor there is is the armor of God he says I'm thy Shield so our Shield is a person let me just let the full armor of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost we have the armor on the inside holy we don't physically pick up a weapon and a shield and now no it's it's it's in amen it's internal I was going to say it's EQ um it's Eternal but it is eternal because it's God but it's internal right because it's the Holy Ghost on the inside and the exceeding great rewards Abraham's reward was God this way it's such a longing I'm looking for the city who's building maker is God Amen because he's looking for this one who was his reward now this word reward I just I love looking into definitions of words and you know it just makes me happy amen so this word reward it's a payment of contract so he's he's our payment I remember remember the wages of sin are death so everyone's going to get paid something but the gift of God is eternal life right so so people will work for the devil and get wages which is death right but but he he just gives us eternal life without money or price we don't have to work for it we just got to accept it amen so it's a payment of contract it's a salary it's a fear f-a-r-e right you know like like you've got to get a bus fare or a plane what we call a plane ticket but a plate but you know so so it's a payment to get from one place to another place oh there we go from this place to to heaven right so here's our fear he paid it all that down Calvary we don't have to pay nothing to get in a Rapture he's already paid it for us amen it also means a maintenance at least it's not just a guy from this world to the next world but it's our maintenance he is our maintenance what he sustains us and keeps us every day Hallelujah he is our maintenance Hallelujah we think oh Lord you know we get so scared you know we need to get it out of our minds that we're going to fall away into unbelief right you got to get to a place I trust you've got to a place in your Christian walk that he saved you to keep you he didn't save you to lose you amen so he is your maintenance he will maintain you every day that's why he calls you in the morning come up a little higher I want to spend yo you get a burden on your heart I need to pray I need to read the word I know you're ever longing why because he wants to he wants to just pour himself in more and more Hallelujah and also by implication it's a compensation you know the one day when we're over on the other land he'll come out the great and his great majesty and physically wipe every tear from your eye hello just just one Glimpse one glimpse of him will just pay it all not that I'm even looking for a reward you understand but just one glimpse of that great king I think often you know because you know when he when he came in his glorified form there to the disciples he had he still had the male male prince in his hands and his feet and his side and you just see yeah yeah often think about yo we're up in eternity he's just perfect Blue Sky there's not a shadow anywhere it's just glorious and we say Let's go see him and he'll walk over the hill there we see him maybe in the distance he just waves his hand and you see that now put in his head you know it's him anyway totally we just saw this now Jesus Hallelujah just one glimpse just one wave he's our benefit he's our price he's our reward but also the last meaning of this word is he is our worth we are not worthless we are not worthless we are the apple of his eye if the devil ever tries you to think you're worth nothing he's lying to you amen you are worth more than see when you buy something you put a greater value at what you're buying that the money you have right otherwise you'd never buy it if you went to go buy a car or whatever and then you said no it's not worth it I'll keep my money while you put your money at greater value than the car but if you do the other way around you say well it's worth it I need to buy I really need those I'm going to pay more if I have to well you put greater value on the car or whatever than the money now Jesus put more value on you than his own life that's why he died on Calvary amen if he did not think you're a value he would never have purchased your salvation but because he purchased your salvation he put your life you at greater value than his own life How Great Is Our God that's what he thinks about you and I listen we are not worthless we are worth a lot even as brother bran would try and put it into a quantity one soul is worth more than ten thousand worlds hallelujah amen to anyone who's truly been touched by God seeks that Heavenly City they have a hunger and a draw towards that place above all things sure we have a desire to get married have children have a job different travel all those different things but above all we want to see him we want to go to that Heavenly place and the Apostle Paul would speak of it in second Corinthians 5. he says for we know that of our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens he's saying basically I have we have a house we have a body to step into it's already there right it doesn't it's not being built it's not under construction that body is already there that that as soon as you're the last heartbeat here will be the first heartbeat over there right Hallelujah we'll just step Last Breath here first breath over we just go from here to there before we realize it amen we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens you know if that really anchored into our hearts all fear would go all worry would go we would not worry about what man could do to us what the government what if we wouldn't we wouldn't be afraid of anything amen and yeah but the reason you you know way the reason we receive the Holy Ghost is because you have that house Hallelujah so the reason you received the Holy I just want to say it again the reason you've received it because many times you think am I going to make it Jesus already made it for you right but the reason he seals you into this Kingdom to the day of your Redemption is because you have that house I mean just like the reason like you know your brother Ben would say about the woman at the well compared to the scribes and Pharisees now the woman of the well received the Lord because she had representation in heaven right so she had so so on the earth she was you know she was a sinner she was Outcast of her Village no one wanted her you know she was had a bad name but in heaven she had representation she had a body Eternal in the heavens already if I put it that way right so when the light struck her she said I know your Messiah right her life was changed she was touched by the master because she had representation in heaven but the scribes and Pharisees morally they looked fine they were religious people they would have been revered on Earth but when that same Light Came their way they turned them down and the reason is I didn't have the representation in heaven so thank God we have representation in heaven you say well that's not fair I'm just happy I'm saved you know you got to look at a different way I'm just happy I'm a Believer today amen for unless we groan earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be being clothed we should we shall not be found naked now why do we earnestly want to be clothed now are there possible answers this for that we are in this Tabernacle do groan being burdened not that we should be unclothed see many people just want to leave the world because they have too many kids of Life wearing them down but that's not what the Apostle Paul says is the reason but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now he would chat brought us for the self same thing as God who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit therefore we are always confident knowing that while we are home in the body we are absent from the Lord for a walk by faith and not by sight we are confident I say and willing rather to be absent from the body to be present from a present with the Lord see saying in other words this is my interpretation the reason that we have a burden to go is because not that the cares of Life are so bad we just want to be with him amen that's why I want to be closed Amen in in in immortality right because because we want to be where he is why because we've met the king of that City amen we've had a meeting with that same Melchizedek has come to you and I I trust he has he's changed your life Hallelujah amen now what I love about the Lord is he didn't just die raise again go up into heaven and that's it but he gave he he returned back with evidence of that new land just like Caleb and Joshua would return back with the grapes with the other spies as Hat's a good land let's go now we know that heaven does not type the promised land in this way because there's not there's no Wars in heaven right but there's fighting and different things here when you receive the Holy Ghost but I want to use an example they came back with evidence because the other people never went to that land but they returned back with these grapes and the things of the land saying it's a good land and so when the Lord Jesus when he rose from the grave triumphed over hell death in the grave then he he brought back evidence of that new land personally to your own and that evidence is the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen let's see no no I just want to read this I feel like always I jump ahead of myself but he says there you are heir of all things air of eternal life air of divine healings this is you I'm talking about you right now oh heir of Salvation purchase of God born of his Spirit washed in his blood this is my story this is my song praising My Savior all the day long perfect submission alls at rest and my savior am happy and blessed watching and waiting and looking above filled with his goodness and love Hallelujah there you are this is my story and this is my song I'm an ear of Salvation what is salvation something that's excuse me given to you it's a gift I'm an ear of Salvation what kind for eternal life salvation for my soul salvation for my body salvation for my from my weariness salvation for everything God made me air of everything through Christ and he died and Rose and returned back and brought the evidence and poured it out upon us o my glory o my he says so when he pours out the Holy Ghost into your life he's giving you he's returning back evidence of that land that we're going to that's why God gives us the Holy Ghost sure has to give us overcoming power and I'll walk upon the Earth right as to be the inner teacher within us right it's to guide us into all truth amen because it's God in us right amen the hope of glory but it's also evidence that there's a land to go to because we're going to realize this once we die it's not just there's nothing and this is it right no there's an eternal land that we're going to dwell in we're going to be embodies we're never going to get old we're going to be sick of weary no troubles there no Sorrows amen but we've received the evidence that the land is there Hallelujah aren't you glad amen when he said actually there's more to it than this is more than just religion and trying to learn Doctrine and things but no there's a resurrection power that comes into the believer Hallelujah so he's brought back that evidence that's why when you when he touches you he's giving you evidence you have a home beyond the river I got a home Over Yonder Hallelujah on the other Shore amen what I love about yo I would say in Ephesians that you know it's the when we receive the Holy Ghost when you seal with that Holy Spirit of Promise it's the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchase possession unto the praise of his glory that's Ephesians 1 13 and 14. so that's the earnest or the down payment of our inheritance Hallelujah so we receive that down payment because there's more to come well why does that mortar come well there's a change of the body there's a fullness of adoption Hallelujah yo so so even even Divine Healing is the earnest of the Resurrection Hallelujah where God would Supernatural heal someone it's showing that's a down payment saying there's more because you know the the resurrection of the Dead Saints and the transformation of these bodies is going to be the massive biggest moment of Divine Healing the world has ever seen I mean we're gonna go from old to young again Hallelujah but it's actually more than just going from old to young again because if we just go young again we can get old again right but it's actually a Breaking of the cycle and I just want to say that the cycle of of of of of of life and death actually has begun to be broke in the believer's life amen when they when the apostles win 120 in the upper room in the book of Acts received the Holy Ghost there was a cycle of of of death had been broken in them because they had eternal life in their souls right amen so and and unbelief was changed into faith so there's a change of a cycle you see the cycle in the Old Testament of of of Revival and death but it's unbelief still governing the people because they were given a law because the blood of bulls and goats could never change their hearts that they could walk with God in a way that pleased him but under the blood of Jesus Christ he changes our nature that it becomes his nature so there's a change of a cycle going on now now if he has to change our hearts from unbelief to Faith now if you've received the Holy Ghost he's done that right if you're a Believer today he's done that who's a Believer who's a Christian who's a Christian right so so he's changed you from doubting the word to believing the word amen so he's beginning to change the cycle because remember God God works from the inside out because remember the last change we're going to experience is the change of the outside of these bodies right but he changes he starts on the inside from from from sin and unbelief to Faith and he works outwardly praise our God now if we look at Abraham and Sarah you know when they were when they were well up in years it's amazing that after after the visitation you know you know Abraham had had his visitation but Sarah was still doubting the promise but because she was part of the promise God had to visit her and turn her heart from unbelief to Faith you know maybe for yo you have those 25 years you begin to just get annoyed at Abraham every month he would ask her how are you feeling any different you know we're gonna have the baby and maybe she just got annoyed first Year's excitement they just become annoying because she was getting older she was getting sicker he was getting older they were both impossible to have the child I mean but but Abraham you know became stronger in faith because he had been touched by the master amen and when God touches someone he makes them stronger in faith the promise becomes more real and I trust that the Rapture you being translated from this world to the next has become more real from when you first believed it's become more of a reality that that that land that you're going to is more real than it was when you first met God why because you become stronger in the promise as you've been feeding off the Lord have been feeding off the word you become stronger amen as you walk with him but you see now that Sarah had to have a visitation and so in Genesis 18 God came down in flesh with two angels and he came and he spoke to Abraham and he said according to time of life you're going to have the promise son and and Sarah was in the tent behind him laughed at you know you know within himself but the Lord discerned her thoughts and said why did Sarah laugh according to the time of life you'll have the promised son now at this stage they were young in their bodies shortly after I don't have it here but Genesis yo yo you know there's two accounts where two kings one who want to marry Sarah no with the first account she was so Abraham was 75 when God called him so Sarah was a bit younger than that so she's well up in there she's basically Grandma already and and and and and what you know the king of Egypt wanted to marry her so she was already physically young because you think about it why would a king want to marry a grandma to have a child to continue his life that doesn't humanly make sense but because she was she looked young and beautiful right she wanted he wanted to marry her but in the law and then even Abraham told her you know tell her that you know tell tell everyone that you're my sister otherwise they'll kill me to get you and that was kind of true because they were half brother and sister but you know a white lie is still alive and then we come down to Genesis 20 so after after God comes down inflation Genesis 18 discerns the thoughts of you know Sarah's heart just like he did in this day that same God came down and revealed the thoughts of Hearts of people in this day and turned her heart from unbelief to Faith she was young but you see this is why God had to make her make us more than just make us young again he's going to changes in such a way that we can take a Rapture no if we can read this in Genesis 21 to 5 and Abraham journeyed from thence towards the South Country and dwell between kadish and sure and sojour in in Graham and Abraham said to Sarah his wife she's my sister and abimelech the king of Greer sent and took Sarah but God came to a blimelich in a Dream by night and said and behold Thou Art but a dead man for the woman which thou has taken she is a man's wife but a blimelich had not um come near her and he said Lord will thou slay also a righteous Nation but he said unto me she is my sister and she even herself said he is my brother in the Integrity of my heart and infancy of my hands have I done this so basically the next day he's going to marry Sarah and God intervene saying hold on this woman that you're going to marry tomorrow she's actually married to this man and so he's all he's all distraught because how can this be but they said they're siblings so here she was 90 odd years old why would he marry grandma to have a child see God had made them young again but you see even just making them young again couldn't break the cycle where they couldn't have a child because when that young man couldn't have children so God had to do more than just make them young again to fulfill the promise and it's the same thing with our own bodies God has to make us more than just young again also even he has to make us more than just how Adam and Eve were in the garden because Adam and Eve if we remember Adam and Eve though they were Eternal they were living in the garden in Paradise With God they had an ability to fall so God would have to change us that we go back even beyond that that we go young again but we cannot fall now as I said this starts from the inside out and just bear with me if my voice just completely breaks well we'll just we'll just quit and sing but yeah until then let's just let's just go up go uphill in a low gear now God has to change us from the inside out right so now here's the makers in such a way that we cannot fall into unbelief sure we'll have our ups and downs and our troubles and our sorrows we're not exempt from those things being Christians right but he has to change our souls that we'll always believe his word is Right amen that above all things this whole word is true and it is right and our attitude is always God is always right our reasoning is not right God is right and that's a good way to know that you know you're surrendered to God is that you take his word above your reasoning I mean you take you take yo his word above your imagination you actually take all those things and say that's second to God's word amen so now see so he had the changes on the inside that when we get there we cannot fall amen so in John 5 and 24 Jesus is a power when we're touched by God he says unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but his pass from Death unto life now that condemnation is the great white Throne judgment so God is saying that him that really hears my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life so they receive everlasting life right there amen when God opens your heart you hear his word more than in here but his word touches you like it touched Abraham amen then you have everlasting life see this is not just a yo giving a sinner's prayer kind of a thing in others when you give your life to God his word has an impact who's been impacted by the word of God Amen he changes you amen that you have everlasting life he says you shall not come into condemnation so in other words every man woman and child stands at a Crossroads upon the Earth they can either to go in a Rapture or they can go to the great white Throne judgment because remember everyone's going to go to either too and actually both end in the same place because the Saints will judge the world with Christ right amen so you know you know so so everyone will end up in the judgment will either be before the bar being judged or be on the Judgment seat with Christ judging the world right but but there's two ways to get there there's one either that this happens that that that that we actually hear the word means understand it not in here but in here believe of him that sent me and then you receive everlasting life I'm laboring this because I want you to never minimize you you've met God because there's always you know they can always come a fear into people's hearts am I going in a Rapture well based on the scripture if you really believe you're what your your life has been changed by his word I mean something in you says the word is right I may not understand it but it's my it's true amen and what happens is instead of standing at that Crossroad and actually God actually destroys that road that you can go to the Judgment that you go to the great white Throne judgment to be judged ah I trust this makes sense because remember if God has revealed himself like he spoke his word touched Abraham put him on a path into Glory his word has touched you right and he put you in a path into a Rapture cycle not to go the white Throne judgment I mean judge according to your works but to go and judge the world with Christ amen that makes me excited because that means I cannot go to the condemnation I cannot be standing before uh an an Angry wrathful judgeful God at the right Throne judgment because I cannot go there because I have everlasting life now because he's allowed me to believe his word it's changed me and his past from Death unto life so right now as you're sitting here if you really know him not in a religious way but you really know him you have everlasting life right now and you've passed from Death unto life right now hallelujah amen so he changes from the inside out amen that change now begins to work from here outward oh look you may say well that's just a Baptist kind of a scripture that you're quoting John 5 absolutely not that's a bright scripture I mean that's just not a dry-eyed confession I believe mentally and therefore no no there's a transformation of a life amen amen Hallelujah praise the Lord I'm kind of losing where I am no see so he has to change us that we cannot fall because remember overcoming is not taking away the thing that causes you to fall that's not overcoming that's just taking away the temptation but overcoming is a change of nature that a Thing Once came I guess you made you fall it can't make you fall anymore because your Nature's been changed right so so the so the main reason so the reason that we will not fall or we cannot sin you know once we're in a new body it's not because the devil's done away with that's that's not the reason no the reason is these changes in such a way that we cannot accept his life like Eve did and his changes in such a way now that we cannot accept his lie on the side Hallelujah that we will take God's word because remember my sheep know my voice a stranger thou not follow so if we are his sheep we know his voice the voice of the word and we cannot follow a stranger Hallelujah that makes me enthused amen because he's so so he's going to change us not just to be young again but change our bodies that we can actually meet the Lord in the air just like Abraham and Sarah he didn't just make them young again but he had to change their bodies not just young but they could have the child they could actually receive the promised son and is that what and but that all started when they turned their hearts when God turned their hearts from unbelief to Faith In The Promise amen that's why it says in Hebrews 11 that by faith Abraham Sarah received strength as she conceived seed judging him as faithful whom is promised Hallelujah praise the Lord amen so we can look into this so we can say God you're so good that you come and touch people amen that you still that you still come and change lives amen remember because once once upon a time I'm just gonna I'm just gonna kind of wrap this up with this thought here we're going to continue in Ephesians 2. I just love this chapter he says now he says but now in Christ Jesus who sometimes were a far-off or made Night by the blood of Christ for he is our peace who have made both one hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity having the law of Commandments obtained in ordinances for to making himself of Twain one new man so making peace and that he might reconcile both unto God and one body by the cross having sland the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which is afar off and to them that will nigh for through him pardon me we both have access by one Spirit unto the father now therefore we are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and with the household of God and are built upon the foundation the apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone so we are the household of faith where the household of God I was going to finish with this thought so now any any nation has a certain spirit you come to New Zealand there's a kiwi Spirit go to Australia there's an Australian Spirit you go to different countries around the world and and the people are governed by that Spirit even different causes have gone Global and that Spirit has spread around the world you take like you know decades ago when Communism spread people from different nations receive that same Spirit they became the same kind of people why because that movement went Global they became a household of something different now when God touches you or me we become the household of God so if we are the household of God we speak different we act differently than the nation we're born in I mean that's why we can be the United Nations and we can speak the same kind of way we can have the same kind of language of Faith amen the same kind of the same kind of spirit the spirit of God hallelujah amen the weekend you know we can speak peace we can speak faith we can have the same goal what is that goal I met the maker of that City Hallelujah and what's our goal say tell everyone come with me come with me come seek a City who's building maker is God why are you seeking that kind of a city is it because the world's so bad no because he touched me I met the king of that City and I want to go be in that City I want to see I want to see the king of that City amen so I trust it was once upon you know I just take it in this butchered way one time you were one way and you knew he could do it but then he came and did it holy and now you're no longer the same blind Bartimaeus would would Beg by the gates of Jericho and he knew God could do it brother Brown would dramatize and say you know his mother would sit him on his knee and tell him about the great stories that happened in his City amen how how Jericho's walls came tumbling down with Joshua how the Jordan became a dry land as the when the ark went into it and you know when Elisha and Elijah crossed supernaturally than Elisha you know then Elijah went up in a you know Chariot of fire that Elijah came back with his mantle smother Jordan again crossed back over and incredible things happen in that City and then he began to think if only I lived back in those days you know so he knew Jehovah God could give a sight back but then one day the master came his way where there's a hunger God will meet that hunger so he knew it could be done then it was done then he could Marvel the rest of his days he did it I'm just taking uh Christine's phrase and Elizabeth he did it Hallelujah and then while we can Rejoice he did it how did he do it I can't really describe it but he changed me and he changed my desires he threw them Heavenly that now I want to go be where he is never let the devil try and Rob you off that that's Eternal God did you know Abraham went through a lot of trouble but he said I'm still looking for that City because I met the king of that City amen I trust that that's our highest desire today I'm looking for a city whose Builder maker is God amen let's have the musicians this morning I'm just going to leave it there but let's just go on and love the Lord [Applause] hey man we have that salt while I put it in the thing I don't know if it's um synced but this thing is something he touched me Shackled by heavy burden that at that time but now we're different hmm amen I think we know the song it's an old it's an oldie but a goodie praise the Lord let's stand this morning and sing a couple of songs let's go rejoicing today maybe as he touched you hey man isn't he good thank you Lord hey man you're gonna have probably gonna have to help me brother [Music] foreign beneath the load of guilt and shame [Music] oh then the hand of Jesus touch me and now I am no longer the same oh
