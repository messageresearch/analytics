========================================

Where are you? Lord. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. We all [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Hey, Heat. Heat. [music] Heat. There you go. back here again. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe we're going to have a tremendous weekend. But before we begin, we have Liz here, the camp manager, camp owner, who's going to go through a few health and safety [music] things. But as she comes, let's give her a round of applause because we appreciate. [applause] Hi guys, welcome back to Forest Lakes. Many of you will have heard already what I'm going to say, but we do need to cover over what to do in an emergency. And so, if you haven't been before or you've forgotten, out on the playing field on the field side of the fence, there are some numbers 1 to 22. So, those are where you're going to line up if you're in those cabins. And then there's a Lake Lodge section and a Wawa section. And there isn't a villa section, but you can go next to W tower. Um, so if there's a fire, that's where you're going to congregate in an emergency. However, with an earthquake, you're only going to go there if it's safe after the shaking has stopped. In the meantime, if an earthquake happens, it's the normal drop cover, hold, try and stay away from windows. And um once the shaking stopped, then um move there. If you're a child, then the adults will tell you what to do because it's one of those things you've got to make it up. As it kind of happens, you don't know what is actually going to happen. Um, in here, we're going to stick a piece of paper over that sign that says exit out there cuz that's not an exit, but you've got exits out here. And you can kind of get out here and there's an exit over here. Um, the same in the dining room. There are a few exits over there. just please make sure you don't block those during the weekend so that they can stay as an exit. Um so that's the general evacuation stuff. Um as far as things like the playground goes, um one person at a time on the trampoline and a maximum of four on the tire swing. Um the camp activities are out of bounds unless it's an organized recreation time. And then there'll be instructions from Ben. Yep. instructions from Ben on what's being used, how it's being used, and I'll chat with people that are running activities Saturday afternoon. Yep. Saturday afternoon. So, some of you will be asked to lead an activity Saturday afternoon. You can come and see me and I'll be pretty much around the office most of the weekend. Um, and there just some pieces of paper to sign for your supervisor agreement once I've run over the instructions for safely running the activity. Um, if you are staying in the villas and you want your towels changed out, just feel free to bring them to the office and then I can give you some replacements to take back. Um, if you well for everybody, most of the cabins have their own bathroom and in there you'll find two toilet paper dispensers. Um, some of them a bit tricky because they feed from the inside of the roll and still it still looks like looks like there's stuff at the outside. Um, but if they are not working properly, there are some keys that will unlock them in some cupboards that are just outside. If you look at the office door to the left of there, there's the cleaning supplies cupboard. There will be toilet paper in there and keys to unlock those. So, if one runs out, please replace it. You'll still have a second one to use, but if they both run out, then you've got a problem. So great if you can replace it after the first one runs out. And then at the end of the weekend when it comes to tidy up, um you'll also find cleaning stuff there. If you need a vacuum cleaner throughout the weekend, underneath the staircase in the octagonal building will be vacuum cleaners. Um, and when it comes to doing your dishes, we have got, well, you've employed some people to do the dishes for you, which means you don't have to do them, but it would be really helpful when you bring them up if you can stack them in the trays. If the trays are full, please try and stack your plates in an orderly fashion. Your cutlery will go into containers that are blue labeled knife, fork, spoon. So you can pop them in there and that's going to make the job a lot easier for the people that are cleaning. If you are using cups, please don't take them wandering around camp and leave them there because we'll end up or and same with the plates and the crockery, not enough for meals. So please make sure you return them back there and they get washed. Um yeah, I think that's most of it. Yeah, have a great weekend and I hope you've brought your umbrella. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you. [applause] Amen. We're in for a tremendous time. So, just a few notices from from us um before we begin. Okay. So, please sleep in your allocated rooms. Um there is a prayer meeting tomorrow morning and Sunday morning at 9:00 a.m. for anyone who would like to attend that. Brother Al is going to be leading that. So, thank you very much. Um, if you have any outstanding camp fees, you can see me in the dining hall on Sunday at 2 p.m. And um, also if you need anything, where's where's brother Ed and Brother Kaben? This is Brother Ed there. Brother Kaben, there are deacons. If you need anything, they will sort it out for you. Okay. So, they're the men to contact um during the services. Those two B. to the bathrooms through there are only for sisters and young children only. So brothers, you got to go back to the main camp to uh use the bathrooms there. And there's a bit of a step going down there, so mind your step as you go in and out. Um if you have a song special and you haven't contacted myself or Brother Isaac yet, please see Brother Isaac. Um the swimming pool is out of bounds unless we have a baptism, then praise the Lord. But yes, so but please stay out of the swimming pool. Um and also with the kitchen, the same thing. Uh, please stay out of the kitchen area unless you're asked to go into it. Um, if you need an iron and ironing board, there's one available in the laundry. And, um, also after the evening services, children, if you could not be in the playground, please just go either into the dining hall, the basketball court, or but don't be on the um, playground, please. Um, if you're on the special diet list, um, please or if you have any food related questions, see, please see Sister Priscilla who's there. And um sister Julene has made the special diet. So you're all in for a good treat there uh for those who are having them. Um on Sunday morning when we take up an offering for brother John and brother Jonathan and um if you want to take part of the games uh tomorrow afternoon, please meet on the field at 2:30. And um the coffee cart, we have the coffee cart again this year. Yay. [applause] Okay. So, um, and so with that, there's a there's an offering box there if you'd like to contribute towards that. Um, and that's on the coffee cart there itself. Um, and outside the dining room, so as you go into the through the double doors into the dining room from the basketball court, there is a there's a dining room cleaning roster and we know where you're staying. So, we know where you live and if your name's on it, we'll come looking for you. But, please be proactive and see if your name is on that. Uh if you have any dining room related questions, there's uh where's where's sister Lundy? Lundy is the lady to ask about. And also, Sister K. Adams Reed has uh whole bunch of clothing she'd like to give away, which will be in the um common room or the uh Yeah, there in the lake lodge on Saturday. This pardon, it's there now. Okay. Shop's already set up. So, if you'd like anything there, it's free to Yeah. Free to a good home. And um Yeah. So that's all the notices. Now I'd like to give you the most important notice though. Okay. It says in it says in you know I've been thinking about this camp and every year God has done something special. Every year the first camp we had some young people came young sisters came and they basically before the camp they gave God an ultimatum. God if this message is you you've got to show yourself at this camp otherwise I'm walking away. And God in his infinite mercy showed himself to them. And how many people have been touched, healed just spontaneously. Spirits have been cast out. Lives have been changed. The Holy Ghost has poured himself out. Service after service. This camp has been a supernatural camp. &gt;&gt; I believe this camp is not not our camp. I believe it's God's camp. Right? You've come to a a meeting that the Lord Jesus has wanted and we're here again. So I just want to read a scripture. I've been thinking about this scripture about this camp. Says in Luke 19 and verse one, "And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. And behold, there was a man named Zakius, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich. And he sought to see Jesus who he was, and could not for the press, because he was little of stature. and he ran before and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way. I believe the Lord Jesus Christ is going to pass this way over this weekend. He's going to walk here. He's going to touch lives. He's passing by. So, I would, if I was you, it doesn't matter if you've known him for decades. Maybe you don't haven't met him yet. Just just say, "Lord," with your faith, say, "Lord, come and come and touch my life. Lord, may your word become a living reality because we all need more of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not here just to go through emotion. We're here that the Lord would touch us, would change us. You know, just before this that we read about in uh 19, the end of that was where blind Barameus was there and he was he was hearing, you know, his his his mother, sorry for taking the time, but his mother would teach him when he was young about what God did in Jericho with Joshua and Elijah and Elisha and all these things. And you know, he heard a bunch of noise when he was a blind man there by the wall and someone said, "This is Jesus passing by." So if you hear a bunch of noise, it's more than emotion. It's Jesus passing by. And he began to realize the God he heard about of history was now the God in the present. And and and he be to call out to God. And and the prophet taught us it wasn't the how loud he was calling. It was his faith stopped the master. And it says the scripture says, "And Jesus stood still &gt;&gt; and called um Baras to come to him." &gt;&gt; So let your faith touch him &gt;&gt; and he will he will have give you a private &gt;&gt; one- on-one &gt;&gt; and he's going to change your life because you got to think about it. It's not a doctrine passing this way. It's not a bunch of quotes passing this way. It's not a church movement passing this way. It's the Lord of glory is going to be passing this way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I believe, you know, as we as we open these services in a word of prayer, let's just dedicate our lives and say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; I need you &gt;&gt; more than ever." &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's how about let's bow our heads and let's dedicate our lives to the Lord. You know, we could stand here for hours and talk about angel choir singing be, you know, you know, with us when we're singing at our first camp and God touching people and he's not a God of history. He's the God of the present. &gt;&gt; So, let's invite him. Do you know personally do that cuz the because we are told Jesus always comes where he's invited. &gt;&gt; So, how about how about you invite him to where you're at this uh tonight? Okay. So, let's bow our heads and and pray. Gracious Father, just to think, Lord, that you would pass this way. We're so thankful. It's more than a nice idea. It's more than even a nice scripture. It's a reality, Lord, because you are the same yesterday, today, tonight, and forever. So, dear God, as we've assembled, dear God, we know many are still traveling to these meetings, but Father, as we've gathered here, and there's others who are watching, Lord, by the way of the internet, Lord, we just want to invite you to where we are. come to come by our house, oh God. Touch our lives, Lord Jesus. Lord, we don't want to leave this campground. The same people we came here. We want to be changed and renewed, Lord God. And not just for a moment of time and go back into some cycle, but we want to go higher with you, Lord, that we could say that at 2025 at a campground here at the Forest Lakes, you came by our way and you touched us, dear God. You changed us, Lord. Grant it, Father. We commit our lives. We commit the service. We commit this campground into your hands. Lord, I pray you just cover it in your blood, dear God. May your angels take up their positions, Father. And dear God, may you just come inhabit the praises of your people, Lord. You know what everything is going on in our lives, Lord Jesus. And may you come by our way this weekend, Lord. We invite you here. Take the highest place in our lives, Lord. Be the most welcome one. Grant it, Father. Father, we commit the service into your hands. We pray you'd bless Brother Jonathan, Father, mightily as he stands behind the pulpit, Lord. Fill his mouth with your words, oh God, and speak personally to each and every one of us, Lord. Doesn't matter how old or young we are. We all need you. Grant it, dear God, in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, friends. We have brother Jonathan Martin ministering [music] uh tonight. Brother John Andy's is ministering in the morning. But I believe this will be the greatest camp. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have ever had. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because our Lord Jesus is present. Amen. So, God bless you. I'll turn it. Thank you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you everyone. &gt;&gt; How are you all? &gt;&gt; You good? &gt;&gt; It's very, very good to see you all. &gt;&gt; And I know that I love you all and you love me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I know this for a fact that [music] the the God that we're coming to right now loves us. &gt;&gt; And it's such an amazing thing to to realize the heart of God for us. Can I just tell you a little little one minute story? &gt;&gt; So, you know, you you get the enemy comes at you for sometimes. years and he's just knocking at you and and [music] he tries to convince us in our mind that that maybe God doesn't think so much of us as what we think he does and you know maybe he he he sws negative thoughts in our minds. You ever had that? Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, like he just he tries to undermine God's feelings towards us and tries to get our mind twisted in a different way and you know he if he has a long time to do this and a lot of energy he can sometimes work on us quite a lot you know [laughter] and and I remember he had been at me for years and years and you you can sometimes get a wrong thought in your brain in your mind about how you know maybe the Lord does think this little thing about me is not quite that or I had such a powerful experience recently when I we were there was a communion service and I just when I walked up to just before I went to take communion, there was such a powerful anointing of the presence of God there. It it just you can't help but weep, you know. It's just it's it's very powerful. And we we took communion there and prayed and I I managed to somehow get through the prayer without falling to pieces because you just you just know there's something here. Sorry brethren was cyborg. Um then I walked in front of this pulpit here at the church and as I got to before the the wine there just it's like I walked into the heart of God. Like there was such a strong anointing. You just feel like I'm walking into the very heart of this God that I that I serve. [music] And all I felt was love for me there within the depths of all that within everything there was. There was only love for me. There was only good things. There was no there was no negative things. There was no nothing. And and it just it dawned on me. This is the heart of God towards you. &gt;&gt; There's only good things. So that's what I want to say to you all this evening. There's only good things. God has only got good things for you this evening. Don't listen to nothing else. Don't listen to any other thought. And everyone here has got in there, have you? &gt;&gt; So, you all only think good things of everyone else, too. &gt;&gt; Let's stand up and let's just greet each other. Let's let's let's relax the atmosphere. Just greet each other. Tell each other there's only good things. Can you fix me up, bro? Thanks. God bless you, bro. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's good.

And when it all when it all [music] looks like you can Jesus [music] all my way [music] [music] [singing] Jesus And [music] when I conquer every mountain, you carry [music and singing] your way.

The Lord Jesus Christ is the mighty [music] conqueror among us. He's our captain. He's never lost a battle. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. [music] And I believe that the prophet of God taught us that he is the unchanging God. He's just uh changing [music] his mass. He's God in Morphe. I believe that he's God in morphe in a group of people that is that knows him and the power of his resurrection. And uh I I believe that I'm looking at Jesus Christ. Mrs. [music] Jesus Christ. It's God in flesh. And I I tell you, we are we are recognized and identified as an invincible army. And it's uh so good to be uh gathered uh with [music] you this evening. and uh count it just a great privilege to be here and [music] uh we appreciate the invitation. We uh we bring greetings from [music] uh our pastor, brother Wayne Lawson, and uh the church there in Bluffton, Ohio, uh uh True Word Tabernacle. [music] And they all send their greetings and and uh salute you and say, "God richly bless you." And uh it's so uh so good to [music] just see everyone. And uh are you looking have you come with a great expectation? Amen. I I have come with a great expectation myself and it's good to have my wife here. I see her there. and uh Sister Laura. Uh it's a just [music] a real privilege to have her uh able to come and uh real real uh honor for me to be able to minister with brother [music] John uh brother John Andes and sure love brother John and uh just appreciate him and his ministry and uh the gift that God has placed in his life and a great blessing to the bride [music] of Jesus Christ and and uh so we're just looking for uh just a wonderful time in the Lord [music] and I know that if you've come uh just with a with your cup lifted up, I know God's going to fill it. [music] And uh I know that if you've come with maybe a burden on your heart or maybe you've got a need, I believe that God will meet that need. And uh you get what you expect. [music] And uh I you know I believe that God is just going to do the supernatural [music] and and he's going to manifest himself in a supernatural way. And uh you know I believe that this is not a man's message. Uh but the message is Christ. And uh I believe that uh he [music] said if if you lift me up I'll draw all men unto myself. And and uh that's our burden. That's our our vision is just to exalt Christ so high that he's above every trial. He's above every family situation. [music] He's above everything that you may go through, everything the devil can throw at you in this life. [music] Uh we're just here to exalt Christ and the power of his resurrection. And uh I I'm zealous about this message. [music] I think that we should be passionate about the message of the hour. uh not a not ashamed of it. Uh Paul said that I'm not ashamed of the gospel for it's the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth. And I believe that we can exalt this this message so high and and exalt the name of Jesus Christ. And and uh I I don't think that you can make our God too big, make him too mighty. I think that we should just make him bigger than any demonic power of hell. and and he's above cancer. He's above discouragement. He's above fear. He's above oppression. And I I believe that uh you may have come in a great battle and even a battle for your life. But I believe that you're going to leave here delivered. You're going to be here changed. You're going to be here better off. I believe that's that's the Lord that we serve. That's the God that we've been introduced to. [snorts] And uh so the message is not dead. The message is very much alive and well. And I just want to say this, I'll just say it like this. This message [music] is greater now than ever before. And I believe that we are preaching and believing the greatest message that has ever come upon this earth. I I'm not just saying that half-hearted. I believe that with everything within me. I believe that this is going to change our bodies. And uh I believe it so much that this could be our last service. I know we've been hearing that for years and years, but I'm just going to tell you, you're going to hear it for the last time one of these days. And uh it's the very thing that we're believing. It's it's it's going to change our bodies one of these days. So, amen. We we just uh appreciate uh Brother Ben for giving us the uh opportunity to be here. God [music] richly bless you and and uh he and his family and his church and the vision here and just everyone that is gathered and all the churches represented. We say God richly bless you. And uh so if you have your Bibles, we're going to uh turn to Luke the 18th chapter and we're going to read the first eight verses. And then we're going to read also Hebrews 6 and verse 12. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Luke 18 and beginning at verse one. And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray and not to faint, saying, There was in a city a judge which feared not God, neither regarded man, and there was a widow in that city, and she came unto him, saying, "Avenge me of mine adversary." And he would not for a while. But afterward he said within himself, "Though I fear not God, nor regard men, yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me." And the Lord said, "Hear what the unjust judge saith, and shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth." Now Hebrews 6 and verse 12, that ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. Now, let's just bow our hearts in a word of prayer. Why don't you just invite him and make him feel welcome as we begin this camp and just invite him to come right where you sit and just uh just make him feel so at home. Father, we love you. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And Lord, the songs have been sung, the atmosphere has been set. Lord uh everything has been done to uh just invite your presence and to make you feel welcome among us. Lord Jesus, we come with a great expectation. No doubt there's been many battles and Satan has tried to bring discouragement, distractions, but Lord Jesus, we have come nonetheless with a great expectation that you're going to meet our needs. And Lord, you come where you're invited. &gt;&gt; And oh God, all the preparations have been made and now our hearts are wide open saying, "Come, Lord Jesus. Have your way. Father, we ask that you would heal the sick and just encourage the discouraged." Lord, may every spirit that is not of your Holy Spirit flee this place, Lord. Oh God, let your people just enter into the joys of the Lord and the liberties of the Holy Ghost and just feed upon the good things of God. And oh Lord, may may we be completely changed from this time forward, oh God, better Christians, better fit to serve you, Father. Lord, we give ourselves over to you now in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. God richly bless you. You may be seated. Jesus said, "Nevertheless, when the son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth." And I would like to just take for a text, "Will I find faith?" And it's a simple subject on faith. I'm not uh I'm not a deep preacher. I'm not bringing anything new. Uh but I do love the message and uh I believe that the prophet of God said that if we will recognize his presence that he will release our desires that we have in him to us. And so we have uh some examples in the scripture such as like the woman with the issue of blood and how that she had this uh issue for 12 years and she had went to many doctors and spent all of her money and no one could help her. Uh but then she heard about Jesus Christ and how that uh the supernatural was being made manifest and how that uh different needs were being met. And then she heard that Jesus was to pass her way. And uh the the Bible says that something struck her heart that if I can only touch his garment. And the prophet says in the sermon, "The presence of God unrecognized when that genuine faith in God became a positive thing to her." What did it release? It released his power to heal her. It touched him in such a way he turned around and told her what was wrong with her and said, "Your faith has saved you." What did faith? Others standing there might have been sicker than she, but you see, she recognized his presence. She knowed that was her opportunity. If we could only do that tonight, people, if we could only realize that he is appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose, that's to release our desires we have in him to us. But we've got to recognize his presence. And now, how you recognize his presence is when the promised word for this age is made manifest. Not the promised word of Moses age or any of the other ages. the promise of the word for this age. Amen. The prophet of God would say that Jesus always goes where he is invited. He would give us another example of how that a Pharisee by the name of Simon invited Jesus to come to his feast. And it was really an invitation uh just to make fun of Jesus. They really didn't believe in Jesus. They didn't believe that he was a prophet. Didn't believe that he was Messiah. And uh they they they invited him just to prove that uh he was just an ordinary man. And what they were claiming he was. And uh they we know the story of how that uh they brought Jesus in the footwash flunky uh didn't wash his feet. They put him over in a corner with dirty feet and no one kissed him welcome and and uh he sat there kind of embarrassed. The the smell and the stench of the road and the sweat of the day uh was upon him and everyone else was having a good time. But then we find that there was uh a woman of ill fame, a prostitute that she she seen Jesus sitting in a corner with dirty feet and she must have got her her uh her her the money that she earned from her prostitution. and she went and got the best oils in this alabaster box and and then she snuck through the gate and somehow she come into the presence of Jesus and then in his presence my the floodgates opened up and the tears begin to come and she recognized that that this was the very person that could meet her need and And as the tears begin to come and and she begin to uh wash his feet with her tears and take her hair, which the hair of a woman is her glory. And she be to take her glory and begin to wash his feet with her tears and dry his feet with her hair. And my there was a hush all over the room as they begin to think and in their hearts I see look if this man really was a prophet she he would recognize who this woman really was and this is all this is just a prostitute. This is a sinner. But you see uh uh there was something supernatural that was taking everyone else was scorning. Everyone else was mocking and criticizing, but there was something supernatural that was taking place. Amen. And Jesus said, "I say unto her, her sins which are many are all forgiven. Go in peace." Amen. The prophet said, "What was it?" She recognized her opportunity. She did it. She did him a service. The Pharisees didn't do it. She saw it and she recognized his presence. And what did it do? It washed. Isn't that a beautiful thing? Amen. She recognized his presence. And what did it do? It washed. What did it release to her? Forgiveness. Released to her forgiveness of her sins. What did it also do? It also released the power of God to show to them unbelievers that he was a prophet. He knew who she was. It also released joy and power and eternal life. It released that. Amen. You see, the promised word of this age has released the power of God to bring healing and bring deliverance and to bring eternal life and to bring the joy and peace of God into human hearts. Amen. to recognize his presence, the vindicated word of the hour that Jesus Christ is not dead, but he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Well, what could God do for for us in this meeting? Amen. What God? What could God do for young people that are needing a new birth? And Amen. adults needing a birth and needing refillings of the Holy Ghost and the sick can leave here completely delivered and set free. Amen. Delivered from all spirits of oppression. I tell you, you see the prophet would tell us, amen, that as Enoch built the pyramid and and and that pyramid stands for a symbol and he says shows us that there was seven steps in that pyramid that go that lead up to the king's chamber. And then he says that at the seventh step there is a there there is a little there is a little place there. Amen. That the messenger introduces the comer into the presence of the king. And he would say he would say where did the guard meet the challenge to bring the comer into the presence of the king? It was at the top of the steps was in the seventh step. There shows that we've got to come again with that same spirit that was on John. He introduced the Messiah. Amen. You see Malachi 45 and six, behold, I will send you Elijah before the great and terrible dreadful day of the Lord. And what is that spirit of Elijah to do? to introduce us to the coming or into the presence of almighty God, introduce us to the Messiah. The prophet of God would say that my mission I believe to the earth is to forrun the coming word. the coming word which is Christ and Christ in him has the millennium and has everything right there because he is the word again the prophet would say and we've got the Messiah this is him the word again the prophet would say amen in Jehovah Gyra part one and 64 he would say the last thing is his divine presence the word itself. He is the word, the head, the word. It's coming to the body. And then he would take us to Hebrews the 4th chapter and show us that the word of God is sharper and more powerful than a two-edged sword and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. And he's identifying that it's his own ministry that is introducing us to the presence of almighty God which is the word and is the Holy Ghost. Now the prophet of God again he would say you see it's known as the Messiah. Now it's not some man here is the Messiah. It's the Holy Spirit is the Messiah. Christ and the Holy Spirit is the same thing. So here it is here now just working in the flesh getting the body ready for the rapturing grace and then the prophet of God says believe it friends. Amen. You see we are living in the identified presence of God and we've got to believe it. Amen. to to to recognize that there is a special grace upon this age and that God has sent us a prophet to introduce us to the presence of almighty God. Amen. That this word that is vindicated among us in this age, it's more than just scriptures. It's more than just quotes. It's it's more than just memorizing Malachi 45 and 6. It's more than just remembering Revelations 10:7 and and Revelations, you know, uh, Revelations 3rd chapter and the Leodysian church age and all of these scriptures. Amen. It's more than just good scriptures, but this is the promise of the word for this age that has been made manifest that you can recognize the presence of God is here among us. Amen. And now you see it's a special grace that God has given the age. Amen. The Bible says that when the enemy comes in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord would raise a standard against him. You see, there's always a special anointing for the time for the season to combat the Antichrist. Ain't that right? Amen. We see that there's there's four horse riders. It's the Antichrist spirit that is riding throughout the seven church ages. But then we find that there is a power of the Holy Ghost or an anointing that goes out to meet that antichrist spirit. And the prophet of God will show, amen, that the overcomers of the age is the ones that come under the anointing that defeats the spirit of antichrist in every age. So we find that there was there was a there was an anointing which was a lion anointing. Amen. And that combed the antichrist spirit. And then we find that there was an ox anointing and then a a man anointing. But the last anointing in the last age is a flying eagle. Hallelujah. The other anointings were earthbound creatures. But in the last days, it's a flying eagle. It's not even just a setting eagle. It's an eagle that is in those heavenly places that has the strength to fly above every spirit that would try to defeat this bride. every spirit of gross darkness. Every spirit of delusion, uh, every spirit that would try to take you young people and destroy your life, uh, this message has brought an anointing upon our life. Uh, and we've got to recognize that it's Christ himself uh that has come among us. It's not a man's message. Uh, it was not William Brandham that was vindicated. It was God sending a prophet that he could use that vessel to identify that it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever that is here among us. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Amen. You see, we're under that eagle anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the prophet of God was saying the fifth seal. He says he brings down the eagle to restore the children back to the original faith again of their fathers the eagle age. You see Revelations 10 1:7 in the fifth seal again all of the mysteries of God would be revealed the eagle. Hallelujah. Again the fifth seal. Don't forget this church. And you brethren on tape, I want you to examine this. How could men do anything else besides the power of God that had been released to them? Well, praise the name of the Lord. Amen. In the days of of that lion anointing, they were under Paul's message and they stood there under that that that boldness of that anointing and withtood that Antichrist spirit. Amen. Then the then that ox anointing, how could they give their lives? How could they run to the to the chopping block? How could they be burnt at the stake? It was because there was an anointing upon their lives. Well, we see what they did with the man anointing. It brought forth a reformation. Amen. It defied that that Roman Catholic spirit. Amen. But you see, we're under a different anointing. This is not an anointing to keep us upon the earth. Uh this is an anointing uh full of quickening power, full of dynamic Holy Ghost uh messianic power to get to not take us through the tribulation but to but to bring a revelation that we're covered by the blood of Jesus Christ. We're an invincible army and God is taking us in a rapture. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't forget this church. We're under a different anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, all of the scriptures that has been proved the vindication of his word and the presence and the hour that we're living is to anoint our faith. &gt;&gt; And Jesus never asked, "Will I find a good person?" &gt;&gt; Listen to me, young people. &gt;&gt; He never asked, "Will I find a righteous person? He never asked, "Will I find a good Christian?" &gt;&gt; He never asked, "Will I find a saint?" &gt;&gt; I'm actually quoting the prophet. He never asked, "Will I find respects?" He never asked, "Will I find a good tithe pair?" &gt;&gt; What he asked, "Will I find faith?" And the prophet of God interprets what Jesus was actually asking is, "Will I find someone that'll take me at my word?" &gt;&gt; Will I find someone that will stand there and say, "The word is right." &gt;&gt; When you're sick, you can stand there in divine presence and say, "I am the God that health all thy diseases." You can stand there when demons are trying to say you're going to lose your children and lift up that token and say, "I will not lose my children. I claim them for the glory of God." When I find a faith, when I find a revelation that is burning in the evening time, they're under that son of man anointing that says Jesus Christ in the power of his resurrection is moving among us. &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now we know what Satan's after. &gt;&gt; He's after our faith. &gt;&gt; Satan has every trick in his bag to discourage this bride. Every scarecrow, every enticing spirit, every spirit of delusion to distract from the reality of this message. Amen. And he's trying to get this bride all locked up in fear. Trying to get this bride in unbelief. Get her get her all in spooks. Amen. Tied up with this and tied up with that and and spooks of to claim the promises of God for your life. Amen. Afraid to quote certain things and to to believe certain things. Amen. Because the devil points you to to some negative somewhere. Well, I just want to say, amen. From Genesis to Revelations, this Bible is an absolute. And I just want to say this message from 47 to 65, uh, it is the absolute of this Bible. It is the word made manifest. It is for your life. It's for your victory. It's for your deliverance. It's for your home. &gt;&gt; You can believe it. You can stand for it. You don't have to be ashamed of Christ. You don't have to be ashamed of his presence. For he's here and he's vindicated his presence among us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Satan's doing his best to paralyze our faith. &gt;&gt; Just like he got Lot to get his eyes on Sodom. &gt;&gt; Mrs. Lot wanted to dress like all the others, you know, and Lot become a a a judge, a leader, sitting at the gate, but the whole time it vexed his righteous soul. &gt;&gt; The whole time he was miserable and yet he couldn't do anything about it because his faith had become paralyzed. And the devil did that. Amen. But you see, the prophet of God showed us that there was another one and it was Moses. And Moses caught a vision of Christ and forsook the world, forsook Egypt, forsook the popularity. He forsook the throne. All because he looked to the promise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And his faith paralyzed the world. And the prophet of God shows us either your faith will paralyze glamour or either the glamour will paralyze your faith. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. But the prophet of God showed us that when a man once catches that vision of the invisible God and know that he's always present, there is something that stabilizes that man's thinking. It stabilizes his actions. And in the time of distress and trouble, it'll still make him look upward and above the things that are happening around him because he's looking at the unseen yet by promise. Well, what did he promise us? He would be here. &gt;&gt; He said, "I will never leave you and I will never forsake you, but I'll be with you low until the end of the world." Then when you catch by the vindicated message of the hour, his presence is here. It'll bring stability to your life. It'll stabilize your home, stabilize your families. You see, it's all because Hebrews 11 and verse 1 and two, faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report. And we know that there in Isaiah it says, "Whoath believed a report? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?" Now the prophet of God, he picked that up in the seals and says, "Believe the report and the power of God will be revealed to you." showing you that what was taking place at the opening of the word was the power of God being revealed. &gt;&gt; So believe the report and the power of God will be revealed in your [screaming] life. &gt;&gt; Everyone's trying to figure it out and they're missing the whole thing. Believe it and the power will come. &gt;&gt; Believe you're healed and the power to heal you is here. Believe you're going in a rapture. And the power to rapture [screaming] you is here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't have to work it up. You don't have to sing it down. You don't have to. It It's here. &gt;&gt; I told you I'm a simple preacher, but I believe this. &gt;&gt; I believe the dynamics have come to the mechanics. And I believe everything this bride has been needing for a victorious overcoming life is here. &gt;&gt; All things are possible. &gt;&gt; To them that believe. &gt;&gt; Without faith it is impossible to please God. But with faith it unlocks heaven. &gt;&gt; It unlocks every promise of God. Now the prophet of God would actually let us know that God has to have believers. It it he can't work through anything but faith. So he predestinated believers to meet that word in every age to meet the challenge of the age. Now, brother Brandham would say now he he said that and then he says now he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age. Did it get you? Did you feel it? Did you see it? Do do you understand it? That's what's happening today. He predestinated it to this by his fornowledge when he predestinated in Malachi 4. It's got to happen. So what did he predestinate in Malachi 4? that the hearts of the children would be turned back to the original faith. &gt;&gt; So when Jesus was asking the question, will I find faith? He knew that Malachi 4 had already been written and that in the season of the last days when the son of man would be revealed, Malachi 4 would come into effect to turn our faith back to the original. So Jesus wasn't saying there, I sure hope we got some faith. I sure hope when the son of man is revealed that we're going to have this kind of persistent faith. Jesus knew exactly what he was saying, but he was identifying the kind of faith that he was going to be turning back to the original fathers. It's going to be a faith that knows God and the power of his resurrection. It's going to be a faith that can hold on to the promise and call those things that be not. as though they already are. It's going to be a royal seed faith that when you're down, but there's a power to get you back up. The devil looks like he's destroyed you and destroy your home, but there is a resurrection power that is within you that says, "You can try to destroy me. You can try to destroy my home, [screaming] but I'll raise it up." Nothing can defeat this bride. &gt;&gt; Oh my. When he predestinated in Malachi 4, it's got to happen. When he come over and predestinates anything to happen in his word, he had to prove his word to be so. Are you ready for it? When he predestinates anything to happen and says that it'll happen, he knows that seed will be there just at that time. He predestinated a bride. She's going to be there. Going to be a rapture. She's going to be there. &gt;&gt; He predestinates it by his fornowledge. There's nothing going to stop it. &gt;&gt; No wonder the prophet could look at you and say, "You're an invisible army." When you discern the two spirits within the framework of the church that Satan is trying to make this bride lukewarm and powerless, but yet you discern that spirit and you see what Satan's trying to do and you refuse to knock down for the devil because you recognize the presence of almighty God is among us. Then you are an invincible army. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Nothing can withstand you. Praise the name of the Lord &gt;&gt; because you're predestinated. &gt;&gt; You see the woman at the well, the prophet of God says that when Jesus said, "I have needs to go by Samaria." Can I can I can I just say it a little bit the way that I see it? You can take it. Take it or leave it. But let let me just put it like this. Jesus had been called Beelzeub. &gt;&gt; He had been called uh you know the son of a drunken soldier. He'd been called all kinds of names by those religious spirits. &gt;&gt; And I let me just say like this. Jesus must have just got fed up with it. &gt;&gt; I'm going to their church and they're kicking me out. &gt;&gt; I go tell them this day this scriptur is fulfilled and they try to throw me over the hill. &gt;&gt; They're always against the vindicated word made manifest. And then the day come he says, "I just need to go by Samaria." &gt;&gt; You know what he's going to do? He's going to go find some faith. He's going to go by He's going to go by Samaria and there's going to be a prostitute who's been married five times and the one she's with is not even her husband and she's an outcast from all the other systems. &gt;&gt; No one else wants to be identified with her. Amen. But yet Jesus says, "I need to go by Samaria because I need to find some faith." And when he begins to discern her heart, she says, "You're the Messiah. You're the one that we've been hearing about." And she identified his presence. You know what did for her? The old scripture. Now, this is what the prophet of God says. The old scripture with the experience that Jesus was giving her made the real Messiah. And she recognized him. and she dropped her old water pot. She dropped her old her old religious thinking and she ran back into that very city and said, "Come and see a man who told me everything I've done. Is not this the Messiah?" Well, I I just want to say, Amen. People are trying to say that, you know, Brother Brandham is gone and the message is dead and and and and God's not a discerner anymore. Well, let me just tell you this. Amen. The prophet went to his reward. But that same Holy Ghost, that same Messiah, that same logos, the word is still riding this trail. He's still discerning your heart. He knows what you're going through. He knows your symptoms. He knows your situations. And he's here letting you know that I'm here to do the exceedingly abundantly above. all that you could even ask &gt;&gt; or even imagine. You see, it's the same word. It's the same Christ that the prophet introduced us to. And what is it? It's all of those prophecies, all of those scriptures that have been laying there, all of those things saying what he would be in this last days with the new experience that God has given you, even in this camp, &gt;&gt; letting you know that he's passing by your way. &gt;&gt; And all he's looking for is not your credentials. He's not looking for how much you know. He's not looking for you to be able to quote and quote after quote after quote or scripture after scripture after scripture. What he's looking for is someone to identify his presence and reach out and touch him. &gt;&gt; Will I find that kind of persistence? They hear my voice. They recognize it's me. And they reach out and get a hold of my promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what God's looking for. &gt;&gt; That's what we've been turned back to. Amen. You see, we've got the Messiah. [sighs] It's just waiting for somebody with faith to anoint it and make it live again. &gt;&gt; Why? You mean to tell me that every promise is laying here just as good as they always have been, but they're laying here in seed form. But if that seed can fall into your heart and you would begin to anoint that promise with faith, with praise and worship, and say, "I believe it, Lord. I believe you're the same yesterday, today, and forever is the Messiah." And he becomes alive in your life. &gt;&gt; You see, faith comes by the word. Now, now how many how many remembers the prophet of God says this is the word age. &gt;&gt; Actually, the prophet would say this is his age, God's age, the word age. So, we've got to lay out a sea age, which is lukewarm. &gt;&gt; They've kicked Christ out of the church. They don't want any anything to do with the power of God in demonstration. They don't believe for those things. And that's what has kept the people of God living a million miles below their God-given privileges. &gt;&gt; Preachers under that denominational influence telling the people that God can't and God can't and God can't and God can't. But then God says, "Well, I'm going to just separate myself from that that age, and I'm going to go ahead and make my own age. It's going to be the word age." &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet of God says it's actually an eagle age. &gt;&gt; And then I'm going to identify this bride and say it's her age. It's going to be the bride age. And he's letting you know that this is where the Messiah is. Because Leoa kicked him out. They kicked his presence out of their camps. They kicked him out of their denominations. But there's a bride that has suffered with him outside the gates. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they've come into a personal relationship with God &gt;&gt; in his age. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now in this word age, faith comes by hearing, hearing the word. &gt;&gt; And this is what makes you do things so foolish the to the world. &gt;&gt; You know what kind of foolishness? What's what's foolish to the world? It's believing that God can fill you with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; To actually turn in your Bible and believe that everything he did in this Bible, he's manifesting in your life. And to the rest of the world, you become a nut. You become an oddball. You just be, you've lost your mind. Well, let me just go ahead and help the world out. I have lost my mind. And it's good riddance. I didn't like my mind anyways. It was my mind that was always reasoning against the promise. But we have entered into his mind in his age where the word is bringing faith and faith is touching a hold of the word and it's bringing the promises of God into manifestation. &gt;&gt; Now, now you're going to be called a lot of crazy names, but let's just let's just look at what the Bible calls you. Saints. You see, the Bible actually calls you the called out ones. &gt;&gt; You see, called out, separated from all unbelief. &gt;&gt; Now, the word himself, which was Jesus Christ in the beginning, John 1 and one, in the beginning was the word, the word was with God, the word was God, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. It's the word himself that begin the faith. Pet Paul didn't start the faith. Peter didn't start the faith. It was the son of man. The word made flesh that started the faith. So we're not just restored back to just a certain faith, but we're resto restored back to the original the faith which is the son of man. So in the last days, Jesus said right before we read uh there there in Luke the 18th chapter, he said, "Hey, as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man." What was Jesus doing? He was prophesying him a place in the last days that the word would be made flesh again and the word would restore us back to the original the faith. And there would be a group of people that would recognize that this is the same Jesus Christ. And you're called out and separated from all unbelief to tie yourself to the word to believe in all things. Now &gt;&gt; this and we again this is not just a certain man-made faith but this is a super faith. Th this far supersedes anything that any system can create. This is actually the faith of God that if you say unto this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea. If you have the faith of God, you speak the word and it'll take place. &gt;&gt; Now, so this is a mountain moving faith. This is a creative faith. This is the faith of God that can operate the power of God. &gt;&gt; You see, there's thousands of voices vying for the influence of your life. But then there's a vindicated voice. a vindicated voice that my sheep hear my voice out of all the other thousands of influences. And the prophet says those voices deadens the voice of the supernatural, but my sheep hear my voice and another they will not follow. That's why Jesus said, "I will come to you and I'm going to be your guide because I'm going to be the voice over my church." You see, the prophet of God would say the end time message should meet end time conditions. Where they've got off, the message ought to bring it back. It's a call back to the original word. And the prophet of God would show us that there is actually uninspired leadership that are actually taking the word of God and explaining it away and saying that God can't do that. But you see, the prophet of God says this message is going to meet the challenge of that uninspired leadership &gt;&gt; where they got off where they where where they put a crutch on our faith. But the vindicated message of the hour will fix the thing and will bring us from uninspired to inspired leadership that we are following the leadership of the Holy Ghost. Where does the Holy Ghost take us? To the word. &gt;&gt; It anoints our hearts to believe the word. So where they kept us a million miles below our God-given privileges, but the message of the hour has told us believe for all things. Take the limits off of your faith. As much faith you can release is how much power you can have. So, you know what it is? You just keep believing. &gt;&gt; Keep believing. &gt;&gt; Keep believing. That's why the prophet of God says, "I am God's voice to you." He said, "Now, I I was going to apologize for it, but then he come back again and said, I am God's voice to you." What was he doing? He was letting you know that you can believe this message. Well, praise the name of the Lord. Amen. The same could be said of Moses in that Exodus. The same could be said of Paul when when he says, "Though though we or an angel from heaven say anything than what has already been spoke, let him be accursed." Amen. What is he doing? It was the same pillar of fire that vindicated Moses message, vindicated Paul's message, and it's come in the last days to vindicate that we've got the correct interpretation of scripture. &gt;&gt; So, you don't have to add to it. You don't have to take away from it. You just simply take the message of the hour as sheep food. And at that day, you shall know that I'm not in a group, but I'm in an individual individual and I'll be in the believer. And I don't care if you're a six-year-old or a 10year-old or a 20-year-old or a hundred year old. I'm looking for faith. And at that day you will know, the individual is going to know that the father is in me and I in you and you and me and there is a oneness together. You know what this is going to be? It's going to be a prevailing revelation. The message of the hour that is anointing your faith and faith is a revelation and it's anointing you for victory. Amen. &gt;&gt; For faith is the victory that overcomes the world. &gt;&gt; You know, I and I'm just I'm I'm going to wind it down, but let me just say it like this. The prophet of God in the sermon, he that is in you, he actually is going to for the first time, he's going to tell us how that there was a a storm that was spoken out of existence. Y'all remember that in the sermon, he that is in you. And then he actually be to walk with God &gt;&gt; because God says, why don't you walk with me? &gt;&gt; And then we find him how that he stepped in another dimension and in and every principle he become a young man and seen his wife and she was a young young woman. Y'all y'all remember that? &gt;&gt; Now the prophet of God begins to let us know it's he that is in you. He that is in you is greater than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; And he begins to show you that this world belongs to the devil. &gt;&gt; But yet it's Christ who has redeemed your dirt. &gt;&gt; And Christ has stepped into a boy, into a girl, into a housewife, into a farmer, into a mechanic. Amen. &gt;&gt; He that has redeemed you and he that abides in you is greater than the spirits that is trying to conquer you. &gt;&gt; Will I find that kind of a faith to put their shoulders back and say greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. This is the victory. This is the prevailing revelation that overcomes the world. Remember gross darkness, but in the evening time there shall be light. Light is the word made manifest. And the prophet of God says, "Ye are the light of the world." You are the word made manifest. Will I find faith that can realize who you are and set and stand up toe-to-toe with the devil and say, "Greater is he that is in me than he that is in this world." He now he take us to Daniel the lions. Then he says now those lions would be tame. They would be calm. But it's the devil that God influenced those lines. &gt;&gt; But we find out that greater is he that was in Daniel than he the devil that was in those lines. &gt;&gt; He says in the millennium the lion will will will will eat grass like the ox. You see there won't be any devil to hinder it. Then he shows us that it was the devil that got into that fiery furnace. It was the devil that put put a sting there that to conquer the to destroy God's children. But you see, greater is he that was in the Hebrew boys than he that was in that fiery furnace, church, what are you going through? What faith has been restored to us in this hour that we can we can tow the line with the devil and say, "Satan, you're not taking my children. You're not taking my health. You're not taking my mind. I refuse this weary spirit that is trying to make me a weak Christian and trying to tell me that I don't got what it takes. &gt;&gt; I tell you, we're in the greatest battle ever fought. &gt;&gt; And it's all because God has given us a revelation of who we are. And we're stepping into our position as sons and daughters of God. Just as those stars in the heavens are in their place, these stars, sons and daughters of God, are stepping into their place by the message of the hour and saying, "Satan, get out of here." &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet of God would say, "Now, will I find that kind of a faith &gt;&gt; like that woman who was a widow?" And we could we could we could take parallels here. How you know widow her husband's dead. Let's just put it like you and I. That old denominational system, that old thing that ruled you, it's dead. And she realized [gasps] that the one who could give her her need was that unjust judge. Now, the Bible clearly says he's unjust, but yet she he's the one that can help her in her situation. &gt;&gt; So, she comes boldly before his door and begins to knock. Now, he's already in bed and he don't want to deal with this woman. So, he's just trying to ignore her, but she doesn't just knock three times and then say, "Well, I guess I'm just not going to get my answer." And then just goes back home disappointed. She realizes he's the one that can that can that can redeem the situation. &gt;&gt; Now, let's imagine you're trying to sleep. and you've got someone outside your door. And I don't care if you don't want to deal with that person. Now, that person who's got the need doesn't m they don't care how annoying they sound. &gt;&gt; They don't care how odd they look. &gt;&gt; The passer by is saying, "Well, look at her. What a strange sight. She's the one with the need. She's the one that's desperate. &gt;&gt; So, she's the one that's going to be persistent. &gt;&gt; And finally, that unjust judge comes out, says because she's going to weary me. &gt;&gt; I can't get her off of my hands. &gt;&gt; So, she he goes and gives her her heart's desire all because she's persistent. But notice that faith, &gt;&gt; the faith that is in her, though he's unjust, but she recognizes that he's the one that can give the answer. &gt;&gt; That's where Jesus said, will I kind find find that kind of faith that can recognize there's my answer and then stick with it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Will I kind will I find that kind of faith that says I am on your hands. Now I'm quoting the prophet says you've got to get tired. You you get tired of listening. Now now he's actually saying this how how a believer has got to talk to God. &gt;&gt; He says you get tired of listening. I'm having a great time knocking &gt;&gt; cuz I know you're coming. That's when something happens. He has to get you off his hands. So, he comes uh he comes to answer you. How faith finds this. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says that's how you got to be. God, I'm on your hands. &gt;&gt; Throughout this whole meeting, &gt;&gt; when brother John is preaching in the morning, you got to come with the mentality, Lord, I'm on your hands. the evening service. I'm on your hands, God. I'm persistent, God. I'm a believer, God. I I have been taught by a vindicated word that your presence is here. I recognize you're real. I recognize you're here. And I have come with an expectation. There's something that's burning in my heart. And I take no for an answer, God. I'm on your hands. And he'll show up. [screaming] He promised to meet your needs according to his riches and glory. &gt;&gt; There's no need to have habits hanging on your life. &gt;&gt; There's no need to have some generational curse binding you. And the devil's saying, "Well, that's just the way it was in it's in your family line." That's a that's nonsense. The blood of Jesus Christ has dealt with every generational curse. I say come with an expectation to see the supernatural make manifest in your life. Uh just like we heard about the young people that said we want to see a supernatural God. Amen. And you put that you just put a line in the sand and said we're going to see God this this camp or else. And God showed up. You got to get desperate with God. If you're sick, get desperate with God. Mamas, if you need a need for your home, get desperate with God. But don't don't you got to come with faith now and you got to come [screaming] to do war. &gt;&gt; Say I believe the promise of God. &gt;&gt; It's my dominion. &gt;&gt; This is my dominion and the strength. This message is the strength to rise you above every situation. &gt;&gt; Every trial, every spirit of oppression. When your heart says yes to the promise and yes to the yes to every word, then you step into your inheritance and say, "I believe the promise of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. Let the musicians come. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. We know this by heart. For the prophet of God says, "The son of man is Christ. &gt;&gt; He is the one you're feeding on." You're not feeding on a man. A man his words will fail, but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man. &gt;&gt; When the son of man comes, will he find faith? And I say yes. I say yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who will agree with me? &gt;&gt; Yes, he'll find faith because I'm here. I'm predestinated to believe. I'm predestinated to get answers. I'm predestinated to see this word made manifest in my life. Hallelujah. If there's only one going to get anything out of this camp, it's me. &gt;&gt; I I I'm just being honest with you. I didn't come all the way from Ohio, United States, just to come here. I come here to get a blessing from God. I come here to pre to preach a a gospel to a predestinated group of people that can grab a hold of the promise of God and see God made manifest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe we're going to see testimony upon testimony, miracle, healing, deliverance. It's because it's what he promised. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said, "If I be lifted up, I'll draw all men unto me." And this message is what we're waving over your life. &gt;&gt; Oh, you hear the prophet of God say, "When you recognize this message is eagle food, you've heard from your theophony." [music] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Your theophony telling you just go ahead and keep eating. &gt;&gt; Just go ahead. That's what I'm needing. Just go ahead. Keep eating. Keep eating that eagle food. Hallelujah. It's got the nourishment. It's got the vitamins. It's got the power. Not under the influence of of a man. We're not in under the influence of a certain certain group. We're under the influence of the Holy Ghost, under the influence of the power of the word. I tell you, amen. It's calling. Come up higher. Believe me, for every promise. Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Go ahead, Russ. You are here. You are here. I worship you. I worship you. You are here in reveal. You don't have to put it off for the second service. The Lord Jesus is [music] here right now. Maybe you've come with a situation and there's something [music] burning in your heart that you want to be free for the rest of this this meeting. Why? [music] Why don't you just be free?

I mean, stop telling the devil. Stop letting the devil tell you your future. You start telling the enemy his future. Amen. Satan, every promise of God is mine. I'm a son or daughter of God. It's mine today. Amen. Why? Cuz God is among us here to release that desire into our lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad? &gt;&gt; Yeah. When Jesus asked that question, will he find faith? He already had you in his mind to fulfill that scripture. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I'm so thankful. Amen. Praise the Lord.

Lord, you had needs to come by this camp this weekend, Lord, to speak to our hearts, to speak to our lives, Lord, to reveal who we really are, dear God. Thank you, Father, when you ask that question. Will I find faith? Hallelujah. Here we are, Lord. You've made us believers. It's your faith in our hearts that we believe by. Hallelujah. Not human faith, the supernatural divine faith. We're so thankful for this, my God. We thank you, Lord. Every divine pre uh promise of God that you've given us, Lord, has been released, Lord. The power to believe it and take hold of it, Lord, has been released through the word, Lord Jesus. and you're here to prove it, to vindicate in our lives. Oh, how thankful we are. Oh, we praise your great name. Thank you for the power of your blood, my God. We give you glory this night, Father. Thank you for the service, Lord. I pray dear God and Lord, that that Lord, through this weekend, may you just continue to brood over us, Lord. May our hearts be sensitive and open, oh God. Father, every excuse that would cause us not to believe your word, may it just blow away in the wind, Lord. May faith rise in every heart, dear God. Just to take you at your word, Lord. To take you at your word, my God. That's all we need to do, Lord. Only believe, Lord. And we believe your word, Lord. We believe your promises. We believe you, Lord.
