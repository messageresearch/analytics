[36:39] you said If We Gather in Your Name Lord
[36:41] you'll be there in the midst so father I
[36:43] pray as we have gathered I pray you
[36:45] would touch each life may have your way
[36:47] Lord we need you to come and take over
[36:49] the service so Lord I surrender all that
[36:51] I am into your hands Lord may have
[36:53] preeminence in our midst Lord may you be
[36:54] glorified and father may take your word
[36:57] that we read and may you the great
[36:58] author of the book step forth step forth

[37:03] we love you we thank you Lord we pray
[37:05] you'd be with those who are not here
[37:06] today as well be their abundant portion
[37:08] for your glory Lord in Jesus Christ's
[37:10] name amen amen God bless you friends you
[37:13] can have your seats uh this morning uh
[37:15] so I want to uh if I could take a bit of
[37:17] a title and you know I probably get in
[37:19] trouble doing these kind of titles I
[37:20] never get to it all but I want to say
[37:23] fulfill your scripture analyze the lamb
[37:26] and take your moment so I'm going to try
[37:29] and get through those things amen so it
[37:31] was a must have been an incredible
[37:33] moment when when the word made flesh
[37:36] opened the written word and identified
[37:38] himself in the scripture must have been
[37:41] an incredible moment we read here that
[37:43] he when he was given to him the book of
[37:45] the um Isaiah he found the place where
[37:48] it was written so he wasn't just finding
[37:50] he wasn't just finding a scripture that
[37:52] was a nice thing to quote but he was
[37:54] identifying the word made flesh was
[37:57] identif if in himself in the written
[37:59] word and he was saying this day is the
[38:01] scripture fulfilled so Jesus knew the
[38:03] scriptures he had come to fulfill right
[38:06] he wasn't he wasn't a stab in the- dark
[38:08] Fly by Night kind of a guy he knew
[38:10] exactly the reason he was upon the earth
[38:12] now we know because of his birth he was
[38:15] born without sin he bypassed the
[38:17] original sin so when he was born he knew
[38:20] who he was he was not born with
[38:21] spiritual Amnesia he never came to a
[38:24] time in his life where where where he
[38:26] realized who he was but he knew who he
[38:28] was when he was the age of 12 and you
[38:30] know his um his uh foster parents or
[38:32] however you want to say it Mary and
[38:33] Joseph they took him to Jerusalem for
[38:35] the feast and you know they they they
[38:37] after the feast they uh went back to
[38:39] Nazareth and they were traveling three
[38:41] days they realized Jesus was not with
[38:43] them and they went back to Jerusalem and
[38:45] you'd think that a 12year old boy or 10
[38:47] sorry I can't remember the age exactly
[38:49] but you can go read it in the scripture
[38:51] You' think a 12-year-old boy or that
[38:53] kind of age wouldn't be in the wouldn't
[38:55] be in the temple discussing the Bible
[38:57] he'd be looking at the maybe the Roman
[38:58] soldiers and the garrisons I'm just
[39:00] thinking what I would be looking at you
[39:02] know all the all the big fortifications
[39:03] maybe the tomb of David I don't know
[39:05] you'd be looking at those kind of things
[39:07] but he was he was they found him in the
[39:09] temple disc discussing the word with the
[39:12] priest and Mary uh Mary spoke against
[39:16] her own testimony and said you know your
[39:18] father and I have sought you with tears
[39:19] and Jesus said don't you know I must be
[39:21] about my father's business so even as a
[39:24] little boy he knew the purpose that he
[39:25] came to the Earth for now
[39:28] we must fulfill our scripture amen we
[39:31] got scripture to fulfill now and it's
[39:33] not about whether what we think about
[39:36] what everyone else is doing it's what we
[39:38] do that matters amen as as Jesus on the
[39:41] day well after he arose and Peter would
[39:43] ask him the great question about the he
[39:45] said Peter then turning about seeth the
[39:47] disciple whom Jesus love following which
[39:50] also leaned on uh his breast at supper
[39:53] and said Lord what will he that uh which
[39:55] is he that betrayeth the so even know
[39:57] was Judas and then Peter um seeing him
[40:00] saith to Jesus Lord what shall this man
[40:03] do isn't this human isn't this human
[40:06] nature what's that person doing why is
[40:08] this person doing this why is this
[40:09] person doing that why is this person
[40:11] doing this thing but what about you what
[40:14] because we're all going to fulfill
[40:15] scripture the world's fulfilling
[40:17] scripture I don't want to fulfill their
[40:19] scripture I want to fulfill the bride's
[40:21] portion of the scripture so but
[40:23] everyone's oh what about this person
[40:24] this hypocrite this person did this this
[40:26] person did that this person but what
[40:28] about you and I that's why Jesus said to
[40:31] him said what if it will uh what he
[40:34] saith unto him if I will that he tar
[40:37] till I come what is it to thee so if
[40:39] it's my will that he fulfills what you
[40:41] think he's going to fulfill what is it
[40:42] to you just follow me amen so I think
[40:45] that should be our our hearts cry or our
[40:48] Drive of our life is if everyone else
[40:50] does whatever they do I'm going to
[40:52] fulfill the scripture I'm going to let
[40:53] God in my life fulfill his word amen if
[40:56] there's one person on the earth that
[40:58] God's going to fulfill his word it's
[40:59] going to be me amen irrespective of what
[41:02] you all do what everyone else does I'm
[41:05] going to follow I'm going to follow the
[41:06] lord he said come follow me so here I am
[41:09] I'm following you Lord I'm I'm following
[41:10] your revealed word of the day amen so so
[41:13] so Jesus knew who he was in the
[41:16] scripture and I believe it behooves us
[41:18] that we identify we allow the Holy Ghost
[41:20] himself the author of the word to
[41:22] identify our lives in the scripture amen
[41:26] that that that we can see the prophecy
[41:28] we're ordained to fulfill because we
[41:30] know that Jesus fulfilled a lot of
[41:32] Prophecy and it wasn't by accident he
[41:34] fulfilled it it was with purpose it was
[41:36] deliberate amen he knew exactly what he
[41:38] needed to fulfill and he surrendered his
[41:41] life to the prophecy that he had to
[41:43] fulfill and I believe we must do the
[41:45] same
[41:45] thing amen because when we can see
[41:48] ourselves in the scripture then that
[41:50] gives us power when God reveals to us
[41:52] who we are in the scripture we can
[41:54] fulfill it amen so let's not be caught
[41:57] up in what everyone else wants to do
[41:58] let's be caught up in what God wants
[42:01] fulfilled as the portion of the Bride
[42:03] amen so now Moses would Moses when he
[42:06] was born we know his his parents it was
[42:09] revealed to them by faith that he was
[42:11] going to be the deliverer so it was it
[42:14] was the Jews all knew that the deliverer
[42:16] was going to come they knew the prophecy
[42:18] given to Abraham that the that the
[42:20] children of Israel would be in Egypt 400
[42:22] years they'd be afflicted they'd be
[42:24] slaves but they'd come out with a mighty
[42:26] hand right so so the whole Jewish nation
[42:28] was under a burden of the economics and
[42:32] the situation they are in like this
[42:33] whole world is under a burden this
[42:35] world's Fallen apart the prophet said it
[42:37] you can't stop it just walk with God
[42:40] okay we can't stop it we can't reverse
[42:42] it when that when that word was released
[42:44] when he was preaching sermons like the
[42:45] world again is falling apart he wasn't
[42:47] just saying things you know just for the
[42:49] sake of it it was an announcement this
[42:52] is where you're going to walk into and
[42:53] us that weren't alive in that era we
[42:55] were born in a world that's Fallen part
[42:58] that's why it's amazing you think we've
[42:59] got so much good technology the world is
[43:01] so connected but yet everything doesn't
[43:03] work doesn't make sense you know back in
[43:06] the days of pen and paper things seemed
[43:08] to work a lot smoother than today how
[43:10] long do we have to wait for a gp's visit
[43:13] now yet we have all this technology you
[43:16] know all this ability our hospitals are
[43:18] falling apart but yet we have all this
[43:19] better medicine all these things why
[43:21] because God inspired a prophet to say
[43:24] the world has fallen apart right so we
[43:26] shouldn't be be shocked to see this
[43:27] world is falling apart amen but but but
[43:30] we should should be thankful when the
[43:31] world is falling apart God is calling a
[43:34] bride amen he's putting a people upon
[43:36] the Earth that are bone of his bone
[43:37] flesh of his flesh life of his life she
[43:40] is him the prophet said amen says a
[43:42] people made in His image amen so if the
[43:44] word there if the if if the bridegroom
[43:47] could identify himself in the word the
[43:50] bride sure should be able to as well by
[43:52] the same inspiration am mean so so we
[43:54] know Moses's um you know Moses's the
[43:57] Israelites they were all slaves in Egypt
[43:59] so the whole Israelite race you could
[44:01] say was under that oppression but but
[44:03] there was amram and joab bed you brother
[44:05] BR would dramatize it you know you know
[44:07] amram would come back from the fields he
[44:09] was beaten he was a slave like anyone
[44:11] else but he'd go up on his house stop
[44:13] and begin to pray because he knew there
[44:15] was scripture that had to be fulfilled I
[44:17] mean he knew that there' had to come a
[44:18] deliverer and the time was approaching
[44:20] for that deliver to come upon the scene
[44:22] and you know joab would you know said to
[44:24] her husband amram said you know you
[44:26] don't have to pray today just come get
[44:28] some rest you're so exhausted you're so
[44:30] tired but he said but what if no one
[44:31] else is praying about him I want to see
[44:34] I want to fulfill my scripture amen I
[44:36] want to fulfill prophecy and we're being
[44:37] placed as the Covenant Sons and
[44:39] Daughters of Abraham amen that God will
[44:41] fulfill scripture in our lives so it
[44:43] might as well be through US joed amen
[44:45] and then they had the son many other
[44:47] families had Sons but by faith by
[44:49] Revelation they realized this is the one
[44:52] this is the one and they H him for 3
[44:54] months and they but they came to a place
[44:55] just like anything with God you got to
[44:57] give it to him you got to give it to him
[44:59] amen like he says Jesus says in the
[45:01] Bible he that keeps his life shall lose
[45:04] it but he that loses his life shall keep
[45:08] it what does that mean if you lose your
[45:09] life if you give it to the Lord you'll
[45:11] keep it in the end but if you keep your
[45:12] life and your ideas and what you want to
[45:14] do and your own idea and your plans and
[45:16] your things you you'll lose your life at
[45:18] the end that's right all the plans and
[45:19] schemes of man will come to ashes and
[45:22] and just disgrace and destruction I'd
[45:24] rather walk with God amen amen so they
[45:27] put him in that boat they put him in
[45:28] that little Ark that they made and you
[45:30] know brother BR would say that there was
[45:32] you know God told Gabriel to stand on
[45:33] the top of that boat am mean any
[45:35] Alligators come along here just you just
[45:37] push them on the nose and push them away
[45:39] from that away from that little Ark and
[45:40] you know there are angels lying down the
[45:42] river bank and your God allowed that Ark
[45:44] to get into into some WP pools right but
[45:47] he knew it was had to get to Pharaoh's
[45:49] house it had to get to Pharaoh's
[45:50] daughter because God had ordained that
[45:52] the that that that God was going to use
[45:54] Egypt to raise up a deliverer to destroy
[45:56] Egypt
[45:57] hallelujah it's the same thing with you
[45:58] and I friends we may be raised up in
[46:00] Satan's Eden but God raises up in
[46:02] Satan's Eden to tear down Satan's Eden
[46:05] hallelujah amen so you may get through
[46:07] some whps in life maybe some sticky
[46:09] situations but you got to realize your
[46:11] destination is secure I mean cuz you're
[46:14] not driving the ark God's directing the
[46:16] ark Hallelujah so there Moses was
[46:19] directed There why cuz because his
[46:21] parents wanted the scripture to be
[46:23] fulfilled in their house in their life
[46:27] not just in Israel in their life and it
[46:29] should be the same thing with you and I
[46:31] yes God's going to have a bride don't
[46:32] just put it on some dispensational level
[46:34] around the world which it is but hey say
[46:37] Lord here I am mold me into the image of
[46:39] your word Lord change me mold me that
[46:42] when you see me you see you hallelujah
[46:46] amen hey we got scripture to fulfill
[46:48] friends it's exciting because when you
[46:50] realize this scripture to fulfill then
[46:52] you say Lord I cannot do it Lord you're
[46:54] going to have to get a hold of me you're
[46:55] going to have to change my life Moses
[46:57] thought he could fulfill his scripture
[46:59] because remember when Abraham was told
[47:02] by God you know the prophecy of they're
[47:04] going to be in the land for 100 years
[47:05] all those things God did not say to
[47:09] Abraham that Moses would be the
[47:11] deliverer but when God spoke it to
[47:13] Abraham God knew who was going to be the
[47:16] deliverer right so there's Prophecy in
[47:18] the Bible you say well John the Baptist
[47:20] name was never mentioned but when God
[47:21] said I'll send a message before my face
[47:23] he knew it was
[47:25] John amen you know he knew those things
[47:28] the disciples and the bride of Christ
[47:30] that God prophesied of there' be a
[47:33] people that God will call from the
[47:34] Gentiles for his name sake he had you on
[47:37] his mind when he spoke those things
[47:39] hallelujah amen so just because
[47:42] someone's name's not in the Bible
[47:43] doesn't mean they're not part of the
[47:44] prophecy no you just find yourself
[47:46] lining up with the word god gets a hold
[47:48] of your life amen you just find yourself
[47:50] living it out glory to God what and you
[47:53] begin to realize I've been prophesied of
[47:56] I've been spoken
[47:57] I'd come here and I've been spoken of
[47:59] that I'd arriv I mean when God when
[48:01] brother Braham showed God the preview of
[48:03] the Bride marching up into Glory he saw
[48:08] me I believe that and I'm not marching
[48:11] I'm not being led by a witch going down
[48:13] I'm going up AR raid in his
[48:15] righteousness fine L and clean and white
[48:17] the rushes of saints Made In His Image
[48:19] marching to the step of the Gospel I
[48:22] mean some of us maybe begin to look at
[48:23] the worldly church and get distracted I
[48:25] say stay in line
[48:27] amen the the Christianity of this world
[48:29] will take you down this message will
[48:31] take you up am mean I want to go up I
[48:33] don't want to go down amen I want to
[48:35] ascend in glory amen walk with God know
[48:37] the power of God know the reality of his
[48:39] word Christianity this world could not
[48:41] give that to you but the author of the
[48:43] book amen the mighty Angel himself can
[48:45] give it to you amen so I think just stay
[48:48] in line with this word you'll see it
[48:49] manifest itself hallelujah hallelujah
[48:52] amen like sister Louis suang the song
[48:54] you know God remind me of where I came
[48:56] from I came from a very dark place
[48:59] incredibly dark place of a lost drunk
[49:01] University student doing my own thing
[49:03] floating with the world very dark place
[49:06] but God found me through the message in
[49:07] the Bible didn't even know a church was
[49:09] anywhere God found me God found me I
[49:12] don't want to go back to that place I
[49:14] don't want to be back in that unbelief
[49:15] and that darkness and that chaos and
[49:17] that depression I don't want to go there
[49:19] I want to keep going forward with the
[49:20] Lord but but the reason that we remember
[49:23] those things is because God wants us to
[49:25] stay thankful amen what's the point of
[49:28] doing something for someone and they
[49:29] forget what you've
[49:31] done amen he want he doesn't let us
[49:34] remember those things that we stay in
[49:36] guilt and condemnation no the blood
[49:38] takes care of that but he he allows us
[49:41] to remember those things that we say
[49:43] thank you Lord I'm not that person thank
[49:45] you Lord I become one with you I'm
[49:46] ascending hallelujah hallelujah so I I
[49:50] you I'm so thankful that we don't have
[49:52] to stay in slavery that there's a word
[49:55] for us to fulfill yeah
[49:57] it's very important that we we fulfill
[50:00] our scripture and not what the devil
[50:02] says we are it's very important that
[50:05] because the devil wants an image that he
[50:07] wants to mold you
[50:08] into this world is you know what is this
[50:11] world is a great advertisement the
[50:13] devil's by saying become like
[50:16] me he's got many different things he
[50:18] wants to mold you into but he's saying
[50:21] become like me that's why social media
[50:23] is so prevalent that's why there's such
[50:24] a strong you know anointing
[50:28] but but God rich in Mercy amen but God
[50:33] remember when the enemy comes in like a
[50:34] flood amen God says I'll raise up a
[50:36] standard amen he'll make the promises
[50:38] more real he'll make his anointing more
[50:41] prevalent among us because like brother
[50:43] Braham said God's been here the whole
[50:44] time he's been here the whole time he
[50:46] hasn't left he's been here the whole
[50:47] time but brother brah said his ministry
[50:50] was to declare that he is here amen that
[50:52] the word himself is here upon the Earth
[50:55] and what happens when we read the word
[50:56] we're spiritual blindness we can't see
[50:58] we think Jesus what some story somewhere
[51:00] 2,000 years ago and some tradition that
[51:02] man is used to just control people or
[51:05] something but then when he steps out of
[51:07] the portal of History to us when he
[51:09] steps out of History because we read his
[51:11] word we see he's a present tense God
[51:13] he's been here the whole time just like
[51:15] brother tazwell said a a a revelation is
[51:18] an unveiling it's an unveiling of what's
[51:21] already present right so in Moses was
[51:24] the deliverer but he was hiled up by
[51:27] tradition he was wearing a traditional
[51:30] jacket of I can do
[51:32] it I can do it why cuz he was trained he
[51:35] was trained he was a prince of Egypt he
[51:37] was a he was a God he was a god walking
[51:40] in flesh see the devil will make you
[51:42] something the perverted way of what you
[51:44] meant to be the perverted way of what
[51:47] you meant to be so so Egypt would mold
[51:49] him a certain way you're a God in flesh
[51:51] Moses cuz you're a prince of Egypt but
[51:53] God was saying no no I've got to take
[51:54] this jacket of self-ability off
[51:57] he tried to use that jacket it just made
[51:58] him end up killing one Egyptian and
[52:01] running for his life amen but but but
[52:03] through 40 Years of the Wilderness now
[52:04] it doesn't have to take 40 years to get
[52:07] the jacket off right it can just take a
[52:09] moment but God had to get him ready by
[52:12] high tempered wife in a backside of the
[52:14] desert and trouble and things and God
[52:15] allowed those things to happen to get
[52:18] this jacket off of Moses and finally he
[52:19] came to a place where he came to the
[52:21] burning bush and God began to speak to
[52:24] him that's right and he realized the
[52:25] jacket he was we wearing of self-ability
[52:28] he really saw it for what it was cuz
[52:32] before he thought yep I'm trained I know
[52:34] I know how to fight I can train men I
[52:35] can lead men I can do all these things I
[52:37] can you know I've got a personer I can
[52:39] project my voice I can speak I've got
[52:41] Authority that was him in Egypt killed
[52:43] one man 40 years later down in the
[52:46] wilderness he came to a place said what
[52:48] what a waste of time what a useless
[52:51] waste of space he thought he was but God
[52:54] had to get him there see from to realize
[52:56] his ability actually was useless and and
[52:59] but but he still tried to hide behind
[53:01] his ability I can't speak no one will
[53:03] hear me no one will believe me how do I
[53:05] know all these things you know so he was
[53:07] but God basically said take off your
[53:09] jacket of your self ability take it off
[53:12] and put on my anointed robe put on my
[53:15] anointed robe Moses put on who you're
[53:17] really meant to be I need you to take

[53:32] I've said it many times before but he
[53:33] was but now he was in position to
[53:35] fulfill his scripture I mean cuz it
[53:38] wasn't him that brought the plagues it
[53:39] was God in him that brought the plagues
[53:41] I mean it wasn't him that opened the Red
[53:43] Sea it was God in him that opened the

[54:16] of that prophecy they didn't even
[54:17] realize it Joshua and Caleb were slaves
[54:21] too but they but because of Revelation
[54:24] they begin to realize Moses has his part
[54:26] of the scripture I have my part of the
[54:28] scripture amen so just as Moses has his
[54:31] part I have my part the other children
[54:34] of Israel didn't realize they were
[54:36] fulfilling their scripture they begin to
[54:38] complain they begin to look at the sand
[54:40] and the situation and the trouble
[54:42] because they did not have a revelation
[54:44] I'm fulfilling scripture maybe they
[54:46] could say yes God sent a prophet he did
[54:50] but they didn't see their part of that
[54:52] scripture they did not see their part in
[54:54] that part see when you can see your part
[54:56] in the scripture like you can see oh

[58:25] oath by by the Covenant that he give you
[58:27] that he would confirm it just walk with
[58:29] God then you'll have your ups and downs

[58:51] Footprints won't be very much just walk
[58:55] with God
[58:56] I trust you're walking with God more
[58:58] than you're walking with the
[58:59] church am mean because if the church
[59:01] fails you still walk with
[59:03] God Amen I trust it's your your
[59:05] relationship is not based on this church
[59:07] it's based on the word he and you
[59:10] together you two in the boat amen
[59:13] walking
[59:14] together amen Jesus knew for this cause
[59:17] to be the Lamb of God he'd come into the
[59:19] world he knew it amen he'd say to pilate
[59:22] for this cause I was born Amen to this
[59:25] end was born and for this cause have I
[59:27] come into the world he knew his purpose
[59:29] he knew the scriptures he had to fulfill
[59:32] and he had perfect Faith because he
[59:34] understood his
[59:35] position I'm just jumping through a few
[59:37] things but I just want you I'm not so
[59:39] yeah I just want to throw these things
[59:41] out there okay brother Braham said the
[59:43] reason Jesus had perfect Faith now I'll
[59:45] just read this now remember they had the
[59:47] word the word was flesh then and the
[59:49] word told them I'll give you power amen
[59:50] I give you power and they had power but
[59:52] they didn't have the faith to operate
[59:54] the word that was in them see what I
[59:55] mean but Jesus had it he was the word
[59:58] and he had the faith that he that what
[1:00:01] he said would happen he said oh bring
[1:00:02] him here how long will I suffer you
[1:00:04] speaking of the boy that you know that
[1:00:05] had the epileptic spirit that the
[1:00:07] disciples couldn't cast out he had Faith
[1:00:09] with his power how did he he said I can
[1:00:11] do nothing in myself this is how he did
[1:00:14] it it's not because he said he
[1:00:16] remembered everything no I have no power
[1:00:18] I can do nothing in myself but he says
[1:00:20] but the father shows me right why he
[1:00:21] relied upon what he was he relied in
[1:00:24] knowing what he was in the was the word
[1:00:26] and he had faith in God who made him the
[1:00:29] word he was God the word and they was in
[1:00:32] him and that gave him Faith because he
[1:00:35] understood his position he knowed what
[1:00:37] he was because the scripture had said he
[1:00:40] was
[1:00:41] this right what does the message see see
[1:00:45] this message is an identification
[1:00:47] message it's a placing message just like
[1:00:49] when just like when Israel came out of
[1:00:51] Egypt and they were coming up to the
[1:00:53] promised land God told through Moses and
[1:00:55] Joshua ab's portion is here you leave it
[1:00:57] there Ammon is here leave them you know
[1:01:00] all these different nations that's their
[1:01:02] allotment that's their inheritance don't
[1:01:04] fuss with them just just keep walking
[1:01:05] past them right your inheritance is in
[1:01:07] the promised land then the borders are
[1:01:09] all defined you know all where the
[1:01:11] tribes would go that was all defined by
[1:01:12] Joshua and Moses so so you know um
[1:01:16] Esau's uh uh descendants they had their
[1:01:19] position Moab or whatever your Lots you
[1:01:21] all those things you know and brother
[1:01:23] said they like borderline you know the
[1:01:24] worldly Church they've got their place
[1:01:27] but that's not your place right so
[1:01:29] everyone's position in this day has been
[1:01:31] identified like Moses and Joshua
[1:01:33] identified them so God God came came in
[1:01:37] this day spoke through brother R said
[1:01:38] this is the bride's portion the fullish
[1:01:41] Virgin portion is not the same as the
[1:01:43] bride's portion the church's portion is
[1:01:45] not the same as the bride's portion this
[1:01:47] is the world's portion and the devil's
[1:01:49] got the Lake of Fire I just wanted to
[1:01:51] say that cuz I like saying it that's his
[1:01:53] inheritance that's not my inheritance I
[1:01:55] me my inheritance as streets of gold
[1:01:57] amen so so he so he allocated God
[1:02:00] through him said this is your lot this
[1:02:02] is your lot this is your lot don't fuss
[1:02:04] with them just keep walking with me amen
[1:02:07] right so this message now identifies
[1:02:09] identifies our position and it
[1:02:11] identifies who we are in the
[1:02:14] scripture right so you've got to realize
[1:02:17] brother I'm said that the bridegroom
[1:02:18] call will come right through this
[1:02:19] message right it's a call to a union
[1:02:22] right to become one with Christ so now
[1:02:25] this message has gripped your life right
[1:02:27] the voice behind the voice has gripped
[1:02:29] your life and he has changed you from a
[1:02:32] child of Darkness to the Child of the
[1:02:33] Light he's transformed you he's changed
[1:02:35] you you see his word being fulfilled in
[1:02:37] your life and all you want to do is live
[1:02:39] according to his word because you love
[1:02:41] him what's happened God is showing you
[1:02:44] your
[1:02:45] position am mean because if there's
[1:02:47] something in you says Lord I Want To
[1:02:49] Live according to your word what is that
[1:02:51] your the real you is in harmony with the
[1:02:53] word it's not in harmony with the church
[1:02:55] it's not in harmony with a bible school
[1:02:57] it's not in harmony with a nice idea
[1:02:59] it's in harmony with the word himself
[1:03:01] just like a husband and a wife are What
[1:03:04] In Harmony as one amen so the Lord is
[1:03:07] showing you your position he's showing
[1:03:10] you what the scripture says you
[1:03:12] are can can we not have perfect Faith
[1:03:15] then can we not have perfect faith that
[1:03:18] God has shown us who we are you know
[1:03:22] than I love it service after service
[1:03:25] message after
[1:03:26] message amen if I hear Brother BR preach
[1:03:28] on the mark of the beast I say that's
[1:03:30] not I know that's not my
[1:03:32] inheritance when I hear something about
[1:03:34] the tribulation well I'm not going there
[1:03:36] that's not my allotment God's called me
[1:03:38] to a Rapture amen if he you know he
[1:03:40] speaks of the bride of Christ something
[1:03:42] in me says that's
[1:03:44] me well did you make yourself something
[1:03:46] no he called me this is my inheritance
[1:03:48] I'm just going to enjoy it if you ain't
[1:03:51] going to enjoy it with me well you
[1:03:52] should you know we should be happy about
[1:03:55] this but
[1:03:56] this should give us as Jesus could
[1:03:57] identify himself in the word then that
[1:04:00] then then then we should be able to by
[1:04:02] the same anointing identify our own self
[1:04:05] in the word that's why I say never let
[1:04:08] the devil tell you who you are he's
[1:04:11] lying to you he'll always tell you
[1:04:14] you're defeated you're depressed you'll
[1:04:15] never make it you don't have enough
[1:04:17] faith you'll never obtain any promises
[1:04:19] it's never going to be for you he always
[1:04:21] does he not maybe he just says those
[1:04:23] things to me how do you you know no he
[1:04:25] tells us those things he's trying to say
[1:04:27] this is your inheritance but then God
[1:04:29] comes along in his word says no don't
[1:04:31] listen to that voice listen to my voice
[1:04:34] amen I want to tell you who you are that
[1:04:36] you can walk in perfect Faith amen that
[1:04:39] you can fulfill your scriptures
[1:04:42] now the Apostle Paul was on a journey to
[1:04:46] Rome he had received a scripture that he
[1:04:49] would testify in Rome also right the
[1:04:51] Lord came to him and said you're going
[1:04:53] to testify in Rome okay he knew he was
[1:04:56] there to fulfill that scripture right so
[1:04:59] because it was a revelation to him he
[1:05:01] knew nothing could stop him testifying
[1:05:04] in Rome that's right right and we know
[1:05:06] the journey for him wasn't easy to Rome
[1:05:09] he was Shipwrecked he was first in a
[1:05:11] storm for 14 days but he was praying and
[1:05:14] he said you know he came out on the deck
[1:05:16] he said he said Brethren let's have
[1:05:17] something to eat you know be of good
[1:05:19] cheer the angel of the Lord who I am who
[1:05:22] I am and who I serve stood with me this
[1:05:24] night said don't worry Paul
[1:05:26] no one's going to lose their lives only
[1:05:28] the ship is going to be lost why because
[1:05:30] God had given him the scripture you're
[1:05:32] going to Rome so when trouble strikes
[1:05:35] your life you got to say Lord you've
[1:05:38] given me a scripture I'm going in a body
[1:05:40] change Hallelujah you've given me a
[1:05:42] scripture that I'm possessing all things
[1:05:43] that every promise is mine amen and let
[1:05:46] your life be governed by that and not by
[1:05:49] what your five senses tell you I mean
[1:05:51] whatever trouble struck because he was
[1:05:53] in a real storm okay there was no Coast
[1:05:56] Guard there was no way to call an SOS
[1:05:58] and someone come get them they're in a
[1:06:00] real storm okay it was really quite bad
[1:06:03] okay but God said you're going to Rome
[1:06:05] so what did he he went to a source of
[1:06:07] strength to say Lord you you you've
[1:06:09] revealed to me this scripture is mine
[1:06:12] but this trouble's come in Lord he
[1:06:13] didn't look at the trouble he looked at
[1:06:15] his source of strength and this I'm
[1:06:17] going to come into now you got to
[1:06:18] analyze your
[1:06:19] lamb because this is what the Apostle
[1:06:21] Paul did he didn't analyze the storm he
[1:06:24] didn't analyze the trouble he just he he
[1:06:27] analyzed his lamb so he wasn't a weather
[1:06:30] expert on the boat trying to say this is
[1:06:32] how many knots this is this is this oh
[1:06:34] here comes this gust and here comes this
[1:06:36] Sall and here comes this and how big are
[1:06:38] the waves and you know he didn't he
[1:06:39] didn't analyze that or the size of the
[1:06:41] boat and how well it could handle the
[1:06:42] storm he didn't analyze those things he
[1:06:44] analyzed the one that gave him the
[1:06:47] promis amen he gave him the one that
[1:06:49] said you're going to be a witness in
[1:06:50] Rome and he judged him
[1:06:52] faithful isn't our God Faithful amen
[1:06:55] he's faith and true amen so he judged
[1:06:57] him faithful so everything else actually
[1:06:59] went wasn't even background noise
[1:07:02] because God said you're going to Rome
[1:07:04] and then finally he makes it on the um
[1:07:07] on the island he's picking up uh
[1:07:09] firewood and he goes to you picks up
[1:07:11] some firew that this deadly snake bites
[1:07:13] him you know and and what does he do he
[1:07:15] just shakes it off in the fire because
[1:07:18] remember he knows he's here to fulfill
[1:07:20] scripture I mean he may be bitten by
[1:07:22] something but that thing's not going to
[1:07:23] paralyze him that thing's not going to
[1:07:25] kill him why because the Revelation in
[1:07:27] his heart is greater than the snake bite
[1:07:30] and we can be bitten by many things
[1:07:33] right there be malice Strife Double
[1:07:34] mindness Trouble depression Strife you
[1:07:37] uneasiness maybe maybe economic problems
[1:07:39] whatever those things can bite you
[1:07:42] unexpectedly right but you just got to
[1:07:44] shake it off in the fire of God's word I
[1:07:46] said no no this thing ain't going to
[1:07:47] kill
[1:07:48] me I'm I'm going to go to
[1:07:51] Rome I put it in Paul's word no I've got
[1:07:53] a scripture to fulfill God has revealed
[1:07:55] to me amen I think we can do that can't
[1:07:58] you I mean there came a point in your
[1:08:00] Christian walk where you decided
[1:08:02] nothing's going to stop youj I trust
[1:08:04] you've come to that moment right Caleb
[1:08:06] and Joshua were in that same same thing
[1:08:09] the desert didn't stop them the deser
[1:08:11] did did not cause them to be an
[1:08:14] unbeliever amen amen because they they
[1:08:17] knew they part of the prophecy of Moses
[1:08:18] we're going into the promised land right
[1:08:20] so you got to come to that place in your
[1:08:21] Christian walk no matter what comes
[1:08:23] against you I I ain't quitting
[1:08:26] I'm not leaving this walk I'm following
[1:08:28] Jesus all the way amen and so the
[1:08:32] Apostle Paul had this had the same kind
[1:08:34] of fire burning in his heart why because
[1:08:37] he judged he judged he judged his lamb
[1:08:41] pure faithful right Honest true able
[1:08:46] strong amen more than able to do it more
[1:08:48] than able to lead him he judg he
[1:08:50] analyzed his lamb when was the last time
[1:08:53] you ever analyzed have you have you ever
[1:08:55] analyzed your lamb we have a perfect
[1:08:57] lamb Hallelujah perfect pilot would
[1:09:00] stand there after just a few moments of
[1:09:02] conversation say I find no fault in this
[1:09:04] man just a few moments of conversation
[1:09:06] with the word he said I find no fault in
[1:09:08] this man Jesus didn't do a whole lot
[1:09:10] didn't do any miracles to him didn't say
[1:09:12] a lot he says I find no fault in this
[1:09:14] man how long have we been examining the
[1:09:18] lamb right how long have you been
[1:09:20] examining the word but yet not come to a
[1:09:23] place where you say this is a I find no
[1:09:25] fault in this
[1:09:26] word it said what he promised he do he
[1:09:29] can
[1:09:30] do right see that's the problem is many
[1:09:33] times people are between two opinions
[1:09:35] because they think the other opinion is
[1:09:36] a good idea just like you get two job
[1:09:39] offers if one if both are basically the
[1:09:42] same it can be a struggle which one will
[1:09:44] you take you see Merit in both if one's
[1:09:47] amazing one's terrible well you know
[1:09:49] which one you're going to take right but
[1:09:51] the devil wants us to think that his
[1:09:53] offer has something good in it yeah
[1:09:56] that's right he wants us to think that
[1:09:57] this world of being popular and getting
[1:09:59] all the girls or whatever you know all
[1:10:01] this being cool and all this stuff it
[1:10:03] has it has something good but there's
[1:10:06] but there's this hook he wants to grab
[1:10:07] you with it right but the problem is
[1:10:09] people actually be raised in church and
[1:10:11] they don't give their lives to La
[1:10:12] completely because they're thinking the
[1:10:13] devil's offer has some point to it but
[1:10:16] if you realize he's only here to kill
[1:10:17] ruin and destroy you you'd say no no I
[1:10:20] want no part of that
[1:10:25] amen you say well I've never had an
[1:10:27] angel come I've never had an angel come
[1:10:30] and speak to me like the Apostle Paul
[1:10:31] say how can I have how can I have such a
[1:10:34] such a faith like he did well Jesus
[1:10:36] would say to
[1:10:38] Thomas Thomas wanted some evidence God
[1:10:40] gave it to him but but Jesus would say
[1:10:44] blessed are they that have not seen yet
[1:10:46] have believed amen you're
[1:10:50] blessed people want evidence well you
[1:10:53] but if if you're a believer that just
[1:10:55] believes it without anything you're
[1:10:58] blessed I need
[1:11:01] proof should we have another testimony
[1:11:03] meeting you want proof how much proof do
[1:11:05] you need our God lives right but but the
[1:11:09] Lord said that you know blessed are they
[1:11:11] that that have not seen yet have
[1:11:12] believed because an angel has come and
[1:11:14] spoken to you in this
[1:11:17] day amen but you see the thing is when
[1:11:20] we speak about fulfilling our scripture
[1:11:21] in reality it's everyday Christian Life
[1:11:24] everyday everyone loves to Rejoice about

[1:14:07] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[1:14:09] his heart but Shall Believe all those

[1:14:31] don't have to be like this no this is
[1:14:32] basic Christian Living this is this is
[1:14:35] everyday Christian Life forgive
[1:14:37] Hallelujah when you stand praying don't
[1:14:39] have order in your heart I don't have to
[1:14:41] forgive that person I think you
[1:14:43] do Hallelujah I think you do oh no I can
[1:14:46] hold this Grudge I can block this person
[1:14:48] and ban them from my life and CU they
[1:14:49] did this to me are you
[1:14:52] sure oh no it's only the pastor has to
[1:14:54] do do that really are we not all
[1:14:57] Christians
[1:14:58] here I'm glad some of us are Christians
[1:15:00] here
[1:15:02] hallelujah join everyone it's good meet
[1:15:05] the Lord amen but you know we should
[1:15:08] this is all part of scripture we must
[1:15:10] fulfill fulfill your
[1:15:13] scripture
[1:15:15] amen
[1:15:16] hallelujah amen if you have order
[1:15:18] against any that your father also which
[1:15:20] is in heaven May forgive you your
[1:15:22] trespasses I want to be forgiven
[1:15:26] but if you do not forgive neither will
[1:15:27] your father which is in heaven forgive
[1:15:29] your trespasses amen so we have
[1:15:31] scripture to fulfill now if you examine
[1:15:34] if you examine your lamb analyze your
[1:15:36] lamb then there is so much power when
[1:15:39] you see what he's capable of Amen that
[1:15:42] he is able he is able to to Deliver Us
[1:15:45] from all temptation remember there is
[1:15:48] nothing that strikes us that is not
[1:15:49] common to man we are not a unique
[1:15:53] case because people who think they
[1:15:55] unique cases think nothing can help
[1:15:58] them right the things we go through are
[1:16:01] going through have gone through Joe
[1:16:03] blogs on the street goes through the
[1:16:04] same thing right but they don't have a
[1:16:07] lamb to analyze to call upon in their
[1:16:11] time of need
[1:16:12] sadly so we need to analyze that our
[1:16:15] lamb not just is but he's more than able
[1:16:18] amen not just to F not just to fulfill
[1:16:20] the scripture in our life amen but to
[1:16:23] but to deliver us amen that he will make
[1:16:26] a way of Escape we got to look for that
[1:16:28] way of Escape amen see Faith looks for a
[1:16:31] way out Faith looks for God's promises
[1:16:34] to be fulfilled because when you when
[1:16:36] you realize when you analyze your lamb
[1:16:38] and say no God is more than able to come
[1:16:40] into my situation and meet my need amen
[1:16:43] then God can prove his word in your life
[1:16:46] you see when Trouble Comes it gives the
[1:16:48] opportunity for the devil to come in or
[1:16:50] it gives the opportunity for God to step
[1:16:51] in it's your choice who you allow to
[1:16:54] take over your life right remember the
[1:16:56] children of Israel I well I just love
[1:16:58] the example Caleb and Joshua suffered
[1:17:00] the same Wilderness same hunger thirst
[1:17:03] everything else that the others
[1:17:05] did but they allowed God to step in and
[1:17:08] say God is more than able we're taking
[1:17:10] the land right the others just
[1:17:12] complained and let the unbelief the
[1:17:14] spirit of unbelief take over and just
[1:17:15] for them to complain against Moses they
[1:17:18] both saw the same things they both
[1:17:20] experienced the same problems but one
[1:17:22] gave a choice no God delivered us out of
[1:17:25] Egypt he's going to take us all the way
[1:17:27] amen amen the others said yeah sure God
[1:17:29] delivered us but where are we now and
[1:17:32] they allowed that Spirit of unbelief to
[1:17:34] grip their lives and keep them out of
[1:17:36] the promised land amen but you see so so
[1:17:38] everything that comes everything that
[1:17:40] comes to us what is it going to do is it
[1:17:42] going to make you a better person or is
[1:17:44] it going to make you a bitter
[1:17:45] person I think better is the way to
[1:17:49] go myself
[1:17:52] amen so now I'm just is going to come to
[1:17:55] this Jesus would Jesus would be walking
[1:17:57] on the water I'm just going to take a
[1:17:58] different uh I think I have it
[1:18:03] here Jesus wanted to fulfill the
[1:18:06] scripture right he wanted his disciples
[1:18:09] to see him for who he was this is why he
[1:18:11] walked with them for three three and a
[1:18:13] half years that they could analyze their
[1:18:15] lamb and see that he was the master of
[1:18:18] every circumstance amen that that that
[1:18:20] when that same one came and dwelt in
[1:18:22] them they would they would know what
[1:18:24] he's capable of that when they came into
[1:18:26] situations that they did not face when
[1:18:29] they walking with them with God just
[1:18:30] with them they knew that that same God
[1:18:33] in them could Master every circumstance
[1:18:36] right amen but you see the thing is they
[1:18:39] when they analyze their lamb when
[1:18:41] trouble struck first they thought they
[1:18:43] analyzed him wrong thinking he was a
[1:18:45] spirit but then when they when he said
[1:18:49] be not afraid be of good cheer be not
[1:18:51] afraid of Desire I mean in the other
[1:18:53] place we read last Sunday they willingly
[1:18:56] welcome him welcomed him into the boat
[1:18:59] amen so they had a moment see God had to
[1:19:02] fulfill the scripture I'm just going to
[1:19:04] wind this up this is me closing okay
[1:19:06] God's here he wants to he wants you to
[1:19:08] fulfill your scripture but in order to
[1:19:10] do that you've got to analyze your lamb
[1:19:12] to see that he's just faithful he's more
[1:19:15] than able to fulfill it in your life
[1:19:17] right because when you do that then then
[1:19:19] you know whatever situation you come
[1:19:21] into God's more than able to do it right
[1:19:24] and then now because you've analyzed him
[1:19:26] faithful that he can come on the scene
[1:19:27] and you'll never leave the nor forsake
[1:19:29] thee that when he steps into a meeting
[1:19:31] or steps into your time of prayer steps
[1:19:33] into your family altar wherever the
[1:19:35] spirit of God begins to move then you
[1:19:37] realize I have a moment that I can touch
[1:19:40] the master and I can get virtue and
[1:19:42] whatever need I have from him I can I
[1:19:44] can get it amen because remember church
[1:19:48] or our walk with God is is is is full of
[1:19:51] moments how many times brother R would
[1:19:53] ST stand there with the discernment he's
[1:19:54] calling someone out and says they're
[1:19:56] missing it and God and His grace would
[1:19:58] actually allow him to speak their name
[1:20:00] out who's seen that in the message he
[1:20:03] says he says lord they're missing it
[1:20:04] help us Lord and then their name would
[1:20:06] we call that so so they were being
[1:20:08] distracted maybe what's going with going
[1:20:11] on around them with the Pew maybe
[1:20:12] they're thinking about tomorrow maybe
[1:20:13] you know the devil's got them thinking
[1:20:15] about something else but God was saying
[1:20:17] No this is your moment don't be
[1:20:19] distracted so he called them by name and
[1:20:21] I think many times when when you know
[1:20:23] we're sitting in a service and God is
[1:20:25] speaking directly to our lives right and
[1:20:27] he's speaking things that the minister
[1:20:29] doesn't know you know no one else knows
[1:20:31] but God knows he's wanting you to take
[1:20:34] your moment he's wanting you to see this
[1:20:37] is me speaking to you I want you to step
[1:20:39] out of your trouble step out of where
[1:20:41] you're in amen that you can receive what
[1:20:43] you have need of right but if we judge
[1:20:45] our our lamb
[1:20:47] faithful Hallelujah there's no trouble
[1:20:50] too big there's nothing that's
[1:20:52] impossible with him remember he's a good
[1:20:55] shepherd He says I am the Good Shepherd
[1:20:58] I trust that if you as you've walked
[1:21:00] with him you realize that word good does
[1:21:03] actually is the understatement of a
[1:21:05] lifetime amen about how good and
[1:21:07] faithful he
[1:21:08] is amen so let's have the musicians
[1:21:10] please today I'm just sorry I'm a bit

[1:21:19] scripture don't look at everyone else
[1:21:21] what about you what's God given you to
[1:21:24] fulfill that's right and I think it's
[1:21:26] very important we search out the message
[1:21:28] search out the scripture to see what God
[1:21:30] wants us to fulfill and make it
[1:21:33] personal
