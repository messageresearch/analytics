that a man could worship is You Lord Jesus Christ and father the way that we could worship yours according to the expression that you as a person right on this day would express yourself and that Lord

come to the Word of God and no distractions the spirit of distraction be bound in the name of Jesus Christ and the spirit of unbelief be bound in the name of Jesus Christ and every critical spirit be

to you who Lord have your way father we love and you you and Jesus Christ's name Amen hallelujah well god bless you Saints it's a real honor and a privilege to be here and you know it's not often that a spare tire minister gets to preach twice in a row praise the Lord amen well you know we have a series here that it's good because the way I construct these is you can preach them six months apart and it's okay because each sermon is kind of standalone but yet they're part of a series yep sorry if you musicians can go and be seated or you know over there we will we won't it's been too much time on the pleasantries on a Wednesday night we'll just get straight into it amen hallelujah amen so we want to speak on the secret of worship again and we wanted to speak on part three when the steam okay amen let me catch my steamer when the steam of worship translates to action and our high calling that sounds like quite a mouthful but really it's worship and action that's what we need worship and action amen let's read from James chapter one verses 19 to 21 yes Louie yeah well God as good doesn't he who loves the Lord a man who's glad to be in the house of the Lord amen rain hail or shine middle of winter we're here me hallelujah amen oh my hallelujah say Amen when you're found the scripture amen hallelujah wherefore my beloved brethren amen let us let every man be swift to hear that's quick to listen or how we want to speak before listening many time but let every man and children listening be quick to hear slow to speak oh lord help me and slow to wrath for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness there's a super abundance of naughtiness of maliciousness of grudges and anger against other people against things and frustrations and all those things lay apart boasting and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls god blesses where you may be seated you know i was just sitting in my lazy boy at home just before and I was really rejoicing over that you know I had the initial reading was actually all the way down to verse 25 but I started getting so blessed by this thought right here I see it now I'm not gonna keep them standing because I might keep them standing too long you know so we'll just stop it there you know because I'm just so you know that word salvation you know the word receiving with meekness the word and this is what we've been going through the whole time as the word what's in it is it's God's law it's his expression it's as will it's his power this life and there's worked and with meekness we just humble yourself and receive it it's got like and it can it can come to you and it can come into your life it can come into your situation where you are right now because the word salvation there's another word which got me quite excited and that's salvaged you know sometimes we find ourselves in a wreck and that Ricky can come in many forms that Rick can come in a form of a mental wreck you can get so battered and bruised by the enemy and he can he can just get your stood up because of family traits and because of this thing here and something happened there any users that against you to bring you into a wreck and on the outside everything can look fine but inside this turmoil going on and that wreck the word is able to self at you hallelujah I thought men of readers received the word tonight amen the word has power contained in it now now now as the word goes forth you know there can be a reaction to that word because it's an expression of God's burden he has a burden for URI as a burden for me as a burden for the church here here's a burden for the vision he has a burden to see his will and follow to see prophecies fulfilled to see a people ratchet it's a burden of the Lord this is what he wants so what he does is he anoints gifts and not just preaching but every gift in the body is anointed and to express the burden of the Lord to communicate with his people to raise up a standard because inside that word has power to salvage hallelujah and I got so excited it was tickling me I understand what brother Branham is bio just it tickled me all over you know you just felt so happy like something's tickling you on the inside of your heart you know it just feels so good and I'm like man it's so cool the Lord salvaged me and I find myself failing and falling on the ground and we all come into that place we just fall down as fail and he salvages you someone comes to you or he sends somebody sent a ministering spirit II since an angel he sends a person and a speaker word and season and it salvages you because with meekness you don't know look what you did don't say that to me you're not above me yeah we get that something if we get like that we kind of get nothing you know if we get all defensive twice is just with meekness because we're not we don't all have it together we don't all have but none of us have got it all together let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall the Bible says you know we need each other and God you know when we're just sensitive to the spirit he can salvage each one of us from rings from failures from being down in the guns and we were up on the mountaintops you know there's a point proportion for us when we're there to help the ones that are in the valley and when someone's in the valley you know they're getting experience they're becoming more refined they're becoming more like though they're becoming purified but then there's people on the mountaintop better in their place and God they're less so in a place with the law we can speak through them and a word can come and see them through there and help the one that's down in the valley amen the wrath of Manion and this is where you know the anger of men you know can get angry at things things can make us angry let's just be slow to anger you don't use anger just don't let anger prevail in your life if you feel angry deal with it straight away you know if you let anger just sit inside your spirit you let anger stay in there and just it's like a residue and the atmosphere it starts to paint you it's like you know you marinate a steak you know you leave it sitting for long enough that the flavor goes down into the steak it goes deep into the steak and everything tastes like their atmosphere that garlic atmosphere him the garlic of Egypt amen that's what it's like when you let anger or malice or something set in your spirit straight away you are the master of your own free will God's not gonna do it for you you have to decide those things you know you you're the one that has the last say in your life whether you yield whether you let God whether you let the word and graft into your life so that it can salvage ooh from the condition you're in and every single one of us in this room right now needs salvager because we're all in it we're not perfect yeah I mean God sees us perfect yes through the blood man we're already in glory in eternity but right now it's still victories to be won still things to be gained amen and so there's a salvaging process going on and when you let anger come in and it residue and then someone tries to help you you know or the Lord sends somebody or the word comes forth and you take it personally and you get all offended by it that's not going to do nothing for you you're just gonna get metal but the rest of man does not work the righteousness of God it cannot produce the righteousness of God and when you look around and you see things happening or you see something that is not right and you think I'm gonna get and you get mad about it it's not gonna do no good it's not gonna help nobody that's all it's going to do is the worst thing it does is that hinders your own walk hinders your own atmosphere and Satan's won in your life temporarily because he's got you angry about something and then you sit there and stew on and you think about it it consumes your life you can't let that because you have to be all if these wisdom wisdom when that thing comes you have got authority to pick it out and you got Authority and you're a son you have that ability to worship and you have the ability to praise and see the atmosphere push down this is all the devil wants right you can't take away your salvation you can't take away the fact if you're sealed by the Holy Ghost can't do that what he can do is he takes you out of the atmosphere we to render you cold formal and powerless by the most simple things you can imagine using your own human nature against you that's why anger you might get upset about something being angry and frustrated about it will not work the righteousness of God it's not going to change the scenario it's going to do worse you end up becoming part of the problem and a solution to the problem you know in business maybe yeah I'll say in business there's nothing worse than a problems based business or a problems based contractor or someone that all they do is present problems to you what's the point in loving if you all you do is present problems to people when this solutions now I'm not saying that you don't go and confess your faults and all that but when all you do is you're a scourge and a problem two scenarios and you see something in and you just try and add your infestation of malison and ant naughtiness to it it's not gonna let the righteousness of God it's not gonna change anything because when divine love unconditional love its projected sovereign grace comes a situation the word comes false because you're yielded you're in an atmosphere you're not angry hello lujah not angry in a good place you could be going for the horrible time but you're in a good place I pull said we're just past down forsaken beaten but always rejoicing hello yeah you know why you need to be always rejoicing this is Nellas 'dom this is now you know you've realizing who you are staying in that place of of great at good atmosphere where God can use you to heal situations and become a solutions based business Alleluia it's like we you know in business now we do well we've got we our clients like us because we're wearing we've provided them solutions even if it's a stupid problem and it's done we make a solution first didn't we ring with people better you know you know they get stuck in their own ways and they get caught up in their and dogmatic natures and that all they do is ring the same people and they just provide them this is a problem this is your problem you sorted out it's not let's not be problems based people amen this be solutions based and there's only one solution it's him it's Jesus Christ anger frustrations not going to work that type of righteousness not gonna bring everything into line it's useless only thing that's good for it's to get your attention and it might frustrate you some idiosyncrasy might frustrate you I might frustrate you of my absolute crazy style of pretty you know but don't don't like hold that just pray for me pray for whoever that's frustrating you because it might be something wrong it might be something bad but the only don't frustrate pray for them and in their atmosphere you know because you know the Holy Spirit is timid and this was something very crucial the Holy Spirit is timid so what the devil does he knows that he'll keep you in a negative atmosphere he knows you he knows all your traits he knows your family knows your history knows what push your buttons she's gonna keep you he's like if you are a thermometer right a thermometer is reads the atmosphere reads it if you were like that the devil's going to keep you down he's gonna keep you on the ground he's gonna keep you simmering frustrated at everything problems based because you're in the wrong atmosphere you're not made for that you're made to live in perfect love you're made to live in the presence that turn sticks into trees again oh my and the reason that a stick turned back into a tree is because it was a tree the presence of God bringing you back into that place where you're you're useful to the Lord become fruitful amen so that he can use you or you can be salvaged he can use you to salvage through when you're on the mountaintop or if you're in the valley and you're really down and it's so far down and maybe you don't even know it if this meet get rid of the anger frustration the naughtiness all of those things filthiness he can salvage you salvaging and the work because it's the word Amen oh yeah James 1:22 225 it says bit but be you doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass not want to behold our natural face all the time I'll see your natural you want to see the supernatural face the one that God saw oh my I only just saw that in and it's good don't want to keep saying look ignored your you wanna you want to see the real you but if you get down on yourself and you can dimming yourself and you're calling yourself names in your head because you're frustrated keep holding you that because and because I'm talking about worship an action here but I'm building to there you the word goes forth the word comes forth to show you to reveal something to God's expressing himself now it's time to either than graft the power Salvage you to put you into action a man to bring you up because as you act upon the word it starts to change your physicality change your atoms amen change your thinking spiritually and physically it's been touched on it a while back on the Wednesday talked about the brain and all of this the electrics you know the way you think because this thought your brain is like this place where the spiritual merges with the physical do you understand that such a powerful thought when you realize that that spiritual things and thoughts and feelings and emotions become physical right there it's the merging epicenter of spiritual physical I don't even know the word the party of the party going on inside there with the spiritual aspects of your life and the feelings start to have a physical representation and so when you start doing the word you start acting upon the word and you humble yourself and leave the word and graft take down the barriers pick down the pride take down all of the things that would know the word going forth become supple you know it's very easy to become supple we thing I've been like this all my life it's just too hard for me I was raised this way a being this way all my life there's power in this room to speak can you Limit God to change you right now can God not change you right now you know brother branham he was seeing that snake remember the Lord said you combine the snake and everything under him and he said to the Prophet but you need to be more sincere you notice the vision you've run Signet Virginia in the snakes there and he's talking about how you have authority over Lucifer and all the demons under him and you have power men being it last week - and you have power to bind them but he said to brother Branham you need to be more sincere and and it wasn't a big transaction and a lot months of like changing his behaviour it was just right there he said love for mine sincerity help me make me more sincere look and in an any bad number so hip is straight away it wasn't some big groveling experience roman catholic style you know the way that we were try and do it the some victorian leadership it's not the way as catholicism denominationalism this man Age ideas God the God of all Grace and power is here to salvage you from a condition and we're all in a condition right now you know we all and and all in conditions we're in a condition we're in a you know when we get to Eternity we're gonna go man was I like there but I can't believe we were there well I mean what's going to be so much greater than what we can imagine but right now it's normal right you get used to it humans are climate eyes we acclimatized to our atmospheres we acclimatize to the darkness you know when you if you've been in great light and then you walk inside and it's dark you can't see and then all of a sudden if you spend enough time in that dark atmosphere you start to see better they open up and all that that must become lighter that's what happens in this world let's get stuck in it but what we need is a Holy Ghost lifting up and lifting up into atmospheres where you see it for what it is but you cannot in this God and then I think I'm gonna just carry on now what behold verse 24 for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty i like that and continuous therein if you continue in my word then you are my disciples indeed you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free so we're on a journey and it's opening up its unfolding and we're continuing in the word and we're pressing the devil back to continue on the journey because when you start advancing he's getting shaking because he knows that the more you advance the more we come up the more we mature the more land that God leads us through to take when you actually take a stand and stop pushing and shaking he's shaking it is destroying him because he he does not want any more second atoms on the earth he does not want any more because he knows this time is finished and he knows that inside you already as the very ark that will defeat him inside you already is the very power but what he wants to do is keep the head in silence and you keep that in silence by keeping you in a negative state in an atmosphere and unbelief you'll keep you a complex so that you can't believe the word but there's power in this room tonight there's power with you all the time to defeat that enemy and you just hit the push you just have to push never give up ever give up no matter how bad you feel that it hard rotten you feel no matter what you fail just keep pushing the Mack I know you know you pray say lord help me there's someone comes and they've got the engrafting word for you no no they just come in to be loving you know cuz that love was the predicted right and they might have done something to you that you didn't even know that was wrong I'm sorry you might have done something to them and I've hurt them but they come to you laugh I'm not angry they love you they want to help you in God's got a word they don't know maybe they do but generally they just come and talk and and in the word comes and it takes root amen it affects your life and divine love is predictive sovereign grace takes over a man whoso looketh into the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed blessed in the action you know all this worshiping you know we get caught up and we have a wonderful time when we hear the word and it makes such an impression upon us because it's so great know God's taking us above just being a what or a walk saying it nothing happening but there's something brewing on the inside the fire brewing on the inside it's gonna push up amen push back the enemy hello yeah it's happening right now amen a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed because this action happening hearing the word and they acting upon the word they're doing the word they're changing the processes inside you physically represent is a physical change that takes place when your thinking is positive as well and when you're starting to act upon the word when you hear these things you say Lord it's become a reality to me reveal this to me make it real to me help me Jesus amen well and we're honest together I'm going through just like the battles we're all going through the battles you have to push back amen we've got a high calling you believe it or not but the the very distance a the pivot is call it there the pivot of this dispensation God has entrusted it to you like he trusted henna with the pivotal dispensational change of Israel's yes from the time of judges until David would come and allow all the inheritance to come five hinged a lung sixty year old barren woman that needed to have a child so God works but he knows that he put a faith inside no devil nothing he trusted and so if you think that you know realize that you you yes little old you in little old me that fails all the time and has hard times and doesn't even feel like a Christian Sunday's that you think henna was in a you know she was in a pretty bad shape you know it doesn't look like the promised Abraham didn't look not the promise coming for him but just everyday yes push back the enemy is probably tormenting him all the time look at you you're a hundred years old now can't even walk crippled over your wife she's handing you know frustrated God does it is even real was that your imagination is it just your imagination the devil push them back hallelujah push them back and realize the joy that you're made for push them back and realize the freedom the reality oh ma hallelujah that's coming that's here reality oh yeah Philippians 3:14 this is I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus I pressed the high calling me a high calling you know that's your calling it's a calling it's the son and daughter of God family of the creator it's right there it's your calling make your calling and election sure amen let us therefore as many be perfect be thus minded and if anything you'd be otherwise minded God shall reveal this unto you you know where if your mind is somewhere else right now just wait God is going to reveal these things to you if this election there if there's election residing amen revelation is unconquered ball satan cannot touch worship that is a reaction to god's revelation you know that because God reveals himself right through the Bible God would reveal himself and as he revealed himself his name came with that revelation you know he revealed himself to Adam at first before there was any Adam there was God out of him then when there's a family he was Lord God L you know the the God that makes a family were to express himself then as he unfolded himself right down through Abraham's ministry and his time his name kept changing as God revealed himself so God would Express Abraham would see it and he would worship he would lay the sacrifice out and you'd call on the name of Jehovah Sakhi knew then hear call name of Jehovah Shalom and call on the name of Jehovah a lamb and call on the name of Jehovah Jireh the provider based on the revelation of God that is how God works with his people to every age every time Ephrata generation he expresses himself now worship worship make it more than just a rejoicing in church when the presence of them but read the word and just think about tomorrow's work think about how busy you are and when the devil comes and tries to make you feel frustrated but just before you're about to pray push him back pray anyway with all your heart you may feel like it doesn't do anything because the devil's fighting he doesn't want you to really pray doesn't want you to enjoy your relationship yet the fight it's a war this is a war there are times where it's easy there are times when you just rejoice in your shouting and it's amazing and it's easy the presence of God is pouring out everywhere and there are times Spirit of the nation's trying to shake you down keep you down I mean try and pray it's like this pressure kind of keep you from really praying oh you know I just encourage you really pray anyway believe faith is not a feeling faith is a belief pray without the feeling and you'll see what happened just pray without you don't need to feel good don't worry about feelings as much as I'm a man I'm a burm advocate for heartfelt religion I think we should be very hot but there's many times when you're not gonna feel good but you believe and I think Daniel felt very good when he was stuck in Babylon burden with the sins of Israel he prayed and he believed and pushed through the Prince of Persia that demon that was holding all those angels back even you know gay people or whatever the Angels things with hard to get there it's a fight here to call on reinforcements to get to Daniel can you imagine that Babylonian pressure on him without the Holy Ghost but he just right anyway and he believed just believed so I encourage you and when you don't feel like it and you feel like oh my is this even worth praying I don't even feel like I'm in a good atmosphere just pray anyway speaking just Paul on the name of the law be surprised what happened he answers your prayer according to your faith not how good you feel amen hallelujah that's putting your worship into action amen you know you get all steamed up and stimulate it you get so excited on my lazy was so happy I put it to her I'm gonna read a quote in a minute the Pentecostals you know there was guys complaining brother brain I'm about the Pentecostals let's get in the revival days there was just throwing chairs and running up and down and doing all these crazy things to the eyes of the world but they were just so joyous and so stimulated by the presence of God that they could they were blowing the steam off and blowing their whistles rather brannon he says I'll read it in a minute it's got to be put to work all of that joy all of that channel of inspiration all of those things make your calling and election sure go before the Lord not just pure warmers we're not just Sunday Wednesday worshipers but our worship should be every hour every moment when you're at work live the life share with somebody where you find an open door find souls for him some way whether it's prayer whether it's funding something with your resource whether it's being a mercy for somebody that's a need whether it's whatever it may be make your calling an election sure ask the Lord what am I here for what's my purpose in life what have you called me fall on what's what is the gift in my life cuz that part that God gave all of you you have a choice now you can yield it to the devil or you can yield it to God well it's a very this is a no-brainer I think we should yield it to the Lord you're going to get a better result because what the devil does if you ever read any testimonies of anybody and I and I see it all the time in the news and all those things any one that yields their gift to Satan and he actually sees the potential in it he'll anoint it and he'll use it and then he'll destroy it he'll throw them in the rubbish bin just kill them and destroy them and then torment them in Hell he does not care about them and he doesn't care about you doesn't care about me but God has made you he has orchestrated your genealogies he has orchestrated your scenario he's orchestrated into the frustrations he's orchestrated the good things he's orchestrated everything in your life to make you a certain way and he placed the gift in here which is the part of himself that when you get the Holy Ghost it quickens it and it seems lightning down into it revelation and it comes alive and that's what you're made for when it comes to use it bet gift I'm not meaning just preachers or one or talking about all the gifts in the body when that gift was a neck place with the Lord humbled yielded to the Spirit of God will stay in perfect harmony with the other gifts in the body will stay in perfect harmony with the pillar fire with the unfolding of the Word of God with the revelation of Jesus Christ was the program the campaign with the sheet music of the symphony coming to Rome coming to melody come into harmony coming to the the very spirit of the composer and move with the times signature as it unfolds in the beat speed and then the violins go and all of it goes coming together it's by those Gibson's that's worship an action that's taking this theme you rejoice remember rejoice push push beyond the boundaries of how you feel don't rejoice just because you feel good rejoice even when you don't feel good do you realize that we get some acclimatized that I'm only going to praise God if I feel head Hey what sort of praise is that do you want him to force you to praise him by his presence by coming down making you feel emotionally happy instead all that he gets or does he get your worship regardless of how you feel that winners worthless well if you got a met hallelujah oh Jesus hallelujah I'm sorry joy sing at your word oh because every divine expression has an appropriate reaction that's like a water a log but be be thankful be so eternally this is the divine expression of God if we could only see it do not rely on your feelings to praise them do not rely on your feelings to react but let the word build amen Satan cannot touch worship by revelation you know there's a there's a mandate on the devil he says see thou hurt not the oil in mine your and your stimulation your enjoyment your experience your oil and your wine the devil cannot touch it you cannot take it away from you you cannot take it away from you he can put you in a negative atmosphere he can he can he can try he can try and push you down he cannot steal revelation from you he cannot steal it from you he cannot steal those glorious times in his presence from you he can't steal when God shows you something and reveals something to you he cannot steal it he can never take it away he'll try but he can't because there's a mandate on him these of notice that's been served on earth hurt not the oil and the wine that's worship he cannot take away your worship so when you're willing no no matter how you feel no matter how hard it's been when you just come with your mind say I'm gonna worship kampf no matter what I feel no matter how much I've found it I'm just going to make it right because the power of the blood cleanses my sins and all my mistakes anything I've done no matter what it is when you sorry and you confess it and it's gone right there now you worship hallelujah that's exactly what the blood is for amen to forgive us of our sins all those things that happen lay them aside hallelujah all of those things but mr. Branum is one thing I'd like to ask you he said as this you said now if you did that I would like to say one thing what made you take up with the Pentecostals I said they believe the word he said what have they got I said I I've been around and seeing them kick over the tables and knock over the chairs man that's enough to raise up any hairs on a cold formal religion you know my can you see he says and I said oh sure that's right knock out a window or something like that I said sure see what is it I said Holy Ghost and he said the Holy Ghost I said sure if they won't make the wheel roll right they've got to blow it out the whistle somewhere see that wasn't getting put to use because the messenger to the age hadn't come to take them McDonough mcc's and put the mechanics through it so that they could do it but we sit right now in a and the most precious place the church has ever been ever been but remember the devil knows it and he's doing everything to keep you on that chair he's doing everything to keep you down because he knows that the dynamics of mechanics are already together he knows that these dynamics in your life that can create a world that can ruin every file all as all the devil's plans can break down things can speak and all of us would change in a second amen its power in you to take this whole civilization highlights at all and push delete and then and then speak in a need any condition over this it's like providing that comes out of Shiloh comes out of there and comes up into the center of your heart comes up into your Jerusalem when all the inhibitions are gone devil knows it he knows that the dynamics and the mechanics have come together you have the power in you in the bank got money in the bank spiritual money and you know how to write the check he knows it he knows it he knows it right now that's why he's doing everything he can keep you on the ground he's doing everything he can to push him back so you have to keep fighting hallelujah it's not you that's fighting its Jesus that's fighting in you it's the captain fighting in you but what does it say humble yourself under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time humble yourself stay humble stay yielded keep your eyes on Jesus keep your eyes on him make the gift in your life he will show you he will reveal to you what you're here for just keep asking keep seeking him he will show you it's weight on the Lord amen worship Him enjoy you don't you just sit down sit down at night you get your Bible out and you don't feel very good and you're probably gonna go to sleep anyway you're tired the devil's telling you this you're just going to go to sleep and you and you just feel frustrated because you know that and you know that you've had a busy day and your minds full of all these thoughts and everything and it's all been stressful and you think I'm not going to get much out of this but don't just say Lord I love you I just want time with you I don't feel very good lord help me but Lord even if I read one verse one paragraph on page whatever it may be odd I just want them to mercy and just do that until you get intimacy you might take weeks I don't know it might happen straightaway I don't know you're going through these things for a purpose amen he wants you to enjoy your relationship with him he wants you to have intimacy with him amen don't make it a burden don't make it just a wharf here yes it's the water on the enemy but it's come through you you know that when you're in this presence or things change life changes it's your inner man gets stronger things become you know it's a snowball of glory hallelujah some of preachers to you and you react to it and it become so yes and you say hallelujah Lord and the thought of it becomes surreal to you it's like you know there's lightning coming down Jesus well and after the Lightning comes the Thunder to shake off the enemy that was been troubling you hallelujah amen with this lightning this thunder lightning is revelation it's why when you city you say Lord I don't just want to learn all these things and I don't want to sit here and deflect all of these arrows off me you know I'm not trying to aim anything at anybody I'm just speaking what he becomes the Lord give me and I know what it's like sitting there and you going man you can just afflict it we can buck it or you can shovel it over to somebody else but the best thing to do is say Lord Here I am just let it affect me because I know there's power in their word I'm gonna humble myself I'm gonna just let it all go and I know I've just Lord need you I'm nothing without you Lord and I know your word is coming forth and mercy and love the devil will sit there and say that preacher knows your situation and he's going to preach that against you he's preaching that at you now do you know that because he knows your situation you know his power that were to salvage me from my situation salvaged salvaged me from crippled state hallelujah to become part of the revival so I can walk in leap and praise God like that guy at the outside the temple at the gate beautiful Amen hallelujah it was the word hallelujah the engrafted word it was a believer that came to him and he had the word in his mouth the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth Peter was not letting Satan beat him down make him angry and frustrated and all these things know and he had a lot to be if you looked at it next we had a lot to be frustrated about there's probably so many people as family everyone all making things wrong and doing stuff because he knew that he had to stay in an atmosphere no you know it's I'm preaching this and praying lord help me because it's not you know this is a better we're all in if he can keep us out of glorious atmosphere keep us and make us feel down on ourselves you know feel like doing those things oh my but Peter had the word and the engrafted word went to a man who was crippled who couldn't even walk and and he got salvaged hallelujah he got salvaged from that condition and got raised up and he was walking and leaping and he became a testimony hallelujah people came part of the revival that Peter was representing amen and maybe someone in here's in a crippled state you know crippled me afterwards right here you can come right out right now whatever condition whatever condition you know sorry God he knows when we're really sorry he knows when we're really penitent we can say it out of our mouths but when we're really penitent he can salvage us salvage from the wreckage of Babylon hallelujah let me read this it would do it they've got a lot of steam sure if they won't make it the wheel roll right they're going to blow it out of the whistle somewhere they've got a lot of steam I said and that's the truth if this Pentecostal church would take a lot of its praises mine and put it to work it would do something for the kingdom of God God give you the Holy Ghost you like to shout by it and praised by it but just put that in to get I guess you know you get so excited and you get so carried away and you get so rejoicing rejoicing anointing that our that glory has a purpose it's not just to blow off the steam as nice as that feels but the wheels are gonna roll the gospel trains gonna stop moving there's got to be a purpose for your life there's a purpose and then anointing that that energy there's a purpose for you that's why the Bible says give all diligence give all diligence to make your calling and election sure they're very important amen now believe this for us make our calling an election sure bring up before the Lord ask him wait on him get distracted always think that just bring it before the Lord oh Jesus what am I here for I rejoice at your word but I don't want I don't just want to worship on a Sunday in our last day and have the other experience in my closet or in my room or at work or wherever it may be but what's it for stream you know what Jeremiah said it burns in my bones amen everyone here is a purpose for you amen and the body you know when I cut my thumb I realize how much this little tiny thing here's a lot of use and it's very hard to live without this thing and I think man what does it like to have your arm chopped off oh my goodness it's not nice to have one thumb gone and even impaired you not kind of well but now I can kind of use it there's still and I realized how much I needed it how much that was needed and I think of that finger nail you know the finger now the the top of its gone back and I think oh I hope that comes back to my wife you know but even that has got a purpose you know those nails that stops the finger from you know because the bone stops about I don't know about fifty five millimeters back or something but if you had no nail your fluff your finger would be floppy so the fingernails got purpose so even if we're a fingernail it's divine purpose and it's needed we all need it hallelujah and we're coming to a place wig you know okay I don't want to get too deep on anything but we're coming to a place where it's every gift it's not a limited portion of Christ and neck lift it's the Faunus you know like I said last week or yesterday I'm Sunday when the Holy Ghost came in our age he came of everything oh my doesn't he make you feel good he didn't just come my justification to pull someone out pull the people out of Rome he didn't just come with a holy life a sanctification didn't just come with gifts but he came was an open book that's the baptismal Holy Ghost for us they had a baptism of the Holy Ghost - they had the the leadership of the Holy Ghost in midday but he just only had a portion he just held things back because they weren't really for the full strength what God does things in righteousness and he follows patterns and he follows nature because he created nature it's her story history is his story you understand that just blows my mind history is his story the revelation of her maneet writes himself and his ways and his personality right through all the nature through the stars through all the processes hallelujah that's why they come now that gift in your life mother brother gift hallelujah that offers that calling Millis make music if they merci gift think that helps get that governing gift the administration get that giving gift if you just in the Lightning stump and the thunders shaking everything shakable away from it the devil do everything he can to surround that gift to stop it from being expressed to become a talent hidden in the ground through complexes likes me I'm not accepted all those things I tried unday the Lord used me and then I was criticized and now I'm gonna hide it in the ground cause nobody really did you know you can imagine the devil saying he says it to me all the time he says he'll try you try everything everything what does he want he wants you to be that man that hides the tellin in the ground it's what he wants because he knows that they could be appearing of Jesus Christ coming of the Son of Man will be expressed inside it amen I've said that many times if you've I mean a lot of us actually this is kind of like the original crew here so you know what I've preached before you know it's like the that's why it's so different now not because we're any better we've studied more wood prayed more fasted more no it's the dawning the sun's come up where is it come inside like I said before that yield a gift inside you if it just stays yielded just stays humble and yielded to let the pillar of fire lead it will appear it will open up it will unfold as he does the gift now if it gifts charismatic and and you know as they say a minister is this really powerful preaching and charismatic they can you know if they get a complex about something well they get pride or they get something they can start operating that gifts to take the people and pull them back into history well take the people and pull them further into the future but okay and you we've seen it we've seen people and it's sad and I don't believe that they'll stay there the elect will come into the first fullness of God the elect will come up and stay with the I am NOT the I was with the I will be in someone's imagination some golden path that he created out of the imagination but gift will be a it's like you know a reflection of God's intelligence of the mind of God that's worship and actually because worship big whole basis of worship the only provided place of worship as when God reveals himself presently and you worship takes you and you put a take man it's so amazing but you know brother BAM says how what's the entry was the gate how do we count as Calvary affect me how do I let the cross let the fullness of the body atone for me sis with the interpretation of the word when the word is interpreted when the word is being fulfilled when the word is being revealed when God is preaching to you the current events the front page news what he's doing now to you to you to all of us and you enter in at that gate you cuz he is a person he is here he's manifesting inves it's manifesting in here manifesting in there it's manifesting in the ghost and when that gift is being used when a gift hunter is anointed wind that gift has been abraded he's expressing himself it's a gate it's a gate been seen he sees if you receive him I've seen you receive me and you receive me you're seeing him to sent me it kinda connects you to eternity it connects you to the Father that's the gate that he places his name okay that's the basis of worship and then when you walk through that gate now you enter eternity now you become covered in the blood now you're walking in the light as he is in the light and you have fellowship with him and all the blood of Jesus cleanse you from all your cuz you're now in a state where you've received the person who is expressing himself now that's one thing I'm in an hour now I set my timer for closing I am closing we're at an hour right now well that gate is being expressed opening the name of the Lord and we're coming up into that vision so that we can place our hand upon me everlasting sacrifice and wonders then go out on the street and get sinister come in this it but just put that into gifts and wonders and go out on the street and get sinners to come in and things like that your church will grow and everything will go along all right don't blow it out the whistle put it into action and make the wheel roll the gospel train this is a prophet saying listener make the wheel roll their gospel train hallelujah you know we're in this hour right now it has to go just it has to go beyond just accepting the expression but for you to come under its full effect you need to be caught up and raptured in the fall the rapture is a revelation there is an eternal weight of glory attached to that revelation every revelation not just the rapture but when God does and you're in an atmosphere and you're hearing the word and and God the Lightning comes and it starts a river late you and you get oil and wine and your oil and the wine is going in you're simulating a a man stimulating full stimulation because you're so excited now you're really getting the benefits of what your a beneficiary of that if you just sit there and go you I've learned something and I like that it's okay okay you enjoy it but if you really want the father think you've got to open the aperture open right up open right up don't hold anything back don't worry about the delivery no matter how silly the preaching maybe you just say Lord let your word assault that's inside the word I can't express it you know the Lord's been revealing this thought to me so much and I and I pray so much lord help me how do i express that the thought every expression has God's thoughts and when it's spoken it becomes a word and now us as the word too and we say love all that I am to receive it it the power that's inside the salt that's inside there did the revelation that's inside there they don't think me over myself now you gonna open yourself to something and if you're not getting your entertainment from the word you're going to get it from Satan because you need a worship something and if you're not worshiping God you're gonna worship the devil you're gonna worship some thing some other thing you know you're gonna worship your only to tell me you're gonna wish your own imagination you're gonna worship your car you're gonna worship your job or you're gonna worship your popularity because you made you know people worship humans are made to worship even atheists as much as they would detest you saying they're worshiping something worshipping soccer or worshiping rugby or worshipping some ball I mean hook come on that's fun but let's not back there an idol and put that up there and go home it's everything to me you know how can you compare a ball with the creator of heavens on earth how could that be anywhere near hallelujah but this country so ravaged by the demons of rugby soccer is not so bad here I mean you go to other countries that's just absolutely crazy it crazy about it they have riots and all sorts because so everything but they don't have God that when you can do lit vet shrill vet thought that excitement and I can tell you now testify from my own experience I get more excited about the word and they do about this Paulo yeah hallelujah more excited I've jumped out of my skin I thought I was gonna get raptured and come back again many times many times you know I mean it's not we don't always have that type of experience but what I'm saying is sometimes you don't feel like push for anyway and just give them the praise praise them by faith if you're feeling that season the Bible we should do it it says when your civvie spiritually heavy put on the garment of praise praise by faith what does he do if you believe it he inhibits those braces I said it last week you know you want the you know the mighty angel was the brazen feet with judgment feet you want judgment free to come down in a glorious atmosphere push out the demons and push out the bad attitudes and push out the grudges and push out all of the businesses and roots of bitterness okay we all we will just continue on another time amen finish this brother branham ceaseless yes all right here was voices oh how we need in jeffersonville thousands of lived voices the thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and holiness purity and
