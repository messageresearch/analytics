just all this I brother jimy still young todders man huh young in the faith they've got Zeal so a big thanks tonight for brother B to give me another time to to brag about Jesus Christ I love him so much he's everything to me amen there's there's nothing on this Earth if you keep your eyes on the prize on Jesus Christ that could disappoint you okay and we're going to touch a little bit based on a couple of things tonight and hopefully the Lord will open a c couple of scriptures to us that just when I read it it actually struck me brother moo why did you sing that song if you only knew brother Josh your songs tonight if you only knew what the Lord has in store for us so come with the expectation because I never spoke to one of them and it's all about our Lord Jesus Christ about the blood about the crucifixion about what he's done for you nobody said anything to anyone it's all the Lord's doing and it's mighty in our sight amen let's not get used to the supernatural amen let's turn our Bibles to Psalm 51 man I was so excited I almost jumped out of my skin there when the songs came brother you said I have to sing the song but I don't want to sing the song I might sing it but now have to sing it and you had to sing it amen you had to sing it so what we're going to do is we're first going to just lay a little bit of a foundation here and just why I want to get to where I'm going I'm not like brother Isaac with his fit man sermon that's going to keep you in limbo he he's done a well job cuz I was calling everyone every name in the Bible but the fit man so thank you brother Isaac that was very very good to hear that from you it it did something to me that night I really needed to to hear that fit man sermon it was for me I don't I don't know if anybody took that but that was for me so God bless you and if anybody is brother Ben always ask you to preach bro you deliver the mail God is using you hey and every one of us but he used brother Isaac last week Wednesday amen man it touched me so much so in Psalm 51 we we find out here in Psalm 51 that that David has now he's he's done the deed with BBA he's done wrong and Nathan came and Nathan said to him you were done you done wrong so he wrote The Psalm but in the psalm he said something and it touched me the moment he said it I thought man you know it's just the state that we're in sometimes and and we'll read the psalm and then then you can have your seats he says the chief musician the psalm of David when Nathan the prophet came into him after he gone into BBA he says have mercy upon me oh God according to thy loving kindness according unto the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin so his heart's desire is I don't want to be this way his heart's desire is there's something in David here crying out say Lord stand in the breach for me right now help me and then he says something which is very profound he says for knowledge of my transgression and my sin is ever before me so this is hindering him this is very much hindering him just stay in the service tonight against the um against the only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight so it it wasn't about her husband it wasn't about the rest of Israel it was a very personal thing he said I sinned against God so I didn't do something wrong against my my fellow servant or my fellow brother but Lord I've done something against you so if we could look at that sin if we do sin and we we go to a brother or sister and we offend them you don't offend them it is it's sin before God it is it is more heavier than that I know we all you know offend each other and sometimes we know in the skin and we do silly things but the real guy we respond to and and and and fall under is God so when we do sin we sin before God we don't sin before brothers and sisters that's why love covers a multitude of sin here whatever we do here that's good but we actually sin before God it's it's much more it's much more weighted if I can say it that way brother and sister forgive you and God will forgive you as well but you first have to approach that that deity that God The Sovereign one to say Lord I've sinned before you you can hide many of things from many of people but before God you cannot hide it it's heavy okay he says the against thee only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight that I um that thy must be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgest behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin my mother conceived me behold thou desirest truth and the inward parts and in the hidden part Thou shalt make me to know wisdom amen so leave that verse up that last verse you may have your seats brother and sisters it's not a heavy one but we're going to have to we're going to have to call Sin Sin and and and what he says here he says Thou desirest the truth in the inward parts so there's something in you that once you've done something wrong it starts rubbing it starts working on you because in you God placed something it's not a conscious it's the Holy Spirit if you accepted it amen and even before you accepted it just by being raised by Christian values you know that it's wrong yeah and if you really took it away the only reason you don't know it's wrong or right is when you justify it when you reason when you when you see it in the eyes of the world and not in the eyes of God so when we sin I want to bring it a little bit home tonight it's not before any man it's before God and God is Sovereign and God watches your every move Brother Andy took the words out of my mouth he watches your move now he's not a he's not a hard God he's not a Taskmaster he's not he's righteous and he never turns a blind eye to sin amen okay he doesn't he sees it sees everything okay now here we go so we know that we were born in sin the prophet said shaped in inequity and come into the world speaking lies okay you can take that down sister Talia but we know that that when we were born we were born in a fallen state but we children did it all Happ happen we know we we hear this often but actually how did Sin just slip into the world so I thought I'll give you a Bible Lesson 101 it's started in the Garden of Eden so in the Garden of Eden God had a word w r d word his word amen he says two trees don't eat from them okay don't eat from the tree that's in the midst of the garden the truth from the Tree of knowledge and huh tree of tree of life so he says don't go to this one tree and eat of this tree in the midst of the garden because it's you're going to die the day you eat of it so there was a there was a word that God said a commandment a law something was remember Eden was in a state of perfection so my servant my my sermon title tonight is accepting accepting his Perfection oh Lord help me now so accepting his perfection okay not your Perfection his Perfection so here is the Garden of Eden and and it's all peaceful and Adam is there and Eve is there and a day is like a thousand years and time just goes and they name the animals and they Fellowship one with another it's Perfection no sin no death no hunger no pains no nothing it's just no headaches okay no feeling bad not one morning having to wake up thinking oh why am I waking up I don't want to get out of bed it was Perfection it was it was how it was supposed to be and then God spoke in this state of perfection he just said don't do that don't don't eat from that tree but see then what happened is Iniquity slipped in iniquity is if God says don't do it and you go and do it it's knowingly doing it yeah but see here David says I was shaped in iniquity so so he says I'm coming from a state of iniquity so all your children you aren't perfect though mommy daddy tells you you're my perfect boy and you're my perfect girl it's not the perfect Dem meaning or we love you very much and you know you're all we ever prayed for and more because sometimes you bring the more and we want to kind of just help you along your journey you know and and you get us frustrated to be perfect is to be in Christ okay so I want to keep your kidss in the service so if you don't have to Doodle don't doodle It's not long I'm going to be very quick tonight but try to stay in the service so remember sin came in the in the beginning In The Garden of okay I'm just checking because I want to just build this base so this is where sin came from and iniquity was when God send his word who can spell the word word w r d word correct my English is good so the word now I want you to realize I'm I'm emphasizing on these two words I wanted to put it up but I just didn't have enough time the devil has really done a attack on me this last two days man but praise the Lord I'm here and we're going to break down the kingdom of Hell tonight I need you to understand word is a four-letter word w r d correct amen okay so he send this word forth and he said don't take from the tree and Eve goes and takes from this tree but in the iniquity lust Creeps in as well because now we know it's a sex deed but when they said in Genesis and in chapter 3: 6 he says and she looked at the fruit and she desired it it was pleasant to the eyes I hope you understand what I'm trying to mean sin is Pleasant to the eyes that fruit tastes real nice it's a desire that's within us because of the Fallen state that happened in the Garden of Eden that now was inherited to us so I don't know why I preach this because we're all believers and we're all saved by grace and we're all there but the lord gave me the sermon so somebody needs to hear it so at the beginning that lust because it came through it got attributed to us the rest of civilization mankind inherited this lust okay and then the last one it was say in sin because once they came to God and they stood before God lies came in because because Adam now all of a sudden he's in a fallen State and God God ask him why did you do it and he goes it's the woman thou gave us me so Shifting the blame it's not me but he knowingly took her but it's not me so now he's now busy talking to God he's very honest but lies are starting to because then she turns to go oh but the Satan the the the the serpent begal me but she accepted his lies so now all of a sudden we've got lust and lies and deceit and and desire and all these things coming in where it was a perfect place yeah so they get kicked out of the Garden of Eden and here civilization starts and and man starts Pro recreating on the earth and making more more of babies and all those things and and life becomes on the Earth but see the the the the thing is inside you you don't always understand where you are because why am I always doing that why do I want to be naughty why sometimes when I do pull someone with a trick do I feel good about it you know why when my brother Sayes something something can I get so angry where does that come from it comes from there but remember the original state the world was in was a state of perfection okay so now we know if we go to the book of Jude it's just before Revelation it's only one chapter but I want to go there I want to build this foundation and and get it real cemented in there if you don't know what state you are in how do you know if you need saving huh have you ever thought about it if everything is just cool blaz and we're just cruising along on the happy life of the world and just having a blast how do you know that you're not lost come on how how do you know you need saving if you think you're all right see if you realize what state you're really in before you meet the Lord Jesus Christ you would change your way of approaching a service the word word every tape you listen to it will change because inside of you is already a hunger and a thirst for God you just don't recognize it yet you're just trying to fill this with everything else but there's inside you a a desire to worship all rakby Fans Say Amen see what I mean inside you is a is a is a feeling I want to shout I want to I want to have joy so when your favorite band goes on the stage and they go hey are you doing you go what made that do it oh come on they dress in rby games Ed used to dress like that by the way looking like a blue bull going to a blue Bull game oh so you see that big man unit coming down the street with two horns a helmet and he's blue you're going to be scared but because they they so getting in the spirit of the game okay praise the Lord he is saved because free state and blue balls we need never got along anyways but now we get along fine okay but but I want you to realize before then something inside brother Edan wanted to worship wanted to praise wanted to shout wanted to have joy unspeakable but he just didn't know where to find it yet he was just wondering everywhere wondering if this is the right way and wondering if that's the right way that's the wondering that the the Bible's talking about you know wondering is am I right if I do this and am I right if I say that that's a wondering Spirit okay he doesn't know he's as blind as a bat he's just wandering because see the world is designed a way off my note but I'm going to hit this hard the world is designed to distract you and to keep you wandering yeah that's right not knowing who you really are but wondering who you are okay is Christ real did he really get crucified is Miracles real I haven't seen a miracle in ages you know is my is my son all right is my daughter all right is did I apply the blood didn't I apply the blood should I apply the blood how do you pray when do you pray how do I wondering not knowing it's all a big question so if you're in that state I'm telling you you're still in the state of being lost though you redeemed your mind and your body is still lost I'm going to prove it amen okay because what it means is you're not you haven't and I'm going to come to the end of it now but you haven't come to a full surrender yet Lord Jesus you're still you're still you are still you it's good to be you but don't be you I want you to read between the lines you know we all have a personality we all have a a part to play in this great Plan of Redemption but if you don't know where you are you don't know what part to play and you definitely don't know where you're going okay now the world is spelled who can spell world to me w o r okay so the word is w r d i will help Rebecca here she was she got caught there but the world they've just added one letter L and that letter is lasciviousness now of course being me brother Isaac I had to go gole lasciviousness okay so let me tell you what lasciviousness is just for those ones that was wondering don't worry now it's a unbridled um sensuality okay it's for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary one to another and they cannot do the things that that ye would so it's a unridable lust for things okay uncontrollable something that's in you that that you do it and the moment you do it you go oh that it's something that's just pushing you beyond it's something that's in you that you can't get rid of you can't get rid of it and if we look here in the book of Jude and we go there to Jude 1 because there's only one verse and we start there with verse three it says there behold when I gave all diligence to write unto you the common salvation it was need ful for me to write unto you and exort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith we all know this which was once delivered unto the Saints so there was there was something delivered to the children of God faith everybody has a measure of it okay just keep following for there are certain men that crept in unawares who was before all ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of God into lasciviousness and denying that the Lord um denying denying only the Lord and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ and I will therefore put to your remembrance okay in your remembrance the thought that uh once knew this how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of um Egypt afterward destroyed them that believed not we go on he says and the angels which keep not their first estate okay so the messengers and the angels they kept not their first estate but left their own habitation and that would be like if you think of jeffus and jaffas okay or if you think what was the two sons of um Levi uh half n phas okay they left their first estate they were priests and they forgot who they were and they started sleeping with the the ladies there at the at the at the um Tabernacle and they start started doing ungodly things and Eli was Eli hey and Eli was warned and they said to them hey your sons are busy doing wrong see they they came from a fallen estate they thought they were something they were lifted up so they they fell and that's because of sin and it's all right they fell because of sin but because they left the first estate and there's snipers in this world that want you to fall demon spirits that will attack you and will get you off the word of God and get you into the world through lasciviousness through the lust and the desire of the Flesh and they designed to attack you and that's fine that this is no man's land brother Isaac preached it one day no man's land this is where the big two battles come together no man's land it's a dangerous place to be in and what we don't and what we kind of forget is the enemy wants to get you out of your land that's he wants to possess it yeah okay so so then it says here um even as Sodom and Gomorrah go to verse 7 even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication going after strange flesh and set forth example suffering the vengance of Eternal fire likewise also the filthy dreamers um the flesh despise dominion and speak evil of dignities so there's a there's a bunch of people on this Earth today you can't preach the gospel to you can't share the good news to and if you're a believer you're an outcast and the world is so blasé today that everything goes this is the state and I preached on it last time I don't want to Major on it but this is the state that you live in and that's fine that's where we live in but that's not you amen that's right that's not the real you the world okay added all these things and they keep adding and every year there's a new group come out okay it was LBG and then it was QP plus C hash Dash quadrat whatever it's all these things they just add and every year then it's cat dog Mouse them three eat others they just keep adding because the word is now so away from them and they now in this l so whatever your heart desires whatever you want to be whatever you want to achieve that lasciviousness that lust for it you have it if your neighbor has a great house have a bigger house okay and now I'm going to go to to brother brandom's um but that's the atmosphere we read in and I read this from brother brandom and I thought man isn't this today hey but he says here now remember inside you is something that is Desiring Perfection inside you is something that's looking for a place of worship that's how you were made okay so you choose where you want to worship you choose what you worship but inside you there will always be that desire that true Holy Ghost pure desire to do that okay listen to what I said it's a holy ghost pure desire because you're here I know that God has called you yeah you don't make mistakes you will not be sitting in this service if God cannot reach you and the fact that God will anoint the whole Service Plus songs and all those things for you is a major fact don't miss it it's for you he says here and and this is in um that day on Calvary this is what I want to preach the day on Calvary where the blood was enough of me he say therefore when a man realized that he was separated from his God he became a wonderer they wept they cried they toiled they wandered about through mountains and through the deserts seeking a city whose Boulder and maker is God for he knew that if he ever got back into the presence of God he could talk it over with him so since he left that Garden he knew I just need to get back but he don't know how he doesn't know how he knows that it's important he knows there's a God he can see God in Creation in nature everything around him he just don't know how to get back he says but there was no way back for him he became lost he says he didn't know which way to turn and he just looked out wondering he took out wandering and he found somewhere that he could find a way back to that place but something inside him told him that he come from a place that was perfect he says there is no person in here that is visible audience or this morning on the magnetic tapes will'll go all around the world there is no one here or anywhere but what seeks for Perfection that's how you made shoes need to be like this I like my hair like this that everything needs to be perfect you know sometimes even a floor drobe brother Marion is perfection okay Bachelors I've been there too you the way you express yourself it might not look good to other people but that's how you like your things but inside you there will always be a a wanting a need a desire for something greater okay that the world would love to fill for you he says and then he says you get your bills paid now all the moms and dads will go amen and you think that settled it you know when you get your blls paid that somebody is then sick in your family and you're like really now there's some sick he says and when sickness gets all right then there's some more BS to pay he says and the first thing you know is that your hair is turning gray he says and there is something all the time constantly because of that wave of sin but in your heart because that you seek for it it shows that there is perfection somewhere the Deep cth to the Deep there is something and that's the many reasons today and this I want to read because people think I preach this all the time that a sinner is wondering about a beautiful young girl will cut her locks of hair to be popular and paint a face to make her body look pretty she would put on clothes to show show the form of her being because it's the only thing she can find to finding somewhere to try to find something to come back she says she's doing this out of a desperation out of a seeking something not attention but really seeking something to come back a reaction you know and it's not a reaction from just Bo whistling at her it's actually seeking more but she don't know what she's looking for but then she turns to herself and not to him and because she's seeking not God because she doesn't understand God yet she's starting to look at the outward appearance and she's seeking and she's dressing and she's looking for that love that everybody wants but this is a perverted love that she's looking for it's not a Godly love and so the boys do with the girls they go and charm a girl and give her all these big promises and one day I'll marry you and all those things but they're looking for love but the wrong love the lavious lustful love because this world took love and it broke it into pieces and it made it a Hollywood thing and not a pure act between man and wife and God it is actually a very sacred thing it is more than just a holding of hands and a rubbing of shoulders and a little cheek kiss on the cheek it goes far deeper than that when you connect with your husband or wife and you do it right so warning to young people and we know we've got heaps of young people courting and all those things fantastic keep it clean because if you do it the wrong way you do it Hollywood's way but if you do it the right way it is perfect perfect there's nothing more perfect than that bond between wife and husband huj off my Marks here we go again he says but women try to make herself attracted to and um um and and Men try to make him her attracted to him neighbors will build a house and will fix it in a certain ways because they'll look for something better than what his neighbor has have you ever pitched forked in a sermon oh yeah that's for that one oh that's for that one hold on brother Hold on Sister this is for you amen because if you lust the things of this world if you look after someone else's stuff you're just as guilty as the poor sinner sitting here not knowing where he is even if you think you are saved by grace amen because it's the state you are living in which will reflect out of so what you put in will manifest and if things other things like those stupid house my daughter's going to fight with me sorry faith not stupid okay that's silly things that you look about that will burn in a fire okay earthquake will sink it the bank will take it back another guy will steal your car the the things that don't matter they major on but the real things that does matter they forget okay we carry on because they don't want to go he says but there's something in us that is seeking out something and it shows that we are lost we want to find something if you're lost you're looking for it when L did you look for your keys Brother Andy exactly so he loses his keys so he he wants to drive his car but he knows I need to find my keys he ain't going to start searching for his car cuz he knows he needs the key for the car he's going to search for the keys so now he knows he starts searching and all of a sudden sister bronan walks past and he's in the fridge and he's getting a pizza and she goes what are you looking for oh my keys well you won't find it in there oh yeah I was looking for my keys well that's what happens that's what happens you start searching in all the wrong places except in here it's easy your key is in here not in the fridge not in a rugby game not in a soccer game not in a a worldly event not in ballet not in French poodles or whatever it is in here because the if you if you lose the desire of the world sister Bron was you if you lose the desire of the world then you're looking for the right type of thing all these other things are added but seek you first the kingdom of God and all his righteousness all these other things will come but they don't major because the Bible says it doesn't matter seek first the kingdom of God young people seek first the kingdom of God because you don't feel your belong and you don't feel that it's it's a good place to be in because you're just looking in the wrong place your head is stuck in the fridge instead of looking for the key get out of the fridge lordes get out of the source band so let's go there to um oh I was reading the quote finished he says human beings try through all the ages they wept for it they cried for it they done everything that they know how to do he says but still they couldn't find it wandering about through the world Amen I'm going to leave the last one for and then you'll see how it all ties together so basically you need to know that you're looking for perfect love ladies gentlemen you're looking for perfect love perfect Joy perfect meekness you know perfect humbleness perfect wisdom perfect discernment you're looking for something that is clean pure and holy not some temporal thing but some Eternal thing okay so that's the that's the state your mind should actually be in that's where we all ought to be but young people more than ever the world is designed to try to knock you from these principles that there is a perfect for you there it's not in the world I will preach this till the day I die or Rapture which one comes first that's the Lord's will but I'm telling you now this world has absolutely nothing for you I thought I had it all in the world I thought I found it all I tried every Avenue except drugs praise the Lord I never did that but we've got testimonies here okay I've tried everything I could it could not fill the void that was in here and you say oh you don't know about it I was cool once I walked on eggshell you know I was so cool my wife was scared of me oh boy she didn't even want to know so I dropped her off in the evenings of my notes again but I thought I'll tell you how cool I really was you know I would I would caught her let's do it right we were dating back then but I caught her and then I would tell her some beautiful nice words and in the evening I'll drop her at her house hoping she would kiss me because I wasn't saved yet I didn't know the Lord Jesus and I didn't know how to do it right and the moment I lean over the door will go p and she's gone and I'm like did I say something wrong does she not like me I thought you know I had it but she she was scared of me cuz she knew that inside me I couldn't be trusted but I didn't know that cuz I was cool you know I get to my buddies and they'll go hey bro what's a joke for today and go ah there's a joke and they'll go ha and I'm cool man I'm awesome and you can kick a allall this far and ask it in South Africa's major oh you play first team rby oh you're cool you wear the jacket you show up to the right places I did ballroom dancing yeahuh the chaa the Tango all those things I was kite surfing I was cool the girls thought I was the number one guy to dance for in the school trust me ask them because they were lining up to dance but that's how cool I thought I was but all of that was just a smoke screen for sin because all he did is just pushed me further and further and further away from from God yeah I know I got to a point where I didn't even know what prayer was I got to a point where God wasn't real Samson was just a story in the Bible all these things just got blaz and every church service I couldn't wait to get outside and smoke with the pastor or the Deacon or whoever that was where we were because see what happens with sin sin blinds you it smokes you it gives you a a false ID identity that's right actually it gives you no identity because if you don't even know if you're a boy or a girl you don't know nothing not even biology 101 okay I'm just thought I'd throw it out there I hate that Spirit of you can be whatever you want I hate that's going to burn in the Lake of Fire and we're all going to look at that spirit and say this one really and we're going to look at Satan and we say this guy made the world to tremble because see we got woken up of a world of disillusion we ain't going to be fooled we're going to be Overcomers this message came to overcome not to put us in some rules and regulations about skirt height and hair height and all those things it's not about that it's to shake you and say but wait there's more amen and better things you can be very happy in your right place or you can be very happy in the wrong place but either one of these trees will fall the way it leans be careful because remember what I said in the beginning of the service you sin before not men so when David truly repented of this he knew that when he addressed God he says though he he committed sin and and the kingdom could have him killed for it it's it's it's bad it's a big no no he said God I sin before thee and my sin is be between me and you beautiful place to be if if you could realize that your sin is between God and you now we go on I've majored enough on that let's go to the Book of Ezekiel and we go 37 Ezekiel 37 a little bit of scriptures just focus kids if you can try to stay in it must be in it there's always a tug of war I'm always going to I'm going to keep this in my sermons Mo the devil will grab the rope and he will pull and in between you and him is a lake of fire so you got the choice you can grab it and you can pull back and he can go into that Lake of Fire he can choose but you need to pull you need to fight when he says baby and he doesn't want to sleep he's here I'm just using him because he's here can't like to sleep don't listen to brother man this Wood's not so deep and he's pulling you and you're like what should you do do snap out of it this is for you there's nothing in the sermon that's beyond what you can understand it is simple facts you have sin nature in you needs to be crushed am you can't do it you don't know where to find or how to do it but God has a way for you tonight he's going to show you so when you get to Isaiah and it comes here when in 37 it says the valley of dry bones now brother Andy could take this subject and preach on that for a year the value of dry bones it's not a challenge it is a fact because they can I get an amen for that man just love the Lord cuz Brother Andy could take a subject and he would just go for miles and that is his gift that God gave him and I place I asked the Lord just doubles that gift Brother Andy and you keep preaching it and preaching it it's fine we all love you just how you are but when I read this the first thing I thought about woo if Andy gets this one we having a service okay it's going to be a good one so he says he in the value of dry bones and I want to keep it light now because it it goes to the point where you have no control but you've got all the control kids you have no control over sin no control but you have all the control read between the lines now you have it all he says the land of the Lord the the hand of the Lord was upon me and he carried me out in the spirit in the um and the Lord set me down in the midst of a valley that was full of dry bones so dry bones is have you ever gone through a a season and uh I'll ask some of the veterans here the older people where it's just a dry season Oh Lord You're like man I feel dry you sit in a service and you bone dry and the words coming over the pulpit and it's just not adding any flesh Sen or nothing you're in this state you're in this state where you just think man is this just another service am I just going through another trial has God actually going to ever come to the scene and help me out of it it's a dry place your bones has lost its marrow your your flesh has just fallen off you're actually just you you in the ditch so badly no matter what brother and sister talks to you and say it will be all right you're just dry inside I've been there I've been there recently we just Lord have you just forgotten about me what have I done wrong brother Isaac said it I'm in a desolate place I I want to get back home have you ever been there I've been there it's a hard place it's where you just feel like there is nothing there's nothing and you're just about to give give up Lord comes on the scene that's right and he caused caused me to pass by them round and about and behold there were very many in the open Valley and low but they were very dry they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live Oh Glory who's speaking here he says son of man can these bones live these dry bones that needs something he and again he said to me prophesy upon these bones and say to them oh Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord thus sa the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live and I will lay sinu upon you and will bring flesh upon you and I will cover you with skin and I will put breath within you and ye shall live I will send you the message of the hour I will turn your heart back to the fathers I will show that there's overcoming power I will restore says the Lord that is who speaking here deity God himself is speaking here says I will do this Hallelujah that's right amen I believe it glory to he says so I prophesied as I was commanded and I prophesied and there was a noise like a good fashion oldfashioned Revival a good camp meeting coming up soon doesn't have to be camp meeting you can have your Revival and take the fire there that's right it's between you and God okay amen get your Revival so I prophesized and it was a noise Behold a shaking and the bones came and gathered bone unto his bone and I beheld low the senu of Flesh came up upon them and in the skin covered them above and there was no breath in them say they were at Pentecost there was Life coming back amen but yet there was no life of God in them yet there was no breath in them so they they come to church and they get all happy and they dance in the spirit but yet something's not piercing through that Wan thing something's not piercing through that desire there's still that question there's still that desire there's still that real need for worship they come to church and they say oh praise the Lord hallelujah and their hands cannot go further than their heads Defying Gravity if it goes over your head hey I'm I'm being honest I'm not preaching against anyone I want to tell you something Defying Gravity is when you stand and you push your hands because you're so deep in sin and you go outside of that sin and you go Lord just grab these just grab these on here I am grab them yes because I'm so deep in sin but you can see my hands that's Defying Gravity there's not a shame to lift your hands in church if anybody even laughs at you for lifting a hand at church shame on them God will rebuke them he will not write write them off but he'll rebuke them he'll bring them back because it's the it's the biggest compliment you can give our savior to lift your hands when he went to the cross and he lifted his hands for you it's the biggest compliment you can do nothing should hold back your worship from God come on nothing I'm being happy now but I'm saying cuz it's bubbling in here but you can't go bubbling in here and put a cap on it year oh my come on and then when they dance in the spirit you go like this seriously but a guy runs and it kicks the soccer ball to another guy and he kicks it and he missed the goals and you like this oh did you see that but you come to church and then it's it's like oh did you see that I was standing there at the back I I I prayed Lord just keep me in my place because when they started singing about the cross when they started singing about the blood this is my message tonight is the blood is the cross is the sacrifice on Calvary for you see Lord had to cut the sin in the Garden of Eden I'm leaving my notes now I want to hit this home he he he annihilated that sin amen he put us back into that place of God of Eden again yes you live in an atmosphere of sin you live in a world of sin but you have no sin you are pure clean and holy before God Amen so Ezekiel he goes on and he says then he said then he said unto me prophesy unto the wind oh no yeah yeah prophesied unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus sayith the Lord come upon the Four Winds and breathe upon these slain that they may live so I prophesied and I commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and they stood up on their feet an exceedingly great Army Saints we're exceedingly great Army it's not just shakina it's not just the seven Church age it's every Church age before usj all of them are bride we're just the ones that can see the rapture we just have a a different anointing on us we're in a different space the time we all bride because and I don't want to go too long but I still have lots of time 15 minutes I may be able to do it when he let's go on leave it okay we'll get there he says and I prophesied and and breath come into them and there was exceeding great Army and they said unto me son of man these bones are of the whole house of Israel and they said our bones are dry and our hope is lost and we cut off our parts therefore prophesy prophesy and say unto them thus sayith the Lord behold oh my people I will open their graves and cause them to get out of their graves and bring unto you into the land of Israel and ye shall know that I'm the Lord that have opened up your Graves now the day on Calvary when Jesus Christ laid down his life what happened the graves opened up there were Saints walking in Israel and they saw them and they spoke to them yes God opened the graves the day when he took the cross of Calvary and he died and he blew his out there was a great Darkness the Earth was shaking and he broke open those Graves exactly what Isaiah is talking or Ezekiel is talking about see he's speaking to Israel but we are also Israel we are also Israel and Israel needs to be awakened but God will do it but can you accept God's provided way where is the devil lying to you again oh he loves to lie he says here in verse 14 put that up he says and I shall put my spirit within you and ye shall live and ye shall and I shall place you in your own land and then they shall know that I the Lord have spoken it and have performed it saith the Lord amen so God doing it okay Matthew 27 I'm going to close with this Jesus is in the Garden of Gethsemane you want to know how you can overcome you want to know how you can be a force to be reckoned to that that you can be that that man that could run the extra mile that fit man do you want to know how to go overcome you know want how to fit in with Jesus Christ into to Jesus Christ right give up yeah that's it full surrender give up your thoughts deny them if they're contrary to the word give up to his will Jesus Is Here In The Garden of Gethsemane we all know that Jesus was led by Vision correct he was led by Vision he says I can do nothing unless the father shows me so he knew what was going to happened to him so he goes there into the Garden of Gethsemane and we started there don't have to put it up it says but Jesus prayer Gethsemane goes there in verse 36 he goes then cometh Jesus with them into a place called get and he said unto the disciples sit ye while go and pray and he took with him Peter and the sons of zebede and he became a sorrowful and very heavy then he saith this is our Lord saying this he says my soul is exceedingly sorrowful even unto death T here and watch with me so he sees the whole crucifixion play out before him he knows every stripe that's going to happen he knows they're going to beat him they know they're going to mock him they know his Beard's going to be ripped out they know he's going to suffer like no man he knows that the wrath of God is going to be poured out on him for all sin he knows this and he's sorrowful and he's heavy have you ever felt so heavy that you can't move that when Satan comes and tells you it's never going to work you ain't going to make it it's not for you and that heaviness comes upon you now times that by Infinity then you'll know where are Lord Jesus Christ was because see you don't hold tomorrow but he did and he knew exactly what was going to happen and now he's sitting there and he says I'm going to go pray and he falls down on his face before the Lord falls down yeah and he says Lord if this cup can go from me take it Lord but nevertheless thy will be done so now you sit in the world and the world looks beautiful everything is just pretty outside in the world your next new guitar brother Josh cuz I looked at you or your fancy new car that's coming there brother Jess you know you got all the V6 cylinders and all those things and and you're becoming to start looking at all these different things and where do I fit in and what do I do you know and these things becomes heavy because you don't actually know I'm going to remind you of something if you just give your will to the father and say Lord if I get the FY car blessed be your name if I don't blessed be your name if I fit in with this crowd Lord show me if I fit in if I don't fit in blessed be your name if I do fit in I'm worried because it's contrary to your word four-letter word see to submit your will to the father is to submit yourself to the full word of God not some one Bible verse you you take your whole salvation based on not what a preacher says not what anybody said what the word of God is asking you and if it's anything contrary to this you have the same moment where Jesus had it far more greater and far more heavier than us he understood our weakness and he said father if you don't take this cup it's fine but your will be done see the thing that you forget is when he went to the Cross after he suffered the beating the mocking the stripes for your healing all those things bruised for your iniquities all those things that he suffered you know they they had these nails at work and this is what triggered this sermon and brother Ben I spoke to him about it as well and they took these nails I wanted to put the picture of but I just didn't I didn't have time so they take this nails and these nails are this long okay and it's got like a thick place for a hammer to hit and they go all the way down and they're very sharp and this guy p picks up this nail out of the box and I'm walking past and he says hey do you know what they call these nails to the other guy next to him and no he says they called him Jesus nails and he ripped my heart because I thought Lord these guys have no clue no clue what he's saying but it was the biggest compliment they could give him because those Nails didn't hold him on on the cross no matter how big they were it was me and you our sin that held him there Hallelujah that's why he took the cross for you so that you can come in this age in this time and have that blood and apply it to everything that you've done wrong and say Lord but your grace is sufficient and the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the scribes they looked at him and they said others he saved but himself he couldn't save biggest compliment they could give our lord Jesus because he didn't come to save himself there was Legions of angels He says don't you know that I can call now 12 Legions of angels and they can wipe this whole earth just wipe it end it all now they were ready Gabriel was standing right there looking woodworm was standing there right there looking saw drawn ready to act the king of glory hanging there for me and you ready to act he didn't say one word but father forgive them oh GL they don't know what they doing Hallelujah and then when he laid down his left he said it is done hallelujah but see we wonder why we don't overcome is because we didn't take the it is done part cuz we still wondering but see if you in Christ if you've applied the blood you don't need to wonder the blood is for your sin the blood is to cleanse you but the sacrifice and if you really understood those nails for you you would want to sin knowingly you don't want to be a worker of iniquity so you don't have to stress out that this world is wooing you get into your word read these things because it's life you know I've never heard a sermon where brother brandham and I'm closing with this musicians you can come up I never heard a sermon where brother brandham referred to himself he always pointed us back to the word the full word of God now one thing I want to tell you is when they speared his side and the blood poured out and hit that ground that's where the bride of Christ was birthed that is where me and you got our birthplace from because see when he was hanging on the cross you were with him and in him until that was released it had to happen and I know that you feel when you talk about the crucifixion we all feel it we actually feel that day because why you were in him you were right in him so don't let the world woo you you don't let financial problems get you worried where you sitting at this point of time in this pest house don't let that get to you that's not the perfect VI that's not that's not the Perfection Jesus B bought on the cross so see and I finish with this in the Garden of Gethsemane sin came but Abel made the first sacrifice a lab and by faith he done it and by Revelation from God he's done it he did know what he was doing on that day that when he was taking that lamb you can play anything sister Tiana if you want to but he was taking that lamb and he wouldn't have had the nice new caliber knife and all those things he had a rock sharp Rock and he would butcher that lamb and that blood will come over that lamb everywhere over him over the lamb it was a brutal thing that day and sure his brother Cain would look at him and go this guy has lost the plot cuz because he lifts his hand in church and when we talk about Jesus Christ he says you know that's a Holy Roller and you're always going to be your outb but see Abel had the Revelation and he knew that lamb had to die he did but see if you looked at the very picture you would see the crucifixion right there you would see how that lamb was struggling to keep its life how that lamb got actually hacked and brother brandom speaks about it in the sermon two pieces because he knew that had to pay the price of the wrath of God and Jesus did it for us see we mock him when we go out there and we listen to the world we mock that you have deity in you you are from a different place you are not from this Earth we are coed with Christ don't listen to the voices out there don't tailor you to the world don't do anything of that all you need to do is accept your sacrifice and walk walk with him you can accept it tonight you don't need to be like your friends you're not like your friends and you will never be like your friends because God didn't choose them he chose you and if he did choose them he'll bring them in because he says all that the father has given me will come to me so stop worrying about your friends worry about God first cuz when you put him first then he'll lift you up into a place where you have joy that this world don't understand and they will want that and they will come and ask you why are you so bubbling arant why the more we give you hard things do you smile and wave why do you walk past us and sing songs why isn't it let Zeppelin and Metallica and those songs why is it gospel why is your favorite song a gospel song because it's who I am and you know what you could lead people to Christ by being who you really are amen instead of denying who you really are but that is between you and God Alone no man will judge you on that day but God will amen and if you stand before him and you've done all you could to live for this gospel reach your poor sickness and in heal till death do you part then you know when you stand before him he'll say you worker of good my faithful servant not iniquity of good enter into the Kingdom of Heaven into the joys come fellowship with brother Brandon come fellowship with Paul this is where you came from in the first place we have to realize who you are cuz the devil is trying to tell you what you're not I'm telling you young people the devil is telling you what you're not God tonight is telling you who you are it starts with one simple thing put him first yes amen forget about this L this losing World cuz you add the L then you lose take the word if you ever remember something don't take the world take the word you're not a loser you're Overcomer amen what song is [Music] this sing it brother Josh could lead us into it may you stand we don't have a prayer meeting tonight close your eyes let's talk to the Lord quickly all of us I think we should keep singing that in the background I want all of you just to close your eyes now I say Lord I lift my hand tonight to the almighty King father I defy gravity tonight Lord Jesus I come to you and I say father this world is very attractive very very attractive Lord but father yet tonight I want to ask that we would you would just if we found Grace in your sight Lord Jesus Lord and if this word was your word which you have confirmed father we call upon you my lord and ask Lord that you would just help us father to bring us to that place where we can really take your sacrifice father and become one with my lamb Lord to forget about all these things in the world for just a split second Lord lift that veil of sin off us now Jesus Oh Lord and Shine Your holy light within our life and that seed that's within us show us father that we are yours tonight every son every daughter every husband every wife every young person father Lord we don't need a camp experience to experience you my lord we know that we come from you and we know that we in no man's land and we know this is a great fight father but you have already paid the ultimate sacrifice the great price for my salvation and for my sins if I can only accept it tonight Lord Jesus if you accept the grace of God if you accept God's provided way there is a way there's a highway and there is a way and that way is the Lord Jesus Christ if tonight you can accept him as your savior if you can lift your hand to the Lord and say Lord I'll accept you as my savior would you just guide me would you clear my head my my mind my body my soul would you take all this toxic stuff out of me Father all this desire for sin this lasciviousness this this lust Lord this unholiness this ungodliness father the thing that is standing between me that's vexing you Lord clean me tonight father cuz I come to the cross and I know Lord that you've opened up that grave you gave me my dry bones you gave flesh Lord and send you and you put it together father and Lord I pray that you will breathe your air your breath of life within my soul oh Lord and that you would restore me and put me back in my place tonight father and I Shall Serve you for the rest of my days because Lord I don't want to miss the day of your coming I don't want to miss the day of the Rapture and Lord if I don't understand your scriptures give me the desire for your scripture give me the desire for your word remove the desire of the world father Lord I don't want to be in this state where I'm wandering I don't want to be in the state where I don't know where I'm going or where I know where I belong father I want to belong to you tonight Lord I want to have a close and personal relationship tonight children you can have it in the name of Jesus Christ just give up Just Surrender Your will to the will of the father let him pull you tonight closer to him oh do not miss this moment whatever you do don't miss this moment it's life and death children parents don't worry about your children don't worry about your friends take God at his word take God at his word fully and say Lord Jesus you have given me your promise and you have said that I will bring you and your children and your children's children in the land is yours father we claim it no matter how the storm looks no matter how the world lives we believe you father and Lord tonight we want to come before you and we want to accept your blood in the name of Jesus Christ we want to accept the Lord Jesus Christ perfect sacrifice that covers our sin and our our shame and our iniquity and our lies and our lustfulness Lord we want to plunge into that blood tonight father if we can only do but the father's will and Lord when we come to that Pitchfork that's in the road that big fork Lord to do right or wrong may we go on our knees right there and say father your will be done I will choose the way of God not the way of man the way of God
