[27:08] 23 and 24. while you getting there. Um,

[27:14] now? If you only knew the songs that you
[27:17] picked and how you open with Psalms
[27:20] 150, just stay with me tonight.
[27:24] This is this is excellent how the Lord
[27:26] orchestrates things is it's incredible.
[27:29] And I thought I'm going to give this up
[27:31] because uh brother Ben asked me a while
[27:32] ago uh for the message and I gave him my
[27:35] theme and I go maybe the Lord's going to
[27:37] change it on me now that I said it. But
[27:40] um thank you Lord for for sticking and
[27:42] and uh letting me prepare for this. If
[27:45] you're all uh in your Bibles uh John
[27:48] 4:23, say amen if you're there. Amen.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; But the hour cometh, and now is, when
[27:55] the true worshippers shall worship the
[27:57] Father in spirit and in truth. For the
[28:00] Father seeketh such to worship him. God
[28:04] is a spirit, and they that worship him
[28:07] must worship him in spirit and in truth.
[28:11] And then I think I just accidentally put
[28:14] verse 25 there. The woman say unto him,
[28:17] I know that Messiah come of which is
[28:19] called Christ. and she asked her when
[28:21] and and he just says you are speaking to
[28:23] him.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; This is him.
[28:26] You may take your seats tonight. Um may
[28:30] the Lord bless the reading of his word
[28:32] and encourage you all. My theme tonight
[28:34] is worship. Um it is a very simple thing
[28:39] to preach on or to minister on. Um but
[28:43] it is so profound and it can go very
[28:46] deep very quickly. So, um, if you would
[28:50] bear with me, I'll have I've got a few
[28:52] slides, kitties. I've got a few
[28:54] pictures. There we go. We started with a
[28:56] picture. Um, but I I just felt I wanted
[28:59] to to lay a bit of a foundation of of
[29:02] where does worship fit into our lives as
[29:05] believers? Um, where does music fit in?
[29:08] I've had these two main themes, and
[29:10] we'll jump uh between them a little bit.
[29:13] So, I just wanted to color in the
[29:15] picture of of what is worship? what is
[29:17] worship for us. So the first thing you
[29:20] would know me being um having English as
[29:23] a second language uh I need to go and
[29:26] find the definition of worship and
[29:29] worship is a reverent honor and homage
[29:32] paid to God or sacri personage or to any
[29:36] object regarded as sacred. So there's
[29:39] the first question is like okay so who
[29:42] are we worshiping?
[29:44] &gt;&gt; What are we worshiping?
[29:46] adoring reverence or regard excessive
[29:49] worship of business success. I've seen
[29:50] that in some of my family's life where
[29:53] ambition takes over. They make their
[29:55] first million and they start to go, "Oh,
[29:58] it took me two years to get to this
[30:00] million. Maybe another two years and I
[30:02] can have two million. Maybe another four
[30:04] years and I can five million." And that
[30:06] takes over their lives and that am
[30:08] ambition becomes a worship. And
[30:10] typically, there we go, the synonym is
[30:13] idolatry, adoration, homage, and honor.
[30:16] An object of adoring, reverence, or
[30:19] regard. And then from the Strongs or
[30:21] from the um from the Greek um worship in
[30:25] um in the Bible is pro proc
[30:31] to crouch. And now it's talking about
[30:34] and please bear with me here. It's it's
[30:36] it's it's falling face down or prostrate
[30:39] in adoration. A physical act of lowering
[30:42] oneself in a humble submission with an
[30:45] attitude of utmost adoration or respect.
[30:50] So please keep that in mind because the
[30:54] natural meets the spiritual. If we're
[30:57] talking about and and if that is what
[30:59] the word is saying, what are we doing
[31:01] then spiritually? If this is a a
[31:04] physical act um this was very very nice
[31:08] just the continuation of it has been
[31:10] metaphorically described as the kissing
[31:12] ground between believers the bride you
[31:15] me and Christ the heavenly bridegroom
[31:19] um while it's true so it suggest the
[31:22] willingness to make all necessary
[31:25] physical gestures of obesence obeisance
[31:29] again I had to go and look up what is
[31:30] this obeisance Then all these new words,
[31:33] brother N. What's happening here? But
[31:36] I've got you. I've got you. It's a
[31:38] movement of the body made in token
[31:41] respect and submission. Bow.
[31:44] After his there's a example after making
[31:46] his obeasance, he approached the altar.
[31:50] So there's that form of respect again.
[31:53] Um,
[31:56] so
[31:57] with this in mind,
[32:02] where have I seen worship and where have
[32:04] you seen worship?
[32:08] Uh, the easiest thing to reflect back to
[32:10] is our recent camp. So, who've had it
[32:13] who's had a tremendous time at camp?
[32:15] &gt;&gt; I mean, um, as my theme was for the camp
[32:18] and my prayer was, Lord, make it
[32:20] profound. Make it something that's
[32:22] everlasting. And um by these examples
[32:25] I'm going to give you, I saw worship in
[32:29] the 99 sheep and I saw it in the one
[32:32] lost sheep. I saw it everywhere and that
[32:34] was that was just really beautiful. It
[32:36] came together so nicely and sometimes
[32:39] it's a privilege to be a deacon. We can
[32:41] see a lot of things and um from the back
[32:44] and and this is now all positive.
[32:47] So my first example was a brother that
[32:50] called was was called to the front and
[32:53] was asked forgiveness on behalf of those
[32:55] that hurt not knowing what is happening
[32:58] in the heavenly in in the heavenly
[33:00] realm. So
[33:03] there was so much movement and and that
[33:06] that moment was so so profound when
[33:09] brother John just called him up and how
[33:12] that came together and he he didn't
[33:14] know. I he probably still doesn't know
[33:17] but it was profound that it happened at
[33:19] our camp and that it happened in in such
[33:21] a way. Um the Lord's been pressing on my
[33:25] heart to to do to to to act on the same
[33:28] thing. Um where people are let's say
[33:32] cultures of past of historical like us
[33:36] coming from South Africa where where my
[33:39] forefathers hurt and I want to step in
[33:41] that gap and say but I want to ask for
[33:43] forgiveness on their behalf. They didn't
[33:45] know what they were doing. I you know so
[33:48] it will come. it will come and the Lord
[33:50] will place it on my heart. Another
[33:53] example was a new brother in Christ. It
[33:55] was so lovely to see this transformation
[33:58] within a couple of days. He was starting
[34:00] with his walk with the Lord and how the
[34:02] Lord just opened up his storehouse of
[34:04] this agape love. All of a sudden, he
[34:06] receives this, you know, healing and
[34:08] restoration of his soul and he's seeing
[34:10] it and and he wants to show it now by a
[34:13] embrace, by a hug, you know. He couldn't
[34:16] wait to to embrace us and to say, "I
[34:18] love you." you, you know, it was just
[34:20] overflowing and and and and there's no
[34:23] way he could have put it on. There was
[34:24] no way that um that was just, you know,
[34:27] uh a camp thing or a emotional thing. So
[34:31] I really treasured it and and I'm and
[34:33] I'm praying uh fervently for that
[34:35] brother that he stand fast in faith.
[34:38] Then one of the highlights was the the
[34:41] two sisters stomping on Satan's head
[34:45] with victory in their countenance. I
[34:48] couldn't I I cannot I cannot take away
[34:50] that picture. Now maybe from the flesh
[34:53] the the girls would go, "Oh my my my and
[34:55] I didn't look that nice." But what I saw
[34:58] was victory. What I saw was overcoming
[35:00] power. What I saw was the reality of the
[35:02] Holy Ghost in their lives. And they, as
[35:05] I said before, I won't change it. They
[35:07] were leaving earth. They were in a
[35:09] different space, in a different
[35:11] environment in that moment. And and I
[35:13] and I thank the Lord that I could walk
[35:15] past at that point and and see something
[35:18] like that. I said, "That is true
[35:20] worship." In my mind, I said, "Lord,
[35:22] that's worship." Now, this theme was
[35:24] going on already in my in my head. But
[35:26] when I saw that, the Lord was gracious
[35:29] enough to say that if you wanted to see
[35:31] worship, there's worship. That's
[35:33] worship. [snorts] And then a lot of
[35:35] people probably don't know the minister,
[35:38] brother John Andes on Sunday afternoon
[35:41] was physically literally the last person
[35:44] to leave the sanctuary. He was
[35:47] overwhelmed is one of the words that
[35:49] came to mind. I went in into the
[35:53] minister's office and just made sure, is
[35:54] he all right? Do you need a drink? Is he
[35:56] okay? And and he was just almost
[35:58] flabbergasted. He was just in awe and
[36:01] and and enjoying this presence of God.
[36:03] He just didn't want to let it go. I just
[36:05] that's what his face told me. And I I
[36:10] again, it's such a privilege to see
[36:12] those moments. And no, I'm leaving this
[36:15] building, but the minister, he's still
[36:18] staying. The minister is just so
[36:21] so in awe of the presence of the Lord in
[36:25] that environment. So well done to you
[36:27] all of you, not only the musicians, but
[36:29] setting that atmosphere of worship and
[36:32] so that the Lord and the Holy Ghost just
[36:34] lingers and just you know can can can um
[36:38] can minister back to a minister back to
[36:40] a preacher. That was beautiful to see.
[36:44] Now the next I I went now and that
[36:46] that's my what what does the what does
[36:49] the prophet say about worship? Um and he
[36:52] says a lot about worship. Um, now that
[36:56] we have the reality of camp and how how
[36:59] I think worship looks like, I wanted to
[37:02] see if that doveetales what what brother
[37:04] Brandham sees. And here in the sermon he
[37:09] they are singing. So there's always some
[37:11] song um uh relation or or the the the
[37:15] the sermon is done, the message has been
[37:18] given and then now they you know start
[37:20] singing a bit bit of a chorus and then
[37:24] this the scene is set. The the the the
[37:26] time for worship is now and that's what
[37:28] he's saying here. So they singing this
[37:30] song for this bright city John was going
[37:33] down and right at the bottom he says
[37:35] don't you just love him? The message is
[37:37] over now. This is worship. We don't come
[37:40] to church just to hear the message. We
[37:43] come to worship. Just forget about the
[37:45] person next to you. Just worship him.
[37:48] Oh, how beautiful. How wonderful. Just
[37:50] just tell him. You don't have to tell
[37:52] him loud. Just tell him in your heart, I
[37:54] love you, Lord. Forgive me of my sin. Oh
[37:57] my. So then when I went on to this
[37:59] journey and that's why I said such a
[38:01] profound little theme that it just took
[38:04] me. So please bear with me. This is just
[38:06] I found it as gold. So I'm I'm sort of
[38:09] ministering to myself here. And then
[38:11] where where's he's singing again, you
[38:13] know, there at the cross where I where
[38:15] he took me and glory to his name. And
[38:17] then he switches and he goes, "Oh, I
[38:19] just love this way. I love to worship
[38:22] God in quietness in like this." Now he's
[38:25] singing and then he's going um God in
[38:27] quietness like this. If you listen to
[38:29] the sermon, you know, there's the people
[38:30] are singing and praising the Lord, but
[38:33] it drops down. There's there's a penny
[38:35] drop. It's it's it's something that's
[38:36] got some real meaning to it. Just feel
[38:39] that something is near. What happened at
[38:41] the altar call when those sinners
[38:43] accepted Christ? The angels raised up
[38:46] from their seats. So they they observe
[38:49] true worship now as well. See what's
[38:52] make you feel this way.
[38:56] This is worship. When the soul is
[38:58] worshiping God, the the word has gone
[39:01] forth. See the Holy Spirit is blessing
[39:04] and watering now. And then the song
[39:07] continues again and he just goes into
[39:09] that uh our heavenly father as the
[39:12] beautiful sacred presence of the Holy
[39:14] Spirit now standing here blessing his
[39:16] children. Many times many times he has
[39:19] to correct them. For every son that
[39:21] cometh to God must first be chasened and
[39:24] tried. Receive child training and
[39:26] reproofs. No exceptions everyone. But
[39:30] when we endure the correction of our
[39:32] father, then it health through forth the
[39:35] present and pleasant fruit. That's just
[39:39] so beautifully put. I pray God that
[39:41] you'll just let each child know that.
[39:44] Not go away. Just kind of imagine that.
[39:47] Let them know that this is your
[39:49] blessings to them.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; The sincere milk of the gospel pouring
[39:54] down in their soul. Milk and honey out
[39:56] of Canaan's land. new wine to stimulate
[39:59] in their faith worshiping and this is
[40:01] now referring back to that prostrate is
[40:05] hearts bowed before thee the spiritual
[40:08] hands up tears running down cheeks
[40:10] quietly reverently worshiping
[40:14] and I just oh I can go on and on and on
[40:18] how the Lord's just um blessed me with
[40:22] with the quotes and then there's a
[40:26] are we here now Yes.
[40:28] Oh God, I'm so happy. I just love you so
[40:32] Lord. I want to express to you my
[40:34] feeling. You see now like all of that
[40:37] says the message has been given. I'm
[40:39] giving you the message and then the
[40:41] message will stop and and you will start
[40:43] as as I told the other day start
[40:46] regurgitate on it and and in your mind
[40:49] um you you you you relaying this back to
[40:53] the Lord. Lord what I what am I grasping
[40:55] from this? What is in it for me? What do
[40:58] I need to take away from here? And and
[41:02] in that moment, that that's where you're
[41:04] now starting to to reflect, starting to
[41:07] praise the Lord, starting to enter into
[41:09] worship where you go, Lord, I'm nothing
[41:12] and you are everything. What more can I
[41:14] give so that you can come in? And that
[41:17] we will get to now. expressing that
[41:20] every uh the very adoration of my heart
[41:23] that I adore thee, thou matchless one. I
[41:26] love thee. Beautifully put.
[41:30] And then uh this is this is now where
[41:34] uh almost there. Yeah. U
[41:41] second to last quote I think for now.
[41:44] Now with our heads bowed quietly. Now
[41:47] this is worship. The message is over. No
[41:49] one leaves. Just be quiet. Let's
[41:51] worship. The message is the correcting.
[41:54] Now think over now what you've done,
[41:57] what you should have done. What made you
[41:59] what you are today? What makes you
[42:01] condemned today is because you did
[42:03] something yesterday or what will it be
[42:05] tomorrow? Now this is critical. Make it
[42:08] right today and you'll be free tomorrow.
[42:10] See, you must make a choice. How can you
[42:13] do it? By faith. I now let loose of
[42:18] everything.
[42:19] Now that is basically surrendering. That
[42:22] is saying Lord I cannot I cannot hold
[42:26] and and if you go into the world if you
[42:28] if you work like me and and and some of
[42:31] the brothers here some of you young ones
[42:33] already in in a workplace situation it's
[42:36] it's selfish. It's hard. It's confusing.
[42:40] as people that got a short temper and
[42:42] and you know we're not we're not
[42:44] receiving it there. So we need to say
[42:47] well they can't make it. They're not
[42:49] making it. I'm seeing it. I don't want
[42:51] to be that. Lord come into my life and
[42:54] make make yourself
[42:57] h everything in me. I now let loose and
[43:02] someday I'm going to go over there.
[43:05] Amen.
[43:06] And here's a little the the next one is
[43:10] the little segue. So um you know
[43:12] sometimes I I do appreciate some numbers
[43:15] and when I looked at the numbers I go oh
[43:17] this is slide 17 is the next one. 17 for
[43:20] me is a new dispensation means it's a
[43:23] direction change of a different angle
[43:25] and this is just how the Lord led it to
[43:29] be in my in my little slight black pack
[43:31] back. God likes to be worshiped. And
[43:35] when you worship him, it isn't exactly
[43:37] singing a song as we do, but singing it
[43:40] in the spirit of worship. You see, then
[43:43] you feel the Holy Spirit bounce back.
[43:46] Now, I've written here theophony. That's
[43:48] when you when you bump into, you know,
[43:50] you you hear the brushing of the angel's
[43:53] wings. There's just you are in a
[43:55] different realm and you don't know
[43:56] what's going around you. You you've left
[43:59] earth as I as I talked about.
[44:03] And that was that was critical because
[44:05] that's um that's the turning point now
[44:09] for where where I want to lead to and
[44:13] one of the main things that we shouldn't
[44:16] misunderstand about worship
[44:19] and that is music.
[44:22] Now music
[44:24] is not worship. I'll just put it out
[44:26] there. But it is a very powerful tool
[44:30] that gets us into an atmosphere of of of
[44:34] worship. Now let's be clear. God created
[44:37] music,
[44:38] &gt;&gt; right? It comes from him. The original
[44:41] seed, the original sheet music. It is
[44:44] him. Okay? He made it in the simplest
[44:47] form to be the simplest form to enter in
[44:50] in an atmosphere of worship. But with
[44:54] the original, there comes perversion.
[44:57] And the heavenly songs and rhythms
[45:00] change to the to the contrary. And some
[45:03] of the examples I was thinking about is
[45:06] if you go if you ride the train to work
[45:09] and back, what do you see? All the
[45:11] people sitting on their little
[45:12] headphones, you know, not talking to
[45:14] each other. Very antisocial in this
[45:16] social media age. Um it's sometimes even
[45:19] in my house. Um, not that that's wrong,
[45:23] but do you think they're all listening
[45:26] to gospel music on the train?
[45:28] &gt;&gt; I think not. Now, but and as as as I'll
[45:33] get to it now,
[45:35] that's they feeding on it. And whatever
[45:38] that music is is driving him to some
[45:41] sort of atmosphere of worship, worship
[45:43] of something contrary, right? So, we all
[45:46] with me say amen.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[45:51] And
[45:52] everyone is seeking after their own
[45:54] little fix, right? So there's a chemical
[45:57] reaction that happens in you when you
[45:58] listen to music. I'm not going to go
[46:00] into depth. Someone else a bit more
[46:02] competent can do that, but it's called
[46:04] dopamine. It's a little, you know,
[46:06] little get getter upper and um and
[46:09] people feel good when they listen to
[46:12] music. It's just a it's just a
[46:14] scientific fact. So, I wanted to uh drop
[46:17] this in here that uh a few like a little
[46:20] testimony of music and my life before
[46:23] Christ and and sort of where I'm now.
[46:26] Someone told me once that um when I
[46:29] asked them actually, ironically,
[46:32] why are they constantly listening to
[46:34] music? Can't they just sit in silence?
[46:37] Now, I would go and walk in the in the
[46:40] in the field. I would go on a hunt. I
[46:42] would, you know, and I I enjoy the
[46:44] silence. I I love listening to God's
[46:46] creation, smelling the fresh grass,
[46:49] maybe smelling a deer if it's close by,
[46:52] but um I I enjoy the silence. I don't
[46:54] have to have headphones. Sometimes they
[46:56] they drive in their cars with the
[46:58] headphones on. And for me, I I just Is
[47:00] that safe? You know, so for me it was
[47:03] easy to to switch off to pause to to to
[47:08] hear the Lord in his creation, but they
[47:11] said no, I can't be left with my own
[47:14] thoughts. So I thought that is
[47:16] incredible that they need to keep on
[47:19] this listening to music or getting them
[47:22] on some sort of segue so that they don't
[47:24] think about their own thoughts. What a
[47:27] dangerous dangerous spot that you are
[47:29] in. So yes, few testimonies of of music
[47:32] and how music can cause the atmosphere
[47:35] and will
[47:37] uh believe it or not if you look at my
[47:39] stature. One time I was gming. I was uh
[47:42] I was heavy in the in the weights
[47:45] department and I wanted to be the
[47:47] strongest in the gym and lifted a lot of
[47:50] things. Do you think I listen to opera
[47:53] music and what what was blaring in my
[47:56] ears? uh a little classical or maybe
[47:59] even jazz. No, no, no, no, no. You
[48:01] wanted to, you know, lift heavy stuff.
[48:04] So, it's heavy metal or it's um and it's
[48:07] rock or whatever, you know. So, I always
[48:09] wanted to Now, here was the ironic bit
[48:11] and that's probably the how the Lord
[48:12] created me. I sweat a lot. So,
[48:16] headphones on my ears or in my ears that
[48:18] just didn't work. So, I would sneakily
[48:21] go to the reception and say, "Hey, can
[48:22] you play this or can you have this
[48:24] little, you know, CD going?" so that I
[48:26] can, you know, pump my jams and and uh
[48:29] yeah. So, how how I had to use that and
[48:33] rely on that to to, you know, get me
[48:36] into that zone where I can lift all the
[48:39] things I want to lift. And then the car
[48:41] I uh
[48:43] London can testify to this. I would have
[48:46] people um maybe you won't know, but we
[48:49] called it CDs. This is this nice little
[48:52] thing, little silver thing, you know,
[48:54] and it spins around. Um, it's awesome if
[48:58] you put it in the microwave. I didn't
[49:00] give you that advice, but um, take all
[49:03] the old CDs that's non- gospel and throw
[49:05] it in the microwave for 12 seconds. Um,
[49:08] I would I would write these little CDs
[49:11] so you could write your own music and I
[49:12] and I would have these little themed it
[49:15] said on the thing. I didn't write the
[49:17] songs. I said this is the theme. So
[49:19] adrenaline rush or smooth or cruisy or
[49:23] road trip, you know, that was my theme.
[49:26] So I would always write these little and
[49:28] that puts you in that atmosphere of, you
[49:30] know, so use that there. I I would lay
[49:33] with I had a Walkman. I don't think of
[49:35] you know Walkman,
[49:37] little Sony Walkman. Uh when I was in
[49:40] service here for Christ, we had long
[49:42] days and I just wanted to chill, you
[49:44] know, just had your shower. Now you're
[49:46] back in this bunk bed and everyone's
[49:47] snoring at the top. So, putting in the
[49:50] headphones and just listening to um one
[49:52] of my favorites was um how lovely is
[49:56] your dwelling place, oh Lord Almighty. I
[50:02] don't know if you know it but better as
[50:04] one day in your house and a thousand
[50:06] elsewhere. And that's sort of what I I
[50:10] enjoyed with it. So now the gospel is
[50:12] now creeping in, you know, now good
[50:14] music is there, but there's still, you
[50:15] know, lively little Christian rock and
[50:18] all that that sneaks in because it sets
[50:20] that atmosphere, right?
[50:23] Um, at that moment, it just let me
[50:27] forget about everything. Doesn't matter
[50:29] which the what the atmosphere or what
[50:31] the music or the style or the theme was.
[50:34] I would just all my situations and and
[50:36] problems or what I were dealing with
[50:39] would just disappear for that for that
[50:42] moment. Now, it made me wonder where did
[50:45] this perversion come from? Where did it
[50:47] all go wrong? You know, we had music.
[50:50] God created music for us to enter into
[50:53] worship. Where did it go all wrong?
[50:57] And we do find it in the scriptures,
[50:59] believe it or not. Isaiah 14:11, "Your
[51:02] pomp has been brought down to sh which
[51:04] is the depths which is uh which is hell
[51:08] along with the music of your harps.
[51:11] Maggots are your bed and worms your
[51:14] blanket." This is a different um
[51:16] translation. I think it's a Berean
[51:17] translation and I thought just that that
[51:20] that is is quite descriptive and it's
[51:23] very interesting that brother Jimmy read
[51:26] Psalms 150 talking about harps talking
[51:28] about the um trimble uh tabret and I've
[51:33] got it now you'll see uh it it just
[51:35] dovetales so wonderfully because David's
[51:38] talking about the original
[51:40] &gt;&gt; praise him with this
[51:41] &gt;&gt; we he gave us this creativity this
[51:44] creative power to make this but don't
[51:46] Use it for the perversion. Don't use it
[51:48] for the bad.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Son of man, take up a lamentation upon
[51:54] the king of Tyrus. Now, king of Tyrus
[51:56] here is referring to Satan within that
[52:00] king. The the the the the prophet talks
[52:02] about Tyrus didn't live in the day.
[52:05] You'll see now this sayaith the Lord,
[52:07] thou sealest up the sum full of wisdom
[52:10] and perfect in beauty. See now that
[52:12] perfect in beauty. There's a countenance
[52:14] talking about here. Thou has been in
[52:17] Eden, the garden of God. So Tyrus was
[52:20] clearly not in Eden. That's why we're
[52:22] referring to Satan which is in him in
[52:25] the garden of Eden. Every precious stone
[52:29] was thy covering. Now he names all of
[52:31] it. Sardius, topaz, diamond, barrel,
[52:33] onyx, jasper, sapphire, emerald, and
[52:37] carbuncle and gold. So you see now this
[52:40] brightness, this countenance, this this
[52:43] perfect in beauty. Look at me. Okay.
[52:48] And then the workmanship of thy tablets
[52:50] and of thy pipes. Now, interestingly,
[52:53] lots of the other translations go
[52:55] towards workmanship, as in work with the
[52:58] till, work with instruments or
[53:00] implements. But we're talking here about
[53:02] about musical um apparatus, tablets, and
[53:05] of thy pipes was um prepared in thee in
[53:08] the day that thou was created. Just show
[53:11] you. Hey, and then the power of music.
[53:16] I want to talk about the power of music.
[53:22] music does evoke
[53:24] uh a sense of wonder and awe for lots of
[53:28] people. Now, this is Daniel Leventon,
[53:31] neuroscientist at McGill University, who
[53:33] scans the brain of people while they're
[53:35] listening to tunes, right?
[53:38] Music does evoke Oh, sorry. Uh some of
[53:42] it is still mysterious to us, he says.
[53:44] But what we can talk about are some
[53:47] neural circuits or uh networks involved
[53:50] in the experience of pleasure and
[53:53] reward. Remember that pleasure and
[53:56] reward.
[53:58] We imagine uh why do I feel this way?
[54:03] Why is this music teaching me what is
[54:05] vast and mysterious?
[54:08] Music allows us to feel these
[54:10] transcendent emotions. He says
[54:16] right emotions like awe which stimulates
[54:18] the brain into a sense of wonder help
[54:21] the current epidemic of our times which
[54:24] is loneliness. Kelner says with music we
[54:28] uh feel we're part of community and that
[54:30] has a direct effect on health and being
[54:32] which is crucial to survival.
[54:36] That could be why music plays such a
[54:39] powerful role in many religions,
[54:41] spirituality, and rituals. He says now,
[54:45] the power of music in the wrong hands.
[54:49] And I've got a few, just a couple of
[54:50] examples. There's a vast amount of
[54:52] examples out there of individuals that's
[54:55] using music
[54:58] uh in the wrong way. So, it started off
[55:02] beautiful. It started off correct. It
[55:04] started off clean and pure, but
[55:06] perversion sets in.
[55:09] Talking about Katy Perry. Anyone knows
[55:12] Katy Perry?
[55:14] Oh, how do you know them? Huh? Okay,
[55:17] we'll pray for you. Eh,
[55:20] before the world knew her as a hit maker
[55:24] uh of the her songs, Katie was just a
[55:26] California girl with a dream and a
[55:27] gospel background. Born into a
[55:30] conservative family, her first notes
[55:31] were sung in a church pew. Not packed
[55:34] stadium, she released gospel album into
[55:37] her teens. But deep down, she was meant
[55:40] for more than just a choir stand. Yes,
[55:42] she was meant for more. She was meant to
[55:45] be a godly lady dressed prop
[55:48] appropriately, standing in a pew next to
[55:51] her uh her children, showing them uh
[55:54] being a role model of what the the
[55:56] stature of a perfect woman should be.
[55:58] that was meant for more. But no, she had
[56:01] this little thought of uh hey, I'll just
[56:05] sell my soul. I'll just give up because
[56:07] powerful music and changed into which
[56:11] atmosphere of worship is this leading
[56:14] me. Right. And there it all started with
[56:16] good intentions.
[56:18] Another example, Jimmy, guess what we
[56:22] sang tonight.
[56:25] So you know this song.
[56:27] When this life is over,
[56:30] I
[56:33] I know I'll see your face. Every night I
[56:36] pray, every step I take, every move I
[56:38] make, every single day, every night I
[56:41] pray. It sounds okay. Sounds okay.
[56:45] Do anyone know this song? That's good.
[56:49] Thank you. Ah, we do. We do. Okay. Fish,
[56:52] I also I I knew this song before I
[56:54] researched it. Um, it's Puff Daddy. You
[56:58] probably don't know who's Puff Daddy
[56:59] because he's changed his name 700 times.
[57:01] He's now P Diddy and he's in trouble.
[57:04] Yes. So now he steals songs. He steals
[57:08] the original. And by the way, the other
[57:10] bit, Every Night I Pray, Every Step I
[57:12] Take is also stolen from another
[57:14] musician. Not godly, but it shows you
[57:18] where it starts and where it transcends
[57:22] to and where Okay. I won't go into too
[57:26] much of that. I don't want to be
[57:28] negative. It's not all negative, but God
[57:31] gives warnings. And do we heed to these
[57:33] little signposts and as as we are
[57:36] tonight? And one thing that stood out
[57:38] and sort of that is one of the first
[57:41] things I put into this thought was was a
[57:44] guy called Don Potter. Some people would
[57:46] know this. Uh Don Potter is from Morning
[57:50] Star Ministries. He's an old fellow now.
[57:54] So this is this is probably 90s I would
[57:57] think. Facing the wall. Facing the wall.
[58:01] Now this is what he said what the Lord
[58:03] talked to him. I've spent many years
[58:05] trying to entertain people and later
[58:07] lead them into the praise of the Lord
[58:09] Jesus. In the middle of leading praise
[58:12] one night or day. I believe the Lord uh
[58:15] uh uh said, "Go home and play until you
[58:19] discern my presence." I did this by
[58:22] facing the wall and playing the guitar.
[58:25] At first, I could only play a few
[58:27] minutes before the desire to entertain
[58:30] crept back in. After a year, after one
[58:34] year, I could play for hours and never
[58:37] realize it happens. You know, never
[58:40] realize that I want to entertain or want
[58:42] to. And look at this. The pleasure of
[58:45] the Lord was better than any reward I
[58:49] had ever ever received. So, I just
[58:52] wanted to flick back quickly to remind
[58:54] you of what
[58:57] uh what music does. Where is it now?
[59:04] Oh, sorry. I think I was I was reading
[59:06] it from here. So from here it said that
[59:09] music
[59:11] um
[59:15] we can talk about some neural circuits
[59:17] of networks involved in the experience
[59:20] of pleasure and reward and the pleasure
[59:24] of the Lord was better than any reward
[59:26] I'd ever ever receive. And that I got
[59:29] for free this afternoon when I said oh I
[59:32] said this and and this tied in. So
[59:35] praise the Lord. Praise the Lord for
[59:36] that.
[59:38] So, someone heeded to that call. Someone
[59:40] heeded to that warning and say, "Hey,
[59:42] hang on. I'm using this powerful tool
[59:45] for the wrong thing. I'm going into
[59:48] worship, but worshiping what? Something
[59:51] contrary to what the Lord's created it
[59:53] for." And this is just a a friendly uh
[59:56] reminder. It's not to, you know, tap
[59:59] anyone over the uh over the fingers or
[1:00:02] anything. It is for me as well a very
[1:00:04] good reminder because what goes in will
[1:00:07] come out. What are you feeding on? The
[1:00:09] white dog or the black dog. Be very um
[1:00:13] attentive. What are you listening to is
[1:00:15] taking you where? It's taking you to
[1:00:17] what you know is it is it down memory
[1:00:19] lane? Is it is it into history? Is it
[1:00:22] away from the Lord? You would know this.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Um be honest with yourself. And in
[1:00:30] closing,
[1:00:32] I um I wrote down just a few things that
[1:00:35] that I wanted to to leave with you when
[1:00:39] we are and while we are going into into
[1:00:42] prayer tonight
[1:00:45] that what or who is your God? So
[1:00:49] remember I said I gave you the the the
[1:00:51] definition of what's worship, right? And
[1:00:53] worship we can go back. What is worship?
[1:00:56] But God, the word God is an object of
[1:01:00] worship. So what is your God? That's why
[1:01:02] I'm saying it in this way. And what what
[1:01:05] what are you what are you worshiping? So
[1:01:08] this God, what do you worship? Are you
[1:01:11] are you worshiping in spirit and truth?
[1:01:13] What are you worshiping when you are at
[1:01:15] church? Are you here just to sing a song
[1:01:18] or hear a message or are you here to
[1:01:20] worship? Now that comes from brother
[1:01:21] Brandon. That comes from his message.
[1:01:24] He says we we we can't just be here to
[1:01:26] sing a song, clap clap a few hands and
[1:01:29] uh and and and and and listen to the
[1:01:31] message. It needs to go beyond that. So
[1:01:33] whatever has been given to you by the
[1:01:35] Lord, what are you what are you feeding
[1:01:37] then on and what what are you doing with
[1:01:39] it when it when it's when it's in you
[1:01:41] and it's and it's and it's pricricked
[1:01:42] your heart.
[1:01:44] So worshiping in spirit and in truth,
[1:01:46] what's the spirit and what is truth? Um
[1:01:50] it is sort of rhetorical. you would know
[1:01:52] this, but I wanted to leave it with you
[1:01:54] so that you can go into your prayer
[1:01:57] closet and and talk to the Lord and and
[1:01:59] just adore him as as brother Brandham
[1:02:02] said here in one of his quotes um and
[1:02:04] and and worship him. And where and when
[1:02:08] do you worship? Now,
[1:02:12] because we we we we read there what is
[1:02:14] worship? If I if you wanted to, I'll
[1:02:17] just give you a reverent honor and
[1:02:18] homage pay to God in this case. Let's
[1:02:21] pay to to Jesus Christ our our savior
[1:02:24] that died on the cross, right? Um to
[1:02:28] fall, to crouch, a humble submission
[1:02:30] with an attitude of adoration.
[1:02:34] You can do that anywhere.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; It is not just at church. It's not just
[1:02:38] at home. It's not just in your prayer
[1:02:40] closet. Is when I get in the car six
[1:02:43] o'clock in the morning driving to work,
[1:02:45] I'd put on a tape. Maybe I do. Some days
[1:02:48] I just drive in silence. It's the most
[1:02:50] beautiful time and the Lord placed
[1:02:52] something in me or I start to just yo
[1:02:54] Lord, thank you for this wonderful day.
[1:02:56] I see the birds chirping and everything
[1:02:58] and everything is going well. You're
[1:03:00] looking after my family. Praise you. I'm
[1:03:03] I'm busy worshiping, right? Um I I was
[1:03:07] uh another example in in at camp early
[1:03:11] in the morning. So, we go and tidy up
[1:03:13] the uh the auditorium and do a bit of a
[1:03:15] freshen up and check the bathroom. So
[1:03:17] all that in that in that I'm thinking oh
[1:03:22] how how wonderful was last night what
[1:03:24] was what was said again what did I see
[1:03:26] what did I observe what came in and I
[1:03:29] stopped and I and I and I and I and I
[1:03:31] was up with my hands I said Lord you are
[1:03:34] a magnificent he hasn't left that
[1:03:36] presence he hasn't left now and went to
[1:03:38] sleep he's there he's waiting for us
[1:03:41] again so that atmosphere was set that
[1:03:43] was beautiful because now I know in my
[1:03:46] in myself. I'm busy worshiping and it's
[1:03:49] 5 seconds and I walked I was going over
[1:03:51] the bridge and there was something that
[1:03:52] pricked me again. I go, "Oh man."
[1:03:54] Started singing, started rejoicing, you
[1:03:56] know, Psalm 150. Praise him. Praise him
[1:03:59] anyway. You can praise him. You know,
[1:04:02] make him your adoration. So you can
[1:04:05] worship him anywhere. Anywhere.
[1:04:07] Anywhere. Children, anywhere. Don't wait
[1:04:10] for church. Worship him anywhere. all
[1:04:13] these little songs that you sing. Maybe
[1:04:15] I can give a little testimony. Hopefully
[1:04:17] hopefully Daniel won't mind. Um he said
[1:04:21] uh he's walking past
[1:04:24] and u was it your nose? There was
[1:04:27] something that just irritated him and he
[1:04:30] goes, "Satan, I'm tired of you and just,
[1:04:33] you know, just get out." And but in the
[1:04:35] in the I'm busy. And he just walks and
[1:04:39] minutes go by. I go, "Is that what I
[1:04:42] heard?" You know, he was just, we would
[1:04:44] say in Africans, he was dropping him
[1:04:45] eight. He was just putting him in his
[1:04:46] place right there, right there, just in
[1:04:48] his in his conversation, in his walk. I
[1:04:50] go, "That's right. Amen." And I'm clip
[1:04:53] art. Amen. You know, all loud, but no
[1:04:55] one's there. I go, "Praise the Lord."
[1:04:57] That's that's for me. That's worship.
[1:04:59] That's that's realness. And that's when
[1:05:01] when revelation and the penny drop. So,
[1:05:03] thank you so much for your time. Let's
[1:05:06] let's go and stand. Let's have the
[1:05:08] musicians which can lead us into an
[1:05:11] atmosphere of worship. Praise the Lord.
[1:05:14] Uh I don't have a song. Do you have a
[1:05:16] song, Jimmy?
[1:05:19] Um
[1:05:20] I I actually contacted Sister Latab
[1:05:23] because I wanted to have a specific song
[1:05:26] was playing in my head the whole week
[1:05:27] and I forgot she's in Oakuckland. So uh
[1:05:30] that didn't didn't help. Oh, we can
[1:05:32] actually sing. Um can we do the raise a
[1:05:34] hallelujah?
[1:05:36] Yeah. Yeah.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; H you you want to sing it? [laughter]
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Jimmy did well. Jimmy, round of applause
[1:05:50] for Jimmy. Jimmy, [applause]
[1:05:52] God bless you, my
[1:05:58] um before we call for the P. Let's just
