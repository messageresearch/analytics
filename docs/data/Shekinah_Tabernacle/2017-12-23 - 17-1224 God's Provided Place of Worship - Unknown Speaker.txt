got a testimony or a song you'd like to share during the service could you please tell brother ed so we can arrange the service and everything and that's all the announcements so if you've got your your Bibles handy let's just go to Luke chapter 2 and we're going to read from Luke chapter 2 then we're going to go to to Tirana me 16 and I don't have a slideshow so today so see it's here so it's so we're going to read Luke chapter 2 verses 1 down to verse 18 and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria and all went to be taxed every one into his own City and Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea unto the City of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end and they were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord came upon them and the glory of the Lord shone around about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you Is Born This Day in the City of David a savior which is Christ the Lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly deals the there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and peace on earth and goodwill towards men and it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven the Shepherd's said one to another let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the LORD hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the babe in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds amen and let's go to to Tirana me chapter 16 and verse 1 we're gonna read down to verse eight so this is see you see it now see one there you see the rustle of Indian paper come to a cease and then that's the cue says observe the month of a bird which is April and keep the pass over unto the Lord thy God from the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night thou shalt therefore sacrifice the Passover unto the Lord thy God of the flock and the herd and the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name there now notice is very important the place he shall choose thou shall eat no leavened bread with it seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread there worth even the bread of affliction for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt and hast that thou may us remember the day when now comes forth other land of Egypt all the days of thy life and there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee and all biko seven days neither shall there be anything of the flesh which they'll sect sacrifices the first day it even remained all night until the morning thou mayst not sacrifice the Passover within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee but at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in there shall vow sacrifice the Passover even at the going down of the Sun at the season when thou comest forth out of Egypt and thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose and thou shall turn in the morning and go unto thy tents six days shalt thou eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God thou shalt do no work there and amen may the Lord bless his word you may have your seats this morning I'd like to speak this morning on God's provided place of worship now we we are here in this Christmas season and we understand that you know we rejoice in the in the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ and many people will no doubt look at it as a historical thing in it and it was in that sense but he's a present God he's not in a manger anymore this morning if we go to Bethlehem we'll and even if they could find the manger he's not there anymore those shepherds aren't there anymore I mean but the but the Shepherd's message that Messiah is upon the earth presently amen is still the same that message is still the same and now we got to find we have to find in this hour where God has chosen to put his name and that's where we shall worship a man this is important we don't he said you weren't you shouldn't worship Justin just in any gate but in the gate that I have put my name in there you shall worship now we understand the Old Testament the Apostle Paul would speak in Hebrews 10 and 1 he said for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of things can never with those sacrifices were say offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect and then in Colossians 2 and 16 he says let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink and respective holyday or of the new moon or of the Sabbath days which are a shadow of things to come but the body of Christ so we read through and the Old Testament was a shadow pointing towards a reality that we are now living in amen so we know the Old Testament is not just a a history of something that doesn't apply to us but it's a shadow pointing to Christ amen so we've got to find the gate we're going to find the place where God has chosen to put his name and that's where the believers are called to worship now we know in the Old Testament when they were journeying from Egypt to the promised land they had the Tabernacle in the wilderness and we understand that eventually that Tabernacle would be made into a temple made of stone and golden wood in the in the promised land but it wasn't the season for it to be made into that temple that Solomon built it had to be a mobile tent because that was how that because the people were journeying and that's where God placed his name and that was God's provided place of worship and then eventually David David's son Solomon would build him a house of stone and that was God's provided place of worship but that was just a shadow that was just a shadow he comes he comes Jesus is now born upon the earth and he says destroy this temple and in three days I'll raise it up again and the scribes and Pharisees caught up in there and there yo the physical things and the natural things and they didn't understand that he was speaking of his body which was the temple now God's name when when he reveals his name he is showing something he's going to manifest to the people now before man comes you read in Genesis 1 it says God in the beginning God made heavens and the earth but then and that word God means Elohim the self existing one but then when but then when man is about to come up on the scene in chapter 2 it says and then the Lord God made and that's the self existing one who begins to reveal himself before man came upon the earth there was no one that he could reveal himself to he couldn't reveal himself to the animals they had nothing to respond back to him with he wanted his family upon the earth he wanted a relationship with his family to reveal himself to them that they could have a union they could have a relationship a mentor this is and then it's the Lord God and then now when when Abraham is walking with God God shows himself as El Shaddai I you know the life giver the it's called the breasted God like a mother breastfeeds a baby the strength Giver and he's known as Melchizedek who had no beginning or end we understand that was God himself a many he was young Almighty God God revealed himself in different ways through his name Amen it was the same God the whole time it wasn't a different God the same God revealing himself in different ways to Abraham because God has attributes we understand before there was a beginning he was a savior before there was a beginning he was a redeemer before there was anything Amen he was a sacrifice he was a priest he was a husband he is the comforter here's a provider here's a protector here's the captain of the host maybe it is a mighty mighty Conqueror he's all these things and many more and they are bound up in him but he wanted to express those attributes upon the earth to his people so he allowed sin to come into the picture men to be born into a fallen state then he did he that he could that he could show himself as a savior as a redeemer as an advocate hallelujah as a sacrifice they mean so God would begin to show himself down through the Old Testament was the same God but he would change his form but it was the same God all the time now it says here in Exodus 6 when Moses is speaking to Moses is speaking to God as his Nexus 6 and one says then the Lord said unto Moses now thou shalt see what I will do to Pharaoh for with a strong hand shall he let him go and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his hand I mean our God is a God of deliverance and God said unto Moses and in said unto him I am the Lord and I appeared unto Abraham and to Isaac under Jacob by the name of God Almighty but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them now if you go read back in the Old Testament where it says then the Lord spoke to Abraham if you go look at the Hebrew that that word is actually Jehovah but the thing is they did not know Abraham did not know God as a deliverer he was never in slavery he was never in bondage so now God was going to express himself the same God that was back there with with Abraham Isaac and Jacob was going to show himself as a deliverer as a redeemer I mean to break the yoke affair off the people amen and that that Pharaoh would let them go and they would leave Egypt and they've gone to their inheritance God was going to express that part of himself hallelujah and the thing is he did it amen how God he was born he was born as a baby in a manger I mean he came the mighty deliverer upon the earth I mean it said every man woman and child free I mean from the yoke of sin from every worker the enemy of God as a God of deliverance friends we shouldn't just paint up some manger seananners and that lovely I just so rejoice it came my deliverance hallelujah and he didn't just come 2,000 years ago but he's a present God today a true Shepherd will say Messiah is present upon the earth now hallelujah they won't say I'll just look back in history and minutes like having a painted fire a painted fire doesn't get you warm it could be so lifelike you can have the most advanced yo TV or whatever and have a fire there and place it in your fireplace if you have one at home you won't get warm and may look very wonderful that may even look more real than a real fire it doesn't get you up and it's the same thing today I mean what's the point of just looking back in history if he's not the same God today what's the point in just saying yes he did those things back there but we don't know where he is amen and and and we look at say yes he did it back there for them he delivered them back there he's hid them free back there but what about today I mean he's not a God of history I mean when I think of Christmas I don't think of a God of history only I mean because he was in the manger but he's not in the manger anymore hallelujah he was back there but he's present I'm in the Centurion when he went to Jesus this is a Gentile coming to Jesus and he says I have a sick servant now this is Gentile faith and he said over 6 servant and Jesus says I'll go and lay my hands upon them I'll come into your house and lay hands upon him because that was Jewish faith let me just go lay your hands and they all would be well but the Centurion said I'm not worthy that you for you to come under my roof but I'm a man of authority Amen I tell soldiers to go and do and they go and do and he recognized Jesus was a man of authority as well but a far greater authority than just a soldier and he said but just speak the word only and I know my servant will be well he had a revelation that God sending his word was exactly the same as Jesus stepping into the house amen to - to pray for the servant because he knew that Jesus and his word of 1 you cannot separate them they are not two different people are two different things when the work comes your way that is the Messiah coming to you that is Jesus Christ coming to you hallelujah and this Gentile faith I mean he's not just up in heaven someplace while one day we'll meet and one day we'll see him and we'll be like yes he's present upon the earth his spirit is brooding upon the earth looking for those I mean who will receive him hallelujah see so so we're instructed now God says the place I put my name the place of his choosing he will not meet you on the basis of your theology he will not even meet you on the basis of only your sincerity amen but he meets you in the place that he is ordained not the place is convenient for us but place that he is ordained and we understand it's not a physical location Amen because we know that God put his name in his son amen we understand that win when the saw in Isaiah 7:14 it says therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel which is God with us and I was a a nine and six for unto us a child was born for unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace those are that that's what his name shall be but then when we come into the New Testament we find he's not called the wonderful the everlasting father counselor Emmanuel I mean he wasn't called that name it says in Matthew 1 and 18 it says now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put away privately but while he thought on these things behold the angel Lord appeared to him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto the mirror thy wife for that which is conceived of her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins this is the purpose of God saying this is why he's going to be called Jesus he's my salvation manifested upon the earth more than your salvation from a physical slavery I mean but a but a salvation from sin from unbelief from all the works of the flesh and then from a full of nature hallelujah is not just oh yes he's my he's my Redeemer he's my Savior but you but real faith produces it in the life I'm in the faith and the promise produces that in the life hallelujah and now all this was done notice that it might be fulfilled which is spoken of the Lord by the Prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name manual which is being interpreted God with us then Joseph being raised from sleep that is the angel of the Lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife and you heard not till she brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name Jesus well then why didn't he call him the everlasting father the mighty God the counselor Prince of Peace because all of the oaths are encapsulated in the name of Jesus Christ that's why the name of Jesus is the name above all names because it's through the name of Jesus Christ deliverance is given salvation is given the rapture is given the body changes given aim in the devil's place down to the feet hallelujah rubble a believer because it's the name of Jesus Christ amen and that's why you see the angel the angel wasn't contradicting you know because that same angel of God anointed the prophet Isaiah has the Holy Spirit that same one anointed the prophet Isaiah gave him the prophecy the same one came to Joseph they weren't contradicting one another Amen but the interpretation of you shall call him your you know the you're a wonderful counselor the mighty God the everlasting father Prince of Peace the interpretation of that was the name Jesus hallelujah amen s now it's the same thing now now so God and Jesus said I come in my father's name John 5:43 I come in my father's name and you received me not if another shall come in his own name him you will receive so what name did he come in Jesus that's the name of the Father Allu yeah I came in my father's name he says you shall worship in the place with a Lord God shall choose to place his name in so the Lord placed his name in his son not in a physical location but in his son hallelujah and Jesus himself said Jesus said unto the beginning this is John 10 and 7 merely with us and he I am the door of the Sheep he is the door he is the gate Amen God place his name in there hallelujah so God won't meet us any in any other place but in this place now we understand that Jesus is his word he's not a separate as would the man of Galilee was the word made flesh and dwelt among us here's his word you cannot if you leave the word you've left Jesus he's not he's not simple you cannot separate him from his word if you leave the word you have left God and so now the place he has placed his name and you say well that's the man of Galilee in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us it's not just ink on paper it's a being he's a being and he led his children from from from Genesis all the way down out of Egypt into the Promised Land he was one who spoke to Moses his one who spoke to David is one who spoke to all the prophets down through that was the word and it became manifested in them hallelujah and then now and then the fullness of the Godhead bodily I mean twelve and the man Christ Jesus here comes God's lamb now we're going to get to the Shepherd's because history repeats itself but he is his word so now where does God place has provided place of worship is in his Living Word for the day I mean it's not in tradition I me remember this Bible I trust you don't think this is just God's Word out of tradition or out of culture but God has revealed it to you this is me in print form I mean you could have the revelation this is you in print form Lord God this is not someone's man's idea and someone translated it this way this way in that way but this is God and printful hallelujah so it's got to go more than just from tradition but now he is his word now how do you get into this GaAs provide a place of worship is it by joining a church now it's not by joining a church as it by joining a denomination is not by joining a denomination we are told in the scripture in first Corinthians twelve by one spirit you're baptized into God's chosen place of worship by one spirit you're baptized into one body I mean because he only meets the people under the shed blood he doesn't meet you anywhere else he says don't sacrifice don't bring your sacrifice to any other gate I meant bring it to the place I have chosen lelou you and you are the living sacrifice you're going to present yourself as a living sacrifice not a you know I trust you not a Christian out of convenience you know I was praying I say Lord I was praying this morning Lord you're not an errand boy you're not a mascot you're not some some go do this for me go to this mean if you do this for me I'll serve you if you don't well I'll put you on the Shelf a little but you're not a god of convenience he is the Lord God Almighty I mean he's the creator of heavens and earth I mean he's the head of the body and we are the body and the body subject to the head I mean it's going to be a your the message of the Shepherd's was God has United himself with men I mean because God became man halia deity and humanity became one and that was the message he's been born upon the earth hallelujah he's became flesh I mean there's have been a uniting time between God and men hallelujah and it's the same thing today friends Allu yeah it's the same thing today God it's the same message today there's a uniting time going on but you got to find out where he is in his in his word he's not in where we think man man builds all the big cathedrals and different structures and they have their beautiful music and sound and lights and whatever more oh is that where goddess I say not God is in his word God is in his word first and if that word is in you there that means God it is in you but the word has said it's a living word it's not just remembering things in here it's got to anchor down into here it's going to be quickened down into here Amy because of us quickened down into here nothing can move you nothing can shake you it's not the opinion of your family or your culture or were you raised it's now I'm going to stand on this because there's eternal life in this word hallelujah so God's place of worship is in his manifested word for the day because that's where Jesus is he's not a God of tradition I don't serve God out of tradition I don't serve him out of culture I serve him because he he he called me he drew himself to me I surrendered to me to him rather amen I fully surrendered he changed me he became real to me I mean I trust when you look at the Scriptures he then God spoke to Abraham you chapelle say he spoken to me too maybe not in the death maybe not in the same way but it's word became a living reality maybe he said leave leave this old life leave this old world I'll take you to another place I'll take you to another land hallelujah and you may be still living in the same house you may live and be doing the same job but you've left it lifts your old lives and your old way of doing things I've heard your voice hallelujah you know it's just like the wise men they saw his star in the east and they came to worship Him I made a star as a messenger and they followed that messenger to wake the Christ was hallelujah and a real messenger of God will point you to where he is in this day not just back in history but where he is in this day a neighbor ham lifts and he follow God and he went to his inheritance hallelujah I trust is the same with you remember Christmas is about gifts the world has has made it about gifts now God has given a real gift it doesn't it doesn't wear out it doesn't have a warranty like we would think of warranties if it breaks you know you know there was a brother at home Canada and he made this heat he invented a a system like a so what you can do is it's like a trailer system and it goes on top of your ute and and you push a button and in and then your boat just goes from the you to whatever into the water and back again just just just one man can load and unload a boat and he's getting the pots made in China and they ask him how long do you want the warranty to go forth this is not our kind of God hey yo yo the houseand you want a one year or three years hey you know how long do you want this thing to work for how God isn't like that doesn't have that kind of warranty I mean it's it's it's you regained it to the day of your redemption the redemption of this body hallelujah I mean I'm glad we don't have that kind of warranty amen so now he said he'd put his name remember Jesus spoke to the woman at the well and they begin to talk yo she said Jacob Douglas well and this happened and our Father say ship worship Jerusalem and Jerusalem and all these different things he says no it's coming a change it's coming a change there now he says but the hour cometh and John 4:23 the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him he's seeking such to worship Him in spirit and in truth God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth that that's a requirement you must worship Him in spirit and in truth and ever the truth is not just a collection of man's ideas that have come together like it was with the scribes and the Pharisees and the Herodians that a collection of man's thinking oh this is how it's going to happen and this is how it's going to be and they and they would no doubt say that's the truth but it wasn't the truth that was man's ideas thinking it was the truth the truth is where God says this is my word I've come to back up my word and prove that this is so and it's God declaring this is truth hallelujah not just not just someone's idea I mean it's like I think brother he'd spoke on Wednesday about brother Browns preaching on the Spirit of Truth he and he relates all these hunting testimonies and different things and he comes down to the end of that service he says now he's here the Spirit of Truth is here because to call people out just like Jesus ministry the first time call people out say this is what's wrong with it missus while you're praying for any and so what does God doing he's saying what this man just said is the truth and I've come to back it up and many times it's more than just hunting testimonies it was the word coming I mean the word became open it was preached to us and God comes in behind and say this is truth this is the truth this is my truth that's why I'm backing it up Alleluia so God has placed his name and his son and that's where you have to get into him that is God's provided place of worship hallelujah and we know by one spirit we're baptized into that one body and Peter Peter had the keys to get into that provided place and he preaches on the day of Pentecost says men and brethren what shall we do to be saved this is the people's response because he just says you've crucified the very Messiah that you believed would come and he says repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sin amen and and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children as many as far yeah and those that are far off even diverse places here we are as men as the Lord our God shall call that's how you get into God's provided way it's not our choosing well I'll do it this way this is what tradition teaches me I want to get rid of tradition let's go back to the word I mean because if we take away the tradition it's like Jesus said to the scribes and Pharisees by teaching the commandments and doctrines of men you make the Word of God of Norfolk he says in vain do you worship Me hallelujah and one of the one of the commandments as you shall not take the Lord's name in vain and many times we think that's just people swearing no to take his name in vain is to say I'm a Christian but you serve in Creed's that's what's taking that his name in vain --is amen and Jesus when he came to the earth he didn't do away with the tika moments he magnified them you read Matthew 4 and 5 he says you have heard of all time you shall not commit adultery but I say unto you he that looks upon a woman to lust after has committed adultery already he said you've heard of all time thou shalt not kill but says whosoever looks on his brother's angry with him without a cause has committed murder already he magnifies it because he's a lawgiver he was the lawgiver the cab down on mount sinai he say well that's a that's a more of a grievous weight but you got to understand his grace is greater than the law I mean his mercy and grace is greater than the law hallelujah and he magnified it because he wanted the people to see you can't love these Ten Commandments you can't even keep one of them because you got to fool a nation to begin with I mean you're lost and I'm done to begin with but here I am Here I am driver shadow the law change your nature put myself on you I mean that I will live my word out of you hallelujah that's God's Christmas gift that's God's Christmas gift I'll change you I mean from a fallen creature I mean for a wretched loss undone I mean under the slavery of Satan I'll break that yolk I'll change your nature that when you cannot overcome I will overcome I will come into your flesh and overcome for you that's a good gift I think Allu you glory to God now he say why are you talking about why'd you read about shepherds God doesn't change it's amazing it astounds me you know we just read it oh yes the Shepherd's by night and you know we don't even think man doesn't change man doesn't change God doesn't change either the same people that were back there the same spirits that were back there as upon the people today and we see God was showing himself God was showing himself by where he was born and he was showing himself to the kind of people who would follow him look at who God revealed himself to here they were the most holy place the most holy country in the world you could say there's Jerusalem with the fine temple there's different places but God bypasses all those things he bypasses the high priest he he he bypasses the Bible schools he bypasses the Sanhedrin he bypasses all those places he doesn't even consult them he doesn't even tell them and he comes to some Shepherds some Shepherds on a field outside of Bethlehem and here these Shepherds are now do you think K if it says man is proud and pride keeps a lot of people out of here them pride keeps a lot of people out of here them do you think cave you know I don't know who the high priest was when Jesus was born but this yeah do you think the high priest would come into a stinking manger a manger in those days was just like a it wasn't even a nice like a nice place that we know you see a manger scene it's just like a cave on the side of a hill do you think the high priests in all his great robes stinking animals do you think he would go to that kind of place he wouldn't be identified they would not be identified with that kind of kind of place being here was God God was birthed in this place he was God's lamb he had to be born in a stable he couldn't be born in a palace do you think they would lower themselves they would hold their nose they wouldn't go in do you think about it they wouldn't be identified they were not willing to be identified with him and God knew they wouldn't be identified so he bypassed all of them they couldn't receive the message but those humble shepherds shepherds know about sheep being born shippers know and shepherds in those days are not like shepherds you see in this country with dogs and whistles and whatever more they call this sheep by name they have a relationship with their sheep their sheep know them and they know the Sheep know them and the Shepherd knows the Sheep then you they knew what it was like to see a sheep be born and there knew where sheep would be born and God was showing this is the kind of people we're 2,000 years down the road friends he's come once he's coming again we're gonna meet him in the air but he's already seen his word he's revealed himself in his fullness in the same time amen he's here upon the earth messiahs present hallelujah but you see the people who would be identified with such a one were illiterate I could say Shepherds upon the field that was the category of person that would that would go now how comfortable they would have been in that manger how comfortable I've been in a place of this many times I know how they have ranged I know what a manger as' you know high priests and things I'd say what's a manger what do you go get the servant sindermann that I'm not going in there it would be humiliating their pride would be you know their their their persona would be damaged you see the high priest going into they've made you can he just send a servant that's you're proud you understand what I'm saying that's too proud to go into that card place but the ship would say this is exactly this is I'm used to these kind of conditions I'm used to the smell I'm used to this animal life around me yeah and they went and they found the Messiah and they after they went they declared messiahs upon the earth now what a strange message that would have been if they ran into the synagogue and they begin to declare messiahs here and angels little yo visited us we had a whole heavenly hosts sing the First Noel was sang by heavenly beings to us and messiahs upon the earth and we heard what the angel told us and we found him he'd become manifested in flesh you think I think the synagogue were think that's a bit strange because it didn't come their way I want you to think about this because many times God never comes the way we think he should he never manifests the way we think he should hallelujah and so we have to lay aside our thinking and we have to come with his thinking now how could they and notice a shepherd knows the nature and character of a sheep and they are identified with their sheep now our natures have to be changed to match his nature if the high priest surrender themselves and became like shepherds they would have heard the message and they would have seen where he was born but the nature but a proud arrogant nature is not like a Shepherds nature of sheep's nature and so now our nature has to be changed to match his who wants eternal life you can't just take it how you want it you got to come his way and become like him there's a reason that that God the great creator of heavens and earth became the lost of the law was born in a in a stinking manger I mean because God has trying to tell us now you've got to just consider yourself you're just a manger and sister cherish sang let this let this manger let it be bought in the manger of my heart Amen all we are we think we're so wonderful and we spent so much on these bodies and everything but at the end of the day all we are as a manger but you got to you got to consider yourself as all I am oh god be born in me he's looking for hearts to manifest himself through he's searching the earth where could I find a channel where could I find a yielded vessel to manifest my word that's what he's looking for hallelujah amen and then he came down to Jordan the Lamb of God came down to Jordan and then John points them out and you see the nature and then God the spirit of God descended upon him like a dove know the nature of a dove and the lamb are very similar you go study them they're very similar now a lamb and a dove can have fellowship because they've got the same nature birds of a feather flock together the saying goes but if one was a wolf do you think if do you think John would say here comes the wolf of God to take away the sin of the world do you think God would show himself as a dove coming down a dove can't rest upon a wolf they don't have the same kind of nature but a dove can rest upon a lamb and a dove can lead a lamb hallelujah and this is how we've got to be we got it we can't have our wolf nature that we're born with I mean we've got to want to get rid of it and Lourdes your God has released a power to change our nature amen to this human nature has done away with I mean that we receive his nature because who wants him to abide he abides he abides hallelujah he abides with me it's not just a nice song that's a reality God is not a bunch of thoughts he's a person amen and you got to meet that person hallelujah and so now they could not receive in order to receive the real Lamb of God you have to have his nature and God has to change your nature to match his nature and then he can come and dwell in you because we want to be in his provider place of worship Alleluia we are likened to sheep a sheep forfeits their rights all they do is bear wolf they let around their picked up their Sean you know I think I've seen it a few times when I was young we used to do docking at my friend's farm I was just 10 11 you pick up a lamb they're not they don't struggle all that much when they know you've got them by a good hold they just give up you take them to the offense and the someone else cuts off their tail and does whatever more you know and you put them back down but that's how we've got to be we don't want to kick like a goat against his word we don't want to kick like a goat goat against the world say I'm a lamb I for food oh oh but but I've I've rights yes but if you're a Christian you give up your rights I mean because he's a head remember this is not Christianity is not a with us and God it's not a democracy it's not a democracy Lord the majority says this is more convenient for us and therefore you've got to change it we'll all with yeah we're going to vote the center now we're in government you're in opposition you know that's not how it works it's a supreme monarchy absolute monarchy he's the head we are the body well it's a love relationship it's not a burdensome thing I mean it says in first John his commandments are not Grievous to those who love him I mean so if we love them it's a joy oh Lord I love to live for you I love to reflect your word I love to see you manifest yourself with me and in my conduct how I dress the things I say the places I go everything I do I love it to be it's a joy it's an enjoy a new claim imagine being that manger in Bethlehem yeah you'd have bragging rights to the other Manges hey Jerusalem your fancy stables what are you having you awesome Oh got some thoroughbred horses brought them out of Egypt Lee the finest stallions and this what have you have Emmanuel aloo yeah that trumps at all and I'd rather be a stinking stable that has he Manuel perlier born and me then be some fine fancy looking thing hallelujah with just a bunch of horse flesh or whatever in it amen that's what I want to be and that's how God wants us to be but you've got a got to give yourself over to her many times we we we just live in our little world and we say this is just how it is and we get used to the condition that we're living in we put up with the devil too much we put up with his lies too much we just put all this is just my lot in life and this is how it's meant to be here's some Shepherds on a field I don't know what their names were but just say one was Levi Levi was your daddy a shepherd yes was your great granddaddy of shipit yes your great great great great great great great day yes all Shepherds well I guess this is just my lot son you have to be a shepherd now okay and then he's sitting there on the field at nighttime an angel comes to him his life is about to change very differently hallelujah and then there's a choir of angels and they say he's born they're missing him you'll find them and they found him it life's changed Peter James and John Peter was your dad a fisherman yes was your great-great-great great-great great-granddad a fisherman yes well I guess I'll be a fisherman he's fishing next day he goes fishing it's told me won't go fishing let's repeat the Nets day and day out and then he comes a lamb come and follow me Illya ain't gonna sit well this is just my lord in life and this is what I've got to put up with in this but in the master came and called them and they dropped their fishing nets said we'll follow you hallelujah it's great and it's got to be the same thing with you friend I mean that doesn't matter this is how does and this is in my family I've got this temper in this unforgiveness and this is my parents were like this and this is how I am and all this is just a load in life who says who says I started drinking and smoking whatever at a young age of this is who says I've got this problem I can't overcome who says you got to live with it why was he born as a baby I'm gonna break the yoke he shall save his people from their sins hallelujah and the manifestation of sin is all those things and many more you know we don't have to put up with these things I would not put up with anything for a single moment say this is Christmas I received my gift hallelujah I received eternal life now I want to see the attributes of eternal life manifested in me hallelujah Jesus was eternal life in a man what'd he do He healed the sick he raised the dead he calmed the storms hallelujah you know he did all different kinds of things he wasn't swayed by the culture of his day oh don't go to the synagogue and if you go and hear Jesus or people saying don't go to his meetings if you go to his meetings you'll be cast out you have no fellowship anymore he didn't let those things bother him the disciples clung to him as close as they could we know you're the Messiah we know you're coming into power hallelujah and he just walked the road irrespective he said for this course I've come into the world I am God's provided sacrifice he knew this was the reason and his whole life was steered in there in that direction now here we are I trust you can say I'm a manger he's been his word has been birthed in me now that word has got to manifest hallelujah that when God would say I'm going to have a bride I'm going to have people without spot or wrinkle washed in the blood and Paul would say in Ephesians it's the mystery husband and wife become one flesh as great as the mystery of Christ in His Church they become one they're not two separate people they become one why were you born about in a manger Lord Jesus I want to unite myself with the people I want to become one flesh with them there's nothing between us and me and me and them anymore I want to be so one with them you can't see you can't see the dividing line you can't see the separation line well your small Fiat in humanity just come together hallelujah that's why we've got to be a lamb that that eternal dove can come and rest in us hallelujah and so now if that's the case this is what he wants to see then let us say Lord I want to see that manifest in me I mean there's a promise we have a promise in this hour I mean we were promised that we and would become one in that day you shall know that I'm in the father the father and me iron you and you and me jesus said and that's just not just nice words don't take please don't take the scripture whatever you do don't take the scripts you just put it on your fridge and say that's a nice promise it makes me feel nice it should go well beyond that as you say Lord this is my promise you've given me you've wrapped it up you've delivered it to me my name's on it I've opened up I've opened up the present hallelujah I'm trying to yeah like a child you give I want this on what you know they want something ever wish list have you ever seen a little child just unwrapped a gift put it back down the one thing they've wanted all year have you ever seen them just unwrap it put it back down and say thanks dad thanks mom I love you and just leave it there have you ever seen a child do that I have never seen a child do that but a lot of Christians are like that they'll unwrap the gift isn't that lovely and they'll just leave it there don't just unwrap the gift become one with the gift become one with that gift yeah it's like you get a new bike or something you want to try it out how high can I jump how good are the brakes I want to go down that hill you know you want to test out the thing to its to its ability do you know to or anything you've got you want to test the thing out it should be the same thing with us and our Lord Lord I want to see it manifested I want to see this gift become alive with me and every way piece of possible understanding we don't have to put up with nervousness friends where had to put up with frustrations and doubts I mean here's our piece we has protein down every wall hallelujah this this high paced life that we live in I mean we don't need to worry about it and it has to be that way but when it doesn't mean we have to say well this is just my portion in life I mean I don't need to go live in the third world to watch the world go by and just relax and you know I can bear perfect peace doesn't matter how busy my day is I'm in jehova sholom it's prison and me I mean to harvest peace hallelujah that's how it should be we've got a gift friends I would taste it out what does it do can it set me free from my habits and things okay yes I want to see that happen I'm ain't gonna take this temper away yes it can you make my indifference yes here take my hand huh yes Oh to see it all come away hallelujah does it give me joy unspeakable yes does it isn't my satisfying portion yes as a my joys of my everything yes I want to see it become that way don't just put him on the Shelf he's not some statue you put on the Shelf don't diminish our God to some statue that you put on the Shelf some mascot or Boy Scout or or whatever thing errand boy he's a Lord God Almighty and here he came in a manger he's not an immediate evil he's here today I'm going to close with this but he's here today friends when you just open the manger of your heart say Lord I may not be a big fancy place I may not be some great big praise of Jerusalem or one of the great cities of refuge or whatever it may be in the Bible but I'm the least how their Bethlehem was the least of the place as it says in the scripture and he came to the least of the places I mean I just think he mentioned mentioned being the innkeeper he comes Mary and Joseph do we have it do you have a place for me just through I don't know how thick the tissue is between the baby and the outside world you know the mother's tummy is Emmanuel being carried by a woman he's the one that can really help the sudden keeper because God reveals himself in simplicity here was Almighty God was gonna be boy birth and here's the innkeeper now I don't have any room for you but I do ever I do have a stable now if that man had a revelation he would have given his place I'll go sleep in the stable you take the best place hallelujah the Eternity he totally missed it because it wasn't coming according to what he thought this is basically him this is the season for his birth tick tick tick it comes a little woman that's why God God manifests himself but it goes way over the heads of many people does it happen so simple it doesn't come their way so what if you do even just now say Lord I want to be a manger they didn't clean out the stable they didn't sweep it out he just went in and he was born don't worry about let him change you you got to be yielded I mean don't just put up with don't but don't don't put up with a devil anymore this is the time of freedom this is the time of total Jubilee at Liberty we don't have to put up with Satan and put up with his workings don't live below your privilege open up the manger of your heart say Lord I surrender everything and I really mean it I mean business with you I don't want to continue the way I am doesn't matter how old or young you are I don't want to I wanted you to be born in me I want you to be manifested you're the Lamb of God you were turned out of every place but you will not be turned out of here that's how it should be hallelujah quit some musicians to come we have them to come please amen that's how it should be lord I want you to be welcome I don't want to have an unwelcome Christ I want him to be welcome hallelujah let's just stand shall we if anyone would like be remembered in prayer you say this is Christmas time he's here to set us free you know raise your hands to him if you
