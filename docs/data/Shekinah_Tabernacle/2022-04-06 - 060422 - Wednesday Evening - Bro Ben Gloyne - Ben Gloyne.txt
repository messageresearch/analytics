mighty hand amen let's go to the scripture tonight i just want to read uh psalms 48 and then we're going to go to hebrews chapter seven yeah there's a few with covert as as we know but you know our god is is greater amen by his stripes were healed i mean nothing's out of cater amen he's in control of everything praise the lord amen so we can just rest and rejoice in him so psalms 48 we're going to read the whole psalm i'm going to read from verse one here it says a song in psalm for the sons of korah great is the lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our god in the mountain of his holiness beautiful for situation the joy of the whole earth is mount zion on the sides of the north the city of the great king god is known in her palaces for a refuge now when we talk about zion he's talking about you it's not just a great geographical location it's a it's the bride of christ so god is known in her palaces for a refuge you know him as a refuge tonight i mean for lo the kings were assembled they passed by together they saw it and so they marveled they were troubled and hasted away amen fair took hold upon them there in pain as of a woman in travail thou breakest the ships of tarshish with an east wind as we have heard so have we seen in the city the lord of hosts and the city of our god god will establish it forever sealer notice god's doing the establishing it's not you doing the establishing god does the establishing praise the lord we have thought of thy loving kindness oh god in the midst of thy temple according to thy name o god as is thy praise unto the ends of the earth thy right hand is full of righteousness let mount zion rejoice let the daughters of judah be glad because of thy judgments walk about zion go about about her tell the towers thereof mark well marky well her ball works consider her palaces that ye may tell it to the generation following for this god is our god i like that amen for this god is our god forever and ever he will be our guide even unto death praise be the lord now we're going to hebrews chapter 7 from verse 19. um amen it's good being a christian hey praise the lord you know it doesn't matter you can be in the darkest moment of your entire life but there's one in the fire with you praise the lord he's never lost a battle he's never failed he never stresses he's in control amen and he's there forging a character in you which is more precious than gold which is his own character so oh hebrews 7 and 19 he says for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw an i unto god as in so much as without an oath he was made a priest for whose for those priests were made without an oath but this uh but this with an oath by him that said unto him the lord swear and will will not repent thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedek by so much was jesus made a surety for a better testament as they truly were many priests because they were they were not suffered to continue by reason of death but this man i like those words but this man praise the lord because he continueth forever has an unchangeable priesthood wherefore he is able also to save them to the other most which come unto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make us intercession for them i think we should just shout around the building right now he's talking about what god has done for us i mean what the lord has done for as much as a high priest became us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens who needeth not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the peoples for this he died once when he offered up himself for the law maketh men high priests which which have infirmit um infirmity but the word of the oath which was since the law maketh the son who is consecrated forevermore amen praise the lord amen let's bow he's in a word of prayer tonight i mean if you ever need you just want to lift lift to the lord our god's mindful amen don't lose hope amen let's just let's just draw near to the lord tonight lord jesus we're so thankful we can draw nigh unto thee with such a such a faith lord such a hope in our hearts knowing that you are the god of gods besides there is none other you're the alpha and omega you made all things lord jesus and i want to thank you lord you're mindful of every situation we're in lord you're mindful of the battle and the trial that we're going through and i want to thank you lord you're here to reveal yourself in every trial lord to show yourself mighty in every battle lord what whatever we're going through lord i want to thank you we can look unto thee because our help cometh from you my god and father we thank you we can read your word tonight we can assemble in this fashion father i pray you bless each one who's gathered here father those who couldn't come because of sickness or covert or whatever the reason may be lord i pray you'd step into their lounge wherever they are right now oh god may you supercharge the atmosphere with a lord with your faith o god with your anointing lord now pray you touch each life dear lord jesus i ask father you take your word quicken it to our hearts and lord i pray father that hearts would be mended lord burdens would be lifted troubles would vanish oh god i pray that your true perspective would come father into every situation that you are god alone and you're in control and we can just rest in you we thank you lord pray your blessings upon the word father in this evening lord in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats tonight i want to just take that i love that i read it uh uh last week just those three words just made me rejoice but this man amen hallelujah our god is not an ordinary man praise the lord you know this man you know it's amazing i love i love the book of hebrews how the apostle paul makes such a contrast between the old testament law and this new and living way in which we are enjoying right now by the blood of jesus christ now if you think about you think about our lord jesus what a masterpiece of a man he was i mean there's no one like him upon the earth no one can stand in his shadow amen the prophets couldn't stand there no one no one can be like him there's no one there's no one like our jesus he's our jesus i mean he's our god amen and i'm so thankful that he's not just a god of history but he's the god of the present amen he's the same yesterday today and forever now we read there in in um in psalms here that it would say in the last uh verse 13 it says um you know consider her palaces you know her towers and so on that you may tell it to the generation following so there's a reason for that because you know um bulwarks and towers speak of a defense amen a palace speaks of a dwelling place and so we need to tell these things to a future generation you know the future generation must know that the lord jesus christ is supreme i mean he is supreme deity he's not part of the godhead he is the godhead i mean the fullness of god here body dwelt in the man the lord jesus christ and he is supreme deity there's not three gods or two there's one praise the lord now i'm so thankful our god is so great he become the last of the lord i remember standing in the poorest province of papua new guinea chimbu province and i was telling the people you know the lord jesus was homeless he didn't have a place to lay his head you know he says foxes have dens birds of nest but the son of man has no place to lay like leia said head and and they were so impacted by that here were people we would look at them and say they have nothing but they realized the lord became lower than them he became poorer than them amen and it's so just you know you so appreciate god what god the prophet says what god make what what makes god so great is that he can become so little amen praise the lord but but this man was a different kind of man he he looked like a common kind of man he looked like everyone else but he wasn't like everyone else i mean within his veins was the purchasing power of the whole world aiming to redeem adam's fallen race back to its rightful position amen within him was was the resurrection he is the resurrection in the life wasn't just part of a resurrection but he is the resurrection you know the prophet would tell us that that if he did not call lazarus by name when he stood before his two men said lazarus come forth there would have been a general resurrection because he is the resurrection in the life i mean all power is in his hands all power in heaven and earth is placed in his hands i mean there's no one beside him his enemies being defeated amen there's no one can withstand him he is the almighty god he sees through every situation there's no way you can lie to him you can hide nothing from him he sees through everything because the word of god is a discerner of the thoughts and things of the heart he has never been defeated he's never been conquered he's never fought to a draw he's never fought to a stalemate he's been victorious in every situation whether it was in a fiery furnace or in the flood or in a lion stand or in a prison wherever it was in a red sea around jericho god our god was victorious amen here's the alfred omega he is the almighty he's not just mighty he's the almighty amen he's the supreme one amen he's alpha and omega the beginning in the end his name is wonderful he's a counselor the prince of peace the mighty god amen he is the very lord of glory and he's our god this man but this man i mean but this man made a new and living way hallelujah he didn't just just reinstitute a priesthood of bloods of bulls and goats and just continuing on of perpetuating cycles of of life and death and sin and so ever more no no he came to break the cycle he came to break the cycle of sin amen we know the blood of bulls and goats could never ever take the desire for sin out of a person could never do it no matter how devout the person was house and see the person was it could never do it yeah i mean even you know even great men like david he said i uh you know i set the word of god ever before my face i was sitting out against him but then when he looked out of his window one day he saw bathsheba that all went to one side his carnal desires rose up and he took him we know the rest of the story even that man with his great desire that sin nature could be never taken away from by the blood of bulls and goats but this man i mean but this man he didn't just bring a lamb or a goat no no he was the lamb he was the lamb of god as john would say that taketh away the sin of the world hallelujah so he he didn't just cover up sin but he changed the nature of the of the believer i mean to take sins desire out of them praise the lord this man but this man remember remember the the the message of the hour unleashes the full power of the blood upon a people what's the full power of the blood we're going to be alive and remain and be changed hallelujah our bodies are going to be changed i mean so it's going to and you know it has brought the full power of calvary into manifestation hallelujah where once people would would would aim at becoming you know so like the apostle paul said in the book of ephesians he says you have believed you trusted and you're sealed to the day of your redemption but then come down to chapter four he says now he says now we must grow he says that you know he sent the five-fold ministry until we all come to the statue of the fullness of christ right so he said and he says now so so they were aiming at that they were believers in the kingdom but they are aiming at growing into the fullness of the statue of christ but we know that the word ephesus means aimed at and relaxed but aim at but to relax so they aimed at it but because the anointing on the age was actually they that that church had to go eventually down to the dark ages died and come forth in a reformation or restoration they could aim it but they couldn't become right but in this age the cycle is broken i mean we're not here just to aim at become the fullness of the statue of christ no we're here to step into it i mean that's why the word the message is released to power in this day i mean that would manifest i mean that promise in you and i's life i mean that's why there's power in the seven thunders which is the revelation of the seven seals because there's a power withheld within god but it's it's always released in his word and those those thunders were held up john was about to write it it was going to be released but god said seal it up until the time of the end when knowledge shall run to and fro of knowledge shall your people shall travel to and from knowledge shall increase that's from daniel chapter 12. because we know within god's word when he releases a word he releases a power right so under the power of the law under the blood of bulls and goats i mean it gave josh your power to take his mountain it gave i mean caleb to take his mountain it gave josh your power i mean to make the sun and the moon stand still it gave israel power that they would take their promised land it gave them power it gave david power that he had killed the lion he'd killed the bear who killed goliath and that came against him it gave them power to destroy their enemy i mean it gave gideon and the 300 power to destroy that whole host of the midianites it gave them power to do it but it did not under the in that word was not a power to change sin nature right but jesus when he would take the um the last supper he he would hold up the cup he says this is the new testament in my blood i mean so now there was a paranormal word because the new testament's in my blood we read it it's an it's an incan you know paper form but it was in him but it had to be released right so now there was a power within him that could not be released until he went to calvary to purchase it praise the lord because remember in god there's all power right he's not limited in power he's unlimited in power right but but he releases his power in certain seasons to achieve a certain goal and in this age it's rapture hallelujah remember he doesn't have to purchase the rapture he's already purchased it but he's got to release the fullness of the holy ghost upon the people i mean to break a cycle of of life and death that will step from this world to the next world this man but this man amen he's done it all for us hallelujah amen i like the i love the story of arnold von winkler i love it very much it always always moves me where where back in the uh early swiss confederacy days you know the austrians invaded and and you know they weren't they weren't a trained army like the austrians they were just farmers but then but then you know they they rallied together and they were going to try and fight the austrians and and in reality they didn't have the ability to to to beat them and then a little man called arnold von winkler stood up maybe he was a little man because maybe he was a little man but anyway he stood up and and and and they would ask him what are you going to do tomorrow he says today tomorrow i'm going to die for switzerland and they will move by what he's going to say says over in the other valley there's my family there's my wife and my children and i'm going to i'm going to never see them again i'm going to give my life and i said what are you going to do he says i'm going to just follow me and fight with what you got and just and just him saying that so so so rallied the swiss amen where he found the thickest part of the austrian spears and him and he needed to scream make way for liberty make way for liberty anything that god in his way had to get out of the way i mean but he made a path through those spears where he grabbed them the prophet tells us the you know the story tells us that he pulled them into his into his chest and it made a gap in the formation the austrians and the swiss just plowed in there broke their ranks and they won the day i mean that was a great that was a great that was a great achievement that was a great feat of heroism i mean but this man i mean but this man found the thickest wall of the spares of death amen of hell he says make way for liberty amen god god knew that adam's fallen race was against the wall amen we couldn't keep the ceremonies we couldn't keep the offerings we couldn't keep the law we couldn't do it it doesn't matter how devout how sincere we could never keep it i mean it's a he so it's a one step from the portals of glory his name is jesus i mean he stepped down he says i'm going to redeem adam's fallen race amen he found where the death where the stinger of death was amen and he attracted that buzzy bee it was buzzing around it stung moses he died i mean it stung a lot you know you're staying elisha stung all the prophets down through apart from you know elijah and different ones but you know everyone had to taste death because because the stinger of death would sting into someone and then the stinger would come out but this man was made of different stuff i mean this man was the one who could rip the stinger out hallelujah so he's buzzing around calvary amen and just in my little mind i just see the you know bee of death you know come and put a stinger in then an unseen hand comes and grabs it says this is mine now hallelujah and then and then and then he tries to pull it and he just rips it out of himself you know i mean but but our lord jesus still got that stinger of death that's why jesus and that's why paul could say death whereas i sting brave where is thy victory but thanks be to god who gives us the victory amen hallelujah amen sorry our lord jesus raised up he plunged himself into the darkest myths of what man ever feared which was death and he conquered it then he ascended on high amen he never sent down a declaration of theological faith he sent back the holy spirit said take this and fight with everything that you got within you take this and follow me pardon me as the father has sent me so send are you and the father sent him went with him and went in him and when he sent us he comes with us he's in us men and women what we need today is not our names on a church book which is perfectly all right but we need to pick up that powerful weapon of the holy spirit in our heart which changes our innermost being and makes us new creatures in christ jesus and wipes the way through the sinful world by the righteousness and power of the resurrection of jesus christ that's what we need that's what the church needs not a face lifting or a bunch of new members but revive what we've got and fill with the holy ghost and set out to fight the enemy to pray for the sick heal the sick cast out devils freely you receive freely give these signs shall follow them that believe christ put into the heart of man into the hand of man the strongest weapon that was ever put to human beings was the baptism of the holy spirit a new heart a new spirit and i'll put my spirit in there and win and then fight with what's in you until death shall set you free that's brother brown and the impersonation of of of christianity amen our lord jesus didn't just give us something to debate about this message is not something just to argue about this message is is to be lived i mean where god would put on flesh and a people and every promise he's given to the bride will be manifested in her amen our lord as i said in the beginning what made god so great is as he he became so little and brother brown would give a story in the in the message the mighty god are available for us he says you know he was reading a story some years ago and it was or some great noble king and you know his princes loved him his guards loved him all these different things but one day he made a decision because he was a great lover of his subjects and and and he called us gathers royalty into his throne room he says today you see me as king for the last time for many years and they're very troubled they say good king why would you say that you know you're going to a foreign country or are you going to become an alien somewhere he says no i'm going to stay right here i'm going to go out among my subjects i'm going to become a peasant i'm going to cut wood with the wood chopper i'm going to till the ground with the toilet i'm going to prune the vines with those who prune the vines i'm going to be one of them in order to be better acquainted with what they're doing and i love them and i want to be more acquainted with them personally they they won't know me but yet i want to be acquainted with them in that way and the next morning you know he he took off his crown his great robes put on peasant robes and he went down amongst the common people and brother brahm says now in that little story we find out then about god where because he became so great by becoming so little i mean that he put on humanity that he would understand the frailty of humanity he would understand when we're troubled he would understand our burdens he'd understand what it's like to be sick he'd understand what it's like to lose loved ones he would understand everything we go through and he did it that you would know he understands every trial every hardship every question every what seems to be unanswered prayer he understands it amen he was acquainted with grief he bore our sorrows praise the lord he knows everything about us amen we may think he may not understand but he understands he knows what it's like to be sick he knows what it's like to be troubled he knows what it's like to be vexed amen he he understands it remember he was so if i could say that word vex there in the garden of eden it was like blood blood dripped from him he's so troubled but he made that great decision to me i think well i couldn't find the quote but brother brown said somewhere that was the masterpiece in the garden in another garden the garden of gethsemane where he became such a masterpiece that he said not my will but thy will be done amen amen so he understands what we go through he understands our troubles he understands amen because he became one of us praise the lord are you glad you ever you serve a god that understands he's not somewhere somewhere distant in heaven somewhere and he's trying to put himself in your shoes he's been in our shoes praise the lord amen now i said in the beginning that we have to tell the next the future generations about zion's towers and their bull works and different inner palaces because we've got to understand that every generation will fight the same enemy that enemy may be rebranded just like you take spark used to be telecom same company different branding they still are in telecommunications maybe the phones aren't dumb anymore but it's still phones it's still connecting people so it's like the devil it's actually the same deal but he just rebrands himself every generation you take the spirit of rock and roll in the beatles it's now evolved to i don't know who's trending right now that person right so it's gone from the rolling stones and the beatles different ones and they just evolved the same spirit just rebranded amen just like you know peer pressure that spirit is just rebranded now it's on social media now it's on the internet people have virtual lives so they can't just escape from even peer pressure you know there's there's you know there's virtual bullying and so on online bullying what's that peer pressure same devil just rebranded a little bit so it's the same devil that every generation fights now the next generation may think that the older generation doesn't understand what it's going through now brother ram said that actually the world gets 10 times worse he would say i think it's a blushing prophet i might be wrong about the sermon but he says you know the world is 10 times worse now for your children than when we were young it's the same devil but he's just he's just if i can say i can't say bigger because he doesn't get bigger but you know it just it just gets more stronger in a way but remember god is way stronger than every enemy but i think what happens is as the younger generation doesn't unders thinks we don't understand what they go through but we can say no that devil just got rebranded we fought it when it was uh telecom not the talent but i'm just using that example okay you know now it's sparked but you know it's the same thing it doesn't maybe the technology's changed its face may be different from a brick phone to a smartphone but it's still a phone if you know what i mean so so it may look different but the spirit behind it's the same and so every generation uh fights the same enemies but the thing is if we can realize actually the enemy they like my children the spirits they are fighting i fought they've just rebranded themselves and vice versa because i think if we can if we can relate or think actually my parents actually would understand what i'm going through then then there's not a cut in communication right or saying i have a need or this you know so that's it but it says in judges maybe you want to put this up brother andy or whoever's quick on the trigger back there uh judges three and one and we'll read down to verse four because there's a reason why because you know you think sometimes joshua goes takes the land you think why there why are there these enemies still in the land he says now these are the nations which the lord left now there's a reason why god allows things to be there to prove israel by them for as many of israel as had not known all the wars of canaan so there was a generation after the wars of canaan that didn't know war for example they were not alive or even adults when caleb took his mountain but maybe they just born there maybe they just came later after the battle was done with the you know with their mothers they and and they just inhabited it so they weren't actually part of the fight right they were not part of that fight they were the next generation coming but every generation had to know what it was like to fight a war now only the generations so we're in verse 2 now there we are only that the generations of the children of israel might know to teach them war at the least such as before knew nothing thereof so the lord left these ones in the land that the next generations would know how to fight amen because every generation we're soldiers we're not peacekeepers we're soldiers amen so so the enemy is allowed to come against us or come against our children that they would know how to fight but we need to teach them to war right remember we are not here just to you know put people out on the battlefield they have no training you know you've never ever seen an army in your right mind send them into battle with no training they don't know how to use their equipment they don't know how to communicate they don't know what they're capable of they don't know how to fight as a unit and different things you'd never do that you you're setting them up to fail we don't want to set our children up to fail right we want to equip them with the best amen with the very best equipment amen that they would know what it does they know what they're capable of amen amen to teach them war at the least as such as before knew nothing thereof namely the five lords of the philistines uh where yeah thank you there um and and all the canaanites and the sidonians and the highways that dwell in mount lebanon from mount baal hermann um unto the entering inn of hamath and they were to prove israel by them to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the lord which he had commanded their fathers by the hand of moses so an enemy comes in to test you will you hearken will you lean upon the word and trust it trust him or we try and fight another way amen so you know we want to be such that you know the word is our standing orders right that we become so one with the word that actually what you read in the you know this is like a battlefield manual we know it's a love letter but it's many things this is the battlefield manual we become such soldiers that we embody this right that our training everything that we you know it just becomes flesh amen that we would know when the enemy comes against us we know how to deal with them we know what our equipment does this is why zion was told tell the future generations about your towers and your palaces your bulwarks your your your fortifications the palace is where the king dwells tell the future generations about this because they need to know i mean because remember we are not here defenseless we're not here hopeless we're not here just just scraping in by the skin of our teeth no no we're overcomers i mean but in order to be an overcomer you've got to overcome something amen an overcomer remember an army on the parade ground that's never been tested is not victorious it's not invincible maybe on paper it's invincible but it's after the army goes through a campaign or they go through a war maybe they lose some battles but they come out packing the victory amen remember we are the bride as an invincible army but in order to be invincible there's got to be some fights there's got to be some skirmishes there's going to be some close run battles amen but i believe by our god we'll win everyone hallelujah that it remembers not that him that wins the war it's him that no so it's not him that wins the battle counts or or or rights history or is the victor it's him that wins the war or her that wins the war amen you can look in world war ii the allies back was against the wall but they didn't they didn't lose they won amen sometimes our backs will be against the wall how we gonna how we're gonna overcome this lord help us i'm in dire straits but remember god knows tomorrow amen and it's not remember your current state is not your final destination i mean that is not your fix this is just how it's going to be you know winston churchill was built such a way he knew that the wall was you know they were in great trouble they had nothing to fight the enemy with he you know secretly a tellers cabinet you know where muzzle that's just paraphrasing but he basically said you know we might as well just drink all the whiskey throw the bottles at them they had nothing to fight when they when they evacuated the troops from dunkirk that you know all those things they lost all their heavy equipment there they had nothing to fight the only way reason that england stood is because of the channel that was the only reason but but publicly he never said those things he said we'll fight them on the beaches we'll fight them and the hedgerows will never surrender one of his most famous famous speeches i think yeah you can find it on the internet he would tell i think it was a school he just stood there maybe maybe the school was under expectation of some great oratory of some great motivational speech he just said never give up never give up amen never give up amen that's all he said that was a speech sometimes it's just the simple things that really matter i'll say never give up keep fighting never give up this is not the end amen this is not the end amen the devil doesn't know the end our god knows the end amen remember our god said that my thoughts are towards you of peace that you'll come to an expected end remember he said his thoughts not his opinion not that god has an opinion but his thoughts are before the foundation of the world i saw you on streets of gold being an overcomer rejoicing in the victory that i won for you that down calvary and then rejoicing in the victory that you had going through later sia i mean that's what he thought about you that you'd come to an expected end i mean that expected end is not the lake of fire it's not the great tribulation it's a rapture amen it is it is going to a wedding supper that's your expected end hallelujah that's why i say never give up amen this memo wherever you are right now this is not the end of the battle this is not the end of the war you may be oh how's this ever going to happen no you're not at the end of the war i mean the war is not finished amen hallelujah hallelujah amen there's been a lot of dire straits you know in history of warfare i remember it says it's really rally it's not the um you know it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight in the dog i remember brother martin topping christchurch he told me once upon a time he had this little corgi and that thing would take on anything that just had one move jump jugular rip that was it anyway but but corgis aren't big it would take on anything it wasn't afraid of nothing you know we may look little but it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight in the dog and you when you realize that the dog in the fight and you as the lord jesus christ amen where where he overcame hell death the grave culture prejudice you know bad reputation people put on being illegitimately born and you know he he overcame superstition he overcame unbelief he overcame trouble amen he overcame satan himself he overcame all things that same one is in you that same one is in you if he has overcome you've got to recognize that and you've got to recognize the one in you has already overcome that spirit that you're fighting amen now that's really overcoming the prophet would tell us hallelujah amen so we live in this great hour without god but this man our lord jesus himself we don't follow a prophet we follow god we follow jesus christ the word amen amen we are following the supreme one he never lost a battle i want to i just want to remind you of these things our god is supreme amen he has never gone into a fight and come out licking his wounds hallelujah he is victorious in everything now the weapons we have are the greatest weapons even now the um australians are you know signed a pact with the uk and and and america about developing hypersonic missiles because they try because there's an arms race going on people looking for a competitive edge they're looking for something that they can tilt the balance in their favor we have that we have what we need to tilt the balance in our favor and the thing is this ain't an arms race because the devil can't produce a weapon that can beat you there's nothing he can do that can defeat the word of god there's no weapon he can remember no weapon formed against he shall prosper it says in isaiah no weapon amen so he may fashion a lot of weapons thinking this thing will give me the competitive edge in the fight but it won't prosper that's what the word says i mean you've got to realize the thing that you're facing you'll say satan my god told me no weapon formed against me shall prosper you may form weapons but you're just wasting your time and you're just going to walk out disappointed i mean you think it may get me but it can't get me because nowhere performed against me shall prosper amen it says and i in isaiah remember it's important to take those kind of promises and realize that there's no weapon formed against the shall prosper hallelujah amen now our armor is supernatural it's not natural there's nothing natural about you we're all supernatural the bride is a supernatural people amen even even putting on the whole armor of god it's not saying a prayer of now put on the helmet of salvation and the good about the loins with truth and different things no it's the baptism of the holy ghost that's what the that's what the whole armor is brother ram says and take on the whole armor of god think i act funny maybe i am but i've lost my mind to the world and found it in christ let the mind that was in christ bearing you takes the baptism of the holy ghost the whole armor of god not just to shake hands with the preacher put your name on a book or take some kosher and swallow it and the priest drink up the wine that isn't it but brother stay there until there comes a rushing mighty wind that fills all your being takes all your doubts out takes all your creature out takes everything else out and puts the word in there with the power of god behind it to back it up gloria i feel real good amen god said so it's the holy ghost hallelujah amen now brother brahms asked a question this is in 1964. question is the answer is number one he says dear brother branham do you believe that signs shall follow all the all that have the holy ghost he says jesus said so mark 16. the question continues if so what about the people who believe the message with all that's in them yet they not have these signs are they unbelievers or do they need the holy spirit if so please instruct us today how to receive the holy ghost we believe you are god's mouthpiece for our day your brother he says thank you my brother for regarding me as your brother and i think that's a very good question friends yes it is a little slack i'd like to deal a little longer on that if i could see it is slack look some of you when you cannot receive the baptism of the holy ghost without having experience when it happens now if you believe every speck of the word you say you believe every speck of it then the word is laying in there waiting for the holy ghost to put it to work but it takes the lighting of the candle this is so fundamental it takes the lighting of the candle here's the candle with the wick in it and with all the tallow and everything it has to have in that candle but until the fire comes on it it will not shine any light no matter how perfect the candle is and how perfect it will burn and everything it's got to be litten and when it burns and when you believe and are made up of the instructions of what the holy spirit is love joy peace long suffering goodness the fruits of it bears out until the holy spirit with a fiery experience comes down and lights that candle then you haven't received the holy ghosty you've got to have the experience to have the holy ghost so it's not something we just grow into you've got to really meet god you can be the perfect candle there is you can quote every scripture every every part of the message but there needs a lighting of the candle amen but if your candle's been lit whose candle's been lit amen in the holy ghost is in power manifesting in your life now i don't know what kind of experience you'll have but you'll know you've met god i mean you'll know you've met him some you know some way can be manifested in different ways but there'll be a difference in your life i mean when now now you actually have the armor of god on the inside the baptism of the holy ghost now you can go out in power and realize nothing can stand before you amen if you stay fully surrendered to god remember the prophet said that a man can be so surrendered to god that even the devil doesn't know what to do with him amen i sent this sickness i sent this trouble against him i sent this trouble this problem and their family this without the family this and the church this and his job you know and then the devil comes back and says i just i don't know what to do with this guy he just he just stays surrendered to the lord he doesn't rise up in his carnality he just continues on what can i do with them amen we can live that kind of life we can live that kind of life amen remember remember a lamb or a sheep amen forfeits all its rights amen it doesn't kick it just it just shaved me off lord amen for your glory hallelujah so now friends every generation must know how to fight but uh i'm telling you this we have the equipment this word this whole armor of god we have it this is not something we're looking for we have the best weapons we've won the arms race remember if you fully strengthen the lord the lord changes your life you've won the game of life amen now it's just growing in maturity growing in character until the lord takes you home hallelujah but we need to tell our children we need to tell each other how good god is how great this tower is that we can run into in a safe the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous run into in a safe who's ever run into that tower i mean you've been distressed on every hand but then you turn to the lord and say lord i must be hid away in you amen you find yourself feeling you may still be in the trial but there's just a peace comes in amen you run into that tower and you're safe you say oh lord how great you are as a city of refuge hallelujah amen then you can say how great his palaces are amen where he steps in when he stepped into your life it's important that we rehearse these things to one another to our children when god became real where they can see it's more than more than rules and regulations more than just abiding by a creed not that we believe in creatures some people could just so line up with the word but there's no life in there right we don't want to be that kind of thing but they've got to see a love they've got to see a reality they've got to see a life i love the lord this is not a dreary life this is not a burden this is a joy this is such a great joy i'm so glad the lord found me amen i'm so glad that he met me save me i know what amazing grace is it became amazing amen when he met me hallelujah amen it is a joy to serve the lord amen burdens now a lighter brighter is my way it is such a joy to walk with him isn't it so good you can be in the worst part of your life you say lord i'm with you hallelujah and it's not you holding his hand he's holding your hand i've got you i've got you in this trouble i've got you in the what does it oh it's real dark in here don't worry he's right there just like brother brown would say uh um it's an um there's a man standing prison that can turn on the light now i remember going there in cape town there's the fort of good hope it's the starfall there in cape town and we went on a tour i was six or seven and we went down to this into this dungeon and the guy turned off the light it's pitch black and they said there were prisoners in here hundreds of years ago whenever and they and they lost their sight they're in there so long it was it was it was you could feel the blackness it was so dark never been in such a dark place and brother bam said like there's a place like that and there was a family there and then you know the tour guide turned off the light and the little sister just started screaming but the brother said don't worry sis there's a man standing present that can turn on the light so you don't need to worry don't don't worry how dark it gets there's a man standing present this man but this man who's the same yesterday today and forever but this man who said i'll never leave him or forsake thee but this man that says i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world he's standing present he can turn on the light hallelujah aren't you glad he's our guide he's our refuge he's our source of strength when we come to the end of ourselves that's when he steps in you say lord i can't take another step further he says that's fine i'm carrying you anyway hallelujah i'll bear you up on eagle's wings amen hallelujah so it's very vital that we know how to fight and we teach our children to fight well how do we fight the battles won in prayer amen the battle's won in a surrendered life how did jesus won the victory on calvary he surrendered his life in gethsemane the victory was all it was all done and dusted in gethsemane they said not my will but thy will be done amen there's victory in praise there's victory in worship hallelujah amen is victory in love and joy so we need to teach and i'm not saying this because i don't believe you're not doing these things but it's worth it yes you know brother bam says about like uh people drafted into the army you know the sergeant major screaming at them from before dawn till after dusk and running them through drills and they you know got these big packs on their back and they're going you know on their on their chest commander crawling under you know barbed wire and these and and these machine guns that are trained to fire above their heads live rounds and you know no doubt there's times when those those recruits are just they hate the sergeant major they hate them with everything with them that's probably the motivation they get through basic training they hate him but then when they get on the battlefield they thank that sergeant major for all the shouting for all the drills for all the equipment they had to carry maybe when they're in basic training i carry these big packs and would i have to carry this shovel and why i've got to carry this helmet in these rations and there's extra ammunition in these grenades and then they find out when they're in the battle thank god i got the shovel i can dig myself a foxhole thank god i've got a grenade i can throw it at the enemy or these rations when i'm out on the field or you know and they begin to thank god for their sergeant major hallelujah you know because you might never know they might never know when they'd have to use that shovel but when they need it they have it in hand you may never know when you've got to use a particular scripture or a particular quote i mean you think why is this guy shout at us all the time and you know make us go through all these drills and carry on but there'll come a time when the devil comes against you on the battlefield and you'll say thank god amen thank god i heard that message thank god i heard the prophet preach on the called out ones or you know yeah this day the scripture is fulfilled thank god i had that memory verse put on my heart thank god i read the bible that that that one scripture who's ever had that the devil comes against you in your mind and then one scripture breaks the whole thing hallelujah and you say thank god maybe you can't even remember where you heard it but you heard it somewhere hello and it means the world in that one moment because that one scripture can break the enemy's attack hallelujah so we're in a battle i'm just gonna i'm just gonna quit right here we're in a battle but our lord jesus is our seventh star general and he is leading us through you don't need to worry you know brother ram says do you know how um if you want to see the supernatural you know what he says relax don't get all tense relax remember this is victory is won by rest resting in the lord that doesn't mean you're going sitting under a coconut tree and watching the world go by that's not that kind but resting knowing he's in control where we can actually say lord you've got this has he seen you through some scrapes before has he quit has he come to a point where it says well ladies too dark i guess i'm just going to let them go on through no no he leads his sheep he leads us he is not like a shepherd here i remember when i you know when i was growing up i spent time my friends in gisborne they had farms and then my uncle had a big station uh inland between gisborne and wairoa and there and me and my brother i don't know what age you were 10 younger than that you know we had a we had a quad bike and we had to herd like 500 sheep down the road and put them in a paddock we had great fun it was awesome but you know he's not that kind of shepherd who's sitting in a bug and room you know trying to scare them and startle the sheep to go forth no he doesn't he doesn't scare us into glory that's not our god he leads us he calls us by name and something in us just says yes lord i come hallelujah and then he leads us through he said i'm going through a horrible time he's leading you through amen but he now in the history of of believers i've never seen him drop someone in a trial he takes them through amen so i think we can rejoice tonight you say i don't know if this gun works remember the devil if he can think his weapons equivalent to yours he's got you don't doubt your weapon the word of god it'll this remember brother brown says end time message meets end time conditions always this message meets 2022. and it'll meet 2023 admit 2020 2021 it'll meet 2022 2023 it meets the conditions of the end time so we can rest and rejoice thank god you've actually laid up food you've you've actually laid up guides to help me in the condition this world is in right now that i don't have to guess how can i serve you in this time and navigate through all these things i can just rejoice and walk on because this message is actually more up to date right now than it was when it was preached because a prophet when a prophet sees things in in time where he is it's in seed form but how he sees it it's fully mature and now it's fully mature back then it was in seed form so we can just rest our god's got the battle but this man this man standing he's gonna wrap your bride doesn't matter how dark it gets he's gonna rapture us out of here just keep looking to him amen let's have the musicians tonight shall we amen but i'm so glad sure the enemies here that the every generation's gonna learn how to fight but you know what i love about the enemy he was defeated back there yeah the devil's a loser let's just let's just call it he's a loser he lost the battle did he beat david as goliath no did he stop noah building an ark no did he stop elijah no on mount carmel no did he stop our lord jesus let's just take the main one did he stop the book of acts church did they quit when the sanhedrin said stop preaching in this name they said no who should we who should we who should we uh follow or obey god or man and you know after they obeded you know what they did they went praising god hallelujah saying lord where you found us worthy to be persecuted for your namesake you know sometimes we go through a trial and we're like oh yeah we feel all downcast no we should rejoice the word says bless out thou have your persecuted for my sake for my word's sake so we should be like them glory amen lord you've come to me worthy to to be persecuted you've actually counted me worthy that the guns of hell have been firing at me praise the lord amen i don't think that's too extreme we can just go on praising god hallelujah hallelujah anyhow amen let's go we're going to sing um see if i can drive this from here we're going to sing victory is mine i trust you got the victory tonight hallelujah no matter what's going on our god's awesome should we stand tonight shall we amen you say you don't know he said brother ben you don't know what i'm going through i'll say victory's yours yes victory is yours amen oh victory is mine victory is mine victory today is mine i told satan to get thee in behind name of jesus christ and love is mine oh love is my [Music] [Music] is mine yes peace is [Music] [Music] i got up this morning i didn't have no doubt i
