[5:31] [Music]
[6:03] Hey everybody.
[6:10] [Music]
[6:36] Heat.
[6:39] [Music]
[6:46] Praise the Lord. Good afternoon
[6:48] everyone. God bless you all. How are
[6:50] you? You're all good. Feeling good. Had
[6:53] a good Have a good lunch? Yeah.
[6:56] Wide awake, refreshed. Food gives you
[7:00] energy.
[7:02] It doesn't make you tired in the
[7:03] afternoon. It gives you energy.
[7:06] You should be so energized this
[7:07] afternoon to praise and worship and to
[7:10] stay
[7:11] alert. That's what we're declaring this
[7:13] afternoon. This is not one of those
[7:14] afternoon meetings where you get tired.
[7:16] No, no, no, no, no, no. Not
[7:19] today. No, no. Don't don't sit. Okay.
[7:23] Okay. No. Sister Rachel can, you just
[7:25] got back from um Italy, I believe, this
[7:28] morning. So, okay. There's one allowance
[7:31] in the room, but that's it. Okay. If she
[7:33] sleeps, it's okay. nobody
[7:37] else. But we know the spirit is always
[7:39] willing.
[7:41] It's always willing. Sometimes this
[7:43] flesh just just has to catch the
[7:45] revelation,
[7:46] too. So in Bulls, they've got they do a
[7:49] funny pun on the words here in Bulls,
[7:51] you know, like they've got the police
[7:53] station, the
[7:55] comfortable, and then the church.
[7:57] There's a sign out there. It says
[7:59] believable. And then there's the
[8:00] community center is
[8:02] befriendable. I think after this
[8:05] morning's sermon, we are undefeable.
[8:09] [Applause]
[8:11] You
[8:12] know, whether you're up, whether you're
[8:15] down, you're undefeable. If you're
[8:17] happy, you're sad, you're undefeable.
[8:19] You know, we we are always a son of God
[8:21] or a daughter of God, we're always
[8:23] victorious. It it doesn't matter whether
[8:26] on the mountain top, in the valley,
[8:27] we're always victorious. We're always
[8:30] we're always undefeable.
[8:32] whether whether you're on the mountain
[8:33] in the valley, healthy or sick, rich or
[8:37] poor, it doesn't actually matter. And
[8:40] you know, one thing I'm starting to
[8:42] notice is that I I'm embracing that more
[8:44] and more every day is that actually
[8:45] that's what I am. Regardless at all of
[8:47] anything I see around me, any of my
[8:49] circumstances, regardless of
[8:50] anything, that's who I am in Christ is
[8:53] undefeable.
[8:56] And then when you think like that, you
[8:58] think, well, I'm just going to go
[8:58] forward then and just walk into it with
[9:01] just believe and go forward cuz we have
[9:03] three options essentially. We got sort
[9:04] of two, but we can throw one in there.
[9:06] One is we go forward, another one as we
[9:07] stand here and do nothing. Another one
[9:09] as we go backwards. And I guarantee you
[9:12] if you were to say die later on today,
[9:16] I'm going to say you would probably
[9:18] prefer that you died moving forward.
[9:20] Yeah. You don't want to you don't want
[9:22] to die moving backwards or standing
[9:24] where you are.
[9:26] And who's to say you're not going to die
[9:27] this afternoon?
[9:32] [Music]
[9:35] So, who cares? Just be bold and move
[9:37] forward.
[9:38] [Music]
[9:40] Then, you know, Brother Brandham's theme
[9:42] song was only believe. All things are
[9:45] possible. A and faith is always moving
[9:48] forward like footsteps are possession.
[9:51] Faith doesn't faith is not activated
[9:53] until you go in and possess whatever
[9:54] that thing that faith says you possess.
[9:57] Like it faith is not activated standing
[9:59] still like like they could have the
[10:01] children of Israel could have Joshua
[10:02] could have stood on the or Caleb could
[10:04] have stood at the border of the land for
[10:05] his whole life saying I'm going to get
[10:06] that land. I'm going to get it. Praise
[10:07] the Lord. It's mine. But but nothing can
[10:11] substitute going like that. The moment
[10:14] he did that was the the the foot the
[10:16] land that he stood on was his. It always
[10:19] takes effort and energy and going
[10:21] outside of where you currently are to
[10:22] move forward in the Lord or into into
[10:24] anything. You just you just move
[10:26] forward. Footsteps are possession. And I
[10:29] believe we are we are a group of people
[10:31] that move forward in the Lord today.
[10:32] That's who we are. We're not we don't
[10:34] turn back. We don't have any armor on
[10:35] our back. We just have only armor on our
[10:36] front. So, we just move forward. Let's
[10:38] stand this afternoon and um just commit
[10:40] the service to the Lord.
[10:43] Lord, we're so grateful that we can be
[10:44] gathered together amongst the children
[10:46] uh the the children of God that are
[10:48] undefeable today, Lord. That's what we
[10:49] confess that we are, Lord, that we were
[10:52] chosen in you before the foundation of
[10:53] the world, Lord. And we're undefeable
[10:56] this afternoon cuz we know that you've
[10:58] won every battle, Lord. You You
[11:00] conquered death, hell, the grave, Lord.
[11:02] You You overcame everything, Lord, and
[11:04] you made us undefeable, Lord. So, we
[11:07] just want to come to you in praise and
[11:09] worship. And we don't want the enemy to
[11:10] rob us this afternoon, but we just want
[11:12] to enter in, Lord, and possess all that
[11:14] you have for us this afternoon. May you
[11:15] forgive us of all of our sins, Lord. And
[11:17] may we we come with boldness before your
[11:20] throne of grace this afternoon. We come
[11:22] by faith knowing, Lord, that you made a
[11:24] way and you said for us to come, Lord.
[11:25] So, we come here today. We come, we
[11:27] worship. We believe you're already in
[11:28] the midst, Lord. You said where two or
[11:29] three are gathered in your name, there
[11:30] you are in the midst. We thank you for
[11:32] these services we can have. We thank
[11:33] you. we can we've got the means to come
[11:35] together and meet here and worship and
[11:37] praise. Other countries don't have this
[11:40] opportunity or the means or things like
[11:41] that, Lord, but we want to thank you so
[11:43] much that we could do this and just have
[11:45] this good time of fellowship here in
[11:46] Bulls. So, we just want to commit the
[11:47] service to your hands in Jesus wonderful
[11:49] name. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's uh

[30:11] I sought the
[30:14] truth. Men gave their
[30:18] answers, but something just wasn't
[30:22] right.
[30:23] [Music]
[30:26] I couldn't explain it. They sounded like
[30:32] strangers. It just didn't meet my thirst
[30:38] inside. Then I heard an eagle's
[30:43] cry. Heard a word speak to my heart. I
[30:48] said, "Child, you don't belong down
[30:50] there. come up from where you are. Then
[30:55] I heard an eagle's
[30:58] cry. It told me I could fly. And I
[31:03] believe the word that I had heard and
[31:07] soared up to the sky when I heard an
[31:11] eagle's cry.
[31:16] [Music]
[31:19] How I was
[31:21] thirsty and I was
[31:25] pouring from somewhere deep
[31:32] inside. The deep
[31:35] unveil through your seven angels, the
[31:40] voice of the bridegroom calling to his
[31:44] bride.
[31:45] [Music]
[31:46] Then I heard an eagle's
[31:49] cry. I heard a word speak to my heart.
[31:54] He said, "Shout, you don't belong down
[31:57] there. Come up where you are."
[32:04] Heat. Heat.
[32:07] [Music]
[32:23] Now I am flying above all the confusion
[32:30] below everything here and now I'm flying
[32:36] above in every situation.
[32:41] Whatever comes my way, I I have a peace
[32:46] with Jesus flying above the
[32:50] stor. There is a joy within me now that
[32:56] I'm
[32:58] so

[33:06] be back. My soul is
[33:11] glory. I will in the
[33:16] heavenly for
[33:20] eternity. Then I heard an eagle
[33:24] cry. I heard a word speak to my heart.
[33:28] He said, "Sh, you don't belong down
[33:31] there. Come up the way you are." Then I
[33:36] heard an eagle
[33:38] cry. He told me I could fly. And I
[33:43] believe the word that I had heard so up
[33:48] to the sky. When I heard an eagle's
[33:54] [Music]
[33:55] cry. Then I heard an eagle's
[33:59] cry. I heard a word speak to my heart. I
[34:04] said, "Child, you don't belong down
[34:07] there. Come up from where you are." Then
[34:11] I heard an eagle's
[34:14] cry. It told me I could fly. And I
[34:19] believe the word that I had heard so up
[34:24] to the sky when I heard an eagle's cry.
[34:31] [Music]

[39:14] Lunch?
[39:16] Amen. Praise the Lord. That's good.
[39:19] Amen. Let's go to um the book of Luke,
[39:23] chapter 4. Sorry, I don't have a
[39:24] slideshow on me. Uh I didn't I didn't
[39:26] make one.
[39:28] Um, but we're going to go to Luke um 4
[39:31] and 16 down to verse 22. And just as
[39:34] you're turning there, I just want to
[39:35] read a a praise report from uh Sister
[39:38] Lzelle. Where's Sister Lzelle? She's
[39:40] there. So, I just want to thank the Lord
[39:42] for a near incident on our way to Bulls
[39:44] yesterday. The Lord protected us and um
[39:47] and oncoming cars from a flying
[39:49] wheelbarrow.
[39:51] Praise the Lord. So, amen. Hallelujah.
[39:53] There's angels watching over us all the
[39:55] time, isn't there? So, praise God. So,
[39:56] we thank the Lord for that. Amen. Praise
[39:58] the Lord. Amen. So, Luke uh 4 and 16 and
[40:03] then we're going to read down to verse
[40:05] 22. I know this is probably very
[40:06] familiar piece of scripture for
[40:08] everyone, but just want to um yeah, use
[40:11] this as an opening text here. So, Luke 4
[40:14] and uh 16 says here, "And he came to
[40:17] Nazareth where he had been brought up,
[40:18] and as his custom was, he went into the
[40:20] synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood
[40:23] up for to read. And there was delivered
[40:24] unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah.
[40:27] And when he had opened the book, he
[40:28] found the place where it was written,
[40:29] "The spirit of the Lord is upon me,
[40:31] because he hath anointed me to preach
[40:33] the gospel to the poor. He hath sent me
[40:35] to heal the brokenhearted, to preach
[40:37] deliverance to the captives, and
[40:38] recovering of the sight to the blind, to
[40:40] set at liberty them that are bruised, to
[40:42] preach the acceptable year of the Lord."
[40:44] And he closed the book, and he gave it
[40:46] again to the minister, and sat down. And
[40:49] the eyes of all them that were in the
[40:51] synagogue were fastened on him. And he
[40:53] began to say unto them, "This day is
[40:56] this scripture fulfilled in your ears."
[40:59] And all bear him witness and wondered at
[41:01] the gracious words which proceeded out
[41:03] of his mouth. And they said, "Is not
[41:05] this Joseph's son?" Amen. So, let's just
[41:09] bow heads in a word of prayer this
[41:10] afternoon. Amen. If you have a need, you
[41:12] just want to lift your hands to the
[41:13] Lord. I believe the Lord could change
[41:15] all of our lives in this service. Amen.
[41:17] I believe our God is a God of moments.
[41:19] Amen. This is another moment in his
[41:20] presence. So, let's pray. Gracious
[41:22] Father, we love you, Lord. We thank you,
[41:24] Lord. We can sing that song, Word of God
[41:25] Ever True, changing me, changing you,
[41:28] Lord. We're so thankful for your work in
[41:30] our lives, Lord. What you're doing,
[41:31] changing us from glory to glory. And
[41:33] Father, as we have gathered here in this
[41:35] afternoon, Lord, we've read your word.
[41:36] We're asking, Lord, that you would
[41:38] anoint your word, anoint speaker, and
[41:40] hearer, Lord, just want to get myself
[41:41] out of the way that you come and speak
[41:42] your word to your children, Lord God.
[41:45] May we just be lifted into heavenly
[41:46] places, Lord, in your presence. And may
[41:48] you have preminence in our midst, Lord.
[41:50] Father, may you forgive us of our sins
[41:51] and our wrongs, Lord. Wash us, Lord, by
[41:54] your blood and just have your way in our
[41:55] lives. We love you, Lord. We thank you
[41:57] so much, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name.
[41:59] Amen. Amen. God bless you. You can you
[42:02] can have your seats uh this afternoon.
[42:04] So, I want to speak, if I could title
[42:07] this this afternoon, I want to speak
[42:08] about this day. This day is a very a
[42:11] very important day. Very powerful
[42:14] day. I always, you know, it always grips
[42:17] me very deeply when I read what we just
[42:19] read from Luke chapter 4 because you
[42:21] think about this. Here is here is here
[42:23] is more than a prophet, more than a
[42:25] religious leader, but the God of the
[42:26] prophets, God himself, the word made
[42:29] flesh, went into the synagogue. It was
[42:31] his custom to go to church. He always
[42:33] went to church. Amen. And so here he
[42:35] was, he's standing there and he's given
[42:36] the he's given the scrolls. He's given
[42:38] the book of Isaiah and he identifies the
[42:41] so the word made flesh identifies
[42:43] himself in the written word saying this
[42:47] is what I'm here to fulfill in this day
[42:49] and he would read this and he would say
[42:52] this day is this scripture fulfilled in
[42:54] your ears now it wasn't a it wasn't an
[42:57] argument wasn't a discussion he wasn't
[42:59] pondering these things he knew by
[43:01] revelation that he was here to fulfill
[43:03] this piece of the scripture amen so when
[43:05] he said this day is this scripture
[43:07] fulfilled in your ears. Amen. He was
[43:09] making a declaration. What you see in
[43:11] front of you made flesh is the prophecy
[43:13] of Isaiah is no longer a prophecy no
[43:16] more, but it's manifested in front of
[43:17] you. First it was the thoughts in the
[43:19] mind of God. Then then it was spoken
[43:21] through the prophet. Now it's become
[43:22] material in front of you. This day is
[43:24] this scripture fulfilled. It was the
[43:26] word made flesh. I opening the word
[43:29] identifying himself in his own word. I
[43:32] think it's an incredible thing because
[43:33] we can stand here and I maybe I'll do
[43:35] you know maybe cover a few of them with
[43:37] the help of the Lord this afternoon but
[43:39] this day a lot of scriptures fulfilled
[43:42] this day we're living the day of
[43:43] fulfilled prophecy this day amen is an
[43:45] incredible day that we're being
[43:46] privileged to live in you know so we
[43:49] sing that song word of God came to us
[43:50] through sacrifice I sing that I feel
[43:53] this big I think Lord you allowed your
[43:55] children to go through great trials and
[43:56] depths and dangers and things and I just
[43:59] received the benefit of it amen it's
[44:01] like I've got a free pass almost of
[44:03] just, you know, just walking into glory.
[44:05] They did all the hard yaker and here I
[44:06] am. That's how I feel anyway. You know,
[44:08] because why? Cuz they went through great
[44:10] dangers for the word to be passed down
[44:12] into this age. Amen. And many of the
[44:15] prophecies that we have seen the
[44:16] fulfillment of and we're living out,
[44:18] they just maybe talked about, maybe they
[44:20] discussed it, but they never lived long
[44:22] enough to see it fulfilled. But this
[44:23] day, Amen. Every prophecy concerning the
[44:26] bride is fulfilled. Amen. this day.
[44:29] Amen. These scriptures are fulfilled.
[44:31] Amen. We're not we're not here to to
[44:33] debate if there's a bride. I can say
[44:35] this day. Amen. The prophecy of of of
[44:38] Revelations 19, behold, his wife is made
[44:41] herself ready. The marriage of the Lamb
[44:42] is come. Amen. This day, that scripture
[44:45] is fulfilled. It was granted unto her
[44:48] that she be arrayed in fine linen, clean
[44:49] and white, which is the righteous of
[44:51] saints. This day, is that scripture
[44:53] fulfilled? Amen. Why? Cuz God has given
[44:55] us grace. He's granted us, Amen. and the
[44:58] robes of righteousness. We don't have to
[45:00] earn it. We don't have to work it out.
[45:01] It's given to us freely.
[45:04] Amen. I tell you what, friends, that's
[45:06] one way you know you're in the bride
[45:07] age. You're not is because you you
[45:09] realize it's the supreme grace of God.
[45:11] Amen. Because brother Ram said that he
[45:13] is always misunderstood and criticized
[45:15] for believing in grace. Why? Because
[45:17] he's living in a Pentecostal age. And
[45:19] brother Ram said the Pentecostals were
[45:20] great legalists. They were the arms of
[45:22] the body, right? And so, so what did
[45:25] they do? They they thought they had to
[45:27] earn something with God to or do
[45:29] something to get his favor. What was
[45:31] that? Well, I speak in tongues.
[45:33] Therefore, I found favor with God
[45:34] because of something I have done. But we
[45:37] don't believe it that way. It's like the
[45:39] list of doctrines brother put up. I
[45:41] believe servants in Godhead all these
[45:42] things. That's still a manage
[45:44] understanding of well I believe this
[45:45] therefore I have found favor with God.
[45:48] It's nothing you have done. It's all he
[45:50] has done. Hallelujah. So, we're not
[45:52] saying, "Well, I believe this,
[45:53] therefore, I'm therefore I'm qualified
[45:55] for a rapture." No, it's the grace of
[45:57] God coming into our lives. I mean, the
[45:59] power of the blood coming into our lives
[46:01] and transforming us, hallelujah, makes
[46:04] us rapture ready.
[46:06] Yeah. If you think I'm too liberal, I
[46:09] don't care. I really don't care what you
[46:11] think. God found me in the depths of
[46:13] sin. I knew what I was and I know what I
[46:16] am. Hallelujah. You call me what you
[46:19] want. God found me and he found me to
[46:21] keep me. He found you to keep you as
[46:23] well. Amen. This day we can say God's
[46:25] grace works. Amen. This day we can say
[46:27] the blood of Jesus Christ is more than
[46:29] enough. Amen. We're not a people
[46:31] guessing and wondering if we're saved.
[46:32] We know in whom we have believed. Amen.
[46:35] We know. Amen. We're secure. Amen. We
[46:37] believe. And we know eternal security is
[46:39] right. Why? Because he's holding on to
[46:42] you. Amen. It's not us holding on to
[46:44] God. It's him holding on to us. Amen.
[46:47] When brother Ram had his great trial of
[46:48] his wife and and daughter dying all
[46:50] these things, people would say, "Bill,
[46:52] are you holding on to your religion?" He
[46:53] says, "No, God is holding on to me." I
[46:56] mean, when he wanted to let go, when he
[46:58] wanted to commit suicide, God said, "No,
[47:00] I've got a plan for your life. You're
[47:01] you're not allowed to get off yet."
[47:03] Amen. You got some scripture to fulfill,
[47:05] I tell you what, friends, we're in the
[47:06] same category. God has word for you to
[47:09] fulfill. Amen. He's commissioned you to
[47:11] do it. He's anointed you to do it. I say
[47:13] this day it'll be fulfilled. Hallelujah.
[47:16] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. God is here to
[47:19] prove his own word. Amen. When God gave
[47:22] a promise of a bride in this age, he
[47:24] didn't back up when he knew the
[47:25] conditions of this age. Amen. He knew
[47:28] the state of this world. He knew it
[47:30] would fall apart. He knew the state of
[47:32] people would be degraded, too. But he
[47:34] said even in that kind of condition, he
[47:36] says, "No, I'm going to bring my bride
[47:37] bride out of that chaos." He brought us
[47:40] out of a lot of chaos.
[47:42] I was twisted up and turned around and
[47:44] every which way. But God, rich in mercy.
[47:47] I pray we just be more thankful what God
[47:49] has done. Do you really appreciate Amen.
[47:52] what he's done in our lives even now?
[47:54] You say, "Well, I'm going through the
[47:55] worst trial of your life. He hasn't let
[47:57] you go. He hasn't forsaken you." Amen.
[48:00] He's still right with you. Amen. The two
[48:02] on the way to Emmas. Amen. They were
[48:04] they were walking in the season of the
[48:06] resurrection. Their whole world had
[48:07] fallen apart. When they were walking to
[48:09] Emmas, they weren't skipping. They
[48:11] weren't dancing. They weren't rejoicing.
[48:13] They were brokenhearted down. They had
[48:16] the whole thing had fallen apart in
[48:18] their eyes. It was right according to
[48:20] God's plan. It was right according to
[48:22] schedule. But they thought, "How could
[48:24] this happen?" But you see what happens
[48:26] is when you begin to talk about Jesus,
[48:28] he begins to walk with you. He begins to
[48:31] the atmosphere begins to change around
[48:32] you. You begin to talk about his
[48:34] promised word and the fulfillment of it.
[48:36] You know, because that's what they were
[48:37] doing. They were talking about Jesus.
[48:39] They weren't talking about the Romans.
[48:40] They weren't talking about the economics
[48:42] of this world. They were talking about
[48:44] what God was doing in their day, even
[48:46] though they didn't understand it. And
[48:48] when they were talking about the Lord,
[48:50] he began to walk with them. I mean, they
[48:53] did not understand that the that the
[48:54] stranger that was walking with them was
[48:56] the very God. I mean, the very Lord of
[48:58] glory, he just withheld that knowledge
[49:01] from
[49:02] them. Then then the Lord began to ask
[49:06] them, "Why are you sad?" as if he didn't
[49:07] know, you know, as if he didn't know.
[49:10] And then they would have looked at it
[49:11] with such a surprise. Don't you know
[49:12] what's happened in these days? See, they
[49:14] didn't know it was this day was this
[49:16] scripture fulfilled. I mean, of the
[49:18] crucifixion, of the of the true Passover
[49:20] lamb being given and all these things.
[49:22] They didn't understand it, but they were
[49:23] living in that scripture. And then here
[49:25] they are and they begin to say to him,
[49:26] "Don't you know this man, Jesus of
[49:28] Nazareth? We considered him a prophet."
[49:30] All these things. And you know, but now
[49:32] he's been crucified and it's been three
[49:33] days. And then he begin to talk to them
[49:35] say, "Oh, fools." and slow of heart to
[49:38] believe. You see, they were downhearted,
[49:40] but God didn't want to leave them that
[49:42] way. I tell you what, friends, you can
[49:44] go through a lot of hard trials and be
[49:46] real downcast. God don't want to keep
[49:48] you that way. Amen. But God wants to
[49:50] bring a bring a bring a fresh revival
[49:52] into your life. Amen. To revive you.
[49:55] Amen. It's like Jacob, you know, Jacob
[49:57] in the Bible, it says his spirit
[49:58] basically departed from him when his son
[50:00] Joseph was, you know, he thought he was
[50:02] dead and he was down. But then after
[50:05] many years had passed and Joseph
[50:06] revealed himself to his brethren. And
[50:08] then when his brothers came back to to
[50:10] well well the sons came back to Jacob,
[50:12] they begin to tell Jacob how Joseph is
[50:14] alive and he's in Egypt. And and then
[50:16] and then you know the Bible says when
[50:18] when Jacob saw the wagons of the goods
[50:21] that Joseph brought uh sent with his
[50:23] brothers, then his spirit begin to
[50:25] revive within him. I mean so I pray God
[50:27] would send wagon loads of the Holy Ghost
[50:29] down into our lives. Amen. To revive us.
[50:32] Amen. to realize sure we've been through
[50:33] shock and loss but God hasn't forgotten
[50:35] us. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So, so you
[50:38] know the Lord begin to walk with these
[50:40] two on the way to Emmas and then he
[50:42] begin to start from Moses. He begin to
[50:44] read down and you know brother Bram uh
[50:46] brings it out so nicely in uh events
[50:48] made clear by prophecy 1965. He says now
[50:51] let's hear him say turn over to
[50:53] Zechariah 11 and 12. And wasn't the
[50:55] Messiah to be sold according to the
[50:57] prophet for 30 pieces of silver? uh you
[51:00] just said that this man was sold for 30
[51:01] pieces of silver turn over you're
[51:03] getting them scriptures Zechariah 11:12
[51:05] then he said did you notice what David
[51:07] said in the Psalms Psalms 41-9 that he
[51:09] is to be betrayed by his friends and
[51:11] then again in Zechariah 13:7 that he was
[51:13] forsaken by his disciples and in Psalms
[51:16] 35:11 accused by false witnesses you
[51:19] just said he was Isaiah 53 and7 he was
[51:22] dumb before his accusers Isaiah 50 and6
[51:25] they scorged him the prophet said in
[51:27] Psalms 22 he was on the My God, my God,
[51:30] why has thou forsaken me? Did he do that
[51:32] the day before yesterday? Psalms 22
[51:34] again 18, his garments were parted among
[51:36] them. Did they do that? And Psalms 22:7
[51:39] to8, mocked by his enemies, the church.
[51:42] Psalms 22 again, that there was not a
[51:43] bone in his body to be broke, but they
[51:45] pierced my hands and my feet, he said,
[51:47] holding his hands behind him, no doubt
[51:48] at that time. Isaiah 53:12 said, "He
[51:51] would die between malfactors." Isaiah
[51:53] 53:9 said, "He was buried with the
[51:56] rich." Psalm 16:10 said, "I will not
[51:58] leave a soul in hell, neither will I
[52:00] suffer my holy one to see corruption."
[52:02] And was not Malachi 3, the forerunner of
[52:04] this man. Oh, I'd like to heard him
[52:06] quote that. Look at the prophecies.
[52:08] Notice then all the types he might have
[52:10] went through about Isaac in Genesis 22,
[52:12] how God foreshadowed Isaac, how father
[52:15] Abraham took his own son, packing the
[52:16] wood up the hill, and offered up his own
[52:18] son. So, he began to ask some questions
[52:20] after he quoted the scripture. Did he do
[52:22] that? Amen. And you know, we could bring
[52:24] it into this day. Did he not say in
[52:26] Malachi 4 that he had sent Elijah the
[52:28] prophet before the great and dreadful
[52:29] day of the Lord? Did he do that? Amen.
[52:32] Was he not commissioned on on the Ohio
[52:34] River in 1933, the pillar of fire came
[52:36] down, a voice spoke out, "As John the
[52:38] Baptist foreer run my first coming, so
[52:40] your message will forrun the second
[52:41] coming." Did he do that? Amen. Did you
[52:44] know did not the angel of the Lord
[52:46] commission brother Brandham, Amen, took,
[52:48] you know, took the two signs and, you
[52:50] know, went to the world to spearhead a
[52:52] worldwide healing revival? Did he do
[52:54] that? Amen. Was he not told that he
[52:57] would meet seven angels north I think
[52:59] northeast of Tucson to fulfill
[53:01] Revelations 10:1? Did he do that? Amen.
[53:04] Was he not told? Amen. Did Did Was he
[53:08] not told to go back to Jeffersonville
[53:09] that the seven seals would be open? Did
[53:12] he do that? Amen. Did he do that? Amen.
[53:14] Did Did not the lamb step forth and take
[53:17] the title deed of redemption? Amen. You
[53:20] know, one of the biggest scarecrows
[53:21] around the opening of the book of
[53:23] Revelation, people say it's just
[53:24] information. It ain't just information.
[53:27] It's revelation. Gives you overcoming
[53:29] power. Amen. To overcome in this day.
[53:31] Amen. Because sure, we're being restored
[53:33] back to, you know, you know, the bride
[53:34] of Jesus Christ has been restored back
[53:36] to the original. But God has sent a
[53:38] power in this age to break the cycle of
[53:41] revival and death. Amen. Because we know
[53:43] through the church ages has been a cycle
[53:45] of revival and death and revival. I
[53:47] mean, God would send a message, there
[53:49] would be a revival in the church, but a
[53:50] few generations later, it would cool off
[53:52] and then God would, you know, restart
[53:54] the process again. But there has to come
[53:56] a time when that cycle is broken. I
[53:59] mean, it doesn't go revival and death
[54:01] and just just just cabbageing down and
[54:03] just churchity. But God would come and
[54:05] live in his people. There'll be revival
[54:07] from one generation to the next. Amen.
[54:09] And so what happens now is when the lamb
[54:11] takes the book and those seven thunders
[54:13] out of their voices is whenever the word
[54:15] of God opens up there's a power released
[54:17] in that word to overcome in that day.
[54:19] You say well I need an example. That's
[54:21] pretty easy. You know Martin Luther when
[54:22] the word came open to him the just shall
[54:24] live by faith. You know I just said to
[54:26] brother Al he's preaching. I'm like I'm
[54:28] just going to take the same you know the
[54:30] Lord put this on my heart to take the
[54:32] same thing basically but from a
[54:33] different angle. Okay. So I wasn't
[54:35] quickly changing things to make sure it
[54:36] matched. No it was already here. Okay. I
[54:39] think God wants to tell us something,
[54:40] you know. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, so,
[54:42] so, so when the word came open to Martin
[54:44] Luther, the just shall live by faith.
[54:46] There was a power in that word for him
[54:47] to live above trying to earn his own
[54:49] salvation, right? And then the Wesleyans
[54:52] came along, John Wesley actually read uh
[54:55] Martin Luther's um writings on the book
[54:58] of Romans. And he was already a preacher
[55:00] at that time, failed miserably. He heard
[55:02] he heard Martin Luther's writings on the
[55:04] book of Romans and he said a warming
[55:06] sensation warmed his heart. And then God
[55:08] began to move in his life and he began
[55:10] to preach the second work of grace,
[55:12] sanctification.
[55:13] And what happened? The power of God was
[55:15] released through that word for the
[55:16] people to live a holy life. Amen. And
[55:19] then it came around to the time of Isuza
[55:21] Street. There was a cry for the
[55:22] restoration of the gifts. God was
[55:23] restoring. Amen. And when the reality of
[55:26] the restoration of the gifts struck the
[55:28] struck the church, well, it was the word
[55:30] opening up to them to restore the gifts.
[55:32] A power came in. Amen. But after every
[55:34] one of those moves, there's been a
[55:36] revival. Then there's been a cycle of
[55:37] revival and death. Amen. But now with
[55:40] the opening of the word, amen, Christ
[55:41] himself being fully unveiled in this
[55:44] day, what does that do? It releases a
[55:46] power into the church. Amen. To break
[55:48] the cycle of revival and death.
[55:51] Hallelujah. That's what's coming to your
[55:53] life. Amen. Hallelujah. It's not just a,
[55:55] you know, just a one-time experience and
[55:57] excitement that cools off. No. God wants
[55:59] to give us, and I believe he has through
[56:01] the opening of the word, an unending
[56:02] revival. I mean, where you be that Welsh
[56:05] policeman. You say, "I am the bride's
[56:07] revival." You're looking at it when you
[56:09] come into my presence. You're looking at
[56:10] it right now. Hallelujah.
[56:13] Praise the Lord. You know, the first
[56:15] time I listened to the seals, I just saw
[56:17] horse riders, tribulation, all those
[56:19] things. The second time I listened to
[56:21] it, all I saw was the lamb stepping
[56:23] forth to claim me. Hallelujah. And more
[56:26] than horse riders, more than symbols,
[56:28] it's Christ revealing himself. And I
[56:30] pray that it would happen to all of us.
[56:32] You'd see under those seals is what is
[56:34] it? It's a lamb taking the book. And
[56:36] what is that? That is the same as
[56:37] brother Ram says about as as as Boaz
[56:40] claiming Ruth. You are that book. Hey,
[56:43] what what's happening through this
[56:45] message? God has said, "You're mine."
[56:47] Amen. And the devil has no claim on you
[56:49] no more. He strikes it all off by the
[56:50] power of his blood. Hallelujah.
[56:54] Amen. Praise the Lord. So, has he not
[56:56] done that? Did not brother say that this
[56:59] message will introduce Jesus Christ to
[57:01] the world? Has it not done it?
[57:04] Amen. Has it not happened that there
[57:06] would be a people that would take the
[57:07] book, eat the book, and speak and
[57:09] prophesy again? Has that not happened?
[57:12] Has he done it?
[57:14] Does not the scripture say that there
[57:15] would be a people that God would call
[57:17] out of the Gentiles for his name's sake?
[57:20] Let's bring it personal. Has he not done
[57:21] that? He's called you out. I trust he
[57:23] has. He's called you out. Amen. You're
[57:25] no longer a church person, a religious
[57:27] person. This ain't a religion. No, this
[57:29] is a call to a union. Hallelujah. Has he
[57:33] not done that? Amen. Did he not say
[57:35] there be a bride without spot or
[57:36] wrinkle? Has he done it? Has he done it?
[57:40] Amen. For it says in 2 Corinthians 5:21,
[57:43] he hath he hath made him to be sin for
[57:46] us who knew no sin that we might be made
[57:48] the very righteousness of God in him.
[57:52] Has he done it? Now that's personal
[57:54] question. Has he done it? Oh, but I have
[57:56] all these faults and failures. Look
[57:57] beyond those things. Look beyond those
[57:59] things. that on the way to Emmas didn't
[58:01] believe really what was going on in
[58:02] front of them. Did God quit on them? He
[58:05] walked with them until they saw they
[58:08] were part of the resurrection.
[58:10] And God goes with you until your eyes
[58:13] come open. Hallelujah. That you're part
[58:16] of this resurrection in the end time.
[58:19] Hallelujah. You know, Brother Brand
[58:21] would speak about ducks in this day. I
[58:24] like the story because you got to
[58:26] realize the bride has gone through a
[58:29] change. You go back 20 years, would we
[58:32] have these kind of meetings? It would be
[58:34] a bunfight. A preacher would get up, say
[58:37] this, now the preacher get up to counter
[58:39] that guy and you know be like it'd be
[58:41] like a political like a parliament. Mr.
[58:43] Speaker, he said this and this is wrong
[58:45] here. It was all this. And what was it?
[58:48] It's like brother Am said, there was a
[58:49] there was a bunch of ducks and a farmer
[58:51] put them in pens, right? and they and
[58:54] all they could hear is the honking or
[58:56] the quacking of the other ducks in the
[58:58] pens. They didn't trust what what they
[59:00] hearing. They didn't quite know who was
[59:01] saying it. As the same thing, there's
[59:03] all these man-made fences around people,
[59:06] specialty doctrines. If you don't see it
[59:07] my way, you ain't going. It's got
[59:10] nothing to do with it. Has God called
[59:12] you?
[59:14] Amen. Has this message found you? That's
[59:17] what it's about. Remember, it's not an
[59:19] exam to go to heaven. Brother says we're
[59:21] not saved by a checklist. We're saved by
[59:23] grace.
[59:25] Amen. I'm so thankful for that. Amen.
[59:27] That I can get in. But you see now there
[59:30] came a time when when see these ducks
[59:32] are walking around on the earth mud.
[59:35] They're just all carnal connected to the
[59:37] earth. But then the season changed and
[59:39] the rain begin to be poured out. Amen.
[59:42] The what is that rain? The spirit begin
[59:44] to pour out. And we can see you over the
[59:46] last I've been a believer since 2007. So
[59:49] I've just got this little space of time
[59:50] of experience. I've seen from that time
[59:52] till now, God's poured his spirit out
[59:55] more and more. The rain has come. It's
[59:59] raining. The former and latter rain are
[1:00:01] running together. The teaching and the
[1:00:03] quickening rain are running together.
[1:00:05] Hallelujah. It's not just a teaching
[1:00:07] then a nothing then a harvest rain. No,
[1:00:08] it's running together. Has he done it?
[1:00:13] Hallelujah. Yes, he has. And what has
[1:00:16] happened? The rain has come down. has
[1:00:17] lifted us up out of the muck, out of the
[1:00:20] carnality. Well, that church does this
[1:00:22] and I do this and I'm different to this.
[1:00:24] That's all carnal comparison. We've been
[1:00:26] lifted up above that m. Hallelujah.
[1:00:28] We're all individual. Praise God. Amen.
[1:00:30] This ain't some McDonald's franchise all
[1:00:32] the same. We're all different.
[1:00:36] Hallelujah.
[1:00:38] This ain't this is more than a happy
[1:00:40] meal, folks.
[1:00:41] But you see, God has God has done such a
[1:00:44] work that the that the rain has come cuz
[1:00:45] eventually that rain poured in and it
[1:00:47] lifted the ducks up above the out of the
[1:00:49] mud, above the fences. Then they begin
[1:00:52] to see each other and say, "Hey, you're
[1:00:54] a duck, too." Amen. That's what
[1:00:56] happened. Hallelujah. So now we've come
[1:00:58] into a season where we identify I'm the
[1:01:01] word, you're the word. I'm a duck,
[1:01:03] you're a duck. I mean, you ain't a goose
[1:01:05] or a whatever. You're a duck. And I'm a
[1:01:07] We're made out of the same material. We
[1:01:10] have the same father. Hallelujah. So now
[1:01:13] what is going to happen? There's a
[1:01:14] swarming going on cuz there's a season
[1:01:17] changing. Then we're going to fly home.
[1:01:21] Hallelujah. Has he done it?
[1:01:24] Amen. This is where we are. You say,
[1:01:26] "Well, brother's just telling a story to
[1:01:28] make a joke." No, he's actually in a
[1:01:30] parable saying this is where we would
[1:01:31] get to. Praise God. Has he done it? Yes,
[1:01:35] he's done it. That's this is why we come
[1:01:37] together. It's like we just Well, we are
[1:01:39] one big family. We're all ducks. Welcome
[1:01:42] to Duck
[1:01:44] Church. Praise God. Hallelujah. Yeah.
[1:01:47] But it used to be it wasn't like that.
[1:01:50] I' I've been to conventions where I was
[1:01:52] first a believer. It was like it there
[1:01:54] was no unity there. Why people were
[1:01:56] still earthbound behind
[1:01:58] fences. Amen. And and you got to realize
[1:02:00] if you know the water may lift you above
[1:02:02] the fence, but if your if your swim is
[1:02:04] just kick a bit of wood, you you feel a
[1:02:05] bit of separation, you got to realize,
[1:02:07] no, that's under you now. That's under
[1:02:09] you. You're swimming above it.
[1:02:12] Hallelujah. We don't have to put up with
[1:02:13] no man-made things. Remember, the devil
[1:02:15] makes fences. Leave his architecture
[1:02:17] alone.
[1:02:19] You know, we're all one family. I'm
[1:02:21] going to You have to put up with me for
[1:02:22] eternity.
[1:02:24] Some of you are happy. So anyway, but
[1:02:27] we're all one family. When one of us
[1:02:30] suffers, the other suffers. One
[1:02:31] rejoices, we all rejoice. We care for
[1:02:34] one another. We all want to make it.
[1:02:38] Amen.
[1:02:41] You say, "Well, one day, no, this day."
[1:02:45] This day, this has been happening for
[1:02:47] quite a long time. There's a unity
[1:02:48] around the world. What's happening? God
[1:02:49] is gathering his ducks together.
[1:02:52] Sometimes, you know, it's not, you know,
[1:02:53] rain may fall slow in different parts,
[1:02:55] but God will get everyone above the
[1:02:56] fence. He'll get all of his children
[1:02:58] above the fence and he's determined.
[1:03:00] None of them will be stuck in the mud in
[1:03:01] the in the pens. They're all being
[1:03:03] lifted up. Amen. And that's exactly what
[1:03:05] God is doing. You say, "Well, one day."
[1:03:07] No, this day. This day, this is
[1:03:11] fulfilled.
[1:03:12] Hallelujah. The Bible says, "Now we are
[1:03:15] the sons of God." This day, we are the
[1:03:18] sons of God. Amen. I'm going to say
[1:03:20] something. God will finish his bride how
[1:03:22] he started his bride. how he started his
[1:03:25] bride is how he's going to finish her. I
[1:03:27] mean, she ain't going to be a different
[1:03:28] material. She ain't going to be a
[1:03:30] different makeup. She's going to be
[1:03:31] exactly grain like the first because
[1:03:34] because we got to realize that on the
[1:03:35] day of Pentecost, there was 120 pieces
[1:03:37] of grain in the upper room. They
[1:03:40] quickened by the Holy Ghost. And God
[1:03:42] would display briefly what the mature
[1:03:45] church would
[1:03:46] be. Amen. They were led by the spirit of
[1:03:49] God. God lived in them more than an
[1:03:52] anointing. God lived in them. Amen. When
[1:03:55] you saw saw the believer, you saw God
[1:03:57] made flesh. The devil was cast out.
[1:04:00] Signs and wonders were done. The word
[1:04:02] was proven. Amen. That's how it was in
[1:04:05] the beginning. And we have gone through
[1:04:07] a process of a restoration.
[1:04:10] Amen. like like like uh brother Ar said
[1:04:13] in the beginning he would say about the
[1:04:16] you know the Pentecostals that you know
[1:04:18] well I'll just read this here now
[1:04:20] through the Lutheran age through the
[1:04:21] Wesleyan age it's been the same thing
[1:04:22] through this Pentecostal age now notice
[1:04:24] but at the opening of the seven seals
[1:04:26] Revelations 10 the full word is to be
[1:04:28] born into manifestation again and
[1:04:30] vindicated by the spirit of God has he
[1:04:33] done it you say well that was back in
[1:04:35] 1965 no has he done it in 2025 has he
[1:04:39] not proved his word in your life today.
[1:04:42] Oh, if we could just go back there. No,
[1:04:43] this day. This day. Amen. Where the son
[1:04:46] of man, brother Ram said, the son of man
[1:04:48] is revealed in human beings. Many people
[1:04:51] want to put the son of man. Luke 17:30
[1:04:53] just on the prophet. No, that same
[1:04:55] ministry is continued on in you and I.
[1:04:58] Has he done it? Amen. Where all of us
[1:05:00] are the manifestation of the son of man.
[1:05:03] Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord. So
[1:05:06] I'm I'm so thankful the same God back in
[1:05:09] the prophet's life is here. Same God,
[1:05:12] same quality, same Holy Ghost, same
[1:05:15] ability. He hasn't diminished. We don't
[1:05:17] have to look back in a rearview mirror
[1:05:18] and just say, "I wish I was back there."
[1:05:20] No, the same one is with you.
[1:05:22] Hallelujah. Amen. So, and vindicated by
[1:05:25] the spirit in the full strength as it
[1:05:27] was when he is here on earth. Uh here on
[1:05:30] earth, manifested in the same way, doing
[1:05:32] the same things that it did when it was
[1:05:34] here on earth. Amen. Hebrews 3:8 said
[1:05:36] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:05:37] today, and forever. And Luke 17:30,
[1:05:39] Jesus said, "In the last days, as it was
[1:05:42] in the days of Sodom, when the Son of
[1:05:43] Man will be revealing himself again,
[1:05:45] it'll be the same thing. The world is in
[1:05:47] a Sodom condition. The church has has
[1:05:49] went into Sodom with it like Lot and his
[1:05:51] wife." And I say that there is an
[1:05:52] elected church somewhere in the world
[1:05:55] that's pulling out and set aside from
[1:05:57] those things. And the manifestation of
[1:05:59] God has attracted its attention. We're
[1:06:01] at the last days. The shook has given
[1:06:03] forth its strength into the seed. It's
[1:06:05] went on out. It was a good shook. It has
[1:06:08] served its time. But see, it's the
[1:06:10] bride. It's the word bride of the word
[1:06:13] groom. I say this day, this is
[1:06:16] fulfilled. I trust it ain't too strong.
[1:06:18] But the we're here. We have arrived. I
[1:06:21] mean, we're not waiting for another
[1:06:23] messenger to come. We're not waiting for
[1:06:24] someone to come and open the book. It's
[1:06:26] been opened. The the Bible's no longer a
[1:06:29] mystery. If someone preaches all the
[1:06:31] mysteries of the mysteries of the
[1:06:32] mysteries, no, it's made plain these
[1:06:34] days. Amen. The word has come open. What
[1:06:37] to do? To produce a word bride.
[1:06:40] Amen. And that is who you are. You say,
[1:06:42] "Me and my problems."
[1:06:45] Absolutely. We have this humanity that
[1:06:47] we live in. Does that stop God? No. God
[1:06:50] wants to reveal deity within humanity.
[1:06:53] Amen. He wants to use you and manifest
[1:06:55] his word out of your life. Amen.
[1:06:58] Hallelujah. Brother Anne would say,
[1:07:00] "Now, the seventh age is a very short
[1:07:01] age. It gathers up into itself for one
[1:07:03] quick work. All the evil of every age
[1:07:06] and yet all the reality of Pentecost."
[1:07:08] Amen. Once the Philadelphiaian age has
[1:07:10] run its course, the Ladyan age quickly
[1:07:12] comes in bringing uh both the tears and
[1:07:14] the wheat to harvest. This day we're
[1:07:18] here.
[1:07:19] Amen. You know, some people will say,
[1:07:21] "Well, we're back to wheat again. We
[1:07:23] just got to lay in the presence of the
[1:07:24] sun." Absolutely.
[1:07:26] But what did the wheat do in the
[1:07:28] beginning? You know, some people say
[1:07:30] there's no manifestation anymore because
[1:07:32] we're not the tassel or the shook or
[1:07:34] whatever. It's just wheat. But what did
[1:07:36] the wheat do in the beginning? What did
[1:07:38] the first wheat do?
[1:07:41] Read the life of Jesus Christ. You'll
[1:07:42] see what the first wheat the main thing
[1:07:44] is he was led by the spirit of God. He
[1:07:47] subjected himself to the word that he
[1:07:49] was to fulfill. That's the most
[1:07:51] supernatural thing you'll ever see is a
[1:07:53] man or woman that will surrender their
[1:07:54] full lives to the word of God above
[1:07:56] miracles, above anything will be God
[1:07:58] will be a man or woman surrendered
[1:08:00] completely to the word of God. Amen.
[1:08:03] Then you see you see in the day of
[1:08:05] Pentecost, you see the church before it
[1:08:07] fell. Amen. What what was it? It was it
[1:08:10] was the grain back again doing exactly
[1:08:12] the same life. Amen. Devils were cast
[1:08:14] out. The word was manifested. People
[1:08:16] were birthed into the kingdom. Amen.
[1:08:18] Revelation, you know, struck their
[1:08:20] souls. They, you on the day of
[1:08:22] Pentecost, they forgot all their
[1:08:23] formality. Amen. As they staggered under
[1:08:26] the stimulation of the revelation that
[1:08:27] God who made heavens and earth was now
[1:08:30] in them. Amen. They were led by the
[1:08:32] spirit of God. Persecution didn't stop
[1:08:34] them.
[1:08:36] When persecution struck them, do you
[1:08:37] know what they did? They had a prayer
[1:08:39] meeting. They had a prayer meeting
[1:08:41] because they realized the enemy was
[1:08:42] trying to stop the life of God being
[1:08:44] expressed in their lives. They gathered
[1:08:46] together. They prayed. God came down,
[1:08:48] shook the place, and gave them boldness.
[1:08:50] And they w went out, Amen. Preaching
[1:08:52] more than they did before that ever
[1:08:53] happened. I pray we do the same thing.
[1:08:56] Amen. Cuz he is your source of strength.
[1:08:58] Hallelujah.
[1:09:00] Amen. That's what they did. They were.
[1:09:02] But more most importantly, the life they
[1:09:05] lived, the life they had was the life of
[1:09:07] Christ himself dwelling in them. That
[1:09:10] was the beginning. You say, "Well, I'm
[1:09:12] not a preacher, an apostle, or
[1:09:13] anything." Well, you know, we read in
[1:09:15] Acts chapter nine, there was a woman who
[1:09:17] was called Tabatha and she, you know,
[1:09:19] she was full of good works and did arms
[1:09:21] and deeds, you know, you know, arms and
[1:09:23] deeds which she did. And, you know, she
[1:09:24] got sick and died and, you know, they
[1:09:26] called Peter to come and raise her from
[1:09:27] the dead. And before he did, you know,
[1:09:29] they would show him of all the coats and
[1:09:31] garments that Dorcas or Tabatha made
[1:09:33] while she was with them. So, here was
[1:09:35] just a sister full of the Holy Ghost and
[1:09:37] she was being a blessing to the people
[1:09:39] everyday kind of life. I'm making this.
[1:09:41] I'm sewing this. I'm selling this. I'm
[1:09:43] doing this. She was part of the body. We
[1:09:46] all have a function. We're all important
[1:09:49] in the body of Christ. I I I trust
[1:09:52] you're with me uh this afternoon. Amen.
[1:09:54] See, it's more than just preaching or
[1:09:55] anything like that. No, we're all part
[1:09:57] of the body. You see, and it doesn't
[1:10:00] matter what age we are, you're important
[1:10:02] to God. Amen. Every age, young, old, in
[1:10:05] between, you're all important. But the
[1:10:07] thing is we get to a stage where you
[1:10:09] know there always comes a time when the
[1:10:10] next generation rises up. Amen. And
[1:10:14] that's a very exciting time for me for a
[1:10:17] younger generation to step up and take
[1:10:19] their place. Amen. To see young people
[1:10:21] have a revival. I mean see the same God
[1:10:23] that called us calls them. Amen. The
[1:10:25] same God gives you the same experiences
[1:10:27] now does the same thing for them. Where
[1:10:28] they see this word as a reality where it
[1:10:31] becomes more than your story. It becomes
[1:10:32] their story. More than your testimony
[1:10:34] becomes their testimony. where they see
[1:10:36] the living God living in them. And I say
[1:10:40] we must be very careful how we treat our
[1:10:42] young people. We never want to sell them
[1:10:44] a gospel that doesn't work. Amen. We
[1:10:46] want to give them a gospel that produces
[1:10:48] what it says it will do. Amen. That they
[1:10:50] can stand and they can say this day.
[1:10:52] Amen. The blood of Jesus Christ
[1:10:54] cleanses. This day Calvary works. This
[1:10:57] day the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:10:59] true. This day God's word is right. It's
[1:11:01] true. And it's here to meet every need.
[1:11:04] Amen.
[1:11:05] You see, but what happens is many times
[1:11:07] we'll swing from one extreme to the
[1:11:09] other. David was a time when he was
[1:11:11] fighting and he got old and you know he
[1:11:13] was fighting against the Philistines and
[1:11:14] you know he got tired in the battle and
[1:11:16] one of one of the sons of Goliath nearly
[1:11:19] killed him and actually thought he did
[1:11:21] that Abashai um um got up his sword and
[1:11:23] he killed that giant and he helped David
[1:11:25] but then they told David after the
[1:11:27] battle he says thou shalt know thou
[1:11:29] shalt go no more out uh with us to
[1:11:32] battle that thou quench not the light of
[1:11:34] Israel you know what they should have
[1:11:36] done they should have said David don't
[1:11:38] be in the front anymore
[1:11:39] We need you in our ranks. Amen. We need
[1:11:42] you in our ranks because you think about
[1:11:43] it now. Here's here's David. What a
[1:11:46] powerful testimony just to be among
[1:11:50] them. Here's here's the king of Here's
[1:11:53] the king of Israel. Man after God's own
[1:11:55] heart. He slew a lion, slew bear, killed
[1:11:58] Goliath. Has these mighty testimonies
[1:12:00] would would pick up his harp and play a
[1:12:02] song and God would come down and amen do
[1:12:05] all these mighty things. But you see,
[1:12:07] they told them to stay home. We're not
[1:12:09] called to stay home. We're called to
[1:12:11] come to the battle. What was that? Come
[1:12:12] to church. Come to church. Be part of a
[1:12:15] body. Amen. Don't stay home. Be part of
[1:12:18] a body. Say, "Well, I'm not important."
[1:12:21] Your testimony is important. Amen. You
[1:12:23] think about the testimony you carry. You
[1:12:25] may take it for granted, but someone may
[1:12:27] just be admiring what you've just come
[1:12:29] through, and you're still a believer.
[1:12:31] And it gives them strength. It
[1:12:32] encourages them. Amen. Amen. Praise the
[1:12:35] Lord. Goliath, you know, Goliath rallied
[1:12:38] or or or gave morale to the Philistines
[1:12:41] when he was in the battle. I I asked the
[1:12:43] question, how much more the Lord's
[1:12:45] anointed? That's in our midst. You say,
[1:12:47] "Just little old me. What have I done?"
[1:12:49] You've got a testimony. Your testimony
[1:12:51] is powerful. You say, "Well, I've I was
[1:12:54] just raised in church. I gave my life to
[1:12:55] God and God." That's powerful.
[1:12:58] Amen. God's kept you. Amen. God's
[1:13:01] protected you. God's been walking with
[1:13:03] you since a young child. Don't let
[1:13:04] anyone or the devil especially diminish
[1:13:06] that.
[1:13:08] Amen. I mean, you're an encouragement
[1:13:11] when you come to church. Amen. With your
[1:13:13] praying and with your amening and being
[1:13:15] being part of the body. We all need one
[1:13:17] another. But you see that Israel came to
[1:13:20] a place in that in that season where
[1:13:22] there had to be more giant killers
[1:13:23] raised up. So David had to get a place
[1:13:26] where he waxed faint because he had to
[1:13:27] diminish and then the others had to
[1:13:29] raise up to their position because you
[1:13:31] know you think about it what's more
[1:13:33] important well what's what's better one
[1:13:35] giant killer or four? Well five counting
[1:13:38] David I'd rather five you see so David
[1:13:42] had to diminish a bit for these young
[1:13:44] ones to step into their position. Amen.
[1:13:46] So we must not stop the young people
[1:13:48] raising up because there's giant killers
[1:13:51] in these few rows here. These young
[1:13:52] there's giant killers here. Amen. Have a
[1:13:55] testimony that God God lives.
[1:13:58] Hallelujah.
[1:13:59] Amen. See, my heart's desire is just say
[1:14:02] for argument sake, someone comes into my
[1:14:04] church and they can take the with with a
[1:14:07] true pastoral gift and they can take the
[1:14:09] people further than I ever could. I'd
[1:14:11] say, "Praise God."
[1:14:14] Take us on further. And I'm not going to
[1:14:17] stay at home. I'll support unless God
[1:14:18] calls me somewhere else. But you know
[1:14:19] what I mean, right? We want we want the
[1:14:21] next generation to rise up above
[1:14:23] ourselves.
[1:14:24] Amen. We ain't the apex. There's more to
[1:14:26] grow in this thing.
[1:14:28] Hallelujah.
[1:14:30] Amen. But you see, now what happens is
[1:14:32] is uh men are a funny creature. All the
[1:14:36] sisters said amen
[1:14:38] quietly. We're a funny
[1:14:41] creature. We go from extremes. You see,
[1:14:43] David went from the front line to
[1:14:45] sitting at home. He didn't he didn't
[1:14:48] actually weigh up the situation and said
[1:14:49] actually no no I'm valuable in the
[1:14:51] battle maybe not at the front but you
[1:14:53] know just I'm I'm valuable my presence
[1:14:55] just here is going to make an impact but
[1:14:57] you see he stayed at home now the thing
[1:14:59] is that men are funny in a way is that
[1:15:02] is that they want to if they're not
[1:15:05] careful we will become like Elohim the
[1:15:08] self-existing one with his
[1:15:13] thoughts if we're not careful and this
[1:15:15] is what this modern world wants to do.
[1:15:18] It wants to make us think there's no
[1:15:20] more adventure in life. Suburban,
[1:15:22] boring, you know, if you live I live in
[1:15:24] suburbia, but you know what I mean? Like
[1:15:26] like it's just this there's nowhere to
[1:15:28] explore in here,
[1:15:30] right? The devil has tried to sell the
[1:15:33] gospel to to to us as men, saying just
[1:15:36] be a good boy and you've made it. That
[1:15:39] ain't the gospel. We should be good
[1:15:42] boys, but it ain't just behaving. That's
[1:15:44] that that's even not it. No, no. There's
[1:15:46] Brother Bram says there's untapped
[1:15:48] resources in God that man have not
[1:15:51] tapped into yet. So you see what happens
[1:15:53] is is is God See, the devil wants to
[1:15:56] make us like God was before there was
[1:15:57] anything. God existed with his thoughts
[1:16:00] alone. Was he happy that
[1:16:02] way? No. Well, how do I know he wasn't
[1:16:06] happy that way? I'm here. He wanted
[1:16:08] someone to express himself to. You see
[1:16:12] he had
[1:16:13] see I don't any but you see what happens
[1:16:17] is man what the devil wants to make man
[1:16:20] alone with his thoughts God never
[1:16:22] intended us to to God never intended to
[1:16:25] stay that way he doesn't want us to
[1:16:28] become that way just alone or she does
[1:16:32] they don't understand me she doesn't
[1:16:33] understand me my nothing box is where I
[1:16:36] can bounce around in and that's all fine
[1:16:39] no we don't want to stay in our nothing
[1:16:40] box.
[1:16:42] Someone's got to break the cycle
[1:16:45] of this, right? So, because what happens
[1:16:48] is, you know, man comes to a certain age
[1:16:49] and then they think, well, you know,
[1:16:51] they've been pursuing for so long. They
[1:16:53] pursued their wife, now they got
[1:16:55] children, their children get to a
[1:16:57] certain age, their career comes to a
[1:16:58] certain plateau point and they just
[1:17:00] begin to say, "I'm finished." I tell you
[1:17:02] what, now that's when you just start.
[1:17:05] Amen. That's when you just start. Don't
[1:17:07] start withdrawing within yourself,
[1:17:09] becoming a self-existing one just with
[1:17:11] your thoughts. No, we've got to go
[1:17:13] beyond that. See, David, see, see, you
[1:17:16] know, I was thinking about this driving
[1:17:17] here. What is more valuable to you? Your
[1:17:21] nothing box or your family?
[1:17:24] You make your actions actually prove
[1:17:26] what you value more? Because if you're
[1:17:29] alone with your thoughts, your nothing
[1:17:31] box is more important to you than your
[1:17:32] family.
[1:17:34] And that's how the devil wants you to
[1:17:36] be.
[1:17:38] We're not called to live in our nothing
[1:17:40] box. It's called a nothing box for a
[1:17:42] reason. You can fill out the rest of the
[1:17:45] sentence. There's no value. There's
[1:17:46] nothing of value in it. Okay? We got to
[1:17:49] go beyond that. Every part of life is a
[1:17:52] is is an opportunity to express the word
[1:17:56] of God, how we feel. I'm sorry we've
[1:17:58] gone pastoral here, but here we are.
[1:18:00] This is just I've been thinking about
[1:18:01] these things. See, we got to go beyond
[1:18:02] these things where we don't just settle
[1:18:04] down. Because you see, David had spent
[1:18:06] all these years fighting and building
[1:18:07] the kingdom, but then he decided to stay
[1:18:09] at home and he spent too much time
[1:18:12] looking from his balcony at what his
[1:18:13] neighbors were doing. And that's where
[1:18:16] Bashibba came in because he decided to
[1:18:19] sit at home. He had to go beyond those
[1:18:22] things. We all have a position in the
[1:18:25] body. I tell you what, never let
[1:18:28] jealousy rob you. Amen. I may be
[1:18:30] segueing somewhere, but the thing is, if
[1:18:32] you're jealous of someone else doing
[1:18:33] well, that's not the spirit of God.
[1:18:36] Amen. If you're jealous of people got a
[1:18:38] payriseise or a new job or a better
[1:18:40] house or a better car, that's a jealous
[1:18:42] spirit that came out of hell. That
[1:18:44] doesn't belong in your life. You don't
[1:18:46] need it. It ain't going to help you
[1:18:48] fulfill the word of God or live a happy,
[1:18:50] victorious life. Amen. You sit there
[1:18:52] with your own thoughts singing, "No one
[1:18:53] understands me." Get out of that comfort
[1:18:55] zone.
[1:18:57] Amen.
[1:18:58] Why? Because we're all a valuable part
[1:19:00] of the body.
[1:19:03] Amen. See, don't stay at home. See,
[1:19:06] brother Bam says this in Jehovah Jar 57.
[1:19:08] He says there's nothing good in any of
[1:19:09] us. But when you forget about preachers
[1:19:11] and personalities and look at the Lord
[1:19:12] Jesus Christ, then you're going to get
[1:19:14] somewhere. Take God at his word. See,
[1:19:17] people say, "Oh, but the preachers like
[1:19:18] this or the church is like this." Look
[1:19:19] beyond that. We all I've given you a
[1:19:23] lifetime ammunition of faults, right?
[1:19:25] Since I've been standing here, something
[1:19:26] to criticize. Look beyond the the thing
[1:19:29] to criticize.
[1:19:31] Look beyond and look to the promise of
[1:19:32] God.
[1:19:35] Amen. But you see now, but we live in a
[1:19:37] time where man wants to be stuck in a
[1:19:40] nothing box. But I tell it's time to
[1:19:42] bust out.
[1:19:44] Do
[1:19:46] differently. Amen. We live in a season
[1:19:48] where God is here to fulfill his word.
[1:19:50] So I'm just going to come back to what I
[1:19:51] was speaking about. Now, the armor
[1:19:53] company girl,
[1:19:55] she spent many years as a as an orphan
[1:19:58] working on her cousin's farm and all
[1:20:00] these things, just being basically their
[1:20:01] slave. But there came a moment in her
[1:20:03] life that changed her life forever. She
[1:20:06] was washing dishes. She wasn't part of
[1:20:08] the party, you know, with the, you know,
[1:20:09] the armor company boy came to the ranch
[1:20:11] and and and her cousins were trying to
[1:20:14] get him to marry marry them and all
[1:20:15] these things. They had a big hoown
[1:20:17] shindig and, you know, she wasn't
[1:20:18] invited. She was she was pouring out
[1:20:20] dish water while the music's blaring in
[1:20:22] the barn and all these things. And he
[1:20:24] slipped out and saw her and they begin
[1:20:27] to have a conversation and he said to
[1:20:29] her, "You know, I've been noticing you
[1:20:31] around and and and and he just proposed
[1:20:33] to her. Will you marry me?" And she
[1:20:36] thought, "How on earth could this, you
[1:20:37] know, this kind of a guy want me?"
[1:20:40] Didn't you feel that same way the Lord
[1:20:42] when the Lord found you?
[1:20:44] But he said, "I see quality in you that
[1:20:46] they don't have." And there's a quality
[1:20:49] in you and I that is greater than what
[1:20:51] the world has. There's that gene seed of
[1:20:53] God in you. I mean, that quality, that
[1:20:56] God part of you that's in you before the
[1:20:58] foundation of the world. That thing is
[1:20:59] what the Lord is looking for. He's
[1:21:01] looking for parts of himself. You know,
[1:21:04] I know I've said this before, but you
[1:21:05] know, there are times when I would used
[1:21:06] to go to the girls primary school and
[1:21:08] pick them up from school and, you know,
[1:21:10] I would get to their classroom before
[1:21:11] the bell went. They couldn't see me
[1:21:13] there, but I could see them. When I went
[1:21:16] into that school, I wasn't looking for
[1:21:18] just any young girl. I wasn't looking
[1:21:20] even just for a girl the same age as my
[1:21:22] girls. I was looking for them.
[1:21:24] Hallelujah. And I wasn't leaving the
[1:21:26] grounds until they came home with me.
[1:21:28] And it's the same thing with this, you
[1:21:30] know, with our Lord Jesus Christ. He
[1:21:32] ain't just looking for anybody. Anybody
[1:21:34] can come, but he ain't looking for
[1:21:35] anybody. He's looking for his bride.
[1:21:37] He's looking for people like you and I.
[1:21:39] Amen. Washed in his blood with that seed
[1:21:41] of God on the inside of them. Amen.
[1:21:44] Hallelujah. So now he came to her and
[1:21:48] said and said now will you marry me? And
[1:21:51] of course she said yes. And he said in a
[1:21:53] year's time I'm going to come back take
[1:21:57] you to Chicago. You won't live here
[1:21:59] anymore. So basically he said when you
[1:22:01] see the same season come back around
[1:22:03] again I'm going to come get you. Now she
[1:22:07] would live a year in the same house
[1:22:10] doing the same chores living the same
[1:22:12] old life. But he he had given her his
[1:22:15] word of promise and she believed that
[1:22:18] word of promise. And this message is the
[1:22:20] word of promise of almighty God to you
[1:22:22] saying, "I ain't going to leave you
[1:22:23] here. I ain't going to let you go
[1:22:25] through a great tribulation. My blood
[1:22:27] works." Amen. Calvary is Amen. has
[1:22:30] produced a people that will not taste
[1:22:32] death, but will go into rapture. Amen.
[1:22:35] So, so she was given his word of
[1:22:37] promise. I'm coming back for you in a
[1:22:39] year. So, now she had a year now. Maybe,
[1:22:41] you know, I'd like to think that that
[1:22:43] that um uh it was springtime when he
[1:22:47] came and proposed to her. I just like to
[1:22:49] think it's
[1:22:50] springtime. Sounds nice. Not winter. No,
[1:22:53] springtime. Maybe that's just me. So,
[1:22:55] she realized when that same season comes
[1:22:57] back around again, he's coming back to
[1:23:00] get me. Amen. So, so you know, she
[1:23:02] realized that, you know, she goes
[1:23:04] through summer, she ain't going to live
[1:23:05] through it again. Autumn comes, she
[1:23:08] ain't going to live through another
[1:23:09] autumn again. There's a difference in
[1:23:11] her life now cuz she's got a word of
[1:23:13] promise, right? There become, you know,
[1:23:15] winter and doesn't and it didn't matter
[1:23:17] how cold the winter got. Didn't matter
[1:23:18] how much the w, you know, cold winds
[1:23:21] blow of trouble and unbelief and all
[1:23:23] these things. She ain't going to go
[1:23:24] through it again. Amen. Why? Because she
[1:23:27] was holding on to his word of promise.
[1:23:30] Amen. Because his word of promise broke
[1:23:32] the cycle of the mundane in her life.
[1:23:35] Sure, she did the same thing. Sure, she
[1:23:37] lived the same kind of life, but it was
[1:23:38] different. Now, why? because he was
[1:23:40] coming back for her. I pray we have that
[1:23:42] same kind of thing anchored in our
[1:23:44] souls. He's coming back for me.
[1:23:47] Amen. He's coming back for me. So I say
[1:23:49] this, whatever season that your life is
[1:23:51] in, make the most of it. Enjoy being a
[1:23:55] child. Play till your heart's
[1:23:59] content. Okay. Okay. Well, children, you
[1:24:03] guys have toys? Help me out
[1:24:05] someone. We have to go buy some
[1:24:08] toys. Enjoy being a teenager.
[1:24:12] Amen. If you're a single adult, enjoy
[1:24:15] being single. Enjoy it. Amen. If you get
[1:24:18] married, enjoy marriage life. Enjoy
[1:24:20] every stage of it. Never let your spouse
[1:24:22] become common to you. Amen. When
[1:24:25] children come along, enjoy them. They
[1:24:27] will never be that age again. We know
[1:24:30] some with toddlers are saying, "Praise
[1:24:31] God, but for a different
[1:24:34] reason." But they'll never be that age
[1:24:36] again. I remember when my eldest I used
[1:24:39] to have to actually bend over to hold
[1:24:40] her hand as we walked. She ain't that
[1:24:42] age anymore. Why? She's grown up.
[1:24:46] Hallelujah. She was that age once. Enjoy
[1:24:48] that age. Whatever age they are. Well,
[1:24:50] you say now they're growing up children.
[1:24:52] Enjoy them as adults. Don't take it for
[1:24:54] granted. God has given us one life.
[1:24:57] Amen. You get grandchildren. Enjoy them.
[1:25:00] Spoil them real
[1:25:02] good. Hallelujah. You say, "Well, now
[1:25:05] I'm old. Now my best years are behind
[1:25:07] me. No way. I miss the good old days.
[1:25:10] Right now should be the best day. Right
[1:25:12] now should be the best day. Amen. This
[1:25:15] should be the best time of life right
[1:25:17] now. You know, it's like brother
[1:25:18] Bosworth, he was he was on his deathbed
[1:25:20] and you know, brother Bram went to go
[1:25:21] see him and you know, brother Bosworth
[1:25:24] um you know was asked by brother Bram,
[1:25:25] "Can I pray for you?" And brother
[1:25:26] Bosworth said, "No, I'm not sick." And
[1:25:28] then so Brother Bram asked him, "Well,
[1:25:30] what's wrong?" Brother Bosworth just
[1:25:31] said, "Well, I'm just going home." And
[1:25:34] you know, And then he asked so so so
[1:25:36] brother asked him what is the greatest
[1:25:38] time of your life and your ministry is
[1:25:41] it when we're in South Africa is it when
[1:25:43] you saw demons cast out people heal
[1:25:45] people come to the Lord all these things
[1:25:46] he said no right now is the best time of
[1:25:51] my life because all I've lived for
[1:25:53] brother has been Jesus Christ and any
[1:25:55] minute he'll walk in the door to take me
[1:25:57] home.
[1:25:59] We don't have to get old for that to be
[1:26:00] fulfilled. He could come in right this
[1:26:03] afternoon. that'll be fine by me. But in
[1:26:06] the meantime, live every day and cherish
[1:26:08] every day. Don't take every day for
[1:26:10] granted. There's a purpose in every day.
[1:26:13] Amen. This bride's revival should be
[1:26:15] lived in everyday life. Amen. No matter
[1:26:17] what you're going through, what you're
[1:26:19] facing, it's a precious moment. It's a
[1:26:22] precious season. You may never go
[1:26:24] through this season
[1:26:26] again. Amen. So, don't ever take it for
[1:26:28] granted. Well, I'm going through a
[1:26:30] trial. Yeah, you're going through a
[1:26:31] trial. You ain't ending up in that
[1:26:33] trial. You're going through it. Amen. We
[1:26:36] should be living under expectation that
[1:26:38] at any moment he'll come and take us
[1:26:41] home. Because the armor company girl, he
[1:26:44] she got to the end of winter. And then
[1:26:47] the and then the wind begin to change.
[1:26:50] The daylight got longer. The buds begin
[1:26:52] to come on the tree. Life came back into
[1:26:54] the tree again. There's a restoration of
[1:26:57] the bride tree. Amen. In this season,
[1:26:59] God be to move again. It wasn't the
[1:27:01] coldness of winter and splits and fusses
[1:27:03] and fighters, you know, all these false
[1:27:05] doctrines. No, the sun had risen.
[1:27:08] Hallelujah. The sun, the word has risen.
[1:27:11] Amen. The word has risen again. The
[1:27:13] temperature has raised. I'm talking
[1:27:16] spiritually now because we know we're in
[1:27:17] autumn time, right? But spiritually, we
[1:27:18] ain't in an autumn time. Amen. We're in
[1:27:21] a season where the season has come back
[1:27:23] around again. Where the same God that
[1:27:25] was with the prophet is with us now in
[1:27:27] reality.
[1:27:28] Amen. We've come back into that season.
[1:27:31] Amen. Where all things are possible.
[1:27:33] We've come back into the season of the
[1:27:34] spirit of God moving.
[1:27:37] We've come back into a I say this day,
[1:27:40] I'm not I don't think I'm crazy. I think
[1:27:42] I know where I am in the scripture. I
[1:27:44] believe we've come back into that season
[1:27:45] where God where we've come back to a
[1:27:47] place where we realize we are saved by
[1:27:49] grace. God found me. He's kept me. He's
[1:27:52] moving me. He's living in my life. It's
[1:27:53] nothing I have done. It's all him. What?
[1:27:56] That that's a springtime coming back
[1:27:58] again. Amen. It's a time when the first
[1:28:00] love has been restored back into the
[1:28:02] church. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:28:05] Why? Because God is saying that now in
[1:28:07] this season, be under
[1:28:09] expectation. I'm coming to take you
[1:28:12] home. Amen. Where the full word is in
[1:28:14] manifestation again. Where we've gone
[1:28:16] back. We've gone back. Grain has
[1:28:18] returned again. We're living in a bride
[1:28:21] age, an age within an age as we heard
[1:28:22] this morning. Hallelujah. I'm so
[1:28:24] thankful for that. I'm so glad we're not
[1:28:25] in Lady Oia. We've been lifted up above
[1:28:28] it. We may be walking in it, but we're
[1:28:29] not part of it. Amen. Why? Because the
[1:28:32] anointing of God is so great. You know,
[1:28:33] God, I love it how he does it. God says,
[1:28:36] "I'm going to prove Calvary to his
[1:28:38] enemy." Well, how you going to do that?
[1:28:40] I'm going to make I'm going to let you,
[1:28:42] Satan, make this world the worst it's
[1:28:44] ever been.
[1:28:45] And I'm going to put her in that age.
[1:28:48] Everything's going to be against her,
[1:28:49] and she's going to walk out victorious.
[1:28:52] She's going to be an overcomer. She's
[1:28:54] going to put you under her feet. She's
[1:28:56] going to believe my word. She's going to
[1:28:58] go through many trials and dangers and
[1:29:00] hardship and pain and sorrow. Yet, she
[1:29:02] will still believe me. And there's
[1:29:04] nothing you can do, Satan, to stop her.
[1:29:06] You'll throw everything you can at her,
[1:29:08] but you can't stop her. Hallelujah. This
[1:29:11] day,
[1:29:13] amen. I say that is fulfilled. You know,
[1:29:15] Brother Ram said that a man can be so
[1:29:16] surrendered to God, even the devil don't
[1:29:18] know what to do with
[1:29:20] him. He'll try everything he can. Still
[1:29:24] standing. Why? Because of your ability.
[1:29:27] No way. Because of his ability. Amen. We
[1:29:30] would all be gone if it wasn't for him
[1:29:32] without our Lord.
[1:29:35] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. You say,
[1:29:38] "Well, what happens when things go
[1:29:40] things just go seem to go so wrong?"
[1:29:43] Well, you know, there was a lady lady um
[1:29:45] you know, in the message her her husband
[1:29:47] Julius Stadcliffe wrote the book Prophet
[1:29:49] Visit South Africa. And you know, they
[1:29:51] had a baby. They were living in Germany
[1:29:52] at the time. They were working for the
[1:29:53] American military. and they had this
[1:29:55] baby, but then the baby passed away. And
[1:29:58] and and they they they they spoke to the
[1:30:01] leader of the army or whoever it was
[1:30:02] that to to to arrange a jet plane to get
[1:30:05] brother from America, fly over to
[1:30:07] Germany, pray for the baby, come back to
[1:30:08] life, and then and then brother to go
[1:30:11] back home. That was all arranged. But
[1:30:13] the Lord told brother Bram, "Don't touch
[1:30:15] that. That's my hand." And so she has to
[1:30:18] uh sorry, he has to call Mrs. Stadcliffe
[1:30:20] and say, "Sorry, this is the hand of the
[1:30:22] Lord." and they bury their baby there in
[1:30:24] Germany. And I don't know how long
[1:30:26] later, you know, brother Brown meets
[1:30:28] them. And you know, she asked a
[1:30:31] question. Didn't I have enough faith for
[1:30:34] my baby to be to be
[1:30:37] raised? And you know, was it a weakness
[1:30:39] of my faith? But he said to her, you
[1:30:42] have great faith. You prayed for your
[1:30:44] baby and your husband held on to God to
[1:30:46] raise that baby and he refused to do it
[1:30:48] because he knows what is best. And still
[1:30:50] you love him.
[1:30:52] still you love him.
[1:30:54] I'm sure we could put maybe not that
[1:30:56] thing of that magnitude. Maybe some of
[1:30:58] us have been through it, but there's
[1:30:59] still there's things that have happened
[1:31:00] in life and it seems like God has not
[1:31:02] answered the prayer, but yet we still
[1:31:04] love him. I trust we can be Christians
[1:31:07] when God says no, we still love him.
[1:31:10] It's easy when when when when it's just
[1:31:12] yes and there's no problems, but when it
[1:31:15] comes to no, when God says no, we still
[1:31:18] love him. Brother M says that's real
[1:31:21] faith. Remember, we've been restored
[1:31:23] back to the faith of the fathers. That's
[1:31:24] real faith. Anybody when the mountains
[1:31:26] are moving and things can have faith,
[1:31:28] but let it go backwards one time and see
[1:31:31] how it works. That's when you'll prove
[1:31:33] whether you got faith or not. Praise
[1:31:36] God. Hallelujah. I'm so thankful that
[1:31:38] I'm going to I'm going to wind this up
[1:31:40] real
[1:31:42] soon. Amen. But you see
[1:31:45] now, you know, the unseen world. I was
[1:31:47] going to finish with this. We've had a
[1:31:50] prophet stand in this age and he's
[1:31:51] standing. He says, "I'm standing in two
[1:31:53] worlds. I'm standing on the platform,
[1:31:55] but then I can see the eternal world."
[1:31:58] And he said, and he said many times,
[1:31:59] "Can't you see that pillar of fire over
[1:32:01] that person?" Many people couldn't see
[1:32:03] into that world, but they felt the
[1:32:05] effects of the pillar of fire and they'd
[1:32:07] be very moved and God would speak to
[1:32:09] them and change their lives. Now, we
[1:32:11] know that that same pillar of fire is
[1:32:13] here. He He said, "I'll never leave you
[1:32:15] nor forsake you." He said, "Where two or
[1:32:17] three are gathered, there I am in the
[1:32:18] midst." So he's present in this room.
[1:32:20] We're gathered in his name, are we not?
[1:32:22] Hallelujah. And then he and then he and
[1:32:24] then brother Ram would say, you know,
[1:32:25] people would say, "I just don't
[1:32:26] understand what's going on." And but
[1:32:28] then he then he would say, "And go awake
[1:32:30] Jesus. Certainly he lives." He says that
[1:32:33] what's this you're bumping into all the
[1:32:35] time? What's that condemns you when
[1:32:37] you're wrong? What makes you believe?
[1:32:40] That's him.
[1:32:42] Amen. And so we're walking on in life
[1:32:43] and we're just bumping bumping into God.
[1:32:47] Amen. He convicts us when we're wrong to
[1:32:49] make things right. And he causes us to
[1:32:50] believe his word and it's us bumping
[1:32:52] into God. And I'll say, you know, he
[1:32:54] says, "Yo, I feel a strange feeling here
[1:32:56] tonight." Looks to me like, "Yo, I want
[1:32:58] to cry or shout or something." He says,
[1:33:00] "That's the angels of the Lord affecting
[1:33:03] people." Amen. And to me now, what is
[1:33:05] it? It is it is it is eternity bumping
[1:33:08] into God's children. I say it's your
[1:33:11] theophony. If I put it this way, it's
[1:33:13] your theophony bumping into you. It
[1:33:16] bumps into you. You give your life,
[1:33:17] bumps into you, get baptized, bumps into
[1:33:19] you, make things right, bumps into you,
[1:33:21] you receive the Holy Ghost, you know,
[1:33:23] but eventually, but you see now as God
[1:33:25] is pouring out his spirit more and
[1:33:27] more, we're being bumped into more and
[1:33:29] more. And what's going to happen then
[1:33:31] one day, it's not just going to be a
[1:33:32] bump. It's going to be a molding
[1:33:35] together where it's going to carry us
[1:33:37] out of this dimension. You know, heaven
[1:33:39] is not that far away. is just a faster
[1:33:41] dimension about this high, brother Ram
[1:33:43] said. And it's been influencing you your
[1:33:45] entire life. Hallelujah. And what's it
[1:33:48] going to do? Carry you away.
[1:33:54] Hallelujah. I say praise. I say this
[1:33:57] day. This day many more scriptures are
[1:34:00] fulfilled in this day. I say in your
[1:34:03] life, many scriptures have been
[1:34:05] fulfilled.
[1:34:07] Amen. The full power of the blood has
[1:34:08] been displayed in your life this day.
[1:34:10] Why are you? Cuz you're a believer in
[1:34:12] Lady Oia. You're a believer in Satan's
[1:34:14] Eden. That's a victory in itself. It's a
[1:34:16] glorious thing. A to be a Christian in
[1:34:18] this day filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:20] That's a that's a glorious thing.
[1:34:24] Amen. Brother A says how to overcome.
[1:34:26] Keep life in you. I'm just going to
[1:34:28] close with these thoughts. Maybe we can
[1:34:29] have the musicians come. Don't want to
[1:34:30] be too long. He says to overcome is to
[1:34:33] keep life in you. Amen. So let the he
[1:34:36] said he said that's how so how do you
[1:34:38] keep the life of God in you? Keep the
[1:34:40] Holy Ghost around you. Never let a
[1:34:42] critical spirit get on you. Never be
[1:34:45] negative. Never be never be negative.
[1:34:47] Never never confess what the devil wants
[1:34:49] you to confess. No, you're more than an
[1:34:51] overcomer. You're more than a conqueror.
[1:34:55] Amen. This is the day when divine love
[1:34:57] is projected and sovereign grace takes
[1:34:59] its
[1:35:00] place. This is the day. this day. I know
[1:35:03] I've shared this before, but I'll share
[1:35:05] it again because you know, so I was in
[1:35:06] the Solomon Islands over a year ago in
[1:35:08] March and we were on this little island
[1:35:10] and you know, um, I was there with a
[1:35:12] brother from Melbourne, Brother Jim
[1:35:14] Carman. And, you know, I woke up one
[1:35:16] morning and he was praying for people
[1:35:17] downstairs outside and I heard the
[1:35:19] scream and it was a teenage girl, but it
[1:35:22] was unearly scream. It wasn't a human
[1:35:24] scream. And so I got up and I went down
[1:35:26] and, you know, he's, you know, he's
[1:35:27] dealing with this with this teenage girl
[1:35:29] and she's totally out of her mind. You
[1:35:31] can only see the white of her eyes.
[1:35:33] She's writhing and screaming and
[1:35:34] shouting. And I I asked her, "What is
[1:35:36] your name?" And she said, she just said,
[1:35:38] "My name is Satan." Screaming, "My name
[1:35:41] is Satan. My name is Satan." And so we
[1:35:43] prayed for her and she just passed out.
[1:35:45] And brother Jim Carman said, "Well, is
[1:35:46] she free?" I said, "No, I've seen this
[1:35:48] before. It's just the spirit making her
[1:35:50] cast out that I mean making her pass out
[1:35:52] that she won't be free." So prayed for
[1:35:54] her again. She came back just screaming
[1:35:56] and shouting and writhing and just so
[1:35:58] angry. And I thought to myself, what can
[1:36:00] I do,
[1:36:02] Lord? What can I do? But then such a
[1:36:06] love and compassion came over my life
[1:36:07] for her. This is just just anchored in
[1:36:09] my heart. The same blood that Jesus shed
[1:36:11] for me is the same blood was shed for
[1:36:14] her. And then I prayed for I just felt
[1:36:17] the love of God and that spirit was cast
[1:36:20] out of her life and she walked away from
[1:36:22] that normal healthy sound mind. Well,
[1:36:25] why? Cuz divine love was projected. and
[1:36:28] sovereign grace took its place. Amen.
[1:36:31] That's what go We live in this season
[1:36:34] this day. And I'm sure it's happened
[1:36:36] many different people many different
[1:36:37] ways. But you see, God wants sovereign
[1:36:39] divine love to be projected. That's why
[1:36:42] don't hate one another. Don't despise.
[1:36:44] Don't be resentful. Don't look down on
[1:36:46] anyone. Let the divine love of
[1:36:49] God take over and then sovereign grace
[1:36:52] can step in, take its place, and do what
[1:36:54] God wants to do. Amen. We live in this
[1:36:56] season. I say this day all these things
[1:37:00] are fulfilled in our lives. So what can
[1:37:02] we do? We say thank you Lord. Thank you
[1:37:05] you found me. Thank you you've kept me.
[1:37:07] Thank you guiding me. Thank you you're
[1:37:09] opening your word to me. Thank you Lord.
[1:37:11] You've you you've saved me from many
[1:37:13] things. I've been in trouble and you and
[1:37:15] you saved me. I've been confused and you
[1:37:16] brought me a right mind. I was sick and
[1:37:18] you healed me. I was hungry and you fed
[1:37:21] me. I felt unlovable but you loved me.
[1:37:23] Lord, you've been so good. Hallelujah.
[1:37:26] Let's stand. Amen. This afternoon. Amen.

[2:03:23] Amen. Amen. Let's just pray this
[2:03:26] afternoon. Just commit the service to
[2:03:27] the Lord.
[2:03:29] Lord, we thank you that we have that
[2:03:31] great promise, Lord, that as we see,
[2:03:34] Lord, the unfolding and the unraveling
[2:03:36] of the world that we're in, Lord, we're
[2:03:39] so thankful that we don't rest our hopes
[2:03:41] here. We don't rest our dreams here. We
[2:03:43] don't rest our value here, Lord. But we
[2:03:45] rest our hope and our dreams and our
[2:03:47] value, Lord, in your everlasting
[2:03:49] kingdom, Lord. And in that in that
[2:03:52] realm, Lord, that's more real than this
[2:03:53] realm. So, we just want to pray you'll
[2:03:54] bless each one as we keep our minds
[2:03:56] focused upon you, Lord, and upon your
[2:03:59] work. As you said when you were here, I
[2:04:02] must be about my father's business. May
[2:04:04] each one of us be about our father's
[2:04:05] business while we're here. We know we've
[2:04:07] got to do this and do that to Lord to
[2:04:10] make things work and and things like
[2:04:11] that. But Lord, may our sole focus be
[2:04:13] upon you. As even that what we heard
[2:04:16] this afternoon, Lord, that brother when
[2:04:18] he was on his FF Bosworth, I believe it
[2:04:20] was, he said, "All all my life I've
[2:04:23] labored for this. I've labored for for
[2:04:24] the for you, Lord. And one day you'll
[2:04:26] come through the door." May that be our
[2:04:28] testimony when we Lord, when it's the
[2:04:30] end of the road, we say, "All my life
[2:04:31] I've labored for the Lord. Now he's
[2:04:32] going to come and meet me." May we not
[2:04:34] quickly try and shore things up just at
[2:04:36] the end. But may we serve you with all
[2:04:37] of our heart now, Lord, and and find
[2:04:39] what our calling is, Lord, and and serve
[2:04:41] you diligently and what you've given us
[2:04:43] and use all our talents for you, Lord.
[2:04:44] So, I just want to pray a blessing upon
[2:04:46] each one as we go away this evening. And
[2:04:48] may we just go rejoicing and walk in
[2:04:50] complete victory in each area of our
[2:04:51] life. We pray we just commit the service
[2:04:53] to your hands in Jesus wonderful name.
[2:04:55] Amen. God bless you. You're dismissed in
[2:04:57] Jesus name this afternoon.
