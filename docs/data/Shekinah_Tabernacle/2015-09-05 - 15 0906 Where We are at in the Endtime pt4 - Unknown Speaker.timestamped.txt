[32:11] [Music]
[32:23] and father I just ask com
[32:28] Lord father you would Quicken the things
[32:30] that you've done us to your blessings
[32:33] and name them one by
[32:37] one
[32:51] father this one Father's Day today so
[32:54] just say a couple of words about your
[32:56] heavenly father
[32:58] and if he's done something for your past
[33:02] really well something that's all signic
[33:04] to you
[33:29] I'll get the ball rolling someone needs
[33:31] to um I just wanted to say how I love my
[33:34] heavenly father um I was thinking this
[33:37] morning I for a speaker's birthday um
[33:39] party this afternoon I was thinking oh
[33:41] like I've been praying that it'll be
[33:42] nice with and then I um I woke up and I
[33:46] thought oh I'll go and like open the
[33:47] curtains and see like what the weather's
[33:49] like and straight away that verse just
[33:52] came that God said to Abraham um regard
[33:54] those things that are as if they're not
[33:56] just came straight into my mind and I
[33:58] thought don't even need to open the
[34:00] curtains like I thought I'll open them
[34:02] it might be perfectly blue and I might
[34:03] open it it might be thunderclouds but it
[34:05] doesn't matter what it looks like
[34:07] because like and I was so I was I like
[34:10] had tears in my eyes I was like thank
[34:11] you Lord I don't even need to look and
[34:13] then I was having my quiet time and then
[34:15] I heard rain just hammering down on the
[34:17] roof and I just like smiled I thought
[34:20] thank you Lord like he knew like it
[34:22] already even prepared me and then and
[34:24] then that and then um gave the children
[34:26] their breakfast and then um open the
[34:29] curtains after that and then blue skies
[34:31] and I was like thank you Lord like just
[34:34] thank you anyway it doesn't matter thank
[34:35] you and um just awesome when it becomes
[34:37] real and it's not just like I should
[34:39] think like this for but it's that anyway
[34:41] I love my heavenly father that's all
[34:59] well I am the uh youngest in the Sunday
[35:01] school I'm seven so I thought I'll just
[35:04] come and say thank you to the Lord as
[35:06] well um so we did a lesson just on my
[35:09] sheep hear my voice and why sheep hears
[35:12] his voice and why they follow him alone
[35:15] but then I just want to be thankful for
[35:17] when we were sitting there actually
[35:19] opened up something to me that that that
[35:23] Shepherd uses a dog to chase you back
[35:26] into the pen
[35:28] cuz it looks like a fierce wolf but it's
[35:31] actually just a dog it's nothing else
[35:33] than a dog and the shepherd can call
[35:36] that dog back anytime and whatever the
[35:38] shepherd wants to do he'll tell that dog
[35:41] what to do and that dog will plank left
[35:43] of flank right but it will get all the
[35:45] Sheep into one nice bundle into the
[35:48] gates which he only can open and which
[35:51] he is the gate and then he can lead you
[35:53] all very safely into that t and you can
[35:56] just stay there overnight very safe so
[35:59] what happened is that dog used to be a
[36:02] wolf but now that dog is only a dog that
[36:06] got me into my position where I should
[36:08] be and the one thing that happened this
[36:11] morning when we I watched this this
[36:13] YouTube video It Happened that that dog
[36:15] cannot go where we go he cannot bite us
[36:18] he cannot hurt us he cannot do anything
[36:21] unless that Shepherd which is our
[36:23] heavenly father tells him to do it and
[36:27] that's why the Book of Job kind of tied
[36:28] into it as well and it's it's just
[36:31] wonderful to see that when God reveals
[36:33] something to you and just shows you that
[36:35] he's in control he's even in control of
[36:38] the dog he's in control of everything so
[36:40] though we see it as this big Fierce wolf
[36:43] it's still just a dog with no bite just
[36:46] a bar so yeah thank you Lord I just want
[36:48] to praise him thank you
[36:56] Dad for
[37:40] spe
[37:57] you
[38:47] amen praise God am I just want to read a
[38:51] scripture of Romans 8:14 it says for as
[38:56] many as are led by the SP spirit of God
[38:58] they are the sons of God and then in
[39:00] verse 18 it says for I reckon that the
[39:02] suffering of this present time are not
[39:05] worthy to be compared with the glory we
[39:07] be revealed in us so yes what a
[39:10] wonderful scripture we are laid by the
[39:11] spirit of God so we the sons of God Amen
[39:14] I'm just I'm just so blessed this
[39:15] morning um you know it's just so
[39:17] wonderful to to be called The Son of God
[39:20] Amen
[39:21] um we've had a wonderful week just been
[39:24] so blessed in the pray meeting or colge
[39:26] meeting on on Wednesday evening and um
[39:30] yeah I'm just I'm just studying uh I'm
[39:32] reading Applause in a moment so I don't
[39:34] know how many times I've gone through it
[39:37] and um you know God is just showing us
[39:39] new things showing us his his plan
[39:41] showing us his remarkable
[39:43] blessings and um it's amazing that a
[39:45] father always want to do good for his uh
[39:49] children as the sister just testified as
[39:51] well so um and you know I think it's as
[39:54] uh any good father brother also any good
[39:58] father would like to leave an
[39:59] inheritance for his children he would
[40:01] like to leave something behind um and
[40:03] that that is a character of a good
[40:05] father he says and um he says that's
[40:07] that that's the character of that father
[40:09] being able to be a provider being able
[40:11] to leave something behind for that child
[40:13] and and and that gives that child of
[40:16] peace and I was just thinking you know
[40:18] that um uh you know in this whole uning
[40:21] of God uh that was God's plan was to
[40:25] leave something behind because before
[40:28] the natural father came about um there
[40:31] was God you know and God had that plan
[40:33] in he locked up in and and everything
[40:37] that a natural father wants to do is
[40:38] actually a continual expression of what
[40:41] God wanted to do and I was just thinking
[40:43] so what so what is it that God actually
[40:45] wanted to leave behind for me I it
[40:48] couldn't have been this Earth because uh
[40:50] we see just falling to pieces you know
[40:52] it couldn't have be in a house or a car
[40:54] or or anything like this RS away the
[40:58] case I couldn't have been even this body
[41:01] doesn't come from God it was just
[41:02] limited so what did he actually leave
[41:05] behind he actually left behind his very
[41:07] own personal presence and and and that
[41:10] was his inheritance is is to leave leave
[41:14] himself inside of us and and and and I'm
[41:16] just so blessed I am just so blessed
[41:18] brother Brenham says it's it's in
[41:20] unveiling of God it's always always been
[41:23] God's desire it's always been God's
[41:26] desire to be masked to be veiled behind
[41:29] the flesh so so so I'm just so blessed
[41:32] this morning that that that I'm actually
[41:34] the veil of God I'm actually walking on
[41:37] this Earth and and and and that's why
[41:40] brother renam says the unveiling of God
[41:41] is a very great sermon that he preached
[41:44] you know it's it's it was that hidden
[41:47] plan of God all along why he he he said
[41:50] let it be light and that very first
[41:52] spoken word what when he start that
[41:55] creation it was actually the ultimate
[41:58] was so that he could find his abod and
[42:00] his and his hiding place in in man so so
[42:05] I think it's the it's the it's the
[42:06] greatest fathers that we could have is
[42:08] to is to be able to host God to be a
[42:11] host of God we we will never plan to be
[42:14] on the earth to to have a job or
[42:17] anything like that because I Adam and to
[42:19] wear clothing Adam didn't have clothing
[42:21] we were never plan to have a cell phone
[42:23] Adam didn't need a cell phone we were
[42:24] never plann to have a computer that came
[42:27] after the fall God just placed Adam
[42:30] there so if God placed Adam there
[42:32] without a cell phone or anything that
[42:33] means God never intended these things
[42:35] just came after the four and we we have
[42:36] to live with him so God's plan was Adam
[42:40] go about and just continue my work on
[42:42] the earth have dominion over everything
[42:45] so so this morning I believe we are we
[42:47] are set free as the brother sang the
[42:49] song also this morning we are Redeemed
[42:51] by the blood of the Lamb we are we are
[42:54] God's precious chosen vessels to be able
[42:56] to hide in
[42:58] um yeah I'm just so blessed this morning
[42:59] we are the host of God we are the Most
[43:02] Blessed people on the face of the Earth
[43:04] to to realize we've come to that
[43:06] recognition that we are actually the
[43:08] temple of God we are hiding in we are
[43:10] abiding in his presence and he's abiding
[43:13] in us so I believe we will have a
[43:15] wonderful Father's Day um my daughter
[43:18] was so excited Dy Dy it's it's it's
[43:20] Rebecca uh birthday so we want to bless
[43:23] her as well and every little one as well
[43:25] and I trust we'll have a blessed day in
[43:26] the
[43:35] isn't wonderful
[43:38] opportunity God bless you s um I just
[43:42] like to give thanks to the Lord this
[43:43] morning um as we reflect on Father's Day
[43:47] um I come from a broken home my dad left
[43:50] us while I we were quite young I was
[43:52] about two years or two and a half years
[43:53] old um but he's still he's still alive
[43:56] today and uh he doesn't want to have
[43:58] anything to do with me but one thing I
[44:01] can say is that when I found the
[44:03] Lord um I can talk to the Lord and he
[44:06] can talk to me um whether it's in your
[44:09] quiet time or whether it's in your busy
[44:10] time if you got something to say or
[44:12] something to ask he's always listening
[44:14] like this morning I read in uh Psalms I
[44:16] think 116 he's always listening to us
[44:19] sometime we think he's not there but he
[44:21] is um you know having a father is a
[44:25] great thing and and after I found the
[44:28] Lord um my life straightened out and I
[44:32] can be a father to my children and and
[44:34] and all our dads here and all our
[44:36] parents here uh you know we're just
[44:38] thankful that our families are together
[44:40] and and we're strong together so it's
[44:42] it's it's a it's a joyful thing to have
[44:44] our children with us and as our father
[44:47] provides for us we can provide for our
[44:48] children so yes we love you Lord and
[44:52] yeah amen
[45:03] um so a couple of things
[45:06] um the one thing that just struck me
[45:08] about Father's Day is I look at my two
[45:10] boys and I as a father if you're a
[45:13] father you just look at your children
[45:14] you go no matter what you do no matter
[45:16] how angry you make
[45:18] me you can't change being in my and I
[45:22] can change my life for you um
[45:27] and I take that back to to my
[45:30] relationship with God and I you know I'm
[45:32] still in this fleshly body I haven't
[45:34] been transformed yet so this thing still
[45:37] makes mistakes but it can't change his
[45:40] love for me and can't change the fact
[45:42] that I am his and he'll always be
[45:44] waiting at the gate when I come back and
[45:47] he'll have a feast prepared for me and
[45:50] um oh that that that just excites me and
[45:53] another thing that I just want to uh
[45:55] talk about is um yesterday we were over
[45:57] at my brother's place and they've got a
[45:59] they got a structure where there's a
[46:00] swing on so it's a it's like the beams
[46:03] of wooden beams and goes across it's
[46:05] just like a structure of PL beams and
[46:07] the kids were playing climbing up there
[46:09] and you know the young kids were could
[46:12] to get up there and we helped them up
[46:13] and Keegan was at the top there and he
[46:15] was a bit scared he you know he's never
[46:17] been a fearful boy but this just fin of
[46:19] got him and he didn't like this idea he
[46:22] didn't feel in control or anything like
[46:24] that and the fear just became him and
[46:26] just that he got over him and I went
[46:28] there and I told him look I've got you
[46:30] you've got to show you know you've got
[46:32] to you've got to trust that I've got you
[46:35] I'll catch you you need to jump you need
[46:37] to jump off I'm not going to pick you
[46:40] off you got to face this and you got to
[46:42] jump and after a long while lots of
[46:44] Tears he did actually go I showed him
[46:46] right see he good door but then I put
[46:49] him back up it's right
[46:52] there and he didn't like this idea at
[46:55] all because he got off you now I'm
[46:57] putting him back in the in the problem
[46:59] and
[47:00] um and he jumped off the second time a
[47:04] little bit easier and I actually cled up
[47:06] as well and I told him right do this do
[47:07] this do this and then you can feel that
[47:09] you're in control and is a little bit
[47:11] more and you've got to trust well got
[47:14] and second time was a little bit easier
[47:17] and then I did it a third time right now
[47:20] and without a hedge R back up not a tear
[47:23] in sight and jump back down without any
[47:26] problem sometimes things happen in our
[47:28] lives that are you look at the situation
[47:30] and you go I can't I can't handle this
[47:33] and then and then you trust God and he
[47:34] helped you through and you think okay
[47:36] thank goodness that's over and the very
[47:38] next day it happens again and you think
[47:41] um this isn't this isn't how it's
[47:43] supposed to go but then God's trained
[47:46] you and he showed you look hang on
[47:49] you've got to face this fear you've got
[47:50] to trust you've got to believe and then
[47:53] as you go along you just get to that and
[47:56] the greatest of all was is when we told
[47:58] when we were at home we were sitting
[47:59] around the dinner table Keegan said that
[48:02] the thing that he that he said was the
[48:04] fact that he climbed up he was very
[48:06] scared but he learned to trust dad's got
[48:10] him and that dad's got going to be ready
[48:12] for him and that's our that's my
[48:13] testimony is that a lot of things have
[48:15] happened over the last couple of years
[48:17] or so and it's hard but you trust and
[48:21] you jump and you and you know that God's
[48:24] got this and you just keep going and you
[48:26] build
[48:52] right a little bit just Tes
[48:59] um just thanks to our so
[49:05] wonderful he
[49:07] has one of
[49:12] the
[49:14] mie you can see how great things have
[49:17] been eared to make this a reality which
[49:20] two three years ago was been like what
[49:23] is this going to happen to make this
[49:25] happen and now you can see the substance
[49:28] to it but then

[49:35] months or about six months ago I got
[49:37] asked by the editor of the BNL um to

[59:21] couple of announcements um so uh I got
[59:25] the key to have look
[59:26] upstairs so we go look upstairs the
[59:29] price isn't right but the Lord wants us
[59:30] we'll have it so we'll just have a look
[59:33] um we need to have an AGM so if we have
[59:35] that after church next week we have an
[59:38] AGM and uh if you have anything you'd
[59:41] like to discuss just send it to me in
[59:43] some form and then um you know we've got
[59:45] Sunday school various other things to
[59:47] talk about but if you got specific
[59:49] things you want to talk about uh send it
[59:51] to me we have an
[59:53] agenda um I think I think that's
[59:56] everything yes those the
[59:59] two
[1:00:02] um um yes those the two things um if you
[1:00:06] got your Bibles let's just go to Genesis
[1:00:08] 24 and Happy Father's Day you know it's
[1:00:11] wonderful when you uh you don't really
[1:00:13] need to I feel I don't need to say
[1:00:15] anything about it because well the
[1:00:17] fathers stood up and they expressed
[1:00:18] their views on Father's Day I thought
[1:00:20] praise the lord it's right down the you
[1:00:22] know it's true that you know a man can
[1:00:25] can can become God to his family and
[1:00:27] express the fullness of God to his
[1:00:28] family and that's what the father was
[1:00:30] called to do that when you know the
[1:00:32] children when they look at look at
[1:00:34] father they should see they should see
[1:00:35] God and when when wife looks at looks at
[1:00:38] husband she should see God Amen and then
[1:00:41] and then when and when others look upon
[1:00:43] that man they should see God as well
[1:00:46] because his brother Donnie was saying
[1:00:47] that we are God we are the Tabernacle of
[1:00:49] the Living God God is veiled in flesh
[1:00:52] he's always veiled in flesh he's veiled
[1:00:54] in us I trust you can say he dwells in
[1:00:56] me and if he dwells in you you are the
[1:00:59] Mighty God has unveiled I mean because
[1:01:01] he's veiled in you and he's expressed
[1:01:03] out of your
[1:01:04] life Hallelujah so amen every attribute
[1:01:08] you know of God should be expressed in
[1:01:12] you
[1:01:14] amen okay let's just go to Genesis
[1:01:17] 24 amen and so you
[1:01:20] know the world may not think too much of
[1:01:23] you but God's been waiting for people to
[1:01:26] himself through in his fullness where
[1:01:28] our people can give God preeminence and
[1:01:30] in in everything not just to save you
[1:01:33] but just have your own way Lord whatever
[1:01:35] you want you know he's been waiting for
[1:01:36] people to have a full he can express
[1:01:38] himself fully through and here you are
[1:01:41] and you go about your daily life and
[1:01:42] you're expressing God upon this Earth
[1:01:45] hallelujah amen we're just going to read
[1:01:48] the last bit of Genesis 24 I just want
[1:01:50] to go over a few things so Genesis 24
[1:01:52] and read from verse 56 down we know this
[1:01:55] is the story
[1:01:56] of of Rebecca being uh returning now
[1:01:59] with with Alazar to to her Isaac and he
[1:02:03] said unto them say alaza speaking to to
[1:02:06] uh her family hinder me not seeing the
[1:02:08] Lord has prospered my way send me away
[1:02:10] that I may go to my master and they said
[1:02:13] we will call the damsel and inquired her
[1:02:15] mouth and they called Rebecca and said
[1:02:17] unto her will thou go with this man she
[1:02:19] said I will go and they what a what a
[1:02:23] powerful three words I will go and they
[1:02:25] sent away Rebecca their sister and her
[1:02:27] nurse and Abraham's servant and his men
[1:02:30] and they blessed Rebecca and said unto
[1:02:32] her Thou Art our sister be thou the
[1:02:34] mother of thousands of millions and let
[1:02:36] thy seed possess the Gate of those which
[1:02:38] hate them and Rebecca arose in her
[1:02:40] damsels and they Rod upon camels and
[1:02:43] followed the man and the servant took
[1:02:45] Rebecca and went his way and Isaac came
[1:02:47] from the way of The Well of laari which
[1:02:51] of course means The Well of him that
[1:02:53] liveth and seeth me for he DW dth in the
[1:02:56] South Country and Isaac went out to
[1:02:58] meditate in the field at the evening
[1:03:00] tide and lifted up his eyes and saw and
[1:03:02] behold the camels were coming and
[1:03:04] Rebecca lifted up her eyes and when he
[1:03:06] she saw Isaac she lighted off the camel
[1:03:09] for she had said unto the servant what
[1:03:11] man is this that walketh in the field to
[1:03:13] meet us and the servant had said it is
[1:03:16] my master therefore she took a veil and
[1:03:19] covered herself and the servant told
[1:03:21] Isaac all the things he had done and
[1:03:23] Isaac brought her into her mother's
[1:03:26] Sarah's tent and took Rebecca and she
[1:03:28] became his wife and he loved her and
[1:03:31] Isaac was comforted after his mother's
[1:03:33] death amen and let's just read uh let's

[1:06:00] good to have Pam with us as well God
[1:06:01] bless you
[1:06:02] welcome amen now I want to continue from
[1:06:07] from from last week and you know we're
[1:06:09] going through a bit of a thought where
[1:06:10] we are at the end time and and we we've
[1:06:13] read here now where where Isaac was was
[1:06:16] he he he came into the field there and
[1:06:18] he began to meditate and he was he was
[1:06:20] waiting for this for this time because
[1:06:23] he had seen Abraham send alaz he had
[1:06:26] seen Abraham load the camels with all of
[1:06:28] his goods and he had seen the those
[1:06:30] camels no doubt Go off into the distance
[1:06:32] and go over the horizon and he had he
[1:06:34] had begin to wait now because he knew
[1:06:37] that because when Abraham said that the
[1:06:39] angel of the Lord will go before you and
[1:06:41] he shall he shall he shall find he shall
[1:06:44] find a wife amen it's not you alasa
[1:06:47] that's really going to do it but God
[1:06:49] this unseen one that's already going
[1:06:50] before you he shall prepare the damel he
[1:06:53] shall speak to her heart when when you
[1:06:55] come to the place amen she will be ready
[1:06:58] she doesn't know that that that God has
[1:07:00] come her way already and begin to deal
[1:07:02] with her but she you know she will begin
[1:07:05] to discover that she's part of this
[1:07:06] great plan amen you know she's just
[1:07:09] living her life and she's there getting
[1:07:11] water and these things but but God has a
[1:07:13] different plan for her life and and now
[1:07:16] now that now what God saw her to become
[1:07:19] was going to become you know was going
[1:07:20] to become reality and and we see here
[1:07:23] that no doubt Abraham would you know you
[1:07:25] know you know he he sent alasar and
[1:07:27] these things and Isaac would have been
[1:07:29] under expectation because now had come
[1:07:32] the season where he was because he was
[1:07:35] the promised son and his seed would
[1:07:37] continue on through that lineage was
[1:07:39] going to come the serpent Bruiser
[1:07:40] himself Christ Jesus and and we
[1:07:43] understand that you know he had to he
[1:07:45] had to be married because he had to have
[1:07:46] children and now the season had come we
[1:07:49] finally finally the you know it wasn't
[1:07:51] just maybe a one day kind of thing
[1:07:53] because we understand that I he wasn't a
[1:07:56] young man when when he got married he
[1:07:58] was an older man and so he could have
[1:08:00] got married many you know he he had many
[1:08:02] years of opportunity he could have got
[1:08:04] married but Abraham knew that he had to
[1:08:06] he had to marry a blood relation he had
[1:08:09] to marry someone that was related to him
[1:08:11] and it's the same thing with our Lord
[1:08:13] that when he finds you he finds you
[1:08:15] because you're part of his family you're
[1:08:17] part of him and we understand that a
[1:08:19] wife is a part of part of the husband
[1:08:21] the two are actually one amen even
[1:08:24] though they're in two separate bodies
[1:08:25] but Paul says great is the mystery
[1:08:27] speaking of Christ and the church
[1:08:29] husband and wife that they become one
[1:08:30] flesh and so Abraham there was only one
[1:08:33] wife for Isaac I mean he could have
[1:08:36] married any girl he wanted because his
[1:08:38] father was a mighty man of wealth and he
[1:08:41] had the herds and he had all the cattle
[1:08:42] and all these things he was a rich man
[1:08:44] so no doubt there would have been many
[1:08:46] young women saying I'm going to marry
[1:08:47] Isaac one day but there was something in
[1:08:50] Isaac because he would have seen other
[1:08:52] woman he wasn't some in a cloer none on
[1:08:54] some Hill some place he would have seen
[1:08:56] other woman he would have seen the woman
[1:08:58] of the land and no doubt some of those
[1:09:00] women said I'm going to marry I'm going
[1:09:01] to marry this one cuz you know how you
[1:09:03] know people try and marry riches and all
[1:09:06] these things but there was something in
[1:09:07] Isaac that said they're not part of me
[1:09:11] Hallelujah there's something that that
[1:09:12] there's something in me that just it
[1:09:14] just doesn't resonate am mean when when
[1:09:17] when I see them approach me something in
[1:09:19] me just doesn't say say that she's the
[1:09:21] oneu but then finally the day had come
[1:09:24] where the camel train was coming back
[1:09:26] and you know it's about 500 mil to go
[1:09:29] from where Abraham was to where Rebecca
[1:09:31] was living it's a long journey and 500
[1:09:34] mil is a long way and especially if
[1:09:36] you're on camels and it takes I know
[1:09:39] some people said maybe at least a month
[1:09:40] to get there so it would have been a
[1:09:42] good two Monon journey and so he would
[1:09:45] have but he was under expectation
[1:09:47] because he knew he knew that alaza had
[1:09:50] to come not empty-handed but he had to
[1:09:53] come with a woman amen that was part of
[1:09:56] him amen hallelujah so now he begin to
[1:09:59] see in the evening time the you know he
[1:10:01] would look over that Horizon and this
[1:10:03] day was this evening was a different
[1:10:05] kind of evening because because he began
[1:10:08] to see those camels come over the
[1:10:10] horizon from from a few months ago he
[1:10:12] saw them leave and now they are coming
[1:10:14] back and we see this as a beautiful
[1:10:17] picture of our day and hour that we're
[1:10:19] alive and because we're under
[1:10:21] expectation for the catching away but
[1:10:24] God has been waiting for this hour
[1:10:26] Hallelujah where a woman amen has has
[1:10:30] has said those three words I will go and
[1:10:32] she's come under the sound of a
[1:10:34] supernatural voice and she said I will
[1:10:36] go I don't know how you did it you may
[1:10:38] have wept at an altar you may be driving
[1:10:40] in your car and God come down or so I
[1:10:43] don't know how how he came to you but he
[1:10:45] came to you there amen I trust if he
[1:10:47] hasn't come to you let him come amen God
[1:10:50] is present among us even even now he's
[1:10:52] pre I believe he's present amen let him
[1:10:54] come to you
[1:10:56] Hallelujah and then so finally you know
[1:10:58] we have all had the experience of of of
[1:11:01] coming under the sound of a voice and
[1:11:03] that voice spoke to you it spoke to me
[1:11:06] more than any other voice amen I've
[1:11:09] heard I've heard different languages
[1:11:10] I've heard different accents I've heard
[1:11:12] different voices but when I heard that
[1:11:14] voice I mean when I heard the voice of
[1:11:16] that Prophet amen it may have been
[1:11:18] recorded 50 years ago but something
[1:11:20] something in me I mean it resonated like
[1:11:23] nothing else ever did I said had in
[1:11:25] church many churches before I've been in
[1:11:27] many different denominations before i'
[1:11:30] read many different books and these
[1:11:31] things but when I heard that voice amen
[1:11:34] something in me said this is more than a
[1:11:36] man amen and Jesus was lifted out of
[1:11:39] history and he became a present day God
[1:11:42] Amen to me Hallelujah he became a real
[1:11:46] God he became not more than a story book
[1:11:48] and more than just a testimony of
[1:11:50] someone but he came he came to me there
[1:11:53] amen he he changed me I had to I had to
[1:11:55] be willing to lay everything down but he
[1:11:58] when I came under the sound of that
[1:12:00] voice I could not go back to my old life
[1:12:02] it doesn't matter how much I wasn't
[1:12:04] willing to let things go I just I was
[1:12:06] wasn't satisfied anymore there was
[1:12:09] something in me saying this is what I've
[1:12:11] been looking for amen you know so you
[1:12:14] know you come to a point in life you can
[1:12:16] be young or old it doesn't matter and
[1:12:17] you say there's got to be more to it
[1:12:18] than this there's got to be more to it
[1:12:20] than this am me how did I come to this
[1:12:23] spot and you know and then and God
[1:12:25] allows God allows you to be stirred up
[1:12:27] that way sir God God wants you to be
[1:12:30] uncomfortable yes sir am mean before him
[1:12:32] he doesn't want you to be comfortable in
[1:12:34] this world before God deals with you he
[1:12:36] wants you to be uncomfortable amen amen
[1:12:38] because if you're satisfied you won't
[1:12:40] say I will go you won't say yes I'll
[1:12:42] leave everything I know and go to this
[1:12:44] different place you'll just say well I
[1:12:46] have it all everything's everything's
[1:12:48] peaching but he wants you to be stirred
[1:12:50] up amen amen if you're being stirred up
[1:12:53] you know if you're being if if your life
[1:12:54] was up upside down you should say praise
[1:12:56] the Lord amen because God allowed it to
[1:12:59] be thus and it'll be so amen you know
[1:13:01] brother Braham he he would say about
[1:13:03] trials and these things and he and he
[1:13:05] said you know a voice said to him are
[1:13:07] you are you wanting to bypass this
[1:13:09] because Tri the the trial of your faith
[1:13:12] amen is more precious than gold amen so
[1:13:16] well you I'm going through the ringer
[1:13:18] hallelujah amen the world is falling
[1:13:20] apart hallelujah amen because the TR and
[1:13:23] yeah the voice it to you want to bypass
[1:13:25] this and he said no amen there we go
[1:13:28] down through it why because it's in the
[1:13:31] it's not on the mountain top when when
[1:13:33] character is being built I mean we're
[1:13:35] being built you go listen to the Statue
[1:13:37] of a perfect man and brother Braham he
[1:13:39] didn't call it the statue of a perfect
[1:13:41] man he called it the the living
[1:13:43] Tabernacle of the living God's dwelling
[1:13:45] place that's what he called the sermon
[1:13:48] amen and we see that God is God is very
[1:13:50] intent now because this is what he wants
[1:13:53] built amen amen God is the contractor
[1:13:56] Hallelujah I mean he doesn't change his
[1:13:58] plans he has a blueprint and he's
[1:14:01] determined it's going to be on time it's
[1:14:03] going to be on schedule it doesn't
[1:14:05] matter what hazards or unseen things
[1:14:08] seem to come what people think or this
[1:14:11] doesn't fit here this is wrong and all
[1:14:12] this God God God's not interested in all
[1:14:16] that kind of stuff God says I'm going to
[1:14:17] build a people into my image and it's
[1:14:21] going to be that way and nothing can
[1:14:22] stop nothing can stop them being built
[1:14:24] in my image Hallelujah and so he's now
[1:14:27] he's he's taking you you know when
[1:14:30] Rebecca said I'll go she didn't really
[1:14:33] have a great idea of what was going to
[1:14:35] happen she knew she was going to get
[1:14:37] married yeah but she didn't really fully
[1:14:39] maybe grasp he you read the story
[1:14:43] Genesis 24 she hear the testimony of
[1:14:45] here comes a servant of Abraham
[1:14:47] Abraham's related to her family Abraham
[1:14:50] has a son and you know and all you know
[1:14:52] I'm looking for a wife for Isaac and you
[1:14:54] know this is all she hears but she
[1:14:57] doesn't understand that she is living
[1:14:59] out something an incredible journey is
[1:15:01] about to take place in her life because
[1:15:04] you know no doubt when you know a true
[1:15:06] servant of God he's not interested in in
[1:15:09] gathering the people to himself he's not
[1:15:11] interested in in the people catching his
[1:15:13] Spirit or his personality a true servant
[1:15:16] of God is only interested in one thing
[1:15:18] that God and man would be United in a
[1:15:20] true spiritual relationship and he's not
[1:15:23] important amen because a you can't have
[1:15:25] a third person in a marriage you can't
[1:15:27] have a third will amen it's just got to
[1:15:29] be Christ and his church amen and then
[1:15:32] everything that God uses to to create
[1:15:35] that Union it's just it's just material
[1:15:37] but it's not the most important thing
[1:15:39] amen the important thing is that God and
[1:15:41] man would become one Hallelujah that
[1:15:44] alasa all he was interested in he wasn't
[1:15:46] interested in taking some Scenic tour
[1:15:49] I've never been to this part of the
[1:15:50] country let's go along the coast let's
[1:15:51] have a look he said don't hinder my
[1:15:54] journey see that God has prospered my
[1:15:56] way I must go now he was he was very
[1:15:59] determined I've got what I need I'm
[1:16:01] leaving amen amen and then so it's the
[1:16:03] same thing now we're not interested in
[1:16:05] building some you know building some
[1:16:08] church around some personality of man or
[1:16:10] some different way of thinking it's that
[1:16:13] God and man would be United amen that
[1:16:15] the head would be United with the body
[1:16:18] amen that God would dwell in a people he
[1:16:20] would take a people and he would Express
[1:16:22] himself individually through those
[1:16:24] people amen this is what we're called to
[1:16:26] in this hour that it's no longer I that
[1:16:28] liveth but Christ that liveth in me amen
[1:16:31] when man sees you they should be able to
[1:16:33] see God they may not be able to put a
[1:16:35] picture you know maybe put a finger on
[1:16:37] why you're different but I trust they
[1:16:39] can say you're different it's more than
[1:16:41] how you dress or more than you know
[1:16:43] maybe how you do your hair or I go to
[1:16:45] church on Sunday but there's a life in
[1:16:47] there and that life is expressing itself
[1:16:49] even in spite of what you want that
[1:16:51] comes and lives in you and you become a
[1:16:54] love prisoner as Paul said a prisoner of
[1:16:56] Jesus Christ he became a Lov prisoner
[1:16:59] Amen to that one he met on the road to
[1:17:01] Damascus and then he was determined now
[1:17:03] that those bonds of love he would
[1:17:05] actually impart those to others that
[1:17:07] they would fall in love with the same
[1:17:09] one amen the same one that gave the law
[1:17:12] and all he knew was a was a god came to
[1:17:14] Mount Si one day and gave a law but then
[1:17:16] he he fell in love with that same
[1:17:18] lawgiver and he found out that he was
[1:17:20] more than a lawgiver but he became a
[1:17:22] sacrifice he became a lamb for him he
[1:17:25] became his high priest he became his
[1:17:26] intercessor and he fell in love with
[1:17:28] this Jesus I trust I pray this morning
[1:17:31] that if you haven't fallen in love with
[1:17:33] Jesus Christ you would fall in love with
[1:17:35] him amen because if you fall in love
[1:17:37] with him everything else just just
[1:17:39] evaporates amen all the church isms and
[1:17:42] politics and this and that and stuff
[1:17:44] that doesn't matter just fall in love
[1:17:46] with him amen when I heard that when I
[1:17:49] heard brother brandom it was never L to
[1:17:51] me I I heard Grace I heard the grace of
[1:17:54] God God being preached amen and and from
[1:17:57] that day on it's been Grace I'm just
[1:17:59] Grace top bottom inside and out amen
[1:18:02] that God can enable a person to live his
[1:18:04] word and it's not the man or the woman
[1:18:06] living the word it's God God says I'll
[1:18:09] be the Christian in you I'll cause you
[1:18:11] to walk this way because I will do it I
[1:18:13] mean I will be the Overcomer in you I
[1:18:16] will cause you to be a consecrated lover
[1:18:18] of me not because you hey our Humanity
[1:18:21] we're a bunch of
[1:18:23] jellyfish Hallelujah
[1:18:25] you can't give a jellyfish a
[1:18:27] backbone amen and if you try you just
[1:18:29] kill the
[1:18:30] jellyfish you can't inject you can't
[1:18:33] just say you must live this this is how
[1:18:35] you must live and this is all this stuff
[1:18:37] if love is not the underpinning thing
[1:18:40] it's going to something's going to go
[1:18:41] wrong but if it's not you know if if if
[1:18:44] there's love there doesn't matter what
[1:18:47] you have to do doesn't matter how
[1:18:49] ridiculous it seems doesn't matter how
[1:18:51] contrary to your nature you think it is
[1:18:53] if it's love you say yes Lord
[1:18:55] amen yes I'll do it for you because I
[1:18:57] love you amen hallelujah amen amen I'm
[1:19:01] so glad redeeming love has been my theme
[1:19:03] and shall be till I die amen that
[1:19:06] there's a real love upon this Earth that
[1:19:09] that that that survives the storms it
[1:19:12] you know goes through the good times it
[1:19:13] goes through the bad times am mean
[1:19:15] there's an anchor amen I'll say it this
[1:19:18] is not P the sky I mean this is a living
[1:19:21] reality it's more than just words that
[1:19:23] you know if you just preach people and
[1:19:25] say this and this and this hey this must
[1:19:27] live first and then you preach a sermon
[1:19:30] if redeeming love is not being lived out
[1:19:32] of you amen amen well how do you do it
[1:19:36] honey how you doing today he hey kitties
[1:19:39] how you doing is everything all right
[1:19:41] and they you know they may be all
[1:19:42] upsetting up and down you just pick them
[1:19:43] up it's all right sing a song do
[1:19:45] something you know amen what is that
[1:19:48] that's redeeming love being expressed
[1:19:51] amen when your children your children
[1:19:52] should always be able to see no matter
[1:19:54] what what they do they can always come
[1:19:56] back to you yes sir no matter what they

[1:22:36] under the blood of bulls and goats and
[1:22:37] the Very nature ofey a man and it wasn't

[1:24:51] amen oh I don't know you just he step
[1:24:53] out in faith take God at his word Joshua

[1:25:05] the king say to Esther what is your
[1:25:07] request I'll give you even up to half of
[1:25:09] the Kingdom now that wasn't saying we'll
[1:25:11] split the kingdom evenly he's saying
[1:25:13] what's mine is yours and what's yours is
[1:25:14] mine everything I have at my disposal is
[1:25:18] in your hand Hallelujah all of Heaven is
[1:25:21] behind the Queen of Heaven I mean the
[1:25:23] Bride of Jesus Christ we may not have
[1:25:25] the power but we have the authority amen
[1:25:27] like a policeman or a diplomat goes to a
[1:25:30] country that entire country is backing
[1:25:32] that man or woman amen that goes in the
[1:25:34] name of that
[1:25:35] country how about you friends amen we
[1:25:39] are not from an Earthly Kingdom we're
[1:25:41] from a Heavenly Kingdom and all of
[1:25:43] Heaven is behind you yes sir God is
[1:25:45] determined not you God is determined
[1:25:48] amen that you'll be made in His image
[1:25:50] amen that you'll be in his very likeness
[1:25:52] yes sir and so we see Rebecca now she
[1:25:55] was on a journey and she was always part
[1:25:58] of Isaac but now no doubt you know God
[1:26:02] you know no doubt she would have she
[1:26:04] would have uh she would have asked a lot
[1:26:06] of
[1:26:06] questions and to me I do not believe it
[1:26:09] just would have been a you know what
[1:26:12] does he like to eat and uh you know it
[1:26:14] would have been more than what does he
[1:26:16] when does he wake up in the morning and
[1:26:18] what's his favorite pastimes and things
[1:26:21] it would have been a real you're about
[1:26:23] she's about to meet him she's going to
[1:26:25] marry and so it would have been a real
[1:26:27] now every every everything about his
[1:26:29] life how does he you know what does he
[1:26:33] like to do and you know how what's his
[1:26:35] character like how does he you know when
[1:26:37] things come up and you know with the
[1:26:39] herdsman and stuff how does he deal with
[1:26:40] these she would have been looking for
[1:26:42] more than what he likes to do but his
[1:26:44] very nature and character she would have
[1:26:46] been pulling it out of out of out of
[1:26:48] alasa and so now alaza when he begin to
[1:26:52] begin to speak now he was not interested
[1:26:55] as I said he was not interested in
[1:26:57] trying to bind Rebecca to himself he was
[1:27:00] not interested in trying to get Rebecca
[1:27:02] to fall in love with him but every word
[1:27:04] that came out of his mouth bound her
[1:27:07] heart more with Isaac's every day amen
[1:27:10] when when when he would when they would
[1:27:11] sit there or however they did it and and
[1:27:13] they would have Fellowship maybe over
[1:27:15] the campfire at night he would begin to
[1:27:17] tell tell stories about Isaac and this
[1:27:19] would now this would draw Rebecca closer
[1:27:22] am mean closer to this man that she had
[1:27:24] never seen before hallelujah hallelujah
[1:27:26] and now we see that you know this is why
[1:27:30] you know brother BR speaks about this
[1:27:32] this glorified Jesus in
[1:27:34] 55 now we understand you are Rebecca and
[1:27:38] Isaac is our lord Jesus we understand
[1:27:40] these things and so he says this he says
[1:27:44] if you're trying he's speaking of the
[1:27:46] Bible here if you're trying to read it
[1:27:49] from some educational standpoint you
[1:27:52] just read it like you was trying to
[1:27:54] figure out mathematically
[1:27:57] something but if you read it after you
[1:28:01] have received Christ into your heart
[1:28:03] it's a brand new book again it's just a
[1:28:06] love story God's writing it to you it's
[1:28:10] spiritually uh it's spiritual reveal
[1:28:13] God's church is absolutely a spiritual
[1:28:15] revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:28:17] no man can receive it by his own desire
[1:28:20] Jesus said no man can come to me except
[1:28:22] my father draws me first is that right
[1:28:24] it has to be a work of the holy spirit
[1:28:26] in the beginning to draw the person and
[1:28:29] when the person comes to God by the Holy
[1:28:31] Ghost Holy Spirit draw Jesus said I'll
[1:28:34] no wise cast them out give him
[1:28:36] everlasting life raise him up at the
[1:28:37] last day what a beautiful hope that
[1:28:40] gives to the church amen if you could
[1:28:43] just the greatest Miracle you will ever
[1:28:45] experience is to be drawn to him it's
[1:28:48] that that's an incredible thing to have
[1:28:50] something in you that says I want more
[1:28:51] of him I want to meet him that is the
[1:28:54] most Supernatural thing you will
[1:28:55] experience in your life and so we see
[1:28:59] that Rebecca that's why I said Rebecca
[1:29:01] what you would have asked would have
[1:29:02] been more than just a you an
[1:29:04] intellectual trying to understand Isaac
[1:29:07] but she was wanting to because she was
[1:29:09] wanting to very pull out of alasa the
[1:29:12] very heart of Isaac I mean really you
[1:29:14] know really who Isaac not as not as what
[1:29:17] the maybe the other servants knew about
[1:29:19] Isaac or maybe what the other people saw
[1:29:21] about Isaac but the real manen I mean
[1:29:24] the real man in his his entirety because
[1:29:27] we can read the scripture and we can see
[1:29:29] what other people say about Jesus and we
[1:29:31] can no doubt they'll talk about him
[1:29:32] walking on the shores of Galilee and
[1:29:34] that he and that he loves everybody and
[1:29:36] that he died on the cross and all those
[1:29:38] things are true but we want more than
[1:29:40] just that but we want to see the very
[1:29:42] man himself the very character of God I
[1:29:45] mean we want to hear about you know
[1:29:47] exactly what is our lord Jesus like
[1:29:50] hallelujah how does he handle these
[1:29:52] situations and how does he you know
[1:29:54] handle and and I'm going to bring that
[1:29:55] into today but you know we the whole the
[1:29:59] whole Christian journey and Rebecca's
[1:30:02] Journey when she got on the camels with
[1:30:05] alasa she began to it began to be a love
[1:30:08] affair between her and Isaac amen and I
[1:30:11] can say that because elaser I mean so
[1:30:15] that whole chapter there is a shadow of
[1:30:17] you and the Lord in this end time and so
[1:30:21] if I have you know we we are United with
[1:30:24] Christ here the marriage is here amen
[1:30:28] the marriage supper is up there but we
[1:30:31] don't so we meet him here but we don't
[1:30:34] see him in his glorified form here are
[1:30:36] you with me so we got to meet him in the
[1:30:39] a we got to meet him in that Dimension
[1:30:40] and we'll see him as he is in his
[1:30:42] glorified form but we've already been
[1:30:45] United here okay so in a way I know him
[1:30:49] but in a way I don't fully know him yet
[1:30:52] because I haven't seen him as he is yet
[1:30:55] amen sure he's been unveiled in his word
[1:30:57] and we see the entire unfolding you know
[1:30:59] the unveiling of God but I haven't seen
[1:31:01] him in his in his physical form yet you
[1:31:04] know in his in his Corporal body that's
[1:31:06] been glorified you understand what I'm
[1:31:08] saying so I've become one with them now
[1:31:11] but I'm looking for that final uniting
[1:31:14] when the dead in Christ rise and then we
[1:31:16] our bodies are changed and we're caught
[1:31:17] up to meet him there's that final
[1:31:19] uniting that we're looking forward to
[1:31:21] but the Bride of Jesus Christ has been
[1:31:23] United United with him now right I mean
[1:31:25] when he meets you you have been United
[1:31:27] with him Hallelujah You are not alone in
[1:31:30] this walk but he is with you amen so now
[1:31:34] we begin to when I met him it became a
[1:31:37] love affair between me and God am mean
[1:31:40] from the very first time I heard that
[1:31:42] message I it just caused me to come into
[1:31:45] a love affair with Jesus
[1:31:47] Christ and so that's why I can say that
[1:31:49] that Rebecca now it would be it began to
[1:31:52] be a love affair between her and Isaac
[1:31:56] and so as as they were journeying now
[1:31:58] she would begin to ask about Isaac and
[1:32:00] no doubt there was things in her life
[1:32:02] maybe she had to change but you know no
[1:32:04] doubt she you know maybe she have asked
[1:32:06] how how does Isaac like us to dress how
[1:32:08] does he like us to conduct ourselves and
[1:32:10] and you know she would have changed you
[1:32:12] know all those things but it was more
[1:32:13] than that to her amen it was more than
[1:32:16] just an outward Conformity but there was
[1:32:18] a there's something in her saying you
[1:32:21] she she fell in love with a man she'd
[1:32:22] never seen before
[1:32:25] amen and Peter tells us that he says and
[1:32:29] whom we have not seen yet we love now
[1:32:31] we' have seen him I when I look down
[1:32:34] into your faces I see Jesus Christ so in
[1:32:37] a way I see him but I haven't seen him
[1:32:41] you know in his in his glorified form
[1:32:43] you understand what I'm saying am mean
[1:32:45] so when you see you know brother bam
[1:32:47] says when you see God manifest you see
[1:32:50] you've seen him yeah so we see see him
[1:32:55] in his bride but we haven't seen him
[1:32:58] yet I'm just you you're following what
[1:33:01] I'm saying you understand so now Isaac
[1:33:04] so that's why we can go back and say she
[1:33:06] fell in love with Isaac without even
[1:33:07] seeing
[1:33:09] him and then you know I believe that you
[1:33:13] know Rebecca's you know as they
[1:33:15] journeyed now Rebecca's love and
[1:33:17] expectation to meet Isaac increased it
[1:33:20] just increased every every day Journey
[1:33:22] it would have just got greater
[1:33:24] and greater is our
[1:33:26] journey and you know we can read you
[1:33:29] know you know we read that her calling
[1:33:31] her journey was under the influence of
[1:33:33] the Angel of the Lord and that unseen
[1:33:35] one in the whole journey was the most
[1:33:36] important one because it was that unseen
[1:33:39] one that unseen one was actually the one
[1:33:41] uniting Isaac and Rebecca together amen
[1:33:44] it's the same thing with us that now
[1:33:47] remember the angel of the Lord I I know
[1:33:49] it's just characters but but God is only
[1:33:51] one you understand there's not the
[1:33:53] father and the son are not two different
[1:33:54] persons they are the same person but
[1:33:56] manifested in different ways so we see
[1:33:59] now that the angel of the Lord is is God
[1:34:01] in another form and he is here that
[1:34:03] unseen one is present now in order to
[1:34:06] unite us to the sun amen amen to unite
[1:34:09] us to himself you see so so that the
[1:34:13] angel of God that Abraham said he'll go
[1:34:15] before you he was the most important
[1:34:17] character he was the one who brought
[1:34:18] them all together in the very end it's
[1:34:21] the same thing with us now that un seen
[1:34:24] one that walks with us you know brother
[1:34:26] baram he he would he would stand there
[1:34:29] and he would say now Jesus is the high
[1:34:30] priest of our profession and and then
[1:34:32] God would would would come down and he
[1:34:34] would point to people in the audience
[1:34:36] and say you you were just praying for
[1:34:38] this and this and this and you were
[1:34:39] praying for this and this and this and
[1:34:41] and he would say who did she touch who
[1:34:42] did he touch they're 20 ft away from me
[1:34:45] they never touch me but they touched the
[1:34:46] high priest so he was asking who did
[1:34:49] they touch and and so he was posing that
[1:34:52] question to them for them to recog that
[1:34:54] their faith touched God and God used
[1:34:57] that vessel to reveal their needs to
[1:34:59] them but I want to I want to do the flip
[1:35:02] side of that question now when God came
[1:35:04] your way when your life I'm trusting you
[1:35:07] can go back into your life it doesn't
[1:35:08] matter if you're raising this message
[1:35:09] you came out of some some church or out
[1:35:12] of the world but there's a time where
[1:35:14] something happened to you amen something
[1:35:16] caused your heart to be turn towards
[1:35:18] godj and I can ask you the question what
[1:35:21] touched you who touched you amen amen
[1:35:24] who was touching you hallelujah
[1:35:26] hallelujah this great Eternal and I wish
[1:35:29] I could put it in words but this great
[1:35:32] Eternal one that would that would
[1:35:34] transcend dimensions and come into this
[1:35:36] realm amen amen and use a voice and when
[1:35:40] you heard that voice it wasn't like any
[1:35:42] other voice you say that spoke to me
[1:35:44] brother Ben like I have nothing else has
[1:35:46] spoke I could say what touched you what
[1:35:49] spoke to you it's more than a man from
[1:35:52] Kentucky God just used that vessel to
[1:35:54] unveil himself amen but God would take a
[1:35:57] take a lips of a prophet and unveil
[1:35:59] himself through that man and it would
[1:36:01] anchor in the heart of the bride and it
[1:36:03] would cause a love of fear am me to
[1:36:05] begin between them and Jesus Christ
[1:36:08] himself I can say what touched you amen
[1:36:10] hallelujah what touched you what's
[1:36:13] what's affecting me what's driving me to
[1:36:16] my ultimate goal amen it's not I trust
[1:36:19] is not human ambition for me it's not
[1:36:21] human ambition am mean it's not it's not
[1:36:23] my character or some any any Humane
[1:36:26] thing but it's a supernatural effect
[1:36:29] amen hallelujah hallelujah there's a
[1:36:32] there's an unseen one in this in this
[1:36:34] meeting there's an unseen one in our
[1:36:36] homes there's an unseen one when we go
[1:36:38] just walking down the street or into the
[1:36:40] mall there's an unseen one amen and he's
[1:36:43] the Lord Of Glory maybe you need to
[1:36:45] recognize who walks with you every day
[1:36:48] if we could you just think the greatest
[1:36:49] celebrity upon this Earth brother said

[1:40:34] now Jesus warned of this day I'm just
[1:40:37] going to do like a a a flip side of all
[1:40:39] these things so so in Matthew 24 Jesus
[1:40:43] says and because iniquity shall abound
[1:40:46] the love of many shall wax C he's
[1:40:48] warning of the end time and we can see
[1:40:50] that in this world the love of many has
[1:40:52] wax
[1:40:53] we see why that's why there's divorce on
[1:40:55] every side and ruined homes and now it's
[1:40:58] Blended families has become the Norman
[1:41:00] you know there's a lot of pain
[1:41:01] associated with those things it's
[1:41:02] because because of iniquity upon the
[1:41:05] Earth the love of people is waxed
[1:41:07] cold and that is the same in the church
[1:41:10] World Pete y Christians are the the
[1:41:12] fervent desire hey you you you go back
[1:41:15] 50 years you go back just after isusa
[1:41:19] Street Pentecostal people they're on
[1:41:21] fire for God Amen and mean they were
[1:41:24] they were sold out they were thrown out
[1:41:26] and they were sold out and they didn't
[1:41:28] care you know when I was in Papa guine
[1:41:30] last Pastor Robert knucker there who's
[1:41:33] who he was in the PNG Bible Church
[1:41:35] well-connected man in the country he
[1:41:37] said pastors are just quitting left
[1:41:39] right and Center just quitting because
[1:41:41] they give themselves and they give
[1:41:42] themselves and then they get burnt out
[1:41:44] and they and and they just quit why is
[1:41:47] that because there's a coldness there's
[1:41:49] a cold drafter is coming amen because of
[1:41:52] iniquity the of many's and that's not
[1:41:54] they're sincere people I'm not saying
[1:41:56] you know I'm not saying they're not
[1:41:57] sincere this but they're just burnt out
[1:42:00] they can't do it anymore why cu the love
[1:42:03] and it's God has to put that there that
[1:42:05] is wax cold and they just throw it
[1:42:08] away and now but this is not what we're
[1:42:11] called to do I just want to read
[1:42:13] something from the church age book it's
[1:42:14] from it's about the Ephesian Church age
[1:42:17] he said now excuse me
[1:42:24] now the complaint against the Ephesian
[1:42:25] church we understand was um you know
[1:42:28] that they had left their first love this
[1:42:30] one thing I have against you you have
[1:42:31] lost your first love now he speaks now
[1:42:35] he he says this is from the church book
[1:42:36] he says you start out with truly born-
[1:42:39] again Believers and when the next
[1:42:41] Generation comes along they're no longer
[1:42:44] just plain
[1:42:45] Christians they have to take a
[1:42:47] denominational name and an now Baptist
[1:42:49] Methodist Etc that is exactly what they
[1:42:52] are too they're not Christians you have
[1:42:54] to be born of the will of God not of the
[1:42:56] will of man to be saved but these folks
[1:42:59] are all coming together now by the will
[1:43:00] of man I don't say that some of them
[1:43:03] aren't right with God not for a minute
[1:43:05] do I say that but the original fire has
[1:43:07] died down yes they are not the same
[1:43:09] anymore the fervent desire to please God
[1:43:13] the passion to know his word the cry for
[1:43:15] the reaching out in the spirit all
[1:43:17] begins to fade and instead of that
[1:43:19] church being on fire with the fire of
[1:43:21] God it is cooled off and become a bit
[1:43:24] formal that is what was happening back
[1:43:27] there to the Ephesians they getting a
[1:43:28] bit formal the abandonment to God was
[1:43:31] dying out and the people weren't too
[1:43:33] careful about what God thought of them
[1:43:36] as they begin to be careful about the
[1:43:37] world thought of them now remember the
[1:43:41] Ephesians the word Ephesus means to aim
[1:43:43] at but relax so they aimed at the high
[1:43:45] calling in Christ and but that age begin
[1:43:47] to relax that's why he said now that
[1:43:50] they they when they came and there was a
[1:43:51] fire for God and the aband out to God
[1:43:54] and the desire to know his word and
[1:43:55] crying out in the spirit that begin to
[1:43:57] fade yes and now brother Ram tells us at
[1:43:59] the end of the age at the end of this
[1:44:01] age is other Ephesians again that that a
[1:44:04] people would would because they begin to
[1:44:06] drift and the church eventually died now
[1:44:08] it's come forth and now the believer has
[1:44:10] that the the bride worldwide has come to
[1:44:13] another Ephesians and I can tell you
[1:44:15] this much that we do not have another
[1:44:17] seven Church ages we have not another
[1:44:20] time where where people can look at the
[1:44:22] land and say every promise is good but
[1:44:24] we can't take it you and then go back
[1:44:27] into the Wilderness again but there's a
[1:44:28] people here that are not going to not
[1:44:31] going to burn down they're not just
[1:44:33] going to settle down and be formal
[1:44:35] because you're got to take the opposite
[1:44:37] of what was happening in the Ephesian
[1:44:38] age you got to take the opposite cuz
[1:44:40] instead of us going down and drifting we
[1:44:42] just keep going up amen that there's
[1:44:44] something in us that says I will not go
[1:44:46] the way like they did but I'm going to
[1:44:48] take everything that belongs to me if
[1:44:50] healing is in there I got healing if
[1:44:53] restoration of families in there they're
[1:44:54] going to be restored if there's
[1:44:56] Redemption for me I'm going to have
[1:44:57] Redemption amen if there's peace in
[1:44:59] there there's going to be peace amen if
[1:45:01] there's a body change in there I'm going
[1:45:02] to have a body change of all things that
[1:45:05] he has I become I'm going to have that
[1:45:07] Hallelujah we have not being called to
[1:45:10] just become formal and a bit formal amen
[1:45:12] but I trust I believe God has put a fire
[1:45:14] in a Zeal and a Zeal isn't always a big
[1:45:17] burning Wildfire but it's a Burning
[1:45:19] Flame I mean it's in someone say I'm
[1:45:21] going to serve God doesn't matter how
[1:45:23] much I express it there's a burning
[1:45:25] there's a there's a Burning Flame in
[1:45:27] them I trust it's in you am mean there's
[1:45:29] something in you said whatever comes if
[1:45:32] my family leaves if my pastor leave if
[1:45:34] my church disappears I'm going to serve
[1:45:36] God I'm going to walk with him as this
[1:45:39] message is said amen I'm going to follow
[1:45:41] my alas all the way to Isaac Hallelujah
[1:45:44] so they had to go down so I'll say this
[1:45:46] now that the fervent desire to please
[1:45:49] God the passion to know his word to cry
[1:45:51] for the reaching out of the all begins
[1:45:54] to increase Hallelujah and that's where
[1:45:56] we are friends hey if you're encumbered
[1:45:59] by something and it's getting in the way
[1:46:01] kick it off amen you say I've got to
[1:46:04] absolutely live your life love your
[1:46:05] children raise them work through all
[1:46:07] these things kick out
[1:46:10] Facebook kick out all the stuff thaty
[1:46:12] it's getting in the way kick it out am
[1:46:15] amen kick out what you say well I need
[1:46:17] to know what's happening this is what's
[1:46:19] happening this is modern events are made
[1:46:22] clear by the prophecy brother R tells us
[1:46:25] he says now and what does he go to he
[1:46:28] goes to Luke chap 24 what's happening in
[1:46:31] Luke 24 there's two Believers amen going
[1:46:34] on the way to emus their world has
[1:46:36] fallen apart they think their Revival is
[1:46:38] dead yes amen their great Messiah they
[1:46:42] believe as the Messiah is dead yesen the
[1:46:44] church leaders have locked themselves
[1:46:46] away once committed suicide we've never
[1:46:49] been in that situation
[1:46:51] friends and they do have no
[1:46:54] idea that the resurrection's taking
[1:46:56] place the greatest week in history the
[1:46:58] prophet tells us is being lived out in
[1:47:00] their part of it and their whole world
[1:47:02] is falling apart and here they are
[1:47:04] walking
[1:47:05] along and here comes someone that they
[1:47:08] don't recognize but they've walked with
[1:47:11] amen for a couple of years and he begins
[1:47:14] to open the word to us he begins to
[1:47:16] speak to them and he begins to identify
[1:47:19] was he not Cru was he not given to the
[1:47:21] hands of wicked men did he not cry out
[1:47:23] my God my God was H forsaken me did he
[1:47:26] not have a tomb you know did he not use
[1:47:27] a tomb and all these different things
[1:47:29] and you know didn't didn't Moses speak
[1:47:31] of him and he went all the way staying
[1:47:33] from Moses and the Psalms he spoke of
[1:47:35] everything concerning himself he opened
[1:47:37] the scripture Amen to them Hallelujah
[1:47:41] and then now and then they came into the
[1:47:43] house at evening time and they sat down
[1:47:47] and had a meal and he took the bread and
[1:47:50] he did something he did before he died
[1:47:51] on the cross and then their eyes are
[1:47:53] opened and they knew it was him
[1:47:56] Hallelujah they recognized they're in
[1:47:58] the resurrection hallelujah amen and the
[1:48:01] greatest thing was now the resurrected
[1:48:04] one that they didn't recognize came by
[1:48:06] their way if you're wondering what's
[1:48:09] going on in the world speak of speak of
[1:48:11] what's look at it in the scripture they
[1:48:13] were talking about the word being
[1:48:14] fulfilled in their hour they couldn't
[1:48:16] put it together they didn't understand
[1:48:17] what was going on and then they weren't
[1:48:19] talking about Moses they weren't talking
[1:48:22] about maybe how the creation happened
[1:48:24] they're talking about well here we
[1:48:26] believed he was going to be the one and
[1:48:28] we saw him on the donkey come into the
[1:48:30] city nean crying out hosana and we
[1:48:32] thought now finally he's going to drive
[1:48:33] the Romans out because never a man spake
[1:48:35] like this man and we saw him C the sea
[1:48:37] and we saw him raised Lazarus and we saw
[1:48:40] him do all these things nature obeyed
[1:48:42] him every devil in hell obeyed him
[1:48:44] everything was under his feet but yet he
[1:48:46] was taken you know he was like a sheep
[1:48:48] done before the slaughter and all these
[1:48:50] things and now he's been taken he's been
[1:48:53] you know this is what they're talking
[1:48:54] about amen and now the resurrected one
[1:48:58] comes their way and he opens the word to
[1:49:00] them and it causes them to see this is
[1:49:04] where you are this is where you are if
[1:49:07] you know where you are in here you need
[1:49:08] to know where you are in
[1:49:11] hereall the church world knows that
[1:49:13] Jesus died rose again is coming again
[1:49:15] but where are but where are we in here
[1:49:18] because if you don't know where you are
[1:49:19] in here you don't know where how how
[1:49:22] soon it is to to go to where you're
[1:49:25] going amen that's why we need to look
[1:49:27] into the word and say this is where we
[1:49:29] are and
[1:49:31] so he he broke the bread and he did
[1:49:34] something he did before he was crucified
[1:49:36] and now brother Ram says that whole
[1:49:38] chapter is modern events made clear by
[1:49:41] Pro made clear by the prophecy and he
[1:49:43] reads Luke chapter 24 and in the
[1:49:45] beginning of that chapter now we have
[1:49:48] the woman going to the tomb and they
[1:49:50] know about spices they know about the
[1:49:52] Dead know about all these things but
[1:49:55] then they come now to the tomb and the
[1:49:57] stones rolled away and an angel appears
[1:50:00] and says he's not here but he's risen
[1:50:03] amen amen and you may be going to the
[1:50:06] tomb you may be going somewhere that
[1:50:09] maybe he was here where I you know maybe
[1:50:12] this place but I God's saying he's not
[1:50:16] there but he's risen amen I mean don't
[1:50:18] look into some dead tomb amen go to
[1:50:21] where he is amen and then they went
[1:50:23] there and they didn't understand all all
[1:50:25] the angels and all these things and they
[1:50:28] were part of that they were part of the
[1:50:32] Resurrection but on the way tomus the
[1:50:35] woman that went to the tomb they went
[1:50:37] into the upper room you understand and
[1:50:41] the resurrection didn't finish when
[1:50:42] Jesus arose but the resurrection
[1:50:46] continued on now when that same Jesus in
[1:50:48] different form came in to those 120 and
[1:50:51] they were resurrected from a life of
[1:50:53] death and trespass and sins and were
[1:50:55] alive and you in Jesus Christ so they
[1:50:57] were part of that Resurrection seasonall
[1:51:00] Hallelujah glory and we are here so
[1:51:03] brother says these modern events 2015
[1:51:07] are made clear by Luke
[1:51:09] 24 amen this is oh I need to know I need
[1:51:13] to read the news read Luke
[1:51:16] 24 but notice in Luke 24 Jesus when he
[1:51:20] rose he didn't go speak to pilate he
[1:51:22] didn't speak to chaes or go to the
[1:51:24] temple he went to his elected ones that
[1:51:27] were part of the word and he made them
[1:51:30] he made them deadly sure that they knew
[1:51:33] I've risen you're going to be
[1:51:36] risen
[1:51:37] Hallelujah and this caused them now to
[1:51:41] recognize it's not just they were in the
[1:51:43] resurrection but it caus them to
[1:51:44] recognize they are part of that
[1:51:46] resurrection and brother R preaches in
[1:51:48] the it is the rising of the sun he says
[1:51:50] what a resurrection that was says what a
[1:51:53] resurrection this is anden a people have
[1:51:55] come out of a tomb of dark
[1:51:57] denominationalism and me have come forth
[1:51:59] in newness of Life what a resurrection
[1:52:01] this is I mean there's a resurrected
[1:52:03] people upon the Earth that are not dead
[1:52:05] and trespasses and sins anymore but have
[1:52:08] come forth a newness of Life Hallelujah
[1:52:11] and he' speak these things saying this
[1:52:12] is where you areen and the world's fall
[1:52:15] their world was falling apart this world
[1:52:17] is falling apart amen people are
[1:52:20] troubled by these things they were
[1:52:21] troubled by the things that were going
[1:52:23] on but then the Lord came their way and
[1:52:27] that's why I say this unseen one that
[1:52:29] walks with you is the most important
[1:52:32] one when he went there they didn't you
[1:52:35] know he was in his glorified state but
[1:52:37] he didn't reveal himself fly who he was
[1:52:39] but then he just pointed himself out in
[1:52:42] the
[1:52:42] word amen now that is for the first Adam
[1:52:46] the first Adam is identifying himself in
[1:52:48] the word and then now I mean sorry the
[1:52:51] second Adam is identif finding himself
[1:52:53] in the word Jesus is the second Adam and
[1:52:55] then now we have come to the end of the
[1:52:56] ages and now if he's the second Adam
[1:53:00] there must be a second Eve yes amen the
[1:53:03] woman has to be restored and then now
[1:53:05] here comes a part of that second Eve a
[1:53:08] prophet a redeemed son amen and God that
[1:53:11] that second Adam steps into that man and
[1:53:15] begins to identify now the second Eve in
[1:53:18] the
[1:53:20] scripture amen that's why he preaches
[1:53:23] invisible Union that's why he preaches
[1:53:25] choosing of a bride that's why he
[1:53:26] preaches all these things amen that's
[1:53:29] why he preaches on the
[1:53:31] Jubilee Hallelujah that's why he
[1:53:33] preaches on all these things CU he's

[2:03:04] promised he would do for us amen has he
[2:03:08] not prom has he not done
[2:03:10] it he said if you remain
[2:03:13] humble my word will go forth and my
[2:03:16] children will come and they'll find
[2:03:17] their
[2:03:18] rest has he not done what he promised he
[2:03:21] would do
[2:03:22] have we not seen the great Pillar of
[2:03:24] Fire move Among Us you say I've never

[2:03:44] us the grace to wear the
[2:03:46] through amen hasn't he given us the
[2:03:48] grace that if we've been tried by all
[2:03:50] kinds of things yet we love him more and
[2:03:52] more yeah has it you know you take job

[2:04:34] he complained but he sined not yet
[2:04:36] against God with his mouth the scripture
[2:04:38] tells us and he was able to endure until
[2:04:40] finally he saw the Resurrection come
[2:04:44] Hallelujah sometimes we have to just
[2:04:46] plow through sometimes God heals us like
[2:04:48] this sometimes he uses medicine or a
[2:04:50] changeing diet sometimes we just got to
[2:04:52] bear it for a season but God allows
[2:04:55] those different things to come upon you
[2:04:57] because God has said to Satan try her
[2:04:59] she's perfect she's not going to deny me
[2:05:02] Hallelujah you can do whatever you want

[2:08:38] good Hallelujah to take our sin away am
[2:08:41] mean to change our nature Amen to cause
[2:08:44] us just to fall in love with him it's
[2:08:46] Inc you can't buy what we have you say
[2:08:49] I'm just getting from week to week you
[2:08:51] can't buy what you have money you know
[2:08:54] there's a guy he made the Minecraft game
[2:08:56] never played it
[2:08:57] billionaire and he's he's he's he's down
[2:09:00] and depressed and empty cuz he
[2:09:03] discovered what uh how they call it now
[2:09:05] it's it's it's
[2:09:06] affluenza people who affid have all the
[2:09:09] money but yet they're empty
[2:09:11] inside
[2:09:13] well yeah of course they don't have the
[2:09:16] Lord you know cuz they have everything
[2:09:18] but they're empty yet they look at us
[2:09:21] and say you have nothing but we have
[2:09:23] everything Hallelujah cuz we have himen
[2:09:26] hallelujah amen they shouldn't be
[2:09:28] worried about it they should be the most
[2:09:30] happy thing we know
[2:09:32] of and he says it's a love affair and
[2:09:36] how we ought to love one another because
[2:09:38] we're fellow citizens in the same body
[2:09:40] we should have love one for
[2:09:42] another uh he says warning us a time is
[2:09:45] at hand Believers should be separating
[2:09:47] themselves from the things of the world
[2:09:48] the cares of the world they say it
[2:09:50] should be a love of fear and how do you
[2:09:52] know if someone loves their brother and
[2:09:55] sister they love the Lord amen you can't
[2:09:58] just say I love Jesus I don't want
[2:09:59] nothing to do with the Brethren amen
[2:10:02] because everything everything that is
[2:10:04] that is our relationship with him has a
[2:10:07] outworking here that's why you see now a
[2:10:10] real dad in his position who knows what
[2:10:13] the hand of redemption is amen can can
[2:10:16] take his family and lift them up to
[2:10:19] where he is amen
[2:10:22] you know the problem is people like Mary
[2:10:23] and Joseph these days they go to you
[2:10:26] know like they go to Jerusalem during
[2:10:29] the Passover they have a wonderful time
[2:10:32] and then they leave assuming that their
[2:10:34] kids are coming with them yes and three
[2:10:36] days joury they discover Hey where's
[2:10:38] Jesus take your kids
[2:10:41] with you say well they don't they're
[2:10:43] only this big take them
[2:10:45] with amen don't don't walk on with God
[2:10:49] and they they're back somewhere in the
[2:10:51] existence right remember Redemption is
[2:10:53] to lift what belongs to you and lift it
[2:10:57] up that's what Jesus did he redeemed us
[2:11:00] because he saw something in you he saw a
[2:11:01] part of himself so he lifted you up out
[2:11:03] of a world of sin and then he
[2:11:05] transformed you and he brought you to be
[2:11:08] co-equal with him that's what Redemption

[2:12:45] look what was once God's Great secret
[2:12:49] great mysterious Secret in his mind mind
[2:12:52] is now put in the hearts of the
[2:12:55] believer remember
[2:12:57] alasa called Rebecca to become one with
[2:13:00] Isaac and now Alazar now was telling
[2:13:04] Rebecca things that he knew about Isaac
[2:13:07] that no one else
[2:13:08] knew amen and it wasn't his opinion he
[2:13:13] was actually revealing the heart of
[2:13:15] Isaac it's like that's why the prophet
[2:13:17] Came Upon the Earth he's revealing the
[2:13:19] he's revealing God
[2:13:22] and and only a way that the bride can
[2:13:24] catch it and become one with him amen
[2:13:27] he's revealing things many people saw
[2:13:30] the
[2:13:31] Miracles but the bride saw
[2:13:33] Christ amen they saw the man Christ
[2:13:36] Jesus and so now he would speak things
[2:13:41] that Drew you into a relationship with
[2:13:44] Christ and things that you rejoice in
[2:13:48] people can look at the same thing and
[2:13:49] say what's so neat about that
[2:13:51] where you can go to the Book of Ruth and
[2:13:54] sure people can maybe see the Plan of
[2:13:55] Redemption but you can see yourself in
[2:13:57] there and it becomes a living this is
[2:14:00] not stories becomes a living reality you
[2:14:03] can see yourself and you're with Joseph
[2:14:05] and you're up in the palace when he
[2:14:06] reveals himself to his Brethren and you
[2:14:08] can see yourself as Ruth and Rahab and
[2:14:10] you can see yourself as Tamar and all
[2:14:12] these different ones and Basher and you
[2:14:14] can see yourself in the word and it's
[2:14:16] not you trying to work it out something
[2:14:18] just something just it just comes off
[2:14:20] the page I trust you know what I'm not
[2:14:22] trying to make it mysterious but you
[2:14:23] know what I mean where you can just read
[2:14:25] it and something says that's me and you
[2:14:27] identify with that person in in the
[2:14:29] scripture it's because now the heart of
[2:14:31] God's being expressed amen that goes
[2:14:34] beyond a newspaper but it becomes a
[2:14:36] living Christ comes off the
[2:14:39] pages
[2:14:40] Hallelujah man just that just just that
[2:14:44] shouting grounds right there am amen
[2:14:46] just to see what God just just never
[2:14:49] take for granted
[2:14:51] if I repeat myself I don't care don't
[2:14:53] take for granted if this is alive to you
[2:14:55] if this is this alive to you you're the
[2:14:58] most blessed person upon the Earth amen
[2:15:01] that the word of God is alive to you
[2:15:03] hallelujah hallelujah that's that is the
[2:15:05] you can't put God reveals himself to his
[2:15:08] elected ones that's right amen whosoever
[2:15:11] will let them come short but if God has
[2:15:13] become real and this is not a newspaper
[2:15:17] anymore they say well it's a newspaper
[2:15:19] to me Just Surrender Your Life life just
[2:15:22] be willing to give all and then he'll
[2:15:23] come and make it real amen hallelujah
[2:15:26] hey I there was a day where this was a
[2:15:27] story and then it became real and it was
[2:15:30] only after I said Lord take everything
[2:15:31] out of my life that's contrary to your
[2:15:33] word that you can dwell in me what I
[2:15:36] what you know I didn't know anything
[2:15:38] apart from that I meant it with all my
[2:15:40] heart you have to pray some big long
[2:15:42] prayer just be
[2:15:43] real and then he came and just did what
[2:15:45] only he can do Hallelujah Glory now so
[2:15:50] now he's whispering remember Faith
[2:15:51] cometh by hearing and hearing the word
[2:15:53] of
[2:15:53] God and that also creates love yeah so
[2:15:58] when he whispers his secrets in your ear
[2:16:01] when this becomes alive hey the more God
[2:16:03] has opened this to
[2:16:05] me and don't say well you because you
[2:16:08] preach you understand things no it's God
[2:16:09] just being God when he when when he
[2:16:12] quickens this to you it creates a love
[2:16:16] I'm just speaking from experience it
[2:16:17] creates a love for me and then so now
[2:16:20] when alaza was speaking things to
[2:16:22] Rebecca it created a love for Isaac amen
[2:16:26] amen in her so now he's saying he's
[2:16:29] saying now Christ manifested in you he
[2:16:31] says look what was once God's Great
[2:16:33] secret great mysterious Secret in his
[2:16:35] mind is now put in the hearts of the
[2:16:38] believer that is the body of Christ what
[2:16:41] was God God's once great Secret in his
[2:16:44] mind before the foundation of the world
[2:16:45] is now manifest he says think of it
[2:16:48] friends I'm sure he says he says I'm
[2:16:52] sure we don't get it
[2:16:54] well um he says he says I can't see it
[2:16:59] in the way I ought to and I'm sure you
[2:17:00] don't either he says but God's great
[2:17:03] mystery what Eternal God has a mystery
[2:17:06] has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ
[2:17:09] then has been given down to his church
[2:17:13] what was once in God's mind is now in
[2:17:15] the body of Christ Jesus making love to
[2:17:18] the church's bride whispering secrets to

[2:17:30] next to you and you love her and
[2:17:33] everything he says you know how it is
[2:17:34] what is that now you tell her things and
[2:17:36] share things doesn't matter even if you
[2:17:38] maybe don't talk a whole bunch you'll
[2:17:40] tell your wife things that you don't
[2:17:42] tell anyone else what is that your
[2:17:44] revealing
[2:17:45] Secrets amen because you're in a
[2:17:47] relationship with her amen because she's
[2:17:50] part of you
[2:17:51] and then so now God comes and he
[2:17:53] whispers Secrets am amen things things
[2:17:58] that you can't work out but he's
[2:18:00] Whispering Secrets because he loves
[2:18:02] you Hallelujah am mean and it creates a
[2:18:05] love of fear
[2:18:08] Hallelujah now you know how it is that's
[2:18:10] what God Christ is doing to the church
[2:18:13] see he's letting her know the secrets
[2:18:15] just the secrets not these flirters I
[2:18:18] mean his wife see all right by having
[2:18:20] having the revelation of his secret made
[2:18:22] known to them by his grace how the grace
[2:18:24] of God people I know it I hope you don't
[2:18:27] think it sounds personal to a bunch of
[2:18:29] people or this uh that but the secret
[2:18:32] that God is sharing with the whole
[2:18:33] church if they would just receive it see
[2:18:36] it doesn't mean just me or just you it
[2:18:39] means the church that he's trying to get
[2:18:41] into it
[2:18:43] hallelujah oh is that the time okay I
[2:18:48] might I might just leave it there
[2:18:51] but God yeah it's it's 252 I got like
[2:18:55] four more pages
[2:18:59] now but this is God no don't don't take
[2:19:02] it for granted now this is a love affair
[2:19:04] between him and you amen and remember he
[2:19:06] initiated the love affair you're just a
[2:19:09] responder amen so the more he pours in
[2:19:12] you just pour it back to him hallelujah
[2:19:15] it's a love affair amen cuz we're on our
[2:19:17] way amen changing the body to me our
[2:19:21] Isaac
[2:19:22] hallelujah amen that is where we're
[2:19:24] going sorry I don't even have time to
[2:19:26] finish the next part but you see you
[2:19:28] know don't take it for granted when God
[2:19:31] opens this to
[2:19:33] you treasure it treasure it with all
[2:19:35] your life because there's there's been
[2:19:38] schools and institutions that have given
[2:19:40] their whole men have given men and women
[2:19:42] have given lives to study this and they
[2:19:46] don't hold the key they don't understand
[2:19:48] what it says and yet he'll come come to
[2:19:51] you and you'll be reading something and
[2:19:54] it'll just open up and and become
[2:19:57] real and they look at the same thing and
[2:20:00] they just see they don't see what it's
[2:20:02] really saying remember brother Ram TS he
[2:20:05] says it's like when his wife writes him
[2:20:07] a letter and she's writing you know had
[2:20:09] a busy day I just put the kids to bed
[2:20:11] and all these different things and he
[2:20:12] says because she he loves her he reads
[2:20:15] between the lines of the letter and
[2:20:17] rarely sees her heart now it's the same
[2:20:20] with the scripture reading between the
[2:20:22] lines doesn't make it say anything
[2:20:23] different but because you're in a
[2:20:25] relationship am me with the author you
[2:20:27] can rarely see what he's
[2:20:29] saying
[2:20:31] hallelujah
[2:20:32] amen and that's why you got to be in a
[2:20:36] relationship amen don't just look in and
[2:20:38] say why are these people so excited
[2:20:40] enter into a relationship amen amen with
[2:20:43] Jesus Christ and you'll see why we're
[2:20:44] excited amen because the Bible says in
[2:20:47] Romans that the love of God is
[2:20:50] brought in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[2:20:52] which is given to us
[2:20:54] [Music]
[2:20:55] hallelujah amen and that's where we are
[2:20:57] can we have some musicians Amen to come
[2:21:00] I think we should just I don't know if
[2:21:01] we have the song but you say alasa tell
[2:21:03] me
[2:21:04] more amen you listen to the word listen
[2:21:07] to the message I never I'm probably you
[2:21:10] know I learned something in in um maybe
[2:21:12] I'm not built this way but in in
[2:21:15] University I learned one
[2:21:17] thing that people can study they can
[2:21:20] give their lives and study things now
[2:21:21] there
[2:21:22] biochemistry and they can give their
[2:21:25] whole life and study it but then they
[2:21:27] miss the very creator that they're
[2:21:29] talking about and they can even use you
[2:21:32] we were looking at uh the active s of
[2:21:35] enzymes and how it works like blood how
[2:21:37] it picks up oxygen and how it does its
[2:21:39] thing and they would use the words like
[2:21:41] it's so welld
[2:21:43] designed so welld design and it is
[2:21:45] well-designed but do they believe in God
[2:21:48] no sir not for a second
[2:21:51] they think it's wrong that people take
[2:21:52] this
[2:21:54] literally
[2:21:55] amen now and I and I discovered there
[2:21:58] that people can study something with
[2:22:00] their mind with their
[2:22:02] mind and they can miss the whole thing
[2:22:05] but if you study it now with your heart
[2:22:08] and say Lord open it to me so if you
[2:22:10] take your mind you'll never see it if
[2:22:12] you say Lord open it to me and study it
[2:22:14] with your heart then he'll open it am
[2:22:18] you understand and so that's that's why
[2:22:20] I say when you listen to the tapes don't
[2:22:23] just don't just have in your mind now
[2:22:24] I'm going to listen about perfect Faith
[2:22:26] or or whatever just say Lord speak to me
[2:22:28] out of this message speak to me out of
[2:22:30] the unveiling of God like brother Donnie
[2:22:32] was saying and new things open up why is
[2:22:34] that cuz it's listening from your heart
[2:22:36] alasa what are you telling me about my
[2:22:38] Isaac amen amen tell me more am then
[2:22:42] what happens it creates more love for
[2:22:44] him it creates a love of fear Hallelujah
[2:22:47] you want to see a people madly in love
[2:22:49] look at the bride of Christ
[2:22:51] amen they may not be so expressive in it
[2:22:53] but there's something in them saying I
[2:22:54] love him he is he is king of my life I
[2:22:58] don't have my own op I don't want my
[2:23:00] opinion anymore amen I want him amen
[2:23:03] that he'd have preeminence in every
[2:23:05] facet of my life that's incredible thing
[2:23:08] amen for a man or woman or child just to
[2:23:10] give their whole life not just that
[2:23:12] they'd be saved but he's Lord over every
[2:23:15] every facet Hallelujah that's incredible
[2:23:19] thing man has spent thousands of years
[2:23:22] saying I'll do it my way and now there's
[2:23:25] a bride at the end time and Satan's Eden
[2:23:26] saying I don't want my way anymore
[2:23:29] hallelujah what a paradox that is
[2:23:32] hallelujah and and here we are so all
[2:23:33] that so how can I obtain to that you
[2:23:35] already have that if you want in your
[2:23:37] heart to Lord I want to serve you cuz I
[2:23:39] love you what is that he's become head
[2:23:43] over your life and you want him to do
[2:23:45] whatever he wants amen hallelujah I'll
[2:23:48] never be that kind of a Christian you
[2:23:51] you've given everything yes that's why I
[2:23:54] think you know the unveiling of God also
[2:23:56] unveils you this The Book of Revelation
[2:23:58] unveils you as well am and many times we
[2:24:01] look at these things and say how
[2:24:02] incredible that is yes and then we say
[2:24:05] we could never become what's being
[2:24:06] spoken of I think a lot of time we just
[2:24:08] need to look into the
[2:24:10] mirror and actually say now this is
[2:24:13] me amen when brother Bram said that God
[2:24:16] and the bride is one that she is him she
[2:24:19] is the feminine part of you just go back
[2:24:22] into Genesis Hallelujah Eve Eve was
[2:24:25] taken out of Adam she didn't even have
[2:24:27] the name Eve yet she was just she was
[2:24:28] called Adam and then now when God brings
[2:24:32] Eve Eve was in Adam she was there when
[2:24:36] he had dominion over the Earth as Spirit
[2:24:38] from all these things she wasn't she was
[2:24:40] in him when when he did it but she
[2:24:42] wasn't fully conscious of what's going
[2:24:43] she was just in him and then now Eve Eve
[2:24:46] comes out of Adam and it wasn't Eve
[2:24:49] going to Adam saying
[2:24:50] I am flesh of your flesh bone of your
[2:24:53] bone I am you it was Adam that said you
[2:24:55] are Flesh of My Flesh bone of my bone
[2:24:58] you are me you are man amen and now so
[2:25:01] God has come down in this end time
[2:25:04] because he has determined that he would
[2:25:06] tell you you are Flesh of My Flesh your
[2:25:10] bone of my bone your life of my life
[2:25:12] your power of my power you are me
[2:25:15] Hallelujah we think we can never become
[2:25:17] those things yes just read what the word
[2:25:20] say says about you amen hallelujah you
[2:25:23] know the devil father had the vision he
[2:25:26] was a man who wasn't his dad but looked
[2:25:28] like his dad there was a woman who
[2:25:29] looked like his mom but wasn't his mom
[2:25:32] and this man had a three-edged club and
[2:25:34] was beating this woman down and she'd
[2:25:36] try and raise up again and he just beat
[2:25:38] her down and brother said I've got to do
[2:25:40] something about this you know about this
[2:25:43] said but I'm so little he said now Faith
[2:25:45] muscles begin to grow and he grabbed
[2:25:47] that man said you touch her again you
[2:25:49] got to deal with me
[2:25:50] the interpretation was now that woman
[2:25:53] was the bride of Christ trying to raise
[2:25:56] up and he was the trinitarian spirit
[2:25:59] beating beating her down
[2:26:01] amen now so the devil uses uses
[2:26:06] Christianity to beat down the bride of
[2:26:08] Christ and that's a trinitarian devil
[2:26:11] spirit amen doesn't matter if they say
[2:26:13] it's one God or whatever that's still
[2:26:15] that same demon spirit amen but God
[2:26:17] doesn't work that way he wants you to
[2:26:19] recognize amen he wants to see his
[2:26:21] victory of the Cross being lived out and
[2:26:23] that Victory is now the woman becomes me
[2:26:26] Hallelujah he wants to lift you up Amen
[2:26:29] to be exactly what you're called to be
[2:26:32] hallelujah amen amen now we need to sing
