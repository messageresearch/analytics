[4:23] good morning everyone welcome to church
[4:27] this morning who's ready to praise the
[4:29] Lord amen
[4:32] [Music]
[4:33] David said I was happy when they said to
[4:35] me let us go into the house of the Lord
[4:37] I mean you know we can just always
[4:39] praise the Lord and every situation so
[4:42] we great for the we can be here this
[4:45] morning there's some one of these mics
[4:48] are going funny the ones that are going
[4:50] funny of the mic was Sampson on it I
[4:53] said it just needs the anointing to come
[4:56] on and we'll all work you know Samson
[4:59] Samson wasn't much on his own you know
[5:02] he was you see the old picture Bible
[5:06] stories and Samson's as big strong
[5:08] muscly men with the ability and over
[5:11] brother branham said it wasn't like that
[5:12] he was the skinny guy that he didn't
[5:14] look like he'll be the sort of guy that
[5:16] could pick up a big gate and carried out
[5:18] of the city or slay hundreds of men with
[5:20] a jawbone and actually in the natural
[5:23] sense he wasn't but when the anointing
[5:26] of God came upon him that changed
[5:28] everything changed everything
[5:31] and that's the same with us you know we
[5:33] don't actually have ability we're not
[5:36] these mighty people and ourselves they
[5:38] can do these great things but when the
[5:39] Spirit of God comes upon us when we're
[5:41] anointed by the Spirit of God
[5:43] that's when great things happen amen

[22:17] bin comes the first one we've got up as
[22:20] brother Anini lead the way brother and
[22:31] then if you've got one just when he's
[22:34] nearing who else's yeah
[22:39] I'm not friendly about understand it by
[22:55] and by there's a lot so I thank you for
[22:59] paying for the opportunity to share my
[23:01] testimony so we thank you for bringing
[23:04] us back safely from the upland and we
[23:08] actually had a wonderful time
[23:10] praise the Lord so I'm gonna background
[23:18] my testimony with Scripture and then I
[23:23] will hit the point and they conclude
[23:26] with the Prophet so we are privileged
[23:32] people my brothers and sisters I mean we
[23:36] should comport ourselves as such amen
[23:39] hallelujah hallelujah
[23:42] as as the elect of of the Lord so our
[23:46] star will first go into chapter 2 verse
[23:49] 6 how big we speak wisdom among them
[23:51] that appear at a profit
[23:52] yet not the wisdom of this world nor the
[23:56] princes princess of this world that come
[23:59] to naught but we speak to will of God in
[24:02] a mystery even the hidden meat a wisdom
[24:04] which God ordained before the world unto
[24:07] our glory which not of the princess of
[24:12] this world
[24:13] no new four hadn't known it they would
[24:18] they won't have crucified a lot of glory
[24:20] but as it is written eye hath not seen
[24:24] nor ear heard neither have entered into
[24:29] the heart of man the things which God
[24:33] that love him
[24:35] do you love him now look at the next
[24:38] verse
[24:38] so it's still not hanging in air but
[24:41] look at it it says but God had revealed
[24:43] them unto us by his spirit for the
[24:48] spirit such as all things yea the deep
[24:51] things of God amen and so I just read
[24:56] this quote again from the Prophet just
[24:57] to background what what was what to say
[25:01] it
[25:01] it says God's Way that has been made for
[25:04] all said after through the services of
[25:07] this week try to show people that
[25:10] there's no need or being scared the
[25:15] worst see need ever can put on you is
[25:17] fear and he knows how to play the trick
[25:21] but our prophet a man said there is no
[25:26] need to be scared about anything
[25:30] are you serious of why you already know
[25:33] it just just just undock what he said
[25:37] now this week I tried to prove by the
[25:40] scripture that the man has born again of
[25:42] the king of born again of the kingdom of
[25:45] God has nothing to fear you are
[25:48] absolutely sick safely secure in Jesus
[25:53] Christ all the father has given me he
[25:57] said will come to me no man can come
[26:00] less than Father
[26:01] cause the father have got to lead him up
[26:05] to me and me that comes to me I will no
[26:09] wise cast out and all know Mike I'm
[26:13] locked out of my father's hand
[26:16] normal is greater greater he is he died
[26:20] heard my words and believeth on him that
[26:23] sent me
[26:24] everlasting life shall not come
[26:27] into condemnation but has passed from
[26:29] life from death to life he that eateth
[26:34] my flesh and drinks my blood not will
[26:38] help burn half present-tense
[26:43] everlasting life our wisdom of the last
[26:46] day and so we know the theme of the
[26:49] meeting was a rise and shine for the
[26:53] light has come and the glory of God is
[26:55] risen upon thee hallelujah I'm elder
[26:59] brother God uses our brothers so
[27:01] mightily bro David and also appreciate
[27:04] the church in Oakland as well for the
[27:07] sacrifice to guide the bride together
[27:08] and the servant of God I gave all he has
[27:11] a meant to be a blessed person of bright
[27:14] the gutter in Oakland for the Easter
[27:17] weekend and so that's when he said he
[27:20] said I'm not here to get a blessing that
[27:22] will keep me to to the next convention
[27:25] hallelujah
[27:26] so I prepare my heart to receive a
[27:28] blessing that will keep you from here to
[27:30] eternity hallelujah praise the Lord Amen
[27:33] so so so he actually said that with the
[27:39] with the with the the theme of the
[27:42] meeting and preached on that rise and
[27:45] shine took us from the glory and the
[27:48] light of God from revelation to Genesis
[27:51] was mind-blowing
[27:52] it was indeed mind-blowing well they
[27:55] will see the church the church types the
[27:58] moon type the church right and the
[28:00] church has no letter of her oh sorry the
[28:02] moon has no light of her own so she
[28:05] reflects the light of the Sun amen
[28:08] so you don't have to be worried or
[28:10] scared either tomorrow no it is not your
[28:13] righteousness is his righteousness that
[28:19] is bestowed on you and I not because of
[28:22] our anything but His grace and mercy
[28:25] hallelujah so each time you woke up in
[28:28] the morning is time to say lord thank
[28:30] you for today is another day to worship
[28:32] you not to be sad or depressed or this
[28:36] or that but that would draw everything
[28:39] on you
[28:39] at any time to keep you depress give you
[28:43] sad I remember we got something a man
[28:47] much more than the world a main I will
[28:51] need ever can touch if we know whom we
[28:53] are and what God has done for us not
[28:55] just knowing we accept it and we act on
[28:59] it
[29:00] Alleluia okay so we've known to that
[29:04] well what actually hit me most was when
[29:07] he hit esta praise the Lord
[29:09] I mean we know we have read that
[29:11] Scripture and pictures are pitch on that
[29:13] Scripture my brother it was a different
[29:16] thing by the week Easter weekend and I
[29:20] go to share share with you so I said
[29:23] that with Esther to 16 when the Esther
[29:28] was invited I was taking to the king
[29:31] yeah to go to King's presence and guess
[29:35] what it was on the tenth month only
[29:38] seventh year so refresh on 10 7
[29:43] hallelujah when he came down the king
[29:45] came down amen and here we are
[29:49] amen were taking to gospel eater King's
[29:52] presence hallelujah so it's not the
[29:56] brands presence no is a pillow fight
[30:01] amen he came down only to the seventh so
[30:06] if you move it off a man and know that
[30:08] that is you actually have been invited
[30:11] into the presence of the King because
[30:15] you found favor that was what happened
[30:17] to Esther Esther found favor there was
[30:20] nowhere as a liberal qualified she
[30:21] wasn't she was even um in slave if you
[30:26] like captive she was good to be she was
[30:30] least qualified and so you and I there's
[30:33] no way we could make it them better
[30:35] people but God which messy Amen
[30:39] hallelujah came down and and and invited
[30:43] us into his presence
[30:46] amen and so I saw the grace of God
[30:52] just first know what the next to that
[30:56] says Esther obtain grace and favor in
[31:00] his sight
[31:01] Amen so so I put my name there
[31:05] hallelujah and I obtained grace and
[31:08] mercy and that's why he called me
[31:12] hallelujah and if he so called me who is
[31:15] a devil that can stop me ma
[31:19] from living for my lord harlot
[31:22] everything else is is secondary he is
[31:27] number one
[31:28] hallelujah and I look forward to come to
[31:31] his presence to worship Him to worship
[31:36] he that thou found I found for with and
[31:40] he invited me to be his bride hallelujah
[31:45] glory to God and so and we know that
[31:50] first John 14 says that he is full of
[31:53] grace and truth
[31:55] amen and Esther a male found Grace and
[32:00] favor and you have you and I have found
[32:04] grace and favor in his presence amen
[32:08] how much how much more we should be so
[32:12] glad how much Claude ought to be a main
[32:15] looking for to contrast presence not to
[32:19] see what will happen what makes him to
[32:21] happen to put fire amen
[32:25] liquify a fire I bring mine he brings
[32:29] has a Mashable's has I wasn't happened
[32:32] they don't understand here the signal
[32:36] says seek Amanda Bank an austere pound
[32:40] Alleluia
[32:41] the satin hasta sad why because we're in
[32:44] his presence we are found her one inside
[32:47] hallelujah yes and so the other thing
[32:53] that hit me was the own salon esse about
[32:58] when heaven Haman had made his master
[33:03] plan to destroy
[33:06] reduce the elect of God MA and in
[33:12] obedience Tamiya has to prepare herself
[33:16] and by faith she went in now look at
[33:21] here the law of middest and picture that
[33:24] change it not I said anybody will come
[33:27] to the King on in fact who died amen
[33:32] and so the so does nature die and all
[33:37] men have seen good in you and I so
[33:39] where's our hope it was a dare situation
[33:42] it was a dismal situation a situation
[33:45] that that that it was so helpless but
[33:51] look at the mystery torture God
[33:54] hallelujah
[33:56] look at the mystery so that the Esther
[33:59] went in and then said the King or to
[34:03] Esther what will down Queen Esther and
[34:07] what is I request it shall be given D to
[34:13] the half of my kingdom
[34:14] so Esther found grace of heaven and King
[34:21] straight for the scepter and the heat is
[34:25] so well said the scepter I said stick
[34:28] with Leedom with gold deity hallelujah
[34:33] amen and Esther didn't stop that she
[34:37] stepped fork and Tosh the setter ma she
[34:42] acted a man she believed and she acted
[34:45] amen so if we believe we're gonna act on
[34:48] it versus a tight you cannot make me sad
[34:52] you cannot rob my blessing this this
[34:54] morning I'm had this money to receive
[34:57] the Holy Ghost to be healed amen to see
[35:00] what the ask for amen even if my loved
[35:03] ones other than the world is mine praise
[35:05] the Lord
[35:05] okay so so the work with the law what
[35:11] was the law
[35:14] King when invited who died and said that
[35:18] God cannot withdrawn his law so what did
[35:23] he do
[35:24] God Himself deity flesh amen
[35:31] I'm paid and fulfilled and law abiram
[35:38] said if Christ was adding less than God
[35:42] we are all finished
[35:44] there's no holy man yeah that could die
[35:48] for you and I know holy prophet so God
[35:51] himself
[35:52] I said God Himself came and died for me
[35:56] that I'll be free who is it able to hold
[35:59] me back
[36:00] hallelujah oh my soul he catch a God

[42:16] braum said I wasn't the one that
[42:20] appeared down on the river I was only
[42:23] standing there I'm not the one that
[42:33] performs those things and foretells
[42:35] these things that happens as perfect
[42:39] that they are I'm only one that that's
[42:43] near when he does it
[42:45] I was only a voice that he used to say
[42:51] it I wasn't it wasn't what I knew it's
[42:57] what I just render myself to that he
[43:00] spoke true it is in me it wasn't the
[43:04] seventh angel oh no it was the
[43:07] manifestation manifestation of the son
[43:09] of man
[43:10] it wasn't the angel his message was a
[43:13] mystery that God unfolded God and man we
[43:19] look of one again
[43:20] you he may die we won with our Father
[43:25] Amy he was it he says it was it was the
[43:29] mystery that God unfolded it's not a man
[43:33] it's God the angel was not son of man he
[43:37] was the messenger first from the Son of
[43:38] Man the Son of man is Christ he is the
[43:42] one that you are feeding on finally you
[43:46] are not feeding on a man a man his words
[43:51] will fail but look at the dragon you are
[43:56] feeding on the infilling body ward I was
[44:00] not man god bless you amen praise Lord
[44:17] God please everyone we could stand you
[44:19] for hours and hours I know so I just
[44:22] pray that the Lord brings out what you
[44:25] want me to stay in this way okay I just
[44:26] pray that the Lord brings out what he
[44:28] wants to place you guys so just before
[44:32] the time the Satan has really just been
[44:36] playing on my minds of my thoughts
[44:37] because when I read the Bible I really
[44:39] struggle and I don't take much in and
[44:42] then I think what's wrong maybe I'm just
[44:44] a Mike believer coming to church I look
[44:47] the part and I say the right things but
[44:49] there's actually no life in me and so
[44:52] that's been something that's played at
[44:55] my and in the first service already
[44:59] actually it was the second service the
[45:01] first service was a blessing but in the
[45:02] second service the Lord just confirmed
[45:06] to me that I have been called and I have
[45:08] been chosen because it was the one with
[45:10] Easter and brother David said pray what
[45:13] you pray your hearts whoa
[45:16] and man there was lots that I could
[45:17] think of but I just prayed and I said
[45:19] lord I want your mind to be my mind in
[45:22] your words to be my ruin your life to be
[45:25] my life with everything in me and oh man
[45:29] I wish brought when an engine we have to
[45:31] feel so wrong to do this without them
[45:32] but I remember sitting
[45:34] I mean she said she could just in her
[45:35] mind's eye she saw the pillow fire you
[45:38] above me she just saw this fire and so
[45:41] she just knew from Scripture by laying
[45:42] on her hands the Holy Spirit can come
[45:44] down and she did that and it was just so
[45:46] wonderful it was just the Lord
[45:48] reconfirming to me just putting another
[45:49] stake in the ground way I can now turn
[45:52] back and say - say - no no I have been
[45:54] called in the power of the Lord and that
[45:57] service was just so strong and in the
[45:59] last service um and I don't want to say
[46:02] too much about the services because I
[46:03] think just everyone should watch it and
[46:05] just man it's just I was amazing but he
[46:07] was speaking about Peter and John they'd
[46:10] walk past the crippled man at the gate
[46:12] beautiful and um brother David was
[46:15] saying about how that crippled man can
[46:17] represent us spiritually or naturally as
[46:20] well but he talked about how he was also
[46:22] crippled by divorce and it's something
[46:26] that I faced at a young age it had
[46:31] happened with that and after that and it
[46:34] just really struck such a chord in me to
[46:38] see that life had started crippling me
[46:43] sorry and I was that couple person lying
[46:47] on the ground and the Lord st. brought
[46:51] minute Andy my Peter John to say his
[46:55] word and then lifted me up and made me
[46:59] who I would never have been without him
[47:02] and it was just man that was so amazing
[47:06] that was that means so much to me it
[47:08] helped eternally grateful and I want to
[47:10] encourage people cuz Rodman said she
[47:13] never thought it like they spoke to us
[47:14] but David did she actually think maybe
[47:17] something would happen because I think
[47:18] they'd be lots of times we speak to
[47:19] people and nothing ever happens but if
[47:22] they hadn't been diligent to the call
[47:25] you better commit so what he'd wanted
[47:29] where would we be
[47:30] I have so thankful and I'm a children
[47:35] also enjoyed it which has been really
[47:36] lovely it's been something that I've
[47:38] wondered I want the children to ain t in
[47:40] the church I want him to sing with I
[47:42] want him to listen and enjoy in order
[47:44] just want him to be sitting and bored so
[47:45] there was great to see too
[47:47] until last night when I just writing
[47:49] down my words of the testimony I really
[47:51] just wanted to write something for the
[47:53] Lord man I just I don't know how to
[47:54] express the joy of what he's given back
[47:57] and and praise him for what he's done so
[48:00] this is what he's given me and i just i
[48:01] the the poem is written in the saints of
[48:04] that crippled person and jesus touching
[48:06] that crippled person and it sees what
[48:11] can I say to the sinner over there a man
[48:14] just fitted it man just sitting feeling
[48:17] so alone and unaware that he is
[48:20] surrounded by God's angels who are just
[48:22] waiting for him to realize there's a God
[48:24] Almighty how do I show that lady looking
[48:28] Sofie that actually I can see where her
[48:32] heart hesitate with the blood has run
[48:35] dry from wounds that also deep where she
[48:38] feels like there's no reason for her
[48:40] life to keep
[48:41] when little one will you recognize the
[48:44] pool that you feel where it seems your
[48:47] world is tumbling and you can no longer
[48:49] steal your heart and your eyes and your
[48:52] feelings away from all the forbidden
[48:55] that you did that day Oh precious people
[48:59] sinners Saints young and old come to

[49:39] righteousness no one could ever deserve
[49:41] but beloved of the king by grace He is
[49:45] calling you to be his queen
[49:49] [Applause]
[50:02] the other man
[50:19] god bless you Saints
[50:23] yeah so sometimes we knew you know we
[50:26] knew in a serving ministry that and
[50:30] you're sitting in church and you stir
[50:32] the sound this can and maybe this would
[50:34] just bring it to every one of you
[50:36] musicians as well because you're in a
[50:38] ministry and you serve and you always
[50:41] hear diligently at your point of duty
[50:43] you know but you never get sometimes to
[50:45] enter in you never get to be on on that
[50:48] side of of the that line you know it's
[50:52] hard because you go dry you know you
[50:55] you're you serving but you're not
[50:57] concentrating on the word coming over
[50:59] the pulpit because you're so so in your
[51:01] little world to make sure you deliver
[51:03] the mail correctly and that's just my
[51:05] personality that sometimes you need to
[51:08] rejoice as well but it's hard to rejoice
[51:11] when you have an instrument in your hand
[51:12] because you don't want to go forward to
[51:14] the right hand side and throw it all out
[51:16] of cater so you always have to hold back
[51:19] going to the camp I held back but when I
[51:23] got to the camp the Lord gave me a
[51:25] Liberty to actually enter in and to take
[51:29] that little bit of food that comes over
[51:31] the pulpit wonderful revelation deep
[51:33] things that were spoken that I've never
[51:35] really seen that way I mean three mighty
[51:37] men do with a sword and one with a
[51:39] bucket it was such a simple message but
[51:41] yet though
[51:42] the very revelation of that touched me
[51:44] so deep that I wanted to be the one with
[51:47] a bucket but no I took my bucket and
[51:50] you'll go see the service and I go and
[51:52] got my water and I fought my bucket so
[51:55] much over that it's pulled over it's
[51:56] just everywhere I didn't want to miss a
[51:58] drop but it just kept going and then
[52:02] some person said that there's more to
[52:04] come
[52:05] but is more but there's more and it
[52:09] struck me because I was having such a
[52:11] Jubilee that that I was having them all
[52:14] burn and I thought Lord am I out of
[52:17] caterham are now going too far to the
[52:18] left cuz I was jumping around and having
[52:20] such a good time and it struck me and I
[52:23] said no you know what I don't I enjoy
[52:25] serving the Lord
[52:27] I enjoy worshipping with everything in
[52:30] that's why I was designed
[52:32] I wasn't designed to worship some rack
[52:34] be idle I wasn't designed to worship
[52:36] something in the world I was designed to
[52:37] worship Him
[52:39] so why was that thing quiet me down so I
[52:43] stopped right there and I see the very
[52:45] and this is what we should do pray
[52:46] without ceasing I say Lord just revealed
[52:50] to me what you want me to do and the
[52:52] very next sermon rather David came in he
[52:56] Sisk was waste god what am i preaching a
[52:58] God of tomorrow or a God that's right
[53:00] here now and when he said that that you
[53:05] know this is like something holding your
[53:08] back it's like a safety belt and your
[53:11] safety belt but it's like a safety belt
[53:13] and you just want to push forward and
[53:14] even that that thought just hold you
[53:16] back and it just went back on and he
[53:19] says now worship me was all that you
[53:21] have and then I worship because he's
[53:24] worthy of it
[53:25] and I so if anybody says to you you
[53:28] cannot show you cannot jump you cannot
[53:31] enter in it's a lie of the devil you
[53:34] rebuke them we say okay you are allowed
[53:37] to shout you are allowed don't don't do
[53:40] it just because somebody else does it
[53:41] but if something he is just going say
[53:44] how to do you say it it blesses you it
[53:48] pleases you because it keeps you in the
[53:50] service your mind doesn't go away and
[53:52] second of all he is worthy of it so
[53:55] there was a much revelation I got
[53:57] instead of the one true revelation I got
[53:59] is if you're gonna worship me do it with
[54:01] everything you have and be true don't be
[54:05] both be true and I praise the Lord
[54:08] because I needed that feeling I needed
[54:11] it and and it was wonderful
[54:13] so young people you young children you
[54:16] never ever if you feel like shouting
[54:18] aiming and you feel like saying
[54:20] hallelujah and you feel like praising
[54:22] the Lord do not hold back
[54:25] we'll be blessed I promise you there
[54:28] okay some people that some people can
[54:32] missed a blessing that way don't let no
[54:34] one tell you how to serve the Lord it's
[54:36] a personal woman okay and it's a sincere
[54:40] I understand I understand where the
[54:42] thought came from and these more to it
[54:43] but once you can see how you yourself
[54:46] praise the Lord that's how I saw at the
[54:48] camp you praise him with everything you
[54:50] have still be reverent though but yeah
[54:53] these are ballots but if you feel like
[54:56] shouting shout
[54:57] amen amen amen
[55:07] I believe God asks one time where were
[55:11] you with them when the morning stars
[55:13] sang together and all the sons of God
[55:16] shouted for joy
[55:18] amen amen
[55:21] mr. Lundy
[55:39] it's been such a blessing I just I am
[55:43] actually speechless of what the Lord
[55:45] done
[55:46] one thing that came to my mind when I
[55:49] was we were sitting at the back just to
[55:52] make it easier to go in and out with
[55:53] Daniel but to look to the front and to
[55:56] see everybody rejoicing and I thought
[56:01] man there's so many people out there
[56:03] that Coastie rugby games and soccer
[56:06] games and they are rejoicing for the
[56:09] sport and here this bunch of people
[56:12] believe it's saving the hood it's
[56:15] jumping up and down in screaming and
[56:17] shouting and praising the Lord it was
[56:20] such a blessing to see and to be part of
[56:24] that and just to like Chantal see if we
[56:28] can stand here for a very long time of
[56:31] what the Lord has revealed to each one
[56:34] of us and it's been just I think all of
[56:38] us it's been amazing and I just want to
[56:40] praise the Lord
[56:41] for the opportunity that we had and one
[56:43] thing I realized in all the sermons
[56:47] likely that I've heard him especially
[56:48] over the weekend the gloves are off for
[56:56] nothing or you just leave it all buddy
[57:01] just go for it with everything you have
[57:10] [Applause]
[57:21] take my turn yeah so it was a wonderful
[57:25] time yeah there's there's no words to
[57:28] describe it what struck me just from my
[57:34] stature I was thinking of the people
[57:37] that's holding up out our little
[57:39] congregation here when we were out there
[57:42] and when our sermon when the sermon came
[57:45] of the three mighty men of David I was
[57:48] thinking of this brother man we would
[57:57] and I would really recommend everyone go
[58:00] listen to that sermon including you
[58:02] brother and then you can you can enter
[58:05] into our our our burden that we have now
[58:08] of who's going to carry that bucket than
[58:10] this body we will wrestle for it the
[58:15] Lord is good and I was thinking about
[58:19] about our body and I was thinking about
[58:21] these reason not only the three mighty
[58:23] men but the position that's been taken
[58:26] in in all of our then the new ones
[58:29] that's coming and just fits like a glove
[58:33] and it's just beautiful brother Herman
[58:36] that's here and they brought a testimony
[58:38] you know everyone's just filling in the
[58:41] place and the one thing that came out of
[58:45] that is yes pray for this body but we
[58:49] were in Auckland and we've had a
[58:51] wonderful fellowship with people from
[58:53] Taranaki and Christchurch and everywhere
[58:55] pray for them pray for them because they
[58:58] get attacked they have their normal
[59:00] day-to-day they just the challenges that
[59:03] we face we need to pray for them so that
[59:06] they stand ground and yes the filter is
[59:09] off there and the filters off here as
[59:11] well so they will get more attacked we
[59:13] will get you know attacked more even the
[59:17] strategist you know I was thinking about
[59:19] who's going to be in this war in the
[59:22] trenches with me together I'm thinking
[59:25] about brother and Evie he's fighting and
[59:28] we need to be on our knees and be that
[59:31] shoot or that brother

[59:36] brother Isaac that's so flat-footed and

[59:47] this army of God you know
[59:49] we will never run out of ammunition

[59:52] behind there and then you have this
[59:54] quiet ones brother and me me you know
[59:57] you you you don't know what they hide
[1:00:00] you don't know that that power and that
[1:00:02] that that passion and zeal they have
[1:00:05] within them if that if it comes crunch
[1:00:07] time they will leave from the front and

[1:19:38] drive this a month along if I can Palin
[1:19:49] I just can't well here we go
[1:19:52] I'm driving okay don't be scared
[1:19:56] I've been first Corinthians 13 12 and 13
[1:20:00] and then we're going to go to
[1:20:01] revelations 8 and 1 this may be a bit
[1:20:04] different but here we are for now we see
[1:20:07] through a glass darkly but then face to
[1:20:09] face then I now I know in part but then
[1:20:13] shall I know even as also I am known
[1:20:17] and now abideth hope faith charity these
[1:20:21] three but the greatest of these is
[1:20:22] charity they mean so so it's got
[1:20:25] revelations 8 and 1 I'm just gonna you
[1:20:30] know we were Christi and I were talking
[1:20:32] through the weekend before and you know
[1:20:33] I'm gonna share some pearls
[1:20:35] you know because you got to share what's
[1:20:36] real to you what's your revelation so
[1:20:39] and I know you won't turn and rend me so
[1:20:41] you know I'm just going to share some
[1:20:42] pearls
[1:20:43] I mean so basically so we're gonna read
[1:20:46] the scripture here and when he had
[1:20:48] opened the Seventh Seal There was
[1:20:49] silence in heaven about the space of
[1:20:51] half an hour it may seem like a strange
[1:20:53] collection of Scripture but a malicious
[1:20:56] power here to get in a word of Prayer
[1:20:57] gracious father we so glad we can look
[1:21:00] into your word and Lord you've made a
[1:21:02] life thank you lord I pray your spirit
[1:21:06] would fall on each soul Lord walking
[1:21:09] with you is not having a collection of
[1:21:10] ideas or facts Lord it's you revealing
[1:21:12] yourself to us making yourself known so
[1:21:15] lord I pray your spirit of Revelation
[1:21:17] would fall upon each chart from oldest
[1:21:19] to youngest Lord and may you accomplish
[1:21:21] that which you have purpose for the
[1:21:23] service Lord in Jesus Christ's name Lord
[1:21:25] I ask these things amen I mean god bless
[1:21:28] you friends you may have your seats this
[1:21:29] morning I'm sorry whoa no I want to talk
[1:21:33] about the Seventh Seal today but we
[1:21:37] really hear that you know they'll come a
[1:21:38] time when we are there when we know as
[1:21:41] we are knowing now that is this day that
[1:21:45] we're alive and now the Bible as we read
[1:21:48] here in revelations ain't eleven you
[1:21:50] know there was a silence witness when
[1:21:53] the Seventh Seal open feels a silence
[1:21:55] there was a time of silence now the
[1:21:57] Bible is a love letter between Christ
[1:22:00] and his bride it's not a text book it's
[1:22:02] not a newspaper it's a love leader now
[1:22:06] in order for it to be a love letter to
[1:22:08] you and I we have to be in a
[1:22:10] relationship with him and as he is the
[1:22:12] one who initiates the relationship right
[1:22:15] it's not him that will earth or Romans
[1:22:16] but God that show us mercy I mean no man
[1:22:19] seeketh God at any time but he seeks us
[1:22:21] right in the beginning when Adam and Eve
[1:22:23] fell God went hunting them right they
[1:22:25] didn't go hunting him
[1:22:27] they went hunting they may mean so it's
[1:22:28] the same thing all the way down through
[1:22:30] the ages now so an order in order to
[1:22:33] have a relationship with God God has to
[1:22:36] reveal himself to us personally right so
[1:22:39] it's not just a collection of ideas or
[1:22:41] historical facts I mean that makes us
[1:22:43] believers it's because he reveals
[1:22:45] himself to you amen just like the
[1:22:47] scribes and Pharisees they said we are
[1:22:49] Moses disciples they had Moses but you
[1:22:52] know but if they really had Moses if
[1:22:54] they really had the river
[1:22:56] nation that Moses received it was a
[1:22:58] revelation to them then they would have
[1:23:00] received Jesus because gee Moses wrote
[1:23:02] of Jesus right I mean so but to them it
[1:23:05] was just a collection of facts that was
[1:23:07] a fact that Moses was a prophet it was
[1:23:09] an established fact that what he wrote a
[1:23:11] min the first five books of the Bible
[1:23:13] were the Word of God it wasn't
[1:23:14] established fact by their culture and
[1:23:16] they received it that way it wasn't a
[1:23:19] revelation to them rights a win so when
[1:23:22] the one that Moses wrote off became
[1:23:24] flesh they rejected him because they it
[1:23:26] was not revealed to them Allu you I mean
[1:23:30] so so now the Bible says in Matthew 11
[1:23:33] in 25 jesus said at that time jesus
[1:23:37] answered and said I thank thee O Father
[1:23:38] Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou
[1:23:41] has hid these things from the wise and
[1:23:43] prudent and has revealed them unto babes
[1:23:45] so he himself was saying that these
[1:23:47] things have been hidden to some but
[1:23:49] revealed to others and God is sovereign
[1:23:51] and is choosing I mean that's why I
[1:23:52] think we should be rejoicing that he
[1:23:55] would reveal himself to us he would make
[1:23:56] himself known to us see the thing is
[1:23:59] it's not that our worthiness it doesn't
[1:24:01] matter how what we consider ourselves if
[1:24:03] he has revealed himself to you just
[1:24:05] rejoice and just shout and say thank you
[1:24:07] lord
[1:24:07] I mean because that's all that matters
[1:24:09] he made himself known I mean we weren't
[1:24:11] hunting him he found us hallelujah
[1:24:13] that's all that matters in life God
[1:24:15] found me Connelly it doesn't matter
[1:24:17] where I came from I mean he knew where I
[1:24:20] was going I mean it wasn't the gutter of
[1:24:22] this world they mean but it wasn't the
[1:24:24] glory that's all we need to rejoice them
[1:24:26] he found me he became real to me he's
[1:24:29] alive to me hallelujah that means so
[1:24:33] since the Bible is a love letter I mean
[1:24:35] do you believe it I trusted it and not a
[1:24:37] textbook then it's only for those that
[1:24:40] God isn't a true love relationship worth
[1:24:43] that will actually understand what he's
[1:24:45] saying amen because it will only be his
[1:24:49] bride that will really know what he's
[1:24:51] saying it won't be the casual reader it
[1:24:54] won't be those who just flirting with
[1:24:56] them it's those that he has chosen to
[1:24:58] join himself to he is not ashamed to
[1:25:01] call you bride he is not ashamed to call
[1:25:04] you the Lambs wife amen he's not ashamed
[1:25:08] he's proud look at my
[1:25:10] hallelujah she's wonderful she spotless
[1:25:13] she's virtuous she's sinless she's made
[1:25:15] in my image hallelujah he is he is proud
[1:25:18] of you little old me
[1:25:20] absolutely hallelujah hey I can brag on
[1:25:24] Jesus I'll brag on Jesus a little bit I
[1:25:26] mean just like brother brand someone
[1:25:28] complained he said you know yo let's eat
[1:25:30] dum you brag on Jesus too much lujah I
[1:25:34] want to be in the same category at
[1:25:37] Mila's brag on him so now so the bride
[1:25:40] those who had joined to him they really
[1:25:43] know what he's saying I mean so it's
[1:25:45] like if you if you found you know you
[1:25:49] know some letters that your grandparents
[1:25:51] wrote before they got married or maybe
[1:25:53] some emails that your parents wrote you
[1:25:55] know we've gone to the modern era you
[1:25:57] know you could read those letters and
[1:26:01] you could kind of you know you could say
[1:26:04] well this is what they're saying and
[1:26:05] this is what they're meeting but you
[1:26:07] would not just say just say grandpa's
[1:26:09] writing to Grandma right you could
[1:26:11] understand what he's saying to her but
[1:26:13] only she would receive the full intent
[1:26:15] of what the leader meant I mean she
[1:26:18] because she's in a relationship with him
[1:26:20] she receives the full magnitude of what
[1:26:23] he's writing and maybe even his
[1:26:24] handwriting with changes he's changing
[1:26:26] what he's saying and in his phrases and
[1:26:28] different things she would know exactly
[1:26:30] what he's saying
[1:26:31] others may read it but you wouldn't get
[1:26:33] the full depth of what's being said
[1:26:36] like she would why because she's in a
[1:26:38] love relationship with grandpa
[1:26:40] hallelujah and it's the same thing with
[1:26:43] this place of Bible same thing with the
[1:26:45] message a mean those are in a
[1:26:46] relationship with our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:48] they know what he's saying
[1:26:49] they know what he's meaning amen I mean
[1:26:54] so so why you say so you may say well
[1:26:56] what's this got to do with the silence
[1:26:57] when the Seventh Seal opens well it's
[1:27:00] because the bride knows what he means I
[1:27:04] mean some people read silence and they
[1:27:07] debate about it fuss about it argue
[1:27:08] about it but the bride knows something's
[1:27:11] happening she knows why it's written
[1:27:14] this way because she's in a love
[1:27:16] relationship amen so what is God saying
[1:27:19] he's saying because Christ is the seals
[1:27:21] the seals reveal cry
[1:27:23] right but and and and the seven seals
[1:27:27] they encompass the whole world it
[1:27:29] encompasses the great and her
[1:27:31] destruction her judgment the devil's
[1:27:33] judgment and destruction it encompasses
[1:27:35] the church right it encompasses the
[1:27:38] bright and encompasses the world right
[1:27:40] because the first four we know as the as
[1:27:42] the Antichrist spirit riding forth and
[1:27:44] God sending an anointing to combat what
[1:27:47] the enemy is doing amen and we know run
[1:27:49] to the Eagle anointing in the South
[1:27:50] that's why God raised above the
[1:27:52] situation of life and we can see from
[1:27:54] eternity to eternity hallelujah amen so
[1:27:57] you know but then there's the first seal
[1:27:59] I mean which is the Jews 144,000 right
[1:28:02] the mystery of them I mean in the six
[1:28:04] seals of Great Tribulation
[1:28:05] now are we are we know and then in the
[1:28:09] seventh is Christ himself coming
[1:28:11] hallelujah right so you got to see now
[1:28:14] where do we fit because I I don't see
[1:28:16] myself in the Great Tribulation some
[1:28:18] people are in you you see there's a
[1:28:20] great move of being Preppers in this
[1:28:23] hour why because they're being anointed
[1:28:25] to prepare for the Great Tribulation
[1:28:27] that's their that's their portion I mean
[1:28:29] you were to find your portion in the
[1:28:30] scripture I mean just like Jesus he went
[1:28:33] to the synagogue he found where it says
[1:28:34] in Isaiah the spread of laws upon me and
[1:28:37] he read that scripture said this day the
[1:28:39] Scriptures fulfilled I mean so he knew
[1:28:41] exactly his portion of Scripture that he
[1:28:43] was to fulfill I mean but an angel has
[1:28:45] to come to you I mean and show you what
[1:28:48] portion of Scripture you are call to
[1:28:49] fulfill in this day that's why it's very
[1:28:51] important say Lord reveal to me my
[1:28:55] allotment in the scripture I mean unless
[1:28:57] if this message has come alive to you
[1:28:59] this message is a bridegroom call so
[1:29:01] therefore you're a lot but in the
[1:29:03] scriptures let us be glad and rejoice I
[1:29:05] mean for the marriage of the lamb has

[1:29:08] ready hallelujah I mean because this
[1:29:12] message is a bridegroom call it's a love
[1:29:15] relationship going forth
[1:29:17] hallelujah it's not for everyone we know
[1:29:19] that amen but it's for the Bride of
[1:29:22] Christ that means we don't we don't
[1:29:24] exclude anyone
[1:29:25] first of all whosoever will let them
[1:29:28] come woo

[1:29:34] of the wedding feast you know I'm not
[1:29:36] sure who
[1:29:37] who shared in the testimony but you know
[1:29:39] the invitation went out and it was those
[1:29:42] that just said y'all come you know the
[1:29:46] King said get the good and the bed go to
[1:29:49] the highways and byways the hedgerows we
[1:29:51] ever get the good in the bed if they'll
[1:29:54] say yes they're coming and they come
[1:29:56] into the door they can be very rich very
[1:29:58] poor homeless whatever I mean they're
[1:30:01] anointed they're given a new robe their
[1:30:03] feet are washed
[1:30:04] I meant so the world is washed off them
[1:30:06] they're given the robe of his
[1:30:07] righteousness they're anointed to to
[1:30:09] that any that any smell the world comes
[1:30:12] off them because they're anointed amen
[1:30:14] and they've gone to the wedding feast
[1:30:15] and they look all the same I mean after
[1:30:19] what they have to come through the door

[1:33:17] witnesses go to them they witness the
[1:33:19] very same one we know they bring to
[1:33:21] Israel right so that's under the first
[1:33:23] seal the sixth seal great tribute six
[1:33:26] seals Great Tribulation I mean the

[1:33:42] present more than just singing the song

[1:34:43] and you recognize his present it changes
[1:34:45] the whole picture it changes everything
[1:34:47] when you recognize that his presence the
[1:34:50] member the only thing he is not as this
[1:34:53] physical body we will meet in the air
[1:34:55] but everything he is he's present right
[1:34:58] when he is when he says and we'll come
[1:35:01] to it we says behold I stand at the door
[1:35:03] and knock he is a person it's not part
[1:35:06] of a person he says I am present upon
[1:35:08] the earth knocking trying to get into
[1:35:11] the church he's present but anything
[1:35:13] hear my voice and we've heard the shot
[1:35:15] go forth I mean we've heard that
[1:35:17] midnight cry the bridegroom cometh go
[1:35:18] out to meet him hallelujah and something
[1:35:21] at me said I'll go that's really that
[1:35:25] simple will you go just like with a
[1:35:27] Rebecca I'll go here I'm going home
[1:35:30] glory because we know that the rapture
[1:35:32] is really the secret going I mean it's
[1:35:37] actually a secret catching away by the
[1:35:39] man sees us like Romeo and Juliet Romeo
[1:35:41] you know comes at night puts his ladder
[1:35:44] up whatever against the side of the
[1:35:45] house and takes Juliet away that's like
[1:35:48] that he comes like a thief in the night
[1:35:50] and he's a very good thief he doesn't
[1:35:53] stuff around he won't be on us you know
[1:35:56] you know the me
[1:35:57] he's a very good he knows what he wants
[1:36:00] I mean it's not just a smash-and-grab
[1:36:03] job he knows what he wants he wants you
[1:36:06] he's come to catch you away
[1:36:10] hallelujah but anyone who's not United
[1:36:14] with him it doesn't mean much the
[1:36:16] silence amen
[1:36:19] it's either something they'll ignore or
[1:36:21] debate or argue over but to the bride it
[1:36:23] means something she knows that he's
[1:36:25] coming like a thief in the night
[1:36:28] I'll loo you see if I could drive this
[1:36:31] again now let's go to Matthew 24 one two
[1:36:34] three we're going I'm gonna get to
[1:36:44] Rebecca Eleazar soon you know I love the
[1:36:50] Bible man
[1:36:52] I'm so amazed this convention the
[1:36:58] Scriptures so alive
[1:36:59] this word is a living word it hasn't
[1:37:03] gone stale it hasn't become common it's
[1:37:05] a living word and we are living in a
[1:37:08] different hour we're living 10 years ago
[1:37:11] Easter 10 years ago was my first ever
[1:37:13] convention and it was glorious don't get
[1:37:14] me wrong I had a Jubilee I was at the
[1:37:17] front rejoicing I didn't care about the
[1:37:19] monkeys in the back that's why it's
[1:37:21] always good sit in the front of you can
[1:37:22] don't worry about all the monkey just
[1:37:24] yeah everyone distracting you I know
[1:37:26] it's a crude way of saying it but hey I
[1:37:28] just dominate the front rows hallelujah
[1:37:30] if I could be myself because you know
[1:37:33] you're not distracted
[1:37:34] that's Here I am hallelujah doesn't
[1:37:37] matter what the others do behind me they
[1:37:38] can do what they want I'm here
[1:37:40] hallelujah anyway there that's me you
[1:37:43] know I probably would have been a soccer
[1:37:46] hooligan or something if I lived ever
[1:37:48] see anyway if I really loved sport but
[1:37:51] you know we worship the Lord now so
[1:37:53] Matthew 24 one two three and Jesus went
[1:37:56] out and departed from the temple and his
[1:37:58] disciples came to him for to show him
[1:38:00] the buildings of the temple and Jesus
[1:38:02] said unto MC not all these things verily
[1:38:04] I say unto you there shall not be left
[1:38:06] here one stone upon another that shall
[1:38:09] not be thrown down and as he set upon
[1:38:11] the Mount of Olives the disciples came
[1:38:13] unto him privately saying tell us when
[1:38:15] shall these things be what shall be the
[1:38:18] sign of thy coming and of the end of the
[1:38:20] world so notice he's asked three
[1:38:22] questions
[1:38:23] shall these things be for the table
[1:38:25] being destroyed right and the sign of
[1:38:27] thy coming and the end of the world now
[1:38:30] Jesus answers these three questions
[1:38:32] Matthew 24 he goes on now I'm not going
[1:38:36] to I'm you know I haven't put it in here
[1:38:38] but go listen to the seal series and
[1:38:41] brother BAM shows that that Jesus speaks
[1:38:44] about the first six that he leaves off
[1:38:47] the seventh which is the coming and
[1:38:49] you'll notice when when when Jesus
[1:38:51] sososo he goes through these and then he
[1:38:54] breaks off into parables speaking of the
[1:38:57] condition of people when the Lord
[1:38:58] returns why because he's now actually
[1:39:00] opening up the seventh seal amen he's
[1:39:04] actually opening up the seventh seal so
[1:39:06] you know so he goes through the your
[1:39:09] first six but then it it appears that he
[1:39:12] omits the seventh but then he goes into
[1:39:14] parables right so he starts off saying
[1:39:17] you know and he's showing the condition
[1:39:19] that people are running their attitudes
[1:39:20] at the time of the coming of the Lord
[1:39:22] which is the seventh seal right we know
[1:39:24] the similar seals the end of time end of
[1:39:26] all things but it starts off with Christ
[1:39:28] as sealing revelations 10 they meant to
[1:39:31] unite himself with a bride hallelujah
[1:39:34] you know amen so now so so we're not
[1:39:40] going to go and but go read Matthew 24
[1:39:43] 25 so he starts with the days of Noah
[1:39:46] this is what it's going to be like when
[1:39:47] the Lord returns people married wives
[1:39:49] given a marriage all those different
[1:39:51] things until the rain came and destroyed
[1:39:52] them all right so they're people's
[1:39:54] attitudes for those caught up with life
[1:39:56] too busy there was a crank fanatic old
[1:39:58] man building a boat you know maybe that
[1:40:01] was a better sight better news but you
[1:40:03] know all these people were busy people
[1:40:05] caught up with life but there were a
[1:40:07] group preparing to leave amen
[1:40:10] and you know and then he speaks about
[1:40:12] you there'll be two in the field one
[1:40:14] will be taken one will be left to in the
[1:40:16] bid one will be taken one will be left
[1:40:18] he's talking about how the rapture will
[1:40:19] be universal I mean there'll be people
[1:40:22] asleep they'll be taken they'll be awake
[1:40:24] they'll be taken hallelujah if you're in
[1:40:26] Christ you're going if you're really in
[1:40:29] the Lord if you're sealed in I mean you
[1:40:31] are going doesn't matter you can be
[1:40:33] driving down the road you can be walking
[1:40:34] down the road you can be at work you can
[1:40:36] be asleep
[1:40:36] you can be brushing your teeth you know
[1:40:38] when the Lord calls we have to go
[1:40:41] hallelujah amen and then he speaks about
[1:40:45] the parable of the good servant that is
[1:40:48] found doing when the Lord returns but
[1:40:50] then also the evil servant I mean that
[1:40:52] loses sight of what he's commissioned to
[1:40:54] do I mean cuz blessed are they that
[1:40:57] occupied till I come until they have
[1:40:59] found it doing when he returns but then
[1:41:01] it but then he speaks about the evil
[1:41:03] servant
[1:41:04] I mean who loses sight of what he's
[1:41:06] commissioned to do he gets drunk with
[1:41:08] the rest of the world and begins to
[1:41:09] smite has fellow servants now this world
[1:41:12] is drunk right sees in Revelations 18
[1:41:14] that the great has made the whole
[1:41:16] world drunk amen and everyone's drunk on
[1:41:18] something I mean the only sober minded
[1:41:21] serious minded people is the Bride of
[1:41:23] Christ amen I mean so the so people get
[1:41:27] drunk why because what happens these are
[1:41:28] there appears to be a delay amen but God
[1:41:32] is not slack concerning his promise as
[1:41:34] others will call slackness but is
[1:41:36] long-suffering waiting for everyone to
[1:41:39] get in waiting for all the Elector
[1:41:42] coming even waiting for the fullest
[1:41:44] version to come in I'll put it that way
[1:41:45] to everyone that would be ready amen God
[1:41:49] is not slack but some people were going
[1:41:51] to think there's a delay he delays us
[1:41:53] coming
[1:41:54] therefore they so the zeal that they
[1:41:56] came in with diminishes they keep they
[1:41:58] they they take their eyes off the goal
[1:42:00] hallelujah our goal is that we are built
[1:42:03] into the stature of the perfect man I
[1:42:05] mean that everyone who will will come
[1:42:07] and drink at the fountain I mean that
[1:42:09] God would pour his word out into flesh
[1:42:11] again I mean he would become flesh
[1:42:13] that's our goal and we'll take a rapture
[1:42:15] howl ooh yeah isn't it our goal isn't
[1:42:18] that what we're living for mums and dads
[1:42:20] and that way you want to live a life
[1:42:21] before your children I mean that they
[1:42:23] would see Christ in flesh I mean that
[1:42:25] you would be salty to them you create an
[1:42:27] atmosphere in your home I mean that they
[1:42:29] they realize that the reason we're
[1:42:31] Christians is because we love Him I mean
[1:42:33] because of what he's done for us it's
[1:42:35] not out of fear and we'll come into that
[1:42:36] soon it's not out of fear it's out of
[1:42:38] love and respect and and then
[1:42:40] Thanksgiving hallelujah amen sorry so
[1:42:44] don't don't take your eyes off the goal
[1:42:46] don't get drunk with this world don't
[1:42:49] get caught
[1:42:50] what is drinking it's something we do
[1:42:51] something in excess I mean your passions
[1:42:54] you get caught up in some hobby some
[1:42:56] selfless I mean
[1:42:57] selfish thing amen don't get caught up
[1:43:00] oh I need me time no just have a lot
[1:43:03] time
[1:43:03] hey man I need to relax just go relax in
[1:43:08] his presence we have a place to relax
[1:43:09] letting off the pressure amen get in his
[1:43:11] presence and let off the pressure
[1:43:14] amen so don't get drunk on the pleasures
[1:43:19] of this world or some some hobby or I do
[1:43:22] this to be with the Lord
[1:43:23] well how is it impacting your family
[1:43:25] don't use him Jesus is not an excuse I
[1:43:29] mean don't use him as an excuse try and
[1:43:32] put some religious wrapping over your
[1:43:34] own selfish motives amen and then he
[1:43:37] speaks about the parable of the wise and
[1:43:39] foolish virgin he's talking about thee
[1:43:41] sorry that's there I don't have a blank
[1:43:42] on me but you know he's so he's speaking
[1:43:45] about the condition that people will be
[1:43:47] at the time of us coming right then he
[1:43:49] speaks about the wise and foolish virgin
[1:43:51] now the word wise and his thoughtful so
[1:43:55] those are the Strong's it is thoughtful
[1:43:58] that is and I can't pronounce this
[1:44:00] it's saga chaos which is sa Ga see IOUs
[1:44:04] and that means having or showing keen
[1:44:07] mental discernment and good judgment
[1:44:10] this is the wise right or they are
[1:44:14] discreet which is implying a cautious
[1:44:17] character you know many times you know
[1:44:20] in the world we're carefree but then we
[1:44:23] meet the Lord we're a lot more
[1:44:24] high-strung right and some people the
[1:44:28] devil uses that against us but it's
[1:44:30] because when you really meet him you
[1:44:32] know his mercy and grace you're so
[1:44:34] thankful that he found you I mean you
[1:44:36] should I appreciate what he's done for
[1:44:38] you I mean that you don't want to do
[1:44:40] something that will hurt him you don't
[1:44:42] want to do something that will displease
[1:44:44] him right you you want to live a life
[1:44:46] now you know what will the bride knows
[1:44:48] she's not trying to earn salvation amen
[1:44:51] we're not trying to earn brownie points
[1:44:53] or anything but because of what he's
[1:44:55] done glory every because of what he's
[1:44:59] done they men he took your son up
[1:45:01] Calvary he went to
[1:45:02] was the center in your place I mean that
[1:45:04] you don't need to go I mean he took your
[1:45:06] shame in your sin and everything you're
[1:45:08] done
[1:45:08] he says I'll gladly take that upon
[1:45:10] myself I mean I will identify your sin
[1:45:13] upon me I mean I'll take it up Calvary
[1:45:15] that day hasn't he done the incredible
[1:45:17] things for us oh yeah he was he was not
[1:45:20] ashamed amen he was not you know he said
[1:45:24] for this cause I've come into the world
[1:45:26] hallelujah
[1:45:28] so so when so when people will come
[1:45:30] believe it because they don't want to
[1:45:31] hurt him in any way we become more
[1:45:33] high-strung right and the devil uses
[1:45:36] that against you or why can't you relax
[1:45:37] why can't you be carefully like you were
[1:45:39] in the world and he tries to use it
[1:45:42] against you it's because we want to live
[1:45:44] a life worthy of the gospel because of
[1:45:46] what the Lord has done for us I mean so
[1:45:48] we don't want never let the devil use
[1:45:50] your own sincerity and your own good
[1:45:54] intention you know what you know your
[1:45:56] own sincerity and and in love for God
[1:45:58] against you why no why are we that way
[1:46:02] because we're wise hallelujah God made
[1:46:05] us that way
[1:46:06] that's God's character amen glory I mean
[1:46:11] so it means a discrete implying a
[1:46:12] cautious character amen
[1:46:15] and so so they don't want it so that's
[1:46:18] what it means
[1:46:19] and it also is from the root word which
[1:46:22] is having a sensitive nature why because
[1:46:26] we're sensitive to him you know if I
[1:46:30] asked you now this is a very silly
[1:46:32] question but who wants to grieve the
[1:46:33] Holy Ghost that he flies away from you
[1:46:36] not a soul you want him close you know
[1:46:39] what it's like when he when he there and
[1:46:41] is it's such a sweetness and
[1:46:43] everything's wonderful
[1:46:44] you may be in the worst worst possible
[1:46:47] trial but this is such a sweetness in
[1:46:49] you you know it's just so wonderful when
[1:46:51] the heavenly dove comes and he rests on
[1:46:52] your shoulder and you never want that
[1:46:54] you know you just want to stay in that
[1:46:55] moment your Lord if you could just
[1:46:57] freeze me right here in this moment that
[1:46:59] I never leave your presence like this
[1:47:01] why is that because the heavenly doves
[1:47:02] there hallelujah I trust you know I you
[1:47:07] can see on your faces you know what I'm
[1:47:08] talking about I mean so so that's why
[1:47:10] we're a bit sensitive nature because
[1:47:12] were like lord I just want to live a
[1:47:13] life where you're close
[1:47:15] hallelujah he said I'll never leave thee
[1:47:17] nor forsake thee but if we we can't
[1:47:19] grieve the Holy Ghost he flies up in the
[1:47:21] rafters waiting for us to get our hearts
[1:47:22] right again then you'll come back
[1:47:23] doesn't mean we have to get saved all
[1:47:25] over again you understand but we can't
[1:47:27] grieve him but we don't want to grieve
[1:47:29] him so the wise virgins have a nature
[1:47:31] that is in contrast to the foolish and
[1:47:34] that word foolish means heedless they
[1:47:37] just you know they just press right on
[1:47:38] they don't heed the warnings they're not
[1:47:40] worried
[1:47:41] amen and another reason why we may be
[1:47:43] you know why we are you could say you
[1:47:48] know seem to be more high-strung being a
[1:47:50] believer it's because we know it
[1:47:52] straight as the gate and narrow is the
[1:47:53] way we want to walk that way but the
[1:47:56] foolish they just they just go anyway
[1:47:57] broad but broad is the way that leads to
[1:47:59] destruction
[1:48:00] Amen but the wise we say Lord want to
[1:48:02] walk and step with your word amen but
[1:48:06] the thing is now the reason the wise are
[1:48:08] that way in my opinions because they
[1:48:10] have oil I mean they have Holy Ghost all
[1:48:12] that's why they have God's divine nature
[1:48:14] that's why they that's why they are wise
[1:48:16] that's why they are discreet amen that's
[1:48:18] why they do have a cautious nature glory
[1:48:22] and then he goes into the parable of the
[1:48:25] talents remember and you know we know
[1:48:29] the parable of the wise and foolish is
[1:48:30] the bridegroom call some go into the
[1:48:32] marriage some do not
[1:48:34] amen and we're married here amen and
[1:48:38] then there's the parable of the talents
[1:48:39] servants are given a different number
[1:48:41] talents some five turn and in someone
[1:48:43] and and the master says go you know he's
[1:48:46] traveling to a far country says you
[1:48:48] cease use what I've given you I'm in and
[1:48:51] and make increase on them and then he
[1:48:53] comes back and the five now has ten the
[1:48:56] two I think has four year-old you know
[1:48:58] there's an increase but the one he
[1:49:00] buries his talent because he knows that
[1:49:03] the young that is master is a very
[1:49:05] shooed very good businessman you know
[1:49:07] that that saws where he doesn't I mean
[1:49:09] rape three doesn't so in different
[1:49:11] things but it's out of fear he buries
[1:49:13] what God gave him out of fear he buried
[1:49:16] what what the master gave him it's out
[1:49:19] of fear what's happened his relationship
[1:49:21] is wrong amen
[1:49:23] I I think that Lord would rather be that
[1:49:26] servant came said good master you know I
[1:49:28] had one
[1:49:29] Helland right then I got three and then
[1:49:31] I tried to do this I lost it all I think
[1:49:33] that master would be more pleased
[1:49:35] I mean worth with that servant if he
[1:49:38] lost at all I mean that he didn't do
[1:49:40] anything
[1:49:41] amen that's why we God doesn't see us up
[1:49:45] to fail the bride is not set up to fail
[1:49:49] I mean so when God gives you a talent
[1:49:52] gives you a gift we'll have a gift of
[1:49:54] faith he doesn't give it to you he
[1:49:56] doesn't reveal his work to you that you
[1:49:58] will fail I mean he doesn't do that he
[1:50:01] gives you a gift he gives you a talent
[1:50:03] he reveals himself to you because he set
[1:50:05] you up to win he set you up to be
[1:50:07] successful he said you have to take a
[1:50:09] rapture I mean he sent you up to
[1:50:10] overcome hell death and the grave I mean
[1:50:13] he sent you up to be victorious to be an
[1:50:16] overcomer he's made you thus amen
[1:50:20] so we shouldn't be afraid you know the
[1:50:23] Lord reveals himself to us we shouldn't
[1:50:25] be afraid of what's going to happen now
[1:50:26] no the what's going to happen as these
[1:50:28] atoms are going to be changed that's
[1:50:31] what's going to happen what's gonna
[1:50:32] happen dancing on streets of gold
[1:50:34] hallelujah
[1:50:35] what's gonna happen what's the devil be
[1:50:37] kicked into the lake of fire see how
[1:50:39] long he screams before he hits the
[1:50:41] flames I don't know it says hallelujah
[1:50:43] revelations 19 rejoice amen say you know
[1:50:48] we shouldn't we shouldn't be afraid oh
[1:50:50] but what about what about no if he saved
[1:50:54] you brother Brahim season the I think
[1:50:56] it's the Lamb's Book of Life sermon I
[1:50:59] may I may get the title wrong it says
[1:51:00] God doesn't save you one day to lose you
[1:51:03] the next day god does not run his
[1:51:05] business that way I mean even if it may
[1:51:07] appear that we willfully do wrong God
[1:51:10] doesn't you know God allows us to do
[1:51:13] those things sometimes amen hallelujah
[1:51:16] God doesn't run his business said he'll
[1:51:19] save you one day lose you the next day
[1:51:21] he does not operate that way I mean he
[1:51:24] knows how many are in the Lamb's Book of
[1:51:25] Life
[1:51:26] and he sent this message to awaken you
[1:51:28] Amen that you would realize you have
[1:51:30] representation in heaven hallelujah
[1:51:33] say Amen what do we have to be afraid of
[1:51:36] Amen if God is for us as God for you
[1:51:41] who can be against you someone tell me
[1:51:45] nothing hallelujah
[1:51:48] so I think we should just be happy let's
[1:51:50] just rejoice and then he goes into the
[1:51:54] parable of thee of the dividing of the
[1:51:56] sheep and goats a great white throne
[1:51:57] judgment and that is the result they
[1:52:00] separate that way as a result of how God
[1:52:02] how they received the Word made flesh in
[1:52:06] their day I hungered you feed me I was
[1:52:08] thirsty you know you gave me some to
[1:52:10] drink I was in prison you visited me I
[1:52:12] was naked you clothed me and I said when
[1:52:13] did we do these things
[1:52:14] si much heed unto my little ones you
[1:52:16] done to me they mean why cuz these will
[1:52:19] these things all happen under the
[1:52:20] seventh seal now lo yeah I'll try and I
[1:52:25] may have to just cut this short and then
[1:52:27] we'll pick it up some other time
[1:52:29] but he sees this here and and second
[1:52:32] second Thessalonians 2 now we beseech
[1:52:36] you brethren by the coming of our Lord
[1:52:38] Jesus and by our gathering together unto
[1:52:40] Him have we gathered to help Amen that
[1:52:43] ye be not soon shaken in mind nor
[1:52:46] troubled neither by spirit nor by word
[1:52:48] nor by letter as from us as that day of
[1:52:51] Christ is at hand
[1:52:52] what's he saying that there'll be things
[1:52:54] that will come and shake us trouble us
[1:52:56] in mind yeah or in spirit is it by
[1:52:59] spirit or by leader whatever it may be
[1:53:01] things will come but they no man deceive
[1:53:03] you by any means for that day shall not
[1:53:06] come except there come a falling away
[1:53:08] first I should turn off the locking
[1:53:11] thing on my phone I mean and that that
[1:53:14] man of sin be revealed the son of
[1:53:16] perdition
[1:53:16] now that's already happened right who
[1:53:20] opposeth and exalteth himself or above
[1:53:23] all that is called God or that is
[1:53:25] worshipped so that he as God sitteth in
[1:53:27] the temple of God showing himself that
[1:53:29] He is God remember ye not that when I
[1:53:32] was yet with you I told you these things
[1:53:33] and now you know what was hold of that
[1:53:37] he might be revealed in his time for the
[1:53:40] mystery of iniquity doth already work
[1:53:41] only he who now letteth will let until
[1:53:44] he be taken out of the way now he's
[1:53:48] saying that this mystery of iniquity is
[1:53:49] working right it's already there but
[1:53:52] only he but it's limited
[1:53:55] in the devil has boundaries the devil
[1:53:58] has boundaries amen
[1:53:59] only he who now letteth will let who's
[1:54:02] the one who who who allows all things
[1:54:04] God himself
[1:54:05] I mean Satan has to ask permission from
[1:54:08] your husband before he plays a single
[1:54:11] finger upon you he has to get permission
[1:54:13] amen so everything that happens in life
[1:54:16] God has allowed it and God allows it
[1:54:18] that he can reveal himself he could
[1:54:20] manifest his attributes in your life why
[1:54:22] do you think God allowed the fall
[1:54:24] because he was a savior he is a redeemer
[1:54:26] he was a guide he was peace he's a
[1:54:27] shepherd I mean he's a comforter he's a
[1:54:30] husband he's he's all these things he's
[1:54:31] a sacrifice he's a priest but he
[1:54:33] couldn't reveal those things to Adam and
[1:54:35] Eve when they're not you know you know
[1:54:36] when the sinless so the devil the devil
[1:54:39] actually did God a favor because there's
[1:54:42] a part of God you think God and his
[1:54:44] great eternal being
[1:54:45] how many crates creation the pinnacle of
[1:54:47] that creation was man and as he's
[1:54:50] creating he sees it's good this is good
[1:54:52] this is good but then finally when Adam
[1:54:54] standing there upon the earth by himself
[1:54:56] he says it's not good I mean because
[1:54:57] Adam was the manifestation of the heart
[1:55:00] of God it's not good I'm alone I mean
[1:55:02] it's not good I'm just alone in this
[1:55:04] eternity with my thoughts I mean I want
[1:55:06] I want to have a bride I would have
[1:55:07] someone I can love on if someone I can
[1:55:09] adore
[1:55:10] I mean someone I can you know reveal
[1:55:12] myself to spend time with make myself
[1:55:14] known to so he says it's not good
[1:55:16] hallelujah because that's what he wants
[1:55:19] I mean so he takes he takes Adam and now
[1:55:22] this is the Seventh Seal you see the
[1:55:24] Seventh Seal there in Genesis I mean
[1:55:26] where God puts man upon the earth then
[1:55:29] he takes a part of that man hallelujah
[1:55:32] I mean separates the feminist part of
[1:55:34] them out amen and then and then finally
[1:55:37] now Eve comes true Adam comes true and
[1:55:39] then Adam because he's named all the
[1:55:41] animals but now he sees a part of
[1:55:44] himself in flesh and he says that your
[1:55:46] bone of my bone your flesh of my flesh
[1:55:48] you'll be called woman because you came
[1:55:50] out of man hallelujah and because you
[1:55:53] came out of me didn't come out here
[1:55:55] separately like the male and female
[1:55:56] animals we came out of me holy that's
[1:56:00] why you call a woman because you came
[1:56:01] out of me
[1:56:02] hallelujah as the same thing when God
[1:56:04] and that's the seven seal and that's why
[1:56:07] Christ is descended in the
[1:56:08] amen because remember Eve didn't go to
[1:56:11] Adam and say i'm bone of your bone flesh
[1:56:12] of your flesh I'll be called woman cuz I
[1:56:14] came out of you it was the other way
[1:56:16] around
[1:56:16] hallelujah and that's why this word is
[1:56:19] called your name this message just
[1:56:20] called your name I mean that's why God
[1:56:22] himself has come down to this hour he
[1:56:24] says your bone of my bone your flesh of
[1:56:26] my flesh your life of my life your power
[1:56:28] of my power
[1:56:29] amen you are me she is him the prophets
[1:56:32] here hallelujah that's what he's
[1:56:34] declaring that's the seventh seal and
[1:56:36] that's why this message means a whole
[1:56:39] lot to you why because the second head
[1:56:40] of us come down in Word form I mean to
[1:56:43] find a word bride hallelujah amen glory
[1:56:48] to God hallelujah that's why you've got
[1:56:52] to listen to what he sees about you not
[1:56:54] what the devil says about you or what
[1:56:56] your own humanity may say about you
[1:56:58] that's irrelevant I mean the only thing
[1:57:01] the only voice that matters is the voice
[1:57:03] of the seventh angel I mean that has
[1:57:04] identified a bride in this hour I mean
[1:57:07] it's not just him at God comes in behind
[1:57:09] hallelujah 50 odd years later and says
[1:57:11] she is she is my bride hallelujah that's
[1:57:15] why it's perverse it's not haphazard we
[1:57:17] it's not haphazard the convention was
[1:57:20] like it was or the camp was like it was
[1:57:21] or or today is like it was like it is
[1:57:24] it's not haphazard
[1:57:26] I mean God is wanting you to know this
[1:57:28] is me Here I am prison upon the earth I
[1:57:31] meant to draw you to myself I mean the
[1:57:33] you Endora that you are part of me
[1:57:35] hallelujah I mean little they don't
[1:57:38] humanity fade away they don't complexes
[1:57:40] go
[1:57:41] they don't plane go little Shango they
[1:57:44] roll worse than the blood of Jesus
[1:57:45] Christ don't worry about it he took care
[1:57:48] of it that day hallelujah he took care
[1:57:51] of your paths he took care of your shame
[1:57:53] he took care of your mistakes in your
[1:57:54] son I mean don't worry about it
[1:57:57] it's been painful it's been washed it's
[1:57:59] been cleansed from you hallelujah
[1:58:02] we don't need to worry I am no longer a
[1:58:05] slave to fear I am a child of God
[1:58:08] hallelujah I have been identified by a
[1:58:11] voice hallelujah amen
[1:58:15] it is what it is Amen hallelujah
[1:58:20] hallelujah amen
[1:58:23] so this he who now letteth will lit this
[1:58:26] is Christ himself
[1:58:28] and the reason I put the series he is
[1:58:30] only he he's a person it's not part of
[1:58:34] someone it's not Christ by measure it's
[1:58:37] Christ without measure amen and thing is
[1:58:41] when he who now so when he's taken away
[1:58:43] what does take now the way what does
[1:58:45] that mean when he leaves the Holy Ghost
[1:58:48] is lifting off the Gentiles amen the
[1:58:53] Holy Ghost is lifting off the Gentiles
[1:58:55] and when he leaves if you're part of him
[1:58:58] you have to leave you have to go with
[1:59:01] him if you're part of him he won't leave
[1:59:03] one who's behind hallelujah he won't
[1:59:06] leave his little ones behind he say I'm
[1:59:08] just a little little one in the faith he
[1:59:10] won't leave you behind
[1:59:11] I'm not I'm old you know I've been
[1:59:14] through a lot of things he won't leave
[1:59:16] the old behind he won't leave the young
[1:59:17] behind he's taking all that the father
[1:59:19] has given me will come they will come to
[1:59:23] mean all that come to me all no wise
[1:59:25] cast out hallelujah so I have to go amen

[2:01:14] hallelujah amen so the seven seals in
[2:01:19] Genesis whether Bram see isn't it odd I
[2:01:22] think well I've already mentioned this
[2:01:24] one but we'll go we'll put it up anyway
[2:01:30] technology
[2:01:33] anyway revelations three twenty two
[2:01:36] twenty 2008 were there behold I stand at
[2:01:40] the door and knock I stand you read the
[2:01:44] church ages he says his part where he
[2:01:46] walks among the candlesticks he goes
[2:01:48] from Ephesus he's walking all the way to
[2:01:50] let us hear but when he comes low to see
[2:01:52] sees I'm standing here amen I finished
[2:01:55] my journey through the church ages now
[2:01:58] I'm calling people to come out to me
[2:02:00] hallelujah that's what this voice does
[2:02:03] this message is a call come out come out
[2:02:06] of her my people and be not partakers of
[2:02:08] her sins come out from among them and
[2:02:11] something innocent I have to go
[2:02:15] I've heard us I've heard the master call
[2:02:18] holy like the Souris he was dead for
[2:02:20] days in the grave Jesus stood there by
[2:02:22] as gross as grave Lazarus come forth
[2:02:25] let's just had to come forth he couldn't
[2:02:28] stay do you think he wanted to go back
[2:02:29] nowhere you having you having fellowship
[2:02:31] with Peter James I mean I mean with
[2:02:33] Abraham Isaac and Jacob and you we are
[2:02:35] with the Saints you're an eternity
[2:02:36] hallelujah but he heard the Masters call
[2:02:39] he he had to he had to because he was
[2:02:42] part that voice he was connected with
[2:02:44] their voice how that's the same thing
[2:02:46] with us amen hallelujah yeah we should
[2:02:51] be the happiest people in all the world
[2:02:53] I mean we know that God uses trials to
[2:02:57] bring forth character I mean so we
[2:02:59] should even rejoice in trials when the
[2:03:01] Lord puts his finger I know is sister
[2:03:04] Chantal was saying about being the
[2:03:05] at the gate amen the reason the
[2:03:08] Lord puts us finger on our infirmities
[2:03:10] it's because not just to say how how
[2:03:12] you've got it he's here to say no this
[2:03:14] has come to an end that's why he puts
[2:03:17] his finger on on flaws of our character
[2:03:19] pains and conflict us because God is
[2:03:21] actually saying I've identified this
[2:03:23] because I want to take it from you that
[2:03:25] you don't have to carry this no more
[2:03:27] hallelujah amen that's why that's why he
[2:03:30] shows things in our life that we can say
[2:03:32] Lord this is not part of me do you think
[2:03:35] it's part of his nature to have
[2:03:37] complexes that crippled up your faith
[2:03:39] and you can't relate to people you can't
[2:03:41] enter into burdens you can't help one
[2:03:42] another do you think that's from God no
[2:03:44] amen it's from the devil God allowed it
[2:03:48] amen because he allows all things but he
[2:03:51] doesn't want us to carry it he wants us
[2:03:54] to say here Lord I'm done with this box
[2:03:56] of rattlesnakes amen
[2:03:59] that's why when the Lord puts his finger
[2:04:01] on you say Lord take it from me I'll die
[2:04:04] out here right now I'll die out to this
[2:04:06] company or die out to this pain Oh die
[2:04:08] out to my past
[2:04:09] I'll die out to this hurt I mean that my
[2:04:11] nature's change it doesn't bother me no
[2:04:13] more I mean and when the enemy tries to
[2:04:15] give it back to you there's something
[2:04:16] and you says it doesn't belong to me
[2:04:18] seyton take it back in the name of Jesus
[2:04:20] Christ it was never mind to begin with I
[2:04:22] mean you take it back and he has to take
[2:04:25] it back I mean cuz resist the devil he
[2:04:27] shall flee amen
[2:04:30] you gotta tell the devil where to go you
[2:04:34] tell Satan shut up and get out a man oh
[2:04:39] jesus didn't clown for the scribes and
[2:04:41] Pharisees those religious Devils
[2:04:44] he didn't clown he walked on he did what
[2:04:46] he was called to do I mean we should do
[2:04:49] the same thing as I said the Apostle
[2:04:51] pulled and go back to your manly try and
[2:04:52] convince him he just walked on with Lord
[2:04:55] amen
[2:04:57] now we that's coming thought my Terry I
[2:05:07] like brother arm and he's awesome
[2:05:09] can you go next one oh yes okay now God
[2:05:15] had a purpose now if you want to listen
[2:05:17] to something you listen to the seals
[2:05:19] seventh seal and then listen to Christ
[2:05:21] and mystery God revealed because brother
[2:05:24] Bernie seasoned the sim seal not you
[2:05:25] know he comes to points he says no I
[2:05:27] can't I can't say anymore but then in
[2:05:30] this service he tells you what it is
[2:05:32] amen
[2:05:34] now God had a purpose these are not
[2:05:37] sermons friends just like Jesus giving
[2:05:39] up parables it's not just a story just a
[2:05:41] you know no he's he's laying things out
[2:05:44] that we would that we would because of
[2:05:45] our love relationship we would catch
[2:05:47] what he's really saying amen now God had
[2:05:50] a purpose in a hidden mystery and that's
[2:05:52] what I want to speak on to the church
[2:05:54] this morning the hidden mystery of God
[2:05:55] that he had in his mind before the world
[2:05:57] ever began and how that it's unfolded
[2:06:00] itself right down to this present hour
[2:06:02] that we're living see then you'll
[2:06:04] understand clearly you'll see oh I
[2:06:06] believe what is being done so this is
[2:06:08] great mysteries unfolded down to this
[2:06:10] very hour he says now God's great
[2:06:13] mystery oh it's a secret he kept it a
[2:06:16] secret nobody know nothing about it even
[2:06:18] the Angels didn't understand it see he
[2:06:20] didn't reveal it that's the reason under
[2:06:23] our seventh mystery when the seventh
[2:06:24] seal was open there was silence Jesus
[2:06:28] when he was on earth they wanted to know
[2:06:30] when he would come he said
[2:06:32] it's not it's not even the Sun himself
[2:06:35] don't know when it's going to happen see
[2:06:38] God has this all to himself it's a
[2:06:41] secret and that's the reason there was
[2:06:43] silence in heaven for a space of half an
[2:06:45] hour and seven thunders uttered their
[2:06:46] voices John was even forbidden to write
[2:06:48] at sea the coming of the Lord that's one
[2:06:51] thing he hasn't revealed yet or how he
[2:06:53] will come and when he will come it's a
[2:06:56] great thing that he doesn't know we're
[2:07:00] gone next one no he has showed it or
[2:07:03] revealed it in every type that's in the
[2:07:06] Bible therefore the entire Bible is the
[2:07:08] revelation of God's mystery in Christ
[2:07:11] the entire Bible is an expression of one
[2:07:14] goal that God had one purpose he wanted
[2:07:17] to achieve in the entire Bible and all
[2:07:19] the acts of the believers in the Bible
[2:07:21] has been in type and expressing what
[2:07:23] God's great goal is and now can we say
[2:07:27] now now in this last day he has revealed
[2:07:30] it and shows it and with God's help
[2:07:33] we'll see it right here this morning
[2:07:36] what God had in his mind all along and
[2:07:39] has expressed it aim it says it was a
[2:07:43] secret with God peace is no it's been
[2:07:47] revealed and every type shadow the acts
[2:07:50] of the believers is expressing this one
[2:07:52] goal that's why you can go to Genesis
[2:07:54] with Adam and Eve upon there so there's
[2:07:56] a seventh seal right there and you go
[2:07:58] down through the scripture you see the
[2:07:59] seventh seal I mean Christ bring your
[2:08:02] people to their place in position I mean
[2:08:04] in him hallelujah Amen now so every type
[2:08:10] in the Bible is revealing the coming of
[2:08:12] the Lord can you hold on for 10 minutes
[2:08:16] now I'll pick this up I just want to
[2:08:18] come to this one point okay so now let's
[2:08:21] go to let's go to the next yeah here we
[2:08:23] are so every time in the bowl is
[2:08:25] revealing the coming the Lord and we
[2:08:26] should be able to see the Seventh Seal
[2:08:28] from Genesis to Revelation so you should
[2:08:30] see yourself that's why it's when God
[2:08:32] anoints the word he shows you who you
[2:08:34] are like the mighty men like Esther like
[2:08:37] Ruth like Rahab like even David amen
[2:08:40] like the apostles I mean you can see
[2:08:42] yourself in the scripture because God is
[2:08:45] trying to get you to
[2:08:46] see this is who you are in him they were
[2:08:48] expressing you and as a shadow but you
[2:08:51] are the reality hallelujah Amen so when
[2:08:56] Christ is identified and you identifying
[2:08:58] himself then you are christ-like which
[2:09:00] the word Christian means to be
[2:09:02] christ-like there is your identification
[2:09:03] all right now and since he is our
[2:09:06] identification then we should be
[2:09:08] identified with him by living for him
[2:09:11] can we go next one now this is from the
[2:09:13] Christ mystery God revealed again as
[2:09:14] well
[2:09:14] now notice God has a three-fold purpose
[2:09:18] in this great mystery secret God in His
[2:09:20] great mystery secret that he had before
[2:09:22] the wool began he got a three-fold
[2:09:24] purpose in it and now what we want to go
[2:09:26] upon this morning is what is this refold
[2:09:29] purpose now I believe by the help of God
[2:09:31] who is present heel shot to us now if he
[2:09:34] had it had the threefold purpose we want
[2:09:36] to find out what the three-fold purposes
[2:09:38] now the first thing God wanted to do was
[2:09:40] reveal himself to the people now can we
[2:09:42] go can we go next one he couldn't do it
[2:09:45] as great Jehovah God who covered all
[2:09:47] time and space and eternity he could not
[2:09:49] he was too great to ever be revealed to
[2:09:51] people because it would be too
[2:09:52] mysterious now how could that great
[2:09:55] being that never did begin that after
[2:09:57] you went beyond the cycle of hundreds of
[2:10:00] billions and trillions and trillions of
[2:10:01] years of light space and now on and to
[2:10:04] the infinite into the eternity and a
[2:10:06] great creature that all was that and
[2:10:09] still is we go next one but what he
[2:10:12] wanted to do he loved fatherhood for he
[2:10:14] was a father and the only way he could
[2:10:16] express it was to become a son a man
[2:10:18] that's the reason Jesus kept saying the
[2:10:20] son of man see they didn't know what he
[2:10:22] was talking about many of them but now
[2:10:24] you get it see he wanted to express
[2:10:26] himself that was his one of his great
[2:10:29] threefold purposes was to express
[2:10:31] himself identify himself with human
[2:10:33] beings to reveal himself in Christ on
[2:10:36] the next one
[2:10:36] secondary to have preeminence and his
[2:10:38] body of believers that is his bride that
[2:10:41] he may live in people and the third fold
[2:10:43] is the restoration of you know eating
[2:10:45] and all those things but this is what
[2:10:47] this is what he wanted to do Alleluia
[2:10:51] now let's just go to Genesis 24 I just
[2:10:55] want to touch this real quick and then
[2:10:56] it they aren't going to finish then well
[2:10:58] maybe we'll pick it up next time
[2:10:59] that's what he wanted to do he wanted to
[2:11:02] reveal himself in Christ and then have
[2:11:05] preeminence and the people that he would
[2:11:06] live in them and then restore read and
[2:11:08] this is threefold that's a really the
[2:11:09] three-fold purpose of the seventh seal
[2:11:11] amen hallelujah and so now here comes
[2:11:14] and then we can see thee we can see even
[2:11:18] in Genesis 24 speaking of Rebecca and
[2:11:20] Isaac here's a seventh seal again now
[2:11:22] this is just a few but go dig amen go
[2:11:26] read your Bible I challenge you go look
[2:11:29] brother Ram says that he just hit the
[2:11:31] high points but then people come come
[2:11:33] dig down what he's saying amen now so it
[2:11:37] came to pass so this is Eliezer
[2:11:40] so Eliezer finds Isaac a bride and when
[2:11:43] the bride becomes one with Isaac then
[2:11:46] Isaac falls heir of all that Abraham has
[2:11:48] amen top of the seventh seal now it came
[2:11:51] to pass it before he was done speaking
[2:11:53] behold Rebekah came out as Eliezer
[2:11:55] praying Lord made the damsel come and
[2:11:57] give me water and water my camels the
[2:11:59] one he's looking for a bride you know
[2:12:01] you know if Isaac came out who was born
[2:12:03] of bethuel son of Milcah the wife of
[2:12:06] Nahor Abraham's brother with her picture
[2:12:08] upon her shoulder and the damsel was
[2:12:11] very fair to look upon a virgin neither
[2:12:13] had any man known her and he went down
[2:12:15] to the well and filled her pitcher and
[2:12:17] came up and the servant ran to meet her
[2:12:19] and said let me I pray thee drink a
[2:12:21] little of thy picture now go next one
[2:12:24] and and she said drink my lord and she
[2:12:27] hasted and let down her pitcher upon her
[2:12:29] hand and gave him drink and when she was
[2:12:31] done having a drink she said I'll draw a
[2:12:33] water for my camels also until they were
[2:12:35] done drinking and she hasted and emptied
[2:12:37] her pitcher into the trough and ran
[2:12:39] again into the well and draw water and
[2:12:42] drew for all the camels now we're gonna
[2:12:44] jump down right down into the story this
[2:12:46] is down at the end so so Eliezer by this
[2:12:49] time has met her family you know
[2:12:51] revealed that the angel Lord came before
[2:12:54] him to find the bride and Rebecca has
[2:12:57] come to a place she's realized I'm part
[2:12:58] of that prayer I'm part of the vision
[2:13:00] I'm part of the word hallelujah trust
[2:13:03] you if you found yourself part of the
[2:13:05] vision I mean whether you know when
[2:13:07] brother Aaron saw the preview of the
[2:13:09] bride I mean he was looking at you
[2:13:10] walking up and
[2:13:11] heaven robed in the righteousness of
[2:13:13] Christ hallelujah glory and they called
[2:13:18] Rebecca and said unto her because
[2:13:19] because Eleazar said don't delay yo yo
[2:13:22] I found her I'm off you know and and
[2:13:25] they called a Rebecca and said unto her
[2:13:27] wilt thou go with this man she said I'll
[2:13:29] go and they sent away Rebecca their
[2:13:32] sister and her nurse and Abraham's
[2:13:33] servant and his men and they bless
[2:13:35] Rebecca and said unto her thou art our
[2:13:37] sister be there the mother of thousands
[2:13:40] of millions and let thy seed possess the
[2:13:41] gates of those who hate them and Rebecca
[2:13:43] arose and her damsels and they rode upon
[2:13:46] the camels and followed the man and the
[2:13:48] servant took Rebecca and went his way
[2:13:50] and Isaac came from the wealth from the
[2:13:54] way of the well of Lahori for he dwelt
[2:13:57] in the South Country and Isaac went out
[2:14:00] to meditate in the field that the
[2:14:01] Eventide lifted up his eyes and saw and
[2:14:03] behold the camels were coming and
[2:14:05] Rebecca lifted up her eyes and when she
[2:14:08] saw Isaac she lighted off the camel just
[2:14:10] stopped there so here's Rebecca comes to
[2:14:12] a well right she comes to well but now
[2:14:16] she's gonna live by a different well I
[2:14:18] mean this well she's gonna live by as in
[2:14:21] the Promised Land
[2:14:22] I promised land is Christ I mean to this
[2:14:25] well that she's gonna live by as a well
[2:14:27] of living water I mean it's not a man
[2:14:29] and you know it's not just a man-made
[2:14:31] well you know I mean this well is in the
[2:14:34] promised land it's in Christ and he said
[2:14:36] that we would draw from this well I mean
[2:14:39] and we're drink the rivers of living
[2:14:40] water and we'd never thirst again so
[2:14:43] she's gonna come live by different well
[2:14:45] hallelujah it's the same thing with you
[2:14:47] and I I mean this water hasn't run out
[2:14:49] it's still sweet the word is still
[2:14:52] sweeter still refreshing and given us
[2:14:54] strength hallelujah it's still wonderful
[2:14:56] that's why the word gets richer I mean
[2:15:00] so now she's come to live by different
[2:15:01] wealth so now when she sees Isaac says
[2:15:04] she's heard about Isaac but now they're
[2:15:06] gonna meet halfway
[2:15:07] I'm in-between the tenth Sarah's tent
[2:15:11] right and and we're there they're gonna
[2:15:12] meet in the field and the Eventide
[2:15:15] amen you go look in the scripture a lot
[2:15:17] of things happen in the evening time a
[2:15:19] lot of things happen in harvest time as
[2:15:21] well hallelujah

[2:15:26] harvest time and we're in the evening

[2:15:38] have a jubilee don't get fat on the word
[2:15:40] holy go a feast you'll enjoy it
[2:15:43] amen so that's oh here she comes she's
[2:15:45] meeting her right she's meeting her
[2:15:47] husband halfway and then when she sees
[2:15:50] him amen then she comes off a camel now
[2:15:54] we'll go to the next one
[2:15:58] okay so I just dropped the son this is
[2:16:00] the woman at the well give me the drink
[2:16:02] you know that what is ask him and he
[2:16:05] would give thee living water the woman
[2:16:09] said sir thou has nothing to draw with
[2:16:11] the well is deep from whence hast thou
[2:16:12] living water at their brethren our
[2:16:14] Father Jacob which gave us the well and
[2:16:16] drank thereof himself and and his
[2:16:18] children and his cattle and jesus
[2:16:20] answered said unto her whosoever
[2:16:21] drinketh of this water shall thirst
[2:16:23] again but whoever drinketh of the water
[2:16:25] that I shall give him shall never thirst
[2:16:27] but the water that I shall give him
[2:16:29] shall be in him a well of water
[2:16:30] springing up into everlasting life
[2:16:33] the woman said unto sir give me this
[2:16:35] water that I thirst not Heather I mean
[2:16:38] neither come hither to draw and then he
[2:16:41] begins to reveal her past and she says
[2:16:43] sir when Messiah cometh we'll know he he
[2:16:46] will do these things that Jesus said I
[2:16:47] am he
[2:16:48] a me so now he begins to reveal I mean
[2:16:50] he is the Messiah he is as well of
[2:16:52] living water
[2:16:53] she took a drink as you never thirst it
[2:16:55] again hallelujah that's exactly like you
[2:16:58] and I I mean something so let's go back
[2:17:00] down to Genesis now for she I hates it
[2:17:04] unto the servant what man is this that
[2:17:06] walketh in the field to meet us how
[2:17:08] lujah lujah I mean it's the same thing

[2:17:30] and in Christ we are ascending we're
[2:17:32] being lifted up hallelujah
[2:17:34] and then soon amen we're
[2:17:38] we'll be gone and so and the servant
[2:17:42] said it's my master therefore she took a
[2:17:43] veil and covered herself and the servant
[2:17:46] told Isaac all the things that he had
[2:17:47] done so now here comes here comes
[2:17:49] Rebekah amen
[2:17:51] and so she sees this man walking in the
[2:17:54] field and and and the servant points out
[2:17:56] I mean the message points out this is
[2:17:58] your husband so what she does is she
[2:18:01] veils her head as she goes to meet her
[2:18:04] head I mean because our hitch up is
[2:18:07] Christ right and the headship is here
[2:18:09] Christ is here so what so she's not just
[2:18:11] being humble putting on a veil she says
[2:18:13] he recognizing this is my head I am his
[2:18:16] body
[2:18:17] amen are we not the body of Christ upon
[2:18:19] the earth a mess why we've come to
[2:18:21] recognize amen
[2:18:22] here's her head the word is our head and
[2:18:24] we are his body hallelujah that's why
[2:18:27] she veiled herself I mean because she
[2:18:29] now she's saying well if he is my head
[2:18:32] he's the intelligence that's why we have
[2:18:34] no thought coming that's why I says let
[2:18:36] the mind that was a Christ be in you not
[2:18:38] your own mind not your own singing but
[2:18:40] his mind
[2:18:41] hallelujah and the scripture says but
[2:18:42] you have the mind of Christ hallelujah
[2:18:44] and the bride has the mind of Christ why
[2:18:47] cuz she's united with the headstone
[2:18:50] glory these are just pearls
[2:18:54] they're precious to you when you realize
[2:18:57] you've become one he's made you one with
[2:18:58] him amen so the bride so that so so this
[2:19:04] is showing now she's identifying that
[2:19:06] this man that came to meet her is her
[2:19:08] head and she is the body and showing
[2:19:10] that the bride will only recognize the
[2:19:11] headship of Jesus Christ the word amen
[2:19:14] now I think I'll leave it there because
[2:19:18] I'm going to go into something else but
[2:19:22] let's go to the very last it's got the
[2:19:25] very last slide and we'll because I I
[2:19:28] see I asked for team but I've gone far
[2:19:31] past there now the new birth is Christ
[2:19:33] it's a revelation God has revealed it to
[2:19:35] you that this great mystery and that's
[2:19:37] the new birth and now what are you going
[2:19:40] to do when you get all that group
[2:19:41] together with the revelation is
[2:19:43] perfectly in harmony and God expressing
[2:19:46] it through his word by the same actions
[2:19:48] the same things that he did making the
[2:19:51] word manaphy
[2:19:52] oh if the church only knew its position
[2:19:56] at will one day this is now amen
[2:20:00] this is now right then the rapture will
[2:20:03] go when it knows what it is I mean
[2:20:07] Rebecca wasn't ordained to stay in her
[2:20:09] father's house
[2:20:10] she was ordained to become the bride of
[2:20:13] Isaac to live in the promised land I
[2:20:16] mean she was ordained to be his body
[2:20:19] hallelujah and that's why we have to
[2:20:21] come to a place we recognize what we are
[2:20:24] I mean we are the body of Christ not by
[2:20:26] accident but by design just like Eve was
[2:20:29] made by design hallelujah you following
[2:20:32] me God has made us his body by design
[2:20:35] that we are who we are His Word made
[2:20:38] flesh and then as the word unites with
[2:20:40] the word amen we are the word here's the
[2:20:43] word we become one amen so only the
[2:20:48] Christ so the reason though I want to
[2:20:51] end with this is this is what the
[2:20:52] Seventh Seal I mean you go look it
[2:20:54] through at the scripture you take Adam
[2:20:57] and Eve you just take now this is just
[2:20:58] me no doubt it'll unfold cause the word
[2:21:00] has a habit of unfolding but you take
[2:21:02] Adam and Eve in the garden dominion over
[2:21:05] the earth to me that's the manifestation
[2:21:07] of the seventh seal and you take that
[2:21:10] pattern and you go through the scripture
[2:21:12] with it and you'll see whenever a woman
[2:21:14] is elevated to her position hallelujah
[2:21:17] you take Ruth you take Rahab amen you
[2:21:20] know you take Esther you take all these
[2:21:22] different ones you'll see what's that
[2:21:24] the seven seals manifesting itself again
[2:21:26] you take Rebecca amen and so these
[2:21:30] things are there that you would know
[2:21:31] this is who you are in Christ there are
[2:21:33] shadow pointing to you I mean as is only
[2:21:36] at the church only knew its position we
[2:21:40] are ears of the Father joint ears with
[2:21:42] the son hallelujah it will one day in
[2:21:45] here in the rapture will go I mean let's
[2:21:50] stand to our feet shall we where the
[2:21:51] musicians please
[2:21:53] hallelujah that we have that song in the
[2:22:02] on the projector where is of the father
