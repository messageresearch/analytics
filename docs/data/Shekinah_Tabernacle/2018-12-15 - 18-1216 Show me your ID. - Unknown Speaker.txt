I'm heavier way as brother any comes this morning [Music] as we wait [Music] [Music] Jesus father we just come before you with the deepest reverence insincerity Lord their fathers in our life at the bottom of our hearts Lord we come Lord humbly before your throne Lord Jesus approaching you through the shed blood of Calvary Oh Lord that the price was paid it was sufficient that we could come and we could approach God again there is nothing between my soul and my Savior Alleluia or Jesus and we have steadfast confidence that the sacrifice that you made when you became flesh and you became a man because a man needed to pay the price of redemption you came and you paid it all and you displayed what a real man is you are the image of a true man a real true rugged real man and you were revealed that we could have an example and then the same spirit that was in you would come in us that we could live like you and I pray father that you would impress us that you would place a eternal impression of the image of your son and every heart in this room that every heart would receive an impressive image of the Son of God and their heart then I prayed it for the camp to Lord that the youth Oh Lord how people can as the human being is made Lord in such a way they see something and they analyze it and they want to be like they want to be like that musician they want to be like that what they saw there and impress them the devil's out there to impress us lon but father there's a greater image not some golden statue or some flesh car or some pretty woman or some rock star but the image of the son of God Lord this is Luke this is who we need to be impressed by and our youth that set the camp the people the rising next generation father I pray Lord that that image would deeply impress their hearts father I pray O God that then Lord you would deeply move each one and that image would just become so branded by fire in their hearts Lord Jesus and even this morning Lord the word that you desired and the the Oracle of God the supernatural seed in the word you desire for Jesus to minister linen impress us let us become sufficiently impressed by the message that you have sent us by the Holy Spirit that is speaking from the voice that cries from the blood that was spilled in the earth Lord we remember her the blood of Abel spoke vengeance that spoke did vengeance my brother killed me you said that the voice of thy brother's blood speaketh from the earth but we read in the book of Hebrews law that the blood of Jesus Christ speaks better things he meant it speaks liberty that speaks identity it speaks freedom it speaks the shackles are broken it speaks Liberty from sin it speaks life that speaks our true eternal nature our true freedom who we really are not the pseudo reality that we see here that has been fabricated by Satan but the reality of the true heavenly realm that is eternal let that be established this morning father that your anointing father meet every need speak into hearts discern speak the needs father of the hour I yield myself to your Lord and I ask Lord that you would grant prophetic utterance divine intervention Lord that the word would go forth and it would preach down into every heart every life let no stone be unturned hallelujah may you expose all the unfruitful works of darkness shine your lights that glorious light where the dew drops of Mercy a bright shine that light Lord and to every huh let the day star rise and every heart this morning father I pray that it would be new births in this room I pray Lord that you would penetrate beyond the intellect this morning Lord and let faith rise because father no man can come to you except the son drawsome and I pray that you would draw all men unto yourself as we lift you up high as we give you glory Lord Jesus have your way just commit the service into your hands law I humble myself under your mighty hand and pray Lord that our true identification would be realized this morning Jesus Christ's name hallelujah well praise the Lord these differently the anointing it's already very thick hallelujah can you turn the pulpit one off a little bit brother I don't really like that one because I bang the pulpit okay thank you praise the Lord this is why we're standing we shall turn in our Bibles to job chapter 38 verse 4 man well praise the Lord say Amen when you bring you there hallelujah joy 38 verse 4 says when we're where were you I'm gonna I'm calling that to you where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth declare if you have understanding who has laid the measures thereof if you know or who has stretched the line upon it we're upon other foundations thereof fastened or who laid the cornerstone thereof when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy where were you amen it's lord I pray that you add your blessing to the reading of your word and I pray father that you would reveal where we were when these things happen Jesus Christ amen do I have a slideshow here not that I'm doing a slideshow but I just want to have the Spanish for our Spanish friends well I didn't Indian friends say you can have your seats amen hallelujah I want to speak now the sermon title is as you can see show me your ID now I hope that many of you don't know what that means because you didn't do the things that I used to do but if you did the things that I used to do and you looked as young as I used to look hopefully I still look that way you get you hear this a lot well I heard this a lot anyway always I was always looking younger than I was so everyone always asked me for ID for things that were restricted by age we'll leave it there now we need our ID to prove who we are our ID proves our who we really are okay so we need that and not just for those things but we also need that when we travel around the world and we we go to different places or we need to apply for some official you know document or something we need to prove who we are and so you carry this ID and it says this is who I am this is me and you display that when someone calls for that you say yes this is me I'm I'm this person and they believe it because they see that it as a genuine ID and I trust that you are displaying your genuine identification in your life is that the real you or has your real identification asking you these questions now as a kind of a start to foundation thing and then we'll go and I'll just kind of open up a little bit about it but so as they you displaying the real you or has your real identification either never come and you are waiting on that or has been stolen because your identity can get stolen we know now there was some sisters and Auckland that lift their wallets in the car you know and and they went on a bush walk and when they came back someone had jumped in the car broken the window whatever and stolen all their identification so they couldn't prove who they were now that's just naturally but spiritually speaking now we have an enemy and his main goal because he can't what he can't do is he can't really can't destroy you because if God be for us who can be against so what he will try and do is he will try and lead you down garden paths he will try and lead you down roads that look good at the start but then they turn into gravel and they turn into big deep mushy gravel and you get no traction you can't really get anywhere and you start losing control because there's no traction on gravel but the devil's roads always start off as tarmac you know I remember once when I was driving man this is a real good example of what I'm saying here so I was very young in the Lord and and I hadn't driven the whole new New Zealand Island North Island for years and obviously been there having been in prison those things I it was a long time since I had driven right at the island and I went I had this map and the map was pretty vague it was that actually it was the title was actually on it was the front of the book so it was just really an abbreviated version of them happen you know that says something then we don't want to follow an abbreviated Bible doing we don't just want some modern Bible that abbreviates the Word of God because that's God's Word hey we want something that is genuine anyway so I'm following this map and it has one road I get to topo and this it's got from tapos stemming one highway five and I knew that I had to take Highway five out of tapper and little for knowin Stu me I ended up taking Highway 5 to why Orand yrl waro so I'm instead of going up Highway five are we're to cross down the other highway five I don't know why they have to highway 5 but anyway they do and so I'm driving happily fellowshipping with Joe and the car and we're just going for it and we're meant to be in terrible at a certain time and we're going the opposite direction now so I'm following a garden path because I looked at a map that wasn't completely you know it wasn't it wasn't accurate this met was taking me on another direction but it was so I'm following this thing and I'm like oh man now I have a choice now do I I spent three hours now driving in this one direction and I get a nice and I get to the teachers I'm like man this is I haven't driven the for a long time but I think this is not this is there's something going on here and then I get to the first intersection and it's got Napier and yrl or the other way around I think it was there and so I'm like what the Rotorua of Tehran there or Aucklanders gone the wrong way and I'm completely like oh dude and I'm like do I go back on that boring road and go the same way again or shall I just find another route up there and hasn't gone an adventure so I mean that I've gone through I ended up going down white lake waikaremoana and this road I looked at the map and I thought yet now looked at the real map this time I made sure it wasn't just the front you know the actual Paige the front cover of the book I went into the book and looked properly and I and I look at this thing and I go okay yes wheatless blake why correct my honor it takes me right back into five again and it's a bit of a detour it's gonna take me about three hours by the looks of it but anyway I'm gonna go through and have a nice scenic route so I Drive and it's all nice normal Road and then it goes to gravel and I'm like oh dear then it goes even worse it goes to mud and we're going through the bush and I think and my clutch was failing and I think man I hope I don't get attacked by like the local tribes or something you know if I put the car brakes because the clutch was not working very well and man it wasn't really it wasn't a pretty it was it was actually cutting I was like man but anyway the the moral of that story there is their road may look like it's sealed and good and it might look no that's just what the devil does that's what the enemy does as he makes the road look okay but there are ways that seem right to a man but the end thereof is death you know we can get caught up in their recent faculty and we can get caught up and and their whole mental realm and and it looks really good in it and we strive figure it all out but man cannot lead himself man is we're following something we're always following something or somebody or some influence or some image that has been displayed through some medium on in this society is always something that that could catch our attention and lead us down a certain path but we don't need that and and really the only true foundation that we want to follow is the Word of God amen that is the actually only true full reality that there is in existence as the Word of God the revealed pure true Word of God is the foundation of all law of all righteousness and of all judgment and of all mercy every thought that as pure comes from the word because that's God's preserved Symphony preserved sheet music blueprint whatever you want to call it for life for where we came from while we're here and how to get to where we want to go because no one wants to go down into the place that's void of all love and void of all joy and void of anything that has anything to do with God because that's where people go if they don't want them here they will get their wish and they'll end up where they think they want to be which is away from God but actually if you want to be with God and you want God now you'll get him in his fullness when you know and when you're raptured I mean lujah so yes we want we want to make a very we want to be prayerful about the paths that we take we want to be discerning now because I'm going to go into what these pads are and I'm not going to deal with every path because such a vast subject you know show me your ID you know identification the identification subject is so vast we could be here for weeks months on identification but I want to just sort of hone down into what paths of thought because thought is a very important factor of our life because we're thinking all the time and what we think on we become you are no higher than your thoughts and what you believe you are you are and you believe you can't you want if you believe you can you will that's what you believe and Jesus laid these things out and it wasn't just laid out just for Christianity was laid up for Humanity if you believe that you can happen if you have faith and believe that that mountain removed that shall be moved that goes for any human because every human has an element of faith inside them whether they are a true vessel that as a channel of God's glory or whether they're a channel of anything they have faith because they're a human they've been given a set sense to believe but I just thank the Lord that we can yield our gift we can yield our life we can yield our everything to the Holy Spirit to the true foundation of the Creator that created this earth that holds this whole universe together by his word hallelujah so as an outline I want you to look into your life what identification are you carrying if someone says show me your ID now I'm just is an analogy but no one's gonna say show me and you're a Christian you know but now I'm talking in a spiritual context here show me your ID what life are you displaying what identity as has lived out not just consciously now subconsciously what identity is being expressed out of your life is that identity your true eternal identity which is your inheritance which has been given to you you know and you hit the fight foot to keep that you have to fight to lay hold of that that's your true identity and it's in the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is your identification but now the devil can come into your thoughts and start distorting things and twisting things and you start getting caught up in your business you start getting caught up in politics you start getting caught up and all these waves of ideas and opinions and all these things what are they to do to do to distract you from your identification because a huge portion of your experience here is based on what you are consciously thinking on your experiencing I'm not talking about your your eternal inheritance I'm not talking about what you are by what God sees you but I'm talking about what you experience well how much quality of life you have here if you want quality of life and you want your identification to really be that you're really in fellowship with God and that supernatural presence is with you and it shows you things and angels come to you and you start seeing supernatural stuff unfold and the Bible speaks to you personally and God reveals himself to you and you start reading your life like you're reading the Bible and how God came to them because the same thing can happen to you but what are you thinking what is your life spin table where are you what are your fantasies no I don't say that in a dirty way or anything I'm saying what do you fantasize about what do you imagine as good and what are you thinking on all the time what is your heart because your heart has a voice you'll soul has a voice your will what is coming out what is being expressed is that worship are you worshiping them in your heart now it's a subconscious worship it just as a stream what is it so I want you to look into your life what idea you carrying is is it real or has your real ID been stolen and replaced with a fake ID because there's a lot of fake IDs this world is full of fake IDs people put on a masquerade they put on a front they put on something that's just a fake ID because they saw Katy Perry or some pop star and they like that and impress them and and and so their identification is that and they dress like that and they put their posters up in their rooms and they they love it or they see some tough guy they see some tough guy and they want to be a tough guy you know or they want to be they want they see some rugby player and they want to be like that they want to see some cricket player and they want to be like that therefore they've been given a fake ID because that image of that Sportster has been impressed upon them branded like a branding iron into their subconscious and therefore they get joy they get dopamine released into their mind when they start to act like that and they feel good makes them comfort and human life there's a preservation of your own comfort until you get the Holy Ghost and then you still try and preserve your comfort but you think about this first okay so we always want to be comfortable that's just human nature we want to be comfortable we want to be happy we don't choose to go through hard times we don't choose to go through trials but the choices that we make and the paths that we think on will determine these things they will allow us to go through because God does not want us to be thinking about all these other things all the time and actually as we get into the sermon I'll show you exactly what God actually wants for us in this hour what he wants for us what is our true identification and so I'm going to give you an over because it's such a a vast subject I'm just going to focus on four points here and this is who we are our Fortin and the second point I want to hand us our thoughts need to be on Christ all the time with heart worship and the third place that we want to move then into the revelation of our spiritual habitat now these things can be all Simmons and themselves but we're just going to go over view and a few if you do have time you know because I will put unpacking in a lot of content you can't listen to this again here you can go over you can take notes take scriptures because if we're going to read a lot and then I'm going to summarize the whole thing and the story of deborah and barak because there's a power that's released in their union that frees people that frees people and it's a responsibility that we have with our union and marriage to Christ and it's something that happens when we really become what I'm talking about today and really have and it's something that you actually possess you have your real identification but is it being displayed when someone says show me your ID now analogy again and it opens up your wallet of your life and and they see it is that you your eternal image is that who God thought of you before the foundation of the world where were you when this morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy I tell you where you were you were there hallelujah Amen you were there before the world was ever formed because you're an eternal being hallelujah euros eternal is God is eternal you come from God and you're going back to God hallelujah because you're his sons and daughters you're his family you were in his eternal mind now our thoughts start and they begin and they get fragmented maybe that but God's done those thoughts are eternal they're established they never change they're the exact and before the world was in again began his whole mind which is eternal and unfathomably amazing omniscient just for him everything thought of all of you and all your identity your real identity and he knew that you would struggle you would have hard times you would go down gravel roads that look good at the start and became hard and you wiped out and you realize that when you open your wallet there was a fake ID inside there and not a real ID and then you say lord save me like Peter when he was sinking down in the water he said lord save me and sometimes we just have to do that we have to humble ourselves and realize that this identification that is being displayed in my life has come from some impressionable image out there and not from the gods revelation of who Jesus is now what is Jesus doing this second what is his program has planned because when we realize that we will be placed in our habitat and when you're placed in your true spiritual habitat where you are made for you will express your true identification that's true when you're placed in the habit and I'm going to place you today and you're hepatech hallelujah amen amen well I'm going to preach it anyway it's up to you whether you get placed there or not hallelujah I'm going to preach about what's going on in this hour so just a little overview because we can't exhaust these things it's inexhaustible hallelujah but we'll just touch on a few things they meant about some front-page news or what's going on in this very hour who wants to know what's going on in this very hour who wants some front-page news that's more current than the Dominion Post in four years time amen hallelujah because God is prophetic he tells you things before they happen because he knew it would happen hallelujah he knew every nature of every man he knew the societies and how every nature and every person would ever evolve and become a certain way without even interfering of their free will he would just inspire this one and inspire they learn and give that one faith and bring this one forth him through that and put them all together to make you hallelujah physically and make your personality and then he had put let your life become a race become a challenge become a battle so that it would reform you and he would put his image in front of you he would preach his true word to you so that that image could become impressed open your heart this morning and let his image and press you howl ooh you go beyond this thing you know the devil is so good at working with us and all I'm just going to say stop listening to him don't listen to anything that makes you feel negative anything that stones have pulling you down or try and pull someone else down on degrade who you are what God says you are in the Bible you have authority over those things those of power of suggestion the devil is the master of power of suggestion because he knows how the human psyche works he knows how it works he just has to keep doing something and he and he starts to breathe familiarity and he starts to I can't remember what that there's a term actually I've got it here it's called mere-exposure effect thank the Lord I put that wrote that down when I was studying something ages ago I'd never want to remember that but mere-exposure effect this is how this is a very very cunning and it's a every human none of us are exempt from the mere-exposure effect that's familiarity when you you might have heard something and not even really listen to it but then you hear it again then you hear it over here and then it places this image into the world and you use as mere exposure and in all the sudden you love it and you might have hated that thing and all of a sudden you liked it even now with real true gospel songs and real true sermons or whatever preachers or whatever it may be in righteousness the same thing you get familiar with something you like it and you might not like that you might not jell with it you might want to like that song all of a sudden you start liking that thing and you're beating your foot and you're like it's not too bad it's true now we are all made like we just made like that we're like a highly absorbent people where 90 percent or 80 something percent water apparently I don't know but anyway it doesn't feel like it fluffing around but anyway we're a lot water and water can absorb things so well you know you can take a cup of water like that and you can pour an equal volume of raro or sugar there and it doesn't actually increase in volume because of osmosis which is like the diffusion whatever it may be but it just absorbs into it and we are like that spiritually we are like that we're so impression of all we have to arrest our fault we have to take control of that garden because that garden in your mind is very fertile those children they're all sleeping they must have had a good time I'm about to close oh yeah yeah so those children are like little Gardens you know you whatever we and especially at the innocent age of innocence you know they're just you know whatever you saw in there whatever you tell them they're going to that's like a little seed that's thought and the the nature of that thought if it's evil or good will be planted in them and it will and it will it might not in my 18 years 20 years and then one day they don't go because seeds just know the atmosphere that they need to to Germany right every seed has its own germination specific aspects you know like it's so it'll be a certain amount of humidity a certain amount of light a certain amount of rain a certain amount of something in the atmosphere and the soil all of a sudden comes up and we like that so just what use things on you become don't let the devil lead you down garden paths because I see it so often my goodness how many people struggle because they think stupid thoughts not that they generate them but they are through the power of suggestion through demonic study of their life demons study you they study you and they wait and then they plant a thing they fire forts at you they fire all these things at you to see what you do and people just constantly thinking about these thing they put there and they start to stew on them and they started because when a thought comes to you it doesn't just come as information that's just flat it comes with an emotion it comes with a feeling it comes with a with a pride or it comes with a lust or it comes with a jealousy or it comes with a MELAS it comes with all these different things or of God's thoughts it comes with love comes of faith it comes with identity hallelujah now you are the judge in your life to judge those thoughts you have to make the decision am I going to entertain this this is making me feel a certain way and anyway you'll get caught up before we realize it's happening because we're just humans and we might be brushing our teeth like happens to me all the time and because I can't see it and the devil's just stop coming at me and I'm just I just go off on this big train and I end up back in the same room and my thoughts and I'm like wow I'm here and and it's negative and I go off and I just say get out of here Satan you know and you have to he's a real enemy and he will do those things to try and he what he want to do wants to get those thought and he wants to stir it up in here and then he wants it to come down into here amen I'm gonna read some stuff now because I think it's good sorry Spanish brothers but that's the opening Scripture I'll let you read that but we have to be careful what we allow okay I'm going to read one more scripture about our eternal identification oh good Oh somebody so we want to turn to 2 Corinthians 5:1 says here for we know that if our earthly house of this Tabernacle we resolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens hallelujah I believe that I believe that because I'm ever going to be there but I'm already there spiritually my body my eternal being my eternal nature that's in the mind of God which is eternal that never had a beginning or an end it was right there now ask me to explain it I can't I can't explain it but it's just amazing you know Jesus when you're speaking to Nicodemus he said the son of man he's referring to myself and third person he says the son of man is talking to you but he's also inhibited so somehow it happens like that somehow if you're ever going to be there you're already there that's why you could sing together with the sons of God and shout the stars before the world was even began and if then and and the same goes for where we're going into eternity you are already there and we're and I don't know if you caught this and if you actually heard this testimony but brother Brennan's testimony when he was taken beyond the curtain of time God he was lying on his bed one day and and he was wondering about what it would be like when you died and how it would be in heaven and what form you had been in the Lord spoke being a prophet he could use him in certain ways and he said would you like to see beyond the curtain of time would you like to see an eternity and he said oh yes I would like that I mean who wouldn't like that everyone would like that people would like to do that wouldn't you I would I'd love to go and see I'd love to experience that that that what God has prepared that has never even entered the heart of man it's so glorious now he went there and he and he was and he said words cannot describe it and then when he came back and he's that now he's telling this congregation and he said to them he said I saw you all there you were there so somehow God has it so yes we are playing that time and we're in a shadow of what we really are we're like a shell this life and what we had possessed in these bodies is just a very of a shell of what we should be of what we could be and what Adam was before the fall and what Jesus was when he walked the earth and had control over everything that's what we're meant to be but we because of the fallen because Adam lost that inheritance and we lost and this flesh became sinful and started thinking all that other stuff that identification that pure true faith in identity was diminished and it got diminished right down until here we are hello trouble moves problems this turn the things that it says that it shouldn't and the stuff that comes out and there and there in the little niggly things it's all stuff to hinder and aggravate your identification but see he saw them all there that means that if you're ever going to be there you were there too and he saw you hallelujah he saw you you are already there a mess I just wanted to you know this is who you are you are not just some mistake or some just random number of humanity with chromosome but God painted your chromosomes he took your great-great great-great great-great-grandfather's and hid mothers and he put them all together without interfering a free world and he painted your chromosome and once that chromosome was exactly what he saw in his mind the very very code is so intricate and when that was exactly the way it should be then he put that predestined seed inside your life because he knew that there it is there's the image I saw this the that's machine that's who he looks like that's them all finally there but my place that seed inside let's see to receive the word for your day that see to come into connection to be children to the frequency of the voice of God for this hour not history now everyone knows the history even unbelievers it can't deny the history of Calvary because the whole civilization is centered around it while Western anyway you know you can't deny it civilization is at really centered around Calvary it sends it around the cross all birthdays all dates all calendars everything all of it the humanity basically I mean it's drifted away and the last since man started really eating from the tree of knowledge of 1948 it's really drifted away and the conscious and psyche of men especially you know there are some countries that still kind of hold to it but most countries now especially New Zealand has the the mentality general mentality is godless but society was centered right around Christianity amen well we'll just get back on track because I don't know why I went down that path but anyway we did let's go to Colossians 3:4 it says here now I want to show you something here and this may be a little deep for some this may be something that you've never heard before and and or you might have been you might have already seen it in the scriptures and your studies yourself but the appearing of Christ and the coming of the Lord and corporal form is two different things and if you we're not going to study right through it but I'm just going to tell you that that's what it is and the scripture is very clear that the appearing and when he talks many places we talks about the appearing and the New Testament when the Apostles are talking about this appearing to come they are talking about when Jesus comes spiritually to prepare the people for the rapture when Jesus comes and his full identity again not just partial not just a portion not just a little bit of Revelation for the theology but before person in spiritual form in the revelation of his word he would appear and and and because you know he's like the son and the son of God he appears in his full identity and we look at him and it's been preached now you're you're getting you're getting that image now the real Jesus has been preached to you the full glory of Jesus and word form in the revelation of the scripture as being ministered for so an entrance shall be ministered to you now we net as minister to you in that full image of Christ which is appearing and the last days to give you a true to build you up in the most holy faith to give you something to look at an image so you can be impressed by that image and take his identity the way you take his identity is through spiritual marriage to him spiritual marriage to the Son of God he is the bridegroom the whole scripts are centered around marriage it's centered around marriage he is the bridegroom the masculine part of God the masculine expression of God and the church is the feminine expression of God and the climax of his symphony the very crescendo of God's symphony as the full union between bridegroom and bride hallelujah and what happens there is we through marriage receive his name hallelujah and we received his seed his word the word is a concept that's a seat and inside it's got the Holy Ghost you plant there enhance you can't plant achmet you go partner in your spiritual wound and see what happens you go entertaining those thoughts amen hallelujah stop thinking about other stuff all the time that's real estate in here are you gonna give all the stuff out here in real estate and what is it going to prove you know you're trying to figure out this and trying to do that they have to figure it out for you let her bleed you all your business affairs will become a lot better all your education will become a lot better everything will become better because it's founded on something real hallelujah and he this is litmus mind being new the mind of Christ let that mind be in you hallelujah amen I love you so the appearing of Christ we're in it we are in the appearing of Christ you know there's no longer stabbing at things now it's no longer just taking a theological approach to figuring out the Bible that's not rapturing material here but it was ages where this was God used that and he inspired but he didn't really ever use the theology of men that isn't Scripture that he gave them enough for to have when he was dealing with them in that capacity you see each age in the church now I won't talk about the artists book but there's the same just a shadow fall but in the New Testament each church each age each generation it was allotted a certain portion you know they were given a certain portion and they were given a certain characteristic of God they were given a portion of Revelation and in the next one and the next one and obviously you know the story how it went down and you know the Dark Age came over and and really crippled everything even agnostic and even sciences and all that sort of crippled everything it was satanic to the expression of humanity cuz he hates humanity so the Dark Age is really what Satan wants to do to you and if you walk away from God that's what's going to happen to you you're going to be twisted up in his whip you know one smarter than him in the flesh and if you walk away from God he's think on those things and you start getting caught up and all his thoughts all the time in you and and you're not using your sword your authority to cast them down you get caught up in those things and the Dark Ages is what will happen in your life you'll have your own Dark Age and I mean you know we do have that day sometimes where it's hard and you get down sometimes you get depressed and sometimes you get frustrated and sometimes you've got no patience just too much sometimes there's all these things but that's just one day here and then but if you let the devil just take rampant control what you sort of Dark Ages will happen in your own life that's what he wants to do to humans he hates humanity he wants to press them down but then God says now I'm not gonna let you do that anymore and I'm going to give him I'm gonna now you're not he had a revelation you don't have the service Catholicism to get saved you don't have the cross and crawled and confessed all these priests and two sisters Annalee rubbish you can just believe that he died for you and that was enough and they came out of it they were liberated by faith and they were justified they had a portion they had a push then had everything that Jesus was yet they had Jesus they had a spirit because the spirit was telling them that but then he wanted to give some more so he gave more to John Wesley and what of the the age of holy missing them holding this movement and developed them develop then he kept giving them portions of his word until finally in the last days it was time for his appearing because he needed a church to reflect him not reflect some school of theology not reflect 90% of truths and meant 10% of Catholicism and some man's ideas but 100% the identity of Jesus Christ to be revealed the only way he can do that is by a word prophet like Moses that's why he's into Gentile prophet it's the only way there's no other way for God to declare the fullness of himself through theology through some hierarchy that's figuring it out they did their thing they had their time but the last days for the appearing of Jesus Christ he had to use a word born prophet that was none of their thoughts that was all God's thoughts through the mouthpiece that's how a prophet office works you know there's minor prophets and gifts of prophecy in the church is that God or is that then it's God speaking but you see that's just a minor gift it's a gift of prophecy they give you a word they give you knowledge they give you wisdom won't they give you those things but they're not actual word born prophets like Moses that lead a generation from one thing into another God needs for the most you think about this this event with the appearing of Christ as one of the most major events in history how could man and his hierarchy and theology figure that out it takes the only way to do it is by God's alone Jesus Christ Himself speaking and the only way you can speak Angela and take a peep 'l as through the office of a prophet that's why we read an Amos 3:7 it says that the Lord God will do nothing except he revealeth his secrets to a servants the prophets amen hallelujah well you know I get quite a hit myself so here we read now in Colossians about we're just going to read a couple of things about the appearing just the appearing is so that you can reflect them I'm trying to get to that they're just never time to happen the appearing is so that you can reflect them so that you can behold the true image of the Son of God and go I like that I'm impressed by that that affects my life I love that nature I love that life I love that character I choose to be identified with that who chooses to be identified with the Son of God the real son of God nothing to do with men nothing to do a theology nothing to do with intellectualism but Jesus Christ and the in time would appear to his church to say Here I am others mean look in my face hallelujah this is Who I am reflect me you are the moon and I am the Sun hallelujah the moon reflects the light of the Sun does it produce its own life you're the moon you're here to reflect his light in the night evening time hallelujah I'll give me it so that is the purpose now I get I've got it out there's to reflect them to your identity there's been reflecting him there's actually a beautiful scripture write this down if you can Isaiah 30 verse 26 Isaiah 30 let's just read them sorry my spanish-speaking brethren but I don't have this on the projector but Isaiah 30 verse 26 this is one of my most favorite passages of scripture in the Bible because it tells me about my life it tells me what's happening now it says here moreover the light of the Moon hello moon she'll be as the light of the Sun and the light of the Sun shall be stepping forward as the light of seven days in the day that the Lord binds up the breech of his people and heals the stroke of their wound this is the message that you have received this is that the very heart of God right now he you see what I'm telling you about the all of these ages have received a portion this seven church ages men don't even look at my fingers but there's seven church ages seven days seven seven expressions of God two different ages you know and all of them had a portion of truth the first church had a lot of the truth most of it he reserved one thing one small portion because if they had that they would have had a wretched him you see so he reserved from the first church that book that was sealed seven seals it stayed sealed for him it stayed in the hands of the Father for him even though their sins was paid for and their Jesus was leading the church he held that back because then he said to Daniel Daniel seal it up until the end time seal that up until the time of the end when knowledge shall increase when mansions eat from the tree of knowledge of it more then open it because that all that all that all that all seal away my bride it'll give her what she needs to be raptured Amen so here you are and all those seven days all the like all those the portioned allotments of word that came to all those generations through the seven Church ages has been gathered together under a prophetic ministry to preach all the truth to you so that you would shine like the brightness of the Sun as the light of seven days and one day put that on your fridge and say that's me that's me I'm the moon I'm reflecting the light of the Sun and the Sun has decided now it's her season that he's going to shine everything you know what happens when he shines all seven colors of the rainbow at once who knows what color it is white all seven colors together as white amen so you see the first to attend to receiver color second third fourth fifth sixth right to the pinna costal and charismatic move pin across the motion I say now these colors but then he would get it all together and he would shine at all he would what's the word consolidate he will consolidate all of it so that the entity the seed of that word would be the appearing of Christ and he would preach it to you and he would say to you arise and shine for your light has come and the glory of the lord has risen upon thee and the light would shine in the dark places of your heart and the day star himself would arise in your heart amen what do you think happened to Mary when Mary had the angelic visitation and he preached her a message when the coming of the Lord began didn't it and he'll I just started the coming that's physically because he had to pay for the sins now the start of the coming happens in you hallelujah that's how it works because you've received the same angels message because Gabriel announced the message of the first coming Gabriel announced the message of the second coming it's the same thing God just repeats this history but this time he didn't need a corporal lamb Jesus Christ to pay for our sins because they're paid for so he just you received escaped the fullness of his word and the same son of God spiritually now without a physical body inside you a spiritual body the appearance of him is born in here coming of the Lord has just started there's a couple little cells inside just like Mary coming Oh Lord it began it was already there specific there you see these things are so humble so small seemingly they're actually big great things God does great things very quietly he does great things that man doesn't even realize the whole church world doesn't even realize what's going on you know there's so many they're going about pomp and they've got their whole thing will draw down this is how it's going to happen you know God's gonna open the skies and he's gonna roll out the cup he's going to destroy the Roman Catholics he's gonna destroy the the beasting and a destroy all the stuff it's happening already Alleluia it's already happening yes there is all going to happen but we're gonna be with them Alleluia you do realize that that the second coming when he comes in his body hello who's going to be on white horses with them who's going to be there with him Alleluia so his appearing is coming so that you can actually be part of the coming you're part of the coming of the Lord cuz you're his wife and he spent the last 2000 years building the real church building building building building and there's been a a bride put away in every age in one day they're all going to gather together and we're going to be caught up to meet him in the air and then we're going to ride out we're gonna spend three and a half years and supper and we're gonna rejoice we're gonna talk to each other share testimonies whatever happens I don't know it's gonna be amazing and then we're gonna go back with them and the second coming more actually that everyone actually is really the general consensus sees will be with them amen I know that's probably a lot to swallow but that's exactly what it is it's perfectly scriptural lujah now that there when I preach these things you know this is the image of the Son of God this is the true Word of God when you can see those things it's going to produce life because you're seeing reality this is your natural super natural habitat this is where you're meant to look when you realize these things what it does is it unclips all the stuff that you know you our own ideas and Satan's ideas and all those ideas that just it just undoes them because the Word of God is this and this is how it's happening this is what is happening front page news and you go well okay yeah and you start to live and then you start to identify with them you start to react and act and conduct yourself according to the front page news amen if there's an earthquake on the front page you're going to prepare for an earthquake but I'm telling you now that the appearing of the Lord is here and and he's appearing inside you do you know Peter says that one day you know light won't and the dawning of the day you know and they're dawning day or I'll read it to Peter 2nd Peter 1 second peter 1:16 this for we have not followed cunningly devised fables now fable is like it can be a story that's you know you know that that real kind of nice preaching that you're here and that makes you feel real good but it's just a story they've just told you a story about some guy and you get a nice fluffy feeling but there's no real substance there's no real prophecy inside there there's not that's not the Word of God well that's very rampant around that's very common you know and motivational speakers and that they use fables people that go people that are called to the ministry and go preach and learn how to preach in some theological school they just they they'll tell you all these fables and things because there's no real prophetic element inside them that's expressing the pinpointing where you are where are you in the Bible where is it happening what's the front page of God's news because that's the news you really need to know because then you will conduct yourself according to your spiritual habitation so here we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but what I witnesses of His Majesty for he received from God the Father honor and glory where they came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with them in the holy mount we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shines in a dark place until see the light of God started shining the gospel went out and it keeps shining and dark shining in this dark world shining in your dark world shining in the darkness and here shining shining shining shining until the day dawns and the day star arise in your heart that doesn't happen until the days about the door it doesn't happen until the new day is about to come open and that is in this day because we Trent we are in a convergence of dimensions we are in a convergence where time and eternity is blending and we're going to go into eternity we're actually in that face of of existence now this is why everything is happening the way it is that's why there's soddom conditions out there that's why it's become the way it is because prophecy said it would that's why it's there this is why Jesus described the world we live in now as exactly like it wasn't Sodom in the moral the same thing as the same condition as my knowledge has increased the times that about and Dan who everything is here the prophecies is here the Pope was taking his preeminent position he's loved by the world even the Muslims and all of that are starting to love him he's actually going to solve some problems and he will become the savior of the society whether it's this one or the next one or whatever he will and its gearing that way it's been gearing that way since Vatican 2 in 1964 when the Pope finally left and went to Jerusalem with Rome and we visited Jerusalem and there was the total eclipse and it showed the seven Church ages of the Moon and they brother branham preached the seven church ages then in the revelation chapter five sermon that he preached he's sharing these things and the Holy Ghost came down into the room and shown the very images on they had a predictor of 1964 and it was a divine projector amen so you see the technology was already there hallelujah God vindicated that his prophet was telling the truth and here was a total eclipse because the Pope was wanting to go to Jerusalem and he did now that Vatican 2 started the dialogue between Rome and the world to actually income in us and come together and form the image and form the mark of the beast and form all those things together to control a one-world government yep that's right but in the same time and this darkness all the darkness is here light ash on and the day is dawning and we're dawning into a new day now there is a new day and it's happening inside here because you've received an Angels miss hallelujah you are Mary hello Mary Lou I'm gonna get back to my notes now I want to give the spanish-speaking brothers we read this motto when Christ who has a life I'll read it now when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall we also appear with him in glory see there's an appearing to be for there to be an appearing because it's Sun and Moon its reflection amen mortify therefore your members this flesh which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness and ordinance affection evil concupiscence and covetousness which is idolatry now you only multiply those things by the Holy Ghost by the Spirit of God it's in Romans 8 for which things sake the wrath of God come upon the children of disobedience in the which he also walked sometime when you lived in them 1 John 3:2 beloved now we are the sons of God now not we shall be now we are the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is hallelujah and she was so happy that and so glad that he would reveal himself like this we are sitting under four gospel truth all the time it's this is this is Jesus he's saying Here I am I'm appearing to you so you can see me and carry yourself with an excellent spirit Daniel carried himself he was a prophet he carried himself with an excellent spirit in the midst of Babylon we are in Mystery Babylon carry yourself with an excellent spirit and I know and regarding thoughts you know your spirit your your subconscious and all the thoughts and everything what's going on take control of it Solomon says he says mister actually proverbs 25 28 he that has no rule over his own spirit as like a city that is broken down and without walls you have to take control of your thought life you're called to take control of your thought life because you are a free moral agent you have a free will you choose what thoughts are might know to think on what am I going to think about what am I going to entertain what am I going to allow in here and in here and what am I going to allow out of here God gives us the temperance to make the right decisions but our decisions should be based on righteousness and not on selfishness not on the preservation of our own interests because eternal life is living for others but you shouldn't consciously icon Allah for others today I've got to look for others you know it should just be flowing out of your belly like the rivers of living water you understand you out flow fountain beautiful and every men one John 3:3 and every man that has this sari and every man that has this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure you know this was a as hope as as an anticipation was a pleasure its anticipation with pleasure Bible hope is different from human hope human hope is like can I hope I won the lotto but Bible hope is different but I will hope is based on a promise and you you've got an anticipation and some pleasure you're waiting on him in one day the faith comes and he reveals it to you faith is the substance of things anticipated hopeful they would hope is anticipation with please and faith has given to you that you see your approach as an approach of anticipation with pleasure you approach the promises with please don't goddess you better prove it to me or I all you just sit there in light because it hasn't happened you don't feel anything you just unbelief you just let the devil you just start entertaining the devil's thoughts real it's not real look look at that look at this look at everybody else look it even got that just cast all that stuff down you know all that is is to dissuade you to distract you from hoping real hope Bible hope because those promises are sure and stedfast approach them with hope approach them with faith but approach them with anticipation with pleasure because when I say hope I'm not talking about human hope I'm talking about real anticipation which is a human faith that's a it's an expression of belief I believe that and then one day the revelation comes it could come straightaway the moment you pray sometimes it's just there and you have it and you believe it in a manifest instantly and it's a miraculous event takes place I've seen it we've seen there actually I want to share a little testimony so brother Malcolm some amazing testimony actually so he was about he's just preparing and rather Andrew Donaldson was going to preach up there and he brother Malcolm was just giving his dialogue at the start and he was about to welcome him up to preach and then sister ray I don't actually know who she is but I was telling me about it she died she just keeled over and the seat and died and no poles have gone we're cold and the congregation was starting to get a bit but like worried and brother Malcolm says stop no no let's just pray and it's just sing so they started singing and they praying and he waited for the atmosphere then he prayed for her and she raised up from the deep and she raised up and God gave her life bang and she walked they called the ambulance anyway to check her out and she walked up to the emmalin's after being dead energy for some minute so see God still raises the dead he's still the same yesterday today and forever amen and and and they've been preaching about these things preaching about the inheritance we have thus inheritance we had the spoken word and it's and it's a mature form it's just small but it will come into full manifestations Alleluia when the pressure comes on so praise the Lord amen in the Webster dictionary the definition of identity I thought this was quite actually it was actually quite good I like this is for different pacifists and it says here the distinguishing character of a personality or an individual of an individual individuality the relation established by psychological identification what you think on what do you identify for within here do you identify with that I'm a son of God and that I believe and that Jesus Christ is good to me and I love them and he's kind to me and he keeps his word and you're worshipping Him and you adoring him in your thinking on what he's showing you in the scriptures what are you identified with psychological identification so there is a psychological element to this the condition of being the same with something described or asserted so you see well I think I like having that condition it's one condition that I like being the same of what the preachers preaching to me Amen what that preachers preaching I am there Amen I thought that's really good I enjoyed that ah and I find that myself thinking man a lot when I'm hearing the preaching you know and I'm sitting there listening I'm like yes that's me I know that I believe that I can identify with that and I do identify with that and I opened the gate of joy in my life you know when you enjoy something you really are leading that and an effect thing has rooted in hell you're letting hell if you're enjoying it you know something's you know and I'm glad that it's like that because I don't enjoy the music in the mall I hate it if i sat there and started enjoying that that spirit of that lust or that rock star or that pop star which was absolute junk man that stuff is just so it just makes me tired like I get tired you own the whole time in the mall hey I'm like going man what's up with this place it makes me tired it's just must be just subconsciously stressful anyway I'm sitting in the arm so tired and this music player I think you've met I do not enjoy this but I know and I've studied this out that when you enjoy something when you actually open up to it and you enjoy it it really keep becomes part of you you know that when you sit there and you really an impressive it's like you open up the aperture of your heart and you just let it go shine that image like on the on a camera burns that oh that's right unto you sizzling hot fire the spirit behind it now spirit behind it so don't you be careful what you enjoy amen careful what you open your aperture sorry if you're not a photographer the apertures like the shutter on the camera the measurement of the shutter or something but anyway it's a thing that opens up and it instantly goes it and it just impresses the image of the light just touches it now your eyes you know it's like the epitome and they open they dilate you know when you're in the dark and it's just this type you know when you're in the dark and your eyes wide open it makes you more open and susceptible to demonic health that's why the demons love darkness that's why all the people go out at night to night clubs because it's where the demons starts are really role that's why there's so much trouble this fights this anger is hatred because when people get drunk they open up an aperture for Satan to start operating through them I remember when I was on that stuff and if I had vodka mana life I didn't even know what happened the whole night was gone blackout and I'd get told the stories in the morning and then demon took over my life completely and the stuff that I did was you wouldn't want to know honestly I don't even know I get told it but I don't even it's just crazy stuff because of you're opening yourself up and that's one that's world opens up to - be careful what you enjoy sameness of essential or generic character in different instances but this is the one I really like - it's one here sameness and all the sudden out the definition of identity sameness in all their constitutes the objective there is the practical the really just the the objective reality of a thing so the sameness and all that constitutes the objective reality of a thing oneness Alleluia that's my identity oneness I want this is my I want and I am hallelujah one with him that we have been made one not Shelby we are one because the blood was sufficient the blood paid at all the the weight of the Holy of Holies was open the veil was ripped now we know a religious spirit and come and try and sew that back up and give you a seven steps to approach it but it's really you just walk home me how I loo you you open up now you see I see don't open your aperture to those things you know I want you to open your aperture to Jesus Christ you do that approach him with that way approach him of joy I walk into his gates with Thanksgiving in his heart I will enter his courts with praise this is in Psalm 16:11 you will Lord you will show me the path of life in your presence is fullness of joy and at thy right hand there are pleasures or open the aperture of your heart I've been a writer and let me image that as being ministered to you and press you and enjoy it sit there and enjoy the word and let it brand the very image of the Son of God in you and see what happens see why down the walls let go of those other thoughts that you're thinking about all those things that's going on there train lay it down and let those thoughts come in and let your heart continually worship let it continually flow praise now I know that's not a that's the that's ideology now it's idealism should I say there is an ideal idyllic condition and we want that and we all want that I'm just reminding you I'm just reminding you that this is important and I believe it's more important now than ever before because we are approaching the the very convergence of dimensions sorry for the big words we are approaching the very translation hallelujah we're all of these things and everything is just for coming it's just this world is boring it's boring it's got no life in it all the life being sucked out it's suffered entropy it's suffered all of the condition that if it was is just being absorbed and you are absorbing the order you're absorbing the very condition of order because he's bringing their image into his church he's bringing that order into his bride so all the order that there is left because there's their energy now holds things into order energy holds things into a substance now all that energy that ever was is already there and it doesn't deplete it doesn't the energy in general and the earth it's as any created in the beginning when you see like create the work work of energy I create this work and it's there and it will work and it will go around and systems and go from one thing to the next but energy is that it's just there you are sucking up all the spiritual energy that this world has because you are coming into the perfect order of the bride you are coming into the perfect order of God's masterpiece hallelujah all the order that they could be is coming into you you are causing all of the stuff to go on because you're fulfilling scripture not by trying to it just happening because season this is the season where his wife will be manifesting this is the season where she would shine like them hallelujah not because you're any better than anyone else just because you are who you are amen has grace do not struggle it says you know only thing you can do is take up your sword and cut down those other thoughts and just start small Lord I want to think about just ask him this is as simple as asking him to help you know because sometimes and I think about it myself I've got businesses to run I've got people and this and that and kill children everything so there's all these thoughts always going on and responsibilities and stuff happening and negative things that make me angry and whatever it may be all that stuff happening but lord I ask let my heart worship through it'll let me help me Jesus to stay in an attitude of worship oh my imaginary wouldn't that be great every here just in that atmosphere I just need to read these things they I have to read the stuff because I don't want to I don't want to deprive you of what is in here because there's such good quotes in scriptures and I just want to let the Lord's word speak so as I read these things you just absorb it enjoy it I'm going to now just hit that the section about the paths of four because the the paths that you are led down a four part who knows who's been down a footpath before you know you go right down on those things and up and out left and right and then you think yourself right back into you the room who you're and then you go mad I'm in this room I don't know if you do that but I do that more so when I was a child but I'd still do that sometimes ever ever does everyone understand what I mean it's quite freaky actually you know you think yourself right down and you're going off and all of a sudden you're thinking about the room that you're in and you're in it and you're like wow just bite out of it it's like coming into a vision or something you know know as a man thinketh eat they are not the bread of him that has an evil eye neither desire thou his dainty meats for as he thinks in his heart so as he thinks in his heart so is he you are no higher than your thoughts really hallelujah and this is how the enemy can hinder your life this is the only way he can do it because Calvary brokers back I love saying that I love saying that Satan's that defeated being that he has no power and all his chains are made out of burger rings hallelujah they're nothing they're just a lie he can lie a chain over you but it's really a lie he doesn't have any power all the only way he can get you as by a lie the strength of his hold on you as a lie hallelujah it makes me feel so good to say that hallelujah he is an absolute defeated being writhing on the ground broken back can't even walk but he shouts from there ain't chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter and to him and he's been doing that for thousands of years and he knows how humans work very well and he's been engineering societies but even though in the book of Revelation and revelation 9 it says that you know around the time of the Second World War first and second world war that were just around that time man really stepped off the tree of life in a general sense and started eating from the tree of knowledge that's why there's the technological advancement and here comes the smokers is what does it say that an angel fell from heaven a star fell from heaven I'm at the end of my sermon now so he's an a fifth angel sounded revelation 9:1 and two and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit and I believe that key was the technological advancement to enable this so that the world could be controlled by media but anyway and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit and this as the smoke of a great furnace and the Sun and the air was darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit now when we read the book of Revelation it's symbolic now the Sun is actually the Word of God the truth and the air is the Holy Ghost is the atmosphere it's the heavenly dimension that's our spiritual habitat where where men salute and that habitat has ministered to you by anointed preacher and you catch that in your identify love that psychologically and it comes down into here becomes a revelation to you and God renders a three-dimensional a seven dimensional image in your life you know it's seven dimensions it's not just for three maybe it's seven and that seven dimensional image in your life is given to you by revelation of the Father and it reveals but you have to hear it and then so that smoke rose up and it just clouds everybody and clouds everything in cloud society clear blocks out the Sun and you see after the first and second world wars look what how society is degraded so insanely degraded absolutely demolished morale morally morally demolished you know these things that are better and these things that are far worse the things that are better a pale in comparison to the things that it was that were good morally so there is a degradation that's happened in society and as a result of this the smoke came out of the pit thank God hallelujah now we're going back to the appearing again because when that happened and all of this world and any church that became part of the world system any church that's governed by a hierarchy of men there's part of the world system because the the general consensus is to follow the times to follow the fashions to be led by the image of the Beast to be led by the image of the beast to be which is the Gentile world power which is Rome which is America which is the conglomerate of leadership in the earth that is basically the Beast and so what you have there is any world system that is led by their it comes under that and it's completely influenced by that and it's under that smoke now about god richard mercy hallelujah he appeared to his elect he appears to his he appears to his church and to anybody he says behold I stand at the door and knock was he knocking on he's knocking on the door of the church he's knocking on the door of Babylon he's knocking on the door of your prime he's knocking on the door of your culture he's knocking on the door of all of who you think you are personal the appearing of Jesus Christ knocking hallelujah and he's saying if any man will hear my voice and open and I was what is he gonna give you no Bible up here is there hallelujah six thousand years that was sealed with seven seals and then he said that the entire according to Daniel and according to many other prophecies he says at the end time I will appear and I'll give it to you the full image of Christ your inheritance if you eat this you'll live forever Ignis you'll be raptured and the whole world was full of smoke and all the societies and all of any world system anything was controlled by man would come under there fish come under Hollywood's all of those influences and powers and slavery let's smoke everywhere all that people can see now you think about that when you're immersed in something fully immersed full immersion if you look that way it's there you look that way that way is spherically surrounding you the world is spherically surrounded by smoke spiritual smoke that blocks out their vision of the Sun and the completely blocked but here comes I'll read it revelation 10:1 and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven hallelujah a man had clothed with a rate cloud and I'll do here who knows I'm gonna talk about the cloud in a minute I'll talk about the cloud because he's close with a cloud hallelujah amen this is our God this is front-page news and a rainbow was upon his head hallelujah the whole rainbow and his face was as it were the Sun now we read before about how the moon would shine like the brightness of the Sun areas this is his face here is front-page news and his feet as pillars of fire hallelujah so we've seen a pillar of fire we've seen a cloud hallelujah amen and I'll read these things in a minute because otherwise it just sounds strange but we have seen these things and this is reality this is front-page news this is your habitat when you can identify what is happening prophetically this you can be living it do you want to know what you can live him here he is nothing on the door of stoked man he's knocking on the door of the rest Church he's nothing on the door of that stone church ever these nothing on the other son aren't you you're knocking on the door of the community hub of any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in and I will sup with him and he with me I will give him this and he will eat it open book now it's been fully revealed he can eat that and I'll give him wine the wine of the revelation of the word and he can drink that wine and it's going to change the way he thinks hallelujah people drink wine in the earth and it starts to open them up and they start to talk the truth amen they start to say what they really think hey they're different they get all happy and they get lightheaded and depends on how much they take them like in a bit loose and they might start dancing and they're doing things that they normally wouldn't do how old are you now that's the same thing was godswife his spiritual revealed truth when he reveals something to you you've become inebriated you become delighted because he's come to you the it's more the fact that he came to you than anything it's more the fact that you that the very creator is came into your prayer room who came into your dishwashing catch it the Creator just made time for you hallelujah that's very special I get inebriated when their heavens and then the wine on top of that and he reveals something and something goes click that is just amazing and I you know I start dancing and I start doing things that I haven't done before hallelujah well I always do things I think I just get a good dose of wine you know and you can drink as much as you like spiritual wine yeah amen we might confuse this now ok spiritual wine drinking as much as you like just keep drinking until you are inebriated hallelujah and you will get if you open the aperture just open it right up hallelujah and just put them on open now don't actually because you need to discern other stuff but when you're in church when you are in some way where you can trust and you you know the words coming or your in your prayer time or your in a Bible study open the aperture let it open and enjoy it because that's that joy the joy of the Lord is my strength strengthened by the revelation of the word I'm going to let that word I'm going to let it just permeate me that's what eating the Bacchus let permeate every fiber of your being every essence of your spirit every part of who you were and will be as that eternal word because you were part of the I am hallelu is that Philippians 4:8 finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these we've done it 2 Corinthians 10 water 6 CC for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds this is and this is something that you have to do you have power mighty through God is not your strength now but he gave you he invested some power unto you he gave you authority in the name of Jesus Christ cast down the enemy cast down those thoughts this rhythm casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought man when I first read that and I'm sure many people hear that they think I'm like goodness that's too much and then I started us honestly but you say lord please help me I went up from prayer many times at the start of my walk with the Lord because I had so much bad thoughts going off because of my past very very bad and they were always plaguing me when I was trying to pray or just even just entering in and waiting on the Lord it was just like this barrage you actually have to you want to be a diligent gardener so that only good plants are growing in your life the real identification you have to actually start gardening your mind your thoughts and God will help you until it becomes like when you drive you drive at the start and you're all worried and you're shaking and you're moving everything and you're like aw it's so hard to drive because you're thinking here but after a while you just drive and you don't even think because it's been registered within your subconscious the same thing happens with your force you become subconsciously autonomous with your thought life with discerning thoughts it just becomes naturally naturally every thought becomes it'll be arrested and the one center of the Lord will be you will you'll enjoy and you will meditate on those and the ones that are of the of the devil and thoughts that are just negative it cast it out you actually the ability the authority to take that thought that entity and literally take it out of your mind and cast it away it's a spirit it's a spirit this is where the world of psychology doesn't they lose that they they stop their understanding here this is where they can't explain it they've got that goes beyond sir natural explanation where a thought comes from is right there because they don't accept spirit they don't accept demonic power or heavenly power they don't accept that so they can't explain it they don't know I know writing one thought from a psychological perspective for a while and yeah I can see you know because you read their things their essays and things some of the stuff you know it's very abstract and like it just you know that they're just clutching at stuff that there's because this is the problem with science as they they are denying the very foundation of all things but then scientists that can actually do an unbiased way take scientific discovery and take the Bible and join them together because God is the Creator God is the genesis of all things and when you can see that you'll see that it actually all makes sense and everything clicks together perfectly but then you get by us on both sides you get creationists that are anti science and they lose their balance and then you get scientists that are anti God and they lose their balance but when you get a scientist that can actually join the two together in harmony because science is just the discovery of God's creation when you see there and there's no bias it's just balanced you have a scientist that's got the ability to discover and measure and they can measure it by the foundation of what it really is and there's the same thing with your thinking you need to measure you need to become a scientist of your mind of your thoughts of whatever comes into you so and having an ax readiness now I'm casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into kept every thought to the obedience of Christ and having Anna readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled Colossians 3:1 if ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God set your affection on things above not on things on the earth set your affection your affections what you enjoy what you like we need to get into the four-year did in your life is hid with Christ and God Psalm 16 verse 8 I have set the Lord always before me because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved Psalm 101 3 sorry we're moving through this but I'm sure you can absorb these things I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes I hate the work of them that turn aside it shall not cleave to me it doesn't say I hate their workers the work the energy that they put into what they put into that's causing destruction and taking people from God and removing faith out of the human life I hate that work that is that produces death now just want to read this quote here because I thought this was actually this was in the family altar but I'm so impressed by it I want to read it and it was really the inspiration while part of the inspiration of the subject sit here missus from Jehovah of miracles in 1959 that says oh it's too bad that the church today doesn't walk in the spirit like that more than we do for us that kind of a time that when God comes to you you know it was on the road to Emmaus Winkley opus and his friend was speaking and talking and thinking about Jesus and thinking about Jesus that he walked out of the bushes by the side of them and walked with them it's while we are thinking upon him the trouble of the world today we are thinking about everything else but him then we wonder why we don't get blessings do wonder that sometimes why is my life plain why don't I see those things what's it not why doesn't it happen to me what do you think where are your thoughts always you know what does the worship coming from God is there a connection pray without ceasing that doesn't mean going around reciting prayers that is an attitude of your life let that become autonomous you're always thinking about him it was just a few weeks ago about three weeks ago when I sit down by some sycamore trees and I as I was telling you and begin to think it was there for the first time that he came into cleared the new ministry to me think on him draw nigh unto me and I'll draw nigh unto you saith the Lord think upon him David spake that he was right his Commandments on the bedpost and meditate on them day and night that's what the church ought to do would keep your heart tuned in with God day and night for it's then when he appears now Louie Solomon said as a man thinketh in his heart so does he begin to think that you're one of us child children that he saved you that is good to you and that you love him and he loves you don't just wait till you go to church or some convenient hour just keep him on your mind all the time all the time every day keep him on your mind and I believe that this is a the Lord is saying these things this is carrot now he wants us to think on him he wants our mind to worship Him we we again we get caught up in busyness we get caught up in all these things but let's think on him more and as she went and as she went I'm walking down the street it was one no one yet on the street and as she walked along the dirt path recital all of a sudden she began to realize there was something around her she's talking about me Reena sorry I must have deleted yeah this is actually talking about Mary now as a real strange feeling oh that's the most wonderful experience I trust that everybody here has experienced them kind of at times if you haven't this would be a good night to start and I say this will be a good day it's not just start thinking on him it's not worshiping him let the expression of your life give thanks to don't be condemned in your own babies you know that kind of self condemnation can pull you right out of worship that makes you feel like you're not worthy to worship that's blood made you worthy to worship it's not about how worthy you are or your behavior that's already painful amen you can just enjoy even if you feel like we haven't prayed enough just pray a little bit just enjoy you have worship hallelujah oh that most wonderful experience I trust that everybody here has experienced them kind of at times if you haven't this would be a good night to start just start thinking about him and worship him in your heart and all of a sudden you'll feel the close fellowship of the holy spirit around you all around you and it gets so anointed until you can't hold it any longer you'll raise up your hands and you'll do something you just can't stand still when it comes a man hallelujah and as she was thinking not noticing who was around here the little lady perhaps a pair of sandals on her feet walking along this little dusty path but thinking of the Lord and of his promises and all things to come amen and as she was thinking all of a sudden that feeling got so great around her until she just raised up her head and when she did standing before who was alive and standing by that light was Gabriel the angel the angel of God if you want angels to appear to keep your mind on God and all the things if you you you know not not just the profit or someone with a big ministry but you if you want angels to live and you keep your mind on go amen angels are Pierce of children - yes amen he's not subject to age it's about your approach Amen hallelujah if you want angels to appear to you keep your mind on God and off the things of the world go about your business go to your church go to your go to your washing of dishes wherever you are keep your mind on him all day and all night long then God will do something you're drawing close to him you've got the world shut out just you and he together rise up above self-condemnation rise up above what you think about yourself what you've judged yourself to be under your own experience that doesn't actually really matter in the grand scheme of things because God has seen an image of you God has seen who you really are God has seen you perfect and he is developing you worship think about what he's going what's going to happen let your imagination start to roll on the things of God hallelujah you are eternal you shouted with the sons of God you sing together with the morning stars hallelujah you come from God you're going back to you are made in his very image and likeness if I can have the musicians please and we'll play ones of faith [Music] this happened in 1963 and February 28 this is the exit from the Life magazine and I'll read the scripture here it says annex to serpentina season it shall come to pass then the last days saith god I will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servant and my man hand mates I will pour out of my spirit in those days and they shall prophesy and I will show wonders in the heavens above and science and the earth beneath blood in fire and vapor of smoke this cloud formed when brother Branham was commissioned to write to go and preach the opening of the seven seals and seven angels came to him and commissioned him and then we made the partnered when they run lifted back up into the sky they formed this cloud and the cloud was seen this is here the Sun shall be turned into darkness a blood before the great notable day of the Lord I hear revelation 1:7 behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him now if you actually read if you see what happened on that that will be all around America they went all over the world [Music] they couldn't explain they which pierced him and all Kindred's of the earth shall wail because of them even so amen next one - is that when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up you turn the cloud over to the right and actually as Christ the supreme white would ducky returning back to the earth a heaven on February 28th 1963 and this was the appearance of Christ and when those seals was preached the seven seals was open the book became open and revealed the truth fullness of Christ so that he could be preached has been 50 years since then and the end the ministry has fought there and developed and preaching these things and the church has caught it and the very life it was in the word has now become flesh in you and this was just a sign in the heavens that Christ he would come back what was he coming back to bring them out of Babylon to say come out of her my people come out of her come out of denominationalism come out of your own thinking come out of Babylon coming out of the culture of New Zealand come out of the culture of America and come out of the culture of Holland come out of the culture of your own ideologies come out of the culture of education that programming programming communes come out come out because the supreme judge the supreme judge and the formulas word to preach to you to minister to you an entrance into the everlasting kingdom of Jesus Christ here he is Alleluia this is one of the science and the evidence that he promised and it says here annex 1 verse 9 ER when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him and out of the out of this site X 110 and while they looked steadfastly towards heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said you men of Galilee why are you standing up gazing into the heaven this same Jesus which has taken up from you into heaven shall so come and light same way he went the same way the high priest himself Jesus Christ went up into the Holy of Holies and inflict his blood on the mercy seat for seven times showing seven making the atonement interceding for the people and then once those the blood was flicked on the mercy seat seven times he wouldn't come back up and the Jubilee trauma would sound freedom from all of man's ideas freedom from all of babylons thoughts freedom from Roman Catholicism freedom from all liberal Christian freedom from lives freedom from complexes freedom from anything that would hinder your world freedom from politics freedom from anything with us shaky standing Foundation and liberation and restoration of the true image of the Son of God [Music] why because the very son calling us calling you out this is front page news this

wondered what this was because this cloud was just too high it wasn't even a normal cloud they couldn't describe it they couldn't make sentiment now when bit on the other side of that page as a moonbeam rainbow that they took because they were amazed it was how this rainbow the moon had shone so bright and there was rain coming down and the the the light refracted through the rain of the
