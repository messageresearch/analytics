[49:20] Joshua chapter 14 just a couple of
[49:22] places to read uh he says now this is
[49:25] this is the Apostle Paul as we know in
[49:27] the book of Hebrews he's contrasting to
[49:28] the Hebrews the difference between the
[49:30] blood of bulls and goats and the blood
[49:31] of Jesus Christ the the um you know the
[49:34] high priest the natural uh you know you
[49:36] know the high priest and the Levites
[49:38] different things so the high priest of
[49:39] our Lord Jesus Christ he's contrasting
[49:41] many different things and he comes down
[49:43] to this place and he's contrasting now
[49:45] Mount um um SI where the law was given
[49:48] to Mount Zion he says for you have not
[49:51] come unto the mountain that might be
[49:52] touched uh that burned with fire nor
[49:55] unto blackness and darkness and Tempest
[49:58] and the sound of a trumpet and the voice
[50:00] of Words which words uh they that heard
[50:03] entreated that the word should not be
[50:04] spoken to them anymore for they could
[50:06] not endure that which was commanded and
[50:09] if so much as a beast touched the
[50:10] mountain it should be stoned or thrust
[50:13] through with a dart and so terrible was
[50:15] the sight that Moses said I exceedingly
[50:17] fear and Quake but you have come unto
[50:20] Mount Zion unto the city of the Living
[50:22] God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an
[50:24] innumerable company of angels to the
[50:27] general assembly and Church of the
[50:29] firstborn which are written in heaven
[50:31] and to the judge of all and to the
[50:33] spirits of just men made perfect and to
[50:36] Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant
[50:38] and to the blood of sprinkling that
[50:40] speaketh better things than that of Abel
[50:43] amen then we're going to go to
[50:45] Joshua uh chapter chapter 14 sorry it's
[50:49] got a few more verses here to read trust
[50:51] you don't mind standing for a bit but
[50:52] want to take this as a context here uh
[50:55] this is Joshua he's speaking to to he's
[50:57] speaking to um sorry this Caleb speaking
[51:00] to Joshua about he wants his possession
[51:02] now he says then the children of Judah
[51:04] came unto Joshua and gilgal and Caleb
[51:07] the son of of Jeffy the kenite said unto
[51:11] him thou knowest the thing that the Lord
[51:13] said unto Moses the man of God
[51:15] concerning me and the in Kadesh Baria 40
[51:18] years old was was I when Moses the
[51:20] servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh
[51:22] Baria to spy out the land and I have
[51:24] brought him word again what was in my
[51:26] heart nevertheless my brethren that went
[51:29] up with me made the heart of the people
[51:31] melt but I holy followed the Lord thy
[51:34] God and Moses swear on that day saying
[51:37] surely the land where uh whereon thy
[51:39] feet have trodden shall be thine
[51:41] inheritance and thy children's forever
[51:43] because thou Hast wholly followed the
[51:46] Lord thy God how did he follow the L
[51:48] holy followed the Lord he believed that
[51:50] God was able to do that which he has
[51:52] promised to do he was fully convinced
[51:54] God's going to give it to us amen now
[51:56] behold the Lord ha kept me alive as he
[51:59] said these 45 years even since the Lord
[52:02] spake this word unto Moses while the
[52:05] children of Israel wandered in the
[52:06] wilderness and now lo I am this day 4
[52:09] score and5 years old as yet I am as
[52:13] strong this day as I was in the day that
[52:15] Moses sent me as my strength was then
[52:18] even so my strength now for war both to
[52:21] go out and to come in now therefore give
[52:23] me this mountain where of the Lord spake
[52:26] and that day uh for thou heardest in
[52:29] that day how the Anakin were there and
[52:31] that the cities were great and fenced if
[52:33] so be the Lord will be with me then I'll
[52:36] be able to drive them out as the Lord
[52:38] said and Joshua blessed him and gave um
[52:41] Caleb the son of jeffn that's how he
[52:44] said Hebron for an inheritance and
[52:46] Hebron therefore became the inheritance
[52:48] of Caleb the son of jeffa the K kenite
[52:51] unto this day because he wholly followed
[52:54] the Lord God of Israel amen
[52:57] amen may the Lord bless the reading of
[52:58] his word you may have your seats uh this
[53:00] morning and um I just want to I just
[53:03] want to take a few moments to speak on
[53:06] taking our mountain now I would now
[53:09] before I speak about these things I just
[53:11] want you to understand that we are we
[53:13] are ordained to take this Resurrection
[53:16] Mountain that's what I want to call it
[53:17] this Mount Zion is a resurrection
[53:20] Mountain where there will be a people
[53:22] that will Ascend the top of this
[53:23] mountain and they will take a body
[53:24] change now before I speak about these
[53:27] things I want you to know from the
[53:28] get-go there is a people predestinated
[53:31] to stand on the top of this mountain to
[53:33] take the summit of this mountain to to
[53:36] to to possess it to enjoy it and then
[53:38] their bodies would be changed okay so I
[53:40] I I just want to put that before you
[53:41] before I start because it may sound like
[53:43] oh can we do it will we take it will we
[53:45] stay there we will but the enemy wants
[53:48] to drive us off this mountain he does
[53:50] not want us to possess the promise I
[53:52] mean he does not want the bride to be
[53:54] raptured he wants us to to be trapped
[53:56] there because he always wants to hinder
[53:59] God's Plan of Redemption he he's been
[54:01] fighting it from Heaven he's been
[54:02] fighting it all the way down through
[54:04] time he will always he's always there to
[54:07] hinder God's plan right so I just want
[54:09] to read this from Christ The Mystery of
[54:10] God revealed denomination won't never
[54:12] touch that it's a revelation she knows
[54:15] it so did Eve not but she fell but this
[54:17] one knows it and won't fall speaking
[54:19] about the second evil the bride at the
[54:21] end time she won't fall amen she knows
[54:24] it and won't fall she has ordained her
[54:26] Hallelujah few she is ordained not to
[54:28] fall she won't fail she's predestinated
[54:31] to it amen so there's are people that
[54:33] are predestinated to stand on that
[54:35] mountain amen so now I was I was um a
[54:39] couple of weeks ago I was with I was
[54:41] with um brother Daniel sister chery
[54:44] white I took them through the galy uh
[54:46] exhibition there in tapa I thought it
[54:47] would mean something to them being well
[54:49] she's actually a kiwi and he's an
[54:50] Australian and this may not mean a lot
[54:52] to a lot of us because we're not raised
[54:54] from this country but you in World War I
[54:57] the you know the um the uh Western
[54:59] Powers decided they would invade a
[55:02] peninsula right by Istanbul called
[55:04] galipoli and they would they would
[55:06] effectively take this peninsula they
[55:08] march on Istanbul and they and the
[55:10] purpose of this is they would drive the
[55:11] ottoman Turk Empire out of the war and
[55:14] so they they they gathered uh New
[55:16] Zealand troops they gathered Australian
[55:18] troops they gathered French and British
[55:20] different ones and they landed them on
[55:22] this peninsula and now to me this was
[55:24] like the church where where if you look
[55:26] at uh uh this is this is the gpoy Cove
[55:29] or the Anzac Cove and you see it's very
[55:31] steep terrain and the first objective of
[55:34] the war was to take this uh a summit
[55:36] called chanik bear and if they could
[55:38] take that High Ground they could take
[55:39] the whole Peninsula and so it was a very
[55:43] difficult campaign you could see they
[55:44] were landed on the wrong spot they were
[55:47] they had to fight their way up these
[55:48] Hills like this they had to dig
[55:49] themselves in and they they eventually
[55:52] reached the summit of chanuk beer but
[55:54] they could only keep it for a couple of
[55:55] days where the because they outnumbered
[55:58] by the Turks there'll just be Mass waves
[56:00] of attacks and even even there' be
[56:02] friendly artillery fire would actually
[56:04] from the British warships or the British
[56:06] guns would actually hit the new
[56:07] zealanders on the top and it came to a
[56:10] point where they stood on the
[56:12] mountain now take this in the spiritual
[56:16] they stood on the peak they held the
[56:19] peak but they couldn't keep the peak and
[56:22] the church after the day of Pentecost
[56:24] stood on the top of the mountain
[56:26] the church could have been raptured it
[56:30] was in condition now it was ordained we
[56:32] know to go down through the Dark Ages
[56:34] that they would come AB bride at the end
[56:36] time it was ordained that way but they
[56:38] stood on the summit but then the enemy
[56:41] came in and drove them down to the down
[56:43] to the bottom of the
[56:45] mountain just like the Turks drove now
[56:47] this ended in a bitter defeat where
[56:50] where it was a now we know all war is a
[56:52] waste of life but they didn't they did
[56:55] not achieve their goal they they were
[56:57] driven off they were you know you know
[56:59] they couldn't hold the summit they
[57:01] couldn't retake it and there just a bit
[57:03] of failure of a of a campaign and we
[57:06] know that you know the church would
[57:07] eventually after Pentecost the the
[57:09] Antichrist Spirit would come in what
[57:11] would the the purpose of the enemy
[57:13] coming in is to drive the people off the
[57:15] summit to drive them off a resurrection
[57:18] Peak and that's why you know it's so
[57:20] important that we discern and withstand
[57:23] the Antichrist spirit cuz remember we're
[57:25] ordained to take the it and not just
[57:27] take it but to dwell on it right but
[57:29] that doesn't mean the enemy is going to
[57:30] not try and drive us off and push us
[57:32] back down and separate us and divide us
[57:34] from the word and divide us from the
[57:36] moving of the Holy Ghost and so they
[57:40] they they they were driven off the peak
[57:41] eventually they would have to withdraw
[57:43] and the whole campaign ended in a bit of
[57:45] failure and even even when the church
[57:47] would go if you if you read through the
[57:49] church ages there come the Smur and age
[57:51] and that Smur and age that word smum
[57:53] actually means there's a Burness
[57:54] anointed to die and if you take a person
[57:56] who ever gets resentful against the word
[57:58] of God they're not anointed by life and
[58:01] because if we're anointed by the life of
[58:02] the Holy Ghost there's joy there's peace
[58:04] there's love there's a there's a there's
[58:06] a there's a Zeal amen we're going to
[58:08] possess every promise but if you begin
[58:10] to be resentful that's not life
[58:11] anointing you that's the enemy trying to
[58:13] push you off your promise so I say let's
[58:16] never be resentful let's never be bitter
[58:18] let's never be annoyed at anyone amen
[58:20] but let's let's take the
[58:22] peak amen because Luther would yes God
[58:25] would restore now now amen it was like
[58:27] as if they came back to the bottom of
[58:29] the mountain and then God would restore
[58:31] the just shall live by faith you know
[58:33] the church begin to ascend out of out of
[58:35] dark Catholicism out of dark religion
[58:39] and then and then it Ascend a bit higher
[58:40] under under Wesley with with with with
[58:42] sanctification then there's a
[58:44] restoration of the gifts and then God
[58:46] would send Malachi 4 in the end time to
[58:48] restore us back to the top of the peak I
[58:51] mean back to a cycle where the church
[58:52] has come back in a cycle again to be
[58:55] Rapture Ready now all the saints down
[58:57] through the ages are going to be in the
[58:58] Rapture too I mean there's going to be
[59:00] the dead in Christ raised we're going to
[59:01] meet Luther we're going to meet
[59:02] different ones under his message meet
[59:04] ones from the Dark Ages meet those who
[59:06] gave their lives in the Coliseum we're
[59:08] going to meet them all we're going to
[59:09] have a 40 it's going to be a busy 40
[59:12] days before our bodies are changed too
[59:14] or we're caught up you know we're going
[59:15] to meet all these ones right so there's
[59:17] been the Holy Ghost has been working in
[59:19] every age but there must be a people
[59:22] come to their position come to their
[59:24] position in Christ possess the top the
[59:26] mountain amen and then the dead in
[59:28] Christ will raise so just because we're
[59:31] ordained to stand there does not mean
[59:32] the devil won't want to try and kick us
[59:35] off this is my whole thought for the
[59:37] whole this morning amen so brother
[59:39] Braham says this he knows that since so
[59:41] this is the devil here he says the devil
[59:43] knows that since God is immutable in his
[59:45] nature that he is just as immutable in
[59:47] his ways that Satan knows assuredly that
[59:50] the original church at Pentecost with
[59:52] the power of God Mark 16 and action is
[59:54] the true church that God claim as Jesus
[59:57] claims as his own all El is false it has
[1:00:00] to be now remember this Christ and the
[1:00:02] true church is a continuation of the
[1:00:04] book of Acts so Christ and the true
[1:00:06] church is a continuation of the book of
[1:00:08] Acts but the Book of Revelation shows
[1:00:10] how the Antichrist spirit will come in
[1:00:13] come into the church and defile it
[1:00:14] making it lukewarm formal and Powerless
[1:00:17] it exposes Satan revealing his Works
[1:00:20] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:00:22] and the discrediting of God's word right
[1:00:25] down to the time he's cast into the Lake
[1:00:27] of Fire he fights that he cannot stand
[1:00:31] it he knows that if the people get the
[1:00:33] true revelation of the true church and
[1:00:36] what she is and what she stands for and
[1:00:38] that she can do the greater work she
[1:00:40] will be an invincible Army if they get a
[1:00:42] true revelation of the two Spirits
[1:00:44] within the framework of the Christian
[1:00:46] church and by God's spirit discern and
[1:00:48] withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan
[1:00:51] will be powerless before her he'll be
[1:00:53] definitely uh thoughted today as when
[1:00:56] Christ with stod his every effort to
[1:00:58] gain power over him in the desert yes
[1:01:00] Satan hates Revelation but we love it
[1:01:02] with true Revelation in our lives the
[1:01:04] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us
[1:01:07] but we will prevail over
[1:01:10] them now every every Spirit that's come
[1:01:13] against the church is against you and
[1:01:16] I every spirit that came against the
[1:01:19] prophet is against you and I remember
[1:01:21] brother Braham gives a principle God
[1:01:23] takes his man but the Holy Spirit
[1:01:25] remains upon the the Earth the devil
[1:01:27] takes his man but the Antichrist spirit
[1:01:28] is still upon the Earth so Spirits don't
[1:01:31] die see everything that the that the all
[1:01:34] the Believers Through the Ages have
[1:01:35] fought against that same Spirit we are
[1:01:38] fighting against it wants to drive us
[1:01:40] off the peak it wants to drive us off
[1:01:42] this mountain amen that where we are
[1:01:45] reduced to a place where we're just
[1:01:47] lukewarm formal and Powerless amen
[1:01:50] remember we're ordained not to be
[1:01:51] lukewarm formal and Powerless but the
[1:01:53] devil wants to make us that way so we
[1:01:55] have to we're going to make a choice
[1:01:57] here are we going to be driven off the
[1:01:59] peak or we going to possess it that no
[1:02:02] matter what bombardment whatever weapon
[1:02:04] the enemy forms against us we're not we
[1:02:06] we're not moving we're not retreating
[1:02:08] we're standing our ground we're standing
[1:02:10] for the word we're standing for Unity
[1:02:12] we're standing for love we're standing
[1:02:13] for deliverance we're standing for the
[1:02:15] moving of the Holy Ghost we're standing
[1:02:17] for Joy we're standing for peace I mean
[1:02:19] we're standing for love and healing that
[1:02:21] this is what we're standing for we're
[1:02:23] not standing for malice we're not
[1:02:24] standing for division we we're not
[1:02:26] standing for trouble drama malice Strife
[1:02:29] Envy unbelief we don't stand for any of
[1:02:31] those things but we're called to push
[1:02:33] those things back in the name of Jesus
[1:02:34] Christ amen so
[1:02:37] now where it says lukewarm now lukewarm
[1:02:40] if you look in the webs of dictionary it
[1:02:41] says lukew means lacking
[1:02:43] conviction so so Satan wants to make us
[1:02:46] that we lack conviction that we don't
[1:02:48] that that that you know that there's
[1:02:50] nothing in us that actually when when
[1:02:51] God comes to correct us that we can be
[1:02:53] changed back to him you know that that
[1:02:55] that the word isn't important but this
[1:02:58] word formal if if we look from 2 Timothy
[1:03:01] 3 says having a form of godliness but
[1:03:03] denying the power of the from such turn
[1:03:06] away now this word form it means
[1:03:08] basically the thing like a mold it's a
[1:03:10] mere form it's a resemblance you know
[1:03:13] it's just it's just a shape so like if
[1:03:16] you pour concrete first you make a mold
[1:03:19] you put you build a form right then you
[1:03:21] pour the concrete in we don't just want
[1:03:22] to be the form having a form we want to
[1:03:25] be what's on the inside right so we
[1:03:27] don't just want to look the part on the
[1:03:29] outside we want to be a believer on the
[1:03:31] inside right we don't just want to have
[1:03:33] a form of a church or form of a group of
[1:03:35] people no we want to be the redeemed
[1:03:37] body of Jesus Christ I mean where God
[1:03:39] lives on the inside of every heart
[1:03:41] there's Revival flame in every life am
[1:03:43] mean the power of God moving the word
[1:03:45] manifesting himself but you see what
[1:03:47] happens is it's amazing how the voice of
[1:03:49] unbelief can be so strong and how
[1:03:52] quickly Believers will pay attention to
[1:03:53] it now we see here where because the
[1:03:56] book of Acts started when the church was
[1:03:58] completely sold out to God it was
[1:04:00] completely on fire for God and that's
[1:04:01] what brother R says we're restored to
[1:04:04] okay back to that book of Acts Church
[1:04:06] there but you see there came a time in
[1:04:08] Acts 15 where men came in who were
[1:04:12] professing to be Believers but they were
[1:04:14] trying to get people back into the old
[1:04:17] ways they were they were saying you've
[1:04:18] got to be circumcised you've got to
[1:04:20] follow you after the manner of Moses
[1:04:22] otherwise you cannot be saved and you
[1:04:24] know there was a great um dissension you
[1:04:27] here it says in verse two here when
[1:04:29] therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small
[1:04:31] dissension and disputation with them
[1:04:33] other words other words it was a big
[1:04:34] argument this wasn't a casual side
[1:04:37] conversation no no we're going to deal
[1:04:39] with this thing we're going to talk
[1:04:41] about this thing we're going to we're
[1:04:42] going to we're going to iron this thing
[1:04:43] out they had a big discussion about it
[1:04:45] but you see it's amazing how people even
[1:04:48] paid ear to this that that that even a
[1:04:50] person saying look you've got to you've
[1:04:52] got to follow what God did in the past
[1:04:54] now brother brah says that the
[1:04:56] Pentecostals were good legalists and
[1:04:58] anyone who's a legalist is living in a
[1:05:00] former
[1:05:02] age right anyone who's a legalist is
[1:05:04] actually still living in a former age
[1:05:06] now a liberal person there I don't know
[1:05:08] where they are but someone who's a
[1:05:09] genuine believer loves the Lord with all
[1:05:11] their heart and wants him to live that's
[1:05:13] why it's a heartfelt religion a
[1:05:14] heartfelt walk it's a heartfelt
[1:05:16] relationship that keeps you in the
[1:05:17] middle of the road right so but you see
[1:05:20] these people come in you've got to do
[1:05:21] this and otherwise you you can't be
[1:05:23] saved there's a big argument
[1:05:26] but you see even even in Jerusalem to me
[1:05:28] this is
[1:05:29] astounding There Rose up certain of the
[1:05:32] sect of the Pharisees which believed
[1:05:35] Saying that it was needful to circumcise
[1:05:38] them and to command them to keep the law
[1:05:40] of Moses now to me that doesn't compute
[1:05:43] how can you be a believer where the
[1:05:46] Messiah has come and then now he's
[1:05:48] poured his Spirit out the day of
[1:05:49] Pentecost the god of the Old Testament
[1:05:51] now dwells in a redeemed people and yet
[1:05:54] you're professing to be this but you're
[1:05:56] saying you've got to follow the law
[1:05:58] which they could look in their history
[1:06:00] the blood of bulls and goats miserably
[1:06:02] failed and it was meant to the law is
[1:06:05] only a policeman puts you in jail Grace
[1:06:07] gets you out right so so it's very you
[1:06:10] know to me it's astounding that there's
[1:06:12] this group oh yeah we believe in the
[1:06:14] Lord Jesus yes we're message Believers
[1:06:16] but you've got to follow the old way see
[1:06:19] it's a voice of unbelief trying to push
[1:06:21] the people off the top of the mountain
[1:06:22] this is how subtle the Devil comes in
[1:06:25] where where where he where he comes in
[1:06:27] this way to push people off the top of
[1:06:29] the mountain this is what they were
[1:06:31] trying to do here now so this Antichrist
[1:06:33] Spirit who that that came in this way
[1:06:36] desired to make the people formal
[1:06:39] lukewarm and Powerless this is what he
[1:06:41] always tries to do he tries to drag the
[1:06:44] people back into a former age we can see
[1:06:46] this when Israel left Egypt you know
[1:06:48] it's amazing the cry it's recorded so
[1:06:51] many times oh why did you bring us here
[1:06:54] to die Moses why we're in this desert
[1:06:56] look at as we heard on Wednesday all the
[1:06:57] sand and all the trouble and you know
[1:06:59] there are better graves in Egypt why did
[1:07:01] we not stay in Egypt and I I want to go
[1:07:03] back to Egypt let's make a Captain
[1:07:05] there's no real real record of we're
[1:07:07] going God's given us the
[1:07:10] land you see what I mean don't look at
[1:07:12] me like this like you got a problem on
[1:07:14] your neck you know there's a lot of
[1:07:15] people that you know that there's such a
[1:07:17] cry of unbelief they want to go back to
[1:07:19] a former age of of slavery but what did
[1:07:23] slavery do for them sure uh well it
[1:07:25] didn't do a single thing for them God
[1:07:28] wasn't even among them as slaves there
[1:07:30] was all there was was a mournful cry
[1:07:32] from their hearts God Deliver Us oh the
[1:07:35] world is so bad oh my children are going
[1:07:38] sideways oh it's so hard oh it's such a
[1:07:41] Dark Age oh this is so bad Lord when are
[1:07:43] you going to come and that was the cry
[1:07:45] they had in Egypt that was their Worship
[1:07:48] in Egypt that's all it was reduced to
[1:07:50] and you see people are the joy bells are
[1:07:52] gone put the joy Bells back on Amen
[1:07:55] we're in the Promised Land we've been
[1:07:56] given all things amen we're not here to
[1:07:58] just mourn and cry and brother R says
[1:08:00] sure we should sigh and cry for the
[1:08:02] Abominations down in the city but on the
[1:08:03] other side you should be crying with joy
[1:08:06] thank you Lord I'm part of you thank you
[1:08:08] you have redeemed me Lord thank you your
[1:08:09] word is true thank you you're not dead
[1:08:11] in the Tomb somewhere amen but you see
[1:08:14] this this unbelieving Spirit wanted to
[1:08:16] drag them back into Egypt where all they
[1:08:18] could do is cry and sigh totally totally
[1:08:22] without help or anything but yet the
[1:08:25] very God who answered them had brought
[1:08:28] them out but they wanted to go back I
[1:08:29] say let's walk with a pillar of fire
[1:08:32] amen let's not let's not listen to The
[1:08:35] Cry of
[1:08:35] unbelief amen but let us let us walk on
[1:08:39] now the reason they could not enter into
[1:08:41] the promised land is because of unbelief
[1:08:43] they had to believe the promise was
[1:08:45] theirs and they went in but that cry of
[1:08:48] unbelief of saying let's go back let's
[1:08:50] go back to a former age let's go back to
[1:08:52] how it was 50 years ago we live in a
[1:08:54] different season
[1:08:56] we live in a different season we live in
[1:08:58] a season where you know 50 years ago it
[1:09:00] was God sent a prophet God sent a
[1:09:02] prophet God sent a prophet now it's what
[1:09:04] does the word say what has he said we're
[1:09:06] here to fulfill the word the bride is
[1:09:07] here upon the scene the word has been
[1:09:09] made flesh Malachi 4 is introduced the
[1:09:11] bride to Jesus Christ the Lamb of God
[1:09:13] the word of God Amen so now it's a
[1:09:15] different season do we do away with the
[1:09:17] former season no we don't but now we'
[1:09:19] have moved on it's not Malachi 4 was not
[1:09:21] the purpose of the message in terms of
[1:09:23] the man brother brandham the purpose of
[1:09:26] his ministry was to prepare a people to
[1:09:28] meet the Lord that we would become one
[1:09:30] on this side with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:33] The Marriage of the Lamb is come it's
[1:09:35] not we go to the wedding supper we get
[1:09:37] married this
[1:09:39] side amen there's an invisible Union
[1:09:41] that's taking place but you see because
[1:09:43] of unbelief they could not enter in
[1:09:45] because there's always a
[1:09:47] cry there's always a cry you see let's
[1:09:50] go back I say let's not go back no sir
[1:09:53] see to them obviously slavery was coming
[1:09:55] comfortable people can be used to being
[1:09:57] beaten and downtrod and poor me and just
[1:10:00] whipped and faced down in the mud and
[1:10:02] just being the devil's whipping post you
[1:10:03] can get used to that I say let's rise up
[1:10:06] above those shackles let's rise up above
[1:10:08] that unbelief that's not our portion
[1:10:10] that's not what we're made to be amen
[1:10:12] we're made to be Overcomers we're made
[1:10:14] to conquer amen we're made to be God has
[1:10:16] said we are more than conquerors through
[1:10:17] Christ Jesus amen so this is what he's
[1:10:20] made us to be I say Amen let's do it
[1:10:23] amen but you see these Pharisees who
[1:10:25] claim to be Believers were not born
[1:10:26] again if they were born again they would
[1:10:28] never have spoken such things they would
[1:10:30] have seen the deadness of what they came
[1:10:31] out of and the reality of what they
[1:10:33] walking in amen and if you see the
[1:10:35] deadness of what you came out of well
[1:10:37] the only way to see that is when you see
[1:10:38] the New and Living Way you see the
[1:10:40] reality of the word you see the power of
[1:10:42] God in your life you see he's
[1:10:43] transformed you from what you were you
[1:10:45] may have been a been a proud arrogant
[1:10:47] message believer but one day God found
[1:10:49] you transformed your life and that's all
[1:10:51] burn out of you and you realize that was
[1:10:53] not the way to live and I'm so glad not
[1:10:55] that person anymore amen but you see it
[1:10:57] takes God see it takes a truly a dying
[1:11:00] to self amen for the fire of God
[1:11:03] obviously with these Pharisees the fire
[1:11:04] of God did not come down upon them and
[1:11:06] burn their old nature
[1:11:08] out otherwise they would never have been
[1:11:10] speaking this way see human ability can
[1:11:12] never give you overcoming power this is
[1:11:14] what they thought see they keep the law
[1:11:16] they do this they do this then they can
[1:11:18] be saved no human ability can never give
[1:11:20] you overcoming power it's letting God
[1:11:22] take over and letting him live in your
[1:11:24] life amen see every Antichrist Spirit
[1:11:28] against the prophet is still here now
[1:11:29] let's take a few we're just going to
[1:11:31] leave that up cuz I've got some other
[1:11:33] things here see the Baptist would say
[1:11:35] it's just a see see the Baptist spirit
[1:11:37] that will try and drive us off the peak
[1:11:38] says it's just a confession of Faith as
[1:11:41] as brother Arman said a few Wednesdays
[1:11:43] ago in his afre English where what he
[1:11:45] meant was and and I did speak to him so
[1:11:47] so so this is okay and see what he meant
[1:11:50] was just believing what he said is just
[1:11:52] believing is not enough and what he
[1:11:54] meant by that is just just a confession
[1:11:56] is not enough see many people identify
[1:11:59] as many things it doesn't make them
[1:12:01] thus I could identify as a car today am
[1:12:04] I a
[1:12:05] car that's how ridiculous the world has
[1:12:07] become but you see if I say no I'm a
[1:12:09] Christian and now I have a testimony God
[1:12:12] has changed my life it's not just an
[1:12:14] empty confession it's a reality right
[1:12:16] because what I believe he's made me I
[1:12:18] have become by his grace am mean so a
[1:12:20] Baptist confession just is basically
[1:12:23] just believe by faith and it's yours but
[1:12:24] there's no change now that is the
[1:12:26] biggest edent to the blood of Jesus
[1:12:28] Christ I've ever heard in my life amen
[1:12:30] that is such a that is such a nonsense
[1:12:32] amen where where where see it's more
[1:12:35] than just saying you have it you possess
[1:12:39] it what you believe has become
[1:12:41] manifested in your
[1:12:44] life amen yeah there we go we'll come to
[1:12:46] that soon sorry see when we say we've
[1:12:49] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:51] the True Believer literally has the True
[1:12:53] Believer literally has had Pentecost
[1:12:56] amen it's not just a it's not just a a
[1:12:59] nice idea and there's been no change in
[1:13:01] life the True Believer if they've been
[1:13:03] delivered from alcohol they''re being
[1:13:05] delivered like as I've said I used to
[1:13:08] brew the stuff now I could live in a
[1:13:09] brewery and I and I'll be the most sober
[1:13:12] man in existence CU I've been delivered
[1:13:14] from that Spirit I've been delivered
[1:13:16] from you know these kind of things so
[1:13:18] it's not just me confessing I'm clean no
[1:13:20] the Lord has made me clean you see but a
[1:13:22] Baptist confession says yes I'm clean
[1:13:24] but the desire still there amen so it's
[1:13:27] not just that we've gone you know no so
[1:13:29] it's not just yes if you confess it you
[1:13:33] know then you have it no it must become
[1:13:36] a reality am mean just like people say
[1:13:39] well you know we've been restored you
[1:13:40] know the grain is back again as you know
[1:13:42] brother BR would say that you know the
[1:13:44] first church was the grain right there
[1:13:47] was buried in the ground in the Dark
[1:13:48] Ages then it came forth Luther Wesley
[1:13:51] the plant was growing and now we've come
[1:13:53] to the grain again
[1:13:55] and brother Ram says now the grain is
[1:13:57] here it just needs to lay in the
[1:13:58] presence of the Sun and ripen and so
[1:14:02] people say look look at the grain
[1:14:04] there's no moving Parts in a piece of
[1:14:06] grain you don't see it wave in the
[1:14:08] breeze like the rest of the plant maybe
[1:14:09] I should had a picture of a wheat plant
[1:14:11] you know but you know the the leaves
[1:14:13] they move the tassel blows in the wind
[1:14:15] you know the Shook and everything you
[1:14:16] know you the whole plant can Sway in the
[1:14:18] breeze when you take the grain put it on
[1:14:19] the ground I mean I mean put it on there
[1:14:21] it just lays there so people will take
[1:14:23] that argument and say well there's no
[1:14:25] manifestation of the spirit anymore we
[1:14:27] don't need those things because the
[1:14:29] grain has no manifestation it doesn't
[1:14:31] move it doesn't you know the days of
[1:14:33] Miracles well that was the Pentecost L
[1:14:35] but we've moved on from that now but we
[1:14:37] understand that God doesn't take away he
[1:14:39] adds amen everything that the Luthers
[1:14:42] had that was genuine we have everything
[1:14:44] that the methodists had that was genuine
[1:14:46] we have everything that the Pentecostals
[1:14:48] had we have amen he doesn't take away
[1:14:51] right so now people say well you know
[1:14:54] this is the Grain and you know there's
[1:14:55] no moving parts that's why the bride is
[1:14:58] the way she is we've gone past the
[1:14:59] manifestation of the spirit you know the
[1:15:01] spirit doesn't move anymore cuz we're
[1:15:03] the grain I think what nonsense is that
[1:15:05] because if you take the original grain
[1:15:08] when he walked upon the face of the
[1:15:10] Earth what did he do he raised the dead
[1:15:12] he cast out Devils amen he prophesied
[1:15:15] amen he brought Deliverance amen God
[1:15:17] used him mightily it was why the
[1:15:19] fullness of God and B was in him to
[1:15:21] bring Deliverance to Open the Eyes of
[1:15:22] the blind set the captives free I mean
[1:15:25] so if that was him as one man now he's
[1:15:27] in a multi-member body what's going to
[1:15:29] be manifesting the sick are going to be
[1:15:31] healed the dead will be raised healing
[1:15:33] will come Deliverance will come the
[1:15:34] Devils will be cast out the Holy Ghost
[1:15:36] will be pulled out amen so that is to me
[1:15:39] the manifestation of the
[1:15:42] grain what it's him in a multi-member
[1:15:45] body you put one seed of wheat in the
[1:15:48] ground you get a whole bunch of the head
[1:15:50] same same quality same substance same
[1:15:53] DNA same everything
[1:15:55] right spiritually now right same thing
[1:15:58] it's what happened Jesus was one grain
[1:16:00] he went on the ground brought forth a
[1:16:02] crop and the church was put on the
[1:16:04] ground brought forth a crop and here we
[1:16:06] are all right so don't ever think well
[1:16:09] you know cuz this cold formal Spirit
[1:16:11] doesn't want God to have us right
[1:16:14] away there's always a battle in every
[1:16:16] Church of
[1:16:18] Supremacy and in every family and every
[1:16:20] life what what spirit is going to rule
[1:16:22] you is it your family spirit is it a
[1:16:25] religious spirit or is it the Holy
[1:16:28] Ghost all right amen so you know and and
[1:16:32] even people will say you know um the
[1:16:34] Holy Ghost comes without sensation so
[1:16:36] you can have it and not know you have it
[1:16:39] and brother BR would say you know the
[1:16:40] Holy Ghost comes without sensation but
[1:16:41] he says but the works of Christ are
[1:16:43] manifested in that person if you take
[1:16:45] the whole quote and people will say well
[1:16:47] you know like Mary she was she was found
[1:16:49] with child by the Holy Ghost she didn't
[1:16:51] realize it even
[1:16:53] happened and that is true true but
[1:16:55] that's not how she got eternal life she
[1:16:58] had to go to the upper room she had to
[1:17:01] be filled with the Holy Ghost she had to
[1:17:02] act like a drunk because the promise had
[1:17:05] been fulfilled in her life she had a
[1:17:07] definite
[1:17:09] manifestation why cuz God dwelt in her
[1:17:12] and you and and if you won't take that
[1:17:14] well when she got pregnant with the Lord
[1:17:15] Jesus what happened her her just like a
[1:17:18] natural you know like anyone else who's
[1:17:19] been pregnant your appetite changes some
[1:17:23] things you love some things you can't
[1:17:25] stand your walk eventually
[1:17:28] changes cuz you're walking for two or
[1:17:30] three or how many you know so your walk
[1:17:32] changes how how you act change the
[1:17:34] things you once did you can't do anymore
[1:17:35] cuz you got to look out you're not
[1:17:36] looking it's the life in you is
[1:17:39] dictating to you what you eat what you
[1:17:40] don't eat where you go what you don't do
[1:17:42] all those things it's the baby it's the
[1:17:44] life it's not you you've become prisoner
[1:17:46] to a
[1:17:48] baby what about the Holy Ghost now when
[1:17:50] he comes in right so if you can't even
[1:17:52] take that second bit take the first bit
[1:17:54] so her life changed cuz she had a
[1:17:57] visitation by an Angel but many people
[1:17:58] say yes I've got the Holy Ghost but
[1:18:00] there's been no change what's
[1:18:02] happened but you see and then and then
[1:18:05] there's the you know the Church of
[1:18:08] Church of Christ spirit that doesn't
[1:18:09] believe in you know that comes in among
[1:18:11] Believers that doesn't believe in the
[1:18:13] Supernatural but where but where a
[1:18:15] supernatural God is there's going to be
[1:18:17] Supernatural things happening you can't
[1:18:19] keep from it that's why it's got to be
[1:18:22] that way amen so if there's a super
[1:18:24] Supernatural God present Supernatural
[1:18:26] things are going to happen and it's more
[1:18:28] than going to be an interesting lecture
[1:18:30] it's going to be more than an
[1:18:31] interesting song service no Supernatural
[1:18:33] things will happen I mean I remember
[1:18:35] when we had I think it was when when
[1:18:36] brother Tim Dodd was here there was
[1:18:38] Sister K Moyer was sitting in the
[1:18:40] congregation in the pre- service just
[1:18:41] the musicians are playing she had a bad
[1:18:43] knee and she just felt the prin of God
[1:18:45] come and touch your knee and totally
[1:18:46] healed it just in the pre- service well
[1:18:48] Christine had a bad back a few years ago
[1:18:50] she's just in bed she's praying God came
[1:18:52] down and just totally fixed her back why
[1:18:54] cuz when you the presence of a
[1:18:55] supernatural God Supernatural things
[1:18:57] happen amen you just can't keep from it
[1:18:59] it's got to happen amen just like gon he
[1:19:02] says now if you stand he says here if
[1:19:04] God be with us where are all the
[1:19:05] Miracles the Mighty Man of Valor could
[1:19:07] refer back to the old word and know it's
[1:19:09] right because he know that this that God
[1:19:11] is a supernatural being and wherever a
[1:19:13] supernatural being is you'll do he'll do
[1:19:16] Supernatural signs because the
[1:19:17] Supernatural is in him you just can't
[1:19:19] get out of it how can you stand in the
[1:19:21] face of the wind without having the wind
[1:19:23] blowing how can you get in the the water
[1:19:25] without being wet water is wet that's
[1:19:27] the chemical of it it's wet and when you
[1:19:29] get in water you're going to get wet
[1:19:31] right and when you get in the presence
[1:19:32] of God the supernatural there's going to
[1:19:35] be Supernatural signs Supernatural
[1:19:37] workings of a supernatural God Amen so
[1:19:40] we can never get to a spot say well we
[1:19:42] don't need God to do Supernatural things
[1:19:44] anymore no we need God more
[1:19:46] supernaturally than ever before because
[1:19:48] the devil's running rampant in the end
[1:19:50] time but then God is R running rampant
[1:19:52] too amen so because when the enemy comes
[1:19:54] like a flood God says I'll raise up a
[1:19:56] standard against them and what is that
[1:19:58] the promises of God becoming more real
[1:20:00] to the believer they become more alive
[1:20:02] they come more stronger they become more
[1:20:03] strengthened to you why he's raised a
[1:20:06] standard amen will we believe no my God
[1:20:08] can do anything Hallelujah we can stand
[1:20:12] on the top of the mountain I'm being
[1:20:14] bombarded I'm not retreating from the
[1:20:15] spot reinforcements are here and they're
[1:20:18] coming amen yes sir I didn't say
[1:20:22] reinforcements are coming first because
[1:20:23] God is already in you
[1:20:27] Hallelujah I trust we're all happy this
[1:20:29] morning amen so we've got to know we
[1:20:31] should never settle for anything less
[1:20:32] than a supernatural God moving in a
[1:20:34] supernatural way amen hallelujah that
[1:20:36] that's our portion that's right amen but
[1:20:39] you see
[1:20:42] now it's it's so vital as it says in
[1:20:45] Proverbs where there is no vision the
[1:20:47] people perish so we Caleb had a vision
[1:20:53] that Mountain's mine Joshua had a vision
[1:20:55] the land is ours Moses had a vision
[1:20:57] they're going in now so some of us can
[1:21:02] have a vision but you've got to have a
[1:21:03] vision you all of us ourselves got to
[1:21:06] have that same vision this word is true
[1:21:09] the Rapture is mine I'm walking with God
[1:21:12] he's come here to redeem me he's my
[1:21:14] savior he's my comforter I'm going all
[1:21:16] the way up into Glory that should be the
[1:21:18] vision of Our Lives amen you know how we
[1:21:21] how we structure everything should be
[1:21:22] around that God is alive
[1:21:25] and he's my God Amen but if we do not
[1:21:27] have that Vision that's where
[1:21:28] frustration can come in that's where
[1:21:31] resentment can come in because you don't
[1:21:33] see the value of what you're doing in
[1:21:35] the moment amen but but if you have that
[1:21:37] Vision you'll see everyday life has a
[1:21:39] purpose it may be very much same maybe
[1:21:42] you know maybe Friday was the same as
[1:21:45] the last Friday maybe Monday tomorrow be
[1:21:47] very similar to the Monday you had a
[1:21:48] week ago but there's value in every day
[1:21:51] if you got this Vision I'm on the King's
[1:21:52] Highway I'm walking with God like Enoch
[1:21:55] walked am mean I want to be a blessing I
[1:21:57] want to be a witness I want to I want to
[1:21:58] walk with God that everyone around me
[1:22:00] will I'll be so salty that they'll want
[1:22:03] what I have then then you're walking in
[1:22:05] Vision amen you're not saying oh another
[1:22:07] job and this is the same and this is
[1:22:09] wrong and no no that is when you don't
[1:22:11] have Vision you may get frustrated in
[1:22:14] the every day we all have
[1:22:15] frustrations we're human but if you have
[1:22:18] Vision you can look beyond the
[1:22:20] frustration amen like brother Arman said
[1:22:22] about you they complain about the sand
[1:22:24] and the desert and the trouble and the
[1:22:26] lack of water and all these things but
[1:22:28] Caleb and Joshua had Vision we may be
[1:22:31] here but we're not staying here this is
[1:22:33] not the purpose of Us coming out of
[1:22:34] Egypt is to enjoy the desert no well not
[1:22:37] enjoy the desert but we're on our way I
[1:22:40] me you know I imagine that the that the
[1:22:42] atmosphere in Caleb and Joshua's tent
[1:22:44] was very different to cor and Dayan and
[1:22:46] all the rest cor and Dayan were fussing
[1:22:48] and backbiting and trying to maneuver
[1:22:50] things to take over and everyone was
[1:22:52] complaining look at the sand and where's
[1:22:54] the water and my problems and my needs
[1:22:56] and this is wrong they had no vision but
[1:22:58] Caleb and Joshua would have gathered
[1:23:00] their family around the
[1:23:01] table
[1:23:03] Hallelujah I know I've said it before
[1:23:05] but I enjoy it every time it comes to
[1:23:06] mine they would have sat around the
[1:23:08] table children did you enjoy the Mana
[1:23:11] Hallelujah yes Dad it was awesome I'm so
[1:23:13] glad aren't you glad God brought us out
[1:23:16] aren't you glad that God sent a prophet
[1:23:17] down into the age with a pillar of fire
[1:23:20] am mean you see the pillar of fire
[1:23:21] hanging over the Tabernacle and our
[1:23:23] God's taking us through and let me tell
[1:23:25] you let me tell your children you know
[1:23:28] how I went with the other spies and they
[1:23:30] would have probably heard this testimony
[1:23:31] probably pretty much every other day I
[1:23:33] want to tell you about the land again
[1:23:35] children because you're going to live in
[1:23:36] that land it's not just me visiting
[1:23:38] there one time and coming back we are
[1:23:40] going to possess this promise you're
[1:23:42] going to enjoy what I'm telling you is
[1:23:44] there it's real I stood on it I've
[1:23:47] experienced it I've tasted it I've seen
[1:23:50] it I've heard it I breathed it in it's
[1:23:52] there and you're going to experienced
[1:23:54] exactly the same things I believe
[1:23:56] Jehovah God would have stepped into the
[1:23:57] tent anointed their faith amen bring
[1:24:00] them as a family unit around Hallelujah
[1:24:03] yes we're going to take it yes this is
[1:24:04] not our end sure the winds are blowing
[1:24:06] the sand and the Heat and everything but
[1:24:08] this is not our resting place Hallelujah
[1:24:10] why because they had Vision amen I trust
[1:24:13] that sure you may be a sandstorm blowing
[1:24:15] through your life but realize this is
[1:24:17] not the End Amen this is not what this
[1:24:20] is not what where you are
[1:24:22] staying you're going through amen so we
[1:24:25] must we must always remember that the
[1:24:29] vision of the the bride is to take a
[1:24:32] Rapture and the vision of the Bride is
[1:24:35] to be a unified
[1:24:37] body the vision of the Bride is to see
[1:24:40] the word of God manifested in every
[1:24:42] member the vision of the Bride is to
[1:24:44] have discernment that we're all here to
[1:24:46] meet one another's needs every joint
[1:24:49] supplieth amen this this is the vision
[1:24:51] of the Bride but you realize the
[1:24:53] Antichrist Spirit what he wants to do is
[1:24:56] break
[1:24:58] Fellowship as as our lord Jesus would
[1:25:01] say in John
[1:25:03] 10 but he that is in highing and not the
[1:25:06] shepherd whose own sheep are not see the
[1:25:09] wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and
[1:25:11] fleeth and the Wolf catcheth them and
[1:25:14] scattereth the Sheep this is what the
[1:25:16] Antichrist Spirit does wants to break a
[1:25:18] herd up break a church up break up
[1:25:21] fellow you know break the fellowship up
[1:25:24] and this is how the enemy comes in to
[1:25:26] try and make us
[1:25:27] cold that a cold church is a scattered
[1:25:31] church because there's no feeling one
[1:25:33] for another there's no love one for
[1:25:35] another there's no care one for another
[1:25:36] it's just well this is my church this is
[1:25:37] where I go and that's a cold Church
[1:25:40] there should be such a
[1:25:42] warmth of love and care and respect and
[1:25:46] concern should be such a warmth that
[1:25:49] that that if we could physically well
[1:25:51] take the spiritual temperature and make
[1:25:54] at the physical temperature man this
[1:25:56] place should be
[1:25:57] tropical I don't know if you don't like
[1:26:00] heat I like heat I like sunshine right
[1:26:02] but but this place should be bmy and
[1:26:04] tropical and nice spiritually amen but
[1:26:08] you see the enemy wants to scatter the
[1:26:10] Sheep now how he scatters the Sheep he
[1:26:12] always comes in subtly he wants to break
[1:26:15] down respect for church officers this is
[1:26:16] what he wants to do because if you do
[1:26:18] not have confidence in the brother who's
[1:26:20] in that office amen you will not respect
[1:26:22] that office and if if you can't respect
[1:26:25] the brother in the office at least
[1:26:26] respect the office I mean just like me
[1:26:28] if you can't respect me as a pastor at
[1:26:30] least respect the office as a pastor
[1:26:32] same thing with a pastor's wife amen you
[1:26:34] got to respect the office that she's in
[1:26:36] am mean the Deacon's wives remember
[1:26:38] because if you can't respect the man you
[1:26:40] won't respect the woman if you don't
[1:26:41] respect the woman you can't respect the
[1:26:42] man because they're
[1:26:44] one amen isn't that true so I'm not you
[1:26:49] know that's just how it is if you can't
[1:26:50] respect our wives you're not respecting
[1:26:52] us our deacons are not glorified
[1:26:54] babysitters in the back or ushers
[1:26:56] they're the policemen of the church if
[1:26:58] they tell me off to speak in the
[1:26:59] sanctuary I'll say yes I'm sorry I won't
[1:27:02] say who you are I'm in I'm the no I will
[1:27:04] respect the Deacon because they're
[1:27:06] controlling the order in the church cuz
[1:27:09] we must so we must respect one now
[1:27:10] there's a reason I'm saying this is that
[1:27:12] because if you just give respect to the
[1:27:14] Holy Ghost exactly right yes sir and
[1:27:16] when you get to doing that then God will
[1:27:18] go pouring out his blessings Among Us
[1:27:21] amen just just us little group right
[1:27:23] here about 50 or 60 maybe 75 people
[1:27:26] sitting in here tonight if we would just
[1:27:29] all together bind ourselves together and
[1:27:30] give Godly respects to God and to the
[1:27:33] Holy Spirit and to what he's doing in
[1:27:35] this day and respect every gift and
[1:27:37] every office that he'll send into our
[1:27:39] midst then God will continue to pour out
[1:27:41] his Spirit upon us and we'll grow on
[1:27:43] numbers and multiply don't you believe
[1:27:46] that sure we've got to have respects
[1:27:48] unto God that's the reason I say I want
[1:27:50] to see God's I want God to pour his
[1:27:52] Blessing out so much we just cannot
[1:27:54] maintain it it's just too overwhelming
[1:27:56] it's too awesome it's too what happened
[1:27:58] in church I don't know I've got to go
[1:28:00] see the video again God just took over
[1:28:02] and not just here but everywhere where
[1:28:05] just one unified body God moving and
[1:28:07] power there's a Unity I believe we've
[1:28:09] never even tasted I mean you know
[1:28:12] there's more to God and what he can do
[1:28:14] you know many times we think back at
[1:28:15] camps and how he's moved in a mighty way
[1:28:17] to me that's just a little you know
[1:28:19] that's a
[1:28:20] sip of what he can do Hallelujah I don't
[1:28:24] believe we've reached the peak and I
[1:28:25] don't believe we ever will because our
[1:28:27] God's Eternal but let's keep climbing
[1:28:29] the summit of His blessings now we're on
[1:28:31] the top of the mountain but let's climb
[1:28:33] the summit of His
[1:28:35] blessings right why put a cap well
[1:28:38] that's all God can do
[1:28:40] no let's not have that kind of an
[1:28:42] attitude no God can do more he can do
[1:28:44] the exceedingly abundantly Beyond you
[1:28:47] can ask or think amen so we must have
[1:28:50] respect for every gift we should we
[1:28:52] should treasure every gift every
[1:28:55] office someone's singing someone's
[1:28:57] cleaning someone's cooking someone's
[1:28:59] Sunday schooling whatever it is every
[1:29:01] part mother father daughter whatever the
[1:29:04] gift is we say thank God thank God for
[1:29:07] this gift that's come into our midst
[1:29:08] let's treasure this gift you're welcome
[1:29:10] we're all part of the same
[1:29:12] body amen amen praise the
[1:29:16] Lord but you see a selfish a selfish
[1:29:20] Spirit brings
[1:29:22] division even you look in the Corinthian
[1:29:26] Church everyone had a Psalm everyone had
[1:29:28] a tongue everyone was doing their own
[1:29:30] thing there was no there's no Unity they
[1:29:32] are all divided they're all carnal it's
[1:29:33] actually a carnal Church the Corinthian
[1:29:35] Church and then even when they come to
[1:29:36] the Lord's
[1:29:37] Supper he says first of all when you
[1:29:40] come together in the church I hear that
[1:29:41] there be divisions among you and I
[1:29:43] partly believe it for there must be also
[1:29:45] heresies among you that they which are
[1:29:47] approved may be made manifest among you
[1:29:51] who who are they which are approved they
[1:29:53] which are approved of God God would be
[1:29:55] made manifest among you amen when you
[1:29:58] come together therefore into one place
[1:30:00] this is not to eat the Lord's Supper for
[1:30:03] an eating every one of you take taketh
[1:30:06] before other his own supper and one is
[1:30:09] hungry and the other is drunken so
[1:30:11] there's a carnal Spirit comeing what can
[1:30:13] I get what can I take see there's no
[1:30:16] waiting one for another see one's hungry
[1:30:18] the other's drunken cuz the drunken says
[1:30:20] well I'm going to get everything I can
[1:30:23] and this court no Unity as he would
[1:30:25] comeing down here he says wherefore my
[1:30:28] brethren when you come together to eat t
[1:30:31] one for another so think about more than
[1:30:33] just yourself don't be so focused on you
[1:30:36] but be focused on the whole body how can
[1:30:38] I help and how can I be a blessing Amen
[1:30:41] to to everyone
[1:30:43] here you
[1:30:45] [Music]
[1:30:47] see where am I up
[1:30:49] to I'm just going to jump down to this I
[1:30:52] feel time is gone and you you know
[1:30:58] worship he's the main
[1:31:00] thing he was the prophets he was them he
[1:31:03] was in the Psalms he was in the history
[1:31:05] and here's the things to come the same
[1:31:06] yesterday today and forever I mean
[1:31:08] Hebrews 13:8 if you're writing it down
[1:31:10] he should be then he should be the
[1:31:12] principle if that's what he is and we
[1:31:14] believe it don't we then if he is that
[1:31:17] then he should be the Principal theme of
[1:31:18] our talking our thinking our singing our
[1:31:22] walks he should be the Principal theme
[1:31:23] of of our life if he's the principal
[1:31:25] theme of The Bible and the Bible's in us
[1:31:28] then he should be the Principal theme of
[1:31:30] everything that we do say or think
[1:31:32] should be Christ so how we treat one
[1:31:34] another should be how he would treat
[1:31:38] us he doesn't tear his children down he
[1:31:41] doesn't belittle any part of his body
[1:31:43] see Jesus has a perfect revelation of
[1:31:46] his body just like I know this is my
[1:31:49] thumb you can't convince me it's not my
[1:31:52] thumb you can change its color change it
[1:31:54] shape give it plastic surgery it is
[1:31:56] still my
[1:31:57] thumb why CU it's attached to my body
[1:31:59] and I know it's attached to my body amen
[1:32:02] just like Jesus he has a perfect
[1:32:04] revelation of who his body is so
[1:32:07] therefore how he treats us is how he
[1:32:09] treats his own body because we are his
[1:32:10] body amen so it should be the same thing
[1:32:12] with you and I friends that if he is in
[1:32:15] us then the things we say do or think
[1:32:18] should be
[1:32:19] Christ now Christ does not
[1:32:22] complain Christ ises not tear down
[1:32:25] Christ is not negative he's positive he
[1:32:28] builds up he edifies right brother Ram
[1:32:30] says one of the worst things I don't
[1:32:31] know where the quote is just now but he
[1:32:33] says one of the worst things is a
[1:32:34] complaining
[1:32:35] Spirit it tears down
[1:32:38] faith and you could see that with the
[1:32:40] children of Israel coming out of Egypt
[1:32:42] is that their faith was being was trying
[1:32:44] to be tore down because it was unbelief
[1:32:47] complaining all the time why this and
[1:32:50] why Moses and why that and all these
[1:32:51] things it was it was unbelief
[1:32:54] had come in so we should never complain
[1:32:57] it should be such a privilege and honor
[1:32:59] to serve one
[1:33:00] another amen it should be the highest
[1:33:03] thing because the Bible says that that
[1:33:05] as we have therefore opportunity let us
[1:33:07] do good unto all men especially unto
[1:33:09] them who are the household of faith so
[1:33:11] we should do good to all men but
[1:33:13] especially the household of faith amen
[1:33:15] so it should be such a highest honor
[1:33:18] when we have one another in our homes or
[1:33:20] when we gather together any occasion it
[1:33:22] should be such an honor it's such a
[1:33:23] privilege to have you here it's such a
[1:33:25] privilege to have you here this morning
[1:33:28] amen as a shepherd of this place I it's
[1:33:29] such a privilege to have you here it's a
[1:33:31] blessing for me I'm blessed to see you
[1:33:32] here this morning amen so we should have
[1:33:35] that same attitude when we have lunch
[1:33:37] when we have dinner because worship and
[1:33:39] sacrifice go hand in hand you cannot
[1:33:41] have one without the other so remember
[1:33:44] as John would say how can you say you
[1:33:46] love God when you do not love the
[1:33:48] brothers right so how do I show I love
[1:33:51] God as I love you right so so it's
[1:33:54] actually how I treat you is actually a
[1:33:55] worship to
[1:33:57] God Amen so but we must never lose focus
[1:34:01] of these
[1:34:03] things we we must never we must never
[1:34:07] put a negative slant on anything we do
[1:34:10] why do I have to do oh Camp's coming up
[1:34:12] or we're having lunch again or this why
[1:34:14] do we have to do this see we don't
[1:34:15] understand the power of
[1:34:18] lunch amen we don't understand the power
[1:34:22] see the Devil Wants wants to destroy
[1:34:24] Fellowship as I said he wants to scatter
[1:34:26] the Sheep he wants to break down see
[1:34:29] fellowship with Believers is a
[1:34:30] supernatural event that's right it's an
[1:34:33] incredibly powerful event see what is
[1:34:35] fellowship what do the leaves do it
[1:34:37] makes it cool when the birds fly under
[1:34:39] the leaves aha they cool off that's your
[1:34:42] tree again and he shall be like a tree
[1:34:44] that's planted see all right where
[1:34:46] people can come and sit under the
[1:34:48] Fellowship of the Holy Ghost cool off a
[1:34:49] little bit you're all flustrated you
[1:34:52] don't know what's happened where you die
[1:34:54] whether you're saved or not you don't
[1:34:56] know whether this church is right or
[1:34:57] that is right just come under the tree
[1:35:00] and get some leaves on it sit there let
[1:35:02] the winds from Heaven go to blowing like
[1:35:04] a rushing Mighty Wind Through the leaves
[1:35:06] you know and then what you begin to cool
[1:35:08] off a bit so you're can to have such a
[1:35:10] stressful week you have the most
[1:35:12] precious week of your life you come to
[1:35:14] church what you you're coming under the
[1:35:16] those green trees of Fellowship I mean
[1:35:19] then we go to lunch if you choose to
[1:35:21] stay or go whatever but you know what's
[1:35:23] happening cool off a bit more why cuz
[1:35:26] you're in a supernatural atmosphere
[1:35:28] where God can minister to you while
[1:35:31] you're eating chips making a sandwich
[1:35:33] making a coffee you see God is settling
[1:35:37] you down amen so it should be really
[1:35:40] when we step into lunch how can I serve
[1:35:42] one another you need a coffee let's make
[1:35:44] a coffee you need some chips hey we're
[1:35:45] going to turn those fries on you know it
[1:35:48] should be such a joy say oh there's a
[1:35:50] mountain of dishes praise God I can wash
[1:35:52] dishes for the bride of Christ Christ
[1:35:55] amen praise the Lord you know I can look
[1:35:57] after the kids I can I can create an
[1:35:59] atmosphere where God can come down and
[1:36:02] do the miraculous you say God don't move
[1:36:04] in
[1:36:05] Fellowship Simon the Pharisee one day he
[1:36:09] had a church lunch that's right he was
[1:36:11] in the wrong church but he had a church
[1:36:13] lunch he invited Jesus to his lunch the
[1:36:15] best thing he ever did in his life was
[1:36:17] invite the Messiah to his lunch
[1:36:20] Hallelujah and then so they're just
[1:36:21] having their feast he doesn't realize
[1:36:24] cuz he's invited Jesus to lunch
[1:36:26] Supernatural things are going to happen
[1:36:28] Hallelujah so all he saw was guest lless
[1:36:31] and food and do I have enough money to
[1:36:33] pay for the food and what's going to be
[1:36:35] cooked and make sure servants are all
[1:36:37] dressed right they've got their orders
[1:36:38] right and all the entertainment he was
[1:36:40] just worried about all the natural
[1:36:42] things he had forgotten that the one he
[1:36:44] really needed there to make it lunch was
[1:36:48] coming amen so he was all stressed about
[1:36:50] those things see he didn't respect Jesus
[1:36:52] that's why when he came in his feet
[1:36:53] weren't washed he wasn't anointed kiss
[1:36:55] made welcome all those things see he
[1:36:57] came in with unwashed feet but you see
[1:37:00] there was because he was there anything
[1:37:02] could happen amen and there was a woman
[1:37:05] who wasn't invited to the wasn't invited
[1:37:07] to the feast but she looked through the
[1:37:08] windows she saw Jesus with dirty
[1:37:10] unwashed feet and something moved in her
[1:37:12] heart he was a sinner that needed
[1:37:14] salvation one of God's children was
[1:37:16] going to come to the
[1:37:17] lunch you got to think about the
[1:37:19] potential of us having lunch here
[1:37:22] hallelujah and then what what she did
[1:37:23] she got her ran home got her money got
[1:37:26] the best um Alabaster Box all those
[1:37:28] things paid all of her money got the
[1:37:30] thing somehow got in there I mean got to
[1:37:32] the presence of the Lord Jesus and her
[1:37:34] life was transformed while everyone was
[1:37:36] having lunch now you think about this
[1:37:39] imagine if imagine if this was us having
[1:37:42] lunch and we're having lunch there and
[1:37:45] then because Jesus is walking around the
[1:37:46] tables as we're having conversation
[1:37:48] we're building one another up it's just
[1:37:50] love being projected talking about how
[1:37:52] good the Lord is or how how he's helping
[1:37:54] us in our life or whatever we're talking
[1:37:55] about there's an atmosphere amen and
[1:37:58] then someone just begins to break down
[1:38:00] and they give their lives to the lord
[1:38:02] they're washing his feet Hallelujah and
[1:38:05] we won't have faces like all these guys
[1:38:07] like gawking like oh what's going on
[1:38:10] they Ru he you know she's ruining our
[1:38:11] whole thing and no it just be maybe just
[1:38:13] a break out of aaal Amazing Grace
[1:38:16] Hallelujah why CU God's come down to
[1:38:19] meet someone at lunch wouldn't you like
[1:38:21] a fellowship I'd love that'd be cool
[1:38:23] yeah amen that's not Pie in the Sky
[1:38:26] that's reality amen so why not then if
[1:38:30] this could be the potential of every
[1:38:31] lunch we have that God comes down heals
[1:38:34] someone touches someone brings brings a
[1:38:36] brings a you know clarification to
[1:38:38] something Comfort comes strength comes
[1:38:41] healing comes Deliverance comes should
[1:38:42] we not want to have the best attitude
[1:38:44] when we come to lunch amen amen when we
[1:38:46] serve one When We Gather Supernatural
[1:38:49] things could happen amen Eternal things
[1:38:51] could be imparted lives could be forever
[1:38:53] changed just while we're sitting around
[1:38:54] having a cup of
[1:38:57] coffee amen but you see that's why the
[1:38:59] enemy fights against Church lunch he
[1:39:02] fights against fellowship and I say as a
[1:39:03] Shepherd I feel very lit we must have it
[1:39:07] I will not Retreat from us having lunch
[1:39:09] I'll not Retreat from dinner or what or
[1:39:10] us gathering together I will not Retreat
[1:39:12] I'm standing right here this is very
[1:39:15] it's vital where every visitor that
[1:39:17] comes says to me you're so
[1:39:19] fortunate that you can have this you're
[1:39:22] so we don't have this at our church I'm
[1:39:24] so glad you can have this at your church
[1:39:26] this is the outside of coming in and so
[1:39:29] if that's their attitude I I just say
[1:39:31] thank you Lord I'm so thankful the Lord
[1:39:33] has allowed this to happen and we can
[1:39:35] gather we can talk and have fellowship
[1:39:36] and you know we're
[1:39:40] blessed so why Retreat from that why
[1:39:43] have a negative you know sure we can
[1:39:44] have a bad day but leave the bad day at
[1:39:46] the
[1:39:47] door you
[1:39:50] know I've never seen a sports fan in my
[1:39:52] life who's a real sports fan or someone
[1:39:55] who's a Swifty or someone I don't know
[1:39:56] you know and they'll mortgage their
[1:39:58] house they'll pay crazy amount of money
[1:40:00] to go to the go to some sports event
[1:40:03] they they'll give everything they may
[1:40:05] have the worst life that they've left

[1:40:10] This

[1:40:15] hell but they're there in front of their

[1:40:21] excited what they leave leave their
[1:40:24] troubles at the door and they have the
[1:40:26] and they pick up the right attitude say
[1:40:27] I'm going to enjoy this this may never
[1:40:30] happen again this may be my last chance
[1:40:32] to ever be in this kind of an atmosphere
[1:40:35] now I'm talking spiritual now you think
[1:40:36] about we may never have church again we
[1:40:38] may never have lunch again this may be
[1:40:40] the end why not go out with a
[1:40:42] bang am mean why not go out on a high

[1:40:46] to have an awesome time I'm excited what
