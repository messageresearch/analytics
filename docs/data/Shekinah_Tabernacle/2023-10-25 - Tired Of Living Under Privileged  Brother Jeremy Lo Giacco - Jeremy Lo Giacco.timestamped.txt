[1:12] calary he came again in this day to
[1:17] bring back Redemption for
[1:20] me he opened up the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:24] and all its Hidden
[1:27] Mysteries I know that we
[1:30] have written a book for a people we
[1:33] should
[1:37] be when I see another corn of weed
[1:41] coming to a mature
[1:44] stage this is the day of redemption it's
[1:49] price that has been
[1:51] paid when I see the things you promised
[1:56] that missing in my
[1:58] life oh how I want to lose my life so
[2:03] his life could be wrapped up in
[2:06] [Music]
[2:08] mine so his life could be wrapped up in
[2:14] mine for I'm tired of living under
[2:18] privileged seeing what God has
[2:21] done I'm tired of living as a servant
[2:26] when it's time for
[2:28] manifested son
[2:31] oh Lord send me a
[2:33] Revival and you promise the Holy Ghost
[2:37] to for the Greater Works we have to
[2:43] do for the Greater Works we have to
[2:49] do and there are souls under the
[2:54] alter the crying out how long sleeping
[2:59] Saints are anxiously
[3:01] waiting on the
[3:06] resurrection and in my heart there is a
[3:09] cry to go back to that place no more
[3:14] Darkly in a
[3:16] mirror now seeing face to
[3:22] face but the whole creation is groaning
[3:26] it's waiting on the sweet release
[3:30] the lion wants to lay down with the lamb
[3:33] for Thousand Years of
[3:36] peace and I want to see the one who's
[3:41] been with us all this
[3:43] time and still I have to lose my life so
[3:49] his life could be wrapped up in
[3:53] mine so his life could be wrapped up in
[3:58] mine

[4:37] dawned just can't go on this way just to
[4:42] say that I am a Christian to walk my
[4:46] Bible every
[4:49] day the prophet said the true church
[4:52] would write another book of Acts and if
[4:57] I don't come back to that place I have
[5:01] missed the
[5:04] mark But between Revival Seven Locks of
[5:08] grown there's a
[5:11] possibility the me be placed upon the
[5:15] sticks be baked into
[5:18] reality the faith to use that power is
