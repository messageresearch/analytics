bless sister Belinda amen god bless you I just like to thank the Lord and just give a little testimony about some day and I just I was about five or ten minutes into the service and I just started crying I couldn't stop I didn't know what was going on and and then we had the word coming and the Lord just hitting so many things you know in there and it was just beautiful and then we had the prayer line happening and I heard brother Ben say some of you will have mined barrels of it you know and I didn't go up to the front to be prayed for but I also know the prophecies that Lord can even meet you in your seat and I thought of the woman that they touched the hem of Jesus garment you know he met her right there and for me I've never experienced anything like that I just stood there just worshiping the Lord and just praising him it was like I felt like a hand just touch me on my heart and just this was just from here just down the side here and it's been over two years where I had just had struggles with my heart and it was like a spiritual wound and I believe the Lord made me here that day and I just want to give him all the things the praises for his deliverance and this song this song he is called the restoration of the supernatural and thank you and I wrote it in 2011 our pastor preached about that and then it took me five years to complete it because the second part was missing but it's where the Prophet when that interpretation came about it French French people that interpreted in the cafe and he said because you have chosen the narrow path the harder way and you have not walked in your own choosing you have picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way because this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven will await thee what a glorious decision you have made this in itself is that which will give and may come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine it's a promise to us [Music] every [Music] as well [Music] everybody's [Music] the natural expectation for the supernatural [Applause] [Music] god bless you sister Belinda I can be a witness to that I'm always on the expectation for the supernatural and unlike a God that that comes and can't prove himself he's Almighty Savior that the Conqueror the captain of the hosts supernaturals what'd he do it praise the Lord or just want to stand up let's sing how great is our God amen our supernatural God hallelujah they start with the chorus [Music] with me totally [Music] [Music] and [Music] [Music] baby [Music] [Music] is see [Music] he's there [Music] it reveal the sauce No revealing son you know [Music] [Music] [Music] no it sees the we say [Music] you worried every day [Music] the [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] he stands and gaudy [Music] Nagini beginning three [Music] yes the lie the line [Music] [Applause] [Music] is see [Music] they think that straight [Music] [Music] we'll see [Music] think that name of Jesus Christ the same above all names [Music] Oh [Music] power in that name hallelujah the [Music] and my heart we'll see how great [Music] and investing in real song [Music] is stay with me [Music] is no see [Music] ah [Music] thing with me is no see now [Music] is uh they sing that reach this real slow real real soon [Music] Oh and he is [Music] oh great and [Music] is [Music] [Music] Oh Lord I can't find a bitter way to go into your presence and to stand here worship you the Lord sing this from my soul raise up a standard hood and praise and honor and glory upon your name what you've done for us what you're busy doing and what is to come you are still the same and we can expect the same we as a bride a year tonight to come and feed on your word Lord come and fellowship around your dining table Lord now you just find perfection Lord may you find it well to come down and place us with your presence Thank You Holy Spirit to to have the Liberty to talk tonight please take over Lord I'm an empty vessel here and cumbria fill me with what you want to say to this bazzill congregation of thus these licks of file or that's burning bright Oh Lord maybe just yes maybe just come humble may become expected our hearts be open lord you see our prayer request and we will come in front of you of your throne Lord and and come and plead for these people and for the healings and for everything that needs to take place to come and to come into line and into that same channel Lord that we are we are in at this point in time we cannot wait to see you again Lord Jesus come and come quickly Jesus Christ's name [Music] god bless you seen Saints and welcome in the house of the Lord maybe I'll thank you musicians such a wonderful atmosphere thank you brother a month for leading us into worship thank you for our visitors coming the Mariana see you and we've got for the carrot and and he's on his way back on Friday we've had him we've had him for a nice long time it's never too long let me just get dead ABI it's been wonderful and that he can be part of our fellowship and oh man he's he spoilt as rotten them he's sitting at midnight tuning pianos and stuff sister double where are you I told you I promised we were tuning it last night and I'm so excited anyway let us let us tune open our Bibles and turn to 1 Corinthians 2 1 Corinthians 2 and that should be in my my little slideshow show so I really I really didn't want to have a slideshow today was that me or you okay nice didn't want a title I just wanted to I was thinking you know how it goes you think in your head where you're gonna stand at the pool but I don't know if maybe it's just me were you going to stand at the pool but I just want to you know I just want to finish it and this is how you how I prepare and I think oh man I feel feel much more relaxed this time and all that men and then it dawns on me I mean nerves sit in and then but then then that's my sign to say or the Lord's got something in store yeah so I had to I had to think of a title I did just gave it a title the three P's I'll start as a motivational speaker the three P's pray purpose and position it just came to me that literally came to me last minute it's turned to the word shall we 1 Corinthians 2 from verse 1 and I breather when I came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in meeting weakness and in fear and in much trembling exactly how I feel right now and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God howbeit we speak wisdom with among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to naught that we speak the wisdom of God and a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained my brother man see today for deigned before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory and we've would have missed this opportunity of of grace and of redeeming love but as it's written I have not seen no ear heard and thank you so much for sister Belinda because this is where it's fitting in with her song neither have entered into the heart of man we're just thinking of the supernatural thinking of this amazing we cannot even fathom that in this little heart of ours the things which God hath prepared for them that love them yea may God bless his word you may take your seats I just had a little reference there of Isaiah so that's where it's saying as it's written I love it when and that that's maybe another sermon on another time but love it with Jesus just kick devil in his teeth with with the Old Testament he doesn't he didn't even have to you know he was the new Desmond at that point it's just lovely so yeah okay and the pictures are they just for the kids I not for the adults just kidding okay I just want to take yep okay so I wanted to purposefully keep this short I wanted to purposefully have not a lot of time in front here because this power and prayer we've seen this now we've we've seen it on Sunday what a wonderful service and the opening that brother Ben had here the pulpit and just people coming pouring out and I'm pouring back in you know spurred and it was lovely and then and and I I'm starting to treasure this way I've listened to brother Loney's testimony and was referring to at some point ways he's praying and he's reading the word and he's connecting the dots and he's seeing that but if it's written and if I'm his then it will happen you know ask and you will receive right so he was not praying from a faith of and again I might repeat someone's other sermons and an expectation of or hope a hope so faith he was expecting it because he read it in the word it's a Living Word Christ that yesterday the same and today and forever and he's just taking at that he's expecting that healing he's expecting that change of heart he's expecting the demons to flee and that's that's just his faith and that's how it how it all starts and this is I think where we're going back to pre purpose and position trying to find my own individual walk in our body in our members trying to find my place so I've got a few hats a few positions but what is the Lord trying to tell me and and doesn't matter where that is I need to have that faith right so I'm part of the Bride and part of the body doesn't matter what's my title I've got thus saith the Lord so I can pray a fervent prayer I can go to the word and can say Lord this is what you've said I'm praying this I'm standing by this I've seen this work thank you lord brother Armand Johnson jump the gun slightly where is this a mini of water I need to sing that again I was I'm singing that because you know we're fishing and it's raining and I'm thinking Lord that water tank is filling yeah he's got the perfect time right and that's just another testimony small big whatever what the Lord placed on your heart the names that came on our little Watts have group tonight that's the that's the names we need to pray for and that we will pray for and we will pray with faith as an expectation we will get something right so coming back to I didn't want to take long because I want to give more time to pray I'm going to spend time in prayer I'm seeing change in my life I seem change in your lives I I see they're they're entering into a new spiritual realm is that only said realm South Africans struggle they right so we have men and women in our church that's got that that's growing in stature okay and I'm not even talking about the adults I'm not even talking about that all the sisters the ministers the Deacons the technicians I'm talking about the young ones that's getting to a place of perfect rest of harmony of getting into a channel quicker I'm seeing growth spiritually from younger ones coming to the fore coming giving everything to him because it works it is as simple as that and connecting the dots there sometimes you would say the only thing I can do is pray for him for her for the disease or whatever now I want to switch that so back in service here for Christ when I did that 99 and 2000 we I was very philosophical brother Jimmy I think you at that point now you you see the world in a different eye and I like that because I see myself in you so I can relate but I wrote all these little motivational things all this little one-liners you know that the big the bigwigs wrote you know and but one of them stuck thank goodness is it me that's popping and buzzing and cracking maybe I should not hit it okay I'll stand still where was I so the one thing stuck in and I praise God for this is pray does not equip us for the greater work pray is the greater work and I think sometimes we just we miss the boat we want to have all these gifts and all these stuff happen prayers where it starts is you start on your knees you start right at the bottom if it happens again we'll do a switch I'll put the stopwatch unemployment and see how quick we can do a tire change I mean a mic change thank you brother a month yes it doesn't it it is the greater work it is that's where it happens that's where why we have a wall room we have we have a prayer room that's why things are happening that's why we diligently on our post praying praying and praying and praying and and I pray to God that I have that in in my inner sanctuary in my home and my you know prayer closer than my time with the Lord so coming back to well you say the only thing I can do is pray why not change that to the only thing I do is pray or all I do is pray oh the one thing I can do is pray so that's bold italic the the only thing I can do I can't sing I can't play an instrument I can't be a technician I can pray I want to get to that point so now let's let's go and this is this is putting it practically I've just got pictures and then we can relate to I can relate to my head the story so two recent testimonies from me a former colleague of trying not an engineer named we when I started my company where I am now we met all the lady and and and and she she's got her who she likes and who she doesn't like you know so I'm sitting next to her we call it the hub so before you get placed out as a consultant to clients and all that you need to learn the ins and outs and be all professional and wear a llama tie you like my llama time yeah thank you brother benefits and so chitchat yakking away yawning and and I and and she mentioned something about horse riding farming hunting cars and I thought oh this is Mike yet I can relate I can talk to her yeah started talking she smokes and all that kind of thing and time goes by so she said she starts liking me and I like her you know I I like it when I get through to someone you know you sort of yeah you know the Lord is working in you and and thinking it's just see past the veneer you know this she's hiding something there's a there's something there for a reason and she's he's all you know cross with everyone and and you know short and you know and I'm just checking you know and they probably the people can't understand why am i you know finding her so interesting and we can chat so lack a you know so that goes on for a while I get placed out to a client I try to email her and say hey how's it going and she's doing me in this and I see she's jumping around a bit between clients and I thought okay and sort of all inquired the communication and and then the next thing I heard she left the company okay in my mind make that a little notice I'll try and keep contact with her and and she lifts up my way as well kept video so on poppin for a coffee and meet the family you know and I knew she had this little sport cars and everything you know my boys would like it if she comes in and and and stop there for a coffee with her with a nice little green oak or something like that and then I think it was just after the new we were just before sorry just before the new year yeah that's right I thought let me contact her again let me let me email her again and see how it goes and you know cookie my my my cookie self and you know how's it going and you know christmas is coming and what have you planned and she said nah oh I asked about her car I asked about a car and she said no she hasn't done that she doesn't have money for a wolf and all this kind of thing I thought oh that's odd is it all you know maybe I could take it in or something on and she sees now she's she's severely depressed and she can't leave the house and and all this kind of thing now backtracking just a bit probably a year before that I I got woken up wire by a phone call of a very good friend of mine and he was he was crying he was it was beside himself and I've never seen him like that and he and he and he struggled with this depression as well and missed my my whole carpool I miss my club you know they were parked outside and honking and trying to call me and I'm on the line with this maid of mine not to break the line not to not to let him go not to make him second priority I'm saying Lord he's found me you know why me so there's something there right looking in hindsight I had the identity I I had what is in me I knew what's my foundation on so he immediately this guy's is walking the straight and the narrow so anyway she she replies with that and immediately I could enter in and say I'm gonna pray for you if you don't mind I'm gonna pray for you right and I don't she did reply and I thought okay Lord yeah and I think it might have been one of our prayer services I really lifted it up and said Lord this is you know I'm exactly the opposite of a of a depressed individual I I cannot in the even into that burden but I don't want I don't even want my enemy to be depressed I want thing to to have love and liberty in and enjoy unspeakable you know I don't deserve this please Lord just give a disc evoke a glimmer of hope just you know that light in the tunnel and that's why I chose the rays of light coming through the clouds is that brother Branham refers to the clouds of sometimes you know as doubts and trying to get into the in the way of the of the s/o in and yeah so I'm got time went by and I think I think I started the conversation again hey how's it going and although oh no no actually she did she out of her own emailed me and said you won't believe it I forgot a dog I'm begging workforce and all that kind of thing I said that is indeed good news and this is how my new year starts just off there or a little camp we came back and this is what I receive I thought oh Lord you are you know I'm I'm you know I just want to pop it's bubbling and maybe it's boiling in me man and I was I was Jubilate him just and I told her you made my here this is this is the Lord you know she she doesn't go to church she doesn't but because I had that idea because I was comfortable which I am in Christ I didn't care where she was on her walk I knew that the Lord came and and and touched it touched a sow and this is what she what she sin hopefully you can see that funny but things started after we talked I deploy for a role that blah blah blah ages ago they called I interviewed was offer the job a week before Christmas so thanks for your praise I started last week so my reply was listen you can tell you can tell you can say what you want I know prayer works I've seen it and I can not function without it and that's what I reply said please come for a coffee please just you know can I do anything for you let me know and she she's sort of a herself again I know that one of us may be better cranky but she's out she's about cheese you know living again so I just praise the Lord you know plants seats plundered I can rest it Sabbath for me amen next one next Easter Mini another colleague now is we had a nice connection at work and you know we were almost like a like a little husband and wife you know we would always be at each other you know but we give the work done we work really well together so time passed probably a year but we still work in the same big project team and he comes so we we started having maybe shouldn't say that there's too loud but Zee garage has got a nice premium sausage roll it says sometimes spoil myself so me and him I started having his little routine back max probably a year ago so 18 months anyway so out of the blue a II what are you having for lunch I said well I didn't get lunch so maybe we should go for a walk ease and as he comes around to my pond he starts what is this Daniel fasting what he all my family members are becoming Christian what are you doing in you know like you noted I'm a Christian and I go whoa this is open door what's happening yeah yeah no um and he's the one he's the one always prodding you know oh I know you don't drink yeah you don't that's your religion eight you don't drink eh yeah yeah yeah yeah you know like so we busy organizing a cricket game I can play on Saturday complain Sunday or yeah you comprehend Sarah it's a religion name yep yep but I can play on Saturday your choice anyway I think they're gonna play on Sunday so I don't even reply you know he knows you know so anyway so we walking and he's trying to tell me now about his sister his sister has his doing this Daniel fasting he wants to know but more I said well the fasting the nutritional the diet side is one thing but man there's stuff behind that where it all started the root of why Daniel went on this far so I mean you can you can get lost and in the book of Daniel we all know this but um so you wanted the long and short I said Nana okay what what we do yeah so so she she became a Christian she's not doing this Daniel fasting I said so is she married is it as a husband Christian I said no she Hindu I said no I said so are they recently married no they married for 20 years or something I said whoa so now my mind goes oh I've got a bro I know a guy he's been there he's got a testimony and it's touched me and sucks my life so now I've got a burden for what she must go through now wow this is this is the magnitude he's probably not even you know see no and and I tell them this I say listen you need to get behind what what's driving her and ask her he said well how do i you know wait I said okay I said we as Christians we would ask one another tell me your testimony this is now me so tell your sister I will pray for her she's gonna pray for you we are all gangster like that you know this is how I talk to him so forgive my language but you know ah and he just he just last but in reality I'm I'm praying for his sister she's gonna pray for a family absolutely if what I know is she's gonna she's gonna be on her knees so that all the sister thinks he's 60 she's been a Christian for I don't know 30 or years so now all of a sudden there's the shift in the end and the family and because they close you know I just found that you know fascinating there oh okay he's come to me again he's like what is this you know what so we've got other colleagues it's also Christian you know it's maybe not walking the walk where I am but God rich in mercy so he came so he can he can talk to me about that and I can come and pray and I can and I know that my Maker will ask and you will receive right I just want to check my notes if I've touched on everything that I was supposed to and then I'll go into this at all yep so they were too small 1953 demonology no matter how much teaching you got you can drum that into you God is not in big words God isn't an honest heart you might stand there speak big words like I don't know what that doesn't bring you closer to God I I can't even speak proper English thank you Lord for that because then you can work through it you can stand and practice how to repeat your servant and say these things that don't get closer to God you can learn dictionary wall till you sleep with one and still wouldn't get you closer to God a humble submitted heart in the simplicity is what brings you to God and that's true amen a humble God God loves now no matter if you don't know your ABCs that don't make any difference just a humble heart why is he repeating this God dwells in a humble heart not an education not in schools not in theology seminaries or seminaries I can carry on just ahead recently some some stuff thrown at me around seminaries and how they want to depict the word and then yeah God dwells in a human heart and the lower you can break yourself down the more simple you can become greater in the sight of God let me give you something I see your fields are full of wheat are they a full head of weed always bounce a little low spring sticks up there and flopping around like it knows everything it ain't got it in the head that's the way with a lot of these guys that think they got a lot in their head and nothing in their heart they a holy head will bow to the power they recognize Jesus Christ as the Son of God and believe his works oh God how wonderful it is to come and I'm not saying I'm a mature wheat but I come I want to bow and I want to pray because I know it works come with a humble heart I I know no other because I on bose than anything so yes that's my little sermonette god bless you for listening and give me some grace and all my broken up English I know we've got a few a few prayer requests so maybe I should open the floor if there's anything else any other prayer
