[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] praise the Lord good morning everyone welcome to the house of God this morning amen it's good to be here it's good to have this opportunity to bring praise and worship to the Lord and to uh bring all of our Spirits into a just a nice uh and into harmony with the spirit of God I was reading about um can you just turn the piano down the music down just slightly I was reading an um uh how Saul would sometimes be he would be troubled by by an evil spirit by things that would just trouble him but David would play Night play music and the spirit would be driven away and his then his Spirit could be rested and and that now I'm not saying we're Souls but you know we do sometimes get troubled by things and we get a bit sort of you know anxious or whatever it might be but may my prayer this morning when we're out in the the side room was that you know the the at that we could create an atmosphere that if anyone is sort of a bit worked up or anything like that or anything at all that that we could sort of drive that away and that our Spirits would be in harmony with the spirit of God and then we could be in that place to to receive of his life and his word into us you know and and and be in harmony so we just pray that this morning speaking of praying I'm going to ask um brother Pedro you want to come up and open up and pray for us bro it's good to see

all lunches afterwards of course everyone's welcome next door amen who's I feel real charge of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah let's go to the book of Ephesians today amen we're going to read from verse uh so chapter 5 and verse uh is this going yes this going uh chapter 5 and verse verses 20 to 33 and um I got a few things together I'm just kind of trusting the Lord will put it all together just right amen we enjoyed the service on Wednesday and um amen Our God's working hallelujah amen so we thank the Lord amen so we reading from Ephesians 5: 20 down to 33 giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ submitting elves one to another in the fear of God wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ as the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the C sorry therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing by the of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hateth his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body and of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband now this is not just for married people today okay hallelujah we're all involved in this amen so let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning you want to be remembered in prayed you want to slip your hand up to the Lord amen let's pray gracious Heavenly Father Lord we know there is power in your name to break every chain Lord we've seen you do the impossible over and over again and we're so thankful that you are the same yesterday today and forever Lord you still do those things my god father you still step forth and break chains and heal wounds and fill with the Holy Ghost and bring Salvation and deliverance and healing and restoration and father we're in your presence this morning Lord so I pray you'll just take complete control for your glory Lord every Spirit that's not of you may it be bound in the name of Jesus Christ father may you have such Liberty all of our hearts Lord we open our hearts to you that you would do what you want done father in the name of Jesus Christ Lord that You' be glorified Lord we love you we thank you be with those who couldn't be here today Father be their abundant portion too Lord remember brother Phil in hospital Lord in the rehab continue to touch his body and raise him up father and anyone else who's sick who's not here Lord be their portion too Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats uh this morning so I'm going to speak about love respect and entitlement and we'll get to all those I'm going to behave today actually get to all of them today so now we are we are reading here you know it's amazing the Apostle Paul where where he would come down and speak about husbands and wives and and and paralleling it to Christ and the church and and and if you look into the Apostle Paul's writings he uses this word mystery quite a few times he uses it mainly in the book of Ephesians but there's only one thing that he calls a great mystery and that is and that is the Union between husband and wife representing Christ and his bride so if if now I believe when the Apostle Paul wrote these words it wasn't him writing it it was almighty God so if it was almighty God writing this and he's emphasizing this as a great mystery then I think we should pay attention to these things amen so it's very important that we look into these and you know we see because we got to understand that you know it's amazing that the Apostle Paul well actually God would put his finger on this and he would you know because you think about it when you talk about marriage you talk about the Christ in his church and you know he could he could um put a lot of different uh Commandments or words you know instructions to give but he placed it on two things men love your wives as Christ loved the church H wives amen give reverence to your husband submitting but you see now the the the instruction really begins out by submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of the Lord so so it takes two for this picture to be complete and and how we fulfill out because remember we've got scripture to fulfill and these scriptures that we read it's really up to say you know it's not me to to to to put this upon my wife saying you've got to submit you've got to reverence me you got to obey no that's her scripture to fulfill right that's the the you know that's her commission my commission is to love her as Christ loved the church amen right so we've got to fulfill our scriptures see there's a lot of scriptures we don't want to fulfill we want to be gossips we don't want to be busy bodies we don't want to be proud arrogant blasphemers we don't want to fulfill any of that scripture we want to fulfill this scripture amen we want to so there's some things you want to avoid like the plague in the Bible right but there's some scripture you say Lord May ody that because someone's going to live this someone's going to live it see God wants a people that live his word or they allow his word to live through them so someone's going to fulfill this so I say Lord here I am make me live it Lord cause me delivered amen so so this is a great mystery now so we're to submit ourselves one to another the reason I believe that the Apostle Paul would put these two things down as as as husband um husbands love love your wives as Christ loved the church is because he's saying these are the more the more difficult things to do it's easy for a man to go get a job and provide some of the gener older generation saying amen but it's easy to get a job it's easy to go through the motions and you know have a home and provide and work and do those it's easy to go through the motions but where's your heart in it many times the Lord's dealt with me saying you have detached yourself from your family from your wife from from you know you you you're just going through the motion so it's easy to go through the motions but where's the love where's actually the you know your your all your attention all the that you are is upon them you see Samson Samson did not fulfill the scripture cuz he gave his heart to Delilah but he gave his strength to God it was easy for him to give his strength to God because it made him look good you see and it's easy for men they'll do things that make them look good look at me look at how great I am providing money whatever wealth and all these things but those are that's not the main thing you see brother Braham gave her two he gave two examples of two married couples one was a very rich married couple they were multi-millionaire families and all these things and another one they they they were living in a box car and he went and checked up on them and you know he slipped up to the rich house and he heard the fussing and the fighting before he probably even got on the section I don't know he knocks on the door you know and and he sees them start to start behaving and you they were fussing about the things they were doing the night before and you know but they they put on a pretense that all was well but then he went down to the Riverside and he and he and and and and he went to the box car where the very poor couple lived and she was sitting on his lap and they were going over the money they had and see his heart was in his wife all that he was was in his wife he wasn't just going through the motions to look good he said honey I saw that dress in the window I want to buy it for you and can we afford it they're doing all she he was involving her in all of his decisions see it wasn't her down here and he up here no he had a revelation that we are in this together we are joint ears together amen so you see he just give his strength to his wife or whatever he gave his heart he gave everything so he was loving he was loving uh her like Christ loves the church that's amen and then brother Braham slipped away from that didn't even go on the door he saw they happy he said now who was the rich man who was the who was the wealthy man he said I'd rather live in the Box Car and have that kind of a home that up there with the palace and have a fussing fighting kind of a problem you see so it's easy it's easy for men to give their strength but what about our heart what about you see you see man remember God before there was anything was alone with his thoughts and the de and remember man was made in the image of God that's right right the devil wants to put us men back alone with our thoughts that's right he doesn't want us to express ourselves as we should to our families to our loved ones right cuz God remember God's whole purpose was I want a family I want someone to share life with I want to walk with her I want to know her I want to express all that I am to her I want to build a build memories with her isn't that what he's done with you that's why he called you before you even knew you're a Believer knew you before you even knew God God knew you and he sought you out he found you you may have been raised on a Pew it doesn't matter where you from he found you he says I want to walk with you I want to know you I want to experience life with you I want to build memories with you amen and see this is God right this is what how God wanted to be now if that's how God is that's how men should be right give their lives give all that they are their whole ambition be Lord I want a family I want to I want to have a I want to build memories with with the other part of me but you see now it's amazing with the book of Ephesians because you know if you look at the book of Ephesians you know God writes things in a particular order and he would start in chapter one saying you know how they sealed to the day of their Redemption that he'd speak about Christ's position then it begin to speak about the believer's position it'd come into you know uh chapter 4 and he'd say about you know how there's the five-fold ministry till we come to the Statue of the perfect man and you know how we're the body of Christ then it comes down to chapter 5 we're just reading about the great mystery that's in marriage about Christ and his church then he goes into chapter six about putting on the whole armor of God now to me the order of this is very important because if you really want to use the armor to be the if you want to have the armor you've got to know your position right you got to know your position not just in Christ but also your your office in the home amen right it's very this is why it's a great mystery so you see so we can't just put these things over lightly we got to actually look into these things and say well a husband is actually a position as an office right and a wife is an office in a family too and if you can't respect the person in that office you've got to respect the office and you got to realize when you got married you you chose that person to be in that position whether you like oh well they don't they don't deserve it well you still put them in that position amen so and and they may be out of cada but you but you've got a responsibility Lord I want to possess the office if I'm going to be a husband I'm going to be a one that gives my whole life for my family I'm going to love them like you loved me Lord amen if I'm a wife well I'm going to be the best wife there is I'm going to fulfill I'm going to fulfill I'm going to if I can't respect the man I'll respect the office see this is an age where men are run down women run down marriages run down right just just made a common just a thing that's got no value to it but God puts great value upon it you see so we can't just we can't just look at these things and say Well it don't matter no it belong it it it very much matters you see if we go into um as I said here that you see that um see men need to have a revelation that their wives are part of them right you need to have that Revelation if you got a revelation that you're part of the word then you should have a revelation that your wife is part of you and vice versa of course you see we're not too like Christy and I we're not too people anymore we're one right you know uh well if I'm standing on toes I'm going to stand on them okay but you see now some some husbands get offended when visitors come to their house and their wife serves serves the visitors before them and I think that makes no sense because because if your wife is part of you then that's you serving the visitor amen so if the coffee if you're last in the coffee line praise God because you want to make your visitors feel welcome right but if you get offended well why is she paying particular attention to them and looking after them well that's your heart being expressed right so if you have a revelation you're one well what she does I do what he what I do she does Hallelujah prise the Lord we one baby you see but but you need that Revelation now this is you and Christ as well right CU you realize what he did you fallen near to amen amen he purchases your salvation on Calvary he's fallen a to All Things amen so so if he has fallen a to all things then I am a joint ear cuz we're one right we're not two we're not oh Lord I'm trying to earn something from you no no no no he earned it all now I get to enjoy it all because he earned it all amen you so you see this is very to me very important now I perh not glossing over these things but you see now it says now that the wife see that she reverence her husband now in the Bible in basic English he says yet I insist that um that among you also each men is to love his own wife as much as he loves himself if men don't love their wives they don't love themselves you actually detest your own self if you detest your wife if you push her down that's how you feel right if you're actually a person who is actually uh engrossed in yourself then you love your wife right if you're selfish don't love her like you really should love her right but if you're actually a self-absorbed person in the right way you love her and pour all your affection everything upon her all right and let a married woman see to it fit that she treats her husband with respect now isn't it interesting when you think about this where you know it's easy it's easy for us even you know now now this is just Believers too as well not just not just wives That's why I say it applies to everyone now it's easy to to raise our hands we had a tremendous ship service this morning it's easy to raise our hands and sin get caught up in the atmosphere and be blessed and feel touched but it's easy to do that easy to say that we love but where's the respect for God's word you see love love love human love is not God you know the love of God if we have a deep if we have a deep cc to reverence it means to have a deep respect for someone or something is to regard or treat it with deep respect and really think you if you really have a revelation what God has done for you how can you not treat him with utmost respect with utmost reverence because remember God's Sovereign God's Sovereign you didn't choose Jesus told his disciples I you didn't choose me I chose you yes sir right he made it very clear to them you did not choose me didn't matter what ambition you had what you wanted to be you whatever you whatever you thought you didn't choose me I chose you so if we have if we really realize that that God chose us amen he he said I'm going to choose them I'm going to look through time they're mine they're part of me they're coming home to me they're going to walk with me I'm going to know them because I have decided and when God decides something nothing can change his mind now if that anchors into our hearts I think God how can we not worship you because you are God we don't worship him because of the because of the blessings I just want him amen if if he never answers another prayer my whole life and everything goes totally to ruin I'll still love him cuz he is God Amen job worshiped God cuz God was God wasn't cuz he had the Hedge and the money the wealth and all those things no God was God that's why he worshiped him and we must be the same but this world is so entitled we'll come to it I was want to drop it in this world feels so entitled and we can't let that Spirit come in among you and I well I deserve something what do you deserve what do I deserve did I deserve deserve Heaven no did I deserve a Rapture absolutely not did I deserve overcoming power no but says I choose to give it to you Hallelujah so we should have a very deep respect for the word of God Amen Let Your worship you know worship actually in the Bible means actually a prostrating down means a bowing down that doesn't actually mean a singing singing is part of it but it's not worship really it's a surrendered life sir am mean so if you really want to be a worship you need to have a surrendered life amen cuz you'll be a prisoner to one or two Powers now see if see if I can find this here you're prisoner to one or the other oh if I can't find it Well I can't find it yeah I can't find it it'll come up later you're a prisoner to one or the other you're worshiping one or the other you're worshiping Satan or you're worshiping God there's only two Satan comes with many brands logos and things but there's only two and he's very religious which one do you want to be which one do you want to give reverence to this world gives a lot of reverence to a lot of thing a lot of wrong things I won't go there I want to but I won't go there now so we must give deep respect and reverence to the word of God see if we're really going to reverence him like a wife is to reverence a husband because remember he's done nothing wrong to us and even if even if okay I just I just put out there just just for argument sake your husband is the most useless slacker was of space is ever existed upon the Earth he's still your husband he's still your head you can't you can't wake up and or text him this you got to love me like Christ Lov the church come where are you come be a man no you've got it that's his scripture to fulfill right and he must get that Revelation that's right right he must get that Revelation how well how does he get that revelation you fulfill your part of the scripture right then God can begin to deal amen but if we see see God God doesn't God wants us to walk in confidence with who we are amen he doesn't always want us being clinging and oh help me and all these no he wants us to be confident people if we don't feel him we praise him if we feel him we praise him if we whatever's going on we praise him that you that's a real wife amen Shadrach Meshach and ab bedo didn't feel nothing got thrown in the furnace Daniel I don't know what he felt but he got thrown to the Lion's Den you know all these we don't have to feel his PR I need to know that he's that he's with me he told you he's with you I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee do he believe his word is he trustworthy enough to you he should be amen I oh my amen you see so we shouldn't get worked up when things are going sideways no we've got an office to possess hallelujah amen brother br would give a give a story of a woman and she had a husband that was a drunk and and he was sitting at the bar one day was in Jeffersonville and and and and he was sitting at the bar one day with some of his friends and the topic of Christianity came up and one of his friends said they're all Hypocrites there's no such thing as real Christians no more but he said just a minute there's one that I know well who's that it's my wife you see she became salty he was catching all the time he was catching it all the time maybe not lit on nothing but he was catching it all the time why because she had a revelation he's my husband he's my head I'm going to reverence him right right so she was becoming salty and he said no she's still a Christian she's a real Christian I'll prove it to you let's go home we act real drunk we ask for some food we'll just cause a bunch of trouble we'll cause a Ruckus right and then so they go home he said you they're acting all drunk sprawling around and all these things I'm not reading that but you can read it if you want I'm just I'm just telling you the story you know they come in the three of them or four of them all drunk acting they come in and he says I want some I want some bacon and eggs and so she goes in makes makes his his guests feel welcome first and you know puts them there and then and then you know she goes and Cooks the bacon eggs brings it out and you know he looks to that says you know you know I don't like them like that picks up the plate throws it against the wall now she's salty she has already made up her mind she made up her mind I'm going to be a real chrisan amen just like Jesus in The Garden of Gethsemane he didn't quit cuz things got too hard that's right whatever pain he had to feel he was going to feel it whatever anguish had to go he was going to go he already sold out Daniel shadra mesach when they left Jerusalem they said we're serving God what's going to happen don't know we're serving God right so so he threw the eggs against the wall he said come on boys just go out here and you know they were you they were they were they were there then they could hear hear her snubbing to herself and crying to herself singing in a real low voice must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me this consecrated cross I'll bear Till Death Shall Set Me Free and one drunk looked at the other she's a Christian she's got it amen you see we should not treat the other based on how they treat us that's not Christianity remember when we were yet the enemies of God how did he treat us true he went Calvary Hallelujah he bore our sin sorrow shame pain all those things upon himself and went up Calvary when we were his enemies amen so if that's how he if that if that's how he was how can how can we not reverence him and respect him but you see we should not treat each other treat family based on how they treat us sure there Comes A Time if you can't live peaceably all those things okay we won't go into those things now but you got to understand we should possess the office that we are ordained to stand in amen and we can't we can't live isolated within ourselves within a family we've got to realize that there's power in our positions now amen now Peter would say here he'd say likewise ye wives being subject to your own husbands that if they obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation which is the manner of life of the wives while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear whose adoring let it not be with outward adoring of plating of the hair or wearing of gold or putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart and that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price for after this manner in the old times the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being subject to their own husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters ye are as long as you do well and be Not Afraid with any amazement likewise he husbands dwell with them according to knowledge don't just live in the same house dwell with them according to knowledge understand what or at least try to understand what they're going through that's half the battle one right there try and understand you say I don't understand the Men Are from Mars and women are from Venus well no but a yes in a way because we are different Spirits men have masculine Spirits women have feminist Spirits remember when Adam Adam was both inside he was both man and woman Eve was taken out of Adam not just a rib and then made into a body but but that feminine part of himself was expressed right and now men and women have two different brains we'll leave that there you can fill in the blanks but you see we must dwell with them according to knowledge men we can't dwell in our nothing box all the time we can't live at our nothing box all the time you say it's a comfort zone Comfort zones are dangerous man that's true Comfort zones are very dangerous they're actually foolish places to live in right we got to go beyond our comfort zone am because it's because it's when you go beyond the comfort zone that's when God can step in and take over in your life amen we must go beyond the comfort zone so we can't live at our nothing box all the time amen spend less time there that's right amen okay amen I agree with you hallelujah amen hey don't be afraid to say Amen do you want more from your spouse amen do you want a better relationship amen amen do you want more of them amen praise God so let's join in together shall we this is not pitchforking hey we're going to take ownership of the word we're going to let our part be fulfilled in our lives it's not well if they do this I do that no did Christ come to you and say uh are you going to serve me okay I'll die you I'll redeem you no he did it before you even knew anything about anything amen so dwell with them according to knowledge see we can't shut off and our nothing box and our phones we can't build a world to ourselves within our hearts we can't do that see we must dwell with them according to knowledge you must at least try and understand what they're going through right and giving honor unto the wife you got to give honor to her yeah she's not a second class citizen we're not second class citizens in heaven we are joint ears with Christ amen so as high as he is we are as high as he is he has a name above every other name we're called by that name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we're join is with Christ we're not second class citizens we're not under the law if you're a man who's actually under the law I'm in the message that means nothing that just means you're more responsible because you know the truth right but you see if a man is under the law his wife will be a second class citizen in the house she won't be shared with she won't be spoken to she'll just be woman know your place that place is join is with you you got to realize what her place really is you she is one with you that's her place just like our place is one with the Lord right are we all okay don't don't don't don't don't Cur your toes up in your shoes just just relax we'll get somewhere okay we're going to have lunch eventually just just just relax say God I want more of you amen cuz these things the issues of the heart are the biggest deal now in the end time it's the biggest thing in the end time our God sent a prophet we know that we we've received that oh baptized the name of Jesus Christ come on man one God of course right but it's the issues of the heart because it's the same thing in jesus' day people look the part they played the part but they weren't the part on the inside see and that is the thing with the foolish virgin they get left behind cuz they looked the part but they weren't the part on the inside they didn't have the oil on the inside they can quote the quotes quote the scriptures live the life to a degree but the issues of the heart need needed to be addressed every door had to come open so if you're getting frustrated husbands in your in your in your prayer life in your walk with God you've got a you're realizing your you got to realize your prayers are being hindered because of your conduct because of how you treat your wife like I said if you're under the law your wife will be a second class citizen because under the law women in isra were second class to the men right even when here I I've gone over these things but we but here we are again we're on repeat right so when when you know it was shown in the temple right the Gentiles could come a certain distance to the holy of holies but they couldn't come as close as the Israelite women who could come closer to the Gentiles but then they couldn't come as close as the men right and then after that was the priests they could come closer than everyone else and then it was of course the high priest going into the holy of holies once once a year right but it was showing there that the women were not were not on the same level as the men under the blood of balls and goats okay but you see under the blood of Jesus Christ there's not Jew or Gentile Greek free Bond whatever we're all one in Christ male female we're all one and isn't it amazing that Peter had to write these words because he was writing to the dispersed Jewish Believers and of course it applies to us today as well that you must dwell with them because according to knowledge because you are ears together in the grace of life so you're joint ear everything you've received she's received amen amen that your prayers see you see give give honor unto them as unto the wicked vessel as being eared together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered all right amen so we need to realize these things husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church I'm just having a brief conclusion before we go to part two okay husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it so he didn't say husbands provide and that's it husbands live in the same house but live a separate life from your wife he didn't say that he said love her as Christ has loved you and gave himself right so really nothing wrong with Hobbies okay but what should be your main Hobby in life family wife oh my we're gonna have a series I think not living to your own self part I don't know how many but that's how it's got to be see this world is condition see we live in a in a in a pleasure seeking world and it's been a few generations of it right it's all about me and what do I do and what do I do with my free time right and sure we should have a hobby nothing wrong with Hobbies go have a hobby keep it CLE keep it in the word all those things but what's your main when you're with your family with you know what's going on in here are you thinking about you time can't wait to get out and I can do I can do and this is a prison and no or praise God I'm in My Sanctuary praise God I'm with those who are part of me I love being gathered around the dinner table with my family actually brings me to tears quite a lot I just feel so happy here's my family Hallelujah here's a family God gave me here's parts of me I can look into their faces and see a bit of me I can see some clones and some mummy clones and it's great praise God right I don't enjoy that time say God change my heart so I enjoy that time hallelujah amen may I cherish family time oh my but my family's like this and this and this well if you look in the mirror you find you're the same way they're just oh my dad's like this and you do the same thing oh my mom's like this and you do the same oh my sister's like this well you do the same thing come on man I'm sorry there's a family St that goes and whether you like it or not you've got the same thing I'm adopted no you ain't you're just like them I don't like them what do you like yourself God gave you the well my family is not ideal God gave it to you but it's not a perfect family none of us are perfect amen we don't have angels's wings we all need more of God oh but if my family was like this then I could overcome how many Believers in the Bible stood alone David as we heard I think on Wednesday David wasn't even invited to when when when Samuel came to J's house he wasn't even considered he would have just been the annoying little brother but he had God on his side he was ordained to be king amen that did not stop him fulfilling his scripture amen the prophet came out of a Bootlegger's family no religion whatsoever did that stop him no no no cuz he gave his life to the Lord the Lord transformed him so we can't say well everything yeah no actually everything is stacked for you cuz if God be us who can be against us don't let the devil get it in your mind I can't be changed I can't be fixed my problems my my my what about his blood his salvation his deliverence amen what about the power of God that worketh mightily hallelujah thank you Lord amen well I came out of a messed up home we all came out of messed up homes our first birth was a mess I'm not just talking about physically spiritually it was a mess we came in the world with a with a with a satanic nature Fallen human nature that was lost lying stealing cheating selfish all these things it was a mess we were a chaos of a life but then God came in and said I'm going to transform you into my image I'm going to make you how you were meant to be in the beginning amen so we can't say that no we our our circumstances are all wrong no there's nothing too hard for God we cannot put anything in the too hard basket for God oh but he can't change me that's a devil's lie let's just just just put it straight out there if if there's any feeling thought that comes into your mind that's negative towards towards the word of God that God can't do it that ain't God putting that thought in your mind that's not even you thinking that that's the devil trying to rob you of a blessing amen hallelujah all the church is full of Hypocrites you go to school you go to your job you go to the mall you go to the supermarket that don't stop you you still go you enjoy it not school you can enjoy school you can let's leave anyway you can hey I went to boarding school I enjoyed it I did sorry I enjoyed it was fun would you do it again no would you send your children children oh no no sir but yet I enjoyed it at the time so it's all perception see oh my oh my but you see we're living in perilous times we're living in entitled times know this also in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers in conent Fierce despises of those that are good traitor heady high-m minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away that's a portion of scripture I want nothing to do with okay that's not me and Lord if that's me change me that it's not me amen amen you know people ask questions was Esau saved was Cain saved all these things what about you the devil wants always put out well what about those people in the Bible what about you yeah what about you you say well Cain Cain couldn't get salvation he could have got it God actually said just do like your brother you'll be accepted what about Judas what about you you know what about you because at the end of the day we're going to stand before the great white throw in judgment or not I pray not if you're the bride you don't and you're going to be judged and all those excuses are not even going to be in the room yeah so let let let's let us let God change us that this is not us hallelujah see them now I just want to put this and we kind of go we're kind of going towards entitlement now we've kind of summed up fulfill your scripture right fulfill your scripture wives reverence respect your husbands as you do the word of God I say if you don't respect if you don't love your wife you don't love God in a Godly way right if you don't respect your husband you don't respect the word right but you see this world has been conditioned that this has become very much the norm he says Moses give away to that what did he give away to and he set his faith and his faith paralyzed the world world he gave away to the prophecy that he was ordained to fulfill he says either your faith will paralyze glamour or either the glamour will paralyze your faith so this world that shiny things will either paralyze your faith or your faith will paralyze its influence in you which one do you want I want to be a Moses I want to be a believer that the faith of God in their hearts paralyzed the shiny things and the and the nonsense things and the things of this world that won't matter and don't really matter oh but if I don't check my social media the world's going to end try it as the world going to go and panic and you're going to be headlin news oh bendon check his social media this day the stock market's gone down and the world's Nature's just no the world's going to continue on but I have to you know the problem is is the have to is a spirit in you feeding on oh I've got to do you have to is your life you know what's really going to happen here I've got to anyway so let a let let our faith paralyze the world now entitlement Webster tells us it's having a right to certain benefits or privileges it's a state or condition of being entitled it's a right it's a right to benefits especially um specified especially by law or by contract it's a belief that one is deserving entitled to certain privileges now that's more in the positive sense but in a negative sense an entitled person is a selfish person they think they deserve special attention and even if I just have this a a self- entitled person is a person that un a lot of people have this Condition it's a very bad condition to have amen we need treatment for for for feeling self-entitled now a self let's just go to signs of self-entitled people this is what just Google told me Google's not always wrong it's a need for special treatment why don't why doesn't the pastor spend more time with me maybe because he's busy I haven't seen him for about three months I'm sorry call me up I'm just using me as an example I should have special treatment High demands I demand selfishness lack of gratitude someone who's self-entitled they just take things for granted I know give give someone a present that they feel self-entitled well I should have got a present there's no thankfulness Associated as a victim mentality I'm the victim here do you know who the first self-entitled person was Adam that's right because when Adam fell I mean the last the last thing he did as a Son of God his position was trying to redeem his wife the first thing he did as a fallen Son of God was blame God for his problems God the woman you gave me caused me to do this sure I'm the I'm the head sure I'm you know you told me what tree not to eat and eat and all those things you know not eat but God you set me up God you set me up to fail God this is what he's telling him come come on you go read the book of Genesis the woman you gave me who caused this problem you God points all his fingers that way that's why I always do this I don't do that because three fingers point back to you he says God it's your fault I'm in this predicament and maybe God will scratch his head go No I gave you free moral choice and this is where your free moral choice took you and you're not willing to own up to the consequences of your free moral choice believing that the rules and Norms do not apply to them how many people do you hear I trust no one actually praise God oh yeah the word says this yeah but I'm special it doesn't apply to me I don't have to I don't have to live that script I don't have to do that that's self-entitled no the word applies to everyone in the same measure to the same degree expecting others to cater to their needs and desires feeling entitled to speak special treatment or privileges becoming angry or resentful when they do not get what they feel they deserve my my taking credit for others work or accomplishments blaming others for their failures or shortcomings I pray with all I know I know I'm bringing jokes in because I want to because it gets a bit heavy so just lift the atmosphere a bit and all these things right but I pray none of us live this right if you see yourself on here there's Mercy to take this nature out of you yes not looking at anyone in particular see a self- entitled person thinks they are awesome this man would Jesus would tell of the of the story of two men going to the temple to pray one was a Pharisee and he prayed thus with himself self see a self a self-entitled person is caught up with their own self I'll just put the scripture up if you don't believe me here this the Pharisees stood and prayed thus with himself God I thank thee I'm not as other men are self-entitled person uh Compares you know just like a family they talk about their wife why can't you be like sister so and so why can't you be like brother so and so no this is your family God put you together amen right we don't compare the Bible says if we compare ourselves among ourselves we become unwise so if you're comparing your paycheck your car your house your job your family your children your church your walk all those things with someone else guess what you ain't wise you're foolish so we're not we're not called to compare ourselves I'm not as other men are look how great I am extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this Publican they've always got someone to point out which is worse than them I look at all these things he says he does I fast twice in the week I give tithes of all that I possess see this is a man who does reverence God this is not a church that it does not reverence God it reverences himself he respects what he does oh I'm in the message the devil's in the message too he's here to fight we shouldn't be shocked and come on the Devil comes to church before you turn up he gets kicked out a lot and we'll continue to do that right but he causes trouble you know you say well I believe the word of God the devil believes it too James says you believe in one God you do well the Devils also believe and tremble right so it's not about what we do that matters and the publicans standing a far off could not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smoted upon his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner I tell you this man went down to his house Justified rather than the other for everyone that exalts himself shall be aase and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted am mean so one went in saying look how entitled I am because of what I do I pray I fast twice a week look at all these things God I'm glad I'm not like other people he just prayed it within himself so maybe maybe in reality he he he he maybe even walked in humbly God bless you brother God bless you Sister praise the Lord great to be here today but in his heart I'm number one I'm the best I'm the best you see but this Publican when he prayed when he said be merciful to me a sinner that that phraser he um uh scoffield says that he's saying look upon me as you look upon The Mercy Seat when the blood's applied that's what he's crying out you see so here's a man who doesn't feel entitled here's a man who feels entitled I'd say which one would be a better husband not him if you need help with that cuz he doesn't feel cuz the Publican is the one who does not feel entitled at all but he went home Justified Now isn't it amazing people get offended when they don't get special treatment they think I deserve better treatment than this our lord Jesus was invited to a feast one day he always goes where he's invited he knew the treatment he was going to receive when he walked in the door he now you think about it here is the Lord Of Glory yeah he ain't just a prophet he ain't just a holy man he ain't just good a good church member he ain't just a a Believer he's God Emmanuel God With Us is invited to a feast and there he goes in his feet aren't washed he's not made welcome he would have no doubt seen an the the the a row of guests in front of him they come in one by one their feet are washed they kiss made welcome they're anointed all these things he sees it happen to them it doesn't happen to him does he go off in a huff and say I am entitled to better treatment than this don't you know who I am don't you know how long being a Believer all these no he doesn't say nothing he sits in his allocated place oh God help us may we never be offended by how people treat us may we never be offended saying I deserve better we deserved Hell by the way but God rich and mercy found us amen so there he was amen and he he did not feel entitled right he went anyway he received the treatment he received and he did it all with grace and the love of God how about you and I well I'm in the message and I preach and I no no no no do amen we can't feel like we're inti he would say to he would say birds have nests foxes have dens but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head he could have spoken a world into existence he could have created a palace made of pure gold and lived in it yeah cuz he was he is the creator himself did he did he feel entitled to the those things no he didn't if there be any consolation in Christ I'm kind of I'm about to close if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any bowels of mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love according uh being of one Accord of one mind but let nothing be done through Strife or V Vang Glory the Pharisee in the temple that's vain Glory look how great I am I I got so much re right now everyone should just bow down and be in awe of everything I'm about to say that's entitled man you know brother R makes a statement if you want to see how important you are put your finger in a bucket of water and pull it out and try and find the hole God don't need to put a finger and he he can just say Let There Be it or whatever and it'll just part but we put you know maybe we should pass a bucket around sometimes when you're in a huff and a puff and annoyed at your family and church and everything that's going on just get a cup of water put your finger in it pull it out and just you really realize I'm actually trying to make you laugh cuz I want you to I want this to go in because people are my rights and my M you know people protest and get mad and all these stuff and put your finger maybe we should go next next next protest March we'll just go with the back of water in front then we'll go up to Parliament honorable member sir put your finger in sir we ain't nothing brother R makes a few statements God don't need us we need him God will fulfill his word if he doesn't use us he'll use someone else God's going to fulfill this word this scripture will be fulfilled if it's not going to be through you and I it's going to he'll raise up someone else to F fulfill his word amen amen if us as a church will not fulfill his word is what a church should be he'll raise up another one that's it oh he wouldn't do that won't he God has determined he's going to have a testimony and if we ain't going to be it it's going to be someone else I said God Don't Pass Me By I want to fulfill your word because you're so good to me hallelujah oh does that make you scared now it makes me reverence him because he chose me as I said a while ago amen thank you Lord amen but in L loneliness of Mind Let each esteem uh other better than themselves look not to every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also Al in Christ Jesus see we have to let this mind that's why that's why Paul wrote it like this way you've got to surrender that the mind of the word the mind of the spirit has preeminence remember this body ain't converted you're walking around in an unconverted animal doesn't matter how strong fit beautiful whatever you are it's unconverted this this guy this flesh that's why there's always a battle between the inner man and the outer man amen but this this this outer man sure we live with this thing but it shouldn't rule us amen just like our homes should not rule us we live in our homes our homes are serve to serve a purpose I'm going to leave that there I'm not going Segways but you see this thing should serve a purpose what is that to to walk with God these five senses don't contact God it's faith that contacts him but we are living in this body see what do you do this unconverted thing you drag it into the Waters of baptism right you give its heart to the Lord or you give your heart to the Lord the human nature is still unconverted right but one day this unconverted man will thank you because he will be changed because your body will be changed amen and he will praise you and say thank you that you caused me to do those things when I did not feel like it you said you're coming anyway amen hallelujah so that your body's going to thank you one day thank you Lord amen hallelujah who being in the form of God look at look at look at the our great king who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but to but made himself of no reputation he said the son can do nothing till the father shows him yeah the doctrine I give you is not my own it's not me that doeth the works as the father dwelleth in me doeth the works see he took no glory the greatest life that was ever lived unmatched in history Hallelujah but he didn't take any Glory of himself he did not exalt himself at all amen he exalted the god of Glory that lived within him amen God was made flesh and dwelt among us but he didn't say look how great I am he said look how great he is that you will praise your father which is in heaven oh we need that mind friends if we just have that mind Lord be glorified in my life Lord I don't want any praise no I don't even want want to be remembered I don't care about me I care about you Lord that when people are come into contact with me they're not impressed by my Humanity nothing I have in my charisma or whatever my wisdom no they're caught up with you that if I cease to be they're still walking with you God Amen that's the mind we need friends that's how we do not become entitled amen when we say Lord you live in my life I'm not interested in me living no more I need you to live amen hallelujah he took upon himself the form of a servant servants just get ordered around what to do and he was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore God also has highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow and of things in heaven things in Earth and things under the Earth amen and and that every tongue so I got a reason for continuing to read here that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it for it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do his good pleasure do all things without murmurings and disputings self-entitled people murmur and dispute right that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation among whom you shine as lights in the world if there was ever a perverse and crooked generation it's this one it's this one right now when they have Blas fous Renditions of the last supper and the opening of the Olympics I say this world's gone nuts there making fun of religion why even if they're making fun of another religion I'd say that's wrong they should be glorifying the nation that's hosting the the Olympics why are they why they mocking Christianity even if they're mocking Islam or Buddhism I'd I'd be upset about that why mock something but you see why it's a perverse and crooked generation that we live in amen that you may be blameless and harmless see blameless as it means deserving no sense you're free from fault or defect so it doesn't mean so that's what that you may be blameless if you do things without disputing and murmuring amen that that you'll be blameless amen and then harmless means it doesn't mean that you don't cause damage because we cause damage you're a wrecking ball baby to wreck the kingdom of hell that's right amen that the that that strongholds of the enemy would be demolished in people's lives that the love of God would bulldo through problems and complexes and unbelief that's what you're built for amen amen unmixed pure as in wines or metals of the mind without mixture of evil free from Gile innocent and simple amen so if you do all things without murmurings and disputings that you may be blameless and harmless we shouldn't murmur we shouldn't be disputing this world is a world full of debate our social media brings the the world together no it divides the world it divides the world look how divided this world is why cuz every man and his dog has an opinion and many times the dog's opinion makes more Horse Sense than the man right but see this world is divided we live in this world that it's like the see we but we don't want to be like this we want to be blameless and harmless amen I just put this here see put get a bucket of water put your finger in pull it out try and find the hole you're nothing God can do without you he can do without me but he can't do but we can't do without him we've got to have him for he is life and he alone amen you see when you see how great he is now not to know him his book but to know this or know that or know a Creed but to know him as life know him as the person Christ in you the word made flesh in you that's knowing him when he you and he become become one like I said last night the super sign he has got to come in you you God and man must must come one you're conscious of your littleness you see we got to come to a place if you want something from God you got to humble yourself self-entitled people do not humble themselves they get annoyed right but if we're really humble we're willing to reach way down amen the woman with the blood issue just like the Pharisees said within himself how great uh he was she said within himself am I if I could but Touch the Hem of His Garment if I can just touch His Garment I'll be made whole amen now she did not stop him and say Jesus stop this whole procession I need to talk to you I have a revelation Jesus that I can get healing from you yeah true I've got Revelation these Pharisees don't have Jesus look at me look what I've got no she reached down yeah if I touch the H of His Garment Hallelujah why cuz she was she was she was humble amen amen she didn't feel self- entitled she had to many times in our hearts going to reach way down Lord I'm nothing without you lord I must have you Lord I need you to come on the scene and change my life amen you look at the woman i' I've got a couple of examples and we'll close here Jesus would go by the coast of Ty and sadon there was a there's a woman of Canaan came out she was a actually a Greek cenan by nation and she cried out have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David now this woman saying things that the Pharisees aren't saying she's got a revelation Jesus you're going to sit on the throne of David in the Millennium now if she was self- entitled when he didn't even say a word she would have got offended oh God didn't answer me that's it I'm getting out of here there's nothing to him if he was really God he'd answer me this way now he answers how he wants to answer he answers when he wants to answer and how he wants to answer it's his prog of how he does it I mean and if he appears silent he's still answering he say that's not fair I want an instant answer you've got to be willing to reach way down and just touch the himem of His Garment oh but I've got Revelation that the Lord he she could have stopped and said Jesus I know you're the son of David he didn't say great is your Revelation have what you want no he knew her faith was great but the reason her faith was great is I mean what how it showed her faith was great was one she did not get she did not Walk Away in a half she came in humility and she was willing to take whatever he had give her amen have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughters grievously vexed with the devil but he didn't even answer her didn't answer a word and his disciples came Bes him saying send her away she crith after us but he answered and said now he's going to open his mouth what's he going to say I'm not sent I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel and now words I'm not here to deal with you I'm not here to talk I'm not even sent to you my commission is not to you you've come at the wrong time did she go away no she her faith really came to its Forefront because it wasn't her Revelation that that that that he's the son of David that really moved him she worshiped him saying Lord help me Hallelujah just those three words Lord help me that really bless me this week just thinking about this see she wasn't self-entitled to me this is the attitude she was reverencing her husband spiritually I'm talking about right but she just said worship saying Lord help me amen but he answered now now look at this to me this is incredible but he answered and said it is not meat to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs you're a dog woman that's what he's saying but she said Lord truth Lord sure but yet the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table Hallelujah did she act self entitled I'm in the message I know he's coming into power in the Millennium I know he's the son of David how many people would stomp off and say there's nothing to this word but see she had a real Faith she said Lord help me what do you go even a crumb Lord I'll take it Lord I'll treasure the crumb hallelujah amen then then he answered oh woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou will and her daughter was made whole from that very hour see we have many Desires in our heart but are we willing to Humble ourselves like she did to get them one way you know a desire is selfish is you don't act like this amen so what are we what are we going to what are we going to do she forfeit for she forfeited all of her rights of how he would treat her are we willing to forfeit all of our rights I talk about husband and wife in the beginning well I have a right he must treat me this way well I have a right she must treat me this way she must serve me this way she must do this are you willing to Forfeit what you perceive as your rights and stand and actually possess the word that's ordained for you to live are you willing to do it because that's how people get the things from God that's how the word actually puts on flesh amen God wants us to be Lambs you see everyone wants the blessings of God but they're not willing to really sell out and forfeit all of their rights that they perceive they have see God wants us to be Lambs a lamb is willing to submit its rights who's ever who's ever um help dock sheep I was a 12-year-old boy friend's father up the east coast of gizman help help them docking picked up the Lamb by the back legs as soon as they know that you've got a tight grip they stop kicking right who's who's experienced that right problem is we kick because we don't know if God really has a hold but as soon as you realize he's got a hold we quit kicking are you willing to be like that kind of a lamb amen that's how a lamb is anyway see well I've got rights brother bam that's true but what are you willing to forfeit your rights are you willing to give your rights that God could Lead You amen that's what's the matter with our churches today and the great majority that the gentleness of the Lamb of God we are supposed to be Lambs we have become everything else but Lambs that's the reason as soon as we get that attitude the dove of the Holy Spirit takes her flight and leaves amen he says look on look down on the altar this is he have a time of prayer altar call and see a lady turning gray a young woman with her head down solid whired woman oh God see this man kneeling different ones along here just repent tell God you're sorry tell him you don't want to do it no more by his grace you'll just let all your differences be done from today on you want to be gentle and quiet you want to be humble and go where he leads you when people say something no matter how right it looks you're going to fulfill your rights to talk about your neighbor I mean you're going to talk you're going to talk about Jesus you're going to do the thing that's right you ain't going like a murderer you ain't going out to jump on the innocent but you see that Gallant play of heroism of real Christians and you want to be like them you don't uh have to tell anybody you're a Christian if you are one they just see it and they know as you talk you're sealed inside and out are we going to Forfeit those kind of a rights well those people did this and they're doing this no no no no no are you willing to fulfill that give it over to God that actually my rights to tear down my spouse or tear down my family or tear down this person I give that because sure as a human being we have rights but those rights don't stand in the presence of God must be willing to give all those things over he would say things like you know it's it's it's my American right to drink and smoke and all these things it may be your American rights or your New Zealand rights but it's not your heavenly rights I mean those are the rights that we must must have amen see it see it it it may be our human rights to to to to be self-centered and be selfish as a human you have a right to be that way but that's not Heavenly rights right that's not that's not Christian rights we willing to fit all those things see if you're willing to fit your filthy right that you have to serve the Lord and will purpose in your heart that you'll not defile yourself with the things of the world he said brother B other Christians smoke why can't I you might have a right to smoke as an American citizen but you do not have a right to do it as a Christian because it's a stumbling block in the other person's way that's exactly right and you shouldn't do it you'll lay a stumbling block are you willing to fulfill all those things who who doesn't want to be a stumbling block here well I can live my life however I want to live my life but your life has an influence on someone else right just like I read the story of the woman who had the drunk husband her life was influence she wasn't living her life for herself she was living life for a far greater purpose that her husband would be saved right and that should be the same thing with you and I that we don't want to lay a stumbling block in front of someone and in self- entitled message believer is a very big stumbling block right we don't want to live that kind of a way amen but we want to be like the Lambs of God we surrender all of our rights to him and let him live that is the only way friends the word will ever put on flesh he say but I dress the part I speak the part I play the part what about in here what about what's going on in here oh but me and my things and my that no no what's going on in here forfit all those things to God I'm now now I'm closing okay give all that to the Lorden he say I deserve to be treated better the Lord Jesus the Lord Jesus let's just look at this the Lord Jesus deserved far better treatment than this he deserved far better treatment than being crucified and being rejected and dying with a broken heart he deserved far better treatment than being spat upon his bed ripped out and M more than any other man the king of glory but did he feel entitled no so I'm come here to fulfill the word this is my purpose on the earth your purpose may not seem glamorous to the world but an eternal purpose am are you willing Hallelujah to give your Allen that his word would live see many people call themselves Christians worship they sing they do all things but for this to live God's looking for this in flesh that's what he's looking for right he's not looking for anything else but that in flesh so I pray God make us that way amen that when that when we read the scripture what says about children husbands wives Family Church we'd say God you made us that you made us that God you have molded us and Chang us that we are that word living then we say thank you Lord cuz you said you'd have a witness in the end time thank you by your grace you've allowed me to be part of that witness it's not my ability not not not my determination nothing I could ever do Lord It's you have ordained me and Here I Am Lord I give my all amen let's have the musicians please this morning ien I kept you for a bit this morning amen let's let's stand amen I want to sing that song I pledge allegiance to the lamb with all my strength with all I am amen you say I've done that before open every door of your heart amen don't don't don't try and rationalize a reason why you hold on to things just give it all up let God take over amen amen are we in are we in D oh it's just D give me a key I don't know amen let's sing this as a prayer shall we this morning amen amen I have heard how Christians long ago they were brought before a Ty strong they were told that he would spare their lives if they would renounce the name of Christ but one by one they chose to Die the
