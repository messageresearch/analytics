[50:38] we had a good time at the camp and yeah

[50:42] that's real good i mean so zechariah
[50:45] three and one we're gonna read down to
[50:46] verse five
[50:49] i don't have a slideshow um today
[50:55] now zechariah three and one now no no
[50:57] just just keep in the back of your mind
[50:58] that zechariah was a prophet to the jews
[51:00] when the temple was being restored to
[51:02] here's a restoration prophet
[51:04] so this is happening during a time of
[51:06] restoration so zechariah
[51:08] 3 and 1 and he showed me joshua the high
[51:10] priest standing before the angel of the
[51:12] lord
[51:13] and satan standing at his right hand to
[51:15] resist him
[51:16] and the lord said unto satan the lord
[51:18] rebuked thee o satan even the lord that
[51:20] has chosen jerusalem rebuke thee
[51:23] is not this a bran plucked out of the
[51:25] fire
[51:26] now joshua was clothed with filthy
[51:28] garments and stood before the angel
[51:30] and he answered and spake unto those
[51:32] that stood before him saying take away
[51:34] the filthy garments from him
[51:36] and he said unto him and unto him he
[51:39] said sorry behold
[51:41] i have caused thine iniquity to pass
[51:43] from me and i'll clothe thee with a
[51:44] change of raiment
[51:46] and i said let them set a fair mitre
[51:48] upon his head
[51:49] so they set a fair mitre upon his head
[51:51] and clothed them with garments and the
[51:52] angel of the lord
[51:54] stood by my lord amen may the lord bless
[51:57] his word you may have your seats this
[51:58] morning and
[51:59] i want to talk about uh so i preached
[52:02] this
[52:02] kind of in in fielding but i kind of
[52:04] changed a little bit so
[52:05] um but i want to preach about defeating
[52:08] the man with the three-edged club now
[52:09] brother brahm has this dream
[52:12] he says let me tell you of a god-given
[52:14] dream i had about triune baptism
[52:17] this was this was not a vision but a
[52:18] dream now this is taken from the church
[52:20] age book
[52:21] you know i am sure that one of the
[52:23] blessings of the church ages was to
[52:25] receive dreams by the holy ghost
[52:27] just the same as one can receive visions
[52:29] it was about 3 a.m on a saturday morning
[52:32] i just gotten up to get joseph a drink
[52:34] of water when i laid down i fell asleep
[52:36] instantly and dreamed this dream i saw a
[52:39] man
[52:40] that i suppose was my father he was a
[52:42] great big burly man
[52:43] i also saw a woman who was supposed to
[52:45] be my mother but she didn't look like
[52:47] her
[52:48] even as the man did not look like my
[52:49] father this man was very mean to his
[52:51] wife
[52:52] he had a large club with three corners
[52:54] on it you know if you take a log and you
[52:56] set it on the end and hit it with an axe
[52:58] it makes a three cornered witch-like
[53:00] piece of firewood
[53:01] it was like that he would take this club
[53:04] and hit her with it
[53:05] and knock her down as she would lay
[53:07] there crying he would walk around with
[53:09] his chest stuck out
[53:10] and on his face with such a proud
[53:12] boastful look that he appeared
[53:14] to take great pride and satisfaction in
[53:16] beating up this poor little woman
[53:18] every time she tried to get up he would
[53:20] hit her i did not like what he was doing
[53:23] but as i was considering stopping him i
[53:25] thought
[53:26] i can't tackle that man he's too big
[53:28] then he's supposed to be my father but
[53:30] down inside i knew he wasn't my father i
[53:33] knew that no man
[53:35] had the right to treat a woman like that
[53:37] and everyone says amen right now
[53:38] i went over and i grabbed him by the
[53:40] collar and i turned him around and said
[53:42] you have no right to strike her
[53:44] and when i said that my muscles grew and
[53:46] i looked like a giant
[53:47] the man saw them and he was scared of me
[53:50] i said you strike her again you'll deal
[53:51] with me
[53:52] he hesitated to strike her again and
[53:54] then the dream left me
[53:56] i woke immediately after the dream i
[53:58] thought how strange that was
[53:59] i wondered why i had dreamed about that
[54:02] woman when suddenly there he came and
[54:04] the prince of god became known to me and
[54:06] the interpretation of the dream came
[54:07] from him
[54:08] now you people know that not only have i
[54:11] interpreted your dreams exactly but i
[54:13] have many times
[54:14] told you what you dreamed so that you
[54:16] never had to tell me
[54:17] the woman represents the church of the
[54:19] world today i was born right into this
[54:21] mess the mess that she is in
[54:23] she is supposed to be a kind of a mother
[54:25] she is the mother of harlots her
[54:27] husband is the denominations that rule
[54:29] her
[54:30] the three cornered block is a false
[54:31] trying baptism unto a trinity
[54:34] every time she started to rise up that
[54:36] means the congregation begins to accept
[54:38] truth he would drive her right down
[54:40] again with that false doctrine
[54:42] he was so great that i was afraid of him
[54:44] at first but when i came against them i
[54:46] found i had great
[54:47] and powerful muscles they were faith
[54:49] muscles the outcome of the dream was
[54:51] that since god is with me
[54:53] and can give me such strength then then
[54:56] let me stand up for her against the
[54:57] denominational power of the world
[54:59] and make him quit striking her now
[55:03] we have read about zechariah you know we
[55:05] read there in zechariah where where
[55:07] joshua was the high priest
[55:09] but satan was there to was resist him
[55:12] from coming to his god ordained position
[55:15] and this spirit here that brother
[55:16] abraham had this dream about this
[55:18] this spirit now has been an antichrist
[55:20] spirit that has been
[55:22] trying to stop the church coming to its
[55:24] god-given position
[55:25] now we can say well we're not baptized
[55:28] in a trinitarian formula you know we do
[55:30] not take on the titles of father son
[55:32] holy ghost but we are baptized in the
[55:34] name of the lord jesus christ
[55:36] but that spirit you know spirits just
[55:38] change their outward form
[55:40] they change their outward form but their
[55:42] intent remains the same
[55:43] so the same the same spirit that tried
[55:46] to destroy israel was the same
[55:48] antichrist spirit that tried to destroy
[55:49] the church
[55:50] it just changed its form now we we know
[55:53] we are living in a time of the breaking
[55:55] of cycles you know there has to be a
[55:57] time
[55:58] where the cycle of revival and death
[56:00] comes to an end
[56:01] and it does not end in death but it ends
[56:03] in revival
[56:04] amen the first you know you we can see
[56:07] the cycle all the way down through the
[56:08] scriptures from
[56:09] from the time of judges down through the
[56:10] church ages you know the first
[56:12] generation they're liber
[56:13] you know they're liberated from demon
[56:15] power they walk in liberty they walk in
[56:17] christ but then
[56:18] but then the revival begins to cool off
[56:20] until the next generation finds itself
[56:22] in bondage again yet religious
[56:24] or they um i mean or they are the next
[56:27] generation
[56:28] you know then then they call out for
[56:30] liberation for god to liberate them god
[56:32] liberates them
[56:33] only for the following generation or
[56:35] even themselves falling into bondage and
[56:37] slavery again
[56:38] cycle of revival and death the prophet
[56:39] tells us never fails
[56:41] but there has to come a time when this
[56:43] finishes
[56:44] hallelujah and i believe now you know
[56:47] that we are living in a time where that
[56:49] cycle will be broken
[56:50] that there will be a revival fire not in
[56:53] just one generation but in every
[56:55] generation
[56:55] so that revival will be burning in me
[56:57] will be burning in my children if the
[56:59] lord should tarry and my grandchildren
[57:01] hallelujah because there should be you
[57:03] know we could have a revival in
[57:04] ourselves
[57:05] i mean the welsh revival wasn't people
[57:08] well it just
[57:08] wasn't in the country it was in people
[57:10] hallelujah so you know we can have that
[57:12] same revival that same holy ghost
[57:14] that poured himself out there and azusa
[57:16] street can pour himself out right now
[57:18] because he's the same yesterday today
[57:20] and forever so now we can say we're
[57:22] living at the end of cycles because
[57:24] we're living at the end of the seventh
[57:25] church age
[57:26] there's no more cycle of church ages to
[57:28] continue there's no eighth church change
[57:30] there's no ninth church age
[57:32] we're at the end the next thing that's
[57:33] going to roll on is eternity so even
[57:36] death will come to an
[57:37] end the cycle of life and death will
[57:38] come to an end where life where death
[57:41] will be swallowed up in victory
[57:42] hallelujah
[57:43] that's the scripture amen so this is
[57:45] what we're looking for so
[57:46] this cycle cannot continue but it must
[57:49] come to an end the same as that cycle of
[57:51] that antichrist spirit coming in and
[57:53] beating down a people
[57:54] that they begin to rise up that cycle of
[57:57] of a people rising up just to be beaten
[57:59] down to raise up again and be beaten
[58:01] down
[58:01] that cycle must come to an end and that
[58:03] cycle is coming in to an end in this day
[58:06] hallelujah i believe that we're a people
[58:08] that you know we can
[58:09] we can actually grab that through egypt
[58:11] club and say satan no more
[58:13] you can't beat me down no more you can't
[58:15] use my past again me
[58:16] you can't use my natural lineage
[58:19] circumstance you can't use nothing
[58:20] against me
[58:22] amen so that now it's very interesting
[58:24] when brother brahm has his dream
[58:26] because he relates it in two places if i
[58:29] can find it and it's just before
[58:31] so so he relates at the week uh of the
[58:34] weekend before he preaches services is
[58:36] the time of the end
[58:37] and the and then he relates it in that
[58:39] sermon as well
[58:40] and we know in that sermon he's you know
[58:42] he's just had the visitation there of
[58:43] the
[58:44] you know he's going to meet the seven
[58:45] angels there you know out west and
[58:47] he's very moved by that experience and
[58:49] you know he thought maybe it's the end
[58:50] of his ministry but it's actually just a
[58:52] continuation of his ministry where the
[58:54] book will come open and
[58:55] you know so he relates now the breaking
[58:57] of the cycle with the word coming open
[59:00] hallelujah because we're living down in
[59:02] this time now
[59:04] as i said a spirit just changes its
[59:07] outward appearance
[59:08] but its intent is always the same
[59:12] now this spirit will fight us until it's
[59:14] thrown into the lake of fire
[59:16] we're not exempt from anything but we
[59:18] have power to overcome everything
[59:21] right so we're not exempt from trials
[59:22] troubles hardship
[59:24] spirits come in whatever it may be we're
[59:26] not exempt from nothing that's in the
[59:27] world
[59:28] but we have overcoming power to defeat
[59:30] that thing hallelujah because
[59:32] because the word says greater is in you
[59:33] that's in the world amen
[59:35] so now if you look at this deed of the
[59:37] nicolaitans
[59:39] down through the church ages it just
[59:41] evolved
[59:42] where it went from deeds so deeds is
[59:43] just well why do you do this oh because
[59:45] we do it this way
[59:46] it becomes a deed and then a few church
[59:48] ages later it became a doctrine it
[59:50] became a fundamental part of the belief
[59:52] system of the church
[59:53] but the lord said he hated this thing
[59:57] and the whole purpose of that spirit was
[59:59] to basically you know we know nicolaitan
[1:00:01] it means to conquer the people so to
[1:00:04] conquer
[1:00:05] a pea a people is very simple you just
[1:00:08] take the holy ghost from them
[1:00:09] you're you replace the living god that's
[1:00:12] living in their lives overcoming power
[1:00:14] with creed and dogma and just going
[1:00:15] through the motion of a religious
[1:00:17] worship
[1:00:18] so so that is that was always the
[1:00:20] purpose of it it was to take the holy
[1:00:22] ghost from the people
[1:00:24] because some people say well the
[1:00:25] nicolaitans was just a sect
[1:00:27] within christianity within the first few
[1:00:29] ages but history says that wasn't true
[1:00:32] it was a spirit antichrist spirit
[1:00:34] worming its way into the church
[1:00:36] to take the overcoming power from the
[1:00:38] people
[1:00:39] it came in subtly it may be sounded so
[1:00:42] good because
[1:00:43] you know the nicolaitan spirit is is
[1:00:45] basically manifested in the priesthood
[1:00:47] or the ministers become different
[1:00:48] greater than the people
[1:00:50] so the holy ghost instead of the people
[1:00:51] being a part of the spiritual worship in
[1:00:53] the church
[1:00:54] the holy ghost are that's just on the
[1:00:55] minister because they're the anointed
[1:00:57] person
[1:00:58] and so it separates the ministry from
[1:01:00] the laity but we're actually all the
[1:01:01] same
[1:01:02] glory i'm glad we're all the same i just
[1:01:04] happen to stand here a bit more than
[1:01:06] some other people but yeah we're all the
[1:01:07] same
[1:01:08] hallelujah so it's not it's not just
[1:01:09] meant to be inspired inspired ministry
[1:01:12] and people trying to grasp but the same
[1:01:13] inspiration that falls on the minister
[1:01:15] should be the same inspiration that
[1:01:16] hears the word through you amen
[1:01:18] transforms our lives together
[1:01:20] hallelujah so how does that begin well
[1:01:23] people begin to lift up a ministry
[1:01:25] and that ministry instead of actually
[1:01:27] know humbling itself and saying you know
[1:01:28] i'm just like you
[1:01:29] they get lifted up in pride and then
[1:01:31] people elevate that man or that woman or
[1:01:33] that person above
[1:01:35] everyone else we must never do that
[1:01:38] because it takes the anointing from the
[1:01:40] people
[1:01:42] and puts it somewhere else we must never
[1:01:45] ever let that antichrist spirit come in
[1:01:48] our midst
[1:01:49] it'll try to elevate someone above the
[1:01:53] people as antichrist
[1:01:55] and to actually say well they're
[1:01:56] anointed i don't need to be anointed
[1:01:58] that's antichrist
[1:01:59] and this spirit is a condescending
[1:02:01] spirit
[1:02:02] it will make young people look like
[1:02:03] they're nothing it'll de-spiritualize
[1:02:06] people that's that antichrist spirit
[1:02:08] working
[1:02:09] trying to de-christianize people as
[1:02:11] nicolaite and move because it's someone
[1:02:13] trying to say i'm greater than you and
[1:02:14] you've got nothing i've got everything
[1:02:16] and trying to dominate people trying to
[1:02:18] get them to make to
[1:02:20] to become subservient to human
[1:02:22] leadership
[1:02:24] we should be subservient to the word
[1:02:27] amen it's a spirit that tries to make
[1:02:29] people inferior of their own christian
[1:02:31] walk and basically de-christianize
[1:02:33] others but you know
[1:02:37] brother brown asked a question who's got
[1:02:40] more power before god sons and daughters
[1:02:42] of god or angels
[1:02:44] and he says in kinsmen redeemer an angel
[1:02:46] is a servant
[1:02:47] that's right they're his servants what
[1:02:49] are you his son and daughter
[1:02:51] who has more power in heaven than a
[1:02:52] sinner that's been saved by grace
[1:02:54] or an archangel that's standing by the
[1:02:56] by his right side the sinner that's been
[1:02:58] saved by grace has more authority in
[1:03:00] heaven
[1:03:00] than an archangel that stood by a side
[1:03:02] without sin because he's a son
[1:03:05] a son has more authority than a servant
[1:03:07] of course
[1:03:08] so someone who just gave their lives to
[1:03:10] the lord but a second ago is more
[1:03:11] authority in heaven
[1:03:13] than gabriel himself or michael or one
[1:03:15] of the archangels
[1:03:16] why because they're sons sons and
[1:03:18] daughters they mean to never ever let
[1:03:20] anyone try and de-christianize
[1:03:22] what the lord has done in your life now
[1:03:23] the devil will be fighting this
[1:03:25] or fighting you trying to push you out
[1:03:27] of your god-ordained position
[1:03:30] amen until he's thrown into like your
[1:03:33] fire
[1:03:34] that's why he tries to push people out
[1:03:35] of ministry tries to push people out of
[1:03:37] doing
[1:03:37] anything in the church tries to just say
[1:03:39] he just tries to make them sit down and
[1:03:41] shut up and just
[1:03:41] warm up you we're not called to warm
[1:03:43] pews we can put the ac
[1:03:45] on and the poos will be warm you know we
[1:03:47] don't need that i mean we all have part
[1:03:49] of this work
[1:03:51] the expectation of the people really
[1:03:53] dictates how
[1:03:54] how a service will be amen because how
[1:03:57] come
[1:03:57] camp is so awesome there's an
[1:03:58] expectation we're going to camp
[1:04:00] and god's going to meet us and he does
[1:04:02] why because he meets our expectation
[1:04:04] we can have that same expectation for
[1:04:06] now hallelujah
[1:04:08] amen or even when you open your bible
[1:04:10] when you pray you have that same
[1:04:11] expectation lord i'm coming to camp
[1:04:14] harley why because what makes camp god
[1:04:16] makes camp
[1:04:17] jesus makes camp camp amen so he'll try
[1:04:21] and
[1:04:21] fight us and you know to try and kick us
[1:04:23] out of our ordained position
[1:04:25] but we have by the authority of god's
[1:04:27] word we've got to kick him off his
[1:04:29] our mountain amen kick him off our
[1:04:32] mountain now
[1:04:33] the bible says in revelations 19 let us
[1:04:35] be glad and rejoice and give honor to
[1:04:36] him for the marriage the lamb has come
[1:04:38] and his wife hath made herself ready and
[1:04:41] to her
[1:04:42] was grounded she should be arrayed and
[1:04:44] find linen clean and white for the fine
[1:04:46] linen is the righteousness of saint so
[1:04:47] it's granted unto a people
[1:04:49] to be arrayed in the righteousness of
[1:04:51] god
[1:04:53] so it's not something we push and push
[1:04:55] out whatever it's actually him saying
[1:04:56] here put on the winning government
[1:04:58] put on this word and something just and
[1:04:59] you just says this fits me real good
[1:05:01] amen hallelujah
[1:05:05] now brother brown says god of this evil
[1:05:07] lady says and when the entire word of
[1:05:08] god incomplete was headed up in the
[1:05:10] human body called jesus christ
[1:05:12] and there uh and and their god made
[1:05:15] me pay for my sins in him there then he
[1:05:18] rose raised me up with him in the
[1:05:19] resurrection
[1:05:20] and now we are seated with him with
[1:05:22] power and authority over every devil
[1:05:25] oh if you could only believe what god
[1:05:27] has given
[1:05:28] but if you're not seated there you don't
[1:05:30] have it and if you're seated there and
[1:05:31] don't believe it and afraid to move
[1:05:33] you'll never use it
[1:05:34] but if you're seated there you'll use it
[1:05:36] for your ordained
[1:05:37] to do what you do i mean so if you're
[1:05:40] seated in heavenly place in christ jesus
[1:05:42] amen
[1:05:43] you'll use it you'll use that position
[1:05:45] hallelujah amen the devil gets on my
[1:05:47] case i just go talk to my daddy
[1:05:50] and my daddy's bigger than his daddy
[1:05:51] hallelujah so my dad's going to beat him
[1:05:53] up
[1:05:54] hallelujah so we don't need to be afraid
[1:05:55] of anything
[1:05:57] hallelujah because he's ordained us to
[1:05:59] sit and in a position
[1:06:01] amen we need to look at now now brother
[1:06:03] man says in christ the mystery god
[1:06:04] revealed the new birth is christ is a
[1:06:06] revelation
[1:06:07] god has revealed it to you this great
[1:06:09] mystery and there and that's a new birth
[1:06:11] now what are you going to do when you
[1:06:13] get all that group together where the
[1:06:14] revelation is perfect in harmony
[1:06:16] and god expressing it through his word
[1:06:18] by the same actions
[1:06:20] the same things that he did making the
[1:06:21] word manifest
[1:06:23] oh if the church only knew its position
[1:06:26] it will one day then the rapture will go
[1:06:28] when it knows what it is so
[1:06:29] yeah the scripture says that we will
[1:06:31] know as we are known and we need to come
[1:06:33] to that place and say god may we know as
[1:06:35] we're known as we're known by you may we
[1:06:37] know
[1:06:37] about ourselves amen because
[1:06:41] remember in our opening scripture he
[1:06:43] already was the high priest
[1:06:44] he did not become the high priest by the
[1:06:46] changing of his garments
[1:06:48] he says that joshua he showed me joshua
[1:06:52] the hype
[1:06:52] he's standing before the angel lord so
[1:06:54] he already was the high priest
[1:06:55] he did not become the high priest by the
[1:06:57] devil being rebuked from him and his
[1:07:00] raymond being changed
[1:07:01] no he already was the high priest but
[1:07:03] god had to come
[1:07:05] i mean we fight a supernatural devil
[1:07:08] how can we overcome a supernatural enemy
[1:07:11] with natural means we cannot do it
[1:07:12] we cannot overcome it by human reasoning
[1:07:15] i mean by intellect it takes the
[1:07:16] anointing it's the anointing that breaks
[1:07:18] the yoke
[1:07:19] amen of the devil amen hallelujah so he
[1:07:22] already was high priest
[1:07:23] but the lord had to come and rebuke this
[1:07:26] enemy that was trying to stop him coming
[1:07:28] into his position and then he received
[1:07:30] the change of ramen to exercise the
[1:07:32] office of high priest i'll just say this
[1:07:34] we already were the bride of christ
[1:07:37] we did not become the bride of christ by
[1:07:39] this message no
[1:07:40] we already were but because we were we
[1:07:43] responded to the word
[1:07:44] just like the eagle in the chicken yard
[1:07:46] when mama came flying over saying
[1:07:48] son flop your wings come up here he did
[1:07:50] not become an eagle because he heard the
[1:07:52] scream
[1:07:52] no the screen made him recognize hey i'm
[1:07:54] an eagle hallelujah
[1:07:56] holy and they're never going to soar up
[1:07:57] into the heavenlies they mean there's a
[1:07:59] call
[1:07:59] up into the heavenlies i mean it's the
[1:08:01] same thing with the lord amen we are his
[1:08:03] we already were his sons
[1:08:05] and daughters the scripture says because
[1:08:07] ye were sons
[1:08:08] you receive the spirit so not you do not
[1:08:11] become you do not receive the spirit of
[1:08:12] god by receiving the holy ghost you
[1:08:14] receive the holy ghost because you are
[1:08:17] if the church only knew what it was it
[1:08:20] will one day than the rapture will go
[1:08:21] amen yes hallelujah
[1:08:24] amen we are ordained see satan was there
[1:08:28] to resist joshua coming into his
[1:08:30] god-given position
[1:08:32] and that same one is trying to withstand
[1:08:34] you
[1:08:35] but we're ordained to overcome now
[1:08:38] brother braham says in the message how
[1:08:40] can i overcome
[1:08:43] overcome means to recognize the devil in
[1:08:45] every one of his tricks
[1:08:47] lots of people say there's no devil it's
[1:08:48] just a thought don't you believe that
[1:08:50] there's a real devil
[1:08:51] he's just as real as you are or anybody
[1:08:53] a real devil and you must recognize him
[1:08:55] real
[1:08:56] you must know he's a devil then the same
[1:08:58] time that you recognize him and know
[1:09:00] that he's a devil and he's against you
[1:09:02] then to overcome you must recognize that
[1:09:05] god the god in you is greater and
[1:09:07] mightier than he is
[1:09:09] that the one that's in you has already
[1:09:11] overcome him
[1:09:12] hallelujah so our lord has already
[1:09:15] overcome all temptation
[1:09:17] all peer pressure all addiction all
[1:09:20] trials
[1:09:22] every culture everything he overcame
[1:09:25] hell death in the grave
[1:09:26] you know we used to play back in days to
[1:09:29] play computer games you say well i
[1:09:30] clocked the game
[1:09:32] well our lord this is probably a bad way
[1:09:34] of saying it but he clocked everything
[1:09:36] he conquered hell death in the grave
[1:09:38] conquered sickness everything he just
[1:09:39] won
[1:09:40] hallelujah so you've got to recognize
[1:09:42] the one in you the holy ghost in you has
[1:09:44] already overcome that devil
[1:09:45] i mean he overcame him in heaven he was
[1:09:47] cast out amen he overcame a noah's day
[1:09:50] moses day elijah's day all the way down
[1:09:52] through hallelujah amen
[1:09:55] amen and by his grace you're more than a
[1:09:58] match for him amen that's real
[1:10:00] overcoming when you recognize
[1:10:02] you look back and say i'm doing this and
[1:10:04] i'm doing that no no you're defeated
[1:10:06] but there's no condemnation to them
[1:10:08] which are in christ jesus that walk not
[1:10:10] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:10:12] then you'll then you realize that you've
[1:10:14] overcome and you know that he's the
[1:10:16] devil you say i've got a sickness
[1:10:18] i i don't believe it's a sickness yes
[1:10:20] it's a sickness
[1:10:21] you've got cancer you well you don't
[1:10:23] believe it's a cancer it's a cancer it's
[1:10:24] a cancer but remember
[1:10:26] greater is he that's in you that he than
[1:10:28] he that's in the world you must realize
[1:10:30] that the holy spirit that's in you
[1:10:33] has already overcome this thing and he
[1:10:35] is in you and you can overcome by him
[1:10:37] that's exactly sensible it's exactly the
[1:10:40] way the scripture is written
[1:10:41] overcoming now to so to overcome i was
[1:10:45] going to take that first
[1:10:46] phrase there is to recognize the devil
[1:10:49] in every one of his tricks
[1:10:51] because he's he's in the job of
[1:10:52] blindsiding people
[1:10:55] amen so you've got to be able to
[1:10:56] recognize every one of his tricks now
[1:10:58] one of the tricks of this day especially
[1:11:01] this age
[1:11:02] is the deception of validating one's
[1:11:05] christian walk or state of their family
[1:11:07] by comparison
[1:11:10] put up put up revelations 3 and we're
[1:11:11] going to read room 14.
[1:11:13] this is a big pressure of the day you're
[1:11:16] going to recognize the devil in his
[1:11:17] tricks
[1:11:19] amen amen amen revelations 3 and 14
[1:11:24] and on and unto the angel of the church
[1:11:27] of the latest years right these things
[1:11:28] say at the amen
[1:11:30] the faithful and true witness the
[1:11:31] beginning of the creation of god
[1:11:34] i know thy works that thou art neither
[1:11:36] cold nor hot i would that thou work cold
[1:11:38] or hot so then because thou art lukewarm
[1:11:41] and neither cold nor hot
[1:11:43] i will spew the out of my mouth because
[1:11:46] thou
[1:11:46] sayest now this is i think the first
[1:11:48] time through the church ages that
[1:11:50] god is actually repeating back to the
[1:11:51] age this is what your confession is
[1:11:53] because thou says i am rich and increase
[1:11:56] with goods
[1:11:57] and have need of nothing now why would
[1:12:01] how can you say your rich increase with
[1:12:02] goods and have need of nothing
[1:12:04] unless there's a comparison because
[1:12:08] to say you're rich increase with goods
[1:12:10] either the ages comparing themselves
[1:12:12] with others
[1:12:13] well i'm richer than this family or
[1:12:15] where this nation's richer than that
[1:12:16] nature
[1:12:17] i mean i mean nation that's a comparison
[1:12:19] or they're comparing what they used to
[1:12:21] be with what they are now
[1:12:22] i was once poor but now i'm rich
[1:12:24] increased with goods
[1:12:25] so there's a there's a comparison
[1:12:28] between either yourself or a former
[1:12:30] state
[1:12:31] so this is a time of comparison
[1:12:35] because they're saying look at what we
[1:12:36] have look what we've obtained we've made
[1:12:38] it i have need of nothing
[1:12:40] amen what because it's a comparison
[1:12:42] thing look at how the churches used to
[1:12:43] be and look what we have now
[1:12:45] i'm so glad we're not what we used to be
[1:12:47] well that's a comparison
[1:12:49] there's only one thing we should compare
[1:12:50] with and that's god's bible
[1:12:53] amen brother brown says in the
[1:12:54] resurrection of lazarus
[1:12:57] a day that we're living in is a great
[1:12:59] matching time
[1:13:00] do you believe that paint your steps
[1:13:02] read and watch all the neighbors they
[1:13:03] get theirs read right away matching time
[1:13:05] everybody wants to impersonate somebody
[1:13:08] else how true that is
[1:13:10] match i always said i don't care whether
[1:13:13] my shoes match my trousers or my shirt
[1:13:15] match my coat
[1:13:16] i want my experience to match god's
[1:13:18] bible when he said you must be born
[1:13:20] again when they receive the baptism of
[1:13:22] the holy ghost on the day of pentecost i
[1:13:23] want that
[1:13:24] i want my experience to match that amen
[1:13:27] amen because if you go into a comparison
[1:13:30] way of
[1:13:31] looking at everything it actually makes
[1:13:33] the blindness
[1:13:34] because they're saying look i'm rich and
[1:13:36] i'm creased with goods i have need of
[1:13:37] nothing
[1:13:38] and knows not that thou art wretched
[1:13:40] miserable poor and blind and naked
[1:13:42] i cancel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[1:13:45] the fire
[1:13:46] that thou mayest be rich in white
[1:13:48] raiment that thou mayest be clothed
[1:13:50] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[1:13:51] not appear anoint thine eyes with eyes
[1:13:53] out that thou mayest see what is that
[1:13:55] seeing the spiritual condition of
[1:13:57] yourself
[1:13:58] not comparing well my walker's better
[1:14:00] than that person's walker i'm glad my
[1:14:01] family's not like this family and my
[1:14:03] children aren't like this children
[1:14:04] that's actually blindness because it's
[1:14:07] carnal
[1:14:07] comparison we are not ordained to match
[1:14:11] one another
[1:14:12] i can even say i'm not your example
[1:14:16] why does he know what he mean right
[1:14:17] there
[1:14:20] i need to say for this is our example
[1:14:23] right joe the apostle paul said follow
[1:14:25] me as i follow christ we understand that
[1:14:27] but
[1:14:27] the word is our example we're to match
[1:14:29] you're not to match with you know
[1:14:31] this church is not here to make little
[1:14:33] ben gloins
[1:14:35] amen we're not even here to be little
[1:14:37] william branhams
[1:14:38] amen we're here to be made in the image
[1:14:40] of christ the word
[1:14:42] i mean that's why the prophet's ministry
[1:14:44] came is that jesus christ will pour
[1:14:45] himself into a people
[1:14:47] and he would manifest his word and a
[1:14:49] people that when god looks down at you
[1:14:50] he doesn't see you he sees himself in
[1:14:52] you
[1:14:53] and which is his word made manifest they
[1:14:55] mean more than an intellectual
[1:14:56] understanding
[1:14:57] more than a debate but a resurrected
[1:14:59] jesus christ a resurrected power
[1:15:01] living in you and i amen this is what
[1:15:03] this is what christianity is isn't that
[1:15:05] god will dwell in people once again
[1:15:07] amen hallelujah amen when you read
[1:15:10] through the epistles and the apostle
[1:15:11] paul is talking about how
[1:15:12] men should be a woman should be your
[1:15:14] children should be you should look at
[1:15:15] that and say
[1:15:16] ah that's living out of me that's right
[1:15:20] amen why because your life is actually
[1:15:22] the interpretation of the scripture
[1:15:24] if the author is in you then your life
[1:15:26] will interpret the scripture your life
[1:15:27] will be a living bible
[1:15:28] don't you want to be a living bible amen
[1:15:31] hallelujah
[1:15:32] well what part are you living ephesians
[1:15:34] galatians no the whole thing
[1:15:36] all that christ is hallelujah amen let
[1:15:39] it be at me
[1:15:42] it's a great matching time now we turn
[1:15:44] to luke 18 and we can see there's a
[1:15:45] matching time
[1:15:46] there's a blindness of a of a worshiper
[1:15:49] in the temple in the
[1:15:50] any uh jesus spake of this parable
[1:15:53] uh unto certain which trusted in
[1:15:55] themselves that they were righteous that
[1:15:57] sounds like the latest cnh
[1:15:59] i'm rich increases goods they trust
[1:16:00] themselves that they're righteous and
[1:16:02] woe unto any who says actually you need
[1:16:04] more
[1:16:06] people get offended now that they are
[1:16:08] righteous and despised others
[1:16:10] two men went up into the temple to pray
[1:16:12] one a pharisee the other republican
[1:16:14] the pharisees stood and prayed thus with
[1:16:16] with himself god
[1:16:18] i thank thee that i'm not as other men
[1:16:20] are
[1:16:21] extortionist unjust adulterers or even
[1:16:23] this publican
[1:16:24] so he's saying lord i'm so glad i'm not
[1:16:26] this guy he's actually blind this guy
[1:16:29] this guy's actually richard miseral paul
[1:16:31] blind naked doesn't even know his
[1:16:33] spiritual state
[1:16:34] he may be outwardly rich and and you
[1:16:36] know doing well and looking so holy and
[1:16:38] you know having a form of godliness but
[1:16:41] he
[1:16:41] he's just all he cares about is matching
[1:16:43] this guy
[1:16:45] we never want to be in this state but
[1:16:46] this is the condition of this age
[1:16:50] i fast twice in the week i give ties of
[1:16:52] all that i possess
[1:16:54] and the publican standing afar off see
[1:16:57] he's just talking about his works what
[1:16:58] about his heart
[1:17:01] you know that's the most important thing
[1:17:02] what's the condition of our hearts today
[1:17:05] you know we can have such a reasoning
[1:17:06] that our mirror that we are reflecting
[1:17:08] in to make sure we look
[1:17:09] fine is actually a wrong one you know
[1:17:11] brother brown would tell a story of a
[1:17:13] of of a lady that will actually turn
[1:17:16] down the truth
[1:17:16] and she was dying she actually grew up
[1:17:18] became a sunday school teacher
[1:17:20] and all of her little sunday school
[1:17:21] class actually came into the hospital
[1:17:24] room to see her
[1:17:25] be carried away by the angels and her
[1:17:28] her pastor some denominational man
[1:17:30] was just out outside smoking up and down
[1:17:32] the hallway
[1:17:33] and and but but she thinks she's fine
[1:17:37] because she's been comparing herself
[1:17:38] with something but not the word
[1:17:41] but then when she begins to die her
[1:17:42] reasoning and all that veil begins to
[1:17:45] lift
[1:17:45] and her true spiritual state comes to
[1:17:47] the forefront
[1:17:48] and she actually realizes i'm lost and
[1:17:51] she cries out i'm lost
[1:17:52] you deceive her calling to her pastor
[1:17:54] i'm lost and she cries out
[1:17:56] she tries to get that your holy roller
[1:17:58] girl whatever come down lost
[1:17:59] and she died in that condition because
[1:18:02] beforehand she thought well i'm fine
[1:18:03] look i'm a sunday school teacher i did
[1:18:05] this and this and i've done this
[1:18:06] but her spiritual state was she was gone
[1:18:09] and she didn't realize it until her
[1:18:10] reasoning left her we never want to be
[1:18:12] in that condition
[1:18:13] we never want to be in that condition
[1:18:15] where the rapture goes and we say why am
[1:18:17] i left behind
[1:18:18] or we're on death's door we realize i
[1:18:20] actually don't know the lord
[1:18:21] i may be in church all my life may have
[1:18:23] said the right thing's going through the
[1:18:24] motions of baptism different things but
[1:18:26] you know do we really know him that's
[1:18:29] probably the biggest thing
[1:18:30] do we really know him in this hour is he
[1:18:32] really personal is he alive
[1:18:34] i mean is his word more than ink on
[1:18:36] paper more than messages on tape but
[1:18:37] he's a is he a living god
[1:18:40] i mean not not because it's a learned
[1:18:42] behavior to be a message believer that's
[1:18:43] probably the worst thing you could ever
[1:18:45] be in but it's a personal
[1:18:46] relationship with a resurrected lord
[1:18:48] jesus christ and you can actually see
[1:18:50] him living in you
[1:18:53] amen but this man this republican
[1:18:56] standing afar off could not so as much
[1:18:58] lift his eyes into heaven
[1:19:00] but smote his breasts saying god be
[1:19:02] merciful to me a sinner
[1:19:04] now this word merciful this is just from
[1:19:06] um scofield's notes
[1:19:08] he says so he says this so this word
[1:19:11] in the greek it ties into the mercy seat
[1:19:15] and this greek word is used in the
[1:19:17] septuagint and the new testament in
[1:19:19] connection with the mercy seat
[1:19:22] as an as as an instructor jew this
[1:19:24] publican is thinking not of mere mercy
[1:19:27] but of the blood sprinkled mercy seat
[1:19:30] his prayer might be paraphrased
[1:19:33] lord be towards me as thou art when thou
[1:19:37] look us upon the atoning blood
[1:19:40] hallelujah shouldn't that be our hearts
[1:19:43] cry
[1:19:44] lord when you look upon me may you look
[1:19:47] upon me as you look upon your returning
[1:19:49] blood
[1:19:50] may you not see my faults my humanity
[1:19:52] anything may you only see your sacrifice
[1:19:55] that was given on my behalf and not me
[1:19:59] and this man went away justified
[1:20:03] oh leah why because he wasn't comparing
[1:20:05] himself with anything
[1:20:06] he said lord i just want to be when you
[1:20:08] look down at me
[1:20:09] may you not see my reasoning or my
[1:20:11] religious ability and what i think i
[1:20:12] may only see your atoning blood may you
[1:20:15] look upon me
[1:20:16] and when you see me may you see your
[1:20:18] atoning blood
[1:20:20] hallelujah why because the blood of
[1:20:22] christ speaks better things than that of
[1:20:23] abel
[1:20:24] abel's blood can only cry out for
[1:20:26] justice
[1:20:27] but the blood of jesus christ not only
[1:20:29] cries out but it redeems amen
[1:20:31] hallelujah and i tell you now this is
[1:20:34] this is luke 18 14 i tell you this man
[1:20:37] went down to his house justified rather
[1:20:39] than the other
[1:20:40] for everyone that exalteth himself shall
[1:20:42] be abased and he that humbleth himself
[1:20:44] shall be exalted
[1:20:46] hallelujah now another trick of the
[1:20:48] devil so let's not compare remember the
[1:20:50] scripture says if we compare ourselves
[1:20:51] with ourselves we're unwise
[1:20:53] if we compare if i compare my children
[1:20:55] with someone else's children i'm unwise
[1:20:57] if i compare my home life with other
[1:20:59] people's home life
[1:21:00] see there's a problem with social media
[1:21:02] it was like look at my holidays look at
[1:21:03] my life look at this
[1:21:04] and a comparison begins to happen you
[1:21:07] know subconsciously well i don't have
[1:21:08] that i don't have this i don't need the
[1:21:10] i don't have this one it becomes a
[1:21:12] carnal comparison
[1:21:14] i don't care if i'm on the street i
[1:21:16] don't care if i have to live in my car
[1:21:18] i want my experience to match god's
[1:21:19] bible i want to go to the rapture
[1:21:22] so we we're not here to compare
[1:21:23] ourselves with ourselves i want to be a
[1:21:25] wise man
[1:21:26] i want to compare myself with the
[1:21:27] scripture say lord am i walking daily by
[1:21:30] your side
[1:21:31] am i actually walking with you or am i
[1:21:33] just walking with an idol
[1:21:35] crafted out of the scripture says this
[1:21:36] is jesus
[1:21:38] we don't want to do that now another
[1:21:41] trick
[1:21:42] is he causes us to respond carnally
[1:21:45] because of what other people do numbers
[1:21:49] 20 and 10
[1:21:50] if you've got that we can throw that up
[1:21:53] here's moses he has already
[1:21:56] been commissioned by god he's already
[1:21:59] brought the people out of
[1:22:00] egypt he's already stood in the gap for
[1:22:02] them that lord take my life you know
[1:22:04] don't take their life take my life block
[1:22:06] my name out of the book he stood in the
[1:22:08] gap he's done many incredible things the
[1:22:10] lord's used them in mighty ways
[1:22:12] but he comes to a spot where he just
[1:22:14] gets sick and tired
[1:22:15] of what he sees because he has been
[1:22:18] you just think about his job many times
[1:22:21] we think walking with the lord is a
[1:22:22] glamorous thing
[1:22:24] that's not a glamorous thing there's
[1:22:26] trouble
[1:22:28] there's strife there's murmuring there's
[1:22:30] people you can never please
[1:22:32] not looking anyone particular when i say
[1:22:34] that you know
[1:22:35] so don't take that person you know but
[1:22:37] this
[1:22:39] oh boy yeah people think he's looking at
[1:22:40] me i just happen to be looking at you
[1:22:42] okay
[1:22:42] you know so i just i just look up here
[1:22:44] something you know but
[1:22:45] you know but you know you can't you
[1:22:47] can't please yes so he has to put up
[1:22:49] with us what two million or a million
[1:22:51] people were however many
[1:22:52] you know and and he just gets sick of
[1:22:55] their murmuring
[1:22:57] and so he says to them and moses now and
[1:23:00] gathered the congregation together
[1:23:01] before the rock and said unto them
[1:23:03] here now ye rebels must we fetch water
[1:23:06] out of this rock
[1:23:07] and moses lifted up his hand with his
[1:23:09] rod he smote the rock twice
[1:23:11] and the water came out abundantly and
[1:23:13] the congregation drank and their beasts
[1:23:15] also
[1:23:16] he just got angry i'm sick of you
[1:23:18] talking to me like this i'm sick of this
[1:23:20] murmuring this bad atmosphere in the
[1:23:22] church here
[1:23:22] i'm sick of this going on do i have to
[1:23:24] do this for you
[1:23:26] it's what happened is this is a trick of
[1:23:29] the devil
[1:23:30] to get us to calmly respond to what
[1:23:32] other people are doing
[1:23:36] why did they lose so he lost their call
[1:23:39] because of all their murmuring and
[1:23:40] complaining
[1:23:42] but what caused the people to be this
[1:23:44] way it's because
[1:23:45] of they unbelief in the wilderness
[1:23:48] because they did not believe
[1:23:50] it says in hebrews 3 but with whom was
[1:23:53] he grieved 40 years was it not with them
[1:23:55] that had sinned
[1:23:56] whose carcasses fell in the wilderness
[1:23:58] and to whom swear
[1:23:59] that he that they should not enter into
[1:24:02] his rest
[1:24:04] of to them that believed not so we see
[1:24:07] that they
[1:24:07] could not enter in because of unbelief
[1:24:11] so this murmuring was a manifestation of
[1:24:14] unbelief
[1:24:15] and we know that all sin boils down to
[1:24:16] unbelief everything has just attributes
[1:24:18] of that
[1:24:19] and so here he's responding calmly
[1:24:22] because of their unbelief
[1:24:23] has been projected upon him with with
[1:24:26] the murmuring
[1:24:28] now brother abraham says this and um
[1:24:31] this is an
[1:24:32] uh the way to have fellowship he says
[1:24:35] that's where it is tonight i'll say
[1:24:36] that's where it is this morning god has
[1:24:38] to give it
[1:24:39] then love produces a fellowship when god
[1:24:41] said back there the day that sin that
[1:24:43] separated that divine love
[1:24:45] god told adam and eve not to eat of
[1:24:47] these certain fruits and they did and
[1:24:49] sin brought separation
[1:24:50] and sin by separation brought hatred
[1:24:53] malice strife envy is that right what
[1:24:56] happened they separated from
[1:24:57] divine love and when you separate from
[1:25:00] divine love
[1:25:01] you can't overlook your brother's
[1:25:03] mistakes no more
[1:25:04] you've got to ball him out for it that's
[1:25:07] right you can't overlook sister's
[1:25:08] mistakes no more because
[1:25:10] you've gone away from that divine part
[1:25:12] that love part
[1:25:14] pardon me but if you really love the
[1:25:16] lord jesus
[1:25:17] now notice what he's putting this he
[1:25:19] doesn't say if you really love them
[1:25:21] if you really love the lord jesus if
[1:25:23] brother or sister does something to you
[1:25:26] oh well that's all right they didn't
[1:25:27] mean to do it that's the kind of love
[1:25:29] that christ had
[1:25:30] father forgive them they don't know what
[1:25:32] they're doing what if he had held my
[1:25:34] sins against me
[1:25:35] what an awful person i was and i say
[1:25:37] mean to me
[1:25:38] but he was he loved me so well that he
[1:25:41] forgave me for them
[1:25:43] when i was undone he forgave me he loved
[1:25:45] me a pure love
[1:25:46] and when adam separated himself from
[1:25:48] pure love of god uh
[1:25:50] from pure love of keeping god's word in
[1:25:53] his heart
[1:25:54] when he did that then he began then
[1:25:56] other faculties come in
[1:25:58] malice envy strife hatred and so forth
[1:26:01] so when someone is separated from divine
[1:26:03] love this is what comes forth
[1:26:07] so these people were being motivated by
[1:26:09] unbelief and it caused them to murmur
[1:26:11] and complain
[1:26:12] and act in the flesh and that was a
[1:26:14] trick of the devil to get moses to
[1:26:16] react in the flesh he didn't lose his
[1:26:19] salvation but he didn't go into the
[1:26:21] promised land
[1:26:22] that's a trick of the devil now caleb
[1:26:24] and john no no
[1:26:26] i i love bible stories i just love today
[1:26:29] you just think about this because you
[1:26:30] know sometimes you just think there's
[1:26:32] aaron and there's moses and all the you
[1:26:34] know then there's all the murmurs
[1:26:36] but caleb and joshua were standing there
[1:26:38] too
[1:26:39] but you know the thing is about them is
[1:26:40] they weren't murmuring and complaining
[1:26:43] they weren't upset remember they were as
[1:26:44] thirsty as everyone else was thirsty
[1:26:46] their camels or their whatever animals
[1:26:48] were as thirsty and hungry as the other
[1:26:50] purples
[1:26:51] camels and livestock but there was
[1:26:52] something within them
[1:26:54] that their current circumstance did not
[1:26:56] cause them to murmur
[1:26:58] their current circumstance really caused
[1:27:00] them this is me to rejoice
[1:27:02] why is that because we're a day closer
[1:27:04] to crossing
[1:27:05] and we're a day closer to crossing and
[1:27:06] they journey a bit more we're going
[1:27:08] closer
[1:27:09] hallelujah hallelujah because remember
[1:27:11] they had a revelation anchor into their
[1:27:13] soul
[1:27:13] i mean that they were bound for the
[1:27:15] promised land and they were gonna caleb
[1:27:17] was
[1:27:18] gonna get his mountain amen so they did
[1:27:20] not sympathize with the murmurs and the
[1:27:23] complainers
[1:27:24] because they did not want that spirit to
[1:27:26] jump on them
[1:27:28] you know how spirits jump on people you
[1:27:30] open yourself up to that spirit
[1:27:32] that's why entertainment is such a
[1:27:33] powerful tool in the tools of the devil
[1:27:35] i mean in the hand of the devil cause
[1:27:36] you open up to it a spirit jumps on
[1:27:39] people
[1:27:41] and people get emotional when they're
[1:27:44] having discussions with people and what
[1:27:46] is that actually it can just be a spirit
[1:27:48] trying to get the other person to
[1:27:50] sympathize and they get emotional then
[1:27:52] that spirit jumps on them
[1:27:56] amen are we aware of this you know
[1:27:59] you've got to be careful you're not
[1:28:00] sympathizing with a spirit hey sure we
[1:28:02] should sympathize with one another when
[1:28:03] we go through hard times
[1:28:04] i'm not talking about become a robot now
[1:28:06] and be emotionally detached and not feel
[1:28:09] people's infirmities all these things
[1:28:10] but you know you've got to be careful
[1:28:12] what you're sympathizing with
[1:28:14] now brother brown would say in in
[1:28:15] jehovah jireh 55 he says there's a
[1:28:17] spirit coming from the woman
[1:28:19] calling in the audience now he's in a
[1:28:21] prayer line he's going to pray for this
[1:28:22] woman
[1:28:22] but there's a spirit from the woman
[1:28:24] there's an evil spirit
[1:28:26] of sickness calling to someone something
[1:28:28] else you see
[1:28:29] demons sympathize with one another
[1:28:32] they call help if they can only
[1:28:35] reinforce it enough to get this woman to
[1:28:37] disbelieve she'll walk off with her same
[1:28:39] condition
[1:28:40] there's something wrong with her if they
[1:28:42] get her to disbelieve if the angel lord
[1:28:44] can get a hold of her enough
[1:28:45] to get the vision started then she'll go
[1:28:47] away believing and receive
[1:28:49] he's his buddy's calling he says and how
[1:28:52] um how the angel came to me in 1953
[1:28:54] sitting right here looking here right on
[1:28:57] on down that road there you have bell
[1:28:59] trouble hanging over you
[1:29:00] you believe that god will make you well
[1:29:01] cold and conditioned do you believe
[1:29:03] he'll make you well
[1:29:04] you want to accept your healing now you
[1:29:06] do stand up to your feet then god bless
[1:29:07] you
[1:29:08] go ahead home now you'll get well that's
[1:29:10] satan
[1:29:11] i seen it moving back and i didn't know
[1:29:14] where it hit
[1:29:15] see it was sympathizing with that same
[1:29:18] spirit
[1:29:18] you can go home now and be well god
[1:29:20] bless you so the devil's trying to
[1:29:22] sympathize to gain power
[1:29:25] so that happens in human beings as well
[1:29:28] caleb and joshua didn't sympathize with
[1:29:29] the murmurs i'm thirsty caleb this is
[1:29:32] horrible i'm sick of this place
[1:29:34] praise the lord i'm thirsty but i'm on
[1:29:36] my way to a drink holly i'm walking with
[1:29:38] the rock amen i'm going to cross the
[1:29:40] jordan i'm going to take him out
[1:29:41] do you want me to tell you about the
[1:29:42] mountain i'm going to get you know and
[1:29:44] there'll come a time where
[1:29:45] the murmurs had nothing to do with
[1:29:48] joshua and caleb because they're like
[1:29:49] man i'm not talking to them anymore
[1:29:51] because they don't take on my pity party
[1:29:53] hallelujah this is a horrible place to
[1:29:56] be
[1:29:57] hold on are we slaves no we're not
[1:30:00] slaves no more well i'm a better
[1:30:01] condition here than me unless i'm free
[1:30:03] this i'm walking with god at least i'm
[1:30:04] on my way to canaan's fair land amen
[1:30:06] hallelujah amen
[1:30:10] so you know they were in the same
[1:30:12] condition but a revelation dropped in
[1:30:13] their hearts we're crossing jordan
[1:30:15] and the thing is they did it hallelujah
[1:30:18] so never ever respond
[1:30:20] in a carnal way when when the devil
[1:30:22] tries to get you to do that no no
[1:30:24] we got to respond in a real godly way
[1:30:28] amen now let me show you another reason
[1:30:31] why satan hates this book of revelation
[1:30:32] now where are we
[1:30:34] okay why why satan hates this book of
[1:30:36] revelation of jesus christ in the church
[1:30:38] he knows that jesus christ is the same
[1:30:40] yesterday and today and forever and he
[1:30:41] changes not
[1:30:42] he knows that a whole lot more than do
[1:30:44] 90 of the theologians
[1:30:46] he knows that since god is immutable in
[1:30:48] his nature he's just as immutable in his
[1:30:50] ways
[1:30:51] thus satan knows assuredly that the
[1:30:52] original church of pentecost with the
[1:30:54] power of god
[1:30:56] mark 16 in action is the true church
[1:30:58] that jesus christ claims
[1:30:59] as his own all else is false it has to
[1:31:02] be now remember this christ in the true
[1:31:04] church
[1:31:05] is a continuation of the book of acts
[1:31:08] but the book of revelation shows how
[1:31:10] that the antichrist spirit would come
[1:31:11] into the church and defile it
[1:31:13] making it lukewarm formal and powerless
[1:31:16] it exposes satan revealing his works
[1:31:18] attempted destruction of god's people
[1:31:20] and the discreting of god's word right
[1:31:22] down to the time he's cast the lake of
[1:31:24] fire
[1:31:24] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[1:31:27] knows if the people get the true
[1:31:28] revelation of the true church and what
[1:31:30] she is
[1:31:30] what she stands for that she can do the
[1:31:33] greater work she will be an invincible
[1:31:34] army
[1:31:35] if they get a true revelation of the two
[1:31:37] spirits within the framework of the
[1:31:39] christian church
[1:31:40] and by god's spirit discern and
[1:31:42] withstand the antichrist
[1:31:44] spirit satan will be powerless before
[1:31:46] her
[1:31:47] he will be definitely thoughted today as
[1:31:49] when christ will stood as every effort
[1:31:50] to
[1:31:51] gain power over him in the desert yes
[1:31:53] satan hates revelation but we love it
[1:31:55] with true revelation in our lives the
[1:31:57] gates of hell cannot prevail against us
[1:32:00] but we will prevail over them
[1:32:04] now i find it interesting that that that
[1:32:06] the prophet would pick out
[1:32:07] the lord overcoming the devil in the
[1:32:09] desert as as a
[1:32:11] uh as an example of how the true church
[1:32:13] will overcome
[1:32:15] in this day now if we go to matthew
[1:32:17] chapter four we can see
[1:32:18] you know that the devil
[1:32:22] tempts the lord in you know three ways
[1:32:24] and you know i'm sure we all know this
[1:32:25] very well but
[1:32:26] you know the first thing he weighs
[1:32:28] charizard now
[1:32:30] now in all these temptations he is
[1:32:32] trying to make the lord jesus prove to
[1:32:33] him that he is the son of god if thou be
[1:32:36] we don't have to prove to the devil
[1:32:37] nothing if you're the bride of christ do
[1:32:39] this and if you're really the bride and
[1:32:41] if the words really restore do this we
[1:32:42] don't have to do nothing
[1:32:44] we don't have to answer the devil at all
[1:32:47] you know we're he is not our god
[1:32:49] satan was trying to lead jesus through
[1:32:51] certain things that's an antichrist move
[1:32:53] is to be led by the devil
[1:32:55] right the power of god leads us
[1:32:57] according to the word we don't have to
[1:32:58] prove nothing to the devil
[1:32:59] amen so he tempts him in three different
[1:33:01] ways the first one of course because he
[1:33:04] had fasted for 40 days and nights he
[1:33:05] afterwards and hung it
[1:33:07] and the tempter came to and said if thou
[1:33:09] be the son of god command that these
[1:33:10] stones be made bread
[1:33:12] now jesus was hungry so the devil was
[1:33:14] trying to make him use the gift or the
[1:33:16] power that he had for his own personal
[1:33:17] gain
[1:33:19] but the thing was really inspired by the
[1:33:21] devil as we know that's why he said get
[1:33:22] behind me satan
[1:33:24] so he can inspire you to use the gift in
[1:33:26] your life for your own personal gain
[1:33:29] hallelujah so we can have we can have a
[1:33:32] we can have a gift we can just influence
[1:33:33] people real easy some of us have just
[1:33:35] got that kind of a nature around us you
[1:33:36] can just rally people around and
[1:33:38] influence things and
[1:33:39] you know so the devil will try and get
[1:33:40] us to use
[1:33:42] a gift in our lives for our own personal
[1:33:45] gain
[1:33:46] he will lead us if we're not careful to
[1:33:49] subtly
[1:33:50] run down people to other people to kill
[1:33:53] their influence to make ourselves look
[1:33:55] better
[1:33:56] that is the devil leading someone but
[1:33:59] you say get thee behind me satan you
[1:34:01] know
[1:34:01] you think about the prophet you didn't
[1:34:04] know who his friends
[1:34:05] or his enemies were because he spoke
[1:34:07] about people all the same way
[1:34:08] he didn't belittle anyone to anyone
[1:34:11] amen help us lord i mean the next things
[1:34:14] that he made you know
[1:34:15] the devil took him up to the holy city
[1:34:17] set him on the pinnacle of the temple
[1:34:20] and then the devil quoted the scripture
[1:34:22] to him and said if thou be the son of
[1:34:24] god cast thyself down for it is written
[1:34:26] he shall give his angels charge
[1:34:28] concerning thee and and in their hands
[1:34:30] they shall bear thee up least at any
[1:34:32] time they dash
[1:34:34] thou dash thy foot against the stone now
[1:34:36] it appears like he is quoting
[1:34:38] psalms 91 word for word but when we go
[1:34:41] to psalms 91 he's not quoting it word
[1:34:43] for word he omits part of the scripture
[1:34:45] so if we go to psalms 91 11 for he shall
[1:34:47] give his angels charge over thee
[1:34:49] to keep thee in all thy ways so he left
[1:34:52] out the part to keep thee in all thy
[1:34:54] ways
[1:34:55] so he's omitting part of it
[1:34:59] to try and get power over the lord
[1:35:03] well what's that got to do with us well
[1:35:05] here's a quote that people love to throw
[1:35:07] around
[1:35:08] brother brahm says the mystery of the
[1:35:09] baptism of the holy ghost without
[1:35:11] sensation
[1:35:12] but is that the whole statement no
[1:35:15] because brother it says but the person
[1:35:16] of jesus
[1:35:17] but the person of christ performing in
[1:35:19] you the same works that he did
[1:35:21] so he says the mystery of the baptism
[1:35:22] the holy ghost without sensation but
[1:35:24] the person of christ performing in you
[1:35:26] the same works that he did
[1:35:28] hallelujah it's not just oh i've got the
[1:35:30] holy ghost without sensation what
[1:35:31] happened to you i don't know it's
[1:35:32] without sensation is your life change ah
[1:35:33] well i believe the word mentally
[1:35:35] and there's no life there's no
[1:35:36] manifestation of the word man you know
[1:35:38] there's no
[1:35:39] there's no supernatural life living
[1:35:41] through you
[1:35:42] oh but i've got the holy ghost because
[1:35:43] he said without sensation that's not
[1:35:45] what he says
[1:35:47] amen he says the person of christ will
[1:35:49] perform
[1:35:50] in you the same works that he did so
[1:35:53] there will be a genuine you contribute
[1:35:54] you should be able to look back in your
[1:35:56] life and say i saw the lord live here
[1:35:58] and here and here and here and he did
[1:35:59] this and he's done this and he's done
[1:36:01] this
[1:36:01] why because there's a book of acts being
[1:36:02] written amen amen
[1:36:05] amen so brother brahm says this he says
[1:36:10] he says in the token he says that i said
[1:36:12] last night up in new york at one of the
[1:36:14] messages if i told you that shakespeare
[1:36:16] lived in me
[1:36:17] i do the works of shakespeare because i
[1:36:18] couldn't help it i'm no more myself i'm
[1:36:20] dead
[1:36:21] shakespeare and i can't live together in
[1:36:23] here shakespeare was a poet i
[1:36:25] and i'm a minister we can't live
[1:36:27] together but if i am dead to myself
[1:36:29] and shakespeare lives in me the works of
[1:36:31] shakespeare i'll do
[1:36:33] the life of shakespeare in me will be
[1:36:34] lived out like shakespeare
[1:36:36] if the life of beethoven lived in me i'd
[1:36:38] be beethoven
[1:36:40] if the life of john dillinger lived in
[1:36:41] me i would be john dillinger that's
[1:36:43] right
[1:36:44] and if the life of jesus christ lives in
[1:36:46] the person
[1:36:47] they become identified with him it's
[1:36:49] christ in you
[1:36:50] not a church member not a system but a
[1:36:52] resurrected power
[1:36:54] it's the holy ghost as a token upon you
[1:36:56] and your life says
[1:36:57] amen to every scripture the promise is
[1:37:00] written
[1:37:01] in there hallelujah what did jesus do he
[1:37:04] cast out devils he raised the dead
[1:37:06] he spoke in tongues he rejoiced
[1:37:08] hallelujah
[1:37:09] what do you mean he rejoiced well it
[1:37:10] says in luke 10 and 21
[1:37:13] and that same hour jesus rejoiced in
[1:37:14] spirit now if you go look on
[1:37:17] you know some children's cartoon bible
[1:37:19] program they take hippie jesus and he
[1:37:20] just goes praise the lord
[1:37:22] you know you know but when it says that
[1:37:25] he rejoiced in spirit that word in the
[1:37:27] greek means to jump for joy
[1:37:29] it means to be to be exceeding joy to
[1:37:31] rejoice
[1:37:32] so when he rejoiced in spirit he was
[1:37:34] really rejoicing
[1:37:35] hallelujah amen if he causes you to do
[1:37:38] that well that's all fight
[1:37:40] hallelujah but you know and definitely
[1:37:43] you will manifest the word for your age
[1:37:46] hallelujah now in the invisible union of
[1:37:48] the bride of christ in a true picture of
[1:37:50] the modern church today
[1:37:52] neither does it neither does the modern
[1:37:54] church want any of these screaming
[1:37:55] shouting acts speaking 238 youngins
[1:37:58] around here
[1:37:59] yeah yeah yeah see she don't want any of
[1:38:00] them whooping and crying and screaming
[1:38:02] amen hallelujah
[1:38:03] why such a child would immediately put
[1:38:05] her out of her denomination
[1:38:07] they had one like that and one of the
[1:38:08] churches why they'd throw her out right
[1:38:10] quick
[1:38:11] why are you letting such stuff as this
[1:38:13] go along so you see
[1:38:15] she's pregnant with something because
[1:38:16] she's bringing forth members all the
[1:38:18] time
[1:38:18] but she don't want none of them
[1:38:20] screaming hollering blabbering acts 238
[1:38:22] miserable creatures
[1:38:23] that she thinks they are it would
[1:38:25] certainly embarrass her it would ruin
[1:38:26] her and her educated ethical scientific
[1:38:29] society church that she belong to here
[1:38:32] they'll throw her out at the next
[1:38:33] council she can't have it so she don't
[1:38:35] want to be pregnant with the word
[1:38:37] because it's the only kind the word can
[1:38:39] bring forth
[1:38:40] now when i talk about these things i
[1:38:41] talk about these four walls
[1:38:44] they can do what they do i'm talking
[1:38:45] about us we need you know
[1:38:47] you know the lord said to us a few years
[1:38:48] ago now if if he be lifted up
[1:38:51] because there's a burden how we're going
[1:38:52] to keep our young people
[1:38:54] and there was a response from the spirit
[1:38:55] of god if i be lifted up like moses
[1:38:57] lifted up the bra
[1:38:58] serpent i will draw them to myself was
[1:39:00] basically what was said
[1:39:02] so now now the question is how do we
[1:39:03] lift them up do we just get stricter
[1:39:06] do we just get more no there's got to be
[1:39:08] a a life that's projected
[1:39:11] there's got to be the resurrected power
[1:39:12] there's got to be an atmosphere around
[1:39:14] us
[1:39:14] that will actually draw our children
[1:39:16] draw our adults draw everyone aiming to
[1:39:19] himself isn't that what we want
[1:39:21] hardly it not to not to a creed not to
[1:39:23] an argument not to just well you've got
[1:39:25] to shape up or ship out but there's got
[1:39:26] to be a resurrected power
[1:39:28] amen that will draw the people
[1:39:30] hallelujah
[1:39:31] amen amen amen that's how we've got to
[1:39:34] be amen if god lives in us shouldn't we
[1:39:35] be that way
[1:39:36] amen if we have the works of christ what
[1:39:38] did the what did the lord do there was a
[1:39:40] life in him that drew people to himself
[1:39:43] hallelujah amen we should be the same
[1:39:46] way
[1:39:47] [Music]
[1:39:49] amen now we've got to understand there's
[1:39:53] a power in the church today
[1:39:55] that is more than a match for the devil
[1:39:58] there's more than a match
[1:39:59] this spirit with this three-edged club
[1:40:01] will try and beat you down
[1:40:02] that's right but we there's a power
[1:40:05] released in the church
[1:40:07] today that will overcome it you know
[1:40:10] what does he try and use against us that
[1:40:12] we're not worthy
[1:40:14] i'm just going to try and script skip a
[1:40:16] few things
[1:40:17] how does a how does how does the devil
[1:40:19] try and beat us down
[1:40:21] i'm not worthy enough yes what's our
[1:40:24] worthiness got to do with it that's
[1:40:26] right
[1:40:26] really in the old testament
[1:40:30] when the worshiper brought the lamb a
[1:40:32] sin offering or turtle doves but we'll
[1:40:33] just use the lamb for an example
[1:40:35] as soon as the priest saw that lamb he
[1:40:37] didn't look at the worshipper
[1:40:39] it doesn't say in the book of the book
[1:40:41] of leviticus and thou shalt bring your
[1:40:42] lamb without blemish to the priest and
[1:40:44] he shall sit you down for three hours
[1:40:45] and examine you
[1:40:46] and when you've been found worthy that
[1:40:48] you offer the lamb on your behalf
[1:40:50] i don't read that i read when and you
[1:40:53] shall bring your sin offering
[1:40:54] and the priest shall examine the sin
[1:40:56] offering and if it shall be found
[1:40:58] without blemish you shall be offered on
[1:40:59] your behalf
[1:41:00] that's what the word says right so so
[1:41:02] our worthiness has got nothing
[1:41:04] to do with nothing say the devil because
[1:41:06] because he uses
[1:41:07] our sincere good intentions against
[1:41:09] ourselves because we want to be like the
[1:41:10] lord we want to be holy we want to be
[1:41:12] perfect we want to walk with him
[1:41:14] we don't want to upset him in any way
[1:41:15] and you know and the devil just uses
[1:41:17] that against
[1:41:18] us our sincerity he'll use against us
[1:41:20] right and then we beat ourselves down
[1:41:22] saying lord i'm just not worthy but
[1:41:23] in reality true we're not worthy that's
[1:41:25] right but it's not our worthiness
[1:41:27] it's it's it's our lamb if our lamb has
[1:41:30] been accepted then i'm accepted
[1:41:32] now in the old testament the priest just
[1:41:34] examined the lamb he didn't talk to me
[1:41:36] he didn't even worry about the worshiper
[1:41:38] his burden was this has to be found
[1:41:40] perfect and if this has been found
[1:41:42] perfect i can offer this on his behalf
[1:41:44] and he could now walk away justified
[1:41:46] because the blood was enough to atone
[1:41:48] for his sins
[1:41:49] hallelujah and our perfect lamb stood
[1:41:50] before pilate
[1:41:52] many false acts you know many false
[1:41:54] accusers came before him
[1:41:56] but then paul just says i find no fault
[1:41:58] in this man hallelujah and then he was
[1:42:00] taken glory and he was offered without
[1:42:03] the gate
[1:42:03] hallelujah then he ascended up high came
[1:42:06] back down amen
[1:42:07] his blood was accepted his blood at
[1:42:09] times for you and i
[1:42:11] hallelujah then we can say well i'm
[1:42:13] worthy because he's worthy
[1:42:15] amen remember all of the press you think
[1:42:18] about in the old testament
[1:42:20] remember the wife is the responsibility
[1:42:23] of the husband
[1:42:25] so it all sits on the pressure of that
[1:42:28] wife to be looked after to be god to be
[1:42:30] protected
[1:42:30] everything to be to be nourished is all
[1:42:33] on the husband
[1:42:35] if he fails she fails but if he succeeds
[1:42:39] she succeeds oh our husband succeeded
[1:42:43] i don't know if you realize that or not
[1:42:45] he succeeded right he made us in such a
[1:42:47] way
[1:42:48] by his blood that we're without blame
[1:42:50] unreapprovable
[1:42:52] blame let's just let's just i have that
[1:42:54] somewhere
[1:42:58] i'm sure i put it down it was it was
[1:43:02] first oh no it's in colossians 1 and 22.
[1:43:06] so the lamb is accepted and if the lamb
[1:43:08] is accepted we're accepted
[1:43:10] hallelujah and if you have the high
[1:43:12] priest you have the blood
[1:43:14] and what did brother braham say he said
[1:43:16] who did she touch who did he touch they
[1:43:18] were
[1:43:19] this many feet away did they touch the
[1:43:21] high priest he's the high priest who
[1:43:22] touched by the feeling of our
[1:43:23] infirmities
[1:43:24] and so what was happening the high
[1:43:25] priest was standing on the platform
[1:43:27] revealing himself to a prophet
[1:43:29] amen so if you have the high priest you
[1:43:31] have the blood and we have the word
[1:43:33] brother i said this is not my message
[1:43:35] this is god's message
[1:43:36] within it is the true revelation of
[1:43:37] jesus christ so if you have the high
[1:43:39] priest you have the blood we have the
[1:43:41] high priest do we not
[1:43:43] glory amen that's probably a whole
[1:43:45] subject in itself but you know
[1:43:48] we are the lord has made us worthy now
[1:43:50] you look at this
[1:43:52] now we'll come to that i'm going to read
[1:43:53] this first ephesians 1 and 6
[1:43:55] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[1:43:57] wherein he has made
[1:43:58] us accepted in the beloved so he's made
[1:44:00] me accepted
[1:44:01] i don't need to prove nothing and then
[1:44:04] and then colossians 1 22
[1:44:05] sorry we'll put that back up and the
[1:44:07] body of his flesh through death to
[1:44:09] present you
[1:44:10] holy and unblameable
[1:44:13] and unreprovable in his sight now you
[1:44:16] think about god
[1:44:17] you can trick me you can tell me certain
[1:44:20] things and you can put on a certain
[1:44:22] angle which
[1:44:23] you know which is not the truth right
[1:44:25] but god sees everything
[1:44:27] god sees everything so now god is going
[1:44:31] to make a people i believe i'm looking
[1:44:33] at them right now
[1:44:34] remember you know this is me when i read
[1:44:36] these scriptures i just think he's
[1:44:37] talking about me
[1:44:38] how does he know how i am amen remember
[1:44:41] this is what he has done for you and i
[1:44:42] that we would be unblamable that means
[1:44:45] without blame
[1:44:46] blemish fault or spot you got no spot
[1:44:49] you got no blemish you got no fault
[1:44:52] and faultless unblameable and
[1:44:54] unreprovable which means
[1:44:55] unaccused you cannot be accused in his
[1:44:58] sight that's what the blood does
[1:45:00] takes away anything oh we beat ourselves
[1:45:02] up with things out the blood takes care
[1:45:03] of it all
[1:45:04] hallelujah now another thing that he
[1:45:07] beats us up with and
[1:45:09] and i'll just close with this one
[1:45:10] because time is has has
[1:45:12] marched or jumped on brother brown says
[1:45:15] the comment
[1:45:16] full obedience to the whole word of god
[1:45:18] to god's entire word entitles you to
[1:45:20] this token
[1:45:21] who's heard him say this so immediately
[1:45:24] well this is in my little brain which
[1:45:26] anyway probably doesn't count for much
[1:45:27] but in my little mind
[1:45:30] as soon as that is said subconsciously
[1:45:33] now
[1:45:34] we begin to think well have i been good
[1:45:36] enough and have i been good enough for
[1:45:38] long enough and
[1:45:38] have i been obedient to the full word of
[1:45:41] god and now i've got to look through
[1:45:42] everything i need to do and
[1:45:43] you know and then there's a lot of
[1:45:44] pressure and you know am i you know and
[1:45:46] then and then it comes a performance
[1:45:48] thing
[1:45:49] right the devil twisted in people's
[1:45:52] minds
[1:45:53] that you have to be and and to me this
[1:45:55] is what discourages a lot of people
[1:45:57] they say well i can't do this so i'm
[1:45:58] going to quit what's the point of trying
[1:46:02] but now so basically what this is saying
[1:46:05] if you just take this and not what he
[1:46:07] says after this
[1:46:08] remember the devil took a part of
[1:46:09] scripture and quoted it to jesus not the
[1:46:11] whole thing
[1:46:12] so he'll use the message use the
[1:46:14] scripture against you the same way
[1:46:15] and so now basically this is saying
[1:46:19] that people have to earn the holy ghost
[1:46:21] by their own merit if you just take that
[1:46:22] isolated statement so they say well
[1:46:24] what's the point i can't do it i'm a
[1:46:25] failure to be good with so
[1:46:26] might as well quit but brother braham
[1:46:28] says this in the token he says now you
[1:46:30] want eternal life you receive a token
[1:46:32] showing that the price has been paid it
[1:46:34] isn't the blood it's the token of the
[1:46:36] blood the life itself amen
[1:46:38] full obedience to the whole word of god
[1:46:39] to god's entire word will entitle you to
[1:46:42] this token and then he says
[1:46:43] how do you do it i'm like yeah yeah i'm
[1:46:46] so glad he just throws the quest yo the
[1:46:47] question i have he already puts it out
[1:46:49] there
[1:46:50] amen he says then so how do you do it
[1:46:53] question mark
[1:46:54] peter said on the day of pentecost now
[1:46:56] what i'm about to read
[1:46:57] is is this is how you do full obedience
[1:46:59] to the full word of god entitles you to
[1:47:01] the token
[1:47:01] peter said on the day of pentecost
[1:47:03] repent every one of you and be baptized
[1:47:05] in the name of jesus christ for
[1:47:06] remission of sin
[1:47:08] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:47:09] holy ghost to token for the promises
[1:47:11] unto you and to your children them that
[1:47:13] are far off even as men as the lord our
[1:47:14] god shall call
[1:47:16] i mean so what he is saying is full
[1:47:17] obesity the full word of god
[1:47:19] that will entitle you to this token is
[1:47:21] to repent
[1:47:22] have godly sorrow for your sin turn from
[1:47:24] it amen surrender your whole life to god
[1:47:26] be baptized name the lord jesus christ
[1:47:28] and you shall receive the token that is
[1:47:31] full obedience
[1:47:32] the full word of god is acts 238 it's
[1:47:34] that simple hallelujah
[1:47:37] amen if you do this and he you're
[1:47:38] entitled to the token that is full
[1:47:40] obesity full word of god
[1:47:41] what about every other part of the word
[1:47:43] well if you fall in love with him and
[1:47:44] you meet him
[1:47:45] your life will begin to manifest you'll
[1:47:47] dress right talk right act right speak
[1:47:49] right you'll

[1:47:51] of peace the full word of god entitles
