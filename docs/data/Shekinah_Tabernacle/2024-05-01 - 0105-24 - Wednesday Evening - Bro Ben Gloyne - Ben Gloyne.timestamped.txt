[25:25] bless you friends you can have your
[25:26] seats tonight so I want to take a take a
[25:28] bit of a thought tonight about taking
[25:30] God at his word and I pray that we'll
[25:32] get to that eventually but uh we see
[25:34] that God you know our God is not a God
[25:37] that can lie I just want to you know
[25:39] it's so amazing where where this was
[25:41] actually God would use balum to speak
[25:43] this to U um about Israel so so the king
[25:46] of Moab had hired balam to try and curse
[25:48] Israel but yet when the spirit of God
[25:51] Came Upon
[25:52] balum God would speak through God would
[25:55] speak through this highing prophet and
[25:57] say I don't see any veress in them I see
[25:59] no iniquity in them and this is the god
[26:01] who sees all things you know this is the
[26:04] god who sees all things but because of
[26:05] the shed blood of bulls and goats God
[26:07] could not see their sin now if if God
[26:10] could look at a people just through a
[26:12] natural a natural blood there and see no
[26:14] perverseness and see no and see no
[26:16] iniquity how much more people under the
[26:19] blood of Jesus Christ tonight I want to
[26:21] push back against the enemy tonight you
[26:23] know you know because he Wars us in our
[26:25] mind he you know he wants us to think
[26:27] that the promises of God not for us but
[26:29] they are for us Jesus died to give it to
[26:31] us amen remember we don't Merit anything
[26:34] he he wanted all for me amen he wanted
[26:36] it all for you and I so oh here we go
[26:38] look we're on the big screen wonderful
[26:40] praise the Lord amen so this is this is
[26:44] what this is what uh this is what balum
[26:47] would would would be anointed to speak
[26:49] to um about Israel it's amazing where
[26:52] God doesn't see no iniquity in them amen
[26:54] he you know he says the Lord his God is
[26:56] with him and the shout of a king is
[26:57] among them and I believe we are the same
[27:00] kind of people am mean the pillar of
[27:01] fire is among us tonight amen the
[27:03] presence of God Is With Us irrespective
[27:06] of what's going on in life because you
[27:07] think about there in Israel there they
[27:09] would have had trouble fussing fighting
[27:11] domestic domestic issues all kind of
[27:13] things going on in the camp when God
[27:15] looked down on them he said I see
[27:16] nothing wrong amen because that the Lord
[27:19] is God is with them and the shout of a
[27:21] king is among them now a shout of a king
[27:23] speaks of dominion speaks of authority
[27:25] speaks of power and we know that the
[27:27] word of the Lord is all powerful amen
[27:30] God is not a man that he should lie
[27:32] neither the son of man that he should
[27:33] repent amen so what he has blessed will
[27:36] remain blessed you're a blessed people
[27:38] tonight I'm talking about you amen
[27:40] you're a blessed people Amen to receive
[27:42] the word of the Lord amen to be washed
[27:44] of all your sins to be transformed by
[27:46] the Holy Ghost you're a blessed person
[27:49] amen you're one of the most blessed
[27:50] people throughout all the ages is you
[27:52] amen we think of Moses was blessed and
[27:54] Enoch was blessed and Noah was blessed
[27:56] and Elijah was blessed and Elisha was
[27:58] blessed and Peter James and John were
[28:01] blessed and you're blessed you're in the
[28:03] same category amen why because you're
[28:05] part of God's elected ones amen
[28:07] hallelujah so now our God does not back
[28:09] up on any of his promises amen as as as
[28:13] God would say for his Heavens are higher
[28:15] than the earth and so are my ways higher
[28:17] than your ways and my thoughts than your
[28:19] thoughts for as the rain cometh down and
[28:21] the snow from heaven and return not
[28:24] returneth not hither but WTH the Earth
[28:26] and maketh it bring forth and Bud
[28:28] that it may give seed to the sewer and
[28:30] bread to the eater so shall my word that
[28:33] goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not
[28:36] return unto me void but it shall
[28:38] accomplish that which I please it shall
[28:40] prosper in the thing where to I sent it
[28:43] amen amen so God's word is going to
[28:45] fulfill what he said it was going to
[28:46] fulfill amen it's not going to halfway
[28:48] fulfill or 3/4 of the way fulfill it's
[28:50] not going to load 99% and just say stuck
[28:53] on the loading cycle and crash no it's
[28:55] going to fulfill completely I mean what
[28:57] he said it would do now if this is how
[29:00] God thinks of his word am mean he wants
[29:02] us to think the same way he wants us to
[29:05] have full confidence in his word amen
[29:08] not have a partial confidence not have a
[29:10] confidence based on circumstances but a
[29:12] complete and utter confidence that God's
[29:15] word Works any situation any place any
[29:18] time as brother Braham said this end
[29:21] time message meets end time conditions
[29:23] amen the message in Noah's day met the
[29:26] conditions of the age amen the the word
[29:28] of Moses's day met the same conditions
[29:31] it met the conditions of Egypt and all
[29:33] the troubles and everything it met those
[29:35] conditions amen and the same word took
[29:37] them into the promised land it see the
[29:38] word of God meets every condition amen
[29:41] amen of the age that it's in and it's
[29:43] the same thing with you and I we are not
[29:44] here defenseless we are not Here
[29:46] Helpless we're not here trampled down
[29:49] we're not here you may feel that way but
[29:51] that but it's not your portion okay
[29:53] we're not here useless We're Not Here
[29:55] Helpless we're not here defenseless no
[29:57] the angel of God surround you and I amen
[29:59] the blood of Jesus Christ covers Us amen
[30:01] the Lord Of Glory is your portion amen
[30:04] this is who he is your portion now
[30:07] because many times you think well the
[30:08] devil's attacking me actually no it's
[30:11] it's God verse Satan all right right get
[30:14] yourself out of the equation sure the
[30:16] devil attacks you but really he's having
[30:18] a God God because he's trying to prove
[30:21] to God God your blood's not strong
[30:22] enough you're not able enough I can
[30:24] outsmart you I can out Fox you I can
[30:26] defeat you this is what the devil think
[30:28] he can do but God over and over again
[30:30] says no I proved you wrong again Satan
[30:32] proved you wrong again Satan proved you
[30:34] wrong again Satan and then in every
[30:36] generation God has a group of Overcomers
[30:39] amen where God can put his finger on
[30:41] them and say Satan I proved you wrong
[30:43] again amen and I believe I'm looking at
[30:45] those kind of people tonight amen we are
[30:47] Overcomers amen sure we wrestle with
[30:49] things we wrestle with our humanity and
[30:51] whatever more but we come out the other
[30:53] side packing the victory amen why
[30:55] because our Lord Jesus Christ has
[30:57] already overcome Hallelujah so now we
[31:01] got to take God at his word because his
[31:04] word is all
[31:05] powerful and Le was asking me what to
[31:07] preach on tonight I said well I'm going
[31:09] to preach on taking God at his word I
[31:11] mean because you see The Heroes of Faith
[31:13] down the ages they took God at his word
[31:16] I mean Enoch took God at his word and he
[31:18] went and he walked all the way home with
[31:20] God one day he walked with God and was
[31:22] not cuz God took him amen Moses took God
[31:25] at his word and he delivered the people
[31:27] of Israel is out of Egypt am mean Noah
[31:29] took God his word he built the ark to
[31:31] the saving of his house amen Elijah took
[31:34] God his word rebuilt the altar of the
[31:36] Lord put the sacrifice how God said and
[31:38] then when everything was there in the
[31:40] evening time sacrifice Elijah prayed
[31:42] Lord I've done this all according to
[31:44] your word and the fire fell amen
[31:47] hallelujah so all the Believers down
[31:49] Through the Ages have taken God at his
[31:51] word they had their problems they men of
[31:54] like passions Elijah was a man of like
[31:56] passions like you and I none of the
[31:58] Heroes of Faith were superhuman they had
[32:01] their doubts their frustrations their
[32:02] problems their stresses their pressures
[32:04] they had all those things but yet they
[32:06] are Heroes of Faith because faith is
[32:07] greater than these five senses amen
[32:10] faith is greater than than our
[32:11] imagination our conscience our reasoning
[32:13] all those things just put all those
[32:15] things to one side and take God at his
[32:17] word see the devil wants to Cloud over
[32:20] our minds he wants us to imagine
[32:23] everything but God's
[32:25] word amen he hav thought of just
[32:27] imagining having family prayer and the
[32:28] pillar of fire becomes visible in front
[32:30] of everyone changes the whole family you
[32:32] have a Revival in your home the devil
[32:34] will never give you those kind of
[32:36] imaginations have you ever had an
[32:37] imagination where God just sweeps
[32:39] through the church sovereignly amen and
[32:41] just touches every life and everyone
[32:43] walks out of here saying God is real in
[32:44] this place it's not just a sign out
[32:46] there but it's a reality I mean you ever
[32:48] had those kind of when you're driving in
[32:50] the car and the pillow of fire comes in
[32:51] and just electrifies the atmosphere I'm
[32:53] not talking about just imaginations
[32:55] these things really happen hallelujah
[32:57] amen you're at work and such a presence
[32:59] comes around you amen you know it's the
[33:00] Lord amen a real sweet sweet humble
[33:03] feeling comes over you brother that's
[33:05] the angels of the Lord coming around
[33:07] you hallelujah amen why not think on
[33:10] those things why not think on his
[33:12] promises and how able he is to fulfill
[33:14] them amen why not think about those kind
[33:17] of things I think that's a good way to
[33:18] get your imagination and conscience and
[33:20] reasoning lined up with the word of God
[33:21] you think God you're more than able amen
[33:24] let's just read I just feel to read it I
[33:26] think it's in Genesis 1 Let's try and
[33:28] find about I I just like it how God says
[33:30] this I think is where he says now he
[33:33] made the heavens and the
[33:35] earth
[33:38] now and he says he made basically the
[33:40] heavens he made the Stars
[33:43] also I'm going to search this cuz I want
[33:45] to read it because you know the devil
[33:47] wants us to
[33:49] doubt the word of God yes I'm Googling
[33:52] in church here I am
[33:58] 116
[34:00] 116 yeah perfect quick on the trigger
[34:03] see but isn't that neat can you put that
[34:05] up Genesis 1:16 and he made the two
[34:08] great lights the Lesser to Rule the Day
[34:10] and the I mean sorry the greater to
[34:12] light to Rule the Day the Lesser light
[34:14] to rule the night he made the Stars also
[34:17] now I don't have any big pictures of
[34:18] nebulas and galaxies and things but God
[34:20] Bas says yeah I made that
[34:22] too I made that too you know what all
[34:25] these great scientific minds are just
[34:28] are in a of and we look up and we stare
[34:30] and I remember being in the northern one
[34:31] of the northern islands of of of vanatu
[34:34] there's no lights there's no nothing
[34:36] it's just the milky white way in all of
[34:37] its glory and all the locals are just
[34:40] doing their thing and I just want to
[34:41] kind of just do this for a few you know
[34:43] and God says yeah I made that too by the
[34:45] way you know is is is anything too hard
[34:47] for the Lord you know and we come down
[34:50] onto this little planet and we look at
[34:51] our problems and we think our problems
[34:53] are big and and to us they may be big
[34:55] but but is anything too hard for the
[34:57] Lord is there anything impossible with
[34:59] our God is there a situation too
[35:01] difficult is there something that's too
[35:03] complex too Dee rooted too great of
[35:05] trouble no nothing is too hard for our
[35:08] Lord amen why because his word is
[35:11] forever true and he is his word amen so
[35:15] brother Braham says this in the greatest
[35:16] bad level of for says but the spirit it
[35:18] only has one sense now he actually
[35:20] speaking about the soul here now let's
[35:21] get it the spirit has one sense and that
[35:23] sense is either dominates it's Faith or
[35:25] doubt that's exactly and there's only
[35:27] one Avenue to it that's free moral
[35:29] agency so that's choice you can accept
[35:32] it or um sorry you can accept doubt or
[35:35] you can accept Faith either one you want
[35:38] to work on who wants to work on
[35:41] doubt who wants to work on
[35:44] faith amen so why so so so why why work
[35:49] on
[35:50] skepticism why let doubt why entertain
[35:53] skepticism why why entertain cynicism oh
[35:57] you said that before well we someone
[35:59] else believed that and look what
[36:00] happened to them and all these see the
[36:01] devil never points out the genuine he
[36:03] always points out the negative he always
[36:05] points out the train wreck or the car
[36:06] wreck on the side of the side of the
[36:08] road to Christianity but he'll never
[36:09] point you to a genuine overcoming Holy
[36:12] Ghost filled Family Holy Ghost filled
[36:15] mom or dad or brother or sister he'll
[36:16] never point you to the genuine am mean
[36:18] he always points you to the negative but
[36:20] so so why work on skepticism you cuz the
[36:22] Devil comes along well if God's really
[36:24] real why did this
[36:25] happen oh I thought is all powerful why
[36:28] is this still here that's a devil trying
[36:30] to rob you that's a devil trying to make
[36:33] you accept doubt no but we should we
[36:35] should say no no no our God is able our
[36:39] God is able I'm going to accept Faith
[36:41] amen because doubts and worries and
[36:43] fears has helped no one from Adam when
[36:46] he fell to today not a single person has
[36:49] been helped by doubt not a single person
[36:51] has been helped by worrying Amen brother
[36:53] BR even said well what if you going to
[36:54] be shot in the morning what good would
[36:57] Faith do this well Faith might deliver
[36:59] he says what's the point of worrying
[37:00] about it it's not going to change
[37:01] anything well what can Faith do faith
[37:04] can deliver you so I'd rather work on
[37:06] faith I'd rather actually take God at
[37:08] his word irrespective of what I'm facing
[37:10] in front of me I'll take God at his word
[37:13] anytime amen because God is looking for
[37:16] a response and it's a response that to
[37:19] me ignites the
[37:22] supernatural Jesus was walking on water
[37:25] the disciples in the boat thought he was
[37:27] a SP Spirit but he says be of good cheer
[37:29] it Des I Be not Afraid and Peter
[37:31] answered him and said Lord if it be thou
[37:34] bid me to come unto thee on the water
[37:38] and he said come and when Peter was come
[37:39] out of the ship he walked on the water
[37:41] to go to Jesus now so so there was an in
[37:44] so Lord if this is you invite me to
[37:47] where you're walking amen so invite me
[37:49] to your Victorious walk Lord invite me
[37:52] to walk upon the storm Lord if this is
[37:54] you and you're calling me I will come
[37:56] out to you amen and this is what the
[37:58] Lord wants us to do he he's bit us to
[38:00] walk with him amen he conquered hell
[38:02] death in the grave he conquered the
[38:04] devil he conquered self amen amen he
[38:07] conquered everything that could be
[38:09] conquered and he wants you to walk with
[38:13] him in this Victorious walk and he's bid
[38:15] you to come prise the Lord this is what
[38:17] this message does this message is an
[38:19] invitation come walk with me amen come
[38:21] walk with me Lord Jes you the Lord Jesus
[38:23] saying come this what the message is
[38:24] about God wants to walk with you God
[38:27] wants to talk to you God wants to have
[38:28] fellowship with you God wants to prove
[38:30] his word in your life this is what this
[38:31] is what the message has come to do all
[38:34] right maybe very simple but hey I'm a
[38:35] simple guy you know but this is this is
[38:38] God has bid us come walk with me in the
[38:41] storm as we heard in the in the um
[38:43] convention right we're going to get out
[38:45] of the boat sure but God calls us to
[38:47] walk with him and he wouldn't have
[38:49] bidden Peter to get out of the boat if
[38:51] he knew Peter was going to sink he's not
[38:54] that kind of a god he's not that you
[38:56] know you know setting up someone to fail
[38:58] he doesn't set up anyone to fail no he
[39:01] sets us up to succeed but we know the
[39:03] rest of the story Peter was walking they
[39:05] looked at the wind and the waves that
[39:07] were already there and he began to sink
[39:10] but then as he sinking he said Lord help
[39:12] me I perish it it says immediately Jesus
[39:15] took him by the hand and rescued him I
[39:17] mean so even when you begin to feel like
[39:18] you're sinking just cry out Lord help me
[39:20] I'm I'm drowning in this trial he'll
[39:23] pick you up amen he'll he'll set your
[39:25] feet on a solid ground in the middle an
[39:27] ocean am hallelujah amen he will he will
[39:32] he will set your feet on water that
[39:34] actually should not be able to be is not
[39:36] walkable Hallelujah that's our God he
[39:40] say well I don't know if he can do it he
[39:41] did it for Peter remember and now Peter
[39:44] did not have any promise in the Bible
[39:46] you'll walk on water he could not take
[39:48] out the scroll of Isaiah Jeremiah or one
[39:51] of them and say oh the Lord said Thou
[39:53] shalt walk on water therefore I walking
[39:55] no God just invited him
[39:57] come and he took God at his word amen
[40:00] and he stepped out of the boat and
[40:01] started walking he took God at his he
[40:03] was looking for a response from the
[40:05] disciples that they would take him at
[40:07] his word and good old Peter he's he's
[40:09] always first on the trigger I'm coming
[40:12] Hallelujah he wasn't waiting for on us
[40:14] to respond he wanted to respond and mean
[40:16] and God wants us to respond to his word
[40:18] I mean because Peter's response brought
[40:20] the supernatural into his life amen he
[40:23] maybe not even really fathomed really
[40:24] what he was going to do but he saw Jesus
[40:26] was there Jesus Lord if you invite me
[40:28] I'm coming and Jesus said come and he
[40:32] came Hallelujah and he didn't walk on
[40:34] water once he walked on water twice
[40:37] praise the Lord amen so the Lord is
[40:39] looking for a supernatural
[40:41] response I mean for a response and that
[40:43] response brings the supernatural now the
[40:46] three Hebrew
[40:47] children they they were under intense
[40:50] pressure to
[40:51] Bow but they took God at his word and
[40:54] they said we're not going to bow to an
[40:55] image yes it says it in the law Thou
[40:58] shalt not bow to any image right so they
[41:01] saw the image they read the word and
[41:04] they said no this this this is not
[41:06] compatible with who we are cuz we are
[41:09] this word amen we're not just Hebrews we
[41:11] are this word we're the people of the
[41:13] book amen and our God who wrote this law
[41:16] who's lived with our ancestors has said
[41:18] You shall not bow to an image so they
[41:20] get dragged before Nebuchadnezzar you
[41:22] know cuz after they go the first time
[41:23] and the music plays and they stand
[41:25] straight up and everyone else bows down
[41:27] and you know there's you know they you
[41:29] know they're brought before
[41:29] Nebuchadnezzar they just they just said
[41:32] you know we won't be careful how we're
[41:33] going to answer you with this we're not
[41:35] going to Bow if God delivers us he will
[41:38] if he won't well this is the last day we
[41:40] see you anyway but we're not going to
[41:42] Bow we're going to we have taken God at
[41:44] his word amen and that's what God is
[41:47] looking for in this age of people that
[41:49] will take God at his word amen they
[41:51] won't they won't bend it to change their
[41:53] situation they will stay with it in
[41:56] spite of everything amen now remember
[41:58] they did not have a
[42:00] promise of any of the prophets saying
[42:02] and you shall be thrown into fire and
[42:04] you come out but they took God at his
[42:07] word you shall not bow whatever the
[42:09] outcome was that was up to God hey if
[42:11] they died in the fire they still would
[42:13] have been
[42:14] Victorious amen they still would have
[42:15] been Victorious even if they got burned
[42:17] up in the fire they said no whatever
[42:19] happens is going to happen now we know
[42:22] as as brother BR loved to dramatize it
[42:25] you know there was there was a three
[42:26] Hebrew children in front of
[42:27] Nebuchadnezzar and there's you know you
[42:29] look up in heaven there's a there's a
[42:30] big scene there God's on his great big
[42:32] Throne his great big Majestic robes
[42:35] Hallelujah and then wormwood comes one
[42:37] of his angels comes up and says Master
[42:40] have you not seen what's going down in
[42:41] Babylon you know the Lord's been
[42:42] watching the whole time his eyes on the
[42:44] sparrow I know he watches me I mean I
[42:47] know the eye of the Lord is upon us if
[42:49] we're sleeping he's watching if we're
[42:51] awake we're watching we're brushing our
[42:52] teeth he's watching what he he's
[42:54] watching all the time I'm never out of
[42:56] his care I'm never out of his sight he
[42:58] has no blind spots Hallelujah he's never
[43:01] distracted amen he's watching me and
[43:02] he's watching them sitting on his great
[43:04] big Throne worood comes up Master don't
[43:07] you know what's happening three of your
[43:09] children are going to be thrown to the
[43:10] furnace they're standing for you can I

[43:15] them I can do it I drown the world in
[43:18] the end of lovian Destruction I will
[43:19] drown these you I'll drown Babylon
[43:22] Nebuchadnezzar thinks he's so great I'll
[43:24] deal with him and God says wormwood

[43:28] since I created you ww you've stayed
[43:30] true you've done exactly what I asked
[43:32] you to do you've been good since the
[43:33] Year Dot you've been good but I can't

[43:45] before the foundation of the world they
[43:47] were considered amen they were never out
[43:49] of the care of the Lord God Amen and
[43:52] then and then and then you know then
[43:53] Gabriel says Lord just let me go down
[43:55] there one swing
[43:57] I'll make one person
[43:59] two I'll kill them
[44:01] all he could have done it yeah it's
[44:04] amazing Jesus you know Jesus would say
[44:06] you know uh I could call call for 12
[44:09] Legions of angels a legion is about
[44:12] 5,000 odd troops that's a lot of angels
[44:14] one could have just wiped out that whole
[44:17] whole thing there with Jesus you know
[44:19] you before he went to Calvary right just
[44:21] one how how much 12 Legions of angels
[44:24] Gabriel could have killed them all down
[44:25] there in Babylon but the Lord said no I
[44:27] can't let you go I can't let you go
[44:30] you're a good Angel Gabriel you're
[44:31] fought you've done I mean Michael or you
[44:34] you've done great things for me but I
[44:36] can't let you go well then what are you
[44:37] going to do and God says no no no no
[44:39] this is not an angelized job this is a
[44:41] god-sized job amen they've stood for me
[44:43] I'm going to stand with them amen amen
[44:45] and just as they're being carried into
[44:47] the furnace isn't amazing that even the
[44:50] strong soldiers that were you were
[44:52] carrying cuz they were tied up and
[44:54] they're going to be thrown to the
[44:55] furnace the strong ones that were
[44:56] carrying them actually were so overcome
[44:58] by the heat they died and just as I
[45:00] being thrown into the furnace amen what
[45:02] what happened God came he took a detour
[45:05] pass the Tree of Life took a took a big
[45:07] leaf off there amen went zigzagging down
[45:09] these Forks of lightning and was in the
[45:11] in the furnace in the furnace what what
[45:14] caused it a supernatural response to
[45:17] God's wordu where Shadrach mesach and
[45:19] big said we will not bow we may burn but
[45:22] we're not going to Bow God May Deliver
[45:24] us but we're not going to bow it was a
[45:25] supernatural resp response to the word
[45:27] of God brought God on the scene amen and
[45:30] they had and they had Fellowship now
[45:33] with the Fourth Man in that fire and
[45:35] brother Bram says that God was
[45:37] fellowshipping with them about their
[45:39] future Hallelujah and it's the same
[45:42] thing with you and I friends we are in a
[45:43] place just like that furnace was was was
[45:46] heated seven times hotter and Lady OA is
[45:49] seven times hotter than any other age
[45:50] just gone before but what happens the
[45:52] fourth man has stepped down cuz he says
[45:55] you know he says no this is a God size
[45:57] job My bride is upon the Earth amen
[45:59] she's taken me at my word amen she
[46:02] stands for me I'm going to stand for her
[46:04] amen that whatever happens in her life
[46:07] she's going to trust me no matter what
[46:09] if sickness strikes she'll trust me if
[46:11] if if there's no money to buy food she's
[46:13] going to trust me if there's no job
[46:15] she's going to trust me and nowhere to
[46:17] live she's going to trust me family goes
[46:19] away with she's going to trust me amen
[46:21] so I'm going to stand for her Hallelujah
[46:24] so what's happened he has come down into
[46:25] this age what to do to fellowship with
[46:28] you in your trial to tell you of your
[46:31] future hallelujah amen that's why the
[46:34] prophet would stand and say I'm going to
[46:35] tell you about your future home I'm
[46:37] going to tell you about how you get
[46:38] there you need the Holy Ghost you need
[46:40] the token hallelujah amen I'm going to
[46:41] tell you all about the devil does sure
[46:43] but I'm going to tell you where you're
[46:44] going to go I'm going to tell you about
[46:46] the streets of gold you're going to walk
[46:47] on I'm going to tell you about the
[46:49] Throne of God I'm going to tell you that
[46:50] you're the queen in the palace I mean
[46:52] I'm going to tell you where you're going
[46:53] to be when when the when the heavens and
[46:56] earth are Ren ated that's right H I'm
[46:58] going to tell you all about that and
[46:59] there's something within us says yes
[47:02] there's something within us says that's
[47:04] me am mean there's something with it
[47:06] says amen I can identify with that word
[47:08] and what does it do it produces a
[47:10] supernatural response amen because
[47:13] remember when two omnipotents meet the
[47:15] supernatural takes place and we know
[47:17] redeemed man is omnipotent amen because
[47:20] God said himself there is nothing
[47:22] impossible with you all things are
[47:25] possible to them that believe amen and
[47:27] we've got to realize that's irrespective
[47:29] if we have a good day a bad day happy
[47:31] day sad day mind battle no mind battle
[47:33] pain no pain sickness health wealth poor
[47:36] whatever irrespective faith is
[47:38] completely different to those things am
[47:40] mean because we do not walk by feelings
[47:42] or how we think or would no we walk by
[47:44] faith we walk by Revelation am mean just
[47:47] like Peter youo if it's you Lord bid me
[47:50] to come I come it was a revelation I can
[47:52] walk on the water yes I can walk like
[47:54] Jesus walked it was a revelation of in
[47:56] Peter's heart he started walking amen
[47:59] hallelujah amen isn't that the same with
[48:01] you and I God has given us a revelation
[48:03] amen walk with me and we say yes Lord
[48:05] You've B me to come I'm
[48:07] coming hallelujah amen amen amen see so
[48:11] a super so when two omnipotence meet
[48:13] amen the supernatural takes place so
[48:16] when God and man meet together
[48:18] something's got to shake something's got
[48:20] to move amen it it cannot remain the
[48:22] same there cannot be a status quo amen
[48:25] when whenever you read the gospel or all
[48:27] all the way through the Bible when God
[48:30] was taken at his word the supernatural
[48:32] was T took place amen amen when the
[48:36] hallelujah amen when people came in
[48:38] contact with the Lord and knew he was
[48:40] more than a man the supernatural took
[48:42] place am mean when the four men took
[48:44] their friend on a a stretcher and they
[48:47] couldn't get into the house where Jesus
[48:48] was they tore the roof off and love the
[48:50] friend and what was that that was two
[48:52] omnipotence meeting amen and it wasn't
[48:55] for them it was for their friend amen
[48:57] there was actually it actually brought
[48:59] healing virtue out of our Lord Jesus for
[49:01] their friend amen why because it was a
[49:03] supernatural response the Lord is here
[49:06] the Messiah is here this is more than a
[49:08] prophet here this is the god man this is
[49:10] the Messiah this is my Messiah this is
[49:12] my lamb this is the king of kings this
[49:14] is Emmanuel and mean he's walking our
[49:16] streets and we have a need and I can get
[49:18] this need into his presence and he's
[49:20] going to do what he wants to do what he
[49:22] can do amen see if they were doubting
[49:25] they wouldn't have taken the the roof
[49:27] off that's a lot of work man what about
[49:30] the repair Bill all those things you
[49:32] know no they wouldn't have done it if
[49:33] they didn't believe it remember they
[49:35] didn't have any he didn't say anything
[49:37] to them yes bring them through the roof
[49:39] no he was preaching or doing whatever he
[49:41] was doing the Lord was they said no we
[49:43] got to get our friend to Jesus we're
[49:44] going to take away all the hindrances
[49:47] anything that's in the way all the
[49:48] unbelief and skepticism whatever more
[49:50] we're going to pull it off how do we
[49:52] pull it off by
[49:53] prayer amen you know prayer you you an
[49:57] and I talking in the car you know you
[49:59] know you know those times when when you
[50:01] pray but it's not you praying who's had
[50:03] those times is there have those times
[50:05] when it it just starts flowing and and
[50:07] you start praying for things you're not
[50:08] even conscious of yes Lord who's doing
[50:11] that that's God that's the Holy Ghost
[50:15] praying through you I mean what has
[50:16] happened now two omnipotents have met
[50:20] now the Supernatural is taking place I
[50:22] mean it's not you just praying out of
[50:24] your mind of a need no it's God praying
[50:26] through you
[50:27] hallelujah
[50:29] amen friends God has made God has placed
[50:32] us up into Heavenly places am where
[50:35] where where the Lord dwells his position
[50:37] above all the devils and everything he
[50:39] has redeemed Us by his blood amen he has
[50:42] made us new creatures in Christ amen he
[50:44] has made us his body upon the Earth amen
[50:48] so God is looking for a response but you
[50:50] got to realize you have the response
[50:52] within you I don't believe I'm looking
[50:54] at anyone who doesn't believe in God
[50:57] I believe I'm looking at sincere people
[51:00] who have had experience with the Lord
[51:02] whatever age you are you've had
[51:03] experience with the Lord God's done
[51:04] something in your life don't let the
[51:06] devil cloud your mind you can't remember
[51:08] those things don't let him downplay
[51:10] those things no those are Eternal things
[51:12] I mean if this Bible is still being
[51:13] written you would be in this Bible amen
[51:15] because the book of Acts is still being
[51:17] written amen there'll be a there'll be a
[51:19] chapter or two of your life in there
[51:22] amen hallelujah why because of God's
[51:24] done Eternal thing so never let the
[51:25] devil diminish what he has done I mean
[51:28] never let him think well it didn't
[51:30] really happen and how do you know that
[51:31] really happened and no it really
[51:33] happened you were there the devil can't
[51:35] take out of my life the things the Lord
[51:37] has done for me he can never say no that
[51:39] wasn't the love of God that filled your
[51:41] heart when you washing dishes at College
[51:42] house there working no I was there I had
[51:45] the experience amen he can't say this
[51:47] Bible's not personal to me no I was
[51:49] there when I was reading it it became a
[51:51] new book amen he can't say that God
[51:53] doesn't move here no I've had the
[51:55] experience I've seen him move amen I've
[51:57] seen the effects of the pillar of fire
[51:58] in our lives amen so we must always say
[52:02] Lord that was you Hallelujah and what
[52:05] does that do that ignites now a
[52:07] supernatural response because because
[52:10] like hady right she's hearing the
[52:11] testimony brother Brown shooting the
[52:13] squirrels speaking speaking them into
[52:16] existence amen and she said that's
[52:19] nothing but the truth hallelujah and
[52:21] then the Lord said to him tell her
[52:24] whatever she wants she'll have it praise
[52:26] the Lord it it produced a super
[52:29] anointing in that house brother B called
[52:31] it a super anointing her response to a
[52:34] testimony of God's creative power amen
[52:36] brought creative power into the room
[52:39] Hallelujah and that creative power
[52:40] created a desire amen for God and her
[52:43] two sons Lord amen so how powerful it is
[52:46] it when we say yes Lord when we take him
[52:48] at his word when we say Amen we say yes
[52:51] Lord I agree with that yes Lord your
[52:53] word is true you may be reading the
[52:54] scripture he says amen amen you hear the
[52:57] prophet say Amen something in you says
[52:59] yes that's right what happens now A
[53:00] Creative power comes down Hallelujah to
[53:03] actually fulfill the greatest desire in
[53:05] our hearts remember she could have had a
[53:07] million dollars she could have had a lot
[53:09] of things she could have had her sister
[53:10] come out of the wheelchair old old
[53:12] parents you know could have been made
[53:13] well or young again but her main thing
[53:15] was the salvation of her
[53:19] boys Hallelujah you think about the um
[53:22] you know the woman of you know in you
[53:24] know the woman of Memphis
[53:26] what caused brother braham's plane to be

[53:47] him it wasn't him there was a woman a
[53:50] poor little woman living in a shotgun
[53:52] shack who had a need amen but she had a
[53:55] supernatural response to God Amen she
[53:58] took God at his word amen and that
[54:01] caused brother that caused him to walk
[54:04] down I don't know how many miles
[54:05] someone's done it it's quite a few miles
[54:06] he's just you he's walking and the voice

[54:53] it in the vision so he he now comes into
[54:56] the house it says God bless this home he
[54:59] said I've been in King's palaces but

[55:07] you know um he asked her my name's
[55:10] Brandon do you know who I am and she
[55:12] says no I've never heard of you but I'm
[55:14] like the shite woman in the
[55:15] Bible amen so what happened is she was
[55:19] reading that story and God quickened to
[55:21] her you or that and she said amen
[55:25] hallelujah he spoke to her and she spoke
[55:28] back to him saying yes Lord I'm that
[55:30] what's happening now a supernatural
[55:33] response is going to come and then a
[55:35] storm comes a plane is grounded it has
[55:38] Elijah in it hallelujah hallelujah and
[55:41] God and her faith pulls the prophet into
[55:44] her house doesn't know who he is that

[55:58] you pray first
[56:00] auntie and she started talking to God he
[56:02] said you could tell she spoken to him
[56:05] before amen and then brother Bram
[56:07] started praying and when he started
[56:08] praying he said yeah the boy on the bed
[56:10] was saying it's dark and he said it's
[56:11] getting light in here now whose Faith

[56:30] faith brought God on the scene through
[56:34] the prophet messenger amen hallelujah
[56:36] why because she had the right response
[56:37] to the word amen why CU two omnipotence
[56:41] met something's got to shake amen that's
[56:43] why it's so important to walk in faith
[56:46] amen walk in love what do you mean to
[56:49] walk in something well it's like if you
[56:51] have money in your pocket and you go
[56:52] walk in the mall if you like the mall
[56:54] you enjoy the mall
[56:57] not everyone but I'm saying
[56:59] hypothetically okay just wherever your
[57:01] favorite place is put yourself there I
[57:03] say go walk in it you're not going to
[57:06] just come near the front door and not no
[57:08] you're going to go in you're going to
[57:09] experience things you're going to enjoy
[57:10] it amen it's like walking in the love of
[57:13] the Lord what are you going to do you're
[57:14] going to enjoy him you're going to love
[57:17] him amen you're going to praise him more
[57:20] hallelujah amen because God wants our
[57:23] love to abound yes it's like WR in
[57:26] Philippians here that your love may
[57:28] abound yet more sorry I'm kind of
[57:29] segueing back to this but he wants our
[57:31] love to abound yet more and more a
[57:34] knowledge and in all judgment that ye
[57:37] may approve things which are excellent
[57:39] that ye may be sincere and without
[57:41] offense till the day of Christ now don't
[57:44] let the devil push it down you saying
[57:45] you can't be um sincere and without
[57:48] offense see you know you talk about the
[57:51] promises of God the Devil comes along
[57:52] and says no that's not for you look at
[57:54] your past look at what you've been
[57:56] thinking look at what you've gone
[57:57] through look at the Mind battles you've
[57:59] had look at your troubles he puts those
[58:00] things against you for you to back
[58:04] up yep or is it just me he does that too
[58:08] see we got to defy those things right he
[58:11] puts that resistance in your mind
[58:13] because he knows if you take God at his
[58:15] word and discount him he's finished
[58:18] that's it remember just like Caleb they
[58:20] had to go he had to go kill Giants on
[58:21] his Mountain give me my Mountain Joshua
[58:24] it's yours he had to go fight it amen
[58:27] every long neck Giant on that mountain
[58:28] he he had to put to the sword because
[58:31] they are squatting on his promise amen
[58:33] and it's the same thing with you and I
[58:35] the devil doesn't want us to have joy he
[58:38] doesn't want us to have love you know
[58:39] the power of the spoken word is within
[58:42] you that creative power like it was in
[58:44] hady right like it was in that woman in
[58:46] Memphis that power is within you the
[58:49] same power that Ena Peter to walk on the
[58:52] water is in you that's right hallelujah
[58:54] amen it is in the bride of Christ it's
[58:56] not somewhere far away it's in you right
[58:58] now the impossible for the impossible to
[59:00] become manifested is within you
[59:03] hallelujah amen it's like the man with
[59:05] the prodical son it seemed impossible
[59:07] for that son ever to come home he made
[59:10] up in his mind long before he left that
[59:12] he wanted to leave and then finally says
[59:14] give me my inheritance I'm out of here I
[59:16] can't put up with this Holy Roller kind
[59:18] of kind of Lifestyle no more I want to
[59:19] go see the world his heart was set on it
[59:22] I believe his prayers created a desire
[59:26] in that prodical son's heart because
[59:28] when he was there in the pig pin it says
[59:29] and he came to himself well what
[59:32] happened God was answering the prayer of
[59:34] the father and the mother amen because
[59:36] they said no he is one of ours he has a
[59:39] covenant with God though he doesn't
[59:40] realize it he is a circumcised son of
[59:42] Abraham and he's coming home when's he
[59:44] coming home Papa I don't know that's
[59:46] God's job but he's coming home the same
[59:48] way he left us the same path he's going
[59:50] to walk back but he's going to be a
[59:51] different son amen so what happened is
[59:53] they took God at his word what thine and
[59:56] thy seed will be there amen I will put
[59:59] my word in you and your seed and your
[1:00:02] seed seed it says in Isaiah Hallelujah
[1:00:05] they took God at his word they took the
[1:00:06] promise of God said yes Lord this is my
[1:00:08] promise and I'm not settling for
[1:00:10] anything second I'm going to take this
[1:00:12] promise Lord I'm going to remind you of
[1:00:14] the promise amen because this is my
[1:00:16] promise amen your blood puts me in
[1:00:18] condition that this promise is mine it's
[1:00:20] the same thing with the blood of Jesus
[1:00:22] Christ his blood puts us in condition
[1:00:24] that every promise in the word is ours
[1:00:27] right now amen not not someday right now
[1:00:30] the promise is ours amen that's why
[1:00:32] we're going to take but then the devil
[1:00:33] says no you can't Merit it you don't
[1:00:35] deserve it it's not yours look at what
[1:00:38] you've done look what you allow to
[1:00:39] happen forget all that he's trying you
[1:00:42] to sit there in no man's land wondering
[1:00:44] if the promise is yours or not the
[1:00:46] promise is yours Jesus has given it to
[1:00:48] you like if I had a billion dollars I
[1:00:50] said who wants it man there would be a
[1:00:52] lot of unchristian behavior maybe people
[1:00:55] pushing each other out of the way isn't
[1:00:57] that right well hopefully not but you
[1:00:59] know if you go on the street man you get
[1:01:01] ripped apart you know people take the
[1:01:02] money off you because they see it's real
[1:01:05] and they say it's mine because he's
[1:01:07] given it to me doesn't matter where they
[1:01:09] come from what their name is age
[1:01:10] whatever know if that man's offering me
[1:01:12] a billion dollars and I see it in his
[1:01:14] hand I want it how real has these
[1:01:17] promises become how real has this word
[1:01:19] become it's become more real every year
[1:01:23] the promises of God become more tangible
[1:01:25] more manifested so what's God doing he's
[1:01:27] saying look all these promises are yours
[1:01:30] hallelujah hallelujah don't let the
[1:01:31] devil hold them back don't the devil say
[1:01:34] no they're not yours no it's like Jesus
[1:01:36] saying to Peter come I B you to come
[1:01:40] come and walk with me and that's what
[1:01:42] the Lord wants us he's bid us come walk
[1:01:44] amen oh but don't you know this about me
[1:01:46] the Lord knows everything okay he looked
[1:01:49] down just like our opening scripture and
[1:01:50] numbers there he saw everything that was
[1:01:52] happening in in Israel
[1:01:56] but yet he says I see no iniquity in
[1:01:58] these people there's no perverses
[1:02:00] there's nothing there's nothing bad
[1:02:02] their God is with them and the Shad of
[1:02:04] the king is among
[1:02:05] them hallelujah amen it's the same thing
[1:02:08] so he wants our love to abound more and
[1:02:11] more we got to realize every promise is
[1:02:13] ours now Hallelujah but the reason he
[1:02:16] wants our love to abound is that we
[1:02:18] would get more and more in knowledge and
[1:02:21] in all judgment okay what is the I I
[1:02:24] trust now to me when he's talking about
[1:02:26] knowledge here to me he's not talking
[1:02:28] about in the head he's talking about
[1:02:30] Revelation knowledge amen Godly
[1:02:32] knowledge right Godly wisdom and what
[1:02:35] has become to me what has become more
[1:02:37] apparent we're
[1:02:39] his we're his the power of the blood is
[1:02:43] becoming more apparent day by day amen
[1:02:45] the quickening power of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:47] amen the realities of God Amen they
[1:02:49] they're not diminishing they're becoming
[1:02:51] more real amen the more you look in the
[1:02:53] word the more you hear the message faith
[1:02:54] is building yeah faith is building amen
[1:02:57] the you're the promises one you maybe
[1:03:00] once upon a time they seem so far away
[1:03:02] how could that ever happen something
[1:03:03] within you says it's now it's for
[1:03:05] me who's had that kind of you know
[1:03:08] realization you realize I am a son or
[1:03:11] daughter of God I'm not hoping I am I am
[1:03:15] hallelujah hallelujah amen so what's
[1:03:17] happening now see see the love may bow
[1:03:20] more and more in knowledge and in all
[1:03:22] judgment so now if we realize who we are
[1:03:25] then the Devil comes along against us we
[1:03:28] can tell him to get oh yeah we can tell
[1:03:30] him to get lost he already is but get
[1:03:32] lost even more go jump in the lake devil
[1:03:35] am mean we can tell him that no this
[1:03:37] Covenant with God is with me and God
[1:03:40] he's not even in the picture that's it
[1:03:42] he's just the accuser of the Brethren he
[1:03:43] can accuse all he wants no I've got a
[1:03:45] blood tag amen I mean I've got the Holy
[1:03:48] Ghost I've got I've got a seal of a
[1:03:49] finished work in my life amen why
[1:03:52] because I believe the word something in
[1:03:54] me says this word is true
[1:03:56] something in me says this is not man's
[1:03:58] writings something in me says this is
[1:03:59] all inspired and the covers inspired
[1:04:02] also the Holy Bible That's inspired
[1:04:04] Hallelujah are you with me something in
[1:04:06] me says every promise is true every word
[1:04:08] is true and I can take God at his word
[1:04:11] amen that you may approve so I'm just
[1:04:13] going to repeat this again that you may
[1:04:14] approve things that are excellent that
[1:04:16] you may be sincere and without offense
[1:04:18] till the day of Christ being filled with
[1:04:20] the fruits of righteousness which are by
[1:04:23] Jesus Christ unto glory and praise of
[1:04:25] God God so your love abounding causes
[1:04:29] these things to come into place Glory
[1:04:31] who loves them more now who loves them
[1:04:34] more was it that is love abounding you
[1:04:36] know isn't it amazing we could say we
[1:04:38] are the answer to this
[1:04:40] prayer Glory I know there's been
[1:04:43] Believers down Through the Ages but this
[1:04:44] was God writing through the Apostle Paul
[1:04:46] I want your love to abound what does he
[1:04:48] do he he calls our love to abound amen
[1:04:51] now this word abound it has many
[1:04:53] different meanings but it means to see a
[1:04:56] fixed number of measure to be left over
[1:04:58] and above a certain number or measure so
[1:04:59] it's greater than a amount amen it's to
[1:05:03] exist or be at hand in abundance
[1:05:06] Hallelujah we have the abundance of the
[1:05:08] love of God Amen it's to be great amen
[1:05:11] it's one which comes in abundance or
[1:05:13] overflows unto one something that falls
[1:05:16] to the lot of one in large measure we're
[1:05:19] rich people brothers and sisters we're
[1:05:22] loaded with spiritual things we are rich
[1:05:26] we doesn't matter about natural riches
[1:05:27] we are rich in the things that matter
[1:05:30] Amen in spiritual things amen it means
[1:05:32] to it means to overflow to abundantly
[1:05:35] furnish with to have an abundance Amen
[1:05:37] to be in affluence to be preeminent to
[1:05:42] excel our lives are governed I trust
[1:05:45] your life is governed by the love of God
[1:05:47] amen amen it has preeminence in your
[1:05:50] life I mean you live the way you live
[1:05:52] because you love the Lord not because
[1:05:54] you have to not cuz it's expected
[1:05:55] because you love him amen it excels amen
[1:05:58] now this word so I'm just going through
[1:05:59] some definitions here that you may be
[1:06:01] sincere that word sincere means pure
[1:06:04] sincere unsullied found pure when
[1:06:06] unfolded and examined by the
[1:06:10] sunlight now it should be the s o n
[1:06:12] light this just the the dictionary
[1:06:15] definition but you know when we're
[1:06:17] examined by the sunlight like Peter was
[1:06:19] after the resurrection there's youo youo
[1:06:22] they're fishing all night they went back
[1:06:23] to their old life they're disappointed
[1:06:25] down asked and then they didn't catch
[1:06:27] anything and then they see a man on the
[1:06:29] seashore have you caught anything and
[1:06:31] John with his eagle eyes told Peter it's
[1:06:33] the Lord and Peter doesn't know how he's
[1:06:36] going to be what's going to happen he's
[1:06:37] denied the Lord three
[1:06:39] times he's got this lead weight kind of
[1:06:42] feeling going on because the one man the
[1:06:45] the one who thought would stand among
[1:06:47] the disciples maybe he thought man
[1:06:48] John's aissy Andrew's introverted you
[1:06:52] know Phillips like this Bartholomew oh
[1:06:54] sons of thunder you're right you know
[1:06:56] all stand and he miserably failed he's
[1:06:59] living under This Cloud but yet he sees
[1:07:02] the Lord on the sea he just jumps in and
[1:07:05] starts swimming towards them not knowing
[1:07:08] what's going to happen but there's
[1:07:09] something that just drew him to God
[1:07:11] hallelujah and it should be the same
[1:07:13] thing with you and I friends we may
[1:07:14] disappoint ourselves disappoint our
[1:07:16] family disappoint all kind of people
[1:07:18] disappoint the Lord but something always
[1:07:20] goes back to him Hallelujah and then he
[1:07:23] comes there then now now what's going to
[1:07:25] happen
[1:07:26] Peter Peter's sincerity is going to be
[1:07:28] examined by sunlight Peter do you love
[1:07:32] me Lord I love you feed my sheep Peter
[1:07:35] do you love me Lord I love you feed my
[1:07:38] Lambs Peter do you love me oh my Lord
[1:07:42] you know I love you Hallelujah what's
[1:07:45] happening his sincerity was examined by
[1:07:48] sunlight and Jesus didn't say no you're
[1:07:50] making that up Peter he knew Peter loved
[1:07:53] him and isn't it amazing you know we can
[1:07:56] we can start the day on on the fishing
[1:07:59] boat
[1:08:01] disappointed dejected downcast but then
[1:08:05] he comes and we go to
[1:08:08] him his presence comes you know what I'm
[1:08:10] talking about amen and then you speak to
[1:08:13] him in prayer or praise or what and then
[1:08:15] he speaks back to you hallelujah amen
[1:08:19] and you say Lord you know I love you
[1:08:22] Lord you know that you're my everything
[1:08:23] what's happening that your sincerity is
[1:08:25] being tested by sunlight and what does
[1:08:27] he say yes my child I know
[1:08:30] hallelujah amen and to be without
[1:08:34] offense this means not leading into sin
[1:08:37] sin is
[1:08:38] unbelief hallelujah amen that we may
[1:08:41] approve things that are excellent that
[1:08:42] we may be sincere and without offense so
[1:08:46] without anything that leads into
[1:08:49] unbelief till the day of Christ this is
[1:08:52] what the love abounding more and more
[1:08:54] does amen amen and and as our love
[1:08:57] abounds what happens the word becomes
[1:08:58] more positive the word becomes a greater
[1:09:01] reality I mean we can take God at his
[1:09:04] word we can believe for the impossible
[1:09:06] amen amen I believe I'm looking at
[1:09:07] people that can believe for the
[1:09:08] impossible tonight amen I believe I'm
[1:09:11] you I'm looking at a people that are
[1:09:13] built to believe for the impossible I
[1:09:15] mean for things that naturally seem they
[1:09:17] cannot happen something in you says I
[1:09:18] take you at your word Lord amen I take
[1:09:21] it your promises my God hallelujah
[1:09:26] amen praise the lord we just got to take
[1:09:29] him at his
[1:09:31] word
[1:09:34] hallelujah amen just like we have so
[1:09:37] many promises we can take God's word at
[1:09:39] we can take him at his word amen so I
[1:09:42] think we should more than anything in
[1:09:44] this day and
[1:09:46] age if your conscience tells you it's
[1:09:49] not true lay it aside if your reasoning
[1:09:52] says it can't happen lay it aside if
[1:09:54] your imagine ation doesn't imagine
[1:09:57] imagine God's word being fulfilled lay
[1:09:58] it aside lay aside everything that's
[1:10:01] contrary to God's word amen if your if
[1:10:04] your affection is telling you no there's
[1:10:07] nothing to this word lay it aside amen
[1:10:09] if the devil's telling you no you can
[1:10:11] never be free lay that lie aside amen
[1:10:14] lay it all aside take God at his word
[1:10:16] amen take God's word and take everything
[1:10:19] that's contrary and put it on a scales
[1:10:21] you know which one will hit the ground
[1:10:22] faster than anything it'll be God's word
[1:10:24] God's word outweighs anything the devil
[1:10:26] can put in our mind but we've got to
[1:10:28] work let Faith work am mean don't let
[1:10:31] reasoning work don't let trouble work
[1:10:33] don't let conscious work no let the word
[1:10:35] of God work well how do you do that you
[1:10:38] take him at his word that's nothing but
[1:10:41] the
[1:10:41] truth

[1:11:02] there God wants us to take him at his
[1:11:05] word
[1:11:06] amen praise the
[1:11:10] lord we should never back up on any
[1:11:12] promise doesn't matter what other people
[1:11:14] have done with it they're not
[1:11:16] me amen doesn't what doesn't matter what
[1:11:19] other people done with the message
[1:11:20] they're not me okay it's God's word's
[1:11:24] true it works
[1:11:26] amen it does what it says it'll do it
[1:11:28] will not return to him void but will
[1:11:30] accomplish that which it has promised
[1:11:33] amen praise let's just pull that out one
[1:11:35] more time you know I stood in the
[1:11:37] Solomon Islands I took the scripture and
[1:11:40] then I just gave testimony after
[1:11:42] testimony of
[1:11:44] this in these four walls at Camp
[1:11:47] different lives I said God's word says
[1:11:49] he's a deliverer this is a Deliverance
[1:11:52] God says he's a Healer he's testimony
[1:11:54] after testimony
[1:11:55] God said he'll bring the protocols
[1:11:57] home Hallelujah I just went through
[1:12:00] testimony after testimony I said look
[1:12:03] God's word will not return to him void
[1:12:04] it will accomplish that which he
[1:12:06] purposed it will do amen and our God
[1:12:08] hasn't changed he hasn't taken his he
[1:12:11] hasn't changed his mind about his word
[1:12:12] he hasn't said it can't happen no he's
[1:12:15] already ordained it amen his word is but
[1:12:17] he's looking for a response he's looking
[1:12:20] for us to lay aside all the reasoning
[1:12:22] all the doubt all the questions all and
[1:12:24] say no Lord I take you at your word
[1:12:27] because that's all I can do like Abraham
[1:12:30] he could have reasoned all the day long
[1:12:31] why he couldn't have a child but he
[1:12:33] believed God I mean he took God at his
[1:12:35] word said yes Lord that's nothing but
[1:12:37] the truth I will have Isaac we will have
[1:12:40] the promised son amen and he counted
[1:12:42] everything else as falsehood he didn't
[1:12:44] even consider it no he didn't stagger at
[1:12:47] the promise of God but his strong giving
[1:12:49] God praise amen why cuz he judged God
[1:12:51] faithful praise the Lord amen let's let
[1:12:55] um let's stand tonight and let's sing
[1:12:58] that song
[1:13:00] um say to this mountain um out my God's
[1:13:04] bigger greater stronger than
[1:13:05] you who believes that
[1:13:08] tonight amen we can take God at his word
[1:13:10] isn't it exciting you think God can do
[1:13:13] anything God can do anything in our
[1:13:15] lives amen he can do more than what we
[1:13:17] could even imagine being the
[1:13:19] miraculous hallelujah our god can do
[1:13:22] anything tonight amen why would I worry
[1:13:26] when Giants come calling my name amen
[1:13:29] David actually identified who Goliath
[1:13:31] really was Goliath thought I'm Goliath
[1:13:34] of G look I'm some big giant and David
[1:13:36] said this is an uncircumcised Philistine
[1:13:39] this is this guy this no he has this
[1:13:41] reputation but this is what he really is
[1:13:44] he took God at his word because remember
[1:13:47] Goliath had no Covenant with God he had
[1:13:49] no promise he wasn't one of God's
[1:13:51] covenant people but David was amen so
[1:13:53] cuz God was in Covenant
[1:13:55] with David then David knew hey this
[1:13:58] Giant's going to
[1:13:59] fall amen Goliath intimidated him with
[1:14:02] all kinds of things how do you come what
[1:14:04] what am I a dog you come with me sticks
[1:14:06] and stones and all you know all these
[1:14:08] things I'm going to feed your I'm going
[1:14:10] to feed you to the birds all these
[1:14:11] things and David said no you defy the
[1:14:13] armies of the Living God Amen he had a
[1:14:15] revelation that it wasn't the armies of
[1:14:17] Israel that Goliath was fa defying it
[1:14:20] was the armies of the Living God I mean
[1:14:22] if we realize we are an extension just
[1:14:25] like an army is an extension of a king
[1:14:27] right like so the men of David were an
[1:14:29] extension of David and so the army of
[1:14:31] the Living God an extension of God I
[1:14:34] mean so what is the bride of Christ it's
[1:14:36] the extend it's God upon the Earth right
[1:14:38] where God can live through human beings
[1:14:40] once again so why should we worry when
