it's great to have James in the Dean here god bless you Tracy feel at home I'm awesome Melanie god bless you wonderful to have you as well I mean welcome everyone praise the Lord it's good to be in the house of Lord this morning I mean if you got your Bibles handy let's just go to the Book of Luke in chapter 2 and read the scripture three three places in the scripture I'd like to read the first is and is in Luke chapter 2 and so burning noelia is they going back home to Argentina on Wednesday for two weeks and then you're coming back so god bless you trust you have a safe trip and we'll be praying for you you pray for us and we'll see each other again so I hope you have a good time at home so we've looked Luke two and four and it sees here and Joseph I'd like to thank all the brothers as well it helped with putting a new audio snake and the fallback speaker and things as brother John said was too about technical difficulties but thank you people on who came and helped install it and you know I wish sometimes that we lived in the day we had no electricity life would be simple but hey we can still use these things for God's glory so Eddie I'm sorry Luke 2 and verses 4 to 7 it says here it says and Joseph also went up from her up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea unto the City of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child and it and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end Hebrews chapter 2 um yes brother John was saying you know we were in a Christmas season and I want to my mind is very much my heart is very much on this part of the scripture at this time but let's just read this here it says so Hebrews 2 and 5 to 7 it says for unto a for unto the Angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come where whereof we speak but one in a certain place testify earth saying who was man that thou art mindful of him who was the son of man that thou visitest him they are made of some little lower than the Angels our crown has him with glory and honor and that has set him over the works of thine hands and it says here thou has put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put an all subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him but we see Jesus who has made a little lower than the Angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing unto bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings and we've got one more scripture and first samuel chapter 22 then after we read this we'll pray see us here there's a bit of a context here now remember we read that Jesus was the lineage of David and when I talk about Bethlehem and and David and in Jesus and us as well it's first samuel 20 to 1 and to David therefore departed thence so this is when he's on the run from Saul and escaped to the cave Abdullah and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it they went hither to him and notice everyone and everyone that was in distress who was distressed and everyone that was in debt who had a debt they could not pay everyone that was discontented gave themselves under him and he became a captain over them and were with him about 400 men I mean this bow heads in a just in a word of Prayer gracious father we have opened the pages of your Holy Scripture Lord we have read father some verses and Lord we're praying now as we come to this part of the service Lord may you make them alive in every soul father may you anoint your word to every heart father may you give us attentive ears Lord and may your night not just our ears but our hearts to receive your word and father may it anchor down into our souls and change our lives father and Lord we just want to commit each one into your hands be with those who couldn't be here today Lord may they feel the same atmosphere that is among us father and may you just strengthen us by your word today Lord we want to commit the service into your hands may you just take speaker in here Lord under your control we just yield ourselves to you as your prophet told us the greatest gift anyone could ever have is to get themselves out of the way that's a gift to get ourselves out the way that you can come and live through us Lord and father may you grant it for your glory alone we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen you may have your seats this morning so I want to talk about warrior sons of Bethlehem now we read here yo we've come into a Christmas season and many people are looking back to us first coming but I want to I want to speak of a second coming and I want to speak about David and then Jesus now we understand that there's a reason and the Prophet tells us why Jesus had to be born in Bethlehem because Bethlehem means the house of God's bread and he is the bread that came down from heaven amen so he had to be born there he couldn't be born in Jerusalem or one of the great cities of refuge he had to be born in Bethlehem because he is the God's bread it means he had to come out of the house of God's bread which is what Bethlehem means and also he is the water of here's the well of salvation there's a well there amen so these things are manifested in Jesus Christ and now we also every true believer is born Bethlehem not a physical place but you're born if you've been born again in Christ I mean you've been born in Bethlehem Amen so now David we understand was a great warrior king and he foreshadowed Jesus Christ now there's a people upon the earth where we're gonna read about David's mighty mean now I just pray that the Lord will just helped me this morning I kind of feel a bit I just pray it in the channel but David David was a foreshadow of Christ now he came out of Bethlehem amen and so he became a great warrior he was anointed by Samuel and we know that the start of his life he was just looking after his daddy's sheep but he had an atmosphere after the Prophet anointed him with the anointing oil said the Spirit of God was with him from that day forth and and he went back to look after his daddy's sheep but now there was an atmosphere around him a man just wasn't just a natural birth he had but the Spirit of God came into his life and he began to sing and he begin to worship because God wants more than a performance God wants more than just that maybe a pretty arrangement of music but a real worship comes from the heart a real worship comes from a person who has actually met God that's a real worship amen when we worship God according to revelation I mean that is a real a real worship when you understand it's more than here but it's down here Jesus you saved me Jesus you redeem me I was lost and undone without God or his son but he reached out his hand for me amen we begin to sing these kind of kind of songs you know I'm actually left-handed sudheer how about that I mean when we sing these kind of songs I mean it's more than just a hit knowledge or more than just some nice words amen but there's a revelation our souls and we can truly worship God in spirit and in truth I mean Sir David would you know he would plan us hopin he would begin to play and God would come down and you know and then and in the and in the devil sent in yo the enemy came in just in a small way in a lion and a bear and he defeated these two animals and then he came against Goliath and we know that the Philistines when they were attacking with our camp that came into Judah and David came from the tribe of Judah so they came they came on to David's inheritance and so here he is now standing in his inheritance and the enemies come upon his inheritance and that's why he could look at them and say how dare these this army of uncircumcised philistine defied the armies of the Living God and he stood there and he had a revelation this is my land this is my ground I'm going to defeat this enemy whatever enemy comes against me it's gonna fall hallelujah and it must be the same with you I mean because it's not just David Amen who came out of Bethlehem or Jesus the great warrior hallelujah he didn't just conquer a land he conquered hell death in the grief amen he conquered everything that could be conquered hallelujah he gave us an example I mean this is how you do it boys only the church I'll show you how it's done hallelujah and so now David's standing in his land when Goliath came against them you know there's a reason he picked up five stones because he knew that Goliath had brothers so he he just realized hey if I've got to kill all five I'll kill all five I mean I've got I've got I've got a day amen why no fault then the other one will fall the third one will fall the fifth one will fall amen they'll all die because they're in my land and one will chase at the house until chased ten thousand a member the thing is the army of Israel knew it could be done but the Prophet tells us that was revealed it was revealed to David that it could be done and when it's revealed to you it can be done that's a lot different than just knowing it can be done I mean so when it's revealed to you I mean that he is the same yesterday today and forever where he's revealed to you I mean and who is the fullness of joy amen peace of passes all understanding I mean when these things and no weapon that's formed against you shall prosper when it's revealed to you not just I know that that's a nice first when it's revealed to you then you can go into action then you can really you know push the enemy back then you can really call us Bluff a man and say Satan you're nothing but a bluff I mean by the blood of Jesus Christ I cast you out of this place hallelujah we have a right to do these things when it's revealed I trust has been revealed to you amen friends we see him coming into power I'm going to jump to the right the end of my service right now he'll stand with him in this day he'll draw a sword I mean he'll draw their sword and stand with this rejected King this is our lovely Lord Jesus he'll draw their sword I'm made in God get him a fresh drink of worship I mean Oh get him a cool drink of water from the Wow hallelujah where the enemy has has been stir well all all garrisoned up and fortified up I mean where the devil swore he says God's children will not worship Him in spirit and in truth they'll not drink of the well amen of Bethlehem who will stand with me who will stand with in the sour with a sword drawn with this word in their mouth not in the habit in their mouth hallelujah two injured sword who will stand someone has to make a stand and a mastaba you I miss not someone else to do it miles over you and mouths will be me hallelujah you know we don't play church we don't play religion this is not just something we do on the side of life this should be our everything I'll walk with God should be our everything and everything in life we do we say we where we go whatever we do should be because it should be this should be in the scripture hallelujah and if it contradicts it check it out or change what you do in the very least we're not here to play the devil's not here to play neither are we the devil doesn't play games how I got you ha ha ha no he doesn't play games he wants to destroy you just like he put six millions used to death in the concentration camps I mean that same spirit that was turned against them has turned against you and they were physically put to death but the devil wants you to spiritually die amen so this cuz spirits don't die the people just die and this world has been fashioned by those same spirits we don't play games I trust you don't play you play around this is serious I'm going to heaven I mean I'm not going to a fictitious place I'm really going to that place I'm really going to be in his presence hallelujah let's draw our swords friends I mean see here come here come geez now said David was born out of Bethlehem and you can go read it in the scripture when he became King they conquered the fullness of the promised land go read it when he when he became king you read and I think second Samuel they possessed the fullness of the land now that's just a shadow that's just a natural land but then Jesus came out of Bethlehem here come here come the great warrior our God is a mighty warrior you know that he's not just a nice little person meek little lowly piece he he's a warrior I mean he's got a sword in his mouth your sword amen he's in battle hallelujah just like the battle even this morning I mean there's a battle can you receive his word and be free although he doubted and throw it aside and The Devil's whispering in your ear don't pay attention as brother John Cena can come quietly or can come shouting hallelujah and you probably can guess what kind of voice is now speaking to you amen but the thing is now we don't want to be bogged down by tradition we don't want to be bogged down by all this as a way of life and this is just accepted in our culture it's got to be going beyond that it's got to go beyond just this is how I was raised and this is what my parents told me this is what my church tells me it's going to go beyond that and it's going to become a living reality see here come the great warrior Jesus they cried out for a messiah and they got a baby they cried out for a great general to drive the Romans away they got a baby and God sent them what they needed many times we we we misunderstand the way God sends things so they sent them a baby he said them I'll become flesh and I'll lead the you know I'll lead the way and he conquered everything that could be conquered we read there in Hebrews chapter 2 that he became a captain to make it captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings verse 10 there Hebrews 2 so he became a captain now I trust he's your captain that he has brought you because you're you're a member of son as a position so a son and a daughter is the same it's not just all men in heaven you know his sons and daughters but a son in the Bible's up as a position so he'd bring many sons unto glory that's you as he brought you unto glory he's lifted you up I meant out of the miry clay hallelujah and he's now made a captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings so now our Lord Jesus as I said when he when he went up Calvary that day he defeated hell he defeated death I mean he took the sting of death because Paul would pull his hip was about to be chopped off and he just cried out dis where his ice thingy grave where is thy victory thanks be to God through our Lord Jesus Christ it gives us the victory I mean because yo the devil had a stinger and he and and any and he put that into every man woman child that had been born I mean he put the stinger into Adam he put the stinger into Eve he put the stinger and desist and all the way down through everyone but now here comes another one and he looked like everyone else and he was mad more than any man you know he was just a man like us but he was the Word made flesh and so here he was on Calvary and then now that stinger of death was was hovering around him he comes the greatest victory and it looks like a great defeat looks like a great defeat all the disciples are crying out we thought he was going to save us we thought he was going to deliver us we believed he was the Messiah and there he is hanging on a cross dying by the cruelest death that could be imagined and there's a sting of death hovering around them and then it went to inject itself in because he says it's finished he gave consent I lay my life down hallelujah and in the sting of death went into him but the stair couldn't be pulled out I mean just like a be the devil's like a be a man he's got that stinger but you know when a bee stings you and it tries to pull its stinger out and get separated out of its body and it dies hallelujah so now here's here's the devil with his great stinger hovering around and then he sinks it into the flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ to kill him amen but then the stinger stays then he tries to pull it out but he can't pull it out and he rips and the steering gets ripped out so now he's just a bunch of noise I mean he's just a distraction like a fly hovering around hallelujah that's what he is today I mean this has no hold of you head the grave couldn't hold Jesus the grave how could and how he took your sins on himself to help on your behalf pal couldn't hold him the grave couldn't hold him you think some Roman seal over some term could hold him coming forth I mean what a joke but the devil did his best amen the devil lit his best but then now you know we he conquered hell death in the grave he conquered everything that could be conquered he took it all he he captured it all hallelujah he's our captain amen no David we see was on the run from Saul and people gathered to him people gathered to him it was more than just his family because we read there let's just put it back up it says and everyone that was in distress notice these people everyone that was in distress and everyone that was in debt and everyone that was discontented gathered themselves under him and he became a captain over them and there were with him a four hundred men so it doesn't say and everyone that was happy and everyone they had lots of money and everyone that was content gave themselves it was the ones in debt in distress discontented they gave themselves to David as a set member David as a type of our Lord Jesus Christ he is a fugitive in this world a man he is a fugitive in this world it says in the later scene church age that he's on the outside of the church world knocking trying to get back head he's been cast out I mean he's been cast out but says now everyone that was in distress discontented and did they gather themselves to David hallelujah and it's the same thing with us right now there's a reason they gathered to him the Prophet tells us they knew he was coming into power they knew he would be king one day even though he's on the run they knew he'd be King one day and I trust that when you see him in this hour you know he's going to sit on the throne of David in the Millennium you know he's coming into power you know the Millennium is soon a merit Trust is something as stirs in your heart amen my captain my Lord Jesus is going to sit on the throne of David in the Millennium hallelujah now the same anointing that when upon David now came upon the men that gathered with them amen and we'll read here if you got your Bibles handy second samuel 23 the same anointing now i'm trust this is this is probably quite familiar to most of us but you know when you read the Bible and the exploits that the believers did it's not Hollywood it's not choreographed in some way and they basically just look at some unnamed enemy and he falls over and dies these are real people these are trained warriors that they fought against but the same anointing that that came upon David and he killed Goliath with a slingshot amen as the same anointing that came upon the ones that gathered to him and it should be the same thing with us now this the same word I mean this this message that's come in the same time it's more than words a mental life as Jesus Christ has been released through the mouth of a prophet I mean that same anointing I mean that was released through his words comes on to the believer amen in the same life that was in him as now on you so the same the same one that defeated the enemies back their defeats them in your life hallelujah because why because that same anointing that was just like Jesus and the disciples he gathered them I mean he became a captain he gathered you know illiterate fisherman prostitutes amen drunkards publicans sinners whatever they were they gather themselves to Jesus I mean then on the day of Pentecost the same anointing that was in him separated into the believers hallelujah and they cast out devils like he did they they took control of every situation like he did hallelujah they were not bad by the pressure of the world I mean like he wasn't bowed hallelujah it should be the same thing with you and I I mean because on the you know we'll come back to bed amen it's just like when when the Apostles are dragged before the Sanhedrin the same people that condemn Jesus to death and they and they threaten them do not preach in his name do not speak in his name anymore and they stand there saying well surely please me nor God you decide hallelujah and they were beaten and they were they were cast out and then they had a prayer meeting now the enemy was trying to put a fear in them that they wouldn't just like the Philistines garrison the well around Bethlehem to try and keep them from their source of life I mean which is the Holy Ghost in you he'll try and put a complex and you try and put some pain in you some unbelief in you that will keep you from the your well wholly because the well is meant to run free a member then they had a time of Prayer and God came down shook the place and it gave them boldness and they went out preaching I mean they got in touch with the well hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and I friends the devil will try and cut your prayer life he'll try and cut your joy can't your time with the word Amen cut that from you cuz if he can then where's the water God Amen we don't want to be like that you say well the enemies have it a go just have a pre-meeting you say but there's only me have a you and God have a pre-meeting Amen Lord Jesus is no one else around I would have a prayer meeting with you hallelujah we say well how can he pray he can take your lips and pray himself through you amen now and these are the mighty men whom David ahead these are the discontented this is the ones and it these are the distressed I mean I didn't say in that state after they gathered hallelujah and to me this is part of thee you know this gospel is the gospel of power this gospel is an overcoming gospel I mean this gospel is not just to put up with your devil and seven steps are living with your enemy you know it's not that kind of gospel this gospel Jesus commanded his disciples come wherever you find the devil cast out devils and my name you shall cast out devils you shall heal the sick Amen you will have dominion over your enemy you will tread upon the enemy hallelujah as I treat upon and crush this head I mean so you will crush his head as well hallelujah this was the commission given to the church amen cast out the enemy wherever you find him drive him drive him out God he never said in my name you shall live with your problems and my name you shall live with the devil and my name you shall live with your temper and your unforgiveness and your bitterness in your resentment he never said that he said cast it up drive it out of my name hallelujah so this is to me this is the proof of the pudding if you've really gathered if you've really gathered to him because these ones really did get it they were just living in the same camp with David they join themselves we are your flesh in your bones wherever you go all go I mean we know you're coming into power whatever the journey the details of the journey in the between time we don't know but we're going to walk with you and it's just like us we know it's going to be on the throne in the Millennium we know we're going to be gathered around that throne hallelujah and we'll be able to sing like we really want to sing but I say let's get some practicing now I mean we can shout like we really want to shout why not shout now I mean because because the devil look there's like a sound barrier you're all sound barriers you see a plane that's going towards the sound barrier it's going to break that sound barrier and then just get some speed wobbles but then once it breaks it goes so much faster and it's like us the devil tries to just just hold back don't really praise them don't really enjoy it don't really get happy was he trying to hold you back it's like a sound barrier break through that thing I mean if you ought to dance dance if you're on a shot shout if you want to cry cry hallelujah we're not a bunch of stoic people well that's my nature just break through amen I remember and my and my BC days you'd be people who allow and people who are quiet and people in the Moodle you just have a few a few yo beers or something and everyone's loud and everyone's happy and everyone's rejoicing and they forget about who they really are now that's just the perverted that's the perverted sight how much more the genuine I mean we have the we have the finest vintage we have the finest vintage of wine that's ever happened holy and it gets better every year how listen just take a drink Amen well I might get I might act a bit silly no no if it's God doing it you will not regret it I mean you'll not feel silly afterwards you'll just be happy I mean you'll wake up the next morning I'd touch the best time Holloway I want to do it all over again

Bible says when we see him there's nothing of them that we're desire him he wasn't some great handsome fellow he's just a little but so there's something about him he was God made flesh hallelujah and here he is and the devil looks at him and saying if thou be the Son of God he wasn't sure amen and then and then he said now I'm gonna get rid of this one and he's a man hanging on a cross to the human eye it looks like the greatest defeat but one man conquered hell death and the grave when all the hordes of Hell had had man warded off from heaven he's one who took the sword cut away hallelujah breach the breach the lines of the enemy I mean took their spears unto himself breach the light of the enemy hallelujah that man and God can be reconciled again I mean Satan was humiliated

we'll give them God's in Hollywood and Gardens warts and gods and religion and music and movies and all different kinds of things and recreation or recreation that's a great idea let's do that one

make this make this world this is my best this is my best you imagine who's a giftie person here who's a real gifty person you don't have to put your hands up there we go there's a few fingers being pointed in different things imagine you've spent thousands of years not just a week for half a year there are thousands of years 6,000 years you'll be making a gift and you've been and you've seen it coming to fruition and five the gift is here Satan said six thousand years to make this world for you and you've had no I can't walk anywhere so don't have a thing but it's his six six thousand years here's my best here's my best and then there's a people on the earth Isis I don't want to be near that thing I can't take that away I detest this gift I mean you'd feel pretty humiliated but I've worked so much I've given my energy and whole nations have been given to make this and whole systems and hold parts of life and then as the people say oh get it away I don't want to sing amen God uses you to humiliate the devil because this is his best this world is his best and there's a people upon the earth they say I don't want it this is the worst gift what are you what you you spent this long to make this from me and you give it and you think I like it this is what and you glad Amen that God uses you to humiliate Satan amen where he came the first time to defeat Satan and then now his wife is upon the earth she's been through seven Church ages but here she is amen and God lives on her and his wife now feels the final blow I'll put it that way he paid it all on Calvary but there's got to be a people where Satan is under their feet and every every part of life I mean you get up in the morning and you're treading on his head and you go through life he tries to raise up his head you know you know there was a video on YouTube a man that was feeding snakes and this king cobra raised up you know what he does he just slaps it on the top of the head and it just falls down he wasn't scared for life the snake is big it slaps on the top of the head it just falls down that's like you he raised up his head Oh what are you doing get out of here but you say buddies buddies but he's walking like a roaring lion devouring who world here he walks like and a roaring lion normally runs we don't need to be afraid of anything we don't need to be afraid of anything the devil's defeated Jesus defeated him and that victory that he went at Calvary is being manifested in the people I mean so we don't need to be worried because the same anointing that was on Jesus I trust is in you hallelujah we are undefeated amen we have gathered to our to our Lord Jesus and look now look what these ones did these are Gentiles he lifted up his spear were in verse 8 he lifted up a spear against eight hundred whom he slaughters is not this is not Hollywood this is not choreographed this is a real battle one man with a spear after him was was Eleazar the son of doto the ethnic one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines that were gathered together to battle and the men of Israel were gone away he arose and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary and his hand clayvin to the sword and the Lord wrought a great victory that day and the people returned after him only to spoil that's a victory and after him was Shama the son of aggie the horite the and the philistines were gathered together into a troop where piece of ground full of lentils and the people fled from the Philistines but he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it and slew the Philistines and the Lord wrought a great victory and three of the thirty chief went down and came to David in the harvest time and to the cave of Abdullah and the troop of Philistines pitched in the valley of riffian let's just leave it there because there's more these men were mighty men these men were mighty men they were not afraid they stood their ground friends you got to stand your ground in the word I mean don't don't pull back I'm in the armor of God you are read in Ephesians it has no armor in the back we're not called to flee we're called them we call to pursue we're called to attack I mean we're called the stand and our inheritance you're to stand upon this word amen if you stand upon this word God will stand for you if you don't stand on the word God will not stand for you I'd rather stand with God and be alone in him back me up hallelujah the very krater who made all things I want to stand by his side I want to stand for him according to his word amen I mean they stood their ground and they weren't great victories now that's just a shadow that's just a shadow how much the reality which is you I mean we do not fight flesh and blood we fight principalities and demon powers and high places hallelujah they just fought natural enemies we fight supernatural enemies amen in the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds amen it's not just he says to pull down the strongholds and pull it down by the Word of God it doesn't say to put a fence around it and let it sit there what's a stronghold in life

compromise I don't want to compromise amen this world Jesus died to make men holy slits die to make them free hallelujah there now here's David and David was in the hole and the garrison of the Philistines were in Bethlehem the place he came from and David longness he told that one would give me a drink of the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate and the three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines and drew water rather well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David near less he did not drink thereof but he poured it out unto the Lord and he said be afar from me Oh Lord that I should do this is this not the blood of the men that win in jeopardy of their lives therefore he would not drink it these things are these things did these three mighty men and fgi the the brother of Joab the son of Zuria was chief among three and he lifted up a spear against three hundred and slew them and had the name among three was he not more honorable of the three therefore he was their captain howbeit he obtained not to the first three they had a David had a desire and the three of them just heard his desire and said let's cut through this enemy and let's get my let's get our king of fresh drink let's get of a fresh worship let's go cut through the well that only lets cut through the Philistines to the pentecostal well I mean it's still sitting in Bethlehem although friends I'm gonna lay a challenge to you I want to give my king of fresh drink of water don't you I want to cut my way through indifference through lukewarmness a me through

won for me at Calvary I want to see it manifested in my life I'm in where every enemy even things we're born with Amen we know that family traits that we've received you wrestle with your humanity every day some of us do amen but just put it under the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah be depended upon him we don't have to put up you know brother Brown says people you know there's family traits that young people have wild tempers or and different to religion or is it they can't forgive or you know or people are very moody and different you know we get all kinds of the grab-bag of life where'd you get this from great-great great-grandfather Jones I never knew well this is where you got it from this is not fair well what can I do with this let's just come to me you don't have to be a slave to your your natural lineage and traits you don't have to be a slave to it Jesus is here to set the captive free I mean there has to be a people to break the cycle amen of a violence or whatever it is you see family things come through can be alcohol spirit or something comes through there's going to be someone that breaks the cycle amen and your mouth will stand up and say Here I am to do to do business I mean I'm going to cut through this this Philistine garrison hallelujah we can do it friends I'm sorry oh yes I do I read it to you in English then in there David's when Davis desire was to have a fresh drink he probably had some old warm stagnated water up there he was drinking but he happened to think of that fresh water down there at Bethlehem the house of God's bread and he said if I only had a drink from that well and those men pulled their sword and fought 15 miles of Philistines not because he asked him to do it but because they knowed he wanted it I love that because he knowed he wanted it and they cut them Philistines all the way to the well while two of them fought the other one got a bucket of water and fought their way back all the way back and handed it to David talked about Galland hallelujah friends let's get him a drink of water who will stand with me in the stellar I mean let's not worry about one is a majority in God who knows that one is a majority I mean you don't have to have a big group around you one is a majority hallelujah if it's you and God you outnumber everything everyone and everything you are there's more on your side amen Elijah you know was there and his servant went out brother Brown says to to put the milk bottles out by the front door and he saw and then the Assyrians were camp around the city where they were and now he was scared Oh what are we going to do we're going to perish and Elijah just prayed Lord opened the man's eyes and then he looked and he saw the army of heaven was encamped around one man and can't drown one man and that was a man under the blood of bulls and goats I mean what about the bride of Jesus Christ under the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah this far more with me then against me hallelujah we don't need to worry about how many Devils there are it doesn't matter they're all full they'll all fall to the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen think about it David that godly man said God's better died drink from these drink it from these friends that put their life in jeopardy he made a drink offering poured it out upon the ground to the Lord give it to the Lord he's the one worthy of it not me and they put the very type of Christ himself with his own eternal life within him the smitten rock poured his life upon the ground as a sin offering for us that this word could live I mean why did he die not just to forgive us of our sins but his word would live in you hallelujah and I and you should be able to say this morning I trust you can identify with these things he's talking about me I mean he's describing me in this generation Alleluia he says this come stand with me by my side who stands in a terrible place I challenge today and I'm going to echo his words I challenge today these tapes go over the world I challenge some men some warriors who love Jesus Christ that knows that these things got to be fulfilled with a brethren come stand by my side and pull the Word of God forget those dry systems and stagnated denominations you're living in pull the fresh Word of God let's give Jesus a good friend drink of fresh Pentecostal water that's his desire today all of it since desire Lord I want to do it I mean back to original Pentecost back to the word it's prophesied we're doing so Malachi the fourth chapter return the faith of the children back to the fathers again who would stand this morning like David we know that David is coming into power Jesus Christ is going to take the world here and here it's the earth he's going to be king over the earth he's rejected today he's a fugitive among his people because he's a fugitive to the world always was but today he's a fugitive to his own church they reject them they love their creeds and big I think they treat instead of the word they won't let him be manifested they won't let him be manifested they won't let him be preached in his power I want him to be manifested whatever the enemy doesn't want I want they don't want him to live I want him to live I want it to go beyond just you know I want him to manifest through me amen this is the this is the promise of Christmas I give you a gift of eternal life and it's more than just saying yes I accept it you've got to accept it but it's going to come and live in you wholly the life I now live I mean you shall live also hallelujah I wouldn't they weren't there to be preaching as power they have cut away from it like the Bible said that do so in revelation 17 no I think I'm gonna close with this what are they doing today going up here today in all going in this Council of Churches Catholicism Protestantism uniting together making the mark an image of the beast and Protestants following right for a Pentecostal is everywhere Dybbuk trees going into Rome from Pentecost and from the charismatic movement it's all gone amen and coming back saying it's the most spiritual place and it takes us everywhere else they're opening up and giving understanding of the stations and so forth knowing that that's Creed's being injected to this word oh your Bethlehem dwellers that's you hallelujah I call for men warriors who's not afraid I don't care if it's 800 standing on one side 10,000 on the other I want warriors who will come with me cut a hole through this line of unbelieving Philistines the World Council of Churches has got garrisoned around the Word of God trying to make it creeds and feed the people there's a well there's a fountain open in the house of David basically him our Savior cleanses us brother sinner's unbelief in the world what a who warrior that can see the millennium coming what warrior can see this great Holy Spirit come in the form of Jesus Christ the literal body of Christ to be take over again stand with me stand by him stand by me hallelujah it's a challenge today I'm going to close with that he's a challenge today the devil has the word garrisoned off amen he has it he just wants us he doesn't care how much we sing he doesn't care how much we preach even how we how much we pray and how fundamental we may appear to be I mean if he can get that life if he can stop you from receiving the life and stop it manifesting through you that's all he wants to do amen but who will stand with me can we have some musicians to come I want to lay the challenge it's Christmas time friends it's Christmas time God wants to give you a gift which is his own life in you who wants to receive that gift you say I'm tired of just going through the motions and and just living a same old kind of life take the sword you notice the great worries in the Bible aren't away and the best trained biggest strongest looking people David was a little bitty fellow Shamgar was was that was a hungry farmer with an ox coat but he heard the Philistines coming he was standing in his inheritance he looked out in the faces of his wife and his children and he saw their need he didn't ever saw it he had an ox coat he drew that ox code he says well I better go do something about this hallelujah how much more you friends I mean we have the Word of God amen we everything we have need oven we're here has been given to us and he took that ox goat amen and he charged off those first things and after I don't know how long it took him but at the end or they're all dead and he was still alive and
