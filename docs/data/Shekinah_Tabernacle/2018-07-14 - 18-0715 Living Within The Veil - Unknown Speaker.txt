Bertha I'm gonna hide I'm not coming thank you for your wishes like god bless you all wonderful love you all Amen it's great to be here great to see everyone here I mean let's um let's read from the scripture let's go to Hebrews chapter 9 I mean it's real good to see brother John I was like I haven't seen you like a whale off it's been a long time it's good to see you god bless you amen let's go to Hebrews 9 and verse 1 I see if this is working Hebrews 9 and 1 then really the first covenant had also ordinance of divine service and a worldly sanctuary for there was a tabernacle made the first ruin was the candlestick and the table and the shewbread which is called the sanctuary and after the second Vail the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden censer and the Ark of the Covenant over roundabout with gold when was the golden pot that had manna and Aaron's rod that budded and the tables of Covenant and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercy seat of which we cannot now speak particularly now when these things were thus ordained the priests were always into the first Tabernacle accomplishing the service of God but into the second when the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people the Holy Ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first Tabernacle was yet standing which was a figure for the time the impressive in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices they could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience which stood only in meats and drinks and divers washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation now let's go to the next chapter Hebrews 10 and from verse 19 and it says here then having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having an High Priest over the house of God let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more as you see the Day approaching amen this bow is a word of Prayer if you have a need just want to raise your hands to the Lord to be remembered in prayer gracious father how thankful we are we can gather as your redeemed children Lord washed in your blood Lord made new creatures in you how thankful we are father for Lord just your mercy upon us and Lord we thank you we can gather and I just pray as we a here Lord we do not desire to go through a religious motion just because it's a Sunday morning but we have come to have a meeting with you Lord God we've come to call you to a conference Lord that you would mould us and you would shape us and you change us and you would wash us Lord and Lord you would refill us with your spirit Lord and father as we go into talking about the tabernacle this morning Lord may become a reality Lord may it not be just a teaching Lord or just a theory but Lord may it become a reality to us I pray please may you grant it father be at those through a way Lord who a second body Lord may you heal them and raise them up but we know by your stripes they were he'll bother sick among us here as well heal us Lord and father I pray Lord that everyone Lord would be changed Lord because they've been here this morning father by your spirit Lord may you grant it Lord may nothing distract us Lord may all unbelief be cast away by the blood of Jesus Christ thought of may you have preeminence in every life please may you grant it Lord take the service under your control we pray in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless you all you may have your seats this morning so one who I want to speak about ahead in life with Christ being hidden away and I wonder if I could give it a subtitle I want to ask you the question where are you living today amen now we understand that being a believer is more than just coming to church or having a profession but it's actually a place where you live and we know that that is in the presence of God and so we read about the tabernacle there because under the blood of bulls and goats we understand that only the high priest could go into the Holy of Holies where the Ark of the Covenant was in different things and that's where the presence of God was and you know and so and the believer could come into the outer court maybe I'll just show you a diagram I'm going to refer to this quite a lot but the but the so here's the entrance here and so here's the outer court now the worshipper brings his sacrifice here the priest takes the sacrifice examines the sacrifice if their sacrifice is found to be perfect then it's presented and it's offered on their behalf and then now the priest could come into the holy place here but only the high priest once a year with blood you'd come into the most most holy place and this is where God lived he doesn't live out here he didn't live out here but yet he blessed those places but God was in here and that's where where we just read now the the veil was here where only the high priest once the earth blood could go into this place but Jesus by his veil yahoos his flesh was raped which showed that by a new and living way now man had gone to the presence of God hallelujah and that's why when Jesus died that down Calvary the vow was raised as a temple from top to bottom signifying by his blood that all 101 who would believe I mean could go and dwell in the prison's of God continually hallelujah and that's where that's where the believer must live is not out here or in here and we're gonna break these things down are you gonna live in here I mean and this is a secret place when you're shuddered with God in the world is shut out hallelujah now I'm gonna show you hey I just want to show you a this is a replica one of the replicas you can see I just googled yo now this this was the tabernacle the wilderness a replica now if you look at it it doesn't look like much it's not some big temple complex not a bunch of gold by just stone you know it doesn't look like an incredible building and even Solomon's first temple wasn't an incredible building if you compare it to other your religious temples and different things but the differences God was there that's the main thing you know what God veils his glory to the outside world God valses glory to the outside world but the world puts its glory on display but inside it's a bunch of dead man's bones right just like Jesus says you know he says to the scribes and Pharisees in Matthew 23 he says that outwardly you know you know outwardly you're you're a bunch of wider wall schipperkes beautiful buildings but inwardly you're a bunch of dead man's bones right this wishes of Matthew 23 so outwardly they looked all good but inwardly they were did and that's how the world is outwardly it looks beautiful you take the Vatican beautiful piece of art but inward it's dead man's bones there's no life is no life in that place but yet that's why John marveled in the book of Revelation he marveled at her but because it was so beautiful burrito was so wicked and evil and that's how the world was but God Vale's themself in simplicity and that's why you've got to look the believer veils God I mean we may not look so great to the outside but inwardly God does dwelling hallelujah so now so here's the article we talk about this first pass the holy place in the Holy of Holies now is the question I want to ask us so so where are you living where are you living because I want you to know there's a big difference so the believer could come to this place they they they ate manna in the wilderness they all ate heavenly bread Jesus is I am that bridge they so they ate on the word and they rejoiced but if that man had got all to them right there got oh they couldn't keep it over to the next day and got stale so that our experience got stale and rotten every day they needed a new experience right and now living outside out here the elements affected them so if it was raining or as cold or as hot you know they were tossed about by the elements amen so so you know you know outside if you're living outside you're worried about the weather and what's happening and that will affect your walk is it too cold to go worship today is it too hot I mean someone's you know I you're upset you're not upset you're up you're down your left your right what's happening because the weather's affecting you yes this is our Christian walk we come on here present your body a living sacrifice right and then you're washed for service wash from the world then you come into the air into the holy place you're eating the bread of life you're living according to our artificial life and you're offering up prayers this priesthood right but then you've got to go within the veil into the holy place with a life of God as a means to the survey so there's the altar of burnt offerings and the Bible says we must present our bodies a living sacrifice that's repent repent him you know give yourself and then be baptized the name of Jesus Christ be washed amen yes many people live in us and then you can go in you can go and you can go out you can go and you can go out we can't let the world to fix our walk amen you got to see what's affecting where are you living well I go to church I was raising the message but have you met him do you know him you got to know him to know him as life right this word has to become a living reality hallelujah it must become a living reality Jesus says you must be born again there was this first doctrine amen and then now you come to the outer court it's exposed to the elements anyone can come in here who wasn't Israelite and out there they were eating manner but it went off they couldn't keep it up for the next day right so you can have a camp experience you can have a glorious time but it doesn't last a minyan come under the anointing they all ate GE or they were saying to Jesus our fathers ate manna in the wilderness and then Jesus says but there everyone did he said he overthrew them in the wilderness because that their unbelief that and interent arrest so they all receive the blessings of God they they were all delivered out of Egypt God did the supernatural among them God gave them his word God dwelt among them but yet they didn't they were just living out here they weren't converted they weren't changed just like many people they can be they can repent be baptized for them being converted right you got to be converted hallelujah and God's editors are converting amen so we can live out here and it can be wonderful but then it can be bad don't read their journey from Egypt into the Promised Land you'll see that a lot of murmuring and complaining because they're living in the outer Court we don't want to live out there we don't want to stay there don't stay where you are go forward walk forward I mean don't stay well this is where I've always been go forward by faith yes I mean then now we come here and then we're going to go into the holy place now the holy place the holy place is inside so the it can be raining it can be snowing it can be whatever the weather can be doing this thing but now the person is protected in their stand unaffected by the world anymore right they've come in so now this person can be standing out here soaking and these ones are high and dry and this one can be saying well this is dragging me down and I'm battling with this and then someone in here saying is what do you mean I don't have their problem I've been cleansed of it I men are you following me what I'm saying right so someone can have a temple like a bus you know they can have unforgiveness indifference and you can't still have that in here as well yeah right but you know you could have things but you overcome in here a few things and then so it doesn't bother you when you're inside right amen but this though is all artificial this is still artificial he it was the lamps tear they had to put oil into the lamp a man had to physically take oil put it into the lamp had to make the thing you know they they had to keep it lit they had to keep it lit it was man's doing this is where people come sincerely they repent they get baptized and they come in here the world doesn't affect them so much anymore but then now it's all their own doing and this is where people get discouraged this is where people get discouraged because their own out of their own sincerity because everyone wants to serve God don't they everyone wants to live for him because they love him right but this is their own effort the bread had to be baked the bread had to be baked if you let the bread they're too long it'll get moldy right so so the bread had to be baked the the oil had to be put into the candles and then the altar of incense that had to be humanely done making the incense and you're that's that's that's a the altar of prayer but yet they're inside they've been sanctified from the world right to a degree but they're living in this place now the biggest problem that people have as they live in here and they don't go in here but yet they think they're living in here yeah right you don't want to be living in here and thinking you're in here when you're not there right I mean this is the biggest problem that the believers have is that people are still in the holy place yet they're priests and kings to God right you're not living outside they're not out here David buss and their walk so it's good but don't stay in here right that's where many people say no artificial light that the lamp can go out the oil can stop being added it can get smoky and then the Lance can get smoky so you can't really see you know what's going on anymore and it can affect people in a bad way it's I want to make a big contrast between these two I'm not so worried about out here because most of us have advanced from repentance and baptism right but we want to go beyond just living in this place God doesn't want you living in there he doesn't want you there he wants you in here he wants you in his presence that's why it's called uni that's why he's spoken to us why send this message and then you would live in his presence I mean because this veil has been reached the vial of tradition has been reached the vial of tradition of church in just church ology and and tradition of man that's been written Twain in the sour hallelujah this is the seven golden candlesticks that John saw you don't want to live be living in just a church age light you're gonna be living in the presence of the king helu yeah now let's read oh now that's how God promised in the days gone by that in the stay that he would write his laws not upon tables of stone but upon the heart he had placed the law in the heart Ezekiel spoke of it and the prophets all spoke of how God would do that in the days coming which was a type but the high priest what's going into the holiest of Holies then the curtain dropped soundproof he was shut off from the things of the world no one could see him he was head away through the Lutheran Age came forth for JA shall live by faith that's the outer Court along came the Methodists age the sanctification age which is what I told the holy place they call it the secret they caught the second definite work of grace which come in that age and there's the older age then in the last days the restoration of the Holy Spirit the hidden life and I'm sure that's where the trouble lays I want you to see it right here's where the trouble lays with the church today coming from the can't deviate between the altar and the holiest of Holies and there's where's the place with a church or to be if I mean there's too many of them still on the outside out here instead of being in here so he's saying these two many here and see the Bing in here right right this is where the where are you living today right this is the big question where are you living are you here are you here or are you in here right right amen so now now here comes in this real life real life is manifested in here right this is all I'm sure you can all agree the priest had to keep adding to this keep doing keep doing keep doing right and there's always an element of that in our Christian walk but they depended solely on their ability to keep the lamp going keep the bread there he is the bread of life right and then keep the prayer going they had to keep doing doing doing a people get discouraged why because they haven't got the life that pushes out they haven't got the life that manifests itself out of them hallelujah that's how we meant to be God has been to come in and live out of us we just yield to him and he produces his own life amen so now but the veil here was rent that day on Calvary I mean where we just read we read that this was here signifying under the blood of bulls and goats that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made benefits but then by the blood of Jesus Christ this veil has been rent right so now beforehand the high priest could only go and once a year into here and if you just went in it would have been death if he went in without blood without being dressed right without being anointed right and then he would have died in the presence of God holy or so so he comes the high priest now once a year so so sacrifice is offered for him and the people he's washed he's dressed right hallelujah then he comes in here does service in here and then by the blood he can come in and and sprinkle the blood I mean on the mercy seat and now there's mercy for the people amen and now it's the same thing with us we come in we we repeat we're baptized then we dressed I mean dressed Rob did his righteousness right because maybe around the hem of the high priests garment is a pomegranate Bell pomegranate pal driving around and when he walked that cried out holy holy holy to the Lord so his whole walk was holy holy holy to the Lord and it should be the same thing with you and I and then when we get up in the morning out laughs am i crying holy holy holy to the Lord everything we do should be holy holy holy to the Lord hallelujah I mean - then and then he was anointed with the rice of Sharon I mean Jesus was crushed here as the Rose of Sharon order to get the perfume out the rice had to be crushed he was crushed shut down Calvary that the fragrance could come out amen he is anointed and he had the blood because he's going to go worship hallelujah amen so now here we come here we come through the same way God justifies us then we sanctified amen and and the blood gives access all the way through but don't just stay in the sanctified state your own doing your own doing your own doing make it history make it has doing yes Amen so now the veil has been rent now in here as the is the Ark of the Covenant it's the mercy seat there's also Aaron's rod and there's the and there's the two tables of stone and then there's the golden pot of manna that never went old that never went old it was the same matter that fell out here the same word that fell out here was the same word that was in here the difference is here it got stale and old and it couldn't be kept up but here it never got old and a believer that is coming to the Holy of Holies the word is still fresh it doesn't get stale I've read that before I've heard that before I've heard this all my entire life that's a style experience I mean but if you're living in the prints of King it doesn't get old and doesn't get stale it just gets better over time hallelujah so where are you living people get bored they come in with excitement I mean they may be at a temple God moves in church they have a glorious time but then but then it gets stale and they wonder what's going on it's cuz they're living out here don't let the would be stale to you don't let it get moldy I mean you gotta you gotta don't just eat it in there you got to come in here it doesn't get this word gets prettier every day is not stale I'm it's just richer and better and this message the Bible should get richer every day Amen better it all depends where you're living because gods in here gods in this place he I understand he blazes this place but he's in this place right they want to be in this place living in the presence of the king Alleluia now also so that's the big difference if you're if if the word is wonderful Amen it's not stale to you you're in here I'm just wise where you living this is not crossing the T's and dotting the eyes it's a life that lives in you right so the word should be wonderful it should mean more to you every day should be fresh oh how I love Jesus amen now also another thing that was in there was Aaron's rod now Aaron he carried his rod now that rod was fashioned Aaron when he was carrying it was fashioned by man's hands right it was fashioned a rod is shaped cut to the right size it's shaped for the for the master to use so it was a it was once living it was taken off a tree or maybe on the ground I don't know and then it was fashioned and it's the same thing with you and I this world was the fashioner rightful religion wants to fashion a shape us it was man's tools man's knowledge shake the rod and they say now it's in service now I can use it cuz it's been shaped no that wasn't what God wanted God wanted there's a life in that and that piece of did wood and I'm and you know I've been run and had to produce almonds and produce fruit right and so now I want you to notice it's like the same thing with you and I we went we're off the tree of life of the tree of humanity I'll put it that way but outside the prints of God were just a dead stick right potentially there's fruit on us they can be produced but it has to be in the right atmosphere has to be in the right presence to bring forth I mean that's why it's so important when we gather and God comes down there's an atmosphere I mean this produced Holly you say well I don't have any part of the service you sing you pray you you you thank him for everything that he's done for you it produces an atmosphere around you what happens God draws near hallelujah net and that begins to affect the one next year the one in front of you hallelujah what begins to happen now life can come the atmosphere is vital it's very important so now I want you to notice he comes I think I think Moses put it in there and here it's still a dead stick it's in the outer court mallalieu yeah Lisa's not out there it's in here good wonderful it's still a dead stick right in here in the holy place oh it's God it's advised asila date stick another dead stick amen but then when it comes in here goes beyond the rail it's not a dead stick anymore it's buddy life is coming for hallelujah that all the shaping of man does not stop producing I mean it's the same thing with us the world can try and shake you man's religion can try and shape you but when you get in the presence of God I mean that life will come for hallelujah that's if you've got life to produce Amen begin to produce fruit now it's the same thing with the believer we can come in here we can fastest you and jump up and down we can come up here we can fastest you and jump up and down amen but in here you can't do that and here this is all human life being produced out here that's right this is religious human life but then when you go beyond the veil it's not religious human life anymore it's the life of God being produced hallelujah and that's how you know someone's living in the presence of the king Amen is that one the word doesn't get old the world is shut off I mean they're not affected by the rain and the good times prices name and the bad times do the same hallelujah doesn't matter if the world's falling apart hallelujah doesn't matter it's going well hallelujah as a matter full of forsaken me hallelujah as a matter of your sick up to you up to here glory hallelujah I mean you can be on a bed second you can be saying glory to God I'm so glad he lifted me hallelujah I'm so glad Jesus hit me free you know the joy we have is a reality amen and here and his presence is the fullness of joy peace that passes all understanding amen this is this is where it is so now in here and here we begin to produce a life and the world is shut out the world is shut out what all the other believers are doing a shut out this is you and God in here this is you and God you can have another priest in here with you and they can bump over the shewbread they can knock the candle they can do all kinds of things and it can bother you I was trying to worship God and you're bumping the candle you're tripping over you MSU you know doesn't that affect women that affect you you try and do a job and the other person's clumsy knocking things around come on men straighten up but in here it doesn't bother you and here it's younger this is all shut out there's a disavow those drop them behind you when you go through I'll let you you're worshiping the very Lord God of heaven and earth Allu yeah and the wonderful thing is when you come in here is it's not a judgement seat then it's a mercy seat causes blood on it right you see mercy when you come into his presence when you're really coming to the coming to the Holy of Holies now I mean it's not a judgement seat its mercy because the blood has bloods been sprinkled hallelujah see not under the condemnation anymore but you're free Amen because you see this blood being sprinkled hallelujah Amen now let's see if we could find this one yeah here oh now every man this thing of the inner the holy place every man that stays in the prints of God later on it speaks of it into this great secret place head away will yield the fruit of righteousness Peace Love joy long-suffering goodness gentleness patience don't fuss about these other things get that in your life and you'll never get it out until you hide away with God into the land of adoption another thing we will call your attention just before clothes look at the light on the outside courts there was the firmament that lit it up sunlight so forth some days were cloudy some days had sand and shine at all some days it was dark now that's the outer court the next court was the lamp of God with a justified stand and it was lit by human hands that's where we argue our denominations where we argue our differences split hairs and oh I don't believe in divine healing I don't believe the envisions come from God I don't believe this I don't believe that you're arguing because you're living yet you're eating manner but you're living under an artificial light that's right sometimes the light goes out that's in here that's in here and here it's very different now as I see it before this place when a person comes into this place the world is shut out and they are shut in with him the world doesn't matter anymore there is nothing the light in here is supernatural Amen it's not a natural light it's not a man-made light this this is a man-made life right this is a religious man made life though it's good but yet and here is a supernatural life a supernatural light hallelujah when your attention isn't what the other priests are doing and whatever more your attention is him amen imagine walking from here to there would be very different very different kind of atmosphere I mean a very different kind of presence because God is there that's where God is and it's the same thing now when the believer really enters into the most holy place is an atmosphere as around them right there's some people you love to be around believers who just love to be around and what is that because there's an atmosphere around them you know that they love you hallelujah there's the atmosphere of love around them that's because they've been in the presence of God they dwell in this place and there's a life that's being produced I mean just like Ayman Aaron's rod that budded that produced a life that was meant to be produced now we can't humanly produce a Christian life how it should be it takes God to produce that life now and and this is where we should be living hallelujah this is where we're cool to live and the presence of our King now I want to turn I want to turn to the Book of Ezekiel and and chapter 36 [Music] does anyone understand the difference I know we're teaching a little bit today but yeah you look at it now where are you living are you living from one camp to the next camp one special meaning to the next special meeting where are you living from we'll get the blessings right but then it's very different going from camp experience to camp experience we need those times right but when you come in here it's not you it's not you trying to produce the life trying to be good in your ability it's his doing all right my laws their hearts and I'll do them it means it's very different being just mentally up here well I'm gonna do this and don't do this and brother Graham said this and I should do this and the Bible says this and you know if it's in here if you've been reprogrammed you're gonna live according to your programming right so if you're programmed according to the world then that's how you live but if you've been reprogrammed is God's programming in you you can't do you can only do what your programming is right just like a computer it could only the programs on it's all you can use a computer for unless you put other programming in it amen it's the same thing with us now Ezekiel I don't have this up here but it says Ezekiel 36 and verse 25 verses verse 24 rather because because people have said to me well but the Holy Ghost has been given so everyone receives it you have to receive it yourself right just because it was given the down Pentecost doesn't mean you automatically receive it without any sensation or any life afterwards the high priest would know that he is in the presence of God in the Holy Place right they knew when they're in the prints of Jesus there's a difference about Jesus Christ because that was the Messiah that was God in flesh amen we're now the other day of Pentecost and God came down it was very different to the first nine days when they're in the upper room it was a very different kind of experience it wasn't now well I believe by faith that the promises come we've been in do with power from on high now let's go preach that's it no no no we got to wait wait until we're in Jude with power from on high and they and they really received that power it was a reality not by well just by faith that nothing happens that's why the Apostle Paul said to a polis x19 have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed you know and he was honest well we haven't heard if there been any Holy Ghost there's a reality has it happened to you that's why you've got to go all the way in they said well I believe yeah don't just stay there because every one it one has to come to a knowledge that God is but you got to go from just there you go all the way in and be transformed by his Spirit verse verse 24 and I'll take from you I'll take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and bring you into your own land we've been gathered to the Word of God that's our land we've been taken out a man from among the heathen right from among the ones that don't know God we've been gathered and you may have we say been born in church where you got to have a you still got to have a birth your parents were taken out but you've got to know the same God your parents know then will they sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from your idols will I cleanse you so they come a cleansing and we're washed by the water of the word right we have been washed from from Trinitarian idols from false baptisms amen will be washed those are idols crafted from the Word of God will be washed from them hallelujah and from all your filthiness and from your idols will I cleanse you but that's not thee that's not the end right you got to keep walking with God and you had also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I'll take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I'll give you a heart of flesh you know before we meet God we can't really live with ourselves having God come live with you dwell in you if you can't even live with your own self God couldn't live with you and your condition your firstborn and he had to change you he had to change you in order for him to come and dwell right if you couldn't get along with yourself how can the heavenly dove come and dwell on you right a band and this Hester he's got to give you a new nature right amen give you a new a new spirit a new heart but don't stay there notice and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them I mean so I will put my spirit so after that's happened let's go back so this so called out washed sanctified Amen a new spirit a new hearts been given but then now my spirit I'll give you I'll put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them why is that the case because he gives you his spirit amen so it goes beyond just your own doing it's now his doing and has to go you have to every believer goes through a legalistic stage with their own doing their own doing their own doing but don't stay there then you got to go and do it's now it's his doing listen I don't try and be a Christian his life is the Christian and me I just yield myself and it's because I want to do it it's not a reluctance it's not a burden to serve God it's not a burden to be a Christian it's a joy to be a Christian it's a wonderful thing to be a believer amen its glorious have peace that passes all understanding joy unspeakable full of glory it's a wonder as a little animal thing bird is now a lighter brighter is my way what a glorious thing it was to take his yoke upon me oh I'm so glad to be yoked with you Lord isn't it glorious Amen it's not a burden why because he puts his Spirit within us and that causes us to walk in his statutes and keep them amen this is what we're cool to do now there's a life God's life if we have his life we have his character we have his nature we have his desires right we don't have our own desires their own nature own character those things that burnt out and he comes and dwells in us Amen so let's go to first Corinthians 13 how lujah a man who's been shattered with God in the secret place Amen to have constant fellowship with him now this is more than a nice wedding scripture first Corinthians 13 this is not when he speaks about charity we say well it's love it's more than human love amen Jesus loved the unlovable that was divine love I mean were you yet sinners when you were his enemy he loved you and died for you the scripture tells us he didn't love us because we loved him at first right he didn't oh they love me therefore I'll give myself a mere ransom for them no I'm gonna go redeem my enemy I'm gonna redeem those that actually hate me our carnal nature didn't like God this human nature were born with he doesn't like God it says in the scripture not 1:6 after him I mean doesn't matter what family are born and there's not one that seeks after him it takes God to move upon your heart that you would seek after him right so we were his enemy and yet he loved us that is divine love you don't love someone because they are good to you that's just human love right that's works if you show that you know that's law if you scratch my back I'll scratch yours that's law that's human love but even if you don't scratch my back I'll scratch yours anyway that's divine love hallelujah brother Bram uses that expression that's divine love divine love is it doesn't matter how you treat me I will still love you right so people say well I don't feel love anymore it's because they only have human love themselves and they are not in the Holy of Holies right hey it may sting but it does your good little brother parameter hey sometimes gotta sting I'm in battle do you good now I now I first cut the instead in one though I speak with the tang of men men and of angels and have not charity as divine love I become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal and though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all faith that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing and now I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity suffereth long now if he's in you you have these attributes because it's his life and you right it's no longer I that liveth but Christ liveth in me amen you got to say that when you get up in the morning it's no longer I that liveth its Christ that liveth in me right charity suffereth long who's got long suffering and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up you know someone that has ever seen wheat Grove when it becomes when it's not mature stands up like this look at me look at me look at me but when it becomes full of fruit wheat at valves when it's ready to be higher boughs it's bowing to the son that gave it life it's going to be the same thing with us if we're really a mature believer we won't be look at me look at me we'll be bowed our life will be a worship I mean to our God how lujah a man is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoice us not an iniquity but rejoices and the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never faileth I'm so glad his love never fails but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether it be tongues they shall see through that there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but we're net which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then I shall know even as I am known and now abideth Hope Faith Hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity that should be in us right if divine love if he is divine love if he is in us then this character this characteristics will be in us we won't be able to help it right it's just like if someone you know without the new birth has a temper that can't help that temper flying loose they can't help it because it's in them there's a life in them but after they really meet God and God takes that from them I mean the tempers gone their venue nature well they can't have that temper again it's been taken from them we have real overcoming power right hallelujah isn't that wonderful he can take those things that you're born with amen and he can take them from you I mean that you can be dead and buried in Christ that your old nature doesn't come back to life again Allu you we're living in the present I pray you're living in the presence of the king amen now now there's two classes of people today I'll just close with this them same classes of trying to do something to save themselves each one say I'll go to church every Sunday that's very good I want to be religious that's very good they're still under the law but when the other by going to church and being good is not something that you do yourself at something and you doing it for you the Holy Spirit in your heart now notice in the center court these people that live inside here they seem to have always fed up always feeding good Ezekiel said I will write my laws and you and put them in their heart where the law used to be on stones in the Ark and the ark represents their heart represent then I will put my law in their hearts and the and the ark the people sorry the Ark is the abode of God and in the Old Testament God dwelt in its glory over the ark heart as the ark God dwells not in the head in the heart because not known by theology God's not known by mental conception God's known by an old-fashion sanctified born-again experience that's in the human heart yet men and woman live a good life and love God by mental conception but the real hiding places in the heart hid with Christ and when Christ the Holy Spirit comes into your heart he is and he is in you with your temperament and he's living his own life through his own well through you hallelujah I know it sounds awful but it's right Christ so yielded you are Christ speaks Christ speaks the kind of words he'd speak he thinks the kind of thoughts he had think through you he does the kind of works he would do through you you are yielded and resting what a beautiful picture of a consecrated Christian Amen yielded Christ working through he pulls it for me too for me to live is Christ and to die is gain I mean not me that liveth anymore but Christ that liveth in me Christ living in the individual soul surrendered Christ speaks through the lips and thinks through the mind sees through the eyes X through the temperament hallelujah that's the things of the world has passed away how can it be anything but sweet and pleasing all the time Christ has got control amen you see it that's what it is it's Christ in you Christ in you you say well you see I believe it to be the truth brother bear that's right that's here it has to come here amen that's the big thing where are you living today I'll just close with that where are you living today amen by their fruits you shall know them God wants us in here he wants us to dwell in here he doesn't want us in the outer court he doesn't want us in the holy place he wants us to dwell and the holiest of all the most holy place right that's the Christian experience I mean if we shut in with God the world doesn't matter amen jesus said what is it do they follow thou me to the disciples what is it to thee if the world's fallen you know whatever is going on out what is it to thee I mean what is it do they followed me you know the Apostle Paul if he was here and he gave a mission report just like brother Andy did about Vietnam it's that while I went to this city I preached I got beaten I got thrown out the gates and then I went to the next city and then I was rejected false brethren were there I had to run for my life whatever you you read his missionary journeys it wasn't all success as we would view but he said I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision years later after he met the Lord on the road to Damascus he came into the holy place he came into the presence of God and that God that he met came and lived in him and lived his life through him and he was a love prisoner to God and it doesn't matter what happened he said none of these things move me he's me who's been shipwrecked who's been beaten I mean who's been put in prison anyone here shipwrecked beaten put in prison who's had to run for their lives for the cause of the gospel who's had the problem of false brethren creeping in a you know unawares when he said he fought the Beast at Ephesus it wasn't animals in the arena he was fighting he sweetie he was fighting untamed people who are unconverted yet in the church right he said none of these things move me why because he was Shannon with God in the secret place amen he looked beyond the circumstances he wasn't living out in the outer quarter and they even and the inner court he was in the holiest of all he said none of these things move me he comes to the end of his ministry all have forsaken me yet he said I have a crown of life waiting for me what an incredible life what an example he says now these things movie and when we read about charity there it just wasn't an idea to him it was living in his life it was a reality now how about us if there's a man that could stand and that kind of against those odds but be faithful amen how about us now we said now these things move me right but the thing is the great secret is where living he was living in the Shekinah presence of God all the time the world was shut out he was eating from the manor I mean let's go to this got a revelation in chapter 2 real quick this isn't my notes revelations 2 and 17 now every we know that every promise to every age is added to the next age right he says he that oh heave it has an ear let him hear what the spirit saith of the churches revelations 2:17 to him that overcometh will I give to eat and the eat the hidden manna and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written that no man knoweth saying he that receiveth receiveth it now this hidden manner is the manner that's in the holiest place you've got to overcome to eat there to - to eat that manner right so you've got to overcome in the outer court let's just put that back up you've got to overcome here right you've got to overcome in here in the church you gotta overcome right and then you and then once you've overcome then you're grounded to come in here I mean where you can take up your cross deny yourself and follow him that's the secret if you can deny yourself deny what you think you are I mean when we come to a place where we just realize hey I'm just a Richard sinner and I need salvation you're in a good position I mean we don't come to God it's just like you know you know we don't come to God saying well I'm so great he has to save me because of who I am no it's out of his it's the goodness of God that leads to repentance it's His goodness it's not our goodness it's His goodness I mean but the problem is many times we look at him at the wrong way brother brand tells a story of a man who's who makes a sculpture of Jesus and then someone an art critic looks along comes and look at your your looks at it they see it there's nothing really that amazing about the sculpture and the artist says you're looking at it wrong he says you got to get down here and you gotta look up at it Laurie looking down it didn't look like much but then when he got down the right and the right state and looked up into the face of the Lord and that statue he saw the most beautiful statue ever made Wow it's all about your approach amen if you come in looking down saying well I'm obligated this is me I'm the bride I deserve it right you'll be out here that's right amen but if you come and say nothing in my hands I bring simply to that cross like glue I am nothing I don't desert we don't deserve it do you think we deserve eternal life Oh No hey bud mutters goodness that he gives it to us hallelujah that's his mercy I mean it's his grace amen when we were his enemy he died for us Amen he died for the ungodly that was us right and so if we come that way we'll be in here but the problem is now we can come in here hallelujah to the lamb and then we say now then we get all what he call it no we become all legalistic in our approach our heads get puffed up right I hear to get puffed up and we get stuck in the holy place amen and then we think well with a with a brightest and best know the Apostle Paul stayed a prisoner he stayed humble he stayed yielded you see the prophets life he didn't get less humble as his ministry went on he became more humble and more yielded right and that's how he must be that's why I say it's all the Lord salvation is of God right salvation is of the Lord so we have to come the right way Zacchaeus was the shortest man in Jericho it's like the shortest man right and in order to see Jesus he couldn't see him through the crowds he had to climb up a sycamore tree so he climbed up in the lowest city one of the shortest people look at the tree of life Jesus of the Tree of Life right but that was the wrong view he had to come out of the tree and look up look at Jesus Jesus would have been told with him and when he looked at him from the right perspective then he said if I've wronged anyone I'll repay them I'm gonna give half my goods to the poor and then Jesus says salvation has come to your house this day because of his approach right and if we can just get our pride out of the way amen get ourselves out of the way and what we think we are out of the way amen we'll do way way better I mean let's have the musicians please and you glad you think about that he bet just to come how lujah this is not a religion to live in the prints of the King feast on that manner that never gets old amen to see blood on the mercy seat holy there's an atonement for you and I why don't you come within the veil today why don't you come into the holiest place of all amen they stand to our feet shall we I mean this thing that song take me into the Holy of Holies I mean if you ever would like priests say I'm in the outer court the world affects me too much come into the inner court you say well I'm in the inner court don't stay in there say Lord by your blood take me into your presence may I bring forth your life not my own life not saying man is fashioned but may may your life in me produce a life
