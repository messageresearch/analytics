[13:16] morning I was um driving here this
[13:19] morning and I
[13:21] saw
[13:24] this and um I'm I'm bringing a word to
[13:28] you this morning
[13:29] that the Lord is a promis keeping
[13:33] God rainbow always represents promise
[13:36] amen so he's a promis keeping God to you
[13:38] you know you you've all the Lord may
[13:40] have spoken things to you at this camp
[13:42] or you're going through something and if
[13:44] it's a promise of God and his word for
[13:46] you or he's spoken it to you then he'll
[13:48] keep it he's a promise keeping God this
[13:51] morning
[13:52] and the other thing about um rainbows if
[13:55] you'll notice is that who's ever seen a
[13:58] rainbow on a perfectly Blue Clear
[14:01] day they only really come when there's a
[14:03] storm when there's rain coming in you
[14:06] know and it's
[14:07] often in those times where we're in some
[14:09] sort of a storm or something you if you
[14:11] look back in your life you realize the
[14:13] promises of God came there and he and he
[14:14] brought you through he gave you a
[14:16] promise and he brought you through so
[14:18] the one you're going through now is no
[14:20] different what if you're going through
[14:22] something now but God's promise is going
[14:23] to hold he's going to he's going to
[14:25] bring you through anything so so that's
[14:27] the word from the Lord this morning to

[46:25] want to say thank you Lord this morning
[46:27] amen God has been so good and it's been
[46:30] just a real blessing for us to be with
[46:32] you all and uh it's going to be hard to
[46:35] leave we just feel ourselves so
[46:38] connected with you we're part of the
[46:39] same family amen and so we just want to
[46:42] thank everybody for the role that they
[46:44] played during this camp and and just
[46:47] want to show by way of appreciation just
[46:49] in words if we can do it in a simple way
[46:51] like that just want to say thank you and
[46:54] uh I know there's many different uh
[46:56] hearts and roles that are played
[46:58] positions that needed to be filled and
[47:00] and each and every one of you all the
[47:01] musicians brother Isaac you and your
[47:03] group and just all the song songs that
[47:06] were sung and uh the ministering of the
[47:08] word brother Andrew I I am enriched I'm
[47:11] encouraged in the Lord amen and uh so I
[47:15] I'm also going to go home with new
[47:17] Strength new Vigor amen and uh we just
[47:19] want to thank the Lord for those things
[47:21] amen because without him these things
[47:23] would not be possible and also just
[47:25] especially want to thank brother Ben
[47:26] Sister Christine for their love amen
[47:30] just want an example of the love of
[47:31] Christ you have been to
[47:33] Us Praise the
[47:37] Lord and uh we can we see that the Lord
[47:40] has been so mindful he's been so kind to
[47:43] us so generous to us this this camp and
[47:46] uh just been a real blessing and um you
[47:49] know it's amazing just how the Lord does
[47:51] things yesterday as our brother was
[47:54] speaking I I was planning on speaking on
[47:56] the glor glory of the cloud this morning
[47:59] and here our brother brings out the the
[48:01] the cloud and uh and and was preaching
[48:04] on the cloud and and he even used the
[48:06] very quote I was going to use today
[48:07] which is it is for you amen and uh and
[48:11] uh obviously surprisingly he used the
[48:13] same picture I was going to use isn't
[48:16] that amazing wow but it's it's just the
[48:19] Lord and then our brother comes up here
[48:20] today brother Isaac he comes and he says
[48:22] that he saw the bow in the cloud amen
[48:25] and that's where I was going to end so I
[48:27] as far as I'm concerned it's over we're
[48:29] we're
[48:32] finished but uh I just feel I feel that
[48:34] the Lord um maybe just wants to close it
[48:37] off in in maybe a different way that I
[48:39] was
[48:39] planning and um I want to encourage you
[48:42] when when we when we think about the
[48:44] cloud as well and those things that you
[48:46] know there's there's uh we're going to
[48:47] read a portion of scripture today in
[48:49] Hebrews 12 you can turn there so long
[48:51] Hebrews 12 and verse1 we we see this
[48:54] kind of last ad admonition to the church
[48:57] this um you know at the endend of the
[48:59] day this is what you must do and and he
[49:02] makes a reference even to the cloud you
[49:04] know when when he makes a reference to
[49:06] those that are waiting for us he says
[49:08] there are a great cloud of witnesses a
[49:11] cloud of witnesses and it's amazing how
[49:13] he would describe those that are waiting
[49:15] for us with those with that terminology
[49:17] a cloud and here we see when the Lord
[49:19] comes he comes in clouds of Glory uh
[49:22] when when he came in our when he came in
[49:24] our day he also showed himself in a
[49:27] cloud amen and so it's not surprising
[49:30] that the robe that is on the believer
[49:32] the robe that is on those that are
[49:34] waiting for us it is a cloud amen so
[49:36] that cloud is for us it's our robe amen
[49:39] and it's the same robe that he is
[49:40] wearing so we just see how perfectly the
[49:43] Lord is putting all these things
[49:44] together for us and I want to just maybe
[49:47] go uh The Next Step today and just by
[49:50] way of of of finishing off the
[49:52] services just kind of as a way of
[49:55] reminder let's keep the let's keep the
[49:57] faith let's lay aside every weight amen
[50:00] God has spoken so clearly this Camp uh
[50:03] we've had the rains literally and
[50:05] spiritually amen we had just so many
[50:08] confirmations during this Camp God has
[50:10] been so clear about who you are in
[50:12] Christ and uh I just you know I just
[50:15] want to go sit somewhere in a in a in a
[50:17] room by myself and just absorb it amen

[50:22] encourage you that when you go your
[50:24] separate ways this afternoon go find a
[50:26] place where you can just absorb
[50:27] everything that's gone on this Camp
[50:29] don't get too busy with life right away
[50:32] just take it take a moment and absorb
[50:34] the things that the Lord has done absorb
[50:36] the the things that were done in the
[50:37] prayer line remind yourself of What the
[50:40] Lord Has Done For You amen build a
[50:42] memorial you know stack some Stone

[51:47] Lord as we just come one more time lord
[51:49] we want to just as as we would look at
[51:51] the last page in the book we want to
[51:53] just bring a conclusion to these things
[51:56] today by your grace Lord and that you
[51:58] would just by way of reminder Remind us
[52:00] that you are with us Lord we do not have
[52:02] to fear we have you on our side Lord and

[52:08] because you are with us you're even in
[52:11] US Lord wherever we go and we take
[52:13] courage in that we take a peace in that
[52:15] today and so we just thank you for that
[52:17] Lord as we read your word will you bless
[52:19] it and just let it be anchored in our
[52:21] hearts in Jesus Christ's name amen
[52:24] Hebrews 12:1 it reads like this
[52:26] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[52:29] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[52:32] let us lay aside every weight and the
[52:35] sin which does so easily beset us and
[52:37] let us run with patience the race that
[52:39] is set before us looking unto Jesus the
[52:42] author and finisher of our faith who for
[52:45] the joy that was set before him endured
[52:47] the cross despising the shame and is sat
[52:51] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[52:52] God verse three for consider him that
[52:55] endured such contradiction of Sinners
[52:58] against himself lest ye be wearied and
[53:00] faint in your minds you may have receiv
[53:04] just for a
[53:06] moment so here in Hebrews we we've just
[53:08] come out of the the the faith chapter
[53:11] you know the he the heroes of the faith
[53:14] and and how that they accomplished the
[53:16] great feats the things that they were
[53:17] called to do in in their in their
[53:19] personal walks with the Lord you know we
[53:21] heard about Enoch we we read about the
[53:23] different ones Abraham Sarah and and
[53:25] these were the heroes of the faith and
[53:26] goes into great uh uh uh uh uh detail
[53:29] about the things that they suffered and
[53:31] they faced and yet by faith they
[53:32] overcame and they have a testimony amen
[53:35] and we glean from those testimonies
[53:37] today but we want to really look at at
[53:39] yourself today you have a testimony God
[53:41] is doing something in your life amen
[53:43] he's doing something right now and and
[53:45] but the admonishment is is this this is
[53:49] the admonishment this is what he's
[53:50] telling us to do that there there's
[53:52] nothing wrong with a message there's
[53:54] nothing wrong with the Bible there's
[53:55] nothing wrong with the Holy Ghost but
[53:57] there is something that we have to do
[53:59] amen we have a part to play wherefor
[54:01] seeing that we have this witness that we
[54:04] have that we are surrounded by so great
[54:07] a cloud of witnesses amen there's so
[54:09] many uh uh beautiful things come to my
[54:12] mind this great cloud of witnesses a
[54:14] voice that has come to our day to tell
[54:16] us who we are what we are and that
[54:18] there's so many of those voices in that
[54:21] in that same Cloud amen uh Dressed the
[54:24] same way let us then lay aside every
[54:26] weight how many here has ever run a race
[54:30] we used to run relays in South Africa
[54:32] and and I was on the the fourth leg you
[54:35] know and you know when we prepared for
[54:37] that race we did not get a little
[54:38] backpack and start stuffing it full of
[54:40] things and and then you know put on a a
[54:43] belt with you know water bottles and
[54:45] this and that no this is the last leg
[54:47] this is this is going to be it this is
[54:49] you know keeping your eyes on the prize
[54:51] everything you forget about packing you
[54:53] forget about the troubles you forget
[54:54] about school workor tomorrow you know
[54:57] you forget about all those things you're
[54:58] laying aside amen you are shedding
[55:00] weight is what you're doing you are
[55:02] preparing for that last lap you are you
[55:04] are there because you know you're going
[55:06] to need every last bit of energy you're
[55:08] going to be as you need to be as light
[55:09] as possible you're going to want to draw
[55:12] from all your strength and to do that
[55:13] you don't want anything to hinder you
[55:16] amen so you're dressed appropriately
[55:18] your your mind is in the right place
[55:20] you're focused on that end goal amen and
[55:23] you're just waiting for that baton to
[55:24] touch your hands and you're going going
[55:26] to be at full speed amen but if you had
[55:28] to be weighed down with something it
[55:30] would bring you off balance it would
[55:32] cause you not to be at Optimum
[55:33] performance amen and yet even though God
[55:36] will bring us through things my brother
[55:37] and sister it is important that we lay
[55:39] aside the weights that so easily beset
[55:43] us so easily you know it's amazing just
[55:47] a little thought this this mind is so
[55:49] fragile this this just a little thought
[55:52] can throw you
[55:54] off his word hasn't changed amen by his
[55:58] stripes we were healed that has never
[56:00] changed and yet a little diagnosis or a
[56:03] little thought or a little feeling you
[56:05] know will cause us to to add weight to
[56:08] to our lives and before you know it
[56:10] you're walking around like this and and
[56:12] you're dwary and you're sorrowful but
[56:14] the word has not changed concerning you
[56:17] that word is fixed amen so our job is to
[56:20] shed the weight to resist the devil to
[56:23] cast down reasonings that's our job and
[56:25] that my brother sister we need strength
[56:27] we need faith for that but my my
[56:30] admonition to you today is you have it
[56:33] you have that Faith you everything you
[56:35] have need of for this journey is built
[56:36] in Greater is he that is in you but
[56:39] somehow we allow these weights to come
[56:42] and so the the next verse there says
[56:44] that we can look unto Jesus looking unto
[56:47] Jesus it's continual thing looking
[56:49] therefore unto Jesus who is the writer
[56:52] of your life who is the author in other
[56:54] words he's your composer he's your
[56:55] creator Creator he made you amen he's in
[56:59] control he's governing your life and so
[57:01] he's the author and the finisher he will
[57:03] bring you to completion he will refine
[57:06] you amen he is the finisher he's you
[57:08] know when you build a house you have the
[57:10] rough roughing uh Crews that come in and
[57:13] they build the framing and and you know
[57:15] that's kind of rough you know they just
[57:16] kind of slap it together and and then
[57:18] they have the guys that do the the
[57:19] roughing work they do the electrical the
[57:21] plumbing and all these things but there
[57:23] comes a season when the finishing
[57:25] Carpenter comes in
[57:26] amen it's to refine it it's to
[57:28] straighten everything out amen he's got
[57:30] a lot of work to do because where they
[57:32] were a little bit lazy and slack he's
[57:34] going to make it look good amen he's the
[57:36] finisher he's the finisher of our faith
[57:40] amen he comes in and he refines
[57:41] everything he makes it it makes
[57:43] everything line up according to the
[57:46] blueprint so that's the Lord we can look
[57:48] unto him who's the author and the
[57:50] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[57:54] that was set before him he endureed the
[57:55] cross amen so he saw the purpose he saw
[57:58] the plan and so for the joy of that he
[58:01] endured the cross so what is he saying
[58:05] don't grow
[58:06] weary don't get lazy don't get tired
[58:09] amen the we we had this uh we had our
[58:12] camp start off this year with with
[58:14] pressing in amen pressing forward amen
[58:17] and so he's saying don't don't be weary
[58:20] don't grow weary amen verse three for
[58:22] considering him that endured such
[58:24] contradiction of Sinners against himself
[58:27] lest you be wearied and faint in your
[58:30] mind so he's warning us there is a
[58:33] there's a season coming there's this
[58:35] time and I believe we're living right in
[58:37] it amen where the there there'll be such
[58:40] pressure on the people that they will
[58:42] weary the Bible even talks about men's
[58:44] Hearts failing for fear you know it's
[58:46] just a condition of the
[58:48] mind it's not a condition of the word
[58:51] it's not a condition of the Holy Spirit
[58:53] and power that's within us it's a
[58:55] condition of this world that we live in
[58:56] that that influences our minds but he's
[58:59] saying don't be weary in other words
[59:02] don't do that have you ever talk to a
[59:04] child and you and you say you know you
[59:06] see them doing something wrong and you
[59:07] say don't do that it's really just that
[59:09] simple just don't do that if you don't
[59:11] do that then you'll be it'll be better
[59:12] for you and and we want to complicate it
[59:16] well I'm doing this because of a strain
[59:18] in my family I'm doing this because of
[59:20] of fear or because of my pressure at at
[59:23] school I'm doing this because you know I
[59:25] want to in I'm doing it just don't
[59:27] complicate it lay aside every
[59:30] weight hallu that's right first John 5
[59:33] and4 says for whatsoever is born of God
[59:36] how many here is born of
[59:38] God overcometh the world is that
[59:43] simple so it's that he didn't say you
[59:46] know based on certain conditions you
[59:49] will overcome the world whosoever is
[59:51] born of God overcomes the world you're
[59:53] an overcomer it's it's a condition of
[59:56] the Overcomer it's a state of being of
[59:58] the Overcomer it's a state of mind of
[1:00:01] the
[1:00:02] Overcomer who soever is born whatsoever
[1:00:05] is born of God overcometh the world and
[1:00:07] this is the victory that overcometh the
[1:00:09] world even our faith your
[1:00:13] faith so we want to talk a little bit
[1:00:15] about the old gang because I believe
[1:00:18] that last night after the prayer line I
[1:00:20] believe the old gang is
[1:00:22] dead that old gang the the gang that
[1:00:25] used to to gang up on you you know used
[1:00:28] to come with their their bullying and
[1:00:29] their pressures and and their little uh
[1:00:32] you know their their fears and their
[1:00:34] torments and the habits and temptations
[1:00:37] that gang is dead okay but let's just
[1:00:40] identify the devil here a little bit
[1:00:42] amen we want to expose him he's a bully
[1:00:45] right the Devil is a
[1:00:47] bully and to be a bully it implies that
[1:00:50] you are intimidating somebody through
[1:00:53] threats through insults it doesn't say
[1:00:56] through facts it doesn't say through
[1:00:58] anything like that it's about it's about
[1:01:00] creating an imaginary world so that you
[1:01:03] can manipulate and control that
[1:01:05] individual that is bullying right
[1:01:08] bullying is to intimidate someone
[1:01:09] through threats through insults or
[1:01:12] through aggressive behavior if you can't
[1:01:15] get somebody to do what you want them to
[1:01:16] do you become aggressive you become you
[1:01:19] start to shove them you start to push
[1:01:20] them around amen you start to to do

[1:01:37] manipulate you he cannot control you

[1:01:42] are in Christ but he's trying to
[1:01:44] manipulate you he's trying to get you
[1:01:46] off balance why he doesn't have any
[1:01:48] strength he does not have any power but
[1:01:50] if you can give him power he suddenly
[1:01:52] has power he has he's a liar amen he's
[1:01:56] he's a deceiver he has no power to
[1:01:58] create he cannot do anything good for
[1:02:00] you amen all he can do is steal from you
[1:02:04] amen the the devil is powerless that
[1:02:06] means he has no resources he has no
[1:02:08] strength everything he says and does is
[1:02:11] a lie it's a facade it's it's a
[1:02:14] propaganda amen it's a day we're living
[1:02:16] in amen it's a day of false news right
[1:02:19] fake news that is the devil this is his
[1:02:22] kingdom amen so he's come to his uh his
[1:02:25] strength
[1:02:26] which is really nothing there's nothing
[1:02:28] there the the greatest thing that he has
[1:02:31] is the weakest thing he has amen it's
[1:02:34] really it's really sad actually you
[1:02:37] almost feel sorry for
[1:02:39] him right because he really has no
[1:02:42] strength but you see if he comes to you
[1:02:44] and he says you know what are you sure
[1:02:46] that you are a Christian are you sure
[1:02:48] that that that that God loves you and
[1:02:51] then you start to reason you accept his
[1:02:54] invitation right to reason and then you
[1:02:56] open your mind and you say now obviously
[1:02:59] you're not going to the word you've
[1:03:01] bypassing your safety right and you're
[1:03:04] you're going you're on his territory now
[1:03:07] right and he's playing games in your
[1:03:08] mind now remember the word hasn't
[1:03:10] changed concerning you right God hasn't
[1:03:13] changed his mind concerning you but the
[1:03:14] devil's coming trying to manipulate you
[1:03:17] so that you right can't run the
[1:03:21] race trying to weigh you down so he
[1:03:24] comes and he tries to manipulate you
[1:03:26] with your mind amen we're in the head
[1:03:28] age right we're in the mind age and so
[1:03:31] he tries to manipulate your mind why
[1:03:33] because when you say yeah maybe you're
[1:03:35] right you're actually giving him
[1:03:37] strength you're actually giving him
[1:03:39] power see he does not have any power
[1:03:41] you're the one with the power but as
[1:03:43] soon as you accept his lie you're
[1:03:45] actually giving him strength you're
[1:03:47] giving him the
[1:03:48] weapons you know it's amazing what
[1:03:50] they're doing with Israel right don't
[1:03:52] defend yourself don't don't this don't
[1:03:54] do that and if you if you don't listen
[1:03:56] to us we're not going to arm you
[1:03:58] Israel's strength is not based on
[1:04:00] America's support Israel's strength is
[1:04:02] based on the word they will be there
[1:04:03] till the end there will be a third
[1:04:05] temple in Millennium amen they're going
[1:04:07] to be there so their strength is based
[1:04:09] on the word of
[1:04:10] God but the devil will try and bully you
[1:04:14] he will threaten you these threats are
[1:04:16] are empty because the price has been
[1:04:19] paid you don't even exist anymore you're
[1:04:21] hid in
[1:04:23] Christ he tries to ident identify you
[1:04:26] and he tries to say who you are don't
[1:04:28] listen to him he doesn't have a clue who
[1:04:30] you are he doesn't know who you are
[1:04:32] you're hidden you're a mystery to
[1:04:37] him he tries to use your strength your
[1:04:40] power to frighten
[1:04:43] you it's amazing how a bully can only
[1:04:46] use you right he cannot come with
[1:04:48] anything original he has to use your
[1:04:51] life to threaten you with that right he
[1:04:54] tries to rob you essentially a bully is
[1:04:57] is is a is a thief right he he steals
[1:04:59] your joy he steals your freedom he
[1:05:02] steals your ability to maneuver right he
[1:05:05] he he causes you to walk differently
[1:05:07] where you would walk down a certain
[1:05:09] hallway at school maybe if you knew the
[1:05:10] bully was there you would go another way
[1:05:13] right so he hinders the way you live
[1:05:15] right he he in other words takes your
[1:05:17] lunch right your your Mana your food he
[1:05:21] tries to steal those things away from
[1:05:23] you but you know what my brother and
[1:05:24] sister the point is you're in possession
[1:05:26] of your own
[1:05:27] lunch you possess the food you have it
[1:05:30] you you have to literally give it to him
[1:05:33] for him to
[1:05:34] succeed now obviously this is more
[1:05:37] serious than just your
[1:05:39] lunch he wants to take your joy he wants
[1:05:41] to take your health he wants to take
[1:05:43] your
[1:05:44] inheritance he wants to get you to slip
[1:05:46] up he wants to move you off the word but
[1:05:49] we know this bride cannot fail she's not
[1:05:51] like the first bride amen it's not like
[1:05:54] Eve in the garden of Eden so Satan
[1:05:57] though here's here's a here's a very
[1:05:59] important fact a little key to remember
[1:06:01] in the in the coming months years if the
[1:06:04] Lord would carry right Satan is only
[1:06:06] interested in destroying you and your
[1:06:09] family he's only interested in
[1:06:11] destroying you so when you get that bad
[1:06:13] feeling when you get that worry or that
[1:06:15] anxiety remember that's the devil trying
[1:06:17] to destroy you don't give him room just
[1:06:20] lay it
[1:06:22] aside the word is our place of safety
[1:06:24] amen now the devil wants to distract us
[1:06:27] off the word he wants to rob you from
[1:06:28] your joy your blessings but remember the
[1:06:30] word has not changed concerning you the
[1:06:33] message has not changed there's nothing
[1:06:35] wrong with the message there's nothing
[1:06:36] wrong with the word amen so these things
[1:06:38] are fixed and we must remember that as
[1:06:39] we go forward the love of Christ his
[1:06:42] choosing of you right his election of
[1:06:45] you the the things that he has said
[1:06:47] about you is fixed amen amen
[1:06:51] amen so everything else is like this fog
[1:06:54] and the devil
[1:06:56] gets in that fog in the message the
[1:06:58] manifestation of the spirit he says now
[1:07:00] how do you get saved here's a good
[1:07:02] question how do you get saved he says
[1:07:05] let's take it in a childlike form where
[1:07:08] every believer no matter if what church
[1:07:10] you belong to or who your pastor is if
[1:07:12] he's a right man he will tell you that
[1:07:14] you can only be saved through faith not
[1:07:17] through Works in other words there's
[1:07:19] nothing that we can do he's already done
[1:07:21] it we have faith in what he has done
[1:07:24] amen through faith says he says now you
[1:07:28] believe that he saved you now first
[1:07:31] thing that comes from the heart you
[1:07:33] believe it then you walk up and you
[1:07:35] confess it and say I accept Jesus as my
[1:07:38] personal savior I believe he saved me
[1:07:41] wow that's pretty simple I believe he
[1:07:43] saved me there's not a physical thing in
[1:07:46] the world that you could prove that you
[1:07:48] are
[1:07:49] saved your eyes are the same color you
[1:07:53] got the same shirt on that you hat on
[1:07:56] you go outside and here's where he uses
[1:07:58] this phrase he says you go outside and
[1:08:00] the old gang is
[1:08:03] waiting the old gang says they ain't
[1:08:07] nothing to that but you believe there is
[1:08:10] something to it don't you so there's
[1:08:13] there's this Warfare right in the mind
[1:08:16] the old gang is always ready to gang up
[1:08:18] on you there's nothing to that what
[1:08:21] proof do you have what sensation did you
[1:08:23] have what emotion did you have did you
[1:08:25] feel
[1:08:26] anything and yet you came to the service
[1:08:29] and you said amen to the word you said
[1:08:31] Lord I believe that there's something in
[1:08:33] me that's reaching out to you is a deep
[1:08:35] calling to a deep Lord and on the basis
[1:08:37] of what you said that if we believe on
[1:08:40] the Lord Jesus Christ down the house
[1:08:41] shall be saved that is for me and I
[1:08:44] believe it just that way I'm going to
[1:08:46] lay aside everything else and I believe
[1:08:48] that I am
[1:08:49] saved amen well the old gang will come
[1:08:53] and he'll say there's nothing to that
[1:08:54] but you believe there is something he
[1:08:56] says what if you say well I'm going to
[1:08:58] see how it works out I'm going to see
[1:09:01] how this week will play out I'm going to
[1:09:03] see if I'm really saved don't do that
[1:09:06] that's not how this works it's based on
[1:09:08] the word of God Amen it's based on the
[1:09:12] his promise to
[1:09:13] you he says
[1:09:16] now he says you're saved he says now
[1:09:18] what if you say well I'm going to say
[1:09:20] how it works out it'll never work out
[1:09:22] until you keep your testimony going so
[1:09:24] many of you you confessed uh uh him as
[1:09:28] your personal savior last night as your
[1:09:30] personal healer you confess that Amen in
[1:09:33] his presence he says now keep your

[1:12:54] the promise concerning him and all he
[1:12:57] just looked around in his field amen
[1:12:59] looking around in your field and he just
[1:13:02] picked up the first thing he saw which
[1:13:03] was a Jawbone of an ass my brother and
[1:13:05] sister it wasn't because of that bone
[1:13:07] that he had in his hand it was because

[1:13:14] confession
[1:13:16] amen hallelujah you don't have to be
[1:13:19] bullied around you don't have to be

[1:13:34] works until they do it to the wrong
[1:13:37] person amen you get this big brother
[1:13:40] right I remember being bullied I
[1:13:41] probably shouldn't tell the story so you
[1:13:43] might have to delete this out of the
[1:13:45] sermon but I remember in high school I
[1:13:47] was being bullied by this guy it didn't
[1:13:49] last very long but he he came up to me
[1:13:51] and and he says and he kind of shoved me
[1:13:53] like that against the the lockers and
[1:13:55] and you
[1:13:56] know and I don't know I don't know what
[1:13:59] was going through my mind but he shoved
[1:14:01] me up against the lockers like that and
[1:14:02] then he said you're a Christian right
[1:14:03] and I said yes and uh I don't know why
[1:14:06] he picked on me there was a lot of
[1:14:07] Christians in the school but he picked
[1:14:09] on me and and he and he did this and and
[1:14:11] he says you're a Christian right and and
[1:14:13] then he uh just as he said it I was I
[1:14:16] was just saying uh yes I'm a you know he
[1:14:18] hit me like this on the side of the head
[1:14:21] uh and um and and uh and you're just
[1:14:23] you're just waking up right what's
[1:14:25] happening
[1:14:27] here you know and it's and at in this
[1:14:30] you know you don't really get a whole
[1:14:32] lot of time to think this through you're
[1:14:33] just being bullied right it just kind of
[1:14:36] catches you off guard it's just wham bam
[1:14:39] you know what's going on here what's
[1:14:41] happening you know this is not normal
[1:14:44] right this is unusual behavior and so he
[1:14:48] what is he trying to do is trying to
[1:14:49] intimidate me right now I had a choice
[1:14:52] right but I'm trying to figure out okay
[1:14:53] he's trying to use the word again
[1:14:55] against me he's actually trying to use
[1:14:56] what I believe against me and so he and
[1:14:59] so when he hit me like that he says he
[1:15:01] says well if you're a Christian aren't
[1:15:02] you supposed to turn the other cheek you
[1:15:04] know what I did is I turned the other
[1:15:06] cheek and he hit me
[1:15:09] again I thought at that moment that you
[1:15:12] know maybe he'll get the point and you
[1:15:14] know he won't hit me but this was a
[1:15:16] bully see he's not interested in the
[1:15:19] truth he's not interested in the
[1:15:20] principles of the word he's not
[1:15:22] interested in any of those things he
[1:15:23] wants to intimidate you to rob you and
[1:15:26] you know what's funny I never thought
[1:15:27] past that scripture until that day but
[1:15:29] at that moment when he hit me
[1:15:31] again I realized it doesn't say anything
[1:15:36] else and I think he realized that as
[1:15:38] well after he hit me the second time man
[1:15:41] now it was like I've done my
[1:15:45] part I won't tell you the rest of the
[1:15:47] story but he never bullied me
[1:15:49] again never touched me again why because
[1:15:53] you have a right to defend yourself
[1:15:55] and you know that's what they're trying
[1:15:56] to do to Israel they're trying to tell
[1:15:58] them you don't have a right to defend
[1:16:00] yourself well that's their land nobody
[1:16:03] has a right to tell Israel they should
[1:16:05] not defend themselves they're surrounded
[1:16:07] by every kind of enemy enemies that want
[1:16:09] to see them wiped off the face of this
[1:16:11] Earth they have a right to defend
[1:16:13] themselves and somebody in Israel has to
[1:16:16] stand up and say I have a right to
[1:16:18] defend
[1:16:19] myself you have a right to defend
[1:16:22] yourself prde you have a right to stand
[1:16:24] against sickness say you have a right to
[1:16:25] stand against that
[1:16:28] devil it belongs to you the land is
[1:16:32] yours healing is yours Joy is yours
[1:16:35] happiness is yours and when you go from
[1:16:37] this Camp remember that that bully is
[1:16:39] going to be waiting at home for you that
[1:16:41] old gang is going to wait for you at
[1:16:43] school th those old habits and
[1:16:45] temptations they're going to be waiting
[1:16:47] for you but you have a right to say you
[1:16:50] cannot touch me anymore
[1:16:52] Hallelujah right you have no right
[1:16:57] Hallelujah will not bully me anymore you
[1:17:01] have to stand up for yourself you have
[1:17:03] to make a decision in your mind that
[1:17:05] this is not about my old family strain
[1:17:07] you know it's amazing you know that how
[1:17:09] the devil will use little things like
[1:17:11] that and just you know he'll it's
[1:17:13] amazing how elaborate and how beautiful
[1:17:15] he can present things and it oh it makes
[1:17:17] sense yeah so I guess it must be true
[1:17:19] excuse me old family strange you know
[1:17:23] it's amazing even a bastard born
[1:17:25] child brother Brandon fixed that he says
[1:17:28] the new birth fixes
[1:17:31] that I don't know who who was my mother
[1:17:33] and father I don't know where I was born
[1:17:35] from I don't know what kind of family

[1:17:43] Christ Jesus all things are passed away
[1:17:47] that devil has no right to afflict you
[1:17:49] like that it's not about your your old
[1:17:52] family it's about your new family

[1:19:26] even if you go through the valley of the
[1:19:27] shadow of death thou art with
[1:19:31] me you know I don't know I don't know um
[1:19:34] I think your national sport here is
[1:19:35] still rugby isn't it I used to play
[1:19:38] rugby and you know I used to be wing and
[1:19:41] it's amazing how they play this this
[1:19:43] this game of intimidation you know
[1:19:44] they'll put the big guy up against the
[1:19:46] little guy and you know they're try to
[1:19:48] unbalance things right to find weak
[1:19:50] spots and so forth and I remember being
[1:19:52] wing and and man that flanker used to
[1:19:53] come off the back into that scrum and
[1:19:56] and you know it's almost like he's got
[1:19:58] this grin on his face because he nose
[1:20:01] the little guy is on the
[1:20:03] wing and you know it's coming you know
[1:20:06] he's got the ball right but you know
[1:20:08] it's amazing how that I don't know why
[1:20:10] they designed rugby like this but you
[1:20:12] know the position of the wing he's kind
[1:20:14] of on the Blind Side of the
[1:20:16] field you know why not put two or three
[1:20:19] guys on The Blind Side but they you know
[1:20:20] they it's like I don't know it's a
[1:20:22] British game I guess but they put it on
[1:20:24] the put this guy on The Blind Side of
[1:20:26] the field in other words he's alone out
[1:20:28] there right they've got the big the
[1:20:30] PowerHouse the scrum you know they're
[1:20:32] they're there in the center of the field
[1:20:34] and and they're the where all the big
[1:20:36] muscle is you know all the big guys you
[1:20:38] know where you kind of want to hug close
[1:20:40] to them in a rugby game you know you
[1:20:42] know if you mess with me he's going to
[1:20:44] get to you you know this is he's my
[1:20:45] buddy you know we're on the same team
[1:20:47] you know he's just you know Rippling
[1:20:50] muscles and you know he's just you know
[1:20:52] you feel good because he's on your side
[1:20:54] right and then you've got the fast guys
[1:20:56] you've got the guy who can kick you've
[1:20:57] got all these specialty kind of uh
[1:20:59] skilled players on your team and man
[1:21:01] it's a great sport okay so we come over
[1:21:04] over here on the wing side and it's like
[1:21:06] you kind of stand there on the edge of
[1:21:08] the field and there's your big scrum
[1:21:10] team you know they've got they've got
[1:21:11] all the big guys there and they you've
[1:21:12] got all your fast Runners on that side
[1:21:14] all your buddies you know they're kind
[1:21:16] of a little bit of a distance away from
[1:21:18] you all of a sudden and here you are and
[1:21:20] the whole field is open on this side and
[1:21:22] it's just you
[1:21:25] and it's like the enemy knows that the
[1:21:28] enemy knows that you walk alone with God
[1:21:30] sometimes amen that you are there and
[1:21:33] and maybe you are the small guy on the
[1:21:35] team you're not really designed for
[1:21:38] these things amen so you've so you're
[1:21:40] kind of off balance you you feel like
[1:21:43] you are not evenly matched do you hear
[1:21:46] what I'm saying you feel like you're not
[1:21:48] evenly matched yet you have a position
[1:21:50] on the field now you have a choice as
[1:21:54] that big guy breaks free from their
[1:21:56] scrum remember the muscle team right
[1:21:57] there he comes Breaking Free from their
[1:21:59] side of the scrum he comes on The Blind
[1:22:01] Side of the field because he knows
[1:22:02] there's going to be this little weak guy
[1:22:04] standing there the idea is to intimidate
[1:22:07] by fear amen so I mean he comes running
[1:22:10] down that side side and he's got he's
[1:22:11] frothing at the mouth you know he's
[1:22:13] sweating he's you know and he's just you
[1:22:16] know he's just intimidating you you know
[1:22:18] what I'm saying he's coming down and all
[1:22:20] you see is it's like slow motion and you
[1:22:23] all you can picture is I'm going to get
[1:22:25] crushed this guy is going to destroy me
[1:22:29] but you have a choice to make why
[1:22:31] because you're in the position you have
[1:22:34] authority I'm the wingman amen I have a
[1:22:37] position I might not be big enough I
[1:22:39] might not be designed for this kind of
[1:22:41] uh off balance amen but yet you're in
[1:22:45] position do you see what I'm saying you
[1:22:48] have a job to do now if you let fear
[1:22:50] overcome you you're going to be crushed
[1:22:53] you will be crushed amen but if you know
[1:22:56] the weak
[1:22:58] spot because of
[1:23:00] training you see training Faith cometh
[1:23:02] by hearing right so now you stand there
[1:23:05] in a whole different way you see this
[1:23:07] guy Breaking Free you're not afraid
[1:23:09] because you know how to bring him down
[1:23:12] you know he's trying to intimidate you
[1:23:13] with his muscles and all these things
[1:23:14] but it doesn't matter if you wrap up his
[1:23:16] legs he going to fall like anybody else
[1:23:19] it doesn't matter how big he is it
[1:23:21] doesn't matter how fast he is it doesn't
[1:23:23] matter how well he's trained my brother
[1:23:25] and sister if you just apply this basic
[1:23:27] rules of combat if you apply the basic
[1:23:30] rules rugby is like combat right if you
[1:23:32] apply the basic rules of of rugby you
[1:23:34] will bring him down amen it doesn't
[1:23:37] matter so you have authority you have
[1:23:40] Insight you have Revelation on what his
[1:23:42] weak spot is amen when he breaks free
[1:23:45] and he's smiling at you I smile back at
[1:23:47] him I've got
[1:23:49] you you're not coming over this line
[1:23:53] amen you're going to come this far far
[1:23:54] and no further amen why because I'm
[1:23:56] going to wrap up your legs and you're
[1:23:58] going to come falling
[1:24:00] down you see what I'm saying it depends
[1:24:03] on how we see things but see the devil
[1:24:05] wants to put us in a position of a
[1:24:06] victim I'm a victim I'm going to get
[1:24:08] hurt I'm going to get crushed oh he did
[1:24:10] it to me before oh it's going to hurt my
[1:24:13] brother and sister you know there was a
[1:24:15] um I'm sorry this is not in my notes but
[1:24:17] there was a there was a champion of of
[1:24:19] New
[1:24:21] Zealand John
[1:24:23] alamu that big guy right I mean oh they
[1:24:26] feared him on the rugby Fields right
[1:24:28] they feared him he would just plow over
[1:24:31] people but you know the South African
[1:24:33] rugby team figured him
[1:24:35] out right they figured him out yeah they
[1:24:39] realized you know when they when that
[1:24:41] guy broke free you know what they did
[1:24:43] they had prayer meetings they said come
[1:24:46] we need to gather together because we
[1:24:49] can bring them down if we stay together
[1:24:51] if we stand together don't leave
[1:24:53] somebody exposed on the field yes he's
[1:24:55] big but we can bring him down if we stay
[1:24:57] together and they would grab a hold of
[1:24:59] each other as they went in to tackle
[1:25:01] that guy and yes it it would be hard and
[1:25:04] it would be heavy but they had somebody
[1:25:06] with them they felt the strength of one
[1:25:08] another on the field hallelujah
[1:25:11] hallelujah I'm talking about bullies in
[1:25:13] our lives Don't Be Afraid we have all
[1:25:15] the resources to overcome gather
[1:25:18] together grab a hold of one another like
[1:25:20] that prayer line last night there's no
[1:25:22] bully big enough
[1:25:29] David and Goliath we need to talk about
[1:25:31] David and Goliath amen they showed up to
[1:25:34] the battlefield with anticipation you
[1:25:36] can imagine how they felt coming to that
[1:25:39] Battlefield that day the army of Israel
[1:25:42] and the army of the Philistines what a
[1:25:44] setting amen and they both these armies
[1:25:47] in their battle array coming with
[1:25:48] they've got their own Kings they've got
[1:25:50] their own uh Champions they've got their
[1:25:52] own uh archers and weap of warfare and
[1:25:55] man what a what a scene huh and can you
[1:25:58] imagine Israel showing up to the
[1:26:00] Battlefront we have our King we have our
[1:26:02] our weapons of warfare we've been
[1:26:04] trained in the in the Battle of and and
[1:26:06] the and the Art of War and all these
[1:26:07] things we know Maneuvers we know all
[1:26:09] these things amen and then they show up
[1:26:11] to this
[1:26:13] Valley and they can look across the
[1:26:15] other side and something
[1:26:17] happens no doubt is Israel was not
[1:26:20] planning on losing the battle that day
[1:26:22] they didn't show up to this battle
[1:26:24] you know like oh we're going to lose and
[1:26:26] oh well I guess we just need to go
[1:26:27] through the motions no you show up to
[1:26:30] win you're going to imagine those young
[1:26:33] soldiers the younger generation that was
[1:26:35] standing there it didn't matter that
[1:26:36] Saul had his head in the wrong place but
[1:26:38] you you think of those young men that
[1:26:40] was standing there that day they were
[1:26:41] there to do battle they were there to
[1:26:44] fight the enemy they were there to to
[1:26:46] win a victory for
[1:26:48] Israel but something happened on this
[1:26:50] day I want to show you the power of
[1:26:53] fear but it had to be given to the
[1:26:56] enemy 1st Samuel 17:2 says and Saul and
[1:26:59] the men of Israel were gathered together
[1:27:02] and they pitched by the valley of Ella
[1:27:05] and set the battle in Array against the
[1:27:07] Philistines everything was in order amen
[1:27:09] they had their cook there they had
[1:27:10] everything everything was good right
[1:27:13] it's not like they were lacking anything
[1:27:15] they had everything the enemy
[1:27:18] had you know they even had their own
[1:27:20] champion
[1:27:24] and the Philistines stood on a mountain
[1:27:26] on the other side and Israel stood on a
[1:27:28] mountain on the other side and there was
[1:27:30] a valley between them there's a CM
[1:27:32] there's a there's a dividing line but
[1:27:35] something was different this day this is
[1:27:37] not going to be a regular conflict you
[1:27:40] see the Philistines had figured out if
[1:27:41] we come head-to-head with these guys you
[1:27:43] know it doesn't bode well for us we need
[1:27:46] to change the tactics we need to play a
[1:27:49] different strategy we got to have a
[1:27:52] different maneuver because they beat us
[1:27:54] on on these uh on every other strategy
[1:27:57] they they seem to overwhelm us they seem
[1:27:58] to overcome us we don't understand it so
[1:28:00] we got to change our game so they start
[1:28:03] to play a different game and this game
[1:28:04] is going to be a battle of the
[1:28:07] mind not a battle of man against man
[1:28:10] Army against Army this was the regular
[1:28:13] way of of of of of warfare of that day
[1:28:16] you know man against man spear against
[1:28:18] Spear Shield against Shield they said we
[1:28:20] got to change this you know they were
[1:28:23] afraid of is Israel well we got to
[1:28:25] change this because you know they know
[1:28:27] that they can defeat us we got to that's
[1:28:29] where we got to attack them is in the
[1:28:31] mind we got to change our battle
[1:28:33] strategy let's attack it attack them in
[1:28:35] the mind and verse four says and there
[1:28:37] went
[1:28:38] out oh my how many hairs met this
[1:28:41] Champion there went out a champion out
[1:28:44] of the camp of the Philistines named
[1:28:47] Goliath of gath whose height was six
[1:28:49] cubits and a span verse 5 says and he
[1:28:53] had a helmet of brass upon his head and
[1:28:55] he was armed with a coat of mail and the
[1:28:58] weight of the coat of was 5,000 shekels
[1:29:00] of
[1:29:04] brass oh
[1:29:06] man weighing out the enemy it's amazing
[1:29:10] how you know the whole Army shows up
[1:29:12] there's no details given about the
[1:29:14] armies but there's so much detail given
[1:29:16] about this Champion you know it's like
[1:29:18] they had a lot of time to look at this
[1:29:20] guy in other words they stopped long
[1:29:22] enough
[1:29:24] to really hone in on the details of this
[1:29:27] bad guy this bully they saw everything
[1:29:30] they saw how many shackles of weight and
[1:29:33] they saw the kind of spear he had they
[1:29:35] saw how tall he was you know you stop
[1:29:37] long enough the devil will start playing
[1:29:39] games with your mind just stop long
[1:29:42] enough you hear that music you hear this
[1:29:43] or you smell this and you stop long
[1:29:45] enough and you start to remember things
[1:29:47] you start to see things the mind right
[1:29:49] the devil is playing a trick on your
[1:29:51] mind
[1:29:54] had a helmet of brass you think any of
[1:29:57] these things any of these facts I mean
[1:29:59] it's amazing you can have those War uh
[1:30:02] strategists you know that and analysts
[1:30:04] that look at at a battle and they'll say
[1:30:05] there's so many of these guys so many of
[1:30:06] these guys and do you know those things
[1:30:08] just don't matter how many times has the
[1:30:11] underdog won the battle in in the face
[1:30:13] of great odds in the face of of whatever
[1:30:16] the numbers were it doesn't even matter
[1:30:19] what about Moses against all of Egypt do
[1:30:22] you see what I'm saying this is the kind
[1:30:23] of God we serve it doesn't matter how
[1:30:25] strong the enemy looks it doesn't matter
[1:30:27] how many there is there's always more of
[1:30:31] us
[1:30:34] amen don't let the devil play games with
[1:30:36] your mind but I love how the scripture
[1:30:39] here you know and he had gaves of brass
[1:30:41] even the language is so dramatic right
[1:30:44] gaves of brass upon his legs and a
[1:30:48] target of brass between his shoulders
[1:30:50] you know thankful for that you know this
[1:30:52] um I got to be careful here but you know
[1:30:56] in the Bor
[1:30:58] War there was there was uh it was
[1:31:02] interesting you know how the British
[1:31:03] would have targets literally on their
[1:31:06] chest shoot here right here this guy he
[1:31:13] has a target of brass I'm just reading
[1:31:16] the scripture here he has a target of
[1:31:18] brass between his
[1:31:19] shoulders between his
[1:31:22] shoulders right shoot here here I mean
[1:31:28] it's my point is we see the enemy's weak
[1:31:31] spot we noted it's been well
[1:31:34] identified it's been well laid out this
[1:31:37] is where his weak spot is if you just
[1:31:39] wrap up his legs he will come down if
[1:31:41] you resist the devil he will flee cast
[1:31:43] down reasonings the target is well
[1:31:46] painted it's almost like somebody went
[1:31:48] ahead painted a Target all over the
[1:31:50] enemy amen shoot here it'll kill him
[1:31:55] right and the staff of his spear was
[1:31:57] like a Weaver's beam who cares and his
[1:32:01] Spear's head weighed 600 shekels of iron
[1:32:04] who cares amen and one bearing a shield
[1:32:08] went before him who to
[1:32:10] do do you see what I'm saying it depends
[1:32:13] on how you approach the story but
[1:32:16] brother Chris he was he was so tall he's
[1:32:19] a they call him a champion I don't care
[1:32:21] what they call him amen I'm a Son of God
[1:32:25] I don't care what label they put on it
[1:32:29] cancer
[1:32:30] depression right suicide I don't care
[1:32:33] what label they put on their Champion
[1:32:34] I'm a Son of God I care only about the
[1:32:38] label that I
[1:32:40] have who cares about what they call that
[1:32:42] enemy who cares about those things my
[1:32:44] brother and sister those things
[1:32:45] sometimes you know somebody will say
[1:32:47] you've been diagnosed with cancer and
[1:32:48] it's like this wave of fear a champion
[1:32:52] came out from the philistine Camp his
[1:32:54] name is cancer who cares you know that
[1:32:58] even cancer will not stand in front of
[1:33:00] you we've seen two cases in our church
[1:33:02] where people have been healed from
[1:33:03] cancer specifically where it's
[1:33:05] documented well you know well
[1:33:08] known we don't have to fear the the
[1:33:10] champion of the enemy's Camp it doesn't
[1:33:13] matter what they call him it doesn't
[1:33:15] matter the size of his Spear and and
[1:33:17] even was brother Chris he was big he's a
[1:33:19] big guy big guy how many here is afraid
[1:33:22] of fighting a giant how many here would
[1:33:24] would honestly be afraid of fighting a
[1:33:25] giant right when we think of giants how
[1:33:27] big would a giant have to be for you to
[1:33:29] be afraid of
[1:33:31] him he would have to be ginormous you
[1:33:34] know that this guy was not that
[1:33:38] big I know you know he was not that big
[1:33:43] if you go look it up he was he was not
[1:33:45] even 10
[1:33:47] feet you
[1:33:49] know he was not even 10 ft it's amazing
[1:33:53] that he wasn't 10 ft you know that
[1:33:55] because 10 would be like a nice complete
[1:33:57] number Perfection fullness he's not even
[1:34:00] that he's just like 9 ft n something you
[1:34:04] know somebody actually took the trouble
[1:34:06] to go measure him out he he's not he did
[1:34:08] not even reach the full length you know
[1:34:09] he's just like this half-baked enemy
[1:34:12] right 9 N now if if I'm standing on the
[1:34:17] stage I'm not very tall okay but 9'9
[1:34:20] would just be like right
[1:34:22] here you know he wouldn't be you know
[1:34:25] what I mean he would fit through the
[1:34:26] doorway here and he would
[1:34:28] he do you know what I'm saying he's not
[1:34:31] that
[1:34:32] big but it's amazing how the whole Army
[1:34:35] of Israel halted in their Advance
[1:34:37] stopped at the valley looked across and
[1:34:40] a champion comes out and he's got this
[1:34:42] little guy in front of him who cares
[1:34:44] about the little guy you know um it's as
[1:34:47] simple as like you know you take care of
[1:34:49] the little guy and us five we'll take

[1:35:48] rocks do whatever you got to do but get
[1:35:50] rid of that Philistine he doesn't have

[1:36:54] I love Israel's war tactics they strike
[1:36:58] first if they get a wind that the enemy
[1:36:59] is coming they don't wait for them to
[1:37:02] strike right they don't wait for for
[1:37:05] reasoning to develop they don't wait for
[1:37:08] you know okay this is where I've been
[1:37:10] for the last 10 years and and this is

[1:39:04] a Son of God Satan you have no right to
[1:39:06] afflict me anymore
[1:39:13] amen and he stood and Cried unto the
[1:39:15] armies of Israel it should never have
[1:39:17] gotten this far and said unto them why
[1:39:19] are you come out to set your battle in
[1:39:21] Array why did you come to fight us
[1:39:24] wait a
[1:39:25] second do you know what I mean you know
[1:39:27] have you ever had somebody come and ask
[1:39:28] you questions and it's like why is he
[1:39:30] asking me these questions trying to
[1:39:32] belittle me he trying to make me feel
[1:39:34] inferior it's trying to cause confusion
[1:39:37] but the funny thing is we try and answer
[1:39:39] his questions and in trying to answer
[1:39:42] his questions we give him power because
[1:39:44] now we're feeding him he doesn't know
[1:39:46] anything why have you come to fight us
[1:39:48] uh we've come here to destroy you you're
[1:39:51] our enemy
[1:39:55] amen am not I a Philistine and you
[1:39:58] Servants of Saul yeah right even the
[1:40:02] devil knows that he is the Son of
[1:40:04] God
[1:40:07] right choose you a man for you and let
[1:40:10] him come down to me like I said we
[1:40:12] should never have gotten to this place
[1:40:15] we wait for some great ministry to rise
[1:40:17] we wait for some choose you something to
[1:40:20] match me you know our churches should
[1:40:23] never get get to a place where we're
[1:40:24] trying to match what they're doing in
[1:40:25] the denominations choose you a man
[1:40:27] choose you somebody to can that can
[1:40:30] confront me that can match
[1:40:32] me in his mind he's thinking you know
[1:40:35] he's a little bit taller than everybody
[1:40:36] else maybe by 3 feet 2 and a half fet
[1:40:39] something like that right which is not a
[1:40:40] big deal but he thinks he's a little bit
[1:40:42] bigger so he's saying why don't you
[1:40:44] choose yourself a champion you know if
[1:40:46] you guys are Israelites I'm a Philistine
[1:40:48] in other words I'm changing the Battle
[1:40:50] Tactics I'm going to just set new rules
[1:40:53] who who came up with these rules anyway
[1:40:56] right the the the Israelites should be
[1:40:58] standing there and going he doesn't get
[1:40:59] to make the
[1:41:01] rules you know it's amazing you know we
[1:41:03] look at the um I don't mean to pick on
[1:41:05] America again brother that's the last
[1:41:10] service but you know in the Civil War
[1:41:12] they would they would like line up
[1:41:14] across the field from each other man for
[1:41:16] man and it's like you get to shoot first
[1:41:19] and then we will fire a volley who came
[1:41:21] up with these rules just
[1:41:24] attack do you know what I'm saying why
[1:41:26] are we following these rules you know
[1:41:29] and then they would uh the snipers kind
[1:41:31] of were developed in this era and they
[1:41:33] and they would have a guy hiding up in a
[1:41:34] tree and he would shoot out the the the
[1:41:37] the officers and the commanders and so
[1:41:39] forth to break down Communications and
[1:41:41] so forth but you know those snipers in
[1:41:42] that day it was kind of a cowardly thing
[1:41:45] but if you're asking me it's
[1:41:48] brilliant it's brilliant amen you see
[1:41:51] we've been given weapons our weapons of
[1:41:53] our Warfare are not carnal but the devil
[1:41:56] wants us to match him man for man he
[1:41:58] wants us to match him in a carnal way
[1:42:01] with reasonings and with explanations
[1:42:04] and with emotions and with feelings he
[1:42:06] wants us to match a man for man when we
[1:42:08] have a god when we have a word the
[1:42:12] weapons of our Warfare are not
[1:42:16] carnal but we have spiritual weapons
[1:42:20] amen bring you out a man I mean like I
[1:42:23] say what a stupid thing to do uh uh I
[1:42:28] guess the rules are changing we have to
[1:42:30] Now find somebody do you see the
[1:42:32] confusion there and he knows you're not
[1:42:34] going to find somebody exactly as tall
[1:42:36] as
[1:42:37] him right what they should have done is
[1:42:41] said okay we accept your challenge gone
[1:42:42] back rallied the Army and
[1:42:46] attacked we're not going to listen to
[1:42:48] this guy's rules we're not going to
[1:42:50] listen to his dictates we're not going
[1:42:52] to let him manipulate us match him man
[1:42:55] are you kidding me do you see what I'm
[1:42:57] saying my my brother and sister we're
[1:42:59] going to go through this week we're
[1:43:00] going to go through next month and
[1:43:02] you're immediately going to be faced
[1:43:03] with this thing you're going to be
[1:43:05] matching the devil on his ground and
[1:43:07] he's going to make you believe that you
[1:43:09] have to come up with some explanation
[1:43:10] you have to feel good that you know he's
[1:43:13] going to say you know you felt so good
[1:43:14] at camp now you feel like this whose
[1:43:16] rules are you playing by anyway when he
[1:43:20] said that he is my joy he's my salvation
[1:43:26] Hallelujah don't don't go into the
[1:43:29] valley and match him man for
[1:43:33] man there's no rule book saying that you
[1:43:35] have to do that but see the bully knows
[1:43:38] that if he can get you to believe you
[1:43:39] have to do that then he can manipulate
[1:43:42] you he can control
[1:43:44] you that's why I say sometimes you hear
[1:43:46] these things and it's like what have you
[1:43:47] been listening to who have you been
[1:43:50] listening to
[1:43:54] listen to The Voice he'll tell you who
[1:43:57] you really are amen praise the Lord I
[1:44:00] don't want to keep you too long but
[1:44:01] let's let's just move through this
[1:44:02] little story
[1:44:07] here and if he be able to fight with me
[1:44:09] and to kill me then will he be your
[1:44:12] servants we will be your servants but if
[1:44:14] I Prevail against him and kill him then
[1:44:16] shall you be our servants and serve
[1:44:18] us
[1:44:20] okay like I say I'm trying to preach it
[1:44:23] in a light that that makes you realize
[1:44:25] how silly the devil is but his boast can
[1:44:29] be so
[1:44:30] convincing you know it's amazing how
[1:44:32] that whole Army
[1:44:34] halted came to a complete
[1:44:38] standstill just with that one
[1:44:41] voice we also have a voice amen it's
[1:44:44] inside of us and the Philistines said I
[1:44:46] defy the armies of Israel this day give
[1:44:49] me a man that we may fight together
[1:44:53] together you know what's amazing my
[1:44:54] brother and sister is even in this the
[1:44:57] Lord heard that and he said well if you
[1:44:58] want to play by those rules I will send
[1:45:01] you a man but he will not be a man that
[1:45:04] you think he will be amen I will be in
[1:45:08] him he God did not play by the devil's
[1:45:11] rules he did not come and mess around
[1:45:13] with the devil amen you know what he
[1:45:16] did he came with his
[1:45:19] man amen he the king of kings
[1:45:23] he was the champion of
[1:45:25] Israel David was not alone on that field
[1:45:28] it was not a stone that killed Phil the
[1:45:31] Philistine the prophet says that the
[1:45:33] Holy Ghost God got a hold of that stone
[1:45:35] God got in the Supernatural got in that
[1:45:38] stone and found its Mark between that
[1:45:40] Philistines
[1:45:42] helmet crushed his head
[1:45:45] amen because there was a mind
[1:45:48] battle the God knows where to strike the
[1:45:51] enemy one man with one big boast trying
[1:45:54] to intimidate the whole Israelite Army
[1:45:56] causing fear and basically paralyzing
[1:45:59] the army of Israel when Saul and Israel
[1:46:01] heard those words of the Philistine they
[1:46:03] were dismayed wow big surprise right and
[1:46:06] greatly afraid yeah if you're going to
[1:46:08] listen to him see this was not the
[1:46:11] regular enemy this was not regular
[1:46:13] tactics and yet it caused the whole Army
[1:46:16] the whole advance to come to a complete
[1:46:18] standstill one day you know it's amazing
[1:46:21] how that he came out there and he made
[1:46:22] his boast and the and the and Israel did
[1:46:25] not have a clue what to do not a clue he
[1:46:29] would come out one day and he would make
[1:46:31] this boast and that one day you know
[1:46:33] maybe the the soldiers and the
[1:46:35] Israelites side they would say well you
[1:46:37] know Saul is is he's got a plan you know
[1:46:40] they're they're over there they're
[1:46:41] making a plan he's he's he's going to
[1:46:42] choose a champion he's going to find a
[1:46:44] way for us you know they're believing
[1:46:47] it's it's amazing how you know that your
[1:46:48] family sometimes can be can have such
[1:46:50] faith and trust in their in their father
[1:46:52] or their mother
[1:46:53] they're going to do something about it
[1:46:55] but on the other side the father and
[1:46:56] mother's in such
[1:46:57] fear they're so so paralyzed by the the
[1:47:01] thing that's happening but the whole
[1:47:03] Army is depending on the headship the
[1:47:05] whole Army is depending on their leader
[1:47:07] to make the right decision to do the
[1:47:09] right
[1:47:10] thing
[1:47:14] amen and one day would lead into
[1:47:17] two I guess maybe
[1:47:21] today then
[1:47:23] two days would lead into three
[1:47:26] days and as these days progress my
[1:47:30] brother and sister it becomes more and
[1:47:32] more
[1:47:34] complicated more and more stories come
[1:47:37] up more and more rumors more and more
[1:47:40] explanations we're just waiting for the
[1:47:42] right season we're just waiting for him
[1:47:45] to get tired out there we're just
[1:47:46] waiting for this we're just waiting for
[1:47:47] that right next Sunday I'll do
[1:47:50] it more explanations not to have Victory
[1:47:54] when it would take a moment like I said
[1:47:55] it would take one Arrow to defeat that
[1:47:57] enemy it would take one spear it would
[1:47:59] take just a small group of men who cares
[1:48:01] if 30 30 Brothers went out there on the
[1:48:03] battlefield and took down that
[1:48:05] Philistine who cares we're not playing
[1:48:07] by the devil's rules
[1:48:09] am
[1:48:14] amen and more reasoning Creeps in as
[1:48:17] time goes on the Philistine says Drew
[1:48:20] near this is verse 16 the Philistine
[1:48:22] Drew near morning and evening and
[1:48:26] presented himself for 40
[1:48:30] days 40 days you would think somebody
[1:48:32] would get tired of
[1:48:38] that and I'm sure they had many
[1:48:41] psychologists suddenly among them trying
[1:48:44] to help them cope trying to help them
[1:48:47] put Band-Aids on their emotions and
[1:48:49] their feelings and they're this and
[1:48:51] we're a victim and and we're not strong
[1:48:53] enough
[1:48:54] and you see how sad it
[1:48:57] gets and when it was right there at the
[1:49:00] beginning somebody should have risen
[1:49:02] somebody should have stood up and said
[1:49:03] enough is
[1:49:07] enough you don't have to wait 40 days
[1:49:10] this next go around you don't have to
[1:49:11] wait for the cycle to play out we're not
[1:49:14] playing games with a devil we're the
[1:49:17] boss amen we're calling the shots the
[1:49:20] devil may try a different strategy a new
[1:49:23] angle but God has already seen his move
[1:49:26] God has a counter move coming amen his
[1:49:29] word will meet every condition he sees
[1:49:31] the trouble that you may have been in
[1:49:33] but he calls a stop to the enemy amen
[1:49:36] and so Jesse said unto David his
[1:49:39] son isn't that amazing I want you to
[1:49:42] notice David was not in that atmosphere
[1:49:44] of reasoning and doubt and fear he was
[1:49:47] in his father's house amen he was he was
[1:49:50] in his position he was tending to the
[1:49:51] Sheep
[1:49:53] and he tells him to take food take an
[1:49:55] epha of this porch corn and these 10
[1:49:57] Loaves and run to the camp run the race
[1:50:00] go quickly his father tells him go
[1:50:03] quickly amen here's the champion coming
[1:50:05] amen you go quickly to your brethren go
[1:50:09] to the front lines go to where the
[1:50:11] battle is amen and carry these 10
[1:50:14] cheeses how many here likes cheese I
[1:50:16] love cheese and the captain of their
[1:50:19] thousand and look how thy brethren
[1:50:21] farare
[1:50:23] go and knock on the door of your brother
[1:50:25] and how are you doing brother we haven't
[1:50:26] seen you in a long time but I bring you
[1:50:29] some good tidings I bring you the word

[1:50:34] time and why are you depressed what's
[1:50:36] what's going on here we haven't heard
[1:50:37] news of the victory we haven't we
[1:50:39] haven't received a testimony of your
[1:50:41] defeat over the Philistines amen we have
[1:50:43] not heard news from the camp of Israel
[1:50:46] so I've come to find out how are you
[1:50:48] doing and what are you
[1:50:50] doing amen but he doesn't just come
[1:50:53] rebuking there's no condemnation he just
[1:50:55] comes with food amen have you have you
[1:50:58] taken a look it's almost like hey we
[1:51:00] need to talk right do you know who you

[1:51:16] defeating the
[1:51:18] Philistines come and find out how your
[1:51:20] brethren are
[1:51:21] doing Hallelujah and he brings food with
[1:51:24] him
[1:51:27] amen CU his word will meet the
[1:51:30] condition there was trouble in the camp
[1:51:34] but he brings food a young boy comes
[1:51:36] with
[1:51:37] food I love how God does things he's
[1:51:41] going to prove he doesn't need an army
[1:51:42] he doesn't need soldiers he doesn't need
[1:51:44] any of these things but he has seen the
[1:51:46] bully you know when I when I did this at
[1:51:49] church I had a picture of four kind of
[1:51:51] gangster looking guys on the screen you

[1:51:56] through the ages the church ages trying
[1:51:57] to bully this church into
[1:52:00] submission but God sends a man
[1:52:02] Hallelujah God sends a voice amen with
[1:52:06] food and he said at one time in the face
[1:52:09] of a man who knowed god brother brandham

[1:52:13] trained man he knowed nothing about it

[1:52:31] there to find to visit his brothers he
[1:52:33] said you mean to tell
[1:52:35] me that you'll let that uncircumcised
[1:52:38] Philistines stand there and defy the
[1:52:41] armies of the of the Living God saying
[1:52:43] the days of Miracles has passed oh my
[1:52:46] what a man was that was he says the
[1:52:49] least man in the whole bunch just a
[1:52:51] little kid David who was not even part
[1:52:54] of the regular army he was not a soldier
[1:52:56] he was not there he had not gone through
[1:52:58] the training and Maneuvers he did not
[1:53:00] need those
[1:53:03] things you might say brother Chris I
[1:53:05] don't know all the right quotes I don't
[1:53:06] know just what to say I don't know how
[1:53:08] to respond or what to do it doesn't
[1:53:09] matter you have
[1:53:12] God you don't have to understand
[1:53:14] everything just take God
[1:53:18] Amen he says but he know he said one day
[1:53:21] a lion come in and got his got my
[1:53:23] father's sheep and took it out I went
[1:53:25] after him with my little slingshot and I
[1:53:26] brought him back a bear come in and I
[1:53:29] slew the bear he said and the same God
[1:53:31] hallelujah that delivered me from The
[1:53:33] Lion and from the bear will deliver that
[1:53:35] uncircumcised Philistine into my hands
[1:53:38] and stop him if you could oh Saul he
[1:53:42] says they just brought him up before
[1:53:44] Saul the general and Saul said you know
[1:53:47] you know what Saul was going to dress
[1:53:48] him in his
[1:53:51] insecurities that's the robe of Saul at
[1:53:53] this moment amen here you need armor you
[1:53:56] need to protect yourself you need to
[1:53:58] this and and here's a little bit of
[1:53:59] psychology here's a little bit of
[1:54:01] emotions here's a little bit of Feelgood
[1:54:03] and really all these weights that got
[1:54:06] added onto David to the point where he
[1:54:08] says I don't even understand how this
[1:54:10] works it's so complicated oh sometimes
[1:54:14] we can get so complicated we can't even
[1:54:16] move but David recognized his strength
[1:54:19] his power was not in those things our
[1:54:22] strength is not in our security
[1:54:24] insecurities our strength is not in our
[1:54:27] reasonings my brother and sister our
[1:54:28] strength is in the
[1:54:32] word you see what I mean by laying aside
[1:54:35] just stop stop the cycle you know you
[1:54:39] say well I go through this every time
[1:54:41] just you got to break that next time
[1:54:43] that starts just lay it aside just say
[1:54:44] I'm not doing this go the other
[1:54:47] way just throw down Saul's armor amen he
[1:54:52] says now try on my vest he put on that
[1:54:55] great big thing on poor little David was
[1:54:57] bowlegged with it on he come to find out
[1:54:59] that his ecclesiastical vest didn't fit
[1:55:02] a man of God so he said throw the thing
[1:55:04] off I don't know nothing about it I
[1:55:06] don't know nothing about this here all
[1:55:08] this here how you how to say Amen just
[1:55:11] right and how the your word and grammar

[2:00:45] battle you'll never be
[2:00:48] satisfied but I think you know we we've
[2:00:51] come to this place kind of like where
[2:00:52] it's a woke Society it's there's a
[2:00:55] victimized kind of mentality you know
[2:00:57] it's so much so you know you hear the
[2:00:59] news where they say like you know this
[2:01:00] person was was harassed or this person
[2:01:03] was was um molested and so they are this
[2:01:06] victim and then suddenly there's 50
[2:01:08] other people that were molested by the
[2:01:09] same person and then they have to spend
[2:01:11] years in court trying to dissect who was
[2:01:13] actually molested who was not actually
[2:01:15] who's just here trying to get a a free
[2:01:17] handout who's this and but it's this
[2:01:19] Spirit of like oh this is a freebie
[2:01:22] right this is a I I can be a part of
[2:01:24] this group I want to be a part of the
[2:01:25] victim group do you know what I'm saying
[2:01:29] my brother and sister we got to be
[2:01:30] careful with that spirit it's okay to
[2:01:32] recognize that you got hurt and it's
[2:01:34] okay to recognize the enemy it's okay to
[2:01:36] recognize his tactics but when you see
[2:01:38] him take a foot into your door slam the
[2:01:40] door
[2:01:41] shut you're not a victim you're an
[2:01:43] overcomer in Christ and yes he's done
[2:01:46] horrible things he's done crazy things
[2:01:48] to us my brother and sister and we go
[2:01:49] through lonely places but we are more
[2:01:52] than
[2:01:54] Overcomers don't settle for anything
[2:01:56] less hallelujah it's time to lay aside
[2:01:59] the weights in other words lay aside I'm
[2:02:02] a victim lay aside my hurt oh I wasn't
[2:02:05] treated right or I was I was I was not
[2:02:08] justly uh uh treated or maybe unfairly
[2:02:10] treated or maybe a business deal went
[2:02:12] bad or maybe you know it's how many here
[2:02:15] do business with
[2:02:17] Believers right business with Believers
[2:02:19] I love doing business with believers
[2:02:21] they're just they're Fair they're honest
[2:02:24] amen don't let the devil lie to you amen
[2:02:27] if you've had a bad experience that's
[2:02:29] not the truth that's just somebody who
[2:02:31] let the devil in the door amen and had a
[2:02:33] weak moment but we are honest we are
[2:02:37] fair Believers amen you see what I'm
[2:02:39] saying it's a
[2:02:41] mindset how many here believes that we
[2:02:43] are
[2:02:45] divided go read the message on on that
[2:02:48] opinion you know the prophet says that
[2:02:50] we are not divided amen we are one
[2:02:54] body who said we are divided anyhow oh
[2:02:57] but brother Co look at this and
[2:03:01] don't do you see what I'm saying we are
[2:03:03] not divided we got to change the way we
[2:03:06] talk we got to change our confession we
[2:03:09] got to we the devil's been lying to us
[2:03:11] the devil's been trying to subdue us
[2:03:13] when we're supposed to be subduing the
[2:03:15] devil that's right don't let him
[2:03:17] intimidate
[2:03:20] you amen he says when you got the
[2:03:22] message just keep
[2:03:24] going amen you say I can't walk up again

[2:03:37] saying today lay it aside
[2:03:43] yes I've been
[2:03:45] betrayed yeah so was Jesus you're in
[2:03:48] good company by the way CU when you look
[2:03:49] in the scriptures and you see who was
[2:03:51] betrayed
[2:03:52] I would rather be the one being betrayed
[2:03:53] than the one
[2:03:55] betraying so I'm in good company do you
[2:03:57] see what I'm saying find the good in it
[2:03:59] my brother and sister look to God and
[2:04:01] and if you were betrayed it doesn't
[2:04:03] matter he said he would never leave you
[2:04:04] nor forsake you he who is greater who is
[2:04:07] bigger who's your savior who's
[2:04:08] omnipresent omniscient who's a very
[2:04:10] present help in time of need he's

[2:21:23] believe and and they were doing a uh you
[2:21:26] know like a investigation and trying to
[2:21:28] put all the pieces together then they
[2:21:29] were threatened there right and so they
[2:21:32] they moved that whole operation to

[2:35:46] think uh two more well I
[2:35:52] yeah four actually because I want to
[2:35:55] thank Sharon and Emma was Emma working
[2:35:57] in the taking their time in the morning
[2:35:59] and the getting up early and starting
[2:36:01] the coffee machine and doing all
[2:36:05] that and
[2:36:10] um now one of you I've often said one of
[2:36:14] our successes the reasons why we've been
[2:36:17] successful here is because the attitude
[2:36:19] have in our fellowship is we always
[2:36:20] respect the ministry and especially the
[2:36:23] pastor we it's just something we've
[2:36:25] always pushed because there's a blessing
[2:36:28] in that um but I must say brother Ben
[2:36:30] and Sister Christine make that extremely
[2:36:34] easy you know it's like this is not hard
[2:36:37] this why doesn't everyone do it you
[2:36:41] know no um so um let's I see brother EDS
[2:36:45] making his way up here
[2:36:50] I come come up here brother Ben Sister
[2:36:52] Christine they they um it hasn't been an
[2:36:55] easy year for them not going to lie to
[2:36:57] you you know they they it's been it's
[2:37:00] been hard for them they've battled
[2:37:01] through you know we don't see that we
[2:37:03] just we just sort of come here and
[2:37:04] they're praising the Lord and Ben sister
[2:37:06] Christina's you know but they they do go
[2:37:09] through a lot and it's not easy for them
[2:37:13] to come up on the
[2:37:14] stage you know it it isn't easy for them
[2:37:18] and you know the the truth be none they
[2:37:21] probably won't get much recognition to
[2:37:23] the other side of everything you know
[2:37:25] and and not much understanding you know
[2:37:27] of really what they have to go through
[2:37:29] you know that that's just the that's
[2:37:30] just the way that it is sometimes you
[2:37:32] know and and even the Lord has it that
[2:37:33] way he just sort of you know he knows
[2:37:35] hey you can do this just carry on
[2:37:37] through but you know but we in our
[2:37:38] hearts as people we we get a little
[2:37:40] snippet of what they go through and we
[2:37:42] we we just want
[2:37:43] to like we can't sometimes we can't do
[2:37:47] any do anything give them something we
[2:37:49] we try do what we can but you know it's
[2:37:50] just even to just appreciate to know you
[2:37:52] know look we do really love you being
[2:37:55] here and we we really love having a
[2:37:57] pastor and a pastor's wife we just love
[2:37:59] it so much like I was sitting there

[2:38:07] have you anymore I'd be so sad you know

[2:40:10] and and there was it was only a very
[2:40:12] small church maybe eight people or

[2:40:16] had an injury of some sort he was
[2:40:18] limping in and then
[2:40:20] and and Kubin was the song leader that
[2:40:22] day and that's the first day that
[2:40:24] brother Ed and his family turned up to
[2:40:26] experience you know where this this
[2:40:29] church you
[2:40:30] know and he's he's still
