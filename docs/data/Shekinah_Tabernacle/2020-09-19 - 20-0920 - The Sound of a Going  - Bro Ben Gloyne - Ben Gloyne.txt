are happy to be in the service of the lord this morning just organize my team to stand properly here so that all their voices can can just aligned to the mics amen we're going to sing a song the song is based on james chapter 4 verse 10. for the bible readers it it says humble yourself in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up i think that's what i had i picked up this morning amen humbling yourself in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up that's why we are singing this morning and by the way the opposite is also true if you don't humble yourself the lord cannot lift you up he can lift your way down hallelujah sorry i'm just i'm a minister so i tend to i tend to to speak instead of seeing just just give joshua don't try to hold it just to excuse us if we are not so good it's just because we need to make a joyful noise unto the lord to tell the lord that we worship him listening to the children in the classroom you know it's so heart-touching if you listen to them praying praying to god in their own words from their own hearts listening to them carefully you realize that you've got a lot of work to do as parents these children they're waiting on us amen and the prophet says there's no more child delinquency nowadays he says his parental deliverance kids are waiting on us on our fire for their fire to build help us lord [Music] you yourself humble yourself in the sight of the lord you up he shall lift you up if you humble yourself in the sign of the lord he shall lift you up for yourself in the sight of the [Music] if you lord yourself in the sight of the [Music] lord [Music] [Music] is he shall lift you up he shall praise the lord um brother ahmad just as he's getting set up i'm reminded of a story you know a guy thought he knew quite a bit going up to preach so he walked up to the pulpit you know shoulders back ready to deliver what he had and it all didn't work and i guess by the end of the service he was kind of went down a lot more humbler than when he what he was when he walked up you know one of the sisters said if he walked up the way he walked down he would have walked down the way he walked up that's when sound takes sound something will trace hello i'm just waiting for you to one day at the back heavenly armor will into the land the battle belongs to the lord no weapon that's fashioned against us shall stand the battle belongs to the lord [Music] the battle belongs to the lord when the power of darkness [Music] you'll raise up the standard the power of his blood the battle belongs to the lord the battle belongs to the lord i sing glory to the holy one i have fallen in love all over again all over again glory to the holy one [Music] i have fallen in love that delivery i wait for that delivery that delivered [Music] glory to jesus my only one who took my sins away [Music] when he died on that cross all my debt to pay and by his stripes i am here with his holy ghost [Music] and i will see [Music] glory to the holy one i have fallen in love all over again just before we do a few worship songs sister brahman has a testimony that she'd like to share so good morning just wanted to share a testimony that's really special to me um it was actually 10 years ago andy and i just met him and you know heard about the message and everything and i had a dear grandmother who was a very special lady in her 80s she just lived a very simple life and um she she was just a loving person you know like that and we really wanted her to to have a relationship with the lord and we were so much and we'd always go over there tell her about the lord and talk to her and she would say this is lovely this is so good for you and then she'd watch back to coronation street and she said that's nice for you but not for mary her name is mary she said not for mary i went up to the altar when i was five years old and the priest said you're okay now mary and so she said that's it that's all you know and it would so discourage us and we were so zealous and so we knew there was so much more that she could have and it um it stressed us out a bit you know because you so much you're so zealous and you so much want what she could have and um and she had lots of miracles that happened like she had carpal tunnel syndrome the lord supernaturally came she felt his presence wash over her body completely healed her of carpal tunnel lots of things happened supernatural for her yet she just continued on and um and a couple of years went by and we we you know it was it was quite hard for us at that time but um one day she went into hospital and then they said to her just very suddenly you've actually got cancer through your whole body and she was in extreme pain and they said every basically every organ's got some cancer in it and you've only got you know you might not make it through the night type of thing and so um we so much in our hearts burdened for our nana you know praying for her and everything and then i just want to it's helped me to trust the lord so much that he has perfect timing in everything um then she she went um i was working still and she she's one of those people that tough as old boots will hang on and hang on so a few days later she's in this private room they just moved her out into a private room went into the room i just felt so strongly in my heart when i was working go and see your nana and so i went to my workmates and i said i just have to go to my nana and they said i will cover you go i went and i sat down next door and i said nana did you know that there's um because she used to talk to me about the pearly gates and i said this jesus he's going to meet you at the pearly gates and she said yes i will i will talk to him when i get there i said to you know you know we can talk to him make it right she said when i get there then i'll speak to him i said to her why would you wait we can talk to him right now if you like and make things right and she said i would like that and we prayed right there and i said you pray nana because he knows what's in your heart and she just said jesus i'm a little sheep and you're the shepherd here's mary and that was basically her whole prayer and then um the nurse walked in the door right after that with a morphine pump and she put the morphine pump in and that was my nana you know for the next few days it was her consciousness changes you know in her last sort of conscious moments of being there she accepted the lord and um then a few days later she um i would go into the room and just be sitting with her and singing that hallelujah chorus and the presence of the lord was there and i knew the angels were there with us and then um this one day when i went in because it was quite a few days later and then she said can you see this this is wonderful and i said what what nana because we always i've always wondered she hasn't been baptized and she hasn't this she said look around can't you see this can't you hear that i said hear what she said she said there's always people in white all up around the edges she said i can see mary walking she said walking up towards these big this big she said it's like a big church opening she said everybody's in white and she said you won't believe the old church comes it sounds amazing calling me in and um yes so i just when when um when i hear that song about when we gather at the river she used to sing that to me when i was a little girl and i just thought wow it won't be long and we'll we'll meet mary at the river you know [Music] when we gather at the river because i always used to wonder when she used to sing it when we gather at the river you know and i would think i wonder what river she's talking about but it's funny that the lord had all her life she didn't you know um the lord just has perfect timing for everything and we don't have to worry all our worrying and fussing and everything we don't need to worry at all the lord has his children all in his hand he loves them each one and he will gather them all you know we just have to commit them and trust him just walk with him takes off a lot of pressure praise the lord it's good to be a christian and have hope amen let's stand and just sing some worship songs this morning before um brother ben comes up worthy is the [Music] lamb who was slain [Music] holy holy is he

you just want to take your bibles with me we're gonna go to second samuel hey man it's great to see each and every one of you here today amen i mean second samuel and in chapter five we're going to read verses 22 to 25 and then we're going to read matthew 24 verse 36 onward so second samuel five and in verse 22 we're gonna read from there and the philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in the valley of riffian and when david inquired of the lord he said thou shall not go up but feature compass behind them and come upon them over against the mulberry trees and let it be where now here's the sound of a going now i want you to notice a sound of a going so there's a certain time when he's gonna attack at the sound of a going and the tops of the mulberry trees that there now shall bestow thyself and then shall the lord go out before thee to smite the host of the philistines and david did so as the lord had commanded him and smote the philistines from geba uh until they'll come to gazia amen and let's just um actually you can have your seats this morning we're just going to read there but i'm and we'll go into matthew 24 later but i'd like to take this and i think it was something brother um said on that wednesday or um also what brother albert was saying on sunday but i want to take a a a thought and i just pray the lord would just give us courage david would be here and we know he fought many battles he he would go out as a shepherd boy against goliath and we know the result of that battle is goliath was headless and david was victorious and you know he would become king and he would go through many many different battles and he would fight the enemy in different ways and but there came a time where there was a a time when when the lord told him to to come another way but at the sound of a going that's when he needs to strike now we live in a time of going brother brown would say and and and i'll come into it later but he says really the rapture is a secret going it's a secret going it doesn't really say it's a coming it's more of a going than a coming so let's just go to matthew matthew 24 here i just want to read jesus would would speak of a a parable here in matthew 24 we're just going to read from verse 36 to 42. and um you know if there's ever a time for the church the living god to stand on her feet and take the two edges sword of the word and just chop philistine's plum to the walls it's now it's not a time to sit back i believe we're hearing a sound of a going we're we have heard the sound of a going right we're living in this time of the sound of a going you know this message we received is a leaving message right it's not a coming message but it is the coming of the lord don't get me wrong but it's a leaving just like when moses went down you know you know even even the book of exodus that word exodus means a mass departure of people right and that was the first exodus it was a leaving of a people from egypt to go to the promised land and even when when jesus was here john the baptist introduced him it was a leaving i mean not for not for a people to go from one part of the earth to another but to go from under the under the blood of bulls and goats into the baptism of the holy ghost so they actually left one place and went to another place spiritually now we know in this day that there's a people upon the earth and i believe i'm looking at those people right you've got to say i'm ready the lord has made me ready amen his blood has been shed it's more than enough that's more than enough for any situation any trouble any sin any trouble hallelujah i am ready because he has made me ready hallelujah so you know take the word i've heard we've heard the sound of it going this is the season to get every promise this is the season amen for for every divine promise of god to be fulfilled we know the philistines they are always there to rob and to block the visitation of god like the three mighty men david had a desire one day if i could just drink from the well of bethlehem you know because because he remembered what it was like to be a little boy and drink cold water from that well and they just heard you know those mighty men just heard the yearning of the king and and he didn't even command them it was just a small desire in david's heart became a great commandment to them and they chopped their way through who philistines until they got to the well of bethlehem and they got the water and they brought it back to david i mean so it was those philistines were trying to block david getting a cool drink of water and brother ram says oh warrior sons of bethlehem now is the time to draw the two-edged sword chop through all tradition chop through all indifference chop through all unbelief chop through all denominations trees of man i mean let's get our king a fresh drink of pentecostal water and worship hallelujah that's what we're called to do on this day amen we're not called just to go through the motions of having a worship you know you're having a church but to get him a fresh drink a fresh worship hey we're built to do it are we not they were built to chop through those philistines they were actually built they were trained they were ready amen they knew how to kill philistines real good and they killed them that way and they killed them coming back hallelujah and they got him a fresh drink we're built to defeat the devil amen remember it's not you that does it it's the lord in you right but we are built by the baptism of the holy ghost we are built to defeat any devil any place any time anywhere amen now we read here in matthew 24. so that was a we'll probably come back around that way again but you know i just matthew 24 36 but of the day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only but as the days of noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be now notice the condition of this from the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking we all eat and drink marrying wise and given a marriage this is the condition of the world we live in until the day that noah entered into the ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be so notice there was no great pool the ark was built the animals were in noah and his family were in there's no sudden great pull on the earth we've got to get in people were just living life they knew it not until the flood came so they just continued on are you following me there was no pull in the people's hearts so that's why thank god you gotta thank god there's a pull thank god there's a there's a there's a deep calling to the deep hallelujah thank god these kisses he's calling us hallelujah but for the majority of the people in noah's day well everyone bar eight they just lived life they continued on they did all these things and they had no pull to get into the ark that's why i say thank you jesus you put something in me not in here but in here amen too to be drawn to you hallelujah hallelujah they they they had totally passed them by until the flood came and then he says there shall be two in the field one shall be taken and the other left two women shall be grinding at the mill and one shall be taken and the other left what's therefore for you know not what our your lord doth come so there's nothing wrong with working in the field right and we know grinding at the mill we know it used to be traditionally that women would take the grain they'd take it to the mill or get milled they'd take it home and they'd make bread right there's nothing wrong with getting food ready there's nothing wrong with working in the field it says that there'll be two in the bed one will be taken one will be left there's nothing wrong with sleeping but you notice that there's a great event that jesus is speaking of here one is ready the other is unready and as i think brother albert said on sunday they said just be two classes of people the saved and the lost doesn't matter what category have saved when you boil it down they're saved and lost and they'll come down to a day they'll be the taken in the left right we know sure the church is going to go through the tribulation people you know they will get salvation all those things but in reality there'll be the left and the taken both are living in the same world both are doing the same kind of jobs both you know living the same kind of life to a degree but want to be taken the other will be left now does this mean because you know we understand now i don't know exactly how this ties in how brother ram says speaking of matthew 27 how the dead in christ will rise and they'll be with us for 40 days beforehand i don't know how this ties in i believe we'll see them rise don't you because the scripture says they will rise first right but there'll come a time when when we will literally disappear you may be in a meeting at work you know because in a moment in a twinkling of an eye that's real quick and maybe you might be there sitting at your desk and then someone looks and they look again and you're gone and they don't know when do they step up and walk away you may be at school and the teacher goes to call your name out maybe calling the role and they say and then they call your name out and there's no response but but they saw you there before but now they're gone amen well what happened in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we will be changed we will be changed hallelujah so there's now that's what the apostle paul would say in first corinthians 15 behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye the last trump for the trump shall sound and the dead in christ shall raise incorruptible and we shall be changed hallelujah i mean for this corruptable must put on incorruption this mortality must put on immortality i mean so when this couple shall put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality then shall be put brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory hallelujah this scripture must be fulfilled i believe in a literal rapture translation of the church of the bride don't you amen so now but we understand that this will be a secret going right there'll be a moment in the twinkling of an eye the bride will be gone and the world will continue on just like in the days of noah they all got in the ark but everyone else just continued on maybe they saw the animals migrate i don't know how it worked it would have taken a long time for some animals to get to the ark maybe generations back they started migrating but eventually they got there hallelujah wouldn't that be an odd site you see some i don't know something from the other side of the world come here maybe just a land base like a little tortoise starting you know great great great granddad and grandma start walking but eventually they got there and maybe some people say oh that's interesting oh there must be climate change that's why they're migrating in this odd kind of way i don't know maybe something like this but they just saw isn't that odd and they continued on but for the bride of christ there's something he's put within us and i i don't think we can put enough value in the seat of predestination just to have a longing in your soul for him your blessed people hallelujah so it will be a secret catching away now we understand that this will not be the coming of the lord as in revelations one which says every eye shall see him when he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also who put pierced him and all the kindreds of the earth shall well because of him it's not that is that is after the rapture has happened right but this one is a secret catching away now the question is will this pass us by because maybe no doubt maybe a bit oh i pray not but a fear come into your heart oh if it's a secret one will i will i be ready i say if you know him amen you are ready let's go to first thessalonians chapter four i just wanna you know read this down and and and i have a purpose for saying all this we're going to get into the to the meat of it later but um because often we'll read the you know we'll we'll we'll go into first thessalonians chapter 4 and we will no doubt begin to read from verse verse 13 and and and we'll start from there he says but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and we've heard the shout have we not the message brother brahm says very clearly the message is the shout out hallelujah amen so i've heard the shout i mean with the voice of the archangel the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words and many times we see the full stop and we stop reading but we must understand that the chapter and verses were put in later paul didn't put the chapter in verse and when he wrote this to the thessalonians someone did it later so if you if we keep reading we read uh chapter five and verse one but what's a but it's a conjunction tying what we just read to what we're about to read it says blood of the times and seasons brethren ye have no need that i write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night so when they shall say peace and safety and what are we beginning to hear peace and safety amen then sudden destruction cometh upon them is travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but ye brethren are not in darkness who's in light today amen arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the lord risen upon you hallelujah to me that's more than uh yeah it's more i mean scripture is more than a scripture you understand but it's a reality that's more than a nice instagram post more than just a nice idea that's a reality i mean when this message came your way light came hallelujah and what did the lord tell you arise and shine i mean now is the time to arise why the sound of it going has come amen hallelujah amen ye are the children of the light and the children of the day we are not the of the night nor of darkness let us let therefore because of this therefore means let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they which sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunk and are drunken in the night but let us of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love for and helmet the hope of salvation and we know the word hope in the bible is an expectation usually with pleasure is the meaning i mean says expectation of salvation for god hath not appointed us to wrath i like that don't you but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we shall live together with him wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also you do so he says this day won't overtake a people there is a people upon the earth this day will not pass them by like in the days of noah it will not just come and go and it was done but there's a people on the earth that will see it they'll become one with it and they'll be changed hallelujah they'll be changed by the power of god amen so now now you say well are you just sitting back and and waiting for your change to come yes and no no because i mean yes rather because i'm resting in the lord if you've received the holy ghost you've entered into rest but it's definitely a no because now is the time to fight right just like israel was instructed by god basically you go take the land i'll give it to you you're not going to take it but you're going to turn up you've got to get on the armor you've got to sharpen your sword you've got to turn up to the battle aliyah so so they didn't just sit in their camp in the wilderness or just over jordan they had to physically turn up to the battle and then god fought their battles sure they had to swing a sword a few times but it was an anointed swing i mean they had to hold up their shield a couple of times was an anointed holding of a shield highly assured they had to take some cities but it was anointed hallelujah was god fighting through them and it's the same thing with you and i now is the time i mean to stand up take god in his word like never before hallelujah and turn up to the battle well how do i turn up to the battle have a time of prayer battle's one in prayer oh read the word hallelujah be a witness amen this is how we should be why but but so so why is this because we have heard the sound of a going just like david was told wait here until you hear the sound of a going and then when you hear that sound rise up and fight hallelujah don't you agree we've heard the sound of a going this message is a leaving message it's the third exodus message from this world to the next world this is where it's going to take us hallelujah so now if we've heard the sound of a going hallelujah we've been called right we've been anointed have we not amen we've been sanctified we've been glorified amen well we shall be glorified right and the scripture says he that's called he's been sanctified and he has already been glorified we just got to catch up to that reality amen how's that going to happen the change of the body amen but so david had to wait for a season and then when he heard that sound he was up hallelujah remember he knew he knew it could be done because he's seen victory before he saw goliath go down he prophesied of his demise i'm going to cut your head off didn't have a sword but he used a glass own sword he'd seen the philistines be defeated before but he had to wait for this time so he knew it could be done just like the bride of christ we know it can be done we've seen a prophet we've seen god show the power of the cross in its fullness where no spirit could stand before him unbelief didn't stop him hallelujah he could speak things out of um out of existence into existence that was the power of the blood was demonstrated in a one-man ministry but now god wants to demonstrate that same power in a multi-membered body hallelujah so we know it can be done and not just back in 1965 but today i mean we've seen it be done but now is the time of the killing now is the time of total victory you may think i'm way up on a limb but this is where we are friends i mean i believe that we have heard a sound of a going now is the time to take the word like never before and oppress the battle hallelujah he would say in israel in the church part three this is in 1953 and brethren where all christendom is looking for the coming of the lord and the rapture of the church all that's got any knowledge of the word well if we can't have faith enough for divine healing how are we going to have a rapturing faith oh i believe there's a great coming forth remember because i didn't teach in divine healing before i believe as david said he laid there and waited until he listened and waited after a while he heard the rushing sound going through the mulberry trees going around he know god was going before him oh brother i'm listening for the rushing of the leaves the sound uh the noise of the mulberry bushes gods going before the battle then let's rise and put on the full armor of god pull the sword go after it the battle belongs to us then when we see the hand of god moving on through signs and wonders let's start following on and we've seen god in signs and wonders so let's start following on hallelujah amen he'd say this in the contest and this is why i actually had this plate on wednesday i feel tonight as we're listening for them whistles something like david did that dreadful hot night when he laid out there under their mulberry bushes and the enemy was around thing what an hour it must have been for david what a time for him laying there he didn't know how to move he didn't know what to go by because he knowed he was outnumbered but all at once he heard the sound of a wind going through the top of the bushes he knowed god went on before him he went fought he went to the battle i feel something like that tonight after last night's message i'm laying in the darkest hour i've ever faced in my life i feel like isaiah at the temple seeing those angels i'm a man of unclean lips dwelling among people with unclean lips but listen i've got to meet it some way and the only thing i'm waiting to hear that rushing through the mulberry bushes to go and meet the enemy wherever it is god help us to do it i believe we're living in this time now you think when the spirit of god moves the devil's always there to block it the devil doesn't like to see god moving to people he's forwarded it all the way from eden all the way down here and he's not going to stop fighting it until he's cast the lake of fire but we must understand that we face a defeated being remember we face a defeated being my lord jesus defeated him on calvary he went down to hell took the keys off of satan of hell death in the grave and rose triumphant and he's still triumphant today he's still the same powerful god he is what then he is now amen we don't have to fear nothing member of our god if god is for us who can be against us right if he is for me who can be against me sure we have my you know i've got failures and weaknesses and humanity whatever more but if he is for me what can be against me hallelujah i believe the apostle paul had experience when he wrote that he had opposition he had religious spirits come against him he had he had unbelief he had all kinds of things but he could stand and say if god is for us who can be against us amen if the first church came in that way the last church would go out the same way hallelujah why because we've heard a sound of a going on now as i said when the spirit of god blows into a place the devil is there to stop the visitation now when moses was sent down to egypt here he was he knew that he was born for the job but in his own humanity all he could muster up was one dead egyptian and so he went on to the back side of the desert because really they had to come the right time he thought it was the right time but god had his own time and so finally he was there 80 years old leading his father-in-law sheep on the back side of the desert and then the lord came hallelujah into that burning as a burning bush and spoke to moses he said i've heard the cries of my people i've come down to deliver them so he's basically saying i'm coming to take them out of here but i'm sending you to do the job amen and now the first thing that moses was given now is is that shepherd stuff that he held which was just a dead stick until it came into the prince of god god told him now throw it down and it turned into a serpent hallelujah and then so and so he ran away from it was scared but then god told him to pick it up by the tail it became that same rod and then he was also told put your hand into your bosom and be leprous bring it out amen it's a showing now we know leprosy is a type of sin saying saying that you will have power actually take sin to your bosom remember he's a four forerunner of jesus christ the shout out of jesus christ you'll be able to like sit into your bosom and bring it out it'll be gone amen but he had that power remember god gives signs in certain ways to prove to the devil you're not the boss here boy you're not in charge here you think you are but you are not the head manager of this place i'm in charge now we know he was given that rod in that way because remember pharaoh was considered a god in egypt he wasn't just an elected official no he actually believed and it was projected to the population this is your god made flesh is fairer and we know on his on his crown there was there was there was a cobra there was the king of the serpents and then so now when moses went down into egypt and and he said let my people go and god was speaking through a man amen two two two pharaoh then then he says well who is this jehovah and then moses tells aaron i think it was just a throw down the rod and it turned into a serpent and then pharaoh wasn't too impressed by that he got his magicians to do the same thing but then the amazing thing is that that moses rod ate their rods and then after it was picked up as a rod again where did they go they didn't get their sticks back because they got eaten so their their demon power their power was swallowed up by the power of god and also god was telling moses actually you have the power to lose pharaoh that he becomes a serpent or to bind them you have the power in your hand to loose them or to bind them whatever pleases you you can lose them you combine them and he was also showing the devil devil my servant who's been commissioned by me to bring my people out can loose you or let you go can bind you or loose you or bind you whenever it pleases him he can he'll bind you or loose you hallelujah now we know he did that he brought the people out a one-man invasion eighty-year-old man two youngins on his wife's hip on the back of a mule going down into egypt you know you know comes to the customs gate there and going down to gaza wherever it is what's your purpose of visit can't tick holiday can't take business yo other invasion gives it to the gives it to the customs guy maybe just stamped it have a nice day okay when's your departure date uh soon as possible yeah do you have a return ticket no but i'll you'll see me soon hallelujah but the thing is he did it he did it one man went into the superpower of the world and took out hallelujah nothing could stop israel leaving because there was a man that was anointed commissioned sent hallelujah with the power of deliverance into a country to bring out them hallelujah bring israel out now remember that was just from a natural deliverance remember that was just from a natural bondage into a natural freedom but we know that as i said that the so-so he was a serpent bruiser right he was a serpent bruiser no doubt the reason that pharaoh would have you know um uh pharaoh would be inspired to throw all the little israeli boys into the nile is because because the devil was afraid that that seat of the woman was going to come into that kingdom and crush the head of the seat of the serpent he was afraid and that's why he tried to get rid of the serpent bruiser but it's amazing how god could orchestrate things he he actually had that serpent bruiser raised up in the palace of pharaoh he was on the outskirts of the place he was in the inner sanctuary of the serpent himself and he was raised that way hallelujah he was protected he was nourished but his whole purpose of his life was to tear that kingdom down hallelujah and you may have been raised in this world hallelujah rise under satan's kingdom under his power amen but you're here i mean to tear satan's kingdom down now i'm not talking about tearing down bricks and mortar and government i'm talking about demon powers in the hearts of men and women tearing that kingdom down this is why we are here today hallelujah amen so jesus we know was that as as moses was a shadow of jesus now jesus was that serpent bruiser hallelujah because he didn't just deliver a people from a natural slavery oh hallelujah buddy buddy he broke the power of hell brother abraham said that the devil after calvary is like a dog with an animal with a broken back hallelujah why because his power was defeated there and his power is still defeated today hallelujah he didn't just naturally deliver us but he delivered us from unbelief from the power of hell hallelujah i'd love to read ephesians chapter two where once we you had the quickened who was dead and trespassed and sins who used to walk according to the spirit of this world the prince of the power of the air hallelujah but now you've been made alive and i can read that and say lord you've done that for me i once walked according to the spirit of this world but lord you did something to me one day you changed my nature now i walk according to your anointing amen hallelujah so moses now went down into egypt if the egyptians could have just got that rod out of his hand he would have been powerless brother i was saying israel the church he says and god said speak to the rock or bring forth its waters and when he spoke to the rock now he took first and smoked that rock with a rod and when he smote that rock that rod was god's judgment rod it wasn't a rod of moses god had moses in his hand and what that rod was in moses hand is jesus name in the church today that's right that's the truth brother if those egyptians could have ever got that rod out of his hand he was powerless if they can ever take the name of jesus away from the church and get you away you'll go out and bless fema to make fun of it and everything else and try to come in and pray in it you can't do that got to keep it sacred that's right oh take the name of jesus with you child of sorrow and of woe when temptations round you gather breathe that holy name and prayer devils will scatter like roaches on a floor when a light's turned on truly hallelujah sorry so if they could just get that rod out of moses hand he would have been just like any other 80 year old man but that rod was a rod of judgment for for the egyptians but a lot of deliverance for israel hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and i the name of jesus christ there's power in that name where the bride knows the power of that name amen there's power in that name to forgive sin right there's power in that name to cast out the devil there's a power of that name to heal all sickness there's that power in that name to change the body of the people i mean to take us in a rapture i mean there's power in that name to overcome every situation highly so if that name is in our not just in our hand but in our mouth hallelujah i mean there's nothing that will stand before us though everything will try and stand before us are you following me this morning now so we if moses met the burning bush he met the pillow fire in the burning bush he was commissioned go down and deliver my people hallelujah we have received that same kind of commission amen we've received that same kind of commission amen who's met the holy ghost who's met the pillar of fire on this day highly so you don't just meet him for now you can stand back and say well i met god one day no he commissions you to do a job and he anoints you to do the job i remember it wasn't moses natural strength that got the people out of egypt it was god's power in his life that caused the deliverance and it's the same thing with you and i it's not our natural ability it's not how smart we are how charismatic we may be however gifted whatever whatever that stuff is it's not that it's the anointing of the word in our lives amen will bring the deliverance so now if you just think about this moses went into the throne room of the of of pharaoh himself told him let my people go he wasn't bashful about it he didn't compromise about it we're not going to leave one hoof behind the devil your pharaoh tried to negotiate well you can just have this and then you stay here these ones stay here and you take this and you know but he was like no no no no this is not how this works you well i've not come to negotiate i'm here to take what is mine and take it out of here and it should be the same thing with you and i we're not here to negotiate with the devil we're not here to put up with his nonsense and give a little bit of a room no no we've come to take everything that is ours hallelujah we've come all of our children all of our loved ones all of our friends whoever it may be that the lord needs you to pray for hollywood they are the reason he puts them on your heart is because god wants you to say god wants to use your life to get them out oh what if they're not meant to be there listen we got to get this out of our mind or maybe they're just not bright forget about it forget about categories of salvation if they meet god hallelujah sure they might not call to but you know to receive the message don't throw them away hallelujah hey if i can help someone just come one step up the ladder praise god they may not come up all the way that's fine but if they come up just one step if we can be a be such a witness to people that they just take one step closer to god i think well praise the lord that was a that was worth it so don't worry about in and out category whatever god will sort the category he's the category sorter harley he's the one who's don't worry about that kind of thing just say you know we should never ever get in our mind that person serpent seed or whatever let's just let's just kick that out the door oh but they never really responded there's nothing in them the apostle paul before he became paul he was quite a character he was a dedicated destroyer of christians he wasn't a part-time just a angry comment here and there his whole energies his whole energies was i'm going to destroy this thing i'm going to stop it spreading us like a cancer and if we looked at saul before it became paul oh boy this guy he's blasphemed he's crossed the line he's done he's gone too far but god said oh no no no no i'm gonna show you you can't put me in a box of who i can save i'm gonna take someone outside that parameter and bring them in and not just that but they're gonna be my prophet messenger for this age hallelujah so we can never just say well uh let's just you know never put a full stop remember god has the last say hallelujah so moses was commissioned to go right into the face of pharaoh and say let my people go now as i said we're not here to deliver people from physical slavery and take them to another piece of real estate that's not our deliverance our deliverance is that the satan would be dethroned from their lives and they would come and meet the lord right that is that is the deliverance we want from unbelief to faith hallelujah this is what we want to see so we have a right you think about it moses was commissioned go and tell pharaoh let my people go that's very elementary no it's very powerful he went in there and he got what was his right we have the right to go before satan let my people go [Applause] let them go let my boy go let my girl go let my brothers go let my sisters go let this one go let them go remember i think i think brother-in-law brought the quote up from them i can't remember what sermon it is but we our total deliverance we can pray in such a way till the devil has to give him till he has to give him amen hallelujah you know the you know the disciples were having a prayer meeting one of them was in the inner prison he was under a death sentence hallelujah herod wanted peter's head to be taken from his shoulders amen did they just say well i guess that's just how it has to be well i guess this is just the natural course of life you know the there's no no no they prayed they prayed and when they could not physically go into the prison god sent his angel down into the prison and brought him out of the prison hell is the same thing with you and i you may physically not be able to reach someone but god can reach them and he's the one we want to reach them anyway hallelujah i believe we can pray in such a way till the devil has to give him i believe we have it hey if moses could go before pharaoh negotiations took place and now i'm just going to plague you i'm going to plague your kingdom until you'll be happy i'm gone hallelujah and they were happy that night of the exodus when their firstborn were dead they were weeping for their firstborn the angel of death had come through the land hallelujah they gave their gold and their silver and all their precious things to the to to to israel get out of here leave go and they breathe the sigh of relief i'm so glad those people have gone you know i pray when there's when that moment happens and we're changed that the devil would say i'm go i'm so glad that brother's god i'm so glad that sister's gone i'm so glad that church is no longer here i've i can breathe a sigh of relief you know how many beatings i took when i tried to come against those people i came this way and he beat me down i came this way she beat me down i've just been under their feet and finally oh i can breathe a sigh of relief why because they've left i pray that that is that's our testimony down in hell doesn't matter how small we are how big we are how long we've been in the faith i pray the devil quivers when your alarm goes and you kind of get the matter out of your eye and you know i think it's before 40 you start doing weight lifting when you stand up and you know and there's whatever pulled stuff and you know you pull muscles just by waking up in the morning and you know but the devil is like panic stations in hell what's going to happen today what's going to happen and he tries to sit you know he tries to send one to you go deal with someone no no i'm not going there today i'm still recovering from the last beating i got from that one and try seeing another one no i'm not going there they have a squabble who's going to try and take you out hallelujah i pray that's how it is amen because we're a generation of serpent bruisers i'm talking about the devil that serpent i mean we have power brother ram says you know he was he saw the vision of the mamba and he was told you've got to be more sincere to do this it's his attitude with the word remember that power didn't just lay with the prophet that was demonstrated to show an end time people after the prophet had gone off the scene you have been given power to bind the devil and all the devils under him you can bind them you can loose them you can bind them you can loose them oh my yeah and brother just said lord forgive me in my own sincerity help me to be more sincere i believe the lord will give it to us it's not us trying to be more sincere in our humanity you know it's when the lord moves on our hearts remember he's the one that makes us humble he's the one that makes us sincere and i love it when we just put a foot out of joint he just brings us back he may tear stripes off our hide give us a big box slow but hey it's good hallelujah but we have the power you know think about that the lord has given us the authority over the devil remember the devil all he is is a fired servant angels were never part of the family of god they were created as servants right now when you hire someone if they go beyond their job description in a bad way they get fired and the devil went beyond his job description he had a job in heaven right he was to lead the worship to all those kinds of things but he went beyond his job description saying i can build a better kingdom and what happened he got fired so now this one that we are fighting remember servants can never become the family of the king his life is not in a servant right it's like my children are mine they're part of me i could hire someone to do something but they will never become my family because my blood is not in their veins my blood is in my children's veins only because they're part of me hallelujah same thing with you and i amen with the lord jesus hallelujah amen his royal blood now flows through our veins amen there's a seed of predestination on the inside of the inside of us and that was his own life amen amen you know i love it where where where where the name of jesus is first spoken by by gabriel he says you shall call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins he's going to find his people amen and they are relatives they're he's our close kinsmen hey man we're family harley we have a family gathering you know a lot of people cringe with family reunions i love this kind of family reunion hallelujah i get to see uncle shawn so auntie sanzo brother sanzo says yo it's great hallelujah it's not a cringe oh yeah that's wonderful because it's family hallelujah so an angel can never come a servant can never come as high as the family of the king because they're servants so now the devil was a servant but he got fired and now this fired servant expects us to bow down to him but he's got the hierarchy all wrong remember it's the king and his family then the servants it's not the servants then the king and his family that is not how it works it's the king and his family hello brian and you just think about it more a husband and a wife are one not children they are one join heirs with christ has we're not under the king he's lifted us up to be joint heirs with him isn't that wonderful hallelujah it's us and the lord co-equal because he lifted us up to where he is and then there's the servants underneath and then there's the fire servants under that and so the devil being a fired servant and and all of his are you following me we gotta we gotta really think who are we fighting we're fighting a guy who got fired and and and somehow he had a you know obviously that he had a team building exercise and all it was is to gather people to his own self they got fired too you listen to the wrong boss he got fired so he got fired so now there's these people who got devils who got fired and they think that we have to serve them that picture is all wrong but god said we'll be the head and not the tail holy we will be the head and not the tail we will not be under the devil's feet but the devil's ordained position is under the feet of the bride of jesus christ that's his god-given position god has given us a different position it's not under the devil's feet amen is to be joint is with christ in god hallelujah so the devil comes your way and tries to get you to do all kinds of things hold on hold on you have to obey me i don't have to obey you hallelujah and he looks at you says no no i'm going to get you to do what you used to do but something happened to you remember once upon a time when the enemy came up to eat up my flesh psalms 27 i you know it says when the enemy came against me to earn my flesh they stumbled and fell but there came a time before that when the enemy came up against me i stumbled and fell hallelujah there was a change there was a change of who was actually in charge now it's the law that's in charge i mean so when the enemy comes against the bride he stumbles and falls hallelujah so if that is the case now we have the right by the name of jesus christ to tell the devil you've got to take your filthy hands off god's property how many times did the prophet address satan and say take your hands off god's property hallelujah he said i don't know if they're one of his forget that kind of reasoning remember when moses went down into egypt there are all kinds of israelis there there are the strong they're the weak the old the young he didn't have a guest list he just said if you're a son of abraham come hallelujah so he wasn't weeding out anyone he just said if you want to come you come and a mixed multitude went with them so whosoever will let them come you can do that with what you want to but you know don't put anyone in a box and don't put god in a box amen in the prince of god unrecognized he says you know there's so many people disappear every day off the face of the earth that nobody can account for one of these days it might be that people might say well you mean the tribulation the thing that's on us now i thought the church was to go before the tribulation they don't realize that and understand that the rapture could take place and they would know nothing about it it's the secret going of the church hallelujah he says this isn't calling jesus on the scene in 1964 market in your book i'm an old man but just mark it in your book and see if it comes to pass or not see we're at the end now when i don't know i'm looking for him today if he isn't here today i'm looking for him tomorrow if he isn't here tomorrow i'll be looking the next day amen if he isn't here this year i'll be looking for him next year i know he is coming i don't know the minute or the hour but i know everything is fulfilled ready for the rapture the church is called out it's a secret going just vanish and that'll be all he says hallelujah now i'll just i'm just going to wrap this up the devil has come has not cometh not but for to steal to kill and to destroy right jesus says i have come that they might have life and they might have it more abundantly the enemy the philistines the philistines are nothing but robbers he says in witnesses in 1954 that's the way it is every time god get a good meeting started somewhere here some old hypocrite will come in and say the days of miracles has passed might as well stop this that's the devil that's right about time you get the church going good somebody's slipping saying now that's just all enthusiasm has just worked up that's fanaticism that's the way they do it same old robbers old philistines coming right back he says that's exactly right we must never let that kind of spirit come in our midst amen amen we must never ever just settle back and just let the devil will us and say no no that's not for you that promise is not for you god doesn't move like you here on the tapes he doesn't do that no more you know you can't get the holy ghost like that no more oh what they had in the book of acts then you can never obtain that you know oh we're going to come to it someday sure we are you know way off you know maybe in 10 years you know the bride's still immature and you know hold on don't listen to that lie i guess your family will never come in hold on who said that who said that that's a philistine trying to rob you of a promise oh you'll never recover from that sickness hold on well i guess you've got to keep that temper because that's what you were born with hold on who said that kind of thing that is a philistine robber trying to block you from the blessing of god amen but there's got to be a time you say well is it really the sound of a going absolutely everything is in order even the church world nowadays i don't think they're even looking for a rapture they're looking for trump to win an election they've got their anointed superman brother ram said everyone's looking for a super anointed yo superman russia's got his you know got theirs america's the church world in america has their anointed man he's president so they have taken a fallen man who they claim is born again and they are putting all their hopes in him why is that because there they have taken their focus off the only one that can really help them which is the lord jesus christ and they're fallen down from the spirit of god moving like it used to and they're trying to jack up some political racket amen that they can somehow christianize america once again by some political process they have their anointed man but the bride has her anointed man too hell there's not a natural man upon the earth is the man christ jesus that is our anointed superman hallelujah that is the one that we have crowned kings in our lives i sure will crown him king of king and lord of lords one day but right now we have the opportunity to crown him king of our lives hallelujah and we know he's coming into power hallelujah holy we know he's coming into power so let's be like mo uh a david's mighty man we know he's coming into power the philistines of garrison sure they have they are ordained to do it this scientific age that takes faith away from people and you know just explains the bible away explains the message away you know just tries to make it some form of religion we're going to chop through that we're going to chop through that holy everyone must have their own revival everyone must have their reality of the word and their own lives not just the older ones the younger ones and not just the younger ones but the older ones hallelujah so i say let's take that two-edged sword chop through every every discouragement every bad memory every negative thought all trouble let's chop through it all and get our king of fresh during a pentecostal war hallelujah we are ordained and maybe if i just repeat this for the next hour i proud sink in just like moses went into egypt he got his people out he knew what his job was i think god helped me i just float around but he was focused i have one job this is my job his whole life was now his energies were put behind that job may we be like the same may we be the same don't worry about what's going on in the world it will go on if you read it or not it will continue on we have one job hallelujah we have one job and as moses went in and got his people out we can tell the devil let them go we have the we have the ability to do it amen we can we can go into his face say satan you give them up in the name of jesus christ if he's taken your joy go get it back if he's taken your peace go get it back if he's taken your victory go get it back if he's taking your piece of mind go get it back remember the philosophy just come and rob remember shamgar came to a day he got sick of it there was a harvest season where he got sick of it year after year they'd come in and stomp in and they would say shamgar looked like you did a real good crop this year you know and and he would see his family slowly whittling away and see you know and then finally thought maybe this this harvest we can keep it but then he heard the stomp stomp stomp of the soldiers coming up the road and they thought well we'll just do like we did before you know it's funny the devil is a as a person he he he's just rinse and repeat we'll do it again we'll do it again we'll do it it will come beat them this way again but then something happened in shamgar brother ram said he saw the condition of his family and his wife and something rose up in him it didn't change who he was he just recognized who he was he recognized that he was a circumcised son of abraham living in his promised land hallelujah he was like that every harvest time before he was like that from his birth but he recognized something i am a son of abraham god has given us this land hallelujah that same god that was with moses and joshua that gave us the land is the same god today it doesn't matter what the philistines do to everyone else it stops right here this devil's stopping right here he's not going any further this is the last time these these devils walk into my house and he took his ox code he took he took what he had he said well i don't have the faith to do it he took an ox code david took a shepherd sling hallelujah he just took what he had he and he ran out there maybe they just laughed at him so who's this sham guy's lost his mind what a stupid fool he is no he wasn't a stupid fool he knew who he was he killed one then two and three then maybe they start to pick up their weapons didn't stop him four five six seven everyone all of you are going down hallelujah there you go finally 100 uh uh 598 599 600. and he didn't stop until they were all dead we have listen there's an anointing in this place and it doesn't just stand these four walls i trust it goes home with you i mean we're going to rouse ourselves remember we've heard the sound of it going we heard the sound of a government we're not here just to sit back and wait for our bodies to be changed now is the time to fight now is the time to draw the sword hallelujah the sword of the word and chop through every devil amen now is the season i may tear you into but it'll be worth it things that we carry in our very much always preach to myself every sunday but you'll be things we carry and things we don't understand about ourselves sometimes it's going to literally just rip us into but it's worth it because when you realize when god takes something from you realize that was never part of me anyway hallelujah that was never mine you know we take ownership of too much rich and increase with goods you know i'm not talking about material things either that's my well that's my impatience i'm just a certain age i can't handle noise too much anymore and you know this i just need some peace and quiet i'm talking about myself now welcome i'll just um yeah anyway you know there's these things but hold on hold on why would we let those little things rob us of enjoying our families amen you know i think as steve brisson said you know they're young you want to try and quiet them down all the time when they're teenagers you want to say why aren't they why aren't they doing anything why could well you spent years quieting them down that's right you know but now what you've so so the devil's coming and he's actually allowed you used you to beat them down that when you want them to rise up they're beaten down i say lord jesus help us that we don't beat them down we just lift them up i just oh boy you know what love if all of our children they just they just join rankers hallelujah they just joined ranks they took this word doesn't matter boy girl whatever they took this word and they start chopping philistines with us too hallelujah and they're the ones that drive the service i mean they're the ones that drive the music drive the prayer meetings oh they drive the bible study they're the one driving where's the whole we just can't keep up with this that's that's my prayer this is not an h thing anymore hallelujah this is not you're going to be a certain age you're going to do this no no hold on if if samuel could be a certain age and god could speak to him and change the whole course of israel how much more you and i how much more us now man because we can't just go on year by year i'm looking forward to easter and maybe camping special meetings and stuff there will come a time when they'll be the last time hallelujah they'll be the last time so we can't just expect the same old thing why don't we just have a greater expectation i've heard the sound of it going i'm just going to quit i've heard the sound of it going let's take this you know brother ram says one of you start testifying in the family singing doing something next thing you know you'll be cutting philistines plum to the walls hallelujah i mean they'll be joining their house again there'll be peace in their house again there'll be a drill rejoicing in a love and how there'll be a different kind of a house different kind of an atmosphere hallelujah oh that's just a pie in the sky pipe dream no no no no you know we can we can have our house in such a way it's like stepping into eden don't you believe that you have the noise and the rubbish of the day you open your front door hallelujah it doesn't matter what's going on upstairs one can be tearing the other one apart hallelujah home you know you settle them down whatever more but there's just there's nothing like home there's nothing like home why is that home special there's a life in that home there's a life worth living for there's a life worth dying for hallelujah and god comes in that home it's not the same atmosphere as in the world it's special that's worth fighting for that's worth cultivating you say well we've had great times at home before it can get greater amen i've never ever seen a plateau with god i've never seen this like a you know you like you go through something go on a tour you go you're on holiday there's a possible possibility you can go to every country of the world you can see everything and then you come to your last maybe scott base in antarctica i don't know you've seen your last penguin you've come to the end you've actually experienced everything you can in this natural world that's not like god it's not like god there's no plateau brotherhood said it's like imagine a little fish about yay big in the middle of the pacific saying i better drink sparingly because i might drown the whole ocean or a little mouse in in in the great granaries of egypt during joseph's time i better have a grain a day otherwise i'm gonna eat the whole thing oh boy oh no it's not that way we cannot exhaust god's goodness there is always more we can receive amen i've got it pretty good you can have it better remember shambhala killed every single philistine amen maybe at first when there's 600 it looked like a overwhelming odds but he didn't stop until every one of those devils was dead how about you and i i hear the sound of it going let's not sit back and wait for a body change let's press the battle the lord is here to do something maybe i'm just talking about myself but the lord is here to do something this is the time you say well i've been looking for rapture for about 50 odd years but there'll come a day we are 50 years closer and it could be right now the whole world is looking at all other things in an hour you think not when brother brown was here there was a great big pull and draw all the coming of the lord is coming nigh but it couldn't have been then because everyone was expecting it but nowadays no one's expecting it but there's a little woman upon the earth and i trust that's in your heart lord if you don't come today you'll come tomorrow and if you don't come tomorrow you'll come next week if you don't come next week you'll come next year but i am watching and waiting for that glam millennial day it is not something i've been taught only but it's something in my heart lord i'm watching remember there'll be two in the field one will be taken two and the bed will be taken so you'll be asleep even if you're asleep you'll be there before you know it hallelujah you'll be working you'll be taking you know brother brown was taken beyond the curtain of time he didn't even realize where he was at first he was there before he realized he was there it'll be the same same thing with you and i will be there before we realize we're there but while we're waiting for that moment let's press the battle amen god bless you friends we have the musicians please [Applause] hallelujah hey man i want to i was real blessed by that brother armand when you open with that uh song
