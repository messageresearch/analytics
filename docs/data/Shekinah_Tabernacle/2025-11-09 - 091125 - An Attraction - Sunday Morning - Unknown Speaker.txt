Just as you're standing, thank you musicians. Let's go to um John 10 verse 28. Used to be that you'd hear hear the rustle of um rice paper, which is the thin um pages of the Bible, but these days you can't quite hear a scroll, can you? People tapping on their screen to get to the scripture. Who still uses who use us? Who uses paper? And who uses modern currency? John 10:28 says, "And I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My father which gave them me is greater than all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand." May God bless his word. You can have your seats this morning. So when I was at the camp on Sunday, I sort of let out that I was heading up to Oakland on the Monday. I had to be there Tuesday, Wednesday for something. And I mentioned to one of the brothers up there that um I was going to be up there for the for the week. And I really wanted to get to brother um Freddy's church RFBF because I'd never actually set foot in their fellowship in forever. I think they've been there maybe 10 11 12 13 14 years or 20 years or a long time but I've never set foot in there. So this was my chance and then um they sort of got wind of that and then they asked me to speak and when when he asked me to speak something said to me to say yes. So I said yes, but I didn't really have much time to prepare. Then I got this little thought that that came on as soon as I had the I the as soon as I was asked to go up there and the thought was an attraction. But this was like a Sunday and I had to still do the Sunday night services and they go till quite late then the Monday then drive to Oakland and work for a couple of days and I realized I had no time to to speak to get anything ready. So, I kind of pulled out an old sermon that I had sitting in in in my computer for that one. But I want I want to speak on the thought an attraction um this morning. So, this is a this is a thought called an attraction. I'm I'm going to teach for a bit, then I want to preach for a bit. Okay? And maybe I won't go the typical way that you go when you hear about a word called an attraction. Um, but I'm going to go somewhere with it. Who's ever had an attraction? &gt;&gt; You got an I can feel a strong attraction from you to me, brother. It's the love of God. &gt;&gt; No doubt in your life you felt attraction somewhere. You brothers, young brothers have seen a car and you've been attracted to it. Or if you've been to a young people have been to a youth camp and been attracted to somebody at a youth camp was no one laughed but everyone knows that's why young people go to youth camps. [laughter] No, they go there for the Lord. But so I want to talk to you about this thought called an attraction. There was a man called Isaac Newton. And he was a scientist, Christian scientist. I think it was in the 1700s. And one day he was sitting under a tree. And no doubt he would be pondering scientific things, but also spiritual things because he was trying to see how it all related. And and and because he was a Christian, he was trying to find God and everything, too. I believe that they they when you base your thoughts on the wisdom of God then science m makes a lot more sense and then an apple fell to the ground. I think the story was embellished as it was told later on that said it fell on his head but I but the people don't believe it fell on his head but have you heard that it fell on his head or fell on the ground? &gt;&gt; Head. Yeah. I think that was made up you know [laughter] but as they say you don't let the truth get in the way of a good story. So this apple fell down and he wondered why did this apple fall to the ground? Why didn't it fall that way? Why didn't it fall up? Why didn't it fall that way? Why did it fall straight down to the ground? And then he came up with this concept or this law, the law of gravity. You could call it the gravitational law of attraction. And and this law states that every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their distance between their centers. That make sense? I've got a graph here that will explain it slightly more so you understand it easier. [laughter] You know when you try to explain something and the people are more confused the second time. [laughter] Basically, in a nutshell, it means everything attracts everything else and the biggest object wins and it will attract it towards the center. That's why the apple will fall straight down towards the center of the earth and the center of the apple, right? Cuz the center of the earth will line up that way. And that's also why the apple falls towards the the big earth. The earth doesn't fall up and hit the apple cuz the earth is slightly bigger than the apple, right? And then but then in our universe we've got bigger objects floating around everywhere like the sun is bigger than us. So then it's got this it it's pulling things towards it and other things are pulling. It's like this big sort of pulling match and then in amongst this big pull this big everything is attracting everything else in amongst all this attraction stuff just ends up sitting rocks end up sitting in the sky. You ever thought about that? You look up and you see a rock sitting in the sky. It's hard to believe sometimes, but it's there. That's a big rock, but it's obviously there there's a traction that is pulling this thing and it just happens to find itself. Well, I got I'm being pulled this way, but I'm being pulled that way at the same time. So, I'll just my equilibrium is I just sit here sitting in the sky, right? It's attraction. Things are being attracted. Every everything attracts everything else. There's an attraction, right? Incidentally enough, Isaac Newton's apple tree is still alive. It's been grafted a few times, but the apple tree is still alive. If you want to go and see his tree, you can go and see his apple tree. So, the gravitational law of attraction is every everything attracts everything else and the biggest object wins. Now, I want to get to a spiritual side of this because we are spiritual people and every natural law has a spiritual application all the time. If you want to understand God, you can just look around you, see what laws he's put in place, and you can directly apply those two to the spiritual realm. And it and it just has to work like that because that's the way that God made it. He just he just matched it, right? So now when you talk about it, when you got this concept called attraction, bigger things have more attraction than smaller things. Like like I'll give you some examples. If you've got this man here playing music, nobody knows him. He maybe is okay, but he doesn't really have very good songs. His voice maybe not that good, whatever. He just he's not very good or he's he's not very attractive, right? He people will walk past him and think not much of it. He doesn't have a very strong attraction, although he has some attraction cuz someone's going to listen cuz every everything has some amount of attraction. Even very bad musicians have one or two fans, right? That's why I've got one or two. But [snorts] then if you get something that becomes they write some good music, some songs, the singer is good and then they get promoted, they get played on the radio, they get put on billboards on on TV, people start to like them. These people become larger than life. They become they have a strong attraction. They become attractive and they have a powerful attraction and they attract a lot of people, a lot of things to it because that that's just how this thing works. There's a force happening here. That's not a joke. It's a real thing. All right. Okay. Now, the concept is if it's bigger than you and you get close to it, that will have a powerful attraction. It will. You can't say, "Well, I'll get close to it. It won't attract me." It will attract you. If it's bigger than you, it will attract you. Right? Satan uses this concept. Uh same with say something like sports, like basketball. These guys are running around throwing a ball in a hoop. Kids aren't going to walk past these guys playing here and think, "Well, I want to be the I want to be a basketball player because this is just so attractive what these guys are doing out in the street throwing a ball." It's not overly attractive, but you create something bigger. A whole stadium that people are watching, it's on TV. The the the guys are on photos with Nike shoes and promoting that. And these these become big. This becomes very attractive. These starting five are like gods. the starting five of an NBA basketball team. If you're in the starting five, you're you're at the apex of like a sportsman in America. You're you're virtually royalty. England has kings and queens as royalty. America has actors and movie stars uh actors and singers and sports stars as that's that's their royalty. But it's got such a powerful attraction. Boys and girls as well will watch this and become so attracted. They will want to be like this because it's powerful. It has to attract, right? Uh even in the business world if someone there could be a guy running a little glass business with very good skills and he he he he runs good a good business makes money but he it's just a small little business. No one cares too much about him. But you get someone else like the right place the right time. This guy just happened to come across this idea to stream films instead of hire them and just happened to work at the right time. Then he becomes a an international business just because his concept was he's got smarts but he's not smarter than this guy, right? But his concept seem to work and suddenly he's got more attraction. So, you know, if you're going to have someone speak at your event, you're not going to get the glass guy cuz nobody knows them. They're not attracted to him. But even though he may be just as smart, but but the reason is this guy's got more attraction, right? Because everything attracts everything else. This guy just happens to attract a lot more of it. So you you want him and you're if you know this guy, you're proud I know the guy. We we work on that. We work on that attraction to and it it even comes down to in our everyday life, we have like a like a people can become larger than life and they can have an an attractive power over us. like a a boss or a leader in your circles. They can have an attractive power because they are slightly bigger than you. That's why there are rules against about work employee employee relationships. They have to the laws sometimes have to balance up the power because there's an attraction one way. You understand that that right? That's how this that's how this works. So now you get to this concept of scrolling attraction and algorithms. Right? This is the reason why this is if you design this is very good. If you don't like what it does, it's very bad. Right? But it's a very welldesigned mechanism to attract you and me, right? Because the concept of scrolling is you can keep scrolling forever until you find something that's going to attract you. Because there's a world out there that something is going to eventually attract your attention. You're eventually going to stop on something. The minute you do, the algorithm kicks in. Something has attracted you. And if you stop and read something, then the algorithm kicks in and says, "That's what they're attracted to. I will start feeding them that." So you you're as whatever you stopped on, that will start filling up your feed because that's what you're attracted to. And then it will create th this will lead young people down paths that they weren't going to go, right? This this leads lives because this is powerful attraction because it might show a sports star, might show a movie star, might show something and then it will keep showing it and it will it and and there's such a power of attraction that that pe that we don't when you get older you know what it's about so you stay away but when you don't know what it's about you get close to it and it attracts you. This is this leads people by the power of attraction. But I want to say I want to flip this now because Satan this is how he uses things. He uses his power of attraction to attract people down the way that he wants them to go. If you can take this the way that I that I mean it, the Lord has no attraction in this sense. Like he he's not very attractive. It's not like you look at him walking down the street and you think, "Wow, I want to be just like that. He's unattractive." And even the Bible says, "For he shall grow out before him as a tender plant and as a root out of the dry ground. He hath no form nor comeliness. And when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. He's unattractive. He doesn't have the that the drawing power like what an NBA star does or a movie star does or a musician does. He's he's very unattractive in terms of the attraction that that we're talking about. And you might say, well, people were attracted to him. They weren't really attracted to him. They were just attracted to the fact that they could get something out of him because you're attracted to yourself as well. And if you can benefit, you're going to be attracted to that, right? So that so that that's a a big part of his initial attraction was because uh here here's a list of the generally why people were attracted to him. They wanted to be healed or something fixed. I've got a daughter that's sick. My mother's sick. I'm sick. Uh my servants like this. I need this. I need some money here. I need I need something. So they're attracted like that. Or some people are just fascinated by it because they heard he was healed. So what? There's a fascination. This guy's doing healing. I'll go and have a look at it. You know, they're fascinated by this. Or then he had his critics that hated him hang around him because they hated him. want to see what he's up to. What's he saying now to try and catch him out? Uh and then and then there's this group that just want to see what the attraction's about. Why are all the people standing around? So there more people standing around. That's attraction creates attraction. Like if you're at a store at a home show or something like that, a little trick you want to do is we always joke about you want to rent a crowd, you know? So you have people you have supposed people in your store looking at your things that you're trying to sell and that will attract attention. Other people will come. It's a natural phenomenon that you could have nobody in your stall and when you get two or three people stop to talk then suddenly the whole everyone stops and wants to what are they looking at? There must be something good cuz there's a few people attracted to it. That's how we humans work. Okay. So if you're in if you're at a if you're at one of these stores you get a renter crowd work your wonders and within this there was a small amount that actually loved the word of God. A very small amount that were attracted to the word of God. But most of the attraction was was this other stuff. Shan and I when we lived in China we some we lived in this village very poor people you know living on one new a day which is like 20 cents a day and they said to us there's this amazing park up in the hills there and and it's a been there for hundreds of years and it's got all sorts of amazing things there and and uh this weekend is a free day and we're going to all go along say would you like us to take you along to this park you know it's a free day so we not really thinking much of it not really thinking of the dense population of China We thought, "Yeah, we'll go along to this this park." We got there, man. It was like it was like standing room only in this park because it was free that one day of the year. I mean, this park cost you 20 cents to get in. Like, but if you know what the Chinese are like, they they're very thrifty, you know? So, if there's a if I can save 20 cents, which is one UN, then the whole it's like the whole of China went to this park that same day. It was it was Shannon actually had Dave. He was a little guy. was even I I shouldn't tell that story. I can't tell it, can I? Okay. So, she's breastfeeding at the time, right? And and so, and there's so many people, there's nowhere to sit. So, she's she sits out in the middle up by this tree in this field and and puts this umbrella over her to to breastfeed Dave. There were so many people around and people are so inquisitive. And also when we lived there, I think it took me three months before I saw one white person because we were way up in this old village in this quite a big city. But there was that back then was no one else there apart from Chinese. And a the place was packed in this park and b they were so inquisitive. People were actually going and lifting up the umbrella to think what's underneath this umbrella. The only word I knew I I knew a few words cuz we hadn't been there long in Chinese. One word I knew was chu, which is go. like go. I felt like someone chasing away I shouldn't say it but it's it was just I'm not saying this in a disrespectful way but I felt like someone was chasing away like seagulls from getting at your food. You know I was going chew chew and these guys would run and they would run and they would run. I say chew chew like [laughter] but they something about us was attractive. We were walking down the street one time and we saw these little puppies for sale on the street and I always like dogs and I was thinking about getting a little dog when I was there. So, we started looking at these dogs and then and then there was a massive crowd around the dogs. And I said to Shannon, "Man, these dogs must be quite popular. People must really like dogs." And Shannon said, "No, they're all basically they're all looking at us." That's that was the [laughter] every time you'd stop, you'd gather a crowd. Then you'd move on and you'd gather a crowd. It's attraction. But with the Lord, when the attraction wore off, most of the people left. When the when the human attraction, the natural human attraction wore off, most of the people left. It was the same in Brother Brandham's ministry when he was healing. When there was something people could get out of it, they could be healed. They could they almost used him like a fortune teller. Can you tell me something about my life because I'm having this problem? Can Can you help me sort it out? When when that wore off, the people left. Most of the people left. It was look at look at this. It was massive because there was such a strong attraction to to this to being healed or to getting something. But overall, the gospel is a small unattractive thing. It really is a it's unattractive. It doesn't have the the the attractive power that these other things have. Like like the apex of it is a man walking around speaking somewhere. You try and promote that in like a a fast-paced video, what are your shots going to be? A person talking talking. It's not like basketball. They're jumping up, slam dunking on music, whatever. It's just it's very Jes Paul even talked about it's he called it the foolishness of preaching. He said the Lord has chosen to to make this mechanism called the foolishness of preaching to to spread the gospel. What the world looks at as foolish. That's such a foolish, unattractive thing. And that's the best you got. You know, it's that's such an unattractive thing. A man just walking around maybe in a little house group and speaking the word of God. It's that that's that that's what this gospel is. It's it's it's very small. It's very very unattractive. I just want to cut back to this for a second, but Satan works on the principle of attraction. That's how he does things. He wants to he works on this power of attraction. And it's called the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life, and those that's all that's in the world really. And they all have attractive power. The lust of the flesh. Your body wants something. And you're even could be sexually the lust of the eyes you look things you want it the pride of life you want to be something it's it's attraction and because in John it says for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and that's the pulling power that that Satan uses but that the rule is that you'll only do something willingly if you were attracted to it I put a person here painting cuz why would anyone want to go and paint you know like this you know it's so boring but yet if you're attracted to it you'll invest money into painting. I say that cuz Shannon's a painter. I'm not going to joke anymore. You But if you're attracted to something, you will you will invest time, you your money, your time, you you'll move towards it because you're attracted to it. And there's money to be made in this thing called attraction. Don't do this if you're a businessman, but that but there's a general rule that if you can tap into this power of attraction, there's money to be made. This is an old adage that it just repackaged all sorts of different ways. But you can sell men lust and they'll buy it. You can sell women beauty. You can sell parents peace of mind. You can sell the elderly health. You can sell the youth dreams. How many times have you seen a young person being sold a dream? Here's a dream. It's going to cost you $100,000 in university fees. But here's a dream. And and and they and every year there's a new generation coming to buy it. I'll buy the dream. I'll buy the dream. You sell the rich security. How how are we going to store this money when there's a recession on? It's strange because the things that that go up in value are things like art, an art piece. Cuz where am I going to put my money? The market's down. The if I invested in currency, currency is dropping. I need to put it somewhere. I'll buy a piece of art, a painting. Cuz by the end of the recession, it's still a painting. This you can sell the broken hope. Sell them hope. Sell someone that's broke. Sell them hope. There's hope. Some way if you can get money out of them, even though the guy's broke, you could someway get money to tell him there's hope and invest in this scheme for hope. And what hap what's happened now is the church then tries to make the gospel and make Jesus attractive. &gt;&gt; They they try and package it up like Satan packaged it up his stuff and let's try and make this attractive so so it will attract people. It it will it create an attraction like like we we they have there's attractive music. They they if it was a brochure, they sell hope and reform is your life like this. I'll give you hope and reform. They sell it as an attractive package. You're poor. God will make you rich. I'll sell you prosperity. Um uh you got no friends. I'll sell you a community. You can have friends. They try and package it like it's attractive. Uh I'll sell a good God that's always going to be good to you. Yeah. He's never going to be upset. He's always going to be good. He's always going to think you're the best thing in the world. Uh sometimes he doesn't. [laughter] Sometimes he doesn't. or I'll sell you the idea that everything was always going to work out great for you. You're going to It's like this package that that we try and make it so attractive and yet it's not really the truth. It's it's not really this. Sometimes sometimes things don't go well for you. Some sometimes you you stay dirt poor your whole life. Sometimes all your friends leave you. there might be a trouble in the church and that you many people come and go because they get they sign up to something attractive and then when it doesn't work they're gone because this this isn't what I signed up for. I was attracted to it. Now it's not what I thought I'm gone. And that's the way about music. This is this is a big church in Wellington. I think it's probably the biggest church for a while there. It was the biggest church in the country. Oh, you used to go there? probably. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I don't want to say who the guy is because I I like the guy that runs it. I I actually I know him. He when I lived in Oakland in on Wii Island, he they had a big church in Oakland and he would come across we were trying to start some outreach services on Wii Island and I was at the Baptist church at the time and and this guy would come over and and his church would help us there. There's only like 10 of us at the church there. And and he would travel over and be helping us to set up these sort of Friday night youth outreach things. A and look, this is no disrespect to this guy because he's he's a nice guy. He's a good guy. So, I don't want it's not about that. But his concept to make it work, he said, "What you've got to do is you got to have attractive music." That's the main thing. That that's what we're going for here because obviously musicians. So, it's like the main thing is you got to make the music attractive. Young people love music. Make the music attractive. That's how we're going to that's what we're going to base this whole thing on is attractive music. So, we're going to base the the outreach of the gospel on attractive music. That's the attraction, but that's that's not a keeping power. It's not an attraction, but it obviously worked here. [laughter] But that's that's the concept. I've got this up here because Shannon's been saying about she likes the word 44 cuz she's 44. And I think Sister Genie turned 44. So, they're saying 44. And when I was when she was saying that, I thought I'm sure there's something that Brother Brandham said about 44. And he said this. He said, "You Baptists are hollering a million more of 44. What have you got when you get what have you got when you got them? Just a bunch of sinners come in with their names on the book. That's right. Say they belong to the Baptist church." Not only that, but the other Methodists Campellites and the whole group just as informal and and different and indifferent. Billy Graham had that. He said 30,000 converts. He said in 6 weeks and 6 weeks later he couldn't find 30. Why? They never got nothing to start with. just a bunch of sinners when they put their name on the book under the spell of a revi of a revival or under this attraction. They just created this big attraction to to attract people, but there was really nothing to it. And brother Brown calls it the spell of a revival. It just you you go and try and find people 6 weeks later of the 30,000 that were attracted you got you can't find 30. And unfortunately, that's how that's how that's how the the the man in his in his carnal wisdom because he's using the wisdom of this world is trying to build the gospel, build the church and build a connection with God and establish everything as on this natural power of attraction which will never work. And brother says, I'm afraid we've made it too easy. It's he says, I love I think joy. Certainly, I believe that all joys lays in Jesus Christ. That's right. I believe it's joyful and happy, but remember, brother, it's the way of agony and suffering in the cross. You must realize that too. That's right. I wonder if we haven't painted a little too a little too smooth. That we've just made it so attractive and then people get disappointed when it's not actually what the brochure says on some weeks and some months and some years and some decades. But I don't want to make this too negative because I'm actually going somewhere with this cuz I want to show you really the what keeps us attracted and what keeps me attracted cuz I've been through so much stuff in my life. I think, Lord, what why do I keep on going with this thing? Half the time things don't work out. Everything doesn't go the way that it should. It's just I seem to be worse off after the time. And I think to myself, what is there in me that makes me keep doing this? Because this doesn't make any sense. I'm not attract there's not enough attraction to this. And a natural attraction, if I could put it that way, if I was honest, if that's all there was, I'd be gone. If there was just natural attraction that I'm attracted to it, I would be done with this whole thing. But there's something bigger than all that in this whole thing. There's a there's a there's a more powerful attraction in this that actually is what we preach and it's actually the gospel and it's the word of God. But yet God's a god of attraction. This is just I just want to say this for five minutes then I want to go into something else that I really want to talk about. But God is into being attracted to the right thing. And attraction does bring unity and attraction does bring life. Like if I give an example, this scripture here says, "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity." Then he goes on to say, "It's like the precious ointment, the anointed oil that runs down Aaron and down his bed and down the skirts of his garment." But if you go to the first verse here, the the first concept in this is the people as brethren. It's not saying how good it is for an unbeliever and a believer to be in unity, right? He's not saying that. He says brethren, so it's based on the right thing, right? This attraction's got to be based on the right thing. And then within that, the brethren have to have an attraction to each other. Like like brother Phil and I do, you know, at the start he I felt the attraction. There's an attraction. He loves me, I love him. Therefore, we're attracted. And then it it creates unity. It creates togetherness. That's God actually is still that, right? So I don't want to say God doesn't work in attraction because he does. But he wants us to be attracted to the right thing. And that's why he says by this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you have love one for the other. This a and love is an attraction. I love you. We're attracted. We we keep together because we're attracted. There's something that attracts us. It creates unity, right? If you don't like someone, you pull away. &gt;&gt; But if you love them, you go together, right? I'm going to talk about this for about 5 minutes. This is a bit of a a byproduct, but there's a lot of things in life that we are attracted to that we don't even realize it. Okay? We are very attracted to life. Like you wake up in the morning and you're attracted to being alive. We don't realize it cuz when we die, I think we'll realize we were attracted to life. But we've got things in our natural body that are that's attracted to being alive. We don't we don't want to just die. We want to actually live like like we've got this awesome thing called adrenaline which when our body gets to a when our mind when everything senses that okay I my life may finish here my life is in grave danger. This thing called adrenaline which is sitting in all of you which is attracted to being alive it will come out and it will work because it wants to be alive. Your body is attracted to being alive. It's like I don't I don't want this life to finish. I want to stay alive. And you can't make it happen. It will just happen. And it's sitting inside all of you because there's an attraction in you to stay alive. It'll increase your heart rate. Suddenly your heart will go faster. It'll accelerate your breathing. You'll get more oxygen. It provides energy. Your kidneys actually will will actually instantly release all of this um all of glucose into your body straight away to give you instant energy. Whereas under normal circumstances, it'll just stay in there and digest it how it wants to. But it'll just instantly instantly release it. your your stomach will stop Joe's testing because all of the blood will go to all the other organs that need to fight to survive. Your pain tolerance virtually is a man could be running with a with his arm cut off and not feel the pain because he he's about to be shot again whatever is happening and or a man or woman and they could run and not feel the pain because your pain tolerance suddenly is pretty much obsolete. Like you you can you can no not obsolete it's the other way. You can tolerate any sort of pain because in yourself is an attraction to being alive. such a powerful attraction to being alive. And if that doesn't all if if you throughout the day too, if you're still under the stress, your body gives you like a it's called cortisol. It will help you throughout the day to actually then follow through to make sure you're you're still alive. I'm going to make sure you see you through the day. You're attracted to breathing. You're very attracted to breathing. You know, you breathe 22,000 times per day or 8 million times a year. You wake up in the morning and you breathe. You're attracted to food. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you why. Because the less you have of it, the more you want it. Look, we just The Lord's built this thing on attraction. We're attracted to it. The Bible says, "The full soul loth in a honeycomb, but to the hungry soul, every bitter thing is sweet." My last thing on this, you're very attracted to energy. Whether you, believe it or not, you're attracted to energy. Namely, you're very, very attracted to this big thing here. Cuz that big thing there got you here this morning. &gt;&gt; If it wasn't for that, you wouldn't be here. Like like if you drove your car here, that big thing there, the world works on energy and it needs it needs energy to be pushed into it because it gets used up and it cycles through the system. And that's the only place we get it from. &gt;&gt; That there. If that disappeared, there'd be no energy in the world. That there grew plants. The plants died. They went into the ground. The created this oil. There was energy to get the oil out of the ground. Then it was put in your car and you drove here. And if you walked here, it grew the plants and you ate the food and you came here using your energy. You take that away, you have we're done. We love this. We're very attracted to this. &gt;&gt; I just want to put this in there because the spirit of God is the same as that. This world is under decay. It's constantly decaying, but there spiritually, but there is a there is currently now a spirit of God upon the earth that is actually putting energy is is is keeping this world together as we speak. We say, "Oh, the world's getting worse. The world's getting bad." It's not bad. The spirit of God's still here. It's not bad. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. &gt;&gt; It's actually okay. Like, the sun's here and the spirit of God's here. This is actually all okay. There is still sanity. We think the world's going insane. The world's not going insane. It's all being held together. You wait till the spirit of God leaves &gt;&gt; because at that same time, it said the sun will be darkened around the same time because it's a type. You you stop the sun, life as we know it here just dies. It it doesn't take many days, weeks before civilization is dead if you take away the sun. Just like you take away the spirit of God, spiritually we just die. We we have this attraction, not even realizing it. This is what I want to preach a bit on this morning. Have I still got your attention? &gt;&gt; Okay, you're very you're you're going to think naturally and spiritually with with this for a bit. Okay, I'm going to slow down. I want to get this through to you. Not not through to you that you don't understand, but I want to this blessed me. So I want to bless you with this thought. Okay. There's four what we call fundamental forces that exist in the universe. One of them is the force of gravity which was the the one first one we talked about. The next force is electromagnetism. The next force they call it a strong force and the next force they call it a weak force. right now. I'm not a physicist or a scientist or a um What are those guys like? Brother George, what does he do? He um um &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. [laughter] Yeah. Yeah. So, so I may not get this perfectly right, but I I do know a small amount. All right. So, there are four fundamental forces in the world. We've talked about gravitation already. that that's a force that pulls each other to itself here. Gravity, it's a long range force and it's attractive, but it's very weak. Like like you can't have a bigger object here and a smaller one and they attract each other there, right? Electromagnetism. That's you've seen like magnets that will stick together and the other side won't come together. That's the that's that's an electro um magnetism force. That's what makes these the north and the south will connect. The other ones won't connect. There's a there's just a force that exists in the universe that if you duplicate it to a smaller degree, it will happen like that, right? There's what they call the weak nuclear force which is actually responsible for like when when molecules break down, they create radiation. It it breaks it down. That's that's what a weak nuclear force. And and there's this force called the strong nuclear force, which is the most powerful force in the universe, right? It's the most powerful force that exists in the universe. And the nature of this force is that it's attractive. Like gravity is attractive. Electromagnetism is not really attractive. It's more waves. It it will do what it does. But this the strongest force that exists in the world is a force that attracts. It pulls and it binds together. Right? So within you and me and within everything you can see and everything you can touch there are these tiny things called atoms that you can't see. They're minuscule. You can't see these things called atoms. They're tiny but they they we are all little billions and of atoms. That's what we are. That's what everything you can touch. We are atoms right? And within these little atoms you've got protons and you've got neutrons. Okay. So a proton is a positive electrical force and a neutron is a neutral. Right? The nature of these two of these two things is that the proton and the neut neutron because they are different. There's an electromagnetic force around a tiny atom that will create a force in there. So these two will stick together because it's like the north and the south comes together, right? That's no problem. The problem that you have inside an atom, the issue that that you have is that you've got these you've got neutrons trying to stick together and protons trying to stick together and they naturally want to repel. Right? So within the atom, it shouldn't hold together because everything within it wants to push apart. It doesn't want to stay together. It wants to push apart. Right? That's the nature of an atom. And theoretically it should all pull apart. Now when an atom pulls apart that means we fall apart. That means this pulpit here falls apart. That means your shoes fall apart. If these things come apart the universe falls apart, &gt;&gt; right? The this little thing here holds the whole universe together. Atoms. the these are when you dig right down to the building blocks of humanity of our existence here, atoms are the building block of humanity. Now, if this little thing falls apart, everything's done. Within this atom, there's this thing called the strong nuclear force that is attractive that's so attractive that it overrides every other force that exists in the universe. It overrides the electrome force and it pulls everything together. And no matter no matter what you throw at this little thing, you cannot break the force, the strong nuclear force, because they didn't they couldn't figure out another name for it. What should we call it? It's the strongest force we know of. Let's just call it the strong force. It it's attractive and it pulls together the atoms and everything that holds it that that that actually it it essentially holds all of us together as a strong attractive nuclear force. Right? That make sense? The strong nuclear force, also called the strong nuclear interaction, is the strongest of the four fundamental forces of nature. It is 6,000 trillion trillion times stronger than the force of gravity. This force is immense, right? It it's it's absolutely immense. The reason why I'm telling you this is because it has an attractive power that it binds things together that shouldn't otherwise be bound together that if it didn't work the whole universe falls apart. Now people have asked a question where did this force come from? I've looked tried to look into that and the answer is always well if we if we want to answer that we kind of have to answer who are we and why are we here because it really is this unique force that sits inside the atom that holds everything together and we just don't know why it's there but it's there and it's holding everything together. The reason why I say this is because when I go through hard times when I go through hardship when when things happen the gospel everything loses its attraction. I'm going to be honest with you. It if we're honest with ourselves, there are times when it loses its attraction. You you get you get so many things in life, you think this is not attractive. If I was just here attracted to being a Christian based on I'm going to get friends. I'm going to get things are going to go well for me. I'd walk away because it's unattractive. And I think Lord, why don't I walk away? There's something else that's holding me together. &gt;&gt; There's a there's a strong force. There's something within when I take when I break everything away. When I take it all away, when I take the music away, take take it all away. There's something more to this than just my attraction to it. There's something so powerful that binds me to God that's never going to be broken. At the core of who I am, there's a there's this there's an attractive power that that that pulls God and me together and will never be separated. That's why Paul says, "What shall separate us from the love of God?" It's such a powerful force. And we we have just started to understand the power of this force because we've got what they call a nuclear bomb. And what this thing is, what man has tapped into here is they have tapped into reversing this force that holds humanity together and sending it the other way. And this stuff is so powerful. You the mind can't comprehend the power in this stuff. the power in this force that was there which there's no other force like it in the and and in in World War II we had we had dynamite and we were chucking around dynamite and we were we were blowing up like we were blowing up whole cities with with dynamite and you know we we we go through we we fought in World War II for 5 years and we'd blow up cities and everyone was bombing each other they used 3 million tons of TNT and Europe was flattened the whole place was flattened The Russians designed this bomb here which is called the uh SAR bomb or the emperor bomb. This thing weighs 27 tons but it's the equivalent to 50 million tons of TNT. Look like we spent 5 years and bombed the whole of Europe and we we used up 3 million. This thing's 50 million and that was half strength. This should be 100 million tons of TNT. What's it using? It's not using like a conventional TNT. It's it's tapping into the fabric of the very force that holds humanity together. It's reversing it right down in the very the very minuscule core of who we are. Man has got right in there and is about to reverse the whole thing that holds us together and send it out the other way. Look at Look at the scope of what we're doing. This is insanity. It's absolute insanity what we've done. &gt;&gt; But God's got a plan for all this. But look, you got Hiroshima and Nagasaka. These the little bombs that destroy cities. They're babies compared to what we've got. Look at the size of this thing. It's like 500 km in the like I think it's 50 km in the sky. It's it towers over Everest. The the biggest one over there, the the Emperor bomb, that's what it should have been. They they set this thing off at half strength. cuz they didn't want to set up a full strength. It was only released, I think 2014, 15, the secret footage of this thing that in in Russia they they did it up in the North Sea and they dropped this thing from a plane and got video footage of this massive bomb. And the power of this thing is it it takes the atom. It takes the atom and it takes the force that holds humanity together and it reverses it and it sends it the other way. and essentially uses the whole force against us. And it's the most powerful force. And that's that's where that's where we stand at today as a civilization. That this the very force that holds us together is about to be used against us. And I'm thinking about this and I'm thinking, Lord, there's there's a there's a type in all this because when you when you think about the magnitude of what's happening, that's why brother Bradom says there won't be one bomb fall till the bride's gone, &gt;&gt; right? And there's a reason for that. It's not just because, oh, let's get her out of there. There's there's there's more of a fundamental reason for this because if you can see what's happening, God works in types. And he's shown that that right down when you when you hold right down to the core of humanity, I'm holding it together. &gt;&gt; I'm holding it. &gt;&gt; That's the power of God. I've put something there to show you I'm holding this together when it shouldn't otherwise hold when I shouldn't hold together. When this shouldn't hold together, it it should fall apart. But I'm in there holding it all together. &gt;&gt; And it's exactly the same. That's that's the same in our in our Christian walk. It's not me, Lord. I'm attracted. I'm going to try and hang on to you. There's a force that's there's an attractive force within when you take everything away that binds me to God. That that will never be separated. It it can it can never be torn apart. And it it's a natural type. So this thing can't be torn apart while I'm still on the earth because that would mean Lord, can I just be torn apart? &gt;&gt; You understand that? &gt;&gt; Yes. with Lord that this this thing that this thing that that holds together humanity is going to is going to be holding everything together till I've gone when I'm gone this very thing that held humanity together is going to be turned and pull it all apart but I thank the Lord that when I'm gone we're going to go to another place where there's that same attractive that the the attractive keeping power of the Lord is going to is in eternity is going to bind you bind behind me bind it all together. We we're not going to be in this whole world is going to be done for. &gt;&gt; But I thank the Lord that when we get to the other side, there's going to be this attractive that that same thing that holds me together here, which is which is the word of God. It's it's even greater than that. It's his word. It's everything that he is just he's decided you're mine. I'm going to hold you. It doesn't matter if you can you can go through things in your life and and it could all not make sense and yet you still carry on with the Lord &gt;&gt; like like those two these two atoms there's an argument to say they shouldn't be together and it's a legitimate argument this one does not bind to that one there's good arguments why you shouldn't carry on sometimes but this overrides all that there's a force that overrides that doesn't that doesn't have to make sense if it can all go bad. &gt;&gt; It it it doesn't there's it Yes, your argument is correct, but that whatever I'm still going on because there's something greater than all that that binds me to this. Like like you look at Paul, anyone that would you you think you think of the life that Paul lived that didn't make sense that he carried on doing what he was doing. Like he would be walking to a place to talk to people and he virtually have nothing. Very unattractive. If you know you want to be like Paul, he had nothing. He was poor. Then the small amount that he had, he would get robbed on the way. Then he would end up in a new place, still have nothing. He wouldn't suddenly get a Cadillac when he turned up or what we call like a nice brand new Ford when he turned up. Still have nothing when he arrived. No, I rephrase that. Less than what he had when he left. Then he's got to go and speak the gospel. Then maybe midway through that, the people in town realize he's there and they track him down and they if they don't stone him, he's got to quickly get out of the town. Why is he doing it? Like like what's attractive in that for him? You think about it? What's attractive? Like if if you said this is if you put that on a sales brochure, no one would take it. But we don't. That's not what we do. There's a there's an there's a an attractive force greater than what we are. Greater than everything that that actually it's God it's predestination that God said, "I've chosen you. I'm going to I'm going to attract you and I'm going to call you. I'm going to bind you together." There's an attractive force that's greater than all this stuff, greater than all your problems, greater than all your ups and downs. It actually binds us together that will that will pull us through everything. And I'll just enclose with this because you wonder why you get trouble in life. You wonder why you get attacks. You wonder why stuff happens. It has to happen. [laughter] because there's another law which is the second most powerful force which that's where Satan dwells in you know he's he's he's not number one he's number two but there's a force that says opposites will just attract but they'll never join they'll just and you you wonder the Bible says all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution &gt;&gt; right so if you want to live a godly life and be connected with the Lord and have that when When you exist in the world, you're going to become attractive &gt;&gt; the to the enemy. And you know what? He's going to become attractive to you. You're just going to clash. &gt;&gt; It try and avoid it. You won't avoid it. You're going to It's just these two opposites are just going to clash and clash and clash. That's why you're going to have you're going to have no end of trouble from the enemy. Does that make sense? &gt;&gt; Right. you're going to have no end of trouble because that's the way this thing's got to work. If you're if you're this and he's that, no matter where you go, no matter what you do, you're just going to go clash clash clash clash. It's just going to happen. And and and you'll never get away from it till it's all over. But what I like about this is they never join and never they never merge and become one. They just But I don't mind that because the word of God because brother Brandham says, you know, if Satan if if he's not at you, then he's got you. You're either one side or the other. &gt;&gt; And that's what the that's what the how would I say this? Like I lost my train of thought. I just want to leave you because it may have sounded negative, but I want to leave you with this with this thought at the end that by the end of all this eternity is just going to be pure attraction. this attraction that actually this attractive force that binds everything that we are together that that binds me to God when we get to this other place is going to be such an attraction and we minus all of the worldly attractions that we that we have here that that young fellas that they they get attracted to this all these things are trying to pull them and pull them in every which way. I'm glad that there is an attractive power of the Lord that actually will will pull us that's the strongest force that's going to that through all of this other mess that's stronger than every other attraction. Yeah, &gt;&gt; the the attractive power of God that this force and it's just going to it'll start pulling if you're one of God's. No matter where you go, what you do, it's just going to start pulling. It's just going to pull pull and then it's going to bind you together. And that's why I'll close with a scripture. That's why that's why Paul said, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" &gt;&gt; Okay? Because now you're talking about this this the strongest force that's bound everything together. Shall tribulation, will that break it? Uh or distress, will distress have enough power to undo this force? Or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword? As it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long. We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. But Paul says, "Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us." He says, "For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." This attractive force that binds me with God, there's nothing that can break it. There's nothing the world can throw at me. There's nothing the enemy can throw at me. There's nothing I can go through that can ever break this attractive force &gt;&gt; that I that God has with me. And that's how I think, Lord, everything's going to be all right. It don't matter what gets thrown at me. I'm just going to &gt;&gt; I'm going to carry on through all this. And you are as well because I can see that in your life. Let's have the musicians. We'll just stand this morning and we'll just pray as the musicians start to play. Lord, I just want to thank you, Lord, that as I look back in my own life, Lord, and when the when, Lord, when our own ideas of what we think things should be, when when they wear off, Lord, and we begin to dig deeper into this this whole thing that, Lord, that we that's you and everything about we we start to see, Lord, that there's something greater at play here than than than us and our circumstances than than anything like that, Lord. There's this there's something greater, Lord, there's a predestination, there's a calling, there's there's an attraction, Lord, that that is greater than all this, Lord, that that regardless of height or depth or distress or famine or regardless of what might happen, Lord, there's this Lord, there's a force that's you, Lord, that's that's holding us that's that's just holding me to you, Lord. And I I just I thank you for that, Lord. And I just thank you for that seeing that in each one here, Lord. Knowing a little bit about what different ones here go through, Lord. And we we we understand that naturally sometimes it doesn't make sense, Lord. And yet there's there's even a force that overrides our overrides reason itself or or or or that overrides arguments. It overrides all of that. It's more powerful than all of that, Lord. And it it can't be broken by a an argument or it can't be broken by a situation, Lord. this this bond that we have with you. It can't be broken by any hardship, Lord, but it's a Lord, it's this eternal force, Lord, that that binds us to you. And I just thank you for that, Lord Jesus. I pray you bless each one here this morning, Lord. May you continue to um just go with us, Lord, as we we walk this journey, Lord, and we see in this end time, you said perilous times shall come. Lord, we but we thank you for placing us here, Lord. We could have been placed in in another age where it maybe wasn't so perilous. But we thank you, Lord, that we are here at this time and we can we can just serve and love you in this time, Lord. So, I just want to pray a blessing upon each one. May you just be with us this morning. I just pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Jimmy, [applause] thank you Isaac for that. [clears throat] I just want to say sorry guys. I can't sing. You know me.
