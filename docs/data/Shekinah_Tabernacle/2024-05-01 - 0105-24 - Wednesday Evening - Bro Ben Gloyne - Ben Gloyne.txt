numbers 23:19 God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken and shall he not make it good behold I have received commandment to bless and he hath blessed and I cannot reverse it he hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel the Lord his God is with him and the shout of a king is among them Hallelujah he's talking about you there by the way amen praise the Lord and let's go to Philippians chapter 1 we're going to read a few scriptures here as well uh we're going to read from um sorry just get this open um Philippians 1 and verse 6 and down to verse 11 here so Philippians 1 and verse 6 being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ praise the Lord even as it is meat for me to think this of you all because I have you in my heart in so much as both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Gospel ye all are partakers of my grace for God is my record how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ and this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in Al judgment that ye may approve things that are excellent that ye may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God amen amen Let's uh let's bow our heads in a word of prayer tonight so if you got a need you want to raise your hand to the Lord I got William and and Lily unwell at home and so if you got a need just just raise our hands and let's let's let's go before our great king oh Lord Lord Jesus you are the great Lord Of Glory we're so thankful as we bow our heads and now we lift our hands to you we say thank you thank you Lord because of your blood we can we can talk to you and you talk back to us Lord your blood puts us in fellowship with you it puts us in that condition we thank you dear God as we have sung the songs of Zion we have read from your great Eternal Word and I just want to ask Lord may you come now may you speak to our hearts Like Only You Can may you anoint your word to everyone Lord not just here but those who may be streaming and so especially want to remember my William and my Lilia who are unwell at home I pray you touch their bodies and raise them up dear God make them well father and anyone else who's sick and could not make it tonight be their portion dear God and may meet every need Lord Here For Your Glory we're so thankful we can Lord we can cast all our cars upon you because you care for us and we so we dedicate the service into your hands we ask that you'd have preeminence Lord and may you do what you want Done For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats tonight so I want to take a take a bit of a thought tonight about taking God at his word and I pray that we'll get to that eventually but uh we see that God you know our God is not a God that can lie I just want to you know it's so amazing where where this was actually God would use balum to speak this to U um about Israel so so the king of Moab had hired balam to try and curse Israel but yet when the spirit of God Came Upon balum God would speak through God would speak through this highing prophet and say I don't see any veress in them I see no iniquity in them and this is the god who sees all things you know this is the god who sees all things but because of the shed blood of bulls and goats God could not see their sin now if if God could look at a people just through a natural a natural blood there and see no perverseness and see no and see no iniquity how much more people under the blood of Jesus Christ tonight I want to push back against the enemy tonight you know you know because he Wars us in our mind he you know he wants us to think that the promises of God not for us but they are for us Jesus died to give it to us amen remember we don't Merit anything he he wanted all for me amen he wanted it all for you and I so oh here we go look we're on the big screen wonderful praise the Lord amen so this is this is what this is what uh this is what balum would would would be anointed to speak to um about Israel it's amazing where God doesn't see no iniquity in them amen he you know he says the Lord his God is with him and the shout of a king is among them and I believe we are the same kind of people am mean the pillar of fire is among us tonight amen the presence of God Is With Us irrespective of what's going on in life because you think about there in Israel there they would have had trouble fussing fighting domestic domestic issues all kind of things going on in the camp when God looked down on them he said I see nothing wrong amen because that the Lord is God is with them and the shout of a king is among them now a shout of a king speaks of dominion speaks of authority speaks of power and we know that the word of the Lord is all powerful amen God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent amen so what he has blessed will remain blessed you're a blessed people tonight I'm talking about you amen you're a blessed people Amen to receive the word of the Lord amen to be washed of all your sins to be transformed by the Holy Ghost you're a blessed person amen you're one of the most blessed people throughout all the ages is you amen we think of Moses was blessed and Enoch was blessed and Noah was blessed and Elijah was blessed and Elisha was blessed and Peter James and John were blessed and you're blessed you're in the same category amen why because you're part of God's elected ones amen hallelujah so now our God does not back up on any of his promises amen as as as God would say for his Heavens are higher than the earth and so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and return not returneth not hither but WTH the Earth and maketh it bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the sewer and bread to the eater so shall my word that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please it shall prosper in the thing where to I sent it amen amen so God's word is going to fulfill what he said it was going to fulfill amen it's not going to halfway fulfill or 3/4 of the way fulfill it's not going to load 99% and just say stuck on the loading cycle and crash no it's going to fulfill completely I mean what he said it would do now if this is how God thinks of his word am mean he wants us to think the same way he wants us to have full confidence in his word amen not have a partial confidence not have a confidence based on circumstances but a complete and utter confidence that God's word Works any situation any place any time as brother Braham said this end time message meets end time conditions amen the message in Noah's day met the conditions of the age amen the the word of Moses's day met the same conditions it met the conditions of Egypt and all the troubles and everything it met those conditions amen and the same word took them into the promised land it see the word of God meets every condition amen amen of the age that it's in and it's the same thing with you and I we are not here defenseless we are not Here Helpless we're not here trampled down we're not here you may feel that way but that but it's not your portion okay we're not here useless We're Not Here Helpless we're not here defenseless no the angel of God surround you and I amen the blood of Jesus Christ covers Us amen the Lord Of Glory is your portion amen this is who he is your portion now because many times you think well the devil's attacking me actually no it's it's God verse Satan all right right get yourself out of the equation sure the devil attacks you but really he's having a God God because he's trying to prove to God God your blood's not strong enough you're not able enough I can outsmart you I can out Fox you I can defeat you this is what the devil think he can do but God over and over again says no I proved you wrong again Satan proved you wrong again Satan proved you wrong again Satan and then in every generation God has a group of Overcomers amen where God can put his finger on them and say Satan I proved you wrong again amen and I believe I'm looking at those kind of people tonight amen we are Overcomers amen sure we wrestle with things we wrestle with our humanity and whatever more but we come out the other side packing the victory amen why because our Lord Jesus Christ has already overcome Hallelujah so now we got to take God at his word because his word is all powerful and Le was asking me what to preach on tonight I said well I'm going to preach on taking God at his word I mean because you see The Heroes of Faith down the ages they took God at his word I mean Enoch took God at his word and he went and he walked all the way home with God one day he walked with God and was not cuz God took him amen Moses took God at his word and he delivered the people of Israel is out of Egypt am mean Noah took God his word he built the ark to the saving of his house amen Elijah took God his word rebuilt the altar of the Lord put the sacrifice how God said and then when everything was there in the evening time sacrifice Elijah prayed Lord I've done this all according to your word and the fire fell amen hallelujah so all the Believers down Through the Ages have taken God at his word they had their problems they men of like passions Elijah was a man of like passions like you and I none of the Heroes of Faith were superhuman they had their doubts their frustrations their problems their stresses their pressures they had all those things but yet they are Heroes of Faith because faith is greater than these five senses amen faith is greater than than our imagination our conscience our reasoning all those things just put all those things to one side and take God at his word see the devil wants to Cloud over our minds he wants us to imagine everything but God's word amen he hav thought of just imagining having family prayer and the pillar of fire becomes visible in front of everyone changes the whole family you have a Revival in your home the devil will never give you those kind of imaginations have you ever had an imagination where God just sweeps through the church sovereignly amen and just touches every life and everyone walks out of here saying God is real in this place it's not just a sign out there but it's a reality I mean you ever had those kind of when you're driving in the car and the pillow of fire comes in and just electrifies the atmosphere I'm not talking about just imaginations these things really happen hallelujah amen you're at work and such a presence comes around you amen you know it's the Lord amen a real sweet sweet humble feeling comes over you brother that's the angels of the Lord coming around you hallelujah amen why not think on those things why not think on his promises and how able he is to fulfill them amen why not think about those kind of things I think that's a good way to get your imagination and conscience and reasoning lined up with the word of God you think God you're more than able amen let's just read I just feel to read it I think it's in Genesis 1 Let's try and find about I I just like it how God says this I think is where he says now he made the heavens and the earth now and he says he made basically the heavens he made the Stars also I'm going to search this cuz I want to read it because you know the devil wants us to doubt the word of God yes I'm Googling in church here I am 116 116 yeah perfect quick on the trigger see but isn't that neat can you put that up Genesis 1:16 and he made the two great lights the Lesser to Rule the Day and the I mean sorry the greater to light to Rule the Day the Lesser light to rule the night he made the Stars also now I don't have any big pictures of nebulas and galaxies and things but God Bas says yeah I made that too I made that too you know what all these great scientific minds are just are in a of and we look up and we stare and I remember being in the northern one of the northern islands of of of vanatu there's no lights there's no nothing it's just the milky white way in all of its glory and all the locals are just doing their thing and I just want to kind of just do this for a few you know and God says yeah I made that too by the way you know is is is anything too hard for the Lord you know and we come down onto this little planet and we look at our problems and we think our problems are big and and to us they may be big but but is anything too hard for the Lord is there anything impossible with our God is there a situation too difficult is there something that's too complex too Dee rooted too great of trouble no nothing is too hard for our Lord amen why because his word is forever true and he is his word amen so brother Braham says this in the greatest bad level of for says but the spirit it only has one sense now he actually speaking about the soul here now let's get it the spirit has one sense and that sense is either dominates it's Faith or doubt that's exactly and there's only one Avenue to it that's free moral agency so that's choice you can accept it or um sorry you can accept doubt or you can accept Faith either one you want to work on who wants to work on doubt who wants to work on faith amen so why so so so why why work on skepticism why let doubt why entertain skepticism why why entertain cynicism oh you said that before well we someone else believed that and look what happened to them and all these see the devil never points out the genuine he always points out the negative he always points out the train wreck or the car wreck on the side of the side of the road to Christianity but he'll never point you to a genuine overcoming Holy Ghost filled Family Holy Ghost filled mom or dad or brother or sister he'll never point you to the genuine am mean he always points you to the negative but so so why work on skepticism you cuz the Devil comes along well if God's really real why did this happen oh I thought is all powerful why is this still here that's a devil trying to rob you that's a devil trying to make you accept doubt no but we should we should say no no no our God is able our God is able I'm going to accept Faith amen because doubts and worries and fears has helped no one from Adam when he fell to today not a single person has been helped by doubt not a single person has been helped by worrying Amen brother BR even said well what if you going to be shot in the morning what good would Faith do this well Faith might deliver he says what's the point of worrying about it it's not going to change anything well what can Faith do faith can deliver you so I'd rather work on faith I'd rather actually take God at his word irrespective of what I'm facing in front of me I'll take God at his word anytime amen because God is looking for a response and it's a response that to me ignites the supernatural Jesus was walking on water the disciples in the boat thought he was a SP Spirit but he says be of good cheer it Des I Be not Afraid and Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me to come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus now so so there was an in so Lord if this is you invite me to where you're walking amen so invite me to your Victorious walk Lord invite me to walk upon the storm Lord if this is you and you're calling me I will come out to you amen and this is what the Lord wants us to do he he's bit us to walk with him amen he conquered hell death in the grave he conquered the devil he conquered self amen amen he conquered everything that could be conquered and he wants you to walk with him in this Victorious walk and he's bid you to come prise the Lord this is what this message does this message is an invitation come walk with me amen come walk with me Lord Jes you the Lord Jesus saying come this what the message is about God wants to walk with you God wants to talk to you God wants to have fellowship with you God wants to prove his word in your life this is what this is what the message has come to do all right maybe very simple but hey I'm a simple guy you know but this is this is God has bid us come walk with me in the storm as we heard in the in the um convention right we're going to get out of the boat sure but God calls us to walk with him and he wouldn't have bidden Peter to get out of the boat if he knew Peter was going to sink he's not that kind of a god he's not that you know you know setting up someone to fail he doesn't set up anyone to fail no he sets us up to succeed but we know the rest of the story Peter was walking they looked at the wind and the waves that were already there and he began to sink but then as he sinking he said Lord help me I perish it it says immediately Jesus took him by the hand and rescued him I mean so even when you begin to feel like you're sinking just cry out Lord help me I'm I'm drowning in this trial he'll pick you up amen he'll he'll set your feet on a solid ground in the middle an ocean am hallelujah amen he will he will he will set your feet on water that actually should not be able to be is not walkable Hallelujah that's our God he say well I don't know if he can do it he did it for Peter remember and now Peter did not have any promise in the Bible you'll walk on water he could not take out the scroll of Isaiah Jeremiah or one of them and say oh the Lord said Thou shalt walk on water therefore I walking no God just invited him come and he took God at his word amen and he stepped out of the boat and started walking he took God at his he was looking for a response from the disciples that they would take him at his word and good old Peter he's he's always first on the trigger I'm coming Hallelujah he wasn't waiting for on us to respond he wanted to respond and mean and God wants us to respond to his word I mean because Peter's response brought the supernatural into his life amen he maybe not even really fathomed really what he was going to do but he saw Jesus was there Jesus Lord if you invite me I'm coming and Jesus said come and he came Hallelujah and he didn't walk on water once he walked on water twice praise the Lord amen so the Lord is looking for a supernatural response I mean for a response and that response brings the supernatural now the three Hebrew children they they were under intense pressure to Bow but they took God at his word and they said we're not going to bow to an image yes it says it in the law Thou shalt not bow to any image right so they saw the image they read the word and they said no this this this is not compatible with who we are cuz we are this word amen we're not just Hebrews we are this word we're the people of the book amen and our God who wrote this law who's lived with our ancestors has said You shall not bow to an image so they get dragged before Nebuchadnezzar you know cuz after they go the first time and the music plays and they stand straight up and everyone else bows down and you know there's you know they you know they're brought before Nebuchadnezzar they just they just said you know we won't be careful how we're going to answer you with this we're not going to Bow if God delivers us he will if he won't well this is the last day we see you anyway but we're not going to Bow we're going to we have taken God at his word amen and that's what God is looking for in this age of people that will take God at his word amen they won't they won't bend it to change their situation they will stay with it in spite of everything amen now remember they did not have a promise of any of the prophets saying and you shall be thrown into fire and you come out but they took God at his word you shall not bow whatever the outcome was that was up to God hey if they died in the fire they still would have been Victorious amen they still would have been Victorious even if they got burned up in the fire they said no whatever happens is going to happen now we know as as brother BR loved to dramatize it you know there was there was a three Hebrew children in front of Nebuchadnezzar and there's you know you look up in heaven there's a there's a big scene there God's on his great big Throne his great big Majestic robes Hallelujah and then wormwood comes one of his angels comes up and says Master have you not seen what's going down in Babylon you know the Lord's been watching the whole time his eyes on the sparrow I know he watches me I mean I know the eye of the Lord is upon us if we're sleeping he's watching if we're awake we're watching we're brushing our teeth he's watching what he he's watching all the time I'm never out of his care I'm never out of his sight he has no blind spots Hallelujah he's never distracted amen he's watching me and he's watching them sitting on his great big Throne worood comes up Master don't you know what's happening three of your children are going to be thrown to the furnace they're standing for you can I go down there I'll drown everyone but them I can do it I drown the world in the end of lovian Destruction I will drown these you I'll drown Babylon Nebuchadnezzar thinks he's so great I'll deal with him and God says wormwood you're a good you're a good Angel ever since I created you ww you've stayed true you've done exactly what I asked you to do you've been good since the Year Dot you've been good but I can't let you go so he stands to attention Gabriel comes draws his sword master have you not seen have you not considered Shadrach mesach and abedo before the foundation of the world they were considered amen they were never out of the care of the Lord God Amen and then and then and then you know then Gabriel says Lord just let me go down there one swing I'll make one person two I'll kill them all he could have done it yeah it's amazing Jesus you know Jesus would say you know uh I could call call for 12 Legions of angels a legion is about 5,000 odd troops that's a lot of angels one could have just wiped out that whole whole thing there with Jesus you know you before he went to Calvary right just one how how much 12 Legions of angels Gabriel could have killed them all down there in Babylon but the Lord said no I can't let you go I can't let you go you're a good Angel Gabriel you're fought you've done I mean Michael or you you've done great things for me but I can't let you go well then what are you going to do and God says no no no no this is not an angelized job this is a god-sized job amen they've stood for me I'm going to stand with them amen amen and just as they're being carried into the furnace isn't amazing that even the strong soldiers that were you were carrying cuz they were tied up and they're going to be thrown to the furnace the strong ones that were carrying them actually were so overcome by the heat they died and just as I being thrown into the furnace amen what what happened God came he took a detour pass the Tree of Life took a took a big leaf off there amen went zigzagging down these Forks of lightning and was in the in the furnace in the furnace what what caused it a supernatural response to God's wordu where Shadrach mesach and big said we will not bow we may burn but we're not going to Bow God May Deliver us but we're not going to bow it was a supernatural resp response to the word of God brought God on the scene amen and they had and they had Fellowship now with the Fourth Man in that fire and brother Bram says that God was fellowshipping with them about their future Hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and I friends we are in a place just like that furnace was was was heated seven times hotter and Lady OA is seven times hotter than any other age just gone before but what happens the fourth man has stepped down cuz he says you know he says no this is a God size job My bride is upon the Earth amen she's taken me at my word amen she stands for me I'm going to stand for her amen that whatever happens in her life she's going to trust me no matter what if sickness strikes she'll trust me if if if there's no money to buy food she's going to trust me if there's no job she's going to trust me and nowhere to live she's going to trust me family goes away with she's going to trust me amen so I'm going to stand for her Hallelujah so what's happened he has come down into this age what to do to fellowship with you in your trial to tell you of your future hallelujah amen that's why the prophet would stand and say I'm going to tell you about your future home I'm going to tell you about how you get there you need the Holy Ghost you need the token hallelujah amen I'm going to tell you all about the devil does sure but I'm going to tell you where you're going to go I'm going to tell you about the streets of gold you're going to walk on I'm going to tell you about the Throne of God I'm going to tell you that you're the queen in the palace I mean I'm going to tell you where you're going to be when when the when the heavens and earth are Ren ated that's right H I'm going to tell you all about that and there's something within us says yes there's something within us says that's me am mean there's something with it says amen I can identify with that word and what does it do it produces a supernatural response amen because remember when two omnipotents meet the supernatural takes place and we know redeemed man is omnipotent amen because God said himself there is nothing impossible with you all things are possible to them that believe amen and we've got to realize that's irrespective if we have a good day a bad day happy day sad day mind battle no mind battle pain no pain sickness health wealth poor whatever irrespective faith is completely different to those things am mean because we do not walk by feelings or how we think or would no we walk by faith we walk by Revelation am mean just like Peter youo if it's you Lord bid me to come I come it was a revelation I can walk on the water yes I can walk like Jesus walked it was a revelation of in Peter's heart he started walking amen hallelujah amen isn't that the same with you and I God has given us a revelation amen walk with me and we say yes Lord You've B me to come I'm coming hallelujah amen amen amen see so a super so when two omnipotence meet amen the supernatural takes place so when God and man meet together something's got to shake something's got to move amen it it cannot remain the same there cannot be a status quo amen when whenever you read the gospel or all all the way through the Bible when God was taken at his word the supernatural was T took place amen amen when the hallelujah amen when people came in contact with the Lord and knew he was more than a man the supernatural took place am mean when the four men took their friend on a a stretcher and they couldn't get into the house where Jesus was they tore the roof off and love the friend and what was that that was two omnipotence meeting amen and it wasn't for them it was for their friend amen there was actually it actually brought healing virtue out of our Lord Jesus for their friend amen why because it was a supernatural response the Lord is here the Messiah is here this is more than a prophet here this is the god man this is the Messiah this is my Messiah this is my lamb this is the king of kings this is Emmanuel and mean he's walking our streets and we have a need and I can get this need into his presence and he's going to do what he wants to do what he can do amen see if they were doubting they wouldn't have taken the the roof off that's a lot of work man what about the repair Bill all those things you know no they wouldn't have done it if they didn't believe it remember they didn't have any he didn't say anything to them yes bring them through the roof no he was preaching or doing whatever he was doing the Lord was they said no we got to get our friend to Jesus we're going to take away all the hindrances anything that's in the way all the unbelief and skepticism whatever more we're going to pull it off how do we pull it off by prayer amen you know prayer you you an and I talking in the car you know you know you know those times when when you pray but it's not you praying who's had those times is there have those times when it it just starts flowing and and you start praying for things you're not even conscious of yes Lord who's doing that that's God that's the Holy Ghost praying through you I mean what has happened now two omnipotents have met now the Supernatural is taking place I mean it's not you just praying out of your mind of a need no it's God praying through you hallelujah amen friends God has made God has placed us up into Heavenly places am where where where the Lord dwells his position above all the devils and everything he has redeemed Us by his blood amen he has made us new creatures in Christ amen he has made us his body upon the Earth amen so God is looking for a response but you got to realize you have the response within you I don't believe I'm looking at anyone who doesn't believe in God I believe I'm looking at sincere people who have had experience with the Lord whatever age you are you've had experience with the Lord God's done something in your life don't let the devil cloud your mind you can't remember those things don't let him downplay those things no those are Eternal things I mean if this Bible is still being written you would be in this Bible amen because the book of Acts is still being written amen there'll be a there'll be a chapter or two of your life in there amen hallelujah why because of God's done Eternal thing so never let the devil diminish what he has done I mean never let him think well it didn't really happen and how do you know that really happened and no it really happened you were there the devil can't take out of my life the things the Lord has done for me he can never say no that wasn't the love of God that filled your heart when you washing dishes at College house there working no I was there I had the experience amen he can't say this Bible's not personal to me no I was there when I was reading it it became a new book amen he can't say that God doesn't move here no I've had the experience I've seen him move amen I've seen the effects of the pillar of fire in our lives amen so we must always say Lord that was you Hallelujah and what does that do that ignites now a supernatural response because because like hady right she's hearing the testimony brother Brown shooting the squirrels speaking speaking them into existence amen and she said that's nothing but the truth hallelujah and then the Lord said to him tell her whatever she wants she'll have it praise the Lord it it produced a super anointing in that house brother B called it a super anointing her response to a testimony of God's creative power amen brought creative power into the room Hallelujah and that creative power created a desire amen for God and her two sons Lord amen so how powerful it is it when we say yes Lord when we take him at his word when we say Amen we say yes Lord I agree with that yes Lord your word is true you may be reading the scripture he says amen amen you hear the prophet say Amen something in you says yes that's right what happens now A Creative power comes down Hallelujah to actually fulfill the greatest desire in our hearts remember she could have had a million dollars she could have had a lot of things she could have had her sister come out of the wheelchair old old parents you know could have been made well or young again but her main thing was the salvation of her boys Hallelujah you think about the um you know the woman of you know in you know the woman of Memphis what caused brother braham's plane to be grounded in that you know that storm come to ground that plane it wasn't the prophet what caus brother Bram to to to you know the flight's delayed because of a storm and he goes walking he's I think he's looking to a fishing shop or something and or a hunting store and then you know something tells him keep walking what was doing that it wasn't him it wasn't him there was a woman a poor little woman living in a shotgun shack who had a need amen but she had a supernatural response to God Amen she took God at his word amen and that caused brother that caused him to walk down I don't know how many miles someone's done it it's quite a few miles he's just you he's walking and the voice says just keep walking and he starts singing I'm so glad I can S one of them and he's walking along and he sees a he sees a woman there leaning on her gate like this Jew on her back wet and she says how you doing Parson and you know and you know he says how do you know I was a Parson yeah well you know and then you know they start talking and then she begins to testify to him about you know she was praying she's got a boy who's you know got you know among a bad crowd got a sickness he's dying he's lying on the um lying on the bed thinking he's in some boat in darkness somewhere saying it's getting so dark here you know but but then she had a vision of a of him walking down the street but where's your briefcase she asked him because she saw it in the vision so he he now comes into the house it says God bless this home he said I've been in King's palaces but this was the the atmosphere in the home was the greatest you know compared to those things you know and she you know you know um he asked her my name's Brandon do you know who I am and she says no I've never heard of you but I'm like the shite woman in the Bible amen so what happened is she was reading that story and God quickened to her you or that and she said amen hallelujah he spoke to her and she spoke back to him saying yes Lord I'm that what's happening now a supernatural response is going to come and then a storm comes a plane is grounded it has Elijah in it hallelujah hallelujah and God and her faith pulls the prophet into her house doesn't know who he is that but that doesn't matter pulls pulls the prophet into her house that that prayer can be can be offered for her dying son Hallelujah you know kneel down to pray and you know brother Bram says to her you pray first auntie and she started talking to God he said you could tell she spoken to him before amen and then brother Bram started praying and when he started praying he said yeah the boy on the bed was saying it's dark and he said it's getting light in here now whose Faith brought that boy from his deathbed hers that's hers don't know her name we'll see her in glory one day Hallelujah we'll have a jubilee around the Throne of God for a while Hallelujah isn't that right amen but you see her faith brought God on the scene through the prophet messenger amen hallelujah why because she had the right response to the word amen why CU two omnipotence met something's got to shake amen that's why it's so important to walk in faith amen walk in love what do you mean to walk in something well it's like if you have money in your pocket and you go walk in the mall if you like the mall you enjoy the mall not everyone but I'm saying hypothetically okay just wherever your favorite place is put yourself there I say go walk in it you're not going to just come near the front door and not no you're going to go in you're going to experience things you're going to enjoy it amen it's like walking in the love of the Lord what are you going to do you're going to enjoy him you're going to love him amen you're going to praise him more hallelujah amen because God wants our love to abound yes it's like WR in Philippians here that your love may abound yet more sorry I'm kind of segueing back to this but he wants our love to abound yet more and more a knowledge and in all judgment that ye may approve things which are excellent that ye may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ now don't let the devil push it down you saying you can't be um sincere and without offense see you know you talk about the promises of God the Devil comes along and says no that's not for you look at your past look at what you've been thinking look at what you've gone through look at the Mind battles you've had look at your troubles he puts those things against you for you to back up yep or is it just me he does that too see we got to defy those things right he puts that resistance in your mind because he knows if you take God at his word and discount him he's finished that's it remember just like Caleb they had to go he had to go kill Giants on his Mountain give me my Mountain Joshua it's yours he had to go fight it amen every long neck Giant on that mountain he he had to put to the sword because they are squatting on his promise amen and it's the same thing with you and I the devil doesn't want us to have joy he doesn't want us to have love you know the power of the spoken word is within you that creative power like it was in hady right like it was in that woman in Memphis that power is within you the same power that Ena Peter to walk on the water is in you that's right hallelujah amen it is in the bride of Christ it's not somewhere far away it's in you right now the impossible for the impossible to become manifested is within you hallelujah amen it's like the man with the prodical son it seemed impossible for that son ever to come home he made up in his mind long before he left that he wanted to leave and then finally says give me my inheritance I'm out of here I can't put up with this Holy Roller kind of kind of Lifestyle no more I want to go see the world his heart was set on it I believe his prayers created a desire in that prodical son's heart because when he was there in the pig pin it says and he came to himself well what happened God was answering the prayer of the father and the mother amen because they said no he is one of ours he has a covenant with God though he doesn't realize it he is a circumcised son of Abraham and he's coming home when's he coming home Papa I don't know that's God's job but he's coming home the same way he left us the same path he's going to walk back but he's going to be a different son amen so what happened is they took God at his word what thine and thy seed will be there amen I will put my word in you and your seed and your seed seed it says in Isaiah Hallelujah they took God at his word they took the promise of God said yes Lord this is my promise and I'm not settling for anything second I'm going to take this promise Lord I'm going to remind you of the promise amen because this is my promise amen your blood puts me in condition that this promise is mine it's the same thing with the blood of Jesus Christ his blood puts us in condition that every promise in the word is ours right now amen not not someday right now the promise is ours amen that's why we're going to take but then the devil says no you can't Merit it you don't deserve it it's not yours look at what you've done look what you allow to happen forget all that he's trying you to sit there in no man's land wondering if the promise is yours or not the promise is yours Jesus has given it to you like if I had a billion dollars I said who wants it man there would be a lot of unchristian behavior maybe people pushing each other out of the way isn't that right well hopefully not but you know if you go on the street man you get ripped apart you know people take the money off you because they see it's real and they say it's mine because he's given it to me doesn't matter where they come from what their name is age whatever know if that man's offering me a billion dollars and I see it in his hand I want it how real has these promises become how real has this word become it's become more real every year the promises of God become more tangible more manifested so what's God doing he's saying look all these promises are yours hallelujah hallelujah don't let the devil hold them back don't the devil say no they're not yours no it's like Jesus saying to Peter come I B you to come come and walk with me and that's what the Lord wants us he's bid us come walk amen oh but don't you know this about me the Lord knows everything okay he looked down just like our opening scripture and numbers there he saw everything that was happening in in Israel but yet he says I see no iniquity in these people there's no perverses there's nothing there's nothing bad their God is with them and the Shad of the king is among them hallelujah amen it's the same thing so he wants our love to abound more and more we got to realize every promise is ours now Hallelujah but the reason he wants our love to abound is that we would get more and more in knowledge and in all judgment okay what is the I I trust now to me when he's talking about knowledge here to me he's not talking about in the head he's talking about Revelation knowledge amen Godly knowledge right Godly wisdom and what has become to me what has become more apparent we're his we're his the power of the blood is becoming more apparent day by day amen the quickening power of the Holy Ghost amen the realities of God Amen they they're not diminishing they're becoming more real amen the more you look in the word the more you hear the message faith is building yeah faith is building amen the you're the promises one you maybe once upon a time they seem so far away how could that ever happen something within you says it's now it's for me who's had that kind of you know realization you realize I am a son or daughter of God I'm not hoping I am I am hallelujah hallelujah amen so what's happening now see see the love may bow more and more in knowledge and in all judgment so now if we realize who we are then the Devil comes along against us we can tell him to get oh yeah we can tell him to get lost he already is but get lost even more go jump in the lake devil am mean we can tell him that no this Covenant with God is with me and God he's not even in the picture that's it he's just the accuser of the Brethren he can accuse all he wants no I've got a blood tag amen I mean I've got the Holy Ghost I've got I've got a seal of a finished work in my life amen why because I believe the word something in me says this word is true something in me says this is not man's writings something in me says this is all inspired and the covers inspired also the Holy Bible That's inspired Hallelujah are you with me something in me says every promise is true every word is true and I can take God at his word amen that you may approve so I'm just going to repeat this again that you may approve things that are excellent that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ unto glory and praise of God God so your love abounding causes these things to come into place Glory who loves them more now who loves them more was it that is love abounding you know isn't it amazing we could say we are the answer to this prayer Glory I know there's been Believers down Through the Ages but this was God writing through the Apostle Paul I want your love to abound what does he do he he calls our love to abound amen now this word abound it has many different meanings but it means to see a fixed number of measure to be left over and above a certain number or measure so it's greater than a amount amen it's to exist or be at hand in abundance Hallelujah we have the abundance of the love of God Amen it's to be great amen it's one which comes in abundance or overflows unto one something that falls to the lot of one in large measure we're rich people brothers and sisters we're loaded with spiritual things we are rich we doesn't matter about natural riches we are rich in the things that matter Amen in spiritual things amen it means to it means to overflow to abundantly furnish with to have an abundance Amen to be in affluence to be preeminent to excel our lives are governed I trust your life is governed by the love of God amen amen it has preeminence in your life I mean you live the way you live because you love the Lord not because you have to not cuz it's expected because you love him amen it excels amen now this word so I'm just going through some definitions here that you may be sincere that word sincere means pure sincere unsullied found pure when unfolded and examined by the sunlight now it should be the s o n light this just the the dictionary definition but you know when we're examined by the sunlight like Peter was after the resurrection there's youo youo they're fishing all night they went back to their old life they're disappointed down asked and then they didn't catch anything and then they see a man on the seashore have you caught anything and John with his eagle eyes told Peter it's the Lord and Peter doesn't know how he's going to be what's going to happen he's denied the Lord three times he's got this lead weight kind of feeling going on because the one man the the one who thought would stand among the disciples maybe he thought man John's aissy Andrew's introverted you know Phillips like this Bartholomew oh sons of thunder you're right you know all stand and he miserably failed he's living under This Cloud but yet he sees the Lord on the sea he just jumps in and starts swimming towards them not knowing what's going to happen but there's something that just drew him to God hallelujah and it should be the same thing with you and I friends we may disappoint ourselves disappoint our family disappoint all kind of people disappoint the Lord but something always goes back to him Hallelujah and then he comes there then now now what's going to happen Peter Peter's sincerity is going to be examined by sunlight Peter do you love me Lord I love you feed my sheep Peter do you love me Lord I love you feed my Lambs Peter do you love me oh my Lord you know I love you Hallelujah what's happening his sincerity was examined by sunlight and Jesus didn't say no you're making that up Peter he knew Peter loved him and isn't it amazing you know we can we can start the day on on the fishing boat disappointed dejected downcast but then he comes and we go to him his presence comes you know what I'm talking about amen and then you speak to him in prayer or praise or what and then he speaks back to you hallelujah amen and you say Lord you know I love you Lord you know that you're my everything what's happening that your sincerity is being tested by sunlight and what does he say yes my child I know hallelujah amen and to be without offense this means not leading into sin sin is unbelief hallelujah amen that we may approve things that are excellent that we may be sincere and without offense so without anything that leads into unbelief till the day of Christ this is what the love abounding more and more does amen amen and and as our love abounds what happens the word becomes more positive the word becomes a greater reality I mean we can take God at his word we can believe for the impossible amen amen I believe I'm looking at people that can believe for the impossible tonight amen I believe I'm you I'm looking at a people that are built to believe for the impossible I mean for things that naturally seem they cannot happen something in you says I take you at your word Lord amen I take it your promises my God hallelujah amen praise the lord we just got to take him at his word hallelujah amen just like we have so many promises we can take God's word at we can take him at his word amen so I think we should more than anything in this day and age if your conscience tells you it's not true lay it aside if your reasoning says it can't happen lay it aside if your imagine ation doesn't imagine imagine God's word being fulfilled lay it aside lay aside everything that's contrary to God's word amen if your if your affection is telling you no there's nothing to this word lay it aside amen if the devil's telling you no you can never be free lay that lie aside amen lay it all aside take God at his word amen take God's word and take everything that's contrary and put it on a scales you know which one will hit the ground faster than anything it'll be God's word God's word outweighs anything the devil can put in our mind but we've got to work let Faith work am mean don't let reasoning work don't let trouble work don't let conscious work no let the word of God work well how do you do that you take him at his word that's nothing but the truth hallelujah amen praise the lord lord if it be thou bid me to come come yes he walked with them now how about you today the Lord wants you to walk with him what to fulfill his word let's have the musicians tonight I'm just going to finish there God wants us to take him at his word amen praise the lord we should never back up on any promise doesn't matter what other people have done with it they're not me amen doesn't what doesn't matter what other people done with the message they're not me okay it's God's word's true it works amen it does what it says it'll do it will not return to him void but will accomplish that which it has promised amen praise let's just pull that out one more time you know I stood in the Solomon Islands I took the scripture and then I just gave testimony after testimony of this in these four walls at Camp different lives I said God's word says he's a deliverer this is a Deliverance God says he's a Healer he's testimony after testimony God said he'll bring the protocols home Hallelujah I just went through testimony after testimony I said look God's word will not return to him void it will accomplish that which he purposed it will do amen and our God hasn't changed he hasn't taken his he hasn't changed his mind about his word he hasn't said it can't happen no he's already ordained it amen his word is but he's looking for a response he's looking for us to lay aside all the reasoning all the doubt all the questions all and say no Lord I take you at your word because that's all I can do like Abraham he could have reasoned all the day long why he couldn't have a child but he believed God I mean he took God at his word said yes Lord that's nothing but the truth I will have Isaac we will have the promised son amen and he counted everything else as falsehood he didn't even consider it no he didn't stagger at the promise of God but his strong giving God praise amen why cuz he judged God faithful praise the Lord amen let's let um let's stand tonight and let's sing that song um say to this mountain um out my God's bigger greater stronger than you who believes that tonight amen we can take God at his word isn't it exciting you think God can do anything God can do anything in our lives amen he can do more than what we could even imagine being the miraculous hallelujah our god can do anything tonight amen why would I worry when Giants come calling my name amen David actually identified who Goliath really was Goliath thought I'm Goliath of G look I'm some big giant and David said this is an uncircumcised Philistine this is this guy this no he has this reputation but this is what he really is he took God at his word because remember Goliath had no Covenant with God he had no promise he wasn't one of God's covenant people but David was amen so cuz God was in Covenant with David then David knew hey this Giant's going to fall amen Goliath intimidated him with all kinds of things how do you come what what am I a dog you come with me sticks and stones and all you know all these things I'm going to feed your I'm going to feed you to the birds all these things and David said no you defy the armies of the Living God Amen he had a revelation that it wasn't the armies of Israel that Goliath was fa defying it was the armies of the Living God I mean if we realize we are an extension just like an army is an extension of a king right like so the men of David were an extension of David and so the army of the Living God an extension of God I mean so what is the bride of Christ it's the extend it's God upon the Earth right where God can live through human beings once again so why should we worry when Giants come calling our name my God is so much bigger than all these troubles I face amen let's thinging shall [Music] we why would I worry when Giants come
