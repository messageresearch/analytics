========================================

[Music] I love you, Lord, for your mercy never fails me. All my days I've been held in your hands. From the moment that I wake up until I lay my head. Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God. [Music] All my life. You have been faithful. All my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God. I love your voice. [Music] You have led me through the fire in darkest night. You are close like no other. I've known you as a father. I've known you as a friend. And I have lived in the goodness of God. [Music] All my life you have been faithful. All my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, I will sing. All the goodness of God. Your goodness is running after. It's running after me. Your goodness is running after. It's running after me. With my life laid down, I'm surrendered now. I give you everything. Your goodness is running after. It's running after me. [Music] All my life you have been faithful. [Music] All my life you have been so so good. [Music] Of every that I am able. I will sing of the goodness of God. I will sing of the goodness of God. [Music] [Applause]
