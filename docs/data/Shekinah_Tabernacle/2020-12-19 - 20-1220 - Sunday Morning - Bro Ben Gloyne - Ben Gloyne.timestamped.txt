[10:28] praise the lord good morning everyone
[10:32] how are you that was a direct question
[10:36] to everybody individually
[10:37] [Music]
[10:39] [Laughter]
[10:43] it feels good it's good to be in the
[10:46] house of the lord again
[10:48] to be with saints and to have an
[10:50] opportunity to
[10:51] be able to praise the lord this morning
[10:55] i was getting some songs together last
[10:56] night
[10:59] um and i thought to myself
[11:02] this is the last service that i'm doing
[11:04] before christmas
[11:05] [Music]
[11:09] and you all know how i feel about
[11:12] christmas
[11:14] christmas is my most favorite time of
[11:16] the year
[11:18] you know because it's like for this
[11:21] brief
[11:22] moment in time you get as close to what
[11:24] heaven will be like as
[11:25] is humanly possible on this earth you
[11:27] say well how is that
[11:29] like because in heaven we don't have to
[11:31] work and we can all just relax
[11:33] and it's like a constant festive season
[11:36] so over here we kind of all save our
[11:40] money and the companies will save their
[11:41] money and then everyone has a holiday
[11:42] and they all
[11:43] can all sort of live and pretend that
[11:45] life is wonderful and that just
[11:46] you can just live without being paid and
[11:48] not having to work and things you know
[11:50] it's true and you you look around you
[11:52] know like the 26th 27th 28th you go to
[11:55] the petrol station everyone's happy
[11:57] you go to the the wherever you go to
[12:00] people are happy because they can they
[12:01] don't have to work anymore
[12:03] you know we just pretend that the curse
[12:05] isn't around for a little while and then
[12:07] on top of that there's like these
[12:08] christmas carols playing in the
[12:10] supermarket and different places you go
[12:12] not so much as what they used to be but
[12:14] you know it's the only when
[12:15] when and during any other part of the
[12:18] year do you hear a song about jesus
[12:21] in paper plus or pack and save or
[12:24] somewhere
[12:25] you don't hear it right but christmas
[12:26] they kind of have to because it's
[12:29] well even our dating system declares it
[12:31] the year of our lord 2020
[12:34] and but i grew up in the 80s
[12:38] not like the 80s were very christian but
[12:40] where i was it kind of was because we
[12:41] were out in a
[12:43] little country community and actually a
[12:45] majority of the people in the community
[12:46] were christians so
[12:48] the school i would say 50 of the
[12:50] children at school were christian
[12:52] so we grew up singing christmas carols
[12:55] all the time like at christmas time but
[12:58] i kind of worry these days because all
[12:59] of these young fellows here that go to
[13:00] school
[13:01] probably they probably think christmas
[13:03] carols are like
[13:05] rudolph the red-nosed reindeer or jingle
[13:08] bells or
[13:09] i saw mummy kissing santa claus or some
[13:12] nonsense like that you know
[13:13] those aren't christmas carols you young
[13:15] fellas
[13:16] that slop so
[13:20] i thought i'm going to like push the
[13:23] christmas carols you know so it kind of
[13:25] ingrains into the little children and
[13:26] ingrains in our memory this is what this
[13:28] is what these are the songs we sing
[13:31] and i don't really mind that this is not
[13:33] the year actual time of the lord's birth
[13:35] and all that it's kind of like
[13:36] hey my mind can pass that and say well
[13:39] this is what we allocate it
[13:40] this is where we'll just the general
[13:42] public put it here so hey who really
[13:43] cares it that's
[13:45] it it doesn't really matter it's it's
[13:47] the and people say well we don't
[13:48] you know the lord didn't say to
[13:51] celebrate his birth but he didn't say
[13:52] not to
[13:54] and it was a momentous occasion it's
[13:55] probably the most important person that
[13:56] was ever born
[13:58] like so i ranked the day that he was
[14:02] born quite a
[14:02] powerful day a very powerful day and i
[14:06] love the
[14:06] my most favorite line in a song ever in
[14:09] the existence of the world is probably
[14:11] i think it's um silent night and it's
[14:14] the line
[14:16] i'll just get that i'll just get the
[14:18] verse because this is such a
[14:20] um that's the second verse of silent
[14:23] night
[14:26] no third verse here it is
[14:31] and the fourth line of the song is
[14:32] probably my most favorite line ever in
[14:34] existence silent night holy night
[14:36] son of god loves pure light radiant
[14:38] beams from thy holy face
[14:40] with the dawn of redeeming grace because
[14:44] that's what it was you know
[14:45] there's something dawned and it was
[14:46] redeeming grace was dawning and it
[14:48] then of course the the the outcome
[14:52] wasn't
[14:53] wasn't all roses and pretty because he
[14:55] had to actually
[14:56] die horrible death on the cross but it
[14:59] was the dawn of redeeming grace
[15:01] so let's um i'm going to ask brother ben
[15:06] bailey to open in prayer this morning i

[40:11] like to ask my wife to come up here
[40:32] she hadn't known she was going to come
[40:34] over here don't need a hinbu you know
[40:38] this song
[40:45] i really need some volume you don't mind
[40:54] [Applause]
[41:13] amen i just realized that this is the
[41:15] last sunday before christmas
[41:19] brother isaac reminded us of that amen
[41:22] so this song here is a personal
[41:25] testimony to me
[41:29] i hadn't planned to sing it but there's
[41:32] a way i feel
[41:33] just since every sense you get pushed
[41:36] and pushed and pushed
[41:38] like a fire uh does that preach
[41:42] that sing or know what i'm talking about
[41:44] amen
[41:47] now this song i've sung it before but i
[41:50] haven't sung it playing the guitar
[41:52] i'll play the guitar because there's a
[41:54] certain way it rises and falls there's a
[41:56] certain bit
[41:58] i follow amen so if i sing it with the
[42:01] choir
[42:02] they play very well but i need to
[42:05] practice with them first to understand
[42:07] how it costs otherwise
[42:09] i might go too slow or you might feel
[42:11] you're going too fast so
[42:14] amen now we
[42:17] i'm singing about waiting upon the lord
[42:20] i will take it right back to the
[42:22] beginning when god spoke the word into
[42:24] creation amen
[42:26] he said let there be and he waited
[42:30] would you imagine if god had said let
[42:32] there be the light
[42:34] let there be the moon and he started
[42:36] worrying about it
[42:38] is the moon coming i spoke it where is
[42:41] the moon
[42:42] brother branham was told by god just
[42:44] speak the word
[42:45] what is it exactly that you want and he
[42:47] said squirrels
[42:48] where do you want the squid how many do
[42:50] you want be specific
[42:52] i want three where do you want them to
[42:54] come from
[42:55] the first one will come this way the
[42:57] second one that way
[42:58] it was that third one that was a problem
[43:02] he started doubting god now he's getting
[43:04] dark
[43:05] and this third squirrel has not appeared
[43:07] sup
[43:08] if it appears and it's darker am i gonna
[43:10] be able to shoot it
[43:12] lord i know your weight is true but
[43:15] just two would be enough god said no
[43:19] you said three so you shall have
[43:23] three now i don't know
[43:26] why i'm singing this song but i'm sure
[43:28] someone there
[43:29] there's someone who is prayed for
[43:31] something you asked god for something
[43:34] it hasn't materialized yet amen
[43:38] so you're starting to worry oh it's
[43:40] getting to christmas
[43:42] before we know it is 20 21 and i'm still
[43:45] waiting

[1:01:41] two so not this wednesday but next

[1:01:48] watch night so that'll be
[1:01:50] the following day or whatever the
[1:01:52] calendar sees they mean
[1:01:54] let's go to luke chapter two
[1:02:01] and it came to pass you turn me down a
[1:02:04] bit there by the raman please
[1:02:06] and it came to pass in those days that
[1:02:09] there went out a decree from caesar
[1:02:11] augustus
[1:02:12] that all the world should be taxed and
[1:02:14] this taxing was first made
[1:02:16] when cyrenius was governor of syria and
[1:02:18] all went to be taxed everyone
[1:02:20] into his own city and joseph also went
[1:02:23] up from galilee
[1:02:24] out of the city of nazareth into judea
[1:02:27] unto the city of david which is called
[1:02:29] bethlehem
[1:02:30] because he was of the house and lineage
[1:02:32] of david to be
[1:02:34] taxed with his with mary has a spouse
[1:02:36] wife being great
[1:02:38] with child and so it was that while they
[1:02:41] were there the days were accomplished
[1:02:43] that she should be delivered
[1:02:44] and she brought forth her firstborn son
[1:02:47] and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and
[1:02:49] laid him in a manger
[1:02:50] because there was no room for them in
[1:02:52] the end
[1:02:54] and we're going to jump to first
[1:02:56] corinthians 6 and 19 just as a bit of a
[1:02:59] context i'm here can you oh are we

[1:03:50] can you just turn it down a bit which is
[1:03:52] in you which ye have of god and ye are

[1:06:11] morning hallelujah
[1:06:13] praise the lord we've been trying to get
[1:06:14] them to sing for a while but i you know
[1:06:16] thank the lord that they
[1:06:18] amen so we've read here
[1:06:21] um from from luke
[1:06:25] luke 2 and i know this is a christmas
[1:06:26] season but i want to just talk about the
[1:06:29] manger i want to talk about the
[1:06:30] where where jesus was born and i just
[1:06:33] want to maybe just
[1:06:34] uh you know the prophet tells us we're
[1:06:37] one in a million
[1:06:39] we're one in a million we're special
[1:06:41] we're special to god you know we're not
[1:06:43] we're not just haphazardly you know god
[1:06:46] god think highest he could think of
[1:06:47] anyone he thinks about you and i
[1:06:49] hallelujah he doesn't just think oh just
[1:06:51] that that's just another
[1:06:52] christian average person whoever no no
[1:06:54] he thinks he's the we are the apple of
[1:06:56] his eye
[1:06:57] we are special to him his whole plan of
[1:06:59] redemption is wrapped around you
[1:07:01] his whole purpose of being to express
[1:07:03] himself is wrapped around you
[1:07:04] we are important to god we're incredibly
[1:07:07] important
[1:07:08] i mean he put he put your life above the
[1:07:10] value of his own life
[1:07:12] right he you know his sister shannon
[1:07:13] gave that yo did the skit at camp and
[1:07:15] said you know we're worth more than
[1:07:16] worlds or money or gold or
[1:07:18] you know anything could be given he gave
[1:07:20] his own life because there was nothing
[1:07:21] more he could pay
[1:07:22] i mean to redeem us what was his own
[1:07:25] blood so
[1:07:26] you know whenever the devil comes along
[1:07:27] and says you're worthless and you know
[1:07:29] you're good for nothing you never amount
[1:07:30] to anything
[1:07:31] just tell them devil you've come too
[1:07:33] late because god put a value on my soul
[1:07:36] and it was greater than his own life
[1:07:38] it was greater than his own existence
[1:07:40] hallelujah was the value he put
[1:07:42] on on my soul amen because we know if he
[1:07:45] would go for calvary if he had to go to
[1:07:48] calvary for one he would have gone for
[1:07:49] one
[1:07:50] right if he you know if if if brother
[1:07:53] branham if elijah was sent
[1:07:55] upon the earth and the end time to
[1:07:56] rapture one he would have gone through
[1:07:59] the ministry all the same he would have
[1:08:00] preached all the same it was just for
[1:08:02] one soul
[1:08:02] he would have got god would have caused
[1:08:04] him to go through it all hallelujah so
[1:08:06] you know we're very valuable to god
[1:08:08] we're a special kind of people you say
[1:08:10] well that's very proud no no i'm saying
[1:08:12] that because he told me i'm special
[1:08:13] and if he told me i'm special i'm
[1:08:15] special hallelujah
[1:08:17] i'm not too interested really what other
[1:08:19] people think about me but if he says i'm
[1:08:21] special
[1:08:22] i'm special if he says you're the jewel
[1:08:24] in my crown
[1:08:25] i'm special hallelujah you know i'm sure
[1:08:28] no husband here would yo
[1:08:30] you know down you know yo yo treads
[1:08:31] their wife down says they're good for
[1:08:33] nothing says they're useless no we never
[1:08:35] say that
[1:08:35] because that's not our heart to them we
[1:08:37] think they're the greatest you know
[1:08:38] we're their biggest fan
[1:08:39] i tell christine i'm your biggest fan
[1:08:41] hallelujah i want to get a t-shirt made
[1:08:43] or something you know but
[1:08:44] i'm a biggest fan hallelujah you know
[1:08:46] but that's what we think about our wives
[1:08:48] i'm sure brothers say amen you know we
[1:08:50] think they're the greatest they're you
[1:08:51] know they're the best and
[1:08:52] and that's what the lord thinks about us
[1:08:55] we're a very special kind of people
[1:08:57] harley and now it's amazing where you
[1:08:59] know you know we look at the scene here
[1:09:01] and you know there's
[1:09:02] there's there's um things are happening
[1:09:04] and you'd think that you know
[1:09:06] god if he would really cause it to
[1:09:08] happen you know
[1:09:09] why would mary have to take that hard
[1:09:11] journey on you know you know the
[1:09:12] donkey's back all the way from nazareth
[1:09:14] down to bethlehem and you know she's
[1:09:15] about to be delivered and
[1:09:17] would have been a difficult journey even
[1:09:19] even you know you know in
[1:09:20] in today's standings with our cars and
[1:09:22] everything you know you're about to be
[1:09:24] delivered you don't want to go driving
[1:09:25] around anywhere
[1:09:26] you know so it would have been a
[1:09:27] difficult kind of journey but you know
[1:09:29] god knows how to orchestrate world
[1:09:31] events
[1:09:31] for his word to come to pass yeah so
[1:09:34] nothing that's happening today is out of
[1:09:36] cater right we see the world's falling
[1:09:38] apart you know there's a great
[1:09:40] i want to preach on it one day there's a
[1:09:42] scripture i think it's in habakkuk where
[1:09:43] there'll be a like a whole net
[1:09:45] that will steer the whole earth and
[1:09:48] we have the world wide web
[1:09:51] right brother brown speaks about how
[1:09:53] women are caught in a web of fashion
[1:09:55] and they can't get out there's a web
[1:09:57] that's trying to entangle
[1:09:59] souls but uh you know i'm so thankful
[1:10:01] that we're built in a certain way we can
[1:10:03] get through that net
[1:10:05] you know some fish can get through the
[1:10:06] net you know hallelujah
[1:10:09] we're built a certain way to get through
[1:10:10] the net amen but you know
[1:10:13] there's a lot of things going on in this
[1:10:14] day and age but god is here to fulfill
[1:10:16] his word
[1:10:17] and just like in the first christmas you
[1:10:20] know i was thinking about christmas the
[1:10:21] word christmas is a
[1:10:22] is a mess it's a you know it's a
[1:10:23] catholic tradition that word christmas
[1:10:25] and it's basically you know mass you
[1:10:27] know you know i may have it wrong but
[1:10:29] it's basically you're kind of communing
[1:10:30] with the dead
[1:10:32] it's a mess but christmas we're not
[1:10:34] communing with a dead person
[1:10:36] we're communing with a resurrected jesus
[1:10:38] christ so it's not a
[1:10:39] it's not a worship of a dead person
[1:10:41] people say well jesus died but he rose
[1:10:43] again
[1:10:44] and he's alive today amen he's alive
[1:10:46] this morning so
[1:10:47] you know to me i think brother braham
[1:10:49] said yo christmas should be such a
[1:10:51] worship
[1:10:52] and he says that santa claus you know
[1:10:54] has been put out before the people
[1:10:55] to take all the worship from jesus
[1:10:57] christ and you know there's nothing
[1:10:58] wrong with presence and everything we
[1:11:00] give presents whatever more we have
[1:11:02] tinsel and all those things but you know
[1:11:03] we should never let it diminish the true
[1:11:05] worship of christmas
[1:11:07] you know as i say the reason for the
[1:11:09] season he's the reason for the season
[1:11:11] and he's the reason for the season of
[1:11:12] redemption as well so here we have this
[1:11:15] difficult kind of scene brother brown
[1:11:16] dramatized it in many places and you
[1:11:18] know
[1:11:18] you know he had to you know this this
[1:11:20] decree came out and mary was about to
[1:11:22] have the child they had to travel down
[1:11:24] to bethlehem and you know it was a
[1:11:26] difficult kind of journey they you know
[1:11:27] they went real slow and
[1:11:29] you know mary would even ask joseph
[1:11:31] sometimes you know do you want to go
[1:11:32] do you want to ride on the donkey's back
[1:11:34] and he says no no no sweetheart you just
[1:11:36] stay right there and
[1:11:37] you know then they begin to see a star
[1:11:39] rise and you know they
[1:11:40] they were looking at that and joseph
[1:11:41] said honey have you seen that star and
[1:11:43] you know
[1:11:43] she would say you know i've been
[1:11:45] watching that since you know you know
[1:11:46] for a couple of hours now and it was
[1:11:48] those
[1:11:48] those stars coming together to give that
[1:11:50] star bethlehem and
[1:11:52] we know there are wise men that were
[1:11:53] looking for that star and you know what
[1:11:54] i love about
[1:11:56] you know i love about this here where
[1:11:58] you know maybe we'll read about the
[1:11:59] shepherds later but you know
[1:12:01] a true star of god will take you to
[1:12:03] where christ is in your day
[1:12:05] we've had a star rise a seventh angel in
[1:12:07] this day
[1:12:08] and he pointed us to where christ is in
[1:12:10] his word and it's just like the
[1:12:12] shepherds they were they were led the
[1:12:14] angels the angels visited them and said
[1:12:16] you will find them in a manger
[1:12:18] and it's amazing they found him in a
[1:12:19] manger they found they didn't find
[1:12:22] nothing they didn't find a stable with
[1:12:24] just animals and a manger
[1:12:26] they found the word made flesh in the
[1:12:28] manger where the angel said
[1:12:30] that they would find him and it's the
[1:12:32] same thing we've had a seventh angel
[1:12:33] speaking this day
[1:12:34] and he's instructed us exactly where to
[1:12:36] find jesus in his word
[1:12:38] and we went we heard the angel's message
[1:12:40] we we obeyed the angel's message and
[1:12:42] what did we find
[1:12:43] christ hallelujah not a story not a
[1:12:46] tradition but christ the resurrected
[1:12:48] jesus christ the living word
[1:12:50] he pointed us rights he say how do you
[1:12:52] know this message is true
[1:12:54] because it pointed me to a resurrected
[1:12:56] jesus christ
[1:12:57] and it's not to a story or a god of
[1:12:59] history but a living god today
[1:13:01] and i've met that one what did the
[1:13:03] shepherd say after they met the lord
[1:13:04] there in the
[1:13:05] in the stable they went everywhere
[1:13:06] saying we've seen the messiah we've seen
[1:13:08] the messiah he's born hallelujah angels
[1:13:10] met us on the field
[1:13:12] and we went exactly where we're told to
[1:13:13] go and we found him
[1:13:15] hallelujah they didn't find something
[1:13:17] different they found exactly what the
[1:13:18] angel
[1:13:19] told them they would find they found the
[1:13:21] baby christ hallelujah
[1:13:23] and it's the same thing today this
[1:13:25] message the seventh angel messenger
[1:13:27] pointed us to where christ
[1:13:28] is and i've i've seen him
[1:13:32] he's alive hallelujah so that's why it's
[1:13:35] a glorious christmas season hallelujah
[1:13:37] you know those wise men they would be
[1:13:39] they'd be journeying brother ramsey it
[1:13:40] took them two years to get from
[1:13:42] you know where they were in the east and
[1:13:44] you know they were studying the stars
[1:13:45] being made giant different things and
[1:13:47] you know it took them two years to go
[1:13:48] there and he says the reason is that
[1:13:50] because herod
[1:13:51] instructed that the boy male children
[1:13:53] from two years and down had to be killed
[1:13:55] in bethlehem
[1:13:56] but they they kept traveling they were
[1:13:58] following that star and to me wise men
[1:14:00] still seek him
[1:14:02] right you can still find him you know
[1:14:03] they were they were caught up there were
[1:14:05] many different constellations but
[1:14:06] brother ram says
[1:14:07] that that that that one particular night
[1:14:09] there was a visitor in the heavens
[1:14:11] and they say oh i wonder what this one
[1:14:13] is and then they begin to
[1:14:14] because they were trained by daniel
[1:14:16] because he instructed the wise men of
[1:14:18] babylon
[1:14:19] this was generations before them but but
[1:14:21] you know that knowledge was passed down
[1:14:22] and they opened up the scripture and
[1:14:24] they would go to numbers and balaam
[1:14:26] you know to me this is phenomenal here's
[1:14:28] a false prophet
[1:14:30] and he prophesies that a star will rise
[1:14:32] out of jacob
[1:14:33] yeah but but the anointing item was true
[1:14:36] that's why it's in the scripture that's
[1:14:37] why we don't throw it out because the
[1:14:38] anointing on them was true
[1:14:40] and that prophecy came to pass because
[1:14:42] those wise men no doubt they read that
[1:14:43] scripture
[1:14:44] and a star would rise out of jacob then
[1:14:46] they would read you know
[1:14:48] in another section where the scepter
[1:14:49] will not depart from judea till shiloh
[1:14:51] comes and your king would rise out of
[1:14:53] judah
[1:14:54] so they saw that star and then they said
[1:14:55] well you know according to this
[1:14:57] scripture we've just read
[1:14:58] that's been passed down to us that many
[1:15:01] people long to see but we live in the
[1:15:02] season of it
[1:15:03] the king of the jews is born upon the
[1:15:05] earth and then they begin to you know
[1:15:07] you know load up their camels get ready
[1:15:09] for the journey and you know
[1:15:10] brother man makes a statement how
[1:15:12] there's um one of the wise men you know
[1:15:14] you know he tries to take his old life
[1:15:16] with him
[1:15:16] so he puts on his card table and his you
[1:15:19] know drinks and all these different kind
[1:15:21] of things and if we
[1:15:22] kind of brought it into today's language
[1:15:24] he tries to put his xbox on there and
[1:15:25] his computer games and his netflix and
[1:15:27] all those things and his tick-tock and
[1:15:29] you know tries to pack those on the
[1:15:31] camel but the camel gets so burdened
[1:15:32] down
[1:15:33] it just collapses it can't move you
[1:15:35] can't bring your old self with you
[1:15:37] so then he starts throwing it all off
[1:15:39] throwing it all off and his wife says
[1:15:41] honey don't you need those things
[1:15:42] there's no
[1:15:43] i've got to laugh at every weight and
[1:15:45] every sin i've seen a star in the west
[1:15:47] and i've come yo i've got to follow that
[1:15:49] start of the christ child
[1:15:50] hallelujah so so he unburdened his life
[1:15:52] and it's such a good thing
[1:15:54] just jettison stuff that holds you down
[1:15:57] just chop it let it go
[1:15:59] oh but i love that stuff chop it let it
[1:16:01] go you'll find a far greater thing
[1:16:03] hallelujah and we are there we got
[1:16:05] testimonies of that in this room
[1:16:07] hallelujah so you know then they
[1:16:09] followed that star
[1:16:10] and then of course but in their mind
[1:16:12] they're like well we need to go to
[1:16:14] jerusalem
[1:16:15] to find out where he's going to be born
[1:16:17] but if you read in the scripture we
[1:16:18] i don't think we have time to read it
[1:16:20] now but you gotta read the account when
[1:16:21] they go into jerusalem
[1:16:23] they don't see that star anymore the
[1:16:26] place they should have gone now this
[1:16:27] ties into being a manger and
[1:16:30] things because you know we read about
[1:16:31] how we're a temple of the living god
[1:16:34] and when god says no to a place it's
[1:16:36] because he's saying no
[1:16:37] i can't be born here i've got to be born
[1:16:39] in a place that reflects me
[1:16:42] and so so they go to jerusalem they
[1:16:44] think well this is this is surely
[1:16:46] they'll know where he'll be because this
[1:16:48] is the religious headquarters of the
[1:16:49] nation
[1:16:50] but when they go in there the star
[1:16:52] basically disappears
[1:16:54] because they've gone to a place where
[1:16:56] man is just filled with tradition
[1:16:58] and it's amazing because here here is
[1:17:00] the center of the you know here's the
[1:17:01] center of the country
[1:17:03] or of the world that should have
[1:17:05] actually seen that star
[1:17:06] should have been looking for it and when
[1:17:08] they come into the city saying where is
[1:17:10] he born king of the jews
[1:17:11] it says everyone was amazed what is this
[1:17:14] noise these strangers are making what's
[1:17:15] all this going on all this tamil
[1:17:17] these people are looking for the king of
[1:17:19] the jews what do you mean what's going
[1:17:20] on
[1:17:20] and they go and talk to herod and the
[1:17:22] wise men and you know and then they go
[1:17:24] and it's amazing because they go into
[1:17:25] the scripture themselves the scribes and
[1:17:27] pharisees
[1:17:29] and they say well he'll be born in
[1:17:30] bethlehem according to the scripture
[1:17:33] they didn't go down to bethlehem to see
[1:17:34] if he was there you think
[1:17:36] he has these three visitors crying out
[1:17:39] through the streets and alleys through
[1:17:40] jerusalem where is he born king of the
[1:17:42] jews you know
[1:17:43] expecting that they would know where he
[1:17:44] is and they have no idea where he is and
[1:17:46] what's going on
[1:17:48] and then and then they go and take the
[1:17:50] scripture and say well he'll be born in
[1:17:51] bethlehem and we know
[1:17:52] herod was a murderer anyway so he says
[1:17:54] you know you go find him come back and
[1:17:57] i'll come worship him
[1:17:58] you know if he was a real believer he
[1:18:00] would have been the first one in the
[1:18:01] front of the caravan
[1:18:02] you'd think jerusalem would have been
[1:18:03] emptied out every man woman dog you know
[1:18:07] every man and his dog and you know
[1:18:08] saying it that way they would have gone
[1:18:10] to bethlehem to see where the lord was
[1:18:13] but they didn't go and then so but then
[1:18:16] you read in the scripture when they come
[1:18:17] out of jerusalem they start making their
[1:18:19] way to bethlehem then the tsar
[1:18:20] appeared again because the traditions of
[1:18:23] man
[1:18:24] is like clouds which blocked the star
[1:18:26] light but once they got out of those
[1:18:28] traditions they could see where the star
[1:18:29] was and the star led them straight to
[1:18:31] where the christ was
[1:18:32] hallelujah and then the and then the
[1:18:34] wise men before they left
[1:18:36] where they came from in the east they
[1:18:38] they packed gifts
[1:18:41] that that was a revelation to them of
[1:18:43] what this man
[1:18:44] what this child would do we know they
[1:18:46] had they had gold frankincense and myrrh
[1:18:50] and it wasn't just because they were
[1:18:51] costly gifts but it was actually a
[1:18:53] representative
[1:18:54] of what what this baby messiah was going
[1:18:57] to achieve
[1:18:58] they had a revelation gold gold is deity
[1:19:01] so they had a revelation this was more
[1:19:02] than just a man
[1:19:04] but this was a god man being born deity
[1:19:07] made flesh heaven and earth became one
[1:19:09] hallelujah and then the frankincense is
[1:19:12] always mixed with prayer in the old
[1:19:13] testament so i was putting
[1:19:14] deity in the flesh now now he's going
[1:19:17] into service
[1:19:18] remember he came not to be ministered to
[1:19:20] but to minister
[1:19:21] right so you know that's what jesus says
[1:19:23] jesus said i haven't come that people
[1:19:25] would serve me
[1:19:26] i've come to serve the world right but
[1:19:28] then myrrh is a
[1:19:29] is a is a anointing spice food for the
[1:19:32] dead
[1:19:33] so they realize that death deity would
[1:19:35] become flesh
[1:19:36] and put into service to die for humanity
[1:19:39] that was their revelation
[1:19:41] and they and and then when they went to
[1:19:43] the place that should have known
[1:19:45] what this baby was going to perform they
[1:19:46] were the most surprised in jerusalem
[1:19:53] and so now here we are
[1:19:56] coming back joseph and mary are going
[1:19:59] down
[1:20:00] to bethlehem now as i said we're special
[1:20:03] people
[1:20:04] has jesus told you you're special you're
[1:20:07] the apple of his eye
[1:20:09] amen he'll bankrupt heaven before he
[1:20:11] lets you be lost
[1:20:12] amen he would rather you know that's how
[1:20:14] important you are to him
[1:20:16] his whole plan is hinged on you getting
[1:20:18] there you're going to get there
[1:20:21] jesus is going to get me there
[1:20:23] hallelujah
[1:20:24] how's it going to happen he'll get me
[1:20:25] there it's amazing here you know i
[1:20:28] i've been thinking about it you know
[1:20:30] imagine if
[1:20:31] if if we were there in the days of you
[1:20:33] know mary and joseph going down to
[1:20:35] bethlehem remember a lot of people were
[1:20:36] traveling
[1:20:38] and there here's a very pregnant woman
[1:20:40] on a donkey and a man is leading
[1:20:42] them they didn't look like anyone
[1:20:45] different
[1:20:46] there probably wasn't some great big
[1:20:48] aura like the hollywood movies trying to
[1:20:50] say some great you know they were just
[1:20:51] common looking people
[1:20:53] walking on the road but here was
[1:20:56] the greatest event god
[1:21:00] becoming man to redeem humanity
[1:21:03] that that that was prophesied of just
[1:21:05] just after the fall the first prophecy
[1:21:07] ever to come was that
[1:21:08] the seed of the woman was going to
[1:21:10] bruise the head of the seed of the
[1:21:12] serpent
[1:21:12] that a man was going to come and undo
[1:21:14] everything that just happened
[1:21:15] and here he was he was about to be
[1:21:17] delivered and he's just a man
[1:21:20] and a woman and a donkey going down the
[1:21:22] road
[1:21:23] maybe some great big carriages went past
[1:21:26] them
[1:21:26] maybe they had to pull off sometimes you
[1:21:28] know it's just like people don't change
[1:21:30] there's people who speed and there's
[1:21:32] people who cruise along on the road
[1:21:34] but imagine they maybe had to pull off
[1:21:36] the side of the road some great big
[1:21:37] carriages turning past and
[1:21:39] all these big white chargers and they're
[1:21:40] thinking they're you know they're the
[1:21:42] bees knees they've got it all together
[1:21:43] and they just nearly run over hallelujah
[1:21:47] the foster father and foster mother of
[1:21:50] emmanuel
[1:21:52] who she is carrying so i
[1:21:55] often think you know god you know he's
[1:21:58] so glorious
[1:21:59] he's so incredible you know he fills
[1:22:02] brother ram says hundred billion times
[1:22:03] of light space you go out into the
[1:22:05] eternal and then there's god you know
[1:22:07] but yet how he reveals himself is very
[1:22:10] different we think of this god of great
[1:22:12] glory who just said let there be sun
[1:22:14] moon and stars and
[1:22:15] here it is but yet brother ram says what
[1:22:18] makes him so
[1:22:19] great is because he can make himself so
[1:22:22] little
[1:22:23] and how easy it would have been for
[1:22:24] people just to walk right past maybe
[1:22:26] would have had some
[1:22:27] sympathy maybe we're thinking why are
[1:22:29] they traveling at this day you know what
[1:22:30] irresponsible
[1:22:31] father and different things and you know
[1:22:33] these people look so poor and you know
[1:22:35] maybe keep away from them they might you
[1:22:36] know but
[1:22:37] here was god coming
[1:22:40] to where he was pre-destined to be born
[1:22:43] in this place is everyone i'm about to
[1:22:45] close
[1:22:48] everyone's awake again good stay with me
[1:22:52] lunch will happen really well
[1:22:57] but here you know here they are coming
[1:22:59] down the greatest man
[1:23:00] is going to be born upon the earth and
[1:23:02] this is how he's being transported down
[1:23:04] here
[1:23:05] you know but god he's so great he can
[1:23:07] make himself so little
[1:23:09] amen and so here he was now to me now
[1:23:11] now this is just
[1:23:12] just me and my little mind just just
[1:23:14] dramatizing it but you know
[1:23:16] bethlehem was full of people and maybe
[1:23:20] and so and so the lord knows where he's
[1:23:22] going to be born remember when
[1:23:24] when when the prophecy came that he'd be
[1:23:27] born in bethlehem
[1:23:29] god wasn't wondering do you think it
[1:23:31] would be a stable
[1:23:33] do you think of being in maybe someone's
[1:23:35] house do you think they'll even make it
[1:23:36] to the city
[1:23:37] no he knew the stable he was going to be
[1:23:39] born in because it represented a part of
[1:23:42] his character to be born because
[1:23:43] remember lambs aren't born in inns
[1:23:45] they're not born in palaces brother
[1:23:47] brown would tell us that you know
[1:23:48] sure there were better places in the
[1:23:50] nation for the king of glory to be born
[1:23:52] there were the palaces in jerusalem
[1:23:54] you know they're great cities of refuge
[1:23:56] there's great places but
[1:23:57] he bypassed all of them because a lamb
[1:24:00] could never be born in those kind of
[1:24:02] places a lamb had to be born in a stable
[1:24:04] and so now and he also said you know
[1:24:07] that's stable and the people that came
[1:24:09] into that stable
[1:24:10] i mean we're actually reflecting god
[1:24:12] himself as well could you imagine the
[1:24:14] high priest
[1:24:15] with his wonderful clean robes walking
[1:24:17] into a manure full stable
[1:24:20] to see the christ no that would
[1:24:23] embarrass him
[1:24:24] he wouldn't yo i just got this tailored
[1:24:27] this is the finest silk from
[1:24:29] carthage or somewhere you know i'm not
[1:24:31] going to get this dirty in this place
[1:24:33] i'm not going to come see him there it
[1:24:35] would embarrass me
[1:24:36] and a lot of people feel that kind of
[1:24:38] way you know brother brown tells a story
[1:24:40] of
[1:24:40] um uh i think it's taught in the time of
[1:24:43] slavery i might be wrong but there was a
[1:24:45] there was a brother mo's and you know he
[1:24:46] got gloriously saved
[1:24:48] and he told his boss boss i got saved i
[1:24:50] got real heartfelt religion
[1:24:52] and he'd be testifying and things and
[1:24:54] you know he was getting he was salty so
[1:24:56] his boss started to get thirsty
[1:24:58] and so he said you know his boss said to
[1:25:00] him you know most i want that heartfelt
[1:25:02] religion too
[1:25:03] and then and then you know where can i
[1:25:04] get it and then and then they
[1:25:07] go to a hay loft and they go to kneel
[1:25:08] down and moe says
[1:25:10] you can't get it here then they go to
[1:25:12] another like a nice meadow he says no
[1:25:15] go to another place no and then so the
[1:25:18] boss says well where can i get it
[1:25:20] follow me and he walks straight to the
[1:25:22] pigpen
[1:25:23] starts squelching in the mud kneels down
[1:25:26] and then the boss you know because he
[1:25:28] was right by him because the other boss
[1:25:29] is excited right
[1:25:30] but then but then when they're about to
[1:25:32] go to the pigpen the boss stops
[1:25:34] moses in the pig pen he turns around
[1:25:37] and says aren't you coming in and he and
[1:25:40] he says no no i'm not coming and when
[1:25:41] moses then you don't want it
[1:25:44] why because people you don't really want
[1:25:45] it because people don't want to humble
[1:25:47] themselves
[1:25:48] because if he really wanted it he would
[1:25:49] have been there right with most he would
[1:25:51] have been kneeling down in the slope who
[1:25:53] cares about that
[1:25:54] and he would have got it but people
[1:25:55] aren't willing to humble themselves
[1:25:58] right to really get it hallelujah
[1:26:02] oh but i'm you know i've got to keep a
[1:26:04] reputation no we have no reputation
[1:26:06] i lost my rep i never had one to begin
[1:26:08] with hallelujah i was never part of the
[1:26:10] cool group and who cares about the cool
[1:26:12] group really
[1:26:13] i want to be in the one call group i
[1:26:14] want to be in the cool group which is
[1:26:16] the
[1:26:16] the one in heaven you understand
[1:26:18] hallelujah you know so
[1:26:20] yeah so could you imagine the high
[1:26:21] priest going in there maybe have a pig
[1:26:23] on his nose or maybe it's okay boys go
[1:26:25] and clean the place up first
[1:26:27] sweep me up sweep me a path then i'll
[1:26:29] come in
[1:26:30] he would never have gone in there but
[1:26:32] shepherds are very comfortable in a
[1:26:35] stable they're very comfortable they're
[1:26:37] right at home
[1:26:39] harley they don't have to say oh you
[1:26:40] know how do we act in this place and how
[1:26:42] do we no no they knew exactly how they
[1:26:44] were
[1:26:44] why because their nature was the same as
[1:26:46] that of the stable
[1:26:48] and we've got to have the nature of a
[1:26:50] stable hallelujah no you say on one hand
[1:26:53] well i'm just nothing but a stable yeah
[1:26:54] but you're very valuable to god
[1:26:56] because remember here they come into
[1:26:58] bethlehem and maybe
[1:27:00] maybe joseph tries the first in and it's
[1:27:03] got a no vacancy sign
[1:27:05] this is how a lot of people are when i'm
[1:27:06] talking about ins now i'm talking about
[1:27:07] how people's reaction to the gospel
[1:27:09] sometimes they just put up a sign don't
[1:27:11] even talk to me and then maybe
[1:27:13] maybe he went to another inn and then
[1:27:15] the door opened a little bit what do you
[1:27:16] want
[1:27:18] uh my wife's about to be delivered can
[1:27:20] you help you know can you have mercy on
[1:27:21] us please we've traveled a long way and
[1:27:23] she's
[1:27:23] you know she's already got uh you know
[1:27:26] contractions and
[1:27:28] you know it's more than a braxton hick
[1:27:29] contraction and you know
[1:27:31] you know no get out of here you know
[1:27:34] and then and and that's how some people
[1:27:37] are they'll
[1:27:37] they'll some people won't listen at all
[1:27:39] because they've got their own thing
[1:27:40] going on
[1:27:41] you know they've got their own thing
[1:27:42] going on they've got it all sorted out
[1:27:45] and got it sorted out you know i studied
[1:27:48] i studied pre-life evolution at
[1:27:52] university on the chemical level
[1:27:54] it doesn't work the own laws of
[1:27:57] chemistry
[1:27:57] forbid it happening but they have their
[1:27:59] theories as you know
[1:28:00] hydrothermal vents deep under the ocean
[1:28:02] that's where life first created and
[1:28:05] the laws of chemistry stop it happening
[1:28:08] but then an atheist will say no no when
[1:28:10] i talk about evolution i'm not talking
[1:28:11] about there i'm talking about when
[1:28:13] cells first mutated and you know became
[1:28:15] more than a single
[1:28:16] organism and and i just say hold on no
[1:28:19] no
[1:28:19] you've got to start at the start you
[1:28:22] can't jump because it takes faith
[1:28:24] to go from here now to this oh you're a
[1:28:26] believer now
[1:28:27] right oh no we just stick to the facts
[1:28:29] no no no you have faith
[1:28:31] if you can't work out what happened at
[1:28:33] the start and your own chemical laws
[1:28:35] forbid it happening then how
[1:28:38] how on earth can you say well we'll just
[1:28:40] ignore this but we'll just focus on this
[1:28:42] to prove there's no god no no no it
[1:28:44] doesn't work that way
[1:28:46] but they i don't know why i got onto
[1:28:47] that but you know that's it but it's how
[1:28:49] people are they've got their own thing
[1:28:50] going on they got it all sealed up this
[1:28:52] is how it works
[1:28:53] and then and then maybe they went to the
[1:28:55] third inn and the door came fully open
[1:28:58] maybe this one was just as grumpy and
[1:29:00] stressed about
[1:29:01] you know as everyone else because maybe
[1:29:02] they had to give up their own room for
[1:29:04] other travellers but then joseph said
[1:29:07] sir
[1:29:08] what do you want sir what you know help
[1:29:11] me
[1:29:11] please there's no room at the end but
[1:29:13] can't you see my
[1:29:15] can you see my yeah my wife and we've
[1:29:17] tried these other guys and you know
[1:29:19] other one just had a sign wasn't
[1:29:20] interested the other guy said just get
[1:29:22] out of here now here
[1:29:23] you're the last in bethlehem and then
[1:29:26] maybe he looks and you know feels
[1:29:27] sympathetic remember he's looking
[1:29:29] you think about outwardly he's looking
[1:29:31] at a very pregnant woman
[1:29:33] but in reality here's god about to be
[1:29:35] born emmanuel is about to be born this
[1:29:38] is incredible this has never happened
[1:29:39] before
[1:29:40] he says well there's that stable there
[1:29:44] that that cave in the side of the cliff
[1:29:46] you see it right there
[1:29:47] you can be there but really what god was
[1:29:50] doing is when joseph went to the first
[1:29:52] inn
[1:29:53] god was saying no i can't be born in
[1:29:54] there too proud
[1:29:56] he's got his own he's closed off to what
[1:29:59] i'm doing in this day
[1:30:00] then he goes to the second inn and god
[1:30:03] says no
[1:30:05] they've got their own agenda they want
[1:30:07] to do you know they've got their own
[1:30:08] kind of faith they won't open their
[1:30:09] hearts to me
[1:30:11] and then he comes to the third one and
[1:30:13] god's basically saying
[1:30:14] as soon as as soon as that innkeeper
[1:30:16] says yes there's a stable
[1:30:17] god says yes this is my predestinated
[1:30:21] place where i'm going to be born to the
[1:30:22] earth
[1:30:23] hallelujah and i'll just say it like
[1:30:24] this there's 7 billion people in the
[1:30:27] world
[1:30:28] i don't know how many billion were upon
[1:30:29] the earth when i was born
[1:30:31] or when i got saved but i'll say this
[1:30:33] god's infinite grace bypassed
[1:30:35] millions of people to find me at
[1:30:38] universities a lost drunk student
[1:30:40] he bypassed thousands and millions to
[1:30:42] find me
[1:30:43] you say well that's not very fair well
[1:30:45] it depends what side of the line you're
[1:30:47] on
[1:30:47] because to me i'm like thank you lord
[1:30:49] that's amazing grace hallelujah thank
[1:30:51] you lord you'd bypass
[1:30:52] and i don't know why you bypass them
[1:30:54] that's not my that i don't have to work
[1:30:56] that out
[1:30:57] all i have to do is say thank you lord
[1:30:58] be born in the manger of my heart
[1:31:00] harley and come live here make your
[1:31:02] abode in here
[1:31:03] and the reason is is because there's
[1:31:05] something in us remember it goes beyond
[1:31:07] this thing it goes beyond our
[1:31:10] temperament
[1:31:11] nothing to without temperament nothing
[1:31:12] to do with our raising our
[1:31:15] bracket in society it's got nothing to
[1:31:17] do with those things but there's a
[1:31:19] predestinated soul
[1:31:21] there's a seed of predestination in your
[1:31:23] soul where god says that's my manger
[1:31:27] hallelujah hallelujah now do i wait can
[1:31:30] i still drive this here we are
[1:31:32] i love wait we'll go back i like this
[1:31:34] statement here
[1:31:36] this is in the message of grace
[1:31:39] sovereign grace is from a sovereign one
[1:31:42] sovereign grace from a sovereign one
[1:31:43] sovereign what can it do
[1:31:45] sovereign can do whatever it wants to
[1:31:48] listen to this now sovereign grace can
[1:31:50] be only
[1:31:51] can only be given by one that's
[1:31:53] sovereign and god is sovereign
[1:31:55] so he can give sovereign grace therefore
[1:31:58] being sovereign grace don't have to ask
[1:32:00] anybody
[1:32:01] it don't have to it does what it wants
[1:32:03] to isn't that wonderful
[1:32:05] it don't have to ask can i do this or
[1:32:08] shall i do this can i
[1:32:09] must i will i doesn't do that
[1:32:13] it does it itself grace is sovereign
[1:32:16] therefore he can save the vilest glory
[1:32:18] he can save the worst hallelujah he can
[1:32:20] save the impurities thank you lord
[1:32:22] he can save the immoralist he can heal
[1:32:24] the sickest hallelujah
[1:32:26] so that remember god did not ever have
[1:32:29] to ask the devil
[1:32:30] could i take this one he never ever
[1:32:32] brought the devil into the equation
[1:32:34] when he was when he was moving on your
[1:32:36] life he never had to say
[1:32:37] uh devil do you mind if you just take
[1:32:39] your filthy hands off my property
[1:32:41] can you no no he just barged in there he
[1:32:44] says no this is my
[1:32:45] child and you have no say in this this
[1:32:48] is my
[1:32:49] child take your hands off my property
[1:32:52] hallelujah
[1:32:52] you have lost the battle and this is my
[1:32:55] son or my daughter he didn't ask the
[1:32:57] devil he just went and grabbed us
[1:32:59] hallelujah because remember he does what
[1:33:00] he wants to he's suffering
[1:33:02] amen i'm glad we serve a sovereign god
[1:33:05] i'm glad this is not parliament
[1:33:07] excuse me mr speaker uh can you you know
[1:33:10] no
[1:33:10] none of that imagine the opposition the
[1:33:13] devil would have so
[1:33:14] question time you know who cares about
[1:33:16] question time how god's suffering
[1:33:18] he does what he wants to hallelujah so
[1:33:22] so he chose the stable don't be offended
[1:33:24] you know on the count of the years they
[1:33:25] had their choice
[1:33:27] but he already chose that stable he's
[1:33:28] saying i can be born in this one
[1:33:31] as the same same with you and i as i
[1:33:32] said he bypassed billions of people
[1:33:35] to get you hella because he was looking
[1:33:38] for a manger
[1:33:40] he's looking for a specific kind of
[1:33:41] person
[1:33:43] and you should be saying right now
[1:33:44] hallelujah thank you lord i'm that
[1:33:45] specific kind of person
[1:33:47] he was looking for me and he found me
[1:33:50] hallelujah
[1:33:52] and he doesn't have to ask anyone
[1:33:55] about his children his children are his
[1:33:57] children and he's going to gather them
[1:33:59] he's going to get them he's going to
[1:34:01] redeem them
[1:34:02] and woe beat any spirit or person that
[1:34:04] will try and stop it
[1:34:06] hallelujah amen
[1:34:10] you know it's amazing too when you think
[1:34:11] about how how the lord protected his son
[1:34:15] you would think in our mind there would
[1:34:16] be the the elite of the army would be
[1:34:18] gathered around them
[1:34:21] right you would think that you know
[1:34:22] there would be a great you know
[1:34:24] incredible security he did have
[1:34:26] incredible security
[1:34:28] but how he how he led joseph was was by
[1:34:30] dreams
[1:34:32] now we know dreams are a secondary way
[1:34:34] that god speaks to a people
[1:34:36] normally he would speak through a
[1:34:37] prophet and you think such a magnitude
[1:34:40] of his son being born to the earth as as
[1:34:43] a lamb for our sins
[1:34:45] you'd think there'd be a prophet there
[1:34:46] too to conduct the way but there wasn't
[1:34:48] one
[1:34:50] there was a man and god dealt with him
[1:34:52] in dreams remember the first dream he
[1:34:54] was given as
[1:34:55] as he was questioning he was questioning
[1:34:58] in his heart about mary mary
[1:35:00] you know was you know was was visited by
[1:35:03] gabriel
[1:35:05] and you know she said let it be unto me
[1:35:07] according to thy word
[1:35:09] you'd think such a thing it was 800
[1:35:12] years
[1:35:12] about between the time isaiah was was
[1:35:15] inspired to speak those words
[1:35:17] to finally when that predestinated womb
[1:35:19] was upon the earth
[1:35:21] do you know we're a predestinated people
[1:35:24] we're very special to god i may have to
[1:35:26] repeat that but we're
[1:35:27] very special people we're at the bow
[1:35:29] down to any spirit
[1:35:30] we don't have to be subservient to any
[1:35:32] other spirit anything but the word of
[1:35:34] god
[1:35:35] hallelujah so don't let anything get in
[1:35:37] your way
[1:35:38] that will wear you out stress you out
[1:35:40] break you down emotionally or physically
[1:35:42] or spiritually
[1:35:43] if something is wearing you down to that
[1:35:45] magnitude i would say hold on
[1:35:47] this is not god doing this right this is
[1:35:49] actually the devil trying to destroy me
[1:35:51] lead me to a mental breakdown
[1:35:53] and i'd say no this stops right now i'm
[1:35:56] not putting up
[1:35:56] it doesn't matter what they did and what
[1:35:58] they've done and you know i would say no
[1:36:00] no no no
[1:36:01] this ends this ends
[1:36:05] because remember the lake of fire hell
[1:36:07] was made for the devil and his angels
[1:36:10] we are made for a dwelling place of the
[1:36:12] living god and the new jerusalem is made
[1:36:15] for us
[1:36:17] hallelujah hallelujah you know when you
[1:36:20] know when you have a wedding
[1:36:22] or you have some great you know you have
[1:36:23] a birthday party or something and you
[1:36:25] send out invitations
[1:36:27] yeah you don't just put a thing on
[1:36:29] facebook i'm having a wedding such and
[1:36:31] such everyone's welcome
[1:36:32] bring a plate no no you handwrite an
[1:36:35] invitation or have it printed but you
[1:36:37] put the person's name and their family
[1:36:39] upon the invitation and then you send it
[1:36:41] to them
[1:36:43] you don't leave it on your table and
[1:36:44] think well maybe they'll get it you make
[1:36:46] sure they get it
[1:36:47] right and the people that are closest to
[1:36:49] you they you really make sure they get
[1:36:51] it hallelujah
[1:36:52] and you give a rsvp date and everything
[1:36:55] but you know in your heart
[1:36:57] those who will accept it right
[1:37:00] just for example you know when we got
[1:37:02] married and we invited
[1:37:04] say you know our immediate families
[1:37:07] we you know we knew they'd come we
[1:37:09] didn't have to guess i wonder if my
[1:37:10] parents will be there i wonder if
[1:37:11] christine's parents will be there i
[1:37:12] wonder if my siblings will be there you
[1:37:14] know no no we knew they'd be there
[1:37:16] right so it's the same thing but some
[1:37:18] people were invited
[1:37:20] we knew they wouldn't be there but we
[1:37:21] gave them an opportunity
[1:37:23] right but it's the same thing with the
[1:37:25] lord when he gave you an invitation to
[1:37:27] the wedding supper
[1:37:29] he knew in his heart you'd accept it he
[1:37:32] knew in his heart you'd accept it
[1:37:33] he wasn't wondering i wonder if brother
[1:37:35] queben will receive me and let me live
[1:37:37] through his life for the rest of his
[1:37:38] days and take a rapture i wonder no he
[1:37:40] knew
[1:37:40] hallelujah he knew exactly that was
[1:37:42] going to happen i mean it was the same
[1:37:44] thing when god gives the invitation to
[1:37:46] the wedding supper to you he knows
[1:37:47] you'll say
[1:37:48] of course i will hallelujah why would i
[1:37:50] not do that
[1:37:52] hallelujah so he wasn't guessing so so
[1:37:54] when when gardner's great mind had the
[1:37:56] plans for the new jerusalem
[1:37:58] and however we're going to live in the
[1:38:00] other dimensions and you know
[1:38:02] he is the best city planner there is
[1:38:05] right he does not build things for now
[1:38:07] but when they're built
[1:38:08] they're five years down the track and
[1:38:10] they're not big enough
[1:38:11] he's the perfect city planner right he
[1:38:14] knows exactly what he's doing so so when
[1:38:15] he planned the new jerusalem
[1:38:17] he knew who would be there he knew where
[1:38:19] they would be
[1:38:20] he knew if they would be you know in the
[1:38:22] city outside the city if they were just
[1:38:24] the temple guards or you know what
[1:38:26] position the bride different ones we
[1:38:27] know there's
[1:38:29] we you know we know there's different
[1:38:30] places you know heaven is not a
[1:38:31] communistic state
[1:38:33] hallelujah you know but he knew so when
[1:38:36] he thought of the new jerusalem
[1:38:38] he thought of you and he thought of you
[1:38:40] being there
[1:38:41] hallelujah and and his thoughts can't
[1:38:44] change so
[1:38:44] he he saw the city and he saw the
[1:38:47] inhabitants of the city
[1:38:48] and he saw how those inhabitants would
[1:38:50] receive him in the earth and when they'd
[1:38:51] come here
[1:38:52] and he saw them there hallelujah so now
[1:38:55] that's why when he gave out the
[1:38:56] invitation
[1:38:57] because brother ram says this message he
[1:39:00] says the bridegroom
[1:39:01] call will come right through this what
[1:39:03] is that that's an invitation to the
[1:39:05] wedding
[1:39:06] and not as a gift but actually standing
[1:39:08] at the altar as the bride
[1:39:10] now we know the marriage takes place
[1:39:12] here but there's a wedding supper is the
[1:39:13] reception afterwards
[1:39:15] hallelujah and the food will be great
[1:39:18] hallelujah we won't be disappointed with
[1:39:20] that one that's for sure
[1:39:21] not there anyway hallelujah but you know
[1:39:24] he knows exactly no
[1:39:25] i just want you know you're special to
[1:39:26] god hallelujah remember he gave
[1:39:29] if you really want to give someone a
[1:39:31] gift who's who's a real gifty person
[1:39:33] here
[1:39:34] who likes to give gifts and you know we
[1:39:36] all like to receive gifts i mean that
[1:39:37] you know
[1:39:37] but but who likes to really give gifts
[1:39:41] yeah so you put a lot of thought and a
[1:39:44] lot of heart
[1:39:44] and and what you give it's actually it's
[1:39:47] not just the object and you're not
[1:39:49] emotionally attached that object
[1:39:51] actually your heart is in that gift
[1:39:53] right your heart is in that gift you
[1:39:55] you want them to receive it in the
[1:39:57] spirit and the love that is given in
[1:40:00] amen and so it's the same thing with our
[1:40:02] lord he is the ultimate gift-giver
[1:40:05] right and he didn't just you know
[1:40:06] sometimes you
[1:40:08] uh you know sometimes you think when you
[1:40:10] give you know people get up in years you
[1:40:11] think what am i going to give them for
[1:40:12] their birthday or you know for christmas
[1:40:14] and you know the default i will just get
[1:40:16] them a voucher or something
[1:40:18] you know which is which is all very good
[1:40:20] nothing wrong with vouchers okay but you
[1:40:21] know
[1:40:22] but they could turn around and say not a
[1:40:24] lot of thought went into that voucher
[1:40:27] even though it's probably exactly what
[1:40:28] you wanted but some vouchers you get for
[1:40:29] multiple things
[1:40:31] you can get a queensgate vouching you
[1:40:32] can spin it any you know
[1:40:34] hello are we all here you know what i
[1:40:36] mean so but you but the person who
[1:40:38] receives it
[1:40:40] could either say thank you very much
[1:40:42] that's what i needed or they could say
[1:40:44] well actually you just got me a voucher
[1:40:45] you did not put a lot of thought and
[1:40:47] heart into this gift
[1:40:48] but if they but if they were given a
[1:40:50] specific thing
[1:40:51] that they really wanted then the one who
[1:40:53] received it could actually realize the
[1:40:55] giver
[1:40:56] gave them exactly what they needed
[1:40:58] exactly what was on their heart
[1:40:59] now you know we needed salvation we
[1:41:02] needed a lamb
[1:41:03] we needed a lamb we needed one to stand
[1:41:06] in the gap hallelujah to be our sin
[1:41:08] offering
[1:41:08] right we needed one so so when the lord
[1:41:10] gave a gift to us
[1:41:12] remember he didn't just give us a
[1:41:13] voucher he didn't just send a card and
[1:41:16] twenty dollars nothing wrong with that
[1:41:17] but you know then you know
[1:41:19] he didn't just he didn't just you know
[1:41:20] like uh
[1:41:22] he put a lot of effort into his gift
[1:41:25] he put incredible effort incredible
[1:41:27] heart into his gift
[1:41:28] and he wanted to give us the best
[1:41:31] hallelujah
[1:41:32] and he gave us the best he didn't give
[1:41:34] us a second class gift
[1:41:35] he gave us the best gift he gave us
[1:41:38] eternal life
[1:41:40] here was eternal life and it was born in
[1:41:43] a manger now this mange as i said was
[1:41:45] predestinated
[1:41:46] god chose it as the same thing with you
[1:41:48] and i now
[1:41:50] we are pre i i like the word
[1:41:52] predestination
[1:41:55] because if my destiny is predetermined
[1:41:58] and i know
[1:41:58] my destiny is to go on a rapture and is
[1:42:01] to go into the new heavens and new earth
[1:42:02] you know in the new jerusalem i'm pretty
[1:42:04] happy about that that's a good deal
[1:42:07] what did you have to do well i just have
[1:42:08] to receive it
[1:42:10] hallelujah get my whole life to it done
[1:42:14] but brother rahm says you're improving
[1:42:15] his word in the last days there's got to
[1:42:17] be a place
[1:42:18] prepared for the word to be made
[1:42:19] manifest and we're now living by the
[1:42:22] evidence of the new land amen the son of
[1:42:23] man so
[1:42:24] he's saying i'm just going to take the
[1:42:25] first part of that that there has to be
[1:42:27] a place for the word
[1:42:29] a place prepared for the word to be made
[1:42:31] manifest now
[1:42:32] i'm sure we can all agree that manger or
[1:42:34] that stable
[1:42:35] even the manger in the stable was a
[1:42:38] place prepared
[1:42:39] it was a prepared place for emmanuel to
[1:42:42] take his first sleep on the earth
[1:42:44] it was the first place i meant yeah it
[1:42:46] was the place that he'd be born it was a
[1:42:48] place prepared for the word to be made
[1:42:50] manifest now we know that we are when we
[1:42:53] think of christmas
[1:42:54] that's just a historical event but
[1:42:56] there's another place for the word to be
[1:42:58] born into
[1:42:59] and it's far greater than a stable but
[1:43:01] it's the soul of man for
[1:43:02] for god to be united with humanity that
[1:43:05] word to be made manifest in a person's
[1:43:07] life
[1:43:08] that's an incredible thing hallelujah
[1:43:11] you know
[1:43:11] you don't need to go to bethlehem to see
[1:43:13] a stable
[1:43:14] and if you go nowadays while the some
[1:43:17] orthodox church just built a big ugly
[1:43:19] you know church on that location and
[1:43:21] you've got to pay i don't know how much
[1:43:22] to get into it and you know so the
[1:43:24] stable's not there anyway but you know
[1:43:26] there's got to be a place prepared for
[1:43:27] the word to be made manifest so
[1:43:29] we know that in every generation there
[1:43:32] is a word
[1:43:33] right every season so there was a word
[1:43:36] for the book of acts now we
[1:43:38] we sell our book of acts church we know
[1:43:39] that but then there was a word of
[1:43:41] restoration with luther and wesley and
[1:43:43] pentecost
[1:43:44] and then now the fullness of that word
[1:43:45] was manifest in this message right it
[1:43:47] was the son of man
[1:43:48] revealed jesus christ but brother rahm
[1:43:51] says that that that the son of man jesus
[1:43:53] christ being revealed wasn't just to be
[1:43:54] in one person but and to be a
[1:43:56] multi-member body
[1:43:57] and so what it was in the fullness of
[1:43:59] the prophet now it's now down through a
[1:44:01] body so the son of man
[1:44:02] jesus christ is still being revealed
[1:44:04] today it's in you and i
[1:44:07] remember that we're not here to manifest
[1:44:08] an argument or a debate
[1:44:10] or an intellectual understanding we're
[1:44:12] here to manifest the word jesus christ
[1:44:14] that that that he would live again so
[1:44:17] so just as the manger was prepared
[1:44:20] so our hearts were prepared to for a
[1:44:23] place for god to manifest his word in
[1:44:25] hallelujah now now to me well i just
[1:44:28] love that
[1:44:29] i am by god's grace a prepared place
[1:44:34] and i was not prepared to be a
[1:44:36] habitation of devils
[1:44:38] though under my first nature and the
[1:44:39] things i got into in this world
[1:44:41] i was a habitation of devils i was
[1:44:45] but god said no no this is this is not
[1:44:47] what is meant to be in this
[1:44:48] in this manger this is not what meant to
[1:44:50] be in this stable and he had to clear it
[1:44:52] out
[1:44:53] i mean by the power of his blood that he
[1:44:54] could make his abode in the stable
[1:44:57] and manifest himself out hallelujah i
[1:45:00] love it where
[1:45:02] you know the first time the name of
[1:45:04] jesus is spoken here in matthew 1
[1:45:09] he says now the birth of jesus christ
[1:45:11] was on this wise
[1:45:12] when as his mother mary was the spouse
[1:45:14] of joseph before they came
[1:45:16] together she was found with child of the
[1:45:17] holy ghost
[1:45:19] now it's amazing when you think about
[1:45:21] this only gabriel
[1:45:23] only mary spoke to gabriel it wasn't a
[1:45:25] group revelation this was her revelation
[1:45:28] but joseph wasn't leaping for joy at
[1:45:31] first
[1:45:32] when she told him honey because you know
[1:45:35] there comes a time where where a woman
[1:45:37] can't hide a pregnancy
[1:45:39] and i don't know how quickly she would
[1:45:41] tell him about this but you know there
[1:45:44] came a time where they had that maybe it
[1:45:45] was an uncomfortable kind of discussion
[1:45:48] no doubt mary would have brought it up
[1:45:49] first and would have explained the
[1:45:50] visitation of the angel in different
[1:45:52] things but
[1:45:53] you know he was troubled about this and
[1:45:55] it goes to show that a testimony doesn't
[1:45:57] always make everyone leap for joy
[1:46:00] right but it was anchored in her heart
[1:46:02] it was emmanuel that was being formed in
[1:46:03] her womb
[1:46:04] hallelujah but he was troubled
[1:46:08] but so but it took the lord to come and
[1:46:10] speak to him and say no
[1:46:11] no what she is telling you is the truth
[1:46:14] so found with child of the holy ghost
[1:46:17] then joseph her husband being a just man
[1:46:19] and not willing to make her a public
[1:46:21] example was minded
[1:46:22] to put her away privily but while he
[1:46:25] thought on these things he was thinking
[1:46:27] should i marry her
[1:46:28] should i not what shall i put her away
[1:46:30] how's you know what's the fallout of
[1:46:32] this going to be you know
[1:46:33] all these things this is what he's
[1:46:35] thinking about behold the angel lord
[1:46:37] appeared unto him in a dream
[1:46:39] saint joseph thou son of david fear not
[1:46:41] to take unto thee mirror thy wife
[1:46:43] for that which is conceived in her is of
[1:46:45] the holy ghost
[1:46:47] and he shall bring and she sorry shall
[1:46:49] bring forth the son
[1:46:50] and thou shalt call his name jesus for
[1:46:52] he shall save his people
[1:46:54] from their sins so so joseph was
[1:46:56] thinking well maybe i just got to put
[1:46:58] away
[1:46:58] privately and you know obviously he
[1:47:00] would have been heartbroken at that
[1:47:01] thought because he would have loved her
[1:47:03] but then the angel lord came to him in a
[1:47:05] dream now this was god protecting his
[1:47:07] son because joseph was ordained to be a
[1:47:09] shield
[1:47:10] i mean to mary and i mean yeah yet to
[1:47:12] mary and jesus but
[1:47:13] you know so so this is how he he he
[1:47:16] guarded
[1:47:17] the child by a secondary way of a dream
[1:47:20] because there's no prophets in the land
[1:47:22] but then he tells remember that angel
[1:47:23] tells him here you shall call his name
[1:47:25] jesus
[1:47:26] for he shall save his people from their
[1:47:28] sins now when i think of being saved
[1:47:30] when when he shall save his people from
[1:47:32] their sins
[1:47:33] it's not a you know to me it's not well
[1:47:35] you know
[1:47:36] you get rescued from one sin just to
[1:47:38] fall into another sin
[1:47:39] and then you get pulled into another sin
[1:47:41] then you get pulled out of that sin
[1:47:42] that's not what he's talking about he's
[1:47:44] talking about when he talks about
[1:47:46] being saved from their sins this word
[1:47:49] save in the greek
[1:47:50] it means safe it means to save that is
[1:47:52] deliver or protect
[1:47:54] to heal preserve to be made whole
[1:47:57] so to me when he says he shall save his
[1:48:00] people from their sins it's going to be
[1:48:01] i'm going to deliver them from that sin
[1:48:03] and they're never going to go back into
[1:48:04] it right there's going to be a full
[1:48:06] deliverance out and they're not going to
[1:48:08] go back in
[1:48:09] hallelujah now in order for this to
[1:48:11] happen the lord has to do a work on the
[1:48:13] inside of the inside of us
[1:48:14] because we you know we as as as human
[1:48:17] beings born with a fallen first nature
[1:48:20] we are more aligned with the devil and
[1:48:22] sin than we are with god with our first
[1:48:24] nature
[1:48:24] that's why the scripture tells us not
[1:48:26] one seeks after god
[1:48:28] so built in us naturally there's nothing
[1:48:29] in us to seek after god
[1:48:31] but because of a seed of predestination
[1:48:34] and you know there's actually a hunger
[1:48:35] and a thirst there's got to be more to
[1:48:38] life than this
[1:48:39] you know maybe we may have tried many
[1:48:40] things tried to fit in many different
[1:48:42] kind of places but
[1:48:43] they didn't satisfy that's because it
[1:48:45] was something that was calling
[1:48:47] but we didn't know what we were calling
[1:48:49] to but god was drawing us the whole time
[1:48:51] hallelujah so god had to come
[1:48:54] and he actually had to break that sin
[1:48:57] nature
[1:48:59] by us giving it to him he had to
[1:49:00] actually kill that out of our lives now
[1:49:03] if we look at with with moses and the
[1:49:05] golden calf
[1:49:07] you know he came down off the mountain
[1:49:09] and they heard
[1:49:11] a noise in the camp and they didn't know
[1:49:13] what it was it says it came to pass
[1:49:15] that as he came nine to the camp that he
[1:49:17] saw the
[1:49:18] calf and the dancing and moses anger
[1:49:20] waxed hot and he cast the tables out of
[1:49:22] his hands and break them beneath the
[1:49:24] mount
[1:49:25] so here was a man under the blood of
[1:49:26] balls and goats when he saw something
[1:49:28] that was contrary to the word he broke
[1:49:29] the word
[1:49:30] he couldn't keep it and he took the calf
[1:49:33] which was made
[1:49:34] and burnt it in the fire and ground it
[1:49:36] to powder
[1:49:37] and stored it upon the water and made
[1:49:39] the children of israel drink it now
[1:49:41] what he is doing there he's not just
[1:49:43] punishing them with yucky water
[1:49:45] but he's actually signifying because
[1:49:47] remember that golden calf where did it
[1:49:48] come from
[1:49:50] we say well it was the earrings and
[1:49:51] things and aaron made the calf no no
[1:49:53] where did it come from
[1:49:55] it came from the hearts of the people
[1:49:57] because they wanted
[1:49:58] a god that they could see that they
[1:50:00] could worship but it's amazing that
[1:50:01] while that was being made
[1:50:03] moses was on the mountain getting the
[1:50:04] revelation of the word from god
[1:50:06] so if they just waited they would have
[1:50:08] got something to worship
[1:50:10] so so that golden calf game came out of
[1:50:13] the hearts of the people because
[1:50:14] remember this is
[1:50:15] man's nature is to worship something
[1:50:18] right
[1:50:19] you can worship you can worship people
[1:50:21] worship them
[1:50:22] themselves this is a selfie generation
[1:50:25] it's all about me me me
[1:50:27] what you know what is the main thing
[1:50:28] about an instagram account look at me
[1:50:30] this is what i you know this is where
[1:50:32] i'm living and it's all you know staged
[1:50:34] and fake and
[1:50:35] and it's amazing there's studies done
[1:50:37] that people who have now this is not
[1:50:39] always true
[1:50:41] but the majority of people that have the
[1:50:43] happiest looking photos online
[1:50:45] then they're the most unhappy in reality
[1:50:47] so they put forward a fake
[1:50:49] representation of who they are like look
[1:50:51] at my happy family and all this stage
[1:50:53] stuff
[1:50:54] and when the camera's turned off they're
[1:50:56] devouring each other at home
[1:50:59] some people actually are happy you know
[1:51:02] during the photo and after the photo
[1:51:04] but a lot of people are happy in the
[1:51:06] photo but it's just it's just staged
[1:51:08] there's no reality in that so
[1:51:11] it's you know you can worship yourself
[1:51:13] but you see so what happened is this
[1:51:14] calf came out of the people
[1:51:16] and moses was by by by strawing it he i
[1:51:19] thought
[1:51:20] um ye so he grounded the powder and
[1:51:22] strawed it upon the water
[1:51:23] and made the children of israel drink of
[1:51:25] it what are you signifying is now
[1:51:27] that idolatry was actually still in the
[1:51:28] people went back into them
[1:51:30] because the blood of bulls and goats
[1:51:32] could not destroy i mean that
[1:51:34] that fallen nature and man for them to
[1:51:36] be an idol worshiper
[1:51:38] but the blood of jesus christ does
[1:51:40] hallelujah so now
[1:51:41] now here we are because remember he
[1:51:43] shall save his people from their sins
[1:51:45] so god had to come and actually deliver
[1:51:47] us from a fallen nature we're born with
[1:51:49] hallelujah and the only way he could do
[1:51:51] that is is when he comes in
[1:51:53] he kills that sin nature now brother
[1:51:55] brown when he talks about
[1:51:57] you know our body else our spirit and
[1:52:00] our soul
[1:52:00] he says in a couple of places he says
[1:52:02] about how the holy ghost god has to kill
[1:52:04] that snake
[1:52:06] he says it's either in the soul or in
[1:52:08] the spirits there's that serpent nature
[1:52:09] that we're born with
[1:52:10] that god has to kill and that's why
[1:52:12] someone who's really met the lord is a
[1:52:14] new creature
[1:52:15] why because how we think has been
[1:52:17] transformed our outlook our appetite
[1:52:19] you know everything we are we've been
[1:52:21] made new again
[1:52:22] sure we'll have our failures we'll form
[1:52:24] or stumble but you know but if our
[1:52:26] nature's been changed
[1:52:28] hallelujah if our nature's if there's
[1:52:30] life there you know you take
[1:52:31] children you know not you know it won't
[1:52:33] be very long you know
[1:52:35] william kind of half just capsizes onto
[1:52:37] his side he can't roll all the way but
[1:52:39] there'll come a time where he'll roll
[1:52:41] because he wants to move he sees his
[1:52:42] sisters come and run
[1:52:44] and dance and play and go off and no
[1:52:46] doubt he's like i want to do that too
[1:52:48] hallelujah you see it in babies there's
[1:52:50] a desire because there's life
[1:52:52] they want to be like a mature adult
[1:52:55] right that's why you know we should
[1:52:57] spend time with our children and get
[1:52:58] them on board it may take 20 times
[1:53:01] longer than
[1:53:02] normal if it's just you but you know
[1:53:03] they want to be part of everything we do
[1:53:05] remember steve brisson mentioned this at
[1:53:06] that camp
[1:53:07] hallelujah and so and so there's a
[1:53:09] desire as long as life is in his body
[1:53:12] and he just keeps eating food hallelujah
[1:53:16] he will eventually be walking and he'll
[1:53:19] be talking
[1:53:20] and he'll probably be more coordinated
[1:53:22] than me you know
[1:53:23] i was i was had the boys out the back at
[1:53:26] our place on wednesday we had like
[1:53:28] reuben and liam and and jono and
[1:53:30] jonathan were there
[1:53:31] and and we got the cricket set out now
[1:53:33] you know the girls are you know trying
[1:53:34] to
[1:53:35] you know get them to play qriket and
[1:53:36] different things and i told them you
[1:53:38] know i said i said
[1:53:39] i'm going to teach the girls to bowl an
[1:53:40] in-swinging yorker
[1:53:44] okay so a non-cricket player language
[1:53:47] as it's a as a bowl you bowl really fast
[1:53:51] and the ball swings through the air and
[1:53:53] it's and it's aimed to land on the
[1:53:54] batsman's feet that's an you know either
[1:53:56] swings in or swings out
[1:53:57] and so i said you know that's what i
[1:53:58] want to teach them and i in my
[1:54:01] stupidity i begin to explain this to the
[1:54:03] boys and then what they do is they're
[1:54:05] playing cricket and every one of them
[1:54:06] bowled it and right on the batsman's
[1:54:08] feet i thought man i've gotta
[1:54:11] i've got to work on my game so they knew
[1:54:13] what i was talking about but
[1:54:15] initially they could not do that but
[1:54:17] they saw it being done somewhere and
[1:54:19] they had a desire i want to do that too
[1:54:20] that's pretty cool
[1:54:21] why because as long as there's a desire
[1:54:23] and now i'm talking about christian
[1:54:24] things now
[1:54:25] as long as there's a desire and don't
[1:54:27] let the devil ever take that desire out
[1:54:28] of you
[1:54:29] because we're going to realize there's
[1:54:31] many desires we have in life
[1:54:33] right we have a desire you know there's
[1:54:35] a natural desire in a person to have
[1:54:37] children to get married have children
[1:54:39] right natural desire to travel natural
[1:54:41] desire to have a job
[1:54:43] buy a house that's all natural desires
[1:54:45] but don't ever let it
[1:54:46] don't ever let it become first place in
[1:54:49] your life
[1:54:50] hallelujah because sometimes people
[1:54:52] think oh
[1:54:53] an evidence of the holy ghost is all i
[1:54:55] want is jesus and nothing else
[1:54:57] but god doesn't just switch off you know
[1:55:00] he doesn't switch off those desires
[1:55:02] but they come into their place you're
[1:55:05] following me
[1:55:06] right you know people get all 12 but you
[1:55:08] know there's this and this and i want to
[1:55:09] do this and this and does it mean i know
[1:55:11] the lord well
[1:55:12] who's number one because if he's number
[1:55:14] one he will guide those desires
[1:55:16] it won't be you guiding yourself but it
[1:55:18] will be the lord actually saying because
[1:55:19] you know
[1:55:20] sometimes we say well i want to do this
[1:55:21] and the lord just shuts the door
[1:55:24] you know i remember this is when we just
[1:55:26] got married
[1:55:27] you know i was i was going to go to
[1:55:28] teachers college and you know i wanted
[1:55:31] to be a teacher because
[1:55:32] i didn't want to be a lab monkey and you
[1:55:35] know
[1:55:36] and um before i met the lord the last
[1:55:38] thing the lord took from me is
[1:55:39] is actually i was worshiping my
[1:55:41] education i want to become a professor i
[1:55:43] want to climb the ivory tower
[1:55:45] and become a biochemist and but
[1:55:48] but it became my everything now there's
[1:55:50] nothing wrong with education nothing
[1:55:52] wrong with those things but remember
[1:55:53] what's first place right so but it
[1:55:55] became my everything the lord just said
[1:55:57] you're worshiping your education
[1:55:58] so i gave it to him but i didn't quit
[1:56:00] the studies i finished the studies but
[1:56:01] now he was number one
[1:56:03] so um and then and then i had this you
[1:56:06] know i was thinking now what am i going
[1:56:07] to do because i didn't want to
[1:56:08] i didn't even finish my master's but at
[1:56:10] that stage i was planning to finish my
[1:56:12] masters
[1:56:12] and then i wasn't going to do a phd at a
[1:56:14] you know and i didn't want to become a
[1:56:16] lab monkey as i call it
[1:56:17] so i thought well i'll become a science
[1:56:19] teacher
[1:56:20] and i just had such a euphoric feeling
[1:56:22] over me i'm going to be a teacher
[1:56:24] nothing wrong with being a teacher but
[1:56:26] then i enrolled into the um
[1:56:28] the um program which trains you to be a
[1:56:31] teacher and
[1:56:32] and i was put into because i want to be
[1:56:34] a science teacher a chemistry teacher
[1:56:36] i thought if i'm a chemistry teacher
[1:56:37] i'll avoid teaching evolution
[1:56:39] but then you know i start we got married
[1:56:42] i start teachers college and man it's
[1:56:43] your life
[1:56:44] you know hats off to teachers you know
[1:56:46] it's a calling but you know
[1:56:47] it was just i thought of my mind well
[1:56:49] i've got all these holidays therefore
[1:56:50] we'll be able to do mission work and you
[1:56:52] know
[1:56:52] it'll be oh no you know it's not that
[1:56:54] way but you know
[1:56:56] then but then i was praying i speak but
[1:56:57] my see the thing is my feelings were
[1:56:59] leading me i was excited about it
[1:57:01] but that wasn't a word from the lord and
[1:57:04] so i came to a spot wrong like lord do
[1:57:06] you really want me to
[1:57:08] actually be a teacher and so we prayed
[1:57:10] about it
[1:57:11] and the very next week we're teaching
[1:57:13] evolution
[1:57:14] to the junior science class not the
[1:57:16] theory of but a fact
[1:57:18] so i just said to them well i can't do
[1:57:20] this i quit
[1:57:22] and i became a lab monkey and we moved
[1:57:24] to
[1:57:26] you know but the thing is you got to be
[1:57:27] careful don't let your feelings lead you
[1:57:30] let the lord lead you and then when the
[1:57:32] lord leads you he'll bring the feelings
[1:57:34] right so you've got to say what is first
[1:57:36] place now
[1:57:38] so there are many desires that we have
[1:57:41] but you know but
[1:57:42] okay now going back to babies that's
[1:57:43] where i was see
[1:57:45] they have a desire in them to walk
[1:57:48] they won't be able to just stand up and
[1:57:50] just start walking have you ever seen a
[1:57:52] baby just
[1:57:52] maybe there's some in the world but you
[1:57:54] know they never you know
[1:57:56] they never ever you know stand up and
[1:57:58] fall over
[1:57:59] they just perfectly walk first time
[1:58:03] no they they hold on to things they walk
[1:58:06] along and you know
[1:58:07] and then they kind of push off and go
[1:58:09] into space and you know they're kind of
[1:58:11] like this and they fall over and things
[1:58:13] they fall over and hurt themselves but
[1:58:16] they walk
[1:58:17] and eventually they don't have to think
[1:58:19] about it
[1:58:20] they don't have to just hold on they can
[1:58:22] just keep walking it's the same thing
[1:58:23] being a believer
[1:58:24] as long as there's a desire lord i want
[1:58:26] to be like you
[1:58:28] that's why i got to focus what is really
[1:58:29] the desire in my heart now don't let the
[1:58:31] devil cloud it over
[1:58:32] don't let him take it away you know we
[1:58:35] can walk it first and we can fail many
[1:58:37] times
[1:58:38] you know i still trip over sometimes
[1:58:41] right walking naturally now yeah
[1:58:43] spiritually too but there's a desire
[1:58:46] i want to walk i want to be just like
[1:58:48] the lord
[1:58:49] hallelujah says so it should be the same
[1:58:51] thing with us now
[1:58:55] but you see he had to he had to come
[1:58:58] and he had to break he had to take a
[1:59:01] idolatry out of people and the only way
[1:59:04] he could do that was by the blood of
[1:59:06] jesus christ the blood of bulls and gods
[1:59:07] could never do it
[1:59:09] hallelujah i'm so glad we can be made
[1:59:10] new creatures don't you remember he
[1:59:12] shall save his people from their sin so
[1:59:14] he's gonna
[1:59:15] save them from them and they'll never go
[1:59:17] back
[1:59:18] hell it's not an in and out thing you're
[1:59:20] in
[1:59:21] hallelujah you've been delivered
[1:59:24] hallelujah
[1:59:25] you know there's a thing if you have to
[1:59:27] keep yourself from something because
[1:59:28] you're afraid you'll fall into it
[1:59:30] you've got to get rid of it now that
[1:59:32] doesn't mean you like so for example
[1:59:34] i've used this example over the years
[1:59:36] i could i used to make beer i drank a
[1:59:39] lot of it
[1:59:40] but the lord took that out of me i
[1:59:42] didn't i didn't have to say well thou
[1:59:44] shalt not drink the lord just took the
[1:59:46] desire away
[1:59:47] and so i could live in a brewery and i'd
[1:59:49] still be a sober man
[1:59:51] because the desire for it is not there
[1:59:54] it's gone i and i
[1:59:55] you know i can't help that i don't want
[1:59:57] it back but it's gone
[1:59:59] so it's the same thing now now i don't
[2:00:01] have to keep from from alcohol
[2:00:03] i don't have to you know stay away from
[2:00:05] that part of the supermarket or stay
[2:00:07] away from the body low and
[2:00:08] you know because there's nothing in me
[2:00:09] that wants it i can't help that
[2:00:12] i'm just happy it's gone so you know
[2:00:14] it's the same thing it should be
[2:00:15] the same thing with us you know it's not
[2:00:17] we're keeping ourselves from
[2:00:19] things but he changes our nature that it
[2:00:22] doesn't bother us anymore
[2:00:25] now i was talking on the power of prayer
[2:00:29] power of speech
[2:00:30] power over holy life amen that's what
[2:00:32] the holy ghost has to do some of you
[2:00:34] people walking along saying well
[2:00:35] i just can't quit drinking i can't i
[2:00:38] just can't quit this the holy ghost
[2:00:40] comes to live in you
[2:00:41] to make all these get away from
[2:00:43] you that's right
[2:00:45] make women stop cutting hurt their hair
[2:00:47] make them quit wearing shorts and slacks
[2:00:49] no excuses makes them quit tattling
[2:00:51] oh yes that's what it's for to make you
[2:00:53] live a holy life
[2:00:54] see how he puts this kind of thing with
[2:00:57] this kind of thing
[2:00:58] it's all the same to god oh yes that's
[2:01:01] what it's for to make you live a holy
[2:01:03] life it'll follow the instructions of
[2:01:04] the bible every time
[2:01:06] a woman says it's just too hot i just
[2:01:08] have to wear these it gives me a
[2:01:09] headache if i let my hair grow
[2:01:11] but there's no excuses with the holy
[2:01:13] ghost it's there to make it so
[2:01:15] it'll follow the word just exactly
[2:01:17] that's what the holy ghost is to do
[2:01:18] is to make you man turn your head from
[2:01:21] them half naked woman
[2:01:22] and quit lusting after them and the
[2:01:24] church members and that's what is to do
[2:01:26] is to quit making you smoke and drink
[2:01:30] and want to be a big shot
[2:01:33] you know someone who wants to be the
[2:01:34] biggest in the group it'll take that out
[2:01:36] of you
[2:01:38] it'll take that out of you it'll humble
[2:01:40] you when you do that that's what the
[2:01:42] holy ghost is for
[2:01:43] it's for a holy life that's right make
[2:01:45] it quick gossiping
[2:01:47] make equip playing cards shooting craps
[2:01:49] now that's another gambling game i had
[2:01:51] to google that one
[2:01:52] and all these other things that you do
[2:01:54] around the corner
[2:01:55] it'll make you quit you're carrying on
[2:01:57] the way you're doing living untrue to
[2:01:58] your wife
[2:01:59] that's what it'll do that's right it'll
[2:02:01] quit making you want to marry someone
[2:02:03] else's wife
[2:02:04] that's exactly right that's what it is
[2:02:06] it's to make you live a holy life
[2:02:08] that's what the holy ghost is powerful
[2:02:10] to set your affections on things above
[2:02:12] where god stands by the right hand of
[2:02:14] the majesty on high the mind of christ
[2:02:16] is in you you can't help from
[2:02:18] seeing those things when you look at
[2:02:19] them you turn your head that's right it
[2:02:21] is to make you you say i can't do it
[2:02:24] oh i can't do it sure you can't but the
[2:02:26] holy ghost
[2:02:27] i mean holy spirit can't come for that
[2:02:30] purpose that's what it did as you take
[2:02:32] it out of you and all them old habits
[2:02:34] and things you're doing
[2:02:36] i mean so it takes the counts out and
[2:02:38] gives you overcoming power
[2:02:40] i'm so glad it's that way hell it's not
[2:02:42] i saw i can't do it no no he takes it
[2:02:44] out of you
[2:02:45] hallelujah what is this he shall save
[2:02:47] his people from their sins
[2:02:49] hallelujah
[2:02:53] hallelujah now he says here in james
[2:02:56] let no man say when he is tempted i am
[2:02:59] tempted
[2:03:00] of god for god cannot be tempted with
[2:03:02] evil neither tempteth
[2:03:03] he any man but every man is tempted when
[2:03:06] he is drawn away
[2:03:06] of his own lusts and enticed then when
[2:03:09] he hath conceived it bringeth forth sin
[2:03:11] and sin when it's finished bringeth
[2:03:13] forth death
[2:03:16] so it's we are enticed away by our own
[2:03:19] lusts
[2:03:20] but if that thing's killed there's
[2:03:22] nothing to be enticed with sure you
[2:03:24] can't help from seeing these things but
[2:03:25] you turn your head
[2:03:26] right but you know the thing is if if
[2:03:29] the devil can get us to agree with
[2:03:30] something then he's got us
[2:03:33] amen but remember he's a liar i think
[2:03:34] brother impal said doesn't matter if
[2:03:36] he's saying the truth he's lying
[2:03:38] because of who he is hallelujah so we
[2:03:42] don't have to put up with his nonsense
[2:03:43] now
[2:03:45] i love this the steps of a good man are
[2:03:47] ordered of the lord now i just want to
[2:03:48] go back to my opening statements then
[2:03:49] we're going to
[2:03:51] then we're going to finish we're very
[2:03:53] special people
[2:03:55] right we're a very special people now
[2:03:57] actually i want to go back to this guy i
[2:03:58] got something in my notes
[2:03:59] this is why i don't like slideshows now
[2:04:02] when a man
[2:04:03] what happens is people you can get so
[2:04:06] used to a captive
[2:04:08] someone who's holding you captive that
[2:04:10] you can actually begin to love that
[2:04:11] thing or love that person
[2:04:13] right there's a there's a syndrome
[2:04:15] called stockholm syndrome who's heard of
[2:04:17] stockholm syndrome
[2:04:18] now this is just from healthline.com
[2:04:20] says stockholm syndrome is a
[2:04:22] psychological response
[2:04:24] it occurs when hostages or abuse victims
[2:04:27] bond with their captors
[2:04:28] or abusers this psychological connection
[2:04:31] develops over the course of the days
[2:04:33] weeks months or even years of
[2:04:35] of captivity or abuse
[2:04:40] with the syndrome
[2:04:43] hostages or abuse victims may come to
[2:04:45] sympathize
[2:04:46] with their captives this is the opposite
[2:04:48] of fear terror
[2:04:49] and disdain that might be expected from
[2:04:52] victims of these situations
[2:04:54] over the course of time some victims do
[2:04:56] come to develop positive feelings
[2:04:58] towards their captors
[2:04:59] they may even begin to feel as if they
[2:05:02] share common goals and causes
[2:05:04] the victim may begin to develop negative
[2:05:06] feelings towards
[2:05:07] the police or authorities so those who
[2:05:09] are actually there to
[2:05:10] protect and save them they may resent
[2:05:14] anyone who may be trying to help them
[2:05:16] escape
[2:05:16] from the dangerous situations that
[2:05:19] they're in
[2:05:20] this paradox does not happen with every
[2:05:22] hostage or victim and it's unclear why
[2:05:24] it occurs when it does
[2:05:26] many psychologists and medical
[2:05:28] professionals consider stockholm
[2:05:29] syndrome
[2:05:30] as a coping mechanism or a way to help
[2:05:33] victims
[2:05:34] handle the trauma of a terrifying
[2:05:35] situation indeed
[2:05:37] the history of the syndrome may help
[2:05:39] explain
[2:05:40] why that is so what does that mean
[2:05:43] you're tormented by a spirit
[2:05:46] but you can come to actually love that
[2:05:49] spirit
[2:05:50] but it abuses you it uses you you know
[2:05:52] there can be a cycle of shame that you
[2:05:54] know
[2:05:55] you know there was a cycle of my life
[2:05:57] you're drinking and you wake up hung
[2:05:59] over and you'd remember terrible things
[2:06:00] you did and
[2:06:01] i'll never drink again you just go back
[2:06:03] into the thing
[2:06:04] why because the stockholm syndrome
[2:06:06] because you love the spirit
[2:06:08] but there came a point where i hated it
[2:06:10] so my stockholm syndrome had to break
[2:06:12] that that thing could abuse me no more
[2:06:14] right and then i set free so anything
[2:06:16] you know so
[2:06:17] that's the thing when people actually
[2:06:19] begin to have a positive relationship
[2:06:21] with the spirit
[2:06:24] you know but but i've done you good in
[2:06:26] your life look with
[2:06:27] look where i've got you i've done so
[2:06:29] much for you i've helped you so much
[2:06:32] and then they begin to love the thing
[2:06:33] but that thing's abusing and using them
[2:06:35] tearing them down
[2:06:35] breaking them down emotionally you know
[2:06:37] mentally in everything
[2:06:39] we can't ever look at anything like that
[2:06:42] you following me we can't ever
[2:06:44] sympathize because if you
[2:06:46] sympathize with a spirit you'll never be
[2:06:47] free of that spirit
[2:06:49] and the devil would always say but i
[2:06:51] love you i love you so much
[2:06:52] and he's just an abusive partner because
[2:06:55] you'll say on one hand i love you the
[2:06:57] other hand he'll be beating you
[2:06:58] you know mistreating you making you
[2:07:00] think you're worthless you're worth
[2:07:02] nothing you'll never amount to anything
[2:07:03] but i love you you know there's a
[2:07:06] there's a
[2:07:06] way to break people and torture where
[2:07:09] where people are tortured
[2:07:11] and someone comes and interrogates them
[2:07:13] and they're the bad cop
[2:07:14] they pour it on but then what happens is
[2:07:17] someone else comes in
[2:07:18] and they're the friend they're working
[2:07:20] for the same people who are
[2:07:22] trying to get information out of out of
[2:07:23] the hostage they're working for the same
[2:07:25] government
[2:07:26] but one comes in and really threatens
[2:07:28] them and i'm gonna kill you and this is
[2:07:30] gonna happen i'm gonna get your family
[2:07:31] because they're trying to get
[2:07:32] information but then the other guy comes
[2:07:34] in
[2:07:35] and he's he's pretending to be the buddy
[2:07:39] and that's what people do to try and
[2:07:40] break people's will to get things out of
[2:07:42] them
[2:07:43] and that's what the devil does as well
[2:07:45] he comes along abuses downtrodden you
[2:07:47] know makes you feel horrible different
[2:07:49] things but then he comes along says
[2:07:51] i'm your pal we've had some good times
[2:07:53] haven't we
[2:07:57] and sometimes you say you know some
[2:08:00] people say yes we have had some good
[2:08:01] times
[2:08:02] i'm here to look at you it's fine i'm
[2:08:03] here to look after you whatever more
[2:08:06] but actually he's working for the same
[2:08:07] group that wants to destroy you
[2:08:11] because that's why when the devil comes
[2:08:14] along
[2:08:15] where'd this come from not from a root
[2:08:19] that's not from your soul where this
[2:08:22] stuff come from this is the devil trying
[2:08:25] to be your buddy let's have some good
[2:08:26] times man let's go do it again
[2:08:28] let's go do it again no no and you gotta
[2:08:30] say hold on
[2:08:31] this ends right now this ends right now
[2:08:34] i'm not dealing with you another minute
[2:08:36] you can talk to my lawyer
[2:08:38] the holy ghost is the lawyer you can
[2:08:39] talk to my people i'm done
[2:08:42] hallelujah oh but i love you no you
[2:08:44] don't love me you want to kill me
[2:08:48] amen and the lord
[2:08:50] does not want us stuck in that kind of
[2:08:52] thing he wants us free
[2:08:55] do you think it rejoice it makes him
[2:08:57] happy when he sees us go through those
[2:08:58] things
[2:08:59] you know he's our kinsmen redeemer but
[2:09:01] you know another part of being a kinsman
[2:09:03] redeemer is a kinsmen avenger who's
[2:09:04] heard of a kinsmen avenger
[2:09:06] a kinsmen avenger has the right
[2:09:09] just say if someone wronged me and they
[2:09:12] were proven to
[2:09:14] to wrong me and they were part of my
[2:09:15] family they have the right to go
[2:09:17] um ex put the avenge carry out the
[2:09:20] avenge on the one who wronged me
[2:09:22] that's the kinsmen redeemer i mean i
[2:09:23] mean a kissman avenger and our lord
[2:09:25] is a kinsmen redeemer but he's a kinsman
[2:09:27] avenger right the devil that's troubled
[2:09:30] us
[2:09:31] troubled our families troubles our
[2:09:32] children troubles our lives
[2:09:34] there will be a time holy where he is
[2:09:37] kinsman avenger
[2:09:39] and he will pour his wrath out upon
[2:09:41] those spirits
[2:09:42] and they will burn in the lake of fire
[2:09:44] and they will be no more
[2:09:46] and they'll be shown guilty and they'll
[2:09:47] be gone he will be our kinsmen avenger
[2:09:50] imagine the satisfaction imagine the
[2:09:53] satisfaction that he'll get
[2:09:54] this enemy that he made hallelujah that
[2:09:57] he's tormented his children all the way
[2:09:58] down through you can say now satan this
[2:10:00] has come to an end
[2:10:02] you know i was thinking of the words and
[2:10:03] you know in the book of revelation where
[2:10:05] the lord says it's done
[2:10:07] and all the way down through the
[2:10:08] scripture he could say to the devil
[2:10:11] it's done but it's not done i'm not
[2:10:13] finished here
[2:10:14] hallelujah what do you mean by that he
[2:10:16] walks into egypt
[2:10:18] gathers the children of israel out of
[2:10:20] there he'd say it's done so the part
[2:10:22] that's done is they've been delivered
[2:10:24] but it's not done
[2:10:25] because christ has got to come and i'm
[2:10:27] going to dwell in my people once again
[2:10:29] you know the temple's built everything's
[2:10:30] done and then the lord comes himself
[2:10:33] purchases our salvation on calvary
[2:10:36] hallelujah he says it's finished
[2:10:38] it's finished but it's not finished
[2:10:40] right he paid the price that part's been
[2:10:42] finished

[2:11:34] bride rises upon the earth
[2:11:35] but he says the devil devil is done but
[2:11:37] it's not done

[2:11:52] and then he calls the two witnesses they

[2:11:57] kingdom

[2:15:38] do you see yourself as someone trodden
[2:15:40] down who's not special who's not worth
[2:15:42] it
[2:15:42] or do you see yourself at greater value
[2:15:45] god put a greater value on your your
[2:15:47] soul than he did his own life
[2:15:50] and he'd do it all again if he had to do
[2:15:52] it or you know you're all again to
[2:15:54] purchase your salvation so if you think
[2:15:55] you're worth nothing
[2:15:56] look into the scripture and see what god
[2:15:58] thinks about you
[2:16:00] doesn't make you proud doesn't make you
[2:16:01] arrogant makes you humble if anything
[2:16:04] but just think about it lord you put my
[2:16:06] life on greater valley than your own
[2:16:08] and that's why you were born in a manger
[2:16:11] amen so let's just pray together this
