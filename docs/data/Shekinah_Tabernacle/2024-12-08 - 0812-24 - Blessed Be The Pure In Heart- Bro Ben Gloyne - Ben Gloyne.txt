TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] I [Music] praise the Lord welcome to church this morning it's good to see you [Music] all you know something it feels like a little uh Mar phone near my heart when I'm down there it would be going slowly like boom boom this never gets old coming up here it's always a bit nerve-wracking you know with then the minute I walk up here it starts going if you could hear it but it's a good thing you know we we don't want to get common when we approach the things of God like it it always should be something that we are sincere about and that that that we reverence you know I think I'd start to get worried if there wasn't a a nervousness in me when I'm walking up here if it was just like no thought at all I'd be quite like worried about myself like I'm in a bad way you know but but I think I think God sees our heart like that and he realizes these people are sincere before me and he and he he feels welcome because he's actually a gentleman he never pushes in never never never intrudes he he only comes where he's wanted you know and when he sees that feels that he's wanted he actually cuz he so wants to come he so wants to meet and when he feels welcome and wanted then he comes in he's always there always always comes where he where he welcome so we we were just praying in the um room just before the service here and you know one of the prayers was that we would you know through that that we would hear from the heart of God this morning and I believe that's what we are going to you know what what will happen and we we we just prayed Lord May the May the praise and the worship just get us into a place to where we can connect with your heart Lord and and hear from you this morning Lord because the Lord's got a heart that he wants to share and and we want to connect with that this morning and I pray that you know he'd bless brother Ben is brother Ben would also be nervous but may may he step out of the way and let the spirit of God come and just speak the heart of God to us this morning you know such a great responsibility but I'm so glad for a man that that is willing to put himself as decid to do that this morning and I just want to pray a blessing on the the those of us the the the Brethren that are a part of us that are away this morning even though you know even though you're away you are with us in our heart this morning so let's just stand and we will um just commit the service to the Lord Heavenly Father we thank you Lord that we can Lord come into your presence with a reverence in our heart Lord knowing not not Lord not not

and yet Lord you you made yourself so low Lord and like like you're even below us Lord to to stoop down lord to to lift us up Lord and it's such a powerful thing to realize this great God that we that

um so we won't have a service on Christmas day it's a Wednesday and then um also uh we can't get the church here for uh for New Year's Eve um but we will have a a testimony foot washing and communion service on the Wednesday night which is New Year's Day be a nice way to start the year isn't it amen we thank God for what he's done the previous year but you know so we just have a regular well a regular Wednesday service so not a watch night because we can't be here till after 10: but yeah but 7:30 we'll be here in community foot watching testimony special so if you have any of those that would be wonderful to to prepare also next Sunday we've got a youth service so uh BB and myself are speaking and for my part I would like it if you have any questions please send them through and we can start answering them but can I please have them not not Sunday morning or Saturday night can I have them maybe Wednesday or Thursday that'd be real nice okay so that'd be great amen praise the Lord um let's let's turn in the scripture to um uh John chapter 1 got to see what I'm doing here sorry amen who enjoyed Wednesday night wasn't that a masterpiece amen praise the Lord God bless you brother Isaac want to say thank you very much you know after that service you Christine leaned over to me and said aren't you glad you wrote down your notes for Sunday the night before on the Tuesday cuz I'm going to come and right in behind that and preach about or you'll see here but yeah the Lord has a mind and it's so neat I say Lord I'm so thankful I can be part of what you're orchestrating so praise the Lord so yep so amen so let's just read here John 1: 32-36 and we're going to go to um Matthew 5 and8 he says and John bear record saying I saw the Spirit uh descending from heaven like a dove and it Abode upon him and I knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost and I saw and bear record that this is the Son of God again the next day after uh John stood and two of his disciples and looking Upon Jesus as he walked he saith Behold the Lamb of God and then and then this is the next and brother Isaac actually oh sorry he he said he took this out of his service on Wednesday hey isn't that right you you had it in there but God had you take it out because here we are right so God has a mind you know you got to realize we're living Ser church is an event right like last Sunday brother ofand was commenting your um brother Isaac well James felt inspired I've got to get rid of this microphone and brother Isaac's got to have a cable right right and then brother Isaac stood up and said I'm so glad I'm free and I preached on the law of Liberty right so things are happening amen right you can see God's hand I trust in these things anyway amen so blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God Amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning amen gracious father truly we can say all our lives you have been faithful Lord you are the faithful and true one and even your word says Lord when we are not faithful yet you remain abide faithful so father we thank you we can come into your presence this morning we don't take it for granted Lord that we can stand in the presence of the almighty Lord Of Glory the high King Of Heaven father we thank you Lord for this privilege and we ask that you'll take the service under your Great Divine control Lord we don't want to gather just to see one another though that is wonderful but we want to see you Lord You're the one we've come to worship praise adore and tell tell how much we love Lord is you so dear God as we've read your word we're asking once again you being the great Eternal author of your word may you come live it Lord in our lives interpret it to our hearts father may you grant it we love you Lord we also want to remember those who couldn't be here today they're traveling father or that Lord away and especially want to remember oh my Robin father unwell this morning dear God has gone to the hospital I pray you touch your body Lord whatever is wrong Lord we know that you know all about it so father may you diagnose the case may touch your life Lord because we're believing as we can look into Moses's great medical chest Lord and open it up and it says I'm the Lord that heals all Thy Thy diseases so father May touch you Lord anyone else who's um unwell as well Grant it father For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning so I want to speak on blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God amen amen now this is one of the most outstanding when when John would stand here and say Behold the Lamb of God and we know when uh Jesus was baptized you know John saw the spirit of God descended upon him like a dove and brother Bram would say this is the one one of the most outstanding events in Scripture that heaven and earth United that man and God became one and as Jesus would say in the be udes blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God now to me this seeing God is Not Just well one day in glory we'll see him but no this is in everyday life you shall see him so the pure in heart will see God the impure in heart will not see God so I pray that we're all pure in heart this morning and if we're not by the end of the service we'll we'll really say Lord purify My Heart Lord amen so this word pure has got a many many different uh definitions but just want to take this one you of course it means clean pure purified by fire and different things but free from uh every ad mixture of that which is false it's sincere it's genuine now as we heard on Wednesday we know there's many devices in the man's you know you in a man's heart but I pray that our heart of hearts is is genuine it's not a mixture of things it's not a mixture of true and false or or carnal and and and divine but it's all God now we understand I'm just going to go through some things before we go into some more serious things but you know we know that we're living in the age of ladyo and now I I just Googled protest things and I thought this is the one that doesn't stand on anyone's toes where they uh this is in America they you know they're they're uh protesting against different things and then there's that guy who's honest who says we have no idea what we're talking about you know but you see the thing is this is the age of Lady oia this is the age of people's rights but we've got to we got to understand that in the you know and many many things people protest for they are just and good but I can guarantee you people who get deep into anything they'll never be remain pure in heart they will always begin to come to a place where they justify lying for their cause no matter what it is it can be a very good cause it can be right but those who get too deep in it they will end up lying for their side they're no longer pure in heart so there's a challenge in this day can we live in this world but not of this world can we live un untangled by everything that's going on around us there's a lot going on around us different things are going on but can we can we stand in the midst of it falling from both sides like the prophet said saying there's a better way to live which is in the resurrection power of Jesus Christ The Living Word of God you see so it's like you know politicians I don't you know or any social justice Warrior or environmentalist or whoever it may be you know I doubt very much they start with the intent they're going to become Shady crooked people like people who get into politics I don't think that they're there to say let's Wrangle a deal let's do something that's crooked no they have a genuine desire I want to make my country better I want to to solve problems I want to you know create Solutions I want you know all those things but they get into the spirit of politics and you see where they end up amen so they don't stay pure in heart and no one in these things does stay pure in heart sadly doesn't matter how good the person is they always lie for their cause we never want to lie for our cause whatever our cause is right we don't need to lie for this message that's for sure God brings his word to pass he interprets his word right he proves his word but we never want to get so entangled by things that we're no longer pure and heart but the world wants to entangle you that's for sure I guarantee you that much amen so now as you read the purpose the purpose of being pure and heart is that you'll see God and not just every day I mean sorry not just one day but you'll see the supernatural hand of God every day in your life now Jesus is our example right who wants to be like Jesus amen I I believe that's why we gather we want to be like him now Jesus you if I could say this as a man he saw God every day in his life he saw the spirit of God leading him he said the son can do nothing till the father shows him and what the uh father does the son does likewise so he was led by Vision you say well I'm not I've never seen a vision in my life and some of us will never see Visions but there should be a pulsation of the Holy Ghost in our hearts that directs us guides us corrects us amen and that's the same as seeing God right because you see God's hand in your life so he was you know we know Jesus as as as John would say Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the of the world and his so his heart he was he was a lamb right he had the same emotional realm like we do he was a man like us right so he wasn't made different in that sense he he could be sad angry bitter jealous Envy Strife malice hatred he could have all those emotions he could hold grudges if he wanted to he was built that way he was built like you and I friends you know sure he was born sinless but yet he had that same he could have been a bitter man yeah he had every right to be an angry butter callous man he had every right Amen to to be that but no he knew he was the Lamb of God and he stayed as the Lamb of God Amen and we know that the reason that he stayed the Lamb of God is because he was our sacrifice right but then also he had to be the Lamb of God that the dove of God could descend upon him the Holy Ghost and brother Braham teaches it very well that he says that you know a lamb and a dove have the same kind of a nature that a dove would never descend upon a wolf never would descend upon any kind of Beast of you know a hyena or some kind of wicked creature no it's got to have the same nature their Natures must blend together and if the natures are contrary then the Holy Ghost would never have descended upon him I trust you're with me this morning right so he had to have a lamb nature and brother Bram tells us that that the reason that we don't see God in our lives is because we don't have that lamb nature anymore amen the joy of our Salvation the peace of God goes out of us because we let that carnal nature we're born with rise up and take preeminence and the dove takes her flight amen but he says now that and and and so when that happens you won't see God in your life right well then what do you do and I'll come to the end of my service just become a lamb again right just become a lamb again amen because you want his nature to match your nature you say well I know all the doctrine of the message that's all fine the devil does too I know the Bible back to front that's good the devil does too but he can't have the nature of a lamb I mean he can't have God's Own nature and the Bible says that we would be partakers of the divine nature I mean what is is that that's a lamb nature amen amen hallelujah see we got to we got to allow the lamb nature to take over and stay in in charge CU we are the Lambs of God right remember the Book of Revelation says his wife you know the marriage of the Lamb has come so what's going to a lamb will marry a lamb same Natures will blend together right and this is the marriage season is going on right now and so brother Braham says now you know sometimes I wonder if that's the reason there's so much trouble in the church if we are the Lambs of God we should have the nature of a lamb if we expect the dove to abide you believe it I do now if you'll watch the dove the reason it stayed on the lamb because their Natures was the same and the reason that the dove stayed on stays on a Christian he will stay there as long as he is a lamb but when he takes a different nature the dove will take its flight you see this Dove was first a spotless lamb the Bible said he was a spotless lamb and the lamb could not depend upon his own travel a lamb had to be led or guided or shepherded you see and we always as I've said before we are always will be the Lambs of God doesn't matter how old we are how experienced we think in our Christian Life we always will be Lambs we always need to be led brother brah says the big problem is we get our heads so full of Christian knowledge we think we can lead ourselves the dove takes its flight when you are dependent upon yourself the Holy Ghost takes its flight you say well you know does that mean I lose my salvation no but you'll sure lose your Victory you'll sure lose your joy and you won't see God Amen but we want to see God don't we in everyday life Lord I want to see you live I want to see your word manifested I want to see you prove yourself amen that's what we want amen and brother BR would say you know he said and um I've heard it but now I see you know brother Jack Moore would say to him you know um you know I guess you you he said one of the greatest messages you ever preached in Shri Port was the lamb and the dove but he'd say well I guess you know uh but your message being so strenuous today you don't get to preach those kind of things and then brother R said well when I miss that I miss my message so if we if we forget this part we've actually missed the message of the hour Amen to be the Lambs of God amen amen because we want to see God now as as would say in Timothy you know but all those henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Life of I me crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but also to them that love his glorious um appearing I mean that love is appearing now brother says the appearing is going on now what is that happening that's God proving his word in our lives I mean you shall see God you shall see the supernatural you'll see the power to forgive you'll see that you can't hold a grudge why because you see God Amen you see the Lord moving right amen because you know see we have to have a pure lamb heart anything contrary to that nature the the you know the dove will never abide and so we can't be a wolf we can't have anything that's contrary to the nature of a lamb not a goat that kicks and you know kicks kicks against everything and eats anything right we don't want to have that God of a nature right no we can't be as cunning of a um as a fox you cannot be cunning as a fox in your heart right no we got to have a pure heart amen see see the Holy Ghost wants to take your soul that that it is his AB Abode forever amen see so we got to be willing to surrender our schemes and our plans surrender our own ambition Amen to be the greatest Church we've got to speak about a see many say well I have a a a pure heart but they forget the purpose of why they're doing things I mean see see what what what are we here for that the last one will come in what are we here for that God will prove his word in its completion amen everything God spoke of the Christian Church would be manifested here right but we've got to have a nature of a lamb for it to happen amen see do we love his appearing do you love his presence in your life does it mean more than life to you to have his presence in you to know that he is your God and he dwells in your soul is he more than your next meal to you is he more than whatever your plans are over Christmas does he mean more do you love his appearing amen I say if you're pure in heart you will love his appearing amen but it takes a pure a pure heart to do it a pure heart does not have any selfish gain in it Hallelujah it does not do anything based on what it wants to do now there is an occasion in the book of Acts where where where um where in uh the uh city of Samaria there was a revival going on and there was a man there called Simon the Sorcerer And he was he he was you know he was a great man uh among the city but then he got caught up in what God was doing and even says in the scripture that he got baptized he became one of the Believers and then he and then when Peter uh Peter came down into the city he laid his hands on the Believers they received the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost didn't fall on him and he was wondering you you know he he even thought well maybe if I give some money you know I can get this gift and then I can impart eternal life who doesn't want to impart eternal life that's right as a Believer but what's the motive in doing it you see his motive is look I can I can ear ear a bit of bit of coin out of this deal right I can earn a bit of prestige what will people will think highly of me oh I'm a spiritual I've really deep cuz God Lives I've got the mechanics and the Dynamics I've really made it that's selfish ambition I guarantee you that's not the dove leading you that's a wolf nature leading you but you see even even Peter would because he came to Peter says look you know can I buy this I want to I want to be part of the Believers I want to be an afficial part of the body of Christ but Peter says look your heart's not right in the sight of God you're you're all bound up with B the gall of buness and the bond of iniquity see his heart was not pure see he saw what God was doing supernaturally but he did not see God's plan and that's a big thing we can see God move but you got to see the pure in heart will see God they will see his Plan of Redemption they will see what God wants done in their lives praise the Lord amen amen see we got to be careful many people do the right thing because it's expected of them so outwardly they do it because it's expected of them but what's going on in their heart what's their motive what is your motive in serving the body I just say I'm going to throw some questions out there sorry this is this is not a dialogue but I just want you to think about these things what is the why do you serve the body that people will think you're something will people will think you're servant hearted or are you genuinely servant hearted I mean do you do it because you know well it's expected of me and then you feel sorry for yourself that's not a pure heart a pure heart is Lord I get to serve the body of Christ your redeemed ones I get to come in contact with the with the promise of the ages the bride of Christ the finality of that bride I get to serve part of that body I get to rub shoulders with the Eternal amen amen amen I get to rub shoulders with the prophecy fulfilled the word being made flesh amen so a pure heart you see brother BR would make this uh you know make this comment he says now I can't I can't see nothing but the grace of God that's my makeup I always did believe in grace I'm just Grace all over that's all of it isn't even in my life when I was a boy I couldn't see nothing but Grace Grace Just Grace Grace they say I'll scratch my back and I and I'll scratch yours well that's an awful expression I'll say that's not a lamb expression that's a wolf expression that's a self- ambitious expression I don't care whether you scratch mine or not if yours needs scratching I'll scratch you anyhow see grace yes sir see grace works by love I mean if you need it regardless of if you've never done nothing for me if I don't have one thing to do with you um sorry I don't have one thing to to do with you if you need it I'll do it anyhow Grace be be because that you need it he says look I'm not looking see a pure heart is not looking to see what it can get back it just wants to give you need a hand I'm here I've got two yeah right you know you need a help I'm here you need a someone to pray with you I'm here you a selfish heart a pure heart does not look at what it can get in return I mean a selfish heart wants to look a pure heart I have trust I don't get this mixed up but you know what I mean right a pure Heart's Not Looking for return it's not an investment I sew into my life therefore you've got to sew back into mine right no that's a pure heart never looks that way I mean a pure heart does not feel sorry for itself when it it's helping it's motiv is Lord praise God I can bless I can bless your bride amen I can bless your people Lord praise the Lord amen I get an opportunity to be good to your bride hallelujah hallelujah because I Love You Lord that's my motive that should be our motive should be the love of God Amen see a pure heart helps without thinking of recognition yeah well you know brother B says he likes recognition it's nice when people say you did a good job right we're human but we don't help because of those things oh my recognition Tally's gone down this week this is not right I'm not you know no we should never think that way a pure heart don't get offended if it's not thanked enough or at all well that I didn't get what I expected that's not a pure heart am mean a pure heart is not offended if they're not even mentioned or seen it's the behind the scenes things that are important but we should never think well no one recognized me doing it God sees you remember we should do everything to each other as unto the Lord because many times we look back and say man I wish Lord I could wash your feet when your feet were not washed in Simon's I wish I could have kissed you and made you feel welcome Lord I wish I could have welcomed you in under you from from from out of the hot sun into the cool of the room and made you feel so welcome we can when we when we serve one another we're doing that if you've got a see the pure and heart will see God they'll see God and one another they'll see the word and flesh in the body of Christ amen so we can't go back and say I wish I could have done that for you now and you don't do it here right because the pure in heart they just they just do it as unto the Lord am mean a pure in heart is not offended if someone doesn't shake their hand or greet them or talk to them at church there should be no offense in us oh that brother didn't shake my hand so that sister and why do you come do you do you come to church just to get your hand shaking I'm just making it sound ridiculous because it is people get offended and they stop coming to church because they didn't get greeted enough brother cabin's there that's all the greeting I need all week he makes me feel welcome you know praise God Amen but even if he didn't shake my hand doesn't mean I'm going to quit and I'm not coming to this place anymore no I'm not come I don't come here I'm not I I don't want to make this a joke but you got to think about it people actually literally stop coming to church because they feel offended because people don't shake their hand really and you go you go all other kind of places you don't get offended see well that brother or sister snubbed me so what if they did Brother BR makes a statement he says that God will allow the whole church to turn against you to see what you'll do what are you going to do oh well I'm going to go off on my py party that ain't going to help you that just breeds more wolves in your lives I don't want to pack of wolves or a pack of dogs in here I want them all dead I want the Lamb of God just to reign supreme in everything I do amen see why do we why do we come to church I come here to worship God you say well no you come because you're the pastor I'll guarantee you if I was not the pastor of this church I'd be here am mean if I never had any kind of public kind of thing in the front F in the back the time I'd say praise God cuz I would want to he I would worship God in spirit and in truth I come to church to tell tell this world this is this is the side I've picked cuz God found me when I was lost and undone so I'm I'm telling the world this side I'm on this side I'm on jesus' side the words called me to stand by his sight say Lord I'm here amen that's why that's why I come to church I don't come to church cuz I'm the pastor of the church it's got nothing to do with it amen a pure someone who's pure in heart they friendships with brother and brothers and sisters in the church are not based upon the office or influence that person holds because the Bible says to have respector if person is sin absolutely right so you don't buddy buddy up to the whoever you think are the important people in the church just because they are that way all right I'm just reading through these points a pure in heart does not name drop someone who's an authority to push their agenda or distorts what they might have said I remember like yesterday this is a four-year-old but but adults do it too okay William came out to me can I do whatever I said no you can't maybe it's jumping on the trampoline cuz he wanted his turn I said no not now okay then I hear him run outside girls dad said I can jump on the trampoline now what is he doing he his he's a four-year-old okay he wants to jump on the trampoline right human nature I want something okay but what did he do he Nam drop someone in Authority I've just told him the opposite or it's not his time but he'll name drop me to get what he wants I say that's not a lamb nature lamb but he's a four-year-old you expect four-year-olds to be like that a cuz they're fall right but then you get adult what they call mature Christians who will name drop Pastor pastor's wife Deacon Deacon's wife whatever and say well they said this and and really if people took what people said of what what we have said they think men they're crazy but they name drop to what to to sway things how they think things should be oh hold on maybe I need to release some press statements or something this is the official you know like was it in America they have their political ads and you know I Donald Trump approves you know approved this message kind of deal you know but the thing is there's a problem it's not a pure nature it's not a nature of a lamb to use people in authority to swing things your way amen amen we should not do that say to be pure pure in heart is to do the right thing just because it's not expected amen we do everything as unto the Lord our whole makeup and motive and objective should be Lord I'm just thankful you found me that should be our life that should be the motivation of your life Lord I'm so thankful you saved me you found me I wanted to go the other direction I sure did but goodness and mercy followed me got a hold of me turned me around and I'm so thankful he did not quit on me so that should be the motivation of our life that that will give you a lamb nature when you think about that you wanted to go that way God said no I'm not going to let you go you can't go that way you go my way thank you Lord amen glory amen now David would wait here where are we here making sure I'm lining up here now David was called a man after God's Own Heart what a test Tony wouldn't wouldn't you like God to say that about you she or he was a was a Believer after my own heart amen that shall see I have found David the son of Jesse a man after my own heart which shall fulfill all my will amen I want to fulfill all of God's will not just part of it all of his will all of his word Lord fulfill it in my life Lord amen concerning a Believer now if you look at the heart of David David had David had the nature of a of a lamb he had a nature of a lamb see he was he was the kind of a man he said Lord as the heart panth for the water Brook after the water book so panteth my soul after thee Oh God see he wanted to be in the presence of God and knew that the you know the heart the which is the deer you know thirsts for life it needs water if it's been torn by you know maybe a wolf or something and it got away it must get to water to drink it so he knew that that this desire in his heart was a life or death kind of desire he said my soul thirst is for God for the Living God When shall I come and and and appear before him then he'd say in Psalms 84 he said for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of wickedness now you think about this a doorkeeper doesn't even go in a doorkeeper keeps the door so it's like for example if I was a doorkeeper of here I'd be standing outside the front door I'd welcome everyone but I'd be outside I wouldn't even come I'd be on the side but he said I'd rather be that guy in the house of God than dwell in the tents of wickedness I'd rather just be there see he was pure in heart he was just satisfied just to be around the Lord amen that was a satisfying portion Lord to be in your presence that makes me happy that that satisfies me see a pure in heart don't care what part of the body of Christ they are they're not they don't have selfish ambition to be the main one have the main influence be the be the public whatever no they don't care about that all they want want to do is serve God Amen see this is this is what this is what we should be amen we shouldn't be upset you know whatever God has made us we should just be content Lord Lord I'll be a one day in your presence is better than a thousand amen amen hallelujah this is this is how we you say well how do you get into that kind of a heart as I said before Lord I'm so thankful you found me I'm so thankful you called me I'm so thankful that I could hear your word in in my day I could see the I could see the Mighty God unveiled in my life in my day I can see your Plan of Redemption in me I'm not just looking back in history and say well God did this and brother BR no I see him today God today Lord I'm so thankful you saved me today I'm so thankful that salvation is real Redemption is a reality Amen to be Sav from sin is a reality amen that's what I'm thankful for amen that's not just a changing of a mindset trying to trying to do what's accepted no but to actually be changed from the inside by God that he can live in my life that that satisfies me that satisfies me Lord your goodness of Mercy has followed me all the days of my life that satisfies me Lord hallelujah amen just to be around where you're at God I'm happy it's like brother BR would tell the story of a there's a colored brother um America and he and you know he's on his on his deathbed and they thought he had died but he came back and they asked him MOS where were you he said well I was there in glory and an angel came and said Moos here's your here's your crown and your robe well done and he said don't talk to me out about a robe and a crown I just want to see him Hallelujah to me that's a that's a lamb nature who cares about rewards just to see him Hallelujah he's already paid it in full I feel so rewarded anyway if you care but no just to know him as life see a pure in heart that's all they care about they don't care about rewards don't care about recognition they just want to see him I want to said the Bible says in Revelations those are are sealed with the mark of God in their forehead shall see him face to face I that's more than a satisfying reward for me just to see the one who died for me I'm very happy with that hallelujah amen now you look at David David was an incredible man so you think about it there came a there came a stage in his life because remember his desire was he just wanted to be in God's presence that's all he cared about really more than being King more than whatever he just wanted to be where God was then he came to a stage in his life where where God gave him rest all around about him he was older in age now he hadd been you know running from Saul was over he was crowned King he you know the kingdom had been established all these things so he came to a stage where he says Lord I want to build you a house you've given me a great palace I've got this I live in a house of Cedar but God you dwell in tense I want to make you a house so you think about it here he is he has rest he doesn't have to go fight battles he's got the ability the resources and the time to build what he really wanted to do for God anyway think about it but then God turns around and tells him no you can't do this this is not your lot I'm not allowing you to do what you really want to do in life what you're a sole ambition is life I I'm not going to let you do it now David if he was not pure in heart he would have thrown a big hissy fit he would have built it anyway he had the Revelation he had the plans he had all those things God gave to he was said no I'm just going to do it anyway and as um you know someone clipped out I think brother Donnie Reagan asking a question can we be no Christians like David was a noch Christian God told him no and he said yes Lord yes Lord can we be that kind of a Believer this morning I mean when God says no even though because God knew David heart God knew you know it wasn't a shock to God that David said Lord I want to build you a house he would have seen this seen this desire building over the years I mean that's why he would have be David was rejoicing when the ark was carried into a city because he would have thought praise God now the I can come back into the city I can build him a temple he can have a place to dwell in worthy to his name greater than tent greater than this little you know Tabernacle and all these things no I can build him something that you know that that reflects what I think of him and yet God would tell him no and he and and God actually told him no to such a degree he said you'll never see it when you die your son will do it now can we be that kind of a believer that God God even knows it's our desire but he tells you no can you be that person that's a lamb nature Lord you're leading me I wanted to go this way and do the SE he wasn't doing anything contrary to his word he was doing something according to his word he wasn't going out into sin no he's wanting to do something for God but God said you can't do it and what did he do and you think about David can we be a no Christian balum was not a no kind of a Christian he worshiped God he knew God when God spoke to him he didn't say who are you he knew exactly who he was and God remember remember Moab hired balam to come and curse Israel right and then and then so so so the moabites um went to go get balum and balum said I'll pray about it that night God said don't do it now he didn't have a lamb nature he had a wolf carnal nature see he used the gift in his life for his own ends I pray none of us are in that condition that's a miserable horrible place to be that's a wolf nature see we're all born with a gift of respective of we you know got a lamb nature a wolf nature all gifted people and so balam he was told no by God God but he decided he's going to go anyhow you see and so he wasn't pure in heart he did not see God's Plan of Redemption he failed to see the smitten Rock following Israel he failed to see the brass serpent he sure did not hear the shout of the king in their Camp am mean he did not see the Plan of Redemption for Israel he did not see salvation had come to them they going into their inheritance he saw none of it because he was not pure in heart amen he was he he he did more than what God told him to do God told him no he says going anyhow can we be those kind of people where God says no we say yes Lord because you think about it when God do we have it here see you thy days will be fulfilled Thou shalt sleep with thy fathers he says now out of your own bals will come a son and he shall build a house for my name now David what did he do when he heard that he praised God and then he didn't just say now well he can he can sort it out because a pure and heart wants the best for every generation they never want to hold you say well you know David could have been well I had to fight my enemies I had to run from the king I had to go through hardship well my son can go through the same thing that's not pure in heart you know people like for example people have you know you know difficult newborns oh actually every newborn is difficult they're a baby and then people who are not pure in heart they'll say well I didn't have any help no one helped me with my children our difficult they can suffer like me that's not pure in heart pure in heart should be Lord I remember was like I don't want them to walk that way I want them to have it easier than I did amen and that's what we should be for the next Generation Lord I want to I want to make it easier for them I don't want to make it as sure we all had rugged roads maybe previous generations but they don't have to go through the same things see someone's got to break the cycle where it's Lord may I be a stepping stone for them that they can go higher than I can ever go may they they can climb higher than I could ever achieve Lord may I be a stepping stone you see the pure in heart will be that way David was pure and hard he said Lord well if I'm not going to build the temple I'm going to get all the material together and he did and he didn't just do that he L he said Lord inspire me to write songs that I will physically never hear when your temples built but Hallelujah and he didn't just do that but he called the singers and got them trained that when the dedication meetings came they didn't have to work out what to do that's right he got everything ready for that Temple to be built he made it so easy for Solomon that's right to fulfill the word of God should we not be the same way should we not have that same Heart Lord I want it easy for my children to serve God lord I want it easy for them to come into your presence Lord I want it easy for them to get victory in their lives I want it easy Lord for for you to move Among Us amen not that we you know they should never have to repeat the things we went through that's right we went through them for a for a for a purpose but that was us we don't ever want it just to be a repeat see David David could have David could have seriously uh what do you call it he could have sabotaged the temple being built because he was he was told he couldn't do it but he's pure in Heart Lord help us Amen brother Brown would speak about those who had gone on before him they would you know the early Pentecostals how they would stand on the um Street corn has been eggs throwing at that made fun of all those things the street meetings they had that he could stand in Auditorium and he could you know he could preach the way he did he said they paved the way for him are we paving the way for our families are we doing that I pray the pure in heart will because you know I doubt very much that the um you know you know those early Believers there kicked out of their churches they had to meet in Barns or or basements or on the street whatever more I doubt very much they saying Brethren we're Paving the away they just wanted to serve God they were just interested in Lord you have revealed your word to me amen I want you to live Lord I want freedom to worship you they weren't all all this big kind of this no they just they just were walking with God are we doing the same thing their motive was Lord I want you to live hallelujah praise the Lord a pure in heart will realize all things work together for good amen if you're pure in heart you realize yes Lord this is for my good amen even to have difficult look I think literally all of our babies were difficult babies I see people with newborns I don't think man well they better get what I got no my prayer is Lord may they have easy children amen and and if they're children are difficult Lord help them how can we make it easier for them because that happened to us for our good y God was molding Us in those days amen everything works together for our good see the pure in heart will say yes Lord you say well do you know what it's doing in your life that moment no do I need to know do I need God doesn't we don't have a stand up meeting every morning and God says now this and this is this is going to happen the pure and heart says Lord I trust you I don't understand but I Trust You Lord You're my shepherd you've proven yourself in the past you'll prove yourself again and you are proving yourself amen that's the pure in heart should be amen no they don't say well if they got difficult children they deserve it and all these things no the pure in heart says Lord how can I help see the pure and heart do not despise those who have it easier than them or or it's perceived that's a pure and heart they don't get resentful cuz others have an easier road than them we all have different battles not one battle is actually harder than the other because it's for you it'll be your hardest battle right someone may look over and say oh that's nothing cuz they've had a hard battle but you may look at their trial and say that's nothing cuz it's an individual walk we can never see the pure in heart does not judge one another by one another the pure and heart does not judge a church by a different Church we're all different this is not a franchise folks praise God this ain't a franchise friends every church is Sovereign because every church has different battles every church has different kind of people every church has is in a different location praise God so the word is preached slightly different at every church to meet the need in that church amen so we got to realize everything works together for our good Lord praise the Lord now the impure in heart will compare the impure in heart will will get jealous Saul had a jealous heart you notice this here this is after see when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistines sorry yeah uh that the woman came out of all the cities of Israel singing dancing to meet King Saul so they weren't even there to sing for David they there to sing sing for Saul amen then they sung the song D you David slaying his 10,000s and Saul is slain his thousands you see the pure in heart if Saul was pure in heart he said praise God praise God the next generation is mightier in battle than me praise God that they can breakthrough and prayer better than me praise God that God lives in their life more than me praise God they've seen more of the supernatural than me praise God their character is more like Christ than mej that should be the pure in heart you see but Saul was impure he got jealous he eyed David from that day forth you think about that how how Saul could have had it such a better way where he could have realized I have God's anointed champion in my in my Army in my nation I've got so I've got God's anointed man Hallelujah see if he was pure in heart he would have rallied around that gift and said God sure I failed you but Lord I'm going to build a platform this man will never fail you Hallelujah but you see people care so much about their reputation and what people think about them that's not being pure in heart you should care about what God thinks about you amen your reputation in heaven means a lot more than upon the Earth cuz the whole world could love you but what about in heaven that or the whole world can hate you but what about in heaven you see Saul did not have he wasn't he wasn't pure in heart see we should rejoice when the younger generation sings better than us am preaches better than us prays better than us is more Christlike at their age than we were Hallelujah shouldn't we be happier but man man you look at these young Fells here man I wasn't that guy when they were that you this age thank God you see I hear people that you know older one yeah well older than me but you you know you know they when their when their children go from being just children in the family to their identity now their own they become adults and then people start comparing well at that age I was better than that guy that's not pure in heart I was earning more money at your age then what's that got to do with with the price of fish who cares but it's an impure heart comparing I'm better than you that's the whole no we should be Lord I want them to be better than than me amen I want them to know you better than me Lord I want them to earn more I want them to have everything more than I have praise God that this how we should be if you do not have that heart you do not have the nature of a lamb if you get jealous of your children because they do better than you you have a wrong nature amen that's right praise God see it doesn't go about we are just thankful you know when we see God move we don't get jealous when it's in someone else's life and not our own the pure in heart just want to see God Amen And when they see God move they they're like Simeon of old in the temple when they picked up baby Jesus said Thank You Lord mine eyes have seen thy salvation we're just satisfied Lord You're fulfilling your word amen praise the Lord amen but you see David had moments we got to be careful how we treat one another the pure in heart do things without any selfish motive we don't want to be good to one another because then we can hold that as leverage as we read the quote earlier ago brother said I don't care if you scratch my back I'm just going to scratch yours because I'm graceful over now David David David In This Moment here see he actually I'm just going to jump back and forth to this because he said after he did this his heart smok him because he had cut off Saul's skirt so he was convicted because he because you realized In This Moment his men are saying look now you can you can end this thing we know you're anointed king this man is the obstacle standing in the way of your ministry this man is in the way of God fulfilling his word in your life this man's the problem look what he's done to you he's done this and this and this and this and David thought well you know he didn't want to kill him but he thought I'll just get one over him cuz Imagine The Leverage now that little rip piece of garment held that's right right Saul you see what I did to you you know what I could have done to you some people say they forgive but they don't forgive some people let things go they don't let things go in their heart they actually don't let it go it's leverag now against that person it's not pure in heart I'm not looking at anyone particular it's not pure in heart you see when you really forgive you forgive you say Well it still hurts but then you have a but in your heart you feel sorry for that person before the throne of grace you can actually pray for them right but you see this is why his heart's motive is because he was convicted because he went there with a wrong motive because he he did that to have leverage over Saul and this is why he is convicted see David David genuinely loved Saul he was pure in heart he did not hold he did not hold what Saul did against him when he died now we're just going to Sor we're going to find this here David no wait do I have this here is this wait all skirt no it's not there one here we are when David heard that Saul died he did not rent his clothes and weep because it was expected of him he did not he did not see see those who are in Pure Heart they don't just do things which are expected they do it out of a pure heart their motive is right it's not a selfish motive so when David ripped his clothes and rent them likewise his men did all the same because he was genuinely grieved that Saul his brother had fallen I mean David was grieved out of a pure heart for soul how do we feel about people that fall how do we feel about people that go into the world how do we feel do we have a genuine grief in our heart for that person or do we say well they deserved it they reap what you know you reap what you s see an impure heart will always bring scripture into it too just like a pure heart brings scripture impure heart brings scripture as well when when we see people fail when we see people fall do we in our hearts do we do we say well basically I told you so you know they they're now reaping what they sowed so they deserve it you know they should have listened to me is this how we feel or we genuinely grieve like like like David was see David David Grieves all out of a pure heart he was my brother in Christ the anointing of the Lord was upon Him amen the same Prophet that anointed me anointed him we're in the same Fellowship together amen he was a good pastor he paved the way for me he did he did pave the way for David right see David but David what about all the evil that he tried to do to you he tried to kill you more than once he hated You Without a Cause but a pure heart doesn't look at that amen it's mourning because love covers a multitude of sins amen so let's ask the question how do you feel when something terrible happens to somebody well they deserve that you repot your so all this nonsense no you should be genuinely grieved like David was for Saul amen he says here David could have rung his neck a few times speaking of Saul he could but he just let it go he never said nothing he sure could have done it he went over and cut off the tail of his coat one night came back and said look here you see yes sir he could have done it but he just let him alone he could have broke his congre up and Scattered them he started an organization of himself if he wanted to but he didn't do it he just let Saul go on let God do the fighting the pure in heart lets God take control of the situation cuz we going to realize we forget what Spirit we're of as uh brother Isaac put this up on Wednesday how how the disciples they weren't welcome into a certain Village so they asked Jesus should we call fire down from heaven like Elijah did they realized that the same anointing that was on Elijah was on them same anointing which is Christ right but they're asking can we use it this way like he did and Jesus said you don't know what manner of spirit you're of see the son of man has not come to destroy men's lives but to save them and they went to a and they went their way to another Village you see the son of man is revealed in the church now right he says you forget what manner of spirit are so when you get angry and Kindel and resentful against someone you forget what Spirit you're of when you hear something goes wrong to someone's life say they deserve it you forget what Spirit you're of we should never have malice or hatred or Envy or any kind of negative thought against anyone that's how we should be amen I'm going to I'm going to wrap this up with this now a boy a boy was a country boy he asked us you know he heard about this great God remember the pure in heart will see God right and so he ask his mama mama can any man see God he's so great she said ask the pastor how would you expect me to know well he went to the Pastor said pastor could any man see God said no son no no man can see God and live he went to a Sunday school teacher and said she said no no one can see God and live uh he loved nature there was an island just above us called a six mile island uh and old man fished up there just gone to Glory recently old white beard and white here one day the little boy had been with him up the river coming back down the river it it come a rain and the sun was going down in the west and causing a rainbow in the east as the old fisherman tipped along with his OES tipping the water is only a Boatman can appreciate nature and when he be to tip them like that the first thing you know making a noise as he tipped along like that he looked up all the leaves was washed off from the dust in the midsummer and seen the rainbow he he sat pulling again he stopped his Z he let them tip as the boat sailed along and after a while the little boy sitting in the stern of the boat noticed noted on the Old Fisherman's face tears rolling down his white beard the little boy got all excited run up to the middle of the boat fell down at the Old Fisherman's lap said sir I'm going to ask you a question my father could not answer my pastor could not answer my Sunday school could um could not answer my mother could not answer I said what's that Sunny if God's so great why can't we see him he just pulled the OES in his lap and commenced crying put his arm around the little lad said sunny all I've seen for the past 40 years has been God see so much God in the old man's heart that he could see him everywhere he looked if you get him in here you can see him out there that's right he will use your eyes to look through you'll not see harms and dangers and faults and things you'll only see God whatever it is hallelujah why because the old man was pure in heart Hallelujah and so friends we just leave it with this if you're just seeing harms and dangers and faults what nature have you got what nature is living I say it's not the nature of the Lamb am mean because if you got the nature of the Lamb on the inside sure all the dangers and harms and faults are around you but you don't see them you see God and mean because the pure in heart shall see God Amen so we should never be caught up in those things if you're caught up in those things of life you you need to let God change your nature amen back to back to the nature of a lamb again amen because friends if we're If we're honest with ourselves we say Lord I want to see you I want to see you Lord I want to be pure in heart amen that Lord when you spoke the Beatitudes about the pure and heart shall see you I was on your mind when you spoke that word am me because you because you knew Lord that when you spoke that there'd be someone to fulfill that and you thought of me Lord that I'd be pure in heart that my heart would not be full of malice and jealousy and self ambition and pride and what I can get out of life and what you know how I can be seen among the Believers but Lord that my life would be pure that I just want to serve you whatever position I'm in whatever I'm called to do Lord I don't do it out of a selfish motive I don't do it out of a motive of trying to be looked at and seen and appreciated but Lord I want to do it as unto you Lord that my whole life is not unto me Lord it's not me living no more Lord It's you living in me Lord because I want to see you in my life I want to see your Supernatural hand I want to see your word fulfilled I want to see the power of God on you demonstrated Lord I want to see you I want to see your Plan of Redemption I want to see my part in your Plan of Redemption Lord I want to see you I don't want to see a selfish motive or a selfish ambition or some shady deal I pull over like some social justice Warrior or politician trying to lie for their cause I don't want to be like that Lord I want to be pure in heart ask you the question do you want to be that way this morning amen well then what is the solution for it just become a lamb again go back to that time when you first met made him yeah I mean go back to that time when the world seemed new that the sunrise seemed so much more better than Sunset so much more better rainbow just just the small things like there would have been plenty of rainbows you know there where fishing but that man had so much of God on the inside he's still God you know you think about rainbow that's God remembering his Covenant when that rainbow goes out maybe he started crying about that when he was roaring said Lord you put that bow in the Sky many years ago when you when you put it there for Noah and you put it there that you would remember your promise to man that you'll never flood the Earth again and Lord you've given us a greater Covenant than that about a flooding of an Earth but you gave us that Covenant that day on Calvary and I'm part of that Covenant so Lord when I see that rainbow I see that promise of Calvary I say thank you Lord I'm a beneficiary of that maybe he started crying because of that Lord and then as mine went back to when he first met God many many years ago why because his heart was soft and tender it wasn't callous with strife and envy like a wolf hardened it was soft I said friends let's go back there I want to go back there I don't want to have a wolf nature I don't want to be oh you say well there's all these burdens of life and things that should not change the nature that we are of right Jesus was a lamb in in front of the Sanhedrin he was a lamb on the Sea of Galilee he was a lamb serving his father as a carpenter he was a lamb on the mount Transfiguration he was a lamb here's a lamb in Hell amen here's a lamb everywhere heures a lamb resurrected Triumph it over hell death in the grave we can be the same way he went through far more but brother R makes a story he says about a man who um maybe we just had the musicians come but you know U brother B tells a story of uh of a um of a man and he's actually from South Africa and you know they were they were there and they were having a church split all this fussing and fighting had gone on and you know he was walking up the hill to walking up the hill to the church and then he heard a man walking behind him and this man was struggling you know walking like this and he had this big massive weight on the back of his back of his you on his back he's walking up this hill and he turns around this man sees him and and and he sees the man carrying the big weight and he re and and he sees nail scarred hands and he realizes he's in a vision and this man asks a question he says Lord are you carrying the sin of the world he says he says no I'm just carrying your sin up the hill it changed his life made him back a lamb again there's all this fussing fighting going on in the church but when he had that Vision he didn't care said Lord you're packing my sin up the hill Lord You're the one who's carrying me all the way Lord and he became a lamb again can't we do it friends can't we let God sweeten our Spirits once again I'm speaking about myself too Lord I don't want to be be critical and angry and frustrated and all these things Lord I want to be sweet forgiving understanding I want to be humble I want to be kind I want to turn the other cheek Lord I don't want to hold anything against anyone Lord I Just Want to Have a Heart full of thankfulness Lord for what you have done for me friends if you feel that way if you say Lord I don't remember the time of your sweetness anymore it seems like a very far thing away where where where there was that time where I could forgive I could let go I could say Lord not my will but thy will be done do you want to go back to that time let's stand to our feet this morning shall we I invite you if you want to raise your hands to the Lord with sincerity not because
