[3:21] to to just get of it relaxed before he
[3:25] he speaks to the people and those
[3:27] stories are pretty cool because um
[3:29] usually it has something to do with his
[3:30] life where the lord has helped him
[3:32] either to overcome or to help someone
[3:35] else overcome
[3:36] so those stories are are actually like
[3:38] little testimonies you throw
[3:40] in there for us to go wow you know he

[3:46] vessel so mightily
[3:48] and you can't take that away from him i
[3:50] listened to some
[3:51] testimonies on the internet today and
[3:53] they like little breadcrumbs you open

[7:31] the church says
[7:32] amen amen amen so just before we start
[7:37] got a little thing i just felt late to
[7:39] read i don't really do it this way but
[7:41] it was something that stood out when i
[7:43] read it today
[7:44] and it says it's the resurrection of
[7:46] lazarus in 1951
[7:49] he says i can see him he wasn't very
[7:52] much to look at
[7:53] the bible said he was no beauty we
[7:57] should desire him
[7:58] he wasn't a great big six footer he was
[8:01] a little frail fellow
[8:03] he straightened his little frame up and
[8:06] stood up his shoulders
[8:07] and he said he was gray in his beard
[8:10] before he even was 30 years old stooped
[8:13] his shoulders up like this
[8:15] and said thy brothers shall rise again
[8:18] he's talking about lazarus he says oh my
[8:22] she said
[8:22] yes lord i know that he will rise again
[8:25] in the last day
[8:26] the jews believed the general
[8:28] resurrection sid i know he will rise
[8:30] again in the last day lazarus was a good
[8:32] boy
[8:33] and good god will raise him up again in
[8:36] the last day
[8:37] he says but i can see jesus say but i
[8:40] am the resurrection and the life
[8:44] i am not i will be
[8:47] not i was but i present things
[8:50] am the resurrection the life he that
[8:53] believeth on me
[8:55] shall never die and then he spoke these
[8:57] words and said
[8:58] and when he thus spoken he cried out
[9:01] with a light voice saying lazarus
[9:04] come forth the same he did with all of
[9:07] us when he called us
[9:09] because we were in a tomb and he said
[9:12] brother
[9:13] come forth brother ben come forth
[9:17] and he and he woke us up out of that
[9:19] sleep which was our first birth
[9:22] amen and this is why easter is such a
[9:24] wonderful occasion

[14:53] sins are gone all gone
[14:59] and the devil he departs send him
[15:02] amen my sins are gone
[15:05] where are they there underneath the
[15:08] blood
[15:09] of the cross of calvary
[15:17] [Music]

[15:34] in the name of jesus christ amen
[15:37] you got me into trouble but
[15:40] jesus came out oh lord thank you
[15:45] my sins are gone and they're
[15:48] underneath the blood of the cross of
[15:51] calvary
[15:58] it's in the sea of god's forgetfulness
[16:01] it's good enough for me and
[16:04] all my sins now let's look for jesus
[16:08] every day living now for jesus
[16:11] i'm happy night and day because
[16:16] my sins are gone my
[16:19] soul is filled with music with all my
[16:22] heart i say
[16:24] amen i know my sins are gone
[16:48] without the musicians there underneath
[16:51] the block
[16:52] on the cross of calvary as
[16:56] far as moved as darkness is from dawn
[17:00] it's in the sea of god's forgetfulness
[17:03] that's good
[17:04] enough for me praise god
[17:08] my sins are gone hallelujah
[17:12] amen who listened to the message of this
[17:16] week
[17:17] what did he say he says there's only one
[17:20] person that can forget
[17:21] and that's god because only he has
[17:24] access
[17:25] to that sea of forgetfulness and he can
[17:27] put all your sins there so
[17:29] so when the devil comes to you and he
[17:30] says but wait there's more you go this
[17:33] no more
[17:34] there's no more because though he can
[17:36] accuse and he can remember and he can
[17:37] remind you
[17:39] only god knows where those sins are gone
[17:42] no matter what the devil says to you
[17:44] once you've repented
[17:45] once it's left once you've put it down
[17:47] he has no right
[17:49] to go get it out of the blood that's why
[17:52] we had to go through this time
[17:53] so that we have the blood and can go
[17:55] back to satan and say hey
[17:57] but it's underneath the blood of the
[18:00] king of kings
[18:01] hallelujah amen so let's slow it a bit
[18:05] down because it is a wednesday
[18:07] we're going to worship our lord with
[18:09] everything that we have
[18:11] because he is worthy of all our praise
[18:14] amen i get real happy when i think about
[18:17] him he just makes me happy no
[18:18] though you might be in a trial and
[18:20] situations might be tough
[18:22] you're still happy okay face might not
[18:26] overshow it
[18:27] but the soul says i am happy amen
[18:30] amen so if you want to sing with close
[18:34] your eyes when we worship try to make it
[18:36] so personal between you and god
[18:38] sing this song not for the congregation
[18:40] but hear the words
[18:42] sing the words because that is between
[18:44] you and your savior
[18:46] he did die for all of us but he died for
[18:49] you
[18:50] and if you could accept that and you can
[18:52] make it a part of your life your
[18:54] relationship with him will change so
[18:56] much
[18:56] that every song you sing you can see the
[18:59] words
[19:00] you can feel the words and as you walk
[19:02] you see it live out in front of you
[19:04] that is a personal god that's who he is
[19:08] amen so forget about everyone now let's
[19:10] just see

[41:55] fellowship one with another

[42:23] know that picture my little sunday
[42:26] school teachers
[42:27] i mean sunday school uh eagles do you
[42:29] know that picture
[42:30] that picture is the picture of the
[42:33] tabernacle of moses
[42:35] the tabernacle of moses you know we've
[42:37] got shakarna tabernacle
[42:39] and we've got the tabernacle of moses is
[42:42] that one
[42:43] right chicana tavern ago is this one
[42:47] right we've got brother whatever knuckle
[42:49] is this one
[42:51] ah this is my tabernacle brother ben
[42:54] stephen
[42:54] that is his tabernacle sister analyst
[42:57] that's analysis
[42:58] tabernacle and that one is the
[42:59] tabernacle of moses
[43:01] just as much as we have got to have
[43:02] shakina tavern as a bodhi
[43:04] amen shakkaina tribal not this building
[43:07] us as a body
[43:11] so let's let's look at that one not much
[43:13] to talk about it but it's a symbol
[43:15] as a symbol that i want to refer you
[43:17] somewhere let's just look at it
[43:19] we can see that is the outer court right
[43:22] this is the outer court of the
[43:24] tabernacle of moses a lot of things that
[43:27] that are put in place there they go
[43:29] the brazen altar the gate is there on
[43:32] the gate there's a there's a there's a
[43:33] barrier you know a veil
[43:35] sort of and then we've got the the the
[43:37] liver there liver
[43:39] we've got everything then we go into the
[43:42] holy place
[43:43] are we together and you've got the altar
[43:46] of incense there
[43:47] you've got the golden lamp stands there
[43:50] everything is arranged in order
[43:52] and then you've got the holy of holies
[43:56] the inside there and this evening that
[43:58] is what we are going to talk about
[44:00] but we are going to speak about from a
[44:02] different perspective
[44:04] if we may how do i go forward right
[44:08] we are going to talk about you from this
[44:10] perspective
[44:11] because as i told you i am a tabernacle
[44:14] you are a tabernacle are we together and
[44:16] this is the tabernacle remember this
[44:18] tabernacle
[44:19] had three areas one
[44:23] two three right
[44:26] and this tabernacle also have got one
[44:29] sorry have got one two
[44:33] three we all know that are we together i
[44:36] just want to
[44:37] the purpose of the teaching of the
[44:39] preachings every wednesday and every
[44:40] sunday is not to
[44:41] teach you what you don't know is to
[44:43] remind you
[44:44] is to refresh you is to encourage you is
[44:47] to confirm
[44:48] that hey you are a son of god and you
[44:51] are made in the image of
[44:53] god that's the purpose of coming here
[44:55] that is why
[44:56] you need to make sure that when the lord
[44:59] is dishing
[45:00] i've never seen a child who when the
[45:02] mother dishes
[45:03] they say no no no me give me a little
[45:05] i've never seen a child like that
[45:07] every child want to get the maximum
[45:10] production from mama's dish
[45:13] unless mommy does not cook nice but
[45:15] everyone
[45:16] everyone wants to get the best full
[45:19] plate
[45:19] and that's what me and you are supposed
[45:21] to do tonight to
[45:23] to pull from the lord put the minister
[45:26] put the brother aside listen to the word
[45:28] of god
[45:29] pull from the lord let the lord speak
[45:31] things that brother
[45:32] never thought about you can pull where
[45:35] are you going to pull from
[45:36] inside that's where you're going to be
[45:38] pulling from
[45:39] right because jesus christ is the center
[45:42] of this tabernacle he is the one right
[45:46] so that's that's what i want us to look
[45:47] at it from that perspective this inside
[45:50] fellowship because there are many
[45:53] fellowships
[45:54] even the fellowship of the holy spirit
[45:56] can take place
[45:57] here in the in the middle court the holy
[46:00] spirit can anoint you the prophecies
[46:02] in that court there and you do wonderful
[46:05] things you become a wonderful person
[46:07] but that's not what we need what we want
[46:09] tonight
[46:10] is the holy ghost anointing there that's
[46:13] what we want isn't it
[46:15] people can go and do things the holy
[46:17] ghost can anoint them
[46:19] but where is the holy ghost unwinding
[46:21] them i'm running ahead of myself
[46:23] this pastor's computer is
[46:26] again i must put it on sorry i i need to
[46:30] keep on
[46:30] touching it oh there
[46:34] it's coming right
[46:37] so i've just tried to draw it over there
[46:41] again
[46:42] for you to see
[46:47] forgive me amen right so now
[46:51] i've put the same picture again just to
[46:54] to bring this one
[46:56] and this one together right to say that
[46:59] is the holy of holies
[47:01] that's where the altar is that's where
[47:03] moses road was put
[47:05] that's where the mana golden pot of
[47:07] manna was put
[47:09] are we together because and that's where
[47:12] the outer court is
[47:13] and that's the flesh so i want us to go
[47:16] into fellowship inside inside fellowship
[47:18] with that in mind i want us to go with
[47:21] that in mind there's not much
[47:22] presentation that's all the slides i
[47:24] have this evening
[47:25] the rest of it i'll be talking from here
[47:27] and then you pulling me pushing
[47:30] amen
[47:31] [Laughter]
[47:34] now and we need to understand
[47:38] that usually the things that are outside
[47:41] they don't really last the things that
[47:44] happen outside they don't last
[47:46] they can happen they can be successful
[47:48] but they don't really last
[47:49] they don't really get successful the way
[47:51] you want but the things that happen
[47:53] inside
[47:54] they really become good even as a thief
[47:57] for them for a thief to steal
[47:59] properly there must be an inside job
[48:02] you know an inside job
[48:05] we have never been exposed to to thieves
[48:08] brother cuban will tell you and other
[48:09] people who lived in south africa
[48:11] where a big cash processing company
[48:16] will people will come and steal millions
[48:19] with high security security of more than
[48:22] three levels more than even the way we
[48:24] me and you are built
[48:25] ten levels now i've used to a guinea
[48:27] company where sorry wife
[48:29] she used to work in a company where you
[48:31] know there's two buildings one building
[48:33] and another one on top of that one
[48:35] to protect what cash the money
[48:38] right so how come the thieves can steal
[48:42] so much money from such high security
[48:45] because of an inside
[48:46] job things that happen from inside
[48:50] they succeed things that happen from
[48:52] inside they normally
[48:53] succeed better than the things that
[48:55] happen from the outside
[48:57] when you do things from outside you
[48:58] don't know the corners and you get
[49:00] arrested
[49:01] when you do things from outside the holy
[49:04] ghost anoints you
[49:05] you become so anointed speak in tongues
[49:08] and do everything
[49:09] come monday you are flat again you're
[49:11] back to square one why
[49:13] because there's no inside job the inside
[49:16] fellowship is what we need to talk about
[49:18] are we together
[49:19] so the prophet says love produces
[49:21] fellowship you know
[49:23] love produces fellowship who agrees with
[49:26] me
[49:26] and you will because why i'm saying that
[49:29] if
[49:29] god is if god is love and god wanted to
[49:32] have a fellowship with
[49:33] us right his love produces fellowship of
[49:37] adam and eve
[49:38] for him at the garden he wanted to
[49:41] fellowship with them
[49:42] that is why god wanted what god wanted
[49:44] to do
[49:45] and that's what god wants to do today
[49:48] between me
[49:49] and you he does not want the fellowship
[49:51] of the outside
[49:52] he wants the fellowship in because the
[49:54] fellowship inside it lasts
[49:56] it stays permanently and eternally amen
[49:59] so fellowship in jesus christ and the
[50:03] is the only place where the rich and the
[50:05] poor
[50:06] where the young and the older where the
[50:08] middle class and the top and the lower
[50:10] lower class
[50:11] can fellowship they have tried
[50:13] fellowships they have tried them with
[50:15] education
[50:16] they've tried them with money they've
[50:18] tied them with golf
[50:19] they've tied them with sports you can
[50:20] name it but those fellowships don't last
[50:24] why because the only true fellowship
[50:27] is the fellowship with jesus christ and
[50:30] happening
[50:31] not only in jesus christ but inside your
[50:34] heart
[50:35] amen in the in the holy of holies amen
[50:38] that's what happens
[50:39] amen fellowship with god can only happen
[50:41] in his weight
[50:43] now the lord made the heavens and the
[50:45] earth
[50:46] he created it by his weight and he
[50:48] formed adam he did everything
[50:50] and every evening the bible says he was
[50:53] coming in the cool of the evening to
[50:54] talk to them
[50:55] to fellowship with them because they
[50:57] were feeding from his word
[50:59] they were depending on what he said
[51:02] every day
[51:03] that is why the angels this day they
[51:05] worship god they say holy
[51:07] holy the one wait just one
[51:10] word brothers and sisters it's enough
[51:13] for you to live eternally
[51:15] fellowshipping on one word from god
[51:17] every day
[51:18] every night there won't even be day and
[51:20] night because eternally
[51:22] means there's no day and night you are
[51:24] just living eternally one way
[51:25] from god so god wanted that fellowship
[51:28] so now
[51:29] when he came in the evening to
[51:30] fellowship with them
[51:32] and to talk to them and they depend on
[51:34] him there was a problem
[51:36] one day that fellowship was broken it
[51:39] was broken
[51:40] right and after it was broken now god
[51:43] wanted to restore that fellowship
[51:45] are we together he wanted to restore
[51:47] that divine perfect fellowship
[51:49] amen so god introduced the blood
[51:53] arrangement god introduced what the
[51:56] black arrangement
[51:57] immediately god slaughtered a lamb
[52:01] and he put clothes for them there was a
[52:03] lamb that died
[52:04] god introduced blood because there is no
[52:07] any other fellowship
[52:08] in the true word of god without the
[52:10] blood amen
[52:12] so the true fellowship in the word of
[52:14] god must happen through
[52:15] the blood and a god introduced the blood
[52:18] i don't want to go fast i want
[52:19] the little ones to catch me also and to
[52:22] try to be as simple as possible
[52:24] and so that they can understand me
[52:27] in the time of job job and the prophet
[52:31] taught us that
[52:32] job was the first it was the oldest book
[52:35] it was even written before
[52:37] genesis i mean so job was was aware of
[52:40] what can happen
[52:42] and he was praying and sacrificing
[52:44] slaughtering animals there was blood
[52:46] there
[52:46] so that adventure or or or his children
[52:49] have sinned before god
[52:50] blood can be an atonement are we
[52:52] together and the same thing we find that
[52:54] it happened during the time of moses
[52:56] throughout the time of moses blood was
[52:59] introduced
[53:00] that's why even that tabernacle of moses
[53:02] came where
[53:03] everything will be made and there will
[53:04] be the waters of separation
[53:06] amen that will be sprangled amen and
[53:08] then so that when you when a sinner come
[53:10] he can be clean to stand on the blood
[53:13] atonement
[53:14] for him to be clean and washed are we
[53:16] together
[53:17] now when the thing is that with this
[53:19] fellowship
[53:20] is that aaron the high priest when he
[53:22] goes inside there
[53:24] the holy of holies you know you know
[53:26] that they were given manner right
[53:28] the way okay let me not go there i'll
[53:30] come back but i wanted to tell you that
[53:32] blood was the theme
[53:34] around the fellowship there is no
[53:36] salvation
[53:37] without the blood and that blood is
[53:40] of the weight the blood of the word
[53:42] jesus christ amen who was
[53:44] crucified can you see that from the
[53:46] beginning all the way until today
[53:49] blood is features is the main thing even
[53:51] the bible i'll read for you
[53:53] let's read let's read one
[53:57] just to show you let's read uh
[54:01] where did i lose that scripture but i
[54:04] think it's first john also
[54:06] chapter five if i'm not mistaken i just
[54:08] forgot the verse
[54:10] it says there's only three witnesses who
[54:13] knows the scripture who is my bible
[54:14] reader
[54:18] amen john 5 6 amen
[54:21] it says thank you thank you thank you my
[54:23] brother he says
[54:27] this is he that sorry why am i reading
[54:30] first john
[54:31] chapter five this is he that came by
[54:34] water and blood and even jesus christ
[54:36] not by water only
[54:38] but by water and blood and it is in
[54:41] the spirit that beareth witnesses
[54:44] because the spirit is true
[54:46] verse seven for there are three that
[54:48] bear record in heaven three
[54:51] father and the word and the holy
[54:54] ghost and these three are one and
[54:57] there are three that bear witness in
[54:59] earth the spirit
[55:00] and the water and the blood so blood is
[55:03] very important
[55:05] towards our tournament and there's no
[55:07] fellowship
[55:08] outside of what is happening what has
[55:11] happened
[55:12] on friday 2000 years ago there was
[55:14] nothing like that
[55:15] there was no way in which we were going
[55:17] to come and be saved
[55:19] heard the lamb of god not died who is
[55:22] excited for easter
[55:24] amen so the prophet says here there's
[55:26] only one place of genuine fellowship
[55:28] and that's under the shed blood of the
[55:31] innocent
[55:33] the innocent jesus christ even that lamb
[55:35] remember that lamb
[55:36] that that was brought a sinner will
[55:38] bring that lamp
[55:40] and the bible says it must be a red
[55:41] heifer sorry not the red heifer
[55:43] the the lamb that was going to be
[55:46] slaughtered or
[55:47] sacrificed on your behalf you are
[55:49] supposed to check it it was supposed to
[55:50] be
[55:51] innocent clean the moment the people who
[55:54] check
[55:54] at the gate find something you must take
[55:57] it back and bring a clean one
[55:59] because it must come sinless and that's
[56:01] how jesus christ
[56:02] came but that sinless lamb come to die
[56:05] for who for me and for you that is what
[56:08] was happening
[56:09] at the beginning so there's no way in
[56:11] which and
[56:12] a lamb that is not innocent will come
[56:15] and
[56:16] die and be sacrificed for me and for you
[56:18] no no otherwise there will be no perfect
[56:20] divine fellowship amen the only place
[56:24] i'm reading now what i've read earlier
[56:26] on about the blood of the innocent was
[56:28] from fellowship 6205.90
[56:30] the only place the only place common
[56:33] ground that god made with the people
[56:35] was the tabernacle under the shed blood
[56:37] this is now hidden alive
[56:38] with christ 560213 amen
[56:42] let's read let's read let's read romans
[56:44] romans chapter six
[56:46] brother caleb this is the last scripture
[56:49] i believe
[56:50] from there we are just going to be uh
[56:54] romans chapter six we're reading that
[56:56] one
[56:57] once we finish reading this one we are
[56:59] now we'll just be cruising
[57:01] brother kelly see we're just taking off
[57:04] now
[57:04] and now the air has settled we'll just
[57:06] be cruising
[57:08] i don't know at what altitude but we'll
[57:09] be cruising amen
[57:12] what shall we say then shall we continue
[57:15] in sin
[57:16] that grace may abound that's the
[57:19] question that paul is asking the romans
[57:21] as paul is asking these romans today
[57:23] these christians paul is asking what
[57:25] shall we
[57:26] say because we say we have not come by
[57:28] the law we have come by grace
[57:30] shall now we continue in sin because
[57:34] grace may abound because there is grace
[57:37] and there is mercy from god let me just
[57:39] sin
[57:40] willfully because there's too much grace
[57:43] the lord will forgive me
[57:45] let me sin my parents will forgive me my
[57:48] father is full of mercy
[57:50] my father said i must forgive so many
[57:52] times so
[57:53] i must wrong you brother ben because the
[57:55] bible says you must forgive me
[57:56] that's the wrong attitude that's not the
[57:59] way to do it no no
[58:00] the answer to paul is no we must not sin
[58:04] because grace abound but indeed grace
[58:06] about but we cannot just sin
[58:08] because there is enough grace to forgive
[58:10] us that's the answer to
[58:12] that's how i will answer him today if he
[58:14] was going to ask me brother
[58:15] paul must we just continue to sin
[58:19] because there's enough grace should we
[58:21] just continue to hate your brother
[58:22] and to sin willfully because grace
[58:24] abounds just so that you can come and
[58:26] say i'm sorry
[58:28] no that's the wrong attitude that's the
[58:30] one that the prophet was not referring
[58:32] to when he said
[58:33] the right attitude will bring every
[58:35] promise of god to pass that's not the
[58:37] attitude
[58:37] the right attitude is a no lord i don't
[58:40] want to wrong my brother
[58:41] help me so that i cannot willfully sin
[58:44] against you
[58:45] that's where grace abounds that's where
[58:48] grace abounds
[58:49] amen verse two god forbid
[58:53] i cannot edit in the bible but i think
[58:54] paul they would paul maybe would have
[58:56] wanted to say
[58:57] i'm not editing i'm just saying no god
[59:00] forbid
[59:01] no how shall we that are dead to sin
[59:04] live any longer there in it is because
[59:07] we are not
[59:08] i'm no longer a slave to fear i'm no
[59:11] longer a slave to sin
[59:13] i ca it's not possible for me to sin
[59:16] willfully
[59:17] that's the answer there so
[59:20] god forbid how shall we that are dead
[59:24] in sin live any longer there in
[59:28] that means a believer cannot sin a
[59:30] believer
[59:31] cannot purposefully do something
[59:34] against the word of god that's a
[59:36] believer that's a believer who has found
[59:38] a true
[59:39] divine perfect inside fellowship with
[59:41] the lord amen
[59:42] no he knows that so many of us are
[59:46] so many of us as we are baptized into
[59:48] jesus christ
[59:50] where baptized into his death this is my
[59:52] favorite
[59:53] my one of my favorite chapters i can
[59:55] read it the whole month
[59:57] we were baptized into his death
[1:00:00] you see when we got baptized children be
[1:00:03] attentive now this is a sunday school
[1:00:05] lesson
[1:00:06] all of you who were baptized you were
[1:00:08] baptized into the death of jesus christ
[1:00:11] meaning that when jesus christ died huh
[1:00:14] and you today you get baptized you are
[1:00:17] baptized into the
[1:00:18] death of jesus christ you are like you
[1:00:21] are dying
[1:00:23] and when we raise you out of the water
[1:00:25] you rise being a new man or a new woman
[1:00:29] not the water is it's not the water that
[1:00:31] is saving you
[1:00:32] no it's the action that is happening in
[1:00:34] them that when you raise
[1:00:36] them out you rise up a new man because
[1:00:39] when he raised
[1:00:40] he raised a new man jesus christ let's
[1:00:42] read further
[1:00:44] therefore we are buried with him
[1:00:47] by baptism into death
[1:00:50] i like the way he puts the scriptures
[1:00:52] where paul puts it he says
[1:00:54] therefore we are buried with him by
[1:00:56] baptism into death
[1:00:58] that is very clear i mean this does not
[1:01:00] need a degree in psychology
[1:01:02] we are buried with him into baptism
[1:01:07] by into death that's what paul says like
[1:01:10] as christ was raised up from the dead
[1:01:12] by the glory of the father even so we
[1:01:15] also should walk in newness
[1:01:18] of life i am working in the newness of
[1:01:22] life
[1:01:23] i'm no longer a slave don't you sing
[1:01:26] that song
[1:01:27] so we we we are now coming in the
[1:01:30] newness of life
[1:01:31] the things that we used to do we do them
[1:01:34] no more
[1:01:35] are we together i want us to read up to
[1:01:37] verse
[1:01:39] six there's something that i want to
[1:01:40] show you knowing that verse six
[1:01:43] sorry verse five for if we have been
[1:01:45] planted together in the likeness of
[1:01:47] death we shall also
[1:01:48] shall be also in the likeness of his
[1:01:50] resurrection you see
[1:01:52] the same way that christ died the same
[1:01:54] way that christ got buried
[1:01:56] the same way that christ rose we also
[1:01:59] come
[1:01:59] like that same process why
[1:02:02] why are you coming through that process
[1:02:04] because you are part of christ
[1:02:07] in the actual fact when christ died at
[1:02:09] the cross you were there
[1:02:11] that is why all you are doing now you
[1:02:13] are just repeating what has happened on
[1:02:15] the physical
[1:02:16] that you were there with him you died
[1:02:19] with him you were buried with him
[1:02:21] you rose with him are we together so
[1:02:23] today you're just confirming
[1:02:25] you're just in english they say it's
[1:02:27] just a verification process
[1:02:30] of what happened 2000 years ago you are
[1:02:32] just verifying
[1:02:33] that oh no i was there that is why i can
[1:02:36] do
[1:02:36] and and come up with a newness of life
[1:02:39] because i was
[1:02:40] there so calvary what is happening on
[1:02:43] friday what we are celebrating
[1:02:45] what we are making a lot of noise about
[1:02:48] is what we went through with him amen
[1:02:52] now for he that is dead is freed from
[1:02:54] sin did i jump the verse
[1:02:58] that's six yes i did knowing this that
[1:03:01] our old man is crucified with him that
[1:03:04] the body of sin might be destroyed
[1:03:06] that henceforth we should not serve sin
[1:03:09] clear right for he that is dead is freed
[1:03:12] from
[1:03:13] sin now if we be dead with christ
[1:03:16] if we be dead in christ which we are
[1:03:19] we believe that we shall also live with
[1:03:22] him
[1:03:23] what is this thing of living with christ
[1:03:25] what is it
[1:03:27] what is this thing of living with christ
[1:03:29] we are daily on a daily basis
[1:03:32] living with christ fellowshipping
[1:03:35] in him every day the big part of our
[1:03:38] lives
[1:03:39] involves talking to him it involves us
[1:03:42] we associate everything
[1:03:44] about our life to him because us and him
[1:03:46] are one
[1:03:47] we are no more two we are one so
[1:03:50] everything have you ever seen a woman or
[1:03:52] who does not think of her husband huh
[1:03:55] even during the day
[1:03:56] when the poor man is at work hello i was
[1:03:58] just checking on you
[1:04:00] because she is thinking about him
[1:04:02] everything about her life is about
[1:04:04] him amen and when he's there he's also
[1:04:07] thinking about
[1:04:08] hey that is what i'm talking about that
[1:04:11] is the fellowship
[1:04:12] those two are no more two but they are
[1:04:15] one
[1:04:15] christ and us are one that is what here
[1:04:18] the paul is trying to say
[1:04:20] how if we be dead with christ we believe
[1:04:22] that we shall also live with him
[1:04:24] we live with him our life our our our
[1:04:27] doings our everything
[1:04:28] is with him we act like him we talk like
[1:04:32] him
[1:04:32] we we sleep like him you know and to a
[1:04:35] point where you
[1:04:36] you you know you know those that are
[1:04:38] long married they'll tell you
[1:04:40] that when they look at their wife they
[1:04:41] even think they look like them
[1:04:43] their wives
[1:04:45] [Laughter]
[1:04:48] hey man brother andy you when you only
[1:04:51] get your wife
[1:04:51] you think ah it's like i was with her
[1:04:53] before before i go it's like there was
[1:04:55] you were together somewhere
[1:04:57] me i don't know about you brothers but
[1:04:58] it happens to me when i look at my wife
[1:05:00] i think it's like i lived with her
[1:05:02] sometimes some
[1:05:03] somewhere before i knew her no it's not
[1:05:06] it is because he is part of me
[1:05:08] amen it's because me and her are one
[1:05:12] there's no more twin there are one and
[1:05:14] that is what what is happening between
[1:05:16] you
[1:05:16] and christ between you and christ that's
[1:05:19] what the fellowship i'm talking about
[1:05:21] and that is why uh in this
[1:05:24] picture that i showed you that in the
[1:05:26] inner the holy of holies the inner
[1:05:28] chamber
[1:05:30] some call it the king's chamber
[1:05:33] that is inside where things are
[1:05:34] happening that is
[1:05:36] where the bride and the bridegroom are
[1:05:39] isn't it inside because things don't
[1:05:41] happen outside
[1:05:43] many of the of the things that we do
[1:05:45] that we act
[1:05:47] started inside job
[1:05:51] an inside job until god said brother
[1:05:55] branham
[1:05:56] tell them that their thoughts are louder
[1:06:00] in heaven than their ways because
[1:06:02] something that happens inside
[1:06:04] is more powerful out of the heart the
[1:06:07] mouth speakers
[1:06:08] the heart is deceitful the bible says so
[1:06:10] it is the heart it is what is happening
[1:06:12] in the heart that matters in actual
[1:06:15] thing not what happens outside
[1:06:17] i can smile with you but if i'm not
[1:06:19] smiling from inside
[1:06:20] no effect i can say amen from outside
[1:06:24] i'm not saying don't say amen but it
[1:06:26] must come from their
[1:06:27] heart i can jump i can preach
[1:06:30] i can hear and pray for the people they
[1:06:33] get healed
[1:06:34] but if that is not happening from the
[1:06:36] inner chamber
[1:06:38] what does it benefit me that's the
[1:06:40] challenge
[1:06:41] for me and for you right that is the
[1:06:44] reality that we are talking about it
[1:06:46] must happen
[1:06:46] from the inside the where the fellowship
[1:06:49] takes place
[1:06:50] at the headquarters in the that is where
[1:06:52] the decisions get made
[1:06:54] amen that is what is happening so we
[1:06:57] read that romans let me leave it but
[1:06:59] i'll read i'll leave
[1:07:00] it with verse 15 and 16. what then shall
[1:07:02] we sin
[1:07:03] because we are not under the law no no
[1:07:05] no we can't do that
[1:07:07] but under grace god forbid no he not
[1:07:10] that to whom he yield yourself settles
[1:07:13] to obey
[1:07:14] his servants he are to whom he obey
[1:07:18] did you hear that let me repeat it for
[1:07:21] you
[1:07:22] now he note that to whom he yield
[1:07:24] yourself
[1:07:25] servants to obey you understand it up to
[1:07:29] there
[1:07:30] his servants you are
[1:07:33] everything that you do and you obey and
[1:07:35] you you give your everything
[1:07:37] you are the servant of that thing that's
[1:07:40] what the bible says in simple terms
[1:07:42] amen whom you obey whether
[1:07:45] of sin and unto death or
[1:07:48] of obedience unto righteousness so
[1:07:52] in zulu they say musketeer you choose
[1:07:55] for yourself
[1:07:57] amen but you have already chosen now the
[1:08:00] prophet says here in the message
[1:08:02] the way to have fellowship now this is
[1:08:05] this will
[1:08:05] be short we can talk to you just short
[1:08:08] on this
[1:08:09] but how that every person desires to
[1:08:12] fellowship
[1:08:12] amen every person deserves a fellowship
[1:08:15] i've never
[1:08:16] heard about someone that they say ah
[1:08:18] this one does not want to fellowship
[1:08:20] even that one who wants to be a loner he
[1:08:22] will walk there and go
[1:08:24] in the bush and talk to the insects he's
[1:08:26] fellowshipping
[1:08:28] because a human being was made to
[1:08:30] fellowship a human being there's no way
[1:08:33] a human being can fellowship if you are
[1:08:35] alone you're probably fellowshipping
[1:08:36] with the lord and that's what me and you
[1:08:38] must do
[1:08:39] we must find time to fellowship with the
[1:08:42] lord two of us
[1:08:43] amen now i have never seen anyone
[1:08:46] yet who did not desire fellowship no
[1:08:49] i've never that's what the prophet says
[1:08:50] here you see in red that's what he says
[1:08:54] so that he didn't put it there but it's
[1:08:55] in that same one the way of it oh
[1:08:57] the way to have fellowship but that is
[1:09:00] what
[1:09:01] that is was it's all right mentally
[1:09:03] balanced now
[1:09:04] you might you might want to pick your
[1:09:07] fellowship course
[1:09:08] that's true for every one of us that's
[1:09:10] the reason tonight that all these fine
[1:09:12] people have packed
[1:09:14] out here in this building you amen to a
[1:09:17] place where they are standing
[1:09:19] is because that they like this type of
[1:09:22] fellowship
[1:09:22] they like christian fellowship and
[1:09:24] that's why we come tonight the prophet
[1:09:26] says to fellowship around the world
[1:09:29] that's why we are here amen we didn't
[1:09:32] come here
[1:09:32] to see bradampo oh he makes me laugh
[1:09:35] let's go
[1:09:36] in here no we didn't come for that oh no
[1:09:38] when he preaches i don't sleep
[1:09:40] no we didn't come here for that it's not
[1:09:43] even about him
[1:09:44] he's not even a point zero zero zero
[1:09:46] zero nine
[1:09:49] or the preacher or any minister and the
[1:09:51] past it is the lord
[1:09:52] you've come to fellowship with the lord
[1:09:54] that when you come here
[1:09:55] you go back home you've got something
[1:09:57] that the lord has given you
[1:09:59] something has renewed you something has
[1:10:01] refreshed you
[1:10:02] something has given you the new orders
[1:10:04] when you go to the front line
[1:10:06] you're going afresh you're going with
[1:10:08] your ak-47
[1:10:09] ready to shoot the devil because the
[1:10:12] devil must know where he belongs
[1:10:14] not tomorrow no no no no today
[1:10:18] the devil needs to know that you are a
[1:10:20] son of god and he is a devil
[1:10:23] we need statement here that the prophet
[1:10:24] said previously we said let's allow god
[1:10:27] to be
[1:10:27] god it this on the same note let's allow
[1:10:31] the data to be the devil
[1:10:33] let's not make the devil go please the
[1:10:35] developers may be upset
[1:10:37] that you can't pray every day no
[1:10:41] think about you brothers that you can't
[1:10:43] pray every day
[1:10:45] you must be upset about that type of an
[1:10:47] arrangement that you can't read your
[1:10:48] bible
[1:10:49] every single day even if the prophet has
[1:10:51] told you
[1:10:52] that for you to keep in the fellowship
[1:10:55] you must read your bible
[1:10:57] every day and pray every day a believer
[1:11:01] who finished the whole week brother
[1:11:02] michael the whole week not you my boy
[1:11:04] the whole week
[1:11:06] not all of you we don't do it i'm
[1:11:08] preaching to the converted
[1:11:09] we are just refreshing one another
[1:11:11] reminding one another that hey
[1:11:13] be careful if that trend starts to
[1:11:15] emerge the trend of not reading the
[1:11:17] weight
[1:11:18] the whole week who's your husband
[1:11:21] that's it the whole way you never
[1:11:25] thought about him
[1:11:26] and send him a text and say lord i'm
[1:11:27] thinking of you my dear
[1:11:29] the whole week a week is even long
[1:11:33] we need to be constantly in the presence
[1:11:36] of the lord
[1:11:38] even there at work when someone talks to
[1:11:40] you wrong you say lord help me look
[1:11:42] brother armand was saying
[1:11:43] forgive them they don't know what they
[1:11:44] are doing and you mean it because if
[1:11:46] they knew
[1:11:47] they would do it differently give me
[1:11:49] patience lord
[1:11:50] give me the strength to to start one day
[1:11:52] these people can see that this is a true
[1:11:54] believer
[1:11:54] that they can see you in that they can
[1:11:56] see that i have a special husband
[1:11:59] then one day they'll come to me and say
[1:12:01] who is your husband
[1:12:02] and i'll tell them amen amen
[1:12:06] amen he says here the prophet
[1:12:10] uh i'm gonna shock you now can i show
[1:12:13] you
[1:12:13] yes are you ready
[1:12:17] he said the prophet i would rather the
[1:12:21] heavy church
[1:12:22] listen just a moment i'll rather have a
[1:12:24] church that knows nothing about any
[1:12:27] spiritual gift
[1:12:28] and just being so in love with each
[1:12:30] other and with christ
[1:12:32] i'd rather have that that that
[1:12:36] sorry i would rather have that than
[1:12:38] every spiritual
[1:12:40] gift operating in the church wow
[1:12:44] this is powerful eh that means
[1:12:47] fellowship is powerful
[1:12:48] more powerful than gifts that the
[1:12:51] prophet says he rather
[1:12:52] have a church that so much love each
[1:12:56] other
[1:12:57] i'm not talking about faith sorry for
[1:12:59] that reading
[1:13:00] i'm talking about true love for one
[1:13:02] another the love where you forgive your
[1:13:04] brother before he even ask you
[1:13:06] the love where you truly love him or
[1:13:09] your sister
[1:13:10] that even when you are alone before god
[1:13:12] you pray and cry for him
[1:13:14] that's the love i'm talking about not
[1:13:16] the love that says all together okay
[1:13:18] i'll pray for brother ben
[1:13:19] everybody's listening no no no that is
[1:13:21] good but when you are alone
[1:13:24] before the lord in your closet praying
[1:13:27] and
[1:13:27] crying for me that oh lord help her but
[1:13:30] i love him so much i want to be with him
[1:13:32] in in heaven help sister sister davey um
[1:13:36] i forgot your name sister debbie
[1:13:41] help sister debbie health analyst i pray
[1:13:44] for them
[1:13:44] enter into their needs talk to god about
[1:13:48] them
[1:13:48] because we sing a song here that they
[1:13:50] can talk about me
[1:13:51] but i'll talk about them on mine that's
[1:13:54] what we sing isn't it
[1:13:55] so let's practice what we preach that we
[1:13:58] we love each other so much
[1:14:00] that that the devil finds no ground to
[1:14:02] stand
[1:14:03] he just found that he's fighting a
[1:14:05] losing battle that's the kind of
[1:14:07] fellowship that i'm talking about
[1:14:09] amen now that might sound
[1:14:13] hard in a pentecostal group but i'd
[1:14:15] rather have it that church she's talking
[1:14:17] about i'd rather have that church
[1:14:19] where there's his gifts they they fail
[1:14:22] the kids they fail
[1:14:24] why are these gifts they'll bring
[1:14:25] confusion
[1:14:27] i'm not discouraging the gifts i'm just
[1:14:29] trying to show you what the prophet is
[1:14:30] trying to illustrate him
[1:14:31] that he says he'll rather have the love
[1:14:34] of god in
[1:14:35] fellowship around the word of god than
[1:14:37] to have all the gifts
[1:14:39] that can turn this building around
[1:14:41] upside down hey man that can lift up
[1:14:43] this pulpit on the air
[1:14:45] those gifts are there and it's the holy
[1:14:47] spirit using them
[1:14:48] but what if they happen around in this
[1:14:51] in the in the middle
[1:14:52] chamber not in the inner chamber
[1:14:55] will it help us they shall cease
[1:14:58] one day they'll stop one day the enemy
[1:15:01] can fake them
[1:15:03] we know that but when we have that true
[1:15:06] genuine love
[1:15:07] and they happen from that point those
[1:15:10] things
[1:15:11] that's the exact thing that we are after
[1:15:14] are we together
[1:15:15] amen and he says and if you
[1:15:19] have perfect love you had you had
[1:15:22] you will have perfect gifts you see if
[1:15:25] you have
[1:15:26] if you have got perfect love gifts will
[1:15:28] come
[1:15:29] perfect ones so it only starts with the
[1:15:32] gifts
[1:15:33] it only starts with their gifts and
[1:15:34] other things no they are there but you
[1:15:36] start with this perfect love
[1:15:38] of fellowship the perfect one then the
[1:15:41] perfect gives will
[1:15:43] they will follow that brings fellowship
[1:15:46] and
[1:15:46] fellowship brings gifts hallelujah
[1:15:50] amen in the message the way of the
[1:15:52] fellowship now in the beginning man had
[1:15:54] fellowship first we realized
[1:15:56] if we can have fellowship with god then
[1:15:58] don't worry
[1:15:59] god will take care of the rest that's
[1:16:02] what god will do
[1:16:03] the reason we like fellowship is because
[1:16:05] i've already mentioned it's because
[1:16:07] god himself loves fellowship and
[1:16:10] we god himself loves fellowship
[1:16:13] and that's the reason we love fellowship
[1:16:16] who can tell me why
[1:16:18] because you are his offspring that is
[1:16:20] why you are like him
[1:16:22] that is why you love to fellowship with
[1:16:24] god that is why you love to fellowship
[1:16:26] with brothers and sisters
[1:16:27] truly so why because you are a son
[1:16:31] and a daughter of god and if that is not
[1:16:33] happening watch out
[1:16:35] be careful restore your position
[1:16:38] to have a fellowship with the brothers
[1:16:40] and sisters of like precious faith
[1:16:42] amen because that that brings god down
[1:16:46] and that shows that ah this one is a son
[1:16:49] of god
[1:16:50] god being himself he's pleased because
[1:16:52] that's what he wanted
[1:16:53] in the first place in the garden of eden
[1:16:55] somebody must show me the watch
[1:16:57] quarter tonight i'll finish now it is
[1:17:00] because god himself loves fellowship and
[1:17:01] you and me are his offspring isn't it
[1:17:04] have you never had
[1:17:05] where a boy does something they say ah
[1:17:07] he's like his father
[1:17:09] he's doing that because his father did
[1:17:11] this
[1:17:12] it is in his dna we sing a song
[1:17:15] that we are the children of abraham our
[1:17:18] blood
[1:17:19] the royal blood of abraham the royal
[1:17:22] seat that's what we sing
[1:17:23] those songs that we think they must come
[1:17:25] to reality they must come to happen
[1:17:28] we should not just dream them and seeing
[1:17:31] them
[1:17:31] huh they must come from some way
[1:17:33] hallelujah
[1:17:34] while we fellowship with one another is
[1:17:37] grand
[1:17:38] and the grandest and perfect fellowship
[1:17:40] is the one
[1:17:41] man between men and god what i'm saying
[1:17:44] here is that
[1:17:45] it also it is very important to make
[1:17:47] sure that our fellowship
[1:17:48] all the time must bring god on the scene
[1:17:51] we mustn't fellowship more
[1:17:52] about how much money we can make about
[1:17:56] brother tell where do they make them
[1:17:59] and we spend hours talking about
[1:18:02] themselves
[1:18:03] hey brother come and tell me do you
[1:18:04] still have those ties
[1:18:08] yes we must ask our brother to bless us
[1:18:10] again but that's not to be our center
[1:18:12] of fellowship the whole three hours
[1:18:15] talking about suits
[1:18:17] huh oh money no we should bring christ
[1:18:20] down
[1:18:20] because remember he wanted fellowship
[1:18:22] with us from the beginning
[1:18:24] that is how it needs to be this is that
[1:18:26] we should spend more time thinking oh my
[1:18:28] i wonder
[1:18:29] i wonder on that morning how it was have
[1:18:32] you ever said
[1:18:33] and i thought about how it was not
[1:18:35] through the video and movie
[1:18:36] just for you thinking lord i wonder i
[1:18:39] wonder lord what you went through on
[1:18:40] that morning
[1:18:42] he is 10 o'clock now i wonder what was
[1:18:43] happening
[1:18:45] in jerusalem on that morning you are
[1:18:47] thinking about it
[1:18:48] you are saying lord i really personally
[1:18:50] i thank you
[1:18:53] i mean but then think
[1:18:57] he's closer to you than his door his
[1:18:59] door is your heart
[1:19:01] and he's so close tonight he's closer to
[1:19:03] you than
[1:19:04] your right arm is he's part of you
[1:19:07] and if we can only realize that he's
[1:19:09] here and
[1:19:10] how he wants to have fellowship with us
[1:19:13] his heart is greater for fellowship than
[1:19:15] ours
[1:19:17] and the reason he makes us that way
[1:19:18] because we are his offspring
[1:19:21] we are offspring of his that's what
[1:19:24] makes us to long for fellowship
[1:19:26] right i went ahead of myself but that's
[1:19:28] what the prophet says in this message
[1:19:30] amen that's that's what makes the mother
[1:19:33] who will die for her baby why
[1:19:35] that's what makes the father who give
[1:19:38] who will give his life for his wife
[1:19:40] i don't know pastor if there's husbands
[1:19:43] in this church who can
[1:19:44] die for their wives that's what the
[1:19:47] prophet says
[1:19:48] he says i wonder he is even there's even
[1:19:51] a question mark
[1:19:53] here i'm not lying to you that's why
[1:19:56] that's what makes the mother
[1:19:57] will die for her baby why that's what
[1:20:00] makes a father will give his life
[1:20:02] for his wife
[1:20:04] [Music]
[1:20:06] because why there was a husband who died
[1:20:09] for his wife
[1:20:10] and his name is jesus christ
[1:20:14] and the physical types there
[1:20:17] a man so i wonder
[1:20:21] a husband a true husband a husband a
[1:20:24] true husband
[1:20:25] will give his life for his wife die for
[1:20:28] him
[1:20:29] why because christ gave his life for the
[1:20:32] for the church his wife that's what
[1:20:35] that's what the men of god taught us
[1:20:36] i mean the prophet of god the one who of
[1:20:40] revelation 10 7
[1:20:41] who came to reveal everything that's
[1:20:43] what he said amen
[1:20:44] how many believe that i believe it amen
[1:20:48] that's what the prophet says amen now in
[1:20:50] the message
[1:20:51] didn't live with christ we are going to
[1:20:54] read from there but before we read
[1:20:57] faith cometh by hearing the word who
[1:20:59] believes that
[1:21:00] faith comes by here and as we say faith
[1:21:02] or doubt
[1:21:03] we found in the soul in the holy of
[1:21:06] holies that's the place for a believer
[1:21:09] to fellowship with god
[1:21:11] faith gets concretized today it gets
[1:21:14] stabilized
[1:21:16] it gets solidified but it can't move
[1:21:18] anymore
[1:21:19] amen that nothing no demon no chief
[1:21:22] demon
[1:21:23] of a country of any spirit of anything
[1:21:26] will move me and that time you are
[1:21:29] cruising
[1:21:31] that time you are cruising my brother
[1:21:33] i'm not lying to you you are no more
[1:21:34] worried about little demons
[1:21:36] you want big ones you say bring them on
[1:21:39] devil
[1:21:40] because you know that you have lost even
[1:21:42] before you start
[1:21:43] ah that's where we need to get we need
[1:21:45] to get a point of cruising
[1:21:47] a point where our attitude is so high we
[1:21:50] can't even see down there
[1:21:52] we are cruising and the pilot just put
[1:21:54] his feet there on there he's
[1:21:56] just cruising the devil that's not even
[1:21:59] here
[1:22:00] he on can only hear our sound we are
[1:22:02] miles ahead
[1:22:04] he's only hearing the sound of that he
[1:22:06] says where are they we are gone
[1:22:08] ah that's what the devil should the
[1:22:11] devil should not find us and say i've
[1:22:12] got him let me let me shoot him no no no
[1:22:14] no
[1:22:14] when you get there to school and the
[1:22:16] spirits
[1:22:17] are so sick in the school environment
[1:22:20] and you come there
[1:22:21] you know do you know a thing called
[1:22:22] jelly how many knows jelly
[1:22:25] when when is when you just see much you
[1:22:27] stick
[1:22:28] you find scenes like those in schools so
[1:22:31] think that you can go to
[1:22:33] you know and but you can't see them with
[1:22:35] your naked eye
[1:22:36] so thick are the spirits in their
[1:22:38] schools and universities
[1:22:39] and our work environments and this earth
[1:22:41] so stick
[1:22:43] but you are here and you are in the
[1:22:45] spirit how come
[1:22:47] because you are inside fellowship you
[1:22:49] are working with a sword
[1:22:50] you know that sort of the king is so
[1:22:52] sharp
[1:22:53] not even jelly can stand when it cuts
[1:22:56] jelly just go like this it's so sharp
[1:22:59] that jelly and that thought
[1:23:01] is the word of god amen and that word of
[1:23:04] god is christ
[1:23:05] whom me and you are fellowshipping with
[1:23:08] in the inner chamber
[1:23:10] i need to rush and finish tonight i
[1:23:12] don't want to run you to be in your
[1:23:13] in your wrong books i'll finish on time
[1:23:17] now the only place i've already read
[1:23:19] that one but it's in a different message
[1:23:21] maybe it would be nice to repeat it
[1:23:23] because it's in a different message
[1:23:24] called fellowship 650519
[1:23:27] now the only place therefore believing
[1:23:29] his way the only place
[1:23:30] therefore believing his way the only
[1:23:32] place under the shed block
[1:23:34] is the place for fellowship where
[1:23:36] everybody can rally around and
[1:23:38] feel the same
[1:23:41] product a simple man everybody to feel
[1:23:44] the same
[1:23:50] doesn't happen but it happens somewhere
[1:23:53] some other places it happens i observe
[1:23:54] it
[1:23:55] why we don't feel we are not the same
[1:23:58] you know when brother
[1:23:59] comes everybody can see that nobody has
[1:24:01] arrived
[1:24:03] what is that that's the spirit of christ
[1:24:05] when bradampur leaves
[1:24:07] when he goes home or he leaves the
[1:24:09] fellowship
[1:24:10] yeah we can hear that he has left now
[1:24:12] that guy because there's such
[1:24:14] is bringing his own presence not the
[1:24:16] presence of the lord
[1:24:18] when brother phil comes to say i am the
[1:24:20] man of god yeah
[1:24:21] you know no no no we want to be all the
[1:24:23] same amen
[1:24:25] the brother brandon was simple like that
[1:24:27] and he was the first wave chief
[1:24:29] in our age did you hear about the wave
[1:24:31] shift who made how many had about the
[1:24:33] way if she on sunday
[1:24:36] therefore now the only place therefore
[1:24:40] believing his way
[1:24:42] the only place under the shed blood is
[1:24:44] the place for fellowship
[1:24:45] where everybody can rally around and
[1:24:47] they feel the same
[1:24:49] because it's under one place of the
[1:24:52] shared blood
[1:24:54] now to pla to place your faith upon
[1:24:56] anything else besides the word of god
[1:24:58] is sinking sand that's what the prophet
[1:25:01] says here
[1:25:02] amen i'll jump some other things and i
[1:25:04] can share these notes with you you can
[1:25:06] enjoy
[1:25:06] then in there they have seen golden
[1:25:10] candlesticks remember that's the image
[1:25:12] that i've shown you
[1:25:13] of the golden candlesticks in the inner
[1:25:16] in the inner chamber
[1:25:18] in the holy place did you see them seven
[1:25:21] pronged lamp rather but in in the inside
[1:25:25] behind the veil there was an ark
[1:25:28] and in the ark there was the tablets the
[1:25:31] ten commandments
[1:25:33] as we call them amen and and and
[1:25:36] that represented human hearts
[1:25:40] in the holy of holies the ten of
[1:25:42] commandments they were in there
[1:25:44] the prophet says they represent a human
[1:25:45] heart right
[1:25:47] because they were written those ten
[1:25:49] commandments were written
[1:25:50] and they represent your heart that is
[1:25:52] what the bible says i will write my law
[1:25:54] upon there
[1:25:55] upon their hearts that's what the
[1:25:57] prophet says amen
[1:25:58] that god how that
[1:26:02] how god promised in the days gone by
[1:26:04] that in this day that he will write his
[1:26:06] yes
[1:26:06] he will write his laws not upon the
[1:26:08] tables of stone
[1:26:10] but upon the hearts he will place the
[1:26:13] law in the heart
[1:26:14] also ezekiel's product spoke about it
[1:26:16] and i feel that the day
[1:26:18] that we are living that there's a great
[1:26:20] need among
[1:26:21] christian people that they seem to be
[1:26:23] wanting something that they are not
[1:26:25] able to get because we are made to
[1:26:28] fellowship
[1:26:29] so we are always making to strive to
[1:26:31] strive to start to find something that
[1:26:34] we can't seem to get
[1:26:35] no what we need is the fellowship with
[1:26:38] jesus christ
[1:26:39] in the inner chamber that's what we need
[1:26:42] that's what we require tonight
[1:26:43] it depends on you where your faith is
[1:26:46] amen i'm just
[1:26:47] jumping around now sorry if you are not
[1:26:49] following a certain pattern of thought

[1:29:08] i'm telling you we are not excited
[1:29:10] enough when we all get there
[1:29:12] we are going to realize that we have

[1:29:18] daughter
[1:29:19] they will tell you that hey your life
[1:29:21] has just begun
[1:29:23] brother isaac taught to someone one time
[1:29:25] he said you know and i was fantastic
[1:29:27] thinking about that imagining
[1:29:29] things as is busy preaching that oh man
[1:29:31] this is so great
[1:29:32] which means the real real life is not
[1:29:35] this one
[1:29:36] the real life we we we just somehow
[1:29:39] things got mixed up this flesh
[1:29:41] you know like if the lord can tell
[1:29:43] things we are going to understand it
[1:29:44] better by end but
[1:29:45] if the reality when you get them they
[1:29:48] tell you
[1:29:48] that welcome home
[1:29:52] your life has just started so what are
[1:29:55] you doing now
[1:29:56] is this not life no this is not life
[1:30:00] what we're experiencing now is not life
[1:30:02] it's just
[1:30:04] some some negative it's just some
[1:30:06] negative remember i showed you a
[1:30:08] negative here
[1:30:10] the reality is coming the real reality
[1:30:13] we are living one
[1:30:14] shadow amen so the real life when they
[1:30:17] tell you that hey
[1:30:18] welcome home you said
[1:30:22] you don't even want to think about what
[1:30:23] happened all you want to do
[1:30:26] is to live the life in front of you that
[1:30:28] time and they tell you that this is the
[1:30:30] place that the lord prepared for you
[1:30:32] he said my lord i never thought it would
[1:30:33] be like this and you say
[1:30:35] you say no lord i never thought he says
[1:30:37] yes i told you
[1:30:38] didn't i tell you that your ears and
[1:30:40] your heart and your mind has not even
[1:30:42] thought about it
[1:30:43] and your your eyes have not seen and the
[1:30:45] ears have not had
[1:30:47] we can only imagine with our weak minds
[1:30:51] and we can't even make a perfect picture
[1:30:52] of what we are going
[1:30:54] there to be or to have
[1:30:57] amen let me let me wrap up here
[1:31:01] the problem with our churches and people
[1:31:03] is that we start to copy
[1:31:05] you see let's watch that out we start to
[1:31:08] copy
[1:31:09] copy my friend to copy my another church
[1:31:12] huh
[1:31:13] we start to copy and that's what's wrong
[1:31:15] with our country today
[1:31:16] is that our churches one trying to copy
[1:31:19] the other after the other
[1:31:20] and they said with their head in
[1:31:22] television and things and they try to
[1:31:23] impersonate and copy after some filthy
[1:31:25] thing
[1:31:26] they seen on television huh let's wash
[1:31:28] out those spirits
[1:31:29] because they operate from the fourth
[1:31:31] dimension not only television nowadays
[1:31:33] that brother my mother is a friend of
[1:31:35] mine he was preaching that
[1:31:36] not the youth don't even want television
[1:31:38] anymore nowadays no no
[1:31:40] that's the second hand for them
[1:31:42] television is nothing there's other
[1:31:43] catches
[1:31:44] that are coming from that dimension that
[1:31:46] are so dangerous
[1:31:47] huh let's be watchful of those spirits
[1:31:50] let's check them
[1:31:50] let's ask the lord to give us a spirit
[1:31:52] of discernment to say hey
[1:31:55] this spirit to pick it up on time
[1:31:58] amen and one is trying to copy the other
[1:32:02] and they said and then and the churches
[1:32:03] and head televisions and things
[1:32:05] and try to impersonate and copy some
[1:32:07] other filthy things into
[1:32:08] and bring it into the church that's the
[1:32:10] problem you see
[1:32:12] why why doesn't it end up there no
[1:32:14] because it's a spirit
[1:32:16] it must end up coming to the church
[1:32:22] we go and take things from gomorrah
[1:32:26] and sodom deliberately or not
[1:32:30] and we bring them no no this is how we
[1:32:32] need to do it
[1:32:33] if i can happen to pick up a wrong
[1:32:35] spirit out there
[1:32:37] the lord must give me a proper
[1:32:38] discernment to pick it up
[1:32:40] and destroy it i mustn't bring it here
[1:32:42] no
[1:32:43] we must be watchful we must be wise
[1:32:46] that because listen to it we are not
[1:32:48] immune from being attacked by the devil
[1:32:50] no
[1:32:51] but what we are what the devil must know
[1:32:53] is that we will pick him up first time
[1:32:55] and the lord will give us that
[1:32:56] discernment the spirit of picking up
[1:32:59] something that's not right we will be
[1:33:01] attacked
[1:33:02] but the counter attack with the devil
[1:33:04] will be like a bazooka in a bazooka
[1:33:09] who knows the bazooka
[1:33:13] amen may the lord help us in closing
[1:33:17] there was mana in that inner holy of
[1:33:20] holies
[1:33:21] you know there was a scepter there was a
[1:33:23] scepter of moses
[1:33:24] the stick maybe the prophet says maybe
[1:33:26] it was an almond stick
[1:33:28] he says maybe it was an almond stick
[1:33:30] that was dry that old moses was using it
[1:33:33] you know
[1:33:33] going to pharaoh there and telling
[1:33:35] pharaoh he says it was in there also
[1:33:37] yeah and and there was a port of mana
[1:33:39] mana was flowing
[1:33:41] falling every morning and they were
[1:33:42] picking up and eating it huh
[1:33:44] but if they leave it for how many hours
[1:33:48] for 24 hours 48 it goes off
[1:33:52] you can't eat it anymore there's worms
[1:33:53] on it but the one that was in the
[1:33:55] inner holy of holies
[1:33:58] it was not getting off huh it was fresh
[1:34:01] all the time
[1:34:02] it was better than your your your
[1:34:04] samsung free
[1:34:05] sorry samsung you know
[1:34:09] you know there's something pretty that
[1:34:10] you just said click pretty it tells you
[1:34:13] that one can't keep your mana fresh
[1:34:16] the holy of holies will keep your mana
[1:34:19] as fresh
[1:34:21] now that one the manna was not getting
[1:34:24] off in the golden part
[1:34:26] and the scepter for moses the prophet
[1:34:28] said hell that stepped up
[1:34:30] overnight started to germinate overnight
[1:34:33] there were some almonds fruits
[1:34:36] there was some elmo's fruit that that
[1:34:38] were already on there
[1:34:39] why because when things happen from
[1:34:43] inside
[1:34:44] when things happen from the inside when
[1:34:46] there is an inside job
[1:34:48] there is a success where there is an
[1:34:50] inside job
[1:34:52] you can take anything that is dead huh
[1:34:55] tell me about the master seat how can a
[1:34:57] master sit
[1:34:59] and bring such a massive tree hey
[1:35:02] why why can you put a small little seed
[1:35:06] there
[1:35:06] and it comes and grows something is
[1:35:08] happening inside the seed
[1:35:10] there is a life there inside job is it
[1:35:13] must be an inside
[1:35:15] job there is a fellowship in there that
[1:35:17] is happening
[1:35:18] that the light of the sun and the
[1:35:20] environment strike the seat and it was
[1:35:22] in the good grounds
[1:35:23] and started to bring things not from
[1:35:26] outside
[1:35:27] from inside you can have the wonderful
[1:35:30] grounds
[1:35:31] you can have the sunlight you can have
[1:35:33] all those things but if there's nothing
[1:35:35] happening in there
[1:35:38] what will come out
[1:35:42] that manner was not getting off the holy
[1:35:44] ghost can occupy an outside position
[1:35:47] that's what i was warning you before
[1:35:48] that let's just be careful
[1:35:50] that our holy spirit that we operate
[1:35:52] from inside
[1:35:53] that we are sealed and we ask the lord
[1:35:55] we become desperate before the lord
[1:35:57] that our spirit our point of operation
[1:36:00] our our camp you know our base
[1:36:04] is in the soul where the opera the holy
[1:36:07] spirit operates
[1:36:08] because he can also operate from the
[1:36:10] outside not outside
[1:36:12] then a scene like he can operate from
[1:36:14] outside but that's not what we ideally
[1:36:16] need that's not what will take us home
[1:36:19] what will take us home
[1:36:20] is when you went inside and the kitchen
[1:36:23] behind us drops
[1:36:24] and we are in the ass and the lord amen
[1:36:28] in closing let me jump here so
[1:36:31] the the most important thing is that
[1:36:34] when the when the word of the lord come
[1:36:36] it finds you in the position you know
[1:36:38] that you can't wait
[1:36:39] for a train here in silver stream
[1:36:41] station or
[1:36:42] or here at the water station here behind
[1:36:45] us here in taita
[1:36:46] or in the other station you can't wait
[1:36:49] for for it saying
[1:36:51] somewhere when the chain passes there
[1:36:53] you must wait at the station
[1:36:54] ready with your ticket to get on board
[1:36:58] amen that's where our position should be
[1:37:01] it is the place you are abiding at is
[1:37:04] where you are at amen you remember
[1:37:06] that many times on the campground these
[1:37:09] blessings run out you are eating manna
[1:37:12] correct manna but you haven't you have
[1:37:14] not concentrated your
[1:37:16] your life yet that's what we need to
[1:37:18] watch out to make sure
[1:37:20] that we concentrate our life you know
[1:37:22] when they give you a drink
[1:37:26] that is concentrated man
[1:37:29] is strong it means you must dilute it
[1:37:32] when they give you a drink that is
[1:37:34] concentrated so that's how our life
[1:37:36] should be
[1:37:36] our life should be concentrated in the
[1:37:39] lord
[1:37:40] in the inner chamber in the holy
[1:37:43] of holies amen right and went into the
[1:37:47] place like around behind the holy of
[1:37:49] holies
[1:37:50] when he was in there nothing did he
[1:37:53] didn't hear nothing
[1:37:54] the world no more so i'm reading from
[1:37:56] what the prophet he
[1:37:57] says if you just hear some chop with him
[1:38:00] and
[1:38:00] it's because the prophet will jump to
[1:38:02] another thought and say something amen
[1:38:03] and when men and women need today what
[1:38:05] men and women need today
[1:38:08] after you have been brought into the
[1:38:09] kingdom of god is a hidden life
[1:38:11] men and women who will get with christ
[1:38:14] and the curtains dropped behind them
[1:38:16] you are you don't care what the world
[1:38:17] says you don't care what the people say
[1:38:19] you are living in with christ where the
[1:38:22] manner
[1:38:23] you are eating from the golden pot of
[1:38:25] manna every day
[1:38:26] day and night all the time amen living
[1:38:30] on the mountain
[1:38:31] underneath the cloudless sky that's what
[1:38:33] the prophet says he was becoming poetic
[1:38:35] amen so may the lord help us may the
[1:38:37] lord bless each and every one of you
[1:38:39] that that that that we can be those
[1:38:42] christians that are concentrated
[1:38:44] that are pursuing if there's anything
[1:38:48] that you can do for yourself tonight
[1:38:50] is to cry to god to pull you inside the
[1:38:52] inner chamber
[1:38:54] this flesh one day is gonna thank you
[1:38:56] brother ben says
[1:38:58] it will say thank you man because
[1:39:00] because you would have
[1:39:01] saved it it would have changed huh
[1:39:05] it would have changed it wouldn't have
[1:39:06] taken you to hell it would have changed
[1:39:08] and you get a new body
[1:39:10] and you get into heaven this flesh would
[1:39:12] thank you one day
[1:39:14] let me read justice one last thing what
[1:39:16] the prophet says
[1:39:17] most of the things that i've already
[1:39:18] went ahead of myself i've spoken about
[1:39:20] the road of moses
[1:39:22] that it blossomed and yielded the fruits
[1:39:23] amen overnight that's what i like so
[1:39:26] much
[1:39:27] that that road when it's in the presence
[1:39:29] of god it brought the fruits overnight
[1:39:31] what made the road so too bad go be in
[1:39:34] the presence of the lord
[1:39:35] and you get refreshed that's what made
[1:39:37] the road to bat
[1:39:39] overnight naturally what makes the trees
[1:39:41] to get refreshed
[1:39:42] is the cool of the night and the morning
[1:39:45] comes
[1:39:46] when all the nature gets quiet and the
[1:39:49] jew comes and refreshes the tree
[1:39:51] then it gets buddy when the presence
[1:39:55] of the lord comes when all the world
[1:39:58] shuts off
[1:39:59] in other words when you switch off from
[1:40:02] everything of the world
[1:40:03] when you are so attentive to the spirit
[1:40:06] amen and the presence of the world come
[1:40:09] and you start to bite
[1:40:10] who wants to bat and have the almonds or
[1:40:13] the fruits
[1:40:15] in the morning already ripe ready
[1:40:19] to be saved may the lord help us do you
[1:40:22] ever

[1:40:24] the night and pass early
[1:40:26] of the morning also it blossoms it gives
[1:40:29] fragrance
[1:40:29] and did you ever go early of the morning
[1:40:32] to the define
[1:40:33] of the fragrance you find out that early
[1:40:36] of the morning when you get out
[1:40:38] the jew is hanging low the trees are
[1:40:40] burning
[1:40:41] the blossoms are coming up and the
[1:40:43] perfume is
[1:40:44] go along the road and smell the honey
[1:40:48] circles
[1:40:49] into the rose garden early of the
[1:40:51] morning
[1:40:52] that's why it's been quiet nature nature
[1:40:54] has through the night
[1:40:56] it's got quiet and god bathed it with
[1:40:59] refreshing amen we are so amen we are
[1:41:02] also
[1:41:03] nature ourselves we are nature
[1:41:06] we are living in this nature here called
[1:41:08] flesh when we get quiet before the lord
[1:41:11] before the presence of the lord his
[1:41:13] freshness will come
[1:41:15] when we get quiet in the presence of the
[1:41:17] lord and
[1:41:18] we take time and get quiet in the lord
[1:41:23] and listen to the lord quietly his
[1:41:26] presence come
[1:41:27] and then he will brood over us that's
[1:41:30] when the biting comes that's why the
[1:41:32] manna
[1:41:33] would not go off that when the manna
[1:41:35] will never get finished
[1:41:37] amen christians not wanting to testify i
[1:41:41] spoke about that amen we are going to
[1:41:42] testify
[1:41:43] are we going to testify we are going to
[1:41:46] testify and tell people
[1:41:47] that's that little word that you can
[1:41:49] mention to someone
[1:41:51] i was talking to someone arguing he was
[1:41:53] telling me
[1:41:54] he's busy driving with me taking me home
[1:41:57] he says to me oh no no no the problem
[1:41:58] with you christians you want to impose
[1:42:00] to us i say no we don't want to impose
[1:42:03] god has given you a free moral agency
[1:42:06] for you to choose but he wants you and
[1:42:09] he's a wonderful man he says i can only
[1:42:11] come
[1:42:11] if you preach you met him from dear
[1:42:14] friend of mine simon

[1:42:18] god because
[1:42:19] i like him and he loves me and he just
[1:42:21] wants to be around me
[1:42:22] so i pray that the lord can help him
[1:42:24] that the lord can touch him because his
[1:42:26] wife is a christian
[1:42:27] but him no so i must not even give him
[1:42:30] this sleep because you'll hear that i
[1:42:32] was talking about him

[1:42:37] us
[1:42:38] lastly i just want to emphasize you see
[1:42:41] i'm closing my bible
[1:42:42] i just want to emphasize the blood
[1:42:44] atonement
[1:42:46] that so
[1:42:49] and so when let me read for you and so
[1:42:51] when when sin comes in
[1:42:53] it separate men from fellowship sin
[1:42:56] notice what god did to bring men back to
[1:42:58] fellowship i just want to emphasize it
[1:43:01] he introduced the world a blood
[1:43:04] redemption god killed animals he pulled
[1:43:08] for this for their skill and put for
[1:43:11] their skin
[1:43:12] showing a blood redemption god laid
[1:43:15] out the welcome met back home by the
[1:43:18] shading of the blood
[1:43:20] and that was then and he
[1:43:23] be has been and will always be god
[1:43:26] provided preparation for fellowship with
[1:43:28] him
[1:43:29] is through the shed blood of the lord
[1:43:31] jesus christ and that was that is what
[1:43:33] we are going into this easter
[1:43:34] and i pray that the lord will take these
[1:43:36] words
[1:43:38] and just bless them in your hearts and
[1:43:41] just encourage you as we go back home
[1:43:43] that we can go and say lord you know
[1:43:46] we have been given everything if you
[1:43:48] find that you cannot have something
[1:43:51] ask god and if you find that you cannot
[1:43:53] have something
[1:43:54] and you are unable to ask god for that
[1:43:57] something
[1:43:58] what should you do you should ask god to
[1:44:01] give you the ability to ask
[1:44:04] because he said we must ask anything i'm
[1:44:06] sitting here
[1:44:07] i'm struggling to pray
[1:44:11] but i've got a god who said i must ask
[1:44:13] anything i must ask god and say lord
[1:44:15] help me to be able to pray because when
[1:44:18] i pray i want to talk up to you about
[1:44:20] this and this
[1:44:21] anything the devil likes to hide
[1:44:24] the magnitude of what we can ask there
[1:44:27] is
[1:44:27] everything we can ask including the
[1:44:29] things that we think we can't
[1:44:31] and the devil don't want us to think
[1:44:33] that we are not able to ask for that
[1:44:35] he said he's a mental guy so let's
[1:44:38] approach him
[1:44:39] by the spirit that lord open everything
[1:44:42] remind me the things i must ask you
[1:44:46] then the lord will remind you then you
[1:44:48] can ask him then he can give you
[1:44:50] that's how god operates you ask he gives
[1:44:53] you
[1:44:54] from the heart may god bless you tonight
[1:44:57] let's step hands for the lord
[1:45:05] 30 minutes past nine last time it was
