[0:35] welcome back to church everyone I mean
[0:39] it's good to be back I mean and you know
[0:46] I think I think one of the one of the
[0:49] reasons why the Lord has blessed our
[0:51] fellowship here is that it hasn't really
[0:53] taken a hiatus away from church for all
[0:56] of us to really appreciate Church I
[0:58] think we appreciated it before this and
[1:00] we appreciate it
[1:01] after this you know it's not suddenly
[1:04] like well I didn't realize how great
[1:05] church was although we we think about
[1:06] more like that we didn't I don't think
[1:08] we as a fellowship left a net beforehand
[1:10] you know in and and you know when you've
[1:13] got that sort of attitude that's when
[1:15] the Lord can really bless but that being
[1:17] said it's nice to be back streaming
[1:19] doesn't quite do it but I don't know
[1:23] that it will catch on you know the Bible
[1:26] says forsake not the assembling of
[1:27] yourselves together as a romantic manner
[1:30] of summer's and even more as you see the
[1:31] Day approaching and and you know we've
[1:35] got we've got a spirit in us and around
[1:37] us that that that you can't really feel
[1:42] over the digital medium you know we're a
[1:45] spirit and when we gather together the
[1:47] the warmth that is the Holy Ghost in our
[1:49] lives we all come together and it
[1:51] creates an atmosphere and it creates a
[1:54] warm atmosphere a friendly warm
[1:58] atmosphere you know when you go in
[2:01] places where it's cold where where
[2:03] there's a lot of death you know there's
[2:05] no life than each person's spirit the
[2:07] atmosphere it feels really cold but you
[2:10] know in a fellowship you come together
[2:11] like this and it's the opposite you know
[2:13] and as you sing the songs and that the
[2:16] word comes and things and as the day
[2:17] goes on there the atmosphere gets warmer
[2:19] and warmer it's like I was trying to dry
[2:21] all these boots close to the fire last
[2:24] night it's a fun little project cuz you
[2:26] sort of move them all and you do this
[2:27] and it and but it's kind of like as they
[2:32] all get warmer they kind of just get
[2:33] warmer or warmer they've all the insides
[2:35] warm up and even when you're moving them
[2:36] around they're all kinda they go faster
[2:38] and faster because they're getting
[2:40] warmer it's kind of like when you're
[2:41] cooking food to you know brother nd
[2:42] after a while you everything in your pan
[2:44] is really hot
[2:44] and it's just gets hotter and hotter but
[2:47] that then that's what it is like amongst
[2:50] us you know as we fellowship that the
[2:52] atmosphere gets more so let's um let's
[2:55] just stand and we'll just come up the
[2:59] service to the Lord and then I've just
[3:02] got a few little things I have to notice
[3:03] as an N we'll begin worship heavenly
[3:06] father we're so grateful Lord that we
[3:07] can gather back here again Lord with
[3:11] saints of like precious faith and we
[3:14] appreciate the means that we have to be
[3:16] able to do this Lord and as I said
[3:20] earlier Lord I believe that any one of
[3:22] our hearts we always did Lord and I
[3:25] thank you that that each person here is
[3:27] sincere and loves you Lord and lost
[3:29] fellowship Lord an end and we want to
[3:33] gather in this place together so that we
[3:36] enjoy meeting each other we enjoy
[3:37] meeting the Christ in each other and on
[3:39] but moreso Lord we would like to meet
[3:42] you this morning Lord Jesus and have
[3:43] your spirit dwell amongst us Lord and
[3:46] work in our lives and touch us in a way
[3:48] that only you can Lord Jesus Lord so we
[3:51] are so thankful to be here was so
[3:53] thankful this opportunity well may we
[3:55] lay hold upon it lay hold upon this
[3:57] opportunity and and just put our minds
[4:01] in an atmosphere where you can work Lord
[4:03] may we put off any thoughts that would
[4:04] hinder the direction of leading towards
[4:07] you maybe just put those thoughts aside
[4:09] Lord may we enter into worship enter
[4:11] into the ministry may bless our day
[4:14] bless our fellowship Lord forgive us of
[4:15] every Sun we've committed Lord and we
[4:18] just come boldly before your throne of
[4:19] grace this morning Lord knowing that we
[4:22] have a faithful high priest Lord that
[4:24] that can be touched with the feelings of
[4:26] our infirmities Lord we don't have a
[4:28] foreign God that doesn't understand but
[4:30] you were made like unto us Lord of the
[4:33] seed of Abraham as a human Lord to
[4:36] understand what we go through and we
[4:37] just thank you that asset Almighty God
[4:39] that we meet this morning Lord and the
[4:40] and the holiest of holies Lord say we
[4:42] just want to come up the service to you
[4:43] we just thank you so much Lord for this
[4:45] time we can gather once again we just
[4:47] commit ourselves to you in Jesus name
[4:49] Amen
[4:50] praise the Lord I can't say this on live
[4:52] ado let's give the Lord
[4:58] give I don't know if we can do the whole
[5:00] shake touch but you can give everyone in
[5:02] it an elbow a mean
[5:13] so we've yet I just have to run through
[5:16] a few things we've got the signer net
[5:19] that brother cube in a different ones
[5:21] would have given you at the door there
[5:22] so brother cube in see if maybe they
[5:24] might send you little things so maybe
[5:26] switch your phones on silent if you
[5:27] haven't already and these hand sanitiser
[5:32] by the front door there as well brother
[5:36] there were there was a we're having a
[5:38] little vote and I think brother kuben
[5:40] has already picked up most of your
[5:41] little um yes or no papers so that that
[5:47] would be done there's a lunch afterwards
[5:51] and then we have a at 3:30 we're going
[5:54] to aim for a service back here at 3:30
[5:55] um yeah but it will be most of us would
[5:59] be at the fellowship there so we'll know
[6:01] when it's going to be on and I think
[6:04] that's all thought I missed anything
[6:05] brother bin did I get over yeah I think
[6:08] I'd like to get these things out of the
[6:10] way first because it's kind of
[6:10] disruptive when you put them when you're
[6:13] in worship you don't really feel like
[6:14] talking about hand sanitizer or anything
[6:17] like that doesn't seem to fit the
[6:21] atmosphere praise the Lord who loves the
[6:24] Lord this morning
[6:25] amen it's very nice to see all your
[6:27] faces it is very nice and I really I
[6:32] really appreciate this fellowship
[6:34] and I really appreciate the every person
[6:39] in it that do their different roles and
[6:41] I appreciate brother Ben as a our pastor
[6:45] that the the labor of love and his wife
[6:46] that they put in and and everyone else
[6:49] that there over the years have come in
[6:52] and just found their their place than
[6:53] the body and faithfully Serbs week after
[6:56] week to help everybody else out you know
[7:01] and and to help us all out on our
[7:04] journey you know I wouldn't be the same
[7:05] if it wasn't for this fellowship I
[7:07] wouldn't be where I am if it wasn't for
[7:09] this fellowship and and the fellowship
[7:11] is not the hardware but it's the it's
[7:15] the people you know it's each different
[7:17] one and you have all blessed my life and
[7:20] different ways and and my family's life
[7:23] so I really appreciate that and I think
[7:25] each person could say the same about
[7:26] each other that we've all blessed each
[7:30] other as we just surrender ourselves to
[7:32] the Lord and let the Lord move through
[7:34] our life and minister through us and I
[7:38] believe is us eight years who's here
[7:43] right right way way back at the
[7:45] beginning will you hear sister Christine
[7:50] I think it was um I'm gonna get started
[7:54] soon but I know this is quite carnal but
[7:58] one of my nice memories was women were
[8:00] way back in the first church that used
[8:01] to leak everywhere we use if they have
[8:02] the buckets and under different places
[8:05] that leaked in you had to be queue for
[8:06] you didn't sit under a spot like if it
[8:08] wasn't raining the buckets were going in
[8:09] it will start raining and you get
[8:11] dripped on a certain dish in the last
[8:16] like there's quite kind of what I used
[8:17] to say I said I liked after church we
[8:19] always have fish and chips you remember
[8:21] that we used to go to they that yeah I
[8:24] can't really do that as much these days
[8:26] a little bit older but um but we were
[8:30] every Sunday we would always hang there
[8:31] would only be about three or four
[8:32] families but by the Lord's grace each
[8:35] one is coming and it's been a real
[8:37] blessing in it so it's been a really
[8:39] enjoyable journey and as long as we keep
[8:42] the Lord's Center we keep the right
[8:43] attitude we respect our pastor and we
[8:44] respect each other we pretty much won't
[8:48] go wrong you know so we just continue
[8:50] doing what we're doing just loving the
[8:52] Lord I mean so now we're going to get
[8:53] into some worship now we've actually
[8:55] chosen all local songs this morning

[8:59] written over the years so that's what

[46:20] amen so this just read here this is this
[46:23] is from Luke 17 verse 11 it says and it
[46:26] came to pass as he went to Jerusalem
[46:28] that he passed through the midst of
[46:30] Samaria and Galilee and as he entered
[46:32] into a certain village there met him ten
[46:34] men that were lepers that stood afar off
[46:37] and they lifted up their voices and said
[46:39] Jesus master have mercy on us and when
[46:42] he saw them he said unto them go show
[46:44] yourselves under the priests and it came
[46:46] to pass that as they went they were
[46:47] cleansed and one of them when he saw
[46:50] that he was healed turned back and with
[46:51] a loud voice glorified God hallelujah
[46:54] amen and fell down on his face at his
[46:58] feet giving him thanks and he was a
[47:00] Samaritan and Jesus answering said were
[47:02] there not ten cleansed but where are the
[47:05] nine there aren't they there are not
[47:08] found that returned to give glory to God
[47:10] save this stranger and he said unto Him
[47:13] arise go thy way thy faith has made the
[47:15] whole I don't wanna just go off and you
[47:19] know I want to come back and give thanks
[47:20] go thanks our Lord Jesus Christ
[47:23] hallelujah glory to God amen let's let's
[47:27] now go to revelations 19 and we're going
[47:31] to read here well familiar scripture
[47:34] that we're going to go to revelations 20
[47:36] and then Matthew 8 so I trust you don't
[47:39] mind standing for a bit I mean I
[47:42] appreciate the songs amen praise the
[47:45] Lord amen the music and the atmosphere
[47:49] and amen
[47:54] revelations 19 6 can you just turn me
[47:56] down a bit on on on these things and I
[48:00] heard as it were the voice of a great
[48:02] multitude and as the voice of many
[48:05] waters is a voice of mighty thunderings
[48:06] saying Alleluia for the Lord God
[48:10] omnipotent reigneth now your
[48:12] voices actually this is a speaking of
[48:13] you this is your voice you're part of
[48:15] this voice I mean let us be glad and
[48:17] rejoice and give honour to him for the
[48:19] marriage of the lamb has come and his
[48:21] wife hath made herself ready and to her
[48:24] was granted that she should be arrayed
[48:25] in fine linen clean and white for the
[48:28] fine linen is the righteousness of
[48:30] saints talk about you hallelujah
[48:33] and he saith unto me bling I write
[48:35] blessed are they which are called in to
[48:37] the marriage supper of the lamb hello
[48:38] blessed how are you today oh yeah the
[48:41] scripture should be personal
[48:42] I mean we're blessed because we're being
[48:45] called and knowing that we have
[48:46] responded to the call amen
[48:50] and he saith unto me these are the true
[48:52] sayings of God and I fell at his feet to
[48:54] worship Him and he said unto me see thou
[48:56] do it not I am thy fellow-servant and of
[48:59] thy brethren and have the testimony of
[49:01] Jesus worship God for the testimony of
[49:04] Jesus is the spirit of prophecy now let
[49:07] us go to revelations chapter 20 and
[49:08] verse 7 just just over the next page I
[49:12] think we should just have a jubilee I
[49:14] think we should just rejoice hallelujah
[49:18] and when the thousand years was expired
[49:20] Satan had shall be loosed out of his
[49:23] prison and shall go out to deceive the
[49:25] nations which are in the four quarters
[49:26] of the earth Gog and Magog to gather
[49:28] them together to battle the number of
[49:30] Homer's as the sand of the sea and they
[49:34] went up on the Britt's breadth of the
[49:36] earth and compassed the camp of the
[49:38] Saints about and the beloved city and
[49:40] fire came down from God out of heaven
[49:41] and devoured them now I like this verse
[49:44] this this verse 10 I like it and the
[49:46] devil that deceived them was cast into
[49:48] the lake of fire and brimstone where the
[49:51] beast and the false prophet are and
[49:52] shall be tormented day and night for
[49:54] ever and ever you know that feeling that
[49:56] you know when he was cast out of your
[49:57] life I mean that's going to be a feeling
[49:59] that's never gonna range I mean that
[50:01] word caste means he's gonna be thrown
[50:03] Holly he's not gonna willingly go he's
[50:05] gonna be chucked in hallelujah and then
[50:08] just as a bit of a context we're gonna
[50:09] go to Matthew 8 and verse 28 and 29
[50:13] hallelujah that's why I believe in here
[50:15] we're in revelations 19 hallelujah for
[50:17] the Lord God omnipotent reigneth glory
[50:20] to God hallelujah
[50:22] you shouldn't be that happy I don't know
[50:25] I can be a lot more happier you know we
[50:27] should be a lot more have Matthew eight
[50:30] and twenty eight and behold of him
[50:33] Matthew 18:21 yes and when he was come
[50:37] yes and when he was come to the other
[50:39] side into the country of the gadarenes I
[50:42] mean I mean good generous sorry there
[50:44] met him two possessed with Devils coming
[50:47] out of the tombs exceedingly fierce so
[50:49] that no man might pass by that way and
[50:51] behold they cried out saying what have
[50:53] we to do with thee Jesus thou son of God
[50:55] now notice these next words art thou
[50:58] come hither to torment us before the
[51:01] time so they know they've got a time of
[51:04] torment coming right thank you and glory
[51:09] let's just say it's a word of pressure
[51:11] Lord Jesus we just come with such
[51:14] Thanksgiving Lord you've washed us white
[51:18] as snow you have made us new creatures

[52:04] on this end time but we're not stumbling
[52:06] and darkness wandering and then
[52:08] presuming but we know who we are we know
[52:09] in whom we have believed and we know we
[52:11] were going so father I pray you bless
[52:13] each one here and those who couldn't
[52:15] make it Oh God

[52:34] but Lord might be like they're here
[52:36] little matter be in your presence my
[52:38] Godfather may not be looking and just
[52:40] just observing but maybe Lord
[52:42] participating father may you granted our
[52:44] God bless each one here Lord in Jesus
[52:46] Christ's name Amen amen god bless you
[52:50] friends you may you may have your seats
[52:51] this morning amen so I want to if I
[52:54] could title this I want to I want to
[52:56] speak about the devil saying I've seen
[52:58] that look before
[52:59] now we understand that there was a war
[53:01] in heaven you know I love the Bible
[53:03] because it tells us what happened in the
[53:05] beginning what's going to happen in the
[53:06] end you know all the middle bits just
[53:08] really detailed but the main thing is we
[53:10] started in the beginning we and again
[53:11] continue in the end right so you know I
[53:13] think we should just rejoice hallelujah
[53:16] so you know we we we read we read The
[53:20] Devil's end I mean we read that he will
[53:22] be cast into the lake of fire and you
[53:24] know no doubt he must be really
[53:26] panicking about now right you know you
[53:31] know this this this um this uh you know
[53:34] this epidemic has has spread through the
[53:36] world but I believe it's just made the
[53:37] bride stronger I mean it's made her love
[53:40] the Lord more it's made its has made her
[53:42] appreciate I mean the reality of having
[53:44] their sins washed away I mean it
[53:46] actually makes having the token the Holy
[53:48] Ghost in our lives more of a reality I
[53:50] trusted have for you I mean so you know
[53:52] it hasn't stopped earlier as the Apostle
[53:55] Paul would say but the Word of God is
[53:57] not bound
[53:57] Palio so so it hasn't shut us down Amen
[54:00] it's just actually lifted us up because
[54:02] we must remember the Prophet told us
[54:04] that that national pressure will put the
[54:07] churches together in the world
[54:08] constituted national pressure will do it
[54:10] but the power of God will lift the bride
[54:11] off the earth I mean so it's not going
[54:13] to lift this up the best pressure is not
[54:15] gonna lift us up the power of God will
[54:16] this word we have received is going to
[54:18] take us up into glory I mean but if you
[54:20] see everything around the world is being
[54:22] pushed together let's unite let's do
[54:24] this you know but but you know the power
[54:26] of God will take us up in the glory I
[54:27] mean then I trust that you've seen in
[54:29] your own lives the reality of the blood
[54:31] of Jesus Christ I mean in these last few
[54:34] weeks these eight or nine or I know how
[54:35] long it's been since we've seen each
[54:37] other I mean but you've seen the power
[54:39] of God manifested in a greater way
[54:40] you've seen them living your families
[54:42] more I trust you have I mean there's
[54:44] such a reality I mean when we can
[54:46] more than just talked about being under
[54:47] the blood you know and just saying oh
[54:49] you know you've got to be under the
[54:50] blood just like these lights were and
[54:52] you know you know before they left
[54:54] Goshen so I'm trying to slow down you
[54:57] know you know but but it became it to me
[54:59] it became a reality I'm actually I'm not
[55:02] worried about a plague or a pestilence
[55:04] amen spiritual death can't hit me
[55:06] because I'm under the blood hallelujah
[55:08] and I'm safe and secure amen so so we
[55:12] read The Devil's end and he will be cast
[55:14] as like a foreign and as I said before
[55:17] no doubt he must be panicking and we
[55:19] will read actually he has great rest at
[55:21] this time because he knows he has but a
[55:22] short time because you know you gotta
[55:24] think about it he he he stood there if I
[55:27] could just maybe dramatize this a little
[55:29] bit you know he stood there in the
[55:32] Garden of Eden when the first prophecy
[55:34] was spoken and he is actually walked
[55:37] watching God fulfill his word and he
[55:40] keeps fulfilling it and he keeps
[55:42] fulfilling it remember the end says he's
[55:43] gonna burn so he's walking towards his
[55:45] own destruction the devil is so keep
[55:47] singing fulfilled he keeps singer
[55:49] fulfilled he tries to stop a being
[55:50] fulfilled he can't stop living fulfill
[55:52] he keeps he tried to stop Moses he
[55:54] couldn't stop Moses he tried to stop
[55:55] David he couldn't stop David he tried to
[55:57] stop a larger he couldn't stop Elijah he
[55:59] tried to stop the early church he
[56:00] couldn't stop the early church he tried
[56:02] to stop them during the Reformation
[56:03] couldn't stop them during the
[56:04] Reformation tried to stop the bride now
[56:06] can't stop the bride now he cannot stop
[56:08] the bride coming to her position taking
[56:11] a rapture he cannot do it but he tries
[56:14] with all his might but there's such a
[56:16] burning passion in the Bride of Christ
[56:17] hallelujah amen that he cannot stop it
[56:20] and now we're well we're nearly in the
[56:24] concordance in the maps you know
[56:26] yeah pick out something if that was
[56:29] prophesying he can't stop that either
[56:30] and the cover and the cover you know so
[56:32] you know but you know he's the devil is
[56:34] in such a way he can't stop it now you'd
[56:38] think you know people have more sense
[56:41] than him because people actually come to
[56:43] realization I should just quit and try
[56:45] something else you know someone who's
[56:48] actually in their right mind you know
[56:49] when God deals with someone and they're
[56:51] in the right mind if they're really
[56:53] smart they'll just give up and quit and
[56:54] say Lord take my life you're dealing
[56:56] with me Here I am
[56:57] Amen yeah but the devil's made in such a
[56:59] way men because deceived people deceive
[57:02] and the devil is the most deceived being
[57:04] I say person if I use that word and all
[57:07] of creation cause he thinks somehow he
[57:09] can just slip it in in the end and
[57:11] somehow win but newsflash ain't gonna
[57:15] happen because God doesn't know
[57:18] everything but just that one bit and
[57:19] he's gonna see what's gonna happen God
[57:21] knows him from the beginning
[57:22] imagine fighting enemy imagine if we
[57:24] went to war against anyone in the world
[57:26] and when you're exactly real time what
[57:28] they'd be doing what troops I'd have
[57:30] what weapons what they'd be planning
[57:32] imagine you could not that you're you
[57:36] how could you lose a war if he knew
[57:38] exactly no real time no no no like a
[57:40] guess and we think they'll do this and
[57:42] based on our intelligence I'll do this
[57:44] and it can be accurate but imagine real
[57:45] time and he's gonna scratch his head
[57:48] here and he's gonna do this here and the
[57:49] devil's you know you know the enemy is
[57:51] gonna come here with us you'd know
[57:52] exactly how to combat that phone but you
[57:55] think that that enemy is crazy to think
[57:58] he can win that war because because his
[58:01] adversary knows exactly what it's going
[58:02] to do doesn't mean oh I'll try this but
[58:05] but he knows he's going to try that you
[58:07] know and this is how the devil is
[58:08] somehow he thinks he's gonna win but God
[58:10] knows exactly down to the picosecond
[58:12] what he's gonna do what he's thinking
[58:15] hallelujah just like you know you know
[58:17] like the king of Syria was was was
[58:19] getting annoyed during the days of
[58:21] Elijah you know because he had seen
[58:23] troops this way and the Prophet God
[58:24] would tell the king of Israel know
[58:25] they're coming this way go this way and
[58:27] he got so frustrated I've got I've got a
[58:29] spy here
[58:30] what if he's a traitor and and his
[58:33] generals were actually smile with him
[58:34] say no no no they've got a prophet who
[58:37] actually knows the secrets in your
[58:38] bedchamber
[58:39] don't know how the general knew that but
[58:41] but I think he was smart enough so
[58:42] actually nothing he just knows what
[58:43] you're thinking about and your private
[58:44] life and that just goes to show you know
[58:46] God knows everything we're thinking
[58:49] about and God knows what the devil's
[58:50] thinking about hallelujah so so we don't
[58:53] need to worry how God will be right on
[58:55] time doesn't matter how dark it may get
[58:58] all this is a close-run thing no no no
[59:00] no no no huh you know how God likes a
[59:02] bit of drama this is all the great big
[59:05] driver to him brother for him see I mean
[59:07] so you know he likes it to come close
[59:09] mean hallelujah snatch away amen so but
[59:13] the devil thinks he can win but my Bible
[59:17] tells me he cannot win amen and this
[59:20] word has stood the test of time every
[59:22] critic has come against it has been
[59:24] proven wrong I mean this is the Word of
[59:26] God right hallelujah so we don't have to
[59:30] worry we just give God the praise
[59:34] hallelujah amen so so the devil now he
[59:39] thinks he can win now let's read let's
[59:41] go to let's go to Revelation chapter 12
[59:46] as I said if I could title it I'd say
[59:49] the devil would say oh I've seen that
[59:52] look before
[59:55] hallelujah revelations 12 and we're
[59:59] gonna read from verse 7 I love it
[1:00:03] I'm on the Lord's side he's not on my
[1:00:07] side I'm on his side hello there is a
[1:00:10] big difference now revelations 12 and
[1:00:14] verse 7 and there was war in heaven this
[1:00:17] is before there was an earth there was
[1:00:18] war in heaven Michael and his angels
[1:00:20] fought against the Dragon and the dragon
[1:00:22] fought and his angels now I love these
[1:00:25] next words and prevailed not doesn't say
[1:00:29] he won or nearly 190 he just lost a mint
[1:00:33] and prevent neither was there their
[1:00:35] place found any more in heaven and the
[1:00:38] Great Dragon was cast out he didn't
[1:00:41] choose to go he didn't just retreat he
[1:00:43] was cast out but he throws something oh
[1:00:45] he cast out oh I need that
[1:00:49] I mean but you know he didn't know let's
[1:00:52] make her a treat boys no no no he was
[1:00:53] cast out even as Jesus would would would
[1:00:56] tell his disciples when they were
[1:00:58] commissioned to go cast out Devils Jesus
[1:01:00] says I saw Satan fall from heaven like
[1:01:02] lightning
[1:01:03] so as the church was rising in power
[1:01:05] Satan was being cast out hallelujah amen
[1:01:09] now which deceiveth the whole world that
[1:01:11] he was cast out into the earth and his
[1:01:13] angels were cast out with him and I
[1:01:15] heard a loud voice saying in heaven now
[1:01:17] is come salvation and strength and the
[1:01:19] Kingdom of our God and the power of his
[1:01:21] Christ for the accuser of our
[1:01:31] you
[1:13:57] the baptism the name of Father Son Holy
[1:13:58] Ghost is the umbilical cord that ties
[1:14:00] the people to Rome and they have ceded
[1:14:02] their ownselves why because the doctrine
[1:14:05] ties them but we're free people
[1:14:07] we're free people we've been liberated
[1:14:10] hallelujah
[1:14:11] we're are free people this hour a minute
[1:14:14] this is a message of liberation
[1:14:17] hallelujah a true liberation you say
[1:14:21] well all but the devil all that all but
[1:14:23] this is not for me it is for you it
[1:14:25] doesn't matter what state you find
[1:14:26] yourself in what's going on in here
[1:14:28] just just reject it in the name of Jesus
[1:14:30] Christ accept your god-given rights I've
[1:14:33] done too much I've done to this now
[1:14:35] that's irrelevant hallelujah
[1:14:37] I mean this is an hour of liberation and
[1:14:41] we just happen to find ourselves being
[1:14:44] liberated hallelujah
[1:14:48] amen so now here he comes Moses into the
[1:14:51] throne room of Pharaoh and the devil
[1:14:53] says I've seen that look before
[1:14:54] why cause now that same one that cast
[1:14:57] him out of heaven has now come down to
[1:14:59] earth he's veiled in a prophet and he's
[1:15:01] saying let my people go I've said it
[1:15:06] before but they weren't Moses people now
[1:15:08] God's people why God was speaking first
[1:15:10] person through a man does God really do
[1:15:12] that yeah sure David would write the
[1:15:13] sounds my God my God why Zell forsaken
[1:15:16] me and he was looking at Calvary so now
[1:15:20] there was a contest and the first thing
[1:15:23] that Moses did was take his rod throw it
[1:15:26] down on the ground and became a serpent
[1:15:28] he picks it up by the tail and it
[1:15:30] becomes a rod now remember the the the
[1:15:32] insignia of Pharoah was a was a Cobra
[1:15:35] and he was considered not more than a
[1:15:37] king but a god king and so the reason
[1:15:40] that Moses would would would take that
[1:15:42] rod and throw it down turn to a snake
[1:15:44] and then lift her back up again turn to
[1:15:45] a rod again is that God was actually
[1:15:48] telling the devil devil my prophet under
[1:15:52] the blood of bulls and goats can loose
[1:15:54] you and can bind you he can loose you he
[1:15:56] can bind you he has full control over
[1:15:58] you devil it doesn't matter what you try
[1:16:00] and do what you think you can do I mean
[1:16:02] he is unstoppable and you will not be
[1:16:05] able to stop him no no way
[1:16:08] amen and then it's exactly the same
[1:16:10] thing with you and I I'm in under the
[1:16:12] blood of Jesus Christ I mean could we
[1:16:13] have a real service I mean if a man can
[1:16:16] do that under the blood of bulls and
[1:16:17] goats to liberate his people how much
[1:16:19] more people under the blood of Jesus
[1:16:20] Christ I mean to liberate their family
[1:16:22] liberate their loved ones liberate those
[1:16:24] ones around them
[1:16:25] hallelujah where's the powder bind and
[1:16:27] the powder loose but the problem is many
[1:16:30] times we don't address our enemy when he
[1:16:32] needs to be addressed amen you have the
[1:16:36] power to bind you have the power to
[1:16:38] loose the enemy but you've got to open
[1:16:44] your mouth and you've got to do it amen
[1:16:49] that doesn't mean you go over to
[1:16:50] people's out I know you do that in
[1:16:54] prayer but love will cast the devil out
[1:16:55] brother Bram you know you're a woman
[1:16:58] would come to her and say brother Brown
[1:16:59] my husband doesn't love me doesn't
[1:17:02] accept what I believe in
[1:17:03] you know what are we gonna do what
[1:17:04] should I do I'm gonna try to cast the
[1:17:06] devil and he just got mad he said what
[1:17:09] you do is you make his favorite pie does
[1:17:12] that God works make his favorite pie
[1:17:14] when he comes home put it down in front
[1:17:16] of him sit on his lap tell him you love
[1:17:18] him
[1:17:20] hallelujah see you need wisdom hey do it
[1:17:23] right it's not usurping that's what a
[1:17:27] home that would be right it takes love
[1:17:30] sometimes it takes love but in prayer
[1:17:32] you address yours
[1:17:34] you you you talk to the devil you tell
[1:17:37] him amen
[1:17:40] so we know the end of the story Moses
[1:17:43] came and Pharaoh said I'll not let my
[1:17:46] people go you I mean your people go he
[1:17:48] had in his heart because of his pride he
[1:17:51] wasn't willing to actually say you know
[1:17:52] what you can take them but because of
[1:17:55] his pride and his arrogance see he said
[1:17:58] no I'll not let them go and Moses hid
[1:18:01] fun and plague after plague Pharaoh
[1:18:04] tried to compromise the devil loves to
[1:18:06] compromise with us you know sure they
[1:18:09] can come to church but this or this but
[1:18:11] this and we say no full liberation will
[1:18:15] not leave one hoof behind remember God
[1:18:17] God was now availed in Moses
[1:18:20] and then and then Pharaoh you know
[1:18:22] eventually death strikes yes to let them
[1:18:24] go as God said he would as God said he
[1:18:27] would remember God told Moses before he
[1:18:30] ever went to Egypt you'll come back to
[1:18:32] this mountain again you'll come worship
[1:18:33] here again you'll bring the people here
[1:18:36] what happened that's was exactly what
[1:18:38] happened I mean so there was there was a
[1:18:41] there's that contest and and Moses God
[1:18:47] and Moses won the battle and then now
[1:18:51] every time a prophet would rise up the
[1:18:53] devil would try and destroy them but now
[1:18:56] we're the same thing now when Elijah
[1:18:57] came stomped into Ahab's a halfs throne
[1:19:00] room the devil maybe I've seen that look
[1:19:03] before
[1:19:04] hallelujah I've seen that look before
[1:19:07] maybe Joshua you know he was there with
[1:19:09] Moses and he would you know you know he
[1:19:11] was he was Moses minister and so on but
[1:19:13] after he met the captain of the host of
[1:19:15] the Lord maybe took on a different look
[1:19:18] hallelujah and maybe the devil said oh
[1:19:21] I've seen this I thought it I thought
[1:19:23] that looked left when Moses died but
[1:19:25] remember God may take his man or his
[1:19:29] woman be never leave says he never takes
[1:19:32] his spirit just like the devil will take
[1:19:34] his man but will will leave his spirit
[1:19:36] upon the earth right so there always be
[1:19:38] somebody somebody amen where the devil
[1:19:43] look and say I've seen that look before
[1:19:44] but he's not sure mean because like with
[1:19:46] Jesus if thou be the Son of God I think
[1:19:50] I've seen this before but if they'll be
[1:19:52] and the same thing he'll do with you you
[1:19:55] really dare one he said well you don't
[1:19:56] eat down to him nothing but I met God
[1:19:59] he's now veiled behind my skin so Elijah
[1:20:03] stopped in to Jezebel strode Andrew may
[1:20:05] have certain room says it's not going to
[1:20:07] be rain or Dew - I call for it is a
[1:20:09] contest went on and the devil said I've
[1:20:11] seen this look before then maybe the
[1:20:13] devil breathed a sigh of relief when the
[1:20:15] fiery chariot came and took Elijah away
[1:20:17] that wasn't the end of it remember
[1:20:19] there's always been the devil's devil
[1:20:20] all the way down through all the way
[1:20:24] down through the ages this being a
[1:20:25] devil's devil hallelujah
[1:20:28] hallelujah you know I said this in Cape
[1:20:30] Town and they looked at me like wow what
[1:20:34] do you mean Oh either deal anyway you
[1:20:37] know so there's always been member
[1:20:39] because God changes his form right he
[1:20:42] changes his a morph a or his form so the
[1:20:45] external appearance may be different but
[1:20:47] he is the same on the inside
[1:20:49] hallelujah Goliath would make his boast
[1:20:51] here was the devil's champion and he'd
[1:20:54] make his boast for forty days
[1:20:56] bring me a man bring me a man we don't
[1:20:59] know come on let's not get messy here
[1:21:01] just pick your champion I'll fight him
[1:21:03] we don't know Lindsey I you know if I
[1:21:06] win you serve me you know if he wins
[1:21:08] will serve you and and there was a
[1:21:10] Devil's champion he has anointed this
[1:21:13] warrior of gas this mighty Goliath but
[1:21:16] there's a shepherd boy that had been
[1:21:18] anointed little shepherd boy been
[1:21:21] anointed by a predestinate and ordained
[1:21:22] prophet of God and says when when when
[1:21:25] David was anointed the Spirit of God was
[1:21:27] with him from that day on and so here
[1:21:29] was one that God was in and and and
[1:21:32] Goliath boasts fell on the wrong is that
[1:21:34] day I mean it fell on a lot of ears for
[1:21:37] forty days but then there was another
[1:21:38] set of ears that that that that that
[1:21:40] heard that boast and it's amazing
[1:21:42] because when the devil comes and
[1:21:44] challenges there's something that rises
[1:21:45] up and God's children I mean that's and
[1:21:48] God says I accept the challenge I accept
[1:21:50] your challenge devil every said David
[1:21:53] wasn't saying all what I said I'll go
[1:21:55] find him it's just one you guys can you
[1:21:57] big you got armor you know come on well
[1:21:59] if you won't do it I'll do the job you
[1:22:02] know and and and I think there's
[1:22:03] something in the Bride of Christ so an
[1:22:05] else won't do it although I'll take the
[1:22:08] devil's challenge this word is true
[1:22:09] Jesus Christ is alive I mean sorry so
[1:22:12] here was now Goliath and sure he
[1:22:16] disdained David cuz he is but a youth
[1:22:17] but I think maybe the devil said I've
[1:22:20] seen this look before
[1:22:21] it wasn't an 80 year old man now it's
[1:22:24] enough no 13 or whatever your old boy
[1:22:27] I've seen this look before and then
[1:22:31] David begins to prophesy I'm gonna cut
[1:22:34] your head off and all of these ones as
[1:22:36] well
[1:22:36] he picks up five stones of the brook
[1:22:39] because because Goliath had brothers
[1:22:42] and he just realized well if I gotta
[1:22:43] kill them all well I guess we got 24
[1:22:45] hours in a day with miles get it done
[1:22:47] Holliday it should be the same thing
[1:22:48] with you and I just kill one devil at a
[1:22:51] time you say I've got a lot of problems
[1:22:53] in my life just take one at a time I've
[1:22:57] got a pride problem kill that one I've
[1:22:59] got a last problem then kill that one
[1:23:01] I've ever stop and spurt
[1:23:03] kill that one I mean I've got this
[1:23:05] pornographic demon kill that one
[1:23:07] I've got whatever it is just that one
[1:23:09] and then that one then that one well you
[1:23:11] say I've got a big to-do list well how
[1:23:13] do you do it to-do list the first one
[1:23:15] and you do the next thing on the list
[1:23:16] you do next thing so just kill them one
[1:23:18] at a time and many times you say well
[1:23:22] how do I overcome this just do the
[1:23:23] opposite you know it's like a you know a
[1:23:27] cancer feeds off your body and then you
[1:23:31] know the best way well okay I'm not a
[1:23:33] doctor but you know how do you kill a
[1:23:34] cancer the one way to kill a cancer is
[1:23:38] you actually stop it from being able to
[1:23:40] feed so if your body dries up and
[1:23:43] there's no life and anymore and there's
[1:23:44] nothing for the cancer to feed on what
[1:23:46] happens the cancer it dies if you kill
[1:23:49] the if it can't feed it all die starve
[1:23:53] the devil that's what I'm getting to
[1:23:57] just just starve the thing
[1:23:58] maybe he'll push your order no no no no
[1:24:02] no you're gonna stop if you're gonna if
[1:24:05] you're gonna sit here and try to get me
[1:24:06] to do those things you're gonna starve
[1:24:07] to death because that thing member he
[1:24:10] puts a desire to have for certain things
[1:24:12] that is actually a spurt feeding on it
[1:24:14] you take an alcoholic you take a smoke
[1:24:16] you take anything there's such a desire
[1:24:18] because there's a spurt actually feeding
[1:24:20] on that thing so what do you do starve
[1:24:23] the thing remember draw nigh to God
[1:24:26] resist the devil resist the devil draw
[1:24:29] nigh to God and He shall flee from you
[1:24:32] it's very simple you draw nigh to God
[1:24:35] and resist the devil remember it's not
[1:24:38] the it's not the power of positive
[1:24:40] thinking you've got to draw nigh to God
[1:24:42] then resist the devil and he shall flee
[1:24:47] hallelujah amen to this there's David he
[1:24:51] prophesies I'm going to take your head
[1:24:52] off I'm gonna kill all these ones if I
[1:24:54] have to remember
[1:24:55] came on his ground remember there's
[1:24:58] something about God God is a jealous God
[1:25:00] our God is a jealous God my he doesn't
[1:25:04] want to share us with no spirit nothing
[1:25:06] of the world he doesn't want us to be
[1:25:08] you know he doesn't want to be the
[1:25:10] weekends with this guy and then him the
[1:25:12] rest of the week you know that's not how
[1:25:13] God works he's a jealous God so when
[1:25:17] when the devil lays a finger on God's
[1:25:19] property then the devil's got Jesus
[1:25:22] Christ on his hands hallelujah brother
[1:25:25] Brian was saying deep calls to deep the
[1:25:26] other deal will be to watch out I mean
[1:25:28] cuz if he ever touches one of God's
[1:25:30] children then he's got Jesus Christ on
[1:25:31] his hands ha see see you've got a you
[1:25:34] recognize a mean it's not you fighting
[1:25:36] the battle it's not you just alone and
[1:25:39] you've got to work out how to know God
[1:25:40] sees and God remembers hello yeah he
[1:25:44] doesn't remember a thing cuz they're
[1:25:46] under the blood of Jesus Christ but
[1:25:47] there's no blood for the devil there's
[1:25:49] no redemption for him there's no
[1:25:51] forgiveness of sin I mean the blood of
[1:25:53] Jesus Christ wasn't shared for Satan
[1:25:56] hallelujah so but God has a long memory
[1:26:00] hallelujah and it's accurate
[1:26:02] it doesn't morph inform as time goes by
[1:26:05] you know many times we as we get older
[1:26:08] we we we think about our childhood and
[1:26:10] we want to kind of go back and live in
[1:26:12] that little childhood but many times
[1:26:14] it's actually a composite of all these
[1:26:17] nice memories put together in one and we
[1:26:19] and we seem to remember that's exactly
[1:26:21] how it was but in reality that's wasn't
[1:26:24] how it was maybe I'm just talking about
[1:26:28] me but you know you know you think about
[1:26:30] your child I wish I could go there and
[1:26:32] have this and but then also you're only
[1:26:34] thinking about it as a child so you
[1:26:36] don't know the full picture of maybe the
[1:26:38] struggles of your parents what's going
[1:26:39] on and the family whatever you don't see
[1:26:41] that because you just see what you're
[1:26:42] seeing and you want to go back to that
[1:26:44] that way and it's actually a whole bunch
[1:26:46] of memories been merged into one you
[1:26:49] know God's memory ain't like that
[1:26:51] God's memory is as accurate exactly how
[1:26:56] it was you know so so God has a long
[1:26:59] memory and he remembers what the devil
[1:27:01] did he's gonna take him to account
[1:27:04] amen so now David was David was he
[1:27:09] killed Goliath hallelujah and then all
[1:27:14] the way down through the devil said I've
[1:27:17] seen this look before and then finally
[1:27:19] there came 400 years of silence between
[1:27:22] Malachi and Matthew and now there was a
[1:27:25] prophet in the land whose name was John
[1:27:27] and the devil looked at this man and he
[1:27:33] wasn't like all the other religious
[1:27:34] fellows in the world
[1:27:35] he was rugged he was a yo you you know
[1:27:38] here's one who lived there in the
[1:27:40] wilderness honey and locusts was his
[1:27:42] meat but there was a look in his eyes
[1:27:45] and he'll begin to speak a word and had
[1:27:47] power and it began to draw people and
[1:27:50] the devil said you know I've seen this
[1:27:52] look before but then the one that he has
[1:27:54] come to point out came our Lord Jesus
[1:27:57] came down in the and the word met the
[1:28:00] prophet in the water and then here comes
[1:28:03] here comes the word comes and meets the
[1:28:05] prophet in the water and then Jesus is
[1:28:08] baptized by John comes out of the water
[1:28:10] the Spirit of God descends upon him like
[1:28:11] a dove and then the devil and then and
[1:28:15] in the spirit of God leads Jesus into
[1:28:16] the wilderness to be tempted the devil
[1:28:19] comes and he begins to look at him face
[1:28:21] to face he begins to have a conversation
[1:28:23] with him and no doubt he looked at those
[1:28:26] eyes remember he saw him part down
[1:28:29] through the prophets but now he was the
[1:28:31] fullness here was that same one that
[1:28:33] cast him out of heaven was now standing
[1:28:35] in flesh and was looking at his enemy
[1:28:38] imagine that and he says if thou be the
[1:28:42] Son of God and then he had in his mind
[1:28:45] I've got to destroy this one I've got to
[1:28:47] destroy this one and he couldn't
[1:28:50] actually do it until the Lord said now
[1:28:52] it's my time I know man take my life
[1:28:55] from me I lay it down and if I lay it
[1:28:57] down I'll pick it back up again how this
[1:29:00] is the devil see now I'm gonna destroy
[1:29:01] this thing I'm gonna I'm gonna destroy
[1:29:03] this one and he thought he had him he
[1:29:07] thought he had him and then no doubt
[1:29:09] finally he's dead on the cross the devil
[1:29:11] now goes back into hell
[1:29:12] maybe sits on his lazy boy chair
[1:29:14] thinking finally I can rest
[1:29:18] my tormentor is dead Oh No
[1:29:21] you know where I'm going we just enjoy
[1:29:23] it hallelu ain't pen it so here's so so
[1:29:27] here he is
[1:29:28] he thinks he's finally won he thought he
[1:29:30] had him with Abel thought he had him
[1:29:31] with Moses thought he had him with
[1:29:32] Elijah all the way down through and then
[1:29:35] finally the hell door of Hell gets
[1:29:38] busted open and that one that came down
[1:29:41] and flesh now came down into hell
[1:29:43] he wasn't Carson to hell he wasn't
[1:29:45] thrown there he came down and the devil

[1:29:50] I've got you I thought I had you as a
[1:29:52] well thought I had you with the prophecy

[1:29:59] cross I am the red I am the Virgin born

[1:30:10] the keys he held it in the grave
[1:30:12] hallelujah he rips them off a site and
[1:30:14] then ascends up hallelujah and then
[1:30:18] finally ha ha ha our Lord Jesus goes
[1:30:21] into another place where the people are
[1:30:23] being tormented there waiting as my
[1:30:25] girls called the waiting room that's a
[1:30:27] good waiting room to be in and then it
[1:30:29] all comes open and they've been having
[1:30:31] fellowship Abraham said I saw this look
[1:30:34] and a man called Melchizedek and then
[1:30:37] and then he became a play man on the
[1:30:39] plains of Mamre told us that we could
[1:30:41] have the promised son I saw a look and
[1:30:43] then and then Isaac said yes I saw you
[1:30:45] know I saw that same kind of look and
[1:30:47] then J and then Jacob said I wrestled
[1:30:49] with a man and he had that same kind of
[1:30:52] look that you're describing Abraham I
[1:30:53] mean he changed my walk I may change you
[1:30:56] from a trauma from a supplanted to a
[1:30:57] prince with God and in Moses say yeah I
[1:31:00] saw that look too I mean as a as a voice
[1:31:03] out of a burning bush and different
[1:31:04] things and you know they and then Joshua
[1:31:06] said I know exactly who you're talking
[1:31:08] about
[1:31:09] I saw him as the captain of the host of
[1:31:10] law with a soldier I saw that look at
[1:31:12] his face in the more than a man to me
[1:31:14] it's such a hitter face it looked like
[1:31:16] one word could turn the world upside
[1:31:18] down and then and then one look just
[1:31:20] commanded love and respect and
[1:31:21] hallelujah
[1:31:24] I mean and then Daniel will say yes I
[1:31:26] saw him to a man Ezekiel said yes it's a
[1:31:30] well within the will hallelujah all the
[1:31:33] way down through and then John would say
[1:31:34] i baptize hallelujah he became flesh I
[1:31:39] saw that look
[1:31:40] and then the thief on the cross made me
[1:31:42] here's the last one I saw that look - he
[1:31:46] had a crown of thorns on his head blood
[1:31:47] pouring out of himself how live but he
[1:31:50] looked at me and I looked in there I've
[1:31:51] never seen eyes like that before I tell
[1:31:54] you when you look into the eyes of the
[1:31:55] Lord Jesus Christ you'll see that's a
[1:31:56] different kind of look hallelujah and
[1:31:59] then the door comes open and then our
[1:32:01] Lord Jesus steps into paradise and then
[1:32:04] they look at him saying we've seen this
[1:32:06] look before hallelujah and here he is

[1:34:46] right quick we find out here and a
[1:34:48] little later on the on in the scriptures
[1:34:50] I'm thinking over here in another
[1:34:52] chapter and he didn't want to give it up
[1:34:54] right away but he he had to fight over
[1:34:57] it but finally when he was brought to a
[1:34:59] showdown he's cast into the lake of fire
[1:35:01] that's right Jesus the name Jesus and
[1:35:04] the gospel has four titles of son do you
[1:35:06] know that Jesus has four titles of son
[1:35:09] and the Gospels one is the son of David
[1:35:11] one of them as the son of Abraham
[1:35:12] another the Son of Man and other the Son
[1:35:14] of God now watch when our kinsman
[1:35:16] redeemer became Jesus Christ he become
[1:35:19] the son of David which is an heir to the
[1:35:21] throne glory he aired the throne by
[1:35:23] being a son of David God back there that
[1:35:28] he said God told back there that he
[1:35:30] would never leave David never leave
[1:35:32] David without a seed and Christ is the
[1:35:34] son of David and he became our kinsman
[1:35:36] redeemer and waiting getting a place
[1:35:38] ready where he can reign with us as the
[1:35:40] son of David he's yet to the throne as
[1:35:42] the son of Abraham he's our heir to the
[1:35:45] rural ground amen is that right he's a
[1:35:47] niche of the royal great aim in
[1:35:48] Palestine and all that's in her Abraham
[1:35:50] seat he was a son of Abraham and as a
[1:35:53] son of man what the son of man what did
[1:35:56] man lose he lost the earth so as the son
[1:35:59] of
[1:35:59] he is heir to everything in the earth
[1:36:01] all this he's got and has and has to
[1:36:04] give it back to us then he's returning
[1:36:07] back I mean then as the son of God here
[1:36:10] and here it's all things as a son of
[1:36:11] David he's heir to the throne and son of
[1:36:14] Abraham he's heir to the Royal grant as
[1:36:16] son of man he's heir to the earth as son
[1:36:18] of God he's heir to all things in heaven
[1:36:20] and earth oh my that's our redeemer our
[1:36:22] kinsman redeemer now notice oh this does
[1:36:25] me so good this is where I really get
[1:36:27] feeding now let your hearts loose to God
[1:36:29] just a few minutes listen to the Satan
[1:36:31] as a squatter he don't legally own this
[1:36:34] he said two thousand years to fuss
[1:36:36] whether he owns it or somebody else owns
[1:36:38] it but Christ came as the kinsman
[1:36:40] redeemer and redeemed it back to us but
[1:36:43] Satan possesses it do you know after a
[1:36:45] while this great fights over he'll be
[1:36:47] cast into the lake of fire see he'll be
[1:36:49] done away with and all them who worships
[1:36:51] with him but the ears of salvation will
[1:36:54] come with Christ now he's a squatter now
[1:36:56] remember in the Old Testament if a man
[1:36:58] lost his inheritance and a squatter came
[1:37:00] on his land he could not hold it any
[1:37:02] longer for annihilation from the owner
[1:37:05] until 50 years of Jubilee after 50 years
[1:37:10] the years of Jubilee came by and the
[1:37:11] year of Jubilee when the year of Jubilee
[1:37:13] came along when everything went back to
[1:37:15] its original beginning again all the
[1:37:17] slaves they went back to the original
[1:37:19] beginning if a man was hoeing in the
[1:37:21] field and the trumpet sounded and he
[1:37:23] heard he had throw down the hoe and so
[1:37:25] no more slave I go back home to my
[1:37:28] family everything was given back if a
[1:37:30] squatter was on the ground he had to get
[1:37:32] off the ground that's all he had to get
[1:37:34] off the ground because why the legal
[1:37:36] owner was coming back he had to give
[1:37:38] away hallelujah one of these days the
[1:37:41] kingdoms of this world will fall and the
[1:37:43] legal owners will come in of in one of
[1:37:45] these days amen now there was a time
[1:37:48] this is really where I wanted to get to
[1:37:49] now there was a time when it was a
[1:37:52] dispute from the fortieth day from the
[1:37:55] beginning of the first day of the
[1:37:57] cleansing of the sanctuary or Christ
[1:37:58] went to Calvary there was 40 days into
[1:38:01] the Ascension it was in debate where the
[1:38:04] Satan's group would take it and say that
[1:38:06] he did not raise from the dead they
[1:38:08] begin to start out a proclamation along
[1:38:10] there saying said the
[1:38:12] apples come install his body by night
[1:38:14] you've read the Bible and they said that
[1:38:16] his people come and stole him by night
[1:38:18] and paid the soldiers money to say that
[1:38:20] but it was in question then everybody
[1:38:23] was in question well really maybe it
[1:38:26] does belong to the organization and the
[1:38:28] whole thing belongs to it but on the
[1:38:29] 50th day was the day of Pentecost and
[1:38:32] the legal owner came down hallelujah and
[1:38:35] showed it was no organization it was a
[1:38:38] filling of the Holy Ghost earnest money
[1:38:41] to his church that it would not be
[1:38:42] controlled by organizations and so forth
[1:38:45] it would be the earnest money of the
[1:38:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost with power and
[1:38:48] the love of God amen doesn't that just
[1:38:51] do something to you paulius on the day
[1:38:54] of Pentecost remember the devil thought
[1:38:55] finally it's done my torment is gone and
[1:38:59] there was fifty days now of a dispute
[1:39:02] going on but then he said the legal
[1:39:05] owner came down the Lord Himself came
[1:39:06] down into the upper room and now it was
[1:39:09] not just God behind one one man so so it
[1:39:13] wasn't just one man having the look now
[1:39:14] 120 had that same look I mean cuz the
[1:39:17] Holy Ghost came and dwelt in then and
[1:39:19] now the devil looked at these ones
[1:39:20] coming out staring like drunk people
[1:39:22] rejoicing shouting hallelujah the words
[1:39:24] being fulfilled glory amen
[1:39:26] and he looked at them and says now we
[1:39:28] really got trouble this thing spreading
[1:39:30] this thing sprinting talk about a
[1:39:32] pandemic hallelujah everyone should get
[1:39:34] sick with this thing hallelujah Amen see
[1:39:37] you know I know six the wrong word but
[1:39:39] you know what I mean but begin to spread
[1:39:41] now the Devils are now really got
[1:39:42] trouble and it spread from 120 I think
[1:39:45] 3,000 and 5,000 in then he tried to
[1:39:48] persecute it they're gonna try to throw
[1:39:49] him in jail this is I'm gonna rid the
[1:39:51] world of this thing and it just spread
[1:39:53] like fire hallelujah amen because the
[1:39:55] disciples were led by the Holy Ghost
[1:39:57] they sold everything that they had gave
[1:39:58] it to the church because when when the
[1:40:01] when the time came Bheema God always
[1:40:03] repairs his children before time what's
[1:40:07] what has been happening all this time
[1:40:08] God's preparing us Ilia so so he
[1:40:11] prepared the church that they had no
[1:40:13] roots and Jerusalem anymore that when
[1:40:15] persecution came and they had to leave
[1:40:17] they could just leave and they took the
[1:40:19] wood with them and then it began to
[1:40:22] spread and it began to spread
[1:40:25] and then and then the devil anointed a
[1:40:27] man called Saul of Tarsus and he was
[1:40:29] determined I'm going to destroy the
[1:40:31] singing you know he had his ambition but
[1:40:33] God has his ambition I mean you remember
[1:40:35] people may be fighting mice you and they
[1:40:37] fascinate turn against it but God's got
[1:40:39] his ambition hallelujah and this one was
[1:40:41] determined I'm going to throw them in
[1:40:42] prison go do whatever but then he met
[1:40:44] that same God on the road to Damascus
[1:40:46] and I believe his countenance would have
[1:40:48] changed hallelujah lujah and then the
[1:40:51] devil said oh I've seen this look before
[1:40:53] so he tried to throw him in prison tried
[1:40:55] to drown him tried to do all kinds of
[1:40:56] things against Paul couldn't stop it
[1:40:58] just like God can't stop I mean the
[1:41:00] devil can't stop you devil couldn't stop
[1:41:03] Paul he can't stop you he says I've been
[1:41:06] distressed I've been beaten up in
[1:41:07] shipwrecked I've been all these bad you
[1:41:09] know thrown in prison whatever more let
[1:41:11] it stop him didn't stop him same thing
[1:41:14] with you and I I just want to give you a
[1:41:15] bit of encouragement this morning
[1:41:17] doesn't matter what you may be facing
[1:41:18] the devil can't stop you you'll fulfill
[1:41:20] the word in your life hallelujah and
[1:41:25] then so the devil got crafty if we can't
[1:41:28] beat them join them you know that saying
[1:41:32] can't beat them join them
[1:41:33] so he brought in people and then you
[1:41:35] know you read about X 15 it says now the
[1:41:37] Pharisees who believes in Jesus see if
[1:41:41] people have to become Jews before they
[1:41:43] became can become Christians I'll say
[1:41:45] pretty bluntly they didn't actually
[1:41:46] become Christians they were still
[1:41:48] Pharisees they hadn't been converted
[1:41:50] they hadn't been changed because they
[1:41:52] tried to bring their old life in with
[1:41:53] them so why well is that the devil
[1:41:57] saying well I can't beat him so I'll
[1:41:58] join them sorry so I brought these
[1:41:59] people in brought what confusion false
[1:42:01] doctrine things in to try and destroy
[1:42:03] the life and that's what happens the
[1:42:05] devil the devil wants to try and stop
[1:42:07] the moving of the Holy Ghost he wants to
[1:42:09] stop the power of the gospel manifesting
[1:42:11] that's what he wants to do he doesn't
[1:42:13] mind if we come to church become formal
[1:42:14] maybe but your pomp and ceremony
[1:42:16] whatever it may be and quiet and yeah
[1:42:19] but he doesn't mind that but what he
[1:42:21] minds is when God fills a person and
[1:42:23] then God uses that person to shake the
[1:42:25] world hallelujah
[1:42:27] killer yellow the Prophet said the day
[1:42:29] of Pentecost that it wouldn't stir too
[1:42:32] much but when Peter and John went by the
[1:42:34] gate of gate called beautiful and
[1:42:36] there's that crippled man they said
[1:42:37] silver and gold we have none
[1:42:39] as we have give under the name of Jesus
[1:42:40] Christ rise up and walk
[1:42:42] then he really rolled out of his lazy
[1:42:44] boy and then that's when the persecution
[1:42:45] began to strike why because it was God
[1:42:48] in action and the people and that's what
[1:42:50] the devil wants to stop is actually God
[1:42:52] in action in our lives that's why he
[1:42:54] brings stressful atmospheres and trouble
[1:42:56] in the home and you know turmoil
[1:42:58] different things he's trying to stop God
[1:42:59] manifesting you got to be mindful what's
[1:43:02] going on hallelujah
[1:43:05] so the devil said can't beat them join
[1:43:08] them so then now finally the church fell
[1:43:10] they thought in the Dark Ages
[1:43:12] I've got it it's all sealed away can't
[1:43:17] happen
[1:43:18] I've won I know you know the church was
[1:43:21] prophesied it had to go that way it was
[1:43:24] prophesied that it had to God I'm going
[1:43:26] to the ground had be a death a barrel in
[1:43:28] a resurrection I mean so the devil flaw
[1:43:31] finally I've got it but then God begin
[1:43:34] to move and there are people like John
[1:43:36] Wycliffe well before Luther well before
[1:43:39] even HUS oh no just before house
[1:43:41] actually you know actually even before
[1:43:43] that there was Columbo we know who
[1:43:44] Columbus church age messenger he founded
[1:43:47] a Bible School there and one of the
[1:43:49] islands of Northwest Scotland and Bible
[1:43:52] historians say for the next 900 years
[1:43:54] the most of the evangelical mission work
[1:43:57] in Europe came out of their Bible School
[1:43:59] God knows how to prepare things you know
[1:44:02] we think Oh how's it going to happen our
[1:44:03] God knows how to prepare things
[1:44:05] hallelujah so so and then and then they
[1:44:08] influence John Wycliffe and John
[1:44:09] Wycliffe just had a real simple burden
[1:44:11] the people should be able to read the
[1:44:13] Bible in their own language if Y should
[1:44:15] be in Latin we're not letting people
[1:44:17] we're English people
[1:44:18] however they spoken those days is
[1:44:20] different to the English now but you
[1:44:21] know it a burden maybe going to
[1:44:23] translate the Scriptures because he was
[1:44:25] so burdened by the ignorance of people
[1:44:29] you know meaning you know see so he had
[1:44:32] a burden and then and then that happened
[1:44:35] and endow John Wycliff influence his
[1:44:38] teachings went to Bohemia and they
[1:44:40] influenced John HUS and and John HUS he
[1:44:43] basically had the same revelation that
[1:44:45] Luther had but a hundred years before
[1:44:46] and because remember there's the death
[1:44:49] of Baral in a resurrection and the devil
[1:44:52] said no no no
[1:44:52] it's gonna stay in the ground and God
[1:44:55] says oh no no no no no no read the end
[1:44:57] of the book boy
[1:44:58] it's got to come forth he says no no no
[1:45:00] it's gonna stay no no no no God says no
[1:45:02] that's got to come forth hallelujah
[1:45:04] so so so John has had a burden and and
[1:45:08] it was even a you know amazing change
[1:45:10] there where actually the congregation
[1:45:12] would sing as opposed to acquire and he
[1:45:15] believed the just shall be lived by
[1:45:16] faith a thing is very close to what
[1:45:17] Luther believed and now the devil said
[1:45:20] I've seen this look before it was only
[1:45:22] impartial for me see I've seen this look
[1:45:23] before and he had him burnt at the stake
[1:45:25] but John Huss said in a hundred years a
[1:45:27] man will raise up with these same
[1:45:28] teachings you'll not be able to stop him
[1:45:29] hundred years later Luther now this
[1:45:32] thesis on the on the wooden burg Church
[1:45:34] just or wherever it was the Reformation
[1:45:36] was on and then now the devil said well
[1:45:39] if I can't beat him I'll join him but
[1:45:42] you can't stop the life of God but now
[1:45:46] the devil it's been vexing him ever
[1:45:48] since I must stop these people I must
[1:45:51] stop the life of God and then finally
[1:45:54] when finally when it was all scrupled up
[1:45:57] there's a man came in this day Elijah
[1:46:01] the Prophet a man with the spirit of
[1:46:03] Elijah and God made him in the water sit
[1:46:06] as John the Baptist fall on the first
[1:46:07] come across your message will fall on
[1:46:08] the second coming holy what happened God
[1:46:11] came down he what he didn't fall he
[1:46:14] wasn't cast down he came down why
[1:46:17] because now he's gonna gather his bride
[1:46:19] Holly and now he's gonna gather his
[1:46:21] bride and what he saw remember this
[1:46:24] message restores us back to the original
[1:46:26] Bible faith it doesn't give us another
[1:46:28] Bible this is the message this is the
[1:46:32] message right this is the message I've
[1:46:34] preached when I was in the face went up
[1:46:35] to Papua New Guinea I preached I never
[1:46:37] mentioned brother Branham I mentioned
[1:46:39] that I just preached the scripture and
[1:46:40] now a psalm a saying how where'd you get
[1:46:44] this wrong because they could see it in
[1:46:45] the scriptures they saw we're at the end
[1:46:47] time they saw you know the conditions
[1:46:50] where we are they saw everything because
[1:46:51] I just showed it out of the scripture
[1:46:53] because the message just just shows us
[1:46:55] the Bible it's not as something else
[1:46:56] remember we have we are restored back
[1:46:59] the original faith in the father's
[1:47:01] reginal Pentecostal father's before the
[1:47:04] ephesian church ever started their age
[1:47:06] well we've been restored before they
[1:47:07] foul hallelujah so so the devil's you
[1:47:10] know he begins to see now God comes down
[1:47:13] veils himself and a man brother Bram
[1:47:16] says I'm just a man I'm full of failures
[1:47:18] I make mistakes I'm bad with saying
[1:47:20] saying crowd sizes you know he tells us
[1:47:22] all those things right right on my man
[1:47:26] my words are foul his word doesn't fail
[1:47:27] be seized of I've told you the truth let
[1:47:29] him come and prove it and then every
[1:47:31] demon didn't matter what affliction it
[1:47:33] was it was cast out I meant cancer by
[1:47:38] the multitude whatever it was people
[1:47:40] crippled up people demon-possessed out
[1:47:42] of their mind
[1:47:43] they didn't stay that way they didn't
[1:47:45] stay that way why cuz the Conqueror in
[1:47:47] heaven had now come down into the end
[1:47:49] time and it was now manifesting his
[1:47:51] victory at Calvary amen in this age
[1:47:54] hallelujah
[1:47:55] Holly and now the devil's has now really
[1:47:57] got trouble because you know what God
[1:47:59] does you know the Bible says in
[1:48:01] Corinthians chapter 11 that the woman is
[1:48:04] the glory of the man the man is not the
[1:48:07] glory of the woman the woman is the
[1:48:08] glory of the man so the woman is
[1:48:10] actually the man's glory so now the Lord
[1:48:13] just takes the bride Satan this is my
[1:48:16] glory this is what I've done God not
[1:48:20] ashamed of you he's proud of you he's
[1:48:23] proud of you her little old me
[1:48:25] absolutely little old you and he takes
[1:48:28] you up it says Satan this is what my
[1:48:29] blood does this is what was prophesied
[1:48:32] what I told you I would do these are the
[1:48:34] living evidence these people are the
[1:48:36] living evidence of what I said I'd do is
[1:48:38] happening and there are lives hallelujah
[1:48:42] hallelujah and then and now the devil
[1:48:44] says I've seen that look before and then
[1:48:47] when you meet Jesus Christ for yourself
[1:48:48] there's a change no one needs to tell
[1:48:50] you you know something happened you were
[1:48:52] there I mean you were there when it
[1:48:53] happened when the word became a living
[1:48:55] reality I mean when you seen I remember
[1:48:57] I remember when I read this book Holly
[1:49:00] and I heard about a kinsman sipping
[1:49:01] forth loosing the seals and it became it
[1:49:04] wasn't a doctor I said let's least if
[1:49:06] out of eternity amen take my life open
[1:49:09] my life up say this is who you're meant
[1:49:11] to be Holly you're not made to be this
[1:49:13] man from New Zealand you're from heaven
[1:49:15] hello more than adoption experience the
[1:49:19] book coming open as they sadly some
[1:49:22] people say the book still closed well
[1:49:23] maybe to them it is but to me it's not
[1:49:25] why cuz the lamb came forth to me okay
[1:49:29] just like Calvary is not a story it's a
[1:49:31] reality I mean you're there when he died
[1:49:33] he saw his blood pour out Holly saw your
[1:49:36] atonement being made hallelujah amen
[1:49:40] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God why
[1:49:44] cause you're bad happened to you no one
[1:49:46] else can tell you had the experience you
[1:49:49] know that your sins are washed away that
[1:49:51] burden of sin was taking all your guilt
[1:49:52] and your shame everything was carried
[1:49:54] away that day why cuz you were there
[1:49:57] huddled here and now the devil says now
[1:50:00] I've got trouble but I'll say this
[1:50:01] there's no more death burial
[1:50:03] resurrection
[1:50:04] it's just resurrection now this is a
[1:50:06] resurrection season there's no death
[1:50:08] barrel I mean the the devil can't beat
[1:50:11] us and he can't join us Jesus says I've
[1:50:15] no part in him he has no part of me we
[1:50:17] have to come that realization devil you
[1:50:18] have no part of me I have no part of you
[1:50:20] there's not there's no partnership
[1:50:22] there's nothing we have nothing
[1:50:24] there's no mutual meeting agreement
[1:50:26] between us nothing here is no part of me
[1:50:29] I have no part in him there's actually
[1:50:31] once God has come down and cut any kind
[1:50:33] of separation anytime between Gardens I
[1:50:37] mean I mean between man and Satan you
[1:50:39] just got to realize that now I'm we say
[1:50:42] but I get sick that's irrelevant the
[1:50:45] body needs changing and we go boy I tell
[1:50:48] you what holy hallelujah amen if

[1:51:00] free is gonna change my body if his word
[1:51:02] became real to me he's gonna change my
[1:51:04] body hallelujah hallelujah amen
[1:51:10] so now there's no death bear is real
[1:51:12] it's just resurrection so the devil says
[1:51:14] now I really have trouble cuz he can't
[1:51:17] stop you he can't stop you in the name
[1:51:20] of Jesus Christ he can't he'll try put
[1:51:22] doubts and put hurts and try mickey
[1:51:24] shell up yet i'll make you just kind of
[1:51:27] operate as this little kind of believe

[1:51:35] one another love love people in the
[1:51:37] world hallelujah this should be such a

[1:51:50] morning hell I know how much your back

[1:52:48] there's just nothing you know one devil
[1:52:51] comes against you he falls at your feet

[1:53:44] hallelujah and then our bodies has
[1:53:47] changed and the devil thinks finally I'm
[1:53:50] glad those people are gone finally those
[1:53:53] ones that talked out all around the
[1:53:55] world they are tormenting me actually
[1:53:56] holding my power back

[1:54:16] has no doubt if you think the devil's
[1:54:17] off my case no gods on his case all the
[1:54:18] time hallelujah then the two prophets
[1:54:21] come to Israel and they and they plagued
[1:54:23] the world they do whatever they're
[1:54:24] called to do and then I'll cut out a few
[1:54:29] things
[1:54:29] then finally we come to the scene of us
[1:54:32] Isaiah chapter 14 and the prophecy of
[1:54:37] you know he the devil said I will ascend
[1:54:39] I'll be like the Most High but you'll be
[1:54:41] cut down to the sides of the pit and
[1:54:43] then there'll be a time it sees in there
[1:54:45] that they that see thee shall narrow you
[1:54:47] look upon me and say is this the man is
[1:54:50] it really this guy this guy is this the
[1:54:53] mender of weakest Nations Isaiah 14 and
[1:54:56] then so this is just me he'll be there
[1:54:58] will a look at him he sees every single
[1:55:02] believer who's had that look will be
[1:55:05] looking at him and then he's cast into
[1:55:10] the lake of fire and the last thing he
[1:55:12] sees is that look and he's toast
[1:55:18] hallelujah and that joy of the devil
[1:55:21] being cast out you know have a meeting
[1:55:23] and God comes down and you get free to
[1:55:24] something hallelujah I mean we're gonna
