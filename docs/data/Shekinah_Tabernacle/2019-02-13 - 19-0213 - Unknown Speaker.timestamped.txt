[25:22] of the day worships not about projectors
[25:25] it's about the revelation of Jesus

[25:30] to Ezekiel chapter 28 and we're gonna go
[25:34] then we going to go second Corinthians
[25:35] chapter 4 see kill 28 verses 12 to 19 so
[25:49] once well tonight Amen Son of Man take
[25:54] up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus
[25:56] say unto Him thus saith the Lord God
[25:59] they'll seal us up the sum full of
[26:02] wisdom and perfect in beauty thou has
[26:04] been an Eden the garden of God every
[26:06] precious stone was thy covering the
[26:08] Sardis the Topaz and the diamond the
[26:10] barrel the onks the Jasper the sapphire
[26:13] emerald and the carbuncle and gold the
[26:15] workmanship of thy temperance and of our
[26:17] pipes was prepared in thee in the day
[26:19] that thou was created
[26:21] thou art the anointed cherub that
[26:22] covereth and I have set thee so there
[26:25] was upon the holy mountain of God thou
[26:27] has walked up and down in the midst of
[26:29] the stones of fire that was perfect in
[26:31] my ways from the day that that was
[26:33] created till iniquity was found in thee
[26:35] by the multitude of my merchandise have
[26:38] filled the mitts of thee with violence
[26:40] and now has sinned therefore I will cast
[26:42] thee as profane out of the mountain of
[26:44] God and I'll destroy the Oh cover ensure
[26:48] from the midst of the stones of fire thy
[26:50] heart was lifted up because of thy
[26:52] Beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by
[26:55] reason of our brightness
[26:57] I will cast see to the ground
[26:58] or lady before Kings and that they may
[27:01] behold thee thou has defiled by
[27:04] sanctuaries by the multitude of thy
[27:05] iniquities by the iniquity of thy
[27:07] traffic therefore will I bring forth a
[27:09] fire from the midst of thee it shall
[27:11] devour thee and I'll bring thee to the
[27:14] ashes I say I'll bring me to ashes upon
[27:17] the earth and the sight of all the end
[27:18] of behold be all they that know the
[27:22] among the people shall be astonished at
[27:24] thee thou shalt be a terror and never
[27:27] shall there be any more hallelujah so I
[27:35] mean this go to 2nd Corinthians chapter
[27:37] 4 so the devil has an expiry date that
[27:41] is that that is the sum of that last
[27:43] scripture as he shall be no more and
[27:46] when he is no more we shall be
[27:49] hallelujah hallelujah 2nd Corinthians
[27:53] chapter 4 and verse 6 now one day I want
[27:56] you to notice the very it's very very
[27:59] contrary scriptures one as he was made
[28:01] perfect there's beauty in all these
[28:03] things but now notice the Apostle Paul
[28:05] and speaking of of the journey that that
[28:07] he he goes through and and every
[28:10] believer here so second Corinthians four
[28:12] and let's read from verse six and it
[28:15] says here for God who commanded the
[28:18] light to shine out of darkness has
[28:20] shined in our hearts to give the light
[28:22] of the knowledge of the glory of God in
[28:24] the face of Jesus Christ but we have
[28:26] this treasure in earthen vessels that
[28:28] the excellency of the power may be of
[28:30] God and not of us we are troubled on
[28:32] every side yet not distressed we are
[28:34] perplexed but not in despair persecuted
[28:36] but not forsaken cast down but not
[28:39] destroyed always bearing about in the
[28:41] body the dying of the Lord Jesus that
[28:43] the life also of Jesus might be made
[28:45] manifest in our body for we which live
[28:47] are alway delivered unto death for Jesus
[28:50] sake that the life also of Jesus might
[28:52] be made manifest in our mortal flesh so
[28:55] then death worketh enough us but life
[28:58] and you we have received the same spirit
[29:01] of faith according and as it is written
[29:03] I have believed I believed and therefore
[29:05] have I spoken we also believe and
[29:08] therefore speak knowing that he which
[29:10] raised up the Lord Jesus shall
[29:12] raise up us also by Jesus and shall
[29:14] present us with you for all things are
[29:17] for your sakes that the abundant grace
[29:19] might through the Thanksgiving of many
[29:22] read down to the glory of God
[29:25] for which cause we faint not but though
[29:28] our outward man perish yet the inward
[29:30] man is renewed day by day
[29:32] for our light affliction which is but
[29:35] for a moment worketh for us a far more
[29:40] exceeding and eternal weight of glory
[29:42] while we look not at the things which
[29:45] are seen but at the things which are not
[29:47] seen for the things which are seen are
[29:50] temporal but the things which are not
[29:52] seen are eternal hallelujah and we're
[29:55] just gonna read one more verse and and
[29:57] flipy in chapter 4 and we're gonna read
[30:03] verse 19 just as a bit of a maybe a bit
[30:07] of a context oh I'm gonna take this a
[30:08] little bit of a different way but
[30:09] Philippians 4:19
[30:11] and the Apostle Paul he says but my God
[30:15] shall supply all your need according to
[30:20] his riches and glory by Christ Jesus
[30:23] amen let's bow our head in a word of
[30:25] Prayer
[30:26] gracious father Lord just reading your
[30:29] word makes us happy Lord because we
[30:31] thank you Lord that our enemy will come
[30:33] to an end and he shall be no more but
[30:36] yet Lord by your grace Lord we will
[30:38] still be we will still be a lord will be
[30:40] eternal with you forever and ever and
[30:42] ever

[30:44] to worship You Lord we know there's no
[30:46] time there but Lord Lord we will never

[31:00] father that you would take preeminence
[31:02] in every life law that you would bind
[31:04] every spirit contrary to you in the name
[31:05] of Jesus Christ law that the devil would
[31:08] be under our feet Lord and not just for
[31:10] these few moments in this place but Lord
[31:12] every day from his fall father may you

[31:46] portion Father in Jesus Christ's name
[31:48] may you grant it amen I think god bless
[31:51] your friends you may have your seats
[31:52] tonight I'd like to take a title from
[31:55] that last last scripture he read but he
[31:58] he gives us what we need now brother
[32:02] Branham would he would and and the
[32:05] message looking at the unseen he comes
[32:07] down to thee to the end of that service
[32:10] and he's making an altar call and he's
[32:11] calling out for the people to come
[32:13] forward and receive the Lord and he and
[32:14] he and he says while you're standing on
[32:17] your feet praising God how many wants
[32:19] you you that raised your hands a while
[32:22] ago believes that God will hear my
[32:23] prayer for your salvation of your soul
[32:25] come walking down here now as we sing I
[32:28] will praise them I'll praise them come
[32:30] on walk right on down the aisles here
[32:32] now write down to receive Jesus keep
[32:34] your hands up keep looking at the unseen
[32:37] that little pulsation in your heart come
[32:40] right right on down as he pulsating to
[32:43] you and then his voice changes he says
[32:45] I'm the Lord that raised up Christ from
[32:47] the grave I'm the one that sent the Holy
[32:49] Ghost I'm the one that gives the promise
[32:51] brother Bram has nothing to do in this I
[32:53] have he surrendered his life to me I'm
[32:55] using his spirit I'm talking through his
[32:57] lips that's me I'm the Lord and he goes
[33:00] Becky says come down so what happens is
[33:02] God makes himself known and that service
[33:04] he's been speaking the entire time
[33:06] through his prophet but he he he steps
[33:09] and you can say in a slightly different
[33:10] way that we would know that it wasn't a
[33:13] man calling us but it was Almighty God
[33:15] was calling us through this message
[33:18] hallelujah that we amen that we are not
[33:20] cool as he said Willy a brother brand
[33:23] has nothing to do with this this is me
[33:25] it's the Lord I'm using his lips Amen so
[33:27] we need to look to the unseen hallelujah
[33:30] because we know that that unseen one
[33:32] that was there is present here among us
[33:35] hallelujah that he is not back in 1965
[33:38] but he is
[33:38] yeah now we have to understand that our
[33:41] our journey is as in direct contrast to
[33:45] to Lucifer Lucifer was made perfect we
[33:49] just read about him there in Ezekiel he
[33:51] was the anointed cherub that covereth he
[33:53] was made perfect in the day he was
[33:54] created he was perfection
[33:56] amen but yet the bride does not start
[33:58] off in perfection we started off in
[34:00] chaos we started off in darkness we
[34:03] started off like the world was in
[34:04] Genesis 1 and 1 I mean that darkness
[34:07] covered the earth and water covered the
[34:09] face of the earth but then God moved the
[34:11] Spirit of God brooded upon the waters
[34:13] hallelujah and and he did that because
[34:15] there was seed in the earth that he
[34:17] wanted to come to life wholly and that's
[34:20] why that's why you've got to go back
[34:21] when when he first called you I mean
[34:24] because the Spirit of God brooded over
[34:26] you because there was a life in you then
[34:28] he wanted to express I mean he doesn't
[34:30] just call now when I talk about the call
[34:32] of God tonight I'm not talking about
[34:34] some big blanket call right I'm talking
[34:36] to a personal invitation to the wedding
[34:40] supper to you Rice's no I'm not talking
[34:43] about some blanket call when I talk
[34:44] about being called by God I'm talking
[34:46] about like Abraham was called of God
[34:48] Abraham was called God spoke to him
[34:51] personally he said leave this land I'll
[34:53] take you to another land it wasn't some
[34:56] blanket call it was a personal call to
[34:58] Abraham so when I speak about the call
[35:01] of God that's the call I'm talking about
[35:03] okay so I'm gonna define some terms you
[35:06] know where I'm going okay cuz sometimes
[35:08] we can miss out you can misunderstand
[35:09] when I say the call of God whatever more
[35:11] but I'm talking about a personal call
[35:13] and God called Abraham because God knew
[35:17] Abraham was part of his word right
[35:20] Abraham did not but God knew it and
[35:23] that's why God called Abraham that's
[35:25] exactly the same as you and I the reason
[35:27] we have been called by this message is
[35:29] because we are part of the word we are
[35:32] part of our Lord Jesus Christ he didn't
[35:34] just say oh I wonder what they'll do he
[35:36] knew what you would do he knew your
[35:38] response
[35:39] he knew you'd surrender your life he
[35:40] knew that you would walk with him he
[35:42] knew for every danger toyless there you
[35:44] would still trust him hallelujah and he
[35:47] knew that that's why he called you a man
[35:50] as brother BAM tells us God does
[35:52] save a man just to lose in the next day
[35:54] when you're sealed away into the kingdom
[35:56] you're sealed no one can break the seal
[35:58] until you've made it to your destination
[36:00] holy that means devil no tampering and
[36:03] he won't be able to break it anyway now
[36:06] as I said Lucifer was made perfect but
[36:09] we came out of chaos
[36:11] Lucifer does not understand this he does
[36:14] not understand that how a holy God
[36:16] remember he was in God's presence he was
[36:18] the anointed cherub that covereth he
[36:20] wasn't some angel in the back somewhere
[36:21] he was right there here's the anointed
[36:23] cherub that covereth so he knew what has
[36:25] to be in the prison's of God he knows to
[36:27] be right there where God was hallelujah
[36:29] he knew what it was like to to be there
[36:32] in the presence of this holy God and he
[36:35] was also the the worship leader in
[36:37] heaven no doubt he would have been
[36:39] inspired to write some songs but the
[36:42] songs that he wrote are nothing compared
[36:45] to the bright songs because even brother
[36:47] Bram says about the Angels have done for
[36:49] those ones who keep their first estate
[36:50] they all have to hang their heads and be
[36:53] silent when the redeemed sing of the
[36:55] blood right because the angels can't
[36:57] sing of redemption cuz they're never
[36:59] redeemed they were never lost they were
[37:00] never found
[37:01] they never healed you know they were
[37:03] never that way so they could never sing
[37:05] about those things but the Bride of
[37:06] Christ can holy the Bride of Christ can
[37:09] sing about redemption and unity and
[37:11] oneness hallelujah I am being called by
[37:14] the word and being made in His image I
[37:16] mean but the angels cannot sing that way
[37:18] so Lucifer cannot sing he could never be
[37:21] inspired to write the songs the bride
[37:23] writes holily because they he never had
[37:26] the experience that we've had I mean
[37:29] because we know every song was written
[37:30] out of experience
[37:32] Amen Maryam picked up the tambourine
[37:34] because she just crossed the Red Sea
[37:35] holiest Moses sang the song of Moses
[37:38] because his enemies have just been
[37:40] dragged he could sing hallelujah and
[37:42] every we know every true song is written
[37:45] out of revelation hallelujah every true
[37:48] worship is out of Revelation amen that's
[37:53] why we can sing a song that the brought
[37:56] that the devil can never sing even when
[38:00] even before he fell he can't write half
[38:03] the music you could write because he
[38:05] knows nothing of being a
[38:06] child of God he knows nothing of being
[38:08] the bride he was just the servant angels
[38:10] the servants neither hired help they're
[38:12] not the family I mean they're just
[38:14] servants right servants are told what to
[38:16] do
[38:16] amen and even and even a servant that is
[38:20] fallen that has been fired still has to
[38:23] obey the voice of the father hallelujah
[38:26] amen so now brother Brahim says in the
[38:30] exposition of Church ages ladies in
[38:32] church age he says he says he says the
[38:38] church is no longer the mouthpiece of
[38:40] God
[38:41] it's it's own mouthpiece so God is
[38:43] turning on hear her he will confound her
[38:46] through the prophet and the bride for
[38:48] the voice of God will be in her yes it
[38:50] is for us the day for it says the last
[38:53] chapter revelation verse 17 and the
[38:56] spirit heard me and the bride say come
[38:58] once more the world will hear direct
[39:01] from God as at Pentecost but of course
[39:04] that word bride will be repudiated as it
[39:07] is in the first Age holiest he says that
[39:11] he says now he has cried out to this
[39:13] last age you have the word you have more
[39:15] Bibles than ever but you're not doing
[39:17] anything about the word except dividing
[39:20] and hacking it into pieces taking what
[39:22] you want leaving out what you don't want
[39:23] you're not interested in living it
[39:25] but debating it I will sooner you are
[39:27] cold or hot if you were cold and
[39:29] rejected I'd stand there but um if you
[39:32] would get hot white hot to know its
[39:35] truth and love it I would praise you for
[39:37] that but when you simply take my word
[39:39] and don't honor it I in return must
[39:41] refuse to honor you I'll spew you out
[39:43] for you nauseate me he says but thank
[39:46] God at this moment this age is not over
[39:48] here's yet crying and as cry as not only
[39:50] in the spiritual ears of men by his Holy
[39:53] Spirit but once again a prophet as in
[39:55] the land once more God will reveal the
[39:57] truth as he did to Paul in the days of
[39:59] the seventh messenger in the days of the
[40:01] latter C&H its messenger will reveal the
[40:03] mysteries of God as revealed to Paul he
[40:06] will speak out and those who receive
[40:08] that prophet and his own name will
[40:10] receive the benefit effect of the
[40:12] prophets ministry and they will hear him
[40:15] and they that hear him will be blessed
[40:16] and become part of that bride of the
[40:19] last day
[40:20] who I mentioned in revelation 22:17 the
[40:22] spirit and the bride say come
[40:24] I mean the corn wheat the bride wheat
[40:26] that fell into the ground at lady osya
[40:28] we'll come back to the original word
[40:30] grain again
[40:30] praise God forever yes listen to the
[40:33] authenticator prophet of God who appears
[40:35] in this last age what he says from God
[40:38] the bride will say the spirit and the
[40:40] prophet and the bride will say the same
[40:42] thing and they will say and and what
[40:45] they will say will have already been
[40:48] said in the word they are saying it out
[40:50] now come out from among them and be
[40:52] separate the cries guide out the cries
[40:55] going out how long will the voice cry we
[40:57] do not know but one thing we know it
[41:00] won't be long for this is the last age I
[41:02] mean but once again the world will hear
[41:06] from God directly as they did at
[41:08] Pentecost because the word is in the
[41:11] Bride of Christ hallelujah so now when
[41:14] we you know we know that's more than
[41:17] preaching that's living a life oh yeah
[41:19] Lucifer can't live the life you live I
[41:22] mean you're here to be safe sanctified
[41:26] and sealed into the kingdom of the Holy
[41:27] Ghost seem to be your brother the
[41:28] prophecies but he can't live the same
[41:30] car he can't worship the same way you
[41:32] worship and our life is a worship now
[41:35] Lucifer started off perfect he cannot
[41:38] understand how a holy God that he and
[41:40] he's been in the presence of God like
[41:42] that could have had mercy on vile
[41:44] wretched creatures such as us I meant he
[41:47] cannot understand that it doesn't even
[41:48] come near a sinking and but you know so
[41:52] he does not understand how a people
[41:53] could come out of chaos and to be made
[41:56] into the very image of God hallelujah
[41:59] but now brother Bram says in the
[42:02] masterpiece I trust you're just
[42:04] following my thought but he says he says
[42:08] in the masterpiece is Lord Jesus the
[42:10] inexhaustible fountain of life flows
[42:13] through us today Lord cleanse us from
[42:15] all under there we might stand in thy
[42:18] presence now knowing that there is need
[42:21] among us that we know that we are
[42:23] sinners and not worthy of any blessing
[42:25] but then when we think of whom who came
[42:27] and took our sins then when his blood is
[42:30] there it's not it's not us in the prints
[42:32] of God it's him
[42:33] it's just our voice through his blood
[42:36] his blood is speaking our God thing
[42:39] cleanse our hearts from sin and unbelief
[42:40] give to us the desires of our heart for
[42:43] we truly I have these desires to serve
[42:46] you who has a desire to serve them amen
[42:49] in these weakening conditions and
[42:51] afflictions and things of the world
[42:52] that's put upon us sometimes to perfect
[42:55] us we've been told we've been told that
[42:58] then he said thinking not strange when
[43:00] these trials come they're only working
[43:03] out for our good to perfect us to bring
[43:05] us into that place these great deserts
[43:09] of experience we're righteous men are
[43:12] molded into Saints we thank me for these
[43:14] experiences Lord we would have no means
[43:18] no ways want to do anything contrary to
[43:20] your will but we pray father that in
[43:22] this we'll be bought closer to you and
[43:25] when the burdens are so heavy we can't
[43:27] go no farther then we'll raise up our
[43:29] hands and scream to our Father then hear
[43:32] from heaven Lord heal us make us well
[43:34] for the kingdom of God's sake he says
[43:36] bless thy word this morning Lord thy
[43:38] word is the truth so he says these great
[43:41] deserts of experience we're righteous
[43:44] men are molded into saints you know I
[43:47] was I was driving along a few days ago
[43:49] in the scripture in Philippians came
[43:50] along he will supply all our needs what
[43:53] do we need many times people take that
[43:56] scripture they think money and houses
[43:58] and land and you know all those things
[43:59] sure we need to be you know but jesus
[44:02] said that life is more than raiment it's
[44:06] more than food it's more you know don't
[44:08] think about tomorrow to look after
[44:09] itself it's more than those things but
[44:12] what do we need we need character we
[44:15] need God's character that's what we
[44:17] really need I mean we need God's
[44:20] character in this age that is the thing
[44:22] now PO may be taking that scripture a
[44:24] little bit differently but that's what
[44:26] we have need of amen brother Brahim says
[44:31] in the church age book he says this and
[44:36] I'm just gonna read a little bit further
[44:38] up because he because he drops in he
[44:41] speaks about election now the biggest
[44:44] thing the devil always fights is who we
[44:47] are
[44:48] after Jesus was baptized Satan came
[44:51] against you Jesus filled with the Holy
[44:53] Ghost goes into the desert what's the
[44:55] thing he says if they'll be are you
[44:58] really this one claim
[45:00] yo yo prove it he's attacking his
[45:02] identity and so the devil comes against
[45:06] us the same way are you really the
[45:08] bright are you really a believer are you
[45:10] really one of them
[45:12] maybe he doesn't talk about that way but
[45:14] he but he comes to us and he and he
[45:15] always tries to get us a thinking first
[45:17] person like we're thinking am I really
[45:19] saved
[45:20] am I really a Christian am I really
[45:22] gonna make it as it just me because the
[45:27] devil tries to he never says no he never
[45:30] comes as he really is and stands out
[45:34] there and appears to you and begins to
[45:35] talk you know he speaks to you and here
[45:37] but he tries to make you think you're
[45:39] thinking it
[45:40] hallelujah but you were to take those
[45:42] short you say no where's this gonna lead
[45:43] me it's gonna lead me down so I'd get
[45:45] rid of it I mean because the Lord wants
[45:48] us to be established strengthened and
[45:49] settled wholly he wants us to know who
[45:52] we are on him when the bride knows what
[45:54] she is in the rapture will go when she
[45:57] knows what she isn't she's the word and
[45:58] the reason that the message that word
[46:01] has called you is because the word has
[46:02] come to the word and then the word never
[46:05] went to care for since the word never
[46:06] went to the Pharisees the word never
[46:08] went to the sanhedrin the word came to
[46:11] the word the disciples and they received
[46:13] it and that tells you that they were
[46:14] part of that work because they received
[46:16] the word hallelujah
[46:18] sorry giving Anna so so to me you just
[46:21] got to take that into consideration only
[46:24] belief has he caught you this is real I
[46:28] if I if I repeat myself well I'm just
[46:30] gonna repeat myself has he called you
[46:33] like Abraham was called has he called
[46:35] you that something speak to your soul
[46:37] leave this life you've been living go to
[46:41] another country go to another spiritual
[46:44] atmosphere go to another position and
[46:47] something and you said I think oh well
[46:49] hallelujah and every bridge Oh what are
[46:52] you doing I'm burning that one I'm
[46:53] burning this so I'm just walking on holy
[46:55] away cuz I've heard a voice for me
[46:58] Trinity I'm looking to the unseen
[47:01] hallelujah and then the devil comes
[47:03] along and puts a whole bunch of question
[47:05] you said no hold on that's not the voice
[47:07] of my set now hallelujah my set damn is
[47:12] the voice of God you know how you can
[47:14] see it it too accents in these things
[47:15] right God's voice is a pet to kill away
[47:18] and the devil's voice is a particular
[47:20] way I would I would turn off the devil's
[47:23] voice I don't have I've only got 24
[47:26] hours in the day I don't have time to
[47:28] listen to too many things I'm a limiter
[47:31] I'm limited right so what's the point in
[47:34] listening to the devil in his deception
[47:36] I don't have time the devil tries to
[47:39] sidetrack us and all these things I say
[47:41] sorry I'm too busy come back when I've
[47:44] got free time I never do
[47:46] oh how convenient it is convenient I'm
[47:51] busy hallelujah hey I think we should
[47:55] just worship hallelujah should we just
[47:57] live a life just give God praise are you
[48:00] gonna be walking down the supermarket
[48:02] wherever glory to God hallelujah you
[48:06] know what I mean oh what's wrong with
[48:09] you I found the real stuff Holy Mother
[48:13] empties a man could be drunk on the
[48:14] Spirit of God every day of his life till
[48:16] he leaves this world if he said it I
[48:19] believe it and I believe it's for me
[48:21] hallelujah we just passed the bottle
[48:24] round you know the devil I wouldn't just
[48:26] honestly we're too busy to listen to
[48:28] Satan hallelujah now he says this now
[48:34] this is from the Samoan age where the
[48:37] you go back to that church age is great
[48:38] persecution upon the church and he says
[48:41] that now the Lord God Almighty says I
[48:44] know
[48:44] there he is walking in the midst of his
[48:47] people there he is the chief Shepherd of
[48:49] the flock but does he hold back the
[48:51] persecution does he stim the tribulation
[48:53] no he does not he simply says I know
[48:56] your tribulation I am not at all
[48:59] unmindful of your suffering what a
[49:01] stumbling block this is to so many
[49:03] people like Israel they wonder if God
[49:07] really loves them how can God be just
[49:09] and loving if he stands by and watches
[49:12] people suffer that is what they asked
[49:14] and malachi 1 1 2 3 the burden of the
[49:17] word of Lord to Israel by Malachi I have
[49:20] loved you saith the Lord yet ye say
[49:22] wherein has thou loved us was not Esau
[49:25] Jacob's brother saith the Lord yet I
[49:28] love Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his
[49:31] mountains and his heritage waste for the
[49:33] dragons of the wilderness you see they
[49:35] could not figure out God's love they
[49:37] thought that love meant no suffering
[49:39] they thought that love meant a baby with
[49:42] parental care but God said his love was
[49:44] elective love the proof of his love is
[49:48] election that no matter what happened
[49:51] his love was proven truly by the fact
[49:53] that we were chosen unto salvation
[49:56] because God has chosen you to salvation
[49:58] through sanctification of the Spirit and
[50:01] belief of the truth he may commit you to
[50:03] death as he did Paul he may commit you
[50:05] to suffering is he to job that is his
[50:08] prerogative he is sovereign but it is
[50:10] all with a purpose if he did not have a
[50:13] purpose and he would be the author of
[50:15] frustration and not of peace his
[50:17] purposes after we have suffered a while
[50:19] we would be made perfect be established
[50:23] strengthened and settled hallelujah
[50:28] hallelujah he knows what we need as job
[50:35] said he put strengthen us job 23 6 the
[50:38] beeper you see he himself suffered he
[50:41] learned obedience by the things that he
[50:43] suffered he is actually made perfect by
[50:45] the things that he suffered Hebrews 5:8
[50:48] tonight though he were a son yet he
[50:50] learned learned he obedience by the
[50:52] things which he suffered and being made
[50:55] perfect he became the author of eternal
[50:56] salvation unto all them that obey Him in
[50:59] plain language the very character of
[51:01] Jesus was perfected by suffering and
[51:04] according to Paul he has left us Church
[51:06] a measure of suffering that they to by
[51:08] their faith in God while suffering for
[51:10] him will come to a place of perfection
[51:13] why did he want this James 1:2 - for my
[51:16] brethren count it all joy when you fall
[51:17] into divers temptations knowing this the
[51:20] trying of your faith worketh patience
[51:22] but let patience have a perfect work
[51:24] that ye may be
[51:25] perfect and entire wanting nothing here
[51:29] we are and why does he stand by the
[51:31] reason is in Romans 8:17 18 and if
[51:33] children then heirs heirs of God joint
[51:36] heirs with Christ if so be we suffer
[51:38] with him that we may be also glorified
[51:40] together for I reckon that the
[51:42] sufferings of this present time are not
[51:44] worthy to be compared with the glory
[51:46] that shall be revealed in us unless we
[51:48] suffer with him
[51:49] we cannot reign with him we must suffer
[51:52] to reign the reason for this as
[51:54] character simply is not made without
[51:56] suffering character is a victory not a
[51:58] gift a man without character can't reign
[52:01] because power apart from character is so
[52:03] as a satanic but power with character is
[52:06] fit to rule and since he wants us to
[52:08] share even his throne on the same basis
[52:10] that he overcame and has hit down on his
[52:13] Father's throne then we have to overcome
[52:15] to sit with him and a little temporary
[52:17] suffering we go through now is not
[52:19] worthy to be compared to the tremendous
[52:21] glory that will be revealed in us when
[52:23] he comes oh what treasures are laid up
[52:27] for those who willing to enter his
[52:29] kingdom through much tribulation
[52:33] hallelujah so we need character that's
[52:37] the that's the sum of that we need cap
[52:40] that is what we need he will supply your
[52:43] need and that need is christ-like
[52:45] character hallelujah and so that is why
[52:49] we go through trials and suffering and
[52:51] hardship is because he is refining us
[52:53] bringing out his character in us amen
[52:57] Joseph Joseph had a dream he had two
[53:01] dreams they're both basically the same
[53:03] thing his family would bow down and
[53:05] worship Him he didn't have the character
[53:08] when he had those dreams to actually
[53:10] come into that position he needed to be
[53:12] molded and shaped he so he wanted those
[53:15] dreams to be manifested but he God
[53:18] needed him to go through a process that
[53:21] when it came when the dream actually
[53:22] became reality he didn't get revenge on
[53:25] his brethren but mercy was administered
[53:28] hallelujah so that's why that's why he
[53:32] went into Egypt because God had to
[53:34] refine him God had to mold him God had
[53:36] to shape him hallelujah and
[53:39] the same thing with us you know we are
[53:42] ordained to be made in His image the
[53:44] bride has been called hello have you
[53:47] been called hallelujah
[53:49] has it been granted unto you then you be
[53:50] arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[53:52] the righteous of saints a house the
[53:54] garment does it fit you just right he
[53:57] always makes his government's fit just
[53:58] right he makes the word fit just right
[53:59] right so there you are you've been
[54:02] called so this is where you're going but
[54:04] you've got to have the character to get
[54:06] into that position right but we we're
[54:08] the government now he received the coat
[54:11] of many colors went here you know when
[54:12] he was that young an order for that
[54:14] covenant to be in him you know to
[54:16] actually manifest those dreams he had to
[54:18] go through some trials and hardships to
[54:20] receive character and sometimes like
[54:24] Joseph he had the dreams he thought Here
[54:26] I am it's going to happen and then his
[54:29] brothers sell him as a slave and he
[54:31] thinks he's going in the opposite
[54:32] direction of what he thinks because he's
[54:35] going away from his family he doesn't
[54:37] know when he'll see them again
[54:38] and he thinks he's going in the opposite
[54:40] direction of where he thinks he should
[54:41] be going
[54:42] and God has him exactly where he should
[54:43] be and he's going down into Egypt and
[54:46] then he's there a part of his house he
[54:47] becomes in charge of all part of his
[54:49] goods he may be speaking to think now
[54:51] this Potiphar was kept with the guard
[54:53] now maybe it'll happen now and then he
[54:56] gets him to prison because he becomes
[54:57] part of his wife lied he's going the
[54:59] opposite direction he thinks again but
[55:01] he needed to be in a prison he needed to
[55:04] be in the prison hallelujah in the
[55:06] butler and Bakic come and God tells him
[55:08] the your interpretation of the dream the
[55:11] gift is operating he's in charge of the
[55:13] prison
[55:15] anything and then he says to the butler
[55:17] I always get them mixed up whichever one
[55:20] that loves remember me when you're a
[55:24] restored and he forgets about them and
[55:28] he's in prison and sometimes we think
[55:31] why does this continue God's God is
[55:35] never in a hurry all mean but all the
[55:40] devil is is at all to bring out what's
[55:43] in you this life is like a dark room you
[55:46] hit the analogy that you know old school
[55:48] not digital pictures some of you I don't
[55:51] even know what real real for
[55:53] for years it's like at my old job we
[55:56] found some floppy disks and some people
[55:58] took them and and and and show them to
[56:00] the younger workers than me some of them
[56:03] knew what they were people think I was
[56:06] just a save icon no it was a real thing
[56:08] but so you know darkroom
[56:11] this is like our negative right but we
[56:14] ever like so so we like film and it's
[56:16] got to go through a process so that M
[56:19] pert that's on the film has to come out
[56:21] so we're being developed in this
[56:23] darkroom this world is the negative
[56:25] heaven as the positive program says if
[56:27] there's a tree struggling for life here
[56:29] it's reflecting a tree that's living
[56:31] somewhere Amen to this world as a
[56:33] darkroom and God is developing us
[56:36] hallelujah and God always does a good
[56:38] job we may not understand what he's
[56:41] doing but he's doing hallelujah Joseph
[56:45] was in the darkroom he had to be a he
[56:48] had to be be at the right hand of
[56:50] Pharaoh he's languishing in prison do
[56:52] you think he was rejoicing remember me
[56:54] when you get out and he's out and one
[56:57] day goes next day goes surely now third
[57:00] day goes I think it's hot would a
[57:02] thinker but yeah maybe singing have I
[57:06] been forgotten has God forgot me in this
[57:09] place sometimes we think that has God
[57:12] forgotten me he hasn't forgotten he
[57:16] can't forget a part of himself that's
[57:18] why the devil will not get any of God's
[57:20] children into the lake of fire
[57:21] and if God cannot lose a part of himself
[57:24] even the smallest but he can't lose it
[57:27] hallelujah so now Joseph's ready and
[57:30] then the butler remembers and then he's
[57:34] exalted to the right hand of Pharaoh and
[57:36] is the famine all those things happen
[57:38] and then ours brother brothers are here
[57:40] and now the dream can be manifested
[57:42] because now he's ready to administer
[57:44] mercy to the ones who actually seen him
[57:46] into slavery and we were ruling reign
[57:49] with Christ hallelujah so many times we
[57:53] think where's life going God knows where
[57:56] it's going what do you have need of we
[57:59] have need of character
[58:01] lujah brother Bram says in the absolute
[58:07] he says of Christ as your absolute
[58:10] you're tied to him in that manner no
[58:12] matter what anybody says how hard
[58:15] persecution gets how bad the storm seems
[58:18] to be how it looks impossible for it to
[58:20] happen if something has happened in you
[58:23] that Christ becomes your absolute any
[58:26] promise in the Bible becomes your
[58:28] absolute if you're sick you are praying
[58:30] for healing and and something becomes
[58:32] that strikes that promise in the Bible
[58:34] I've got it there's nothing going to
[58:37] wave it from you hallelujah
[58:40] Joseph was fixed on two dreams he didn't
[58:43] have a Bible to read he didn't have
[58:45] Church he didn't he couldn't listen to
[58:46] 1,100 messages he had two dreams and it
[58:50] gripped his life it became as absolute
[58:53] hallelujah Abraham had an absolute you
[58:56] go read the records of when God spoke to
[58:59] Abraham it doesn't take very long to
[59:01] read I don't know how long the actual
[59:03] accounts were just a few moments in the
[59:05] presence of God over 25 years no Bible
[59:09] no church just a visitation but it
[59:13] gripped them they gripped them
[59:16] there's many voices in this age I'm too
[59:19] busy to listen to any other voice yeah I
[59:23] was joking while I sounded joking before
[59:25] but I am too busy what's the point of
[59:28] listening to a voice that won't give you
[59:30] a rapture what's the point of listening
[59:32] to a voice that is not your identity
[59:35] what is the point of listening to a
[59:37] voice that will just leave you to to
[59:38] lead you to destruction I would rather
[59:41] listen to my father's voice I mean the
[59:44] Bible says because we are sons he gives
[59:46] us the Holy Ghost not because we became
[59:49] is a big difference not because we read
[59:52] in Galatians because we were sung He
[59:55] shed forth us his spirit upon us we cry
[59:57] Abba Father because we always were why
[1:00:00] did this message call you because you
[1:00:02] always were the bride how Lou your
[1:00:04] brother Ram says that we are born with
[1:00:06] this unmerited predestinated winning
[1:00:09] band of His grace on our fingers we were
[1:00:13] born with it we didn't receive
[1:00:15] but we always had it hallelujah before
[1:00:18] you even knew you're even alive you had
[1:00:20] it on you well I could say you had it on
[1:00:22] you and nothing can take it out of you
[1:00:25] amen nothing can take it as you know
[1:00:27] that's why you take David David was a
[1:00:30] man after God's own heart the Spirit of
[1:00:32] God came upon him one day he was
[1:00:34] anointed by a vindicated prophet that's
[1:00:36] why I'm just trying to emphasize go back
[1:00:39] to win God meet you go back to that time
[1:00:44] just go back to that time what happened
[1:00:47] to you you say well there wasn't a big
[1:00:50] lightning thunder time but something in
[1:00:52] here said yes something in you said I'm
[1:00:55] gonna follow so I'm going you says I
[1:00:57] give my will over to you something in me
[1:01:00] said yes I'm I'm walking with this word
[1:01:02] I don't know exactly hey we know that we
[1:01:04] know where we're going but there's a lot
[1:01:06] of detail in the middle that we're not
[1:01:08] told just like Joseph he knew where he
[1:01:11] knew the dream would happen he to know
[1:01:12] the detail David knew he was going to be
[1:01:14] king he didn't know the detail
[1:01:16] hallelujah and we don't know the detail
[1:01:18] but we know where we're going but you've
[1:01:21] got to go back to where that moment when
[1:01:25] he called you because that moment when
[1:01:27] he called you is like when brother Brown
[1:01:29] speaks I think I mentioned a couple of
[1:01:30] weekends ago and spiritual amnesia and
[1:01:32] the soldiers with amnesia right as I
[1:01:35] said in the beginning the devil always
[1:01:37] attacks who we are amen
[1:01:40] but brother band when he dramatized that
[1:01:42] story the soldier saw familiar places
[1:01:45] and he began walking following those
[1:01:48] familiar places until it lead him home
[1:01:51] it didn't lead him to the neighbor's
[1:01:53] house and lead him home
[1:01:56] hallelujah and when he got home his
[1:01:59] father came out of home and embraced
[1:02:03] them and brother him when his father
[1:02:05] said son I always knew you would return
[1:02:07] and embrace them then his eyes came open
[1:02:10] their knees are lifted and he knew who
[1:02:13] he was because something led him it's
[1:02:18] the same thing with this word sometimes
[1:02:20] we made wait we don't know who we are
[1:02:22] when we're born meet I think well I'm a
[1:02:25] New Zealand or South African or Korean
[1:02:27] or wherever you're from on this planet
[1:02:28] you think that's my nationality this is
[1:02:30] Who I am
[1:02:31] that's not who we are that's just a
[1:02:34] natural birth God allowed it because you
[1:02:35] want to reveal himself to us but we're
[1:02:38] not some nationality we we have a
[1:02:41] passport it's a kingdom of heaven holy
[1:02:45] and we have our visa the Holy Ghost amen
[1:02:48] that's our nationality I meant but it's
[1:02:50] when father embrace them cuz it took
[1:02:53] them home and brother mom says you you
[1:02:56] you start wandering through the Bible
[1:02:58] you may find yourself identified as a
[1:03:00] believer
[1:03:01] haloo you and so why that's all done he
[1:03:05] uses that illustration because he's
[1:03:07] trying to get you to see the Spirit of
[1:03:09] God brooded over you doesn't matter
[1:03:11] where you were that's irrelevant but he
[1:03:15] brooded over you because there was a
[1:03:17] seat
[1:03:18] not because you're you're this taller
[1:03:21] you have this voice you're the snow
[1:03:22] you're the seed in the seed of election
[1:03:26] that was buried and it could have been
[1:03:28] under concrete it could have been under
[1:03:30] whatever complex or pain or religion
[1:03:32] that's irrelevant where it was buried as
[1:03:34] long as I was there and that's the
[1:03:36] reason he says like little you know the
[1:03:39] lily pushing through the mud and the
[1:03:42] mire there's something in it that it
[1:03:44] must come out to the sunlight it must
[1:03:45] push above the mud come out above the
[1:03:47] water holy it opened herself before the
[1:03:49] Sun there's a life in it that must come
[1:03:51] out and that's why well there's my
[1:03:54] experience you go from one thing and you
[1:03:58] don't fit in here
[1:03:59] okay you go here you try something else
[1:04:04] well that doesn't work and then you go
[1:04:06] over here and you try something else and
[1:04:08] it didn't work either and you just think
[1:04:11] I don't fit in here what is this what is
[1:04:15] this and then finally you come to the
[1:04:18] right place
[1:04:19] you come home
[1:04:23] you come back to the word cuz you're
[1:04:25] part of the word you come home and
[1:04:27] there's something in you that says this
[1:04:30] is this below I belong here
[1:04:32] this is my city of refuge this is my
[1:04:34] Haven of references where I belong
[1:04:37] hallelujah and God wants you to know
[1:04:39] that's where you belong
[1:04:41] he doesn't he doesn't remember we are
[1:04:43] not bystanders we are not just visiting
[1:04:47] heaven we're not just visiting the
[1:04:49] message we're not just visiting our Lord
[1:04:51] Jesus right we are part of him
[1:04:54] hallelujah he didn't just call you just
[1:04:56] for you to take what you want to walk on
[1:04:58] no that's not as purpose his purpose is
[1:05:01] that you would know you are part of his
[1:05:04] word hallelujah hallelujah we and what
[1:05:16] the Christian needs today in this atomic
[1:05:18] age this is an absolute again and this
[1:05:23] time of uncertainty we need something
[1:05:25] besides just an experience of joining
[1:05:28] church we need an anchor and absolute
[1:05:30] and you know because churches will fail
[1:05:33] people will fail but Christ cannot fail
[1:05:36] peace the absolute to the believer and
[1:05:40] if Christ is your absolute you're tied
[1:05:42] to him and if he is your absolute and
[1:05:45] you're tied to him then you're tied to
[1:05:46] the word now now this tells whether
[1:05:48] you've got the right absolute or not if
[1:05:50] you can read in that scripture something
[1:05:52] that Christ has ordained or commissioned
[1:05:54] us to do and because of some twisting
[1:05:56] around if someone would tell you that's
[1:06:00] for the disciples or for someone else
[1:06:02] and then you and you don't hold on to
[1:06:04] that then Christ is not your absolute
[1:06:07] that person that leads you out of the
[1:06:09] ways your absolute but if that word
[1:06:11] Christ still hold see then he's your
[1:06:14] absolute we mustn't let anything steer
[1:06:17] us out of the way of the word see
[1:06:19] hallelujah now that doesn't mean you
[1:06:21] won't have hardship or trials doesn't
[1:06:25] mean you'll be tested amen but the
[1:06:28] anchor still holds God likes to test the
[1:06:31] anchor rope
[1:06:33] he likes to test it because he wants you
[1:06:36] to see something's holding you it's not
[1:06:38] us it's not us holding God you come to
[1:06:41] that conclusion in life I trust you have
[1:06:43] you will one day if you haven't it's not
[1:06:45] you being it's not you holding on to the
[1:06:47] Lord he's holding on to you he's the one
[1:06:51] with the strong hands it's not that I've
[1:06:53] got him by the hand it's he's got me by
[1:06:55] the hand
[1:06:55] hallelujah say your little children you
[1:06:58] you take them by the hand they can go
[1:06:59] like this and try and get out but if
[1:07:01] your grip holds hallelujah their hand is
[1:07:03] staying in and his grip never comes
[1:07:06] loose hallelujah
[1:07:08] so as long as he's got us by the hand
[1:07:10] he's holding on to us that's why the
[1:07:13] devil can come in but something deep
[1:07:15] down still holds and it won't let go and
[1:07:19] it can't let go
[1:07:21] hallelujah Amen now the living words
[1:07:27] spoken to you that's supernatural power
[1:07:29] of the word of this message that is our
[1:07:31] absolute that's our identity that's who
[1:07:35] we are
[1:07:36] amen you know I think often of Mary
[1:07:41] coming to the tomb she was part of the
[1:07:46] resurrection she didn't realize it she
[1:07:51] had come to a point none of the
[1:07:53] disciples were happy that Dad the
[1:07:55] crucifixion none of them were rejoicing
[1:07:58] he goes the Lamb of God up that hill
[1:08:01] with this sin Healing is released
[1:08:04] eternal life is being released the blood
[1:08:07] the debt was being paid in full
[1:08:09] hallelujah hallelujah the lamb was going
[1:08:12] up the hill with it the perfect lamb you
[1:08:16] know Pilate said I find no fault in this
[1:08:18] man he was examined hallelujah every
[1:08:21] life came to nothing and here he was
[1:08:24] with the sin of the world for this
[1:08:26] course I've come into the world and he's
[1:08:28] walking
[1:08:29] hallelujah and the blood flowing down
[1:08:32] his back brother and says this go there
[1:08:34] you see a man is howling mob saying
[1:08:36] crucify him crucify him and see a pool
[1:08:39] of patch of blood patches of blood
[1:08:41] four-month in his robe it becomes one
[1:08:43] big one big amount of blood black dong
[1:08:46] Downers
[1:08:47] legs as he's walking up Calvary that day
[1:08:49] they weren't happy they were broke him
[1:08:52] but if they knew what was going on they
[1:08:56] would have be the happiest people who
[1:08:57] you imagine that there he goes
[1:09:00] hallelujah I'm sorry I'm just gonna get
[1:09:02] happy for a little bit you can join me
[1:09:04] you can just say what's wrong with that
[1:09:06] guy I met him that's what's wrong with
[1:09:08] me
[1:09:09] hallelujah mention that there goes and
[1:09:11] he had to do it no one else can do it
[1:09:14] you imagine if you really recognized
[1:09:16] what was going on that day it may go
[1:09:18] hello yeah you must you must be a curse
[1:09:22] for us you must hang upon that cross
[1:09:24] hallelujah it would have been a
[1:09:27] rejoicing day and then when he hung up
[1:09:30] there between humans and Earth he says
[1:09:33] it's done or it is finished do you think
[1:09:37] they were rejoicing no idea the man they
[1:09:40] believe that was Messiah was now dead he
[1:09:43] didn't defend himself he has done before
[1:09:45] his accusers like the Bible said he
[1:09:46] would be haloo you Judas win and hung
[1:09:49] himself
[1:09:50] well the ministry killed themselves the
[1:09:52] rest of the ministries blocked
[1:09:54] themselves away in some room and this is
[1:09:56] - on the way to Emmaus walking back home
[1:10:01] what's happened our world just fell
[1:10:04] apart and nothing can put it back he's
[1:10:08] been there sometimes it's like who can
[1:10:11] take this and put it back together these
[1:10:14] deserts of experience how we thank you
[1:10:18] for them O Lord and here they were
[1:10:21] walking and then a stranger comes up to
[1:10:24] them and he just appears and he's acting
[1:10:28] like he does know what's going on and
[1:10:30] they begin to say with modern events
[1:10:32] that are going on but they're not made
[1:10:33] clear by the prophecy this is what's
[1:10:36] happening today in the paper didn't you
[1:10:38] hear this man Jesus of Nazareth is the
[1:10:40] property it's going to be the Messiah we
[1:10:42] believed to be the Messiah and he's
[1:10:44] probably maybe put his hands behind his
[1:10:46] back Oh what do you mean why are you
[1:10:48] saying what's this guy going and here he
[1:10:50] is you just think about this the
[1:10:52] greatest victory a human being is ever
[1:10:55] won hallelujah he took your sin down to
[1:10:59] hell

[1:11:03] hell that you don't need to go I mean
[1:11:05] here is your son offering he went down
[1:11:07] there he kicks into the he kicks the
[1:11:09] door of hell down hallelujah takes the
[1:11:12] keys of held in the grave of Satan
[1:11:14] ascends up hallelujah goes into paradise
[1:11:18] hallelujah and this paradise is a bit of
[1:11:20] a stir in paradise because this man just
[1:11:22] walked in the door and there's Daniel
[1:11:25] there sir who you and Abraham's sake
[1:11:27] who's this guy and he says I've known as
[1:11:31] the thief I don't know what his name was
[1:11:33] it's not recorded and they're having the
[1:11:36] epic testimony meeting times no more
[1:11:38] this having testified he what what the
[1:11:40] what God did in their day then this one
[1:11:42] stumbles in they ask him so what's your
[1:11:44] testimony well I was in Jerusalem it was
[1:11:50] a lot of uproar I was condemned to die
[1:11:53] on a cross that's how the road that's
[1:11:55] how the leaders and it made me fool the
[1:11:57] moon this man called Jesus of Nazareth
[1:12:00] I've never stood in the presence of a
[1:12:02] man like they had he stood silently he
[1:12:06] didn't say a word and the governor tried
[1:12:09] to wash his hands of his blood and he he
[1:12:13] just stood there and the religious
[1:12:15] people about a were like a howling mob
[1:12:17] crucify him crucify him and Pilate said
[1:12:20] it's my custom to release a man to you
[1:12:23] show released you Barabbas
[1:12:25] he was a murderer he's a wicked man
[1:12:26] worse than me he's still alive
[1:12:30] and as he show released Barabbas or
[1:12:32] Jesus called the Christ and I was
[1:12:35] thinking my mind surely they wouldn't
[1:12:36] they wouldn't ask for Barabbas and they
[1:12:39] dead and brevis was released friends we
[1:12:43] went live we were released from death
[1:12:46] her Lucas he took our place
[1:12:49] Olu yeah cuz he took our place and then
[1:12:52] so brevis goes and then they lead begin
[1:12:55] this terrible procession he was in front
[1:12:56] I was carrying my cross too and then
[1:12:59] finally we were pinned on the ground we
[1:13:01] were now to it we're hung up it was
[1:13:04] excruciatingly painful and I looked at
[1:13:06] this man there's another thief with us
[1:13:08] and we both mocked him this is both some
[1:13:11] Optum
[1:13:12] both mocked but in something and me
[1:13:15] happened like and I can't explain it
[1:13:16] I looked at him again and he wasn't the
[1:13:19] same kind of man and I said Lord
[1:13:22] remember me when you come into your
[1:13:24] kingdom and he said today I'll be you'll
[1:13:28] be with me in paradise
[1:13:29] now I'm in paradise but where is he and
[1:13:32] then there's a knock on the door and
[1:13:36] then ashamed in the Lord steps in Here I
[1:13:38] am and he says come on children let's go
[1:13:42] a little higher I mean never gonna match
[1:13:45] up into glory and David on the
[1:13:47] procession and David by the spirt rode
[1:13:49] down looking up you gates be lifted up
[1:13:52] to the king of glory shall come in and
[1:13:54] then he finds himself living out the
[1:13:56] prophecy that he wrote down and then now
[1:14:02] they're up there Jesus comes back into
[1:14:05] his body he's walking with them now
[1:14:08] what's going on he just had the greatest
[1:14:11] victory man in his evil one and he's and
[1:14:13] he's pretending he doesn't know and he's
[1:14:16] he's - walking along said and then he
[1:14:18] begins to open the word to them and the
[1:14:20] reason he does it why does this message
[1:14:23] make the Bible of life to you is because
[1:14:26] God wants you to know you are part you
[1:14:30] are the resurrection that's why that's
[1:14:34] why it's not Kentuckians voice to you
[1:14:37] that makes no sense that's why to you it
[1:14:41] is the love of God being spoken forth
[1:14:43] that's why to you it's pardoning grace
[1:14:45] that's why to you it makes this alive
[1:14:50] you say well I don't know about that
[1:14:52] what made you European to be baptized
[1:14:54] what made you leave the world
[1:14:57] what made you walk with the Lord what
[1:15:00] make you in spite of persecution and
[1:15:02] voices trying to pull you back
[1:15:03] what made you keep walking have you
[1:15:07] thought about that that was God that's
[1:15:09] because you're part of the word
[1:15:11] hallelujah I trust this means a little
[1:15:13] bit to someone I mean cuz it means a
[1:15:16] whole bunch to me huh and so he begins
[1:15:20] to open the word to them that they would
[1:15:22] understand they are part of the
[1:15:23] resurrection because it wasn't just
[1:15:25] Jesus
[1:15:26] coming out of the tomb a bride who's
[1:15:28] coming for hallelujah a bride was coming
[1:15:31] for amen and part of the resurrection
[1:15:34] was Jesus said the Lord said I'll pour
[1:15:36] my spirit out upon all flesh so part of
[1:15:39] him coming other tomb was a day of
[1:15:41] Pentecost he needed 120 in there that's
[1:15:45] why he went to the howl ouya and then he
[1:15:49] bring us open the word to them still
[1:15:51] they don't see him they don't understand
[1:15:53] you know mention this you're trying to
[1:15:56] tell this stranger what's going on and
[1:15:57] then the stranger turns around says Oh
[1:15:59] full slow of heart nears and then he
[1:16:01] begins to tell you what the Bible really
[1:16:03] says about what just happened he fills
[1:16:05] in the blanks hallelujah and then now
[1:16:08] and then he K and then they come into
[1:16:11] the house and the person who breaks the
[1:16:13] bread is actually the head of the table
[1:16:14] so Jesus takes the head at at the table
[1:16:17] breaks the bread he did something he did
[1:16:19] before he died and then their eyes came
[1:16:22] open it's helped hallelujah and that's
[1:16:26] why there's something in us when the
[1:16:28] Spirit of God comes down when you listen
[1:16:30] on tapes and hear the discernment
[1:16:31] something in you says he's done that
[1:16:33] before hallelujah and it's not just a
[1:16:36] scratch of religious search something in
[1:16:38] you says he's alive he's come out of the
[1:16:41] grave he's resurrected out of 2,000
[1:16:43] years of bagged annihilationism he's
[1:16:45] come forth hallelujah and because he's
[1:16:47] come forth you've come for hallelujah
[1:16:51] and then they run back and then they
[1:16:53] tell the disciples he's risen now but
[1:16:58] before that all happens there's a girl
[1:17:00] called Mary we left her at the tomb her
[1:17:03] whole life was falling apart just like
[1:17:04] them what did she have need off she
[1:17:08] needed him to come I pray the Lord does
[1:17:10] something just now she needed him to
[1:17:13] come she needed more than someone giving
[1:17:15] answers she needed the answer she needed
[1:17:18] him they went to the tomb with spices
[1:17:21] because they knew a lot about burying
[1:17:23] the dead but they never knew anything
[1:17:24] about someone coming alive who didn't
[1:17:26] need the spices he was alive and she
[1:17:29] comes to the tomb and the stones rolled
[1:17:31] away this is unexpected but there's
[1:17:36] still no answer in an open tube
[1:17:38] they look in there's a barrel close
[1:17:41] an angel speaks to some of them still
[1:17:44] that's not the answer she needed what do
[1:17:46] you have need of we need him we need him
[1:17:51] to come and then she comes out and she's
[1:17:55] still warning what's going on and she
[1:17:58] turns and there's a young man standing
[1:17:59] there and she says she thinks he's a
[1:18:05] gardener sometimes the Lord comes we
[1:18:08] don't understand sometimes we you know
[1:18:11] where is he gone and you're actually
[1:18:14] looking into the word he's saying where
[1:18:15] are you where are you and he wants you
[1:18:19] to see I'm right here I haven't gone
[1:18:22] anywhere I've been here the whole time
[1:18:24] and then she says to him sir tell me
[1:18:29] where they've taken his body that I'll
[1:18:32] go and carry him away lujah but she
[1:18:36] wasn't me to carry away a dead person
[1:18:38] she thought she was going to carry where
[1:18:41] I did person but she was meant to carry
[1:18:43] she was going to meet a resurrected
[1:18:45] living and the big difference she was
[1:18:48] looking at him but it's when she called
[1:18:51] when he called her by name Mary the
[1:18:55] inner eyes come open Lord it's you
[1:18:59] hallelujah
[1:19:00] I bet you she was not sad anymore she
[1:19:05] was not sad anymore she was not broken
[1:19:07] anymore she was not confused anymore
[1:19:09] because her need was him and he came
[1:19:13] down and spoke to her directly
[1:19:15] hallelujah and then all the sadness left
[1:19:17] mention that your whole world is gone
[1:19:20] that's one you loved
[1:19:21] that's one you have how could they do
[1:19:23] this to him the only healed the sick
[1:19:25] race are dead hallelujah cast out Devils
[1:19:28] and this is what they do
[1:19:29] where's he gone and you go to us to me
[1:19:32] stop there and then he's there in a
[1:19:35] different way in a different form
[1:19:38] hallelujah he calls and he calls her by
[1:19:42] name
[1:19:42] that's what I going to say you got to go
[1:19:44] back to when he called you by name you
[1:19:47] got to go back when the word called you
[1:19:49] by name we say well I never heard no
[1:19:51] audible voice say my name but when the
[1:19:53] word quickens to your soul that's God
[1:19:56] calling you by name holy that's God
[1:19:59] identifying that you are the bride Amen
[1:20:02] you're not just a religious remember
[1:20:04] this is not a church this is not a
[1:20:06] church this is not a gathering of just a
[1:20:09] larger people this is part of the
[1:20:11] redeemed of the ages of gathered that's
[1:20:14] what a church has gods gathered was
[1:20:16] redeemed ones that he's gathered to
[1:20:18] himself that's what the churches where
[1:20:21] the bride call but I've says that the
[1:20:24] bride call will come right through this
[1:20:25] through the message and it has and if a
[1:20:29] bride calls gone forth it who has
[1:20:31] responded to the call what does that
[1:20:35] make you say it right what does it make
[1:20:39] you you got to say it hallelujah
[1:20:41] if you've responded to the call and it's
[1:20:43] a bridegroom call it's a call for a
[1:20:45] bride and you responded that makes you
[1:20:48] brave and so basically you take that
[1:20:54] ignore everything the devil says you got
[1:20:58] to do that
[1:20:59] no I'm being deadly serious because he
[1:21:02] will fight you to the very every moment
[1:21:05] of every day saying you're not worthy
[1:21:07] you're not part of them you're not
[1:21:09] accepted you're different
[1:21:11] we're all different hallelujah but it
[1:21:15] doesn't matter it doesn't matter where
[1:21:17] we're from hallelujah God has a God of
[1:21:20] variety and we love the variety
[1:21:23] hallelujah God is not just a one-hit
[1:21:26] wonder he's a God of variety eat with me
[1:21:28] and then so now the important thing is
[1:21:31] have you accepted the call yes I'm going
[1:21:35] through a lot of battles Joseph would
[1:21:36] have had a lot of battles in the dungeon
[1:21:38] why am I still here why hasn't he told
[1:21:42] Pharaoh I'm here on a trumped-up charge
[1:21:44] again but yet God had him there because
[1:21:50] God was molding him hallelujah King
[1:21:53] David you go read the story of David
[1:21:55] same thing say God repeats himself
[1:21:57] causing for wanting you to see that the
[1:22:00] path they walk does the path you will
[1:22:03] walk
[1:22:04] amen you see you meet God God anoint
[1:22:06] your life transforms you conquer some
[1:22:08] Devils like David killed the bear and
[1:22:10] the lion and and Goliath and then and
[1:22:12] then the enemy comes in sometimes you
[1:22:15] and there's a lot of hardship you know
[1:22:16] when he's crying out in the Psalms he's
[1:22:20] not sitting in his palace the enemies
[1:22:23] all around about me did it I don't know
[1:22:24] he's hidden up in some cave fearing for
[1:22:27] his life he had a lot of hardship deals
[1:22:29] a lot of clothes shake you know imagine
[1:22:32] him he's gone he's running into the
[1:22:34] Philistine land he was desperate he's
[1:22:37] thinking how am I gonna survive I just
[1:22:39] killed their champion not long ago my
[1:22:41] fellow Israelites sing a song that I've
[1:22:42] killed tens of thousands of these people
[1:22:44] and they would have heard it how am I
[1:22:47] gonna
[1:22:47] and then he acts crazy in front of the
[1:22:49] king and he survives you know sometimes
[1:22:53] we get into pretty ridiculous
[1:22:54] circumstances you remember the God has
[1:22:58] put a pattern in his word right and if
[1:23:01] you look into the scripture look into
[1:23:03] the characters you'll find what you are
[1:23:05] going through as be already happened
[1:23:07] amen that's why he says it's
[1:23:10] Persephone's you look around in the word
[1:23:12] and you'll find yourself a believer
[1:23:14] because you'll be able to identify well
[1:23:16] if David had to go through this or
[1:23:18] Joseph or whoever more and I'm in this
[1:23:20] predicament well it's because if they
[1:23:22] did it then that I will fear the shadow
[1:23:25] and I'm the reality well you know the
[1:23:27] shadow matches the reality and so and so
[1:23:31] he had to go through that way because
[1:23:33] when he became king he could be a
[1:23:35] righteous King because he needed the
[1:23:37] character to go up on the throne it's
[1:23:41] the same thing with us rings we have to
[1:23:45] we have to go back and old and I'll
[1:23:48] close with this you have to go back to
[1:23:51] when God called you and you have to
[1:23:54] remember that was real amen
[1:23:57] that was real when God spoke to your
[1:24:00] heart I don't know
[1:24:01] God is not a cookie cutter but he called
[1:24:04] you just like he's he walked with it on
[1:24:06] the way to Emmaus because he wanted him
[1:24:09] to see one I'm alive and two you're part
[1:24:12] of the resurrection and that's why this
[1:24:14] message has come to show one he's alive
[1:24:17] - you're part of the rapture you're part
[1:24:19] of what a resurrection that was what a
[1:24:21] resurrection this is a bride coming out
[1:24:24] of the tomb attacked and emotionalism
[1:24:25] and the devil can't put us back in a
[1:24:27] tomb he may try but he'll never be
[1:24:29] successful hallelujah you look at what
[1:24:33] your ordained to do and you say Lord I
[1:24:35] agree with what I'm prophesied to become
[1:24:38] you shall become it hallelujah is a
[1:24:41] Josefa
[1:24:42] my family has to bow to me his whole
[1:24:45] life was hooked to that prophecy same
[1:24:48] thing with us but if we were going to
[1:24:50] look at what the we listen to what the
[1:24:51] devil says you know the devil is never
[1:24:53] going to encourage you I know this is
[1:24:56] quite pretty elementary he's never going
[1:24:57] to help you in your Christian walk and
[1:24:59] you can do it oh it's gonna be all right
[1:25:01] he never helps you he's never gonna be
[1:25:04] encouraging oh this is who you are and
[1:25:06] look at this no he's never gonna do that
[1:25:09] he wants to destroy you he wants us to
[1:25:12] be of two minds he wants us to think we
[1:25:15] belong on this earth we don't belong on
[1:25:17] this earth we belong in heaven Amen God
[1:25:20] wants us to know who we are what we are
[1:25:23] we are the word hallelujah I mean let's
[1:25:27] have the musicians please I think we've
[1:25:28] ran out of time but I want you to think
[1:25:31] about it friends go back to when he
[1:25:34] called you go back to that time the
[1:25:39] Apostle Paul recounted the road to
[1:25:41] Damascus experienced more than once a
[1:25:44] mint and he knew God called him so it
[1:25:48] didn't matter what happened to him he
[1:25:50] was anchored by that experience he had
[1:25:52] an absolute and we must have the same I
[1:25:57] mean let's stand to our feet shall we
[1:26:03] this bow he's in a word of Prayer
[1:26:07] gracious Heavenly Father the Lord Jesus
[1:26:11] just for you to call us Lord we thank
[1:26:14] you we can look into your word Lord we
[1:26:17] think of Lord Mary at the tomb Lord how
[1:26:21] glad we are Lord we can see ourselves in
[1:26:23] that word Lord because you came Lord
[1:26:25] when we were in despair and lost you you
[1:26:29] called us by name Lord Jesus father and
[1:26:32] our lives have never been the same and
[1:26:34] Lord we know the devil Lord how he wants
[1:26:36] to destroy us and rob us of our identity
[1:26:39] but father we thank you that you are
[1:26:41] greater Lord Jesus that the lies of the
[1:26:44] devil I just lies he's nothing but a
[1:26:46] bluff he has a defeated being and we
[1:26:50] want to thank you dear God he will be he
[1:26:52] will come to nothing Lord Jesus but we
[1:26:55] shall still through the eternities
[1:26:57] praise and worship you so father I pray
[1:26:59] just take these chopped-up words
[1:27:01] and lord may we just rejoice in every
[1:27:04] situation Lord we do thank you for these
[1:27:07] great deserts of experience Lord how we
[1:27:11] thank you for them father
[1:27:12] Oh Lord may we see Lord I pray father
[1:27:15] you bring to our remembrance Lord that
[1:27:17] when this message came our way Lord it's
[1:27:20] a bridegroom call I believe that Lord
[1:27:24] has come to call the bride and you see
[1:27:25] these ones that have gathered Lord those
[1:27:27] who are watching well the reason why you
[1:27:30] have supernaturally called them is
[1:27:31] because they are your bride
[1:27:33] Lord Jesus that's why Lord they are part
[1:27:36] of you and you've loved them with an
[1:27:38] undying love father we thank you Lord
[1:27:41] that your love is elective Lord you
[1:27:43] called us before the foundation of the
[1:27:45] world and Lord we want to thank you that
[1:27:48] nothing can stop that Lord we can never
[1:27:51] be lost father we may be feel very
[1:27:53] wayward upside down many times but Lord
[1:27:55] we're so thankful you hold on to us so
[1:27:59] dear God I pray Lord your sweet presence
[1:28:01] with brood over every heart now father
[1:28:03] lord I just pray that you'll take us
[1:28:05] back to when you called us by name Lord
[1:28:08] all the mine battles would just go Lord
[1:28:10] all the lives the enemy would just
[1:28:12] vanish away Lord that we know Lord Jesus
