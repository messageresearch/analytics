[45:17] knowest the thing that the Lord said
[45:19] unto Moses the man of God concerning me
[45:21] and the inkaid espana 40 years old was I
[45:24] when Moses the servant of the Lord sent
[45:26] me from Kadesh Barnea to a spy out the
[45:28] land and I brought him word again as it
[45:32] was in my heart
[45:33] nevertheless my brethren that went up
[45:36] with me made the heart of the people
[45:39] melt but I wholly followed the Lord my
[45:42] God and Moses swear on that day saying
[45:45] surely the land thereof by feet hath
[45:47] trodden shall be known inheritance and
[45:50] thy children's for ever because thou has
[45:52] a wholly followed the Lord my God and by
[45:55] and now behold the LORD hath kept me
[45:57] alive as he said these forty and five
[46:00] years even since the Lord spake this
[46:02] word unto Moses while the children of
[46:05] Israel wandered in the wilderness and lo
[46:07] I mean and now lo I am this day for four
[46:10] score and five years old as yet I am as
[46:13] strong the stairs I was in the day that
[46:15] Moses sent me as my strength was then
[46:18] even so is my strength now for war both
[46:21] to go to go out and to come in now
[46:24] therefore give me this mountain were of
[46:26] the Lord spake in that day for thou hurt
[46:29] us in that day how the Anakin's Anakin's
[46:33] were there and that the cities were
[46:35] great and fenced if so be the Lord will
[46:37] be with me then I shall be able to drive
[46:40] them out as the Lord said and Joshua
[46:43] blessed him and gave under Caleb the son
[46:46] of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance
[46:49] Hebron therefore became the adherence of
[46:51] Caleb the son of Jephunneh
[46:54] in the kids in sight unto this day
[46:57] because he wholly followed the Lord God
[46:59] of Israel and the name of hebron before
[47:03] was a courage' brother which Abra was a
[47:07] great man among the Anakin's and the
[47:10] land had rest from war I mean
[47:13] let's just go to the book of Matthew the
[47:16] Gospel of Matthew chapter 1 we're going
[47:18] to read just the first just a few verses
[47:21] from verse 18 down to verse 25 and this
[47:27] may seem odd scripture readings to read
[47:31] together but I just want to tie these
[47:33] together see it's here now oh no that's
[47:37] fine thank you God I don't I don't need
[47:39] it oh it says now it says now the birth
[47:47] of Jesus Christ was on the sways when as
[47:50] his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph
[47:52] before they came together she was found
[47:54] with child of the Holy Ghost didn't dosa
[47:57] fur husband being a just man and not
[47:59] willing to make her a public example was
[48:01] minded to put her away privily but while
[48:05] he thought on these things behold the
[48:06] angel the Lord appeared unto Him in a
[48:08] dream saying Joseph thou son of David
[48:10] fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife
[48:12] for that which is conceived in her is of
[48:15] the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth
[48:17] a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus
[48:19] for he shall save his people from their
[48:23] sins amen now let's just
[48:27] it's just bow our heads it would have
[48:29] free if you want to be remember you just
[48:31] well lift your hands to the Lord let's
[48:33] make this a personal service Lord Jesus
[48:36] we are so glad we can close our eyes and
[48:38] bow our heads and talk to you the very
[48:40] living true and living God the one who
[48:42] made humans and Earth Lord and we're so
[48:44] glad that you're our Redeemer you're our
[48:46] strength giver father you're our guide
[48:48] you are all in all and we just pray
[48:50] father as we have read some scriptures
[48:52] out of your out of your word I pray

[49:16] the sick among us as well the bind up
[49:19] the brokenhearted father just lord your
[49:21] the supernatural God we need to come on
[49:23] the scene so far they want to commit
[49:24] ourselves into your hands and be with us
[49:27] now we
[49:27] asking Jesus Christ's name Amen I mean
[49:30] God bless you all you may have your
[49:32] seats this morning so I'd like to I'd
[49:35] like to speak this morning on the power
[49:37] of the absolute or the power of an
[49:39] absolute now brother Branham he he
[49:42] preaches a few services called called
[49:45] the absolute and I want to take a few
[49:48] thoughts from there but I want to look
[49:50] at Caleb and I want to look at John I
[49:53] want to look at Caleb I will look at
[49:54] Mary I will look at Paul the Apostle
[49:56] Paul because they had an absolute in
[49:58] their lives where they could rest upon
[49:59] theirs it was an anchor in their souls
[50:02] where it doesn't matter what came what
[50:04] went they still wholly followed God and
[50:07] now an absolute brother Bram says and
[50:09] this is a 1962 in Jeffersonville he says
[50:12] I was hearing a man speak or talk not
[50:14] long ago used the word absolute I
[50:16] thought that's a very fine word I hear
[50:19] at you so many times absolutely that's I
[50:21] so I looked it up in the dictionary
[50:23] Webster's according to Webster's it's
[50:25] perfect in itself and limited in its
[50:27] power primarily an ultimate and an
[50:30] ultimate is the Amen that's all an
[50:33] absolute it's the unlimited empower the
[50:36] word absolute it's perfect in itself
[50:38] that's all of it that settles it and I
[50:40] thought that's a glorious thing that's a
[50:42] wonderful word and now a word is a
[50:44] thought Express first it must be a
[50:47] thought and then it becomes a word
[50:49] because you do not you do not speak your
[50:52] words without thought when you when we
[50:54] speak in tongues we have no thought it's
[50:57] God giving the thoughts as God's thought
[50:59] using our lips we don't think or know
[51:01] what we're saying when we're speaking in
[51:03] tongues if it's inspired speaking when
[51:05] you interpret you do not know what
[51:07] you're saying you just say it that's all
[51:09] see that's God and prophesying you're
[51:11] not using your own thoughts that's God
[51:13] because you say things that you
[51:15] ordinarily wouldn't think about saying
[51:17] see but the word absolute is an ultimate
[51:20] and therefore I think that everybody
[51:21] should have an ultimate and every great
[51:24] achievement that's ever been achieved
[51:26] there has been an absolute behind it no
[51:29] matter what it is it's had an absolute
[51:32] behind it and every person in order to
[51:34] achieve something has to first find and
[51:37] it first have the absolute and that's
[51:40] the final
[51:41] wind back through this back through the
[51:43] other till you come to that absolute or
[51:46] the Amen or the ultimate of what your
[51:49] you've got to have you've got to have
[51:51] something to tie to in other words it's
[51:54] the final tying post to every
[51:56] achievement that somewhere it might wind
[51:59] through many different things till it
[52:01] gets to that tie post but there is the
[52:03] Amen there's all of it there must be
[52:06] such a thing you cannot go on through
[52:08] life without having an absolute so
[52:11] you've got to have something where you
[52:12] say this is the bottom line this is
[52:14] where the buck stops this is this is
[52:16] where I tie my life to this is my
[52:18] absolute now Joshu I just want to take
[52:21] you through the life of I mean I mean
[52:23] Caleb sorry now many times we probably
[52:25] just read the scripture and we forget
[52:27] the struggles and the battles that that
[52:29] the believers have to go through but you
[52:32] know I just want to take Caleb because
[52:33] Caleb you know he didn't have a ministry
[52:36] like Joshua didn't have a ministry like
[52:38] Moses but he stood there with the
[52:40] believers all the way through there was
[52:42] something in him where he recognized
[52:45] that you know he was standing there in
[52:48] Egypt he was a slave like the rest of us
[52:50] rail he'd got the same beatings he ate
[52:52] the same food he probably made the same
[52:54] bricks you know he had the same life
[52:56] experience and then Moses came into into
[52:59] Egypt and God sent him as a mighty
[53:02] deliverer and now Israel was delivered
[53:04] he saw the plagues fall he saw the
[53:07] darkness he saw you know he put the
[53:10] blood on the door and lintel of his
[53:11] house like everyone else you know he
[53:13] heard the cry the Egyptians where their
[53:15] firstborn was was was being killed by
[53:18] the Death Angel you know he left you
[53:20] know after that Passover meal he
[53:22] journeyed with the rest of them to thee
[53:24] to the edge of the Red Sea you know he
[53:26] saw the Lord go behind them and and keep
[53:29] the armies of Pharaoh from coming and
[53:31] massacring then he saw the Red Sea open
[53:33] he walked through the dry ground
[53:35] I mean he went through the other side he
[53:37] saw a Pharaoh's army you know try and
[53:40] chase him through the Red Sea he saw the
[53:41] waters come over he saw them drown he
[53:44] danced with the rest of Israel when
[53:46] Miriam took the tambourine and the woman
[53:47] dancing they rejoiced and Moses sang in
[53:50] the spirit and they had a glorious time
[53:51] he was there he went to the waters of
[53:54] Marin
[53:55] was bitter and Moses cut down the tree
[53:56] and put it in the water became sweet
[53:58] he went to Mount Sinai he saw God come
[54:01] down on Mount Sinai right he saw he saw
[54:04] the Angel of the covenant descend upon
[54:06] the mountain with the word for the
[54:07] people amen
[54:09] so every one of the believers there I'd
[54:12] say all of Israel they experienced those
[54:14] same things but the difference came with
[54:18] their absolute what are they banking
[54:21] there you know what are they putting
[54:22] their life on right Caleb was different
[54:27] Caleb was sent out with the heads of the
[54:30] tribes to spy out the land it was him
[54:32] and Joshua and ten others they were the
[54:34] heads of the tribes you know and they
[54:36] they win spied the land out then they
[54:39] came back and then now they begin to
[54:41] give their report now there would have
[54:43] been he had overcome pressure
[54:45] it was here was here was men of renown
[54:47] they had they had they were celebrities
[54:49] of the of the tribes they had influence
[54:52] they had you know all look at these
[54:54] great heads of the tribes they had the
[54:55] celebrities of Israel and now they were
[54:57] giving their report and now when someone
[54:59] of great influence gives a report
[55:01] there's always pressure of the other
[55:03] ones now am I going to go against what
[55:05] they say or am I going to take am I
[55:07] going to speak my mind or really what I
[55:08] believe his the pressure comes on he was
[55:11] stood that pressure right because he was
[55:13] tied to an absolute he was tied to an
[55:15] ultimate he wasn't tied to conditions
[55:18] he wasn't tied to what he saw in the
[55:20] land of the enemy he wasn't tied to
[55:22] those things he is tied to the Word of
[55:23] God hallelujah he was there at Mount
[55:26] Sinai and when Moses came down with the
[55:29] Lord began to speak words to him it was
[55:31] more than a man speaking it was more
[55:32] than a prophet speaking it was more than
[55:34] a healing ministry or a B or Ministry of
[55:37] deliverance a ministry of Supernatural
[55:39] it was more than that to him it was God
[55:41] speaking through a man I mean we're
[55:43] anchored into his soul this is what
[55:45] changed it for him I mean it was more he
[55:48] could anchor his life on that word that
[55:50] was spoken by that prophet hallelujah
[55:52] he knew that word would take them into
[55:54] the Promised Land he knew that covenant
[55:56] angel was there to anoint them to take
[55:58] them into their inheritance there was an
[56:00] absolute hallelujah he had a meeting
[56:02] with God
[56:04] many people who had the same words he
[56:06] heard it didn't speak to them because
[56:08] the condition of the land outweighed was
[56:11] the promise that God gave through Moses
[56:13] hallelujah like it all look how big the
[56:15] enemy is we had grasshoppers in their
[56:18] sight
[56:18] that's not recorded they asked him at we
[56:20] grasshoppers that was there that was
[56:22] their information because the problem
[56:24] was they still had a slave mentality
[56:26] right they came out of Egypt but they
[56:28] weren't free of slavery and that's many
[56:30] times people come out of the world
[56:32] they're still slaves to the enemy
[56:34] they're still slaves to the devil amen
[56:37] we don't want to have a slave mentality
[56:39] God has not called us to be slaves
[56:43] slaves of a memory that's what they were
[56:47] there were slaves of a memory they
[56:49] taskmasters got drowned they weren't
[56:52] living in Egypt anymore they were dead
[56:55] where's the one that gave you those
[56:57] wounds he's facedown in the Red Sea how
[57:00] Louie's dead their enemy was dead but
[57:03] yet and their mind they were still
[57:05] captive to their past
[57:06] amen but caleb was not captive to us
[57:10] past he was captives to his future to
[57:12] has expected end hallelujah so he could
[57:17] stand there against those other against
[57:19] those other spies season numbers 13 now
[57:25] we all don't wait we're full we go there
[57:27] we'll follow something the Atheist
[57:30] follows Darwin or Dawkins or whoever it
[57:33] is the intellectual Giants you know
[57:35] people follow religious figures people
[57:38] follow celebrity everyone follow it
[57:40] something everyone says no I'm my own
[57:42] man I'll follow my own tech now you're
[57:44] influenced by something there's
[57:46] something in life will influence you and
[57:48] you'll dress a certain way because you
[57:49] see it somewhere you'll live a certain
[57:51] life because you see it somewhere I mean
[57:53] you'll believe a certain thing because
[57:54] you see it somewhere that's just
[57:56] shifting sands everyone is led by
[57:58] something what are you led by what are
[58:01] you led by that's why we'll ask you
[58:02] because if we have a real absolute that
[58:05] means we have met God for ourselves
[58:07] that is the absolute talking about where
[58:09] God has come down spoken to you you have
[58:12] had a personal meeting with the Almighty
[58:14] and he's come to anoint his word in your
[58:16] life Amen that you
[58:17] fulfill the promise of the H hallelujah
[58:20] Joshua Caleb's Caleb's life was to fill
[58:23] the promise of the age where God
[58:25] prophesied to Abraham your seed will be
[58:28] done in this land for hundred years but
[58:31] after that I'll deliver them with a
[58:32] mighty hand and they'll come back to
[58:33] this place again and caleb was there to
[58:36] manifest that prophecy hallelujah that's
[58:40] what we're called to do that's what ends
[58:41] when you meet the absolute Jesus Christ
[58:43] he said to anoint his word in your life
[58:45] that you live out the promise for you
[58:49] amen
[58:50] right so it's more than just an
[58:52] experience that experience will take you
[58:55] and you'll manifest the promise for your
[58:57] age hallelujah I'm so glad we have an
[59:01] absolute I'm so glad we know the
[59:03] absolute hallelujah God has the final
[59:07] say God always has the final say men can
[59:10] say what they want people can say what
[59:12] they want but then when God comes down
[59:14] that's different when God says this is
[59:17] me that's different
[59:18] amen Caleb was in Egypt he saw the
[59:22] plagues full I'm just gonna go Rebekah
[59:24] through this again he he saw the death
[59:26] angel come he saw the Red Sea part he
[59:29] came to Mount Sinai he heard Moses
[59:31] preach like the other spies did but it
[59:34] anchored in a soul hallelujah he had a
[59:37] meeting with God and that's what it has
[59:39] to be and we can go through all the way
[59:42] down through the Scriptures where God
[59:43] sends a prophet God sends a ministry a
[59:46] mentor and and the believer it's more
[59:48] than that person speaking to them that
[59:50] God takes a voice God takes some vocal
[59:53] chords spritzers word for something in
[59:55] their souls gripped by that word and the
[59:58] whole life has now chained to that word
[1:00:00] hallelujah amen Jesus spake a lot of
[1:00:04] words many people heard us preaching
[1:00:07] many people were gathered there's a few
[1:00:09] that caught it there's a few that caught
[1:00:12] it they were gripped hallelujah and we
[1:00:15] want to be in that category now it says
[1:00:20] in numbers 1325 and they and there we
[1:00:24] let's just read down here and they
[1:00:27] returned from searching of the land
[1:00:29] after 40 days and they went and came to
[1:00:31] my
[1:00:32] - Aaron into all the congregation of the
[1:00:34] children of Israel unto the wilderness
[1:00:37] of paran - Kadish and brought back word
[1:00:40] unto them and unto all the congregation
[1:00:43] and showed them the fruit of the land
[1:00:45] and they found him and and said we came
[1:00:49] unto the land whither thou sent us and
[1:00:51] surely it Floyd with milk and honey and
[1:00:53] this is the fruit of it nevertheless the
[1:00:58] people be strong that dwell in the land
[1:00:59] in the cities a walled and very great
[1:01:03] and moreover we saw the children of anak
[1:01:05] Leah the Amalekites dwell on the land of
[1:01:08] the south and the Hittites and the
[1:01:09] jebusites the Emirates dwell in the
[1:01:11] mountains and the Canaanites dwell by
[1:01:13] the sea and by the coast of Jordan his
[1:01:17] Caleb now Caleb's tied to something he
[1:01:19] hears an absolute so you got to see this
[1:01:22] this has to be personal you want to have
[1:01:25] an absolute in your life more than going
[1:01:27] with the crowd more than going with your
[1:01:29] family more than going with society but
[1:01:32] you can stand God anchors his word in
[1:01:34] your soul come what may I'm following
[1:01:37] you Lord I'm going all the way
[1:01:39] hallelujah and Caleb still the people
[1:01:42] before Moses said let us go up at once
[1:01:44] and possess it for we are able to
[1:01:47] overcome it but the men that went up
[1:01:50] with them said we are not able to go up
[1:01:51] against the people for they are stronger
[1:01:53] than we Caleb didn't bow to their
[1:01:57] pressure because now they came a point
[1:02:00] because God used Moses to deliver them
[1:02:03] out of Egypt they didn't have to do
[1:02:05] anything
[1:02:05] I mean God plagued Egypt God open the
[1:02:09] Red Sea they don't have to do anything
[1:02:11] but now they came a point where they had
[1:02:12] to put their hand they had to pick up
[1:02:15] the word for themselves right they had
[1:02:17] to go possess the promise it was more
[1:02:19] than just them following Moses now was
[1:02:21] their time are you going to go on and
[1:02:23] take your promise are you to go take
[1:02:24] your landing you're going to take your
[1:02:26] sword kill every enemy possess your
[1:02:28] inheritance right because God said I
[1:02:30] give it to you either to go fight you've
[1:02:32] got to put your pick up the word
[1:02:33] yourself you're going to make it live
[1:02:35] the words going to come and live in you
[1:02:38] I mean it's not a it's not enough just
[1:02:40] to live through a prophet they also to
[1:02:42] come and live in your life that same God
[1:02:44] that anoint the
[1:02:45] proper to speak as to come and live in
[1:02:47] you right and they said no we can't do
[1:02:50] that you know there's a story with a man
[1:02:53] and he he's going along a high wire you
[1:02:56] know and and he's talking to someone
[1:02:59] he says do you believe I can take this
[1:03:01] wheelbarrow across absolutely you can do
[1:03:04] it and then and he talks about a few
[1:03:06] other things that you know you're on
[1:03:08] that vein then he asked the person how
[1:03:10] about you get in the wheelbarrow and
[1:03:11] then I'll take you across I'm not so
[1:03:14] sure about that because the person we're
[1:03:17] now watching say yeah sure he can do it
[1:03:19] he can do it he can take the wheelbarrow
[1:03:20] across he can do a blindfolded or
[1:03:22] whatever it was but then when the person
[1:03:24] the bystander became part of it they're
[1:03:27] like I don't know if this can be done we
[1:03:30] don't want to be like that we don't want
[1:03:32] to be like that I mean if God delivered
[1:03:34] in the beginning he delivers at the end
[1:03:35] we heard the Sunday school say Jesus
[1:03:38] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:03:39] forever amen so if we fulfilled his
[1:03:41] promise in the beginning he's sure gonna
[1:03:43] fulfill it now but he wants you to get
[1:03:46] in the wheelbarrow amen he doesn't what
[1:03:48] you used to be a bystander
[1:03:49] there's no bystanders in this age you up
[1:03:52] your participator right you're part of
[1:03:54] the program Amen now see it was more
[1:04:01] this the Ministry of Moses was more than
[1:04:06] deliverance it was more than healing it
[1:04:09] was more than the brass serpent it was
[1:04:11] more than deliverance it was more than
[1:04:13] now we have a religion that we can
[1:04:16] worship God was more than those things
[1:04:17] right it was a God speaking and it was
[1:04:23] to bring him into us at his inheritance
[1:04:25] and when he heard that word I believe it
[1:04:28] changed him from a slave or even just an
[1:04:31] Israelite with a slave mentality to one
[1:04:34] whose desire was to seek God's Word
[1:04:36] manifested in his life hallelujah a
[1:04:39] slave is always in fear even a runaway
[1:04:41] slave is in fear they sled that slave
[1:04:44] mentality but when you're free from it
[1:04:46] we're no longer slaves to sin friends
[1:04:49] we're no longer slaves to unbelief we
[1:04:51] don't have to knuckle down to the devil
[1:04:53] in his lies where did they live below
[1:04:55] our privilege right
[1:04:59] numbers 14 and 24 but my servant Caleb
[1:05:01] because he had another spirit with him
[1:05:03] and hath followed me fully him will I
[1:05:06] give him will I bring into the land
[1:05:09] where where the two he went and his seed
[1:05:11] shall possess it he had a different
[1:05:13] spirit anointing him than the other
[1:05:15] spies he had an absolute he didn't worry
[1:05:18] about what the rest of Israel wanted
[1:05:20] let's go take the land what does the
[1:05:22] promises been given
[1:05:24] I want my promise and he received it now
[1:05:32] brother Bram says in the ladies in
[1:05:34] church H he says now he has cried out in
[1:05:38] this last age you have the word you have
[1:05:40] more Bibles than ever but you are not
[1:05:42] doing anything about the word except
[1:05:44] dividing and hacking into pieces taking
[1:05:46] what you want leaving out what you don't
[1:05:48] want you're not interested in living it
[1:05:50] but debating it amen they should not be
[1:05:53] the believers heart should be Lord live
[1:05:56] come and live in my life
[1:05:58] take the word off the page in May it may
[1:06:00] become Felician me may the message
[1:06:03] become more than just tapes and books
[1:06:04] God's not going to rapture tapes and
[1:06:06] books and Bibles guidance get a rapture
[1:06:09] a living people filled with himself amen
[1:06:12] the Bible is going to stay here the
[1:06:13] message will stay here I'm in the books
[1:06:15] and tapes they will stay here God's not
[1:06:17] going to take them to heaven he's going
[1:06:19] to take people that are full of him
[1:06:20] where that word comes off the comes off
[1:06:22] the tape comes off the Bibles manifested
[1:06:25] and a people that's how he's taking
[1:06:26] that's why should be Lord come and live
[1:06:28] come and manifest your character come
[1:06:31] and make your abode with me Alleluia so
[1:06:36] Caleb faced opposition ready God has
[1:06:39] promised he was anchored friends
[1:06:41] he wasn't swayed by the other spies and
[1:06:43] by the conditions he didn't deny that
[1:06:46] there were giants in the land in the
[1:06:47] fence cities and all those things but he
[1:06:49] wasn't looking at that he had an
[1:06:50] absolute he had an absolute I meant that
[1:06:54] land belongs to me whatever's built
[1:06:56] there's got to go
[1:06:57] hallelujah amen he had opposition now
[1:07:02] Mary you know he's a little girl of
[1:07:06] Nazareth she's like probably any other
[1:07:09] girl but in the differences an angel
[1:07:12] comes to her
[1:07:12] where Isaiah nine and six becomes more
[1:07:15] than just a scripture that's read at the
[1:07:17] synagogue but it becomes a living
[1:07:18] reality brother Brahim says that you
[1:07:21] know he dramatizes many times just to
[1:07:23] make it but more alive
[1:07:24] he says you one day the rabbi felt
[1:07:27] inspired to read Isaiah 9 and 6 I mean
[1:07:30] in read you know a virgin shall conceive
[1:07:31] and she was sitting in the congregation
[1:07:34] that day and something gripped her your
[1:07:37] differently than it had then it had in
[1:07:39] the past
[1:07:40] hallelujah it's because she didn't know
[1:07:43] that she was part of the prophecy she
[1:07:45] was the predestinated worm she was the
[1:07:47] one that would carry Emmanuel hallelujah
[1:07:50] and she heard that word and something
[1:07:51] struck her and she went and they whoever
[1:07:53] her and Joseph we'd had talked about it
[1:07:55] later but but it moved her hallelujah
[1:07:58] and then she was going about her daily
[1:07:59] life and she was going through brother
[1:08:01] branches like a narrow kind of
[1:08:02] passageway and a man standing there
[1:08:04] about six foot tall olive complexion
[1:08:06] here down to about here saying Hail Mary
[1:08:08] and she begins to think how do you know
[1:08:10] my name and then he begins to say you're
[1:08:13] going to be found with child and the
[1:08:15] child's going to be conceived in you by
[1:08:17] the Holy Ghost and she she just has
[1:08:19] questions how's this going to happen I
[1:08:21] don't know a man how's this going to be
[1:08:23] but you heard the scripture a little
[1:08:24] while before and Agrippa and now it's
[1:08:27] going to become flesh and she just says
[1:08:28] let it be unto me according to thy word
[1:08:30] many virgins heard that prophecy for the
[1:08:34] hundreds of years after Isaiah yo was
[1:08:36] released through the prophet Isaiah many
[1:08:38] many dads no doubt said my daughter's
[1:08:41] going to be that daughter
[1:08:42] hallelujah she's going to be the one
[1:08:44] that's going to bring them a sight to
[1:08:45] the earth but Mary was the one
[1:08:47] hallelujah and I trust us the same thing
[1:08:50] with you I mean when you put on you push
[1:08:52] plane you just hear with your good
[1:08:55] morning friends good evening friend so
[1:08:57] happy to be here I'm going to you know
[1:08:58] and something just moves on you I mean
[1:09:01] it speaks to you but more than just you
[1:09:03] know other other religion other services
[1:09:06] whatever maybe God comes and speaks to
[1:09:08] you hallelujah where the promise becomes
[1:09:11] more than just a nice idea Amen but it
[1:09:14] becomes a living reality this word
[1:09:17] should grip us this word should grip us
[1:09:20] I mean brother arm says his three pulls
[1:09:22] the pull pulls you in how long it should
[1:09:25] be a drawing
[1:09:26] I mean we were drugged towards the hello
[1:09:28] Jesus hallelujah it became a no but it
[1:09:32] became a life to her she made an angel
[1:09:35] no one could talk her out of it she made
[1:09:37] an angel hallelujah and the thing is not
[1:09:41] everyone was rejoicing no one else saw
[1:09:43] the angel Joseph was troubled what do
[1:09:46] you mean he would have seen the
[1:09:47] pregnancy signs begin to you know and
[1:09:51] they would have had a conversation it
[1:09:53] wouldn't it wouldn't have been an easy
[1:09:55] conversation you can see by his response
[1:09:58] you know Joseph would I say well I'm
[1:10:01] gonna have to say so Mary what's
[1:10:04] happened well honey you know I love you
[1:10:07] I met an angel that was hard from the
[1:10:13] stomach no one else had the testimony no
[1:10:17] one else was there she only had the
[1:10:19] testimony right and he was troubled by
[1:10:22] it and then he you know no doubt he
[1:10:25] prayed he knew that Mary was a good good
[1:10:27] woman in that same angel came to him in
[1:10:30] a dream and now they both have the
[1:10:32] testimony but now I want you to know
[1:10:34] who's going to believe it
[1:10:36] who's gonna believe it imagine if there
[1:10:39] was about a 16 year old girl comes to
[1:10:41] church imagine if we're back in that day
[1:10:43] we're going to have a testimony meeting
[1:10:46] well praise the Lord I mean an angel you
[1:10:52] know you know this baby bump I actually
[1:10:53] met an angel and a lot of people would
[1:10:55] say you're right you're right
[1:10:59] you think you're that one you should be
[1:11:03] in Jerusalem or some other place what
[1:11:05] family did you come out of she's saying
[1:11:07] praise the Lord I made an angel and many
[1:11:10] would say no you probably meet some
[1:11:12] slick a devil you got to put yourself
[1:11:15] there you got to put yourself there
[1:11:17] she made an angel you know everyone
[1:11:21] wasn't rejoicing as I said he when
[1:11:24] Joseph was troubled by the whole thing
[1:11:25] and then now Jesus has a black name a
[1:11:30] dark name you're an illegitimate child
[1:11:32] history says that she was impregnated by
[1:11:34] some soldier that's what history is
[1:11:37] trying to put on the put on the birth of
[1:11:39] Jesus Christ
[1:11:40] right but there she says I made an angel
[1:11:45] hallelujah and the thing is she brought
[1:11:47] forth the Messiah amen
[1:11:50] it didn't matter what others said about
[1:11:52] it this is why you've got to have an
[1:11:54] absolute I mean it doesn't matter what
[1:11:56] other people say about it
[1:11:58] she was the fulfillment of the prophecy
[1:12:00] right she was a fulfillment of the word
[1:12:02] and that's what made it an absolute to
[1:12:04] her hallelujah amen Jesus never shook
[1:12:09] that name right she comes into the
[1:12:13] temple brother brems says about it when
[1:12:15] when when Jesus being dinner caddies
[1:12:17] wrapped up in swaddling clothes and he's
[1:12:19] all the other woman there to dedicate
[1:12:20] their babies and and he's and he says
[1:12:23] it's like there's like a gap between her
[1:12:25] and the rest of all the other woman cuz
[1:12:27] no wants to be near her because she's
[1:12:28] got a bad name to begin with hallelujah
[1:12:31] she's carrying Emmanuel no now sees it
[1:12:33] in but then but then Simeon comes in
[1:12:37] because the Lord's told her God directs
[1:12:39] his children God directs his children
[1:12:41] hallelujah Simeon comes and picks up the
[1:12:43] child Lord now I can depart in peace
[1:12:45] that I've seen thy salvation
[1:12:47] hallelujah dim blind enter the
[1:12:49] prophetess comes in she's stone blind
[1:12:51] but she can see way more than the rest
[1:12:53] of the people in that place hallelujah
[1:12:56] she's led to the Messiah amen
[1:13:00] they head it to begin with she only had
[1:13:05] the teeth but she met the angel right
[1:13:07] she met an angel of God hallelujah no
[1:13:13] she had an absolute the Apostle Paul the
[1:13:19] Apostle Paul was thinking about this
[1:13:21] last night everything about him was
[1:13:23] against what God was doing in that day
[1:13:25] his whole energies was against it amen
[1:13:30] his whole energies he got writings from
[1:13:33] the high priest whatever to go to
[1:13:35] Damascus and find any of these
[1:13:37] Christians by your Banamine chains and
[1:13:39] bring them back his whole energies is
[1:13:41] we're going to destroy this thing he had
[1:13:44] learned about God he was a Pharisee of
[1:13:47] the Pharisees he could quote the Old
[1:13:49] Testament pretty good I believe but he
[1:13:52] didn't have an absolute
[1:13:54] his absolute was man's teaching from
[1:13:57] gamellia that was his that's what he put
[1:14:00] his whole life on traditions this is
[1:14:03] what the school tells me this is like I
[1:14:05] passed my exams I've gave you know you
[1:14:08] know I've I've I've set my learning I've
[1:14:10] got my degrees that was his absolute
[1:14:12] that's not what God wants us to have he
[1:14:15] wants us to have a personal meeting with
[1:14:16] him right and that because when he was
[1:14:19] on the road to Damascus amen
[1:14:22] he met the God of the Old Testament I
[1:14:24] mean he met that came down a light shone
[1:14:26] about him he has a voice Christ Saul
[1:14:29] Saul why are you persecuting why
[1:14:31] persecutest thou me what was happening
[1:14:33] the god II he learnt about with a mental
[1:14:36] conception and a debate became a reality
[1:14:40] amen and we need that kind of meeting I
[1:14:43] mean we need that kind of an absolute
[1:14:45] where you meet the meet the god of the
[1:14:48] word I mean that's what this message is
[1:14:50] true to introduce the god of the word
[1:14:52] brother brand was baptizing on their
[1:14:55] high River and the pillar of fire came
[1:14:57] down and a voice it is John the Baptist
[1:14:59] forerun the first coming of Christ your
[1:15:01] message will forerun the second and I
[1:15:03] believe that this message is introduced
[1:15:05] us of Jesus Christ the word hallelujah
[1:15:08] see the world's looking from to come
[1:15:10] back with now scarred hands will meet
[1:15:13] that one will meet him physically in the
[1:15:15] air right but as spirits come upon upon
[1:15:17] the earth together people to himself
[1:15:21] hallelujah you go read the you read john
[1:15:24] 14 in my houses many mansions yeah I
[1:15:28] mean in my father's houses many mansions
[1:15:29] if we're not so I've told you I do I go
[1:15:32] to prepare a place for you that where I
[1:15:34] am there you'll be also right where he
[1:15:38] is in heaven and if I go into if I go to
[1:15:41] prepare a place we all come again and
[1:15:43] receive you to myself hallelujah we're
[1:15:46] living in that scripture this word has
[1:15:49] come to receive you I mean to receive
[1:15:51] you to himself there you'll be taken
[1:15:53] away up into glory hallelujah now the
[1:16:00] Apostle Paul he met the Lord on the road
[1:16:04] to Damascus and his whole life was
[1:16:07] changed
[1:16:08] I prayed this is more than a story when
[1:16:10] you read the book of X when you read the
[1:16:11] Apostle Paul's life I pray it's more
[1:16:13] than a story I remember you can say that
[1:16:16] same God that he met I know I met the
[1:16:19] same one amen
[1:16:21] it has to be that way he says this in
[1:16:26] the absolute as well as in Houston he
[1:16:29] says now Paul here as we see here an
[1:16:31] absolute then he held to all of his life
[1:16:34] after his conversion
[1:16:35] there was a christ-centered life and
[1:16:38] what a place to have an absolute a
[1:16:40] christ-centered life it was a different
[1:16:43] life than what he had lived at one time
[1:16:46] that's a good that's a good and good
[1:16:48] indication if you've met the absolute if
[1:16:50] you meet the living word you'll see your
[1:16:53] life has been changed and he said their
[1:16:55] life I now live which was different from
[1:16:57] the one he had lived and there came a
[1:17:00] time when the Apostle Paul had this
[1:17:02] experience that brought him to this
[1:17:04] decision for Paul was a mighty man among
[1:17:07] the Jews a great theologian but he he
[1:17:10] wasn't too sure of his standing but one
[1:17:12] day on the road down to Damascus a light
[1:17:14] pillar of fire came down from heaven and
[1:17:17] Paul being a Jew was acquainted with
[1:17:19] that light pillar of fire that had been
[1:17:21] the thing that God had led his people
[1:17:23] out of Egypt they followed this pillar
[1:17:25] of fire so being a Jew he came to them
[1:17:28] quickly Lord who art thou he knew him as
[1:17:31] Lord but who art thou and the voice came
[1:17:35] back from the pillar of fire I'm Jesus
[1:17:36] and it's hard for you to kick against
[1:17:38] the pricks from that time on Paul knew
[1:17:41] that Jehovah of the Old Testament was
[1:17:43] Jesus of the new and he had something
[1:17:45] that he could hold to and that's how he
[1:17:48] could write this that great book of
[1:17:50] Hebrews now in your life you have to
[1:17:53] have it absolute amen you do things
[1:17:57] ordinarily you would not do especially
[1:17:59] if you have a god-centered life that God
[1:18:03] centered life makes a person do things
[1:18:06] that ordinarily they would not do very
[1:18:08] odd peculiar why as a Christian so odd
[1:18:11] and peculiar it's because they are
[1:18:13] looking to God's Word which has almost
[1:18:15] forgotten to the world today now we have
[1:18:18] churches we have organizations we have
[1:18:20] religion so much
[1:18:21] around the world and my seven times
[1:18:23] around since I was here with you at
[1:18:25] Houston
[1:18:27] I'm accumulated much knowledge on the
[1:18:29] gods and religions of this world but
[1:18:31] that isn't what I'm talking about I'm
[1:18:32] talking about an absolute connecting
[1:18:34] with Christ makes you an odd person you
[1:18:36] do odd things your thinking is
[1:18:38] altogether different than the thinking
[1:18:40] you once did
[1:18:41] amen because you have found something
[1:18:43] that you've anchored a faith in someone
[1:18:46] that created heavens on earth that has
[1:18:48] very word itself is creative and God who
[1:18:51] spoke the world into existence and
[1:18:53] there's nothing too hard for him I mean
[1:18:55] so it makes you creative yourself
[1:18:57] because you take his word and a word of
[1:18:59] the thought Express now Paul had got
[1:19:02] into that state to where that he had not
[1:19:04] a theological experience altogether but
[1:19:07] he had a personal witness he had met God
[1:19:10] and knew that that he was called of God
[1:19:14] and nobody had to tell him anything
[1:19:15] about it
[1:19:16] he was absolutely sure that God still
[1:19:19] remained God if the world could just do
[1:19:21] that if this group tonight I say this
[1:19:24] morning City he could just remember that
[1:19:26] God is still God he's just as able to
[1:19:28] answer in this case as he is in case of
[1:19:31] divine healing or anything else he's
[1:19:33] still God and if we can build our hopes
[1:19:35] not on not only our hopes but our
[1:19:38] positive thought upon what he says and
[1:19:40] we know that it is the truth and people
[1:19:43] act funny they seem just to forget about
[1:19:45] the negative side because they've found
[1:19:47] an absolute because it's the Word of God
[1:19:50] Jesus said him as an earth will pass
[1:19:52] away but my word cannot fail so if
[1:19:55] you've got the word of promise then
[1:19:57] there's no failing to it it cannot fail
[1:20:01] hallelujah the Apostle Paul had an
[1:20:04] absolute you go see his life he didn't
[1:20:07] have an easy road right shipwrecked
[1:20:10] beaten you know Imperial is robbed
[1:20:13] stoned people wanted to kill him
[1:20:16] all different kinds of things going on
[1:20:18] he says none of these things move me
[1:20:19] he's in peril of false brethren all
[1:20:22] different kinds of things but he had an
[1:20:23] absolute he met the God of the Bible
[1:20:27] hallelujah and that made him stand true
[1:20:29] and then he comes to the end of his Road
[1:20:32] you're near the end of his Road when he
[1:20:34] speed to King
[1:20:35] gripper knee and he's relating many
[1:20:36] years after the road to domestic
[1:20:38] experience and he gives the account of
[1:20:40] it he says I was not disobedient to the
[1:20:42] heavenly vision amen
[1:20:44] and he didn't have an easy rope he says
[1:20:46] I was not disobedient to the heavenly
[1:20:47] vision friends we've received a heavenly
[1:20:50] vision I mean this word is a heavenly
[1:20:52] version I mean for a for a bride to walk
[1:20:54] and step with the word I mean to become
[1:20:56] one with us with her bridegroom to walk
[1:20:59] up into glory hallelujah
[1:21:03] now this parent an absolute very
[1:21:06] absolute as Jesus Christ amen
[1:21:09] he will produce what his word promises
[1:21:12] to produce right you got to look at now
[1:21:15] the life that is manifested by believers
[1:21:17] right even even the scribes and
[1:21:21] Pharisees and the Sanhedrin when they
[1:21:23] brought the Apostles in before them and
[1:21:25] tried to say don't preach in his name
[1:21:26] anymore
[1:21:27] it says but they knew that they had been
[1:21:29] with Jesus the same life that was in
[1:21:31] Jesus wasn't them right and now try to
[1:21:34] say this is false doctrine this is wrong
[1:21:36] yo stop doing this you got off in the
[1:21:38] deep end but they knew that there was a
[1:21:40] life isn't that they could see that the
[1:21:42] life and Jesus was in them hallelujah
[1:21:46] amen the Apostles had an absolute Peter
[1:21:49] Brock buckled under pressure Jesus is in
