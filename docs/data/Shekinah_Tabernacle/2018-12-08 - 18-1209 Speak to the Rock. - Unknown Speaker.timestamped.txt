[21:41] must all the musicians was brother Andy
[21:44] taking Sunday school praise the Lord
[21:49] does he have any young testimonies or
[21:51] something on the Hat we're gonna extract
[21:54] one this morning at least one
[21:59] don't make me point fingers probably'd
[22:11] bless you Saints just a quick one I was
[22:15] standing here I think it was last
[22:16] Wednesday maybe last Sunday and I just
[22:21] dawned on me the true definition of
[22:24] undefeated but I have to come outside
[22:28] the topper to show you because you've
[22:32] got two feet and there's under that feet
[22:34] in this under that feed you undefeated
[22:38] the devil is undefeated we we are
[22:41] undefeated because the devil is under
[22:43] our feet undefeated I mean you'll never
[22:53] think of that word again ever ever
[22:55] that's it it's done under our feet do
[23:00] you mean Amy that was that one you no
[23:07] one else said why not should we just
[23:08] move on oh it's a Brahman
[23:18] actually I just think about subtle this
[23:20] morning because you know with the um
[23:21] probably most of you saw yesterday we
[23:23] had a big gang presents the side that
[23:25] way and this one that way and there was
[23:27] shootings last night in there and I just
[23:29] thought how so many people in our
[23:31] community are living in fear and these
[23:34] people in fear today you know thinking
[23:35] about yesterday or people walk around
[23:37] and they have fear and there's different
[23:38] things and I was thinking all the devil
[23:40] has to offer you know and people fight
[23:42] for him and you know all it offers and I
[23:44] was thinking about how blessed we are
[23:45] and what we fight for and in what we
[23:48] have and I was just thinking about the
[23:50] play actually and I was thinking what a
[23:52] blessing it is because we're going to
[23:53] invite our whole community and you never
[23:54] know there's people that you know there
[23:56] and stuck in these horrible places and
[23:58] these horrible situations in our
[23:59] community and I was thinking they might
[24:02] just come you know and they might
[24:03] actually they will they will hear the
[24:05] truth though hear the words of eternal
[24:07] life and they'll see that cierra living
[24:09] truth and men you never know they might
[24:11] there's this one house and Stokes valley
[24:14] you know there's one place that people
[24:15] could come that's a safe house you know
[24:17] and it's actually like a Goshen in the
[24:20] middle of this horrible thing that
[24:21] happens up and down the street you know
[24:23] in these horrible situations and the
[24:25] Lord's here and I was thinking man then
[24:27] from that play you never know that the
[24:28] Lord might just actually draw some
[24:30] children this little light of mine I'm
[24:38] going through this shining if you got do
[24:40] you have one brother okay it's like that
[24:45] you kind of get it started and then
[24:46] you've got to eventually try and stop it
[24:48] I praise the Lord
[25:00] just on that sister Bronwyn has touched
[25:02] something that happened recently and my
[25:05] boys will be witness to this under my
[25:09] feet so we the Bride of Christ we walk
[25:14] on this earth but sometimes how we this
[25:17] is at Easter might happen we went to the
[25:18] skate park and we were just skating the
[25:20] on the skate park and there were some
[25:22] young people coming around and they
[25:25] started skating in amongst us and and
[25:28] they were swearing because the young
[25:29] people do and kind of being just
[25:30] disrespectful and you you lived with the
[25:33] thing is do you say something or do you
[25:35] not say something you approach these
[25:37] people because your kids are they and
[25:39] stuff you know and and how do you go
[25:40] about it because a lot of thing that
[25:42] happened with the Bride of Christ is is
[25:43] we want to show God but we don't always
[25:46] wanted to say it as it is because we
[25:48] skate we might shake someone off you
[25:50] know like keep them away from the Lord
[25:52] or keep them to to to curse at the Lord
[25:57] which we don't want to do we don't want
[25:58] to ski somewhere away from the Lord we
[26:00] want to get them closer and so I was
[26:02] skating and I heard the the swear words
[26:04] going on and I thought you know what
[26:06] other right as a Christian to go up to
[26:08] these people and just ask them please
[26:10] don't do it
[26:11] what they do with that is up to them on
[26:13] the Lord and that's between them and the
[26:15] Lord but I'm gonna go up in anyway and
[26:17] just and just tell them sorry I scared
[26:19] it up and stop next to the guy almost
[26:20] wiped out next to him I couldn't get up
[26:22] quick enough but and so as I was there
[26:25] he saw me I'm kind of falling I said
[26:27] anyway listen sorry I almost wiped that
[26:28] view but I just want to ask you a nice
[26:29] thing you know my kids are young and and
[26:32] I know you guys you know you're swearing
[26:34] a bit and stuff which you just might not
[26:36] swearing because they don't need to hear
[26:38] that and he and he straightened me
[26:40] apologize to said you know what I'm very
[26:42] very sorry and we won't do it again and
[26:44] they really tried not to do it again and
[26:46] then they went on and they skate and
[26:48] they were really nice around the boys as
[26:50] well but she had to do something to make
[26:53] him just see that that maybe what I'm
[26:55] doing is wrong so it wasn't judging this
[26:57] the sinner it was just judging the sin
[26:59] and and because you approached him with
[27:01] love you had a reaction then later on
[27:04] they was there was five gang guys that
[27:07] came in like like gang
[27:08] the type of guys you know all in a
[27:10] huddle with bicycles and they started
[27:11] intimidating these boys that worthy
[27:13] because now all of a sudden it went from
[27:16] an ice skate park to this is my domain
[27:18] and now me and the boys are just skating
[27:20] around they witness to this and we just
[27:22] go on like we always do another stage
[27:24] you could see every day was this
[27:26] atmosphere something happened something
[27:28] changed this is not holy and fun and
[27:30] nice anymore now this is something going
[27:32] on you and the young people that was the
[27:35] first started feeling real uncomfortable
[27:36] and they they started leaving
[27:38] but then again I'm I'm just sitting here
[27:40] thinking but there is more to this that
[27:42] meets the eye
[27:44] so I skated up to that guy and I stopped
[27:47] right next to him and I say these words
[27:49] are you local and he goes yeah yeah I'm
[27:52] local I said my name is Almonte what's
[27:53] your name and he gave me his name when
[27:56] he says what was his name Ruben a Denis
[27:58] is all my name is Aidan I said hey Aidan
[28:00] how you doing and and I made all five of
[28:02] the other guys that were there just for
[28:04] mischief and I started but but because I
[28:07] disarmed them I didn't like the devil
[28:09] get rain over that because cause what
[28:11] happens is these are atmosphere bolt and
[28:13] then it's not us against you type of
[28:15] thing instead of just saying listen
[28:16] we're all in the same boat we all live
[28:18] in this earth I just want to tell you
[28:19] it's more to this first it meets the eye
[28:22] so instead of going to say hey you guys
[28:24] are making trouble and get out of you
[28:25] and stuff like that which you you can't
[28:27] do if you want I just went in Greek to
[28:29] them and say what is your name cuz god
[28:31] kid so when I was in the world he came
[28:34] and see what is your name and then he
[28:36] started talking to me and so five
[28:39] minutes later they leave you know and
[28:41] everything turned into peace and this is
[28:44] what the bride can do we don't need to
[28:46] to come and review people too tightly
[28:48] wrong and they right we just stand on
[28:49] the word and we just go anyways and God
[28:52] will do the race and for me it opened up
[28:55] because sometimes because you guys know
[28:56] I get very spirit that sometimes you
[28:59] kind of want to attack the sinner in the
[29:01] Sun at the same time instead of just
[29:03] speaking to him like a normal person and
[29:05] let God do the work so yeah if that's
[29:08] the only revelation about this last week
[29:10] that's that's it glory to God
[29:16] I'm impressible to like it it's good
[29:20] amen let some stand and sing just a few
[29:24] worship songs this morning just to
[29:26] change the atmosphere slightly before
[29:28] our brother Ben comes up to minister
[29:30] well start with this one we don't sing
[29:32] it too often but I think we all most of
[29:34] us know this one it's called um

[49:51] about this morning speaking to the rock
[49:54] now you know we have you know I was
[49:57] listening and will and we'll get into it
[49:59] but you know brother Brown speaks about
[50:00] the you know he speaks about a broken
[50:02] systems about how you know we don't just
[50:05] have a local revival but we have a
[50:07] revival that's unending it's not just
[50:09] that's filled with local rains eurotech
[50:11] that sort of range but we have the
[50:13] fountain of living water gushing forth
[50:15] and there's a force and the believer I
[50:17] trust is a force of the Holy Spirit you
[50:18] water is pouring out life was pouring
[50:21] out you can't contain it you can't stop
[50:23] it it just comes hallelujah and I thank
[50:26] you that we have a rock you know King
[50:28] David it's amazing when you just search
[50:29] through the scripture and you and you
[50:31] look about where you're how many times
[50:33] that the believer would obscure to God
[50:36] being a rock and he would say we just
[50:39] got a few I don't have it on me on the
[50:40] slides but and and second Samuel 22 and
[50:43] 2 I'm just going to go through these
[50:44] quickly he would say you know now David
[50:46] we know he knew what trouble was he knew
[50:48] what hardship was he knew what being in
[50:50] a very tight situation where life and
[50:53] death was there yeah he knew what it was
[50:54] like to be in distress but he knew was
[50:56] like to have a rock I mean to have a
[50:59] shield to have a defense you know ever
[51:01] with a god that would anoint him that he
[51:03] would fulfill the word for his day and
[51:05] so in second Samuel 22 and 2 he said and
[51:08] he said the Lord is my rock and my
[51:10] fortress and my deliverer the Lord the
[51:12] God of my rock and him will I trust he
[51:14] is my shield and the Horn of my
[51:16] salvation my high tower and my refuge my
[51:19] Savior they'll say with me from violence
[51:21] David you what it's like to you know
[51:24] being violent times second Samuel 22
[51:27] down 32 he says for who is God save the
[51:30] Lord and who was a rock save our God the
[51:33] Lord liveth and blessed be my rock and
[51:36] exalted be the god of the rock of my
[51:38] salvation the God of Israel said the
[51:41] rock of Israel spake to me he that
[51:44] ruleth over men must be just ruling in
[51:47] the fear of God holy and in Psalms 27
[51:50] and 5 from the time of trouble we know
[51:52] this is from the rapture you know the
[51:53] tick's that brother bran would preach
[51:54] the rapture message on you know Sam's 27
[51:58] and 5 from the time of trouble he shall
[51:59] hide me in his provision in the secret
[52:02] place of his Tabernacle shall he hide me
[52:04] he shall set me up upon a rock
[52:06] hallelujah
[52:07] Psalm 28 and one unto thee will I cry O
[52:12] Lord my rock be not silent to me lest if
[52:15] thou be silent to me I've become like
[52:16] him that go down into the pit Psalm 40
[52:19] and verse 2 he brought me up also out of
[52:22] a horrible pit out of the miry clay and
[52:24] set my feet upon a rock and established
[52:26] my goings hallelujah so now we can we
[52:30] can just see from these scriptures you
[52:31] know we know understand that God in
[52:34] order for God to be our rock he must be
[52:36] a revelation to us because Peter was
[52:38] young jesus said to Peter upon this rock
[52:41] upon the revelation of who I am I trust
[52:43] these things are not common to you I
[52:45] mean but the the river
[52:47] of Who I am and in the season that
[52:49] you're alive upon this rock I will build
[52:51] my church so there's a rock as a firm
[52:53] foundation it's not sand it will not
[52:55] move according to storms or or troubles
[52:59] but it's a firm foundation where Jesus
[53:01] would give the parable of yo yo you know
[53:04] the man who built his house upon a rock
[53:06] but in that probably says he dug down
[53:08] until he found the rock and then he
[53:10] built this house you didn't just say
[53:11] well there's rock somewhere he dug down
[53:13] got rid of the dirt and the soil
[53:15] whatever maybe the loose sand and stones
[53:18] and then when he hit bedrock holier then
[53:21] he cleared off the bedrock he built his
[53:22] house and then the storms came in the
[53:24] house was still there hallelujah
[53:27] and that's what we I'm so glad there's a
[53:29] rock I mean in this weary land we're
[53:32] living in the presence of the rock you
[53:33] know I was moved oh just thinking about
[53:35] this Oh God
[53:37] the rock is here you're here huh Lou you
[53:40] are the rock and we're and we'll show
[53:41] you that Paul says that the that the
[53:44] rock that followed the children of
[53:46] Israel in the wilderness was Christ
[53:47] there's not just a piece of stone
[53:50] whatever whatever marble or quartz or
[53:52] whatever rock I'm not a geologist but
[53:54] you know whatever it was as Christ right
[53:56] so now it's in that parable he dug down
[53:59] till he found the rock and he built his
[54:00] house but that but the and wise man just
[54:03] builds his house this is a nice piece of
[54:05] land and then the storms came and the
[54:08] house fell and great was the destruction
[54:10] of the house we don't want to build our
[54:12] house about our lives upon the shifting
[54:14] sands of man's ideas or the shifting
[54:17] sands of culture or the shifting sands
[54:19] of of what's acceptable we want to build
[54:21] our house upon the revelation of the
[54:24] Living Word of God for this day which is
[54:26] description right this message is the
[54:28] rock I mean where God has come down in
[54:30] the center you think this is a weary
[54:32] land there's a desert Amos 8:11 said
[54:35] that there become a famine in the land
[54:36] not for bread or water but for hearing
[54:39] the word of the Lord why see they say
[54:41] there's not a famine for Bibles or
[54:43] churches or theology but a famine would
[54:46] come for the hearing of the word of the
[54:48] God honor of the Lord the true
[54:50] interpretation of the word and many
[54:53] would run to and fro that would not find
[54:55] they would fight for thirst but I say
[54:58] thank you lord I didn't find the rock
[55:00] the rock found me hallelujah when I
[55:03] couldn't know where to go the rock found
[55:05] me and maybe we chased a lot of mirages
[55:07] you know you know on the horizon looking
[55:10] for water looking for this rock but the
[55:13] rock found you hallelujah that's why we
[55:16] can rejoice say thank you Lord you found
[55:18] me in this thing
[55:19] amen so now David you what I was like
[55:23] you know he knew his Lord was the rock
[55:26] and I'm so thankful that when it goes
[55:31] beyond just being anointed many everyone
[55:34] can be anointed but it's those
[55:35] predestinated ones God's attributes upon
[55:39] the earth they built upon the rock right
[55:41] and when it goes beyond anointing and
[55:44] the United Church you're not listening
[55:46] to your favorite preacher or your
[55:47] favorite song and you may be in just in
[55:49] the world you know going about your
[55:51] daily life but there's a rock you're
[55:52] built upon right when everything is gone
[55:55] you're there and you're upon the rock I
[55:57] mean I'm glad that we can you know I
[56:00] believe I'm looking at people that whose
[56:02] lives are built upon the rock of of the
[56:04] word in this day hallelujah that we can
[56:07] stand amen because we're build upon the
[56:10] rock now if we go to I think I put this
[56:15] on here so right here we go and we'll go
[56:19] back that's why I don't like slides cuz
[56:21] page 1 never stays page 1 page 2 becomes
[56:24] paid shipping you know just you know so
[56:28] anyway so he says moreover brethren so
[56:31] this is this is the Apostle Paul
[56:33] speaking about the children of Israel
[56:35] you know journeying from Egypt into the
[56:37] Promised Land is more of a brethren I
[56:39] would not that ye be ignorant how that
[56:42] all our fathers were under the cloud and
[56:44] all passed through the sea all were
[56:46] baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in
[56:48] the sea and did all eat the same
[56:51] spiritual meat but me and all the drink
[56:54] the same spiritual drink for they drank
[56:56] of that spiritual rock that followed
[56:58] them and that rock was Christ so he's
[57:02] saying that this rock followed them you
[57:04] think about this they journey they turn
[57:06] around there I thought that rock
[57:09] formation was back there no it's
[57:10] following
[57:11] right that's following oh yeah I mean
[57:15] wouldn't that be you know I don't know
[57:17] yeah I'll just leave that but the rock
[57:20] was Christ as more than just a rock the
[57:23] rock was Christ have followed you know
[57:25] followed them so they had this fountain
[57:28] of water followed them they didn't leave
[57:31] it it went with them now we know that
[57:34] when you know Israel they just looked to
[57:37] the natural eye they just like look like
[57:38] a bunch of ragtag people just just doing
[57:40] a migration and Moab didn't think too
[57:43] much of them you know Balaam Balaam that
[57:46] you're Moab hired Balaam to come and
[57:48] curse them and and they both had the
[57:50] same alters Balaam and Moses had the
[57:53] same approach to God so fundamentally
[57:56] they were both believing in the same God
[57:57] they had the same worship to approach
[57:59] him but one group was staying in a bland
[58:04] they were fixed in a land Moab they
[58:07] weren't moving
[58:07] they had their borders this is our
[58:09] nation they were staying they had their
[58:10] organization they had their king natural
[58:13] king the Headley government right the
[58:15] Headley denominational system right they
[58:18] were stuck there but then suddenly but
[58:21] there was another group they didn't have
[58:23] a nation they didn't have boundaries yet
[58:25] right they were journeying but they had
[58:29] a swing Rock they had the brass serpent
[58:32] they both have prophets Balaam was a
[58:35] prophet Moses was a prophet right there
[58:37] so they bowed their prophecies you know
[58:39] they had the same approach to God but
[58:41] one group had a smitten Rock one group
[58:44] had the brass serpent one and the main
[58:46] thing that they had was the shout of a
[58:47] king was in the camp I mean the Kings
[58:49] word was there among Israel that was the
[58:52] main thing hallelujah
[58:53] so they had all that you know they had
[58:54] the Messiah walking among them bagged
[58:56] Christ right
[58:58] Moab didn't have those things and that's
[59:01] the thing we got to look at now there's
[59:04] a lot of churches around nothing against
[59:05] them but you we need to be in a place
[59:07] with a smitten rockers right with a
[59:09] brass serpent us right we're the shout
[59:12] of the king is in the cap where the word
[59:13] is present we're going to be in that
[59:15] kind of place
[59:16] amen I thank God by this message we have
[59:19] the smitten rock and then we have the
[59:21] brass serpent right it's all Christ
[59:23] right
[59:23] we have the shout of the King the Kings
[59:25] word Amen where you know with a voice of
[59:28] a king as there's life there's peace
[59:31] hallelujah amen so now the rock is
[59:34] present you know I trust that yo if this
[59:37] is all you get out of the service he's
[59:39] present you were to speak to him look
[59:42] right you can't just sit back and say
[59:44] well you know and that's why you see the
[59:45] devil always tries to silence people
[59:47] tries to make them just a piece of
[59:49] marble you know a tombstone that they
[59:52] won't speak to God that the other ways
[59:54] tries to silence you you got to speak
[59:56] and you got to speak because if
[59:59] something's going on in your life and
[1:00:00] you don't speak it forth it'll remain
[1:00:02] there and the devil takes up residence
[1:00:04] but when you expose him expose what
[1:00:07] you're going through expose the mind
[1:00:08] battle I mean that's why we should
[1:00:10] confess our faults one to another right
[1:00:13] I'm going through this and I'm going
[1:00:14] through this and you speak to a real
[1:00:16] genuine believer they don't judge you
[1:00:18] they don't push you down they don't
[1:00:19] condemn you there's something in them
[1:00:21] because it should be a liver I mean a
[1:00:22] liver you you should ever liver but a
[1:00:25] river of living water right if Christ is
[1:00:28] in you and you as a fountain of living
[1:00:31] waters right so we are all here one for
[1:00:35] another it's not necessarily what you
[1:00:37] can get us what you can give you create
[1:00:40] the atmosphere you sing your dance you
[1:00:43] shout you say Amen you pull on the word
[1:00:45] you say yes Lord
[1:00:46] Here I am to worship Here I am to praise
[1:00:48] you yeah I need to give you glory Here I
[1:00:50] am to say Amen hallelujah
[1:00:53] and atmosphere has changed amen it's not
[1:00:57] always this area the volume of the Amen
[1:00:59] but the the faith behind it I mean the
[1:01:01] pull of faith hallelujah Amen so now
[1:01:06] Allu yeah now as we where were we so
[1:01:11] Moses was commanded as the numbers 20
[1:01:14] take the rod gather there the assembly
[1:01:17] together thou and Aaron thy brother and
[1:01:20] speak ye unto the rock before their eyes
[1:01:23] and it's young and it shall go forth as
[1:01:25] water so it shall go forth his water he
[1:01:28] shall give forth as water not it Amen
[1:01:33] that's Christ
[1:01:34] hallelujah and thou shalt bring forth to
[1:01:38] them water out of the rock so thou shalt
[1:01:41] give the congregation and their Beast
[1:01:43] drink and Moses took the rod from before
[1:01:45] the Lord as he commanded them no didn't
[1:01:47] put it there but you continue reading he
[1:01:50] didn't speak to the rock he smut he he
[1:01:52] smoked the rock twice cuz you're in his
[1:01:54] anger he said you bunch of rebels tried
[1:01:56] to bring forth water for you and he said
[1:01:58] of speaking to her off he smote it twice
[1:02:00] speaking of the two crucifixions of
[1:02:02] Christ right he was crucified once in a
[1:02:06] body for our sin you know in the
[1:02:09] scripture but then the word because he
[1:02:11] is the word the word had to be crucified
[1:02:13] again and the word has been crucified in
[1:02:16] this day now when the seven seals came
[1:02:18] and when the title deed came up and that
[1:02:20] was revealing Christ and Christ udders
[1:02:22] isn't as full manifestation all the word
[1:02:24] is open brother Ram says what other
[1:02:27] seals the seals reveal Christ because
[1:02:29] Christ is the seals right you say well I
[1:02:32] thought it was horse riders and there's
[1:02:33] horse riders in this tribulation yeah
[1:02:35] and there's 144,000 but you got to see
[1:02:38] beyond that because many people can
[1:02:40] study the word say well that's the
[1:02:41] Antichrist riding forth yeah sure it is
[1:02:44] but behind that it reveals Christ right
[1:02:47] because the anointing that sent forth to
[1:02:49] combat the the the four moves of the
[1:02:52] Antichrist those anointings as the
[1:02:54] anointing God released in the age to
[1:02:56] overcome what the devil is doing and
[1:02:58] that's what you should be you're the
[1:02:59] first are mothers of the seals
[1:03:01] I saw horse riders in tribulation the
[1:03:03] next time it was different I just saw
[1:03:06] the lamb step four I saw my redeemer
[1:03:08] step four with an open word saying you
[1:03:10] belong in this word and that's why my
[1:03:12] voice has called you in this hour
[1:03:14] hallelujah
[1:03:15] hey hon you glad yeah as I see it I
[1:03:18] think last Sunday you read the word
[1:03:20] you're here message and then you hear it
[1:03:21] again and something else jumps out at
[1:03:23] you because God he's like an onion he
[1:03:27] peels back layers right it's all onion
[1:03:30] all it's all word the same way down but
[1:03:32] it gets deeper and richer and better
[1:03:34] amen yeah yeah I know that's a crude way
[1:03:38] yeah that was church he called Jesus an
[1:03:43] onion
[1:03:44] yeah I hope you get what I mean though I
[1:03:47] know it's a crude way of saying it but
[1:03:48] you just don't just look at the outside
[1:03:51] they're gone again there's always more
[1:03:55] this is eternal hallelujah and it gets
[1:03:59] richer and deeper and greater so he he
[1:04:03] actually smites the rock but in there so
[1:04:05] so now the rock smitten and water comes
[1:04:07] out so now the rock was smooth in that
[1:04:11] day on Calvary so we're so Isaiah 53
[1:04:14] where it speaks of your he was wounded
[1:04:16] for our transgressions of chastisement
[1:04:18] of our peace was upon him by His stripes
[1:04:20] we were healed there was a prophecy
[1:04:22] forward when Isaiah saw it but then its
[1:04:25] history it happened it was manifested in
[1:04:28] the flesh right so he doesn't have to be
[1:04:30] smitten again you read this you know had
[1:04:33] to smite the rock oh it's already
[1:04:35] smitten you just need to speak to your
[1:04:37] rock speak to the rock and it will bring
[1:04:40] forth what you need right speak to the
[1:04:42] rock that's why you can't just sit back
[1:04:44] and be silent no speak to him Amen speak
[1:04:47] to the rock and it will bring forth
[1:04:48] water for you if you need salvation
[1:04:51] tonight speak to the rock there's
[1:04:53] brother band speaking Redemption and
[1:04:54] completeness and enjoy he says if you
[1:04:57] need salvation tonight speak to the rock

[1:05:19] chance for you just speak to the rock
[1:05:21] and it will bring for this water you
[1:05:23] believe that with all your heart you
[1:05:25] believe that God would granted with all
[1:05:27] your heart you believe it hallelujah
[1:05:28] he's here tonight I say he's here this
[1:05:30] morning if you're sick and you've tried
[1:05:32] everything in the world you've tried to
[1:05:33] get in the prayer line you can't get in
[1:05:35] the prayer line you've had prayer cards
[1:05:37] turned down you went from one meeting to
[1:05:38] another if you've been anointed by the
[1:05:40] pastor you've gone through this prayer
[1:05:42] line you've been everywhere else and you
[1:05:44] can't get healed why don't you speak to
[1:05:46] the rock now he will bring forth his
[1:05:49] water that's right I mean the rock is
[1:05:52] present right the rock you just got to
[1:05:54] speak to him
[1:05:55] life and death ISM
[1:05:57] power of the tongue the scripture tells
[1:05:59] us now many times we think of how our
[1:06:02] tongue will affect others but your
[1:06:04] tongue will affect you right you have to
[1:06:07] take the word and you have to speak it
[1:06:09] you have to confess it it says in
[1:06:11] Revelations 12 that they overcame him
[1:06:13] there became the dragon and all of us
[1:06:15] devils and the other angels or the
[1:06:17] fallen angels they overcame him by the
[1:06:19] blood of the Lamb and by the word of
[1:06:20] their testimony that's how they overcame
[1:06:24] and those people that are written in
[1:06:26] Revelations 12 is you right because the
[1:06:28] devil's been cast down in this hour
[1:06:30] right the bottomless pits open house
[1:06:32] come upon the earth but there's a people
[1:06:35] standing up on this work on this earth
[1:06:37] and they are the Word made flesh and
[1:06:39] they overcome by the power of the blood
[1:06:41] by the blood of the Lamb and the word of
[1:06:43] their testimony so they have to start
[1:06:45] testifying of something right and they
[1:06:48] do not testify of what they see and they
[1:06:50] themselves you look in the mirror you
[1:06:52] get disappointed right let's be honest
[1:06:56] you look at yourself and it's not maybe
[1:06:58] you're aging and things are expanding
[1:07:01] necessary but you look at your character
[1:07:03] right you get disappointed and things
[1:07:05] you see and your things and you wonder
[1:07:07] why you know whatever but and then what
[1:07:13] happens as you start to you start to get
[1:07:17] focused on those things and you begin to
[1:07:19] ponder those things and your words will
[1:07:22] become flesh I mean your thoughts will
[1:07:24] become our thought our word as a thought
[1:07:26] expressed right so now you begin to
[1:07:29] think it then you'll speak it to someone
[1:07:31] and then it'll become manifested in your
[1:07:34] life
[1:07:35] someone is ways- and down-and-out they
[1:07:37] become that way it started somewhere
[1:07:39] right they weren't born that way there
[1:07:42] we have all good sides and bad sides to
[1:07:45] our character what side he gonna pander
[1:07:47] to brother Brahim had an interview with
[1:07:50] a sister Bruce and it's and it's in the
[1:07:52] message you can hear it's not very long
[1:07:53] and she's wanting to know she you know
[1:07:57] she's asking brother Branham I need you
[1:08:00] I need to find out when did I receive
[1:08:02] the Holy Ghost and she's expecting that
[1:08:05] he'll see a vision and you know point
[1:08:07] back in his life because God showed him
[1:08:09] what's been and what will happen
[1:08:11] why so it comes before you know and and
[1:08:14] and she says that interview well there's
[1:08:16] just nowhere I can put my foot on right
[1:08:17] now I met him and and and and brother
[1:08:21] Ben speaks to us is well your nature you
[1:08:24] know you get burdened for someone you
[1:08:26] pray pray pray pray until the answer
[1:08:28] comes and God uses your nature that way
[1:08:30] and the devil uses that same nature
[1:08:32] against you because we're a nature this
[1:08:35] is you know like any gift a gift can be
[1:08:38] used or a nature can be used a good way
[1:08:40] like someone who's a mercy you know God
[1:08:42] built them that way
[1:08:43] they're very merciful they want to help
[1:08:45] people but the devil can use that same
[1:08:47] nature against you right this is you
[1:08:50] know you got to know about yourself
[1:08:52] because the devil knows about you you
[1:08:54] know or someone who's a perceiver you
[1:08:56] know more that way they can see beyond
[1:08:58] and see what's going on well God can use
[1:09:00] that but then that can be used against
[1:09:02] you and the person right you got to know
[1:09:05] where to shoot right this is not carpet
[1:09:08] bombing you know you know what I mean
[1:09:12] you don't just blow everything up you
[1:09:14] know so it's like someone who can see
[1:09:15] something well you got to pray until God
[1:09:17] gives you the answer that that person
[1:09:19] can receive a way of escape you can't
[1:09:21] just say that's wrong well that doesn't
[1:09:22] help me
[1:09:22] it may be true maybe 100 percent true
[1:09:25] but you got to give a way of escape
[1:09:27] right so now sorry so so he says to her
[1:09:30] well your nature God uses you this way
[1:09:32] the devil uses you this way and she's
[1:09:34] like well I nee and she's looking for
[1:09:36] stability when did I receive it and and
[1:09:38] he just asked the question to her or one
[1:09:40] day your life was going this way and
[1:09:42] then you need turned around all you want
[1:09:45] to do is serve the Lord who did that and
[1:09:47] you hear oh she says Christ and and he
[1:09:51] says there it is there to see one day
[1:09:54] you're doing this then and then he
[1:09:57] turned you around there it is you go
[1:10:00] listen to it it's so simple sometimes we
[1:10:02] want to we're looking for something big
[1:10:03] and we've met him there's a devil you
[1:10:06] know there's the problem we have this
[1:10:08] gun and never overheat it's guided amen
[1:10:13] and it never runs out of ammo right
[1:10:16] it never does and it doesn't get here me
[1:10:18] to carry you understand but so the devil
[1:10:21] so so we're fully equipped if you have
[1:10:23] the Holy Ghost you're fully equipped
[1:10:24] to overcome the sage the whole armor of
[1:10:27] God is supernatural right and if you
[1:10:29] have you been if you've really been born
[1:10:31] again you're nature's changed you see
[1:10:33] him living out of your life
[1:10:35] overcoming every day becoming more like
[1:10:37] Ken becoming more like the word that's
[1:10:39] what I mean by to go more like him
[1:10:41] you're equipped right but then the devil
[1:10:45] tries to get it you know tries to tries
[1:10:48] to make you think no you're not even
[1:10:50] ready and then and then you get in your
[1:10:53] mind well I've got to go back to this
[1:10:55] starting position and now I've got to
[1:10:57] start all over again in some way with no
[1:10:59] the believer who's crossed Jordan who's
[1:11:03] come out of Egypt who's come out of the
[1:11:06] world who's been cleansed of the desires
[1:11:08] the things he once loved you just
[1:11:10] there's nothing in you to want it
[1:11:11] anymore and you died to yourself there's
[1:11:13] something that you had to give over
[1:11:16] hallelujah and you cross Jordan you've
[1:11:19] come into Christ right now you're in the
[1:11:21] promised land
[1:11:22] well the enemy comes against you because
[1:11:24] you still got this nature right this
[1:11:27] this is why this body's got to be
[1:11:29] changing I think that's why we're going
[1:11:30] to rejoice winners changed thank God I'm
[1:11:33] not carrying this thing around thank God
[1:11:35] that this is caught up with my soul
[1:11:37] hallelujah and so now you're in Jordan I
[1:11:40] mean I mean sir so now you're in the
[1:11:41] promised land then the enemy comes
[1:11:43] against you then sometimes I think well
[1:11:45] I've got to go back here again and back
[1:11:46] into Egypt you understand no you've got
[1:11:51] your gun you understand we asked we are
[1:11:55] undefeated
[1:11:56] we are undefeated hallelujah hey we're
[1:11:59] on defeat where wherever we are in the
[1:12:01] land
[1:12:02] we're undefeated I mean and that's why
[1:12:04] we don't just shout sing although all
[1:12:06] the promises are over Jordan oh you
[1:12:07] crossed Jordan right and now you're in
[1:12:10] the Promised Land
[1:12:11] you've got your weapon right stand on
[1:12:14] your god-given privilege don't don't go
[1:12:17] back and say well I'm not I don't have
[1:12:19] it in me to overcome the stuff he's the
[1:12:20] overcomer in you right he caused you to
[1:12:23] overcome the world because you'd
[1:12:25] overcome in the wilderness because you'd
[1:12:28] overcome yourself and cross Jordan and
[1:12:30] then you're on the promise that he's you
[1:12:32] overcome around you
[1:12:34] I'm saying this because you know the
[1:12:37] devil fights us and he's gonna kick and
[1:12:39] he's gonna kick and he's gonna kick
[1:12:41] until he burns he's gonna keep kicking
[1:12:43] and the more he kicks you should say
[1:12:45] hallelujah because he's fighting me I'm
[1:12:47] not on the side I'm not his prisoner
[1:12:49] he's kicking just kick him back how're
[1:12:53] you gonna take the word brother NGO
[1:12:54] there's a vision or a dreaming and that
[1:12:56] you know the devil is coming against
[1:12:57] someone and and and and the guys getting
[1:13:01] more scared and scared and the devil got
[1:13:02] bigger and bigger yeah and then finally
[1:13:04] he picked up the word hey just forget
[1:13:06] say boo you know and then and then
[1:13:09] everyone swore that he disappeared you
[1:13:12] gonna say boo devil you had a look who's
[1:13:14] gonna blink it's like a game of chicken

[1:13:21] yeah that's all it's old talk he's just
[1:13:23] nothing but a shadow he's nothing but a
[1:13:25] bluff right here I had to put up with
[1:13:27] anything he says I mean you've got the
[1:13:29] gun he don't never go he doesn't have a
[1:13:31] sword the Prophet said his back was
[1:13:35] broken at Calvary if you've ever seen an
[1:13:38] animal with a broken back they don't
[1:13:39] have too much control and they're in a
[1:13:41] lot of pain and their victory you think
[1:13:44] about in the scripture a day with the
[1:13:46] Lord one day with God as a thousand
[1:13:48] years upon the earth so only two days
[1:13:51] ago Jesus died and and and and Jesus
[1:13:55] resurrected it's just a couple of days
[1:13:58] ago it wasn't that long ago the blood
[1:14:00] still there
[1:14:01] amen the sacrifices being given it's
[1:14:04] still fresh hallelujah
[1:14:06] it means it's not a long time ago it
[1:14:08] happened and so it's still just as
[1:14:10] potent and I even may say this it's more
[1:14:13] potent it's more potent because in this
[1:14:15] hour people are going to be translated
[1:14:17] from this world to the next world and
[1:14:19] then we're not ordained and gone to the
[1:14:21] grave or a day to take a body change
[1:14:23] hallelujah
[1:14:24] you know what we're gonna take a body
[1:14:26] change for those Peaks we're just
[1:14:28] attributes of God attributes just like
[1:14:31] your children are part of your father's

[1:19:31] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:19:33] image of his son that he might be the
[1:19:35] firstborn among many brethren so he is
[1:19:38] so he so to whom he foreknew so he
[1:19:42] foreknew you right and he predestinated
[1:19:44] you to be conformed to the image of a
[1:19:46] son which is his word so he predestined
[1:19:49] us to be conformed to the image of his
[1:19:50] son his word so he knows before
[1:19:54] yoyoyo before there was anything in his
[1:19:56] great mind he thought of you and when he
[1:19:59] thought of you he says now they're going
[1:20:00] to be become my word in the day an hour
[1:20:02] in which they live Allu yeah I'm glad
[1:20:06] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:20:08] he also called and to whom he called
[1:20:11] them he also justified now this call is
[1:20:14] not just a big call going out there's an
[1:20:16] individual call right like the Peter
[1:20:18] James and John come follow me right it's
[1:20:21] not just a great big call no this is an
[1:20:23] individual call hallelujah whom he also
[1:20:28] justified and whom he justified them he
[1:20:31] also glorified
[1:20:32] so who's been called and you know you've
[1:20:35] been called you got to speak to the rock
[1:20:38] so don't just sit there you know even if
[1:20:40] you're up to here in the world I'd say
[1:20:42] Lord I'm cold you've called me you know
[1:20:46] they overcame him by the blood of
[1:20:48] Lemonwood are they testimony you know
[1:20:49] when you testify when you speak it it
[1:20:51] becomes real to you right you've got to
[1:20:53] really say yes and and and confess the
[1:20:56] word for yourself so if you've been
[1:20:58] called then you've been justified right
[1:21:00] and and you know brother Bram says true
[1:21:03] justification is you never did it in the
[1:21:05] first place and you got to go what where
[1:21:07] is the first place the first place is
[1:21:09] what God thought of you and his mind
[1:21:11] before the foundation of the world
[1:21:12] so what God thought of you perfect
[1:21:15] sinless redeemed nothing held against
[1:21:18] him whatsoever without spider
[1:21:20] cool washed in the blood of lamb that's
[1:21:22] how he thought of you and if that's how
[1:21:24] he thought of you that's how you'll be
[1:21:26] manifested upon the earth you following
[1:21:28] me
[1:21:29] hallelujah so if we have been justified
[1:21:32] that way then who can lay charge now
[1:21:35] that's to whom he's all justified them
[1:21:37] he also glorified it's already done then
[1:21:42] you know them he also glorified so this
[1:21:46] is a finished yeah we just catching up
[1:21:47] to the scripture you following me it's
[1:21:49] already been spoken daughter II thought
[1:21:51] we're just catching up to what God said
[1:21:53] we would be oh you got to speak to your
[1:21:57] rock say thank you lord
[1:21:59] I've been sanctified thank you Lord your
[1:22:01] holy spirits for have been filled thank
[1:22:03] you I being justified by your grace amen
[1:22:06] now he so if what shall we then say to
[1:22:14] these things were in Romans 8:31 if
[1:22:16] you're there if God be for us who can be
[1:22:19] against us that's a good question if God
[1:22:22] is for you who can be against you he
[1:22:24] that spared not his own son but
[1:22:25] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[1:22:28] not with him also freely give us all
[1:22:32] things
[1:22:32] what shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:22:36] God's elect it is God that justifies who
[1:22:40] is he that condemneth it is Christ that
[1:22:43] died yea rather that is risen again who
[1:22:45] is even at the right hand of God who
[1:22:48] maketh intercession for us not against
[1:22:51] you for you a meant for you who shall
[1:22:55] separate us from the love of Christ
[1:22:57] shall tribulation or distress or
[1:22:59] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:23:01] peril or sword and he keeps going down
[1:23:03] nothing can know nothing can you gotta
[1:23:05] speak to your rock right well what's the
[1:23:09] best way to do it quote his word back to
[1:23:11] him Amen that's why you got to do amen
[1:23:15] brother brems says and this is a broken
[1:23:17] cisterns in 1964 he says if you are sin
[1:23:21] sick speak to the rock if you are weary
[1:23:23] speak to the rock see it looked like it
[1:23:27] would be anywhere it looked like if
[1:23:28] there was no water down little places
[1:23:30] there were Springs there wouldn't be
[1:23:34] order up on that mountain but the rock
[1:23:36] God does things just backwards from what
[1:23:38] man thinks the rock the driest place in
[1:23:40] the wilderness he said speak to the rock
[1:23:42] today people are so to see if they think
[1:23:44] if they can go and say their prayers pay
[1:23:47] some priest and say a few priests for
[1:23:49] them and pay their way through they'll
[1:23:51] just build some big church somewhere and
[1:23:52] some rich man will sponsor it go on
[1:23:55] living and lust have somebody else pray
[1:23:57] for them he thinks that's it but God
[1:23:59] don't want your filthy money all the
[1:24:01] thing he wants is your devotion in your
[1:24:03] life to speak to him God has given you
[1:24:06] money don't spend it for things that
[1:24:09] satisfy if not spend it for things that
[1:24:11] satisfies but to bring real satisfaction
[1:24:14] you'll not get until you speak to the
[1:24:16] rock he brought forth life-giving waters
[1:24:18] without money or without price that's a
[1:24:23] perfect parable of their in this
[1:24:25] wilderness they they never had to pull
[1:24:29] dig pump or anything just partake of his
[1:24:31] provided way freely that's his word why
[1:24:34] they didn't have to dig it out of a pond
[1:24:36] they didn't have to pull it up with a
[1:24:37] bucket they didn't have to win lit down
[1:24:40] with it they just had to partake of it
[1:24:43] and that's all there is now you don't
[1:24:46] have to join nothing you don't have to
[1:24:47] go down at the altar and work up
[1:24:49] something pump it in you don't have to
[1:24:51] say a word over and over till you get a
[1:24:53] confusion of language the only thing you
[1:24:55] have to do is partake of them freely
[1:24:57] guys provide away no pumping no pushing
[1:25:00] no nothing just take of it freely
[1:25:01] nothing you have to do just partake of
[1:25:04] it that is just believe that's all I can
[1:25:06] say that's all I can say to it you never
[1:25:10] had to do anything for it you never had
[1:25:12] to dig for it you never had to go way
[1:25:14] down cry all night you they just partook
[1:25:16] of it it was smitten and ready that's
[1:25:19] right I'm looking at an old man nervous
[1:25:21] I'm sitting here in the back of the room
[1:25:23] I remember telling that to an old
[1:25:26] telling that on an old bath stall one
[1:25:30] day by a manger and he said but I'm no
[1:25:34] good I said I know you're not and I said
[1:25:37] I'm not either but I said you're looking
[1:25:40] at what you are quit looking at what you
[1:25:43] are and look at what he is
[1:25:46] we're going to keep doing that right
[1:25:47] even if we've been sealed into the
[1:25:49] kingdom you ought to keep you know we're
[1:25:51] saved by grace and we say Amen our walk
[1:25:53] is by grace divine insulins upon the
[1:25:56] heart and its reflection in the life
[1:25:57] right that's his doing so stop looking
[1:26:00] at what you are quit looking at what you
[1:26:03] are and look at what he is I say that's
[1:26:05] the same thing for loved ones and family
[1:26:07] quit looking at what they are and start
[1:26:09] looking at what he is right he said if I
[1:26:12] could just get rid rid of these
[1:26:14] cigarettes brother branham I'd be a
[1:26:16] Christian he said don't get rid of them
[1:26:18] you're trying to get good and then come
[1:26:21] to him you never come I mean sorry he
[1:26:24] never come to save good men he come to
[1:26:26] save bad men that knowed they were bad
[1:26:29] he said well listen you don't want to go
[1:26:31] to hell do you he said no I said well
[1:26:34] you don't have to he died that you might
[1:26:36] not have to go he said what do I have to
[1:26:39] do I said nothing
[1:26:40] it's just that simple he said but if I
[1:26:43] could ever I said there you go back to
[1:26:45] that cigarette again quit thinking about
[1:26:48] that cigarette just remember think about
[1:26:50] him what he did what he is not what you
[1:26:53] are you're no good and you never was and
[1:26:56] never will be but what he is he's the
[1:26:59] one and I said now the only thing you
[1:27:01] have to do as if if he took your place
[1:27:04] down there you just willingly accept
[1:27:07] what he did only thing you have to do is
[1:27:09] accept it why he said it's simple I'll
[1:27:12] do that and I said here's the creek and
[1:27:15] I boarded him up here and baptized in
[1:27:17] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:27:18] some of his people are sitting here and
[1:27:20] I know they felt funny at me for doing
[1:27:23] it I knowed what I was doing I'd seen in
[1:27:26] the man something that was genuine see
[1:27:29] something that was genuine in him I
[1:27:30] could see it there and I took him a
[1:27:32] baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:27:34] and when they did that it wasn't long
[1:27:37] till after that I was down it to a son's
[1:27:39] house and I'd seen a vision of a tree
[1:27:41] being broke at a certain place and a man
[1:27:44] fell almost broke his back took him in
[1:27:46] the hospital and that night the Lord
[1:27:48] revealed to me that that was the end of
[1:27:50] the cigarettes so the next day he wanted
[1:27:52] some cigarettes I said I'll buy him a
[1:27:54] carton and take it to him you just watch
[1:27:56] and see now this is a prophet knows what
[1:27:59] he's doing
[1:27:59] okay so if you're thinking why would you
[1:28:02] ever do this he knows what he's doing
[1:28:03] okay his cigarette days are done he
[1:28:07] never smoked one since never wanted one
[1:28:10] since God see the first thing you've got
[1:28:12] to do is come to that fountain amen
[1:28:16] you've got to come to that water realize
[1:28:18] it's nothing you can do it's what he'd
[1:28:20] done for you
[1:28:21] once that's why I said to the me say
[1:28:24] well that's quite a contrary you know
[1:28:25] why would he tell the man there's
[1:28:26] nothing you can do no you just got a
[1:28:28] partake of it right you've just got to
[1:28:30] believe his word right and then that
[1:28:33] faith will fix you right faith in the
[1:28:36] word will fix you you know because many
[1:28:38] times we people think well I'm no good
[1:28:41] I'll never you know I just I've got to
[1:28:43] do this and then I'll become a Christian
[1:28:45] no you become the Christian then that'll
[1:28:46] go away right you've just got to take
[1:28:48] him at his word right and the faith you
[1:28:51] have in his word will change you
[1:28:54] that's right this power and receiving
[1:28:56] the word by faith well how do you do
[1:28:59] that you say I believe it right more
[1:29:03] than just and he say yeah that's true
[1:29:04] I believe it and you'll watch it now if
[1:29:06] you and if you've really received it by
[1:29:08] faith you'll see the word have an effect
[1:29:10] in your life and will change you Olu you
[1:29:13] see you don't have to dig you don't have
[1:29:14] to pump out you don't have to quit this
[1:29:17] you don't have to quit that the only
[1:29:18] thing you have to do is get there and
[1:29:19] drink right that's all if you're thirsty
[1:29:22] drink now he was the rock God smote him
[1:29:24] for us and he gave forth abundance of
[1:29:26] pure clean water he does yet today to
[1:29:28] everyone that will believe this is as
[1:29:31] grace of course to his people as there's
[1:29:33] something like that the people of today
[1:29:36] ready to receive what they can get but
[1:29:39] don't want to give any service in return
[1:29:41] Israel was ready to drink from the rock
[1:29:43] now but they didn't want to give God his
[1:29:45] service that was jus him and he's always
[1:29:46] giving us a service you know we can't
[1:29:50] even breathe without him we can't
[1:29:52] breathe without God's service that's how
[1:29:53] dependent we are on him and yet it's
[1:29:55] almost practicing too if we if we have
[1:29:58] to do something for him he gives he asks
[1:30:00] us to do something go see somebody go
[1:30:03] pray for somebody go help somebody it
[1:30:04] almost breaks us up to do it but we
[1:30:08] don't want to do anything for a service
[1:30:09] now
[1:30:12] so he says all you got to do is drink of
[1:30:16] the fountain right but you got to speak
[1:30:18] to the rock to receive the fountain
[1:30:20] right now in and Jeremiah now I'll try
[1:30:26] not just see how we go
[1:30:28] but in Jeremiah is very outstanding
[1:30:30] Scripture I think Jeremiah Oh God is
[1:30:34] speaking to Jeremiah says hath a nation
[1:30:36] change their gods which are yet no gods
[1:30:39] but my people have changed their glory
[1:30:41] from that which does not profit be
[1:30:44] astonished o you heavens at this be
[1:30:46] horribly afraid be very desolate saith
[1:30:49] the Lord for my people have committed
[1:30:50] two evils they have forsaken me the
[1:30:53] fountain of living waters and have hewed
[1:30:56] them out cisterns broken cisterns that
[1:30:59] can hold no water so they have changed
[1:31:04] he says they have forsaken now now this
[1:31:07] is this is incredible we're a people
[1:31:09] would would subsidy they they first
[1:31:13] forsake God that brought them out of the
[1:31:15] wilderness that the rock that was
[1:31:17] spinning brought forth fountain of
[1:31:19] living water and they they substituted
[1:31:22] that by a man-made tank that they your
[1:31:25] system is a man-made tank so instead of
[1:31:28] living by the fountain you know a great
[1:31:30] artesian well I think it's one under
[1:31:32] pitoni
[1:31:33] it just comes forth there's a great big
[1:31:35] you know a reservoir of water I think
[1:31:36] even under the seabed down there it just
[1:31:39] pushes forth right why would you
[1:31:41] substitute that with a tank you build
[1:31:44] and and then you soak so just imagine
[1:31:46] you're living in batoning there's the
[1:31:48] fountain there on the street you're
[1:31:50] living in this house here and you decide
[1:31:52] no I'm not going to drink from this
[1:31:54] fountain there's nothing wrong with the
[1:31:55] water it's pure it's clean real good
[1:31:57] tasting natural there's no man-made
[1:31:59] contaminants in it right nothing from
[1:32:02] the pollution the air can get in that
[1:32:03] water it comes forth but you build a
[1:32:05] house over here and say I'm gonna have
[1:32:06] my own tank I'm gonna have my own water
[1:32:09] tank right here and and you build the
[1:32:12] guttering and you build the tank and it
[1:32:14] can ever look so nice this is modern
[1:32:16] this is the latest material this one
[1:32:19] will always give you clean water
[1:32:21] this one is dependent upon the local
[1:32:23] atmosphere upon the local rain efile
[1:32:26] me if it's raining you'll get water if
[1:32:28] it's not raining the tank will run dry
[1:32:31] and you'll start to worry right so
[1:32:33] you're so so how much water you have is
[1:32:35] based on your situation and then you've
[1:32:37] got to clean the guttering out I
[1:32:39] remember well I remember my dad doing it
[1:32:41] when we were young as we had rainwater
[1:32:43] tanks and Gisborne right so I have to
[1:32:46] clean the guttering out you got to clean
[1:32:48] the tanks out once in a while right so
[1:32:50] everything that falls on the roof washes
[1:32:52] into the gutter and gets into your water
[1:32:54] so a bird can poo up there all kinds of
[1:32:57] things can happen right it'll go down
[1:32:59] you know some people out of their tanks
[1:33:02] they get dead rats and did things well
[1:33:05] cause it died up there and ended up in
[1:33:06] the tank and that's how people are with
[1:33:08] the Word of God they they they said of
[1:33:11] having the true fountain of living water
[1:33:13] appear interpretation of the word they
[1:33:15] make their own tank of theology and then
[1:33:18] depending on local rains to come and
[1:33:20] fill it and all kinds of wiggle tails
[1:33:21] and dead stuff gets in it and they drink
[1:33:24] that water right why would you
[1:33:27] substitute now if we will you know if we
[1:33:29] were standing in Pretoria and say well
[1:33:30] this man built this but he could have
[1:33:32] this you think why didn't he stay with
[1:33:34] the tank I mean why did he why did he go
[1:33:36] with the tank and not with the artesian
[1:33:38] well say well you know and he would have
[1:33:42] his argument but ultimately you say
[1:33:44] that's foolish he's got this water why I
[1:33:46] have this man-made tank right we don't
[1:33:49] have a man-made tank and you to
[1:33:52] personally be tapped into the great
[1:33:54] fountain of living water right because
[1:33:56] even you can make your own message
[1:33:58] system and it will break and leak by
[1:34:01] adding man's ideas to it it'll become a
[1:34:03] man-made religious system a tank but he
[1:34:06] says that they have hewed themselves out
[1:34:07] cisterns broken cisterns that can hold
[1:34:10] no water so could hold no you know it
[1:34:12] just leaks we aren't called to have a
[1:34:16] broken cistern religion hallelujah we
[1:34:19] are called we are called to have the
[1:34:23] fountain of living water the Word of God
[1:34:25] ever flowing free ever rich deep and
[1:34:28] cold and refreshing that's what we're
[1:34:31] called to have I mean we don't have to
[1:34:33] you know you know a tank you've got to
[1:34:34] have filters because stuff gets into the
[1:34:37] water you've got to do all kinds of
[1:34:39] things
[1:34:39] you know but you know and and Brother
[1:34:42] Bear calls it a strainer rank it doesn't
[1:34:45] need so so so the artesian well it
[1:34:47] doesn't need a strainer rag rag to take
[1:34:49] the parasites out for it's coming so
[1:34:52] deep down there in the rock until
[1:34:53] there's no parasites there amen don't
[1:34:57] have an educational rag hanging on it
[1:34:59] some worldly made system of manmade
[1:35:01] denominational wisdom to tell to tell
[1:35:03] you before a psychiatrist whether you're
[1:35:05] able to preach or not don't have one of
[1:35:07] those filthy rags hanging on it and a
[1:35:10] push right off as soon as you put it on
[1:35:11] there
[1:35:12] because there because the waters
[1:35:14] bubbling forth right out of the great
[1:35:16] artesian well hallelujah you can't do it
[1:35:19] that well is bubbling up all the time if
[1:35:21] you'd put one of them rags on it and
[1:35:23] throw it plumb out to the other side of
[1:35:24] the other that don't have no time for a
[1:35:27] denominational rag on it you don't need
[1:35:29] no filter no strainer no pumping no
[1:35:31] jerking no nothing else it's just there
[1:35:33] bubbling up it don't have it doesn't
[1:35:35] have to depend on local range to fill it
[1:35:37] up rains or revivals we're that fountain
[1:35:40] that's at the fountain of life where the
[1:35:42] carcass as the Eagles will gather you
[1:35:44] don't have to pump up a revival you
[1:35:46] don't have to pump up nothing the other
[1:35:47] thing you have to do is just has just
[1:35:49] come to the fountain it's always good a
[1:35:52] fool it's always full of good fresh
[1:35:54] water there's no end to it
[1:35:55] it just keeps bubbling you don't have to
[1:35:57] go to the cistern say well if it rains
[1:35:59] and washes off the barn I'll have
[1:36:01] something to drink is here's my mind not
[1:36:03] this that artesian well spreading forth
[1:36:05] good cold water all the time you can
[1:36:08] depend on it you don't have to say well
[1:36:10] I'll go to this old cistern I used to
[1:36:12] drink out of it and it hasn't rained for
[1:36:13] a long time I tell you it may be dry
[1:36:15] that's the way some of these man-made
[1:36:17] systems are you go in if you've got
[1:36:20] something big something great big
[1:36:21] caboose selling something or some kind
[1:36:23] of something going on big parties and
[1:36:25] things during a Bunco games parties in
[1:36:27] the basement everything you might have
[1:36:29] find a full house but we you go to where
[1:36:31] the fountain is bubbling up always the
[1:36:34] people are there getting them a good
[1:36:35] cold drink of water you can depend upon
[1:36:37] it say well they haven't had a revival
[1:36:40] for ten years if you live by that
[1:36:42] fountain she's always got a revival
[1:36:45] going on amen like the little Welshman I
[1:36:48] mean one time when the Welsh revival was
[1:36:50] going on some great dignitary
[1:36:52] came from came from the United States
[1:36:54] and now some great doctors of divinity
[1:36:56] and they went to the Welsh yeah I mean I
[1:36:58] mean they went to Wales to find out what
[1:37:00] was going on and they had their turned
[1:37:02] around collars and and and their plug
[1:37:04] hats walking down the street and a
[1:37:06] little cop came along you know whirling
[1:37:08] his little billy club in his hand
[1:37:09] whistling down at the cross where my
[1:37:12] savior died down there for cleansing for
[1:37:14] sin I cried dear to my heart was the
[1:37:17] blood applied glory to his name so they
[1:37:20] said that seems to be a religious man
[1:37:21] will go ask him
[1:37:22] and I said mister he said yes sir he
[1:37:24] said we're here from the United States
[1:37:26] we're a delegation we've come over here
[1:37:28] to investigate the Welsh revival so
[1:37:30] called
[1:37:30] we had doctors of divinity and we're
[1:37:32] here to look at over he said we want to
[1:37:34] know where the revival is and where it's
[1:37:36] held he said sir you have arrived I am
[1:37:39] the Welsh revival amen the Welsh
[1:37:41] revivals and me that's where it's at
[1:37:43] that's the way it is when you live by
[1:37:45] that fountain of living waters that's
[1:37:47] living all the time
[1:37:48] bubbling over and over and over and over
[1:37:50] and there's no end to it and we not go
[1:37:52] and see if some water
[1:37:54] you know if we've had rain not long ago
[1:37:56] it's not it it's the fountain of living
[1:37:58] water it gives us water free you don't
[1:38:00] the put rags in it to find out some
[1:38:02] educational rags I mean you don't have
[1:38:06] to depend upon local range to fill it up
[1:38:08] or local revivals it don't have to do
[1:38:12] that for it's the power and as the
[1:38:13] purity is within itself that's where the
[1:38:16] word is its own power hallelujah so we
[1:38:19] don't have to if you're really built
[1:38:20] into that living well if that living
[1:38:22] fountain is in you pushing forth living
[1:38:24] water you are the revival I mean if he
[1:38:27] if he becomes a living reality to you I
[1:38:30] mean you don't need a local revival to
[1:38:32] fill up some tank that you've made I
[1:38:33] mean but he is in you pushing out the
[1:38:35] water
[1:38:36] he is then you're pushing out a spirits
[1:38:38] here's any pushing out the word
[1:38:39] hallelujah where you don't get dry and
[1:38:42] thirsty its bubbling that's coming forth
[1:38:44] you can't stop it hallelujah and that's
[1:38:47] why those who really see him in their
[1:38:49] day I mean they will they will become
[1:38:51] one with the fountain and in the scribes
[1:38:53] and Pharisees the rock became flesh in
[1:38:55] Jesus Christ right he was a shadow now
[1:38:58] he's the reality he was the fountain of
[1:39:00] living waters right and those who looked
[1:39:03] beyond the veil of a man from
[1:39:04] golly look beyond he's more than a
[1:39:06] prophet but he was the Messiah I mean
[1:39:08] those who really saw him in the day the
[1:39:10] Word made flesh and their day I mean
[1:39:12] they became one with the fountain
[1:39:14] hallelujah that they just didn't talk
[1:39:15] about God and you know this happens and
[1:39:17] this has happened that they met him
[1:39:19] right and it's so vital that you see him
[1:39:22] in this day where the message is more
[1:39:24] than just your healing or supernatural
[1:39:26] or prophecy but the Living God has come
[1:39:29] down among us he's opened his word to us
[1:39:31] he's spoken the Living Waters coming for
[1:39:34] hallelujah amen that's right isn't it
[1:39:38] those those who see him in their day
[1:39:40] they become the revival hallelujah and
[1:39:42] it's and it's the same thing today cuz
[1:39:44] God doesn't change right God hasn't
[1:39:47] yahoo when brother Brown died Jesus
[1:39:50] didn't leave the earth the mighty angel
[1:39:52] didn't go he's still among us right he's
[1:39:54] still among us in his word he's still
[1:39:56] among us living in and his people
[1:39:58] hallelujah and that's why I certainly on
[1:40:01] the Vail right when you look beyond the
[1:40:04] mouth when it becomes more than books
[1:40:05] and tapes in the Bible that becomes
[1:40:07] Christ living person in your presence
[1:40:10] right and not in not in the past I mean
[1:40:13] but living now hallelujah the woman at
[1:40:16] the well knew of a historical God she
[1:40:22] was now living in Samaria and she went
[1:40:26] to Jacob's Well she was living by a
[1:40:29] man-made well it provided water but it
[1:40:36] was a man-made well then say at the
[1:40:40] woman of Samaria so I'm just dropping
[1:40:41] into the story I'm going to show you
[1:40:43] this then say at the woman of Samaria
[1:40:45] unto Him how was it that thou being a
[1:40:48] jew asketh me of a drink which I'm a
[1:40:51] woman of Samaria for the Jews have no
[1:40:53] dealings with the Samaritans jesus
[1:40:55] answered said unto her if thou knewest
[1:40:56] the gift of God and who it is that saith
[1:41:00] to thee give me to drink thou wouldest
[1:41:03] have asked of him and he would have
[1:41:05] given the living water so you got to
[1:41:07] speak to the rock if you really knew
[1:41:09] who's present you'd say give me this
[1:41:11] water give me this water I'll never
[1:41:13] thirst again
[1:41:14] Allu you and the woman sit under
[1:41:17] sir that has nothing to draw with and
[1:41:20] the well is deep from whence then hast
[1:41:23] thou that living water art thou greater
[1:41:28] than our Father Jacob which gave us the
[1:41:30] well and drank there himself and his
[1:41:33] children and his cattle see Jacob a man
[1:41:35] Dugard jesus answered and said unto her
[1:41:38] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[1:41:42] thirst again because as a man made well
[1:41:45] but whosoever drinketh of the water I
[1:41:48] will give him shall never thirst but the
[1:41:50] water which I shall give him shall be in
[1:41:54] him a well of water springing up into
[1:41:56] everlasting life the woman saith unto
[1:41:59] him Sir give me this water that I thirst
[1:42:02] not neither come to draw I was dropping
[1:42:07] down and then they began to speak about
[1:42:09] well you know our fathers worship here
[1:42:14] the Jews say you should worship worship
[1:42:15] in Jerusalem they get all religious it
[1:42:17] wasn't enough she needed water you know
[1:42:21] I had to go beyond just talking about
[1:42:23] while they did this and they made this
[1:42:25] church here and this is history what
[1:42:27] about today because she is actually
[1:42:30] sitting in the presence like she asked
[1:42:32] him are you greater than our Father
[1:42:33] Jacob and here's the God who spoke to
[1:42:35] Jacob it's far greater than him but now
[1:42:39] he's so and then and then finally it
[1:42:41] comes down to a point where where you
[1:42:43] know she says he says to her go get the
[1:42:47] husband he's the Fountains gonna go
[1:42:49] speaking and then she says well I don't
[1:42:53] have a husband and he says you have said
[1:42:55] well if you've had five and the one your
[1:42:57] worth is not yours you know I'm married
[1:42:59] and then she says we know where Messiah
[1:43:01] cometh he'll do these things so those
[1:43:04] are now the big big big big junction in
[1:43:07] the conversation right because she's mad
[1:43:09] and look beyond we know we're Messiah
[1:43:11] cometh so so she heard something and she
[1:43:13] sees well this looks like it but then
[1:43:16] she um he he just sees under her he that
[1:43:20] speaks he that's Jesus said under I that
[1:43:23] speak unto thee a.m. he hallelujah and
[1:43:26] upon this Camus disciples a marvel that
[1:43:29] he talked with the woman yet no man said
[1:43:31] speak if they'll or why speak it there
[1:43:33] with her the woman then left her
[1:43:35] waterpot you're gonna lure to drop your
[1:43:38] drop your drawing device from your
[1:43:40] sister right she had to leave Jacob's
[1:43:43] Well right she had to leave the man-made
[1:43:46] denomination she was in right because
[1:43:49] she had to receive the founder of living
[1:43:51] water so she left her waterpot and went
[1:43:53] her way into the city and said to the
[1:43:55] man come see a man which told me of all
[1:43:57] the things I ever did is this not the
[1:43:59] Christ hallelujah so she'd saw more than
[1:44:02] she would the same things of scribes and
[1:44:04] Pharisees see but she looked beyond the
[1:44:07] veil God allowed her to look beyond the
[1:44:09] veil of his flesh I mean to see that he
[1:44:11] was the Messiah hallelujah and I'm so
[1:44:14] glad in this day I'm glad I'm Simeon in
[1:44:17] the play it's my favorite bit of the
[1:44:18] story hallelujah he picks up the baby
[1:44:21] yeah now let thy servant depart in peace
[1:44:24] where I've seen thy salvation he saw the
[1:44:26] Messiah in his day and he rejoiced and
[1:44:29] he knew that now he could go off the
[1:44:31] earth because it's done what was
[1:44:32] promised room was done hallelujah and
[1:44:34] we've seen Messire in the stage
[1:44:36] this word is Messiah I mean the Living
[1:44:38] Word is Messiah we've seen him in this
[1:44:41] day as more than a prophet more than
