[1:09] desire to to build us up and and
[1:12] sometimes it doesn't we don't understand

[1:51] to you here this morning in Jesus name
[1:53] amen praise the Lord okay you can um
[1:55] stand up this
[1:57] morning and
[2:00] we're going to start with um God's not

[2:03] that we had we had it in
[2:05] d d what key is it on man D is it oh
[2:11] hey yeah okay God's not dead he is alive
[2:16] oh God's not
[2:19] dead he is

[2:24] dead he is
[2:26] alive God not
[2:30] he is
[2:31] alive feeling
[2:37] me all
[2:42] over God
[2:45] not he is
[2:47] alive
[2:50] God He Is

[3:49] not he is
[3:52] alive God's
[3:55] not he is alive
[4:02] is feeling in
[4:09] my my heart I'm my
[4:19] soul amen praise the Lord you know you
[4:25] it's one thing to sing about it but we
[4:26] need that testimony because there's a
[4:28] time when the devil challenges
[4:30] us we've got to have somewhere to get
[4:32] back to to see you know what God's Not
[4:34] Dead He's
[4:35] Alive we you know we've all been in
[4:38] those places I
[4:40] know
[4:42] um brother bam shared the testimony of
[4:45] um you know he was driving along in his
[4:47] car and Satan would just start messing
[4:49] with him and telling him that God wasn't
[4:51] doing much for him and that and he would
[4:52] just start thinking about all the things
[4:53] that God had done and then before he
[4:55] knew it he'll be singing one of them one
[4:58] of them you know that's
[5:00] we we get challenged on these things and
[5:02] we have to have a a personal reality in
[5:05] our own life amen to to know that God's
[5:08] Not Dead that that there's a point where
[5:10] we say you know what here and no more no
[5:13] no no further back than this point cuz
[5:15] this is where I met God or this is where
[5:16] God did something for me here and and if
[5:19] we don't have that we will just get
[5:20] pushed back back back back but God's Not
[5:23] Dead who knows he's not dead amen and
[5:27] and the more we just trust him the more
[5:28] he makes himself real to us proves he's
[5:31] not dead amen okay here among the

[16:01] take your seats this morning thanks man
[16:03] good work give him a round of
[16:08] applause good stuff
[16:13] amen Okay so we've um got an item this
[16:17] morning from um brother
[16:19] John
[16:21] and
[16:23] the um Team the music guys have got an
[16:27] ambitious Target
[16:29] an ambitious goal that they're embarking
[16:31] on and they're all on a grant even
[16:33] Brother Andy and he doesn't know what
[16:35] this is
[16:38] yet now he kind of does so so the Lord
[16:42] seems to have been giving us a few a few
[16:43] songs that we've been
[16:46] um writing and then
[16:48] learning and so we did our maths the
[16:52] other week and we figured if we write
[16:55] one song a week then in one year there's
[16:56] 52 songs which is quite a b song
[17:00] book yeah and then we looked around at
[17:02] who we've got and brother John is
[17:04] probably can bear the brunt of that
[17:06] weight so we sort of laid about 20 on
[17:08] his shoulders
[17:10] 22 and maybe I might do
[17:14] 21 and then we figured the rest will
[17:17] split between everyone else Brother Andy
[17:20] Sister Christine you what songs you do
[17:24] now brother
[17:26] ID yeah so they've got to do maybe three
[17:29] in a year which which hey a non-m
[17:32] musician could do that you know you
[17:34] probably all randomly come up with some
[17:36] tune here and there in your life yeah
[17:38] everyone has yeah yeah see hey if you
[17:40] get one you think it's quite nice come
[17:42] and see one of us and say look I've got
[17:43] this tune you never know I'll see you on
[17:45] Monday yeah yeah yeah um and
[17:51] so you'll have to be with us because
[17:53] we'll have to bring them into the
[17:54] congregation as they come out and um we
[17:58] think that maybe we might do each new
[17:59] song as an item and then the following
[18:01] week we will sing that song and we want
[18:03] to do it maybe two or three times just
[18:05] to get people used to the song if it
[18:07] doesn't work we won't do it again some
[18:08] songs may be not very good and we just
[18:10] won't do them again but we'll see how we
[18:12] go um but this song um John's going to
[18:15] sing a song that he wrote the other day
[18:17] I just want to show you something I got
[18:20] the
[18:21] picture sometimes when you it's not this
[18:23] song Brother Andy it's another one
[18:24] sometimes when you know where a song
[18:26] came from there's a bit more
[18:27] appreciation for the song how it came
[18:29] about um on the desktop there andy
[18:32] there's a
[18:33] um it's just oh know I've got it already
[18:36] open it's a photo already open on the
[18:38] just look down the bottom on
[18:41] the taskbar there's a there's a photo
[18:44] open if you could just bring that across
[18:45] here I want to show you this cuz I think
[18:47] this is quite um the check yep yeah this
[18:50] is yeah can you make that bigger there

[19:43] some little cord with John amen so he
[19:46] now can you bring that another song up

[49:16] prayer amen if you've got your Bibles
[49:18] handy we'll just go to uh First Kings
[49:21] chapter
[49:24] 18 and then I want to read
[49:27] uh John chapter 8 just a a scripture
[49:31] there and then we'll go to Romans
[49:33] chapter 12 just as one more
[49:35] scripture now I want to just we'll just
[49:38] drop into the uh you everyone's familiar
[49:40] with the story of Elijah on Mount carel
[49:44] and I just want to uh take a bit of a a
[49:47] scripture from there so but so we'll
[49:49] just drop into the halfway into the
[49:52] story we'll just go to verse 30 there in
[49:54] uh in First Kings 18
[50:01] and so so this is after baal's the
[50:04] priest of Baal have tried to do all
[50:06] their calling upon Baal and they've
[50:08] miserably failed and then so and Elijah
[50:11] said unto all the people come near unto
[50:14] me and all the people came near unto him
[50:16] and he repaired the altar of the Lord
[50:19] which was broken down and Elijah took 12
[50:21] Stones according to the number of the
[50:23] tribes of Jacob unto whom the word of
[50:25] the Lord came saying is
[50:27] shall be thy name and with the stones he
[50:29] built an altar in the name of the Lord
[50:31] and he made a trench about the altar as
[50:33] great as could contain two measures of
[50:35] seed and he put the wood in order and
[50:38] cut the bulock in pieces and laid him on
[50:41] the wood and said fill four barrels with
[50:43] water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice
[50:46] and on the wood he said do it a second
[50:47] time and they did it the second time and
[50:49] he said do it the third time and they
[50:51] said um uh and they did it the third
[50:53] time and the water ran round about the
[50:56] AL Al and he filled the trench also with
[50:58] water and it came to pass at the time
[51:00] the offering of the evening sacrifice
[51:02] that Elijah the prophet came near and
[51:04] said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of
[51:06] Israel let it be known this day that
[51:08] thou art God in Israel and that I am thy
[51:11] servant and that I have done all these
[51:13] things at Thy word hear me oh Lord hear
[51:15] me that this people may know uh that
[51:18] thou art the Lord God and that thou Hast
[51:20] turned their heart back again then the
[51:22] fire of the Lord fell and consumed the
[51:24] burnt sacrifice and the wood and the
[51:26] stones and the dust and lick up the
[51:27] water and it was uh uh that was in the
[51:30] trench and when all the people saw it
[51:33] they fell on their faces uh and they
[51:35] said the Lord he is God the Lord he is
[51:38] God Amen let's go to uh John chapter
[51:44] 8 and uh I just want to read a couple of
[51:46] scriptures here in John chapter 8 just
[51:48] just two uh verses 31 and
[51:54] 32 the many times we misquote this verse
[51:58] in in verse 32 we you know we normally
[52:01] say and the truth shall set you free but
[52:03] that's not what the scripture tells us
[52:04] at all so verse 31 it says here in John
[52:07] chapter 8 then Jesus said to those Jews
[52:10] which believed on him if ye continue in
[52:13] my word then ye are my disciples indeed
[52:17] and you shall know the truth and the
[52:20] truth shall make you free so there's
[52:23] power in in in in continuing in the word
[52:26] it makes you free there's a there's a
[52:28] law in the in the word it'll make you
[52:30] free you know amen so there's a force in
[52:33] there there's a force in the word that
[52:34] will free the believer amen we'll go to
[52:37] John 12 and verse one and this is
[52:39] probably just want to read this so you
[52:41] know where I'm
[52:42] going uh John chap uh sorry Romans
[52:48] 12:1 and this is Paul
[52:51] now he he says these things I beseech
[52:54] you therefore Brethren by the mercies of
[52:56] God
[52:56] that you present your bodies a Living
[52:58] Sacrifice wholly acceptable unto God
[53:00] which is your reasonable service amen
[53:03] may the Lord bless his word you may you
[53:05] may be seated so I want to uh I want to
[53:08] just pose you a question are you done
[53:10] yet that's my title are you done yet are
[53:13] you done and um yeah so so this is where
[53:17] I'm going basically so we see here on on
[53:20] Mount carel that uh you know we see that
[53:24] Elijah we read there that that he he
[53:27] repaired the altar of the Lord you he
[53:29] didn't re he didn't build a new altar he
[53:31] repaired one that was already there and
[53:34] he lays the challenge before this and we
[53:36] didn't read it but but if you want to go
[53:38] read the whole chapter of maybe read 17
[53:40] and 18 of First Kings and so Elijah
[53:45] makes the challenge he says he says to
[53:47] the prophets of Baal he says call unto
[53:49] the name of your gods and I'll call on
[53:51] the name of the Lord and the god that
[53:53] anth by fire let him be God and and all
[53:56] the people answered said it is well
[53:58] spoken so the challenge was the god that
[54:00] answers by fire he is he is the real God
[54:04] right and we see on the day of Pentecost
[54:06] when the day of Pentecost had fully come
[54:07] and the 120 were in the upper room that
[54:10] was a sound like a Russian Mighty Wind
[54:12] and there was clothing tongues of fire
[54:14] upon each one so the god of the Bible
[54:17] answered by fire and Elijah's day and he
[54:19] answered by fire in the New Testament as
[54:21] well Hallelujah that it was more than
[54:23] just a fire that burned up a sacrifice
[54:25] as a shadow of the Old Testament but it
[54:27] was a life that came into the church
[54:29] amen hallelujah there was a living a
[54:31] living God separated himself into the
[54:33] believer amen so that was the reason why
[54:36] there had to be an answer with fire but
[54:38] we understand that Elijah Elijah as I
[54:41] said he reped the altar of the Lord so
[54:44] it was already there you know the
[54:45] prophets of Baal had their Altar and
[54:47] they were doing all their things and
[54:48] cutting themselves and calling upon God
[54:50] and just getting in the flesh to try and
[54:52] get a response from you know from God
[54:55] and then but El he repaired the altar
[54:58] amen and this is very important because
[55:01] you know he he repaired cuz an altar is
[55:04] a way of sacrifice to God Amen and I'm
[55:07] going to take this a bit slow then maybe
[55:09] we'll you know we'll speed up as we go
[55:10] but I just want you to catch these
[55:12] thoughts because an altar is is is a
[55:15] approach to God because without the
[55:17] shedding of blood there's no Fellowship
[55:19] there's no remission of sin so an altar
[55:22] has to be made blood has to be shed and
[55:24] then the people can approach God
[55:27] and so Elijah repaired the altar of the
[55:29] Lord that had fallen into disrepair so
[55:32] the approach to God had fallen into
[55:35] disrepair amen because Israel they had
[55:38] forsaken the ways of God and they are
[55:40] now following Baal they built another
[55:42] altar but that altar wasn't ordained by
[55:45] God it was ordained by man's devices
[55:47] amen and so Elijah repared it now the
[55:51] spirit of Elijah is always used I'll say
[55:54] this to rebuild the altar of God to
[55:57] rebuild the um correct approach to God
[56:02] okay I'm just going to take this slowly
[56:04] this is not some mental gymnastics but
[56:06] you can see it all the way through the
[56:07] Bible because you see he said there
[56:09] before the fire fell that they may know
[56:12] that you are God and you have turned
[56:13] their hearts back again so the pro the
[56:16] very reason the altar was there and the
[56:18] sacrifice was there and the fire would
[56:19] fall that they would turn back to the
[56:22] right approach to God Amen and then now
[56:25] John the Baptist came in the spirit of
[56:27] Elijah and he was called to turn the
[56:30] hearts of the of the uh fathers to the
[56:34] children so he was called to turn the
[56:36] people's hearts from serving the law
[56:39] turn their hearts to receive the
[56:41] bridegroom to receive Christ that was
[56:43] that was his ministry to introduce a
[56:46] people to Jesus Christ and so he had to
[56:49] I'd say this he had to build a new
[56:52] altar amen because Jesus says in mark
[56:57] 7:7 it says how be it in vain do they
[57:00] worship me teaching for doctrines the
[57:02] Commandments of men that's right so
[57:04] Jesus was saying these scribes and
[57:06] Pharisees that have the temple that have
[57:08] their their ceremonies that were
[57:11] god-given that had their sacrifices
[57:13] which were god-given that had the law
[57:15] that was god-given but what they had
[57:17] done is they had they had perverted the
[57:19] very approach that God gave them to
[57:22] sacrifice and then now they were
[57:24] teaching they were wor himing God in
[57:27] vain yeah because the approach was now
[57:30] skewed yeah that's right am mean the
[57:32] approach was now wrong yeah are
[57:34] following me so far so and this is why
[57:36] John the Baptist had to come to prepare
[57:38] the people to turn from that Old way
[57:41] into a new way right and then even Jesus
[57:44] says in Matthew
[57:45] 23:13 he says but woe unto you scribes
[57:48] and Pharisees Hypocrites for you shut up
[57:51] the Kingdom of Heaven against men for ye
[57:54] neither go in yourselves neither suffer
[57:57] ye them that are entering to go in so
[58:00] they had actually by traditions of man
[58:02] they had shut the Kingdom of Heaven to
[58:03] the
[58:04] people and the prophets of Baal they
[58:07] were calling out they were cutting
[58:08] themselves they calling out upon this
[58:10] God but there's no answer there's no
[58:12] answer with fire right there's no actual
[58:15] God speaking back to them saying this is
[58:17] me this is my provided way right and
[58:19] that's why Elijah had to come and
[58:21] rebuild the
[58:22] altar that the correct worship could be
[58:25] could be done amen now Stones because
[58:29] I'm going to bring this into it today
[58:30] cuz it's all very well back there but
[58:32] what about today remember the question
[58:34] is are you done yet I'm going to get to
[58:36] the you know but are you done amen are
[58:39] you done now the stone stones in the
[58:42] Bible actually speak of spiritual
[58:44] revelation of the word because when
[58:47] Jesus asked his disciples who do men say
[58:49] that I am they said some say you're
[58:51] Jeremiah or John the Baptist one of the
[58:53] prophets and he he asked them but who
[58:56] you say I am what is the Revelation that
[58:58] you say I am and Peter said thou the
[59:01] Christ the son of the Living God and
[59:03] then we and then if you keep reading he
[59:05] says blessed art thou Simon by Jonah
[59:08] Simon son of Jonah for flesh and blood
[59:10] has not revealed this to you but my
[59:12] Father which is in heaven has revealed
[59:14] this to you you got to read the whole
[59:16] that whole passage of scripture is upon
[59:18] Revelation what is been revealed to them
[59:21] and what's been revealed to you amen
[59:23] amen and the same question is always
[59:25] posed upon every generation who do you
[59:27] say this is who do you say Malachi 4 was
[59:31] was he just a Healing Ministry was he
[59:33] just a different kind of Supernatural
[59:35] Ministry or is this God unveiling
[59:37] himself to the people you have to know
[59:39] it for yourself who do you say it is
[59:41] amen amen because if you recognize this
[59:43] is God then you receive what you need
[59:47] amen because Jesus the woman who touched
[59:49] the Hem of His Garment she knew this was
[59:51] more than a man it was revealed this is
[59:53] more than a man if I could just Touch
[59:55] the Hem of a garment I'll be made well
[59:57] I'll be made whole amen so you got to
[1:00:00] it's got to be revealed to you who do
[1:00:02] you say this is right amen well my daddy
[1:00:04] says this my my spouse says this maybe
[1:00:07] my brother or sister says this but who
[1:00:08] do you say it is right who do you say it
[1:00:11] is you must know for yourself amen sir
[1:00:14] and so and then he said Upon This Rock
[1:00:16] I'll build my church and that's the
[1:00:18] revelation of who he is not who he was
[1:00:20] but who he is yes amen cuz he's a
[1:00:23] present God he's not a historical God
[1:00:25] that's right you if we could just that
[1:00:27] such a small phrase Jesus Christ the
[1:00:30] same yesterday today and forever am and
[1:00:33] sometimes we can just speak it out
[1:00:35] without even it becomes a catchphrase
[1:00:37] right but if he is the same he does the
[1:00:39] same things he transforms people the
[1:00:42] same way that same life that came into
[1:00:44] the upper room can come into you amen
[1:00:47] that same go can live in you Hallelujah
[1:00:49] that same God can speak to you the same
[1:00:51] God that speak to Abraham can come and
[1:00:53] speak to you amen yes Hallelujah
[1:00:56] amen so so Stones a spiritual revelation
[1:00:59] of the word and so now what happens is
[1:01:02] because remember there was all these
[1:01:03] years of
[1:01:04] denominationalism and they you know some
[1:01:06] said he's three some said he's two some
[1:01:08] says he's one some say he's coming on a
[1:01:11] horse and on a cloud and they made their
[1:01:12] different denominations and this is how
[1:01:14] you baptize and so I'll say this there
[1:01:17] was a lot of altars that people have
[1:01:20] built up in sincerity they built them
[1:01:22] the prophets of Baal were sincere I
[1:01:24] believe that's right amen but they are
[1:01:26] sincerely wrong there's been a lot of
[1:01:28] altars being built as an approach to God
[1:01:31] but now God sent the spirit of Elijah
[1:01:33] and a prophet to rebuild to rebuild the
[1:01:37] correct approach to God amen amen amen
[1:01:40] because if you believe a lie if you're
[1:01:43] putting your faith in a lie you're
[1:01:44] putting your faith in the wrong thing
[1:01:46] right so it has to be revealed this is
[1:01:48] the way if Jesus said I am the way the
[1:01:51] truth and the life then he's obligated
[1:01:53] to reveal the way he's obligated to
[1:01:56] reveal the truth amen amen If people
[1:01:58] really want to meet God he'll come their
[1:02:00] way but then now it's up to you to
[1:02:02] respond the correct way amen so now he
[1:02:07] so so Elijah built the Altar and as I
[1:02:10] said spiritual revelation of the word of
[1:02:14] stones so now as the word is preached or
[1:02:18] as you as you read the Bible you listen
[1:02:20] to the message Revelation begins to drop
[1:02:22] into every
[1:02:23] heart amen right ation anchors into
[1:02:27] every soul I trust you can say I have
[1:02:28] some stones in my heart that that
[1:02:31] nothing can be they cannot be taken from
[1:02:33] me people may try and argue out of it or
[1:02:36] in it but something anchors you can't
[1:02:38] deny it as you can deny
[1:02:40] yourself so now Stone so Stone upon
[1:02:44] stone is built amen Into the Heart of
[1:02:47] the believer yes sir and so here's a few
[1:02:50] Stones now I'm not saying you all you
[1:02:51] have to I'm not saying you have to have
[1:02:53] all these stones to build the altar but
[1:02:56] here's just some examples we're in the
[1:02:58] end time amen amen I trust that's a
[1:03:01] revelation to you we're living in the
[1:03:03] Rapture cycle we're living in the
[1:03:05] resurrection Hallelujah and I trust as
[1:03:07] anch it in your in your soul you are the
[1:03:09] resurrection am mean if Jesus said I'm
[1:03:11] the resurrection and the life and that
[1:03:13] same life comes into you you can say I
[1:03:15] am the resurrection and the life because
[1:03:17] his life is in you amen is that too
[1:03:19] strong I don't think that's too strong
[1:03:22] amen God sent Malachi 4 I trust that a
[1:03:24] and he turned my heart back again
[1:03:27] Hallelujah God is real and and he is the
[1:03:29] Lord Jesus Christ I trust that's
[1:03:32] anchored into your heart he is the same
[1:03:34] yesterday today and forever hallelujah
[1:03:36] amen he died on the cross for me amen I
[1:03:40] am I am sinless and perfect as he is
[1:03:42] sinless and perfect amen amen he became
[1:03:45] me that I might become him by Grace
[1:03:48] Hallelujah he
[1:03:49] without amen what are
[1:03:52] we amen so I trust you I've been
[1:03:55] baptized in the name of the Lord I've
[1:03:56] repented been baptized the name of the
[1:03:58] Lord Jesus Christ I trust that's
[1:03:59] anchored into your heart so those are
[1:04:02] stones but now that's not the end of the
[1:04:05] you have an altar but now that's not the
[1:04:08] end of the story right now we read there
[1:04:10] in Romans chapter 12 present your body a
[1:04:14] Living
[1:04:15] Sacrifice so now there's the altars
[1:04:18] built amen and the wood is there but now
[1:04:22] you have to climb up onto your altar
[1:04:24] amen amen men you have to lay your you
[1:04:27] have to become the sacrifice you
[1:04:30] following me because it's not just
[1:04:32] enough to say well God's revealed these
[1:04:33] things now you've got to respond to the
[1:04:35] revealing now you've got to lay your
[1:04:37] body upon the altar yes sir amen now
[1:04:40] you've got to become the sacrifice
[1:04:42] that's how that's how people respond
[1:04:44] amen when they hear the word it doesn't
[1:04:46] matter if there just one service they've
[1:04:47] been in I in paping you get Catholic
[1:04:50] people come into the services after one
[1:04:52] service they give their heart to Christ
[1:04:53] they get baptized they say I don't want
[1:04:55] to go of tribulation what something's
[1:04:57] anchored in their heart amen hallelujah
[1:05:00] and then they present themselves
[1:05:02] amen you have to you have to put
[1:05:05] yourself upon the altar amen
[1:05:08] amen see if you haven't done that see
[1:05:10] you have to response as I said God can
[1:05:13] place all these things reveal all these
[1:05:15] things but then now you have to respond
[1:05:18] to the
[1:05:19] call
[1:05:20] amen see people see a sacrifice as we as
[1:05:25] we read the fire fell and it consumed
[1:05:28] every part of the it consumed the altar
[1:05:31] it consumed the water it consumed the
[1:05:32] wood and it consume the sacrifice it
[1:05:35] just licked it all up Hallelujah and
[1:05:38] then when you lay yourself you know
[1:05:40] people who are still wrestling are still
[1:05:42] alive that's right I'll put it that way
[1:05:43] it's just in my notes people who are
[1:05:45] wrestling are still alive I say this
[1:05:47] don't be afraid to let go and let God
[1:05:50] have his way see people are scared they
[1:05:53] say well I I I'm scared I you I don't
[1:05:55] want to give these things up don't look
[1:05:57] at what you have to give up look at what
[1:05:59] you've got to gain Hallelujah if God is
[1:06:01] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:06:04] you can read in the book of Acts isn't
[1:06:05] that wonderful amen and you go into the
[1:06:07] old T see what God it isn't that
[1:06:09] wonderful but God doesn't just want you
[1:06:11] to look at the Bible and say isn't that
[1:06:12] wonderful he wants that same one to come
[1:06:14] and live in you the same one to reveal
[1:06:17] himself to you Hallelujah that's what he
[1:06:19] wants so don't be afraid you know oh
[1:06:22] what do you have to gain eternal life to
[1:06:25] be Victor glorious in every part of your
[1:06:26] life to walk out of this world
[1:06:28] undefeated as brother John son
[1:06:31] Hallelujah so don't be afraid to let go
[1:06:33] and let God have his wayu amen don't be
[1:06:36] afraid that's right you see
[1:06:39] people people who get a bit
[1:06:42] religious uh when they know they should
[1:06:45] die on The Altar see conviction comes
[1:06:46] down and then people get religious and
[1:06:49] then they say now I need to do something
[1:06:51] and actually think of doing works for
[1:06:53] God you take the woman at the well you
[1:06:56] know Jesus at the well she's got her
[1:06:58] water pot and he says you know woman
[1:07:00] bring me a drink it says and then she
[1:07:03] says to him well you got nothing to draw
[1:07:04] with and he said well if you know the
[1:07:06] water I had you know it gives you
[1:07:08] eternal life and all these things and
[1:07:10] she said give me of this water and then
[1:07:12] she gets religious Our Father Jacob dug
[1:07:15] this well and then they say you should
[1:07:18] you know and our fathers worshiped in
[1:07:19] this mountain but you say you should
[1:07:21] Worship in Jerusalem she got
[1:07:23] religious but then that wasn't the end
[1:07:25] of it for her she had to drop her old
[1:07:28] life she had to drop her she she left
[1:07:30] her water pot the scripture tell and
[1:07:32] then she ran into the city amen amen so
[1:07:34] she had to drop her old life she would
[1:07:37] have done that every day gone to get
[1:07:39] water amen and so instead of you and
[1:07:42] then people come under conviction I need
[1:07:43] to witness I need to do all these things
[1:07:45] no you just got to get upon the altar
[1:07:47] amen you just got to be burned and
[1:07:49] consumed that a new life comes into you
[1:07:53] amen we don't want to
[1:07:55] we don't want to just get religious get
[1:07:57] a get a message religion but God has to
[1:08:00] come and consume the
[1:08:01] sacrifice now this isn't how can I
[1:08:05] overcome good question is it how can I
[1:08:07] overcome because to he he that overcomes
[1:08:09] I'll he'll sit in my Throne as I've sat
[1:08:11] down on my father's Throne that Throne
[1:08:13] is a
[1:08:14] Dominion amen so so so I just love it
[1:08:17] how you know you normally ask the
[1:08:19] question how can I overcome and then
[1:08:20] brother Brown preach a sermon how can I
[1:08:21] overcome he says there is a third
[1:08:24] dispensation now like Noah's time lot's
[1:08:27] time and now this time there is an ark
[1:08:30] now and that Ark is not a denomination
[1:08:33] neither is it are good works that you do
[1:08:37] it's one Spirit Romans 8:11 we are all
[1:08:40] baptized into one body in the Dominion
[1:08:42] of that Kingdom one spiritual pardon me
[1:08:45] baptism no matter how good how bad
[1:08:48] whatever you're in that Kingdom by Holy
[1:08:50] Ghost baptism see that's the only way
[1:08:53] you overcome it's all it's all that is
[1:08:56] under the shed blood as Overcomers cuz
[1:08:59] you cannot overcome yourself it's he
[1:09:02] that overcome for you you're resting How
[1:09:05] will I know then brother Bram that I'm
[1:09:07] in there watch what kind of life you're
[1:09:10] living just look around see if it's just
[1:09:13] lived out of you automatically or do you
[1:09:15] have to strain and pull then see you're
[1:09:19] then you're doing it but don't try to do
[1:09:22] it did you ever try yeah don't this is
[1:09:25] where I got my title are you done yet
[1:09:28] have you given up have you given have
[1:09:30] you just given you surren you know have
[1:09:33] you just surrendered have you given it
[1:09:34] up and not in here but really given up
[1:09:37] amen because when you give up the fire
[1:09:39] falls amen don't just like putting a
[1:09:43] little baby's arm in a sleeve hole you
[1:09:45] see he just up down over everything else
[1:09:49] see he can't do it put on your coat
[1:09:51] honey he can't do it little arm is up
[1:09:53] down and around it takes your Steady
[1:09:56] Hand that's right oh how glad I am I can
[1:09:58] just yield my hand to Father say Lord
[1:10:01] Jesus I can't get in there you help me
[1:10:03] put the cat on me I quit trying just let
[1:10:06] him do it see if the little baby keeps
[1:10:09] trying oh I can do it I can do it and
[1:10:12] he's just everywhere he can't do it
[1:10:14] neither can you neither can I but if
[1:10:17] we'll just hold still and let him do it
[1:10:19] just yield to him here Lord here I am uh
[1:10:23] just let me be nothing I yield put my
[1:10:27] hand in the right you put my hand in the
[1:10:29] right place that's the victory that's
[1:10:32] overcoming the thing you have to
[1:10:34] overcome is yourself yes your idea your
[1:10:38] thing and surrender yourself to him he
[1:10:40] overcome for you he knows the way we
[1:10:44] don't that's right amen that's right but
[1:10:47] then but then people who get all kind of
[1:10:48] religious they want to try and put their
[1:10:50] hand in the coat I want to try and do
[1:10:52] something you know all you have to do is
[1:10:54] die
[1:10:55] amen and really be dead that's all you
[1:10:57] need to do amen you just got to yield
[1:11:01] yourself
[1:11:03] now people have such a I I'll just put
[1:11:06] it out this way if people have never
[1:11:07] experienced the power of God they say
[1:11:09] it's not for
[1:11:10] them amen maybe that's a bit strong but
[1:11:14] you know people you know people have an
[1:11:15] idea well we're in the message now in
[1:11:18] the days of the power of God a past cuz
[1:11:20] we're in a different age but God doesn't
[1:11:22] take away he adds that's right it's
[1:11:24] everything he does in former ages he
[1:11:26] still does he adds to amen so
[1:11:29] people people say that God now I just
[1:11:32] had this list now people people say God
[1:11:35] doesn't deliver and said the person
[1:11:38] who's never been delivered amen God
[1:11:41] doesn't set people free by his word said
[1:11:44] the person who's never been set free but
[1:11:46] it says in the Psalms he sent his word
[1:11:48] and healed them and delivered them from
[1:11:50] their
[1:11:51] destructions Hallelujah cuz people just
[1:11:53] say I've got to basically live with my
[1:11:55] problems you don't have to live with no
[1:11:57] problems amen whom the son has set free
[1:11:59] is free indeed he says he sent his word
[1:12:02] and healed them and delivered them and
[1:12:04] he sent his word into this age not for
[1:12:06] you just to live with things and wrestle
[1:12:08] with things but for you to die on The
[1:12:09] Altar and be set free amen amen as we as
[1:12:13] we read there and you shall then said
[1:12:16] Jesus to those Jews which believed on
[1:12:19] him if you continue in my word then are
[1:12:22] ye my disciples indeed and you shall
[1:12:25] know the truth and the truth shall make
[1:12:27] you free the truth is going to make you
[1:12:30] free now to continue is to stay this is
[1:12:33] the Greek the meaning it's a verb is it
[1:12:36] it's to stay it's to abide to dwell to
[1:12:40] endure to be present remain to
[1:12:44] stand amen so if you continue in the
[1:12:46] word doesn't matter what you I said last
[1:12:49] Sunday about Elijah standing flat foot
[1:12:51] on the trial but he ran from Jezebel but
[1:12:54] he didn't it didn't waver his faith in
[1:12:56] God that's right amen amen so he stood
[1:13:00] flat footed in his faith even though he
[1:13:02] ran he say well that doesn't sound like
[1:13:04] no cuz he never became a believer of
[1:13:06] Baal that's right amen he still stood on
[1:13:08] the word of God that's right amen and so
[1:13:11] you may have to do things like he did
[1:13:13] run but as long as your faith doesn't
[1:13:17] waver amen amen as long as your faith
[1:13:19] his faith never wavered he knew who he
[1:13:22] was he knew who God was he didn't begin
[1:13:24] to believe a lie
[1:13:26] and so we have to stay to remain in the
[1:13:28] word it means as I said it means to
[1:13:31] endure amen who's ured amen amen we have
[1:13:35] to you know there's going to be
[1:13:37] Overcomers on that day it's all
[1:13:39] Overcomers walking into heaven and so we
[1:13:42] have to overcome we have to wrestle we
[1:13:44] have to overcome there's a victory that
[1:13:46] God wants to see in your life amen amen
[1:13:49] amen he doesn't just push a button and
[1:13:50] say there's the Rapture you've got to
[1:13:52] fight every inch amen amen but G is in
[1:13:55] you that is in the world just need the
[1:13:57] Holy Ghost and you'll overcome amen
[1:14:00] people try and work it out in their mind
[1:14:01] forget working it out in your mind well
[1:14:03] this is how we be Christians forget it
[1:14:05] say God consume me change my thinking to
[1:14:08] match your thinking that's all you
[1:14:11] need you got got to let go are you done
[1:14:15] see people wrestling you see a Living
[1:14:17] Sacrifice you know are you done just
[1:14:20] give up have you really given up are you
[1:14:22] done cuz if you're done you can't be
[1:14:25] consumed amen the fire can't fall if
[1:14:27] you're still
[1:14:29] wrestling just give up amen just give up
[1:14:33] that's all you need to do now this shall
[1:14:36] make you free it means to
[1:14:39] liberate Amen to deliver to make free so
[1:14:43] so the truth if you continue in his word
[1:14:46] the truth shall make you free amen so
[1:14:48] there's power and just abiding in the
[1:14:50] truth there's a force in the word amen
[1:14:53] that will make you free Jesus just say
[1:14:55] things he said You shall know the truth
[1:14:58] we have the Vindicated truth of the hour
[1:15:00] amen we have the we have thus sayi the
[1:15:02] Lord on this word so we know the truth
[1:15:06] not we shall maybe one day where it is
[1:15:08] you know the truth therefore the truth
[1:15:11] shall make you freej if you're bound
[1:15:13] just recognize devil I know the truth
[1:15:16] hallelujah and the truth said it will
[1:15:19] make me free because the truth is not a
[1:15:21] collection of of facts or phrases or IDE
[1:15:25] years or a school of thought the truth
[1:15:27] is a person the truth is Jesus Christ am
[1:15:31] and he is the word amen so when it says
[1:15:34] and the truth shall make you free it's
[1:15:36] actually saying I'm going to come and
[1:15:37] make you free amen that's amen the truth
[1:15:39] I myself are going to make you free yeah
[1:15:42] Hallelujah the truth is a
[1:15:45] person so you know and then some people
[1:15:48] say you know it's okay to live with the
[1:15:51] devil said the person who's got being
[1:15:54] gotten used to being a
[1:15:55] slave amen don't be a
[1:16:00] slave thank you don't be a slave do not
[1:16:04] get used to living a half-cooked
[1:16:07] Christianity life amen if he said You
[1:16:10] shall know the truth the truth shall
[1:16:11] make you free I just hinged my whole
[1:16:13] soul on that verse I know the truth see
[1:16:16] if you're bound you don't have to stay
[1:16:18] bound I just I was just thinking let's

[1:17:16] was expecting it but if no one has ever
[1:17:18] carried in the service or expected God
[1:17:21] to come down well then they'll just walk
[1:17:23] out and go home yeah cuz I think oh that
[1:17:26] good preaching and then I just go home
[1:17:28] it's more than that amen amen you can
[1:17:31] I'll you know I'll find the I'll find
[1:17:33] the I'll find the quote this is in
[1:17:36] questions and
[1:17:39] answers he says this this is the
[1:17:42] question dear brother Bram do you
[1:17:44] believe that signs should follow all who
[1:17:46] have the Holy Spirit Jesus said so Mark
[1:17:48] 16 if so what about the people who
[1:17:51] believe the message with all that is in
[1:17:53] them yet they have not these signs are
[1:17:56] they unbelievers or do they need the
[1:17:57] Holy Ghost if so please instruct us
[1:18:00] today how to receive the Holy Ghost we
[1:18:02] believe your God's mouthpiece for our
[1:18:04] day your brother remember these signs
[1:18:06] following them the believe they just
[1:18:08] follow your life you don't have to try
[1:18:10] and generate anything it just follows
[1:18:12] your life that's what it means by these
[1:18:14] signs shall follow so you don't have to
[1:18:15] have a checklist and say well have I
[1:18:17] raised the dead if I cast out Devils
[1:18:19] have I spoken just walk with God and if
[1:18:21] he's in you these signs will follow amen
[1:18:24] amen lay upon the sick they shall
[1:18:25] recover amen y I mean just just walk
[1:18:28] with God but he says this thank you my
[1:18:30] brother for regarding
[1:18:33] me as your brother and I think that's a
[1:18:36] very good question friends yes it's a
[1:18:39] little slack I'd like to deal a bit
[1:18:40] longer on it if I could see some of you
[1:18:43] see when you cannot receive remember
[1:18:47] some of you see when you cannot receive
[1:18:49] the baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[1:18:50] having an experience when it happens now
[1:18:52] if you believe every spec of the word
[1:18:55] you say you uh so you say you believe
[1:18:58] every spec of it then the word is laying
[1:19:00] there waiting for the Holy Spirit to put
[1:19:02] it to work but it takes the lighting of
[1:19:05] the
[1:19:06] candle here's the candle with the wick
[1:19:09] in it and with all the Tallow and
[1:19:10] everything in it has to um uh it has to
[1:19:14] have in that candle but until the fire
[1:19:17] comes on it it will not shine any light
[1:19:20] no matter how perfect the candle is and
[1:19:23] how perfect it'll burn burn and
[1:19:25] everything it's got to be Litt and then
[1:19:27] it burns and when you believe and are
[1:19:30] made and are made up of the instructions
[1:19:32] of the holy spirit is Joy love peace
[1:19:34] long suffering goodness the fruits that
[1:19:36] it Bears out until the holy spirit with
[1:19:38] a fire experience comes down and lights
[1:19:41] that candle then you haven't received
[1:19:43] the Holy Ghost SE you've got to have the
[1:19:46] experience to have the Holy Ghost well
[1:19:49] do I look for some big experience no I
[1:19:51] just say put yourself on the altar amen
[1:19:54] cuz if you're totally dead on the altar
[1:19:56] then the fire comes down because people
[1:19:59] and and and I've seen it around people
[1:20:01] look for an experience but the
[1:20:03] experience is never big enough to what
[1:20:04] they think it is so they go seeking for
[1:20:07] something bigger and bigger and there's
[1:20:08] no stability in their walk right but
[1:20:10] then they forget just just just are you
[1:20:13] done yet are you dead upon the altar yet
[1:20:16] if you're dead upon the altar then God
[1:20:18] all has to come down and consume the
[1:20:20] sacrifice amen but he's saying that the
[1:20:22] candle has to be lit it's not some
[1:20:25] gradual thing the candle's got to be lit
[1:20:26] somewhere you got to look back in your
[1:20:28] life and say something happened to me I
[1:20:31] can maybe not put my finger on the exact
[1:20:33] moment but my life is very different
[1:20:34] from then to now what's happened the
[1:20:36] candle got lit amen amen and you'll know
[1:20:40] when the candle's
[1:20:41] lit
[1:20:43] hallelujah amen so we have to the fire's
[1:20:46] got to come down and consume we how do
[1:20:48] you how do you know I've got it the fire
[1:20:51] has to come down and consume your old
[1:20:53] Nature's and desire
[1:20:55] amen your old life has to be dead it has
[1:20:58] to be consumed out the things you once
[1:21:01] did you don't do again the things you
[1:21:03] once love you hate the things you used
[1:21:05] to hate you now love right amen that's
[1:21:09] when you know a nature because you know
[1:21:12] people can have a great Supernatural
[1:21:13] experience but unless their old Nature's
[1:21:15] burned out right then they can go back
[1:21:17] into the world I mean they can go back
[1:21:20] and do other things but if the desire is
[1:21:22] dead that's why you know a sacrifice on
[1:21:25] an altar if it's burnt up and consumed
[1:21:28] it's not a it's not its old form anymore
[1:21:30] it's turned into ashes and carried away
[1:21:33] amen amen the fire burns up the
[1:21:35] sacrifice and so the fire of God has to
[1:21:38] change your
[1:21:39] nature amen well I'm afraid of this and
[1:21:43] this I don't want to be a peculiar you
[1:21:46] know the scripture says we're A peculiar
[1:21:48] people amen a royal priesthood a holy
[1:21:50] nation you can't help being you can't
[1:21:53] walk with God and with the world amen
[1:21:56] amen what do you have to gain oh my
[1:21:58] friends will leave me but heaven will
[1:22:00] receive me amen which would you rather
[1:22:02] have all right oh but they'll call me
[1:22:04] some oldfashioned something I'd rather
[1:22:06] be have oldtime religion amen and and
[1:22:09] then have the spirit of compromise amen
[1:22:12] hallelujah so so your Nature's got to be
[1:22:14] changed that's how you know you're
[1:22:15] different cuz your
[1:22:17] desires you're you got a totally new
[1:22:19] desire in you that's why brother B says
[1:22:21] I smoke all I want and I'll just put my
[1:22:24] me in there I smoke all I want I drink
[1:22:27] all I want I run around party all I want
[1:22:31] amen I wear all the shorts I want I go
[1:22:35] to the movies all I want I do but
[1:22:38] there's nothing in me to want those
[1:22:39] things so I don't do it why cuz my
[1:22:42] Nature's been burned out amen so if
[1:22:46] there's something in you doesn't
[1:22:47] physically want those things even though
[1:22:49] sin we know sin is enticing that's why
[1:22:51] people fall for it CU it's enticing but
[1:22:54] if there's a nature in here that doesn't
[1:22:55] want that thing that's a whole different
[1:22:58] thing amen hallelujah amen so the fire's
[1:23:02] got to come down and consume your old
[1:23:04] nature and
[1:23:05] desires that's why we can Rejoice if
[1:23:08] your Nature's been changed you say what
[1:23:10] did that Christ Hallelujah he came in
[1:23:14] amen I now have a different life
[1:23:17] Hallelujah now brother bam talks about
[1:23:21] this in the sermon a hidden life I know
[1:23:22] it's brother Andy's probably favorite
[1:23:24] sermon
[1:23:25] and so he speaks about the Tabernacle
[1:23:27] you know there's the three there's the
[1:23:28] outer Court the inner court and there's
[1:23:30] the holy of holies and that is our
[1:23:32] Christian Journey from the outer Court
[1:23:34] you come in with the sacrifice and you
[1:23:36] go into the inner Court then you go into
[1:23:37] the very presence of
[1:23:39] God and the life the life you're are
[1:23:42] living now actually reveals where you
[1:23:44] are in that
[1:23:46] process amen well you say well I believe
[1:23:49] the word brother B you know you know he
[1:23:51] says in the token he says but I believe
[1:23:54] everything you say brother bar he says
[1:23:55] that's good but that's just being able
[1:23:57] to read amen that's just being but it
[1:24:00] says you have must receive the
[1:24:02] life amen the fire's got to fall on the
[1:24:05] sacrifice it can't just lay there no
[1:24:07] matter how perfectly arranged the fire's
[1:24:10] got to fall amen
[1:24:13] amen he says sure they eat man are out
[1:24:16] there so speak about the inner Court I
[1:24:18] mean sorry outside but they don't know
[1:24:21] about this they've never been in there
[1:24:23] speaking of the presence of God have you
[1:24:26] my dear brother don't despise my
[1:24:28] ignorance but I want to ask you
[1:24:30] something Have you ever come to the
[1:24:33] place in your life where Christ meant
[1:24:35] more to you so he's actually showing
[1:24:37] this is actually what qualifies us now
[1:24:39] because you say well I'm you know I'm in
[1:24:41] the inner Veil where the glories never
[1:24:42] fail well how does that actually that
[1:24:44] can just be a word that can just be a
[1:24:46] phrase I'm living in the prin of the
[1:24:48] king how's that lived
[1:24:50] out amen cuz these these things are not
[1:24:53] just are fairy Pie in the Sky amen these
[1:24:57] are these are real things
[1:25:00] Hallelujah and so have you ever come to
[1:25:03] a place in life where Christ meant more
[1:25:06] to you than all the arguing you could do
[1:25:09] about your church has
[1:25:13] Christ uh has Christ meant more to you
[1:25:16] than all the world I don't mean from an
[1:25:18] emotion or mental workup I mean from the
[1:25:21] depths of your heart that something set
[1:25:24] settled in there that something's taking
[1:25:26] place that you don't know how it come
[1:25:30] but you're hid away and your whole
[1:25:33] motive is to serve Jesus Christ amen is
[1:25:38] that now your whole you don't care what

[1:26:11] where you don't care what anyone says
[1:26:14] not to go out and out um not to go out
[1:26:17] and act smart but till the love of God
[1:26:19] Is So anchored into you that you can't
[1:26:22] see nothing else your whole motive is to
[1:26:26] do the will of God love for everybody
[1:26:29] flowing free from somewhere what a place
[1:26:32] to live that's the hidden place that's
[1:26:35] the place where you got to come to my
[1:26:37] brethren that's the place where God
[1:26:40] Reveals His secret things that's the
[1:26:43] place where God does the placing and the
[1:26:45] calling you get what I mean have you
[1:26:48] come to that place well I can understand
[1:26:51] what the message says and everything but

[1:27:08] Rapture amen have you come to that place
[1:27:11] where God means everything to you amen
[1:27:15] amen more
[1:27:16] than who cares what other people say
[1:27:19] have you come to that place I don't you

[1:27:23] here I don't serve God because of my
[1:27:25] wife I don't serve God because of my
[1:27:27] parents or my family I serve God cuz I
[1:27:29] met him amen amen he became he spoke to
[1:27:32] me I spoke back to him I mean he became
[1:27:34] real to me that's why I served God why
[1:27:37] cuz I came into that how did I get to
[1:27:39] that hidden place I died I laid upon I
[1:27:42] was hearing the message Stones were
[1:27:43] being placed and I laid upon that altar
[1:27:46] in my room and I didn't get up
[1:27:50] Hallelujah the old man was
[1:27:52] consumed amen oh he doesn't do that
[1:27:54] anymore I'm sorry but I've had the
[1:27:55] experience yes amen God changes people
[1:27:58] like that if you'll let them that's
[1:28:00] right you don't have to go through some
[1:28:02] self-help program he sent his word and
[1:28:05] it healed them and delivered them from
[1:28:06] their destruction well yet Peter spake
[1:28:09] these words of what the resurrection
[1:28:11] Jesus being the same yesterday today and
[1:28:13] forever God is here as the what as he
[1:28:16] spake these words what happened the Holy
[1:28:18] Ghost fell oh but he doesn't do that
[1:28:21] anymore I'm sorry but he does I've been
[1:28:23] in meeting and see the Holy Ghost fall
[1:28:25] upon people while preaching's happening
[1:28:28] amen the same God does the same things
[1:28:31] Hallelujah he's the same one but then if
[1:28:33] we sit back and we're reserved about
[1:28:35] these things if you hold if you try and
[1:28:37] hold back you got to let go that's right
[1:28:40] right amen just just let God and let him
[1:28:43] have his way amen but I'm worried what
[1:28:45] people will think don't worry what
[1:28:47] people will think what is there's
[1:28:50] holding power in the word of God that's
[1:28:52] right amen how do you you know Cain
[1:28:55] asked God am I My Brother's
[1:28:57] Keeper and he was his brother's keeper
[1:29:00] well how do you keep your brother how do
[1:29:02] you keep your family it's not by just
[1:29:04] trying to please them amen if you stand
[1:29:08] upon the word in love amen if you make a
[1:29:12] clear-cut decision say God I'm serving
[1:29:14] you it doesn't matter what happens amen
[1:29:17] then there's keeping power that God can
[1:29:19] use you and get your family amen amen
[1:29:21] but if you compromise and do all these
[1:29:23] things you say Lord get a hold of my
[1:29:24] family he's going to get a hold of you
[1:29:26] first that's right amen because God you
[1:29:29] say God speak to my family he saying I
[1:29:31] need to use you that's right amen he is
[1:29:34] waiting you say Lord open the heavens
[1:29:36] and speak to them and God's saying get
[1:29:38] on the altar that's right amen be
[1:29:40] consumed and then I'll use you to reach
[1:29:42] your family I'll use you to reach your
[1:29:45] people you're burden for amen hallelujah
[1:29:48] God must have skin on friends that's not
[1:29:51] too radical I don't think he he was a
[1:29:53] god with skin on and Jesus and the
[1:29:55] prophets and the apostles and all the
[1:29:57] Believers down through God had skin on
[1:29:59] them amen hallelujah and it's the same
[1:30:00] today as it was back
[1:30:02] then so what are you going to are you
[1:30:05] done
[1:30:06] yet well I'm saved I said are you done
[1:30:09] yet amen remember a Living Sacrifice
[1:30:12] don't get off the
[1:30:14] altar amen you got to be on there and
[1:30:17] let the Fire Fall you got to open your
[1:30:19] heart and just let them do
[1:30:22] it well I have all these things hey look
[1:30:25] Caleb and Joshua they had a lot of
[1:30:26] problems they had Giants they had cities
[1:30:29] they had whole nations against them in
[1:30:30] the promised land what did they
[1:30:34] do did they now did they PL did they
[1:30:38] stand in the wilderness and train the
[1:30:40] Army amen did they did they build Siege
[1:30:43] equipment to take Jericho what did they
[1:30:44] do they had faith in the word that was
[1:30:47] given them that's how they took Jericho
[1:30:50] that's how they took the promised land
[1:30:51] because God had given them the land
[1:30:55] amen Paul poses this question to the
[1:30:59] Galatians he
[1:31:01] says this only what I learn of you
[1:31:03] received ye the Spirit by The Works of
[1:31:05] the law or by the hearing of
[1:31:09] Faith oh ye so foolish are you so
[1:31:13] foolish having begun in the spirit that
[1:31:15] ye are now made perfect by the flesh
[1:31:18] have you suffered so many things in vain
[1:31:20] if it be yet in vain he that ministereth
[1:31:23] to you the the spirit and worketh
[1:31:24] miracles among you that he do it by The
[1:31:27] Works of the law or by the hearing of
[1:31:29] Faith so he's actually asking them how's
[1:31:32] this all happening is it just by The
[1:31:34] Works of the law or is it by the hearing
[1:31:36] of faith and he's actually telling them
[1:31:38] it's not by The Works of the law but
[1:31:41] it's by the hearing of Faith so Faith
[1:31:43] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:31:45] word of God Amen and so when and so
[1:31:48] that's in Galatians 3 2:5 and so now
[1:31:52] there's a law it said You shall know the
[1:31:54] truth and the truth shall make you free
[1:31:57] so there's a law of Faith now that when
[1:31:59] the word comes into someone's heart they
[1:32:01] believe it then that word will have an
[1:32:03] outworking in their life amen amen and
[1:32:05] that word will give them overcoming
[1:32:07] power over
[1:32:08] everything amen that's a that is thew to
[1:32:11] me that's the law of Faith amen someone
[1:32:15] someone speaks it the person believes it
[1:32:17] then it's lived out amen Caleb and
[1:32:19] Joshua they heard the word they received
[1:32:22] it into their souls and they said I
[1:32:24] believe it they responded amen and then
[1:32:26] they took the land Hallelujah that was
[1:32:29] that was how they took the land and
[1:32:31] we're the same as they were we must take
[1:32:33] the land we must take our inheritance am
[1:32:35] Hallelujah we must press it and take it
[1:32:37] you say well God doesn't supernaturally
[1:32:39] deliver anymore I'm sorry but he
[1:32:42] does I used to be bound down with all
[1:32:44] kinds of things and it was the end of a
[1:32:46] tape and a woman was
[1:32:48] crying
[1:32:49] weeping and then and then brother R says
[1:32:51] don't you remember when you first met
[1:32:53] the Lord and it just broke just like
[1:32:56] that amen amen just like that I didn't
[1:32:59] need a self-help book I didn't need to
[1:33:00] work through things I just believe the
[1:33:02] word hey I believe in counseling there's
[1:33:05] all there's all that is part of it too
[1:33:07] but God delivers these ways as well
[1:33:10] right you know he says about he was I
[1:33:12] think it was um I think it's in the
[1:33:13] start of the service he's talking about
[1:33:16] how he he he had some private interviews
[1:33:18] which is counseling amen with some
[1:33:20] couples but he said but he but but he
[1:33:23] said but now then then God came down
[1:33:24] when they talking and delivered the
[1:33:26] people so I said it takes that it takes
[1:33:29] it touch of God to do what he needs to
[1:33:32] do so it's not just the talking or
[1:33:35] hearing the word it takes God to drop it
[1:33:36] into your soul amen and and and change
[1:33:40] the
[1:33:41] person you know I just heard uh sister
[1:33:44] Ruth's mom Kate was here at Camp you
[1:33:47] know Bruce and Kate moer at Camp she had
[1:33:49] a problem with her knee and and and if I

[1:35:21] young people say Lord touch the young
[1:35:22] people say God we all young people touch
[1:35:25] all of us amen because they must see God
[1:35:28] is real amen that this is not theology
[1:35:31] we are not message Baptists what does
[1:35:34] that mean a Baptist just says I believe
[1:35:35] there's no change in the life that's
[1:35:37] right Apollos was a Baptist yeah you
[1:35:39] know brother Braham takes Acts end of
[1:35:41] Acts 18:19 where where where Paul meets
[1:35:44] Apollos and some disciples and Apollos
[1:35:47] only knew the baptism of John but he
[1:35:49] preached from the scripture that Jesus
[1:35:50] was the Christ you go away and read it
[1:35:53] and brother says he was a Baptist they
[1:35:55] were a group of Baptists they were
[1:35:57] baptizing but they knew nothing of the
[1:35:59] power of God coming amen we are not that
[1:36:03] way we are not message Baptists where
[1:36:06] they just confess it they say when you
[1:36:07] believe you receive it but they never
[1:36:10] received it they just say they believe
[1:36:12] so they just confess it but there's no
[1:36:13] change there's no proof amen that God is
[1:36:17] really there we're not that way we're
[1:36:20] not a bunch of confessors which are you
[1:36:23] know without The
[1:36:24] Possession amen we have what we need
[1:36:28] amen hallelujah the bride you know Jesus
[1:36:30] says in as in John 8 just before he said
[1:36:33] You shall know the truth the truth shall
[1:36:35] make you free he says he says I am one
[1:36:39] that bear witness of myself and the
[1:36:41] father that sent me beareth witness of
[1:36:43] me then they said unto them where is thy
[1:36:45] father Jesus answered you neither know
[1:36:47] me nor my father for if you had known me
[1:36:50] you should have known my father also so
[1:36:53] Jesus was saying I bear witness of
[1:36:55] myself but the father also beareth
[1:36:57] witness that I say is true and what is
[1:36:59] that he said it's not me that doeth the
[1:37:01] works the Supernatural is the father
[1:37:03] dwelleth in me that doeth the works so
[1:37:05] Jesus spoke it and then God I say the
[1:37:08] father supernaturally Vindicated what he
[1:37:10] was saying amen so there was a
[1:37:13] Vindication there something came in
[1:37:15] behind him just like the prophets Elijah
[1:37:17] any man could have stood up and said
[1:37:19] let's build an altar and the god that
[1:37:20] answers by fire let him come but then it
[1:37:23] was very different when he stood up and
[1:37:24] said it cuz now that God that he was
[1:37:27] representing came in behind and backed
[1:37:29] up what he said amen hallelujah and it
[1:37:32] must be the same thing for you friends
[1:37:34] God has to come and back up what you say
[1:37:37] back up your life supernaturally amen
[1:37:40] amen hey if God you say oh brother Bam's
[1:37:42] V deicated what about you amen if you
[1:37:45] say God is alive well he should be alive
[1:37:47] in your life as I said these signs shall
[1:37:49] follow them that believe so just walk
[1:37:51] with God and as you walk with God he do
[1:37:53] things like what well I prayed for
[1:37:56] Johnny or some you know one of my
[1:37:58] children they got well I I was going
[1:38:01] through a real crisis and he came upon
[1:38:02] the scene amen amen amen things it
[1:38:05] looked like life was falling apart but
[1:38:06] he kept us together Hallelujah I prayed
[1:38:09] for this and then he came upon the scene
[1:38:11] and answered my prayer amen amen amen
[1:38:14] that is what God coming in behind amen
[1:38:17] now remember God can still answer prayer
[1:38:19] even if you're an
[1:38:21] unbeliever but God answers the prayers
[1:38:23] of the
[1:38:24] right you're following me is this all
[1:38:26] right amen so God there has to be a
[1:38:29] Vindication y amen if if brother Braham
[1:38:33] and and it wasn't him saying it people
[1:38:34] get this all mixed up he says at the end
[1:38:36] of his ministry I'll ride this Trail
[1:38:38] again so he's basically saying I'm going
[1:38:40] to have another ministry again and some
[1:38:43] people take that they think he's going
[1:38:44] to do it himself yeah but it's actually
[1:38:47] God speaking in first person through a
[1:38:48] man saying the same Ministry is going to
[1:38:50] be lived out the same Trail is going to
[1:38:52] be rid right remember David said said in
[1:38:55] the Psalms my God my God why has Thou
[1:38:58] forsaken me it wasn't he wasn't forsaken
[1:39:01] he was looking at Calvary but it was God
[1:39:03] speaking first person through a man amen
[1:39:06] I trust trust it doesn't stumble you
[1:39:08] when a pro would stand up and say I'll
[1:39:09] ride this Trail again it's not himself
[1:39:11] speaking it it's the Holy Ghost saying
[1:39:13] I'm going to do these same things and
[1:39:15] well the brother braham's not coming
[1:39:17] back he's only coming back when the dead
[1:39:19] in Christ rise but then it's all done
[1:39:21] that's right so how is God going to
[1:39:22] write a TR again through the bride of
[1:39:24] Christ amen that the ministry of the
[1:39:27] bride of Christ is going to be
[1:39:28] supernaturally Vindicated hallelujah
[1:39:30] amen and that's just not the fivefold
[1:39:32] ministry that's every member every
[1:39:34] member's got a
[1:39:35] Ministry
[1:39:37] hallelujah amen so don't you know you
[1:39:41] stand upon the
[1:39:42] word then God is obligated to back you
[1:39:46] up that's like you know you I told the
[1:39:48] testimony before where I think it uh you
[1:39:52] know we had that worship service at
[1:39:53] brother Andy's those years ago and there
[1:39:56] there was a woman there and we got
[1:39:57] talking about about woman preachers and
[1:40:00] so on and then she comes so so I'm uh
[1:40:04] and then so I said oh I'd like to hear
[1:40:06] your testimony thing so she had it
[1:40:08] written down and then while I'm at work
[1:40:10] she goes to see Christine at our house
[1:40:13] and she thinks here's this little timid
[1:40:15] little girl I'm just going to take the
[1:40:17] Bible and smash you to pieces basically
[1:40:20] and then Christine begins to share the
[1:40:22] testimony why she doesn't cut her hair I
[1:40:25] mean how the Lord delivered her from the
[1:40:27] drunk guy with the knife you know the
[1:40:28] crazy man with the knife and then
[1:40:30] delivered her from the men and the dogs
[1:40:33] in the park when she's walking along
[1:40:35] Hallelujah and then you you know why she
[1:40:37] doesn't cut her hair why she wears
[1:40:38] dresses all these things and the spirit
[1:40:40] of God dropped down into the house and
[1:40:42] she fled from the house without her bag
[1:40:44] amen you ask her what is that I don't
[1:40:48] just bear witness of myself but my
[1:40:49] father Bears witness that this is the
[1:40:51] truth amen hallelujah Hallelujah so it's
[1:40:53] more than just well this is Bible
[1:40:55] Doctrine it goes beyond that goes beyond
[1:40:57] this is the truth just say but God comes
[1:41:00] in behind and says yes this is me
