said is Wednesday and you made it good job amen let's open our Bibles the books of um Hebrews thank you chapter 11 verse 36 and the Bible says um and alls had Trials of cruel mocking and scorin oh what however you say that word ye more of Bones and princ Ms they were Stone they were swn as s were tempted were slain with a sword they wander about in sheep skins and gold skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and this all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise God having provided some better things for us that day without us so should not be made perfect amen let's bow ahead almighty God we want to give you thanks because you are an awesome God Lord thank you Lord for bringing us to your house tonight in this moment Lord in public I recognize that I'm no one Lord and I need you to talk to your people so please Lord use my lips to bless your people in Jesus Christ's name I ask you this amen amen you may have your seat I love the chapter is Hebrews 11 is just awesome amen and what I want to talk tonight is the grit now I didn't know the meaning of this word but I hear it before so I went to Google and says like like a kind of sand but I was like no that's not the grd that brother B was talking about so I search it and grit is a grit is a personality trait possessed by individuals who demonstrate passion and perseverance towards a goal despite being confronted by significant obstacles and destructions oh my all this brothers that die and give their lives for the gospel they had the great they had a backbone now greed is not a word that you can find in the Bible but there are two words and they're very similar one of them is a stead fastness fastness sorry the quality of being resolutely or that dutifully how do you say that word um fear and I'm wavering so after reading that I was like I need another description for that word because I didn't understand any of those words and said the quality of staying the same for a long time and not changing quickly or unexpectedly they made up their minds and they were going to follow Christ and they follow Christ till the end that's it they didn't care about the end the way that they were going to die they just decided to follow Christ and they did it the other word that it sounds like grit kind of similar it's endurance and endurance is the ability to endure an unpleasant or difficult process or situation without giving way yeah the capacity of something to last or to withstand where and here so people that they go to a marathon and they run they have endurance they have run and run and run for like 10ks and they made it at the end now in 2 Kings chapter 5 there's a beautiful story and I like this story it says verse two and the syrians had gone out by companies and had brought away captives out of the land of Israel a little man and she waited at how do you say the name of this guy N N's wife and she said unto her mistress will God my Lord wherewith the prophet that is in Samaria for the wood recover him of his leprosy and one went in and told his Lord saying thus and thus said the maid that is in the land of Israel this little lady she was just a princess amen and the Bible doesn't say her name but she was so important she was too captive there was no Mommy and Daddy but she trusted the Lord and she was still a Christian Amen in that situation without mommy and daddy where will you stand he testimony she said to um neon's wife there is a man that can help you oh I trust the Lord that you all kids you you can be a testimony like that girl you have no idea the impact of your words cuz she was a little my dad told me that when he was little he was not allowed to talk on the table that was something that only grown up were able to do but that little lady she didn't care about that because she knew something that could help that guy I trust the Lord that you can put your name in that situation amen now this lady she hadit a backbone and now the backbone is a the spine or backbone is a bony structure that supports your body it connects different parts of your what do I do this thing system which include your body's bones and muscles but in Spanish is muscular skto you try to say that thing now we have these creatures in the nature they are called jelly jellyfish they have no backbone uhuh yeah the amazing what's amazing is like they actually can swim but they're not strong enough so when the wave push them to one side they just have to go to that side CU they cannot swim strong enough to get out of there w now if you're a Christian you're going to have a backbone that can help you to swim out of the tides otherwise you're going to get drag to any situation any Trend or anything you're going to get just Dru any I'm going to stop it there I'm sorry brother Brandon says you say well I've been a timid person Moses said the same thing just reminds me one time over a football stadium I was preaching in I walk in it said a little sign up over there said it is not the size of the dog in the fight is the size of the fight in the dog so that's a good idea you may not be very big but get a lot of things about you but you get a lot of fight about about you you got to get into it anything I he to see is a spineless person call himself a Christian my God God want somebody with greit and backbone I like old buddy Robinson said Lord give me the backbone the size of a soul L put plenty of knowledge in the gable gable and of my soul and let me fight the devil as long as I got one Toth and then gum him till I die and he did that's right I that he go down in this in the cornfield and he said Lord if you don't give me the baptism of the Holy Ghost when you come back to earth you are going to find a pile of bones laying right here God gave him the Holy Ghost you go to get determinate that's right get ready take over God said so let's go take over that's what God wants wanted us to do amen that's what God want us to do tonight God always willing to give us if you were ready to receive it that's right God's made the promise so it is ours the promise is unto you and to your children to them that far off even as many as the Lord God shall call so the promise is here amen amen amen another um like an example of fight it's like when Paul wrote to Timothy or timoo says I have fought a good fight I have finished my course my race I have kept the faith hence for there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness with the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearance let the Lord help us to finish this race it cannot be easy and it's not going to be easy all the time but we're going to Made It by the Lord's Grace I hope you can see that that's a 12 Apostles and the way that their lives physical life ended so he say that Peter was crucified upside down Matthew he was beheaded Andrew crucified on an x-shaped cross Thomas P with a spear James beheaded James CED to death John died for an old aged Simon sown in half Philip crucified Jude be HED of um covered to death sorry bomeo sorry I'm not going to say that it's just way too strong for the kids and Judas he commits swde that was not easy guys to die for the cause of Christ back then was really hard you had to give gave your life the Lord give them the strength and the spirit to die for for him so don't give up amen now that's that kind of second theme Here I really would like to talk to you about kind of friendship our talks about this and I was like yes this is important but he was a young person ages ago [Laughter] and so in that age when you can see those kids probably they're like seven eight you can be friend with pretty much anyone anyone there's not much difference you just want to play some soccer and eat some lollies and that's it but when you car on groin there's some differences that start to appear and this is for you guys cuz um yeah uh I was not able I didn't have a backbone back then when I was young and um yeah it's tough cuz you trying to fit with your friends at school but they are not the same you're different and I hope you can realize that you're different in a good way hallelujah amen so when you start growing then the boys they don't want to be boys anymore they want to be men and what's a mean men is someone that smokes and drinks and go out with girls and if you're not careful you're going to ended up the same way that's what happened outside there come on but if you have the True Grit if you are strong enough in your faith you're going to be able to shine outside there because we can come here on Wednesday or Sundays and we can put our holy face that's right but the important thing is when we are out of here when the people can see us and if they cannot see any difference why are they going to even try to be Christians when um I remember when I was in the world I always had like a respect for those guys that were that they were trying to be Christian cuz I was not trying at all and even when some people they were making fun of them I was like don't make fun of them these guys are actually doing something I remember that um there was a girl that she used to drink and go out with us and she was it looks very bad in a girl but that girl from one day to another one she she stopped going out with us and something happened she's said going to church and from one day to another one she was different she didn't want to be called with the same nickname she wanted to be called by her real name Jasmine and she started look happy all the time and I remember I said to my friend I need that I knew exactly what it was cuz I grew up in church yeah but I didn't have the true greet but the life that you live outside is an important thing because people can see that you have something different imagine if that girl wouldn't never change I would never say that thing like I need that but she was able to shine outside and that's important thing amen um yeah for the boys like it is hard sometimes when you can see all your friends going starting to going out with GS and stuff but you know what's right and it can happen the same thing that happened to Israel when then decided to follow a man instead to keep having Christ God as a king don't trust in yourself trust in the Lord amen amen and um yeah I also remember CU I didn't have any grit on me I was I was going to church but I was not in church I didn't want it to be in church when I was a teenage I didn't want it to be in church so I start living like a double life so outside the doors of my house I was swearing and I was I I had a pirates mouth my parents they didn't grab me like that but I was just swearing every second word in my mouth was just a swearing word I was swearing swearing swearing and um after a while I had to start thinking cuz if I was with my friends I had to be one person and if I was at home I had to be another person and if I was in church I had to be another person wow and after a while I got good I was just able to be different different and different but that's not life the hard thing was when my friends they were going to my house and I had to contact like in a man I was shocked because I had to behave for my parents and when my parents were not there I had to be with my friends and you don't want that in your life make you sure that you to pray the Lord and to give you the strength just to be the same at the same here that there is in church brother AB brother Ruben the same that's here has to be outside you are so important you are a light in your school why you we have to be lights outside there and it's just very important I didn't prepare this much I'm so sorry but this is like something that always come to my mind there's a message called I can't talk it's your life worthy of the gospel and it's a high one but I love to hear it finally I'm drinking water brother kuin and um our lives by the grace of God has to be worthy of the gospel and it's not going to be easy all the time because you have to give up heaps of things that they are not good good for you anyways but that's what the Lord wants from you that your life can be worthy of this cuz when you are outside and there is some people that they know that you're Christian yeah and you're not conducting like a Christian L you are giving to the gospel a bad name everyone knows how a Christian is supposed to be but no one's want to be a Christian because it's hard and some people like for some people it's just so easy to say is that guy know a Christian why he's doing that thing help us Lord to please leave a life life just worthy of this let's just have the musicians sorry just didn't prepare this much but this is what the Lord put in my heart amallah I hope that tonight we can pray and ask the Lord for some help amen because we need him amen amen let's brother Ben you come here and give me a handy [Applause] amen amen I don't want to be a jellyfish I want to be I want to have a backbone amen I don't want to just be a cult church member that's a jellyfish amen I think it's Lord take us higher we need him amen we're not here to play around the devil's not here to play around amen so let's serve the Lord with all that we are amen you know wouldn't you want let's just let's just go to Hebrews liveing let's just can you put that back up now I pray that when you read you say well this might not be my portion but we're called to overcome now that we can stand there on that day with these these Brethren and say you overcame by the grace of God I overcame amen you had a backbone God gave me the same kind of backbone amen you can stare them in the face and say I stood cuz he's worthy to stand for and to and to be a living representative of and be an ambassador that our King is real he's the same yesterday today and forever and and he's worth living for he's worth dying for amen all the apostles gladly gave their lives that's right they couldn't deny him because they were part of him amen how can you deny what's part of you amen so praise the Lord grit Hallelujah you say I don't know if I have it you say well then ask God God give me that grit amen that though none go with me still I'll follow amen thank you I didn't have that grit I was this guy but then one day one day you're going to have to want it what do you want what do you really want what do you want God wants to give it to you but what do you do you really want it are you really are you really willing to sell all sell out yes cuz he's only looking for sellouts he's not looking for part-time he's not looking for flirters not looking for lip service he's looking for those who really give their all it's worth it I wish I wish we could have a general resurrection of all the Believers that'll stand and say it was worth it was it worth it to be destitute tormented in caves and all these things i' say yes would you do it again absolutely amen amen what about us we're not going to get through throw on a flowery bed of East just because they had a hard time we're called to overcome what are you going to overcome the curses of soft living of riches of Lady OA of lukewarmness of conforming and floating and and this you got to overcome God's here to give us the grace that we can overcome am amen so I pray let's be like this girl she could kept her mouth shut she could have said he deserves it look what he did to me I don't deserve this it's his fault I'm here but he said I would to God there's a man there's a prophet in Samaria that can he could recover him of his leprosy we know a man we know a man he's not in Samaria only he's all around the world his name is Jesus Christ we know a man that's right amen he she knew of the man I trust you know the Lord Jesus that you can say to someone if only you knew my Jesus my Jesus can take care of you cuz he took care of me my Jesus change me he can change you amen praise the Lord amen we're going to have a we're going have a time of prayer tonight but what do you want seriously what do you want he willing to give all I'm just opening the prayer request sorry that's why I've gone silent here amen so we
