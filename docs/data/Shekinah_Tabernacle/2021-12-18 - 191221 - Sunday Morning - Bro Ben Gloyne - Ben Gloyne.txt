got a new name you have a new name you're called the bride isn't it wonderful that is your new name jokes aside your name has been changed there is a revelation in the impact of the changing of the name the key lies in the changing of the name you see when your name changes you start to overlook your brother's weaknesses stubbornness isn't it when your name changes you you you look at things differently because your name is changed now that is why paul who was a matter who was a persecutor the lord looked beyond him and when he looked beyond him he changed his name you who okay let me say me who was a harlot you know west probably than who's that lady in jericho rahab western hair or the woman at the well when when when the lord looks beyond you he changes your name so this morning

amplify our voices if you can't we'll give you a mic to support the signal isn't it the song says the lord changes your name we know it we sang it at yesterday's outreach he says sorry i'm very

um let's just go to the scripture we're going to go to john 14 1. and just as you're turning um yeah so we're going to have service on boxing day brother isaac has kindly uh accepted the uh to you know to preach we're going to be away so um and then the wednesday services are going to continue on as normal we've got brother paul this wednesday we're looking forward to it very much and we're going to have a watch night service here on new year's eve um i'll send out the details of time and but if you've got a testimonial song you want to share then just you know get that ready to be real nice um yeah god bless you all if i don't see you before christmas i trust you have a very blessed merry christmas you know brother ram said that he you wish that it was like christmas every day everyone's rejoicing happy you know kind you know and we know our lord wasn't born on the 25th of december but you know god bless you have a merry christmas everyone uh we're going to go to john 14 and 1 and then we're going to first thessalonians 4 and 13. so right here john 14 1 uh verses 1 to 3 three says uh let not your heart be troubled you believe in god live also in me and my father's house are many mansions if we're not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also i pray that scripture means more to you every day the reality of it will just anchor into your soul we go to first thessalonians 4 and 13. and we're going to read down through down to uh chapter 5 and verse 9 so a bit of a lengthy reading but i just used bear with me here he says but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the year so and and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words now we know that the chapter and verse was put in after this was written you know paul didn't put chapter and verse and so chapter five is a continuation of chapter four okay so he says but of the times and seasons brethren ye have no need that i write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them so as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but ye brethren are not in darkness hey he's talking about you and i right there that that they should overtake you as a thief so that should take all fear away right ye are all children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation for god hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ i love that don't you amen if you've got a need in your life you want to be remembered and pray and raise your hand to the lord amen let's just bow our heads as we've just read his word let's talk to the author of the book oh lord jesus how thankful we are living you loved us dying you saved us spirit you carried our sins far away rising you justified us freely forever one day you're coming o glorious day lord how fitting that song is in this season lord we're looking for that moment lord i believe we're living in that season i pray dear god as we have opened your word we've read your scriptures lord we need you the great author to come and live lord manifest your word in our lives we don't just come to we don't want to lecture something to tickle our brains law but we want you to take your word by your holy ghost anchor it into our souls that it would express you to this world grant it father we love you so much lord you see every hand that's been raised dear god you know the burdens the needs the questions behind every hand i have my hand raised up myself lord and i want to thank you before we ever stepped into a trial had a problem lord anything whatever we're facing right now lord you already provided a perfect lamb for us oh god lord you already gave yourself lord as a living sacrifice we love you so much just want to give our lives unto you this moment lord have your way lord i pray you would awaken us lord to the reality of where we are in time we thank you so much lord we pray for those as well who couldn't be here today lord be their portion be their strength lord may you watch over them lord and just just draw them ever closer to you as well and lord anyone second body lord asking your hand would touch them and heal them because we know by your stripes they were healed it's a finished work they are healed but we thank you for it lord in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning we were um uh on on tuesday uh evening uh for our family ultra family prayer time we just put on brother freddie's service there and um and he he mentioned the uh armor company story now i'm just going to go through this and um where where he said that the you know the story of the armor company is you know it's like a cinderella story you know dwight moody was the first one to to to speak it but brother brown really really made it live because it speaks to the hour in which we live and um and so in the armor company story there was a there was a girl that lost her parents she had to go live on a ranch with her cousins and she was you know you know with her uncle and auntie and she was mistreated she had to do all the work she had to you know she was basically a slave for them and that was her portion in life and it was a big ranch and and the owner of the ranch the son of the owner of the ranch was a very wealthy man and he came from chicago came to this ranch to inspect the whole place and he would you know be looking around and and so the cousins of this girl who was basically their slave decided that one of us is going to marry this man we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna you know we're gonna we're gonna get a snag i'm gonna grab him we're gonna flutter our eyes and he's gonna fall and it's gonna the rest is history and uh but but this man he was a young man who was eligible aged to be married but you know everything they tried to do to impress him just just it was like water on a duck's back i mean off a duck's back because he was looking for character and you know they would put on parties they'd put on you know barn dances all these different kind of things to try and impress him but you know that wasn't what he was looking for and now this the story represents us and the lord jesus christ yo but but he was looking as he was there on his father's business inspecting the ranch and things that wasn't really the thing on his heart he was looking for a wife he was looking for a part of himself he was looking for a woman that expressed his heart and so he one night you know he you know you know he noticed this cousin in the background always working doing different things and you know one night you know he yo he he he somehow escaped the dance and he went out you know out the back and she was there cleaning up after the meal and she was tipping the dishwater over the sink and i mean i mean i mean over the fence and you know he he began to introduce uh uh himself to her and and he said you know i'm out here and i'm looking at my father's you know ranch and all these things i'm really looking for a wife and he he basically he said you know i've noticed you around i noticed you're a real woman i'm not looking for this dressed up fandangle things i'm looking for a character and you know she was so embarrassed you know remember the first time the lord ever came near you you know you felt about yay big and my fingers are touching together you know you felt this big you felt so unworthy but he was looking beyond how you thought about you he was looking at that predecessor on the inside of you amen and he saw part of himself in you that's deeper than your character then your facial expressions and your whatever you are deeper than that he was you know he saw that part of himself and and he said to her will you marry me and she was so shocked by the proposal but yet of course she said yes and he would tell he would tell her in a year in a year's time from this day i will come and we'll get married on these grounds and i'll take you back to chicago i've got a big castle there you won't have to worry about washing dishes nothing you're just going to be my queen so as as brother freddie was was was mentioning this it came to the it it anchored down to my heart in a year's time from this day means the same season that they're in will come back again now we're living in a tremendous hour this is the greatest time to be alive i pray with all of my heart that you are not asleep in this day yet you are not just floating about in life as the apostle paul would say let us not sleep as either of the night right let us not be asleep but let us be awakened i mean to the season that we're alive and now she can you imagine the day before even on that very morning she got out of her bed maybe she was very upset with her a lot in life but she decided i've just got to persevere and maybe she had no idea how she was going to escape this kind of a life she had no idea what her future would be she thought i'm just stuck here and i've got to put up with my cousins and do just just do the best i could but that evening changed amen a few words from him and a proposal changed her whole life and you remember when the lord you know you know he came and he and he proposed to you and he put his love kiss on your heart took all your sin away and he gave you the promise i'm coming back for you i mean it's not someone else's promise it's your promise i mean it's not that someone else is excited as you're excited by it hallelujah and the very next morning she woke up in the same bed facing the same chores facing the same life facing the same critical cousins and problems and whatever same dishes same choice same laundry same sweeping same whatever she had to do ex but in her heart was burning a flame now she had purpose now she had vision now she had focus i mean now she had a burden now she had love in her heart i mean now she had a longing and she was looking for when the season would return back around because when the season came back around now she would recognize it's been a year's time and he's coming back for me hallelujah so you know same problems same you know the cousins would have said the same things to her same condescending looks you know we all actually need critics you know every prophet in the bible had a critic jesus had a lot of critics the apostle paul had critics i mean his critics followed him i mean from city to city hallelujah and that's how we have you know that's a good sign you're on the lord's side if you've got critics amen if if they persecute you for the word sake i mean i'd say you should actually praise praise the lord hallelujah it's good to have critics that's not easy but it's good i mean so she would suffer the same verbal abuse day after day amen yo but but as she was watching the seasons change he realized it's getting closer but there's a repeat of the season so for example if i stood here in a year's time we would probably be talking about how much rain we've just had because it rains a lot in december you know christmas i don't know why it goes on the news but people talk is it going to rain this christmas odds are it is because in a lot of places it rains it's new zealand it's well summer well i don't think it gets the memo eventually it does but it goes autumn but anyway but but in a year's time the season will be the same we won't be in winter right so the same conditions will be here as this will be the same season again now we have to look at the first oh well first i've got to lay these things out jesus when he was here on earth he spoke more of his second coming than his first and brother bam says what a tremendous time that we're in for he would he would be asked by his disciples when is going to be the destruction of the temple this is matthew 24 i'm just i'm just kind of paraphrasing here um quickly but i just want to lay this kind of foundation because people say oh we shouldn't look for signs but jesus said we'll be given signs there's a season there's a season of a change and and so jesus would be asking matthew 24 when is going to be the destruction of the temple in jerusalem the sign of thy coming and the end of the world and he answers that matthew 24 and 25. and he would come down and to and you know we realized just finally reading that chapter he says you'll see pestilence we have pestilence that's epidemics right we're living in one amen there'll be wars there'll be famines there'll be earthquakes you know and there are earthquakes even right now under the kapiti coast there's a slow earthquake going on and it's going to go on for months apparently you know well we're on the shaky isles if you came for a place of stability physically you're in the wrong country right but if you want if you want stability spiritually you've come to the right place i mean the word of the lord hallelujah amen so hey so we've had earthquakes we've got pestilence we've had all those things wars and rumors you know i find it quite amazing when when i think the defeats minister of taiwan is is saying china won't invade us till 2025. this is world news this is what they're expecting because the world has to come to armageddon the world has to come to a great tribulation it's prophesied i mean we could have the best politicians that are actually honest in every country in every world you know you know every place it won't help it the world is predestined to fall apart it's ordained to fall apart that's why there's strife and trouble and but you've got to be careful what you rally around and and we'll get into that soon but then jesus would say now learn the parable of the fig tree when its branches is yet tender and putteth forth leaves you know that summer is nigh now we know in the scripture that the figs or the fig tree represents israel so it says when you see israel become a nation again you know summer is now what's going to happen another season is coming right so likewise ye when you shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass so all these things be fulfilled heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away but of that day and hour no man knoweth no not the angels of heaven but my father only but then he begins to go into parables he reaches back into the scripture and he identifies the conditions in certain ages and says when you see these conditions here again you know this is what's going to happen now the first evidence is when you see israel become a nation again and they have become a nation for the first time in over two thousand years they are a sovereign nation in 1946 or 48 whichever one that you know that's a very important landmark in the calendar it's a very important landmark in the calendar right so god is saying now that when you see this you know the summer is nigh the millennium is going to grow along but before that there has to be a rapture of a bride now we're going to just just just just i just trust you just stay with me goodness okay but of the days of but as the days of noah were so shall the coming of the son of man be and for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating they were drinking they are marrying and given a marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and then you not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be so life will just go on there's not going to be a great awakening of a whole world saying jesus is coming no he'll come like a thief in the night and a good thief doesn't leave any evidence they go and they get what they want they get out oh lord if i can put it this way he's a very good thief he he doesn't bumble around he does it very you know he has a plan he manifests his plan so he comes in reveals himself to you gets you ready get and get you out at the appointed time so if we want to look at when the season comes back around again we need to look at what it was if i could say if i could put it this way what was summer like a year ago right so what was the time like when the lord jesus was here the first time remember because there's been a promise for 2000 years down through the ages and we need to look because remember it's not just asking going to be raptured the believers down through seven church ages are going to come forth amen so we need to see what was the summer the summer like the first time and then we'll see are we living in that same time again hallelujah amen so if we look at when the lord was here the first time we need to see that you know um i have it here yes so the lord was born in a manger we understand that now we know that in this season he will not be physically born that way because he does not need to come back and purchase the salvation of the world right but he'll be born in a bride right veiled behind human flesh once again now our lord jesus after he was born he was baptized by john who was the forerunner right and when he was baptized the fullness of the spirit of god came and dwelt in him for it says in colossians two and nine freedom dwelleth all the fullness of the god here bodily so he's not just part of the godhead all the god he was in him all that god is was poured into christ amen it says in luke 4 1 the first part of that verse after he was baptized and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from jordan and then the spirit led him into the wilderness so now then jesus enters into his ministry so i'm just giving you conditions of last year spiritually and look at the repeat right because when you see in a year's time see to me when brother brown lays out stories he's actually telling parables he's not just giving things oh that's a nice idea a nice story no he's actually laying just like jesus would preach parable form and there's deep truth in them i mean i pray by the power of god that we would see where we are because can you imagine she's been suffering nearly a year of abuse by her cousins in her heart i'm going to get married and she gets the wedding garment she gets the wedding dress and she puts it on and it fits just right maybe maybe every solvent should get out of the cupboard put it on put now we know the wedding garment is the baptism of the holy ghost and we don't put it on and put it off we just but i'm just using this as an illustration so imagine how excited she would be just imagine he came and spoke to her in summertime where she sees spring there's the cold winter months you know there's the dark ages it was a cold time a lot of winter formality and dead just just flowing into the church but then but then a spring time began to come a reformation began to come and she'd look out and see the buds coming on all the trees and you know that would make her excited because to me winter's a long time i'm not a fan i know we need it but i look forward to winners done you know and then summer to me is too short you know but you know it's yeah it's here and it's gone but winter's like it's here and are we done yet you know kind of counting down days and you know so maybe she was like that and then and then she saw the buds come on the trees they would have put a renewed spring in her step hallelujah i mean the long winter's over the spring is care not just coming it's here i mean that's mean summer's gonna roll on real soon hallelujah so it would have made her real excited hallelujah these things should make us excited too amen so jesus enters into his ministry and then he goes into you know after the temptation in the wilderness by the devil he goes into the synagogue there and there in nazareth where he was brought up and as his custom was he went to church and um he went to the synagogue and and he stood up to read and and the book of isaiah was given to him and he looked in there and he found the portion of scripture where it said the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and the recovering of the sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fasted on him and he began to sound to them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ass hallelujah so and then and then what happened after that what he read saying this is the fulfillment of prophecy then it began to be manifested in front of them amen demons were cast out healing took place the dead were raised amen the mysteries of the kingdom were made known amen the hypocrisy of the religious systems was exposed amen nature came under its rightful master when he spoke to the winds and waves hallelujah so was we know he was not just part of the godhead that was god manifested in the flesh as the apostle paul would say and without controversy great is a mystery of godliness god was manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit scene of angels preached unto the gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory halluci is a great powerful manifestation of the spirit of god i mean where people who were lost in sin came and found salvation people were stuck in their old lives they couldn't get out like the woman at the well she got out and the only way she got out of that rut is because she met the son of man amen and he revealed to her the secrets of her hearts because when when when they were talking jesus would say to her you know go get your husband and but then but then she said i don't have one and he said to her you've said right you've had five and the one you're with is not yours i mean i mean you're not even married and then so she was so shocked she said we know where messiah cometh he'll do these things so what was he doing he's doing the sign of the messiah revealing what was in them in many places in the gospels it would say and jesus knew their thoughts hallelujah and then and then she she was just told by him he that speaks to the am he and then she dropped her water pot ran into the city said come see a man that told me everything ever done is this not the very messiah hallelujah amen but then also in that season there was there was there was a time of great rejection not just by the pharisees sadducees and the and the scribes but it was also by people who walked with him the 70 followed him no more when you begin to say unless you eat my flesh and drink drink my blood you don't have you have no part of me he didn't explain it he didn't have an apologetics ministry nothing wrong with those things but you know he just he just laid it out there and they said this is a hard saying who can hear it and you know they just went on you know and and and he was also not only that but he was betrayed by judas the traitor who was one of the one of the ministering brothers who was with him one of the disciples and they would eventually and in the pressure of the churches of that day were they they told the people if you attend his revival you're not welcome in the synagogue no more and they'll be kicked out eventually he was betrayed by judas as i said and then crucif and then then they crucified the very lord of glory the very messiah that they were supposedly looking for but this did not stop him this actually gave the greatest triumph that had ever happened how they were jesus when he was crucified he didn't stay dead i mean his body may have been lifeless but he was down in hell conquering i mean he went and preached to the souls in prison amen because remember he just purchased the whole world he had purchased our salvation he took the nails from me hallelujah and so when when his body was put into the tomb he went down and preached his souls in prison saying the one that noah said was coming i'm here holy he began to preach him then he went and he went into paradise he didn't begin to speak to abraham isaac and jacob and you know you know joseph and you know all the prophets down through the ages and then they began to just have a jubilee because they were looking for him to come and then now he was right there hallelujah and he emptied out paradise hallelujah led them and they ascended on high and then also he went down to hell now i may have got the order of those things around the wrong way but you know the story don't you he went down to hell amen and then satan said finally i've got you now i thought i had you when i had abel thought i had you when i had moses different ones thought i had you when i had john the baptist head chopped off but now i've got you then just jesus said satan my blood is on the cross still fresh i have redeemed adam's fallen race i mean you have no power no more give me the keys of hell death and the grave holy grand office side boot him back down to hell ascended triumphant hallelujah so in this time of great rejection and crucifixion there was a resurrection taking place so it was the greatest and and his resurrection sealed his messiahship because there had been many great prophets on the earth but none had resurrected i mean none had ever ever said the words i lay my life down and i'll pick it back up again holy so he didn't just say what he was he proved what he was so there was a great resurrection time now that was the first season that was a year ago what about in a year's time because the same god said he'd do the same things in the end time to reveal himself to a bride around the world that she would know this is the time of translation this is the time of the rapture i mean so what have we had we've had a forerunner come we've had john the yeah you're having a prophet with the spirit of elijah upon him i meant to forerun jesus christ i mean to introduce the people to the word not to a church do you know the worst my i don't want anyone to be introduced to your kind of tabernacle oh the i come to this church forget that that's not going to take change you that that your body goes from here to heaven amen don't be associated with the church be associated with jesus christ if you know him you can go anywhere and you still you'll be fine righteous not oh i'm trusting in the church you'll see me through no i'm sorry this church won't see you through i mean he will see you through i mean he'll stick he'll stick closer to you than a brother than your friend than your mother than your father i mean you become one with the word don't fall in love with me there's only one woman allowed to do that and we're married hallelujah you know don't fall in love with my personality who i don't forget that you know i heard ron spencer say it once and i agree he said i wish i just a curtain was pulled around me and and my voice was changed when i preached i thought how true that should be amen but yeah so we're going to become one with the lord amen amen and so now so we've had a forerunner come and then and then church history says when his ministry went worldwide pentecost was at a low ebb and and historians who don't even agree with what he thought said william brown's ministry initiated the post-world war ii healing revival and you go look at that time of history it just exploded the supernatural exploded upon the earth like never before why because god sent elijah to turn the hearts of the people back to the apostolic faith i mean so what happened the dead were raised you know christine and i were standing brother ernie there in um um in in cape town we were we were there 2019 we were standing outside this hall in south africa so so i mean i mean in cape town which is in south africa so so there's the town hall there and then next to it is it's i think it's now a library but it was called the drill hall and then behind you on the other side of the street is just a big open field and then not far from that is the um castle of good hope or whatever it's called there and so we were standing there and so we're standing with the pastor the church here brother dale and and brother ernie and um and his you know and their wives and and and he began to tell the story about how they were having a house meeting uh a few years back and there was this old lady sitting in this house meeting half asleep and and brother dale is is introducing the prophet to the people and she perked up and said i know who william branham is and and he thought you know this is just she's just an old lady what does she know and she said yeah when i was a teenager i was standing in his meeting here in cape town when i was a teenager and and she began to describe the scene you can read it in the book you can see the photos of it say we couldn't get into the hall where he was preaching we're on the outside and there were thousands of us there and and and she said you know those people you know we gathered real early and there are other people preaching but then all we heard brother brown say was good evening friends and as soon as he said that she said pandemonium broke out because the spirit of god fell upon everyone and people just got out of their wheelchairs dropped their crutches got out of their cots it's just a spontaneous mass healing amen came there and we know durbin racecourse was even greater than that and that wasn't just one isolated thing that was all around the world wherever he went because what what happened demons were cast out i mean healing took place the dead were raised nature amen had to obey his voice creation happened the mysteries of the kingdom were revealed hallelujah the supernatural took place on such a great magnitude for the for god to get our attention bible days are here again that's what people say bible days are here again holy what's happening the season had come back around again now but i just want to say this the season has not ended amen because remember there's been rejection amen there's been crucifixion i turned 33 and someone said good now we can crucify him and we all know what happened there but you see the word has to be crucified the word had to be because remember moses when moses was commanded to speak to the rock i think i have it here he gets he gets angry at god i know so he gets angry at the he says you bunch of rebels it's an it's a numbers chapter 20 i believe if i can find it maybe i can't find it that's why i've but he says you bunch of rebels do i really have to let's find it here numbers 20. and we will read from verse 9 but but let's just go actually we need to so verse 7 and the lord spake unto moses saying take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and aaron my brother and speak ye unto the rock before your eyes pardon me and it shall give forth as water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so thou shalt give the congregation and their beast drink now let's just drop down to oh let's just keep reading and moses took the rod from before the lord as he as he commanded him and moses and aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock and he said unto them here now ye rebels must we fetch ye water out of this rock and moses lifted up his hand and with his rod he smoked the rock he smote the rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their beasts also and the lord said unto moses and aaron because you believe me not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of israel therefore you shall not bring this congregation into the land which i have given them so the whole pattern of the scripture was broken there because gee well up to this point anyway because jesus was the rock was christ we know and he was only meant to be smitten once on calvary right but i was actually speaking of there'll be two crucifixions because the rock will be smitten twice and that's that was when jesus was physically crucified but now he's not here in that physical form so how do you crucify the lord now you kill his effects of him of his word upon the people that's how you crucify him you count that him being an unclean spirit it's the devil working have nothing to do with it just like in the first first one don't go hear his meetings he's beelzebub have nothing to do with this then they physically crucified him right but you can't kill him physically because he's his body's not here right but you can kill the effects of his spirit upon the people which is exactly what's happened again in this end time but i want you to know that that was actually the greatest thing that could happen do you think that's a terrible thing but it's actually a great thing because it brought about a resurrection are you following me amen it brought about a resurrection now we're living in a season where i said we have come back a year right so the same thing has happened again there's been a crucifixion right but then now there is a great resurrection but let's just go back to this actually because jesus even said to the jesus even said to the scribes and pharisees when they asked them in in matthew 16 or matthew 12 to matthew 16 the pharisees also with the sadducees came and tempting and tempting desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven and he answered and said unto them when it's evening you say it will be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning it will be foul weather today for the sky is red and lowering o hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky but you cannot discern the sign of the times a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign there shall be no sign given unto them but the sign of the prophet jonas and he left and he departed now he would he would actually explain this earlier in matthew 12 he says then certain of the scribes and pharisees answering saying master we would see a sign from thee but he answered and said unto them and an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall be no sign given to it but the sign of the prophet jonas for as jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth so what is that sign a resurrection sign amen because it because that's what i am tim now this resurrection sign would be repeated in the end time where the resurrected christ would step out of history and manifest himself in the same way he did but the only difference is he's not here in his physical body we're looking for the physical coming of the lord right we're physically going to meet him in the air that's what believers believe right yes i i trust you're looking for that day i'm not expecting to stay here in this fashion i'm expecting to go to a wedding supper up in glory for three and a half years that's what i'm expecting i am sure that's what believers believe hey because we we we do believe the bible around here now now brother brown would say now what kind of a sign would this wicked adulthood generation get the sign of the resurrection amen that's what we find now christ alive among us the sign of the resurrection amen the christ of galilee doing the same things the same works with his people living amongst the mortals performing the sign of a living god among them that wicked and adulterous generation we're living in has has got the sign of jonas the resurrection the resurrection power that can lift the sinner from the life of sin to take the sinful woman unbelieving ungodly demon possess make believers out of them take men as low and stoop their morals make gentlemen out of out of them amen well my page numbers are all funny where are we page four amen that is he says take the gentleman out of them amen he would see see brother branham we know he's not god we're not caught up in his personality but he's a fulfillment of prophecy right so so jesus god revealed himself in his son but then he would take a redeemed son at the same time right a sinner saved by grace and he would show the people this is the power of the blood this is what my this is what the power of the cross can produce where god can come and dwell in a person take over their life and completely don't you want that no longer either liveth but christ that liveth in me amen he would he would um this is thousands of times through his ministry but this is from this day the scripture is fulfilled and i just want to read this because it's tremendous now he says now to preach it that i said a while ago if you preach anything in its gospel truth and god is obligated to vindicate that is that true now if that be so let the god that wrote the word let the god that made the prophecy let the god who is god of the word come forth and prove that he is still god that's quite a challenge as elijah went up on the mountain watching elisha went watching elijah he said i want a double portion and the mantle that is on elijah fell upon elisha he walked down he doubled that blanket up and he struck the river and said where is the god of elijah and the same thing that happened for elijah happened for elisha and the same gospel the same power the same son of man that was yesterday is today and will be forever hebrews 38 do you believe it then i ask you i cannot be him but he is here we are only a carrier some of you people out there that sick and afflicted that you know that i don't know you now let god if i can humble myself enough you pray and ask god he says i don't guess there's a prayer card in the building no we never get any prayer cards we're going to have a prayer meeting or healing of the sick at the church but you pray and you know that i'm a total stranger to you see you know me jeffersonville i don't want people from jeffersonville to do that that's where he was preaching i want people from away from here somewhere see if god still reveals see if he's still the same yesterday today and forever do like the little woman did he pass through and she said i believe this man she had a blood issue and she said if i can touch the border of his garment i believe him i'll be made whole is that right because of her faith that day the scripture was fulfilled he bind up the heart heart of the brokenhearted healed the sick and the lame when she touched his garment and walked out and sat down he turned around and said who touched me how'd he ever know in that great throng of people probably 30 times that's here tonight thousands of them how did he know he said who touched me he didn't say that just to be saying he said that because it was true he said who touched me and directly he looked around and seen the little woman where she was sitting or standing whatever position she was in told her her blood issue was over that was jesus today that's him today you believe that he says i don't know you god does but you got pains in your sight so now he's talking to someone it's bothering you that's right you're sitting there praying about it am i a stranger to you and you're and where strangers want to another stand up if that's it i don't know you it's it's this man right here in the corner this young fellow you've also got a bad throat that's right you're praying about that you're all nervous about something you're going to have to leave the meeting because you're a minister you've got some engagements you've got to take care of that's right aha you believe god knows who you are reverend mr smith now you can go and be healed jesus christ made you whole go on to your meeting your throat won't bother you he asked a question who did he touch there is a man sitting right back here he's suffering he's got a tumor on his left lung he isn't from here he has been you have been a mind worker that is right i'm a total stranger to you if that's right shake your hand the tumor is in your left lung and you're up for an operation right away is that right you're not from here you're from out of town you're from virginia that's right you believe god knows who you are mr mitchell that's right go home be made well jesus christ makes you whole ass a man i never seen him in my life he was sitting there praying now you can go see that man's interview he's interviewed about that he said i've never been to any of william barron's meetings before i'd never known the guy but my pastor knew about him he took me along because he he was a mind worker he had a he said he had a tumor in his left lung the size of a fist and he was up for an operation right away and he was right down the back of the church and and brother brown called him out but that's the same thing as jesus speaking to the woman at the well and he says you have been a mind worker because he never went back to being a mind worker after this meeting he went to be a pastor of a church and that tumor left him so what is that that's the sign of the messiah right that's jesus being revealed through a redeemed son that so so the first season has now repeated now in the second season hallelujah but as i said now there's also a resurrection to take place amen now when i talk about a resurrection i'm not just talking about the dead in christ raising our bodies being changed because our soul we've we've got to be changed from being dead and trespassed and sins to be alive in christ we need to be resurrected that way first before a physical resurrection can take place amen so we've had in the first season we had we had the lord revealing himself supernatural power of god manifested the mysteries be revealed amen a crucifixion a rejection but then a resurrection right and then and then in this season again because the season had to come back around again and we've had the lord reveal himself in power signs and wonders miracles done the same same same discernment right the same revealing the secrets of the tents of of the heart right we've had a rejection of crucifixion but now we've got a resurrection amen because that resurrection isn't just talking about that's talking about you amen because as jesus was in the tomb and the angel lord came down and and rolled the stone away and he came out resurrected i mean so we were once in a tomb amen it could have been a tomb of religion it could have been just a tomb of unbelief could be a tomb of the world culture whatever it is the devil wants us to be in a tomb raider we don't belong in a graveyard in a spiritual graveyard no we're made for life we're made for eternal life we're not made to be dead in the world and trespass and sins we're built to be alive amen so as the as the as the lord was was was brought out of the tomb now i'm talking about this resurrection because we're alive in christ who's alive in christ oh so the season has come back around again amen so now we were once dead and it could be a tomb of denomination it could just be unbelief could be the world whatever whatever you could just name place it there whatever you were once in you could be gaming like me or movies music drinking alcohol parties whatever whatever it is or just being a good person just just trying to be a good religious person that's a tomb right but that was prophesied that a resurrection would take place where a people who were once dead would become alive hallelujah a resurrection would take place no sorry brother i would say in the rising of the sun he says a waving of the sheaf now we don't have time to go into this what was the sheath the first one that come to mature the first one proved it was a sheath that proved it was a sheath hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm talking about that's the life of christ on display it waved over the people the first time there will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word is turned back in its full power and waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there he says because i live ye live also speaking to his wife because i live ye live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is i mean to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in christ jesus by god's quickening power hallelujah that's what we are i was once dead now i'm alive i was once dead in the world just floating along with the tide but in the lord look beyond me look beyond my fault and saw my need and found me hallelujah and made me alive in him amen amen so now if the season is because remember everything that god did in the prophet's ministry he's still the same god today hallelujah he's still the same god today you know i've had like brother armand would say to me quite regularly have you bugged my house what we talk about you preach about and it's so it's so common in the sunday school i think it's become common we don't have meetings like you know we don't sit down and say now i'm going to preach on this can you teach on this and the we don't we don't have a plan i don't have a plan quite often even saturday what are you going to preach on tomorrow i don't know you know but god knows amen right so it's the same god revealing secrets of the thoughts of the heart maybe in a different way but it's the same god living here hell it's the same mind of christ revealing himself this is not a hit-and-miss thing sometimes i think it's hit and miss because i'm just i feel like i'm dumb but you know but god knows what he's doing he's in our midst and i trust it gets our attention where we can be driving along and asking a question then the answer comes out right here you are asking that question here's the answer you know or talking about something you know last night or whatever it is you know it's like brother amanda you had that big you know clash with his dad a few years ago when he was here and he prayed said lord i need a conference then the next morning i need a conference with you you still answer you know and then the next morning i get up and i preach it and and and you can ask him he'll tell the testimony a lot better than me the the order in which they discuss things was the order in which i preached on it and it happened over and over again and his his his father the night before they were going back to south africa got baptized because a little girl who was about two years old i mean picked up a mask and before that when i was reading romans 6 and talking about baptism because because his wife so ahman's mum was getting baptized i was reading from romans 6 and lilia got up 2 years old stood in front of me pointed up at the bible and looked at him then then walked along picked up a little zorro mask and gave it to him and he was a man who was so frustrated saying i just want that phone that i can talk to god on people say god talks to them god never talks to me and god used a little two-year-old about that age wasn't she was she about two you know to actually tell him listen to the word take off your religious mask listen to the word and obey it and so he gave his life to the lord got baptized in their bathtub up manor manor drive and he came out of the water a different man hallelujah why what's happening because god is working the same god back there in the sixties or two thousand years ago is the same lord jesus here hallelujah what's it doing to bring forth a resurrection amen we are not dead in in dead in religion we are not dead in some idea of man amen this is not just a a a church this is all around the world there's a group of people that the lord has revealed himself to in his word to show them this is now the season just like the armor company girl you know people can criticize your experience no doubt those cousins would say you're a foolish girl what's a spring in your step you know you know people get happy grumpy people love to bring them down to their level because they would have been real upset because all of them would have said i'm gonna get him tonight you watch she failed the next one you know the next one say well if she won't she won't get him i'm gonna get him she failed now they're both grumpy and then the third one says well third time lucky hey maybe change your tactic a bit i don't know that fails miserably and then that and then so they've all failed then that next morning they don't know a proposal has taken place and they don't know that their cousin that they despise who think there's nothing good in her has said and so the next morning she gets up it's different today hallelujah and maybe she's singing i'm so glad i can say i'm one she's whistling something doing dishes what good morning how are you doing today you know and they've got a face that would you know that would kill her kill an elephant at a hundred yards and says i definitely stare like laser beams there because they're failed now eventually it would come out to them he asked me to marry him and i said yes can you imagine the amount of criticism that just would be blasted upon her that didn't really happen he's just playing with you he's just twisting up your mind that experience wasn't real you say you're a christian you say god really met you and changed your life oh no that no no that was just a mental illusion you just because those people are like that you just kind of no no see but the thing is they can't say it didn't happen because they weren't there when it happened and they didn't have the experience you know no one can say to me that god didn't fill his love with my fill my heart with his love that changed my life took all the world out of me no one can say that that didn't happen because i was there i had the experience hallelujah i'm still enjoying that experience today oh louise so the thing is the criticism didn't change the fact that she was engaged the criticism didn't change the fact she was going to get married i mean but now she had come back to when the season came back around you know what i love about seasons is it has an effect on people a natural season affects people you look at wildlife we'll just take nature we know in new zealand there's the um i think it's the little bird the godwit they one of the biggest migrational uh flights of the world of any kind of bird they come from you know i think they go down to the south island maybe up here some they go up to alaska or something every year they'll make that migration and the thing is it's the change of the season causes them to know it's time to migrate now brother brown would talk about ducks hallelujah he would talk about ducks now he's not just telling the story to tell a little story he's he's wanted to lay something in now these ducks they would they would migrate annually from from down the south louisiana or the gulf of mexico and they'd go up into canada so in the summertime now i'll probably get this mixed up but in the in the winter time they'll be in louisiana then they'll go up in the springtime they'll have their babies up in canada now what i love about this is is that now now a change of season happens the day before they're just on their pond they're doing their thing you know their babies are ready to fly because god's going to get us ready you know the season doesn't change and these babies just hatching out they are fully ready for the flight it's the same thing with you and i you have the baptism of the holy ghost you truly are you're ready for your flight hallelujah you're ready for your flight and so now the first cold wind begins to blow and actually cause them to start swarming they their their behavior changes because the season changes now because because the temperature's going down it's actually activating something within them we've got to fly south and a lot of them are born that's their first year that so so they're born on that pond they've never left that pond before just like us you know we were in the mind of god now we're here but we've never left who's left this world before gone to another dimension no no so we've never left this i know it may be a silly question but we've never left this world before just like those baby ducks you know now they're fully built to fly they've got their feathers everything the first cold wind begins to blow they begin to swarm so their behavior changes because the season changes now as i said a while ago i just mentioned it you've got to be careful what you get stirred up about in the season right because this is the season of the catching away of the bride this is the season of the rapture now there's a lot of there weren't just ducks on that pond there would have been some birds who just would have stayed there they didn't migrate they're not migrationary you know birds that migrate but you know if we could go back into that day no actually let's go here now there's a lot of cold wind blowing there is actually a season change right now in the world there's a season change now if we're on that pond and you know winter begin to start to blow or autumn fall you know we could have a lot of animals there maybe would have complained about the cold wind so they would have got on their blogs made their websites you know made some very deep and you know insightful it's amazing how people make a lot of videos when they're driving in the car and post them about deep things that you know you know they've been thinking about you know you know but that'd be those animals on that pond would be complaining and they'd be blogging they'd be protesting they'd be swarming about the wrong thing right now the duck on the other hand we could have asked them are you upset by this cold weather no why aren't you upset you should look that badge is upset that pelican i don't know what's up there but you know that yo that that other birds there you know you know that beaver that's been on the dam the whole time he's complaining this one's upset why aren't you upset you know you should be very you should be aware of what's going on and they'd say i am aware i am aware what's going on i know it's getting colder but there's something within me that's stirring up there's something within me that's starting to swarm there's something within me that's starting to get excited and it's not the wind isn't dragging me down the wind something's telling me i'm about to leave where are you going i actually not sure but i've heard about a rice paddy down in louisiana that's my future home hallelujah and i'm going to be moving very soon and before you know it the head drake begins about honking on the honking on the pond and you know then it begins to really rally them because a life within them is being expressed i mean hey the badger can complain all the people yo they can complain let the world swarm with what they're going to swarm about you can't stop it you can't give them a reasonable thing and say hold on you know the bible says this is going to happen don't give your whole heart to those things actually it's time to leave the world and the lord has prepared us to leave hallelujah and say they'll start swarming because the life within them hallelujah and the next thing you know i mean they gravitation you know they're flapping their wings the life of them takes them off the ground and they fly away and they don't come back till the next season now we are not going to heaven and then come back here then go into heaven and go back here no this is not the migration i'm talking about i do uh we're gonna we're we're we're leaving this world soon and very soon we're leaving this pond i mean we're actually built to leave and that's why we should be i'd pray something within us swarming the seasons come around again hallelujah the years come around again you know i love about it there would have come a day in that in that girl's life and i'm gonna i'm just gonna close with this there would have been a last time last time does the dishes last time does all that stuff last time here's the nonsense of the cousins last time you didn't realize you know because she could i've told them you weren't there when he proposed you weren't there he turned you down i don't know why he did you know i'm just happy the lord chose me i can't speak for enough but i'm glad so he saw something in this guy that was a value he said i'm taking you home hallelujah so she had to wait her way through the criticism but the thing is anchored in her heart you got to think about this the worst day she could ever have he's still coming for me the worst day it could have been freezing cold winter maybe the sheets froze on the line i don't know but you know they still think praise god he's coming hallelujah this would have been the motivating factor of her life would have given her such purpose he's coming he's coming for me hallelujah and then comes the last day she does the dishes last time sweets the floor last time says the food last time amen puts up with that nonsense last time then she goes in and she puts on the wedding garment and it fits her just right yo what's amazing about the word of god you know surely you know when you first meet him even as we walk with him it can tear strips off our hide the word eh but you kind of find out it just it just fits hallelujah i don't need to lose weight i don't need to put on weight it fits me here it fits me here it fits you know the whole word of god the wedding government fits just right and she puts it on hello because she's not no longer just saying you know she's actually saying no no what he promised he's here right now can you imagine the excitement in her heart it's the same kind of temperature like it was a year ago i mean the fruits on the tree the sun's in the same position in the sky she walks out to the porch the last time why because in a year's time i'll come back for you
