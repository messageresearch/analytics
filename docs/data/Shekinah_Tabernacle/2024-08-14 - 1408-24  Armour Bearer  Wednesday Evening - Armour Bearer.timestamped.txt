[21:37] good all
[21:38] happy 12 out of
[21:42] 10 it's always my confession no matter
[21:45] how I feel sometimes maybe my body tells
[21:48] me and my mental state tells me I'm
[21:50] hovering around about three but my mouth
[21:52] confesses at
[21:53] 12
[21:57] 13 you know we go through ups and downs
[21:59] as a
[22:00] human and I don't know that we can avoid
[22:03] that but I'll be glad one day when we're
[22:04] in a place where this flesh doesn't
[22:05] Hound us anymore where we're where we're
[22:07] always 100 out of 10 amen um okay so
[22:11] this this scripture here is 1st Samuel
[22:14] 146 to7 says and Jonathan said to the
[22:16] young man that bear his armor come and
[22:17] let us go over unto the Garrison of
[22:19] these
[22:20] uncircumcised it may be that the Lord
[22:22] will work for us for there is no
[22:23] Restraint of the Lord to save by many or
[22:26] by few and as armir said unto to him do
[22:29] all that is in thine heart turn thee
[22:31] behold I with thee according to thy
[22:33] heart amen may the Lord bless his word
[22:35] you can take your seats um this
[22:38] evening being a Wednesday night I've got
[22:41] about 25 20 25 minutes so it's just a
[22:45] little short sort of sermonette that
[22:47] I've prepared because we um brother
[22:50] bradam said we can we can uh sing too
[22:52] much we can maybe speak too much but we
[22:54] can't pray too much so we want to make
[22:56] sure we leave time to to um
[22:59] pray
[23:03] um and um sorry give me a
[23:09] second but yeah I've just got a I've got
[23:11] a thought here tonight that I want to
[23:14] speak on and it's a it's a thought
[23:17] called
[23:18] um little thought I had called armor
[23:20] bear I think brother Ben was preaching
[23:22] about um David one time you know and he
[23:25] and he read in the scripture and the
[23:27] this the scripture when Goliath was
[23:29] coming towards David then it said that
[23:32] he had a an armor bear a man that bore
[23:36] his shield and I don't know you just
[23:38] hear that it's sort of what sometimes
[23:39] it's not even to do with what's being
[23:40] preached but a
[23:42] little snippet of inspiration turns up
[23:45] there and you think that's an
[23:45] interesting thing they got a guy there
[23:47] that's walking around and carrying
[23:48] something for another guy and then you
[23:50] know but um I've just got I I um it's a
[23:54] it's a simple thought depending on how
[23:57] simple you want it to be because it can
[23:58] be a very deep thought when you look
[24:00] into it a wee bit more we're not going
[24:02] to be able to go too into a whole lot of
[24:03] stuff cuz we've only got a short amount
[24:04] of time but but it's the concept that of
[24:07] of supporting somebody else or something
[24:09] or some sort of cause is this this
[24:11] concept of being an armor Bearer and and
[24:14] depending on it you can make it quite
[24:15] simple like some of the examples I've
[24:16] got are quite simple and and a like that
[24:19] the young fellas understand the simple
[24:21] concept but then they do get quite deep
[24:24] when you really think about this concept
[24:25] of an armor Bearer and yeah essentially
[24:28] what the Lord could be so I just want to
[24:31] uh just uh kind of run through a a
[24:35] little bit about the uh duties and the
[24:38] sort of characteristics of what
[24:40] typically was an armor Bearer because I
[24:41] don't believe we have them anymore
[24:43] anyone seen like uh a guy with a machine
[24:46] gun and maybe a a guy next to him
[24:47] running with maybe his ammunition maybe
[24:49] in the big machine guns but typically we
[24:51] don't really have what they call armor
[24:52] bearers but they were quite a common it
[24:55] was a common sort of position and uh
[24:58] back in the in biblical times anyway and
[25:00] in other kingdoms had them as well and
[25:02] usually noble people had armor bearers
[25:05] and the the the name almost does them a
[25:09] disservice because they weren't just a
[25:10] nobody that just carried around a little
[25:12] piece of armor they were they were
[25:14] generally a very skilled Warrior that
[25:16] that could protect
[25:17] the the king or whoever it was that they
[25:20] were bearing armor for they I mean these
[25:22] guys had their own armor and they they
[25:24] would in the battle these men would
[25:25] fight with the King and they would
[25:27] protect the king King but they would
[25:28] also fight and so and they were they so
[25:31] they were skilled people they were
[25:32] picked specifically for the job it
[25:33] wasn't just the sort of the dropouts
[25:35] that couldn't make it in the in the Army
[25:38] got the job of being the armor beer
[25:39] because there'd be no good when the
[25:40] king's under pressure and the armor beer
[25:42] doesn't know how to use his sword you
[25:43] know
[25:44] so um but that being said the position
[25:47] of an armor
[25:49] Bearer is always of a lower rank than
[25:51] the one that is served by default
[25:53] because they sort of serve the king
[25:56] orever it is the they bearing armor for
[25:59] I believe joab had 10 of these guys
[26:01] you're almost like bodyguards he had 10
[26:02] armor bearers because he was the one his
[26:05] armor bearers killed um Absalom I think
[26:07] it was joab sort of threw the spears but
[26:11] then because they weren't allowed to
[26:12] kill the Absalom he had his armor beer
[26:14] is going and do his dirty work for him
[26:16] right
[26:18] yeah so he said I didn't kill
[26:21] him that's like politics you know wasn't
[26:25] me you
[26:27] know and the position is given to
[26:29] someone in great trust is as it is the
[26:32] duty of the armor Bearer to and I've
[26:35] just listed out a few things uh first
[26:37] one is to strengthen the position of his
[26:41] officer and the second one is to exalt
[26:43] and uplift his officer you can start to
[26:45] see it's a very much very supportive
[26:48] important role to respect his officer uh
[26:51] to agree with and submit to his officer
[26:55] very submissive role it's like I'm all
[26:56] in to serve you and we live together we
[26:59] fight together we die together yeah
[27:01] these men were
[27:02] serious pretty well if you if the if
[27:05] your main guy died you and you were
[27:07] still alive you had problems so you just
[27:09] sort of did the deed to yourself because
[27:11] you're going to be in trouble anyway
[27:13] later on so that's how dedicated they
[27:16] were to their king or whoever it was
[27:19] they were protecting you you supposed to
[27:21] repel any kind of attack against his
[27:23] officer especially his
[27:25] back there's a there's a certain side of
[27:28] a of a a fighter I think it's the right
[27:30] side that that it's unprotected on that
[27:32] side more than this side so the armor
[27:34] Bearer would always be protecting the
[27:35] side that the the the king fighting
[27:38] couldn't as easily protect he was always
[27:39] on there and repelling any any attacks
[27:42] from that side um rescue his officer
[27:45] from difficulty and hardship in order to
[27:47] prevent shame another one is keep watch
[27:50] while his officer
[27:53] rests uh react with total intolerance to
[27:55] any false accusations against his
[27:57] officer R gossip talking behind his back
[28:00] they had his back all the time more than
[28:02] just a hired servant Aid his officer and
[28:06] spiritual combat and demonstrate extreme
[28:11] loyalty quite a sort of powerful
[28:14] position even though it's a position of
[28:16] servitude you know some some positions
[28:18] of servitude are quite powerful
[28:20] positions although Jesus did say that
[28:22] the greatest among you shall be your
[28:24] servant and he was the he he was the
[28:27] servant of all
[28:29] now this is but I want to just spin it
[28:31] around a we bit maybe the children will
[28:33] find this amusing but you could
[28:35] potentially be an armor Bearer for a
[28:37] loser imagine
[28:40] that you're being an armor Bearer for a
[28:42] loser right so what are you going to end
[28:44] up to be a
[28:47] loser like brother Albero said if you
[28:50] marry an idiot you become Mrs
[28:55] idiot if you team up with a bear arms
[28:59] for a loser you become arm a bear a
[29:03] loser you know and when you think this
[29:06] this is a simple concept but the thing
[29:08] that you support because you because an
[29:10] armor bear essentially supports
[29:11] something if you support something
[29:13] that's a lost
[29:14] cause when that cause goes down so will
[29:16] you yeah see now the a typical example
[29:20] of a armor Bearer that was bearing arms
[29:23] for a loser was the armor Bearer that
[29:24] bore arms for Goliath amen and yet he
[29:27] thought he was such a winner cuz he
[29:28] thought his man was the greatest most
[29:31] strongest fiercest Warrior out there
[29:34] little did he know that he was a loser
[29:37] often times that's the way the world
[29:38] tricks us Satan puts some sort of rock
[29:40] star in front of us to the kids and they
[29:42] make this guy look like such an awesome
[29:44] person but he's a loser cuz he's on
[29:46] Shaky Ground cuz he's not his life isn't
[29:47] built on the word of God he's a loser
[29:49] and you build your life on his example
[29:51] or her example amen you become a loser
[29:53] too and you Bu you're building on Shaky
[29:55] Ground the Bible says and the Philistine
[29:57] came came near and Drew near unto David
[30:00] and the man that bear his shield went
[30:02] with him his armor Bearer and when the
[30:04] Philistine looked about and saw David he
[30:06] disdained him for he was but a youth and
[30:07] Ruddy and of a fair countenance and the
[30:09] Philistines said unto David am I a dog
[30:11] that th comest to me with staves and the
[30:14] Philistine cursed David by his gods and
[30:16] the Philistines said to David come to me
[30:18] and I'll give Thee I will give thy flesh
[30:20] unto the fouls of the air and to the
[30:22] beasts of the field now I want you to
[30:24] look at something look at the armor beer
[30:26] and all these pictures because as the
[30:28] Goliath is is speaking out all these
[30:30] gloating about how Great and Mighty he
[30:33] is and how he's going to defeat this
[30:34] little David guy the armor Bearer is
[30:36] going along with it thinking yeah that's
[30:38] us you know cuz he's in the same spirit
[30:40] cuz he's supporting the same thing so
[30:42] you you can just see it on his face I
[30:44] quite like this I don't know if you can
[30:45] see that face but he's like he looks
[30:47] pretty smug like this one here come to
[30:50] me I'll give thy flesh unto the fouls of
[30:52] the air to the Beast of the field and
[30:53] the little armor beer is emulating it
[30:55] yeah come on you know because he feels
[30:58] like he's on the winning
[30:59] team or this one you know he just he
[31:02] just looks smug doesn't he you
[31:06] know but you
[31:08] know the ways of God are far above our
[31:11] way sometimes what looks powerful to man
[31:13] is just foolishness to God and that's
[31:15] how Satan works is to try and trick us
[31:17] to think something's great and God's
[31:19] often in the little things the things
[31:20] that don't look like they're going to
[31:21] achieve much seems to be where God seems
[31:24] to hide himself like he HIIT himself in
[31:25] Mary and and in this case he HIIT
[31:27] himself for little David you know this
[31:29] Ruddy little guy that just gets made fun
[31:30] of but I'd rather be an armor Bearer for
[31:32] David carrier Stones I me to carry your
[31:34] Stones because his Stone was going to
[31:36] defeat that enemy he was the winner
[31:39] brother bam says but the strange thing
[31:41] that God brought his son to the Earth
[31:43] through this little virgin talking about
[31:44] Mary she had been riding all day on the
[31:46] back of a donkey and there was no room
[31:48] for her at the hotel and God so chose it
[31:50] that his only begotten son was born in a
[31:52] stable in a Manger how simple God does
[31:54] things that sometimes that sometimes is
[31:57] to conf fuse the minds of the wise and
[31:59] prudent it doesn't look that much so
[32:01] that babes will have a chance to to know
[32:03] it and if God Through the Ages has done
[32:05] this and many times what he does seems
[32:07] to be ridiculous in the sight of The
[32:09] World God can do some of the most
[32:12] ridiculous things in the eyes of the
[32:13] world so don't be deceived by what you
[32:15] see big old strong Goliath and little
[32:17] old David but God was with David because
[32:19] his word was in David see this guy here
[32:22] what do they call him the they called
[32:24] this guy the king of rock where is he
[32:26] now
[32:28] yep he's
[32:30] gone
[32:32] lost but he's declared to this day the
[32:34] king of rock but he lost y so so the
[32:36] people that followed him and went along
[32:38] with his thing and that then the
[32:39] millions he dragged down to Hell lost
[32:40] with him this guy here I mean he I think
[32:43] he died of a heart attack you know just
[32:46] not even very old this guy here the King
[32:48] of Pop where is he
[32:50] now
[32:52] lost many people took arms for these men
[32:55] yeah they took arms they supported them
[32:57] they were this is this this is the guy
[32:58] and they were they took
[32:59] arms but I'm glad that we serve this guy
[33:02] the King of Kings
[33:05] undefeated the all there's a song that
[33:07] says is The alltime Undefeated
[33:09] Undisputed champion of love amen that's
[33:12] who we serve and God chose a little old
[33:14] Ruddy warty looking guy by the name of
[33:17] David with a little sheep skinn coat on
[33:18] him and a slingshot packing in his hand
[33:20] to slay that giant and take over God
[33:22] uses simple things that seem ridiculous
[33:24] in the side of the world he does that to
[33:25] show his great power so little guys
[33:28] follow don't matter how ridiculous it
[33:30] looks follow this guy make this guy the
[33:33] center point of your life cuz this guy
[33:34] is the winner bear armor for this guy
[33:37] amen don't bear armor for nothing else
[33:38] don't matter what it looks like bear
[33:40] armor for this guy am amen I want to
[33:43] just touch on a few little things how
[33:45] about a disloyal armor Bearer you know
[33:48] we get some armor bearers that are
[33:49] disloyal there was a king called a B I
[33:52] believe his name was is that have I got
[33:54] his name right Bible scholars
[33:57] you all you all put your hand up yeah
[33:59] that's
[34:00] [Laughter]
[34:02] me you know it's like that some a lot of
[34:04] people in church don't even read they
[34:05] not here but don't even read their Bible
[34:06] they just you know read it when the
[34:08] pastor reads the two verses and that's
[34:10] it but you know we're not like that
[34:11] we're all Bible
[34:12] scholars so now here now the Lord
[34:15] already had this man aimc because he
[34:17] done some evil things to be to be
[34:20] punished right so then he went and and
[34:23] sieged the city that had these big walls
[34:26] and then there was a lady up on the wall
[34:29] that was part of the fight and she got
[34:32] this big rock and she threw it down and
[34:34] it hit this King he was actually the
[34:37] king it hit him on the
[34:40] head and he was
[34:43] embarrassed because like it was a shame
[34:46] that a woman threw a rock on me and I
[34:48] died and I I sometimes often Marvel how
[34:52] these guys think that on their deathbed
[34:53] wouldn't they think of oh I won't see my
[34:55] family again you know tell my children I
[34:57] love
[34:58] their last thought is oh no a woman
[35:00] threw a rock at me and hit me and and my
[35:02] legacy is going to be that a woman
[35:03] killed me that's what he thought he
[35:06] should have been thinking oh God I'm
[35:08] coming to you it shows what he was shows
[35:10] what was in him yeah Lord Lord here I am
[35:13] I'm going to enter into Glory but no oh
[35:14] a woman thrw a rock at me now I'm going
[35:16] to die so what does he say he turns to
[35:17] his armor Bearer here's here he is there
[35:20] Rock hting Millstone hitting his head
[35:23] then he turns to his armor Bearer he
[35:25] says kill me so that say so that no one
[35:28] says that a rock at me by that a woman
[35:30] threw a rock at me so kill me instead
[35:34] isn't that stupid and we still know what
[35:36] happened to
[35:37] [Laughter]
[35:42] him so he
[35:45] failed then he called hastily unto his
[35:48] young man a AR bear and said draw thy
[35:49] sword and slay me that men say not of me
[35:52] a woman slew him and his young man
[35:55] thrust him through and he died and when
[35:57] the men of Israel saw that aimik was
[35:59] dead they departed every man into his
[36:02] place now I don't know about this but I
[36:04] don't think that armor bear should have
[36:06] killed his
[36:08] king that's like come on man maybe why
[36:11] don't you at least try and say no I'm
[36:13] going to get you out of here we're going
[36:14] to we're going to try and resuscitate
[36:15] you we're going to try and save you look
[36:17] I to my last breath I'm going to try and
[36:19] help you we just said oh you want to die
[36:21] okay and off he went what sort of an
[36:24] armor beer is that when it when it came
[36:26] down to it kills
[36:28] him that's what that's what you call a
[36:30] disloyal armor Bearer you don't want to
[36:32] you don't want an armor Bearer like that
[36:34] or you don't want to be that sort of
[36:34] armor Bearer you know that when when a
[36:36] when a person you're following doesn't
[36:37] quite work out oh well he's gone down
[36:40] stab him off to the next well let's pick
[36:41] another guy to
[36:43] serve you understand where we're going
[36:45] with this like that's there are people
[36:47] that are like that yeah I'll serve you
[36:49] I'm all for this then when it doesn't
[36:50] quite go their way stab them and off
[36:52] they go to something else
[36:54] disloyal now these are just natural
[36:56] examples I don't want to dwell on these
[36:57] but this guy was the greatest guy out
[36:59] cuz he made electric cars and people
[37:00] thought well this guy's a green making
[37:02] electric cars he's the best thing in the
[37:03] world you know cuz he's going to saved
[37:05] the planet people loved
[37:07] him you know we're going to bear arms
[37:09] for this guy where they were CH
[37:10] championing his cause you know this is
[37:13] just a natural example of how how men
[37:16] and women just turn you know and you
[37:18] know all the news articles about him
[37:19] were just this guy's fantastic he's
[37:21] going to he's going to change the world
[37:23] change the future he's making this car
[37:25] that's going to be electric so we stop
[37:26] all the greenhouse gases and Save the
[37:27] planet you know and then but then he
[37:30] decides to sort of buy a certain uh
[37:34] social media platform and allow any your
[37:35] voices to be there which which his armor
[37:37] bearers didn't like so then they sort of
[37:39] stabbed him oh well that's you
[37:42] done like I'm using this as a silly
[37:46] example but this
[37:47] is it was the same guy making the same
[37:50] cars but no we don't like him anymore
[37:52] and they you
[37:53] know it says here another article he was
[37:56] booed at a comedy show which she says
[37:57] was a first for him in real life you
[37:59] don't like me anymore you know oh he's
[38:02] you
[38:03] know I don't know if I should do this
[38:04] but this these are just these are silly
[38:06] examples but it shows and I don't
[38:08] condone I don't I'm not for any of this
[38:10] sort of stuff I think there's only God's
[38:12] side or Satan side don't get caught up
[38:14] in these other there's not all these
[38:16] other sides but the the I haven't seen
[38:18] any read this book or seen any of these
[38:19] movies you shouldn't but the Harry
[38:20] Potter one everyone loved her until she
[38:23] said that transex like trans woman
[38:25] wasn't a woman now they hate her but but
[38:29] you see they was she was the best thing
[38:31] out and then when it didn't quite go
[38:33] their way you know the thing they were
[38:36] the the the person they were bearing
[38:37] armor for and supporting could easily
[38:38] just turn and and stab
[38:41] them that's what Judas did you know
[38:44] supporting the Lord yeah I'll be with
[38:45] you and then oh when it when it wasn't
[38:47] quite working out and it just he turned
[38:48] and then you know but that's not
[38:51] us because a a true a true armor Bearer
[38:54] for the Lord is loyal yeah you know we
[38:56] we don't just turn we we go go through
[38:57] the thick and through the thin but I put
[38:59] that in there to to say that you know
[39:01] you know some people in the world oh I'm
[39:03] going to be your buddy through thick and
[39:04] thin you know then you go and serve the
[39:07] Lord and suddenly the thick and thin
[39:09] buddies are nowhere to be seen you know
[39:11] turn on your real fast you know cuz it
[39:15] it was never based on anything solid and
[39:17] secure you
[39:19] know this one here is a little bit a
[39:21] little bit sort of uh slightly
[39:25] deeper but but there's a this what I
[39:27] mean it goes a bit deeper when you think
[39:29] about
[39:30] bearing uh taking up arms for a
[39:34] cause
[39:35] like and this this is more a bit more
[39:38] serious but you but you
[39:41] could people can take up a cause for the
[39:44] the gospel of a previous age like a like
[39:46] a Methodist cause or a Luther cause
[39:48] something and it's a it's overall a good
[39:50] cause and they're overall good
[39:52] people but essentially they are still
[39:56] championing for a cause that's not quite
[39:59] going to work at the end even though
[40:01] it's a good cause they they're not
[40:03] they're not overall doing something bad
[40:05] I I'll show you what I mean so so King
[40:09] Saul at one point David was Saul's armor
[40:12] Bearer okay so because Saul was the
[40:15] anointed king and so David was was for
[40:17] him but at a certain point the anointing
[40:19] moved on from
[40:21] Saul okay so so
[40:24] then and then when that happened so did
[40:26] David
[40:28] not that David didn't like Saul but
[40:29] David was following the anointing
[40:31] because he he was there was something
[40:33] greater than just a man he there's
[40:35] there's the anointing but the anointing
[40:37] had left off from Saul and that because
[40:39] the Lord said and the Lord said unto
[40:41] Samuel how long wil thou mourn for Saul
[40:43] seeing how I have rejected him from
[40:44] reigning over Israel so David no longer
[40:47] served him in it and it's not because he
[40:50] was dis loyless he actually he was
[40:51] serving the god in him and if God moved
[40:53] on he moved on and now now he he
[40:55] wouldn't have had animosity because even
[40:57] when he could have killed Saul later on
[40:59] he didn't he didn't kill him he just
[41:01] said look I respect you everything I
[41:02] just I'm just following the Lord and
[41:04] that's what we do I believe that's what
[41:05] brother Colin's done you know with the
[41:07] sometimes when you follow the lord you
[41:08] have to you sometimes get disagreements
[41:10] with people that don't see it the same
[41:12] way you don't just knock him down you
[41:13] say look that's you respect but you say
[41:15] look I'm end of the day I'm going to I'm
[41:17] going to keep moving on and follow this
[41:19] the Christ that I see in the
[41:22] word right you understand because you
[41:25] got to the scenario then there this is
[41:27] this is not so much this this armor
[41:29] Bearer for Saul now he was a good man he
[41:32] was he was cuz Saul was a king of Israel
[41:35] and they were sort of they were
[41:36] wholesome good and and and it it played
[41:39] out when they got to a situation where
[41:42] Saul's rain came to his life came to an
[41:44] end it says and the battle went s
[41:46] against Saul and The Archers hit him and
[41:47] he was sore wounded Over The
[41:49] Archers and then Saul once again said to
[41:52] the armor Bearer draw thy sword and
[41:53] thrust me therewith lest his
[41:55] uncircumcised come and thrust me through
[41:57] through and Abus me but his armor Bearer
[41:59] would not he still had some bit of
[42:02] decency in him he would not yeah we
[42:04] can't do that you know they still stick
[42:07] with it even though it's sort of going
[42:09] down for he was s afraid therefore
[42:13] Saul took his sword and fell upon it and
[42:16] then what did the armor bear do and when
[42:18] his armor bear saw saw that Saul was
[42:20] dead he fell likewise upon his sword and
[42:23] died with him they still went the same
[42:25] way though he was still championing for
[42:27] a cause that you know that EV that
[42:30] eventually was not going to work out and
[42:32] it's a shame that that at the end time
[42:36] there's going to be weeping and nashing
[42:37] of teeth because they people will say
[42:39] Lord Lord didn't I do all these miracles
[42:41] in your name didn't I serve you didn't I
[42:42] do all this he'll say depart from me I
[42:43] even knew you your worker of iniquity CU
[42:46] they they they were following a saw we
[42:48] an anointing and moved on and they were
[42:49] still trying to fight for that cause
[42:51] it's a very deep thing and a powerful
[42:53] thing but they they at the end they both
[42:55] go down together they both that's the
[42:57] way but but that armor be could have
[42:59] said
[43:00] look I was you know before he went to
[43:03] this battle could have said look I just
[43:05] I I love you I respect you but I sort of
[43:07] want to move on and go with
[43:09] David you know and he could have it was
[43:13] his choice it was his choice to stick
[43:14] with soul
[43:17] see and got a few few more minutes here
[43:20] but but in this day we are we're CH
[43:24] we're called to be two things which is a
[43:26] Loy Royal armor Bearer for the word I I
[43:29] say for the word because it's Christ in
[43:31] our day cuz many people can say Jesus
[43:33] you say which one what Jesus the one
[43:35] that this person explains of him or the
[43:37] one that this person explains I believe
[43:39] the one that brother Brenham explains
[43:42] that
[43:42] Jesus um so we're an armor Bearer for
[43:46] that cause and for and also for his
[43:49] bride for each other we're armor bearers
[43:52] for each other I want to show you an
[43:53] example of a great armor Bearer there
[43:56] was a man called John which was actually
[43:57] Saul's son he was a good
[44:00] man and they came across the camp of the
[44:02] Philistines and Jonathan said to the
[44:04] young man that be his armor come and let
[44:06] us go over unto the Garrison of these
[44:08] uncircumcised it may be that the Lord
[44:10] will work for us for there is no
[44:11] restraint to the Lord to save by many or
[44:15] by few okay and his armor Bearer said
[44:18] unto him do all that is in thine heart
[44:21] turn thee behold I am with thee
[44:23] according to thy heart Lord not my will
[44:25] but thine be done you say move forward
[44:26] we move forward if your word says go
[44:29] here we go there if your word says this
[44:30] we do that wherever you say Lord that's
[44:32] where we
[44:33] go we get because he had absolute
[44:36] confidence in his armor bear that's
[44:37] where we go yep do all that's in your
[44:39] heart then said Jonathan behold we will
[44:42] pass over unto these men and we will
[44:44] discover ourselves unto them when he
[44:47] meant pass over it means they were on
[44:48] one side of this mountain and the
[44:50] Philistines were on the other side and
[44:52] he said what we're going to do is we're
[44:53] going to climb down the cliff we're
[44:55] going to go across the bottom we're
[44:56] going to climb up the other side and
[44:58] then we're going to pop up over the
[44:59] other side and not quite right where
[45:01] they are but we're going to go sort of
[45:02] halfway up enough to sort of see them
[45:04] right on
[45:06] top cuz he figured if we get to there we
[45:09] can sort of get away before they come
[45:10] down or we can go either way from there
[45:13] okay he said if they say thus unto us T
[45:17] until we come to you wait there we'll
[45:19] come down to
[45:21] you we will then we will stand still in
[45:24] our place and will not go up unto them
[45:27] but if they say thus come up unto us
[45:31] then we will go up for the Lord hath
[45:32] delivered them into our hand and this
[45:34] shall be a sign unto us okay so they're
[45:37] going to walk halfway up the hill hey
[45:40] guys and then they're going to they're
[45:42] going to wait and see what the
[45:43] Philistines say so they're waiting for a
[45:45] word there things have to tie together
[45:47] they've said if it's this we got to wait
[45:48] for this it all has to Dove tail
[45:50] together see they had to know we we've
[45:52] got to be sure what we're following you
[45:53] get where I'm going this the word has to
[45:55] all dovetail together you got to be sure
[45:56] what you're following and when it all
[45:58] ties up together you know right we've
[45:59] got a forward here it all that's why I
[46:01] follow this message because it ties
[46:03] together right that is that it says it
[46:04] in Genesis says it all the way through
[46:06] says it here it all adds up we can move
[46:08] forward amen the Lord's going to give us
[46:09] a victory amen see yes
[46:13] sir
[46:15] and I like this verse and the men of the
[46:18] Garrison answered oh then then it says
[46:22] they they went up a bit further and
[46:24] discovered themselves okay I missed that
[46:26] but out they discovered themselves and
[46:27] it says and the men of the Garrison
[46:30] answered Jonathan and his armor Bearer
[46:32] and said come up to us and we will show
[46:35] you a
[46:38] thing and I'm thinking they're thinking
[46:41] no no we'll show you a
[46:43] thing we'll show you a thing you know
[46:45] they're trying to trick them they said
[46:46] no no the joke's on you we'll show you a
[46:50] thing we're coming up to you and
[46:53] Jonathan said unto his armor Bearer come
[46:55] up after me for the Lord hath delivered
[46:57] them into the hand of Israel everything
[46:59] lines up we can go forward the word of
[47:01] God lines up here here we can move
[47:02] forward we're sure of where we're going
[47:04] we know where we stand we've got the
[47:05] word of God it lines up we can claim it
[47:07] we can move
[47:09] forward and these guys no matter the no
[47:11] matter the hardship they climbed up on
[47:13] their hands and knees up this ledge it
[47:15] says and Jonathan climbed up upon his
[47:17] hands and upon his feet and his armor
[47:19] bear after
[47:20] him climbing up after these guys and
[47:22] they climb up over the top and it says
[47:24] and they they begin to slay these
[47:26] Philistines about the space of about a
[47:28] half an acre and Jonathan and his armor
[47:30] Bearer were there just slaying
[47:32] Philistines probably about three times
[47:35] the distance of this room one after the
[47:38] other because they had a thus sayth the
[47:40] Lord we can move forward and it was
[47:42] Jonathan and his armor Bearer and you
[47:45] know when we have thus sayith the Lord
[47:47] from word from the Lord when we can see
[47:49] ourselves in the word when we can see
[47:50] the promises for us we can move forward
[47:52] together with the Lord because the Lord
[47:53] spoke it we just say Lord then we go
[47:54] forward and we go forward with the Lord
[47:57] I've got one more concept I want to give
[47:59] to you which was which goes a little bit
[48:01] even deeper than than than that because
[48:04] that was kind of following
[48:07] something that that's F but but there's
[48:09] even a concept I think that goes a we
[48:11] bit more deeper than
[48:13] that there's a there's a there's a
[48:16] people that at a
[48:19] certain at a certain time I got two more
[48:22] minutes at a certain
[48:24] time Jehovah the Great great god Jehovah
[48:28] becomes your armor
[48:30] Bearer and that's a powerful thought
[48:32] when you think about it you think oh so
[48:33] this great God's going to become
[48:34] subservient to me and and do what do my
[48:38] bidding my cause cuz an armor Bearer
[48:40] he's waiting if this if the if his King
[48:42] goes that way he goes that way now I got
[48:45] to be careful what I say here but there
[48:46] is this
[48:47] concept Psalm 35 says plead my cause O
[48:51] Lord with them that strive with me fight
[48:53] against them that fight against me he
[48:56] said take hold of shield and Buckler and
[48:58] stand up for my
[49:00] help draw out also the spear and stop
[49:03] the way against them that persecute my
[49:05] soul say persecute me say unto my soul I
[49:08] am thy
[49:10] salvation
[49:13] now when when brother Brenham spoke the
[49:16] squirrels into
[49:19] existence it was a something different
[49:21] happened in that scenario God didn't say
[49:24] to
[49:25] him speak out and say a squirrel will
[49:28] come out of there and onto that one and
[49:30] down onto there and over there he said
[49:33] where do you want the squirrel to
[49:35] go he said you tell me what you want me
[49:37] to
[49:39] do and then he said okay I want it to go
[49:43] there there there and there and he said
[49:45] okay he had if I could put it in a in a
[49:49] respectful term but Jehovah God was at
[49:50] his
[49:51] bidding what whatever he said God would
[49:54] have done wow now
[49:58] there's a when we know we're moving
[50:00] forward in the Lord and we're fighting
[50:02] his cause and we're in his
[50:05] word then then we can call Jehovah God
[50:09] come and fight this
[50:11] battle come and fight this battle with
[50:13] me if we're if we're on the right
[50:16] cause and that's the place of adoption
[50:19] like it's like with David you know I
[50:21] teach them how to lay flaws and then
[50:23] these days I got to admit when I go and
[50:25] I was always the boss for a long time
[50:27] you know I was the boss and he was the
[50:28] young fellow learning learning learning
[50:30] these days he's better than me laid more
[50:32] flaws than me I go there and I'm like
[50:34] okay what do I do
[50:35] man which room do you want me to do you
[50:38] know if I work with them I say where am
[50:39] I going and I don't feel like oh man you
[50:42] know I don't feel small I feel man this
[50:44] is good my son's now he's in charge yep
[50:47] I'll support you what do you want what
[50:48] do you want me to do man I'll support
[50:50] you cuz I know he's he's going to
[50:51] achieve the same thing that I would have
[50:53] achieved and that's where God wants us
[50:55] to get to is he actually wants us to
[50:56] take up the Sword move forward sometimes
[50:59] you go through things you think Lord
[51:00] where's my help why aren't you with me
[51:02] sometimes he just leaves you he says
[51:04] look you've got the sword I can't I
[51:07] can't just go and fight every battle for
[51:08] you you've got to take up the sword
[51:10] yourself and fight by faith now if you
[51:13] really get in trouble I'll be there I'm
[51:14] your armor bear I'll you know you won't
[51:16] fail but you know sometimes we wonder
[51:18] where is God but
[51:19] he's I'm not saying you have to do it to
[51:22] yourself but I'm saying God wants to
[51:23] make
[51:24] warriors out of us
[51:27] and and and he'll be happy when he'll be
[51:30] happy you know I wasn't upset when Dave
[51:32] told me what to do yep where do I go
[51:35] good man let's do
[51:36] this if I could just leave that there
[51:38] but have a think about that because
[51:39] that's the age that we're coming in is
[51:40] that we are adopted Sons and Daughters
[51:42] of God and we we've got the sword of the
[51:45] word in our hand and we know who we are
[51:46] yes we know what our fight is and we
[51:48] only fight in the right way amen praise
