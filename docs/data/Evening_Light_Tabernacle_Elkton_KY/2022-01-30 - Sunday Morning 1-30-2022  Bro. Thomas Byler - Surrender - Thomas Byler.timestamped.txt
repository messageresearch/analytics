[17:44] [Music]
[17:48] [Applause]
[17:53] is
[18:32] this morning in my office
[18:35] but uh let me not get ahead of
[18:41] you know people myself the first couple
[18:42] of verses
[18:45] i was just saying it was kind of funny
[18:48] the people in our land said they jesus
[18:50] christ
[19:21] foreign
[19:35] for they shall be
[19:50] mercy blessed are the pure heart for
[19:53] they shall see god
[19:55] and blessed are the peace but they
[19:57] should be called the children of god you
[19:59] know think about christian spirit
[20:01] if you don't want to be in conflict
[20:04] every day of this life with other people
[20:06] it wants to make peace doesn't mean that
[20:08] you can make people think like you do or
[20:10] believe like you but you don't ever want
[20:12] to have a state of thought or a state of
[20:14] war either with your neighbors or
[20:16] brothers you want to you want to get a
[20:33] uh blessed are they which are persecuted
[20:35] for righteousness for theirs is the
[20:37] kingdom of heaven
[20:39] blessed are you my man shall revive
[20:42] persecute you and shall say all manner
[20:44] of evil against you
[20:46] father
[21:25] is
[21:33] [Music]
[21:38] [Music]
[21:42] the world
[21:55] you should be afraid to tell people
[22:23] and you know that not to be judged
[22:39] sunshine and coordinate and make my
[22:41] season's work to glorify your problems
[22:45] that i've come to destroy
[22:48] i've come enough to destroy them
[22:52] a lot of people overlook
[22:56] simple scriptures like that and they go
[22:58] on the very last stance of having a
[23:00] haircut
[23:01] now one job
[23:02] and nobody should pass them along
[23:04] through it all
[23:06] and then he goes off and says whosoever
[23:08] therefore shall break whatever the least
[23:10] of the commandments and shall teach men
[23:12] so he shall be called the least of the
[23:14] kingdom of heaven and whatsoever is
[23:16] showing indeed and teach them the same
[23:19] shall be called great in the kingdom of
[23:48] inside
[24:01] that he needed to do on the
[24:14] [Applause]
[24:17] in the age double lift i was going to
[24:19] jump over here
[24:21] to the i think it's the 23rd chapter
[24:26] here and then i was going to go back
[24:27] here to my
[24:28] channel
[24:29] when i was listening to that message
[24:31] this morning
[24:34] and the thing that struck me he was
[24:35] talking about
[24:37] the family
[24:38] and this was in 1988 i was born
[24:41] all the way back in 1958 talking about
[24:45] the family the basic family group in the
[24:48] united states in the 1950s i worked in
[24:50] 2022
[24:53] and you know that's
[24:54] 53 years ago
[24:57] from there
[24:58] and he was talking about how
[25:00] women are eliminating war and there's no
[25:03] virtue out there
[25:05] back in 2022
[25:07] and he always said that the satan in
[25:10] himself was destroyed
[25:12] the relationship between children and
[25:14] their father and father he wants to
[25:16] break that error because once you break
[25:18] that down
[25:19] then there's nothing to hold you anymore
[25:21] and that's what we see today
[25:23] in 2002 and made
[25:27] they tell women now that they don't need
[25:29] a father that the state will take care
[25:31] of them and their children and we're
[25:34] going to point down our own country
[25:36] where the state says
[25:38] our children
[25:39] teach their children the state will do
[25:42] it for you all right and as you can see
[25:44] that isn't working really well
[25:46] in many of the other countries in the
[25:48] world once you break down that
[25:50] relationship
[25:51] with the children there's no stability
[25:53] of their life
[26:06] you know
[26:06] the thing about
[26:36] god thank you
[26:38] whatever we do but i'll just read these
[26:39] scriptures here
[26:41] so i don't say something i shouldn't say
[26:43] anything
[26:44] jesus goes on
[26:45] and kills
[26:47] the people i don't know i'll just jump
[26:49] right here
[27:34] [Laughter]
[27:46] and this is in daniel the fourth chapter
[27:48] of the 27th verse wherefore lord let my
[27:51] counsel be acceptable unto me and break
[27:53] all of my faith by
[27:56] righteousness by showing mercy to the
[27:58] poor
[28:30] [Music]
[28:45] [Applause]
[28:52] god's knowledge this morning and he goes
[28:54] on saying the need
[29:08] [Music]
[29:20] this morning
[29:38] in fact if you have any homes
[29:40] in your country or in your
[29:45] town disappointment
[29:48] [Applause]
[29:53] have to get anymore with it but you can
[29:54] get better in jesus christ i think it
[29:57] works you only want people to be happy
[29:59] and want them to be successful but
[30:03] no matter what happens out there you
[30:04] can't let other people
[30:12] um
[30:22] stand if we could and
[30:24] amen
[30:27] it's good to be in the house of the lord
[30:29] this morning it's

[33:51] you know
[33:53] i've seen a
[33:54] little video the other day at a
[33:56] pentecostal preacher and i kind of
[33:58] chuckled
[34:00] because
[34:02] the second one i've seen of him i knew
[34:05] that he had been reading brother
[34:07] branham's books and listening to him
[34:09] but he was talking about
[34:11] sports and
[34:13] it was kind of funny because i like
[34:14] baseball and some of you like different
[34:16] things but he said you know he said
[34:19] you'll go to those games and you'll pay
[34:21] all that money
[34:22] and so you'll act like a wild man but he
[34:24] said when you come to church you're just
[34:26] and he sit down on the
[34:28] monitor and just sit there and he said
[34:29] you don't
[34:30] and he said this is something that's
[34:32] life everlasting for your heart life
[34:34] what the lord's done for you this
[34:36] morning i thought that's true
[34:39] but i'm so glad that he lives in our
[34:41] heart and life this morning and we're
[34:42] going to sing that praise him again
[34:45] but this time i should say we're not
[34:47] going to sing it we're just going to
[34:48] play our instruments this morning
[34:51] if
[34:52] we could we'll pray
[34:55] [Music]
[35:15] everybody together if we could this
[35:17] morning oh why don't you
[35:19] praise him oh
[35:22] praise him oh praise me in the morning

[54:11] of you people that

[54:18] i'll tell you what we all got our ideas
[54:20] about stuff

[54:25] sometimes but if they don't vote you in
[54:26] as a leader try not to do that
[54:29] amen and i don't not anybody is but it's
[54:33] it in our own mind when you're talking
[54:35] to somebody remember each one of us
[54:37] thinks we're right
[54:39] and we're all have different ideas
[54:41] sometimes you know and those are the
[54:42] kind of things you got to lay aside you
[54:44] know i mean you have to ask yourself
[54:46] this question that is is god blessing it
[54:49] amen
[54:50] are you even edified by it is god in it
[54:52] amen because if that
[54:54] that's the way that it is well it
[54:56] doesn't have to be just the way you
[54:57] think or i think amen
[54:59] amen but we want what god thinks am i
[55:01] right
[55:02] so god bless you amen and i do
[55:04] appreciate for this last year and and
[55:06] the blessing god has bestowed upon us i
[55:08] do know that god is blessed in a way
[55:10] here in the last decade or so i guess uh
[55:13] even especially in the finances and so
[55:15] forth amen like we didn't see for many
[55:18] over a decade that we did see god
[55:20] blessing us we've you know we ran into
[55:22] the 5 000 or two maybe but now it's ten
[55:25] thousand fifteen thousand sometimes that
[55:27] we have in the bank and that's a real
[55:29] blessing because and i know that god's
[55:31] god blesses those that give amen and
[55:33] we're just thankful for that and and a
[55:35] special thanks to brother brian also
[55:37] because we know it's a lot of work we we
[55:40] do work but when he does that paperwork
[55:42] every week and pays all those bills
[55:44] every month he does an exceptional job
[55:47] amen and i don't know why in the world
[55:49] we didn't get together and say hey let's
[55:50] up this uh payment plan a little bit
[55:53] quicker amen and but actually because
[55:55] just since we i told him to do it we was
[55:57] over a hundred thousand what was it less
[55:59] than a year ago but down to what 80 or
[56:02] something 79
[56:04] 78 praise the lord so you know how happy
[56:07] that makes me it just like took a big
[56:08] old bite out of it amen
[56:10] i mean i believe it's going to get bit
[56:12] down real quick amen so god bless you i
[56:14] don't mean to keep you standing too long
[56:16] but i didn't want to sit you down but i
[56:18] just want to say that god bless you this
[56:20] morning it's good to be a christian this
[56:22] morning i want to say that i believe
[56:25] that a church like this amen the way
[56:28] that it's set up is of god
[56:31] amen and our coming together and
[56:33] worshiping and being edified it's god's
[56:36] plan
[56:37] how many believes that it's god's plan
[56:39] and you can't you can't better that you
[56:42] can't change that and expect to be
[56:44] blessed

[58:08] forth and we ask god that you just be
[58:09] with him just now lord in the name of
[58:12] jesus christ we ask god that he would be
[58:14] better before this service is overlord
[58:16] and that would leave him lord jesus and
[58:18] he would feel good we ask god that you
[58:20] bless every heart every soul that is
[58:22] coming to your house according to your
[58:24] word not forsakingly assembling
[58:25] ourselves together lord jesus but so

[58:31] those who were able to make it out this
[58:32] morning and lord we just ask your
[58:34] blessing upon the reading a word the
[58:36] meditation of our heart that which we
[58:38] feel that you have laid upon our heart
[58:40] to speak on this morning may it bless
[58:42] your people in the name of jesus christ
[58:44] we ask it amen and amen
[58:48] all right turn your bibles if you will
[58:50] and we'll go to
[58:51] um
[58:52] the book of matthew i only have like i
[58:55] don't know i i i they're targets and i
[58:57] picked up a few more scriptures but i
[58:59] don't have a lot of scriptures but i do
[59:01] have quite a few quotes that i'd like to
[59:02] read this morning if the lord will
[59:04] permit
[59:05] amen matthew
[59:08] 11
[59:08] [Music]
[59:11] 28 through 30
[59:14] and i want to talk to you this morning
[59:16] about the power of a surrendered
[59:20] life
[59:21] the power of a surrendered
[59:24] life
[59:25] surrender
[59:27] amen
[59:28] that's going to be our thought
[59:33] matthew 11 and 28 come unto me
[59:36] all ye that labor
[59:38] and are heavy laden
[59:40] and i will give you
[59:42] rest
[59:44] amen aren't you glad for that take my
[59:46] yoke upon you and learn of me for i am
[59:49] meek and lowly in the heart and ye shall
[59:51] find
[59:53] rest
[59:55] unto your souls for my yoke is easy and
[59:58] my burden is light hebrews 4.
[1:00:14] 9 through 11.
[1:00:22] i think the prophet god said he was
[1:00:24] waiting for the leaves to quit turning
[1:00:27] amen you can hear him ruslan
[1:00:30] we don't want to leave you out
[1:00:31] nine four and eleven hebrews four and
[1:00:34] i'm sorry
[1:00:35] for hebrews four chapter four
[1:00:38] verse nine through
[1:00:40] eleven
[1:00:44] there remaineth therefore a rest to the
[1:00:47] people of god
[1:00:48] he for he that is entered into his rest
[1:00:52] he also has ceased from his own works as
[1:00:54] god did from his
[1:00:56] let us labor therefore
[1:00:59] amen
[1:01:00] to enter into that rest least any man
[1:01:03] fall after the same example of unbelief
[1:01:06] may god that is blessing instead of
[1:01:08] reading the word you can be seated this
[1:01:09] morning
[1:01:12] amen
[1:01:15] i want to say things that i've said many
[1:01:18] times here before
[1:01:19] but once again i feel
[1:01:21] to say it again is that okay
[1:01:26] as we
[1:01:28] strive to get closer to god and like we
[1:01:31] said i think on our last service
[1:01:33] with every
[1:01:35] tick
[1:01:36] of the clock
[1:01:38] you get closer to god
[1:01:40] with every tick is that right
[1:01:43] because you only have so much time
[1:01:45] and we know that even
[1:01:48] even if you don't see god
[1:01:51] till after the thousand years
[1:01:54] right
[1:01:55] even if you don't come up
[1:01:57] until after the second in but in the
[1:01:59] first resurrection but you come up in
[1:02:01] the second resurrection
[1:02:03] which we know the sinners up here
[1:02:04] they're still going to
[1:02:06] see god
[1:02:08] because the bible says every eye shall
[1:02:10] see him and though that pierced him
[1:02:11] that'll look upon him right
[1:02:14] they're all going to come face to face
[1:02:16] with god so they're going to meet god
[1:02:19] that's right
[1:02:20] whether it's our president whether it's
[1:02:22] nancy or chuck schumer or
[1:02:25] all of our
[1:02:26] uh elected officials all of them
[1:02:28] they're all gonna stand before god and
[1:02:31] they're gonna have to confess that he is
[1:02:34] is that right
[1:02:36] everyone's going to have to stand before
[1:02:38] him one day
[1:02:40] blah blah blah blah blah say what you
[1:02:42] want but you're going to stand in front
[1:02:43] of them
[1:02:45] that's there's no question about that
[1:02:48] amen
[1:02:48] and all of your blah blah blah
[1:02:51] you're going to have to answer for
[1:02:53] everything else is blah blah this here
[1:02:56] is yay amen how many knows this is the
[1:02:58] truth
[1:03:00] amen
[1:03:01] so we're not looking for that time we
[1:03:03] don't want to be in that place we want
[1:03:05] to see god amen in the first
[1:03:07] resurrection
[1:03:09] amen any time now i may believe we're
[1:03:11] going to see him any time now
[1:03:13] even when brother ben went beyond the
[1:03:14] curtain of time he wanted to see him i
[1:03:16] want to see my match i want to see jesus
[1:03:21] you can't have a little sneak peek you
[1:03:23] can't go up beforehand kind of look no
[1:03:26] we're all going to see him at the same
[1:03:27] time
[1:03:29] that right
[1:03:30] amen and we're going to meet him in the
[1:03:32] skies so shall we ever
[1:03:34] be with the lord
[1:03:36] and that's what we come to church for
[1:03:38] this morning is to get ready
[1:03:40] to meet him
[1:03:41] how many believes that the prophet of
[1:03:43] god was uh
[1:03:45] ordained and sent
[1:03:47] to dress the bride to get the bride
[1:03:51] ready
[1:03:52] amen
[1:03:54] you reckon if uh you reckon the churches
[1:03:56] out there are ready to meet him
[1:03:58] no
[1:04:00] no they're not ready to meet him
[1:04:02] they dress like prostitutes look like
[1:04:04] prostitutes
[1:04:05] go to church you're gonna have to turn
[1:04:07] your head with the way the women are
[1:04:08] dressed
[1:04:09] that's right if you've got the holy
[1:04:10] ghost turn your head
[1:04:13] that's not the house of god that's not
[1:04:15] the church of god god ain't going to
[1:04:16] marry a prostitute
[1:04:18] he's not going to you know
[1:04:20] marry something like that he's going to
[1:04:22] come with a people that is humble that
[1:04:24] loves him with all of his heart
[1:04:27] amen praise the lord
[1:04:29] so let me just start with saying this
[1:04:32] amen and i'm thinking it was either the
[1:04:34] greatest battle ever fought for some
[1:04:36] reason my printer don't put the title on
[1:04:37] it but um
[1:04:40] the problem of god says it this way
[1:04:42] there's little things that we do
[1:04:44] all right
[1:04:46] and that's what we come to church for
[1:04:48] amen
[1:04:50] we have a purpose to come in church
[1:04:52] don't we
[1:04:53] everybody come for church if you look
[1:04:54] for criticism talking to criticize
[1:04:57] you'll certainly find plenty
[1:05:01] but the purpose listen this is what we
[1:05:02] come to church for is to find
[1:05:06] how where our fault is
[1:05:11] amen
[1:05:13] what our fault is and the things that we
[1:05:15] might better ourselves
[1:05:18] amen i believe that don't you amen find
[1:05:22] our weak places our weaknesses to find
[1:05:27] our bad places
[1:05:29] boy i sure wish he'd quit preaching on
[1:05:31] me
[1:05:32] oh my looks like he's doing his job
[1:05:34] right right that's right but that's you
[1:05:37] you know
[1:05:39] the holy spirit knows how to talk to you
[1:05:43] he sure does
[1:05:44] to find our bad places to find our weak
[1:05:47] places let me say this to find those
[1:05:50] places that are not yet surrendered to
[1:05:53] god
[1:05:56] oh my god
[1:05:58] i want you to know there is immense
[1:06:00] everything lays in jesus christ
[1:06:04] everything lays in a surrendered life to
[1:06:07] almighty god
[1:06:08] [Music]
[1:06:09] because i'll tell you if you're even
[1:06:11] going to accept him even if you're going
[1:06:12] to have faith in god you have to
[1:06:15] surrender to faith
[1:06:18] and that right you got to choose not to
[1:06:20] disbelieve and you're going to have to
[1:06:22] choose to believe that god said it so
[1:06:24] you surrender to what god said
[1:06:28] and with that comes a great reward right
[1:06:32] there is nothing like being surrendered
[1:06:35] to god
[1:06:39] i don't know what teacher was but i
[1:06:40] believe he was preaching not to go long
[1:06:42] ago mentioned that
[1:06:43] maybe it was brother brad i don't know
[1:06:44] but there's a saying that they said the
[1:06:46] world has yeah i think it was him the
[1:06:47] world has yet to see
[1:06:50] now i won't be able to paraphrase it
[1:06:51] perfectly what it's like
[1:06:53] the power that a man would have that's
[1:06:56] completely in the hands of god are
[1:06:58] completely surrendered to god
[1:07:04] and you know one thing i thought about
[1:07:06] when he said that is we did see
[1:07:09] we did see
[1:07:11] the power that a man would have
[1:07:14] completely surrendered to almighty god
[1:07:16] and that was brother brethren
[1:07:20] that's right
[1:07:23] praise the lord
[1:07:26] oh my aren't you glad for what god let
[1:07:28] me tell you something if it wouldn't
[1:07:29] have been for god
[1:07:31] malachi
[1:07:32] malachi 4 this would be done with
[1:07:37] it would be over with
[1:07:39] he says least i come and smite the earth
[1:07:42] with a curse
[1:07:43] in other words if i don't send him i'm
[1:07:45] gonna curse the whole thing
[1:07:47] huh
[1:07:49] but he did that because he knew that we
[1:07:51] would need it
[1:07:53] you know it's different it's one thing
[1:07:54] for a preacher to come here and preach
[1:07:56] and say stuff but it says that the god
[1:07:59] showing them witness witnessing the
[1:08:02] apostles i believe it mark he says
[1:08:04] through signs and wonders and miracles
[1:08:08] god comes and backs it up when god comes
[1:08:10] and proves something
[1:08:12] huh
[1:08:13] and i've talked to people that got
[1:08:16] revelations that have all went off into
[1:08:18] the left field of this message hello
[1:08:20] and they'll come up with sayings right
[1:08:23] and you have to take their sayings or
[1:08:24] what the prophet said who do you think
[1:08:26] i'm going to go in
[1:08:28] i always tell them well if it's
[1:08:29] according to your word i still want to
[1:08:31] see the vindication i want to see god
[1:08:33] come down here and open blind eyes and
[1:08:35] discern the thoughts intents of the
[1:08:36] heart then maybe i could believe what
[1:08:38] you said but i wouldn't even believe it
[1:08:40] then if it was according to the word
[1:08:43] huh
[1:08:44] but here a man that did that would speak
[1:08:46] the word and it would be according to
[1:08:48] the bible and god himself would come
[1:08:50] down and vindicate it you just believe
[1:08:52] that you're worthy of hell
[1:08:54] brother bam says that is then sin
[1:08:59] amen it's sin to disbelieve now
[1:09:03] after god himself comes down and does
[1:09:05] that
[1:09:06] praise the lord
[1:09:08] amen
[1:09:09] so praise the lord
[1:09:11] we want to talk about
[1:09:13] victory
[1:09:14] amen
[1:09:16] these we've been talking about the
[1:09:18] battle space isn't that right
[1:09:20] battles we have to fight
[1:09:22] right
[1:09:24] and man sometimes it just seems like you
[1:09:26] can't barely we just struggle and labor
[1:09:29] and fight and paddle and paddle and
[1:09:32] battling we should
[1:09:34] didn't the bible say didn't we read that
[1:09:36] he says let us labor let us struggle let
[1:09:39] us have a burden let's be heavy later oh
[1:09:42] i just can't take it no more
[1:09:48] then god says take all of your mess take
[1:09:50] all of your bird and take all of that
[1:09:52] come and cast it upon me
[1:09:55] come up to me
[1:09:57] all these that are weary and heavy laid
[1:09:59] in that you got burdens and so forth
[1:10:04] and what will he do when you come to him
[1:10:06] when you surrender to him he will give
[1:10:14] rest
[1:10:19] oh my
[1:10:21] i've got a couple questions here
[1:10:24] let me see where they are i might have a
[1:10:25] hard time this morning to keep involved
[1:10:27] with this but i got three questions
[1:10:29] all right first of all what is the
[1:10:31] meaning of surrender
[1:10:33] what is this not meaning what is the
[1:10:36] what's the symbol of surrender
[1:10:40] how many knows what the symbol of
[1:10:41] surrender is
[1:10:43] that's it brother joe your brother dave
[1:10:45] we got two that know what the symbol of
[1:10:46] surrender is
[1:10:49] is that it
[1:10:52] everybody should understand what that
[1:10:54] means
[1:10:59] when that cop comes up
[1:11:01] chases the guy down
[1:11:03] he gets perhaps out of the car
[1:11:06] amen and he gets on the ground or what
[1:11:07] are you standing up trying to get up
[1:11:09] what does the cop say
[1:11:11] hands up
[1:11:14] right
[1:11:15] get your hands up
[1:11:17] because they don't want it oh no gun
[1:11:19] they don't want it on the weapon they
[1:11:21] want to see that you ain't got a hold of
[1:11:22] nothing
[1:11:25] huh and also that you're surrendering
[1:11:30] oh my
[1:11:32] we let that talk politics shall we
[1:11:34] because that's a real mess
[1:11:38] huh
[1:11:39] that's a real mess with our cops
[1:11:42] with our police
[1:11:43] and the disrespect they get
[1:11:46] you know it's like they expect every cop
[1:11:48] to be good
[1:11:50] when have you been in any organization
[1:11:52] or even in this church where everything
[1:11:54] was just right
[1:11:57] even here are three kinds of believers
[1:11:58] hello
[1:11:59] no they're not all good but you don't
[1:12:01] throw the baby out with the bathwater
[1:12:05] amen all right we're going to get right
[1:12:07] off of that now
[1:12:09] [Music]
[1:12:10] he says surrender the symbol is
[1:12:11] surrender and get your hands off of
[1:12:14] anything
[1:12:16] that makes me feel good when i think
[1:12:17] about that's what god wants you to do
[1:12:19] get your hands off of it
[1:12:23] and let him do it
[1:12:29] [Music]
[1:12:31] i knew it was going to be good this
[1:12:32] morning
[1:12:39] praise be to god you love him
[1:12:43] the second question
[1:12:48] question number two
[1:12:51] what
[1:12:52] does
[1:12:53] victory
[1:12:54] sound like
[1:12:56] amen
[1:13:00] i i i am not hearing anything
[1:13:04] what does it sound like
[1:13:05] [Applause]
[1:13:11] glory
[1:13:13] that's what it sounds like
[1:13:15] you know in new york when all of our
[1:13:17] soldiers came home
[1:13:19] you know from new york and they seen the
[1:13:20] statue of liberty do you know what they
[1:13:22] did
[1:13:23] and they were screaming and hollering
[1:13:24] and carrying on you ain't never heard
[1:13:27] the likes
[1:13:28] there's also always a great noise that
[1:13:31] happens in every battle but there is a
[1:13:33] victory you've got the shout of victory
[1:13:36] in the camp
[1:13:37] [Applause]
[1:13:39] that's what we need it's the shout of
[1:13:41] victory
[1:13:43] can i tell you story about this taking
[1:13:46] our time brother venom up says about 15
[1:13:49] years ago tonight i was standing on this
[1:13:51] platform
[1:13:52] and there was a big chart and i was
[1:13:54] teaching
[1:13:55] all right everybody now this is what the
[1:13:57] holy spirit does perhaps and this is
[1:13:59] this and this is that we like that i
[1:14:01] like to teach
[1:14:02] there's times for teaching
[1:14:05] but that's what he was doing he was
[1:14:06] teaching
[1:14:07] and there's a little pentecostal group
[1:14:09] come from louisville and i never did
[1:14:11] believe in them people dancing the way
[1:14:13] that they did
[1:14:15] and there's a little lady come on
[1:14:17] out there and play the piano and they
[1:14:18] got to go
[1:14:20] to play a little special and beat on the
[1:14:22] little thimbles and the washboard
[1:14:24] i could just hear it
[1:14:29] just
[1:14:30] they got a little rhythm going
[1:14:34] all right and some of them beat on a tin
[1:14:36] can
[1:14:38] and i was very much of a critic of it
[1:14:41] and so i thought what's going on
[1:14:44] and the woman come up to play a special
[1:14:46] she got the plan
[1:14:47] and the lady got the beaten on the
[1:14:49] washboard and this little old blonde
[1:14:50] headed girl jumped up out of the floor
[1:14:52] and she began to dance in the spirits
[1:14:59] and me sitting there in the seat of the
[1:15:00] scornful
[1:15:03] and i said no i wish you'd look at that
[1:15:06] and i've been telling in my church until
[1:15:07] they was all wondering what i was going
[1:15:09] to do about it
[1:15:13] and i kept looking at her and i thought
[1:15:14] oh look at that now if that isn't
[1:15:17] something making a tavern out of my
[1:15:20] church
[1:15:25] i was sitting there not knowing any
[1:15:28] better i wasn't saying nothing but i in
[1:15:30] my heart i was thinking it
[1:15:33] and so i watched her there for a while i
[1:15:34] was dancing and the first thing you know
[1:15:37] i said now wait a minute i wonder if the
[1:15:39] ladies got any scripture for that
[1:15:42] folks i don't care what you talk about
[1:15:44] where you go what you think what you do
[1:15:45] you always ask that question
[1:15:48] is there a scripture for it
[1:15:50] how many believes that no matter what
[1:15:52] you do you think or what revel
[1:15:55] by the scripture
[1:15:57] and so that was good
[1:15:59] scripture for it not beginning to
[1:16:01] thinking about the scriptures and i said
[1:16:02] where where was dancing ever ordained
[1:16:06] that
[1:16:08] the first place in the bible and that's
[1:16:10] right and i thought well what made them
[1:16:12] dance not seeing that the children of
[1:16:14] israel when they crossed the red sea
[1:16:18] miriam
[1:16:19] looked back and seen all her task
[1:16:21] maskers grow
[1:16:25] take a look back this morning
[1:16:28] look at all those
[1:16:30] things that you don't have to battle
[1:16:32] with anymore
[1:16:34] look at smoking look at that drink and
[1:16:35] look at that whiskey drinking look at
[1:16:37] all those things you don't never have a
[1:16:39] problem with
[1:16:40] they're dead they're drowned
[1:16:47] folks it it's it's it's tough if you
[1:16:49] really got victory to stay quiet
[1:16:52] i don't know how people would do that
[1:16:53] just blow up if i didn't have a way to
[1:16:57] vent my feelings
[1:17:01] oh yeah let's get to the good part
[1:17:04] all the taskmasters drowned
[1:17:07] she picked up a tambourine
[1:17:09] and begin to dance
[1:17:13] oh my and beat this tambourine run down
[1:17:16] the shores just the dancing and all the
[1:17:19] daughters of israel
[1:17:20] following her dancing i thought that's
[1:17:24] victory
[1:17:27] oh my that's victory i seen david when
[1:17:31] his sweetheart sitting up there behind
[1:17:32] us here and fanning herself looking at
[1:17:35] her cute little boyfriend david standing
[1:17:37] out there and here come the ark
[1:17:40] amen like brother graham talked about a
[1:17:41] while ago come across the hill when
[1:17:43] david seen it coming he danced around
[1:17:45] and around and around why
[1:17:47] she said you embarrass me
[1:17:50] after a child never did have any
[1:17:52] children god didn't want any like that
[1:17:56] he says if you don't like that watch
[1:17:58] this
[1:17:59] and around and run around he went you
[1:18:01] know what god looked down from heaven he
[1:18:03] says david you are a man after my own
[1:18:05] heart
[1:18:07] i mean that's what god is if that was
[1:18:09] what that if god if david was like god's
[1:18:12] own heart then you
[1:18:14] what god likes for his children how many
[1:18:16] knows that god loves for his children to
[1:18:18] have exceeding great joy
[1:18:22] there's nothing that makes
[1:18:24] and the child is just as happy as they
[1:18:26] could be that's when the child mom and
[1:18:27] dad is happy when the children are happy
[1:18:32] they have joy in their life and that's
[1:18:33] what god wants this morning he wants you
[1:18:35] to have joy this morning i want to show
[1:18:36] you about god's help how did you have
[1:18:38] joy that okay
[1:18:41] now i'm telling you this this hits me
[1:18:42] it'll hit everybody i don't think
[1:18:44] there's anybody this message won't hit
[1:18:47] that it won't be a blessing to
[1:18:50] amen
[1:18:51] now notice
[1:18:53] oh my
[1:18:55] god look down says you're a man after my
[1:18:57] own heart that's right and i thought you
[1:19:00] know there's one thing
[1:19:02] that's the matter with me
[1:19:05] i haven't got enough victory
[1:19:09] are you with me this morning that's the
[1:19:11] problem
[1:19:14] because i don't believe in shouting
[1:19:16] put on
[1:19:18] i don't believe in screaming and acting
[1:19:19] no don't act
[1:19:22] just let it come from here
[1:19:24] they come here first and then let it
[1:19:26] come out
[1:19:27] because we're not here to
[1:19:29] uh
[1:19:30] impersonate
[1:19:32] act like something you're not i wanted
[1:19:34] to be real and genuine
[1:19:37] amen
[1:19:38] but he said maybe i just don't have
[1:19:40] victory and i got to sit in there and i
[1:19:42] got my old methodist foot
[1:19:49] oh when the sage go marching in
[1:19:53] when the state are marching
[1:19:57] listen to what he said he got nothing
[1:19:59] before the patent the first thing you
[1:20:01] know god is my judge before i know what
[1:20:04] was going on i was out there on the
[1:20:06] floor dancing around that girl
[1:20:11] you think i get out of order you should
[1:20:13] be around brother bannon for a little
[1:20:15] bit
[1:20:19] no
[1:20:20] not out of order
[1:20:22] dancing is not out of order
[1:20:24] shouting is not out of order screaming
[1:20:27] is not out of order amens are not out of
[1:20:29] order hallelujahs are not out of order
[1:20:32] that's what god loves god inhabits the
[1:20:34] praise of his people
[1:20:39] oh my
[1:20:41] first thing you know he was out there
[1:20:43] that's right
[1:20:44] that's right then i said god take me out
[1:20:47] of the old seat of the scornful and let
[1:20:50] me look at anything sensibly before i
[1:20:53] ever pass judgment anymore
[1:20:57] praise be to god
[1:20:59] aren't you glad for that
[1:21:02] so the third question i already answered
[1:21:05] but how does victory act
[1:21:12] that's what that victory acts like
[1:21:15] oh glory hallelujah it'll make your
[1:21:18] scream shout and everything else
[1:21:26] let me lie to you can i lie to you this
[1:21:28] morning
[1:21:32] what if i told you last sunday i was
[1:21:34] watching the football game i didn't
[1:21:35] watch it
[1:21:36] don't watch it don't really keep up for
[1:21:38] any more since they can't even stand for
[1:21:40] the national anthem yeah that's right
[1:21:44] but anyway
[1:21:46] and there's one certain team one
[1:21:50] and the
[1:21:51] those that lost were shouting and those
[1:21:53] that one were just not a peep out of
[1:21:55] them
[1:21:57] it would be a lie wouldn't it
[1:22:00] no it wouldn't be that way at all why
[1:22:02] they would come out of their bleach and
[1:22:03] just slap each other on the hand and
[1:22:05] scream and shout especially if it was
[1:22:07] the last play even though all they
[1:22:09] needed was three points
[1:22:13] or a a what is it the next point like to
[1:22:16] go in and mix it just by one point amen
[1:22:18] in that running back then he's heading
[1:22:20] from the 10 to the five he's getting
[1:22:22] beat back he keep
[1:22:28] take it in make it in
[1:22:30] huh
[1:22:32] and he comes over there and he just mad
[1:22:33] he gets hit he just falls down and he
[1:22:36] slams the football on that little corner
[1:22:38] pig and the empire says
[1:22:42] touchdown
[1:22:44] you think everybody would stay in their
[1:22:46] seats
[1:22:47] i guess that's pretty good
[1:23:04] you
[1:23:05] silly defense why couldn't our defense
[1:23:09] stop that guy
[1:23:10] you'd be disappointed
[1:23:12] the other guy were like yeah that's the
[1:23:15] way to whoop him that's the way to run
[1:23:17] through him that's the way to make it
[1:23:22] the losers would always say oh such
[1:23:24] fanaticism they're getting too carried
[1:23:26] away
[1:23:27] they have got too much emotion
[1:23:31] huh
[1:23:33] but i works in church sometimes
[1:23:35] i'm gonna get so happy in the spirit and
[1:23:37] those that don't knock knocks and
[1:23:38] they're just like
[1:23:40] he's just too emotional
[1:23:44] amen
[1:23:45] that is what victory looks like
[1:23:50] like by the day the harder the battle
[1:23:52] the sweeter the victory
[1:23:55] [Music]
[1:23:57] oh my we have to battle things sometimes
[1:23:59] for a lifetime
[1:24:02] years sometimes decades we battle things
[1:24:05] you know
[1:24:07] and it's all comes down to this one
[1:24:10] thing
[1:24:12] it's fighting your greatest enemy it's
[1:24:14] what you're doing your biggest enemy
[1:24:17] that you got
[1:24:19] is yourself
[1:24:22] you are your biggest enemy
[1:24:25] oh my
[1:24:27] trying to conquer that guy as a job
[1:24:32] oh he's a job i want you to know
[1:24:36] praise the lord but i may believe it can
[1:24:38] be done
[1:24:41] so much so that almost every time that
[1:24:43] jesus talked about if you come to him
[1:24:47] huh
[1:24:48] he never got to talking about the devil
[1:24:51] he got to talking about yourself
[1:24:53] [Music]
[1:24:55] huh
[1:25:02] he says if any man come after me he says
[1:25:04] you know he that loveth father mother
[1:25:06] more than me is not worthy of me he
[1:25:08] didn't love a son or daughter more than
[1:25:10] me is not worthy man he that think if
[1:25:11] not his own cross and followed after me
[1:25:14] is not worthy of me he that find us his
[1:25:16] life shall lose it
[1:25:19] how many believes that you've got to die
[1:25:20] to yourself
[1:25:22] you got to lose your own lives
[1:25:26] huh
[1:25:28] let me tell you something that's many
[1:25:30] times people will come to the place of
[1:25:31] suicide
[1:25:33] most a lot of times people will find god
[1:25:35] there
[1:25:36] because they're so miserable they're so
[1:25:39] tired of their life they don't want it
[1:25:40] anymore
[1:25:42] and they'll put a guy in their head and
[1:25:43] they'll blow their brains out
[1:25:46] but instead of doing that why don't you
[1:25:48] just fall down and surrender your life
[1:25:50] to god
[1:25:52] i'd say here i am i'm done with my life
[1:25:54] i'm completely surrendering to you i
[1:25:57] tell you what god can come to fill you
[1:25:59] with the power of god
[1:26:02] you'll never be the same again
[1:26:05] everybody has to come to the point of
[1:26:07] death
[1:26:08] everybody's gotta not just come to the
[1:26:10] point of but you've got to die to
[1:26:12] yourself
[1:26:13] if you're ever gonna have the power of
[1:26:15] the holy ghost if you're ever gonna have
[1:26:17] victory you gotta come to the death of
[1:26:18] yourself
[1:26:19] and
[1:26:20] completely surrender
[1:26:25] because you are going to surrender
[1:26:27] i mean those you are going to surrender
[1:26:29] the bible says nobody lives to himself
[1:26:31] nobody dies to himself you either live
[1:26:33] for god or you live for the devil if
[1:26:36] you're going to live for god you got to
[1:26:37] die to
[1:26:38] the devil and to yourself
[1:26:41] that's right
[1:26:43] every time
[1:26:44] what will a man get in exchange for a
[1:26:46] soul
[1:26:47] huh you got to make an exchange i mean
[1:26:50] please you got to give something
[1:26:52] you got to surrender something
[1:26:54] if you're ever going to have something
[1:26:56] from god
[1:26:58] oh my
[1:26:59] i was thinking about this and i was
[1:27:01] thinking about how that

[1:28:14] mean i don't even feel bad about it for
[1:28:16] the whole head up on the machine a
[1:28:18] little bit for a human maybe but machine
[1:28:20] no problem at all

[1:28:28] machine

[1:28:36] funny

[1:28:39] no i'm i'm using i i got confused i'm
[1:28:42] speaking through a a automated uh
[1:28:45] machine or something and
[1:28:46] i still hung up i just said i guess he
[1:28:48] was still a machine
[1:28:52] oh my
[1:28:53] but anyway y'all know what it's like
[1:28:56] you love the lord
[1:28:59] all right let's go let's have another
[1:29:01] story
[1:29:03] amen
[1:29:04] let's talk about
[1:29:06] how many beliefs have you got to
[1:29:08] surrender to god
[1:29:10] and and
[1:29:12] every aspect of our lives
[1:29:18] let me just let me just read you the
[1:29:20] last quote that came to my mind before i
[1:29:22] came out
[1:29:24] and i wrote it down here i'll go ahead
[1:29:26] and read it
[1:29:27] you will never
[1:29:30] be fully blessed
[1:29:32] until you fully surrender
[1:29:36] brahm he says you'll never be fully
[1:29:38] blessed until you
[1:29:40] fully obey
[1:29:42] right and obedience is surrender
[1:29:45] how many believes that
[1:29:47] to obey
[1:29:48] is to surrender
[1:29:52] in ephesians he says wives submit
[1:29:53] yourselves to your husbands
[1:29:55] for the husband the head of the uh wife
[1:29:58] is the husband the head of the man is
[1:30:00] christ right
[1:30:01] everybody has their order ephesians 5
[1:30:03] submitting submitting submitting
[1:30:05] yielding to
[1:30:07] amen
[1:30:09] children obey your parents servants be
[1:30:11] certain subject to your
[1:30:13] masters and everything and then paul at
[1:30:16] the end says finally be strong in the
[1:30:18] lord if you're completely submitted in
[1:30:21] the place that god wants you to be
[1:30:23] you will have the power of almighty god
[1:30:27] but you'll never do it we'll never do it
[1:30:29] until we look back in our lives
[1:30:32] amen and we see where those areas are
[1:30:36] that are not surrendered
[1:30:39] amen
[1:30:40] that are not surrendered to god
[1:30:43] and i had wrote down in here and since
[1:30:45] i'm in the 60s club now
[1:30:48] any of us that are in our 60s or older
[1:30:51] brother urban
[1:30:52] don't we look back don't we look back
[1:30:54] and see all the mistakes that we've made
[1:31:00] that's right you get a 20 20 hindsight
[1:31:03] after 60 you get 20 20 vision of your
[1:31:06] pass
[1:31:07] it begins to bear down on you
[1:31:10] huh
[1:31:11] and you begin to see the things that you
[1:31:13] wish you wouldn't have done
[1:31:15] the things that you wish wouldn't have
[1:31:16] happened
[1:31:18] you begin to see how you really are
[1:31:22] you begin to see
[1:31:23] where you're at with god
[1:31:26] you see your faults better when you get
[1:31:27] close to god this is not just for older
[1:31:29] folks hello
[1:31:32] but you begin to see where you have
[1:31:33] areas that are not surrendered to god i
[1:31:36] want to make a statement can i make a
[1:31:37] statement
[1:31:39] anything that the word of god says that
[1:31:40] you don't do is the undersurrendered
[1:31:43] part of your life
[1:31:47] don't expect the power of god don't
[1:31:48] expect the full blessings of god
[1:31:50] expect a lukewarm halfway mediocre
[1:31:54] mediocre so to speak kind of a christian
[1:31:56] life if it's not surrendered
[1:31:59] you are not going to get the blessings
[1:32:01] that you deserve that you could have
[1:32:03] if it was the other way
[1:32:05] and i believe it's time to get closer to
[1:32:06] god
[1:32:07] i believe it's time for a complete
[1:32:09] sunrenderer don't you
[1:32:11] amen so we find here that it comes and
[1:32:13] has to do with our life every aspect of
[1:32:17] our life
[1:32:20] amen
[1:32:22] all right let's talk about
[1:32:25] a story brother branham said
[1:32:28] he says i met a woman some years ago in
[1:32:31] a 10 cent store and she was about 60
[1:32:33] years old
[1:32:36] looked about 30 years old
[1:32:39] and i says how do you do sister
[1:32:41] she says well brother venom i've got two
[1:32:43] sons and that's darkness that's older
[1:32:45] than you are
[1:32:46] and honest to goodness she didn't look
[1:32:48] over 30 years old
[1:32:51] and she said well here's what it is
[1:32:54] when i come to christ and when i was
[1:32:56] about 12 years old i sat down and i
[1:32:58] thought about it i studied other
[1:33:00] religions but one well i found when i
[1:33:01] found the true one i come to christ and
[1:33:04] i gave him my case i gave him my soul my
[1:33:08] all to him
[1:33:12] and she says i never had a worry since
[1:33:17] said that he promised to take care of
[1:33:19] all my problems didn't say cause all
[1:33:22] your cares upon him
[1:33:25] he'll care for you
[1:33:28] yeah
[1:33:30] and she said
[1:33:32] if he's not big enough to do it
[1:33:35] then i know i'm not big enough to do it
[1:33:37] so what's the use of worrying about it
[1:33:40] see
[1:33:41] christ promised that he'd take care of
[1:33:42] all your cares
[1:33:44] catch your cares on him so what are you
[1:33:46] worrying about
[1:33:48] don't worry worry builds up pressure and
[1:33:50] pressure blows up so just cast your
[1:33:52] carries on him and quit worrying them
[1:33:54] amen
[1:33:56] in this he says this wasn't letting him
[1:33:58] off pressure he says you know
[1:34:00] you say well brother brandon he says i
[1:34:02] just want her brother around he says
[1:34:04] don't wonder
[1:34:06] how many knows well i wonder about that
[1:34:08] don't wonder
[1:34:10] i mean you ain't gotta wonder
[1:34:12] i wanted to don't wonder the words true
[1:34:14] the word is true god is right
[1:34:20] you just let jesus just let off the
[1:34:22] pressure commit your case to god and go
[1:34:25] on as if it was all over don't build a
[1:34:27] pressure it's gonna blow up if you don't
[1:34:28] amen
[1:34:30] how many believes that
[1:34:32] all so many of our troubles and cares
[1:34:35] and things that we battle with
[1:34:38] they're over
[1:34:40] when you completely
[1:34:42] surrender to christ
[1:34:44] the reason we still have battles like we
[1:34:45] do a lot of times is because we're not
[1:34:47] dead yet
[1:34:50] we are not
[1:34:51] dead yet
[1:34:53] because
[1:34:54] and let me say this that this goes in
[1:34:57] more of a it's not because you're not
[1:34:59] born again
[1:35:00] hello
[1:35:01] because a lot of us that are christians
[1:35:02] that have been many years in
[1:35:04] christianity who knows that you still
[1:35:05] have areas like that
[1:35:07] you know you still battle with things
[1:35:10] as a matter of fact a lot of us have
[1:35:11] weaknesses the protoband talked about we
[1:35:14] have that weak spot that weak link
[1:35:15] somewhere
[1:35:16] that you have to pray about
[1:35:19] right
[1:35:20] and that you have to overcome
[1:35:22] just like a young convert
[1:35:24] oh my i'll
[1:35:26] tell you what
[1:35:27] god brings us and he allows us to go
[1:35:29] through these battles to bring us to the
[1:35:31] death of ourselves we just can't do it
[1:35:33] no more
[1:35:35] because as long as you can try to do it
[1:35:37] you'll fail
[1:35:39] because we know that if god don't take
[1:35:41] something from you you're going to have
[1:35:42] it
[1:35:45] the only thing you can do is completely
[1:35:48] surrender it to god
[1:35:51] but if you're in the least little bit
[1:35:53] alive yet hello
[1:35:54] least little bit unsurrendered
[1:35:57] that's why let me say this this is
[1:35:59] another aspect of it to where you can go
[1:36:01] extreme with one way or the other but
[1:36:03] this is the balance of it is that even
[1:36:05] though you overcome these things as long
[1:36:07] as you're in this flesh how many of
[1:36:09] those that you'll still have a battle
[1:36:11] you'll still have to overcome you will
[1:36:13] have to die
[1:36:15] every day
[1:36:17] you will have to surrender
[1:36:19] every day
[1:36:21] isn't that right
[1:36:23] because if you don't surrender every day
[1:36:25] as long as this is here it's still
[1:36:27] bothering it's still going to try to
[1:36:28] come up
[1:36:30] but i let me say this i am convinced
[1:36:34] that if we have the spirit of god in us
[1:36:36] like
[1:36:36] romans 7 talks about our flesh it's weak
[1:36:40] that's we would not that we do so many
[1:36:42] times
[1:36:43] like brother brad says you know i'll be
[1:36:45] honest with you sometimes i don't want
[1:36:47] to come to church
[1:36:48] i'm the pastor and i'll be honest with
[1:36:50] you sometimes this don't want to go to
[1:36:51] church
[1:36:52] but i guarantee you if i've got a hot
[1:36:54] message or if i'm right with the lord
[1:36:56] where i should be i'm going to go to
[1:36:57] church
[1:37:00] it's because i am not surrendered like i
[1:37:02] should be because just the cares of life
[1:37:04] can get you that way from monday to
[1:37:05] wednesday
[1:37:07] hello
[1:37:08] but when you're surrendered i'll tell
[1:37:10] you when you're surrendered to the holy
[1:37:12] ghost the way that you're supposed to be
[1:37:16] a naked woman could come in front of you
[1:37:18] and you would turn your head
[1:37:20] huh
[1:37:26] which we know the prophet taught that a
[1:37:28] woman barely dressed is more sexy than a
[1:37:30] naked one
[1:37:32] naked one is just land it's just there
[1:37:33] you know
[1:37:34] but there's still something there
[1:37:36] covered up just a little bit that's what
[1:37:38] they do out there right
[1:37:39] they might as well run naked because
[1:37:41] they practically are anyway
[1:37:46] amen how many believes that you get the
[1:37:49] holy ghost it gives you the power to
[1:37:51] look the other way
[1:37:53] are you with me you get enough of the
[1:37:55] holy ghost it'll give you the desire to
[1:37:57] be with your brothers and sisters in
[1:37:59] church
[1:38:00] it'll give you a desire to learn more to
[1:38:02] get more of the word and
[1:38:05] advance in christ
[1:38:08] it's when
[1:38:10] we become unsurrendered
[1:38:12] in some part of our life
[1:38:14] amen
[1:38:17] i might as well i'm gonna do it anyway
[1:38:21] if i have two glasses i'm gonna say
[1:38:23] where's my pair of glasses put another
[1:38:24] one up
[1:38:26] welcome to 60.
[1:38:32] y'all needed that that's just to lighten
[1:38:33] you up what's coming amen
[1:38:35] praise be to god
[1:38:37] hallelujah
[1:38:39] just don't come out in my barn all right
[1:38:42] i have me a dancing shouting fit out
[1:38:44] there
[1:38:45] having me a good time in the lord amen
[1:38:48] tell you what makes you feel good
[1:38:52] you love the lord
[1:38:54] a daily how many believes it's a daily
[1:38:55] surrender
[1:38:57] because the first thing you know that
[1:38:59] prayer
[1:39:00] that you used to pray don't pray anymore
[1:39:02] in the morning
[1:39:03] that thought on the lord and that
[1:39:04] dedication runs away with you here if
[1:39:06] you aren't careful
[1:39:08] amen
[1:39:10] praise the lord
[1:39:13] i don't know about you
[1:39:17] but i want
[1:39:18] the dance of victory
[1:39:20] i want the shout of victory i want the
[1:39:24] joy of being so much in christ until i
[1:39:28] can rest
[1:39:29] from all of our labor
[1:39:32] i mean the bible says he
[1:39:34] who has entered into the rest has
[1:39:39] thank you ceased
[1:39:41] from all his labors
[1:39:44] it's not you doing it anymore
[1:39:46] it's him
[1:39:51] that's what we want
[1:39:56] what a bright hope you have
[1:39:59] what a bright future brother glenn
[1:40:02] what a bright future that you have
[1:40:06] you don't have to pierce your
[1:40:08] ears and
[1:40:09] do this nose and tattoo yourself up and
[1:40:12] look like a rooster
[1:40:15] or a chicken
[1:40:17] or paint your hair blue
[1:40:20] and let your heart get blue
[1:40:23] let your your world get blue
[1:40:26] to be empty and to end up in a burning
[1:40:29] lake of fire that's not your future your
[1:40:32] future get closer to god get more joy
[1:40:36] and eventually get the body change go
[1:40:39] into heaven and live trillions of years
[1:40:43] come on people that's way too quiet
[1:40:47] glory hallelujah that's your future
[1:40:52] what a thing you rejoice about
[1:40:58] but this is the quietest place for the
[1:41:00] grain you'll ever be
[1:41:01] amen in the lake of fire he's gonna be
[1:41:03] weeping away gnashing of teeth when you
[1:41:06] get to heaven it's gonna sound like
[1:41:07] thunder because the people are praising
[1:41:10] god and worshiping him and glorifying
[1:41:12] him because he
[1:41:14] was their victory
[1:41:17] [Music]
[1:41:23] that's right
[1:41:25] i like to start here brother john
[1:41:27] i like to start here
[1:41:30] [Applause]
[1:41:32] praising god worshiping the lord
[1:41:38] give him the honor the glory
[1:41:40] that's through him
[1:41:43] oh my
[1:41:45] i've got things i have to surrender yet
[1:41:48] can i say something
[1:41:51] usually when i say something i forget
[1:41:52] what i was about to say
[1:41:54] but maybe i'll remember it this time
[1:41:55] don't never say it can i say something

[1:41:59] told micah back there i told him i said
[1:42:01] sometimes i'm in that pulpit now i have
[1:42:03] a thought and i'll say can i say

[1:42:06] bread i have to talk about blood of
[1:42:08] jesus christ or something because i
[1:42:09] forgot it completely what i was going to

[1:42:31] to god
[1:42:33] that he wouldn't even want to break the
[1:42:35] speed limit
[1:42:37] he was so surrendered every aspect of
[1:42:39] his life
[1:42:41] that he wouldn't even break the speed
[1:42:42] limit
[1:42:44] huh
[1:42:45] folks i gotta pull my foot back all the
[1:42:47] time

[1:44:12] if you don't do what he said you're not
[1:44:14] surrendered
[1:44:16] you're not a complete christian
[1:44:21] you're kind of a halfway
[1:44:23] christian
[1:44:25] and i thought about when i said this

[1:44:49] victory in your life
[1:44:51] all right here we go here we go
[1:44:59] this is the part i want to get to on

[1:45:12] total complete prophet
[1:45:15] how many knows brother bam says that he
[1:45:17] was complete and total prophet but we
[1:45:19] also know that moses had a
[1:45:21] area yet
[1:45:23] didn't he
[1:45:24] called the temper
[1:45:26] and moses in all of his faults
[1:45:28] all of his failures
[1:45:31] his people got to go in but he didn't
[1:45:34] imagine a leader like that
[1:45:38] joshua and caleb and some of the
[1:45:39] children went in now the vast majority
[1:45:42] didn't right
[1:45:43] because they had disbelieved too many
[1:45:45] times
[1:45:47] but now joshua and caleb did but because
[1:45:49] that he had a temper and he smote the
[1:45:50] rock twice
[1:45:52] he wasn't supposed to smite the rock
[1:45:54] twice
[1:45:55] and so forth and and so forth he he
[1:45:57] didn't get to go in
[1:46:00] now he's saved and so forth but he
[1:46:01] didn't get to go into the promised land
[1:46:04] but he was surrendered just like samson
[1:46:07] i mean no samson was surrendered to god
[1:46:10] what can god do when a person
[1:46:11] surrendered well you could do like
[1:46:13] samson back in the old testament
[1:46:15] samson the public god said that he gave
[1:46:17] god his strength but he gave delilah his
[1:46:21] heart
[1:46:22] he loved delilah and delilah finally got
[1:46:26] to him way down there in his heart
[1:46:28] but he gave me strength to god and he
[1:46:31] could kill a thousand philistines he
[1:46:34] could kill ten or twenty thousand if the
[1:46:36] knee grows right he became invincible
[1:46:40] unstoppable
[1:46:42] full of the power of god
[1:46:47] as all i get older i get weaker but i
[1:46:50] want to be stronger
[1:46:51] and i want to be stronger in the lord
[1:46:53] how about you
[1:46:55] i want to be stronger in the lord i want
[1:46:57] more of the power of god in my life
[1:47:01] amen
[1:47:06] all right when god sends a man to do
[1:47:08] anything he completely equips him with
[1:47:10] everything he has need of how many
[1:47:11] believes that's true for our christians
[1:47:14] he's equipped you with everything that
[1:47:15] you have need of to be a complete
[1:47:17] christian
[1:47:19] not halfway not a lukewarm christian
[1:47:22] he put something if he's a preacher
[1:47:24] he'll put something in him to preach
[1:47:25] with if he's a teacher he'll put
[1:47:27] something in him to teach with
[1:47:30] if he's a prophet he'll put something in
[1:47:31] him to see visions with
[1:47:33] god always equips his man then just like
[1:47:36] you if you are a christian god don't
[1:47:38] make any halfway christians god makes
[1:47:40] complete christians
[1:47:42] i mean that's his desire
[1:47:44] is that every one of us is completely
[1:47:47] surrendered to the lord
[1:47:49] god don't make halfway preachers but a
[1:47:51] preacher can be halfway
[1:47:54] oh
[1:47:54] how many knows that god makes his
[1:47:56] children's christians but sometimes
[1:47:58] they're halfway christians but it's not
[1:48:01] god's intentions for them to be that way
[1:48:04] it's their own ways that got mixed up in
[1:48:07] the plan of god for their life i want to
[1:48:09] rephrase that it is some of their ways
[1:48:12] that are not yet surrendered to god
[1:48:15] is that all right
[1:48:17] some of your ways are still there their
[1:48:19] ways are not surrendering to god
[1:48:22] that's why
[1:48:23] oh i want to say thus saith the lord
[1:48:26] that's why you're not what you ought to
[1:48:28] be
[1:48:28] that's why i'm not what i ought to be
[1:48:30] because there's still some of my ways in
[1:48:32] there
[1:48:37] meaning to scream like
[1:48:39] that i don't believe it takes screaming
[1:48:40] to get that to you i believe i can
[1:48:42] whisper it
[1:48:44] but god help us to hear it
[1:48:46] one form or another let us hear it in
[1:48:48] here and down in our hearts
[1:48:51] that if you're not the kind of christian
[1:48:52] that you ought to be you still have a
[1:48:54] lot of uh defeats and so forth because
[1:48:56] there's areas in your life that's still
[1:48:58] not surrendered to god
[1:49:01] because god will have you victory over
[1:49:03] anything that comes your way
[1:49:05] if you're surrendered to god the way you
[1:49:07] should be
[1:49:08] there is nothing that you can't overcome
[1:49:10] there is nothing that you can't go
[1:49:11] through
[1:49:13] if you're completely surrendered to god
[1:49:15] but if you're not completely surrendered
[1:49:17] to god you'll blow up
[1:49:18] you'll lose it huh
[1:49:21] temptation will get you
[1:49:25] amen
[1:49:27] let me tell you something over in the
[1:49:29] previous age
[1:49:33] before leodycia
[1:49:35] i believe it was that god told that age
[1:49:37] he says and i will keep you from the
[1:49:38] hour of temptation
[1:49:42] huh
[1:49:43] let me tell you something about how many
[1:49:44] beings that we're in the hour of
[1:49:45] temptation
[1:49:47] we're in the hour of temptation
[1:49:49] pornography and everything that's out
[1:49:50] there is the hour of temptation
[1:49:52] man there's millions of dollars to be
[1:49:54] made that you're if you want to if you
[1:49:56] want to be a penny here or a millionaire
[1:49:58] you know there's all of that that you
[1:49:59] can go up
[1:50:00] the temptation of these things
[1:50:03] lust of the flesh the pride of life
[1:50:06] amen
[1:50:08] the hour of temptation is upon us
[1:50:10] if you want to overcome there's only one
[1:50:12] way
[1:50:13] that's to surrender
[1:50:14] submit yourself obey
[1:50:18] god
[1:50:19] amen
[1:50:22] okay
[1:50:27] it's their own ways it got mixed up in
[1:50:28] the plan of god it's why people are
[1:50:31] what is halfway
[1:50:33] half hot have cold
[1:50:35] there you go thank you it's lukewarm
[1:50:39] just kind of a halfway christian god
[1:50:42] will use whatever part you give him how
[1:50:43] he believes that he'll use whatever part
[1:50:44] to give him he's appreciative of it but
[1:50:46] he wants all of you
[1:50:48] he wants how many doors and door every
[1:50:51] door of your life
[1:50:55] he wants control he wants it all
[1:50:57] surrendered
[1:50:58] you didn't have business a lot of us
[1:51:00] have businesses
[1:51:01] right is that right
[1:51:03] he wants that business to rendered to
[1:51:05] god
[1:51:06] everything is above board everything's
[1:51:08] right
[1:51:09] that right
[1:51:11] and it doesn't take the place of god
[1:51:14] amen
[1:51:16] everything whether you're working for
[1:51:17] somebody whether you're a wife whether
[1:51:19] you're a child
[1:51:20] god wants you submitted he wants you to
[1:51:22] surrender
[1:51:23] amen submit yourselves one to another
[1:51:26] the bible says
[1:51:30] what the prophecies god say submit
[1:51:32] yourself to your pastor
[1:51:35] folks sometimes i i gotta tell people
[1:51:37] people that quit church or whatever
[1:51:39] sooner or later i gotta confront them i
[1:51:41] gotta talk to them
[1:51:43] if they're not going down the wrong way
[1:51:44] my job is to tell you you're not going
[1:51:45] the right way
[1:51:48] you can quit this church and you still
[1:51:49] live in this area i want to tell you
[1:51:51] something i'm still your pastor
[1:51:55] as long as god doesn't need to be here
[1:51:57] in this area i don't care i am your
[1:51:59] pastor
[1:52:02] think about it
[1:52:04] jesse bell elijah was
[1:52:07] her pastor whether she liked it or not
[1:52:09] [Music]
[1:52:10] oh my
[1:52:14] mine i did it i've done it listen
[1:52:16] this is your job not that you desire to
[1:52:18] be a drug i don't like to tell people
[1:52:20] stuff
[1:52:22] but oh my
[1:52:26] let me just say my sister
[1:52:29] some of that that was going on here in
[1:52:30] the church
[1:52:31] it got to the place where i couldn't
[1:52:32] hold my peace
[1:52:34] i had to go up there and confront him
[1:52:35] just tell them what it is how it is
[1:52:38] this got to stop
[1:52:40] did i want to no
[1:52:41] i had to when you see there's something
[1:52:43] that's wrong you see something brewing
[1:52:45] ain't right
[1:52:46] it comes in here
[1:52:48] what do you think sometimes i come out
[1:52:49] here and i say things it's kind of harsh
[1:52:53] folks if i didn't and i towered down
[1:52:55] because well that person that's got this
[1:52:57] is going to hit pays a lot of time they
[1:52:59] might leave
[1:53:00] huh
[1:53:02] if i did that you should vote me out
[1:53:06] that's right not
[1:53:08] fit to be up here what did brother
[1:53:10] braham say just comes to a moment he
[1:53:11] says a preacher amen that won't preach
[1:53:13] the truth will compromise for that he
[1:53:15] says he ain't he ain't worth it
[1:53:18] amen
[1:53:21] but how many is that i mean if we
[1:53:23] actually have that if we have a trustee
[1:53:25] board we have a deacon board we have a
[1:53:26] song that we have we have a church sense
[1:53:28] of god
[1:53:29] we ought to be the happiest people to
[1:53:31] know that he's not us it's god
[1:53:34] thank you jesus
[1:53:36] thank you lord
[1:53:38] there's no big eyes don't literally use
[1:53:40] it's all of us working together for the
[1:53:42] kingdom of god
[1:53:46] it's the fivefold how many knows god put
[1:53:47] the five-fold ministry in the church for
[1:53:50] what
[1:53:51] for the perfecting of the saints
[1:53:55] you think you don't have to have a
[1:53:56] pastor
[1:53:59] if you won't submit to a god-ordained
[1:54:01] pastor you are not submitting to god
[1:54:04] don't try to tell me that you are
[1:54:10] you're lying
[1:54:14] god's not going to say well i told you
[1:54:15] to listen to him but you ain't got to
[1:54:17] just listen to me
[1:54:19] that make him a liar
[1:54:21] because he said to listen to it
[1:54:23] now he says you don't have to huh
[1:54:25] god's not like that
[1:54:27] he's perfect isn't he
[1:54:30] god equips us how many believe it
[1:54:33] now notice moses he had made him a
[1:54:35] complete prophet for a complete
[1:54:37] deliverance and moses was completely
[1:54:40] surrendered into the hands of god that's
[1:54:42] the reason that it made him what he was
[1:54:44] he was so completely in god till god
[1:54:46] could trust him
[1:54:49] oh my god could trust him
[1:54:52] i wonder this was going to be my closing
[1:54:54] argument
[1:54:56] argument i'm not a lawyer here but
[1:54:59] this is going to be my closing statement
[1:55:01] amen
[1:55:06] let me hold off on this and read another
[1:55:08] one would that be okay
[1:55:10] it's where brother emma's talking about
[1:55:12] how that we make excuses for our
[1:55:14] weaknesses right
[1:55:15] well i'm just not able i'm not worthy
[1:55:18] i'm not this out of the other that's
[1:55:20] where you got to get to before god could
[1:55:21] ever use you
[1:55:27] he says we take these excuses and say
[1:55:29] well i can't do this and i'm
[1:55:31] insufficient god takes that very thing
[1:55:33] to do the job with
[1:55:34] that's what he chooses to do it with
[1:55:37] because before god can use you you got
[1:55:40] to become nothing a nobody
[1:55:43] dead to
[1:55:44] yourself the important thing one of the
[1:55:48] important things that we
[1:55:50] must
[1:55:52] master
[1:55:54] master
[1:55:56] how many please you guys there's things
[1:55:57] that the christian has the master you
[1:55:58] gotta master it remember this
[1:56:01] and especially you young preachers and
[1:56:03] land members alike there's one thing
[1:56:05] that you've got to master if you expect
[1:56:07] to fulfill god's desire
[1:56:10] in your
[1:56:12] life that's so precious to me this
[1:56:14] morning isn't it to you to know
[1:56:17] what god has said if you really want
[1:56:21] god's desire to be fulfilled in your
[1:56:24] life we all do don't we
[1:56:26] i want god's desire to be fulfilled in
[1:56:29] my life this is what you must do
[1:56:32] and that is you have to master
[1:56:35] human
[1:56:37] ability
[1:56:41] human
[1:56:42] ability
[1:56:46] all of us many of us
[1:56:48] we have seen people who put their hands
[1:56:50] into things and try to make it this way
[1:56:53] and make it that way
[1:56:55] what do you have
[1:56:56] chaos
[1:56:58] god's not in it at all
[1:57:01] folks if there's something that you just
[1:57:02] can't do nothing about what do you do
[1:57:06] you don't do nothing you commit it to
[1:57:08] god
[1:57:09] but other people are not like that if
[1:57:10] there's nothing they can do about it
[1:57:12] they'll do something else they'll keep
[1:57:14] trying stuff
[1:57:15] keep making it worse
[1:57:18] oh we're getting down home now aren't we
[1:57:23] until it's a complete nightmare and it
[1:57:26] does nothing but destruction it is not
[1:57:27] god
[1:57:29] it is satan
[1:57:31] not your human ability folks i have
[1:57:34] learned when i can't do anything about
[1:57:35] it
[1:57:36] put it in god's hands
[1:57:39] as a matter of fact i got to get to the
[1:57:40] place brother to where it's not me
[1:57:42] trying to do something about it
[1:57:44] say lord
[1:57:45] you see it you see what this is
[1:57:48] huh
[1:57:49] and as a pastor sometimes i let things
[1:57:51] go a little long
[1:57:54] people in church how can you let this go
[1:57:55] on how can you did you say that in the
[1:57:57] other
[1:57:58] huh
[1:57:59] how about paul's she had somebody follow
[1:58:02] him for a long time
[1:58:04] huh they said get rid of her do this
[1:58:05] together he waited for the right time
[1:58:09] you have to wait for the holy spirit to
[1:58:11] do it
[1:58:13] because if i do it i'm going to tell you
[1:58:14] off
[1:58:16] i'm going to really give it to you lay
[1:58:18] you down and
[1:58:19] cut you up and throw you out and spit
[1:58:21] you out that's what thomas byler would
[1:58:22] do
[1:58:24] but the holy spirit comes he says things
[1:58:26] in a nice way that's the truth and it's
[1:58:28] hard and it's cutting but it's with love
[1:58:30] so that it can be received
[1:58:35] how many believes that
[1:58:37] bringing correction one thing that
[1:58:38] pastor has to do is bring correction
[1:58:40] with love
[1:58:42] because if it's not with love
[1:58:43] some of y'all already know what that's
[1:58:45] like
[1:58:47] because i've done it
[1:58:48] and i've had to repent let's not bring
[1:58:50] that up again shall we
[1:58:52] it's under the blood
[1:58:54] but it's truth
[1:58:57] sure
[1:58:57] the thing about a pastor in the
[1:58:59] congregation is we're not going to be
[1:59:01] perfect until we get out of here
[1:59:04] huh
[1:59:05] none of us are going to be perfect if
[1:59:07] you expect to follow a perfect leader
[1:59:09] huh
[1:59:11] well you're just in for a real shock
[1:59:13] not going to happen
[1:59:15] folks by god's grace god shows me where
[1:59:17] my weaknesses are he shows me where my
[1:59:19] faults are
[1:59:22] does he you
[1:59:24] i know the areas i need to surrender do
[1:59:26] you know i thought about the altar call
[1:59:28] this afternoon
[1:59:29] it is afternoon after 12.
[1:59:32] to give us a moment
[1:59:34] to think back
[1:59:35] look back
[1:59:37] look at yourself
[1:59:38] look at your areas that you know that is
[1:59:40] unsurrendered
[1:59:42] wouldn't that be good to have a little
[1:59:43] altar call this money
[1:59:45] let me finish first shall we
[1:59:48] we must master the thought of human
[1:59:51] ability
[1:59:55] we've got to master that in such a way
[1:59:57] that we can get rid of that thing
[2:00:01] and lay it aside so that god can use us
[2:00:04] and make a complete
[2:00:06] surrender
[2:00:08] we cannot use one ability we've got to
[2:00:10] make
[2:00:11] a complete
[2:00:13] surrender
[2:00:15] and to come to god you've got to
[2:00:17] surrender to him both soul and body and
[2:00:21] spirit i believe that every part of you
[2:00:24] has to be surrendered
[2:00:26] to almighty god
[2:00:30] everything that you are has to be
[2:00:32] surrendered to god in order that he can
[2:00:34] work his will in you
[2:00:37] and in me now that's hard
[2:00:40] i know
[2:00:42] because we're always wanting to put our
[2:00:45] part in
[2:00:51] in the truth
[2:00:52] well i think
[2:00:55] well but i think
[2:00:57] get about five men together in a circle
[2:00:59] and talk about a subject what do you
[2:01:00] think well i think this the other one
[2:01:02] well i think that well i think this well
[2:01:04] i think that well i think that may be a
[2:01:06] little bit different we all have our
[2:01:09] input
[2:01:11] but thanks be to god that i am a
[2:01:13] preacher that says
[2:01:15] let this mind be in you that was also in
[2:01:18] christ jesus paul said that ye be
[2:01:22] like-minded
[2:01:25] how do we do that brother glenn
[2:01:27] by coming to an agreement
[2:01:30] my id ain't no good your idea ain't no
[2:01:33] good
[2:01:34] this is the idea
[2:01:36] this is where we meet this is where we
[2:01:38] come to well what does the word say
[2:01:41] about it
[2:01:42] amen
[2:01:44] then we can be one
[2:01:47] amen
[2:01:48] y'all are starting to wear down
[2:01:51] it's already 20 after
[2:01:53] only 20 after
[2:01:59] here i am
[2:02:00] that's my fault i looked at the clock
[2:02:02] you didn't i'm the bad guy i'm not
[2:02:04] supposed to be watching the clock amen
[2:02:08] a complete surrender
[2:02:10] all right
[2:02:19] i'm going to skip that one
[2:02:22] and go to the last one
[2:02:24] let me look over my notes i haven't
[2:02:26] looked really at him yet but i want to
[2:02:27] look at him
[2:02:29] make sure that i didn't really miss
[2:02:31] something i really want to speak on
[2:02:36] i don't think we'll sing that but it's a
[2:02:38] song that says perfect submission
[2:02:41] perfect delight
[2:02:42] all is at rest
[2:02:44] how many wants to live there i want to
[2:02:45] live there
[2:02:46] perfect submission perfect delight all
[2:02:48] is at rest
[2:02:52] i'm thankful
[2:02:54] some of us
[2:02:55] we don't have the problem but tommy can
[2:02:57] testify of how long it is
[2:02:59] that he hasn't smoked
[2:03:01] huh
[2:03:03] others said we could say well i've come
[2:03:05] over this i've overcome that and it's
[2:03:06] been so long and i've had no battle with
[2:03:08] it praise be to god
[2:03:10] how many believes that we can get more
[2:03:12] and more of ourselves so surrendered to
[2:03:14] god that we don't battle with some of
[2:03:16] these things that we do
[2:03:19] and then when you get to that place
[2:03:20] remember daily
[2:03:22] don't let it slip back because your
[2:03:23] flesh will want to slip it back
[2:03:26] huh
[2:03:27] where was i was somewhere
[2:03:31] it was at the dollar store
[2:03:33] and i come in there and they played my
[2:03:35] favorite rock and roll
[2:03:40] when i was out in the world there was
[2:03:41] certain music that was like my favorite
[2:03:43] i really liked that
[2:03:45] and they played and they come across
[2:03:47] here in my flesh
[2:03:52] you hear that
[2:03:54] that used to be pretty good
[2:03:56] that's what the flesh wanted to say
[2:03:59] but my soul says block that out
[2:04:02] huh block that out die to yourself you
[2:04:05] don't enjoy that anymore that don't
[2:04:07] sound good anymore
[2:04:09] huh
[2:04:10] daily die
[2:04:12] surrender
[2:04:13] paul said bring every thought that comes
[2:04:15] into your mind captive to the word of
[2:04:17] god when something comes in when the
[2:04:19] devil gives you a certain thought block
[2:04:21] it out right there surrender right there
[2:04:23] and you won't have any trouble with it
[2:04:25] because brother bam talked about how
[2:04:26] that our flesh i mean those sacha
[2:04:28] perfect man tempers patience memory
[2:04:30] reasoning all of that works in here you
[2:04:32] let one of those open the devil jump
[2:04:34] right in there and he'll go down there
[2:04:36] and root and take your victory from you
[2:04:39] temptation it'll take you so far and man
[2:04:41] if you lead to temptation it'll take you
[2:04:44] and it'll bring forth death amen
[2:04:47] you won't have joy rob you and all those
[2:04:50] places that's what i'm trying to say
[2:04:51] this morning you have to surrender every
[2:04:54] day
[2:04:55] amen
[2:04:58] praise be to god
[2:05:00] and let me just tell you this you know
[2:05:02] with what brother danny was talking
[2:05:03] about he says
[2:05:04] no matter how many times you fall you
[2:05:06] get back up
[2:05:08] i've been there i know what that's like
[2:05:10] and that's exactly what you do
[2:05:12] you keep on going
[2:05:13] you don't think you're a son of god you
[2:05:15] don't feel like a son of god you get
[2:05:17] back up and believe you're son of god
[2:05:18] again huh
[2:05:22] and keep trying keep laboring
[2:05:25] until you manage to whip yourself
[2:05:27] and you manage to actually yield and
[2:05:29] surrender yourself to god
[2:05:32] i believe it'll happen don't you
[2:05:34] i believe it happens
[2:05:36] amen but
[2:05:37] bless god
[2:05:39] brother sister johnny bless god the day
[2:05:42] that you overcome that faith
[2:05:44] praise be to god the victory when you
[2:05:47] actually overcome it you ain't got to
[2:05:49] deal with it anymore but everybody said
[2:05:51] it's like a jet going through a sound
[2:05:52] barrier right
[2:05:54] man every nut will creak and crack in
[2:05:56] the wings feed like shimmy or shake and
[2:05:59] everything but all of a sudden boom
[2:06:04] glory
[2:06:05] a lot of us have that testimony one day
[2:06:07] i come to the other and boom it was all
[2:06:09] done
[2:06:11] huh that's how it's supposed to be what
[2:06:14] they got just takes it off and then it's
[2:06:16] free sailing
[2:06:18] you have rest
[2:06:21] i'm glad that's over with i'm glad i'm
[2:06:23] done with that
[2:06:25] amen
[2:06:27] and every one of us
[2:06:29] has a little something somewhere i
[2:06:30] believe this morning
[2:06:32] maybe some bigs man i don't know what it
[2:06:34] is
[2:06:35] i don't care if it comes down to your
[2:06:36] speed limit
[2:06:38] huh
[2:06:39] i'll be the first confess that's you
[2:06:40] know
[2:06:41] little bitty you say little bitty no it
[2:06:44] wasn't to the prophet
[2:06:47] you know
[2:06:48] god said draw
[2:06:50] nigh unto me
[2:06:53] and i will draw an eye to you
[2:06:56] how many beliefs he's there and it's not
[2:06:58] his fault that we're not closer than we
[2:07:00] are it's ours
[2:07:02] if you want to get closer to god you're
[2:07:04] going to have to do the drawing you're
[2:07:05] going to have to say god this is not an
[2:07:07] area that i want in my life this is a
[2:07:09] bad place in my life
[2:07:12] now emily that's what we come to search
[2:07:14] for is fine
[2:07:15] are bad places
[2:07:17] so that we can go out here like brother
[2:07:19] joe's prayer believes a better person
[2:07:21] will we come in
[2:07:23] amen
[2:07:24] that's what i desire i believe god so
[2:07:26] what god's teaching and telling us
[2:07:31] in closing i wonder this morning as
[2:07:33] christians
[2:07:34] now notice the last one that i stopped
[2:07:36] before my closing
[2:07:38] quote he was so complete in god till god
[2:07:41] could trust him i wonder this morning as
[2:07:43] christians if we have yielded our own
[2:07:46] will yield ourselves so completely to
[2:07:49] god
[2:07:50] till god could trust us to a place that
[2:07:52] he has put us
[2:07:54] i wonder this morning of myself i like
[2:07:58] that preacher that preaches to himself
[2:08:00] even the prophet of god
[2:08:03] if i could be so yielded to god to god
[2:08:06] could trust me huh
[2:08:09] with giving me
[2:08:11] the spoken word
[2:08:14] say to that couple that's been kissing
[2:08:16] and sloppering over each other on the
[2:08:17] front pew and won't quit when you ask
[2:08:20] him two or three times get reason to get
[2:08:22] upset you have reason to be angry
[2:08:25] now say whatever you want to that couple
[2:08:28] that it'll be
[2:08:31] if it had been ananias sapphira
[2:08:34] the hands that carried your husband out
[2:08:38] are here to carry you out
[2:08:41] boom she fell down
[2:08:43] and died
[2:08:47] brother branham
[2:08:48] what did he say looked at him
[2:08:52] god i don't know i don't think he told
[2:08:54] him i don't know if he told him sure or
[2:08:55] not god told me whatever i say to you
[2:08:57] will be
[2:09:01] folks
[2:09:03] that'd be enough to make me pass out i'd
[2:09:05] die right there somebody told me that
[2:09:08] oh my lord i'm gonna die
[2:09:11] huh
[2:09:12] that reason to be scared out of their
[2:09:14] wits but
[2:09:16] he says and i forgive you
[2:09:18] i forgive you for that
[2:09:21] maybe
[2:09:22] brother tommy maybe we'll get to see the
[2:09:23] video on that
[2:09:25] the youtube on that
[2:09:28] of what their faces looked like after he
[2:09:30] forgave him the continents of their
[2:09:33] faces
[2:09:35] to realize they have been spared death
[2:09:39] maybe they came to the altar and
[2:09:40] repented i don't know
[2:09:42] it doesn't say that they did but still
[2:09:44] they should have is that right
[2:09:47] but brother brandon was at a place that
[2:09:49] god he was so surrendered that god could
[2:09:52] trust him
[2:09:53] with the spoken word
[2:09:56] elijah didn't do so well
[2:09:58] and they made fun of his bald head
[2:10:00] i cursed you kids in the name of the
[2:10:02] lord
[2:10:04] right
[2:10:06] and she bears come and ate him because
[2:10:07] god honors his prophet's word
[2:10:12] amen can he trust you
[2:10:15] can he trust you with that kind of power
[2:10:19] myself so you looked he could trust me
[2:10:22] brother neville could trust our trustee
[2:10:24] board
[2:10:25] our deacon board
[2:10:26] because how many knows that we're in a
[2:10:28] position like that you have power
[2:10:33] if you have any of your own abilities
[2:10:36] you do anything in yourself you will
[2:10:38] bring chaos
[2:10:41] a pastor the same way
[2:10:44] i get in my flesh i will cause chaos
[2:10:49] troubles
[2:10:51] god help me never
[2:10:53] i wanted to have a little more time but
[2:10:56] paul and this is something i have felt
[2:10:58] in my heart that i feel in my heart
[2:11:00] because even brother brown said he had
[2:11:02] this fear
[2:11:03] he had this fear i mark this when fear
[2:11:06] is okay sometimes it's good to be have
[2:11:08] fear if it's the right of her kind of
[2:11:11] fear
[2:11:12] fear god and keep his commandments paul
[2:11:14] said i come to you in fear and in
[2:11:16] trembling and in weakness
[2:11:18] motherboard said that was because he was
[2:11:20] afraid that he would end up doing
[2:11:22] something in himself
[2:11:24] something of his own ability
[2:11:27] or maybe he's put a stumbling block in
[2:11:29] somebody's way we as christians should
[2:11:31] be afraid that we do something that
[2:11:33] isn't right that puts a stumbling block
[2:11:35] in somebody's way how many is with me
[2:11:38] or it helped me to be a good example so
[2:11:40] that those that see what i do can follow
[2:11:42] in those footsteps
[2:11:44] you should be afraid of what you do you
[2:11:46] should fear be scared that you're gonna
[2:11:48] do wrong you should be scared that
[2:11:51] you'll do something in yourself and get
[2:11:53] on your knees and say god help me to
[2:11:55] stay surrendered don't let me do
[2:11:57] anything in myself
[2:12:00] trusted trees trustee board deacon board
[2:12:03] our members of our church we all have a
[2:12:05] place
[2:12:06] and we've got a
[2:12:08] duty
[2:12:09] amen
[2:12:14] brother bam talks if this church
[2:12:16] believes in a certain thing or group we
[2:12:18] should not compromise if the church
[2:12:19] believes that we should not gamble then
[2:12:21] that member should never touch a deck of
[2:12:23] cards we don't believe in drinking he
[2:12:25] should never he should turn his head
[2:12:26] completely from drinking if we do not
[2:12:28] believe in gambling or smoking the
[2:12:29] member of this church should never touch
[2:12:30] a thing like that god
[2:12:32] gives complete
[2:12:35] deliverance
[2:12:38] and he will do it if we will completely
[2:12:40] surrender ourselves
[2:12:43] and if we will completely deliver
[2:12:45] ourselves
[2:12:46] into his hands
[2:12:48] then god can live on us
[2:12:50] the hope of glory and he can reflect
[2:12:53] himself from us
[2:12:54] as we get ourselves
[2:12:57] out of
[2:12:58] the way
[2:13:00] amen
[2:13:04] you love the lord
[2:13:17] i'm just praying about this last thing
[2:13:19] here
[2:13:24] amen i feel to stop there
[2:13:26] well stop there stand to our feet
[2:13:39] let's do that
[2:13:42] look at your life
[2:13:45] those areas that the sweet holy spirit
[2:13:48] talks to you
[2:13:53] you do things that you know you
[2:13:55] shouldn't do
[2:14:00] you don't come up to the word of god the
[2:14:01] way that you should
[2:14:04] see i'm not the prophet or i could tell
[2:14:06] you exactly who it is and what it is
[2:14:09] but i do know that god is right here
[2:14:12] he knows your mind he knows your
[2:14:14] thoughts
[2:14:15] he knows what you're thinking he knows
[2:14:17] what your problem is or where
[2:14:20] you
[2:14:21] lack
[2:14:22] where
[2:14:23] your bad place is
[2:14:29] think about it look at yourself
[2:14:33] and you know while we're looking at
[2:14:34] ourself
[2:14:36] even the prophet says you got to be
[2:14:37] careful about looking at yourself it's
[2:14:39] pretty depressing and you won't get
[2:14:40] nowhere you got to look to calvary
[2:14:43] but before you can fix something you got
[2:14:44] to see what the problem is
[2:14:48] as you look at yourself and you realize
[2:14:50] you're not where you ought to be
[2:14:52] in this area i'm not where i ought to be
[2:14:59] i remember your members
[2:15:01] and i wanted these closed eyes and so
[2:15:03] forth i want to say this yet
[2:15:06] that is
[2:15:07] brother brown talked about he says we
[2:15:09] have tapes on this on the conduct of the
[2:15:11] church and how that we ought to assemble
[2:15:13] ourselves together and
[2:15:15] meet with one another and
[2:15:17] he says you know
[2:15:19] come together and fellowship one with
[2:15:20] another and he makes the statement he
[2:15:22] says don't
[2:15:24] stay
[2:15:25] home
[2:15:28] and i know we have an internet here and
[2:15:29] so forth and i know because of the
[2:15:31] pandemic are held early they want need
[2:15:33] to be safe and i don't have a problem
[2:15:34] with that and so forth but when you've
[2:15:36] got perfectly healthy people that won't
[2:15:38] come on wednesday
[2:15:40] won't come on they just stay at home but
[2:15:42] so lazy perhaps
[2:15:45] that they won't get off their pillow or
[2:15:46] won't get out of their recliner and go
[2:15:48] to church
[2:15:49] when the prophet said
[2:15:51] don't stay home
[2:15:54] if god is in your heart you can't wait
[2:15:56] for those doors to open
[2:15:59] to get out there and to fellowship with
[2:16:00] your brother and your sister let me say
[2:16:02] this sure it's easy it's so lazy so easy
[2:16:06] to sit in a recliner and be in church
[2:16:10] all i have to say to somebody that could
[2:16:11] be a church like that and isn't you
[2:16:15] are lukewarm
[2:16:19] and what does god do with somebody
[2:16:20] that's lukewarm he doesn't want he spews
[2:16:23] it out
[2:16:24] god is not pleased
[2:16:26] that when you can be in church and
[2:16:28] you're not
[2:16:31] it's lukewarmness it's halfway you did
[2:16:33] good you put it on it on and i listened
[2:16:35] to a preacher but you wasn't
[2:16:37] hot enough to get up out of your chair
[2:16:40] and go to church
[2:16:42] let the people know that you love the
[2:16:44] lord
[2:16:47] maybe it's that maybe it's just in that
[2:16:48] area or somewhere else in some other
[2:16:50] aspect let me tell you church
[2:16:53] i as your pastor i want people
[2:16:56] that can
[2:16:58] if you can be home wednesday night you
[2:17:00] need to make it a habit
[2:17:02] four o'clock to nine o'clock is god's
[2:17:05] time he gives you all the way from
[2:17:07] sunday afternoon to wednesday to four
[2:17:09] o'clock but let that be god's time
[2:17:12] make time for god we make him for sunday
[2:17:15] morning most of us
[2:17:19] that's good we give god that but we have
[2:17:21] a wednesday night service
[2:17:24] if you can be
[2:17:25] you should be show god
[2:17:29] that you're real serious
[2:17:31] about drawing closer to him
[2:17:33] i understand the sickness if you're sick
[2:17:35] or something but people that are feeling
[2:17:37] well and doing well but just too lazy to
[2:17:39] come i rebuke that in the name of jesus
[2:17:41] christ
[2:17:43] you're not where you should be and
[2:17:45] you're not doing
[2:17:46] what the prophet said do what the bible
[2:17:49] said do
[2:17:50] that you ought to be in church
[2:17:53] now let's just leave that and think
[2:17:55] about other areas in your life this
[2:17:56] morning
[2:17:58] that's not surrendered
[2:18:00] and when you surrender remember
[2:18:03] when one military takes over another
[2:18:05] military they say now i want you to
[2:18:07] march over this way i want you to come
[2:18:08] to here or go to there
[2:18:10] this morning
[2:18:12] if you're not surrendered you want to
[2:18:13] completely don't do it unless it's with
[2:18:15] all your heart completely surrender
[2:18:18] every aspect of your life the way that
[2:18:20] the prophet said we should why don't you
[2:18:22] step out of your seat and come forward
[2:18:24] saying i'm coming up and standing before
[2:18:26] christ so to speak
[2:18:28] let everybody know that i'm surrendering
[2:18:30] my life this morning i have areas in my
[2:18:32] life that's not surrendered and i am
[2:18:34] surrendering them now

[2:18:43] with you
[2:18:45] there's little areas still things that
[2:18:47] god's working on that i need to
[2:18:49] surrender i'd be a happier person if i
[2:18:51] just would
[2:18:53] you'd be a happier person if you just
[2:18:55] would if you just surrender those places
[2:18:57] that steal yourself your ability your
[2:19:00] carnality if you just surrender you'd
[2:19:02] have so much more of the holy ghost
[2:19:03] you'd have so much more of god you'd
[2:19:05] have so much more joy
[2:19:07] this is your chance this morning to
[2:19:09] raise your hands up now and say god i
[2:19:11] surrender
[2:19:13] to you
[2:19:14] i surrender to you
[2:19:21] lord jesus now you see us
[2:19:23] the international
[2:19:25] sign of surrender lord is to raise our
[2:19:27] hands we're taking our hands off
[2:19:31] of our life we're giving it to you lord
[2:19:34] we come to you this morning we bring our
[2:19:36] burdens we bring our cares to you lord
