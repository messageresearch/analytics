[39:58] man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with
[40:01] power and great glory and he shall send
[40:04] his angels with a sound of a trumpet and
[40:06] they shall gather together his elect
[40:08] from the Four Winds from one end of
[40:10] Heaven to the other now learn the
[40:12] parable of the Fig Tree when his branch
[40:14] is yet tender and putteth forth for
[40:16] leaves know ye that summer is nigh so
[40:19] likewise ye when you shall see the
[40:21] things know that it is near even at the
[40:24] doors verily verily I verily I say unto
[40:27] you this generation shall not pass till
[40:29] all these things be fulfilled Heaven and
[40:32] Earth shall pass away but my words shall
[40:34] not pass away may God add His blessings
[40:36] to the reading of the words you can
[40:37] proceed it
[40:39] tonight I want to say first of all
[40:41] something that the prophet said many
[40:43] times and that is that this is the hour
[40:46] right
[40:47] now of all the of all of time he said
[40:52] this is the greatest hour
[40:57] this is the greatest hour and of course
[41:00] if you say that you might ask well
[41:01] brother B why is this the greatest hour
[41:05] of course we know that it's because this
[41:08] is when amen it's going home
[41:12] time is that right it's time to go home
[41:15] it's reunion
[41:17] time Resurrection time amen it's time
[41:22] when uh things are wrapping
[41:25] up it's the end of time and the
[41:28] beginning of
[41:31] Eternity amen amen and we all understand
[41:34] brother brandom thought that it would be
[41:36] over with by
[41:39] 1977 so where we are in
[41:41] 2024 amen and maybe just a little bit
[41:46] sluggish we might just be a little bit
[41:48] sluggish about how late it really
[41:51] is
[41:56] amen amen amen but you know thing of it
[42:00] is and the thing about prophecy is
[42:04] prophecy when something said is kind of
[42:07] like a warning Ain that right it's
[42:10] telling you what's
[42:11] ahead and it ain't no man it ain't all
[42:15] these different philosophers and
[42:16] different ones that do the predictions
[42:18] it's God telling you what's in the
[42:20] future amen and in that Amen in that you
[42:25] can do two things you can believe it and
[42:27] get ready for it or you can be
[42:31] unprepared ain't that right you'll be
[42:33] one or the other you'll be prepared for
[42:35] what lays ahead or you'll not be
[42:37] prepared because just as sure as the
[42:40] world the end is
[42:43] coming the fire is going to
[42:48] fall everybody as you know that's left
[42:51] will be
[42:53] burned it's going to be a horrible thing
[42:58] it's going to be unlike anybody could
[42:59] have ever
[43:00] imagined Ain that right and as I begin
[43:03] to think about this I think about
[43:06] Humanity as a
[43:08] whole you think about our politics you
[43:11] think about our governments and what
[43:13] their goals is and and what uh let me
[43:17] see how I've got it put here
[43:20] amen what is the accomplishment what has
[43:26] Humanity
[43:29] accomplished where has man
[43:32] gone what have we ever
[43:34] done ain't that right well if you want
[43:37] to see what we've done just look
[43:42] around look at where we going look at
[43:44] what really the Pinnacle so to speak of
[43:47] humanity the greatness of
[43:52] humanity where is
[43:55] it it's pitiful
[43:58] condition people that don't know who
[44:00] they are what they are people running
[44:03] around with blue hair and tattoos and
[44:05] every which way and just completely
[44:07] crazy that
[44:10] right so it hasn't gone any far they
[44:14] really haven't done anything but yet how
[44:16] many knows there is a end goal for
[44:21] Humanity there is an accomplishment for
[44:25] Humanity and all ultimately when it's
[44:28] all said and
[44:29] done
[44:31] amen people don't realize people don't
[44:34] realize first of all what it's all
[44:39] about do they they don't really realize
[44:43] what it's all
[44:45] about most of them think that the
[44:48] achievement and the accomplishment of
[44:50] humanity
[44:52] perhaps is to become like a what Elon
[44:55] Musk or whatever Ain that right
[44:58] are these guys that got the richest in
[45:00] the
[45:07] world
[45:09] Amen Trump even different ones worth
[45:11] billions of
[45:13] dollars but come to find out that's
[45:15] really nothing
[45:17] either Ain that right that really
[45:19] doesn't get you anywhere
[45:21] either can you imagine having a billion
[45:24] dollars and taking a bullet into ear
[45:26] because because you want to try to do
[45:29] something help
[45:31] America knowing that you was that far
[45:34] and if it would have been for the grace
[45:35] of God you wouldn't be
[45:39] here huh so apparently his billions of
[45:43] dollars doesn't
[45:46] satisfy that right it's not sat it
[45:49] doesn't
[45:51] satisfy and we have to be careful folks
[45:53] it's not about how much money that we
[45:55] have in the bank how much money we make
[45:57] it's nice it helps here but don't let
[45:59] that be your
[46:03] achievement it's got to be another
[46:05] achievement and I One mean to say this
[46:07] and we realize and know one thing that
[46:09] there is only two powers in the universe
[46:13] only
[46:14] two and humanity is subject to one power
[46:18] or the
[46:20] other you led by one power or the
[46:25] other amen now let me get started we've
[46:27] got quite a few good things here we want
[46:29] to try to bring out with the help of the
[46:30] Lord and we started first of all with uh
[46:33] with talking about the parable we know
[46:34] that the fake tree brother Braham said
[46:36] was of course Israel a that right so we
[46:39] one see one end time prophecy fulfilled
[46:42] amen and we know that the generation
[46:44] that sees Israel becoming a nation that
[46:47] Nation will not pass away is that
[46:51] right because Jesus said verily verily I
[46:53] say unto you this generation shall not
[46:56] pass till all these things be
[47:00] fulfilled so we are in the last
[47:07] generation we need to remember
[47:12] that we're about to uh perhaps elect
[47:15] that woman that brother bam talked about
[47:18] I've got prophecies I want to bring out
[47:19] for
[47:21] that
[47:24] amen amen
[47:27] and we'll get into that for just a
[47:29] little bit in a little bit but that's
[47:31] the one the one thing that's been full
[47:33] we realize of course that Malachi
[47:36] 4 and you know I can just go ahead and
[47:39] and say these things and and say well we
[47:42] know this we know that but if anybody's
[47:44] out there listening I really like to
[47:46] have a scripture ain't that right let's
[47:48] read the scripture that way if
[47:49] somebody's out there listening
[47:54] amen they'll actually have a scripture
[47:56] for for it
[47:59] amen Malachi 4 says behold the day
[48:02] cometh that shall burn as and oven so
[48:05] we're promised to fire aren't we that's
[48:08] right and all the proud y all not just
[48:13] half of them all that do wickedly shall
[48:17] be
[48:20] stubble what did Brother Brenham see
[48:22] I'll tell you here in a minute and read
[48:24] it to you America burnt over nothing but
[48:26] Stomp and everything blowed up they
[48:28] shall be
[48:31] stubble all this politics and all this
[48:34] other stuff it's going to get blowed up
[48:37] it's all going to
[48:38] burn it's all going to be done
[48:43] with and the day that cometh shall burn
[48:46] them up sayith the Lord of hosts and
[48:48] it'll leave them neither root nor Branch
[48:51] but unto you that fear my name shall the
[48:53] son of righteousness arise with healing
[48:56] in his will Wings amen how many believes
[48:58] he's done that and ye shall go forth and
[49:01] grow up as calves of the stall I just
[49:04] want to say this because it came in my
[49:05] mind as I was studying that the most
[49:07] important part about any of our lives
[49:10] right now is how that you are growing
[49:13] and maturing in Christ that's all that's
[49:17] important that's the most important
[49:20] thing for any of us is that we are
[49:22] getting ready for a
[49:25] translation that's why what we're
[49:27] getting ready for we're ready getting
[49:29] ready to meet the master that's what
[49:31] we're still here for and we're still
[49:33] waiting for that last name to be
[49:35] redeemed that last name to come to
[49:38] Christ and when that happens we're going
[49:40] to get out of
[49:43] here
[49:48] amen people like money isn't that what
[49:52] everybody all the politicians prominis
[49:54] them a good life and know more money and
[49:57] oh my we're going to vote this one out
[49:58] because you know they you know it's so
[50:00] much harder this that or the other you
[50:02] know it's all about your self
[50:05] existence is that what it's all about no
[50:07] that's not what it's all about amen
[50:11] people are so self-centered as brother
[50:13] brandham said uh the people just uh
[50:17] unconcerned Amen Let Me Go on that's
[50:20] right shall grow up as calves of the
[50:22] stall and ye shall Tre down the wicked
[50:25] for they shall be ashes under the soils
[50:28] of your feet in the day that I shall do
[50:30] this sayeth the Lord how many knows
[50:32] Revelations 19 him and the bride after
[50:35] tribulation period we're going to come
[50:37] back ain't that right and walk on the
[50:39] ashes of the
[50:48] wicked better start walking if you're a
[50:51] Christian you better start walking one
[50:53] of these days there's going to be ashes
[50:54] under your hold you your feet where it's
[50:57] all
[50:59] burnt so now what's
[51:02] important let me tell you something
[51:04] what's important is not now but it's
[51:06] what's coming after about where are you
[51:09] going to spend eternity that's what's
[51:13] important whether you're going to go to
[51:15] heaven or whether you're going to go to
[51:17] hell because you will go to one or the
[51:19] other
[51:20] place just as sure as God took his
[51:23] picture and Vindicated himself a
[51:24] thousand times over there is a God that
[51:27] you everybody's going to answer to Isn't
[51:30] it nice to be able to Proclaim that
[51:31] nobody getting the way with nothing
[51:33] every action every thought you ever
[51:35] thought amen is recorded and it'll be
[51:37] played back to
[51:41] you amen but aren't we glad Brother Brad
[51:45] that there is an eraser for the
[51:47] Christian there's a leader for the
[51:49] Christian amen when they confess their
[51:51] sins amen it goes into a
[51:55] deletion amen
[51:57] the devil could try to pull it up
[51:58] anybody could try to pull he's going to
[52:00] say you know he's there's no
[52:01] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[52:03] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[52:06] after the spirit no condemnation it's
[52:08] all
[52:11] gone I hope there's some sitting in here
[52:14] amen that know what I'm talking about
[52:16] amen and if you know what I'm talking
[52:18] about it means something to you to know
[52:20] that your sins are forgiven dear
[52:24] gone thank you Jesus
[52:27] that's right thank you
[52:28] [Applause]
[52:30] Jesus praise be to God cuz you can have
[52:33] them going on before unto judgment or
[52:36] you can wait till
[52:38] after amen and not only will you have be
[52:40] judged and have to suffer the wrath of
[52:42] almighty God but then you'll have to be
[52:44] judged then cast into the Lake of Fire
[52:47] that's right trust me it isn't going to
[52:49] be
[52:53] pleasant amen as I was saying money and
[52:57] everything and I meant to pull up but I
[53:00] know at one time I heard of all the deer
[53:02] Nation series you know how many most
[53:04] nations are deader nations in other
[53:07] words they're inde
[53:08] dead very few that are
[53:12] not
[53:13] amen so that all that doesn't mean so
[53:17] much now notice remember ye the law of
[53:20] my servant Moses I commanded him in the
[53:22] up and all Israel with the
[53:24] statutes and judgments behold beh I will
[53:27] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[53:30] coming of the great and Dreadful day of
[53:33] the
[53:34] Lord amen how many knows that John the
[53:37] Baptist came and he was proclaiming
[53:40] Christ's coming the acceptable year of
[53:43] the Lord this is the Dreadful day of the
[53:46] Lord a different day how many knows that
[53:50] has been fulfilled there he is right
[53:52] there that's the Elijah that this Bible
[53:55] talked about God himself came and had
[53:58] his picture taken with him in the midst
[54:01] of a critic that had all kinds of things
[54:03] he tried his best to take pictures and
[54:05] with his finger up is that right and
[54:07] that's the only one that came out none
[54:10] of them other else came
[54:12] out amen why could God was with
[54:16] him that's right there's your Elijah the
[54:19] Prophet come and gone and he says
[54:22] whenever you hear of a prophet being in
[54:24] the line you better head up judgment is
[54:27] on the
[54:28] way brother Bram talked about uh uh
[54:31] France and all of those that were wine
[54:33] women and everything else and the
[54:34] temporary judgment because they turned
[54:36] the gospel down of John Smith and and so
[54:39] forth all of those preachers and they
[54:40] had a temporary judgment and the wrath
[54:41] of Hitler came down on them and
[54:43] everything else all I can say is where's
[54:48] ours we had a mighty a propit than uh uh
[54:51] Martin Luther John Wesley or any of them
[54:54] much greater and look what they did

[55:00] lukewarm is that right he said I behold

[55:04] happened right around
[55:06] 1963 when even to Pentecostals and
[55:09] everybody would say look if you go to
[55:10] brother B meetings where Jesus is there
[55:12] Discerning the thoughts and intents of
[55:14] the heart doing the sign of the Messiah
[55:16] something only God can do will
[55:19] excommunicate you they turned him down
[55:23] and he was on the

[57:39] partake of her
[57:41] plagues amen because you partake in her
[57:44] sins
[57:46] amen for as the days that were before
[57:49] the flood they were eating and drinking

[57:53] until the day that Noah entered into the
[57:55] ark
[57:57] amen and knew not until the flood came
[58:02] and took them all away so shall also the
[58:05] coming of the son of man be amen so as
[58:09] it was in the days of Noah how many

[58:14] says it grieved God that he made man
[58:15] there was constantly violence people had
[58:18] become violent and the imagination of
[58:21] his heart and thought was only evil
[58:23] continually that's what it is today
[58:26] every thought that people think it's
[58:28] only evil
[58:29] continually would somebody mind thinking

[59:44] if the Goodman would have if the house
[59:46] would have known and what watched the
[59:47] watch th would have come he would have

[59:51] house to be broken in how many believes
[59:53] that you and I are not of the dark we're
[59:55] not of the night
[59:57] we don't sleep with the drunken we are
[59:59] aware we're watching we know that it's
[1:00:02] in this hour that he comes so how many
[1:00:05] believes it's important that you
[1:00:07] understand that this is the time if you
[1:00:08] ever watch watch

[1:00:32] ever did or not I don't think they did
[1:00:33] but it went past
[1:00:36] 977 but remember he predicted that he
[1:00:39] didn't prophesy
[1:00:42] that
[1:00:45] amen if he'd have prophesied that I
[1:00:48] wouldn't have made
[1:00:49] it because I wasn't in at that
[1:00:52] time amen

[1:01:14] God okay all right we won't go into this
[1:01:17] I want to go into some of these other
[1:01:19] things but know this that if somebody
[1:01:21] says well Mighty Lord layth his coming
[1:01:24] and shall begin to Smite his fellow
[1:01:25] fellow servants and eat and drink with
[1:01:27] the drunken amen so if you get in your
[1:01:29] heart well we've heard it and heard it
[1:01:32] and heard it and heard it and heard it
[1:01:34] and heard it and I don't know you know I
[1:01:36] just better uh kind of take care of
[1:01:39] myself sure you plant your potato sure
[1:01:42] you take care of yourself but don't you
[1:01:43] get the attitude that the Lord you know

[1:02:16] servant into outer Darkness thou shall

[1:02:26] completely blacked out cuz why the
[1:02:27] brides gone there will be weeping
[1:02:31] wailing and nashing of
[1:02:35] teeth nashing of teeth what's going to
[1:02:37] cause them what's going to hurt that
[1:02:39] bad
[1:02:41] amen gonna be bad how many believes
[1:02:45] it now let's go to Revelations
[1:02:48] Revelations
[1:02:53] 13 and we understand through the prophet
[1:02:56] of God that he identified America in the
[1:02:59] 13th chapter of Revelation he said
[1:03:01] America started with 13 uh colonies 13
[1:03:05] stripes and stars and all these
[1:03:07] different things that was 13 isin't that
[1:03:08] right and we find America rising up in
[1:03:11] the 11th verse of chapter 13 and I
[1:03:14] beheld another Beast coming up out of
[1:03:15] the earth and it had two horns like a
[1:03:17] lamb and it spake as a dragon and he
[1:03:19] exercise all the power of the first
[1:03:21] Beast before him and causes the Earth
[1:03:23] and them which dwell therein to worship
[1:03:25] the first Beast whose deadly wound was
[1:03:28] healed and he doeth great wonders so
[1:03:31] that he maketh fire to come down from
[1:03:32] heaven of on the earth in the sight of
[1:03:35] men amen I don't know just what that is
[1:03:38] but I do know that whether it was
[1:03:40] Germany or Japan even before the nuke
[1:03:42] they would burn almost whole cities that
[1:03:46] napon and stuff they've burned more
[1:03:48] people more civilians and you can
[1:03:49] imagine and then the big ball fire ain't
[1:03:52] that right certainly was a lot of fire
[1:03:55] to come down and deceiveth them that
[1:03:57] dwell on the Earth by the means of those
[1:03:58] Miracles which he had power to do in the
[1:04:00] sight of the Beast saying to them that
[1:04:01] dwell on the earth that they should make
[1:04:03] an image unto the Beast which had the
[1:04:04] wound By The Sword and did live we know
[1:04:07] that was cath Catholic Roman Catholic
[1:04:09] isn't that right going from Ro Pagan
[1:04:11] Rome to Papa Rome amen changed it over
[1:04:15] and its deadly wound was healed and he
[1:04:17] had power to give life unto the image of
[1:04:19] the Beast notice the big beast the first
[1:04:21] Beast has power to give life to the
[1:04:23] image image of the Beast that the image
[1:04:26] of the Beast should both speak and cause
[1:04:28] that as many as would not worship the
[1:04:30] image of the Beast should be killed and
[1:04:32] he causes all both small and great rich
[1:04:34] and poor free and bond to receive a mark
[1:04:37] in their right hand or in their
[1:04:39] foreheads and that no man might buy or
[1:04:41] cell save he that had the Mark or the
[1:04:43] name of the Beast or the number of his
[1:04:45] name here is wisdom let him that has
[1:04:48] understanding count the number of the
[1:04:49] Beast for it is 600 the number of a man
[1:04:52] and his number is 6003 score and6 if
[1:04:55] anybody don't know on the crown of the
[1:04:57] pope is vicarious which means uh uh
[1:05:01] instead of the instead of the Son of God
[1:05:03] vicarious Phil and mean you take all of
[1:05:06] those R numerals and it comes up to
[1:05:09] 666 so the number the Beast is the
[1:05:14] pope
[1:05:17] amen now in the tribulation period you
[1:05:19] say something like that and you're
[1:05:21] liable to get drove out of your
[1:05:24] church amen
[1:05:26] I wouldn't doubt a bit but the time will
[1:05:28] come you better watch what you
[1:05:29] say Amen remember brother Brandon when
[1:05:32] he was preaching he says you know you
[1:05:34] know they've got guns on me he says I
[1:05:36] believe for this that I'm talking about
[1:05:38] the Beast and even he says I'll probably
[1:05:40] pay for it with my life one day but
[1:05:41] that's all right I won't go until God
[1:05:43] calls me is that right so oh they're
[1:05:47] they're ferocious there's two evils let
[1:05:48] me say there's two evils in the
[1:05:50] world and and this is just me but two
[1:05:53] most evil things that I know of and that
[1:05:55] is that that
[1:05:56] Catholicism Catholicism is as wicked and
[1:05:59] as bad as they
[1:06:00] get don't you ever think Catholicism
[1:06:03] holy they killed 68 millions in the most
[1:06:05] brutal horrible way you could ever
[1:06:07] imagine amen and in order for you to
[1:06:10] maybe be spared if they told you to kiss
[1:06:13] the crucifix if you kissed it you might
[1:06:16] live because you did their bidding you
[1:06:18] bowed to what they wanted you to
[1:06:20] do we're going to get right down to the
[1:06:22] nitty-gritty tonight man find the whole
[1:06:25] purpose of man and what what it's really
[1:06:27] all about the whole thing in a nutshell
[1:06:29] what it comes right down to
[1:06:34] amen because like I said earlier there's
[1:06:37] only two Powers God's power and Satan's
[1:06:40] power and remember Satan's motive and
[1:06:44] his
[1:06:45] objective was to be worshiped like
[1:06:49] God his whole goal the whole nutshell
[1:06:53] the whole thing about the devil is he
[1:06:55] wants you to worship
[1:06:57] him let me tell you that's far from
[1:07:01] falling down and say oh devil we worship
[1:07:03] you we worship you we worship no it's
[1:07:05] far from that as a matter of fact
[1:07:08] Catholicism don't mind if you have a
[1:07:09] church or
[1:07:10] whatever they used to you ain't need
[1:07:13] nothing but Catholic but now anybody
[1:07:15] that comes up there bows before the pope
[1:07:18] kisses his ring that's worship hello
[1:07:22] submits himself to them he's good good
[1:07:26] with that right isn't they aren't they
[1:07:30] even going as far as blowing our minds
[1:07:32] to uh uh blessing LGB and all that stuff
[1:07:37] blowed my mind I'd have thought they
[1:07:38] didn't never Sloop that low but did
[1:07:42] it
[1:07:45] amen and then the image of the Beast the
[1:07:47] next one that's so bad is the image of
[1:07:49] the
[1:07:53] Beast and the image of the Beast is the
[1:07:56] confederation of churches it's the
[1:08:00] denominations now brother Bram and I'll
[1:08:03] I I hope I have time yall got plenty of
[1:08:05] time I want to read you about those
[1:08:07] churches because it makes you look like
[1:08:09] those conf churches are of Confederate
[1:08:12] together and they'll make well if you
[1:08:13] don't belong to this church and and and
[1:08:16] and you come to our standards and all
[1:08:18] that stuff that you won't be able to do
[1:08:20] anything but I'll tell you I believe
[1:08:21] it's a little bit more slick than that a
[1:08:23] little more tricky than that
[1:08:27] now I do believe it'll be the
[1:08:28] Confederation churches but let me just
[1:08:31] show you something so now listen to this
[1:08:34] brother bam is saying he's somebody
[1:08:36] asking about the mark of the beast being
[1:08:37] in the forehead or in the hand brother
[1:08:39] bam speaks listen don't you believe
[1:08:42] they'll tattoo a number on your head or
[1:08:44] tattoo it on your hand no sir don't look
[1:08:46] for that at all amen it'll be a
[1:08:51] boycott no man could buy or sell unless
[1:08:53] he belongs to the confederation of
[1:08:55] church churches am in the image of the
[1:08:57] Beast remember they have the World
[1:09:00] Council of churches Catholic means
[1:09:02] Universal World Council of churches
[1:09:04] that's Universal also amen that's true
[1:09:08] he says they'll come like a
[1:09:11] union unionizing the thing is that
[1:09:15] right bringing it down unionized
[1:09:20] religion Union is bring it together to
[1:09:22] one ain't that right how many how
[1:09:25] believes that this is uniting sign and
[1:09:27] time this is uniting time the Terrors
[1:09:31] they're going to unite they're going to
[1:09:32] bundle together and the wheat they're
[1:09:35] going to be bundled together amen
[1:09:37] they're going to be taken to the Garner
[1:09:39] but they're going to bind the bundles
[1:09:41] together and that's what's happening in
[1:09:43] front of your eyes and in front of my
[1:09:46] eyes
[1:09:49] amen notice it ain't far off brother Ben
[1:09:53] I and you'll see it she's just around
[1:09:55] the corner well I believe we've turned
[1:09:57] that
[1:09:58] corner and beam was preaching on the
[1:10:00] darkest hour then Jesus comes and he was
[1:10:02] talking about the disciples being out in
[1:10:04] that darkness in that boat and Jesus
[1:10:06] come when all hopes was gone and then
[1:10:08] after he says that all of a sudden he
[1:10:10] jumps into this he says now I'm going to
[1:10:13] say something here it's not a Doctrine
[1:10:15] I'm just prophesying you know what's
[1:10:17] happened it's going to come to a place
[1:10:19] soon mark my word that all denominations
[1:10:21] are going to have to join The ecumenical
[1:10:24] council and if they don't they can't
[1:10:25] have the support of the council
[1:10:28] therefore there'll be a boycott that
[1:10:29] nobody can go to these churches or go to
[1:10:32] any churches unless you have a mark from
[1:10:34] your own church and you or you cannot
[1:10:36] buy or
[1:10:37] sell remember the church AE book he says
[1:10:40] to come a time when that squeeze comes
[1:10:42] when that time of the squeeze comes that
[1:10:44] yeah you know people are they're going
[1:10:46] to take your
[1:10:48] privileges
[1:10:50] amen privileges will be taken your
[1:10:53] rights will be taken isn't that exactly
[1:10:55] what's happening in the political
[1:10:58] world now notice just as it was so is it
[1:11:01] going to be the church will realize and
[1:11:03] that's the spiritual people now he says
[1:11:05] you Pentecostal I put message people
[1:11:07] listen anyhow you recognize it you begin
[1:11:09] to feel it amen he says now what are you
[1:11:13] going to have to be you're going to have
[1:11:15] to forfeit your Evangelical teaching of
[1:11:18] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're
[1:11:19] going to have to have forfeit your
[1:11:21] doctrine of the Bible he says and the
[1:11:23] members is not going to stand for it
[1:11:25] real Born Again Christians will die
[1:11:28] first they're warned by the word and
[1:11:31] they know this things
[1:11:33] coming
[1:11:34] amen now notice and isn't it strange
[1:11:38] that right in this darkest of hours then
[1:11:41] Jesus comes along and calls them said
[1:11:44] don't be scared it's me I'm still with
[1:11:47] you I'm here to manifest my word now
[1:11:50] notice how he says that even right after
[1:11:52] this quote that he just read am me
[1:11:54] talking about it's going to be a dark
[1:11:57] hour
[1:11:59] amen and no doubt no doubt but a lot of
[1:12:02] us thinking in our political
[1:12:07] realm of how bad it's been and what
[1:12:09] they've done in the last four years that
[1:12:11] uh you know that they certainly wouldn't
[1:12:13] vote for something like that again and
[1:12:15] we understand that uh camela has now uh
[1:12:18] uh what was it the governor of
[1:12:21] Minnesota is that right and from what I
[1:12:23] understand he's very liberal
[1:12:26] he thought that those riots wow that's
[1:12:28] just uh you know it's awesome it's
[1:12:29] pretty
[1:12:30] exciting having all those riots they had
[1:12:32] back in 2020 and the city burning and
[1:12:34] everything
[1:12:35] else we know that in the past and they
[1:12:38] thought everybody was talking now the
[1:12:40] media is going to try to paint camela as
[1:12:42] a moderate because moderates have a used
[1:12:45] to have a lot better chance of
[1:12:47] winning but now not only they prove that
[1:12:50] she's by far he's the they say she's the
[1:12:52] worst extreme leftist anybody ever was
[1:12:55] now the maybe the running mate would be
[1:12:57] a little more conservative to try to get
[1:12:59] some more on their side but no they go
[1:13:01] all the way both of them very very very
[1:13:04] liberal very on the left side and
[1:13:06] according to the poll she's
[1:13:11] ahead and we know that you can see in
[1:13:14] her uh Gatherings and so forth it
[1:13:16] doesn't compare to Trump not even
[1:13:20] close amen so you and I knowing the
[1:13:23] scriptures and the prophecy that brother
[1:13:25] B A made let me read that prophecy first
[1:13:27] can
[1:13:32] I now notice picking up the other
[1:13:37] day picking up the other day let me see
[1:13:40] what it is here
[1:13:41] now she he said I was reading some of
[1:13:44] these things that the Lord had told
[1:13:45] foretold already come to pass remember
[1:13:48] brother bam about Hitler and and
[1:13:50] musolini and the battle they have and
[1:13:53] Germany would give them a hard time but
[1:13:54] they'd over come all those things that
[1:13:56] were prophesied and whenever
[1:14:00] um what was his name that went into
[1:14:04] Ethiopia musolini when musolini he said
[1:14:06] when musolini goes into Ethiopia know
[1:14:09] that there will never be peace on Earth
[1:14:12] until Jesus returns that's what he said
[1:14:16] amen now
[1:14:18] notice and about the war how it would
[1:14:20] come out and those things just two
[1:14:23] things left of those Prophets phes
[1:14:25] brother bam says two things one of those
[1:14:27] great prophecies is for cars to be on
[1:14:29] the road with remote control egg likee
[1:14:33] only you don't drive it it controls
[1:14:35] itself and then there'll be a great
[1:14:36] woman rise up come because America is a
[1:14:39] woman's Nation a great woman will rise
[1:14:42] up and be present or something like that
[1:14:44] in the nation
[1:14:49] Amen Let me uh before I read the rest of
[1:14:51] that I want to go down back to the cars
[1:14:54] a little bit
[1:14:56] notice I said it'll come to pass that in
[1:14:57] those days that cars will not be run by
[1:15:00] a steering wheel it'll be something
[1:15:02] another run uh them cars they're
[1:15:05] bringing out right now remote control
[1:15:08] for safety correct you won't be able to
[1:15:10] enter into the city then in a 20 M Zone
[1:15:13] you can just go 20 miles you can't hit
[1:15:16] one another another car because it's
[1:15:17] remote control see going like that now I
[1:15:20] understand somebody Brother David has
[1:15:22] said you know that when you put that on
[1:15:24] remote control you can take your hand
[1:15:25] off it for a while can't
[1:15:27] you jerk you over off the left lane and
[1:15:30] if it sees a car it'll slow you down and
[1:15:34] all kinds of stuff so we're already
[1:15:36] seeing the remote control thing in a
[1:15:39] great way so how many knows that's the
[1:15:41] sign of the
[1:15:43] end scripture prophecy being
[1:15:47] fulfilled amen
[1:15:55] and then a great woman will rise up to
[1:15:57] be present or something and then there
[1:16:00] will
[1:16:01] come I always wondered even preaching up
[1:16:04] here a few weeks ago I he seen so far
[1:16:06] he's seen it burned burned over but here
[1:16:09] listen to what he says he says and there
[1:16:12] will come a total
[1:16:14] Annihilation the entire nation will be
[1:16:16] wiped
[1:16:17] out amen and I pr predict this I'm not
[1:16:21] saying thus sayith the Lord but I
[1:16:23] predict it'll be total an anation before
[1:16:26] 77
[1:16:29] amen see I didn't know that there is
[1:16:32] something that could annihilate it I
[1:16:34] just seen the other day where they said
[1:16:36] three bombs three of Russia's bombs
[1:16:38] could make America
[1:16:40] uninhabitable amen like they got now but
[1:16:43] I seen the nation in total Annihilation
[1:16:46] just stumps and trees and things like
[1:16:48] that that's the only thing that was left
[1:16:51] so it's on its
[1:16:52] Road it's on its Road
[1:16:56] and I said remember at that day before
[1:16:58] the end time comes there be there comes
[1:17:02] that
[1:17:03] woman now you all keep this wrote down
[1:17:06] there'll be a great powerful woman
[1:17:12] rise how many know she's not
[1:17:15] powerful in 2020 she ran to be president
[1:17:17] and she got three% of of votes for a
[1:17:20] primary just 3% hardly anything nobody
[1:17:24] wanted her
[1:17:25] but now look how she's rose up to power
[1:17:28] she rose up either be president or
[1:17:31] dictator or some great powerful woman in
[1:17:33] this United
[1:17:35] States what does Trump keep saying what
[1:17:38] do we all
[1:17:40] know that if Trump don't
[1:17:42] win I'll tell you this for my part I
[1:17:45] don't look forever to be a Republican
[1:17:47] president again
[1:17:51] ever I heard one of the
[1:17:55] it was one of one of uh it was a
[1:17:57] republican can't Lindsey Graham is it
[1:18:00] Lindsey Graham I think few years ago he
[1:18:02] said talked about you know if if they
[1:18:04] don't get it there won't be no
[1:18:05] Republican ever uh voted in again so if
[1:18:10] he doesn't it would be holding true what
[1:18:12] he said back
[1:18:14] then
[1:18:17] huh because as you see if they can do
[1:18:21] this and you know most of the people you
[1:18:23] see the majority of the people people
[1:18:25] they they don't want we don't want they
[1:18:26] don't want to keep going this
[1:18:28] way
[1:18:29] no but as we
[1:18:32] know they'll they if they if if they do
[1:18:35] they'll get it in somehow they'll get it
[1:18:37] in somehow and we'll know that you know
[1:18:40] what's going on now listen and listen so
[1:18:44] you and I no doubt are are hoping we're
[1:18:46] praying that it'll be a republican it'll
[1:18:48] be Trump I hope you know
[1:18:56] and to think to me when you found out
[1:18:59] that hey Biden I remember another one I
[1:19:02] I'm just GNA take my time I hope yall
[1:19:04] got time
[1:19:08] tonight somebody said you know there
[1:19:10] ain't no way way back said there ain't
[1:19:12] no way that Biden's going to be
[1:19:14] nominated ain't no way they all said
[1:19:16] what do you mean what do you mean what
[1:19:17] do you mean and guess what even months
[1:19:19] and months ago and they were right that
[1:19:22] right
[1:19:25] and just when you heard that it was
[1:19:28] camela that they picked isin that right
[1:19:31] didn't that do something for you down
[1:19:33] there because in our hearts in my mind
[1:19:35] ah she'll never win maybe she won't it
[1:19:38] may not be her at all I don't
[1:19:40] know but I do know that there's prophecy
[1:19:43] that it's going to be a woman raised
[1:19:46] up ain't that
[1:19:48] right and back to my thought about what
[1:19:50] Trump says and we all say and and we
[1:19:53] know he says look if we don't win this
[1:19:55] election America is
[1:19:58] finished ain't that the
[1:20:00] truth it's
[1:20:02] finished because anybody get can put up
[1:20:05] with this and the inflation and the way
[1:20:06] that it's going and then all vote for
[1:20:08] that some more oh let's have some more
[1:20:10] of
[1:20:12] that
[1:20:14] no something ain't right of course we
[1:20:17] know people's mind ain't right we
[1:20:20] understand
[1:20:21] that but this is what he said about it
[1:20:25] he says some great powerful woman is
[1:20:27] United States and she'll sink under the
[1:20:31] influence of that woman remember that he
[1:20:34] says that's thus saith the
[1:20:43] Lord so what do we do we got our heads
[1:20:48] up amen how many's got their heads up
[1:20:51] we're looking we're looking because
[1:20:53] right after the woman what what happens
[1:20:55] next total
[1:20:58] Annihilation
[1:21:00] amen now let me reach you another one
[1:21:03] this is talking about when he was
[1:21:04] talking about that we type Jezebel and
[1:21:06] Ahab isn't that right then one day after
[1:21:09] sin had take its toll and God has
[1:21:10] brought his people on their knees
[1:21:12] Jezebel took everything she wiped it all
[1:21:16] up and she'll do it again that's thus
[1:21:19] says God's holy Bible she'll do it again
[1:21:22] she's right on the throne now
[1:21:25] be behind the figurehead twisting it any
[1:21:28] way that she wants
[1:21:32] to how many thinks Biden was in
[1:21:37] control that man doesn't know how to get
[1:21:39] off the steps how's he going to control
[1:21:42] anything he can't you
[1:21:45] know can't keep a sentence straight you
[1:21:48] know no he's not controlling anything
[1:21:51] he's not pushing the buttons it's just
[1:21:53] coming out of his mouth because because
[1:21:54] he's the figurehead and so we look at
[1:21:57] him well he did it no it's somebody back
[1:21:59] there AOC or one of them
[1:22:05] huh isn't that crazy how AOC and some of
[1:22:07] those liberals and all of that they're
[1:22:09] just excited about oh yeah we're gonna
[1:22:11] rich just going to have a
[1:22:13] blast I don't know if you ever seen OC
[1:22:15] AOC after Trump went to New York and
[1:22:17] then she came in and uh she had a little
[1:22:20] rally and she Plum went berserk almost
[1:22:22] we got to get it back we got to get it
[1:22:23] back we she was hysterical thinking that
[1:22:25] maybe you might lose
[1:22:30] control amen I got a lot I want to say
[1:22:32] here but I hope you can bear with me she
[1:22:34] wiped it all up and she'll do it again
[1:22:37] now notice she's uh now notice twisting
[1:22:41] it any way she wants to and nobody's
[1:22:43] going to stop
[1:22:45] her nobody's going to stop her now
[1:22:47] because what they couldn't get done in
[1:22:49] the religious Cycles they'll do it
[1:22:52] through politics and then they done it
[1:22:55] see that's exactly right which the polit
[1:22:57] political will be a boycott just exactly
[1:23:01] back to the mark of the beast as sure as
[1:23:03] I'm standing here the Bible says it now
[1:23:05] there's many young people here I don't
[1:23:07] know Jesus may come this afternoon he
[1:23:09] may come next year I don't know when
[1:23:10] he'll be coming but you remember if I do
[1:23:13] not live to see the day is coming which
[1:23:14] I hope that I will and some I believe I
[1:23:16] will now if I do not see it do not let
[1:23:19] this word ever depart from your ears and
[1:23:22] your heart you just remember remember I
[1:23:25] speak in the name of the Lord I believe
[1:23:27] with all of my heart that's the way
[1:23:28] it'll wind up there'll be like a union a
[1:23:32] boyot and all such places as this here
[1:23:35] will be closed down then and you'll not
[1:23:37] be able to speak unless you have got a
[1:23:39] permission or a license from the federal
[1:23:42] Federation of churches to hold a
[1:23:45] service
[1:23:49] wow now let me ask you something how
[1:23:52] many knows that she swall following
[1:23:55] every he's wiping it all up I said
[1:23:58] there's two evils Catholicism and the
[1:24:00] image of the Beast
[1:24:03] okay now we know that the real evil if
[1:24:08] you really want to know something that's
[1:24:09] real evil it'll be
[1:24:12] homosexuality is that right LGB and all
[1:24:15] of that that's
[1:24:18] wickedness and now how do you tie that
[1:24:20] in with church Brother Brad how how does
[1:24:23] that got anything to do with
[1:24:26] churches and they're getting into
[1:24:28] everything I remember years ago uh uh
[1:24:31] Governor kusumo up in New York right he
[1:24:35] me he was talking about he's going to
[1:24:36] Outlaw big gulps too much sugar you
[1:24:39] can't have big
[1:24:41] gulps this out the other and all these
[1:24:44] other things they were trying to do and
[1:24:46] and things they were trying to
[1:24:48] push a't that
[1:24:52] right well big GS what's that got to do
[1:24:55] well it's just intruding on on on
[1:24:56] people's
[1:24:59] rights intruding on people's rights let
[1:25:03] me see what I got
[1:25:06] here and then it goes from one to the
[1:25:09] other
[1:25:11] then it goes of course they're doing
[1:25:14] their best to take your guns away is
[1:25:17] that
[1:25:18] right camela said that I I'll give
[1:25:21] Congress a 100 days and if they don't do
[1:25:23] something about about it I am signing
[1:25:25] executive order we're going to ban ARs
[1:25:27] and all that other
[1:25:28] stuff that sound like a dictator to you
[1:25:31] or what well if they don't make the law
[1:25:34] I'll make the
[1:25:37] law what have they done even even Biden
[1:25:41] now and and well let me just say this
[1:25:43] look at look at what they've done they
[1:25:45] had they had an absolute hisy
[1:25:48] fit I remember uh Nancy Pelosi saying
[1:25:52] boy I'll tell you what if the Democrats
[1:25:53] were and we would really do something
[1:25:55] with this Co I mean we'd do something
[1:25:58] with it you know and that after Trump
[1:26:00] got out didn't they do
[1:26:02] it they exactly did they was made it
[1:26:04] mandatory and if you work for the
[1:26:06] government and if you didn't take it if
[1:26:07] you was a soldier and you didn't take it
[1:26:09] isin't that right they forced you to do
[1:26:16] it forced you to do
[1:26:19] it all of these uh uh uh lesbians G all
[1:26:24] this um Sports and inner uh changing sex
[1:26:30] and all of
[1:26:31] that it's not like and we all know it's
[1:26:34] not like they'll just do it for
[1:26:35] themselves that's that they're not happy
[1:26:37] with that you have to agree with it did
[1:26:40] you ever watch them any on the news when
[1:26:42] they are talking to each other Bo if you
[1:26:44] don't agree with them they hate your
[1:26:45] guts and they want you
[1:26:49] dead there's a spirit rising up brother
[1:26:52] bam says we got to get it they got to
[1:26:54] get in the spirit of the end time before
[1:26:56] the end time can come they have to get
[1:26:58] in the spirit of the
[1:26:59] Antichrist and then what did they do
[1:27:01] they didn't stop there but they
[1:27:03] infringed even
[1:27:04] more and went
[1:27:07] crazy okay what did they do when they
[1:27:10] went crazy I'll tell you what they did
[1:27:12] is they went into the schools and said
[1:27:14] look we're going to have let your
[1:27:16] children decide what they are maybe even
[1:27:19] giving them a sex change and not even
[1:27:20] telling the parents and all that oh you
[1:27:22] parents ain't got no right to tell us
[1:27:24] what to teach and everything else let me
[1:27:27] ask you who are those people them are
[1:27:29] denominational church
[1:27:35] folks denominational church folks
[1:27:39] teachers and everything else principles
[1:27:40] and governors and all of that you think
[1:27:43] there's any Holiness in them churches no
[1:27:45] there's not they'll let homosexuals
[1:27:48] preach lesbians and and Mary all of that
[1:27:51] they're as filthy as the homosexuals are
[1:27:53] they won't hesitate to persecute
[1:27:57] you so you see how that squeeze is
[1:28:01] coming just like the homosexuals on in
[1:28:04] Sodom and gomorra pressed their way into
[1:28:06] it pushing it squeezing
[1:28:09] it forcing it's a forcing brother
[1:28:11] Brandon went all the way back to
[1:28:13] Nebuchadnezzar and how they forced
[1:28:14] everybody to worship Daniel that Idol or
[1:28:18] they'd be killed he says it's came in
[1:28:20] that way it'll go out that way
[1:28:24] it'll be a
[1:28:27] forcing
[1:28:30] amen and I thought well maybe it'll just
[1:28:33] be uh and I truly believe that brother
[1:28:34] Bram all every every instant everything
[1:28:37] that I can come come up with and brother
[1:28:39] Bram says at that time it's at that time
[1:28:41] that Christ will take his
[1:28:43] church amen but let me just say
[1:28:47] this there's this there's a quote that I
[1:28:50] wanted to say isn't it strange that
[1:28:53] right in the hour of Darkness then Jesus
[1:28:55] comes along and calls them and says
[1:28:57] don't be
[1:28:59] scared amen one thing that should be one
[1:29:02] thing this should do for anybody is give
[1:29:04] you a wakeup call hey am I ready to go
[1:29:08] does it scare you a little
[1:29:13] bit and then to Brothers I seen a text
[1:29:15] where it said something about well you
[1:29:17] know maybe it it maybe she should be we
[1:29:20] should just pray she comes on in
[1:29:27] and I thought about
[1:29:29] that pray that she comes on
[1:29:33] in in order to have that mentality hello
[1:29:36] in order to have that mentality you've
[1:29:38] got to let go of this world and wanting
[1:29:40] to be
[1:29:43] here ain't that right and you better not
[1:29:47] wait till it happens to let go we better
[1:29:49] start letting go tonight saying God I'm
[1:29:52] ready to get out of here I don't have my
[1:29:54] Ties on here I don't put everything else
[1:29:57] in front of Christ Christ is first
[1:29:59] Christ Holy Ghost is first church is
[1:30:01] first God's first
[1:30:03] [Music]
[1:30:05] hallu don't be scared don't let this
[1:30:08] scare you I'm with you he says aren't
[1:30:12] you glad Christ is with us going through
[1:30:15] this and seeing the squeeze come
[1:30:18] down Amen brother BR said much about the
[1:30:22] squeeze and you take the political realm
[1:30:24] he said using that political realm
[1:30:26] because the churches are already in it
[1:30:28] they're swallowed up in that Antichrist
[1:30:29] Spirit they they took the Antichrist
[1:30:32] Spirit when they rejected Jesus Christ
[1:30:35] in this hour when they rejected the
[1:30:37] message that God sent to this generation
[1:30:40] infallible of Jesus Christ coming down
[1:30:41] every time and prove it when you reject
[1:30:43] that you reject God
[1:30:47] period
[1:30:50] amen so my so you think about all the
[1:30:54] way down to our
[1:30:56] children Amen to our gas stoves all of a
[1:30:58] sudden they're saying you can't have gas
[1:31:00] stoves and they're pressing amen that
[1:31:02] you can't have cars you got to have
[1:31:03] elect where's that law come from did
[1:31:05] Congress vote on that brother
[1:31:07] Brad because I missed it that I'm going
[1:31:10] to have to let ride electric scooters
[1:31:12] around with a seat in
[1:31:16] it Trump says I'll make it to where you
[1:31:19] can if you want to but if you don't you
[1:31:20] can still drive gas cars
[1:31:27] then you know the latest hey you want a
[1:31:29] good one I got a good one I heard just
[1:31:31] the other day just the other day that
[1:31:35] Biden is trying to get rid of your
[1:31:37] plastic forks and
[1:31:39] spoons because of global
[1:31:44] warming well my gracious if he can take
[1:31:46] your spoon away from you what else can
[1:31:49] he take away from you
[1:31:56] hey we thought it was funny when they
[1:31:58] said this uh uh you know take the money
[1:32:01] away from the police force they'll never
[1:32:03] they did don't laugh too hard nothing
[1:32:07] will surprise
[1:32:08] me nothing is surprised ain't nothing
[1:32:11] surprise you it wouldn't be surprised
[1:32:13] one bit and look at how they go after
[1:32:16] everything even don't know they even
[1:32:18] though it burns them up and in and
[1:32:21] people know that there ain't no trans
[1:32:23] man should be in there fighting a woman
[1:32:25] but yet they do it because of the
[1:32:27] principle we said it do it then do
[1:32:30] it you tell me they're not evil huh to
[1:32:34] what length will they go I can certainly
[1:32:37] see how if camela does get it with her
[1:32:39] attitude yeah she'll she'll do
[1:32:42] everything and people don't rise up
[1:32:44] against
[1:32:45] it now let me just say this
[1:32:49] again to think that oh yeah just let it
[1:32:51] come cu the bride does say even so Lord

[1:32:56] little longer vote

[1:33:07] anyway you love the
[1:33:10] Lord I certainly wouldn't vote camela

[1:33:47] I know some Churches get burnt and
[1:33:49] people throw stuff in because of what
[1:33:51] they preach Donnie Reagan P got a little
[1:33:53] persecution because of what he preached

[1:34:47] millions upon millions of people that
[1:34:49] are still sane hello that are still
[1:34:53] don't want all of this stuff Ain that

[1:35:18] home ain't that right we live here we

[1:35:30] everybody Panic they didn't run over
[1:35:31] each other killing until they get out of

[1:36:53] squeeze that squeeze you looking at it
[1:36:55] how many believ we're looking at
[1:36:57] it they practi this and that's why
[1:37:00] Pelosi and them said we would like to
[1:37:01] let's see what we can make them
[1:37:04] do let's see if we can make them close
[1:37:06] down their
[1:37:08] churches

[1:37:14] this what good did it do we was out of
[1:37:17] church for two months
[1:37:20] maybe at the beginning of it and it was
[1:37:22] about a year later later if I remember
[1:37:24] about a year after we started coming
[1:37:26] back again it come through here like a
[1:37:28] wave we all pretty much got
[1:37:32] it when they had two or three cases and
[1:37:34] all of that just a few cases they shut
[1:37:36] everything down well guess what it
[1:37:39] spread anyhow took about a year for us
[1:37:41] to really come around to
[1:37:43] us

[1:39:07] the thing bringing it
[1:39:09] down unionized religion mark my word it
[1:39:13] ain't far off she's just around the
[1:39:15] corner the reason that you don't know
[1:39:17] the things is you're at home here all
[1:39:18] the time follow me over into countries
[1:39:20] where Catholicism has the upper hand one
[1:39:22] time and you'll see what takes Brothers
[1:39:25] takes care takes place brother they tell
[1:39:27] him what they can do and what they
[1:39:29] cannot
[1:39:31] do hello so you tell me who's behind the
[1:39:35] figurehead somebody wants to tell you
[1:39:37] what to do and what you can't do all the
[1:39:41] way down to your plastic
[1:39:44] spoons I don't know about you but I'm
[1:39:46] just expecting it
[1:39:48] anytime I'm expecting it
[1:39:51] anytime Things Are shaping
[1:39:54] up just the way that they supposed to
[1:39:58] let me close with this one thought that
[1:40:00] I was hoping to get across and that is
[1:40:02] brother Braham says they'll stamp out
[1:40:05] anything that doesn't agree with
[1:40:09] them anything that doesn't agree with
[1:40:12] them and remember if the devil can just
[1:40:15] get you to agree with him how many
[1:40:18] believes he's got you I thought it's
[1:40:20] like somebody gossiping the church
[1:40:22] brother bam said when you listen to that
[1:40:24] gossip in other words when you believe
[1:40:26] that
[1:40:27] gossip the Holy Spirit takes its
[1:40:30] flight Jesus Christ leaves the person
[1:40:33] gossiping they're already poisoned by
[1:40:35] the devil they already lost it amen just
[1:40:39] by a believing
[1:40:41] it and in the Dark Ages if you would
[1:40:43] just kiss the cross crucifix or just
[1:40:46] agree with them CU two unless how can
[1:40:48] two walk together unless they be
[1:40:51] agreed this is what we come down to the
[1:40:54] nutshell that I was telling you about
[1:40:55] the devil doesn't care if we have church
[1:40:57] he don't he wouldn't care if you're
[1:40:58] message churches whatever as long as you
[1:41:00] agree with him but cross them have you
[1:41:04] ever seen such a hateful spirit I mean
[1:41:07] if you cross them man they just they
[1:41:08] hate you and it's the spirit of that
[1:41:12] that Antichrist
[1:41:13] Spirit they want to get rid of
[1:41:17] you amen and it's the spirit getting
[1:41:21] ready not just think about this all you
[1:41:23] have to do to be go on the devil's side
[1:41:26] is to agree with
[1:41:27] them okay that's fine let's let's just
[1:41:30] let them have that you you know I'm not
[1:41:32] opposed to you know having this that or
[1:41:34] the other in
[1:41:36] church okay well just don't come don't
[1:41:38] say anything against it we're good why
[1:41:40] you done agree with the devil you're on
[1:41:42] his side but you know because that's
[1:41:45] ultimately Brother Brad the scope of the
[1:41:47] picture of the whole thing is if the
[1:41:49] devil can get you to do that that's his
[1:41:51] whole goal
[1:41:53] it's not so much about Nancy Pelosi and
[1:41:56] her millions or or Trump and his
[1:41:58] millions all these people that have
[1:41:59] billions of dollars now they're focused
[1:42:01] on power they want to be able to tell
[1:42:03] the people what they can and can't do
[1:42:05] and that is the devil that is the spirit
[1:42:08] of the devil amen and it's actually
[1:42:11] bringing it down to where like brother
[1:42:12] baham says you won't be able to have
[1:42:14] church unless you're a part of them
[1:42:16] ain't that
[1:42:17] right and just it just takes that it
[1:42:21] comes down to just that the devil just
[1:42:22] wants you just to be in agreement with
[1:42:28] him and do you realize that Jesus Christ
[1:42:31] is the same
[1:42:33] way the devil will take you to hell when
[1:42:36] you agree with him but the Bible says
[1:42:40] that he will he that will confess with
[1:42:42] his mouth the Lord Jesus Christ shall be
[1:42:45] saved he's the high priest of our
[1:42:48] profession brother baham said to profess
[1:42:50] something is to say the same thing many
[1:42:53] beliefs that you have to confess Jesus
[1:42:55] Christ died for my sin I believe that
[1:42:57] and he'll save you and fill you with the
[1:42:59] Holy Ghost give you eternal life the
[1:43:02] devil will do everything in his power by
[1:43:04] forcing you to agree with him God Don't
[1:43:07] force you to do it the devil is trying
[1:43:09] to force
[1:43:10] people
[1:43:12] amen that's where we're at
[1:43:14] folks that's where we're
[1:43:17] at coming very close to the forcing one
[1:43:21] of these days don't be surprised keep
[1:43:23] your eyes open how many's got their eyes
[1:43:25] open we're looking at the clock it's a
[1:43:27] late hour could very well be that woman
[1:43:30] if it is brother you better get ready to
[1:43:32] go home and you know this is the thought
[1:43:34] that I had when I begin to study this
[1:43:36] and that is boy you don't want to wait
[1:43:38] until then to start getting
[1:43:40] ready amen there'll come a time when
[1:43:42] it's too late for you to get ready
[1:43:44] brother bam said when that squeeze comes
[1:43:45] down he says it's too late
[1:43:48] then this is the hour this Wednesday
[1:43:50] night right now is the hour say God I
[1:43:52] want to be ready
[1:43:53] Lord have me ready let her go ahead if
[1:43:56] they want to vote that in vote her in
[1:43:58] cuz God won't let anything go in there
[1:44:00] that he don't allow God knows exactly
[1:44:02] who's going to get it amen and if it
[1:44:05] ain't her and Trump goes in for another
[1:44:07] four years that'd be a good time for it
[1:44:09] to come CU everybody thought this that
[1:44:10] or the other you don't know brother brah
[1:44:12] said that Figure Head was behind Kennedy
[1:44:13] all the way back then
[1:44:15] already amen and I thought you know in
[1:44:18] my mind the eal Cil get together and all
[1:44:21] these churches will say look you've got
[1:44:23] to be this out or the other but it may
[1:44:25] be a lot trickier than what you think
[1:44:26] cuz that ecumenical part is part of that
[1:44:29] evil thing and to begin with and then
[1:44:32] they're using the politics to achieve
[1:44:34] their
[1:44:34] goal might be a little different what we
[1:44:37] think amen but yet it's still fulfilling
[1:44:39] that very
[1:44:43] prophecy amen that's right it's kind of
[1:44:46] funny spoons and porks but yet it's the
[1:44:49] eyeopener hate they'll even try to do
[1:44:52] that
[1:44:54] amen what will they do
[1:44:56] next amen God bless you stand with
[1:45:03] me with our heads
[1:45:06] bowed eyes
[1:45:08] closed I hope
[1:45:12] tonight that this will cause you to lift
[1:45:14] up your
[1:45:15] head because you're Redemption is
[1:45:17] drawing nigh we're closer than we've
[1:45:20] ever been we've heard it and we've heard
[1:45:22] it we've heard it and we've heard it
[1:45:24] tell it to me one more time and help me
[1:45:27] to get ready one more time because one
[1:45:29] of these days it's going to happen one
[1:45:32] of these mornings there's going to be a
[1:45:33] sweet change come over us but it's not
[1:45:36] coming to those who have their hearts
[1:45:38] away from God and that have their
[1:45:40] priorities
[1:45:42] wrong no it's those who have their
[1:45:45] priorities right that have the sweetness
[1:45:48] of the Holy Ghost in their hearts and
[1:45:50] that are living for him every sing
[1:45:53] single
[1:45:55] day how many raise your hand say God
