David had a grasp on things and he wrote about here he said wherefore David bless the Lord starting it's in first Chronicles 29 starting in verse 10. wherefore David blessed the Lord before all the congregation and David said blessed be the Lord of Israel Our Father forever and ever thine O Lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the Victory and the Majesty for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine thine is the kingdom O Lord and thou art exalted as head above all both riches and honor come of thee and thou reign as though overall and in thine hands his power and might in that hand it is to make great and to give strength strength all now therefore Our God we thank thee and praise the Glorious name but who am I and what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sword for all things come of thee and of thine own have we given thee for we are strangers before the answer journals as their as were all our fathers our days are on our days are on our days on the earth or as a shadow and there is none abiding if you're going talk about being a stranger and a Sojourner and then Hebrew is here Hebrews 11. and it's just a small uh Hebrews 11 starting in verse 13. Paul's talking here these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embrace them and confess that they were strangers and pilgrims on the Earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from once they came out they might have had an opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is in Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a city and just thinking about that being pilgrims and strangers identifying as Pilgrim and a stranger in this earth as you see the world kind of slipping off into whatever they're slipping off into it's not good it's Darkness it's chaos I was putting an order in for uh uh a mixer and the person I was uh chatting with on online I think his name might have been Justin but it said Justin and then it said he him so it had whatever they call those I guess pronouns but it's an identification well that goes pretty good that rhymes he him it should be because his name's Justin but anymore it might not have been it might have been something else but as you see people identifying themselves as whatever they might be he him or whatever she or sometimes they might be an animal cat or chicken uh me and my wife were talking and they got all the letters you know uh for the lgbtq and we added some of our own which is LT lgbtq s-t-u-p-i-d so which it's funny but you know it's really sad they they're in a identification process of identifying themselves and they don't really know what they are but as they're doing that as the world's going off into that we should be identifying ourselves and where we find ourselves and brother Brenham uh preached identification but I got it I got notes here but they're kind of mixed up uh but we'll try to get through it so in identifying ourselves we must identify at some point our time where are we living in and uh and if we look in the Scriptures it says as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of Sodom and more so shall be in the days of the returning of the son of man so we're there so we can identify our time and then we have to identify our message well there are message when the message went forth I got some quotes in here let me pull these in here so identifying our time as for this is now notice in the coming of the Lord Jesus is so close at hand and tell the spirit from way down in here just barely justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit now right into the time of the coming of The Headstone the church has got to be so perfectly like Christ until Christ and the church can unite together the same spirit and if the spirit of Christ is in you it makes you live the life of Christ act the Life of Christ do the works of Christ either believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also Jesus said that see and now we're going to have we got to have a Ministry coming that just exactly like the Life of Christ what does diminished identify the coming of the Lord he says look at the world today and watch what he says Krishna saying but we could say Putin's saying same country all these other great things worldwide conflicts right at hand at any time to go to powder in any second that's right and if that if that we know that that that's close any sensible person can read in the newspaper or listen to the radio and know that that is close well remember then Christ comes for his church before that happens so how close is the coming of Lord Jesus maybe before today maybe before the end of the meeting today we're at the end time certainly true it's her time identifying her time identifying her message but a man has got to be convinced first and only convincing thing is the manifestation or the identity of the Gospel being identified in you when you see a creature in Christ Jesus that's at any identity of the Holy Spirit that's exactly right how can the Holy Spirit write the Bible and turn around and deny what he wrote he cannot do it he is that's the identity of unbelief that's identity of unbelief but the identity of belief Jesus said these signs shall identify those who believe now we know that's God's Own word that's true uh today's age they say they got Jesus they say they got the Holy Ghost but they turn around and deny the very scripture that they uh supposed to be preaching out of are teaching out of so identifying the message remember how brother Brandon said people say well in Jesus day I would have been standing with Jesus well if you would have been sinning with Jesus in Jesus day you would have been standing with Jesus today and they don't do it they deny the word and then the next thing that we must identify is ourselves identifying ourselves and I got it all mixed up here but let's read this one this is goes with us and that's what we want to look at tonight but I'm sorry I want I want to look at me and I want you to look at yourself and as we look into God's Great mirror of his word then be able to identify ourselves with some that we're going to speak about some of the characters and the other times in the scriptures and I want to see myself in God's looking glass because if anything will show you where you're standing it's it's the Bible there's no book like it because it is all truth I don't say that other books are not true but I know this one is true it's all truth because it's the word of God now Jesus given us example of what we ought to be looking at when he reflected his life to us through the word what we should see when we look into God's mirror we should see ourselves identified with him that is a perfect example now but we find out that as we go along through life that our character molds image that we are each one knows that you as you live so your character molds you into what you are talking about this little boy that came from the country went into the city this was before everybody kind of got a bunch of stuff but he said this little ad must have been raised in in the country and raised in a home and when you come down to visit his grandmother she said um she had a door that on the back side of it was a mirror and the little ad was kind of Lonesome and he was looking all around the house and after a bit he happened to look through the door look back at the door and it had been closed since they come in and the mirror on and it had a mirror on this side and he saw a little boy and he stared to the little boy to make friends with him and as he began to look into the glass he got up close and he turned around and said why mama that's me and that's what we want to look at tonight I want to look at we want to look at me I want to look you want to look at yourself and we want to look into God's Great mirror which is his word and be able to identify herself with some that we're going to speak about some of the characters of our times of other times and I want to see myself in God's looking glass because if anything will show you where you're standing it's the Bible there is no book like it because it's the truth and Jesus gave a yeah so that goes on then I had that in there twice but about as an example of Jesus and how Jesus lived through lived his life and if we identify ourselves we must identify with the word with the scripture and with the word that was brought in our day a lot of people get it confusing they say they say lots of things but they say they always like to say you're you're following a man it's it's they're probably following more of a man than what we're following him in but the scripture brother Brandon's message takes and points back to the scripture always points back to scripture and it takes Revelation sometimes to see that but that's what brother Brandon's message was to do for the great Dreadful of the Lord Malachi 4. Malachi turned the heart to the to Elijah to send turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers well that's what his message was to do is turns our hearts back to the original Apostolic Faith so the seed the time we're in now the identification of the time identification identifying our time our message and Who We Are and the time is it's about Jesus like Jesus said the time is as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the Sodom it's about going home time uh how we're in the time now of the seed the original grain and it's pulling away from the shut so if we can identify those things I thought oh after seeing that and how he they identify everybody identifies themselves as that I want to identify with the word and I feel like we do identify with the word we want to line up with the word we want to line up we're in the stages of going home and and uh the seeds now pulling away from the shock [Music] the combines coming and we want to be identified in the right place when he shows up Brother David amen loving this morning they identifies a lot of things but I was thinking as for the Troy was speaking this one let's stand and thought you know what we identify this morning as we identify as a child of the king this morning it may not just a king but the king the king of kings and let's sing that little course oh yes oh yes I'm a child of the king this morning and oh my one side was closed in the rain oh wretches lost that lonely but with wondrous compassion the key of all Kings in pity and great love he took me under his wings I know yes oh yes [Music] offline my veins [Music] [Music] the head Heavenly home and my Holy Father well he has made me his own now and I'm cold in his love and someday I'm going to sing or with the angels above I know yes oh yes oh I'm a child Vietnam flows through my veins [Music] [Music] praise God praise God I'm a child the king amen are you happy to be a child of a king this morning and my you know I I was thinking as I was going down the road yesterday and just meditating on the Lord and you know and how many times when you wake up and you start praying the devil just he'll just throw everything in the world in your mind and you need to build this you need to go here you can do that and you know and I thought you know devil I always remember brother Donnie Reagan said one time he said poor old dumb devil you know he tells us all the time we're not a Christian and we're not doing anything right but what's the first thing that happens when you go to pray he goes working on you don't he because he knows what that Prophet said he said when the weakest Christian gets on his needs to pray he goes to Trembling and I'm glad we make him tremble this morning aren't you that's my heart and desires just to to make him the most miserable thing there is and I'm proud to be a child of the king this morning I thought Lord draw us closer to you and I listen the prophet speak yesterday and he said with what Believers is here if we would really believe he said we could turn this world upside down I told Jan yesterday I thought Lord help me to be the kind of believer I need to believe to be this morning and take him at his words he's done done it brother Brandon said if he was standing here in the suit of clothes that he gave me he couldn't heal you why he's already done it he said he saved you over 1900 years ago he's already done it we just have to accept what God's done I said Lord help me to accept what you've done not for brother Tommy but for me I'm happy for brother Tommy and I'm happy for Brother Brad and brother Caleb but I want what God's got for me this morning don't you amen let's sing that little course every promise in the book is mine this morning if we could amen well every promise in the book

good to be in the house of Lord on this beautiful day thank you musicians appreciate the music amen appreciate the specials the Sunday School amen this morning brother Troy my my title initially was going to be on identification amen amen I was thinking for that same verse where it talks about he says we have to be in this very image in order to be United with him so he brought some of that stuff out and I said well that's just wonderful amen and then of course we want to read that scripture about being ready so that certainly goes along with the song We sang so we just feel the moving of the spirit this morning amen amen praise the Lord I yesterday evening uh you know just beginning to study and pray and what to minister on and and really didn't know which direction I want to go until later last evening and just praying Lord help me to find the direction you want me to go and then amen Lord begin to give me something there last evening a little bit late there and but you know even before I got something something was just telling me that you know we're going to have a good day today amen I just felt like the Lord was going to move today Amen in the special way and then uh the Lord answered to prayer on the message to minister this morning so I certainly feel amen like even our message this morning is an answer to prayer amen so God bless you glad everybody's doing well amen and amen to just get in and everybody doing good and so that's wonderful and amen everything that's going on just the Lord's hand in everything and that's what we want isn't that right amen so um I mean this will certainly go along with Wednesday night amen it shouldn't almost could be part two of what tonight but amen I'm not like some preachers that can have a 100 different message messages on one line amen but amen certainly goes along with what we were saying Wednesday but um we want to speak this morning and I wanted to call it climax but instead I'm going to call it Harvest Time amen Harvest time this morning so let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you Lord the author the finisher of our faith the author of our book lord and the scriptures that we are reading Lord and we just want to approach you this morning Father Desiring Lord Jesus knowing father that we can read your word Lord but it takes you to give the inspiration and Lords and words to say father that would benefit of Christ this morning and we just desire Lord that you'll have your perfect way in every heart Lord and Lord we know that this this service this morning this church service and everybody here but we believe it's all all been ordained of you Lord Jesus from before the foundation of the world Lord and Lord to be able to say that God and really truly Lord that you have ordained or this hour you've ordained this minute you've ordained this sermon you've ordained this setting Lord It's just wonderful to know that we are in your will Lord Jesus and father doing what you want us to do Lord and father that gives us great joy and give comfort and peace Lord we ask God that you give comfort and peace in this our Lord and Lord that you would just touch Megan in this special way she comes to my mind Lord we ask Lord that you'll just do a miracle for her for Jason for that family in this special way Lord and we know that you will Lord for we have asked and we believe that you hear our prayers God and we just desire now Lord that you'll be with each one that is I'm Lord this morning Lord draw them closer to you Lord help us to go from here better than what we've come bless them meditation of a heart bless your word anoint us now we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen if you will turn your Bibles Amen in amen let's go to the Book of Matthew go to the Book of Matthew and it certainly will have a little bit to do with identification amen amen the lights just come on I guess something got brighter didn't it amen all right well praise the Lord hey man what do you think one of these days things are really going to brighten up for us aren't they amen praise the Lord so amen let's um go to Matthew amen and do you all have lots of patience this morning amen lots of patience this morning and and ready to sit down and just chew your food slow so that you can get more in in that right amen and so praise the Lord amen said it'll digest but amen we do have uh quite a bit on the platter this morning but we just amen will do as a holy spirit leads Matthew 13 let's go to Matthew 13. thank you how many believes that we're in the hour of harvest we're living in the Harvest Time and this morning we want to try with the help of the Lord to get us to truly understand you know that the only real light amen uh and I forget just which message it was it was Taurus the last of brother Brown's message she talked about you know even when God spoke let there be light amen there was not light amen and that that word was not light until it manifested isn't that right it was as dark as it ever was until that happened isn't that right until the sun shined amen that was the manifestation and and he said you know that's the way it is with any portion of the word of God because it's a lot of to all different ages the word of this allotted and the only light that there truly is is to manifested word for the hour amen I mean I believe we're living in a certain now and it's important that we understand the hour where we're living in where we're at amen amen and where we are are and who we are to be a ble to identify ourselves amen amen because we're certainly living in a world that has an identity crisis amen but we we're living in a world but now you and I are not in an identity crisis isn't that right as a matter of fact we're the forest thing from an identity crisis we know who we are amen how many believes that it's important that you know that you know that you know amen that's knowing pretty knowing amen pretty sure when you know that you know that you know amen so that's how we want to be we want to look a little bit this morning with the help of the Lord amen and continuing on talking about uh uh backs basically the original sin but we want to talk about climax we want to talk about Harvest time and if you talk about Harvest time you're also talking about maturity time you're talking about fruition time isn't that right amen before you can Harvest something something has to come to fruition it has to be ready to be harvested isn't that right amen so let's go to uh now in the 13th chapter of Matthew as you know um uh Jesus talked about uh you know talking about the two different seeds that were sown and so forth but the uh they had again Jesus sent the the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him he's saying declare on to us the parable of the Terrors and and of the field so if you first first time he described that he just described it amen as being tweet and tears isn't that right now he's going to explain just what he meant and he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one amen how do you like that how do you like when he just comes out and just really makes it plain hey man we're not just talking about wheat and tears but we're talking about children of God and we're talking about children of the devil isn't it right it certainly helps you understand things and it also helps you not to bite your teeth or your your fingernails off worrying about people isn't that right we know that God knows them that are his and he won't lose a one amen all right now notice the Terrors are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sowed them is the devil the Harvest is the end um the end of the world gathered and burned tires so shall it be at the end of this world and the son of man shall send forth his angels and they Shall Gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of tea then shall the righteous shine forth as the Son and the kingdom of their father who hath ears to hear Let Him hear amen may God add His blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated I just want to say you know really truly it is only those who have ears that will hear I may know is it because there's all those people out there they don't know who they are they don't know what they are Amen brother Joe was telling me that uh you know I I I I I yes um you know uh Jason and them had their neighbor just the other day I guess to kill himself out on the portion from anybody because you know the conditions are so bad people don't even want to live anymore they don't want to they don't know who they are they don't have anything to live for and can we say where he would you be wouldn't you be about the same condition but you know pretty much if if you didn't have the gospel if you didn't have Christ I mean life just wouldn't be worth living if it wasn't for God Amen it'd be a terrible thing amen but praise be to God we're glad this morning to know amen now first of all as we think about this now notice and I just want to take my time if that's okay so we see here that uh Jesus saying that you know that the the Terrors of course are the children of the wicked one and then over in first John uh first John in chapter 3 and verse 9 says whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God and there's the children of God are manifested and the children of the devil amen praise the Lord so we're talking about God's children again and we're talking about the devil's children again amen who's whoever does not righteous is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother for this is the message that you have heard from the beginning we look at that Wicked one praise the Lord Dominos man if he was of the wicked one every one of his children were of the wicked one if anybody can't understand serpent seed if everybody can't believe that there's actually Children of the devil on the earth you just have to absolutely uh I want to say intentionally be blind you don't want to most people do not want to believe it and therefore they try to excuse themselves and say any other way but Jesus clearly declared it isn't that right that the world is the seed the enemy came and sold the bad he sowed to tear he clearly said that the children of the wicked one of the tares the Bible clearly declares that came was of that Wicked one his nature this wicked is that abuse amen but praise be to God and then we want to talk this morning with the help of the Lord about the gods children and Satan's Children coming to a climax or coming to fruition because that my friend is the hour that you and I are living in how many believe that oh my brother bam says in the God of this evil age he says what is this he says the world's heading to a climax amen the whole world is coming to a climax that's right the whole thing amen the whole story of the whole thing between God's children amen and Satan's children is found all the way over in Genesis of how did the devil and it came to Eve as you all know isn't that right it's three and four it's the Dead the serpent became you know we know that Satan was uh inhabited or he was anointing the serpent all right which the most subtle beast of the field and that serpent could actually talk in the park the serpent said to the woman well let's talk about the uh the woman the woman first woman said in verse but if the fruit of the tree which is a the midst of God and God has said ye shall not eat it but neither shall you touch it at least ye die now how many knows she knew what the truth was she knew what the word of God was and so but you know the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die amen oh my God all right so he added in there and let me tell you something the climb the action with all the fruition of that lie is what you and I are experiencing are seeing in our day and every one of you faces that lie every day because you have the power to reason as long as you have the power to reason the devil has a has a right to come in there and try to get you to reason amen if you aren't careful he will come into that reasoning power and he'll get you to amen just do like eat it and get you to stray off and let me tell you something people are stray off and and truly the ones that stray off all the way we know the child of God won't ever all the way because it's controlling God Amen but when they begin and to go off all right now let's look at another script scripture here right quick if we could I mean over in the book is sure but every time I think about Harvest Time and and so forth I think about description I think you just judge yourself of how well this goes along with what we have just read he's found in Revelations 14. I'm listening for leaves who also follow me this morning amen we'll take our time and take it as a lesson would that be all right Revelations 14. amen now in this what we're reading you'll find that there's two heart harvests okay two sickles and so forth now notice and and uh I think I want to go back to Matthew one more time after that now Revelations 14 and verse 14. look and behold it read it because I already started but I'd like to would have liked to pick that up a little bit before forehand but now look and I looked and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud one sat like unto the son of man having on his head a Golden Crown and in his hand a sharp sickle and another angel came out of the temple crying with a loud voice to him that's out on the cloud thrust in the icicle and reap for the time is come forth thee to reap how many believes that amen one of these days that which God has redeemed and purchased he's going to come and claim his purchase possession amen I like that scripture because he described the sense to God one of these days is Gonna Come and get what he has worked for what he has labored for what he has died for what he has done he's going to reap he's going to read the benefits of what he has done now I don't know about you but that ought to make you feel a little something in the church this morning because if you truly believe that you are part amen of what he's going to take to himself and amen when he comes back he comes to come to claim to purchase possession but you got to be bought not later on not in purgatory but he has to buy you now he has to pay for you now you have to be bought with a price now amen not let later on all right trust in thy sickle and reap for the time he's come for a deed to reap for the Harvest of the earth is ripe amen how many bleeds that's what we got to come to amen then we want to take and I want to I want to show you amen the terribleness of of one side and Satan's Children when they go in the Antichrist amen that which is so deceiving deceived very elective as possible and then on the other side of course you know and I will just show you both sides with the help of the Lord this morning if we can all right now notice for the earth now notice for the Harvest of the earth is right I mean those Jesus said be ye ready amen we are now basking in the presence of the sun according to the prophet of God what are we doing we're ripening what is the oh my aren't you glad folks I don't know about you but I'm here to tell you God didn't stop doing stuff when the prophet left the scene it wasn't all over no it's not all over we are almost we're you know wasn't it 40 years that Israel journeyed in the wilderness before they come up in the border and before they crossed I was trying to do the math and since 65 now not not even before 465 but I think we're like 57 years or something like that since 1965 almost coming up on 60 years a lot longer than Israel ever Journey Through the Wilderness this is how long you and I have been journeying amen how many beliefs it's about time for us to come to fruition I want you to understand something and that is that we're one we're one or the other we're either a sheep or a goat or we are a a wheat or a terror going One Direction or the other amen because the world is certainly hitting heading to the fullness of its ripeness coming to its head coming to as the prophet said it's climax oh my God praise the Lord now let's look at it look at it again here now notice how it says and he see that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the Earth and the Earth was reaped compare that with and I'll I'll go read the other one here in a minute to uh Matthew 24 and verse 31 and he sent his angels with all with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the Four Winds from one end of Heaven to the other amen now notice this is after the sign of the sign of the son of man appears in heaven and so forth then shall all the Earth of the mind uh Earth mourn and so forth but there's another reaping there but now let's look at this other one in Revelations have you got your page still there verse 17 and another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven he also having a sharp sickle now notice this is not the son of man I'm not the one on the cloud this is just another angel isn't that right compare that with Matthew once again the one we just read he says the uh the field is the world you could see that the children of a kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one the enemy that showed them it's the devil to harvest it's the end of the world and the reapers are the Angels isn't that right the reapers are the Angels verse 17 and oh no and another angel came out of the altar which had power over fire and cried I was him that said that had the signal saying trust in now thy sharp sickle and gather the Clusters notice how that Gathering how many knows that the terrors in the Bible say the bond the tears will be bundled hey man what are they gonna do burnt notice an angel comes from the fire isn't that right trust in that seek them out and gather the clusters of the mind of the Earth how many knows better man preached two lines there's two vines on the earth here's another Vine and her for her grapes are fully ripei I'm telling you what if you can't see the devil and his children they're becoming fully ripe you got to be blind as a bat can't even hardly go out of his house but has to wear blinders or something because people are naked and lewd and everything else the way to the world is make it and don't know it just sickle it into the Earth and gathered the vine of the earth and cast the casted into the great wine grass now notice this is not taking this punch into heaven but it's taking him to the wine price of the wrath of Almighty Gods amen what is it the Great Tribulation period name and they'll be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth and the Wine Pass was trodden without the city and blood came out of the wine press even into the horse's bridles by the space of a thousand six hundred furlongs wow so we see folks how that we're living in the hour and it just inspires me does something to me to think that we are living in the age of climax where in the age of maturity both the True Vine and the false mind is coming to maturity think about it folks amen that's brother Troy read that and I don't like to know I'd look for it for it he says you know Amen to those children of God that God elections Lexi says yeah we will be trained to be conformed to the image of his son this is in order to be United with him how many believe that you've got to have to be some kind of some kind if you're gonna have changed from this body amen and you're gonna meet the Lord Jesus in the air what manner of persons want you to be in all holy conversation amen praise the Lord my my all right praise be to God you love him so we see here it is ripening time this is fruition time praise the Lord amen now notice how that in how many knows that the devil's ambition the devil's ambition has been to be a god like God is to have to be worshiped that's been his ambition in the first place amen and he started out with a lie in the Garden of Eden and all of his followers also follow a lie amen the whole world is following that lie Lord help us the Bible talks about how that it would be so deceiving that if it was possible it would deceive the very elected amen now let's look at let's look at let's look at the Loop here first of all amen I want to talk a look at the look at the devil's Church basically but let's just read a quote here out of God of this evil age now notice where the world's heading to a climax and he says and now notice why the spirit of lawlessness modern Decay moderate moral decay lawlessness tell me something when we've ever had oh my you and I probably laugh we scorn when people would talk about dismissing the police force is that right and not supporting the police force what kind of world are we going to have an authority thought they could do it and it would be better and it's bad enough as it is tell me what kind of a mentality is that flawlessness didn't want law anymore I mean they don't want the children of the devil they don't want any kind of law they don't want any kind of Moral Moral Decay lawlessness is what's going to proceed I mean these type of things for prophecy by the almighty by almighty God through the prophet one place he said you know I believe it was in the uh uh anointed ones in the end time he said you know I may go by the way of the grave but if I do you just remember my words one day you'll know that what I've told you is the truth and I'm here to tell you I can verify that's it's nothing but the truth prophet of God that it's exactly like what you said it was whenever he was still backing in the 1960s in the Pentecostals which are still shouting and speaking in tongues and everything on and all that they were doing he said they are dead that would be hard to say see brother banham when he preached he preached up-to-date messages go back and look at that tell you what the one one way to not be deceived if you don't want to be deceived and I thought about because let me see I like that in the Book of Revelations because you know how many beliefs that we are in the Book of Revelations we're living in the Buckle Revelations we're living in that hot Simon got it from all Amen to see the ocean in them Mary he's gonna call us all up you're looking in that book of Revelation oh my God but this Antichrist talk about the Antichrist if you don't want to be deceived because it says blessed over in Revelations there's blessed are they that hear and read the prophecy of this book I may believe you're a blessed person none of you just hear it with your ear but if you can understand what this is all about amen because it's your only chance of not being deceived because remember like certain teenagers and all who all wander after the Beast whose names are not written in the last book of life and the foundation of the world the whole world wanders after the Beast foreign except for those whose names are in the Book of Life of the Lamb saved from the foundation of the world and you don't want to be deceived and then I believe the anointed ones at the end time he does even the Pentecostals they would never amen go for somebody coming up and saying I'm Jesus I don't care if you have nail scars here here and in your side because you could do that they wouldn't fall for it because we know better they know better but in Matthew 4 24 24 24 says you know that they'll come and do signs and ones are in so much a bit more possible they would deceive them very elected so that this devil that we're dealing with this Satan that we're dealing with this deception is so deceiving that if it were possible and he says you know the Bible's you know and then whatever it's whatever saying was you know they wouldn't take a Jesus but the Bible says they are false christs shall rise false anointed once and he says man as far as the Pentecostals you they got them and makes a statement some old cold former church that's not going to deceive nobody but it's those that are under the anointing those the Holy Ghost they can speak and they can preach as much as what I am this morning amen and they can make it sound so ever so good but there's only one little bitty difference and that is is it according to the word of God or not you can't tell by oh they'll tell you oh I got healed I got this I got that they'll heal they'll do all of those things because they said they would come and do this out or the other but are they according to the word of God or not that's the only way you'll know he makes that statement in anointed once he says you know as far as the United you can't tell the only way you can tell is he said according to the word because they were having blood coming out of their hands and the oil and laid hands on the six and do all of that he says and look they've got brother Brandon he got right with him he got right with him he says and then you go near somebody teaches that no that you know you can listen to the prophet when he's Healing The Sick and so forth but don't listen to his Doctrine he said you go tell it to you and then you go teach the women they can cut their hair and they can do this out of the other and yes you have all these signs and wonders following he says you are deceived because our real spirit of God it would not go a contrary to the word of God amen and that's why he declared he says the most deceiving thing amen the last thing was the Pentecostals we know that you're the original we know there was God's move on to Susan Street I mean he says all 100 God nothing but God but it was the same black if the loser brought out in the same life that came up Wesley gave me in the same life the company Pentecost and made it all the way up to the shop all the way up to that seated looked like the city looked like the original Pentecost it looked like it but it was just the carrier now there's people in there saved but there's always that group that comes afterwards that the amen ends up dying isn't that right and that group afterwards they wouldn't accept Christ you talk about coming to fruition folks we can't blow my brother even better by himself loser's message won't work today Wesley's message won't work today Pentecost won't work today you've got to have a message come out of her my people that's the message and go into he says it's very deceiving when people can do signs and wonders they can have speaking in tongues and shouting and preachers preach the house now I have sat under preachers I could name their names probably could maybe this morning preachers that could preach man you're just man they just preach wow and be wrong and I could sit back there and I could say that man is wrong I don't care how much anointing is what he's saying is not according to what the prophet said when a few years later you're way off somewhere amen that's right how many you got to have discernment I don't care how much the anointing is can be the genuine Holy Ghost the rain falls on the just and the on Dust both the wheat and the Bears they already dies yeah they can do all of those they can decide some wonders it's a deceiving hour brother sisters but aren't you glad to say with what that Prophet said say what he said see what the Bible says stay with the word when you think about it and you can do that oh you ought to be the happiest person in the world how many beliefs you got to know who you are amen praise the Lord let's look at some first of all we're going to look at the bride and what she's going to have to have to be ready amen yeah right but first we want to look at another category of people found in Matthew 25. then we want to go back again with the help of the Lord with go to Revelations 3. and look at this church of the laodiceans and the category that he put him in can I just stop and pick up a quote I wanted to read to you before we get going then we'll go back to Matthew 25. but a bam says I like a good old-fashioned Pentecostal singing where you forget the when you get you can have don't have that get into all that kind of music of ritualistic put on program where you raise up your hands with tears running down your cheeks I don't care whether you can sing or not and just sing from the spirit from the heart and give praise to God not all out of a program you got to get out of man's program just to get in God's programs just get out of that oh my deliver me from being an actor be what you are amen God will bless you how many knows another place he says you know it's time that the people of God be who they are godspeed the day that everybody will be who they are I thought that's what I want to be I want to be who I am oh some people might think it's so hard to read a message believer oh man the message is so strict I want you to know it's what I am I love it people don't like to come to church I like to come to church I like to worship God it's what I am that's who I am I love the worship the God of all a creation be who you are don't tell impersonate don't try to be somebody else I thought that's why amen if you're a child of God worship God praise God be like God and people be like they are like oh uh Congressman nothing up so I said don't beat you can't be somebody or something that you ain't and I want you to know there's millions and billions of people that are trying to be Christians but they're not man it's hard to either be a Christian or be not amen praise the Lord haven't preached it for a while haven't had to have water for a while I guess we're preaching this morning amen you love the Lord I may believe that I like that time for the bride to be here she is because we ain't got much time left folks let me know so we ain't got time much time left if you ain't ready you better get ready no this is what means so much to me Brother John that if that's what you are you're one of those that God's gonna pick up there's gonna be something down in here to move I only believe God's moving God is moving across these people they're laying down their little nitbits and they're biggering and they're fussing and they're stewing and they're baby and they say no childishness room for the pride of Jesus Christ anymore little bitty doctrinal differences in the fusses and the stews and the fighting through big bunch of babies oh yeah oh can I go on this Loop oh my here we go hey man this lukewarm churches let me tell you something Amen to God will steal you out of your mouth out of his mouth we're not Matthew 25 we're not the we're not the foolish virgins we're the lies virgins foolish virgin they don't take no oil in their lamb amenity coming they're knocking the

Get Over Yonder we're going to worship like we never worshiped and we're getting ready that's what we're doing here this morning we're practicing practicing what we preach practicing worshiping God

underwear anymore why God's working on me it's Jesus on the inside making the outside right as it comes from the inside a dub amen the oil comes from the inside out it cleans me but this woman you talk about filthy let's talk about the filthiness of the devil's woman the devil's wife amen isn't that right let's start with Revelations 18. Revelations 18. we want to talk about this other side the tares isn't that right Revelations 18 one through five and after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having a great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory now I want you to understand brother Brandon was reading this in the God of this evil age and he's going to explain and identify this here all right and he cried mightily with his strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen and it's become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her remember just like Eve did let me know she committed fornications and the merchants of the Earth without wax Rich study abundance of her Delicacies I want you to understand you can read another place where Amen to Rome and Catholicism has all the gold of the world the Jews have the bonds amen you'll realize that that all of that riches all of your money everything it all goes back to the Antichrist he goes back to that church amen but the marches at wax Rich they all got drunk on the wine of the wrath of her fornication I want to read another one if I could revelation 17. and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials and talked with me seeing unto me come hither and I will show you the Judgment of the great that sitteth upon Mighty Waters boy he didn't get no more let me tell you this was not a washed woman this was not the Merit married or that Harlot that washed Jesus's feet and become clean isn't that right because she'd become a lady but this woman God still acknowledges her sir as a great oh my how many of those we could have never understood this if it would have been from Malachi 4. who this great was sinneth upon the many Waters with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication look out there how many knows everybody out there they're all drunk with fornication drunk with filthiness amen oh my and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication and he carried me away in the spirit and Wilderness I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy amen having seven heads and ten horns and the woman it was a raid in purple and Scarlet colored Deck with gold and precious stone and Pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of the Abominations and filthiness of her fornication praying to pop into Peter amen saying that Mary talking to Marion making her the intercessor instead of Christ for filthiness idolatry fornication and the forehead was the name written mystery Babylon the great the mother hello she's just a mother of harlots there's a bunch of heart let's she's just the mother of these harlots now tell me something these churches that'll let homosexuals in lesbians in and everything else who in the world do you think there's only school boards and these women where do you think they go to church at and they want to promote all of these drag queens coming to church polluting the whole world they've got a selfie they're dirty low down selfie my Harlot the Bible calls them claiming to be married to Christ running around shorts but the man says you know shorts are a woman's undergarment and she said that the man she got so much attention then she got her Adam she got her man to put him on he put them on so he'd get abducted he says he belongs to the big sister Society but sexy Society it's an Abomination for man to put on a woman in pertains to a woman's undergarment and it's an Abomination for a woman to wear that we should change some man but they say it's okay she can even preach come up in them pants and preach with your short hair and your makeup you abomination of filthiness God will never marry you hello yes oh my but let me tell you something denominations some cold form of them they're not the ones they're gonna deceive you or try this is you let me before is this I've got the quote somewhere no I didn't I didn't actually print it out but the BAM says you know we're not going to be these cold former churches that deceived the bride I mean or even come close to me but it's that which is right up they're close beside it I believe it's right within the ranks of the message people anointed not everything else you know but if it's not according to the word you remember it's Antichrist right up there close you better be careful oh my how we have gone off amen now notice that's right mother of harlots and Abominations of the earth and I saw the woman drunk him with the blood of the martyrs and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her I wondered with great admiration amen and if you'll notice that was the mother but in verse chapter 18 and now now let me go back I know the spread of abandoned reads this Reach This in Revelations 18 and verse 2 and he goes through verse 5 but I'm going to read two again and he cried mightily with a strong boy saying Babylon the great is Fallen he's fallen to become the habitation of that devils and the whole of every foul spirit all right now notice but about him he says now what a warning but after saying that come out of her my people that should be not particulars ever since every you receive not to replace that told the church exactly into Revelations 3 14 to laodice Lawless real religious but lawlessness because thou says I am rich and increase with goods and have me of nothing huh no it's not that they were wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked how many notes God did not have one good thing to say about the layout of their Church every other say other churches he says but this thou has thou hat is the Deeds of the Nickelodeon this that I have strengthened what you

and shall see no sorrow this is this your church with nothing less than the Pentecostals and the Pentecostals when they begin to leave the word it wasn't but a few different few short term to the Sun

Reckoning heaters over there reckon our brothers and sisters 20 feet stop right now are hearing us surprise me to God Amen we just saying what he said he said what Paul said we're saying what he said we're resting on that that's as far as we can go because we're not supposed to commune with them over there isn't that right which we don't actually communicate they're over there but that don't mean they can't hear us they can't see us ain't no telling amen Lord let me look past the curtain of time let me imagine past the curtain of time let me imagine over here let me imagine over there brother bourbon back in the back over there over there over there over there look at all them Angels around look at their wings they're trying to build Faith to get you to believe who you are amen you don't have to be like the world and not knowing whether you're a man or a woman you are a child and the Son of God or God [Applause] had you in his mind before the foundation of the world the only reason you're still standing and worshiping God is because your name is on The Book of Life ha ha ha ha ha amen time to quit and we ain't the half first half son yet you love the Lord amen even brother Danny's sermons are getting longer amen all right that's those that's right now notice perfectly the scripture for this age amen praise the Lord is not the age for Daniel not the age for Noah it's for this age I mean because it's important that you understand the word for this age for now for today now notice let this soak real in amen I may have a lot of disagreement on that but listen it's got to a place that a Christian can't hardly walk out of the house now but to be present be be brought into the presence of this evil age by insufficiently dressed women now we find that she is naked lewd nude the world seems to be the most evil age ever oh it wasn't so bad back then brother Brad but we can say that's how it is today it's more evil now than ever people have completely lost your mind they've gone completely insane like I said Wednesday used to be that the church I mean the the the the schools and so forth called our children that are home schooled a little weird folks go walk their aisles and find out weird and freaky stuff that's in there now wouldn't you just love to get up in there and say who's the weird one huh you bunch of devils doing that to our kids you warped it out you've completely gone mad and you belong right here in this world the insane asylum welcome to the insane asylum we say the whole world's gone crazy but I beg to differ there's still some left [Applause] there's still some left there's a Remnant left there's any lack left I still have joyous speak all and full of Glory that love God the fire's still burning when he got when God takes that out how many knows you are the blood of Christ the blood of Christ isn't us that's like keep it in from destroying if there's ten left I'm only shot three left I want this one one left I won't destroy it God is going to destroy the righteous with the wicked as long as we're here there's Ace can we say something to the world out there to the devil let's say this to the devil go ahead and push us out and see what happens can we repeat that go ahead devil push us out and see what happens God will destroy you 'll burn you burn you Constable fire they'll be whipping and wailing and gnashing of teeth because they're bundling right now angels are bundling them together for the burning but he's written ready to gather the wheat into the garden come on y'all don't get up so quick he's Gathering he's gonna gather the week that's right into the gardener we're about ready to go you and I have went through trials after trials after trials we've seen everything there is to be seen we've been hurt we've hurt each other and everything else in the book but it's time to put all wounds in the past it's time to put all sins in the past I mean have perfect love like I want you to have time to be a mature question I didn't go through all of that Tommy to be immature to be undone to be halfway finished to be halfway I mean says he says that God don't do halfway Christians no but people can't be halfway Christians can't be halfway why I taught you this enough that you should be able to answer me back why are people halfway and the correct answer is because the people have allowed their own ways to get in the way it's because of their own ways that are still mixed up in the plan of God that's why people are halfway but if I don't say nothing else to every one of us it's a checkpoint for us have you still got your some of your ways dependent plan of God and that's why you're still not seriously mature you're not the kind of fiery Christian that you ought to be because you still have some of your own ways speed limit too much I still do a little distance out of the other then I should come on folks you'll be honest you you know there's still things that you do we're not there yet Paul said I haven't arrived there yet but I press encountered it because he got that Mark Glory I don't want no part of her feel ings of fornication I don't want no part of her rich rich and increase with goods and have me of nothing I need more of God I need more I don't need nothing I tell you something I don't need anymore I need more I need more how many needs more this morning I need more of you more of you I've had it over but but this is more of you oh thoughts last the most I let go and let God have his way in your life I need more perfect case I need more of the token hey man God Ephesians let me just go on I mean if Ephesians talks about the church and then it's what she's supposed to be he gave us prophets and pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the edifying of the body of Christ until we come to the fullness of the stature of Jesus Christ that you be no more children that's costume and throw heads for it but you maybe grow up in him it's all things and become the fullness of him that filleth all the kind of God who got the kind of church he's looking for that's what he's coming for let's talk about the bride for a minute that all right for the perfecting of the Saints not the imperfecting that's what we come for the perfecting of the Saints you love him Peter said it this way for this they are willingly ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and you're standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that was then being overflowed with water perish but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire foreign folks if I could just get everybody in the world or every one of us we could just get it in our hearts that heavens and earth shall pass away but there's one thing that will never pass away and that is God's word and you have to be part of that God's word you have to be identified on the right side and if you're identified on the right side you ought to run the odds you want to jump scream and holler to know that you're not on the left side but you're on the right side you're part of that word heavens and there's a part of the word what God said he's gonna do is Gonna Come to pass it's gonna happen if he said he's gonna have a spot in that blessed behind that's right husband love your eyes as your own self even as Christ loved the church that he might sanctify and die for it they might signify it and watch it by the watching of The Wanted by the word and you and I are being washed by The Wonder of the word you can't be washed by Pentecostal water methodists have to loosen water you've got to have the message of the hour you got that some are thinking man's filter You've Got To Have Some Broken systems to realize that they're drinking on a broken sister stagnation but you're thinking out of the Everlasting image stream that flows it's fresh that become the church we're drinking fresh water every week every day you need some of that you need some thinking match filter so that you can run your life through the filter of the word of God amenity it'll bring you out holy and clean that's the bride he's looking for that's who he's coming for eign worship me the Lord you love him oh my praise be to God where were we yes Heaven's in Earth which are kept in store they're gonna pass away that's where the letter pass away if you could realize if you could if you could just know that get one thing in your head if you have doubt if you have frustrations know this one thing that whatever he said is going to happen many places he says I declare the future I think that are going to come I am God there is nothing else who's like me who can tell things that are going to come to come to pass enough devils in hell to ever change that what calm down but if he said if your name is on the book you're not going to be deceived you're going to make it and if you believe that your name is on the book what a glorious thing haven't heard us to pass away women's ever pass away the only kind that can be deceived the only kind that'll be lukewarm is of the wrong breed the wrong kind the wrong lineage amen that's sad isn't it Ma I don't want to be identified come to church for a while and then buy and buy you're offended and off you go I don't want to be a identified as a person who comes for one that's gone thousands of those hello that David go for a while but buy and buy the Bible says you know they don't have no root scary amen let me just go on down verse 10 but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heaven shall pass away with a great noise the elements should melt with firm and heat there's also in the work that therein shall be burned up saying that he seen them that all these things shall be dissolved what man or persons ought ye to be in a holy conversation and godliness looking for and Hasting unto the coming of the day of God who are in Heavens being on fire shall be dissolved I don't know about you but I'm seeing the heavens and the earth I am seeing such heat until everything just dissolved the heavens at the Earth is going to be dissolved but not you and I we're not being these off Sinners I'll be dissolved sickness will be dissolved sin and those that do iniquity be bundled and burned in that fire billions and billions of other rapses are being deceived by the Antichrist and they're all pile being piled up and bundled up for the burning folks amen nevertheless somebody said nevertheless nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new heavens and a new Earth our Focus isn't on resolving all of this but our focus is on the new heavens and the newer where in dweller's righteousness there ain't gonna be none of this pollution there ain't gonna be nothing this hypocrisy none of this whoremongering fornication world that we're living in spiritual adultery not taking the word of God taking man's ideas taking man's Creeds taking schools of theology by the band set over the Vindicated and proven word of the God has punched his whole human race into death that's why they are where they are it's because they would not have the Vindicated word like Jesus was when he was here to rule over them we don't want them ruling over us anybody going to their meetings will excommunicate Pentecostals even though Jesus would come down and vindicate himself like never before let me tell you something when Jesus Christ would come down and do what he did when he was here on Earth discern the thoughts intents and heart nobody can do that only God can do that he proved himself and then everything he preached was right according to the word for people that believe that sent their souls to hell brother Byler I want a scripture for that with all deceivableness and unrighteousness them in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved for this God's cause God shall strengthen them strongly illusions that they shall believe a lie and that they all might be damned to believe not the truth but have pleasure in unrighteousness hello you won't accept the truth there's only one way that you can go that's to accept the devil's lie the church world did it let me tell you something you can sit in those pews and the truth be told you and you can reject it according to the scriptures when you come into the message and then you turn on and turn on it you come to God and then turn on he says there's no more forgiveness for that kind of sin blasphemy amen Lord help us to believe every word every job every teller Hallelujah my world's heading to a climax let me go on has God lost control or is he just permitting another agency to control I wonder the true answer this question is to my opinion there's only two opposing spirits in the world today at work there can't be no more than two just two two heads the one of them is the holy spirit work and the other one is the spirit of the devil and in the last days of deception now I'm going to base my thoughts right on there for my text remember that's he went right back to Genesis I mean the very same line that he told the Eve is what he told to the church world huh you don't have to believe that I know Christ comes and vindicates it and he does Miracles and signs and he deserves up but you ain't got to believe what he preaches it's the word of God you better believe what he preaches and it was the word of God but they chose rather brother Bob said amen to believe man's theology that he had learned from some doctor of divinity in some Bible School that said the days of Miracle says this and the other and when they took that they damned themselves and they became the instrument by the band said they became the instrument the devil wanted to use and it is exalted the devil to the place that he wanted to be from the very start before the world ever begun when he kicked out of heaven he had a division that he had amen and it is to be exalted about the word of God right then Genesis he said Thou shalt not sure that I he wouldn't think oh my in Thessalonians there notice he opposes and exalted himself above all that is called the god or that is worship so that he has God's sinners in the temple God showing himself that he is God but the man says because of that amen millions and billions of people that's a big mouthful are worshiping God and don't know it not God the devil their God millions of people worshiping the devil and don't know it Jesus just didn't come and do this do all that he did so that people could say well I don't really need it no it discerned decided to Eternal destination but Abraham said one place he says people are now making their choice people on the Earth are now making their choice remember it was Mr best I believe it was that was wanting to debate with brother banham and he wouldn't and then or another Minister uh debated him and so forth and the the who was it remember what who the minister was that debated Mr best brother Bosworth you know I think it might have been Brothers he says I'll take him and he asked Mr best one question he said I want to ask you one question did the seven compound Redemptive names of Jehovah apply to Jesus because he was saying there is no more healing and so forth and so forth you know and and Mr best couldn't answer the first question isn't that right so finally at the end of it he couldn't even answer and he got up there and he says I challenge anybody to prove you know that you have been genuinely healed and the whole punch raised up he just shut him up that had been healed and so forth you know on this side of the other and he got all irate Amen in the head but about him did come off the angel said go out in the closing prayer he come up and close in prayer and Mr Ben had his photographers come up in his fingers and point the fingers and different things like that you know because he was going to make it look like he was a great one and then this is the only photograph that was developed the only one that ever came out was the one with the pillar of fire over his head that was not man that was Christ doing it that was almighty God doing it your attitude towards that man I'll tell you what people have had a bad attitude towards that and dropped dead and died in other words have believed and got healed just by believing the picture why because that's living that's God's testimony it was a terrible thing for the church world to reject Christ in this hour he said they have exalted the devil to the place anymore now you watch this no wonder he could call it lewd crew deceivableness filth and everything else you watch cold Core Go Plum to the core now by the band said back at 56-7 you watch Shin go to just go crazy or you and I are seeing it Amen brother bam that's nothing but the truth how many believes that that ain't nothing but the truth the two Spirits one of them God's holy spirit the other one's the devil Spirit working in deception the people of the Earth are now making their choice the holy spirit is here calling out a bride for Christ he's doing it by vindicating his Word of Promise to her for this age how many believe that oh one place he said because of the Vindication because of what Christ is doing that's what gives the bride rapturing faith to know that that's not just me it's not my homie fact I already got my minute I'm back home it's not Baptist it's not Methodist it's not Pentecostal it's Jesus Christ coming and proving that's why what's right and it gives you Faith to know that hey I we thought I know that I know that I know I don't have one channel but not anywhere it's all scattered because the light has been shining in the evening time laughs listen Church time to be mature this is the age to be ripe to be ready I mean believes it no playing Church no Dilly dallying no childishness amen if you expect to go amen I like this this is part of what's brought me to it is listen he's doing it by vindicating his Word of Promise to her for this age showing that it is Christ if the finger's supposed to move in this age the finger will move if the first supposed to move the foot will move into this age if the eye is supposed to see in this age yeah I will see how many of these we had as profit could tell you what color Eve's hair was instead of the other we had an IH but we went beyond that Beyond you know beyond that's what the mind up here went right back into this heels age he's talking about being in the age of the seals let me let me just read it to you here now notice now notice if the eyes see the spirit of God it's growed into the full stature of God the age that we're now living in the Holy Spirit is here indicating the message of the hour the Holy Spirit here is doing this so that the people that believe God will be called out of this chaos foreign to be out of the chaos listen to everybody in here and on stream and if you're in chaos come out of the house God don't call you the chaos it comes to bring you perfect peace perfect Joy perfectly in the Holy Ghost don't be in chaos the devil's Unholy spirit is here calling his church by the error that simple little air of believing the devil's lie he's calling his church as usual by perversion of the word of God like he did at the beginning see it coming right back again to that sea time again from Eden here it is again Eden was brought the whole human race into a fallen condition by disbelieving one word prophet of God well Jesus said when he was here man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God I don't hurt me to do this uh bye off the hill you go it does if it's contrary to the word your soul brother bam said is hanging over Hell by every word you just leave one word off and you're gone just one word just just leave one word look at all the doors they disbelieved they won't even believe their own eyes I'm going to discernment Goes Forth and Jesus comes out and brother Brahm says I'm just your brother if you love me don't say I'm a great prophet or this Reverend Branham or this he didn't even ask for you to call him Reverend you just said call me brother but I'm waiting on who him and if you think you can do a better job and you want to be critical of this you come up here and then you do this remember that because he knew that they probably fall dead over quicker than God was going to vindicate them because he was they weren't there whenever brother Bannon was seven years old and the angel come in that tree and said don't drink or smoke or defy your body and forth for you I have a work for you when you get older ah that was God saying that by the time I look forward to the day of judgment all these doubters all these Apes will be played back God's going to show him yeah that was me doing that yeah that was me showing that you didn't believe this you didn't believe that you didn't believe that huh you won't believe the iPhone you couldn't believe your own eyes the prophet of God said man these people amen they're they're seeing they know the sun is shining but they're going in the basement closing up all the windows and they're saying The Sun Ain't Shining he said that's how blind they are that's how terrible The Human Condition was they're trying to say it ain't so rich absolutely so that's the patheticness of human beings folks and blindness of the devil amen praise the Lord if the Antichrist in the beginning there in its infancy infancy of Disobedience remember all of this happens in the children of Disobedience people don't want to do what God tells them to do so now they give it over to a a delusion how can I just stop for a minute can you imagine that a person hears the truth and says oh wow yeah but I don't want to believe that because my church don't teach that all right and then God goes in that man's mind or that woman's mind and he twists it to where he says no I don't really believe that he actually changes their minds the Bible says he sends gives him strong delusion that they would believe and lie okay you don't want to believe the truth I'm gonna live I'm gonna make you I'm gonna make you believe a lie and be damned by it God it says God send them strong delusion strong delusionism how many knows that's not something very obvious out there it's a very much of a delusion they think they're right I mean those Pentecostals no church World they thought it was right to have the women up here in pants and just cut hair and make up and everything else and preached in the gospel who did the methodists have back there folks I can't imagine going into one of them church and having to wonder what's up there huh it's terrible folks brother Ben says that this has come because of that condition of that laodice and rejected and putting Christ out they had come to Revelations 18 they had become the cage of every unclean and hateful bird where do you think all of these liberals and all these leftists where do you think they go to church at oh look at how hateful they are I don't know I think this morning at 3 30 there's something else come to mind he says if you want to stay here one of these days this anger that they have the threats that they make yesterday will come after you and yes they will kill you if you're left behind and you want to still stand for your testimony and give your testimony or die for your testimony they will kill you you will be hunted down like dogs they said and killed oh yeah it's coming Lord help us to be ready how many wants to be ready I never finish this let me finish this and we'll let you go okay y'all have done real good SAT very long very

everything will be burned on see you then then all these things shall be dissolve what man a person's ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and Hasting unto the coming of
