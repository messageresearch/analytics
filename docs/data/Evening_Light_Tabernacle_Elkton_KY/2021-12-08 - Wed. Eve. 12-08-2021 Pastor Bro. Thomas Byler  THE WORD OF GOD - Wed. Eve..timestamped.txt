[26:09] guidance and your leadership tonight
[26:12] into speaking and also with the hearers
[26:13] lord we ask oh god that you would open
[26:16] up that second set of ears
[26:18] lord that they might be able to hear for
[26:20] we know that some heavy ears but they
[26:21] hear not lord help us to have ears that
[26:24] can hear lord but the spirit saith to
[26:26] your people
[26:28] blessed your word now for we ask in
[26:30] jesus name
[26:31] amen and amen
[26:33] amen turn your bibles and we want to
[26:35] continue our series
[26:36] amen again this will be a thought coming
[26:39] off our series
[26:40] and uh it's going to be on
[26:44] uh his title or his word another one of
[26:46] his names all right another something
[26:49] that he's called i think i'll read one
[26:52] scripture because i want to
[26:54] let's just go read the whole thing while
[26:55] we're at it
[26:57] over in revelations we'll go to it first
[26:59] let's go to revelations and see what the
[27:01] name is that we want to deal with
[27:02] tonight the title is that we want to
[27:04] deal with with the help of the lord
[27:11] and now we understand that in the 19th
[27:13] chapter of revelations is when the bride
[27:16] comes back to earth again with christ
[27:18] how many believes that
[27:20] that's right she goes up in the third
[27:21] chapter comes back in the 19th chapter
[27:24] according to the prophet of god
[27:26] and so
[27:28] uh
[27:28] you know it
[27:30] and i want to skip on a lot of that you
[27:32] know about that but it talks about a
[27:34] great multitude of people saying
[27:36] hallelujah and so forth but i want to go
[27:38] and jump over to
[27:41] verse 11
[27:43] and
[27:44] if you want to understand this 19th
[27:46] chapter of revelations
[27:49] a little better
[27:50] and the battle that partakes that we're
[27:53] going to be a part of
[27:55] after the marriage supper you'll have to
[27:57] look under i believe it's the
[28:00] fifth seal i'm thinking it's the fifth
[28:02] or sixth it might be the sixth seal
[28:04] anyway i'd have to go back to say for
[28:06] sure but it's one of those ladder seals
[28:08] brother branham explains the 19th
[28:11] chapter and how it is
[28:12] how do we come back with christ to fight
[28:15] that battle of armageddon
[28:17] with him
[28:19] and so just imagine this now
[28:21] as we read this
[28:23] uh you'll find several names several
[28:25] titles that god has here but we want to
[28:28] focus on one of them tonight
[28:31] and that's verse 11 of chapter 19 of
[28:33] revelations and i saw heaven opened
[28:36] and behold a white horse and he that sat
[28:38] upon him was faithful and true was
[28:42] called
[28:43] faithful and true so there's one title
[28:44] already
[28:45] and in righteousness does he judge
[28:49] and make war well i'd like to stop there
[28:51] a little bit but i don't get people too
[28:53] much but can you imagine
[28:55] there's going to be some problems my
[28:57] friend when god declare war
[29:00] god is going to declare war
[29:03] when he declares war folks you ain't
[29:05] seen nothing
[29:08] amen it it's going to be quite a sight
[29:11] and i'm going to tell you right now i'm
[29:12] going to be
[29:13] one of his soldiers don't you i want to
[29:16] be on his side
[29:17] because this is where the prophet of god
[29:19] talked about they'll the ones that
[29:20] fought the word of god will one day find
[29:24] the word fighting them amen
[29:27] all right
[29:29] his eyes were as a flame of fire and on
[29:32] his head
[29:33] were
[29:34] many
[29:35] crowns amen
[29:38] amen so he has he's a champion right of
[29:42] many things right
[29:43] so he's got the crowns of many things
[29:47] many crowns
[29:48] and he had a name written that no man
[29:50] knew but he himself
[29:52] and he was closed with a vesture
[29:55] dipped in blood and his name
[29:59] is called say it with me
[30:02] the word of god
[30:06] amen so you can imagine coming from the
[30:09] heavens of heavens with all of the
[30:11] armies of heaven
[30:12] and on his vesting on his thighs name
[30:15] called
[30:17] the
[30:18] word of
[30:20] god
[30:23] that's what we want to speak on tonight
[30:24] with the help of the lord and the armies
[30:26] which were in heaven followed him upon
[30:29] horses
[30:30] clothed in
[30:32] fine linen white and clean i wanted to
[30:35] stop there and ask you a question
[30:36] tonight
[30:38] how did they get their clothes white and
[30:40] clean
[30:46] okay
[30:47] we read it just a couple scriptures back
[30:50] what was he dipped in
[30:52] blood that's right we were made white
[30:55] blood by the blood of the lamb amen
[30:58] that's why his bestie was dipped in
[31:00] blood because it represented that that
[31:04] is what he cleaned the saints with
[31:06] every how many knows that's where it all
[31:07] hinges on
[31:08] amen without dense shedding of blood
[31:11] there is no remissions there have been
[31:12] no salvation outside of that shed blood
[31:15] amen everything's significant and out of
[31:18] his mouth goes a sharp sword how many
[31:22] knows you got a word you got to watch
[31:24] these a little bit
[31:25] because a lot of these are symbols like
[31:27] many crowns i don't see that it's going
[31:29] to have a stack of them huh
[31:32] maybe i don't know i'm not saying that
[31:34] it isn't but a lot of times it's
[31:35] symbolic
[31:36] he's a champion of much just like here
[31:39] he's this sharp sword coming out of his
[31:41] mouth it's not going to have a sharp
[31:43] sword sticking out there i don't believe
[31:45] because a little bit later it explains
[31:47] what it is
[31:48] that with it he should smite the nations
[31:50] and he shall rule them with a rod of
[31:52] iron he treadeth the winepress of the
[31:55] fierceness of the wrath
[31:57] of almighty god
[32:00] you know the world just hasn't had a
[32:02] taste of that yet have they
[32:04] but when those volcanoes erupt when the
[32:07] earth shakes all the cities of the earth
[32:10] get shaken down
[32:12] they'll feel the wrath of god
[32:15] uh all the mambo jumbo the bragging the
[32:18] big talk it's all gonna shut up
[32:21] amen
[32:22] and he had on his vesture and on his
[32:24] thigh a name written
[32:27] maybe it's the other side of the horse i
[32:29] don't know but here's another name on
[32:30] his vegetarian thigh right
[32:32] it says
[32:33] king of kings
[32:35] and lord of lords
[32:37] amen and i saw an angel standing
[32:41] in the sun and he cried with a loud
[32:43] voice saying unto all the fowls that fly
[32:46] in the midst of heaven come and gather
[32:48] yourself together
[32:50] unto the supper
[32:52] of the great god
[32:56] they may eat the flesh of kings
[33:03] and the flesh of captains and the flesh
[33:06] of mighty men
[33:07] the flesh of horses and them that sit
[33:09] upon them and the flesh of all men both
[33:12] free and bond both small and great
[33:15] and i saw the beasts and the kings of
[33:17] the earth and their armies gathered
[33:20] together to make war with him that sat
[33:23] on the horse and against his army
[33:26] and the beast was taken and with him the
[33:29] false prophet that wrought miracles
[33:31] before him with him he deceived with
[33:34] which he deceived them that had received
[33:36] the mark of the beast and then which
[33:38] worshipped his mark
[33:39] these boats were cast alive into the
[33:41] lake
[33:42] of fire burning with brimstone
[33:45] and the remnant were slain with the
[33:48] sword of him that sat upon the horse
[33:52] whose sword
[33:53] proceeded out of his mouth and all the
[33:55] fowls were
[33:57] filled with their flesh
[34:00] may god add his blessings to the reading
[34:02] of the words you can be seated
[34:05] amen
[34:08] you love him tonight
[34:12] you know i want to just say a couple
[34:13] things maybe that come to my mind
[34:16] because
[34:19] most of us we've been church goers
[34:21] probably for
[34:22] i don't know
[34:24] all our life perhaps
[34:27] some of us
[34:30] and
[34:31] service after service after service one
[34:33] place brother bam says american people
[34:35] they've just been preached to death
[34:39] preached to death
[34:41] huh i thought about that you know
[34:43] preaching so much until
[34:45] you know
[34:46] they get tired of it perhaps or
[34:49] you know they get cold perhaps
[34:52] or just i thought of it as being
[34:54] preached a lot too
[34:56] you know and you think well you know and
[34:58] if you aren't careful you come to church
[35:00] and
[35:01] you think well he's just going to say a
[35:02] lot of words it's going to be a lot of
[35:03] lot sad a lot of things going to be sad
[35:05] again and just a lot of talk
[35:08] huh
[35:11] you know and i thought you know i hope
[35:13] we never get like that i hope it's never
[35:15] that for you
[35:17] i hope it's never that for me
[35:19] because it isn't just a bunch of talk
[35:21] isn't just a bunch of philosophy
[35:24] but the bible says that by the
[35:26] foolishness of preaching god
[35:28] you know has chosen to save those that
[35:30] are lost
[35:31] it's not just for empty words it's not
[35:33] just coming together for another service
[35:36] no it's coming to worship the lord
[35:38] in spirit and in truth i mean he
[35:40] believes that to come to give honor and
[35:42] glory and it's not something that we
[35:44] just hear externally or
[35:47] tantalize our brain
[35:50] intellectually but it's our soul
[35:53] giving glory back to god
[35:55] praising god
[35:56] and watching god work in our lives amen
[36:00] and transforming
[36:02] amen transforming
[36:04] if y'all have a pen remember this i'd
[36:05] like for everybody here and on uh out
[36:08] there on what am i going to call it i
[36:10] don't know what internet world or
[36:12] whatever
[36:13] facebook or whatever anybody that's
[36:15] listening to this i'd like at least our
[36:16] congregation for the most part i heard a
[36:18] tape that i really liked maybe it won't
[36:20] affect you like it did me but brother
[36:22] branham had a real good perspective on
[36:24] life i think it was after his mother
[36:25] died
[36:26] and so forth but it's a message either
[36:29] in 61 or 60 60 or 61 i don't know that
[36:32] there was more than one of these sermons
[36:34] preached but it's called the testimony
[36:35] of a true witness
[36:37] the testimony of a true witness amen
[36:40] it's a very very good tape and so if you
[36:43] can try to listen to that maybe before
[36:45] sunday amen
[36:47] but i don't want i just say lord help us
[36:50] that you know of all that we hear how
[36:52] many knows it's easy to allow things to
[36:54] become too common to us
[36:57] amen coming to church too coming to us
[37:00] wednesday night gets bored
[37:02] well yeah you know it's
[37:05] [Music]
[37:07] it's wanna go
[37:10] and your spirit says go
[37:12] how many know it
[37:14] it has to be down in our soul this needs
[37:17] to come from
[37:18] amen
[37:19] all right so now
[37:21] let's look at this now i want to speak
[37:23] about
[37:24] something that would really
[37:26] really take
[37:29] when i was looking up some quotes of
[37:31] brother ben and he was talking about if
[37:33] god just says one thing
[37:35] you could actually preach on that or
[37:37] speak that for that for millions of
[37:39] years
[37:40] just perhaps one thing that god would
[37:42] say
[37:44] so when we talk about the word of god we
[37:46] realize that
[37:48] in another place he says it just
[37:50] continues on and on and on in some words
[37:53] a lot of the word has a compound meaning
[37:56] and i kind of get the idea of what it
[37:59] means for that word for taking perhaps
[38:01] one thought one word you could just take
[38:03] you could take this word that's the word
[38:05] of god just that phrase
[38:08] and and and i begin to think
[38:11] you know how that and now i go to the
[38:13] scripture it says that there was not
[38:14] anything created that wasn't created by
[38:16] the word of god
[38:18] so you can start there and think about
[38:20] that
[38:21] everything that was ever made or ever
[38:24] will be made was made by god's word
[38:29] amen so much so until the one riding on
[38:32] that horse and so forth called the word
[38:34] of god
[38:36] all the way to talking about uh you know
[38:38] how that a a word we all understand
[38:42] that
[38:42] before
[38:43] a word before it's a word what is it
[38:48] it's a thong
[38:49] and i was back there in the study and i
[38:51] was thinking you know
[38:53] is there anybody in here that can speak
[38:55] faster than you can think
[39:03] and i thought the answer was no but it's
[39:05] actually yes
[39:08] what happens when you speak faster than
[39:10] you think
[39:13] no your foot ends up in your mouth
[39:15] [Applause]
[39:18] we all experienced that right
[39:20] we we smoked
[39:22] while we called before we thought
[39:25] we should have thought a little more
[39:26] before we said it now that foot end up
[39:28] in our mouth
[39:30] so that's the only way i know of that we
[39:32] could actually
[39:33] think faster than what we speak is
[39:34] sometimes we're so quick to
[39:36] but the bible says slow to speak
[39:39] be slow to speak
[39:41] swift to what
[39:43] to hear
[39:45] be slow to speak swift to here be
[39:47] careful what you say
[39:49] and half the time and now we got to
[39:51] watch it up here brother brad don't we
[39:52] sometimes we gotta you know sometimes
[39:54] we'll just say things perhaps and and
[39:56] say oh why did i say that
[39:59] i should have thought twice
[40:02] can i give you an example
[40:04] and i did this at another church and i
[40:06] ain't been back so i don't know if this
[40:08] is why but
[40:09] i talked about people that are still
[40:11] having eight track takes or kind of the
[40:12] horse and buggy age
[40:18] you know that's it's you know and i
[40:20] think before i said i said does anybody
[40:23] have eight tracks yet you know somebody
[40:24] raised their hand you know this but
[40:25] that's so you know nowadays you don't
[40:27] have to do that you can have it on your
[40:28] phone and just push the button there it
[40:30] is
[40:32] i thought later as is that could have
[40:33] offended him
[40:36] how why i have to i think you're sitting
[40:38] here on my bed why didn't you have to
[40:40] say that first year getting them to find
[40:41] out who they are and then you say
[40:42] they're in the horse and buggy age you
[40:44] know
[40:45] i'm like my
[40:47] my point was is with the technology and
[40:49] so forth you know you can have it right
[40:51] at your fingertips
[40:53] you can have it going down the road
[40:55] you can have it everywhere and that's
[40:57] good
[40:58] and how many believes that's good
[41:00] but you know when it comes to technology
[41:02] and this is going away and off the
[41:03] course but is that all right maybe
[41:04] somebody needs it
[41:06] but when it comes to technology i heard
[41:08] the prophet say sometimes all of this
[41:09] modern stuff is as good as for us is
[41:11] what we think
[41:13] huh sometimes it's not as good as what
[41:15] we think
[41:16] amen
[41:18] so anyway all right
[41:21] so yeah sometimes we can
[41:26] think generally
[41:29] speaking
[41:30] generally speaking generally speaking i
[41:33] cannot
[41:34] say it until i think it
[41:36] right
[41:38] first it goes through here
[41:40] every word you think everything you're
[41:41] going to say comes in here first
[41:44] and that's the way it is with god i mean
[41:46] that's how it was
[41:48] with god before he ever spoke the first
[41:50] word
[41:53] you know i was glad that i heard prophet
[41:55] god say it the other day because
[41:57] all the time all the times i've preached
[41:58] to you about god being infinite and how
[42:00] that you can't figure it out
[42:02] god be an omniscient you can't figure it
[42:04] out i even heard the prophecy man if you
[42:06] tried to figure that out you just can't
[42:08] of him being infinite knowing all things
[42:10] it's just too much for your mind
[42:13] i have another one for you to stretch
[42:15] your mind with
[42:16] are you ready
[42:20] how
[42:21] [Applause]
[42:22] can god
[42:24] think the perfect thoughts the first
[42:26] time
[42:28] because you know on me you know like me
[42:30] and you
[42:32] we we we're not we're not able to do
[42:33] that a lot of times we can't think of it
[42:35] perfect at the same time
[42:37] you know i i'm in construction and i've
[42:40] been doing certain things a certain way
[42:41] and my son if they'd want to do it a
[42:44] different way man that is wrong that
[42:45] will never work
[42:49] huh
[42:50] but yet they'll do it it works just fine
[42:52] and i'm like wow
[42:54] if i just realized you know not my first
[42:56] thoughts aren't always perfect they can
[42:59] always be
[43:00] gotten better things you can do things
[43:02] better
[43:04] but with god when he thinks
[43:06] it is absolutely he never has to
[43:08] negotiate he never have to figure it out
[43:13] so i don't know about you but i can't
[43:14] figure god thinking out it's just too
[43:17] perfect for me but he is perfect and
[43:18] they think he never thinks the wrong
[43:20] thought
[43:22] amen
[43:23] and we find out brothers and sisters how
[43:25] many knows we found out through malachi
[43:27] 4 that if you wasn't in that thinking
[43:30] before the first stardust was ever made
[43:32] if he was not in his thinking
[43:34] then you never will be
[43:38] why do i say that where is my authority
[43:41] to say that in revelations i believe
[43:43] it's uh 13 8 somewhere in there it says
[43:46] all wondered after the beast whose names
[43:49] were not written in the lamp book of
[43:50] life from the foundation of the world
[43:55] if you was chosen you was chosen before
[43:57] the world ever began
[44:01] churches will have an altar call and
[44:02] people will go to the altar
[44:06] amen
[44:08] oh my
[44:10] did y'all find it
[44:13] all right
[44:14] 13 80.
[44:15] i think i had it right
[44:18] and they'll say well there's well look
[44:20] at there
[44:21] he we got somebody giving the heart to
[44:23] the lord there's another name written in
[44:25] heaven tonight he says that ain't right
[44:28] no that name was written and he's just
[44:30] being redeemed tonight
[44:32] just the same as when christ
[44:35] your salvation amen how many knows
[44:37] you're already saved
[44:39] you know the map said you were saved
[44:40] from the foundation world
[44:43] you saved when he gave his blood on
[44:44] calvary
[44:46] he was saved 2 000 years ago
[44:49] it's already done
[44:51] it's just that you recognize it at a
[44:53] certain time in a certain hour
[44:56] he even said you're not per mourn on a
[44:58] certain day
[45:00] amen he was born again before the
[45:02] foundation of the world in god's mind
[45:04] i'm getting a little loud here is that
[45:05] okay
[45:06] are they cranking me up so you can hear
[45:08] me
[45:08] all right i can hear myself better now
[45:12] all right
[45:13] before the foundation of the world
[45:17] he thought of you and wrote your name
[45:20] down
[45:22] and that's where he chose you long
[45:23] before you chose him
[45:26] amen long before but he knew who you
[45:28] would be what you would be
[45:31] my
[45:32] y'all are making it easy for me to
[45:34] preach
[45:35] i haven't even started my subjects i got
[45:37] about four or five thoughts with the
[45:38] help of the lord
[45:40] all right
[45:42] let's start with
[45:45] creation verse shall we let's go to
[45:46] first john
[45:48] not first john
[45:49] john the first chapter
[45:59] john and then also hebrews the 4th not
[46:02] the 4th the 11th hebrews 11 after that
[46:05] we'll read the first couple of verses
[46:09] in the beginning
[46:10] was
[46:11] the word
[46:13] and the word was
[46:15] with god
[46:17] huh
[46:18] i don't know was it in his thoughts
[46:21] was the word still in his thoughts it
[46:23] was with god
[46:25] and the word was god
[46:30] and the same was in the beginning with
[46:32] god all things were made by him and
[46:35] without him was not anything made that
[46:38] was made
[46:40] amen
[46:41] down in verse 14 it says and the word
[46:44] was made flesh
[46:46] and dwelt among us
[46:49] and we beheld his glory glory as of the
[46:52] only begotten of the father full of
[46:53] grace and truth
[46:54] so we see that when christ how many
[46:56] knows that in one place the scripture
[46:58] talks about it i'm thinking it was saint
[47:00] john the last one on the 16th or 17th
[47:03] chapter where he talks about that even
[47:05] his christ was crucified
[47:07] before the foundation of the world even
[47:10] though the works were done before the
[47:11] foundation of the world
[47:13] but here he was made manifest the word
[47:16] became flesh
[47:19] amen
[47:22] you know the more i got to thinking
[47:23] about this tonight the more i realized
[47:26] that sometimes we perhaps don't
[47:28] appreciate the word the way that we
[47:30] should
[47:31] i do know the prophet god said you know
[47:33] no true christian is any stronger than
[47:37] his adherence to
[47:39] the true world
[47:41] so when you see somebody that is not
[47:44] strongly adhered to the word of god
[47:47] remember they're going to be a weak
[47:48] christian
[47:50] not really important
[47:52] not really adhere the way that it's
[47:54] supposed to be
[47:59] but when you
[48:00] oh my
[48:02] because listen
[48:04] i want to say this this is the only
[48:06] truth there is in the world everything
[48:08] else is a lie
[48:10] even his word to let man's word be a lie
[48:12] and mind the truth
[48:14] this here we my how that we could just
[48:17] have a whole pages of what this word
[48:19] really is
[48:20] how did it so infallible it's so perfect
[48:25] now not one flaw in it it is so flawless
[48:29] until jesus when he talked about the
[48:30] infallibility of the word said the
[48:33] heavens
[48:34] are going to pass away
[48:36] the earth is going to pass away that's a
[48:39] lot that's cataclysmic
[48:41] the heavens and the earth are going to
[48:43] pass away but my word will never pass
[48:47] away
[48:51] again back on the unendingness of god
[48:54] the unendingness of of god's word and
[48:57] what he said and his testimonies
[49:00] as a preacher of 30 years i've learned
[49:02] and you've heard it
[49:04] how that you could take
[49:05] david shaddock meshach nabindigo one of
[49:08] our favorite characters daniel
[49:11] and and israel at the red sea and we
[49:14] have taken
[49:15] all kinds of different things that we've
[49:17] pulled out of there not just one we'll
[49:19] think well you know
[49:21] the trials were set to test them and try
[49:23] their faith you know
[49:24] but there was so many other things that
[49:26] we've pulled out of there
[49:28] if time goes on maybe we'll even pull
[49:30] more out of there
[49:34] because it's unending
[49:38] infallible
[49:42] now let me go to another part
[49:44] because as we talk about the
[49:45] infallibility of the word it's
[49:47] infallible
[49:49] not even the problem of god
[49:51] said and it's true that if one if god
[49:54] god a man is only as good as his word
[49:57] god is only as good as his word if he
[49:59] doesn't keep his word
[50:02] then he's not god
[50:04] if he lies he's not god
[50:07] amen
[50:09] and he keeps his word
[50:10] god keeps his word
[50:12] and let me ask you one more let me ask
[50:14] one more thing in class you should know
[50:17] what is the bible what is the word of
[50:19] god
[50:21] think about it
[50:27] what is this
[50:31] uh it's not really fair because i got in
[50:33] my mind and you don't have it yours
[50:35] it's god
[50:38] in letter form
[50:42] it's god
[50:43] in letter form
[50:46] that's right
[50:48] so i'm holding god
[50:51] in letter form
[50:54] praise god
[50:56] can you imagine the responsibility
[50:59] i want to get to the new birth in a
[51:00] minute but let me just say one more
[51:02] thing
[51:10] because
[51:13] there has to be some absolute there has
[51:15] to be something that the world is going
[51:16] to be judged by
[51:18] right the world has to be judged by
[51:20] something and as the prophet put it he
[51:23] says he can't be the baptist
[51:25] because there's so many different kinds
[51:26] of baptist
[51:28] huh
[51:29] methodist presbyterian can't be one
[51:32] church or the other all the others will
[51:34] be lost
[51:35] right
[51:37] so it has to be one place
[51:39] the bible says he's going to judge the
[51:41] world by jesus christ that's what the
[51:43] bible says and jesus christ is the word
[51:48] right
[51:54] is it okay to just have a little class
[51:56] on wednesday
[51:57] what else
[51:59] what else is the word of god
[52:02] what can you think of else that would be
[52:03] the word of god
[52:11] this just come to me and so i i know
[52:13] that you know a lot but and you'll know
[52:15] exactly what it is whenever i say it but
[52:18] it is god's pardon
[52:21] right
[52:22] the word of god is god's pardon to every
[52:26] person in the world
[52:30] everybody
[52:32] god pardoned
[52:34] everybody
[52:38] how did he do this
[52:41] when people come up to heaven
[52:44] and they come on the day of judgment
[52:46] and say
[52:48] well i didn't know
[52:51] oh wouldn't that sound like a good
[52:53] ignorance is a good excuse
[52:56] do you know the one quote the one
[52:58] scripture that jesus can test
[53:00] them with to find out whether they're
[53:02] really
[53:03] guilty or not
[53:05] what's the one scripture that jesus can
[53:08] repeat
[53:09] and say do you know this scripture
[53:14] if they know that scripture
[53:16] it'll have been their pardon this should
[53:17] be easier for you now
[53:20] very good
[53:22] john 3 16.
[53:24] all he has to do is say did you ever
[53:26] hear of the scripture john 3 16.
[53:29] oh you mean the one for god said love
[53:31] the world that he gave his only begotten
[53:32] son whosoever should believe in him
[53:33] should not perish but i remember that's
[53:35] it
[53:37] see you didn't know
[53:40] that was your pardon i pardoned you
[53:45] um and it'll be exactly like that story
[53:48] the prophet told about the uh person in
[53:50] a civil war that was had the young guys
[53:52] and he left his post of duty he was so
[53:54] scared he ran left his post of duty amen
[53:57] and they were going to shoot him for it
[53:59] and his buddy went to abraham lincoln
[54:01] got a pardon got a piece of paper and he
[54:03] signed that and said i pardoned so and
[54:05] so he took it to the boy and the boy
[54:07] says no you're just fooling with me
[54:09] you're just kidding me and mocking me
[54:14] i don't know what i would do if i was in
[54:16] that situation maybe i'd be so riled up
[54:18] i wouldn't want to accept it either but
[54:19] i'd grasp for every straw i could you
[54:21] would think
[54:24] i'd at least try wouldn't you
[54:26] take them show that to the warden
[54:29] go show that to the warden all the boy
[54:31] would've had to do is go and show it to
[54:33] the warden
[54:35] right
[54:37] and after they read it
[54:39] huh
[54:40] after they read it and they kill him
[54:43] they're in trouble
[54:44] they better check it out make sure that
[54:46] this is legit
[54:47] right
[54:50] but the boy didn't believe him so get
[54:51] out of here you're mocking me and the
[54:52] boy left
[54:54] next they they shot that man dead
[54:57] they went to the courts
[55:00] we had a good supreme court back then
[55:04] huh
[55:09] they didn't okay homosexuality
[55:16] oh brother bali you shouldn't say that
[55:18] yes you should
[55:19] that is wrong in every form fashion
[55:24] but anyway
[55:25] went to the supreme court and they said
[55:29] what are we going to do what's your
[55:30] what's your outcome the outcome is
[55:32] a pardon is not a pardon unless it's
[55:35] accepted as a pardon
[55:38] amen and when jesus christ says that to
[55:40] whoever
[55:41] if you've ever heard just and that's a
[55:43] popular scripture isn't it
[55:45] i'm glad god made it that popular so if
[55:48] you don't know any other scripture if
[55:50] you know just that scripture
[55:52] you'll be held accountable
[55:55] i didn't say for the jews only or for
[55:57] the gentiles
[55:59] or for the arabs or for the indian or
[56:02] whatever it might be i said whosoever
[56:05] will let him come
[56:12] amen
[56:13] i believe the prophet god said one place
[56:14] he says i glad that he put it didn't put
[56:16] it that way
[56:18] you know put your name in there like
[56:19] there's a lot of thomas pylers might
[56:21] have not been me oh my i miss it nobody
[56:24] said whosoever i am whosoever
[56:29] that's how one is one of them he opened
[56:31] it up
[56:32] to all
[56:35] amen
[56:36] and so
[56:37] this here is what's going to judge folks
[56:41] at the judgment day
[56:45] amen
[56:46] i can't get off of it but
[56:48] i just can't imagine what it's going to
[56:50] be like on that day can you
[56:52] when he looks at everyone says i died on
[56:55] calvary
[56:58] i gave my life so that you could go
[57:00] afraid why didn't you accept it
[57:03] why didn't you receive it even i'm
[57:05] loving god said that's going to be a
[57:06] major question god has for people why
[57:10] why
[57:11] why didn't he
[57:16] amen
[57:22] same way with cain
[57:24] why didn't he accept that when i came
[57:26] right up to your face
[57:28] and said do yours
[57:29] see your brother
[57:32] but he didn't want it
[57:34] something down here
[57:36] was wrong
[57:38] how many knows that's what the problem
[57:39] is something down here
[57:43] is wrong with people
[57:46] amen
[57:50] amen
[57:54] the importance of the new birth
[57:58] the importance of the new birth let's
[58:00] talk about that for a few minutes shall
[58:02] we
[58:14] let's go to st john
[58:18] three
[58:32] there was a name
[58:34] of the pharisees named nicodemus
[58:38] a ruler of the jews the same came to
[58:40] jesus by night and said unto him rabbi
[58:42] we know that our
[58:44] teach
[58:45] should come from
[58:47] from god for no man
[58:49] amen
[58:51] jesus answers and said unto him verily
[58:53] verily i say unto you except a man be
[58:55] born again he he cannot see the kingdom
[58:57] of god
[58:58] nicodemus said on
[59:00] to him how can a man be born when he is
[59:02] old can he enter the second time into
[59:04] his mother's room and be born
[59:06] jesus answers verily verily i say unto
[59:09] you except the man be born of water and
[59:11] a spirit he cannot enter into the
[59:14] kingdom of god now notice this is what i
[59:16] want to get to here because
[59:18] i want to read over in first peter also
[59:22] that which is born of flesh is flesh
[59:28] and that which is born of spirit is
[59:31] spirit
[59:33] amen i believe that tonight
[59:36] if you haven't got the holy ghost i
[59:38] don't care how much you try to act like
[59:40] you're still just flesh
[59:44] amen
[59:46] so our birth
[59:48] has to be
[59:49] of what
[59:51] the word
[59:53] amen
[59:54] over in first peter
[59:57] 1
[1:00:05] verse 22
[1:00:08] seeing that you have purified your souls
[1:00:10] and obeying the truth through the spirit
[1:00:12] unto unframed love of the brethren see
[1:00:15] that he loved one another with a pure
[1:00:17] heart fervently
[1:00:19] being borned again not of corruptable
[1:00:23] seed but of incorruptible
[1:00:26] now he knows our first birth was
[1:00:28] corruptible carnal fleshly
[1:00:31] oh my when you look at glaciers about
[1:00:33] the lust of the flesh and the attributes
[1:00:35] of the flesh with all kinds of horrible
[1:00:37] terrible things
[1:00:42] now look at this
[1:00:46] even
[1:00:47] your birth
[1:00:49] it says
[1:00:52] being born again verse 23
[1:00:55] not of corruptible
[1:00:57] seed
[1:00:58] but of incorruptible
[1:01:01] by the word of god
[1:01:08] come on y'all hang on to your seats
[1:01:11] think about it
[1:01:13] what is it that can't pass away
[1:01:17] the word of god
[1:01:20] and if you are born by the word of god
[1:01:23] can you pass away
[1:01:25] did the prophet what the prophet god he
[1:01:27] says you can no more pass away than god
[1:01:29] can pass away
[1:01:31] because you have been born by the word
[1:01:34] of god
[1:01:35] your very birth is the word of god
[1:01:41] amen
[1:01:44] oh my
[1:01:50] four
[1:01:52] ever
[1:01:56] do you realize that
[1:01:59] if you joined the amish church
[1:02:02] they claimed to have the
[1:02:04] they claimed to be nyan village
[1:02:11] see
[1:02:11] dengue and
[1:02:13] highly hashed
[1:02:15] they think they're born again they think
[1:02:17] they got the holy ghost
[1:02:19] huh
[1:02:22] but what are they really
[1:02:26] let me just make a statement
[1:02:29] anybody that will take their church
[1:02:33] idea
[1:02:34] when it's contrary to the word
[1:02:37] uh
[1:02:38] is not born of the word
[1:02:41] they're born of their church
[1:02:44] they're born on amish a mennonite
[1:02:47] the presbyterian whatever it is you're
[1:02:50] not born by the word of god you are born
[1:02:52] by that church
[1:02:53] because you
[1:02:54] esteem that higher than the word of god
[1:03:02] this is what the prophet taught us
[1:03:04] this is what the bible teaches
[1:03:07] there is nothing higher than the word of
[1:03:09] god
[1:03:12] and jesus he said this
[1:03:14] this way that man not to live by man's
[1:03:18] tradition
[1:03:19] they he said do my man tradition have
[1:03:22] made the word of god of none effect to
[1:03:24] the people
[1:03:26] oh my
[1:03:28] but he said man shall not live by bread
[1:03:30] alone but by once in a while a word some
[1:03:33] of the word
[1:03:35] no jesus said you've got to live by
[1:03:38] every word of god
[1:03:41] no word that proceedeth out of the mouth
[1:03:44] of god
[1:03:46] shall men live by
[1:03:51] i'm sure we're all in a hearts mind
[1:03:53] saying lord that's my heart's desire
[1:03:57] i want to live by every one of your
[1:03:59] words
[1:04:01] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:04:03] mouth god
[1:04:04] if you expect to go into rapture here or
[1:04:07] wherever you are out there you better be
[1:04:09] getting more and more like the word
[1:04:13] [Music]
[1:04:16] adhering more and more to the word of
[1:04:19] god because one of these days we're
[1:04:21] going to meet him face to face
[1:04:24] and in order to be united with him we
[1:04:27] have to be just like him
[1:04:35] that's quite something folks
[1:04:40] how many know jesus said
[1:04:42] you know any man that doesn't have the
[1:04:44] spirit of god is none of his
[1:04:47] if you are born again and if you have
[1:04:49] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:04:52] then the works that jesus did the
[1:04:55] attitude that jesus had the way that he
[1:04:58] talked the way that he walked the way
[1:04:59] did he conduct himself on an everyday
[1:05:01] basis is how you act how you talk how
[1:05:05] you walk
[1:05:10] come on folks think about it if you all
[1:05:11] be honest we all could use a little bit
[1:05:13] of down on me time for that
[1:05:20] so much so that the people see the love
[1:05:21] of god in you
[1:05:24] remember the quote she is him
[1:05:27] remember the quote where he says you
[1:05:28] know the bride is the word of god you
[1:05:30] are the word for the hour
[1:05:34] the god's word is alive and living in
[1:05:37] you and in me in this generation
[1:05:41] whenever they see you
[1:05:43] they should see christ
[1:05:48] how many's got room to grow
[1:05:51] if you don't let me come down and shake
[1:05:53] your hand real good and hug up on you
[1:05:55] because whatever you got i need more of
[1:06:01] that's right
[1:06:03] because we were born again to be trained
[1:06:06] to be conformed to the image of christ
[1:06:11] you know i really hate my faults
[1:06:14] i hate seeing my faults
[1:06:17] and yet i'm very very thankful for it
[1:06:20] are you with me
[1:06:22] you don't like your faults
[1:06:24] but if you can't see your faults you're
[1:06:26] not going to feel bad about your faults
[1:06:28] you're going to stay like you are
[1:06:30] but if you got enough of christ in you
[1:06:32] the holy ghost will show you your faults
[1:06:34] you'll hate your faults but you're glad
[1:06:36] that god chose you your fault because
[1:06:38] you know where you're at
[1:06:40] and you know what you need to do
[1:06:44] to get rid of the old man
[1:06:47] and let the new man live
[1:06:51] then your words will be fewer
[1:06:54] but they'll be saltier
[1:06:56] they'll have more weight
[1:06:58] they'll mean a lot more
[1:07:01] amen you love him
[1:07:04] that's right
[1:07:06] how many believes that
[1:07:08] god made it so
[1:07:10] that through the womb of our mind
[1:07:16] let me just
[1:07:18] stop there and give you another test
[1:07:21] what else is this
[1:07:24] what else is
[1:07:25] the word of god
[1:07:30] well i believe it's over matthew he says
[1:07:32] the word
[1:07:33] is like a seed right
[1:07:36] that is sower sowed
[1:07:39] the word is like a seed the word of god
[1:07:41] is a seed
[1:07:43] it has to be planted
[1:07:45] it has to be watered
[1:07:48] because isn't it something how that
[1:07:50] well if the word of god is true why
[1:07:52] don't everybody be a christian
[1:07:55] huh
[1:07:58] why because it has to be taken in
[1:08:00] it has to have the spirit come and water
[1:08:03] that seed
[1:08:05] it has to what we call quicken that seed
[1:08:07] brother 10 percently spoke on it brother
[1:08:10] ben norad talked about it
[1:08:12] how that the prophecy coming to pass
[1:08:14] that's where the real power is
[1:08:16] the word of god quickened
[1:08:19] is the real power
[1:08:21] when the holy spirit comes down there
[1:08:24] and anoints it
[1:08:26] waters it
[1:08:27] cause it to sprout
[1:08:30] not only does that word have to be here
[1:08:35] but here's a really heavy meat
[1:08:39] thought
[1:08:42] there has you have to be
[1:08:44] a seed
[1:08:45] of god
[1:08:47] let me believe that
[1:08:51] you have to be a seed of god
[1:08:53] god has come down in your soul and
[1:08:54] quicken
[1:08:56] your soul
[1:08:57] that has to be a seed
[1:08:59] and then the word comes down there the
[1:09:01] spirit comes down
[1:09:03] makes it live makes john 3 16.
[1:09:06] makes you smile because that's right
[1:09:08] that's me
[1:09:11] amen
[1:09:13] i know that he gave his life for me
[1:09:16] it's a reality
[1:09:18] amen
[1:09:23] if you ever expect to be saved
[1:09:26] if you ever expect to be healed
[1:09:29] if you ever expect to overcome the enemy
[1:09:31] [Music]
[1:09:33] what do you take in what do you accept
[1:09:35] what do you receive
[1:09:36] this here
[1:09:38] this is what you receive
[1:09:41] you have to accept what god said
[1:09:44] amen
[1:09:47] but god said
[1:09:49] by his stripes i am healed
[1:09:52] let that go down into your heart
[1:09:54] but the venom was so determined to make
[1:09:56] that seed sprout so determined to plant
[1:09:58] that seed down that he went in 80s puke
[1:10:00] through that boy he was going to die in
[1:10:02] it but he believed with all of his heart
[1:10:03] he said that's what god said
[1:10:06] y'all can call the funeral home if you
[1:10:08] want to i may be there but i have
[1:10:10] confidence i won't be
[1:10:12] but today i'm going to live or die but
[1:10:14] i'm going to eat some of that
[1:10:15] cornbread
[1:10:17] i'm gonna eat some of them beans
[1:10:20] because by his stripes i am healed
[1:10:23] i believe if you ever overcome if you
[1:10:25] ever want to promise god take that word
[1:10:27] in
[1:10:28] amen praise the lord
[1:10:33] can we go with a couple more
[1:10:35] let's go to hebrews
[1:10:42] and let me see
[1:10:45] let's go to another one first
[1:10:49] saint john 6
[1:10:51] 63
[1:10:54] and we'll find out
[1:10:57] how powerful
[1:10:58] the word is
[1:11:00] and what the words really are
[1:11:03] now i like this i like this
[1:11:09] say john 6 and 6
[1:11:10] let's start with uh
[1:11:14] 62 why didn't if you shall see the son
[1:11:17] of man ascend up where he was before
[1:11:21] amen
[1:11:22] all right it is the spirit that
[1:11:25] quickeneth
[1:11:27] the flesh profiteth
[1:11:29] nothing
[1:11:31] and here's where the punchline is the
[1:11:33] words that i speak to you
[1:11:37] they
[1:11:38] are
[1:11:39] spirit
[1:11:44] let me just ask it we so say so much
[1:11:47] about the word without the spirit is
[1:11:49] dead
[1:11:51] you know
[1:11:53] well the word is never dead
[1:11:56] it's only dead to certain people don't
[1:11:58] receive it right
[1:11:59] it never never does the bible say the
[1:12:00] word is dead
[1:12:04] huh more than just words or actually
[1:12:06] spirit
[1:12:09] how many believe
[1:12:12] that there's their spirit there's their
[1:12:15] spirit in words
[1:12:19] just call your son or your daughter tell
[1:12:21] them they're worthless
[1:12:26] tell them you're worthless
[1:12:28] and
[1:12:29] see if that doesn't penetrate down into
[1:12:32] their soul
[1:12:35] huh
[1:12:37] folks
[1:12:43] can i just say something
[1:12:47] so bad and make him man everything i
[1:12:50] ever heard was you're no good you'll
[1:12:52] never amount to hillary you'll never
[1:12:54] mind
[1:12:56] that never boy never did
[1:12:58] prison today
[1:13:01] huh
[1:13:02] in prison today
[1:13:03] largely because somebody
[1:13:06] they continuously run them down
[1:13:09] don't do that
[1:13:11] most of us ain't got that problem i hope
[1:13:13] i'm sure we don't
[1:13:14] but that's the wrong thing to do why
[1:13:16] because spirits go on those words
[1:13:20] you can do it son
[1:13:22] huh you got to watch how much you break
[1:13:24] them up he'll be walking around and
[1:13:26] and getting too proud
[1:13:29] huh
[1:13:30] yeah why because spirits are on words
[1:13:34] that's why jesus said my words
[1:13:36] are spirit
[1:13:38] and what else did he say that they are
[1:13:40] and they are
[1:13:42] life
[1:13:44] my words are spirit
[1:13:46] and they are life
[1:13:50] amen
[1:13:52] how many times did david say thou art my
[1:13:54] buckler and my shield
[1:13:57] you are my strong tower huh
[1:14:00] man if you could take those words into
[1:14:02] your heart and say if thou god was that
[1:14:05] for him i believe god is that for me
[1:14:08] watch how god will protect that
[1:14:11] take the same shield he did
[1:14:14] amen
[1:14:16] praise be to god
[1:14:18] over in hebrews
[1:14:20] another thing that it says about the
[1:14:21] word of god in hebrews 4 and 12.
[1:14:29] for the word of god is
[1:14:33] very fast
[1:14:38] okay that doesn't sound quite right does
[1:14:40] it really do not not quite i don't think

[1:20:58] and
[1:20:59] powerful sharper than any two-edged
[1:21:01] sword piercing even
[1:21:04] the dividing of sunder and is a
[1:21:06] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:21:08] the heart and we've seen that manifested
[1:21:11] through the prophet of god when he could
[1:21:13] discern the thoughts and intents of the
[1:21:14] heart he could look at the audience
[1:21:17] and of course he had to wait till he
[1:21:18] came he said now you know who i'm
[1:21:20] waiting for because without him coming
[1:21:22] and doing it i can't see nothing but he
[1:21:24] come and he tell you where he was what
[1:21:26] you were thinking
[1:21:27] huh
[1:21:28] a lot of times people think bad stuff he
[1:21:30] says now don't think that i know what

[1:21:40] it looks down in your heart
[1:21:44] you know it's something how that people
[1:21:46] can say stuff
[1:21:49] one thing i've learned is people's
[1:21:51] actions speak louder than their words
[1:21:56] doesn't matter what you say but why are
[1:21:58] you doing what you're doing
[1:21:59] what is your intent what is your motive
[1:22:04] you wouldn't do this if it wasn't the
[1:22:06] motive
[1:22:08] amen there's a motive behind it
[1:22:10] and he this word of god is a discerner
[1:22:13] of the thoughts and intents
[1:22:15] of the heart the motive
[1:22:18] the intent
[1:22:19] of what knows nobody's
[1:22:21] getting away with
[1:22:22] anything so let's keep our hearts pure
