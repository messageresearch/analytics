so foreign you foreign um so foreign foreign sweet well foreign foreign so okay you uh uh so okay so so so you so so foreign [Music] foreign uh so um foreign so mm-hmm foreign good morning brothers and sisters we'll just stand this morning maybe your brother brad will open us in prayer this morning amen the children can be dismissed for sunday school if we're going the psalms to 103. psalms 103. bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases to satisfy the mouth with good things so that the youth is renewed like the eagles he made known his ways unto moses his acts unto the children of israel you will not always child neither will he keep his anger forever whereas the heavens is high above the earth so great is his mercy toward them that fear him like as the father pitteth his children so the lord pitieth them that fear him as for for man his days are as grass as a flower of the field so he flourisheth but the mercy of the lord is from everlasting everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto children's children the lord hath prepared his throne in the heaven and his kingdom ruleth over overall bless you the lord all ye his host ye ministers of his that do his pleasure bless the lord always works in all places of his dominion bless the lord all my soul god bless you may be seated brother brian morning brothers and sisters i was a we were reading that psalm this morning that one thing you know what was it the 14th verse it says for you knoweth our refrain our frame and remember that we are dust you know no matter where you're at in your life old or young doesn't make a difference god knows who you are he knows what's going on in your life where you're at in your life what you're feeling in your body and he cares about it you know sometimes everything that goes on in our life whatever we're going through there's things there trying to cloud that out but as you read that song you know that whole hundred and third somewhere you know as human beings we're pretty blessed people to know that god actually has us in his mind and cares about us and then we were those that weren't here i don't it wasn't on on wednesday brother thomas was playing that uh thing about what's going on in in ukraine and i was thinking the brother was talking about and you would if you want to turn me to the third chapter of proverbs the brother was talking about how the whole world is trying to isolate the country of russia where they basically where they couldn't buy and sell and i was just thinking there was another point i don't know if he said it or not the most important thing they're doing is in an information way the only information that you're hearing is the other side you're not hearing they're totally shut down and don't get me wrong i'm not taking this out here but in america or in europe or any they're only showing one side you're only seeing one side of the information everyone is making i'm not saying it that you should have a different opinion but i'm saying they're both keeping them from buying and selling and they're isolating that country in a way that the only information that you're seeing on your tablets your phones your radios whatever is the information they want you to hear and they want you to see and whether it's good information don't get me wrong it could be the right it could be the right information or the right subject that you need to hear but they are so controlling the information that you're only hearing what they want you to hear or see what you want to see so it requires you to actually research more to know what's going on and i'm not taking aside don't but the thing i see the most is in the world that we're in they're trying to control what you think what you see where you can go who you can associate that's what we're coming to and no one knows how many years you have before they have total control over it but it's a it's a it's not a thing to be afraid of just like the brother was saying as brother thomas will tell you you know as christians it should make you want to go closer to christ not get further away from christ everything that happens to you as an individual should make you want to get closer to christ shouldn't make you want to get further away from christ if something in your life is wanting to make you get further away from christ then there's that whatever that is is not coming from the lord it's coming from your enemy and you have to and i was just thinking this morning you know it's what you eat every day is who you're going to be what you bring into your mind bring into your heart is going to be who you are and what you are and uh i'll just read out of this third proverbs here this morning i was sitting there all morning i was listening doing different things and i'll just go here to proverbs it kind of goes along with what we were reading in this 103rd psalm this morning but i was also thinking you know from another perspective you know us as christians the difference between you and the people out there in the world your minister the man that's feeding you the word of god he'll tell you something different than the world will tell you your ministry will tell you don't believe me because i tell you believe me because god's word and the message of the hour reflect back to the truth that you're hearing that's the difference between them out in the world they want you to believe what they tell you and they don't want you to question what they're telling you the a real man of god is going to tell you to get in the word of god and get in the message of the hour to prove what you're hearing you shouldn't be you shouldn't be afraid to read your bible and listen to the message of the hour so what your pastor's telling you what everyone's telling you you have to have an experience in the word of god that it reflects back to you what you're hearing is the truth if if you're not having those experiences when the chips fall you're going to be believing what someone tells you other than what you experienced for yourself and that's an important thing that you have those experiences yourself where you know in the word of god where you can go to have your comfort or to have an answer for someone you have to know self you have to study yourself you've got to prove yourself in the word of god you know i i i can't help who i am you know you don't spend all those all those years on active duty there's certain things that you learn being on active duties all those years is you just you just can't believe something you've got to prove something you know you have to prove what you believe in the word of god you have to walk in what god shows you and you have to believe what god shows you and as as you continue to add those things to you you'll become that statute of the perfect man that's behind me and i i've been talking here for probably five minutes and i hadn't even read the scripture but if you return with me to proverbs the third chapter you know and here i go man before we get started you know i used to be an intelligent analyst on active duty and the thing you do as an intelligent analyst is that you take raw information which would be and you can apply it here you take the message of the hour and the word of god that's that information you take all that information in and you have to it goes back to what i just said you have to prove what you're reading you have to search it out you have to reason not reason don't i didn't mean to say it that way but you have to let the word of god reflect back to you what you're believing what you're reading it should become so true to you that there are nothing else matters in your life other than what you're reading and god is showing you in this word but you have to read all whether it's out there in the world whether it's someone telling you this someone telling you that whatever that information is you've got to take it back to the word of god and you have to prove it you just can't believe something because you if it isn't proven you've got to take all that information you're seeing out there what people are telling you you have to prove it by the word of god if you're not doing that you can find yourself believing something that's not in the word of god in the message of the hour and then start here at the first verse and solomon says this everyone knows this chapter brother branham taught numerous messages out of this chapter in the third chapter of proverbs i've always said before that you could read a chapter a day and go back every month read a chapter a day in proverbs and solomon wrote this book probably four or five thousand years ago and the truths that are in this book are just as true today as it was when solomon wrote it we have more technology maybe than solomon had but the truths in this in the proverbs hasn't changed you can give people all the technology in the world and people will still be people there you will do the same things they will act the same way unless god gets in that heart and gets in that life and i'll just read my son for getting out the law but let thine heart keep my commandments for the length of days and long life peace shall they add to thee let not mercy and truth forsake thee by them about thy neck rock them upon the table of thine heart and go through what i was saying solomon is telling his children is telling us as believers that we have to take the word of god and bind it in our hearts we have to take it out of the mind and bring it down into the soul that you are into your very heart that it god is breathing and living inside you and he goes on to say so that thou shall find favor and good understanding in the sight of god amen trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not on thy own understanding and that's an important thing not what you think you believe but what god actually says for us to believe that's the difference in it and he goes on in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct our paths be not wise and thin years fear the lord and depart from evil it shall be held to thy navel and marrow to thy bones on the lord with thy substance and with thy first fruits and of all thine increases so so that would barnes be filled with plenty and i pressed the cell bust out with new wine and you could look at those scriptures right there no matter what whether you're laying on the side of the street with no money or whether god has given you millions of dollars shouldn't change who you are he goes on to say my son despise not the chastising of the lord neither be worry of his correction that's where the world is at this morning they won't take correction if you tell someone that he's wrong they'll want to fight with your tooth in there and believe what he wants to believe and he goes on from whom the lord loveth he correcteth even as a father a son in whom he delighted happy is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that geteth understanding for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver and the gain thereof and then find gold she is more precious than rubles and all the things that thou can desire are not to be compared onto her i was going to go into john the 15th chapter but you know like the brother was saying on on that thing on wednesday just like brother thomas has been talking about the last couple of weeks you know it's really important for us as believers to have an experience brother daniel when he came back and the sister coming back from the camp that's really important for you to have that hitching post to have that experience where you know that god has settled with your soul and in your life no matter what happens in this world you know you're tied to something more than your own ideas and your own opinion you're tied to jesus christ and him alone that's the only thing that matters no matter what you see going on in the world what our country wants to be what other countries do it don't make a difference anymore the only thing that matters is what christ does for us is individuals brother david i love him with mark this morning hey man let's stand if we could this morning man i sing that little course god is so good this morning if we could oh god he is so good oh god is so good god is so good he's so good to me i loved him so this morning and i i loved him [Music] him so i love him so he's so good too me don't you love him this morning for my god he is so good god is so good oh god he is so good he's so good to me and when i think of the goodness of jesus and all he has done for me [Music] [Music]

be seated and we have several out this morning some of them i think are gone to the youth thing so virginia just pray that god will just bless them and be with them as they travel home amen and brother josh reeves uh sending a testimony in this morning said i just wanted to thank the lord for protecting my dad head-on crash friday night in his car he was traveling 55 miles an hour and a young boy pulled out in front of him he didn't even have time to break but he was instantly brought to a complete stop he was broke he was i'm sorry he was taken by ambulance to the emergency room and dismissed three hours later with no injuries broken bones or concussion the doctors and nurses said there was definitely somebody watching over brothers amen amen [Applause] amen you know you just can't be thankful enough for god's mercy and grace in our hearts and lives he's an awesome god and you know if it's your time to go you'll go but if it's not you know my my wife always gets on to me because i always say if the train hits you if it's not your time to go you're not going to go and i was talking to a friend of mine a lot of you may know him mr donald straighter he's a good friend of mine lives out towards north and we were talking about the goodness of the lord here while back and he told me he said you know david i don't care if a train hit you you're not going to go it ain't your time to go i said i'm glad somebody agrees with me but he said you know he said lord we trust the lord to watch over us he says when it's our time to go we'll go but he said until then we'll keep on marching on i believe that this morning don't you amen just so thankful for his grace and mercy and brother parish told me in the back when he come in this morning he said he's doing a lot better he's feeling better so i said well that's good you know there's nothing worse than feeling bad i don't like feeling bad and when i don't feel real good you can ask my wife i get grouchy and i can't help it but i like to feel good and be happy but you know the older we get the bodies they get more struggles and but you know i'm just thankful that we have a heavenly father that one of these days he's going to take us home and all all these old bodies will be gone and we'll have a new young one this morning amen young people probably don't understand that but when you get older you you'll realize it more when you can't do things you used to like to do and you know i i told john michael one time i said i found out a lot a few years ago i wasn't near as tough as i thought i was i said and i definitely was thinking but it wasn't there but i'm just glad for his grace and mercy this morning amen let's sing that song if we could on christ the solid rock this morning i'm glad we stand

for a minute we have birthdays today birthdays and anniversaries amen do you want to announce if you hear a spanish voice it's not from above other than up in the balcony our sister daisy probably going to try and interpret today right yeah so anyway so we're gonna have to slow it maybe down a little bit if we can amen but praise the lord we have our privilege to have her mom with us amen and so we want to try to get her she told me last sunday they said well you know she really likes your preaching she just can't understand any of it i said well maybe we'll get you all up top for something you try to interpret we hate for not to get anything out of the service other than my enthusiasm you need a little more than that right amen so praise the lord amen god bless you this morning everybody has a birthday this month if you will come up come all the way up to the platform i know brother perry she has won so we keep him from having to go down there y'all come up here would that be all right all right all right saving your trip there brother [Music] happy birthday [Applause] [Music] [Applause] do a happy birthday to you and the best one you've ever had happy birthday y'all amen praise the lord amen anniversaries amen donna this is may so let's not forget shall we amen i know me and my wife have a uh anniversary and i'm not sure um was it 83 or 84 you remember donna troubled already right there's trouble at the house ready i don't know i think i'm thinking it was 83 but anyway that would have made that would make next year i was trying to figure out how many years just make it 39 amen next year would be our i don't know what 40th year is i think 50 is jubilee so it's not jubilee but anyway are you coming home all right you're not all right praise the lord 39 golden years amen that's a long time amen praise the lord praise god anybody else any other anybody else get married in may all right i really feel lucky there now all right a happy anniversary to you happy anniversary to you may [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] amen praise the lord god is good isn't he amen amen so next weekend i don't know who got to see the film or whatever and not the film but a lot of us seen the ukrainian report or update uh that brother i'm trying to think his name now very coffee yes brother barry gave here wednesday amen and we just he gave a detailed report of how we can get money into some of the believers that are either stuck in their basement or whatever it might be and help some of those that have made it out you know and i don't mind helping the ones that made it out or the ones that are in but i kind of prefer to help the ones that are perhaps still stuck in there because i'm sure they probably need it more than anything but next weekend we want to take our annual first part of the year uh missionary offering would that be okay next weekend and then we're going to go in that direction with it this time to help our our ukrainian brothers and sisters would that be okay amen and so to continue to just pray for them amen i just tell you i know it's like brother brian said you know you only hear half the story and so but i do know that whatever it is it's a bad situation over there amen all the way around amen and i may say a little bit more something maybe i'll say it while i got it on my mind but you know everybody has perhaps a different thought of it and brother i mean different ones have a different idea of what perhaps prophecy or scripture or whatever it is that's being fulfilled because of it but to me this is just my five sense to me i know that everybody's ganging up on on russia i mean they're really being bringing hard on them you know and perhaps you know the united nations the whole thing to me that they have to be pretty ticked off they have to be pretty mad at somebody to blow them up with a nuke right and we know that uh we've got to nuke one of their nukes on with our name on it isn't that right but ibam said that they would they would blow us up the same way with rome will be blown up in one day so to me perhaps this is just something that's getting them in their mental state in that right in the mental state to be able to pull that lever or or or to send those missiles amen but i do know it's got to get into a bad shape you know before they do something like that and by god's grace we plan on being out of here right amen you know you get crazy thoughts going through your mind i mean it's got crazy thoughts going through your mind you know of perhaps a new coming perhaps a nuke coming and blowing one of our cities up and what that would do to you and i knowing the prophet said before one new bus right we'll be gone amen but that's just the crazy thoughts the devil tries to put in your head well maybe maybe what if one does come i still believe that we'll be gone before the judgment of uh the fire of the wrath of god comes down don't you but we do know no doubt it's everything's always it's always getting ready things are moving and all of the cogs are moving into their place you know because uh you know the world has rejected god isn't that right and when you reject mercy when you do reject grace there's only one thing left and that is to stand god's judgment if you do not accept his mercy you must not might you won't get out of it you won't have an option you will stand his judgment amen so i don't know about you but i sure am glad to be a part of the first aren't you god bless you this morning i know everybody's just kind of melancholy this morning so we're just going to try to feel the mind of the spirit this morning and see what he has for us there's a thought that kind of laid on my heart and i thought boy basically i thought yeah sure that's the way you want me to go you know and i'm like okay well i've spoken on this before but i just can't seem to get it out of my mind so i'll take it as from the lord that's what he wants us to speak on this morning would that be okay so god richly richly bless you amen stand with me now we'll go before the lord in prayer before we open the word kind heavenly father we do thank you lord jesus for this great opportunity lord to be able to assemble ourselves together again without having a government or somebody telling us you can't do that lord and just to have the freedom to come and to worship you and to give you thanks and praise for all that you do for us lord every day and what you mean to us lord father we ask god that as we open the word lord jesus that you will just speak from that word to each heart directly that we might go here closer to you than when we came in lord no matter how close we are we'll be just a little closer yet father forgive us of all of our transgressions all of our sins on all of our failures lord and help us to be better christians to serve you bless the reading of the word the meditation of our heart lord in that which we feel you've laid upon our heart to minister we ask your blessing in jesus name amen turn your bibles if you will and we'll go to the book of revelations we'll go right to the scripture that just come to my mind and stayed on my mind and wouldn't leave my mind and so we're just going see what the lord will have for us amen how many in the word of god is always good every portion of the word of god is always good no matter how many times you eat it amen it's good over and over and over and over and over and over when we've been there 10 000 years it'll still be good amen and i just want to say that this morning's message and of course we are trying to have and set our minds to an eternal mindset and that right i say that because the way that you are here when you leave if you was to drop dead before the end of the service that's how you would be that right and so however we leave here that's how we're going to be amen so it's important that our hearts are the way they're supposed to be that our minds are the way that they're supposed to be our mindset and the way that we think and the one portion of that mindset that i want to focus on a little bit this morning is thankfulness amen that we appreciate what god is and who he is this morning we want to look at once again like the old song says let's talk about jesus more and more and more that's what we're going to do again and i thought about going to making a whole series out of it i don't know if i'll speak maybe a little bit more yet but i just want to stay with just a fraction or just a portion of what we could get into amen and what it is is in revelations now revelations um one will begin with and i'll show you what that first portion or that portion or the first portion will be amen that we feel to speak on this morning pray for brother danny for wednesday night we've asked him to speak wednesday night will y'all pray for him amen okay revelations 1 and verse 7 behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen i am alpha and omega the beginning in the ending saith the lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was on the isle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ i was on this in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last down to verse 17 and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen doesn't that go along with the song we sing there tarzan he's alive and well amen he's very much alive how many believes he's alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death may god had his blessings to reading in the word you can be seated this morning amen praise the lord amen so this morning i want to talk about and title this amen uh i want to title this our abc's our abc's amen i we're thinking that [Music] alpha was in the hebrew uh the first letter of the alphabet and omega being the last but siri tells me that it's the greek in the greek language it's the first letter of the alphabet and the last amen so if that's correct that's what we'll go by amen but anyway so he is the alpha he's the omega amen and do you notice how this book of revelations means more to us i believe than in any other generation i mean the best a lot of our uh philosophers and scholars and and phd doctors of divinity a lot of them the best that they could come up with or some of the things they have said was that perhaps paul i mean john just ate the wrong thing or whatever and he had a nightmare now that's a terrible thing for anybody claiming christianity to say about the bible right because it's at all times it's a whole lot more than that that is an insult but anyway they didn't know people didn't know what it meant people didn't know what it can the symbols a lot of the symbols and everything meant but in this hour to me as i just began to think about that i begin to thinking about easter beginning notice he says he's the first letter of the alphabet and he's the last alpha of letter of the alphabet so what does that mean that means that you you've realized where the alphabet comes from right how does god come up with the alphabet how many knows god is the one that came up with numerology all of your numbers all knowledge belongs to him every bit of it and here it's different that he would say that i am the eighth and i am the z i am the beginning and i am the ending now you know that's the beginning of the alphabet the ending of the alphabet but also meaning that he is the beginning of the creation of god how many knows he was in the beginning of all things the bible says that without him was nothing made that was me oh my once again i just love to do it and that is to glorify god for who he is because we find out in this world that it's we're not as important as what we think and that right we find out that really he is the one that's important not us so much and we should be doing more about magnifying and glorifying him then we are worried about ourselves so much we'd actually be happier people if our mind was more on him and less on ourselves we should get amen from that because let's admit it we're all honest where's a whole lot of thought that goes into this guy a whole lot of thought goes on to taking care of this guy rather than thinking about god the way that we should praise be to god there's a whole lot to be said about god being first i am the first how many know that god wants to be first he is first i got to thinking about what we use the phrase alpha for a lot of times those of us who have a farm we know there's a alpha cow there's an alpha horse there's an alpha dog we call them alphas right they're first they're the head they're the boss praise the lord how many knows god i want you to know i don't care if you're putin i don't care if you're a king i don't care what you are god is alpha he's above all bible says he's above all and through all and in you all i love that song oh lord you're my all in all he is my everything how many know that we we need to work on some of this when i got to thinking about being first i know that there's a lot of us including myself that have come a long way because of the preaching of the word that we have heard how that we are to put god first but i also thought you know i believe we still have some searching to do every one of us still has some searching to do amen because there's still areas perhaps in our lives where he's still not first like he ought to be how much you know he was first he did something how did the first thing that he tells john you know in this book of revelation i am he which was dead let me go back a little bit notice i fell at his feet as dead john when he seen his vision he fell at his feet like he was dead and he put his right hand and he said don't fear i am the first and i'm the last i believe that means more to this church to to believers than any other time knowing that he is first and he's the last he was there he began everything oh my and he says to john i'm the first and the last he he's supposed to get comfort from this i am he that liveth i was dead but behold now i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death i thought about going through the whole alphabet like i said i don't i'm not going to this morning i could never do it but i'm just going to go with a b and c would that be okay let's just go with a b and c amen he is alpha the beginning he's the start see in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god how many knows he is the bee he is the beginning he is the beginning he he is the end he's every letter in the alphabet praise be to god oh when he becomes every fiber of your body how many knows about the man says he goes just the size of a thumbnail he starts with or a fingernail or something like that right am i close and then he got in there and then he spreads out we believe god wanted to spread out he wanted to spread out in every area of our life every area of our life every part of our being every fiber that we have every part of our mind he wants to go plumb into your spirit realm he wants to go plumb into your soul realm amen the same as with the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made we've heard the phrase don't start nothing and there won't be nothing huh well guess what if god wouldn't have started nothing it would have been nothing amen that means the creation everything it doesn't matter what it is everything he made everything without him there was not anything made that was made the bible says one place i create evil dog god talking i create evil oh i know some people religious we might kind of blow our mind god's saying i create that don't make i i ain't here to question god not now not ever it'd be like me building something in my shop i'm building something and it looks funky to you what the world have you made brother writer that looks stupid dumb and ignorant well guess what i don't care what you think some stupid and ignorant i'm gonna make what i would make and god says in hebrew romans that he says who are we to ask why has thou made me thus he's a master he made everything he can make whatever he wants to make he can do whatever he wants to do he's god how many bad he's got [Applause] glad he doesn't have us for his leader huh no we're just to create it we can't even we don't we're not even supposed to figure it all out praise the lord you love him it was nothing made but what he made amen and just think about this i like this because he said i am the beginning you and i perhaps don't know what it was like to watch enoch and uh and the different ones this lineage of cane to go out and uh and build cities and do musical instruments and they were makers of musical instruments weren't they we weren't there at the beginning is what i'm trying to say but we are here at the end i many knows every spirit every organization every denomination every homosexual every every evil thing everything started in genesis it was at the beginning right now it's the beginning book everything was in there where you and i didn't live in that but we're living not in the beginning of it or in the seed of it but we're living in the manifestation and in the full ripening of it all the full manifestation that's why you're seeing what you're seeing out there going so evil because it's coming to its full manifestation amen how many beliefs the bride will come to full of them full manifestations one of these days i was driving down the road yesterday now thinking about the lord and i was looking at my desires and the way that my desires run and and what i think about what i what my passion is and i look at my mistakes and i said oh i sure don't like that i hate every mistake i've ever made huh but i don't focus on that but i look at my desire and i look at what little things anymore maybe it's my age but i believe it's the holy ghost as you get older and then you begin to little things bother you a little bit more than what they used to oh yeah if you get a little older if people get the shakes they get them to be a nervous wreck sometime you know you have to be careful your mind i low you got to keep it in check not let things bother you so much take it to the lord in prayer but i was there and i was checking my things and so forth and i got the look and i got driving down the road look at the skies with god made that says you know i believe that i've got a theophany body waiting for me i believe there's another body waiting for me oh my my that gets you excited but it does me because if you ain't got no body to go into if you ain't got no theology body waiting for you when you get over to the other side first of all your desires are going to be downward huh if you've got a perfect body you'd thirst for perfection you have a desire for perfection for close to walk with god to be just yet that body is calling i've got to think that theophany is calling me i hope you have a theophany this morning that is calling you amen i got to worry about getting old i ain't got to worry about wrinkles i gotta worry about gray hair i got one over there they got no gray hair ain't got no wrinkles ain't got no feebleness hello if you're excited about that i don't know what i'm gonna do with you i think you've got that waiting over there oh my see what is that that is my end that is my end game my end goal and that right is to be in your theophany your new body no matter what you go through in life what's important is your beginning and what's important is your end god's telling him just as i was there at the beginning i'm going to be there at the end i am then i was the beginning and i am the end what joy that it gives me the mo this morning is to think that he is never going to leave you he'll never forsake you he's not going to finish not finish his job he's going to be there i am the beginning and i am the ending how many knows how many times the prophet of god told us you are living in the end time we're living in the end the end we're living in the end time not the beginning but in the end time that's what jesus says i am the end i'm the beginning and the end when you look at all that god is huh and all that god does for you huh how good he is to you i mean it's all about him it's how good god is to you across the whole spectrum in the spiritual world of redemption forgiveness of your sins huh the joy that he gives you the peace that he gives you the grace that he gives you all that he gives you the way that he blesses you if you've been blessed because i'm here to tell you that majority of people are over blessed and under thankful huh overly blessed under thankful and when you become unthankful you are not grateful if you don't praise god for what he is huh and for the blessings that he bestows you lose those blessings you lose those blessings and that's exactly what america has done they have forgotten their blessings they forgot how god brought them here they forgot plymouth rock they forgot what we wrote on our whole on our on our pills and god we trust one nation under god they forgot all that you want an example of people who forget who god is look at america brother brennan he talked about the greatest the nation outside of israel one of the greatest states i don't believe rome i don't believe any of them had anything on us greatest nations in the world founded upon christianity founded upon god belief in god and faith in god and then became unthankful for what they had you want to see a dry church you want to see a dead person that claims to be a christian let them become unthankful for what they have let them not glorify god the way that they should because that's what we're here to do that's what we come is to worship him as the puppet of god put it to make love with christ we come here to raise our hands and love him in the morning love him at noon love him and even love him all the time people don't love god the way they should they don't keep him first the way that he should and our mind said my mind said oh god don't never let me get this so don't let ever let this become common to me because if it does hear do you reckon it just might over there too one of these days you're just going to be so backslid and you're not going to appreciate god and you're going to be so gripey about this and the gripe be about that and then god's going to come and take you in the rapture i don't think it's going to happen that way do you no no i don't think so i think we're going to be at the height of worship i think we're going to be screaming a little on this side because of our goodies oh let me give you some advice if you're depressed if you ain't got no smile on your face you need more god you need to count your blessing you need to see you need to look at the alpha and omega you need to look at the one that's everything let it become your everything you won't be stagnated you won't be backslid you won't be all of that you'll realize you're not the important one here he's the important one you'll begin to give him praise and honor and glory your life will change i don't care if all you got is five one pennies all i got brother bothers five cents you start jumping up and down saying well praise be to god he gave me five cents because god loves to give to those who are appreciative of it but not those that complain about what they do have amen again i want to just recap look at america if you want to see what it looks like when somebody doesn't appreciate what they had it isn't long they don't even want what they have anymore and we human beings are so stupid that it isn't until we really get what we want it we thought we would get what we want we find out that's not at all what we want we're the epitome of misery and then we say oh i wish i would still have that it is until we get there that we get smart a lot of people folks are you with me there's a lot of people out there you want socialism you want all kind you want all of that when you get it you will wish you had the other i ain't gonna be that way i appreciate my freedom i really don't like when the government says you can't have church because of this that or the other i don't care if i want to die let me go die don't start telling me what i can and can't do huh be very careful there isn't that right because we know it's the devil isn't it something like you know just taking our masks off people out of it no no no don't let them take an ass off what is the big deal let's take the mask off no it's just the devil in that that's a you know brother bam talked about how there was nothing but the devil and martin luther in that movement that's what all this is not but the devil in that trying to tell you what you can and can't do yeah that's right you know what i love the freedom to be able to speak this out on the internet say what i want to say you want to say something different go ahead least we can say what we want to say and don't get me political here but i'm just going to say something anyway aren't they coming up with some kind of a dis disinformation mode now that if you if i understand maybe i'm wrong here but if you give out this information they want to shut you down now if you lie about something they're going to shut you down well the ones that are putting the board up need to be shut down they're the big biggest disinformation you know i'm 60 years old i'm not just too dumb anymore i know when somebody's lying to me and who's giving out the disinformation what if you want to investigate something you'll have to do your own self that's right it's a joke isn't that right but as always it's just those wheels right everything's got to come together that's right lose everything they want to take everything and probably will amen until even the foolish virgins if she doesn't come subject to this this thing that public god called word uh world council churches and all of all of that they'll be hunted down like dogs and shot you'll have to go into caves and everything else you better find a big old hole to store a bunch of food up on because they're gonna come after you but we're getting ready to leave here about we're getting read we are thankful for alpha and we're glad that he is the beginning of everything and we're glad that he is the end of it all amen never leave you never forsake you praise the lord simplicity yeah this morning's message is very simple it certainly is but i like it that way i've never claimed to be a deep preacher amen just simple something you can understand hopefully i'd like to preach like some of these preachers and be able to go into mysteries and deep things that you know that really really it's illuminating it's like wow hey man but listen let's talk about the abcs can we you know what the abcs stand for always believe christ but said i met a man not long ago and he said why don't you leave off of those women the way that they dress you know their hair and their makeup and all those things he says well he said people regard you as a prophet well i said i'm not he said but they regard you as that why don't you teach them deep things how to receive deep spiritual gifts and see visions and things like that and says how can i teach them algebra when they won't even find learn their abcs amen now in this i come up with two sets of abc's in studying i come up with two sets of abc's how many there's two sets of abc's he says brother bam says listen let me say this again let me read you another quote so in america america let me tell you about the other abc's one of ism is always believe christ in america in the signs and wonders of god they take place he says what if what happened last night would have taken place talking about discernment your name is so-and-so you have such a such a problem this that or the other all the discernment that went going forth he says he says that last night he says in bombay if it happened in bombay india there would be a hundred thousand souls one to jesus christ but people walk in our meetings and they walk back out and say well what do you think about that just a polish suit there or some mental telepathy he says and that's the educated one place he says education has been the greatest curse that christianity has ever had education knowledge to know something listen you educate the people till they know more about god than god knows about it when i was reading this i thought about how that in our bible schools the story of the the lady that was healed and her boy come back and said you know in our bibles uh college they teach us that mark 16 from a certain scripture on it's not even inspired and i had to think what now this is the words that come to my mind what demon or d a dean demon or the you know the dean i guess the head of them all come up that they felt they had the authority to teach everybody now that's that's inspired from there on well when i read my bible brother john it doesn't say it's not inspired from here on somebody else had to put that in maybe they should put that into all the bibles from this verse that they said now the rest of this chapter is not inspired do you erect they get some kickback on that right well they should get some kick going back on it remember that one that was talking to a uh muhammad and he says all of the quran is inspired i mean please all the bible is inspired heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away they're as eternal as eternal can be but that's where education gets you a lot of times people get to be so smart and as soon as they get smart hello folks i don't mind you having an education but just don't brag to me about how you got an education and so many years of college and try to make me feel inferior because it's not going to work especially with the quote right get finished with telling me how about all your phd and i'll tell you well you know what the prophet god said that just means you're that further away from god i wouldn't do that unless i really felt led to but listen what's important listen here's what's important are you ready i've got two girls here and i'd rather those girls never even know their abcs and yet know jesus christ then have all the education the world could pile on them and not know jesus christ i'd rather they know christ how many that's what we need we need people not just to know the bible or the word but know the author how many believes he is the author [Music] and the finisher hebrews 12 says uh you know that he is the author and the finisher of our faith praise be to god i'm glad that he started working me it's easy is he the author of your experience it's more important that we know christ the bible says to know him is to know life if you have him you have life not if you have education or knowledge or mental no but to have him is life if you don't have him you don't have god you don't have life in him was life and the life was the light of men let's be their god he'd rather his children now we know we've got to have an education so forth he never knocked that but don't never let that get in the way of believing christ always believe christ always in every situation in every age amen how many knows the scribes the pharisees they were educated paul was educated he was a pharisee of the pharisees he sat under camellia and he thought he had it right and he couldn't have had it more wrong amen let me tell you something the reason the world is in the condition it is but it it's because they don't know their abcs sure they know the other abcs they know the abcs of education but they don't know abc is to always believe christ how about our churches in this time god could come do signs and wonders but they had a phd brother branham had hints and tapes and fetches and fetches and everything else and couldn't talk and amen or something like that they thought he saw it oh man like some cow bellowing is it oh man it's not about showmanship he says why don't you get an education some of them smart guys said to a prophet to god i never knew until here that uh he was preaching the lamb and the dove remember his message on the laminate dove he says the service before that somebody come up to him and he says you know what a legalistic message got all over him huh i didn't know brother ben faced those type of things in his hour but people had the audacity to think they were so much better than the prophet come up and say do you such a legalistic message you know and and so forth and balling the women out why don't you teach him how to receive gifts and so forth and that's when he says you know how can i teach them algebra if they won't even learn to clean up their life it don't do no much good if you're up here with makeup and short hair like paul preached against and wearing pants and everything else speaking in tongues they go nobody believe your testimony clean your life up first learn how to dress first learn how to walk right first then we'll teach you some algebra amen praise the lord so the next time listen to this legalistic message oh more he just tore me up he said the next day i preached the laminate of the real lord really blessed that little message and broke up message and people were and he came out wiping his eyes he says that sure was a good message but so simple can you believe that first you compliment him and then you smack him in the face that's really how to treat a guy in it yeah but so simple it was all right but so simple and he could preach in seven languages you know so my con kentucky talk was so simple to him and our best manners wouldn't touch him nowhere that's right and so that's about the way that i have to talk simple i believe the gospel is simple the bible is simple the bible says that it is so simple that a fool should not err therein i mean those god deals in simplicity the common people heard him gladly it was the educated the pharisees the smart that didn't edu that didn't receive it amen because paul said first chapter of corinthians says because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men god takes the weak things of the world to confound smart and the educated norm of that i believe just comes to my mind but the band says the more simple you can be the more god can use you and i don't mean dumb that means simple in god just stay right before him and say just whatever you say lord don't let me begin to have a thought that's contrary to you or let me stay simple with christ i don't have to be smart for you see your calling brethren how that many not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many a noble are called but god has chosen the foolish things of this world to confound wise that's right and that's exactly what was happening here i can't tell you the prophet of god was just a simple fellow he was just a simple kentucky hillbilly with a lot of a lot of cut up words and somehow god chose the last prophet that sent to the gentiles to have him come right out of kentucky and speak like that and then that man would come up and he would simply say you say you have a phl lld the more lld's the more dd's you have that means that's how much further away from god you are he put him in their place he wasn't afraid to put him in their place to tell them the truth amen because remember brother baum says i was treated better by which doctors and all of those crazy people in africa i was treated better by them than i was these american preachers huh oh my he says he has a lot more success over there because all we are here we claim that we're not heathen he said here but he says we're nothing but an educated heathen over here if you don't believe that go through dairy queen drive-thru or go to walmart you'll see that we got no drinks eerie things see how big we can open that ear up and make a bigger hole looks just like them hot in parts of the jungles of africa we look more like them all the time why because a heathen means an unbeliever how many believes they don't have the first part is and that's be believer aren't you glad you're a be a the anointed one a lot of people say they believe in christ but how many knows christ means anointed people's church services aren't anointed preachers are not anointed they don't believe in that anointing because that anointing would straighten things out the double doors go to flopping in the denominations if that preacher ever got truly anointed to preach the word of god not just some false anointing hello amen to always and forever just like daniel he had his abcs right don't matter good times no matter bad times don't matter when or what always believe christ in every situation you're in and let's remember this because this came to my mind as i was coming to church that before us every day there's always a choice the right and the wrong in everything you do there's a right and the wrong and you have to be prayerful try to make sure you make the right choice how many believes that making the right choice in choosing christ and keeping christ always before you that's not just a one-time thing that's an everyday affair everything that comes up before you everything that happens you have a right choice and you have a wrong choice it's always before us and if you made the right choice you'll be a happy person you make the wrong choice you'll have to repent and you'll feel bad amen but most of all when i see this just the simplicity of alpha and omega that's who he is i love it amen it means so i'm thankful for it and through all of eternity i'll be thankful for what that means he started it and in the middle of the book and that right he's the beginning of the creation of god he's the beginning of your testimony in your life he's the beginning of mine how many knows he's in my beginning it was him that chose me to live he's him that chose you to live everything that was created i mean those voice was created by him your lips your tongue it was created by him your heart was created by him your eyes were created i thank god for voice god for years blessed are they they're here right bless the day that see huh think about it there's a lot of folks that don't don't have no legs they don't have no eyes they're blind perhaps can't hear you are sitting eyes vocal cords feeling good how many believes you should use all of that to praise god to glorify god that's what we're here for to glorify god use everything that he has made without him there's nothing made that was made he made you he made me he gave us our vocal point he'd give your mind he gave you a heart so that he could dwell in there was it all about him and for him revelations 4 11 says it this way thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honor see that's the problem people don't give god the honor and the glory that is due to him that's why they are in the condition they are christians are even huh you got to be careful you got to be careful about things become common to you your seat becoming common to you just sit there and oh it's just here no don't never if you get that way you go home this afternoon don't you let me go to church again and just feel like well i'm just doing what i always do huh let me tell you something comes to my mind is that okay church is about participation not spectator expectation if there's such a word we're not here to spectate we're here to participate in worshiping the lord lord i love you lord i love you lord i love you lord i love you you're a wonderful god thank you that you didn't start something and leave us hanging here at the end no he's hitting you like i said i wasn't there a lot of places but you're here with him now and i'm glad he's here aren't you glad god bless you we're going to bring it to close we have communion this morning amen i'm so grateful for what he did on calvary aren't you when we've been there 10 000 years bright shining as the sun out of love maybe god will allow us to go back and to see how it came when the sun began to shine huh and i don't know how many millions of years that thing's been shining but you talk about a torch brother sean you talk about a torch burning that hot and never burning out what's that thing made now i'm not here to tell for sure but as far as i know it's natural it's hard to believe anything natural could burn that hot for that many years huh and i think our summers are just as hot and so forth still the same amen amen i'm going to give my son's revelation of it if that's all right he thinks what's going to burn this world up is that thing going supernova elements everything it go when it burns out when it goes supernova just goes super hot it'll burn everything amen because we know that over there the sun won't be no more so it's going to go out sometime we won't have no need of the light for the lamb is the light and i got to thinking you know of all the time that that sun was up there when it's been gone for millions of years you'll still be brother joshua think about it you'll still be in millions of years after the sun is long gone aren't you glad and all because of him it's all because of him god bless you this morning he is the alpha he's the start he's the a he's the z he's the whole alphabet i am the whole creation and jesus is my name oh who do you say i am and whence do you say i came do you know the father and a lot of them can't tell his name but it's in jesus that dwells the fullness of the godhead don't you see and jesus is the great i am and the lord of lords is he alpha mega beginning the end amen amen last letter in the alphabet z what i thought about was one of uh troy and robin's zoe they named her zoe that's a nice name amen god's own life he's zoe he's z he's everything you love him this morning let's take the lord's communion stand with me if you will bow your heads ask yourself if you're really as thankful as what you should be for what god is and for what he means to you and if he's not as much as what you know he should be why don't you raise your hand say god i want you to be more greater i want you to be my all in all you are my everything lord i want you to be my everything my breath my sunshine my all in all because the great creator became my savior and all god's fullness dwelleth in him lord jesus you see the hands that are up and every one of us in this hour can put you second and third so easily lord we ask god that you'd help us to keep you first you are the first help us to keep you first in our lives let you keep leading us and guiding us wherever you want us to go wherever that leads we'll follow lord our hands are up we raise to you and say god help us to never become unappreciated lord jesus but to appreciate more and more everything that you are to us lord and we ask god your blessing upon every heart and hand help us to have a closer walk now father in jesus name amen now also lord jesus we just want to ask god that you'll bless the communion service that we're about to partake of bless the reading of the word and every portion of it in jesus name as we remember you and what you did hallelujah amen if you will turn your bibles amen to first corinthians the eleventh chapter verse 23 says for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this too in remembrance of me after the same manner he also took to cup and when he had sup saying this cup is the new testament in my blood these two years after she drink it in remembrance of me just let's just try to imagine the lord doing this okay
