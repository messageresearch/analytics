Psalms 143 hear my prayer oh Lord give ear to my supplication in thy faithfulness answer me and in thy righteousness for the enemy hath persecuted my soul he has smitten my life down to the ground he hath made me dwell in darkness as those that have been long dead foreign I remember the days of old I meditate on all thy works I Muse on the work of thy hands Hear Me speedingly O Lord my spirit faileth High not by face from me lest Debbie like unto them that go down into the pit Deliver Me O Lord from mine enemies I flee unto thee to hide me Quicken Me O Lord for thy name's sake for thy righteousness sake bring my soul out of trouble and of thy mercy cut off mine enemies and destroy all them that afflict my soul for I am thy servant God bless you may be seated brother Brian foreign brothers and sisters that second verse of that Psalm there and are not into judgment with thy servant for in their sight shall no living man be justified and without Christ this morning we'd be in trouble this morning you would turn to uh oh I mark my place right Deuteronomy the 15th chapter you know there was a quote up there about Victory Day and I was just thinking this morning you know how many I can only speak for myself I say that a lot but how many times have you been up on top of the mountain everything is going good the birds are singing everything is perfect and you think it's going to be like that forever and then all of a sudden in Split Second you go from that mountain all the way down to the lowest Valley but in it all you know that God's got you by your by your hands he's holding you through the circumstances and I've always found in my life when things are going the greatest they're going the best you think you're doing great all of a sudden the next second something major happens something crazy happens and you realize that you can't trust in anything that you see or anything you feel the only thing you can trust in is the word of God and I was thinking this morning as I was praying I uh every every morning I used to go to work early in the morning and I I used to listen to brother cook on the radio and uh he would always talk about uh Expo I'm not going to pay the way he preached he would take a scripture and a scripture in the scripture and I was laughing because I realized why he would do that because you know sometimes some ministers they know that the only word people are here that day out of the box some people just will not read their Bible won't study the Assembly of God I'm hoping there's no one here like that this morning but I was reading here in Deuteronomy here this morning and brother Brandon I'm talking many messages out at the end of it but I was just thinking about a different subject out of it you it um I'll just read here and at the end of every seven years this is the 15th chapter of Deuteronomy and I do that old devotional that I'm sure everyone has but I I just can't read one chapter so I wind up being chapters ahead most of the time and then having to go back but I'm that many chapters ahead and I was reading in here and it said at the end of every seven years that I shall make a release this goes to if if um if your brother in in the Israeli day if your brother loans you money on the seventh year you were if he didn't pay that debt completely off you were supposed to forgive him of that debt but I'll just read what it says at the end of every seven years it also make a release and this is the manner of the release every creditor that lenteth ought on to his neighbor so release it too bad the banks weren't like that today and it's all not exactly his neighbor or of his brother because it is called the Lord's release so he's telling Moses through the Lord is telling the people that if you own your brothers anything after seven years you're supposed to release it or at the form of thou Mouse exactly again so he's saying if it's a foreigner you loan it to or do something for he's liable for the debt but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release say when there be no poor say one there be no poor among you for the Lord shall greatly blessedly in the lamb which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it so God promised the children of Israel that he would Prosper them so much that that there wouldn't be any prob poverty in the land he goes on to say here only if thou carefully hearken and then there's a caveat to this there always is as long as you do what God told you to do this those things will happen there's there's always the carrot and the stick with in the Old Testament you either take the turret or there you go and again you have to stay I miss say when there shall be no poor among you for the Lord shall greatly bless thee in the Lamb with the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it I hate honor don't take me out of context we're in in a different period here we're in the period of Grace only if that Commandments which I command thee this day so these first four verses will come about in the life of the children of Israel if they obey everything God told him to obey for the Lord thy God bless thee he promised me to doubt shall reign over many Nations but thou shall not Reign Over thee so he's given promises here if there be among you a poor man of one of my brethren within any of the gates in Thailand which the Lord thy God givethly and and this is this speaks to the age that we're in right now thou shall not hardened thy heart and they're sat behind hand from the poor brother but thou shall open my hand wide unto him and shall surely lend him sufficient for his need and that which he wanted that there be not a thought of in thy Wicked heart saying the seventh year of releases that end and uh evil eye be evil against thy poor brother but thou give some not if you come across that you come across that seventh year if you have an evil heart or evil way that you know basically what is saying if you're in the sixth or in the seventh year if you find yourself not helping your brother and sister you better you better be careful because if you're letting that knowing that the release is coming it shouldn't but if you would chill with me or I was thinking also another thing in the Bible if you I'll just read these things I've lost my place here this morning if you turn with me to Philippians the third chapter but I was going to go back here sometimes uh that's my place already you never know what's going on you you can't allow yourself to be if you all just finished with this this morning I was sitting there you know you you can come up here with a lot of things on your mind a lot of things on your heart and all of a sudden you can go blank that you don't want to say anything that would be out of character or out of place for for what's going on I lost my place and my train of thought this morning I I'm not afraid to be honest if you return with me to Philippians the third chapter or the fourth chapter I'll just read these thoughts and I can sit down this because you know I have that I have it in that uh I have it right here I read this a lot I some of you have those those books those healing thought books what deals have but it comes out of this scripture when I'm going a different direction but I'll read what brother Brown have to say about it and then I'll read out of the scripture where it comes from and I'll sit down with that and it goes back to what I was reading in Deuteronomy God expects us as Christians to be good brothers and sisters to treat each other with kindness with love with compassion and not to think of ourselves more than we really are and uh and what I thought about in Deuteronomy that chapter we read if you read in the gospels how the scribes and the Pharisees and Sadducees were yeah they had totally perverted the word of God and they were not treating their brothers and sisters like really the Old Testament told them they should and it's no different for us as Christians God has an expectation for us to be at a certain level the way we treat people and react with people and I'll just read this quote I read this a lot but this comes out of the healing thought it comes out of spiritual adoption I can't tell you the page but it says in order to stay with God you have to stay gentle and uh for I can only speak for this man that's a hard thing to do sometimes it's hard to step back and not to say a harsh thing or say a harsh word in order to stay with God Stay Stay gentle God is gentle God is really gentle he never he's a gentleman he doesn't force you to do something he might lead you and push you to do something but he's not going to force you to do anything and he goes on the same in order to stay with God stay with love God is love stay Meek don't ever be self-sufficient I got to raise my hand I'm a man I like being self-sufficient is it good for me no I already need to depend more on the grace of God and his leading in my life than I depend on my own right hand always rely upon him never use your own mind take his thoughts but his thoughts be your thoughts fake them in your carnal mind so even though maybe you haven't had this relationship like you need to have but brother Brandon has given you a principle like any good minister of the Gospel will give you you might not have that experience yet but if you'll take the word of God and continually read it and apply it daily just keep reading it breeding it reading and you'll find that thought that's in that word of God will possess you and that'll be the thought that you need and he goes his thoughts and we know what his thoughts are his thoughts are the word of God I got laid out here this morning it's not what I think it's what God's word says let his thoughts be your thoughts take them into your carnal mind repeat them over and over so you not that not that you pay Prairie part of them probably but you can't read the same scripture enough again and again until it becomes a part of your heart and your life over and over and say oh God take all my doubt away let my thoughts be your thoughts and that's really hard in the age like I say there's so much out there trying to possess your mind and your souls out there it takes a long time sometimes after dealing with everyone out there in the world to let to get quiet enough that your thoughts and God thoughts can be the same thing so I take my doubt away let my thoughts be your thoughts just Cast Away the thought of sickness takes God's healing thought let them become your thoughts and think on these things but you whatever it is it could be sickness it could be Financial Health that you need whatever it is you just gotta continually think on those things and pray on those things and I'll just read what this says here and then sit down it's the it's actually the fourth child Factory first rejoice in the lord always and I again say rejoice and that's where this this that's where this quote would go back to let your moderation begin on to all men and the Lord is at hand and that's really necessary in the age there's no moderation out there in the world it should be in the Christian church but in the world there's no moderation anymore be known unto all men the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication and with Thanksgiving let your requests be known unto God and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus and that's a real important principle right there you just got to let go and sometimes and let God have his way is it easy to do no it's not easy to do but it's required finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure what's wherever things are lovely whatsoever thing are good report if there be any verb if there be any praise think on these things and it goes back to what I was reading about from those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of Peace shall be with you so you can't read God's word enough you can't pray enough that's what you know that's one truth out there you can't do though you can't read God's word too much you can't read the message too much you can't pray too much actually I I can only speak to myself you find yourself not doing it enough but you can't do it you can't do it too much the more you do it the stronger you get for the age that we live in Brother David amen you love the Lord this morning let's stand if we could and [Applause] it's just good to be in the house of the Lord isn't it amen let's sing that little course I Love You Lord and I

to think of that song a little course and I Just Want to Thank You Lord and as I was just driving and the spirit of the Lord just come in the truck and I just begin to cry and I thought Lord you've just been so good to me I just want to thank you this morning you know and you say well I thank him but I I believe the Thanksgiving that we give the Lord it should be as much as we can do because so much he's done for us of course he might not done a lot for you but he's done so much for me this morning you know I just I just I I think sometimes of all the people in the world that he could have chose he chose me he jokes me and I just I say Lord help me to be what you want me to be and man this song Come On My Heart this morning and it's on page eight we sing it a lot it's all I want to see him this morning and and I heard I heard some uh people singing a song on the radio and and they injected the party there's a new name in glory and it's mine I thought do you give us a revelation Lord

about y'all last night too so amen y'all forgive me there's something that's a magnet or something that just sucks all your thoughts up when you come out here so amen and Bill Joe I want to say that about 11 30 last night in prayer what me and you talked about God laid on my heart that you was going to do God's got a blessing for you I was at a word loss I didn't know what to say because sitting in prayer last night God told me exactly what he was going to say in it just means so much to me and I pray God's blessing on the church on on each and every one of you so forget the scripture we'll go to the scripture this morning amen appreciate each one of you being out and did you come to health church this morning hey man it's uh it's one thing to gather together it's another thing to have church there's a lot of churches across the land that are gathering as large as wood and they're getting together and they're singing songs and they're doing the best that they know how but there's something different when we can allow God to take control when we can get out of the way and say God it isn't about me it isn't about me but it's about you and you know I uh I've learned that I can make a mess out of a lot of things but if I can let him have control it's it's all in his hands and First Corinthians 2 and then in Matthew 28 we'll take a couple of scriptures First Corinthians 2 wrote very familiar to you and uh I tell you this was over the winter time and we was a snowstorm come through and we didn't know was going to have church or not Sunday and Saturday morning we I rode out to the church there to because you've ever been there church it sits on a hill there and there's ice and snow just covered the parking lot you don't want nobody to have a break and went out to the church and we sit there at the church and just sitting there praying and as the sun come up you begin to see it just all fall away a little thought come to me the power of the Sun the power of the Sun First Corinthians 2 verse 1 says in our Brethren when I came to you came to not with Excellence of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determine determine not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ in him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling in my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of men's wisdom but a demonstration of spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God it's not what you and I can do but it's what he can do through each and every one of us in Matthew 28 and with the Lord's help we'll try to tie them together and and say something to bless you this morning Matthew 28 verse 16. is the last commission that Christ give to the to us and he's letting us know that it just wasn't him but now it's you with that same power Matthew 28 says then the 11 disciples went away into Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them and they saw him and they worshiped him but some doubted Jesus came and he spoke unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth it's all power was given unto me and he says all that I am I poured it into the church it does no good to tell a history it does no good to think about what Christ did if he can't live inside of you today you are the living Christ today you are the example to the world today and now he's saying all that I have I'm going to give it to you he says now you go you therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commended you and lo I Am With You Always even to the end of the world Amen Heavenly Father Lord we love you Lord we truly appreciate you Lord and Lord so many things can be said about your love and what you've done in this morning Lord you've heard the testimonies Lord you've heard the teaching Lord you've heard the songs of Zion Lord and Lord I believe that you're pleased with us this morning Lord you truly love us and we truly love you and this morning we ask now Lord that I myself can get out of the way Lord and Lord I would make a mess and I would say things that was of an uncertain sound that Lord if you'll take control we'll hear the voice and they'll go Lord God and not Lord we ask you to be with us Lord let me step aside use this vessel use their vessels let them hear what you'd have them to say in your lovely name we pray amen and amen and you have your seats this morning I think this morning is and I'm going to take this off I don't know why we even wear it out here sometimes oh nothing the one preacher when he starts preaching he starts rolling his sleeves up you know so whatever's you're comfortable let's just be comfortable in him this morning but in 1965 we'll fall that I come across that just just did me good and I think there's so much in that is the power of the Sun and we begin to think that all that Christ did but that wasn't good enough because now he performs it in you and I and he says and who is this Melchizedek in 1965 he says but one day his mama flew over and she screamed and he recognized it he said that sound why why he was an eagle to begin with he was always an eagle but one day he heard that equals cry he said you always a child of God even when you lived in sin you as a child of God God knew you before the foundation of the world but one day you had to hear that voice and that voice was a certain sound it wasn't an uncertain sound it ranged true on the inner being of you and you believe that's what your calling was and he said and that's the way it is with the gospel or the word or the power of Jesus Christ when a man has been predestinated to eternal life he hears that true ring that scream of God and nothing can keep him from it amen nothing can keep you from it this morning and and I believe is the powers that says we would type it and we would think of the natural realm and the power of that son and and you know it could be a cold bitter day but if that sun peers out between the clouds you can feel the warmth of that sun you can feel the warmth of that sun on your body and it would melt away all of the eyes it would it would melt away all of the snow but there's something about the power of that sun that nothing contained that hour nothing can calm that's and you you know man creates air conditioners but you know what you go down the road and that sun coming through the windshield still produces heat you got to keep cranking it up to get it out because you can't contain that power but spiritually speaking it's the same way with the power of the Son of God the power of the Son of God nothing to contain it from moving what God had called him to do as he would walk upon his Landing in the days that he lived here on the Sea of Galilee as he would begin to demonstrate in power of His heavenly father there was nothing could hold him back there was no devil that could hold him back there was no depression that could hold him back when he walked in he took control of the situations when he walked in he took control of every circumstance there was out there and I believe if we can look and we can also see that same God is living in you and I denied that same God is a part of our being that we take control that's why we can be happy that's why we can be joyous when the devil gives us things and he trips us up and he gives us sicknesses it gives us Temptation there's something in us that can overcome that why because we have the power of the sun inside of us they can overcome all that the enemy has and that's what makes the enemy mad because like he said like what David was saying he don't understand that he can do all of this to us and we come to church anyway and we praise God anyway because there's something inside of us that is reflecting the Son of God and nothing contain that nothing can take control of that and begin to say to quote with your own he said oh the church might say days of Miracles is passed brother when it goes cluck cluck cluck talking about the chickens he said stand here and eat this stand here and eat that he said oh the Barnyard stuff won't do anymore come on church God when we heard that Mother's cream when we heard the word for her day it go in her ears the denominations would not work anymore what they had was not satisfy anymore what they had would not give us a satisfaction anymore because we had heard from another rhythm Church we're living in a day that the word for her day is there is a pride that is preparing to be raptured away we don't want to hear about what the denomination say we don't want to hear about what politics say we don't want to hear about all the criticism and all the falling away we want to hear what the word is saying to the church and it is to be ready for a child he said that barnyard stuff won't do anymore he said he's gone he said now all things are possible see he gets off the ground you know he talked about that mother Eagle he said he began to Flap his ring and he began to come off the ground you know what when you come off the ground you don't see things like there was anymore when you're down in the middle of that monk when you're down the middle of the mirror things look so depressing things looks like you can't overcome but if you ever get up on the chart of God come on if you ever get up on the Mountaintop if you ever look back down you'll see the power son there's nothing that can overcome that power and now that if you're laying in that monk you know what you need to know you need to do like David did when David come and they took his wife so they took his children it's a scripture would say that David went and intercouraged himself in the Lord what did he do he went back to that Mountaintop experience come on children of God he went back to that Mountaintop experience and he saw something was real he saw that same Mountaintop experience what did it do it created something in him it showed him that the power of the sun was real it showed him that he didn't matter where he found himself the power of the sun would get melt what did he do he went back to God you know to God that's what we need to do we're living in a day that every time you turn the news radio negative negative negative Lord I'll be talking about now it's a submarine come on are you gonna laugh it's funny I mean thankfully that they died I'm not saying that but come on really men trying to do things that are outside of their realm come on people look at what we're living we're living in a day that the men in this world is trying to be Gods they're trying to take things in their control but without the power of the sun they cannot do it come on children of God without the holy ghost in your lives you cannot live this life without a baptism of the Holy Ghost in your life without being born again Jesus says ye must be born again why because he knew we didn't have a chance without that power come on oh you can put a tie on oh you can look good oh you can come to church and you can full half the congregation that everything's all right but you ain't fooling yourself you're looking in your own life and you know where you're walking and you know you need the power of God in your life brother Jonathan how do you know that because I was there come on church I'm not so spiritual that I'm above anybody I'm as human as anybody in this building I've lived and I wanted I laid in that presence to where I knew what the power of God was I knew what the power of the sun was but it hasn't resonated inside of me yet and it didn't do me any good when a trial would come I would fall flat on my face when the enemy would come I would do the exact option what I knew I should do I was raised in this message I knew what I should do I knew what I should say I knew how I should live but I couldn't do until I had a reflection of that power in my life brother Brendan goes on down and he says and that's what's the matter with so many Christians today they can't get their feet off the ground children of God that's what's wrong with this day we're looking around at all of our problems we're looking around at all of our symptoms we're looking around at all of our sickness we're looking around at all the politics and what not looking to the power of the sun we're not looking to God and seeing what he has in store for us you remember the scripture would tell us he says he that begin a good work in you he shall finish it come on has he been a good work in you come on don't be ashamed of it has he became a good work in you that if he's beginner could work in you then the power of the son is laying inside of you and you're ready to shine to the world see the problem is we got too many message preachers that can quote all the quotes come on come on they can quote all the crows they can get you excited they can make you run and Shout but have they told you anything about the power of the Sun have they told you anything about Jesus Christ this is You Don't Preach Jesus you ain't preaching the same message I am come on George we take all this message Theology and it's gotten as bad as bad as theology come on church we take all this message Theology and we get off into so many look there ain't a denomination out there that is messed up as that is the message come on churches we be honest oh we want to protect our little patents and act like that no we got more confusion under the name of William Branham than any other Martin Luther John Luke whatever you want to count them out why because we left the power of the Sun and we went to men's ideals and we demands creeds come on I'll tell young people all the time don't ever bring one to me to justify your life don't do it because number one the first thing it told me you're defensive and if you're defensive then that means God's dealing with you and trying to show you the power of the Sun and trying to lead you out and into a better life but you're fighting with everything you have to keep from moving on imma tell you why we're not further along than we are because of you and me come on it ain't because of the world it ain't because of the denominations it ain't because of the ones that worshiped by profit it ain't because of all the critics in this message it's because it's you and I the bride of Christ is yet to stand and take her position and realize the power's not in denomination the power's not in the critic the power's not in the Theologian it's in the pride of Christ this morning well I just don't know if I can stand against them you can't but he can come on Judge when are we going to let go and let God have his way when are we going to let go so you know what I don't care what anybody else thinks about me if I jump up and shouting then I want them to look because there's something inside of me that's revealing to the world there's a power laying there or something in my life do you really think you know I've said this before y'all heard me say it we can go to any Old Testament story we can go to any new testament story and we can find do you really think that David wanted to face Goliath in himself David you Goliath was a bigger man David knew glass was trained in Warfare but there was a power laying in him come on Church there was something laying inside of him that got offended when Goliath come against the God that he served and he said you know what I don't know what I'm going to do but I know my God is not going to stand for this come on church I know that my God isn't going to stand for this devil I know that my God it's not going to stand against the devil attacking the body they would switch them and there's a power inside of a Ministry today there's a power instead of a pride today that's going to stand up and say he that is within me it's greater than he that's in the world come on Church the power of the Sun it took Moses what did he do to Moses Moses was scared to go down to Egypt come on Moses ran and hid on the backside of the desert and we say oh why did he do that the same way that we do come on church it's the same thing that we do when God calls you to do something you run and hide from it come on church I can hear you he running here but when he got in the presence of the power of the Sun you know what he did he grabbed him a cane he said Aaron come on we're gonna go take over why there was something changed in his life he got recognized that's who he was he recognized that it was more than his Godly flesh it was more than what his mind could do but now there was a power inside of him what he did he looked at the Lord he looked at the bush he looked at the example of the power of son in his life and he said what shall I say maybe that's what we should do come on church instead of trying to figure it out himself come on come on it's the whale you know I've been here before and I know exactly what they're going through no you don't if you ain't sitting in their shoes you don't know what they're going through we trial every temptation to fix every individual a different way you may have known what it did to you but you don't know what he's doing to them you don't know how hard it is for them come on Church some of us have quit smoking and we think you know you just gotta set a man or attitude you do but you know what there's a demon inside of that tobacco nicotine there's a demon inside of that nicotine that latches a hold of an individual's soul and without the power of the sun they scrum it come on Church there's a power in that alcohol that gets a hold of the soul of that individual you can go through Alcoholic Anonymous you could go through all of the meetings and they still struggle with it out of their lives but if you ever get in the power of the Sun it takes you to desire out of your heart it takes a desire out of your soul and the power of the sun comes down in your life angels but yeah we want to figure it out come on Church come on Church we want to figure our own problems that we want to be the man of the house let me tell you something Jesus is the man of my house I can't figure it out come on but he can figure it out every time I get to the place that I can't go no further and then I let go and I let God have his way that's when Miracles begin to happen it's not because I read so much it's not because I quoted so much it's not because I prayed so much it's not because I went to church so much it's because I let go and I said the power of the sun resembles in my life I let you take control of this vessel I let you live in my life I let you take control of this situation what is it too many of us we're too worried about what everybody else thinks we've left notes now y'all pulling this morning y'all pull our preaching come on Church what is it we're too worried about all the symptoms around yo we got people in the ministers that knows more about politics than they know about the Bible what's wrong with this come on church I'm just being real this morning okay what's wrong with this we got people on Facebook that are quote CNN but they won't quote The Profit come on Church what is it that we believe we believe that this last day message in this hour that the son himself walked upon the Earth gave the commission oh God brought a prophet upon the sea to show us the message for our day which is there is a pride why do you think he never pointed at himself who points at him everybody that's gotta gotta confused accepted you and they try to build him up and make him something more than he is that was a prophet of God I don't take nothing away from what God used him for but that is not the god that is the vessel that God used and in that vessel he brought a bride to recognize the power of the son in her Daddy you know what you want to know what happened if that man come back he'd tear up about 90 of message churches in this land come on church I don't know if I'd want to be there I don't know if I'd want to be there because he would tear the hide off of about 90 of message believers because we're not doing what he asked us to do he told us he gave us a word he told us the power of the son was in Christ alone it is in the Savior it is in the Lord Jesus Christ he says all that I do I do because he gives me the right that was free come on Church what is it first Thessalonians 1 we find in first Thessalonians 1 chapter 1 verse 4 said knowing Brethren beloved your election of God you know what somebody can't come tell you that you're saved you know I've met too many people that have lived good righteous life but never had the power of the son in them come on Church what happens to the one that I fell away look there's ministers that have preached this for 40 years and they fell away what happened they was told that they were Son of God but they never experienced the power of the sun because once Moses experience the power of the sun no devil in hell could stop you from what God called him to do what you experience the power of the sun there's no devil in hell that can stop you from going to the rapture there's no deceptive power there's been Trust it's a power but we get on that for a minute if you want to you realize we live in the day of influencers oh Lord help us there should be one influencer and that's him but we dress like the influencer dresses come on Church y'all are not blind y'all see the tactics of the enemy you'll see what the world's doing it's trying to influence you away from the power of the sun it's trying to influence you into the power of the world the power of devil the power of Politics the power of churches the power of denominations all right I'll give you an example of course the first thing that a pastor does when he starts to leave this man he takes too many churches seeing it happened too many times they take the picture down and they take the books out of the best of you why because he's starting to try to influence you away from the word for your day come on Church come on he's trying to influence you and get your mind away from everything why is it that Catholic Church he don't want you to read your Bible because then you come with questions because they thought they want to place oh it's a Matthew 28 it's baptism and Trinity and then and the three godhead but then when you start reading your Bible you catch a revelation like Peter did you come across Acts 2 and you go wait a second something don't sound right about what that is saying there's something true in the word of God that says that the name of the Father the name of the son the name of the Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ if they don't want you to see that so they try to pull the material back and he influence you under their influence you better get away from anything like that anybody that tells you not to read the Bible and not have questions you better get away from them because I promise you there ain't a man alive that has every answer to this Bible there's a man living or walking or has ever walked outside of Jesus Christ that knows every every question in this Bible that knows every answer but God laid it there and what did he do he played it out so perfectly that he would Place Jesus upon this Earth that he replaced the prophets upon this Earth they replace pastors teachers evangelists prophets Apostles upon the Earth so that we could enter into the word of God and we could preach from the Oracles of God and say I may not have the interest but he has the answer because he is the power of the son knowing brother and blood your election of God for our Gods will come not unto you in word only but also in power come on Church the bride ain't some deep down red-headed stepchild that don't ever get away come on get that thought out of your head we got the young people running around going man they're living for God's like this I don't know if I should live for god well you know what you're not living for the right God because you start living for the God that I live for it makes you happy it makes you celebrate it makes you run it makes you you shout amen it makes you jump up and down it makes you want to go to church not just because mama said but there's something inside of you you start dragging Mama to church because the Shins today there's a lot of message Believers today that needs the power of the son to start melting back the cold hearts come on we're ashamed to say Amen in church what's wrong with us God is living in the Praises of his people I want to praise him this morning I want to say God here I am to worship and to magnify your name here I am to reflect the power of God in my life thank you you get hot enough your family will get hot too well I I don't want to affect them where you are come on live in that cold better life you're affecting them come on Church living that life will you tell them you have to go to church and then you sit there in a queue like this you don't think every one of your kids is looking at you come on man of God come on man of God you don't think every child is looking at you as an example going well he don't even want to be here either he ain't even happy to be here but you let the spirit of God you let the power of the Sun reflect upon your life you go running down that aisle one time and you see a whole Caravan of young people running behind you because they realize the power of the sun is real in his life there's something that's anointed of God in an individual's life they just don't care anymore half my life come on he got me so sloppy drunk that I made a fool of myself come on I come to light poem Burger King parking lot and waved at everybody come on he made a fool out of me so do you think I care if God makes a fool of me God make a fool of me let me be any Chapel to the world that the power of the son is living inside of me didn't I maybe I need to climb the light pole and start Chelsea down tracks now come on whatever you want me to do God let the power power reflect in this life let the power of the Sun reflect in this so bad you know what when I was a kid I was 13 14 year old look I'm gonna say this but I'm gonna tell the young people something first there's coming a generation that you're going to listen to what your elders are saying and you're gonna have to live this way you're not going to have to live for the devil there's a greater testimony in a young person's life that they can stand up before the church won't testimony died and say I've never smoked I've never drunk I've never lusted after a woman I've never did these things why because the power of the sun was in my life for my youth and I represented God in my ear come on Church too many of our young people has got this interpretation in their heads that they've got to go into the world and sin that's a lie of the devil the greatest testimony is is to stand up and say I lived every day of my life for God come on Church you say it ain't possible oh it's possible with the power of the sun you know what you let some young person 12 13 11 10 you don't put an age limit on it you let God come down into their life sanctify that Soul baptize them again with the feelness with the fullness of the Holy Spirit and they'll live a better life than the adults in the church and you don't even have to tell them to come home Church because it's the power of the sun inside of them they don't have to be told right from who there's something inside of them that is leading them to do rights they know what happened to us come on come on until I got the power of the Sun in me I didn't make good choices I didn't do the right thing I ran from God I fought and kicked against everybody that he replaced but when it said he was flashing red lights you know what I'd look back in my life and I see flashing red lights all along the way but you know what I come to find out that once I welcome the power of the Sun in my life the red lights went away and now they're green light as I'm running for the Lord and I'm here to tell you you don't have to sin to be a son of God to be a daughter of God somebody tell me one time they talked about mother Ron they talked about his testimony through the fire and they said oh I want that testimony I said I don't want that testimony praise God for his testimony but I don't want to burn like that come on Church come on Church young people goes well I want some great testimony that's the greatest testimony the greatest testimony that a young person could say come on it's to stand up before their peers before young people and say you know y'all all talk about that but let me tell you about one come on church let me tell you about one that when the Devil Comes attempted to be this move there was one inside of me that said that ain't for you and I just destroyed at that devil I would stood that Temptation and I stood on the word of God and God did that why the power of the Sun oh but you're just a child you know God loves using children come on come on there's more examples of young kings and prophets in the bible than there are old ones typically the old ones are set in their ways like so come on Church typically the old ones that are in this scripture are like oh and they're sitting in their ways and they got it figured out themselves and they don't need the power of the son because they got it all in control and then here comes a little young boy called Dave come on it's a whole David it says Dave you're gonna be the king Saul can't even listen to the word of God anymore come on Church that's what's wrong with a lot of our old people in the message we send around message views all my life and we've got it figured out who's going to be the next Pastor who's going to be the next song who's going to be the next preacher and we're not allowing God to move in our lives cause we got it all figured out well you don't understand I've been in the message 50 years I don't care has the message been in you come on come on show your son or daughter of God that that power of the son that message has been inside of them and I'll show you one with humility I'll show you one with power I'll show you one with strength I'll show you one that has an overcoming life I'll show you true victory because it don't matter who the next faster is they're going to serve God anyway come on it don't matter what the song witness says they're going to serve God anyway look I don't know why people are people God allows us to be ourselves so much that we get out of the will of God we get a man to come up here and start to pray any any fumbles over his word and we think that he's out of the anointing what if he's in the annoying come on Church we take a preacher or we take brother to come up here and begin to teach and he loses his train of thought and we start thinking oh he didn't pray enough well what if he did what if that's God choosing him to enter himself so that God can speak what he wants to speak to you come on I can study 12 hours a day seven days a week have exactly what I was going to preach to you at midnight last night and at 10 30 this morning God said no go this way come on charge come on maybe that's why I ain't following the notes because I don't have much but God said go this way and if I'm going to go that way if I'm going to be obedient to God it's greater for me to get out of the way and say God speaks something to your people this morning let them know it's not my fireworks but it's by his words through you come on Church oh my beloved your election of God for a gospel come not unto you by word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in most Assurance as you know what men are men we are among you for your sake and you become followers of us and of the Lord having received the word and much Affliction with the joy of the Holy Ghost all right so we're gonna stop there for a minute I'll look around the world and I see a bride that's walking around like this come on I have yet to be to a wedding in the natural that the bride didn't know she was the center point of attention come on they even get drama about it I'm you gonna wait on them didn't put that day they ain't gonna get out of the chair if they need something to drink one of the bridesmaid's gonna go get them a drink it's gonna run it over to them come on you know and you should because that's the bride's day that's her day that's her single day that everything is about her sorry man it ain't about you it's about her you're just a lucky one that gets to participate in the ceremony it's about the bride if the bride's shoes are two types somebody's going to Walmart to buy some more come on no holds bar whatever the bride wants to buy a kids come on Church you're the bride of Christ whatever you want you get you need to start living that way you need to get your face up off the ground you need to pick your head up throw your shoulders back let the world know I'm the bride of Christ if you want to be a part of me then you've got to be born again I saw a sign the other day coming to my head I'll share it with you I saw a sign the other day talking about all these perversion in this world that well I never was a boy I was a girl you liar he was a boy when he was born it's Church signed they posted a church sign and they said if you didn't like your first balloon try getting born again come on try getting born again because Jesus says You must be born again you take that perversion attitude you take that perversion spirit that is all over this world you get them born again they won't let there know whether they're a boy or a girl they're no they're a Son of God they're a daughter of God why because something the power of this certain reflects in that life takes the perversion out of their head I would have never did that that yeah you would have come on if it wasn't for the power of the Sun where would we be today come on children of God don't get so high-minded that you think that you're impossible to be tricked that you're impossible where the scripture said that the broadcast can't be deceived amen but it didn't say you wouldn't fight you way all the way there come on church we need to learn humility in strength come on humidity ain't just laying down and letting the dogs kick you humility ain't just walking around with your head down oh I'm just no no humility is when Jesus Christ stood out on the wall he stood out upon the Mountaintop and he began to preach to him he was humble man but yet what he would do he would look to him and he says but if you don't eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part in me and they said oh that's not humility oh it's humility he just recognized who he was he just recognized the truth that without the power of the son you have no option to Victory you have no way to overcome it you have no way to a joyous life but if you'll realize that and you step back and say he's speaking to me he's speaking to me and I want the power of the son so I'm going to take the book and I'm going to eat the book because the word of God is the Flesh of Christ come on and I'm gonna allow that power to live in me he said you become followers of us in the Lord having received the word and so much Affliction with the joy of the Holy Ghost some of us need some jewelry restored come on Church some of us this morning that you raise our hands and say God restore unto me the joy of thy salvation Lord make me like I was that night I come off the altar toward nothing in the world mattered anymore the house payment didn't matter the car payment didn't matter what I drove didn't matter what my friends said didn't matter what the world said didn't matter all that mattered was I was in communication with you and the world could do what they wanted to do but I knew I wasn't right not really but he is good because he sets forth tactics to get everybody to fight amongst themselves and he's sitting over in the corner with his foot propped up going there ain't nobody hitting me with an uppercut in two years because they're too worried about their brothers and their sisters come on Church could you imagine when he or Seymour happened and they sent all of them fighter jets over there to drop that bomb if two or three of them Pilots would have started fussing amongst themselves about where the bombs should go and this and says it should have went there and this and says it should have been there and this and said No it should have been this court and vision said no it wasn't at the river and this it said oh the cloud wasn't true come on and they began to argue in their self the bomb would have dropped harmlessly out in the middle of the Pacific come on and in Japan would have knew that America was after them and then Japan wanted to be fortified their defenses and they would have been ready for the attack but see they went with one common goal come on Church they went with one common goal the power of the sun and the power of the sun was a general sitting on the couch and the general sitting on the capitol John had the plans figured out and nobody was there to argue with him because he had the final say come on God he's got the final say he done got your War plan figured out he's done got you in and he figured out he doesn't know it's where to attack that devil he don't need you to change the coordinates he needs you to be a good pilot and hold the sticks and say okay there's the coordinates I'll just push the button come on Church that's I need you and I to do you don't need us to argue with his word he don't need us to argue with one another when I think that we should conduct church this way I'm about to get to something come on church I think that we should conduct this church this way because brother said do it this way and I think when I think that he meant this way and the devil's sitting back there going I got him again do what he needs us to do it's the God how do you want the church to be done you know what God says he put it in his scripture he says I elect pastors to be over the church come on Church you agree with this just say amen I elect pastors to support provide over the church and give them what they have made of I was at a church one time and and the pastor had had preached three services in a woe about women cutting their hair come with me you know oh Mr better than you I don't know what the pastor's thinking there ain't a single sister in our church that's cut their hair I said well what if the enemy's talking to him come on church and you can't see that you don't know the Warfare the spiritual warfare that is going on in the church but the pastor's subject to getting himself away and God has revealed to him what the church is finding just because you hadn't done it don't mean you ain't fighting it he looked at me and he says you really think so and I said oh I really think so I really think so I really believe that God uses pastors to hit his spirits before it manifestes itself see that's the power of the Sun the power of the sun gives a minister ability to root out that devil come on to root out that devil before it even manifestes itself see we've got something on the devil that he don't have on us the devil don't know what we're thinking until we say it come on brother Brown said that we can go find the quote right past if you need me to brother Brandon said that brother Brown says I won't say things sometimes or even talk about what I'm going to preach because until I say it the devil don't know what I'm thinking come on Church but see our God he already knows what the devil's thinking he's already pre-planned an overcoming power in your life through the power of the sun before the devil even attacks you well I'm just going to wait and see well I guess we're gonna have an all-night prayer meeting and get you back in line because if you're just going to wait and see the time you see what's going on it's too late but time you see what's going on that demon has already took control of your body that Spirit has done took control of your soul come on that perverted thought has done took control of your mind and now you have no power over it so now you need an old-fashioned prayer meeting because you need children of God to get around you and lay hand upon you and pray the power of the son from the heavens into your life so that it can combat what you've allowed to come upon yourself I know that's really hard I don't like being hard y'all forgive me [Music] but I'm not sorry because you know what that's how he attacks you off by yourself come on he gets you driving down the road by yourself and instead of turning the tape on you turn country music on come on oh man I have to do that come Church instead of turning a good gospel song on you turned 99-7 on and listened to the politics of the world come on Church come on and it begins to influence you and next thing you know you start agreeing with everything they're saying well you know what I think that guy's right yeah he's right all right in his own mind come on come on y'all know the scripture but if we could get away and say God maybe I'll just shut the radio off completely I'll just invite you to come down brother Carol used to say he'd reach over and dust the seat off on the passenger side and they say God won't you come ride with me won't you come sit in this seat if you got anything you'd like to tell me I'll just sit here listen yeah some of the best times in my life is riding down the road when I accidentally leave my cell phone at home I tell myself the radio don't work and I just ride with the power of the Sun setting beside me he begins to talk to me he begins to go you know what Jonathan if you're not careful you're going to let that little thing take over in your life Jonathan it may not be much now but if you keep going that way it'll take over in your life come on Church that's still a small voice begins to speak it begins to talk to our inner being what is that the power of the Sun it's beginning to fall back that coat and crusty heart he's beginning to stop back your own ideals what I think that I need to sit on the second row well maybe you need to sit on the front row ain't nobody up here maybe have a good opportunity come on Church come on you say go to message churches you got to get there early for a back row sorry brother Carol used to tell the people of the church when I was a little bit seven eight nine year old we had them some old videos now and you can almost see the smile on his face if we had a Nick on our finger we'd come up in the prayer line and get prayed for and some of the parents went to Brother Carol and told him since there's nothing wrong with them he says don't stop them he said they just like to feel the anointing of God come on Church maybe we need to feel the anointing of God more maybe we need to click holder to wish for it I'll come home church maybe we need to get in the anointing more maybe we need to get close to his presence more than we ever have you realize this world has gone insane you realize it's a prophecy being fulfilled that these very things that are happening now are happening on purpose but at the same time he said there's going to be a bride that has the power of the sun inside of her that's going to draw closer than she's ever been come on Church there's going to be things start falling away that we used to not see not the other way around come on Church I know it gets kind of hard in the middle let's just bear through it come on Church this message is drawing us closer to God not farther away from God gave me the victory over tobacco I'm not going back to tobacco God then gave me victory over alcohol I'm not going back to alcohol if God then gave me the victory of how I speak I'm not going back to the way I used to speak if God done gave me the victory of a sorry rotten attitude I'm not going back to a sorry rotten attitude God's gave me the victory over them I'm moving forward with him with the joy of the Holy Ghost he said so that's you or your samples to all that believe in the message alone in 1964 brother says like a little story I was reading the other morning a woman hollered to her husband who had got up early and went out to the morning paper and was reading the morning paper he said or she said is there anything in you in the news he said no just the same thing only different people boy if that ain't the truth I mean come on you ever read the newspaper found anything new it's just somebody else killed somebody else's brother but they still kill him and Robin he said oh no nothing new just say Mom same thing just different people he said that's about the way it is today the same thing he says we've got a new organization but the same old Doctrine come on church we got a new organization but the same old Doctrine he just patted around somebody's a little he's a big going this way or that way come on to her sit back and watch us destroy ourselves come what did they say about America they said the only way that America would ever be overtook by enemy power is that she destroyed herself from inside well guess what she's doing that now I hate to be the bearer of bad news but this great country that it once was is now destroying herself from the inside come on Church but that's a tap from the natural to the spiritual the only way that you will be overcome by the end I mean is if you destroy yourself from inside this church come on you're members of this church this is your church you ought to be proud that this is your church you ought to stand for one another when you see a brother and sister in a battle you ought to hold them up in prayer come on church when you see a brother and sister not come to church you ought to pick up the phone and call them and make sure they're okay not assume the worst maybe their car broke down and they need somebody to help them come on we ought to be unified as a bride around the word of God around the power of the Sun and realize this is the way of the Lord this is how he ordained us it's to be a body to be a group if my finger hurts my body hurts if my brother hurts I hurt if my sister hurts I hurt and I want us to come together and say under the power of the Son of God I want us to rise up he says but this is a new day he said Hallelujah he said this is a day that we should rise and shine why because we see prophecy being fulfilled come on we here how many is listening to tapes We Believe brother Brennan was a Prophet come on we hear what he said would happen in the end time right now it's happening in front of our eyes and so we see it happening and we realize it isn't me but it's him living in me that now I can be happy oh but you don't know man this War I tell you what what was it six months ago we all thought we was dead because Russia was going to come down on Ukraine I don't know what's going on I don't live over there I don't know what's going on but you know what that doesn't affect me come on church that doesn't affect the bride they can do whatever they want to over there and as long as you got your eyes upon the word you going home before the first bomb drops come we have a promise we have an example we have the power of the sun on our side that we cannot be defeated that we cannot be overcome that he's here to take his bride home but we got to get our eyes off of everything else and focus upon him he said this is a new day we should rise and shine in the power of Jesus Christ it's a gross Darkness standing upon the Earth he said there should be a new day for us he said yes indeed doing it the way he does but turn to his word and see the Promise come on what do you think little David did they returned to the word and says there shall be no enemy come against thee he goes oh wait gloss and anything if the word says there's no enemy to come against me I'm not worried about it come on Church he had the power of the sun you got the power of the sun when depression sets in in your life come on church when sickness sets in in your life when darkness overshadows your heart when anxiety comes upon your life you have the power of the son when the scripture says no weapon can be formed against you it wasn't just talking about guns and knives he was talking about spiritual warfare that we're fighting in a spiritual battle today that there's no weapon can be formed against you there's no anxiety that can be formed against you there's no depression that can be formed against you there's no temptation that can be formed against you that the power of the sun cannot get rid of but turn to his word see the Promise that's promised for this day and you'll know that you're living in this day come on I get excited when I see the world falling apart call me an idiot if you want to call me a Holy Roller if you want to but I start praising his name when I see politics fall into the Wayside well I see him wanting to vote and take the Ten Commandments out of the Capitol building I see it let me do I praise God we're a step closer to going home because when the world takes their eyes off of God that's when the bride's going to slip right on out of here because she's going to be looking into the word you realize that's why the world's not even going to know you're gone because the world's going to be too busy looking at their ideals and they're not going to be looking at the word they're not going to be looking oh they're still going to go to church but come on let's be honest do they really worship God in church anymore brother Brennan said they worshiped the devil and don't even know it come on church that's what he said I've got it if you need it they worship the devil and they don't even know it come on there's a message churches that are worshiping the devil and don't even know it because of men's Creeds because of man's ideals they want to put that man above that man that's the devil because that's the same thing they did in scripture in Daniel when they created a golden image of Bill's above and they said you know what that is the image of Daniel the Prophet you know that I don't just own scripture they created an image of the prophet and they wanted anybody to bow to the prophet but that Prophet had been preaching in the land that you shall not send no Idols before God that you shall not say no men before God you worship only the God himself and thank God for little three young people come on Nick Shadrach and abednia probably 12 13 14 year old they may have not knew their implications but they had heard the prophet's word come on they had heard the prophet preach and they knew they was not to bow to no image especially an image of the prophet but what have they done in our day I can go get it whether Brandon said the Gentile age was started out under man worship and it will go out under man worship and it's the prophet of that day they're trying to worship if that's what you're listening to you're listening to a perverted spirit because he would have never told you that he would have told you to worship him he would have told you to praise him he would have told you to worship the power of God that's living inside of you he would have told you greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world he would have told you the same holy ghost that I'm feeling you need to fill in your life the same Holy Ghost that's leading me needs to lead you in your life amen it is the rising of the Sun 1965. he said no matter here I am I told you I was getting somewhere I pulled this this morning he said no matter how many theologians claim how well you got your church set up let's message theologians in this message too well I think we need to do the prayer first and we need to do this you know what I think when he let the pastor set the order of the church because that's what scripture does no matter how many how much theologians claim how well you've got your church sent how much education you got how much like the Bible you have it until the wave Chief until the Holy Spirit comes upon that person to Quicken the word the gasoline represents the word it's the truth but without the spirit it won't move how many's heard the scripture the letter killeth Spirit giveth love come on in this message I'm not through beating on denominations I think our Prophet did that enough I'm gonna start beating on some message people in this message we've got it so perverted out with the word that we don't let God move in our churches no more come on Church we think that every Minister that gets up out of where his eye certainly some people even thinks you can't have court sleeves come on I'm just speaking truth and y'all know it they think they've got it all figured out and they don't even let God move in the church come on Church what if God wants some praise this morning are we willing to forget about everything else and just Praise Him we're willing to say God you're worthy of our praise God you're worthy of my hand being up you're worthy for me to say Amen you're worthy for me to praise you this morning he said we have too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the Dynamics said it needs the dynamic power of God the resurrection power of Christ Jesus upon the manifest and bring it to pass this is the gasoline it might be in a gasoline can and it could still be water see but the only proof of it is is put this life on it and it'll prove whether it's gasoline or not put it in a gasoline pill all you want to you throw it on a fire and it puts the fire out he wasn't gasoline that's what happens in our churches we walk around and say we got the Holy Ghost but when the Holy Ghost starts moving we put a little ourself on and we put the flame out you didn't have the Holy Ghost because if you got the Holy Ghost your little lick will line up with your little dick without up with your little leg the next thing you know we got a bonfire next thing you know we got a fire that the devil don't know what to do with next thing you know we gonna come together under the power of the sun we all take out a little leak of fire we put it to the well we lay our shoulder to the wheel and we say I'm pressing for something to happen this morning and God sits back and goes I'm about to come down and show you a thing or two because I'm about to manifest myself in you because you are a representation of the power of my life too many Treasures well I think sister so-and-so gets out of order well you know if you get out of order sometime you might get out overmore because sister also just got blessed come on Church sister so-and-so couldn't contain herself because she's been in a battle all week she's been fighting all week the devil was at our front door the devil was trying to take her child the devil was trying to take her hell she'd been battling all week and God just made her sit by himself will to her she he couldn't contain her Joy and brother Brown said that too said sometimes getting that order might be a good thing I'm just talking with your prophet and when you try to put the holy spirit in demonstration as much as you're trying you can get a sputter but you'll run you'll ruin the engine by giving it full of carbon come on Church some of you is mechanics some of you knows a little bit if I pour five gallons of gasoline in the carburetor of that old 77 jug it ain't gonna run it ain't gonna run y'all it's called flooding it out and you didn't flooded it out because you didn't have no mechanics to go with you Dynamics come on Church you can go to these meetings I don't know why I'm on here y'all help me y'all the ones pulling you can go all of these meetings and you can run and shout all day long but if the word don't come forth it ain't done yet come on Church I'm not against the moving of the Holy Spirit but it's in unison with the mechanics and the Dynamics God laid an order to the church service to have the minister to bring forth the word to encourage to uplift to give you power power to give you strength to give you overcoming power to give you my faith that at the end of the servant you could raise up and say that ain't nothing but the truth I believe it and allow God to manifest itself with the spirit of the dynamic with the Holy Spirit in our lives we got to go one way or the other come on we either got to be just an all Shelton Church or a cold dead Church thank God we're not this way are we come on church this is God trying to warn somebody because somebody's fighting it this morning come on Church this is God trying to warn you stay with the word of God come on if somebody wants to worship and praise God let Him worship and praise God we was taught as a child when somebody started speaking in tongues you closed your eyes come on you don't look around and see what's happening you close your eyes and you maybe God might move upon you you know you know why it don't happen no more because when one person speaks in tongues the whole churches want to know what they're going to do come on amen I'll move on but oh I'm so glad brother Brandon says I'm so glad that there's ten thousand octane power the word of God in the Holy Ghost to light it up to resurrect the power of God in a man's life or a woman's or into a church they shove that Cadillac down the road younger and the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost which came back and was weighed over the people of this day of Pentecost making him the same yesterday today and forever that was the first sheep come up from all of the prophets which was the son of God it was the power of God when the outpouring happened on the day of Pentecost and they all began to speak in underturned that was the power of the Sun and in our day when you stand up against the walls of the enemy that is the power of the Sun when you go into your job place and they start speaking the evil of your lord and you won't have nothing to do with it that's the power of the sun when your life becomes a reflection of Christ whatever you know what they do around my word please when they start getting ready to tell a dirty joke they're asking me to leave I didn't tell him to ask me to leave but they see something represented inside of my life and it ain't just me it's you too they see something a power represented in your life that he don't want to hear that kind of nonsense then he don't want to hear that kind of talk we're going to ask him to leave thank God they respect that because I don't want to hear it come on Church but what is that that's the world seeing the power of the Sun in your life you walk up and it gets quiet well we don't have to put two and two together to figure out they wasn't talking about something about but you know what them same people do sick they want to get you off to the side come on because they see a representation of the Son of God in your life and they know that they know enough about scripture to know that when Jesus says Rise and be healed they Rose and be healed and they know that if you'll say that it'll happen to them talk about everything in the world him and his wife got into a fight they've been married 30 years he was afraid she was going to leave him he'd come in Jonathan I need to talk to you I said what's up okay sure let's go out of here this is what happened this is what happened this is what happened what do you think I should do I think you should go apologize huh yeah I think you should go apologize come on if you do something wrong you should apologize well well but but nothing if you want to save your marriage go apologize go tell her how you really feel about her come on Church go tell her how you really love her go tell her how you couldn't live without her go tell her how she she represents everything that you are go tell her that you did not mean to do that that some selfish idiotic desire come up on your mind and you did that but that ain't the real you two and a half weeks later he apologized two weeks later comes to business I don't think my marriage has ever been better come on Church come on Church if you're doing something wrong make it right if you said something to yourselves whether men may make it right I'm preaching on myself now baby I'm sorry whatever I did Lord help me that was the first Chief to come over all the prophets which was the Son of God the king of the prophets there's been churches churches Brides brides churches Brides brides but there has to come one he said Hallelujah he said there has to come a real Pride come on there's many mockeries and imputations that wanted to be the bride come on we can go to scripture we ain't got all day we're running out of time you can go to the 10 foolish versions there's ten of them there but there was only five that was Pride there was only five that was anointed there was only five that had the Holy Ghost with them there was only five that had the oil and the vessels it was prepared to go home with the crew the other five was intimidation on any intimidation but they was trying to be the likeness of the Bride they was trying to be the image of the Bride they dressed like the bride they acted like the bro they spoke like the bride but they didn't have the all come on Church brother said that all was the Holy Ghost they didn't have the Holy Ghost what did they not help they didn't have the power of the sun living in Elijah what did they do they went to slaves and the groom come and they got left because they didn't have power but brother Brennan says there has to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics they got church order see just because you want to be all demanding don't mean to get away with church order come on Church he said oh we just let the Holy Ghost free in our life and you know what every time the preacher starts preaching somebody gets up and gives interpretation that's our church order that's not the Holy Spirit come on there's Church order in church when the words coming forth that's the most important thing that's why God intended it to be for the word to come forth to encourage to teach you up to give you something that you have need of you've got a word of Prophecy there's a place for that too it's not doing away with it he is putting it together in a perfect piece of cake the exact way that God wanted it he said but it's got to be a real bride there's must be one to come that's not only got the mechanics the church order but the Dynamics the Holy Spirit of it and it makes that church live come on Church come on you can't live under the mechanics only you can't live in a church order only and you're afraid to move everybody comes in like Sears and Roebuck they'll present it out here and gave you all the perfect suit and everybody comes in and I can't live on because I might wrinkle my shoulder and come on but it's in a perfect order of the mechanics and the Dynamics together it makes the church live it moves in the power of his resurrection until we come to that place until we find that place that what good does it do to polish the hubs what good does it do to give her a facelift or symbolize job when there's no Dynamics in it come on church I can have the most beautiful Mustang the world has ever seen but if I don't put a battery in gasoline in it don't mean nothing come on I can have a church that's perfect in church order and I can spit sign and polish the windows and I can vacuum the Pierce and I can part everybody's hair just right I can have two deacons stand at the back of each door and make sure everybody sits in the exact location to where we have assigned seats and we can have a church book in the back but you have to have your name in the book to be a part of the church come on Church but unless you let God move it's a dead Church it is nothing but a lodge and that's not denominations that's message if you don't let God move in your lives it's a dead Church he said no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right and five foolish they had the mechanics they knew how to live they knew how to talk they knew that the groom was coming they knew the end time signs that it was time for the groom to come they knew where to gather come on Church they was gathered with the wise versions they knew which church to go to come on Church they knew where the word of the Lord for their day was they knew who the prophet was they believed what the prophet said because they went and got a vessel just didn't have no oil in it and they showed up to church they knew the rapture was about to take place but they didn't have the power go on Church doesn't matter how much the mechanics proved to be right there's got to be Dynamics to make it work amen I'm going to skip some now I'm on close we can go down through every age but you know what it's our human instinct to look at the Mark and the mirror around us I found a picture one time and and I used it and I don't have the picture here you can Google it you can find it if you want to see it but the first picture is a picture of the sun setting in the sky and the second picture is the same picture but you can't see the sun all you can see is a man's thumb that's blocking the Sun and the question of the picture read which is bigger the thumb or the Sun come on Church obviously the sun's bigger he said but the problem is you're closer to the thumb than you are to the Sun and it makes the thumb look bigger come on Church that's what we do with our problems we're closer to our problems than we are to the power of the Sun or closer to our situation and some of us likes it too much come on Church come on some of us likes it too much and all we can see is all of the problems that we're facing come on Church but you know what you could take that same picture and all you have to do is take one step to the side and then it becomes obvious Sun blinds out the thumb the brightness of the sun you can't even see the man's thumb anymore church that's what I'm telling you this morning you got problems in your life you've got situations in your life you got milk and mud around and everybody wants to throw everything in the world pile it up but all I'm asking you this morning is take a step to the side get out of the mark get out of the mower get out of the critical Spirits get out of the bad attitudes get out of the how are better than me than you get it in the line with the Son of God get in line with the power of the Sun and you know what it'll take your eyes it's like welding how many of you has ever will put it before yeah you get your eyes burnt but that welder you're the only thing that'll help it look at it again but you know what happens it draws your eyes to it and you can't look away what do they say about a drunk driver the worst thing in the world to do to a drunk driver is less your bright lights at them because their attention goes to the bright light and they'll draw whatever in front of you come on children of God all we got to do is get a glimpse all we got to do is move just a little bit and get a glimpse of the power of God get a glimpse of the Sun get a glimpse of the power of the suit not God and to draw our attention straight to the word of God it'll draw our attention straight to the Son of God and we'll forget about the monk we'll forget about the trials we'll realize that's what Paul realized when he says I consider this as nothing compared to what is promised to me coming on a rapture this morning I'm telling you I'm coming to a close this morning I'm telling you the power of the Sun is laying in you look you've heard it you've heard it said but let it become real this morning let it become so real in you this morning that by time Wednesday night comes around people in this church is talking about you because something changed in your life come on Church you know when I give my life to God everybody talked about me I was a heathen they thought I really wasn't I was the son of God but I was worshiping the wrong God I was worshiping the devil I'll run up and down the road with my Confederate flag in my rock and roll music come on I was a redneck out of you know but you know what when God got a hold of me things Begin to Fall Away rock and roll didn't mean so much no more come on Tobacco didn't mean so much no more alcohol didn't mean so much no more music didn't mean so much no more next thing you know they found me with the Bible in my hand you know when I was a teenager I didn't live for God and I'm sorry and I hate that and I asked God to forgive me every day for that but I never carried a Bible to church I don't ever go to church without a Bible now I mean thank God we got it on our tablets and our phones there ain't nothing like holding a book there ain't nothing like representing to the world I'm going to church this morning I'm not like the rest of the world carrying a foam in the church I've got the book I've got the word they don't have to worry because the book's laying on myself on my Dash when I get out they don't think I'm going to a a celebrity meeting or or a country club meeting they look real soon they can tell that boy was going to church there's a light as a representation to the world that the power of the sun is living in me and we're coming to that musicians come this morning we're coming to that place but I'm in the message why I talked about Moses we talked earlier and I know my redeemer liveth 1958 he's talking about Daniel I wanted to share this with you he said in Daniel not knowing how God was going to do it how many has ever been in a trial and you didn't know how God was going to bring you out of it see they told Daniel that if he kept they was going to put him in the lines then he knew what was coming come on he knew if he kept praying he was going to that Lion's Den he didn't know how he was going to get out of it but he knew he wasn't going to let the enemy Temple the power of the Sun Daniel not knowing how God was going to do and not knowing whether God was going to do it not knowing but knowing that he was able to do it knowing that something down in him told him so see God had a purpose he had everything working and after all and today no matter how indifferent we may seem at times how strange thing his goals of how the church gets in a condition in that condition it's all Divine Purpose of God to modus creator and the Lions could not eat that Prophet because God sent an angel and he had an angel standing prison take this Prophet because God had a purpose and he wanted to show that his self-styled King his mighty hand s for purpose he
