[0:00] you want to open a service prayer
[0:43] i will read a romans 8.
[1:04] we read 1 through 10 and we'll read 13
[1:07] together
[1:08] therefore is therefore now no
[1:10] condemnation to them which are in christ
[1:12] jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:14] after the spirit
[1:23] for what the law could not do and that
[1:25] it was weak through the flesh god
[1:28] sending his own son in the likeness of
[1:30] sinful flesh and for the sin condemned
[1:33] sin in the flesh
[1:43] for they that are after the flesh do
[1:45] mind the things of the flesh but they
[1:47] that are after the spirit the things of
[1:49] the spirit
[1:57] because the carnal mind is imma enmity
[2:00] against god for it is not subject to the
[2:02] law of god neither indeed can be
[2:10] but you are not in the flesh but in the
[2:12] spirit if so be that the spirit of god
[2:14] dwell in you now if any man have not the
[2:17] spirit christ he is none of his
[2:27] i'll read 13 together
[2:29] for if you live after the flesh ye shall
[2:32] die but if he through the spirit do
[2:35] mortify the deeds of the body you shall
[2:37] live
[2:56] i hope you're all having a good week you
[2:57] know you read that whole chapter eighth
[3:00] chapter of romans
[3:02] why do you have to have any anxiety this
[3:04] morning or be
[3:06] be
[3:07] fearful in anything that you do in your
[3:09] life if you read a chapter like that you
[3:11] know that god is more than able to meet
[3:12] all your needs provide for you do what
[3:15] he needs for you
[3:17] and all these simple ask us in return is
[3:20] to believe them love them and trust them
[3:22] i mean that's a pretty good deal if you
[3:24] ask me it's just pretty simple you know
[3:26] it's simple things
[3:28] if you would uh turn with meat
[3:32] i don't know if i've ever done anything
[3:34] out of this zephaniah the third chapter
[3:38] you know god is in the little things
[3:40] this morning brothers and sisters he
[3:41] cares about every individual here this
[3:44] morning young or old big or small he
[3:46] doesn't care who you are you know he
[3:48] cares about the little things you do in
[3:50] life and the big things he's there with
[3:52] you
[3:53] you know sometimes it's hard for us to
[3:55] trust him fully trust him just to you
[3:58] know just to yield to what he wants us
[4:00] in our to do
[4:02] i was reading this chapter this morning
[4:04] and i was just thinking
[4:08] it kind of you know it speaks to the
[4:09] jewish nation i know i say this a lot
[4:12] but you know we're no different you know
[4:15] brother branham taught about the 13th
[4:17] chapter of revelations about
[4:20] the you know the power of the beast and
[4:22] everything in that chapter well our
[4:24] country's in the same place that the
[4:26] israeli nation was when before
[4:28] nebuchadnezzar came and overwhelmed them
[4:31] you know and you can see it in our lives
[4:34] in this country that we live in you know
[4:36] we all love our country but you can see
[4:38] what's happening
[4:39] week after week year after year decade
[4:42] after decade in 100 in a century we've
[4:46] gone
[4:46] to a pretty low place but let me uh read
[4:49] this
[4:51] but i was kind of thinking of where
[4:52] we're at both spiritually and i was
[4:55] reading a little bit out of brother
[4:56] green's book this morning too
[4:58] and he was in the middle of the book he
[5:00] was talking about
[5:02] before he passed away about all the
[5:04] churches out there in the country and in
[5:06] the world you know they they keep
[5:09] getting bigger you know people don't
[5:11] come to those churches anymore
[5:14] for the word of god they
[5:16] they come to be entertained and i and we
[5:18] don't want to come to church to be
[5:20] entertained we want to come to serve the
[5:22] lord and listen from the lord there's a
[5:24] big difference between the two but let
[5:26] me read
[5:28] this chapter here
[5:31] uh
[5:32] it's not a very long chapter
[5:34] and it says woe to her that is filthy
[5:37] and polluted and to the oppressing city
[5:39] and of course this is talking about
[5:40] jerusalem but you can just think of our
[5:43] nation or our world today and just apply
[5:46] those scriptures for today and we're no
[5:49] better than these people were back then
[5:51] you know we're no you know
[5:53] small or great literal doesn't make a
[5:55] difference but all in the eyes of god
[5:57] are equal and the same and she obeyed
[6:00] not the voice she received not the
[6:02] correction she trusted not in the lord
[6:05] she drew not near to her god you know
[6:07] and
[6:08] that goes it doesn't make a difference
[6:10] whether it's our country all the way
[6:12] down to a school board you know they
[6:15] that scripture applies to them too
[6:18] her pretenses within her are roaring
[6:20] lions our judges are even wolves they
[6:23] not not the bone until the marrow
[6:25] and when when you're dealing with a
[6:27] church or with a country or society
[6:30] when you don't have confidence in your
[6:32] leaders and confidence in your judges it
[6:35] puts people in a really bad place
[6:37] and he goes on to say her prophets
[6:40] are light and treacherous persons or
[6:42] priests have polluted the sanctuary they
[6:44] have done violence to the law
[6:47] the the just lord is in the midst
[6:49] thereof he will not do iniquity every
[6:52] morning do i think bring his judgment to
[6:54] life
[6:55] he faileth not they have no shame they
[6:57] continually to get worse they do things
[6:59] to other people do things to themselves
[7:02] and they don't have any conscience about
[7:03] it
[7:05] i have cut off the nations their towers
[7:07] are desolate i've made their streets
[7:09] waste none passes by their cities are
[7:12] destroyed
[7:13] so that there is
[7:15] no man and there is no inhabitation and
[7:18] you know you can apply that scripture
[7:19] even today you know the babylonian
[7:22] kingdom of nebuchadnezzar
[7:24] you can't even find it anymore you got
[7:26] to dig up hundreds and hundreds of feet
[7:27] of earth to find where it was one day
[7:30] and it's no different for us you know
[7:32] and it goes on to say
[7:33] i said surely that will fear me that
[7:36] will receive instruction so their
[7:38] dwellings should not be cut off
[7:40] and how so ever i punished them but they
[7:43] rose early and corrupted all they're
[7:45] just thinking
[7:47] they just can't help themselves they
[7:49] continually you know god gave us a
[7:51] warning he gives everybody a warning you
[7:53] know brother branham taught that that
[7:55] god always gives people a warning before
[7:58] judgment comes and that's where we're at
[8:00] everyone's got their warning and then
[8:02] the only thing to follow for us is
[8:04] judgment
[8:05] and he goes i punish them they rose
[8:07] early and corrupted all their doings
[8:09] therefore awake ye upon me saith the
[8:11] lord until the day that i rise up to
[8:13] pray from us to gather the nations that
[8:16] i might assemble the kingdoms to pour
[8:18] upon them my indignation even my fierce
[8:21] anger for all the earth shall be
[8:23] devoured with the fire of my jealousy
[8:25] and we don't want to be here that day we
[8:28] i hope no one wants to be here that day
[8:30] for then i will turn to the people of
[8:33] for them will i turn to the people a
[8:35] pure language that they may call upon
[8:37] the name of the lord and serve him with
[8:40] one consent
[8:41] from beyond the river
[8:43] ethiopia of my supplements even the
[8:46] daughters of my deserts
[8:48] shall bring my mine offering and in that
[8:51] day thou shalt not be ashamed for all
[8:53] thy dealings wherein thou has turned
[8:55] guests against me
[8:56] for i will take away out of the midst of
[8:58] thee them that rejoice in thy pride and
[9:01] shall and thou shalt no more be haughty
[9:04] because of my holy mountain
[9:06] i will i will also leave in the midst of
[9:08] thee
[9:10] i will also have
[9:12] it in poor people that they shall trust
[9:14] in the name of the lord and
[9:16] just read a few more of these scriptures
[9:18] here the remember of israel shall do
[9:21] iniquity a remnant of israel shall not
[9:23] do a nickname or speak lies neither
[9:26] shall a deceitful tongue be found in
[9:28] their mouth for they they shall feed and
[9:30] lie down and not shall make them afraid
[9:33] and he goes on to sing here single
[9:35] daughter of zion o israel be glad and
[9:37] rejoice with all thy heart o daughter
[9:39] resolution for the lord have taken away
[9:42] the
[9:42] thy judgments he hath cast out thine
[9:44] enemies from the king of israel even the
[9:46] lord is in the midst of thee
[9:48] and shall not and shall not see evil
[9:51] anymore now this chapter kind of speaks
[9:53] in if you turn with me to john the
[9:56] gospel of john the eighth chapter
[10:07] i don't know if it's me but it's pretty
[10:09] warm up here today
[10:17] i know i get in a hurry and sometimes i
[10:18] start reading you guys haven't even had
[10:20] a chance to
[10:21] catch up with me
[10:23] um starting at about the 34th verse
[10:27] of john the eighth chapter this is where
[10:29] john is talking to the rubric i mean
[10:31] jesus is talking to the religious
[10:33] leaders in his day
[10:37] and this is and i'll read the thirty
[10:39] verse it says answers he will be
[10:41] abraham's seed we're never in bondage to
[10:43] any man how thou says we shall be made
[10:46] free you know that's a pretty bold
[10:47] statement for them to say you know they
[10:49] went into captivity they came out of
[10:51] captivity
[10:53] the they've been waiting on the messiah
[10:55] for 400 years and the romans are all
[10:58] around them and they say that's pretty
[11:00] bold statement and jesus answered them
[11:02] verily verily i say unto you whosoever
[11:04] commits sin
[11:06] is the servant of sin and paul was
[11:08] talking about that in romans 8. you know
[11:10] what whoever you're servant of this
[11:13] morning i i can only speak for my own
[11:15] heart and what i do every day whatever
[11:18] you find yourself serving every day
[11:20] that's who you really are and you and
[11:22] only person that knows that is yourself
[11:25] your family maybe your father mother
[11:27] your brother your sister or the man that
[11:29] works with you you know
[11:31] that's whoever committeth sin is the
[11:33] servant of sin and servant abideth not
[11:35] in the house forever but the son abideth
[11:37] forever if the son therefore shall make
[11:40] you free ye shall be free indeed
[11:43] i know that you are abraham's seed but
[11:45] you seek to kill me because my word hath
[11:47] no place in you and that's the same
[11:49] place we're at today you know i i
[11:51] noticed that in the world
[11:53] that if you don't agree with them
[11:54] anymore they've gone past just laughing
[11:57] at you anymore or disregarding you
[11:59] anymore they're past that they're moving
[12:01] into another stage where if you don't
[12:03] agree with them and do what they ask you
[12:05] to do they're willing to fight you and
[12:07] kill you we're moving to that point now
[12:09] on the face of the earth it's we're not
[12:12] quite there yet but it's getting to a
[12:13] point if you don't do what they want you
[12:15] to do
[12:16] they just don't disregard you anymore
[12:18] they're getting to be violent about
[12:19] making you do the things that they want
[12:21] you to do
[12:23] and if the son therefore shall make you
[12:24] free you shall be free indeed
[12:26] i know that you are abraham's eat but
[12:28] you seek to kill me because my words
[12:30] have no place in you
[12:34] they answered and said on them abraham
[12:36] is our father and jesus said unto them
[12:39] if you were abraham's children you would
[12:40] do the work of abraham
[12:42] but now you seek to kill me a man that
[12:44] hath told you the truth which i have
[12:46] heard of god
[12:48] this did not abraham you do the deeds of
[12:50] your father i'm not going to read that
[12:52] whole chapter this morning but i was
[12:54] just thinking this morning
[12:56] you know though
[12:58] i'm not going to say i probably will
[13:00] anyway but
[13:01] you know
[13:02] you know brother brandon paul that
[13:04] message the countdown and he said we and
[13:06] i think brother thomas talked about it
[13:08] the other day you we went from the wheel
[13:11] age
[13:12] all the way up to the rocket age today
[13:14] and the thing about a rocket it just
[13:16] keeps accelerating once you're out in a
[13:18] vacuum you can just keep accelerating
[13:20] and accelerate you don't have anything
[13:22] to keep you from going faster
[13:24] and that's where we're at this morning
[13:26] as you
[13:28] look at the things around you in the
[13:29] world
[13:30] it's not getting better it's getting
[13:32] worse and the speed that is getting
[13:34] worse is getting faster so it should
[13:36] make us as believers in our hearts want
[13:38] to get as they get further away it
[13:41] should make us want to get closer each
[13:43] day should be the opposite for the
[13:45] christian as the world keeps
[13:46] accelerating to its destiny to its final
[13:50] place that it's going it should make the
[13:51] christian this morning want to get
[13:53] closer should be the opposite reaction
[13:55] in us we should be wanting to go closer
[13:58] to the lord as they get further apart
[14:00] that's what it should be driving us
[14:02] to do this morning so like i said you
[14:05] know everyone you know i got to raise my
[14:07] hand up you know as i get older i find
[14:09] myself being frustrated more i guess
[14:11] that's part of being old you know things
[14:14] i used to do on the job that i could you
[14:16] know i could work 12 hours
[14:18] i would never say a thing and i just
[14:20] keep working for 12 hours it wouldn't
[14:22] think twice it'd be eight or nine
[14:24] o'clock at night and i wouldn't think
[14:25] anything about it as i get older that's
[14:27] not important to me anymore i get more
[14:29] frustrated the longer i'm working and it
[14:32] shouldn't be that way for a person
[14:34] anything you do with your relationship
[14:36] should it should be a newer experience
[14:39] each day you should desire more of that
[14:41] relationship as you get a little older
[14:44] younger don't make a difference you
[14:46] desire to be with the lord more each day
[14:49] brother david
[15:06] man let's stand and sing that chorus

[15:10] morning

[48:32] christ's name
[48:33] amen and amen
[48:36] praise the lord
[48:38] well this is kind of a different subject
[48:40] i guess i don't know that i've just went
[48:41] this way probably half and time or two
[48:44] when you preach for 30 years i'll tell
[48:45] you what there's hardly anything you
[48:47] haven't covered at least 10 times so
[48:49] amen
[48:51] but i just love the way that the lord
[48:53] will
[48:54] just give you a
[48:56] it's it's the same thought but a little
[48:58] bit different amen
[49:00] and it just gets yeah you don't put a
[49:02] period behind what you believe how many
[49:04] knows we don't put a period behind what
[49:05] you believe
[49:06] that's what denominations do and that's
[49:08] why they die because they've just
[49:10] believed so much and that's it god
[49:12] continuously
[49:14] reveals more so i want to read the
[49:16] scriptures and then i'll kind of testify
[49:18] of how uh the lord brought this about
[49:21] and what the theme of our message will
[49:24] be this morning and uh what it is to
[49:27] accomplish amen so if you will turn your
[49:31] bibles to
[49:32] let's go to second chronicles
[49:46] some of these words i probably won't be
[49:48] able to pronounce just quite right but
[49:51] y'all just bear with me
[49:54] amen this is in the book of chronicles
[49:58] and chapter 15
[50:00] unless i believe where we want to be
[50:08] and we're going to jump around just a
[50:09] little bit
[50:12] we want to read the first two
[50:14] or actually we want to read
[50:16] from one through
[50:18] eight and then go 10 through 15.
[50:22] and the spirit of god came upon azariah
[50:25] the son of obed
[50:27] and he went out to meet asa
[50:30] and said unto him
[50:32] hear ye me now remember this is a
[50:35] prophet going to meet a king
[50:37] and and talking to him hear ye me asa
[50:40] and all judah and benjamin
[50:43] the lord is with you
[50:45] while ye be with him
[50:48] and if ye seek him he will be found of
[50:51] you
[50:52] but if ye forsake him he will forsake
[50:55] you
[50:56] for now for a long season israel have
[51:00] been without the true god
[51:02] and without a teaching priest and
[51:04] without a law without law
[51:06] but when they in their trouble did turn
[51:09] unto the lord god of israel and sought
[51:11] him
[51:12] he was found of them
[51:14] and in those days there was no peace to
[51:17] him that went out nor him that came in
[51:20] but great vexation were upon all the
[51:23] inhabitants of the country
[51:24] and nation was destroyed of nation and
[51:27] city of city for god did vex them with
[51:30] all adversity
[51:32] be strong therefore and let not your
[51:34] hands be weak for your work shall be
[51:37] rewarded
[51:39] down in verse
[51:40] 10 so they gathered themselves together
[51:42] at jerusalem in the third month in the
[51:45] 15th year
[51:46] of the reign of asa and they offered
[51:49] unto god the same time of the spoil
[51:51] which they had brought 700
[51:54] oxen and 7 000 sheep
[51:57] and they entered into a covenant to seek
[52:00] the lord god of their fathers with all
[52:02] their heart and with all their soul
[52:05] that whosoever would not seek the lord
[52:07] god of israel should be put to death
[52:09] whether he's small or great whether man
[52:11] or woman and they swear unto the lord
[52:13] with a loud voice and with shouting and
[52:16] with trumpets and with cornets
[52:19] and all judah rejoiced in the oath for
[52:23] they had sworn with all their heart
[52:26] and saw him
[52:28] with the whole their whole
[52:31] desire
[52:32] and he was found of them
[52:34] and the lord gave them rest round about
[52:37] now go to
[52:39] hebrews if
[52:40] hebrews i believe it is
[52:45] [Music]
[52:52] hebrews the 11th chapter
[52:57] and we want to read two verses out of
[52:59] there
[53:03] 11 and verse
[53:05] 5
[53:06] by faith enoch
[53:08] was translated
[53:10] that he should not see death and was not
[53:13] found because god had translated him
[53:16] for before his translation he had this
[53:18] testimony that he pleased god
[53:21] but without it faith it is impossible to
[53:24] please him and he that cometh to god
[53:26] must believe that he is and that he is a
[53:29] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[53:31] him may god had his blessings to the
[53:34] reading of the word you can be seated
[53:35] this morning
[53:41] so

[53:55] you know i just didn't feel like uh you
[53:57] know sometimes i don't know about you
[53:58] but sometimes you just
[54:00] feel like the lord isn't there or you
[54:02] don't feeling like you should want to
[54:04] amen
[54:06] and so you're just kind of
[54:09] you know you just it's you know because
[54:13] you want the water how many knows the
[54:14] water needs to flow
[54:16] because jesus said the water that i will
[54:18] give him will be in him
[54:20] a well of water springing up into
[54:23] everlasting
[54:24] life and i believe every believer ought
[54:26] to have that water flowing amen we ought
[54:30] to have the spirit flowing through us
[54:32] amen god quickening things and making it
[54:35] real to me and i'm like you know i'm at
[54:37] a certain place you know here and in my
[54:40] walk with the lord and uh you know uh
[54:43] you you know a certain plateau so to
[54:45] speak and and i felt like it was just
[54:48] you you just want more
[54:51] amen how many with me there this morning
[54:53] you just really
[54:55] want more amen and i kind of asked
[54:58] myself lord why am i like why why am i
[55:01] like this why does it feel like this and
[55:03] what do i do
[55:04] uh you know to really get more of god
[55:07] you know so this morning's message
[55:08] you're going to be towered geared
[55:10] towards amen uh helping you getting from
[55:13] the place that you
[55:15] are
[55:16] and then dancing on to higher ground is
[55:19] that okay
[55:20] so i really like that song david saying
[55:22] higher ground we're gaining we want
[55:24] higher ground in that right and the
[55:26] other song is saying that i wanted to
[55:28] sing maybe at the end again but i
[55:30] thought about this because this is
[55:31] really goes along with it real well and
[55:34] that is
[55:35] uh i would not be denied amen
[55:38] and you know the thing that the felt
[55:40] like the lord told me you know the thing
[55:42] that i felt like he told me
[55:45] uh was that you know you know you just
[55:48] don't one of the first things that come
[55:51] i guess would be that you just don't get
[55:53] things from god if you aren't really
[55:56] serious about it
[55:59] you know if you're just going to lax the
[56:01] a daisy goal and if that's what your
[56:02] life is kind of like remember you're not
[56:05] going to get much from god
[56:07] because god don't care much for lacks a
[56:09] days ago
[56:10] he don't care for mediocre just kind of
[56:13] lukewarm so to speak right just that's
[56:16] what this age is this age is kind of
[56:18] lukewarm and sometimes i feel like that
[56:21] rubs off on us we get a little lukewarm
[56:23] with our relationship with god
[56:26] we get
[56:27] the word things become common to us god
[56:29] isn't this real to us what he is and
[56:32] well we just become dodie so to speak
[56:34] and it it's
[56:36] a terrible feeling right i i'm your
[56:38] human being right
[56:39] i believe as long as you're in this body
[56:42] you're going to need to trim your lamps
[56:44] once in a while
[56:46] how many blades we need lamp trimming
[56:48] amen and it begin to say that and then
[56:51] it says you know
[56:52] you need to and i remember what that
[56:54] what god told even uh you know whether
[56:57] it was joshua or even the prophet of god
[56:59] in this age you know he says you're
[57:01] gonna have to be
[57:02] more sincere
[57:06] now sincerity to me represents that
[57:09] something that you get perhaps a little
[57:12] more desperate about it right you want
[57:14] to get sincere hey you know i got to
[57:16] take this thing first i got to get down
[57:19] to business with this
[57:21] it's a talk of getting serious and god
[57:24] wants us to be serious and he wants us
[57:26] to be perseverant right
[57:28] amen and so i believe that and i begin
[57:31] to think about the scripture he says
[57:33] that they didn't come to god must
[57:35] believe that he is and that he will
[57:37] grant them their hearts desire on a
[57:40] recline or just relax and doting
[57:44] no he doesn't you're not going to find
[57:47] him that way he says and he is a
[57:48] rewarder of them that
[57:51] diligently
[57:53] right diligently seek him and so i said
[57:56] god i want to do that and then it comes
[57:58] to my mind and i want to read the
[58:00] scripture amen where to talk david talks
[58:02] about that he followed
[58:04] hard
[58:05] after god
[58:07] following heart after god
[58:11] amen and so notice he says diligently
[58:15] seek him amen so we want to talk a
[58:17] little while with the help of the lord
[58:18] about seeking
[58:20] god seeking more of god than what you
[58:24] have already
[58:25] [Music]
[58:27] praise god
[58:29] because i believe that every one of us i
[58:32] believe there is more of god to begin
[58:35] more of the holy ghost to be had
[58:38] come on folks we can't raise our hand we
[58:41] can't shout we can't say praise the lord
[58:43] we can't say amen a lot of times
[58:47] we don't have the joy folks we don't
[58:49] have a smile to offer anybody
[58:53] and you know what i've realized it also
[58:55] he kind of showed me you know that
[58:56] sometimes what you need to do if you
[58:59] want more of god is you've got to bring
[59:01] a sacrifice
[59:04] you gotta bring a sacrifice we bring
[59:06] your sacrifice of praise into the house
[59:08] of the lord amen but there's a lot of
[59:11] things a lot of times you're gonna have
[59:12] to sacrifice if you want something from
[59:14] god you have to bring god an offering
[59:19] an offering of sincerity an offering of
[59:22] digging deep and i
[59:24] even though i didn't felt like it i felt
[59:26] like i was just not where i want to be
[59:27] but i said god i am diligently seeking
[59:31] after you god i want more of you
[59:35] huh
[59:36] and you would be amazed brother brad
[59:38] just in that little prayer just that
[59:40] prayer that simple desire god began to
[59:43] pour himself out upon me
[59:45] and he's already given me two messages
[59:47] to me this morning's message and another
[59:50] one and he began to just let the water
[59:52] flow amen
[59:54] and the simplest little things amen amen
[59:57] i got a message lord willing that i want
[59:59] to preach on lettuce
[1:00:03] [Laughter]
[1:00:05] lettuce
[1:00:06] yeah that's right
[1:00:08] well not the fruit the vegetable i'm
[1:00:10] talking about let us
[1:00:12] let us not be wearing just a whole lot
[1:00:15] of things about what we ought to be
[1:00:17] doing and let's be up and doing
[1:00:19] amen don't be like dumb driven cattle
[1:00:22] be a hero in the strife
[1:00:24] how many believes he takes desperation
[1:00:27] if you want something for god you gotta
[1:00:29] be like oh buddy robinson that he was
[1:00:31] out there plowing his corner whatever
[1:00:33] and he wanted the holy ghost so bad he
[1:00:35] put the thing down he says god if you
[1:00:37] don't give me the baptism the holy ghost
[1:00:39] you're gonna find a pile about that's
[1:00:41] how serious god wants you to get god
[1:00:43] wants you tonight god wants a lot he
[1:00:45] loves people that are perseverant
[1:00:48] persistent
[1:00:51] people with zeal
[1:00:55] how many believes that
[1:00:59] i thought lord that's what i need
[1:01:01] i have become too slouchy i've become
[1:01:03] too lazy
[1:01:06] amen
[1:01:07] think about it
[1:01:08] you know and i thought about it and i
[1:01:10] thought you know i want more of god and

[1:01:24] i don't feel like i'm ready for sunday
[1:01:26] maybe i had to do a little sacrifice
[1:01:29] and sacrifice my heart for the lord
[1:01:32] folks let's admit it we're just not
[1:01:34] willing to sacrifice anything for more
[1:01:36] of god

[1:01:42] we don't sacrifice our wednesday night
[1:01:44] we got we're too busy working we're too
[1:01:47] busy for more of god that's why we don't
[1:01:49] get more of god

[1:02:25] for people oh i'll tell you what he got
[1:02:27] some noise in the old testament when the

[1:02:51] you've got to seek the lord with all
[1:02:52] your heart
[1:02:56] that's what we need
[1:02:58] we need our cave experiences we need our
[1:03:00] two days in our little old cave

[1:05:57] falling hard after him i'm coming ain't

[1:06:02] even after jesus said it's not meat to

[1:06:22] was and what he could do he was god

[1:06:27] that this woman says you know i would
[1:06:29] not be denied

[1:06:33] kingdom of god is preached and the

[1:07:31] flowing

[1:15:26] security guards out of here we're trying

[1:15:37] anyway
[1:15:40] oh my no notice so he was talking here
[1:15:43] he said he was sitting out there and you
[1:15:44] think about that there's no building
[1:15:46] hold them so they're out there in the
[1:15:48] wide open race tracks and big places and
[1:15:50] i've seen women sit out there with their
[1:15:52] hair just stringing down fine dressed
[1:15:54] people just set in the rain
[1:15:57] all day long
[1:16:01] oh hallelujah just sat there and it was
[1:16:03] just pouring and thundering and
[1:16:05] lightning and storms are blowing them
[1:16:07] just leaning back and forth against one
[1:16:09] another like that sitting there wait
[1:16:11] till you come to pray for them and you
[1:16:13] know god honors faith like that he does
[1:16:16] he says next statement you've got to do
[1:16:19] something for god to honor
[1:16:25] you've got to do something for god to
[1:16:27] honor let's all say it you've got to do
[1:16:30] something god to honor when you get on
[1:16:33] your knees and you begin to say god i
[1:16:36] don't feel like i have you like i should
[1:16:38] lord i need more of you i want to take
[1:16:40] you with my whole heart
[1:16:42] remember the first scripture we read
[1:16:45] that's what they were doing they were
[1:16:46] kind of saying look we're going to seek
[1:16:48] the lord with all our heart all of our
[1:16:50] stuff anybody don't gonna die
[1:16:53] [Laughter]
[1:16:55] that was pretty rough brother if you
[1:16:57] don't go to seeking the lord i better
[1:16:58] see you on your knees i better see you
[1:17:00] see you seeking the lord or you will die
[1:17:02] that's how serious we are about our
[1:17:04] seeking the lord
[1:17:07] that's pretty serious isn't it
[1:17:09] no wonder god heard him
[1:17:12] huh
[1:17:14] but if you'll notice in that scripture
[1:17:15] it says that they were seeking him with
[1:17:18] their
[1:17:19] whole
[1:17:20] desire
[1:17:22] even the first commandment he said shall
[1:17:23] love the lord thy god with all thy heart
[1:17:25] all my mind all thy soul and all my
[1:17:27] strength you're supposed to love him
[1:17:29] with everything you got
[1:17:35] how many is guilty see i'm not where i
[1:17:37] ought to be
[1:17:38] i'm not where i ought to be
[1:17:41] they're still desires huh
[1:17:43] there's still doors down there
[1:17:45] there's still places in my life
[1:17:47] that i know i need to surrender more to
[1:17:49] god
[1:17:51] see jesus wants to come into your house
[1:17:53] and he don't want to just come in the
[1:17:54] front door he wants to get into your
[1:17:56] closet he must get into your private
[1:17:57] life he wants to get into your business
[1:17:59] he wants to get into every portion of
[1:18:01] you
[1:18:03] huh
[1:18:05] no matter what it is what do you do for
[1:18:06] pleasure
[1:18:08] is it sinful or is it holy he cares
[1:18:11] about that
[1:18:13] what do you do to pass your time
[1:18:16] what do you do when you're all by
[1:18:17] yourself
[1:18:19] come on folks
[1:18:21] oh
[1:18:22] that's where he wants to go
[1:18:24] and what is it you got to be open and
[1:18:26] say god here i am
[1:18:28] you want to seek him with your whole
[1:18:29] heart
[1:18:32] your whole mind your whole strength
[1:18:35] everything everything about you
[1:18:38] that's what it takes if you want more
[1:18:39] god this morning
[1:18:41] you're going to have to have a
[1:18:42] conference with god
[1:18:44] you have to have a talk with him
[1:18:46] how many believes a lot of us we need to
[1:18:47] talk with him
[1:18:49] say god this area of my life huh that
[1:18:51] area of my life it ain't surrendered
[1:18:53] like it ought to be
[1:18:54] it didn't feel like it ought to be
[1:18:57] other things take
[1:18:59] precedence over the lord and the word of
[1:19:01] god
[1:19:03] huh
[1:19:05] lord help us
[1:19:07] lord help me
[1:19:08] every one of us
[1:19:13] you've got to do something for god to
[1:19:14] honor you see
[1:19:16] to show him
[1:19:18] the people's got everything handed down
[1:19:20] to them so easy
[1:19:22] he said listen you don't appreciate it
[1:19:24] when it's given to you so easy
[1:19:28] isn't that right
[1:19:29] if you got to struggle a little bit if
[1:19:31] you're going to see god i don't know why
[1:19:32] he got the holy ghost god i don't know
[1:19:34] why this is but you're struggling but i
[1:19:36] got to get over it
[1:19:38] when you finally do you never want to go
[1:19:40] back there again
[1:19:42] huh
[1:19:43] praise be to god
[1:19:46] he says when you have to work for a
[1:19:48] little bit you'll appreciate you'll
[1:19:49] value it a little bit more amen
[1:19:53] praise be to god
[1:19:55] hallelujah listen he was preaching on
[1:19:57] desperations he's usually takes a state
[1:19:59] of emergency to throw us into
[1:20:01] desperation
[1:20:03] and it's too bad he says that he does
[1:20:05] that way but us human beings are so
[1:20:07] thoughtfully in our mind that's why we
[1:20:10] get away from god it's because we get
[1:20:12] slopeful
[1:20:13] where nature to gets lawful
[1:20:16] to get lukewarm to get relaxed
[1:20:23] i've been a christian for 30 years now
[1:20:26] i am like i am come on folks
[1:20:29] i want to change i on higher ground
[1:20:33] i want to go to heaven don't you
[1:20:35] i want to meet jesus
[1:20:37] i want to be in his very image i wanted
[1:20:40] to work on me
[1:20:43] be careful he will
[1:20:44] he will flat work on you if you give him
[1:20:46] permission
[1:20:49] will it be pleasant
[1:20:51] no it won't be pleasant because when he
[1:20:53] works on you he gets rid of the old
[1:20:55] flesh he gets rid of that side that
[1:20:57] don't want to be a living sacrifice like
[1:20:59] paul said that you present your bodies a
[1:21:02] living sacrifice unto god holy and
[1:21:04] acceptable unto god which is your
[1:21:06] reasonable service
[1:21:08] your whole body is a sacrifice to god
[1:21:11] you sacrifice your will you sacrifice
[1:21:14] your own ideas
[1:21:16] your ways your thoughts
[1:21:18] your desires your plans your wishes
[1:21:21] sacrifice at all say god what do you
[1:21:23] want to what is your plan for me
[1:21:27] ah
[1:21:29] no
[1:21:30] i wonder this morning out here and out
[1:21:33] there in the streaming world i wonder
[1:21:34] how many of us say you know
[1:21:37] i have not done that with the whole
[1:21:38] heart like i should
[1:21:41] huh
[1:21:43] i haven't done it with the whole heart
[1:21:46] sure we do to a certain extent
[1:21:48] but you got to do it with the whole
[1:21:50] heart
[1:21:51] your whole mind the whole soul
[1:21:53] and all of your strength
[1:21:56] it all has to be surrendered to god
[1:21:59] then
[1:22:00] thou shalt have good success
[1:22:04] amen
[1:22:07] all right
[1:22:19] over in
[1:22:22] psalms
[1:22:23] 63 we'll go to psalms look at david a
[1:22:26] little bit how he felt about god
[1:22:28] who goes 63 and 20 and 41 i believe it
[1:22:31] is
[1:22:34] psalm 63
[1:22:36] david begins to say oh god
[1:22:39] thou art and my god
[1:22:42] amen
[1:22:43] i guess david then got a revelation of
[1:22:45] all the things that you can make of god
[1:22:47] right
[1:22:49] but he says there ain't nothing else my
[1:22:50] god god you are my god
[1:22:53] and a car ain't pleasure ain't no riches
[1:22:56] ain't nothing else that i worship and
[1:22:58] praise more than i do god
[1:23:01] you are my god
[1:23:02] early
[1:23:03] will i seek thee
[1:23:06] my soul
[1:23:08] thirsts for thee
[1:23:12] folks i'm telling you right now if you
[1:23:14] don't have a real thirst for more of god
[1:23:16] you pray god give it to you
[1:23:18] because i'm telling you right now you're
[1:23:20] in pitiful shape if your search your
[1:23:22] soul don't thirst anymore it should
[1:23:24] thirst for more of god
[1:23:28] don't give me half a t-bone don't get me
[1:23:30] off of that little rib eye just a little
[1:23:32] piece i want the whole thing
[1:23:34] if you have a second servant let me have
[1:23:36] a second serving huh
[1:23:39] not just a portion not just a
[1:23:41] little but that was the whole thing i
[1:23:43] would all love god don't you
[1:23:45] i want more of god my soul first for
[1:23:48] thee my flesh longest for thee
[1:23:51] in a dry and thirsty land
[1:23:54] i look at the world they're thirsting to
[1:23:57] death
[1:23:57] [Music]
[1:24:00] they're dying of thirst
[1:24:02] how many knows we're living in a drought
[1:24:04] didn't brother babe says there would be
[1:24:05] a trout
[1:24:06] amen for the hearing of the true word of
[1:24:08] god
[1:24:10] amen if we're living in that ground
[1:24:13] go to this church go to that church find
[1:24:15] out if you really hear the real truth
[1:24:19] there's not very many out there that'll
[1:24:20] preach it
[1:24:21] the real truth
[1:24:25] not very many preachers that'll stand
[1:24:26] but not compromise
[1:24:30] for heavy tithe papers
[1:24:32] rich people or somebody in the church
[1:24:35] well now i better be careful definitely
[1:24:36] tell you something to say that i have to
[1:24:38] be careful while i say because of
[1:24:39] somebody y'all need a new pastor
[1:24:43] i would never have to well my
[1:24:46] folks if i sat in my office and thought
[1:24:47] about it sometimes i'd say well now you
[1:24:49] know that might affect that person
[1:24:51] but i don't i don't be mentioning you
[1:24:55] that i'm preaching it too
[1:24:57] now notice brother braham says if i'm
[1:24:59] preaching it personally at somebody i
[1:25:01] need another trip to the altar myself
[1:25:03] but if the holy ghost gives me something
[1:25:05] to preach and i don't care if somebody
[1:25:07] needs it don't need it or hit you right
[1:25:09] between the eyes you got to preach the
[1:25:11] word of god and you've got to say it
[1:25:13] otherwise i won't be able to go out
[1:25:15] those doors back there and say
[1:25:18] as i have thousands of times
[1:25:21] boy that was hard that was rough i
[1:25:23] didn't want to say it but i had to the
[1:25:26] holy ghost said you have to say it even
[1:25:28] like the prophet remember he said many
[1:25:29] times i've been circling
[1:25:31] i've i can put down sleep there ain't
[1:25:33] nobody's blood on my hands
[1:25:35] i've done my duty
[1:25:37] be a lot easier than to know that you've
[1:25:39] got people's souls that you have to
[1:25:41] enter over there
[1:25:46] amen
[1:25:48] you gotta better be called for it too
[1:25:52] amen
[1:25:53] all right well anyway let's go on shall
[1:25:55] we now notice drying where no water
[1:25:59] is
[1:26:02] when you get a passion like that when
[1:26:04] you get a thirst for seeking god like
[1:26:06] that how many believes you'll get
[1:26:07] somewhere
[1:26:09] you'll get somewhere like david did
[1:26:10] you'll know that he'll deliver you out
[1:26:12] of all your troubles

[1:26:18] god he's your god he's your deliverer he

[1:27:13] is his power

[1:27:22] in the sanctuary huh i mean it got
[1:27:25] smokey a lot of times in the sanctuary
[1:27:28] in the old testament a cloud would come
[1:27:30] down and just fog things up
[1:27:34] huh he was there because thy loving
[1:27:37] kindness
[1:27:38] is better
[1:27:40] than life
[1:27:43] huh
[1:27:44] living is pretty nice it's pretty nice
[1:27:46] be alive but let me tell you if you're
[1:27:48] living without christ you're empty on
[1:27:50] the inside you're miserable
[1:27:53] it's better just normal life
[1:27:56] it's better than life
[1:27:58] that loving kindness
[1:28:00] the sweetness of the holy spirit
[1:28:04] where you're driving on the road where
[1:28:06] you're going to work when you're coming
[1:28:08] home from work when you're working
[1:28:10] [Music]
[1:28:11] no matter we are just to have that
[1:28:13] sweetness of god in your heart there's
[1:28:16] nothing
[1:28:17] like it
[1:28:20] nothing
[1:28:23] it's better than life my lips shall
[1:28:26] praise thee thus will i bless thee while
[1:28:30] i live i will lift up my hands in thy
[1:28:34] name praise the lord
[1:28:37] my soul shall be satisfied with marrow
[1:28:40] and fatness
[1:28:43] amen
[1:28:46] amen over isaiah says come to me come
[1:28:48] eat drink let thy soul delight itself
[1:28:52] in fatness
[1:28:56] praise the lord and my mouth shall
[1:28:58] praise thee with joyful lips when i
[1:29:02] remember thee upon my
[1:29:04] bed
[1:29:06] amen and meditate on thee in the night
[1:29:10] watches
[1:29:11] but i had a couple good dreams the other
[1:29:13] night
[1:29:14] about preaching about
[1:29:16] the lord and just his presence and when
[1:29:18] i woke up i said thank you lord for that
[1:29:20] dream
[1:29:21] i like to dream about the god about god
[1:29:24] and the good things i don't like all the
[1:29:25] kind i like good dreams don't you
[1:29:28] now notice
[1:29:30] in the night watches verse 7 because
[1:29:32] thou has been my help therefore in the
[1:29:35] shadow of thy wings
[1:29:37] will i
[1:29:39] rejoice

[1:29:48] thy right hand
[1:29:51] uphold me
[1:29:54] amen

[1:30:10] we need to do more praying right
[1:30:12] seeking the lord's faith getting on our
[1:30:15] knees praying
[1:30:20] it would be great for us to take a day
[1:30:22] off
[1:30:23] just to go somewhere and pray
[1:30:27] meditate on the lord
[1:30:34] how many believes meditation is
[1:30:35] important for a believer
[1:30:43] blessed
[1:30:44] is the man that walketh not in the
[1:30:46] counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in
[1:30:49] the way of sinners nor sitteth in the
[1:30:51] seat of the scornful but his delight
[1:30:54] is in the law of the lord
[1:30:56] and in his law does he meditate
[1:30:59] wednesday and sunday
[1:31:03] once in a while
[1:31:05] no i think that was my problem
[1:31:08] you get your mind off some other things
[1:31:10] too long and you're like well
[1:31:12] you know i was thinking on such good
[1:31:14] things of the lord and i got distracted
[1:31:17] huh all these other things are really a
[1:31:18] distraction
[1:31:20] but he said day and night meditate and
[1:31:23] on his law does he meditate
[1:31:28] day and night another scripture says
[1:31:30] blessed is the man
[1:31:32] whose mind is
[1:31:34] stayed on thee
[1:31:38] boy we have got a vanity fair going on
[1:31:40] out there

[1:31:46] off of the lord
[1:31:48] and what do we got to do we got to
[1:31:49] sacrifice

[1:36:36] than for crying for it
[1:36:39] huh
[1:36:41] that's right
[1:36:43] you know you can't educate them to grunt

[1:37:31] huh remember brother brown says that's
[1:37:33] why you got these gangsters and
[1:37:34] everything else because you never got a
[1:37:36] mother's love

[1:37:38] on that shoulder and so forth and pat a
[1:37:40] little bit
[1:37:42] um
[1:37:46] yeah
[1:37:49] come on that's the way it is with us we
[1:37:51] just cry out to god amen and say god i
[1:37:54] need more of you pray no time oh lord

[1:38:14] kicks and screams till he gets that's
[1:38:16] the only way
[1:38:17] no better way that's made
[1:38:19] listen
[1:38:21] he says god's provided way it's the best
[1:38:24] way there's no better way for a baby to
[1:38:26] get what he wants
[1:38:27] mr dr bosworth used to say that the baby
[1:38:30] that cries the loudest
[1:38:33] gets the best service
[1:38:36] amen
[1:38:37] that's right get the best service
[1:38:39] because cry is the loudest amen
[1:38:42] that's about the way it is that goes for
[1:38:44] god's children i can parallel that for
[1:38:47] you amen get up there and say you know
[1:38:50] chewing chewing gum hello i mean his
[1:38:52] brother bam didn't have much people much
[1:38:54] use for people coming to the altar
[1:38:56] slapping each other on this old sword
[1:38:58] and
[1:39:00] tuna in a while chewing gum yeah we're
[1:39:02] going to the altar today
[1:39:04] get back over there you ain't going to
[1:39:05] get nothing from god chewing chewing gum
[1:39:07] not being no serious
[1:39:10] you ought to come crawling up
[1:39:13] yeah that'd be good i didn't i ain't
[1:39:16] even worthy to walk up crawl up
[1:39:19] because you ain't calling to me you're
[1:39:20] calling to him
[1:39:22] that's god
[1:39:25] i'll be a fool for you i don't do
[1:39:27] whatever i got to do
[1:39:29] amen but i want it
[1:39:31] amen
[1:39:33] cry out for it but it's got to be
[1:39:34] serious
[1:39:36] chewing sugar you know you come up there
[1:39:38] and you say father i'm here tonight if
[1:39:41] you want to give me the holy ghost all
[1:39:42] right i'm here
[1:39:45] if you want to heal me well just sitting
[1:39:47] here
[1:39:48] i'm just sitting here
[1:39:50] but if you don't well i guess that's all
[1:39:52] right i guess that will just be your
[1:39:54] will he son wrote the will out in the
[1:39:56] bible this is his will all right
[1:39:59] and if you want
[1:40:01] nevertheless if you don't well it's all
[1:40:04] right
[1:40:05] you will never get
[1:40:08] nowhere
[1:40:10] that's what he says
[1:40:11] how many believes that
[1:40:13] you don't get anywhere
[1:40:15] you have to diligently how many believe
[1:40:17] that you have to want it
[1:40:22] you've got that one with all your heart
[1:40:27] you've got to be desperate about it
[1:40:28] serious about it
[1:40:30] listen
[1:40:34] i would rather live desperately every
[1:40:37] day
[1:40:38] right sincerely say god i can't go to
[1:40:41] work today until i first pray and commit
[1:40:43] today to you and have a little talk with
[1:40:45] you amen come home in the evenings look
[1:40:47] i ain't gonna go through this day
[1:40:49] without listening to a tape
[1:40:51] reading my bible huh i mean if we need
[1:40:54] to do more of it
[1:40:55] and it takes perseverance how many got
[1:40:58] it yet
[1:40:59] a lot of us would probably say look i
[1:41:00] skipped way too much that means you're
[1:41:02] not persevering enough you're not
[1:41:04] desperate enough
[1:41:06] i want to be desperate sincere
[1:41:08] perseverance every day i don't want to
[1:41:11] have to god to put me on the back in the
[1:41:12] hospital
[1:41:17] serious do you want
[1:41:19] to have to do that to you
[1:41:21] but like brother bam says most of the
[1:41:23] times that's what it takes that's what
[1:41:24] god's got to do to get people's
[1:41:26] attention
[1:41:28] how many know the israelites they would
[1:41:30] all the time god would bless and god
[1:41:32] would forgive him god would hear them
[1:41:34] he'd take him back and then then they'd
[1:41:35] get laxatical again
[1:41:37] and go back out in the sin got to let
[1:41:40] them get chewed up by the enemy and tore
[1:41:42] up and they said oh man i didn't
[1:41:49] why because they didn't stay sincere
[1:41:53] they didn't stay in that desperation
[1:41:56] because how many knows if you don't stay
[1:41:58] desperate
[1:41:59] the devil will rob you
[1:42:02] he will rob your joy
[1:42:04] he will rob your peace
[1:42:07] he will rob you of the holy ghost
[1:42:09] if you don't stay desperate before the
[1:42:12] lord
[1:42:22] if my people which are called by my name
[1:42:25] shall humble themselves i thought you
[1:42:28] know that's a real good way to
[1:42:31] show god you're sincere in the old
[1:42:33] testament if you got sincere with god
[1:42:36] what would you do
[1:42:37] you'd go out there and you'd get some
[1:42:39] sackcloth
[1:42:41] i've never seen sackcloth but from the
[1:42:43] description of the word it's some cloth
[1:42:46] and clothes made out of bags
[1:42:48] some sacks maybe right sackcloth i don't
[1:42:51] know just what it is but it's got to be
[1:42:52] a humbling
[1:42:54] cloth
[1:42:56] and ashes
[1:42:58] huh
[1:43:00] humble yourself
[1:43:02] become humble realize you're nobody
[1:43:05] you're nothing god i am nothing i'm
[1:43:08] nobody
[1:43:09] humble yourself
[1:43:12] and
[1:43:13] pray
[1:43:14] seek the lord right
[1:43:17] and seek my face
[1:43:19] and turn
[1:43:20] from their wicked ways
[1:43:24] i can i stop there for just a few
[1:43:26] minutes we only got about 10 more
[1:43:27] minutes that all right
[1:43:29] let's look at those three things
[1:43:31] one of them is humble yourselves the
[1:43:33] next is pray the next is seek your face
[1:43:35] and the fourth is
[1:43:37] if there's anything you know you're
[1:43:38] doing wrong what do you got to do
[1:43:41] repent
[1:43:44] that's right
[1:43:46] turn
[1:43:47] from
[1:43:48] any
[1:43:50] ways oh well it's not evil well you just
[1:43:53] forget to pray
[1:43:55] you forget to read your bible
[1:43:57] all right that's not a good way
[1:44:00] huh
[1:44:01] anyway it takes you away from the lord
[1:44:03] then will i hear from heaven and will
[1:44:07] forgive their sins and i will
[1:44:11] heal
[1:44:12] whatever your problem is how many
[1:44:14] believes he'll do that
[1:44:16] he will heal
[1:44:18] your land
[1:44:20] amen
[1:44:23] praise the lord
[1:44:31] listen
[1:44:34] billy branham in closing here he says
[1:44:36] usually it takes a state of emergency to
[1:44:38] throw us into desperation
[1:44:39] and now i believe that we're living in
[1:44:41] the days
[1:44:42] the days that we're living in should
[1:44:44] cause this church to go into complete
[1:44:47] desperation
[1:44:52] i believe since the message this morning
[1:44:54] from god i believe that we ought to
[1:44:57] throw his entire congregation into
[1:44:59] desperation remember he was that morning
[1:45:01] he was preaching on the token
[1:45:03] you have to have
[1:45:05] the token
[1:45:06] if you expect to go
[1:45:08] in the rapture
[1:45:10] and the token is not your life
[1:45:13] the token is god's life living in
[1:45:17] you that's the only thing that's going
[1:45:19] to be accepted
[1:45:21] it's his life
[1:45:23] and seeing the conditions that this
[1:45:25] world in
[1:45:26] huh it ought to put us into state
[1:45:29] desperation
[1:45:31] now i want to make a confession this
[1:45:32] morning
[1:45:33] because i want to tell you right now i
[1:45:35] believe that the more of the love of god
[1:45:37] that we have in our heart the more we're
[1:45:39] going to feel
[1:45:41] travail and be in travail for the people
[1:45:45] and the way that they're going
[1:45:46] for the sin and the way that it's going
[1:45:48] it really should
[1:45:50] bother you
[1:45:54] and it doesn't mean as much as it should
[1:45:57] because i know what it's like to
[1:45:59] to have the love of god in your heart so
[1:46:01] much that you're sensitive to all of
[1:46:02] these things
[1:46:04] your sense of the people that are stuck
[1:46:06] in churches that are dead
[1:46:08] have been dead for hundreds of years
[1:46:11] for people that you know they're stuck
[1:46:13] in there they're afraid to come out of
[1:46:15] there
[1:46:18] amen
[1:46:20] i i feel for those out there those
[1:46:23] sinners they're tattooing themselves
[1:46:27] huh
[1:46:28] how many tattoos would you have if it
[1:46:30] wasn't for the grace of god
[1:46:32] huh
[1:46:33] how crazy would you be how far would you
[1:46:35] have floated right
[1:46:38] and it doesn't matter how wicked they
[1:46:40] look they need christ
[1:46:42] as long as they haven't blasphemed the
[1:46:43] holy ghost they're a soul that needs
[1:46:46] god
[1:46:49] i do believe this one thing that in my
[1:46:52] heart i say lord help me to get
[1:46:54] desperate about how bright my light is
[1:46:57] shining lord i need to trim my lamp lord
[1:47:01] i need to trim up all the dross and the
[1:47:04] you know
[1:47:06] just the lukewarmness just trim that all
[1:47:08] up lord
[1:47:10] help me to be a light to you help me be
[1:47:12] a light to my neighbor help me to you
[1:47:14] know try to help somebody out just to
[1:47:16] show them that i love christ don't you
[1:47:18] want everybody to know that you love
[1:47:19] christ that christ is the only way
[1:47:22] the only way to live is to be a
[1:47:24] christian
[1:47:26] i mean how many believes that we ought
[1:47:27] to get desperate about our tripping our
[1:47:29] lamps
[1:47:30] lord it's lip trimming time it's time to
[1:47:33] make sure it's shining bright that the
[1:47:35] life of christ is amen when we go out
[1:47:37] them double doors that we can see it in
[1:47:39] our in each other
[1:47:41] amen like brother uh
[1:47:44] luke gibson said you know something
[1:47:46] about we don't have friends but you know
[1:47:48] if we hang around make friends be
[1:47:49] different but church is over and folks
[1:47:52] were gone like a rabbit
[1:47:54] in there but shake one another's hand
[1:47:56] and and how are you doing
[1:47:59] like brother david said i think we're
[1:48:00] saying earlier about being there for
[1:48:02] people give them a call to you know just
[1:48:04] love one another
[1:48:06] how many knows we've you know we've
[1:48:08] gotten so cold until we don't know their
[1:48:10] neighbors dead until we see the paper
[1:48:16] amen need the love of god in our hearts
[1:48:19] how many needs more love god in our
[1:48:20] hearts
[1:48:22] i hope this has helped you this is just
[1:48:25] what the lord showed me
[1:48:27] whenever i realized you know i'm just
[1:48:29] getting a little dull here
[1:48:30] the word isn't flowing like it should it
[1:48:33] you know and i've let perhaps something
[1:48:35] else
[1:48:36] get in the way
[1:48:38] of that word just flowing and say oh
[1:48:40] lord showed me this the lord showed me
[1:48:42] that i don't know about you but i like
[1:48:44] to learn more oh god every day
[1:48:47] more things
[1:48:49] and i thought well brother father are
[1:48:52] you going to preach on a message on
[1:48:54] lettuce
[1:48:55] let us i mean
[1:48:59] well i thought brother bannon preached a
[1:49:01] message on go-tell
[1:49:05] right
[1:49:06] go tell
[1:49:08] go tell my disciples he's not dead he's
[1:49:10] alive
[1:49:12] he'd preach that sermon and then he'd
[1:49:14] say look i'm here to tell you that jesus
[1:49:16] is not dead but he is alive
[1:49:19] and he's here tonight
[1:49:20] and then he begins to learn the thoughts
[1:49:22] and tense of the hearts people just like
[1:49:23] he did with the woman at the well
[1:49:25] see he's here
[1:49:30] he's here brother brad he'd say he's
[1:49:32] here
[1:49:34] what would you do if he was in the
[1:49:35] meetings
[1:49:36] and he wasn't where you were supposed to
[1:49:38] be maybe you're a sinner and he said
[1:49:40] jesus is here
[1:49:41] if he's not i'm a false prophet
[1:49:44] if he don't come you don't got to
[1:49:45] believe a word i've said
[1:49:49] huh
[1:49:50] then he'd make how many wants to give
[1:49:52] their life to the lord

[1:50:20] a lot of times in canada and different
[1:50:22] places where people were starchy and
[1:50:23] he'd say what two or three came
[1:50:26] he says that hurt him
[1:50:28] that hurt jesus
[1:50:33] people knowing he's there
[1:50:35] yet won't surrender their heart
