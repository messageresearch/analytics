the best seat we got is right here and praise the lord thank you all that'll be awesome appreciate it amen i think that i've heard of a preacher back in the dark ages that made his congregation sit on rocks and stuff he didn't want him too comfortable i don't know who it was but i think by the banner or somebody just said something like that one time amen i don't know if they just didn't have a place to sit they were outside somewhere but anyway i don't know about you i'd be standing and praising the lord's locked out escaping you amen god bless you tonight it's good to be in the house of the lord good to see everybody out tonight we're good no test test test test test test to try that all right well that one was that one was making me think i was on right there so amen all right well let's just bow our heads go before the lord kind of heavenly father we do thank you lord jesus for another great grand opportunity lord a privilege lord and a freedom that we so enjoy that is to have a right to come together to worship you and to speak of your word father according to our conscience not according to what somebody else would dictate what we think or what we believe but lord to be able to worship you truly in spirit and in truth father we just ask god that you would just help us tonight now to take advantage of this opportunity and this privileged lord to give you the praise the honor and glory that's due to your name lord we assemble ourselves together lord father to come to find our bad places and see where we can be better lord where we can change where we can get closer to you lord and walk closer to you on a daily basis father and we just ask god that you'll bless the meditation of our heart that which we which we feel you've led upon laid upon our hearts to speak this evening we ask god you just bless the thought and especially bless your word above all father and we just ask god that you just bless each one now in the name of jesus christ amen amen turn of your bibles if you will we'll go to the book of romans i had a little thought and then i thought well i don't know about that you know and got to thinking on it again and there's just something kind of said yeah go ahead and speak on that amen so that's what we're going to go with tonight is that all right amen and so romans the 6th chapter romans 6. verse 16 know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or obedience unto righteousness but thank but god be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you being then made free from sin he became the servants of righteousness i speak after the manner of men because the for the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity and unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness for when ye were the servants of sin you were free from righteousness what fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed for the end of those things is death but now being free from sin he became servants to god you have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord amen may god add his blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated tonight we want to talk about the wages of sin amen and you know i was just going to read chapter 16 verse 23 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord but don't you agree that having read these other scriptures it really clarifies just what paul was trying to say amen that's right because he first of all he begin to talk about how that you know whoever you yield yourselves and whoever you obey whether it's sin unto death because how many knows that's where sin leads you to is death or of obedience unto righteousness so he's going to say basically telling us that we're going to go two different directions amen wages of sin leads to nothing but death and the other one obedience leads to holiness leads to righteousness he clearly says that one of course is uh you know you're the servant of sin which is no doubt but the devil and evil and unrighteousness which leads to death and the other one makes you a servant of god unto righteousness amen and he says ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life amen the wages of sin is death amen now there's three things that a there's a saying about sin and i'm gonna do a little bit of a class tonight would that be okay there's three things that sin will do to you all right are you all familiar with the phrase a couple of the phrases that are made from sin and where it takes you and so forth does anybody know any of those phrases raise your hand sister hannah anybody else no emilyn i don't think you know it yet but maybe all right you're further advanced and i thought your mom and dad would teach you if you did uh all right so sister hannah can you tell me one of the phrases about sin just one that's right okay now has anybody got any another one raise your hand no anybody else a sec there's three phrases go ahead josh that's good it'll keep you longer than what you want to say there's one more that rhymes with the stay there you go brother it'll cost you a whole lot more than what you want to pay so that's what we're going to talk about tonight amen talk about those three things how far that's in will take you how long that sin will keep you and how much it'll cost you and so i got to thinking about that and i said ah how are you going to make a message out of that anyway and then the lord just quickened it again says yeah that's that's good amen and so amen you you pray for me tonight is that all right and we're going to go through the scriptures amen and just look at some of these things amen especially now we and and we know that all unrighteousness is sin and i remember the prophet of god making this statement he said that you know the definition of sin means to anybody know it raise your hand sister becky no not exactly what i was looking for um sin the definition of sin what does it mean okay uh you'll probably remember remember a brother said that it was to me means to miss the mark it means to miss the mark amen in other words and i was thinking about this today about missing the mark and the bible talks about we pressed hard to mark for the prize of the high calling of god now let's say that and i hated to think about something that uh you know when you're when you're missing a mark on something to miss them it just reminded me the best uh analysis that i have of it would be you know shooting a bow or something and we're always trying to get that bullseye right woody we're trying to get it right there in that middle if our bow don't shoot right in that little black dot in the middle you know you know you're missing it now in our in our world with the deer and so forth while anywhere around there i'll probably get it but if you're truly a marksman and let's say that if he was trying to blow a bridge up he was trying to do something great and he had to hit just that little round thing before it would explode before it would do anything you know if it missed just a little bit it would never go off it wouldn't it would it would not it would do no good it would be absolutely null and void if you miss that little area and that's the way it is with the word of god am i right that if you miss what that bible says in that right just a little bit while it's a million as good as a million miles off amen and so that's means to mr mark and so forth but another one is analysis uh truly is unbelief is uh unbelief is to sin amen because that is the um uh the number one should we see the car of all sin or the sin itself amen is to disbelieve god's word amen so the first thing we know that uh if you mark 16 says go ye to all the world preach the gospel he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned so you are you know how many knows just think about that and how many people missed a mark right there that if you don't believe god you're gonna die if you don't believe the gospel you are gonna die and what i mean by dying i don't mean just take you know taking your last breath i'm talking about your soul being annihilated and becoming absolutely extinct nothing anymore in the second death that kind of death amen the soul that sinneth it shall surely die it'll come become annihilated in that lake of fire so that's what's going to happen to everybody that misses that mark amen amen and so uh the wages of sin the wages of all unbelief is death amen that's the ultimate death in them but all we know also know that god is commanded as many many commandments and to miss any one of those is also sin amen and now we have mistakes we have failures and so forth brother branham he makes a statement he says but it over in the i don't know this is just coming to mind i don't have this i haven't wrote down but we know that over in the book of john it says he that is born of god sinneth not for his seed remaineth in him and i didn't understand that for the longest time amen because he says if you're a seed of god you do not sin and i didn't understand that and the prophet comes along and he defines what unbelief is and what that sin that that is is talking about is that a son of god cannot disbelieve the word of god amen even before i come in the message even before i understood i heard anything about the prophet in my heart and my soul it was i believe this bible i believe it from giver to giver and i even believe the cover as the old black man said isn't that right it says the holy bible and i believe it's holy you know and so you know but that's the original that's the sin amen that's your actually i believe that's the original sin is unbelief because long before eve ever had an affair she didn't believe god's word we call adultery the original sin because that's what was the result for disbelieving of god's word but the original of course was disbelief amen so anyway and then what i was trying to say was now all christians and even everybody we as christians probably said every we have sins huh but we don't have sin and i was like well how do you explain that well sins is the failures that you have daily where you miss the mark daily that's sins failures men but the sin it was talking about to disbelieve god's word that would be death amen so we have christians have sins but they don't have that sin that it's talking about all right so my my my my we could stay here until about 12 o'clock praise the lord so praise the lord well shall we start so we find out that it is it means to make miss the mark and you know let's just take a few characters in the bible and i'll at the end of the sermon perhaps towards the end of it i want to take brother branham as an example but i want to take let's just take oh go to first sam second samuel if you will how many knows that david was a man after god's own heart david was a mighty man of god now we all know this is a good thought we all know that god knows everything right before god ever picks a person to be a leader huh he already knows what that guy's going to do all the way through all right all the way through he knew everything that david would do you know right and we would ourselves say well if god knew david was gonna do what he did would he just not pick him huh but yet god still chose david to be the king he meant he was after his own heart and david was really a mighty man of god he really was because it was what david was in his heart amen and so we know that david he sinned against god isn't that right he sinned and because it says that he was one day after there was a big war that was one and so forth and it says that david went on the roof of his house and he saw a woman bathing bathsheba bathing and she was very fair very beautiful woman and david sent messengers and so forth and he went and got bathsheba and he had an affair with bathsheba and then of course that was really really bad and then bathsheba writes back and tells him that you know i'm pregnant and so david tries to cover up his sin all right so we see a man here sin taking a man now it's beginning to keeping him longer than he really wants to stay david perhaps wanted to have this affair and so forth and that was going to be it but guess what something happened right and it wasn't over yet now this thing isn't going gonna be over with for a while it's not gonna be over for a long time it's gonna be it's gonna be a lot worse than he ever thought and that's the way sin is how many knows that even the prophet said that sin is beautiful sin is beautiful few it is uh it's pleasant to the eyes like he said it was it was pleasant to the eyes and so forth and you know that's why sin is but it's also very deadly now the wages of sin will ultimately kill you and it costs you a whole lot more than what you ever really want to give it'll truly keep you longer than what you still want to stay in that right and ultimately be death or the gift of god is eternal life notice one is costs you a whole bunch and it ends up killing you the other one is a free gift it's totally free don't cost you nothing and it gives you perfect life who would want to who would not want the last one amen so anyway and then so david had to do a cover-up job he had to start to keep this thing covered up so what does he do he calls uriah home and i think his captain was named joab if i'm not wrong and so he told him to come on home you know and give him a report of how the war is going and so forth he gave him a report and says all right you're right i did a good job go to your house now go home and enjoy yourself you know and he send him away with the meat and everything you know but uriah just laid it at the king's doorstep somewhere somewhere on the outside he wouldn't even go home and he said look here's the captain here's your captain and here's the armies of israel and they are out there and they're in danger and they're in battle and they're fighting from my lord he's been enjoying my family and all of that i'm not going to do that not while he was that kind of a dedicated man i mean was that what uriah was a real man wouldn't even want any of that because he wanted to be at his post of duty that right he wouldn't go so the next day when they came back and told david said you know raya won't go he won't go back to his house and so forth and and so forth and so david made a feast he had a dinner with him so here david is having to have lunch with the man that he cheated with his wife that had to be an awkward situation things got awkward how many know sin gets awkward really weird strange and it says that they no doubt drank a bunch of wine because it says that david got him grown he says i'll get him drunk and then he'll go home you know he got drunk but he still went and laid in the same place he was the same kind of man drunker's over huh so then david tries his best he said i got to cover this thing up harman knows you don't cover anything up now be sure that your sins will find you out he'll find you out and so then he does what does david do he says all right this ain't gonna work he ain't gonna go so i'm gonna send him back and david pens her letter and told his captain he says you know i want you to go up close to the city and i want you to take put him up in the worst the best of the enemies fighters take a group up to the best of the enemies fighters and then withdraw him so that he'll get killed direct orders and he seals the envelope and who does he give it to to take back uriah uriah carries his death sentence back to the captain that was pretty bad that was terrible see folks you'll get in deeper than what you want to get in it'll keep you longer than you want to stay amen and it'll take you further than what you want to go keep you in that place longer than you want to stay so he goes back and he gives the captain the paper the envelope the envelope he does exactly what david says uriah gets killed is that right iran gets killed and his wife finds out that your eyes dead and she mourns for a little while and right after she mourns and it's done with the morning time david sends after her and brings her into his house and marries her she becomes his wife all this all he's well huh david thought always well but all was not well i imagine david didn't feel so good right then do you couldn't feel so good having to give uriah get your eye in the eyes and here's a paper maybe he had some no doubt he had somebody else do it but he was still his doing amen it was still his doing amen one to another to cover it up to cover it up just couldn't cover it up so guess what he thought he had gotten away with it but god told nathan isn't that right go to david and tell him a little story about how that there was one rich man and one poor one had herds and flocks and so forth and this rich man got a friend to come in some company to come in and he went and got that poor man's little lamb hello he said he slept with the lamb and the lamb drank out of his cup in other words they did everything together he didn't mind licking the little lamb schlava he was set in love with his little lamb out of his cup ate up and slept with him oh my just this was all it was just oh my you know but he went and got that one and let me see if i can find the scriptures yeah and david's anger was greatly killed and kindled against the man and he said he shall surely die huh that's what david said he shall surely die see nathan caught david off hard david was the king he was for righteous he was doing things and so forth but he had something that he had done and he told this story and he wanted his judgment on it and then nathan says david thou art the man and thus saith the lord god of israel i anointed the king over israel i delivered thee out of the hand of saul and i gave thee my thy master's house and a master's wives unto thy bosom and gave thee the house of israel and of judah and if that had been too little i would moreover have given these such and such things oh my how many notes when you sin against god you're gonna cut yourself short god's gonna cut off some of the things that he would have given you have got so much more if you wouldn't have fallen into sin are you with me tonight i would have given you more wherefore has thou despised the commandment of the lord to do evil in his sight that has killed uriah the hittite with the sword and has taken his wife to be thy wife and has slain him with the sword of the children of heaven amen in other words he's you know now therefore here's your punishment it'll cost him a lot more than what he wants to pay now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house in other words you're never going to have a moment's peace in your lifetime it'll keep you a whole lot longer than what you want to stay a lifetime many times i can show you where it's for a lifetime amen because god has despised me and has taken the wife of uriah the hittite to be thy wife thus saith the lord behold i will raise up evil against thee out of that own house there is the first one how many knows absalon and oh my he had a big division his kingdom was divided for a while it was terrible terrible things david went through all that things that he suffered he had time to reflect and think about what he had done it was costing him dearly amen in the end if the world would just realize if everybody would just realize sin isn't worth it it's just not worth it for what little pleasure whatever little it might give you the torment that comes with it it's never worth it you sow to the wind and you reap a whirlwind i remember and i've said it before here brother brahm says watch anybody's life whatever you sow you're gonna reap with whatever measure you might it shall be measured to you again with whatever judgment you judged you will be judged blessed are in a merciful for they up shall obtain mercy amen out of that known house and i will take thy wives before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbor and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of the sun for thou ditched it secretly but i will do this thing before all israel and before the son and david said unto nathan i have sinned against the lord and nathan said unto david amen the lord hath put away thyles thy sin thou shalt not die so did the lord forgive david yes he did he forgave david otherwise he'd have been a dead man but he was going to get punished for it remember another place i think it was whenever he numbered israel that right and he says no david you shouldn't have done that now how do you want to be punished do you want the enemy to take over you and defeat you at battle so long or do you want to do this that or the other but i think was a plague that he said just let a plague strike thousands upon thousands upon thousands of people died because of his sin it's costly sin is very costly amen thou shalt not doubt shalt surely not die amen it's astounding amen all right let's go to another one shall we i want to go to saul first samuel first samuel 16. let's go to 15 first now saul was a different kind of a character saul was a little like brother branham's friends that went hunting and you know brother brandon the characteristic of brother branham is he loved to shoot guns and go to the range and he could drive tax with the 22 nine times straight the same bullet in the same hole that's what he liked to do right he liked to do that he was in one time they were just scattering everywhere and boy he was tore up nervous and don't understand why what was going on even was crying why can i get anything on i'd like me brother woody i can't get that message to shoot right i just guess i gotta buy a new bow all i need is to stick one arrow one deer why spend a thousand dollars on that well just one good shots all i need but me you know how it is you want something new you get frustrated you want you want that perfect shot man oh my but he was that way he wanted to he wanted that perfect shot and then he was squirrel hunting one time and he was out there hunting and he was waiting on squirrels to come and they wouldn't come at the right place and he was tr you know and i think he missed one shoot him right in the eyes i had to be at 50 yards where he don't shoot and then when he's at that yardage you know he puts him right in the eye just takes him right out he says they're friends down there you know they got a bunch of squirrels he only hadn't got any you know but they were down there and they would they didn't care where they hit it i don't know that they didn't have shotguns but you don't mean there goes the squirrel with a shot boom yeah i got it we all pick out the bullets later that's kind of you know just just kind of half shot just hit him anywhere he says you know that's fine with them that's how saul was saul thought that he could come close to hitting and it'd be good enough is that right i don't want to go too long on this but i'll read it before i read this other let me just say this so we know that the amalekites god had sent saul on his first mission to go down to the malachites to kill the king of ag and to wipe them all out man woman and child animals sheep oxen everything wipe it all out now he did it and then paul ended up bringing a gag back he let the people take some some moments of some of the spoils they brought sheep back to sacrifice to the lord and all those type of things they didn't do exactly what god had said to do amen i think this is a good lesson for all of us that's the way each and every one of us should be lord help me to do exactly what your word said to do not pretty close or about or it's good enough no let's not be that way god's not pleased with that he wants us to do just what he asks us to do why sometimes god would take and he would destroy a whole nation like that about this wipe them all out kill every last man woman and child and he had some might have said man that's kind of ruthless isn't it isn't that kind of extreme they refused so god don't say well i try to figure out why no just do what i ask you to do mean like the men of nineveh isn't that right give them a warning god is fair you know but anyway like i said it's a thought so anyway god tells samuel that he repenteth him that i have set saul up to be king for he has turned his back from following me has not performed my commandment and he grieved samuel and he cried unto the lord all night and when samuel rose up early i'm sorry chapter 15 verse 12 is where i'm at first samuel and when samuel rose up early to meet saul in the morning he was told samuel saying saul came to cam camel and behold he has set up a place and he's gone about and passed on going to gilgal and samuel came to saul and saul said unto him blessed be thou of the lord i have performed the commandment of the lord had he commanded had he done it and samuel said then what meaneth this bleeding bleeding of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the oxens which i have which i hear in other words i shouldn't be hearing the oxen i shouldn't be hearing the sheep what is all this done if you commit obey the commandment of the lord i don't know about you but i think we should all search our hearts and say why is this in my life what's this going on why am i like i am huh maybe i haven't command obeyed every command like i should maybe that's why first he thinks he did then he down in verse 22 let's just jump up a little bit and samuel said has the lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice amen and to hearken than the fat of rams for rebellion is at the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as the iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the lord he also has rejected thee from being king amen what a cost think about it saul never got a second chance god never gave all a second chance first time he messed up like that he says that's it because god knew what was on saul's heart and how he was because you've done this you have been rejected being amen that's a pretty costly price for some sheep and some oxen an egg that he kept alive also and a gay come up to samuel and says oh is there not enough death now is the stenches the horribleness of death past now and samuel talk about chopping somebody up folks it just got ruthless in the old testament how many knows it was some ruthless times we're talking about genocide we're talking about hacking people to pieces it's just that he told a he says as you have made many a woman a widow all right and many a child many a mother childless i believe it was so your mother will be childless today and i can just see it now samuel taking some hatchet and tacking that guy all the pieces that's how you obey god do what he says amen and then saul says please come and stand before the congregation me and bless me and all this said i ain't he begin to walk away samuel lit and saul grabbed the hem of his skirt and it ripped that right and he says as you have torn this so is your kingdom ripped from you and given to your neighbor somebody better than you sting right a real sting somebody that's better than you i don't bend my glasses crooked so if you're on me crooked forgive me okay and if you'll notice in chapter 16 to go on it says but the spirit of the lord departed from saul and a evil spirit from the lord troubled him not me knows this spirit never did leave saul it always came and it haunted him the rest of his days i thought man aren't you glad that when you catch a spirit that torments you a spirit that just man it drags down makes you feel horrible wouldn't it be terrible if god would allow that to stay on you forever that would be good would it we all know what that is but saul was that way god sent a bad spirit on him to torment him and he had that tormenting spirit all of his days and he had to have music played to soothe his spirit and to calm that spirit he had to have a musician and guess who was choking david let me ask you did that music do any good one place and it says that yeah it calmed him but next time he was playing what did saul do that spirit still jumped on him he grabbed the javelin over on the side and he flung it even as hard as he could he was going to spear him to the wall paul had a bad attitude saul had a bad spirit on it was a horrible spirit why because he was jealous of david when they sang about oh saul has killed his thousands a saul has killed his thousands but david is tens of thousands didn't they sing yeah they mean something about david tell them who they saw was like i hate that guy oh he hated david because he was a better man he had mistakes he had failures he was a human being amen once brother baby said that really david's fault the woman should have not been anywhere bathing where everybody could see her isn't that right she would do she could have seen herself covered stayed inside take a bath amen it's just what he said but david should have still resisted shouldn't he that's right he had to go through a lot of jumps he had to go through a lot of hoops and david still tried to cover it up a lot but it covered something up and you've got something away with but how many knows you're not gonna get away with it he says the day will come that hour will come that all that was done in darkness and secret all will be made manifest everything's going to be made manifest amen so that's so lo thank the lord that god can we can go down to prayer say lord jesus help me help me if you gotta torment you oh my thank god for repentance the holy spirit amen that can come back and hey heart amen oh my let me see there's so many but let's take another one let's go to aegin in joshua 7. joshua 7. how many knows aiken was aching for or breaking because he had taken something that didn't belong to him amen aiken trans god 18 and he caused the death of i think 36 men that right they had the greatest victory over jericho right not even a band-aid nobody even got a little scratch didn't even need a band-aid box all right and they took jericho took the whole city by simply going around at seven times blowing the trumpets the wall fell and they surrendered the next time but utterly destroy don't take nothing out of it and guess what aiken got down in there and he found some go a gold wet this chunk brother brad this chalk's big enough that i never gonna have to work again it was his retirement i can't resist my retirement my family's gonna be rich my wife's gonna wear nice clothes my children's gonna be fine i've got this big overcoat just that big king up here right here here we go get it over there to the wagon hey son come over here help me grab this thing and put it over there i know just how big it was but it was big enough to cost him a lot more and he wanted to pay and as far as keeping him to stay it was forever amen so how many knows after the 36 died they said sanctify we got to figure out who it is they went from tribe to tribe to you know down all the way down to families and it came the agent and it showed that it was j aiken and joshua said unto ache in verse 19 of joshua 7 joshua 7 19 and joshua said unto achan my son give i pray thee glory to the lord god of israel and make confession unto thee unto me now what thou has done hide it not from me and achan answered joshua and said indeed i have sinned against the lord god of israel and thus have i done and what i saw among this was a goodly guard a bible ownish garment and 200 shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of 50 shekels weight then i coveted them amen how many knows that covetousness bible says thou shalt not covet and took them and behold they are hidden in the earth in the midst of the tent and the silver under it and so joshua sent messengers tent and the silver under it and they took them out of the midst of the tent and brought them unto joshua and unto all the children of israel and laid them out before the lord and joshua and all israel with him took aitkin the son of sarah zebra and the silver and the garments the wedge of gold his sons his daughters his oxen his asses his sheep his tent and all that he had and he brought them unto the valley of achar and joshua said why hast thou troubled us the lord shall trouble thee this day and all israel stoned him with stones and burned them with fire after that they had stoned him with stones amen and they raised a heap of stones unto this day so the lord turned from the fears of his anger wherefore the name of that place is called the valley of a car unto this day my my my think about aiken having to look over at his wife honey boys children servants i'm sorry i shouldn't have done it it's going to cost all of you your lives you're all going to get stoned to death gonna throw rocks at your head and your body until you are dead and then they're gonna burn this with fire and put it all on the heap and put a big old pile of rocks see folks cost a whole lot more than what again would have wanted to pay if he had thought about that if he didn't know what was coming right he just says don't you dare son pick up one sliver of that silver don't you take that babylonian garment don't take don't touch that i guarantee you if every one of us realize hey that's what sin is stay as far away from unless you can because it'll only lead to death and sorrow amen that's exactly right aiken was aching for a break-in and certainly that's what happened his wife his children all of them weeping crying having to pay the price it took him further than they wanted to go kept them longer they wanted to stay and cost them everything another one number 16 nathan and korra nathan and korah they gathered themselves together in chapter 16 of numbers they rose up before moses with with certain of the children of israel 250 princes of the assembly famous in the congregation well-known men people that were of high standing high regard 250 of them nathan and korra got to side with them and they gathered themselves together against moses and against aaron and said unto them he take too much upon you seeing that all the congregation are holy every one of them and the lord is among them wherefore lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the lord amen might not look like a very big sin huh just to say look all the congregation is why do you put yourself up over everybody why do you have to be the big shot huh we want to be big shots too he can talk to us too um see the problem is is when you talk against the lord something that the lord is doing now if it's not the lord not the lord you ain't gonna worry about it but if it's the lord and his doing that's who you're dealing with you're dealing with god they made a big big mistake amen moses heard it he realized how bad it was that he fell on his face isn't that right and he said we'll see who's holy and who's righteous and he says take your fire put incenses on it and whole all of that and we're not going to read all of that what he did but in challenging him see who is right who's wrong but in chapter and verse 19 of the same chapter and korah gathered all the congregation against against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and the glory of the lord appeared unto all the congregation and the lord spake unto moses and to aaron saying separate yourself from among this congregation that i may consume them in a moment how many knows god wanted to take him out in a second god was pretty mad what we call angry that's right he was pretty angry he says just separate yourself and i will wipe them out in a second god could have done it and they fell on their faces and said oh god the god of the spirits of all flesh shall one man sin and will thou not and will thou be wrath with the whole congregation huh in other words moses was standing in the gap in that right he was playing the part of jesus christ for mankind because certainly we look at mankind and they certainly deserve to be taken out in a moment but moses says look give him a chance give him a chance just because somebody does that don't take them all out and the lord spake unto moses saying okay go ahead and speak unto the congregation and tell them get you up from about this tabernacle of corn nathan in a byram get you away from them and moses rose up and went unto nathan and byram and the elders of israel followed him and he spake unto the congregation saying depart i pray you from the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing of theirs least ye be consumed in all of their sins so they got him up from the tabernacle of korra and ethan abay ram and every side and dathan and byram came out and stood in the door of their tents and their wives and their sons and their childrens and moses said hereby shall you know that the lord has sent me to do all these works for i have not done them of my own how many beliefs that's so important it's not something that you do as a human is something that the god does and if they be visited like all of his men are visited then says the lord not sent me but if the lord make a new thing in the earth open her mouth and swallow them up with all that are pertains unto them and they go down into the quick into the pit then tell you and it came to pass as he had made an end of the speaking stop right there let's go back for a minute if you'll note notice that it says verse 26 i believe it is he spake to the congregation said depart i pray you from the tents of these wicked men and touch not there at least you be consumed with their so they get up from the tabernacle so most of the people from the sounds of it actually left left him they actually got out of there how many knows when you know something's wrong get out of there anything that's wrong get out of there get away from it amen and nathan and bioram came out in citizens for us okay now now notice back up here so most of them left came over to moses verse 31 and it came to pass as he had made an end of speaking all these words to the ground clave asunder that was under them and the earth opened up her mouth and swallowed them up their houses and all the men that are pertained unto korah and all their goods they and everything that are pertained to them went down alive into the pit and the earth closed upon them and they perished from among the congregation that was one time they should have kept the mouth shut and realized hey god has chosen moses to be the leader he doesn't need no input brother bran said that these guys were trying to make a denomination that's what denominations are denominations are something outside of the will of god something that god didn't appoint god didn't choose man made it amen you can go all through the bible all down through you can find denominations denominations man-made denominations amen oh we're not done yet are you ready everybody awake yet got another 10 minutes and all israel that were round about them fled at the cry of i don't know about you but i can almost hear the screams as they go into a bottomless pit as the earth swallows them up perhaps right down straight to that lava i don't know but they went right straight hit it says pit isn't that right go down quick into the pit screaming and hollering moms children's little children little girls little boys this is a little strong for our young ones maybe but anyway y'all need to learn sooner or later that you really want to obey god and do what god says amen for fled for the cry of them in other words i can see the crowd running away just going out into the woods and running from that place let me get away from here am i right for they said least yours swallow us up also now let me ask you this there was some the 250 men apparently didn't go down in the pit 250 apparently stayed above but read with me on verse 35 after the earth is closed and everything else and there came a fire from the lord came out a fire from the lord and consumed the 250 men that offered incense that weren't called to burn incense they thought they could but they weren't called to it amen it says it consumed them folks i don't know about you but seeing that many come out that happening would be quite something so then there was a peace offering made and all these other things right want to find out what happened next morning next morning okay after a memorial i guess verse 41 says but on tomorrow all the children all the congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses hello they were still not happy with god's leader even after god vindicated and proved him in that way they were still not happy with him how many knows that the children of israel they were the murmurous bunch you ever seen you just couldn't make them happy you fed them birds out of the skin water out of a rock give them water out of the rock and while they still picking with their teeth with the toothpicks just complaining about god well they eat new water here i enjoyed my meal but where's my water i don't know about you but i don't like a complainer and a whiner and god don't either i don't think you like it either do you and uh we don't use requirements because why god doesn't like it and they came out the next morning murmured against moses and against aaron saying yeah you oh my nathan carr says hey you who do you think you are making yourself you know the leaders above the congregate mounted not a group after seeing them guys deserves follow up had the audacity to open their mouth again and said moses and aaron you got you're the fault you're the blame a little bit of jeff but i would have liked been standing there with moses he says oh really did i take my hands and open the earth up no who did it him right well wake up that's who you're dealing with him wake up you couldn't wake them people up how many knows if you can watch something like that the day before and not wake up i don't know that you can't be woke up and we know that they couldn't how many knows they never did these folks never made it into heaven they won't be there because they came to katie's barney and they complained and murmured for the last time whenever the spies went over and said it's a good this that or the other they came back and gave brought a bad report joshua and caleb brought a good report they said did you bring us out here to kill us and almighty last time said that's it i'm done with it how many knows it even after this god was done with him again oh my so notice either thought that these people realize that the cost of sin is not worth it how many of those falling down in the pit thought boy oh boy i should have never thought that huh i should have never opened my mouth why couldn't i just be happy following what god has ordered but it was too late terrible price to pay and stay forever folks let me tell you something god didn't have mercy for you and for me every day we'd be in the same day god didn't forgive us of our failures and our sins we'd be in a pit we'd have a evil spirit on us we'd be worthy of death but i thank god he don't kill us he may punish us let me tell you something you backslide you get away from god you don't obey you you'll get punished don't think there ain't no my god he's not a dodie grandpa like me oh my that's right he just has children not grandchildren and he does punish but he doesn't kill that punishment most of the time is correction how many knows whom he loves he chases corrects chastises rebukes you don't just let your child say every time he does something wrong sorry sister natalie your children say sorry mommy mommy and you say that's okay all right you asked forgiveness and he does it again oh that's okay you have forgiveness right michelle and woody y'all do you forgive him every time hey once in a while you had a forgiveness you get grace can't no whip in this time but the next time it's whipping and all right sure there's some great there and a lot of times it's look i'll tell you what i'm going to have mercy on you instead of 15 we're going to make a 7 wax that's that's grace for you all right that's how i'm gonna that's how much i'm forgiving you for it why because they'd be coming back oh i'm sorry oh i'm sorry oh i'm sorry because they'd be getting away with it amen anyway i don't know who needed that but there it is so that's right so now notice and it came to pass when the congregation was gathered against moses against aaron after saying you have killed him that they look towards the tabernacle of the congregation and behold the cloud covered and the glory of the lord appeared in other words these people's voices got god's attention i mean those our voices it gets god's attention and moses and aaron came before the congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation and the lord spake unto moses saying get you up from amongst this congregation that i may consume them in a moment second time in what two days twice in two days if god says just come over here let me ask you something what if moses in there and would have went over there it's been over with let me ask you something what if jesus wouldn't come to the cross we'd have been done but he stood in the breach for us i thank god that he stands in my breach for me every day i thank you for the grace that's still there and when you do something wrong when you fail you can go to your knees and you can be forgiven how you know sometimes bad things happen we don't understand hey lie it's happened to me it's happened to you it's happened to all of us we go through things that we don't understand whenever we do that whenever i do that i say god i don't know if this is punishment for what i have done then let me bear it and be patient isn't that right because sometimes it probably is amen teaching us hey you don't want to do things that's contrary to the word of god or you'll pay all right if i'm going to get to my last story i better hurry here but it's that god once again would ask the same thing they fell on their face before the lord they took a censor they ran up to the censor to the altar put it on there quickly unto the congregation said make an atonement for them for there is wrath going out amongst the from the lord and the plague has begun and aaron took moses commandment and ran into the midst of the congregation and behold the plague was begun among the people and he put on incense and made an atonement for the people and he stood between the dead and the living and the plague was stayed now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred besides them that died of the matter of korah amen doesn't say how many cores family was but it was two or three families but this was fourteen thousand men that it cost because they once again murmured and complained it cost dearly dearly that it cost how many knows every time sin will cost you ultimately it leads to death it's more it takes you further than you want to go it costs you more than what you want to pay and it keeps you a whole lot longer than what you want to say amen one more story the prophet of god i'll just repeat this brother branham when he was 20 21 years old married his the love of his youth how precious the love of your youth is precious amen and to make a long story short we know that he was a baptist brother brandon was in baptist church and he of course he got excommunicated from that later and take pushed out and so forth but he had taken a trip up north and he was on the way back and he went to a pentecostal meeting in that right one of those pentecost when pentecost was on fire he went in there and there was a meeting in oh my and they had him to come up you know and and just give his name and so forth and and go through with the others the next morning when he was back there sitting in the next service right this little t-shirt she soccer trousers i believe it was amen and they chose the preachers they're going to take pick somebody out of god out of all them preachers they're going to pick a preacher and he says uh there was a man up here by the name of william branham last night we want him to take bring a service does anybody know where his whereabouts is huh where's his worry about somebody brought him hunker down oh he had a t-shirt on some circle pants isn't that right my all right i'm covering it up and the black guy says you know he is you know yeah yeah yeah i'm him don't tell nobody he says he is he is oh my brother he said he got up there he got up there and he began to preach on uh uh boy i should remember this then he lifted up his eyes what was it then he and then he cried and then he cried yeah and he talked about all of this and he began to really preach the how down and he said god just reached anointed to them and he was god picking him out isn't that right and so after the service man a man from texas wearing a big hack i had a big denomination big church and man two three four five he had a handful of invitations come preach for me come preach for me come preach for me hello and it was where brother branham was supposed to go that's when he was starting to preach and he went back home isn't that right and he told his wife and his wife on it to go and she believed it and everything and his mother-in-law says don't you take my wife out amongst all that trash huh that holy roller trash that's nothing but a bunch of trash bunch of outcasts that they ticked out and all the other stuff you know brother benham and his wife hope she says honey i know my mom feels that way but whatever you do i'm for you you know i'm with you good wife right i'm with you you know you go he says no no if that's how she feels we just won't go and brother brandon didn't go let me tell you some how many knows did god give him the gift of healing he had given him faith he had discernment that he could discern the thoughts of people's hearts and that would ignite the faith of the people so much that they know jesus christ was there and people would get healed they would get saved and multitudes hundreds and thousands of people that didn't get it because he wouldn't go when the holy spirit said go he disobeyed god and then there was a ohio flood y'all remember that he was he said he predicted that the river would come up at 20 20 22 feet at spring street or whatever and everybody laughed ain't never been that i ain't gonna get that eye but the water got that high he was trying to help people and everything else and his motor wouldn't start on his boat he was coming towards them falls out there he could hear the roar and he was crying god forgive me forgive me forgive me just before going over god let him start it up take up the river as a result of it all we know that his wife ended up getting the disease and dying and she was at her deathbed in that right she was there dying god refused his prayers all kinds of horrible things happened and there he was when he was right there and if you'll remember his wife when she was uh when he went in there and he says hope hope hope don't die on me or whatever or come back here he's calling on her and pray for us is that talk to me and she came back from wherever she was and she says honey why did you call me back it was such a beautiful place she said it's such a beautiful it's what you preached about it's so beautiful why did you call me back and she says you know honey what did she tell him you know where we made our mistake you know i'm here all of this is because you didn't go when god said he wanted you to go you sinned you missed the mark this is what it's costing and i said honey at the resurrection you stand over at the gate when you see abraham isaac and jacob come in when you see all the saints come in stand there by the post and see in case keep saying bill bill i'll have the children and i'll meet you there that was my last date with my wife how many knows that went with brother branham all the days of his life to know that that was his fault because he listened to his mother-in-law rather the voice of god the voice of god that we hear that still small voice and listen to that voice because if we don't we pay the price that was my last date with my wife by god's help i'll keep it she went to be with god we taken her down there to the undertaker and then they come by and they said billy your baby's dying too and no i said no no it can't be i rushed to the hospital there laid my little baby dying oh my my heart he says the way of a transgressor is hard remember that when god calls you go on no matter what anybody else says you serve god i laid my hands on the little baby and i said god please don't take my baby let her live she was my little darling and i couldn't stand to see her go and it looked like a black sheep came down in front of me another place he says you know is at that time the devil whispered in his ear said god don't love you because the devil knew not to tell him that there ain't no god he knew there was a god there was no question but the devil knew just what to tell him he doesn't love you he don't hear your prayer he don't care about you and the devil tried to put it in his mind he says if that's how god's going to be that right he never said it it was just something that came in his mind but he says the lord gave the lord taken away blessed be the name of the lord but he came down and i couldn't stand to see her go and it looked like a black sheep came down and then i raised up i put my hands on my head and i raised my hands up to god and i said god i'm so sorry that i have done the way that i did forgive me please keep my baby here with me i love her there lays laser mother dead don't take my baby too i promise you i will preach i don't care what the world says my heart was breaking and i know i had to reap what i sowed and i put my hand on the baby again and said god not my will but thine be done and the angels came and packed her away amen the way of a transgressor is hard the wages of sin is death stand with me tonight musicians if you want to come let's bow our heads and think about the sweet holy spirit that is in our hearts that tells us things on a daily basis that sometimes we miss and we pay for missing those voices and for not heeding the voice of the true son of god the true holy spirit in our hearts i wonder tonight if everybody in here in their heart would say you know i want to always make sure that i'm listening to the right voice let me run from the wrong voice let me always listen to the right voice for it'll lead you right it'll lead you to life it'll lead you to liberty and peace and joy all the wrong voices that tell you to do wrong tell you this doesn't matter that doesn't matter how many tonight would just raise your hand say god let me hear your voice let me hear your voice let me know that it's your voice whatever i do whatever job i take whatever girl i marry boy i'm married whatever church i go to whatever it is i want to hear your voice i want to know that it's right and that it's you i don't want to sin lord when i'm tempted when the different things come i'll be able to realize god let me get a run from that thing it'll only bring damnation to my heart condemnation it'll bring hardness that's way of a transgressor is hard now lord jesus we come before you we ask god that judges as we raise our hands help thomas byler tonight lord may everybody put their name to it help me lord jesus to hear your voice every day let me adhere to your voice god and let me never follow the wrong voice never let me go down the wrong road but always the right path that leads to life and joy father i pray tonight god that each and every one both here father and those streaming lord their hearts would say god help me from this day forward know what is the right voice and what is the wrong voice and follow that right voice father and we know that your word is your voice father it's what you have told us we ask god that you bring peace to every heart that you bring joy to every heart and we wanted you to know that we're worthy of death but yet you spared us yet you had grace upon us and we're so thankful father for that we ask god that you continue to lead guide your people by your spirit in jesus name amen and amen god bless you
