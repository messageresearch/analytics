Proverbs 3 read a few uh all the way up to verse 17 here Proverbs 3 my son forget not my law but let thine heart keep my Commandments let not mercy and Truth for AK thee bind them about thy neck write them upon the table of thine heart trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding be not wise in thine own eyes fear the lord and depart from evil honor the Lord with thy substance and with the first fruits of all thine increase my son despise not the chastening of the Lord neither be wary of his correction happy is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that GTH understanding he is more precious than rubies and all the things thou can desire are not to be compared unto her this one together her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace God bless you may be seated brother Brian morning brothers and sisters before I get started um if you would turn over to Isaiah the 12th chapter it'll be a week or two before I get back in church I'm having my surgery in the morning for my need but I thought I'd go over this I mentioned it back in the prayer room in the U in the general fund there's about $122,000 as of about $12,300 and in the building fund there's about $5,500 in the building fund and and I haven't made a deposit but um well I will try to make a deposit by the end of next week um so that's where the finances are all the bills are paid uh all everything's been paid up to date and there's about a about $1900 left in the Fuel Fund so I'll actually before my surgery in the morning call for them to fill the tanks up one more time uh we're down to about 40% and I'll just be honest I know I say this a lot but when when it gets cold like this the heat doesn't shut off it just runs all the time that's we got got a floor system but uh something more important I was that one quote that was up there the thing the last sentence in it really struck me um he said that your life should testify it should have all these examples in it you know Faith honesty charity all those things you should be coming out from the abundance of your heart and the spirit being inside you but the last thing he said there was no guarantee that you were baptized in the Holy Ghost it really struck me that you could still do all the right things and if you hadn't got quiet enough in your spirit and surrendered your whole life everything that you are to Jesus Christ it still wouldn't mean anything it really it it's really a real sobering thought to realize it's not a game you don't play with it everything about it is important it's your very life your very salvation is based upon you totally surrendering in everything you are to Jesus Christ this morning and I was uh I missed that this is a short chapter here um I'll just read what it has to say it's only about I think it's six or seven verses here in Isaiah and in that day shalt say oh Lord I will praise thee though thou was angry with me thine anger is turned away thou comforted me and you know like brother Rand said all the preachers tell you when you read the word of God you you got to see yourself in it if you can't see yourself in it you're going to have a problem accepting it and he goes on to say behold God is my salvation and that's true this morning for all of us this morning God is my salvation I will trust be not afraid for the Lord Jehovah is my strength my song he has also become my salvation you know and I was out there and I was just thinking this morning everything out there if you let it it'll AAP the very joy out of your heart and out of your life this morning and the only way you keep that Joy is to stay in God's word and he goes on to say here therefore with joy shall we draw water out of the wells of salvation of the Holy Ghost and your heart and life it's your willingness to yield yourself to Jesus Christ this morning that keeps that joy in your heart that abides in you and he goes on to say here and in that day shall you and in that day shall you praise the Lord call upon his name declare his doings among the people make mention the name his name is exalted sing unto the Lord for he ha done excellent things this is known in all the Earth cry out and Shout the inhabitants of Zion for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee and I'm going to jump over here if you want you can turn to Matthew the 19th and 20th chapter but I was uh read reading that devotional again this morning I'm I'm not going to read this whole paragraph but really struck me about this I'll read this uh chapter here and this 20 I'll actually read out of the 20th chapter now you can study all night and study all day and when you come up here I anyone that's come up behind this pulit to tell you your very thoughts and everything you do you want God to be in it you don't want to take your own ideas and your own ways you just want to let God have his way so sometimes when I'm up here I might I I really careful about the things I say but if I let the word of God speak for itself and you know it it may bring about a change in my life and everyone else but this is the 11th Hour this is where Jesus talks about the people I'll just read it let it speak for itself for the Kingdom of Heaven is like a a man that is in a householder and went out early in the morning to hire laborers into the venue and that's where we're all at this morning you I don't know what hour you were hired at but God knows what hour you were hired at this morning and when he agreed with the laborers for a penni's day he sent them into the vineyard you know I always find it striking when I read God's word God just doesn't want you to be lazy and lay around he actually wants you to work and be be productive and whatever you are both spiritually and naturally he went out about the third hour and saw others standing in the idle in the marketplace you know and and he said unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right I will give you and they went their way so you see hour after hour he kept on finding people that could work for him and again he went about the sixth the ninth hour he did likewise and about the 11th hour he went out and found others standing idle and he said unto them why stand you here all the day idle so idleness is not a good thing and he goes on to say they said said unto him because no man hath hired us he saith unto them go you also into the vineyard on whatsoever is right that shall ye receive so when they so when evening was come the Lord of The Vineyard said unto his Steward call the laborers and give them their hire beginning with the last unto the first and when they came that excuse me when they came that were hired about the 11th Hour they received every man his his Penny you know when I think of that as honest thought you know working 12 hours a day for just a penny that's an awesome thought right there you realize how blessed we really are in this day and age in 2024 but when the first came they they supposed that they should have received more they likewise received every man his pending and they have received it they murmured against the Good Men of the house saying these last I've brought but one hour and I was just thinking this morning as I was reading this you know whether you're a old Christian a young Christian wherever your experience is God blesses people in different levels at different times and and the most important thing is not to be jealous of what other what God is doing for someone else just to realize that God is more than able to do something for you this morning and saying the last I've brought for but one hour thou has made them people onto us which have borne the burden of the heat of the day but he answered one of them and said friend I do these no wrong did this that not agree with me for a penny take thine is and go this way and I will give on to the last even as I and I got to raise my hand here because that's where I'm at you know we're in that last day Ministry ourselves and God whatever he gave to the ones in the beginning he's going to give to us in the end it is not lawful for me to do that which with my own is th own I evil because I am good so the last shall be first and the first last but many be called but few are chosen I was just thinking this morning you know as the world goes that's where we're at you know I was thinking this morning you know I can I can I know I say this a lot I don't mean to say things but I honestly mean this I can as a Christian I really I can only speak for myself where I'm at in my experience this morning with Jesus Christ and just like you all you can only speak for yourself you know where you're at this morning you know your struggles you know your high points you know your low points and if you're a Christian this morning and you don't know who you are or what you really are then it's not the time to be just hly going down the course of Life Without Really knowing who you are and how the word of God looks at you not how your brother or sister looks at you but how the word of God in Jesus Christ looks at you that in this coming year that's the most important thing I could think as a Christian this morning and I'm not going to read this whole thing I know I say that a lot but at the end of this thing really struck me we you know we all have examples what we look at as a you know as a child you look at your father you look at your mother you try to emulate them you try to not to use big word you try to copy them try to be like them and then when you get to be a teenager like all you got to be a teenager and a young man and you seen the faults in your father and mother so you so but we have an example that we can follow this morning where there is no false in that's Jesus Christ this morning and brother brandom said and the word says look for good examples to to follow look for good examples to make your life align with and I'll just read what he had to say and sit down he said when I I'm at if you went to the devotional for today I'm about halfway down in this quot when I first come among you groups 10 years ago to look like a church but today it looks like the world and we I I can think for myself that just the message of the hour you know there's so many different opinions so many different ways this morning he could he would probably say the same thing about us he today it looks like the world it's the truth something happened somewhere you got to wearing better clothes you got to making a little more money and it's just made you a sap out out of you that's all now now that's truth you're right you're trying to act like the rest of the world today is compromising time that's true and I sometimes when I read this you know I think of in 1959 or 1956 you know I wasn't even born but you think of now 2024 how much worse it is seeing forward in time that's true you paint your steps red and watch you see your neighbor doesn't paint in Step red sure you wear a little round hat church with a feather up in it watch all your women come to church with a little round hat and a feather up in it all of them want to look like one another it's a matching time you know and I look at that you don't try to be totally different either you're not trying you know you don't want to be like everyone else but then you don't want to be totally different than everyone else you want to be what God leads you to be you know that's true it's a matching time amen now I'm going to tell you my brother I don't care whether my shoes match your trousers or my trousers match your coat I want my experience to match God's Bible That's the matching time so whether you brother overdresses or underdresses you that doesn't make a difference to you you want your own experience to match God word and matching time if you want to match something match your experience against Paul and we have we have examples in our Bible going back from Genesis all the way to Revelation that we can match our lives that we can emulate I don't mean to use a big word again that we can copy to be a better example amen if you want to match something match your experience against Paul's amen that's what we need today is a matching time with Paul's faith in the Bible what you could say this morning you need to have brother bram's faith in the Bible your P there are examples where you see they have great faith in the word of God that's what we should be em use it again we should be copying this morning that's our example right real matching time don't try to match your neighbor match some saint of the Bible don't look at everyone else look at the examples in God's word if you are a saint act like a saint and that's pretty simple you know it's the simple things people leave undone a lot in life if you're a saint act like a saint walk like a saint dress like a saint and talk like a saint but don't live outside your experience either don't be any more than what you really are that's my own words that's not this quote pray like a saint believe like a saint dress like a saint be like a saint live a live a saint die like a saint and go to heaven like a saint amen and the only thing that's going to bring you over there on that day is a baptism in the Holy Ghost this morning and that's where we're at this morning you know I've heard a lot of preachers lately you know brother randam preached messages it's your choosing time that's where we're at this morning we all have to make a choice in a year 2024 are we going to go backward or we going to go forward are we going to keep moving forward as God leads us or we just going to give up and I can tell you right now out there in the world that Spirit that's out there it can make you Sur Ender pretty easy if you don't stay close to a prayer and a and a Biblical relationship with Jesus Christ this morning brother David amen love him this morning amen you enjoyed that that was very good brother Brian God bless you this morning amen don't you just love him this morning and amen let's stand and sing that little

hear from me or any other man they just be leave here with disappointment but Lord if they've come to hear from you this morning morning if they come to to to hear what comes from the Throne of God this morning they would leave here at different person they will leave here with a overcoming Spirit they'll leave here with forgiveness in their heart with joy and love and peace and all the goodness that you have in store for us Lord so Lord we just commit ourselves to you this morning and we just ask Lord that you would just step into Sho leather this morning that you would anoint the the words and the thoughts that you've placed upon my heart and allow my lips just to speak freely but Lord more importantly open our hearts Lord my heart the believer's hearts here Lord Jesus open our hearts that we could receive not just hear words words can just be repetitious but Lord if we could just receive what you'd have in store for us and just say that's my portion of God for today that's going to get me through tomorrow Lord we love you with all of our hearts Lord and in your name we ask these things and praise your name in Jesus Christ amen amen get myself uh myself out of the way and I think God's got something good in store for us this morning and you know it's January the 21st and I'm sure all resolutions have been broken by now you know what I'm talking about they're made to be broken and uh so after 21 days you either formed a habit or you've broken your resolution and and uh we're not going to talk about resolutions today but we're going to talk about restoration and restoration is what what the bride is in a restoration process and I want to speak this morning to you on restoring God's domain and as we begin to preach I want you to think about the domain and as we look at what a domain is I want you to to understand a domain is an area listen to this an area of territory owned or controlled by a ruler or government a domain is an area of territory owned or controlled by a ruler or government turn in your bibles if you would and to Genesis chapter 1 we'll also read from Revelations 21 I preached some of these thoughts in in Arizona we thank you for your prayers while we were there and I told Brother Bor we definitely had Liberty out there in brother Ted's Church sends greetings uh brother Ted hated that he couldn't be here this year and but he uh he just loves the people here he loves Kentucky probably as much as he does close as much as he does Arizona and uh he just sends his greetings and we love brother Ted and and all he's done for the for the Lord and and the his ministry and around the world tens of thousands of people's no doubt been touched by Brother Ted's Ministry and and just a just a real real Soldier and Warrior for God and I you know I you know I get sappy I can't help it but I just think about I se and sister Mna and you know they gray and hair and I think one day all the work all the toil all the sacrifice even made for himself his family it'll all be a treasure and he'll wear a crown for that and I just thank Lord help me help me but uh we thank you for your prayers while we were out there our our little trip was extended by a couple of days most of you probably heard and and uh you know the Lord works all things out was we I shouldn't keep you standing I'm sorry have a seat for just a minute and I I'll change you I shouldn't keep you I apologize I get to talking and and but Lord knows all things about about our trip I tell you we we got out there and and uh one of the first days it was great we got to see hope and spend time with with John and Alicia and and with hope and Bo and and went out to eat and so forth and went to church and man a great service there brother Ron's uh on they were given a missionary report and you know I just I think about the missionaries and and the work that they do and and we could just pour so much more into Mission work because there's a definite need out there and uh but as as the trip goes on we're supposed to go and we've got our itinerary all lined out where we're supposed to be what we're supposed to do and we've been traveling we we get to our destination and at about 12:30 a.m. the next day after we've been traveling I gu yes we started about 3:00 a.m. and arrived at our destination at at 12:30 so several hours of travel and we go into the hotel and I said I need I'm here to get my room I've got a reservation she says give me your name so I give it to her she said we don't have no res reservation for you I said uh yeah you do she said no we don't have a reservation I said I got a confirmation she said let me see your confirmation number i h it up she said sir that's for next Wednesday I said well please tell me you got a room she said we do but you're you're room's not transferable nor is it refundable I said so I just uh trying to keep my composure there and it's my mistake I've done it wasn't nothing they done and and I'm the whole time think how could you do how could you do that how could you make that mistake knowing it's non-refundable how could you mess this up we get in the elevator and I said this trip is starting off as a horrible trip 12:30 in the morning this trip is starting off to be a horrible trip we wake up the next morning 5 inches of snow on the ground praise the Lord so now our our itinerary man should we go do we go north do we drive through this or what do we do you know I don't know how the mountains are I've never been in that terrain and Flag Staff and so anyway long story short we we tread on through and we drive through snow and ice for I don't know an hour or so to get to where halfway to where we were going then it clears up and and we get up there and and things just start to man it just turns into a wonderful trip of course my kids now Weston and Carson are making fun of me this is horrible ain't it that you know it's just on and on you know it never it never ends when they got something on you it never ends and so they're they're never ending on us and so on men but it did turned out to be just a just a great trip and and and God we just got to see so many things and spend time with friends and ones we hadn't seen maybe in 20 years and spend time with brother Russell and he took us out riding and and uh they got more stories on me they they probably share videos if you ask but uh they got more stories on me of where I they can laugh at me and that's okay I'm I take it so but uh long story short we get to the uh getting ready to come home and I'm getting ready to go out and preach and I'm you know you're always on your mind what's next on the list I'm you know we got to leave here at certain certain time to get to the airport and I'm gonna go out got to go preach so I get ready to go out to the to the you know get ready to go out to to preach and I get a message your flight's been cancelled due to weather and I think man this is not what I need to hear right now this is not what I need to hear right now so we uh we prayed brother Ted and myself and the church prayed and things would work out and you know what it always works out out it always works out if we can just keep oursel out of the way keep our emotions keep our feelings out of the way and just say God you're in control this trip was pre-planned before the foundation I can't change one day of it there's not one thing I can say that would be different and just just you take control and so that's what we did and and uh it worked out and and hotel was available and and they told of our situ God blessed us with a with a nicer room so you know it just God is good to his to his people and if we commit things to him so we was able to spend more time and visit and and while you were at ne4 we were at 65 so I'm not complaining at all about that so God is good and uh and and he's good to us all the time but as we we get into the to the word here I'm going to preach and restoring God's domain and let me just start kind of start over it get this back in your head let's change gears that we've got got that got that out there and uh just just to say thank you for your prayers but God's domain restoring God's domain so a domain is an area of territory owned or controlled by a ruler or government and brother Bram he he picks up here and he says brother Neville preached this morning a notable message and the last thing he said on his last thoughts was to be restored and so it gave me an idea right there to restore and he said now I I got my dictionary and I got the scripture notes and I begin to copy some things down and and I got Webster's Dictionary to find out the right definition for ReStore and he said restore means to return to the former owner or to bring back the former estate of a condition and he said and we can enforce a claim to be restored so we as Believers can enforce a claim to be restored he now Webster says it means to bring back to its former owner owner or bring back to a former state of condition and if the claim is made on something it to make a restoration you can enforce it to make it come back to its right place to restore means bring back to claim a claim can be enforced now to bring anything back to its rightful owner listen what he says where it belongs where it belongs you see we have rights and we have privileges that Satan has taken away from us in time and he's come down he's begin to Rob us of the things that we enjoy and things that God wants us to have in our lives but the word tells us he says it can be restored to where they belong and he says therefore there's some way some way listen what he said how he words things is amazing to me but he says and there's there's some way it went away from its rightful owner some way it went way some something happened some there was a circumstance or an inant and something happened and maybe it was your joy maybe it was your righteousness maybe it was your love maybe it was the peace that God gives you of understanding in his word somehow that be to to leave away from its rightful owner and he says it can wander around anywhere so now the very things the Privileges and the goodness that God has given you now has beg to wander around anywhere when Satan gets his hands in it and he said but to restore means being bring back to who really owns it you really own righteousness you really own forgiveness you really own Joy these are things that you own privileges that God has given you and I as the Bride of Jesus Christ you own it and he says or to bring it back to its natural state bring it back brothers and sisters we own overcoming power power we own Victory this morning we own all of these things do we own gifts we own healings we own Miracles it's not just for a day gone by but we own it it's just out there wandering somewhere waiting for you to get the restoration to pull it back into your rightful ownership you say I've never seen a miracle it's out there for you I've never seen a healing it's out there for you and in order for you to do this in order for you to do this you have a right to enforce you have to enforce this rightful condition of restoration to restore now if you would stand to your feet and we'll read the word we've laid a foundation amen Genesis chapter 1 we're going to take our time this morning and my my notes as I got up at three this morning they grew from four pages to nine pages to 13 pages to 20 Pages thank God we've got next Sunday too but we're going to break it up and and we do want to take our time though so I'm I'm watching the clock Genesis chapter 1 in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth so we see here from the very beginning that God was building and God has a carpenter in his mind and he has a goal in his mind of what he wanted his creation to be he had an image in his mind and said this is what will happen when I create the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and the Darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness so right here we can see in the very beginning in Genesis we see that there is a light and there is a Darkness so we can spiritually we can say there is a separation we can see the two forces working in the framework of the church in the very beginning in the creation a light and a dark and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day Revelations 21 find your place there so we see in Genesis as we just read we see God presenting himself as the alpha the beginning where it all started Revelations 21 we see six things happen as we read this scripture we see a new Heaven we see a new Earth A New Earth we see a new people we see a New Jerusalem we see a new Temple and we see a new light and it says in in Revelations 21 and I saw new Heaven and new earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there were no more sea and I John saw the holy city a New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be whose God their God their God our God my God and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new what a restoration behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true true and faithful and he said unto me it is done Omega it is done it is done I'm the alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end in other words brothers and sisters we have no need to worry we have no need to fear no need to fret we don't have to be concerned or consumed because this is a finished work and God finishes what he starts if God has started a work in your life he will finish finish that [Applause] work he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son you may have your seats if you want to thumb real quick to Matthew 21 I'm going to read just another portion there just to keep building on what we've what we've started with but I think you see where we're going God is in control God will restore all that is a lost all that is wward all that all it's missing in your life there is a restoration taking place Matthew 21 we have to be able to accept what God can do through US many times I think we fear that we're not good enough for God to work through us we're not spiritual enough for God to work through us or we think that maybe God just simply don't work through us that's not true the bride will be a working living Act of God just as it was in the days of Pentecost when God come down and and and poured himself out on that group of people they were living working breathing acting God for their [Music] [Applause] hour Matthew 21 familiar story here now in the morning as he returned into the city hungered so here is God now Jesus is showing us his his uh his human side every one of us can be familiar with that we know what it means to hunger even from a baby out of the womb they cry when they're what hungry and Jesus says here I'm hungered and he saw a fig tree in the way and he came to it and he found nothing there on but leaves and said unto it let no fruit grow on thee henceforth forever and presently the Fig Tree withered away and when the disciples saw it they marel and saying how soon is the Fig Tree withered away now watch here what Jesus says to him he answered and said unto him verily I say unto ye if ye have faith and doubt not ye shall not only do this which is done to the Fig Tree but you shall also say unto this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea and it shall be done and all things whatsoever you asked in prayer believing you shall receive in other words if you have a domain if you have domain in your life if you have an area in your life that you are completely controlling through the Holy Ghost all these things are possible now in the beginning I'm G to take my time and just kind of go through some of this in the beginning here God begins to create and he creates the Heaven and the Earth and I want you to see that as God begins to create he has a thought in his mind and God begins to build upon these thoughts and God speaks and things come into existence which never were before the universe itself is simply created by the spoken word of God did you ever realize that the spoken word we talk about the spoken word we have to have the spoken word of God in our lives what does that spoken word do it creates the atmosphere around us and God is there looking at this now this universe is being created by God's spoken word brothers and sisters this is not an accident this is not a mistake but this is God's self-expression of almighty God using the spoken word as an example of how he operates how he operated then is how he operated in Jesus how he operated in Jesus is how he operated on the day of Pentecost how he operated on the the day of Pentecost is how he should be operated in you and I there is an order to this creation on day one God creates the light and separates it from the darkness and he forms the day and the night and he begins to separate the waters and creates the skies and on day three he separates the dry land from the sea now keep in mind all of these are essential for what is to follow you see God's not surprised by what's happening in your life this [Applause] morning he wake up and say oh my goodness I can't believe what's happened in Brian Baldwin's life today he never said that but he's got a creation in order and you are I are a part of that creation so God knows before the foundation of the world exactly what we'll be going through the life we'll be going through what's happening in your life today and he sets all this in order and he meticulously plans all of this out and God begins to fill the Realms that he's created so on the remainder of the third day he creates plant life and on day four he creates the Sun the moon the stars he has to create the Sun the moon the stars for the plant life to live he couldn't put the cart in front of the horse he had to do it in sequence he had to do it in order he had to know what was coming on day five God fills the water in the sky with fish and birds that could not have survived without plant life you see what I'm saying sometimes we think our life is all in chaos but God says I've got an order I've got a plan I know how to create this is not this is not anything new to me nor does anything surprise me right finally on day six six God begins to create the animals and then he comes to the Apex of his creation Humanity Humanity where where God wants to populate the land he looks there in Genesis 1 and 26 and he says let us make man in our image after our likeness and let him them have domain you see that let them have domain over the fish of the sea and over the fowl the air and over the cattle and over the Earth and every creeping thing upon the Earth so God created man in his own image he did not create man in the likeness of the world he didn't make man in the likeness of your church he didn't make man in the likeness of the government or the schools you attend he didn't even make man in the likeness of what man thought he should be because if I was created if I created myself myself the way I thought I should be it sure wouldn't work and fit into God's plans well some of you is honest because without the Holy Spirit In Our Lives leading us and guiding us we can be so far off the Mark we don't even know where we would be we just drift through life through streams of time not knowing what what would be the next curve down the road but he created him in his own image and he said he created them to be fruitful and to multiply and rep replenish the Earth and subdue it look at that word subdue subdue means to conquer and to bring it into subjection it means to bring it under control so God now has creating this man and woman them to subdue and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over every living thing that moveth to have dominion over it to conquer it to bring get into subjection we need God to subdue in our life we need some subduing power in our lives toward the things that that Hound us the things that hinder us the things that lead us away from God that we can take complete control over that that we can conquer it and bring it under subjection to the Holy Ghost I'm gonna get ahead of myself from next week but I was just thinking this morning I thought you know what if we would bring everything under subjection through the Holy Ghost the TV wouldn't say vile words your computer wouldn't look at dirty pictures why because you brought sub you brought under subjection and you subdued it under the power of the Holy Ghost in Philippians 3 Philippians 3 verse 20 if you're taking notes Christ here is the object of what the Believers expectation should be and he's speaking and he says our conversation is in heaven from whence we also look for our savior the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned unto his glorious body huh according to the works why whereby he is able even to what subdue all things unto himself so this verse this this phrase right here subdue all things it adds more detail to the picture of Oneness that God and Christ and you all one well some of you believe you're a child of God come on church I said God and Christ and you you're all one you're all made from the same mold why because he made you in his very image what he wanted you to [Applause] be subdue here means it's a it's a Hebrew Greek word h the it means to place in order to place in an orderly fashion it describes a scene of chaos it describes a a life uh that is disorganized it describes a life that is disarrayed and out of pattern out of sequence but when you take this word subdue right here in this verse it means that somebody has come in and somebody has come in and begin to rearrange the scattered pieces Jesus Christ has come into our lives and begin to rearrange your scattered pieces Jesus Christ can come into your life and rearrange your homes he can rearrange your marriage he can rearrange your children your children may get scattered they may go here they may go there but right here when it says Jesus subdues all things he's bringing the broken pieces back into perfect order we won't leave here out of order so brothers and sisters this lets us know that God's power God's power is more than sufficient his power is more than sufficient to create and maintain the creation from which he started in his Believers and we don't have to worry that God's going to run out of steam or run out of gas or going to give up on us we don't have to worry about that we don't have to worry that the world around us is falling apart FOX News tells you it is CNN tells you it is but God's got you in a perfect place in a perfect position in a perfect order to do exactly what he wants you to do you wasn't born in this last hour by chance no it's a blessing from God you say man I wish I'd have been back there when Paul was there I wish have been back there when when Jesus was there no you're living in the greatest hour you could live in you will see the Rapture of the church and the Holy Ghost come down and pick up his blood I believe it she's getting her life in order do realize that no matter how Grim it looks no matter how how destitute you may feel or how how your Earthly eyes look there is no battle there's no forces there's no sickness there's no Devils there's no demons there's no hell that can come upon you that God can't have dominion [Applause] over why is that because God can't undo his creation he can't undo do his creation and say uhoh my bride over here they don't deserve this so I'm going to just let Satan pour out everything he's got on them he can't do that God can't undo what he started and so for the believer we have an absolute we have an assurance that God will finish what he starts in our lives you say well my road is so Rocky I don't even know if God is here how many's ever been there we've all been there what is that it's called trials it's called being an overcomer it's called relying upon God and finding yourself in the word and standing upon on that word and believing that God is going to see you [Applause] through you see during this time between Genesis 1 and Revelations 21 there's a journey taking place you say we got the alpha we got the Omega the beginning and the end you just fill up a portion in between you've been a lot of the time on this Earth just a portion of time that you that you will be right down through there and during this journey we see that the Earth itself begins to get corrupted it begins to get polluted it begins to get broken it begins to get uh it might say out of kilter we might say why because the Earth begins to get filled with people and forces that work against God's purpose the Bible tells us we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities Powers rulers of the darkness rulers of the what the darkness not the light rulers of the darkness against spiritual wickedness in high places so let me take you on a little journey this morning the way the prophet saw it that's the way the prophet saw it he said if you notice in the creation the first thing that was created was the light he said you come down through the creation and the last thing that was created was what man and he said and woman was made after man and the first the last or the last thing was created was God's creation is mankind but when God made his first man you notice that he made him in the likeness of himself he was in the very image of God you see brothers and sisters God knew before the foundation of the world what he was looking for he knew what kind of Warrior it would take to survive in this last day he knew what kind of mentality you would have to have to be an overcomer in this last day he knew how strong you would have to be to make it to the end of this bride age he knew what he wanted you and I to be like he knew where he wanted you to work he knew who he wanted who he wanted you to marry he knew where he wanted you to live you say well my job my wife and my my home ain't nothing like I thought it said I said he knew I didn't say you followed that's exactly right that's why it's so important that we have the Holy Ghost when a young man a young woman begins to pray for a spouse they better have the Holy Ghost because if they don't have the Holy Ghost you don't know what you're going to get you better have a word from God and a and a holy ghost experience it says that's your bride that's your husband you live here you'll work there because you find yourself working in a place you don't belong or living where you don't belong your life will be a living hell God's creation is not out of [Music] order Lord submissive to the Holy Ghost God he says created man in his own image and his own likeness what kind of man did he create a spirit man that almost makes you want to shout he created a spirit man he said if you notice he made all the creation and created a spirit man that God could give what to Dominion thank you Lord Jesus you mean all we got to do is be Spirit-filled men and God will give us Dominion only if you got the spirit he can't give you power and authority without the Holy Ghost he can't trust you with that kind of power You' be killing people everywhere you would somebody cut you off on the road kill them Lord kill them take them off the Earth without the Holy Ghost that's the way we act oh you don't believe me he said we were Beast without the Holy Ghost the man was a beast without the Holy Ghost and he said but in making it up there he made man in his own image just like the Holy Ghost leads the spirit believer today he made his own image to lead the cattle and the Beast of the field he said in other words Adam was the first man in lower creations of God the first creation was God himself then out of God came the logos you know there's a lot of theories there's a lot of things going around and a lot of public schools are teaching a lot of out there stuff well I got some news for you here's the way it was I said this is the way it was he said out of God came that Loos which was the son of God out of that Loos was the word because in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us out of the loost came forth a man now listen he said' I got a beautiful picture in my mind now and I can take a little trip he said I want you to take a little trip with me I believe I've talked on it before and he said but I want you to see this he said we take a little trip and get our minds right he says let's go back a hundred million years before there ever was a star a moon or anything in the world see the prophet couldn't only see the future 100 when there was nothing he said but I I I want you to get on the banister uh uh the edge of the banister with me and look over here and see this happened he said there was a time when there was nothing here it was just forever and Eternity and and it was all forever and Eternity was God he was there in the beginning he said but now notice there's nothing there's just space there's no light there's no dark there's nothing it just seems nothing but in there is a great supernatural being Jehovah God and he said right in there he says he who's who covered all space of all places of all time he was the Everlasting from Everlasting from Everlasting he's the beginning of the creation he says that's God you can't see nothing you can't hear nothing there's not a move of an atom in the air not nothing not no air not nothing but yet God was there he says that was God can you imagine this vast space of Eternal Bliss quiet everybody just we quiet as quiet as you can get right now shut your eyes darkness no air no sound no light it's just there not a move of an Adam in the air not nothing he said but now take notice what I see in the beginning there was a little sacred light begin to form and he said it was like a little Halo or something he said you can only see it by your spiritual eyes here this little we begin to see this Through The Eyes of a supernatural looking we see a little white light forming out out there he said what was that it's the logos it's the anointed or the anointing he says brothers and sisters that logos that little white light was the same light that was overshadowed Jesus's life it was the same logos the same light that was with the children of Israel that carried them through the night through the desert it was the same light that fell on the on the day of Pentecost when they come down and spoke in cloven tongues it was the same light that falling on you today 100 million years in the making and you were on his mind now God gave birth to this son himself this son before there was even an Adam or heir to make an Adam you say I just don't know if I can believe that got a scripture for you John 17 John 17 Jesus getting ready to go into the garden of gethy you look it up and read it later but I'll tell you what it says Jesus there he speaks and he lifts up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son may be May glorify thee thou has given him Power Over All Flesh can we say Dominion he's given him dominion over All Flesh Jesus could control every situation in his realm that he should give eternal life to as many as thou Hast given him and this eternal life which they may know to be the true only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent I have glorified thee on Earth Jesus speaking I have glorified thee on Earth I have finished the work which thou has Gest me to do now listen here and now oh Father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was logos is spinning a hundred million years ago and God said there sets a bride in Elton Kentucky there's such a group of people that's going astray I need to send my son Jesus Loos enter [Applause] Jesus 100 million years Jesus con confirming the logos of the believer and he says God is unfolding himself down to human being he said watch what he did this little Halo comes we can't see nothing yet but by the eyes of Supernatural this Halo is standing there the Son of God the logos I can see him playing as a little child before the door of the Father God the Loos playing as a little child before the door father father my goodness the prophet could see that that here's this Robos play he knows each one of he knows what we go through from the time we're born he has to take on humanity and from the very beginning he I can see in PL as a child the logos and I can hear him say let there be light he said when he did the Adam burst and the sun came into existence and it world for a 100 million years so 100 million years of Darkness with you on his mind now we've got the Sun that just broke into existence when he said let there be light and he says it's sitting there for a 100 million years and it's forming clinkers and it's burning and it's forming like it is today still still breaking atoms he's made the sun he said and the first thing you know a big clinker fell off of it about the weight of Earth notice notice how he describes this about the weight of Earth just about like this Earth and it went and he said he lets it fall for a hundred million years the logos here now the Son of God is watching this the Sun the earth and the logos watching all this he said then another one flies off and it flew off Falls for millions of years then he stops it can you imagine as this big ball of Earth comes down and he stops IT and pauses it right in the middle of his universe and he said oh watch this little Halo Yonder now he said I can see it move out to this earth and get over top of it and he be to move it over here a little closer to the Sun and he said he lays it over there closer to the sun because it's nothing but a big ball of ice so there's for all you flat earthers out there that wants to say the Earth is flat the prophet said it's a big ball of ice ball that's round that's a spear it's a big ball of ice and he said when it begins to melt these big glaciers begin to melt they begin to cut through the Northlands and come down and when it did it cut out Kansas it cut out Texas and it went on down into the Gulf of Mexico and the first thing you know the whole thing was covered with [Music] water and sometimes we think our lives are out of of control Lord you say brother Brad why are you going into such great detail on this I'm going into great detail on this to show you this morning that God has a plan for your life God has a plan for this church God has a plan for each and every one of us brothers and sisters he said this little Halo there it can I can see it move down the Earth and over the top and it moves over by the Sun and Genesis one he said let's get to our Bible now the picture of the Bible Genesis one the world was without form and void and water upon the face of the deep and he said he separated the water brought up the hills and the lands dried it off vegetation and everything he made it he made the moon he set the boundaries of the sea so it could not pass he holds back the sea do you realize day after day hour after hour 24 hours a day seven days a week 365 days a year the ocean stops exactly where God says stop the river never go no further out of the banks than God says stop that's right your life cannot be out of control because when he gets out of control God will look at you and say stop come to your senses brothers and sisters young person listen God had you in his mind when all his creation was formed he was thinking of you he saw you as a child Paul he saw you growing up he saw the very fears that you would have as a little boy growing up and he's aware of all these he knows the Temptations we have in our life and in our mind this [Music] journey you know the amazing thing about it is in this journey God will lose not a single one when the children of Israel left there was not one hoof left behind so no matter how big your Mountain how wide your Valley how deep your River God will never lose a one you said I can't get over this you'll never lose in Christ but there was no man to teal the soul and he said God formed a Man Out of the Dust of the Earth can you imagine God stepping down there and pulling up a big old big mound of clay and the prophet said I can see him there and and put his Supernatural spirit in him he said I can see he was laying there I can see Adam standing there like a tree my favorite quote one of my favorite all times I can remember 25 30 years ago when brother Donnie preached that years ago at Dyersburg I think it was but he said they stood like a tree God had made him and he was dead as he could be and his toes were like Roots into the ground so here is Adam standing there now dead as could be and he said he's sticking there in the ground and God breathed yes what did he breathe into him he bre breathed the breath of life into Adam and he said Adam jumped and he came to himself and he began to move on and he said he began to move on and he began to move on brothers and sisters when God puts the spirit of life into you you can't sit still no more you have a work to do Adam when God breathed into him he went on and on and on because he had a work to do for God he had to tend to the Garden young people you got a work to do Church we've got a work to do we got a work to do for our young people can I say it that way our young people need us they need us more today than any young persons ever needed a holy ghost filled [Applause] Church you think you got Temptations when you were young you don't have a clue these young people go through more than we can ever imagine they have more Temptation more more internet more more at the fingertips than than than you can even shake a stick at it used to be that you had to fight to go get into trouble you had to work to go get into trouble no it ain't that way anymore brothers and sisters that Breath of Life came into Adam and Adam became everything at that moment that God ever wanted him to be not 100 million but for hundreds of millions of years in the making and he breathed into him and Adam was now in full control over the Garden of Eden Adam now has full dominion over his life no evil could control him he had no evil thoughts he had no fear he had no hatred he had no malice he had no jealousy he had no doubts about anything brothers and sisters none of that existed in his life why because his life was holy filled with the Holy Ghost of God as long as that spirit dwelt in there and there there was sitting back there he said in time and he said I can see eeve and all of her beauty there you see Adam was now in a domain he controlled it all how many of us would like to say Lord I'd like to have control holy ho ghost control of my life that's why we need the Holy Spirit and Adam now in complete control and he said there I could see Eve and her beauty and and they sat there and they didn't know what sin was one place the prophet said she was the perfect built woman he says she was the most beautiful woman that God ever put on the face of the Earth her blue eyes sparkling like the Blue Sky her long hair down her back sitting there in their innocence and they would look out there and he said Adam was there he was touching her flesh can you imagine Adam caressing Eve and touching her flesh and saying your Flesh of My Flesh and bone of my bone can you imagine how God how he wants to look down at his bride and he looks down his bride when you're filled with the Holy Ghost and he says you are Flesh of My Flesh and bone of my bone Lord he said they go walking arm and arm down through the garden and the winds blow and she says oh dear that wind and he said Adam said Peace and the wind stopped you talking about having a domain you talking about ruling a kingdom and he said the wind and he said they were just sitting there and she said no Adam you know how women are it was the same in the garden now if this tree was just sitting over here wouldn't it look much prettier you got it dear right where you want [Music] it ruling a domain are you with me amen and he said oh he plucked it up and placed it there so brothers and sisters the second Adam proved that it could be done it proved that it could be done he controlled all of nature Adam controlled all of nature the second Adam controlled all of nature it was given into his hands just like it was with Jesus Christ when Jesus Christ was here the storm was raging the boat was being tossed and he goes up and he puts his foot up on the bow and what does he say peace be still what did Adam do for Eve peace be still you say well that's in the garden that's that's back when Jesus was here well remember Brandon was lost up in the wilderness and the storm was raging what did he say storm move back you say well that stuff is all good and fine but what about me same thing that's right brother same thing we have to get to a place that we realize what God is doing in our lives that God is concerned about every single portion in your life I'll give you a little testimony I've only shared it with one other person I wasn't explaining to share it today but I just failed to put it in here Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever how many believe that there was a hunting trip where squirrels were spoken into existence you believe that there are times when things had to happen when eyes were formed and placed into the sockets this this last weekend in Arizona I met my first person that I know of that was healed in the meetings she was a little girl just a baby and her mama took her to the took her to the meetings brother Brandon was there and she had a huge a huge birth mark on the side of her face one of those I can't what are they called well we call them strawberries but there's a medical name out of nursing too long but a big old red maroon burgundy puffy spot on her face and neck and she just took her took her to brother Bram said would you pray that this would leave sister Robin I know brother Troy know her brother brother Josiah's wife brother Josiah Scott's wife he said the prophet prayed they took her home it didn't fall off immediately but over the next couple of days it began to change colors and it began to change shape and it began to change colors in so much that the mother almost thought about taking her to the doctor and say is this okay that she left there she stayed there and she began to hold on to what God had done in her life today there is no spot not a wrinkle not a blemish not a crevice not a not not a not a not an image of anything on her neck you say well that too is brother brand I'm met that person so I know it happened I saw the picture of her when she was a baby she showed it to me I saw the finished work of God so God can create God can heal sickness God can do all that and I say all this to tell you this testimony and you can say well you just getting super spiritual maybe I am maybe I need more spiritual maybe we all need more spiritual butin and I were hunting couple days well a couple weeks ago I was in my stand he was in his stand terrible day kind of like I said earlier it's a horrible trip it's a horrible hunting trip cold nothing moving not even a squirrel barking and I'm sitting in my stand he's down in the bottom in his stand and and I'm sitting there and all of a sudden I'm looking over here and all of a sudden I look back and there's two two do standing in front of me and I thought where in the world did they come from let me tell you when I say dead I mean it was dead out there these two do standing out in front of me and they begin to walk across just just just heading way to the other other Farm other side of the farm and all a sudden they both just stop and they turn and they begin to go the other way I thought what is crazy things doing deer don't do that deer don't do that when they pick a path they begin to go and they just keep on Sayer and on out of your sight generally right if you hunt you know what I'm talking about they turn and they begin to go down and they go right off into the bottom where Weston's at now let me tell you I didn't think a thing about it couple an hour later he says it was time to go he says I shot a d I said okay I go down there he said it was two of them Dad I said okay so we go looking and I I've always taught my boys when we when we shoot anything we always pray and we thank the Lord for it and give give praise for what God's done for us and a good successful hunt and so I just told Wes I said well praise the Lord he said well he sent me just what I asked for oh you talking about a chill hitting me I'm not talking about because it cold outside but I'm talking about I just watched two deer that wasn't standing in front of me two seconds before I turned my head and they're standing in the middle of the field and they begin to Walk This Way turn and they walk right down to him and he said God give me exactly what I asked for you say well they were in the woods all the time maybe they were maybe they weren't Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and [Applause] forever thank you he said because when Adam redeemed himself back to God the way he should be and have faith in God he will do it again too cuz it lays in hand Christ was that link that linked man together he said but then when sin came in as soon as they realized they had sinned it separated themselves from God he said they went in behind there and they had fig leaves on to make aprons and they realized that fig Leaf religion didn't work when it comes to meeting God no brothers and sisters things had changed now the garden f feels different now things were no longer in control their lives were now beginning to get into a place of chaos without the Holy Ghost without the spirit of God in there so now God is running through the garden and he's crying out Adam Adam where are thou where are they Adam and Adam made himself an apron and stood before him and and in order for God to get to Adam back to himself again so he could talk to him those fig leaves wasn't good enough God said something's got to die and God goes out and into the innocence of the Garden of Eden and grabs a lamb and God kills that lamb and skins it pulls the very hide off of it and throws it to Adam and Eve and says put this on can you imagine can you imagine the emptiness that Adam must have felt when God looked at him and said get out of the garden leave you no longer have a domain can you imagine when Adam steps across that threshold of the garden for the first time or the only time I should say and he steps across that threshold and fear hits him for the first time in his life an emotion a feeling he's never felt before and a fear begins to come upon him and it creates an anxiety and a panic in his life and he begins to look around maybe maybe even begins to say Eve Eve what have you done and maybe a little bit of anger and disappointment that he's never felt before as he looks at Eve why have you why have we gotten into this place that's exactly right let me ask you church with God being so good to us God freely given all that he is day after day why do we get oursel in a place right exactly right what is better than God what is better than being full of the Holy Ghost what is better than living for Christ what is better than living for others thank you Lord and fear begins to take him over the lion that once walked by his side now snars the lion that once ate vegetation now has fangs and Adam now looks like a meal huh things change quick don't it things can change real quick without the holy ghost things that didn't used to bother you they begin to grow fangs and Satan begins to snarl when you don't have the Holy Ghost that's right that's exactly but I'm thankful this morning brothers and sisters that there is a way back to God's domain this morning there's a way back to God's domain this morning that our lives can be in order that we can have forgiveness through the blood of Jesus Christ not through some bloody lambskins but through the actual blood that was shed on Calvary because of that blood we are called Sons and Daughters of God and as Sons and Daughters of God there is an adoption that takes place there is an adoption that takes place in your life and the prophet said when there's an adoption you're adopted it can't be changed when God adopts you you're right there you you been put into the body correctly in other words now you're in the family Lord now you're in the family of God and all that God is and all that God was and all that he poured into Christ is now poured into the church through the adoption of Jesus Christ and he says that Spirit OB bear Spirit within oursel that spirit will bear a witness of our spirit in other words there's a deep calling to the deep and our spirit on the inside God recognizes that spirit and he says my spirit and your spirit must come together and now you've got domain now you rule Satan now you've got domain Brothers and [Applause] Sisters Let's stand to our feet my goodness it's almost 1:00 y'all man death today I've got two or three more but we're going to we're going to close right here he says enforce with the exclamation point enforce then we have the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God give us for God has a law and his word is a law and God in this word made certain claims to the church to you and to I he said therefore we have a right to force these claims upon Satan that's exactly right brother sisters it's your God privilege god-given privilege your god-given right to force these claims upon Satan to force these claims upon Satan and say give it back that's what I'm talk about I'm talking about restoring a Dominion today give it back amen if you've come to a place in your life that Satan has beg to pull your joy he's pulled your Holy Ghost he's pulled your righteousness he's pulled your forgiveness he's pulled your love for others it happens remember the first quote I read he said it's just wandering out there somewhere this right here tells us you've got a right to put a claim on it and say Satan I want it back I don't know what you're going through this morning but if you've got something in your life that Satan has stole from you let's all bow our heads and as we begin to to pray this morning as with your eyes closed and heads bowed how many would say brother Brad Satan has stole something from me raise your hand raise your hand if God if Satan has stole something from you don't be ashamed don't be bashful now leave your hands up now I want you to open your eyes and look around look around at your brothers and sisters you see how Satan works we put a claim on today we put a claim on today Satan give back what you've taken from the Bride of Jesus Christ I'm taking back domain tell Satan that this morning everybody say it we're taking back domain this morning amen let's just bow our heads yes thank you Lord Jesus Heavenly Father you've seen today as the people has pulled and they've pulled on you this morning Lord and Lord no doubt I I believe with all my heart that you've delivered what they have need of you've seen the hands that went up you've seen the brothers and sisters that that notice each other and and the trials each one's different I don't need to know they don't need to know but Lord we know you know you know all about it you set the stars in order you set the moon in order the Sun the Earth there's nothing that can be out of order in your creation and life sometimes seems out of order to us but if we could just apply the Holy Ghost in our lives and allow you to come in we'll see the Greater Works that you do we will see the greater of the domain the res restoration of the domain of God in our lives if Adam could do it at the beginning the same logos the same holy spirit that was there and in the day of Pentecost it's here today and we have that same Authority the same uh uh Authority that we can place claims on what Satan's taken from us and we stand United this morning Lord We Stand United as a church and as a group of Believers holding on to your word today that says I can have back all things that Satan has stole from me as the song once said I'm going to the enemy's camp and I'm taking back what he stole from me we possess it it's ours there's a law that says we have to have it back that's right and Lord in your name we ask that it be a finished work thank you Lord we
