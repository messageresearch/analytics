[6:51] how you and I need to look at things
[6:53] amen
[6:55] Paul said in First Corinthians
[6:57] he says the preaching of the Cross is to
[6:59] them that perish foolishness
[7:02] but unto us which are saved it's the
[7:04] power of God

[7:08] church
[7:10] the church for some people it don't mean

[7:54] Jews a stumbling block and unto the
[7:56] Greek's foolishness but unto them that
[7:57] are called both Jews and Greeks Christ
[8:00] the power of God and the wisdom of God
[8:03] because the foolishness of God is wiser
[8:06] than men
[8:07] amen I see Moses coming on a mule don't
[8:10] you
[8:11] I see him coming in front of pharaoh
[8:13] amen and tell him Pharaoh Pharaoh it's
[8:18] time to live

[8:31] you and what army who do you represent
[8:33] almighty God
[8:36] you have no Army
[8:38] he didn't believe he's God isn't that
[8:40] right
[8:41] Moses said no it's just me and God
[8:44] that's it
[8:46] fear would like what
[8:50] he didn't take it seriously
[8:53] he thought it was foolish what
[8:54] foolishness didn't even read about him
[8:57] talking about Moses and and Sephora
[9:00] Sephora his wife's going down there hey
[9:03] where are you going Moses we're going

[9:30] appointed me to be the deliverer didn't
[9:33] even Moses mother say God has raised you
[9:35] up to be a deliverer God was going to
[9:37] use him to deliver Israel
[9:40] amen but God did it
[9:48] have to ask the Pentecostals he didn't
[9:50] have to ask godmission to ask everybody
[9:53] amen if he could send him a prophet or
[9:55] not God sin is a prophet and God come
[9:59] down and vindicate and proved him
[10:02] oh my wasn't nobody gonna stop him
[10:05] and he challenged every one of them 70
[10:07] preachers with phds and llds and
[10:10] everything else
[10:12] he could have him sitting in the
[10:14] congregation
[10:15] he'd say some more llds and DDS you have
[10:18] that just means you're that much further
[10:20] away from God
[10:23] good
[10:24] and had to sting don't you ever think
[10:27] that brother Branham didn't preach and
[10:28] people were it was stinging
[10:31] I would sting
[10:33] one time he got this he went and said
[10:36] let's take our Bibles to where Paul said
[10:37] I was not a disobedient to the heavenly
[10:40] vision
[10:41] when Paul would talk about his vision
[10:42] and of Christ and what he said to him
[10:44] because they knew that he was going to
[10:46] say and tell him about how that the
[10:48] angel came and told him don't drink or
[10:50] smoke or defile your body in any way
[10:52] forever work for you to do he's this
[10:54] whole bench or so left as soon as he
[10:56] mentions those things
[10:58] huh
[11:00] didn't anyone hear it
[11:03] and yet they claimed to love the Lord
[11:06] amen
[11:07] oh my all right let me finish this I
[11:10] want to go to Revelations 3 yet
[11:12] all right
[11:14] the foolishness of God is wiser than men
[11:16] and the weakness of God is stronger than
[11:18] men for you see you're calling better
[11:20] and how that that many wise men after
[11:21] the flesh not many mighty not many noble
[11:24] or called but God has chosen to foolish
[11:26] things of the world confound the wise
[11:29] when he picked David when he let little
[11:31] David go and defeat that Goliath that's
[11:34] what God was doing he was taking the
[11:37] foolish things even his brother thought
[11:39] that he was mischievous he just wanted
[11:41] to come and see the battle
[11:46] can I preach
[11:48] that's what a lot of people do a lot of
[11:50] people just come to see the battle you
[11:51] come to
[11:52] the church maybe to see the battle and
[11:54] see somebody else Rejoice or praise the
[11:56] Lord but I want you to know I didn't
[11:58] come to see the battle I come to defeat
[12:00] the enemy
[12:03] I'm in here to defeat the anime
[12:06] I'm not mischievous I'm not the sound
[12:08] wanting to see the battle I'm gonna get
[12:10] right up in the middle of it I'm gonna
[12:11] go out there and say that Goliath
[12:16] not just facing but I'm gonna take his
[12:18] hand and I'm gonna stand there on the
[12:20] hill and I'm sure all the armies a man
[12:22] of Israel that you can take his hand
[12:24] because when God is behind you who can
[12:27] be against you
[12:28] how many please we've got the promise of
[12:31] Romans 8 of God before us who can be
[12:33] against us
[12:35] what can separate you from the love of
[12:37] God tribulation persecute look to God I
[12:40] know nothing will ever separate you
[12:41] there's nothing that we can Rejoice more
[12:44] in knowing that God I didn't foreign
[12:52] whom he justified he is also already
[12:55] glorified
[12:57] if you believe it that you're a Son of
[13:01] God and you are Son of God and you
[13:02] believe in
[13:03] predestination the foreknowledge
[13:05] but if you're not
[13:07] if you're not saved I dare say
[13:10] it's the scariest thought that you ever
[13:12] thought
[13:14] can you imagine not being saved
[13:17] and knowing that people are ordained to
[13:20] life
[13:21] have their names already written
[13:24] God predestinate them to be saved
[13:27] he chosen before the foundation of the
[13:29] world
[13:30] because we all know for knowledge
[13:33] our predestination looks the
[13:35] foreknowledge
[13:36] for knowledge she looks to Destiny isn't
[13:38] it right
[13:39] amen
[13:41] so we pray God don't predestinate
[13:42] anything but what he knew what was
[13:44] happening already
[13:46] that he can say look
[13:48] you know I heard Rachel weeping for her
[13:50] children
[13:51] but I'm gonna send my angels to Joseph
[13:53] Mary and say go go get on out of here
[13:55] get on out of here
[13:57] because fear pharaoh and them uh herod's
[14:00] not going to kill Jesus he's not going
[14:02] to get him
[14:03] amen so you love him
[14:06] praise be to God
[14:09] amen well I think that's 40 minutes
[14:13] can I have another flower bar or another
[14:15] five
[14:17] ten if I want thank you brother Glenn
[14:19] praise be to God
[14:20] quick one quick one over in Revelations
[14:23] if you'll remember amen over in
[14:25] Revelations 3 it says you know uh well
[14:28] let's just read it
[14:33] I'm not too good at my memorization
[14:40] notice
[14:46] verse 17 it says because thou sayest
[14:51] I am rich
[14:52] and increase with Goods amen boy we can
[14:56] stop there for an hour how many of those
[14:58] men there is so much Goods out there
[15:00] have you ever seen so many Goods
[15:02] did you know that uh this can big
[15:04] containers fall off in the ocean and
[15:06] people cut into them and you know they
[15:07] lose containers out in the ocean full of
[15:09] stuff
[15:11] I mean and just there's just stuff
[15:14] everywhere isn't there
[15:16] the whole world is increased in with
[15:19] Goods
[15:20] it's just simply increase with Goods
[15:23] and they say they're rich they have
[15:26] increased in goods and they have need of
[15:29] nothing
[15:30] amen but notice how God looks at it
[15:33] isn't that right that's what they see in
[15:36] themselves that they're okay but when
[15:37] God looks at them he says Thou knows not
[15:40] that you're wretched you're miserable
[15:42] you're poor you're blind and you're
[15:45] naked
[15:47] how many blades that I I wrote down here
[15:50] let me see whether I wrote something
[15:51] about if you're not rich in him then you
[15:54] are poor
[15:57] there's only one true richest statement
[16:00] that is to be rich in Christ
[16:02] why because all these things will fade
[16:05] away but the riches of Christ is eternal
[16:10] oh my you can buy Chevy
[16:13] I bought me a nice Chevy I finally got
[16:15] to buy me a nice Chevy Hallelujah
[16:18] don't buy a parking lot and my wife says
[16:20] now you need to be looking for a nice
[16:21] doctor I like the color is it you know
[16:24] it didn't have the nice screen you know
[16:27] showed my backing up I want the backup
[16:29] you know and all that other stuff
[16:31] make a long story short it was in the
[16:34] months and all the paint's flaking off
[16:36] of my off of my hood so I'm driving
[16:39] around with flake
[16:40] flaky
[16:42] I got a flaky shabby
[16:46] nothing lasts I don't
[16:51] get years ago and it's all gone all
[16:53] right maybe that
[16:54] David hold that off the garbage
[16:57] believe yourself that's the one we did
[16:59] nothing
[17:04] you cared amen that you turn off that's
[17:06] what we Rejoice over
[17:08] things that are Eternal being rich in
[17:10] God that's what's important
[17:13] him and they saw themselves as rich and
[17:15] decreased with Goods but they didn't
[17:16] realize that they had put him on the
[17:18] outside of the door
[17:19] I mean that was the world put Christ on
[17:21] the outside of the door churches put him
[17:23] on the outside of the door
[17:26] oh let me preach let me tell you
[17:28] something when we look Through The Eyes
[17:29] Of God Amen the Bible I mean brother bam
[17:31] said you know they claim that they're
[17:33] making this world a better place to live
[17:35] in but in the eyes of God it's only a
[17:37] better place to sin in not all is it a
[17:39] better place to sit in
[17:42] but if Satan's actually eating amen this
[17:45] is the devil's heaven
[17:50] this is the devil's heaven
[17:54] we know that this is the best the
[17:56] devil's ever going to have it
[18:00] this is the best where all everything's
[18:02] legal they didn't want to please they
[18:04] don't want no law

[18:11] prevail there'll be all kinds of
[18:13] lawlessness go on
[18:15] hey man they don't want no law at all

[18:30] care one bit about the laws or whatever
[18:32] it's just their agenda

[18:38] of God this place is the devil's eating

[21:08] extra of why Christ speak the next next
[21:10] scripture I just seen it and I got that
[21:12] got to read it to you listen what it
[21:14] says God goes to church every day

[21:23] lives in church
[21:26] he lives in you
[21:31] Church you are a shirt you're the top
[21:37] of
[21:38] the greatest Revelations are deepest
[21:40] things that we could ever preach about
[21:42] is Christ in you the hope of glory the
[21:45] greatest thing we are is not
[21:46] understanding all the Mysteries and all
[21:48] of that the greatest thing we have is to
[21:50] possess him and to know that we are the
[21:53] Temple of almighty God and you don't
[21:55] have to wait to come to church to
[21:56] worship Him you ain't got no way you can
[21:58] do it when you're going home you'll be
[21:59] going on the job and you can waste
[22:01] praise him you're looking to have a
[22:03] church service Wherever You Are

[22:08] every well I don't care if he's behind
[22:10] the tree look better bro running around
[22:12] the tree I don't care if it's just pull
[22:13] that stuff up on that lawnmower hit that
[22:15] uh shut down cup blades off and go
[22:18] running around that mower
[22:20] why you say more

[22:24] place we all have our meditation
[22:28] you're laughing
[22:29] in the truth don't you love the mole I
[22:32] love the mo my wife loves America
[22:34] because that's where you can just kind
[22:35] of think about God and
[22:37] it's not too hard to keep the straight
[22:38] lines
[22:40] and when you think about God

[23:01] anointed by almighty God and you had to
[23:03] come in here
[23:04] to get the anointing of God

[23:15] I mean God does whatever he does he does
[23:18] through you how many believes it's
[23:19] important the way we look at each other
