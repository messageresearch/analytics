Mercy reached out amen God bless you you can be seated tonight see a couple visitors there bless you surprise amen it's good to see you all out tonight and I went through this evening I'm not I don't want to take a lot of your time but I announced it this morning at the Lord willing I wanna give this testimony of my wife's healing or her cancer and the purpose for something like this is all to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ because without him it would have would not have been possible amen so I want to give him all the all the glory for it but I want to thank you all for that I knew I don't know who else I know brother Paul was saying this morning to you and your wife you're saying and somebody else saying I don't know who it was but I enjoyed all the specials and the is the the singing the worship you know wherever the spirit of the Lord is their Liberty amen and so we're just glad that we can be a part of you amen so I'm just going to share some of this before we read the scripture that's all right and uh I hope it it means something to you I hope it'll maybe you know maybe we'll build somebody or somebody sick or have a need here maybe it'll build Faith uh for your healing because I believe that what God does for one he'll do for anybody amen so I think most of you probably know that my wife uh had cancer in 2020 August 6 of 2020 she was diagnosed with a tumor and uh uh so you know it's it you know it cancers that that c word that nobody wants to say and and nobody wants to believe it would ever come to your own family right and uh so uh she had told me that she had little uh some some blood in her stool which I'm not sure how long it was before she told me she's I guess like most of us be just kind of keep passing it on and say well it's going to be all right and and finally she told me so I said well go see your family doctor and of course they ordered a uh colonoscopy and so that was during the Cobra thing so you know of course you can't go in the office and all that well whatever I'll keep my thoughts to myself on that but but uh we had to drop her off and then go pick her up and so and uh we were a little bit late getting back to pick her up and and uh she's a you didn't know her she was a very quiet woman uh doesn't want to be in any kind of uh Spotlight at all and uh so we picked her up and uh you know got her the car and I got back over the driver's side and and uh so you know curious husband says you know so what did they say and uh she started crying and this and she's like just go go don't don't sit here in the car let's just get out of here somebody might see me you know and of course I knew what the answer was I knew what the audience she didn't have to say anything you know so we just left and uh well you know it it and it's it's strange how the Lord works I I about a week before that I preached at home and I titled it uh no weapon shall prosper against you and uh so we found that out on August the 6th and so you know of course it's just like a I I'm just going to speak to you as a man right is that okay just like a like a cloud comes on you you know like a heavy pressure like instantly you know it's like your life has changed you know and Satan had you know automatically builds up all this fear right as soon as you hear cancer you know Satan's about yours said well it's over you know it's over but I'm here to tell you it's not over just because it's cancer and I remember talking about Danny and he said well he said just because it's cancer doesn't mean it's the end of it and so you know so you start with all that process and uh uh you know they did the CAT scan to see if it had spread anywhere else which it hadn't praise the Lord and uh and uh so we pray for her in church laid out laid hands on and pray for her and and uh through all this process for the next couple weeks after that we were all you know meet the doctors and the Specialists and all that and that was about as for me about as bad as the cancer itself just the the pressure of dealing with those people and not knowing where to go and what route to take and and then on that on August 26th brother Danny preached the message at home uh title what what are the benefits and it just seemed like when he preached that that something something it kind of lifted that cloud a little bit I mean the reality was still there and we still had to deal with it you know but it's like the the oppression that I I guess I should say come over be kind of just kind of lifted you know and uh so we made all the you know met with all the Specialists and all these things and of course by that time we had settled what kind of treatment she was going to get and I'll never I always thought it was in because it just it you know as I said we couldn't really go in although her her chemo doctor um when we went there because we made the appointment they said well your husband cannot come in so I said well I'll sit in the car I'll FaceTime the doctor or I'll FaceTime you and you you know I can I can speak with him so she goes in the office and she tells him you know my husband's in the car you know by FaceTiming he said oh he said would you like him to come in she said well yes but the front desk said he can't he says I can take care of that so I said all right he's our doctor now so as long as we're short I went in and then uh when that was all over we went we went to the uh radiation doctor and uh and the same thing there they allowed me to come in with her for the unusual consultation and so we go in you know and everybody's wearing masks you know they're all and they put you on the doctor's offices are and you put your you know you got these hallways and office here and all of us here so they put us in put me and my wife in the office and we waited for the doctor and after a while the doctor and the nurse came and uh it wouldn't even come in the room they said at the doorway they put the chairs at the doorway in the hallway and talked to us I guess I shouldn't laugh but it's just I I feel left I told my wife is this do you feel like you got leprosy are we contagious or something about what in the world man I never saw such a fear you know I just I said this is crazy and uh but anyhow you know praise the Lord that is what it is you know and you kind of just go with the flow and and do do the best you can but then uh she started her treatments on September the 1st of 2020s he had the six six chemo treatments it was one every two weeks and they would send it home with the pump you know and she had that pump on for a couple days and then they would go back and take it off and then the the week in between was usually pretty good you know she felt pretty good but the week off the treatment itself was was pretty rough at times and uh because they gave her y'all medication for nauseous and uh she did she don't like bad occasions you know which I'm glad she don't but but so she didn't take that when she had the first chemo treatment and uh but that was the only time she didn't take she got so sick that night and uh so so from that from then on she would always take the other medication with that with the chemo treatment and so on and as long as she did that it wasn't too bad I mean she got weak you know of course I was pretty weak and all that but uh but uh she went through that every every two weeks up until November 11th uh it was the last treatment and uh and so on and uh you know and through through it all she stayed very strong she really never complained uh and you know sometimes you don't really know what actually sometimes you don't really know what you're made of until you go through through something some kind of pressure you know and then you find out what's in you and and sometimes your spouse them as well as you think you do you know until something happens you know and I found out that she's a pretty strong woman so praise the Lord for that but but she uh so after the uh after the the chemo um they they did say that because they wanted to shrink the tumor so they can take it out it'll be easier to take it out with less you know Scar and everything else and so so they kept saying you know we want to shrink it as much as possible and so after the chemo was done they they they did say because they scanned again you know all that and they said it it say it it responded very well to the treatment so I said praise the Lord and so you know from the beginning they never they never they never talked about the tumor disappearing it was all every time you asked well anything was done it was always we we want to shrink it as much as possible and so after the the chemo was done you know and they said it responded to well I my question to them was you know well why do we need to do radiation uh if you're going to do a surgery anyhow to cut it out let's just you know let's go right to the Source let's just cut it out and skip the radiation and well the answer was always the same we want to shrink it as much as possible of course you know I I'm thinking you know I you know everybody's lying some everybody else's Pockets you know and you know money is involved a lot of money I might say it is involved and I'm thinking you know I I don't know does she really need the radiation they're just you know making money whatever but you know one thing I learned that one thing I want to say if you if you have a spouse or you know somebody that's dealing with something like that just be a support just be there as your support yo and I I I made up my mind uh from the very beginning of us that you know it's it's her body uh I I think I know what I would do but again I don't really know until you go through it yourself but I said you know and I knew her I knew if the doctor recommends radiation she's she's going to do the radiation you know so I I never I never bucked your butt as a whatever you want honey well I'll just here to support you and do whatever you know and so they did the radiation and uh I had I think I oh yeah on the when when one day she was done with done with the chemo um even after they came or not right doctor used the words there's nothing there so that's why I was saying well that's whatever you think is there let's cut her just forget the radiation right and so well they went through the radiation five weeks of radiation uh five five days a week every day go over that radiation and uh so after after the every every report was always you know is was it responded so well or there's nothing there or there's this there's this you know and so uh so what we did the scan after the radiation it was kind of the same thing again you know and uh but the doctor wanted to surgeon I said man I just I do surgery just I'm already convinced there's nothing there right tiny little I don't know was and uh I remember calling brother Danny I said man I said I don't want to go to this surgery I mean it's they already said that nothing there and we believe the Lord anyhow I said oh why why go through that you know I didn't tell I I didn't tell her nothing about I just called Danny you know and he said well he said I'll tell you what he says let him do surgery let them testify again that there's nothing there all right you know whatever you recommend I'll I'll take your advice you know and so we did these schedules the surgery let me back up a little bit just you know which after she was diagnosed and she told me some of this later uh it's actually never from the beginning through the whole thing she never once asked the Lord why you know why her and the other thing she said was she says she told me one day she goes she says I'm glad it was it was me and not one of my sisters and I thought well that's more than I expected to hear out of out of hurry I didn't expect her to be strong but you know she's the older sister and so I guess she feels like she's protecting The Young Ones Still you know and she said she was glad it was her not not her her uh one of her sisters and so yeah so we plan for the surgery and all that and and her doctor was a young Venezuelan man very nice man a super just a a super positive personality and individual I mean you just kind of fell in love with him right off the bat but the only problem was you couldn't understand him he started speaking so fast and that in his in his accent that is like slowed down dog how can you harm to hear what you're saying you know but very positive all the time you know nothing negative ever and and uh so and one of our sister Sandy Klein I think some of you know her uh she works at the hospital as a scrub tech I think they call him and so when she found out is who had cancer the first thing she said was if she needs surgery um this is the doctor you want because he's done like thousands of them and is very good at it and and so we went with him we were very very happy and so you know of course the question of her questions were always is there was always two questions will I get sick I will I'll lose my hair you know as a for a woman that's a big thing will I get sick will I lose my hair and the answer was always just saying well you might get sick we don't know you may not you know you might lose your hair or you say we don't really think you will but you might lose some and she didn't lose quite a bit but most of the people in the church never knew because you know the ladies have long hair so they proof it up and do different things to it and most of the people never knew how much hair she lost but now she has a new crop of hair underneath she wouldn't want me to say this but underneath her gray hair there's some there's some young looking hair coming in so so uh you know praise Lord hope that would grow along she was she always kind of complained about her hair being so thin on the bottom I think this is probably know what you know what she's talking about because you know we don't cut it and so on so you know according to World standards it does not healthy hair right well I think God knows what he's doing is I'm not very worried about that part but she always gonna complain about that so maybe she'll get her a full thick hair now I don't know but uh but anyhow that was always her her questions and so and uh then when we did uh plan to do the surgery and uh uh you know she her the doctor said you'll probably have a colostomy I think that's what he called right a bag for like a better word colostomy so which is something nobody wants and so uh he said well you you might have one for a couple months two or three months or whatever and so we go over to the surgery course again I could go in the hospital I could go to the waiting room but I had to stay there I couldn't even go back to the prep room or nothing and but thankfully this sister Sandra was what made sure she was working at the hospital that day so that way she could go back you know be with her and send messages out to me and so on and so and so the last thing when the doctor come in uh one of the last things he said again he says when you wake up you'll probably have a bag she said okay whatever and so they did the surgery because I'm downstairs waiting you know when you're waiting on air it's forever no matter if it's not great alone you know it was a while but but uh uh you know and so finally finally um the doctor come down and let me see if I can just find he's all right praise the Lord I kind of lost my spot here but again I want to say that they all to the whole thing it was always we want to shrink it as much as possible and none of the doctors ever said we expect it to be gone but when it did the scans that was the words they used there's nothing there hallelujah hallelujah there is nothing there so they did the surgery in the document Dr cabani he said uh you know told me how to serve Joanne he says an ego and this is some of the word she said she was amazing says she is pristine pristine if I understand right means something never been touched right like brand new she's pristine it's just a little bitty scar there and said she didn't need the colostomy and uh he said his words to me where you can call me crazy if you want he said but he said when we got in there she looked so good he said I just put her back together [Applause] so I kind of I I kind of teased her I said honey I knew you were beautiful outside now I know you're beautiful inside you look so good inside so it's kind of a joke now almost just put in yeah so so uh is it I I just put her back together and uh and uh so I said well how much how much did you take out he wanted to take out somewhere the lymph nodes you know and uh and uh he didn't give like an exact measurement he said we took about this much out that's about a foot and a half that's a lot of colon to take out you know but he said we just wanted to make sure and so so this is what the this is this is what the scroll tag that was in with her because sister Sandy couldn't go in because she knew her right their friend so she couldn't go in as the script so the scrub tech that went in kept you know sending her messages and so after it was done this is what she wrote to Sister Sandy she said everything went perfect the tumor responded so well to treatment they were able to remove it robotic quickly and reconnect the bowel without any colostomy very small incisions when they opened the tissue that was removed because it took a little bit that was a little scar just to double check it uh when they open the tissue that was removed complete completely gone I told them there was a lot of prayer and they were also happy with the outcome as well and the scrub said it gave her chills when there was no tumor in the tissue it was unusual to look so good so I want to say praise the Lord I'll tell you when God does something he does it right and they didn't expect it we want to shrink it as much as possible they never said we expect it to be gone and you know but when God does it I I know I I kept telling the telling the the surgeon several times and says you know I said well we're just trusting the Lord we believe you know and he would never really you could tell you without really a religious man he wouldn't never really like yeah we we sure believe with you nothing he just kept kind of going to something else and talk about it you know very upbeat and positive but he would never acknowledge you know listen I don't care you know God will use a doctor God will use whatever he has to use but the end result was there was nothing there Hallelujah amen so I I want to thank the Lord tonight amen that that he have mercy on her and uh you know it was the prayers of the Saints I I believe with all my heart that that allowed this deal alright just holding on and you know what what do you do you know when you're in that situation you know is you know I you know you feel helpless but you you just keep praying you just and yeah I kept just kept saying Lord the word says I you know I sent my word I healed their disease greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world no because here's the thing we can lose yeah well I didn't know what the outcome would be right I mean you don't know I I had no word from the Lord that says there's not going to be a tumor there but but you hold on to the word and here here is the key in all of it when you know who you are it doesn't really matter what the outcome is Hallelujah that's why I say we can't lose you know if the Lord would have chose to take her home I'm still a winner she's still a winner because I'm going to meet her again on the other side well there is no sickness but you know what I will I I I do want to thank the Lord amen and to know that there is healing right now we don't have to wait for the Millennium party he didn't like that man told Brother Branham he said what in the world do we need Divine Healing for in the millennium we need it now right so I'm thankful that weekend that we have a God we know a God and then that is still the same yesterday the day and forever and you might say well that was just you know she went into the process and the treatments and and that's what did it no I I mean thank God for the doctors I'm glad there are doctors but Joe my faith is in the great position you know and and God will you know the prophet God said to God will heal with medicine he'll heal with singing you know uh uh he'll heal my love heal by his word he'll heal my Miracles Whatever It Is God is the Healer and so I would say you're here tonight no matter what you have a knee dog never put it off to somebody else and just say well that's for somebody else but not for me it is for you it is for all of us you know and so and that's that's why you know when this when this Cobra thing come around you know and people begin to fear people that claim to be Christians and become so fearful and you know I I don't mind you know it was like it's like the other c word cancer covert yes it's the other c word like cold but oh you know I said you heard somebody had called me like oh they're gonna die who told you that the devil told you that because listen listen we preach that Jesus Christ is the Healer right he's not just the Healer of a headache a cold heart disease cancer he's a Healer if it's cold but he's a Healer of covet so why do we want to fear the biggest thing is don't fear that's why when Jesus come along always he always said one of the first things he said to his disciples when they were in trouble fear not it is I and and that's what we try to remind the people of in our church when Colbert came and said look it's just a devil it's just another name I'm the Lord to heal us all that is Jesus so I I told the church God beat him to the punch he covered every sickness that could ever happen with a three-letter word oh I heal all your diseases so scientists can name it what they want to name it it doesn't matter what it is God is still the Healer and I think that's the main thing that we should keep our focus on is that no matter what the sickness is God is still the Healer amen you love the Lord let's stand together I'm going to read it if I I don't want I know it's Sunday afternoon but I I wanna put you just a little bit amen and I titled it I'm gonna tie the little sermon there is nothing there so what the doctor said when I applied a little bit to the spiritual part so let's bow our kids the word of prayer before we read the Bible Heavenly Father we come before you tonight Lord I just want to lift up my hand and say thank you Jesus thank you Lord for healing my wife Lord and thank you for every testimony here in this building tonight every testimony of your healing powers Lord and Lord not just your healing power for our body but Lord what you've done for our souls you've healed our souls you gave us salvation we want to say thank you Lord Jesus I pray tonight Lord you will bless the word now let me read a couple of verses may you be glorified in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen if you have your Bible let's turn to Luke chapter 5. praise the Lord [Music] [Applause] let me tell you something else if you are ideally if you if if you have a spouse or somebody going through that the best thing you can do and this is what this is what I learned to uh through through this one of the things I learned I guess is is uh just build a positive atmosphere just try to keep everything as positive as you can don't talk negative don't talk about the doctor's bills because I'll tell you you know I it was funny uh I I just I I felt like the Lord just told me before any treatment ever took place is don't ever don't never say nothing don't complain about the doctor's pills and I'd say I I told this brother Danny I said you know I said I think I think one thing to do that we should never complain about about about the money part and you go you know but Danny he don't miss nothing so he says so are you speaking from the experience hahaha I said no nothing we dealt with you know I just don't play a very that could play a very negative thing on your spouse because she would think or vice versa he would ever would think that well you know you're more worried about about the bills than her it's not a good thing so I was glad that the Lord uh kind of dropped that in my heart before this happened because I'm the kind of person that would have probably said something like that but thank the Lord for his Mercy you know amen because God takes care of all those things Luke Chapter 5 it came to pass first verse it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God he stood by uh to hear the word of God he stood by the leg of Janessa red and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were going out of them and were washing their Nets in other words they'd given up enter into one of the ships which was Simon's and prayed him that he would Thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship and were not when he had left speaking he said unto Simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a drawing what a positive statement and Simon answering said unto him Master we have toil all night and have taken nothing nevertheless at Thy word I will let down the net I went there and when they had this done they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net break God bless you you can be seated I'm gonna read two verses out of Jeremiah chapter 15. while you're seated I will bring Israel again to his habitation and he shall feed on Carmel and Bichon and his soul shall be satisfied about Mount Ephraim and Gilead in those days and in that time saith the Lord the iniquity shall be sought for and there shall be none and the sins of Judah and they shall not be found for I will pardon them whom I reserve in other words there is nothing there amen so that's why I wanted to kind of uh turn this over to the spiritual side of it and um just to kind of draw a little picture of the night amen because you know as a as a man when when uh when a man says your man could say something right and it doesn't mean it's so because we can say there's nothing there but there still could be something there right and so yo even like when even when the doctor says there's nothing there you know uh he's looking at the scans and he's looking at all that and he's trained for that and then you know as far as we know they know what they're talking about but but even though they said there's nothing there there could still be something there right and so but yet no no not casting down now because I'll be because I already believed I was like praise the lord it's over honey there is nothing there right but but man can say things and doesn't mean that is so but when God says there is nothing there you will find nothing amen that's why he says he said the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for and there shall be none and the sins of Judah and there shall not be found boy because God said I will pardon them right I will put their sins as far as the East is from the West there is nothing there so you know I would say denied amen that when when God forgives you of your sins it says there's nothing there listen I don't care what the devil says is there when God says it's not there it's not there When God says you are free from sin you are free from sin if you've come is from right away that is right right you've come and done what God told you to do there is nothing there amen amen so I'm gonna let's turn over to Psalms chapter 103 just for a little bit a few verses there or I can just read to you the Bible says Psalms 103 verse 1 does bless the Lord O my soul and all that's within me bless this Holy Name yo I was thinking about this and I thought you know and somehow we always want to be blessed but the scriptures has blessed the Lord O My Soul those bless the Lord was your life give your life then bless the Lord praise and worship Him bless the Lord O My Soul how do you bless him by surrendering to him is that right it is oh bless the Lord O my soul and all that's within me bless His holy name bless the Lord it says the twice O my soul and forget not all of his benefits Hallelujah he has benefits that are out of this world Amen forget not all of his benefits who forgive us all thine iniquity who heal us all thy diseases including coven Hallelujah and who forgive us all day in English who heal us all die diseases I believe we need to take the word at face value when Jesus when when the Bible says that he forgives all of our iniquity what is Iniquity in order to do good and not doing it right it's iniquity God forgives all of that if you recognize what you've done and you come to him for forgiveness is that right and so who forgives all your iniquities like I said this morning his the fountain is inexhaustible you can exhaust his healing His blessings his Joy he's full of joy amen oh what a wonderful God we serve tonight amen that he has more to give you than what we can probably handle Hallelujah bless the Lord O my soul and all it's within me how do you bless the Lord you do what he says to do and we always say Lord bless me but why don't we bless him how do we bless him brother Peter be blessing by Praise we praise him we surrender our life to him amen bless the Lord amen I know this is hard for us to realize that we can actually bless the Lord unless God is blessed by your presence God is blessed by your surrendering to him bless the Lord O My Soul you know you can say as I said before you can say that your sins are gone but if you ever come the way God has laid off for you to come it doesn't mean you're going just because you saved you're gone but when God says you're gone they are gone yeah but but listen in in this scripture I'm trying to hurry Luke chapter 5. I'm hurrying too much either I'm just getting older I don't know what it is Luke chapter five where we read the scripture there we have Peter and them all out there fishing and official nine couldn't fight couldn't catch nothing now Peter knew there was nothing there right I love this he knew there was nothing there he was a trained fisherman and anybody that knows about fishing or hunting or whatever it might be you know where the fish are you know what a deer are you know where it is and when you've toil all night you have taken nothing you are convincing your mind there are no fish there but here comes a fell along and says hey guys have you caught anything no no we've tiled all night and struggled in it's so depressing I know they're usually fish here and the moon is right the tide is right everything's right but there's nothing there and this stranger says he says cast it on the other side of the boat now yo think about it if you were in that boat you're probably thinking what difference does it make this side or that side because look I've been here all night and there's no fish there I don't care if I throw in decided mode on that side of all there are no fish but there was something about it that you know Peter Peter said nevertheless you know Peter's knowledge and understanding is what made him doubt and made him believe that there are no fish there right you're understanding your knowledge can be your biggest hindrance amen Peter's knowledge told him there are no fish there and he's convinced in his mind that there's nothing there [Music] now this is the opposite of what I testify right Peter was convinced there's nothing there but Jesus said throw down the net and Peter finds out all right whatever oh yeah I guess meant nothing to lose we've been throwing down all night we've taken nothing but nevertheless at your word you know I wonder how skeptic he really was playing that over I want to be really through it like a trained fisherman Army just kind of like okay whatever you know the human attitude you know the other way we do right okay whatever I'll throw it on the net again come on boys let's throw the net and lo and behold I said it shows to you that even sometimes in your in your skeptical conditions maybe even doubtful God can work miracles he'll do things sometimes and at times when you are not expecting it and there were I'm pretty sure they will not expecting fish remember when the net went down there amen they had so much that the net break Hallelujah why because God said there's something there Peter said that nothing there God said it is something there throw it on the net for a big catch Hallelujah hey man listen why what is it if God says there's fish there he can put them there might not have been a fish there all night yeah and probably wasn't no Peter or they would have called them they would have netted them right because there were trains on their public was no fish there but when Jesus said Put it Down for a great catch but at that moment there was a bunch of fish there why because Jesus said Put it Down for a great draw right put it down for a great catch and Jesus was not upset that if he knew there would be no fish there but he knew if he said that there was going to be fishtail by the time that net comes down oh listen I want to tell you tonight amen God will ask you to do things that just absolutely make no sense to your carnal mind but listen just do what he says just throw the net drop the net whatever he asks you to do say yes Lord it don't make any sense to me bro if that what you want me to do I'll do it right that's a real believer because if God said so he'll put the fish there amen Hallelujah you know there was a time in the Bible amen Elijah II Kings chapter six you remember the Serie dog was trying to catch him and uh they're surrounded the house where he was at and uh Elijah got a good night's sleep I guess the servant did too because he didn't know anybody was there yet next boy in the sermon gets up what's on the coffee pot that's we Americans would do you know and says oh it's a nice day you know maybe maybe he walked over the window he pulled back the chain and ah so you want to relax a little bit and drink my coffee on the balcony Heaven Isaiah and he pulls up the shading there they were the syrians have surrounded them and he goes the last Master yo what will we do right you remember the story it goes in there it gets Elijah your Elijah's probably still sleeping this master master the syrians all around us ah oh what did you say your hair's eye the syrians damn surrounded us ah don't worry guys I there's more with us and there's with them I can imagine you Haze eye hmm us one two one two one two Elijah what did you call him Elijah yo Elijah probably said they're too numerous to come okay here's our what are you talking about oh Hallelujah he said Lord open his eyes Amen in this case it was there there was Chariots of Fire horses all around that old Prophet brother random said around Elijah is it more with us than there are with them Hallelujah and When God says that you're losing interesting Elijah didn't have to see them to know they're there Hallelujah he knew they were there why because he knew that God was going to take care of him he knew God would protect him he knew that the Angels were there he didn't have to see them and you don't have to see Christ to know he's here the Bible says when there's two or three Gallery in my name I'll be in there I don't have to even see him tonight but I know he's here why because the word said he's here and God wants us to believe the word I know I came in the name of Jesus I hope at least one other person did right so that there's two here in the name of Jesus Christ then Christ himself is here because he said I'll be there I don't have to see him oh it would be nice to see the pillow fire it'd be nice to see him but as the bride of Christ you don't have to see him to know he's here oh my like they said the Brother Band the old Heidi or or he said about the how do you know that he loves you because he said so oh what a theological explanation right how do you know God loves you because he said so how you know Christ is here tonight cause he said so Hallelujah therefore our needs can be met tonight our healing can take place tonight because he promised I am with you even to the end of the world and that's why Elijah knew that they would be surrounded by those angels they knew they'd be there but the servant didn't know he had he had to see he was a little bit like Thomas you know I often wonder where was Thomas on that on that first yo where was he the disciples that got together and she you know there it is again where'd you get my name I'll be there missed the disciples were together here comes Jesus standing in the midst of them it says peace unto you might be paraphrasing a little bit but peace well somehow Thomas didn't get there he didn't he didn't get the Instagram message maybe he had his phone off or maybe his Badger was dead or I don't know what it was or maybe he was just depressed and said I go fishing I I don't know what he did but Thomas was not in church and when when it was over the ones that were there listen and you can't you can't be in a church in a meeting where Jesus is and not do something for you and when they left church they were enthused and they went and told Thomas the Lord met with us we saw him and you know this is the problem with people that sit on a church sorry this is the problems people are sitting on a church when they when you sit out of church and then something said that happened in in the church in the service or something the Lord that you know you're just you're already you're already at odds kind of right you already have something built up in your mind so Tom was like I don't I don't believe it I don't care what you guys say I won't believe it unless I see him myself another way you know if we are not the ones see it I'm not going to believe you you told me Christ yeah I don't I don't know I'm not gonna believe it I don't care that was Thomas not your pastor now but not him all right he's been delivered amen but Thomas he was known as I love the dog but uh I know it doesn't apply to you and it didn't apply to this Thomas following the next Sabbath Hallelujah I don't believe but you know what no matter how much time I say I don't believe it I have to see it I will not believe it no matter how much he said that the next time they assembled he was there oh there must have been a little something in there did come or yo they might have been right what they said about the service something there was something that he said I'm gonna be there next time you know the Lord is so gracious he knows how to meet everyone no matter what your circumstance no matter if you're in doubtful whatever frame of mind or whatever he knows how to resolve the issue and just as Jesus Christ is always faithful guess what the next step was when Thomas was there Jesus showed up and he said the same words he did the week before peace and he knew Thomas what they say Thomas thrust your hands on my side while he knew what because some people just have to see it right some people are made up in such a way they have to see it to believe it but listen we're not from Missouri show me yo that that statement ain't true anyhow show me and I'll believe it that's a lie many people have been shown and they still don't believe so that's not true oh what did the Bible say blessed our lady have not seen and yet believe I would love to be in the meetings of brother Bradham would you love the medium when you've loved to see the healing campaigns to see all those great things but how much greater what you have because you know what there's thousands of people that were in those meetings and saw those things and they're nowheres around today and they don't they don't even know that there is a message but you know there's a message Creator is it for you to have not seen those things yet you believe and the Bible says that some of them believed on their word listen listen let's just be honest there are some people that never may never see the supernatural in that magnitude no doubt we won't but God is still a supernatural God he's still he still works the Miracles but just because I don't see those things like you think we should sometimes I listen the Bible says I'm with you always even at the end that's my promise greater he that's in me to he that's in the world is that right so I don't have to see Yo the properly God made a statement he said he said if God would never do nothing else for you it you still will love him and believe him that's a Believer and Christ never if you never saw a supernatural even that God never healed you God never did anything for you you still serve him that's a real believer Hallelujah but oh let me say that I know how wonderful it is when you can see him do things when he does something for you listen when Christ does something for you it will mean more to you amen when those words are spoken there is nothing there just like sister meaty you remember there's no tuber there the doctor said there's no tumor there now that statement means a whole lot more to say to meter than it does to me Hallelujah that's why when you're safe from your sins and the Bible says you are forgiven of your sins if that is you personally it means more to you than anybody else and you cannot explain it to them but you know you know there's nothing there Hallelujah oh my Lord open his eyes have his eyes opened the hills were covered and Elijah walks out there amen he says who are you looking for is fellas oh we're looking for Elijah come here I'll show you about where he's at Elijah leading them to Elijah he got it right there into the camp right right down there to camp and daddy they opened their eyes and then he goes oh oh what shall we do were you that we kill them all no no it's all right just fix some bread give me something to eat oh there were no they found themselves you know we're ready to kill now ah don't worry about it we already defeated him just by what has happened right amen and they were defeated amen so amen so oh my what time is it hey man praise the Lord I would say but it's getting real quiet that means you're thinking I hope hope you're not sleeping I could be like the story Paul told before servers zombies preacher and if you you don't know anything about the obviously don't mean much but over half the congregation is sleeping by the time the service is over so he was preaching against him and a lot of them were sleeping so the preacher just decided to stop preaching and he just still didn't say nothing and one by one the head started coming up there was nothing to wake up wonder why he's in preaching so I guess I guess his preaching help them sleep [Laughter] hey man keep telling me you want to follow that's not the case tonight I hope I I don't I'm not putting you to sleep but I know we're human I know we feisty but I understand I've been there many times cross-eyed and the preacher looked like three people I couldn't hardly see it was just funny I'm thinking man I hope those cameras don't be I hope I'm not cross-eyed because I feel like I am so I understand you know I I've always said you know I don't I see somebody struggling with sleep out of my mind that they struggle these are struggling where I come from we just went to sleep there was no struggle we just sweeping our head down our knee we just went so you know that would bothering me if I saw you saw you but if you if I see you you're gonna cross eye and you're kind of you know and I can tell you're trying to stay away because it breaks the Lord at least you're fighting it's when you surrender that I get worried say oh shut up brother biologist not well praise the Lord amen so you you find sleep I understand I've been in your seat many times but you know the flesh is weak the spirit is willing amen your spirit feeds on things amen when maybe you maybe you don't really even feel like you're feeding on anything and then but your spirit is feeding on it amen so just do me a let's just you know press for a few minutes more kill the flesh not physically but you know overcome the flesh let me say that we overcome and and just say Lord what are you saying help that poor fellow up there okay amen amen so amen so Peters I thought it were I know there's no fish but I'm gonna do it anyhow you might feel like you're at the end of the road there's nothing you know where to go but you can say at your word Lord you told me that there's a message you told me there's Divine Healing you told me there's Victory I don't feel big I don't feel anything but at your word I'm gonna Proclaim victory Hallelujah confess with your mouth confess make a confession that you believe the word amen the problem of God said confess that you're saved whether you feel like it or not he said keep confessing it and he says after a while you'll believe it oh listen we need to rise above our feelings we need to rise above those things because there's many times let me just give you a little uh uh let me give you a little comfort and strength okay you are not always going to feel like a Christian they say well that don't help me brother Bill it should if you're if you're looking for this kind of life that's always on the Mountaintop and always everything's good you ain't for a rude awakening life is real and life is earnest but the grave is not its goal hallelujah amen you will not always feel like a Christian but just because you don't feel like it doesn't mean you are not a Christian amen feelings have nothing to do with it as long as you know that you did what God told you repent of your sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ your soul on it I don't care what the devil said oh you are just here no search I did what God told me to do I'm standing right here amen so don't rest your Christian walk on how you feel because if you do you're going to be disappointed probably every day come on Christian Say Amen probably going to reduce the point of every day because you will not always be on the mountain dog oh but remember that song the god of the mountain is still God of alley the god of the good times is still the god of the bad times you know that's one thing I found out through the cancer thing with my wife I said Yo God is still God it doesn't matter what comes goes it don't matter what the outcome is if the Lord choose to take her home amen he still got overall it really doesn't matter but I thank God today she's with me Hallelujah I thank God for what he's done but it's not based on what we feel what we see because what you see is very disappointing come on folks very disappointing even can I say this we are very disappointed even many times in one another right we think we know one another and then you know a brother or sister will do something like oh my goodness how could they do that they claim to be Christians and you know yeah you get disappointed is that right life is full of disappointments you see brother Bill I come to get encouraged I'm sorry I just feel at home you gotta it gets dangerous when the preacher feels at home but but yeah I I want to be a girl life is full of disappointments oh no I'm discouraged it is listen you might as well know reality and know that it is full of disappointments but those disappointments are nothing in light of the promise of God are nothing in the light of what God Said I have given you the victory Hallelujah disappointments come and go with the problems of God stays forever I'll be with you always even in you to the end of the world he had Believers and baptized shall be saved these are promises so we don't look at those things that happen that's just part of our life and this is part of our our the the moment of our character you must go through things the whole character in you you'll never have character about having everything is the life of ease and just flowed through no you gotta have opposition sometimes you gotta have something that will press against you and cause you to make hard decisions some of you know what we're talking about you got to go through it but when you come out the other side that's why I always say oh devil you're so dumb devil the devil sense all these things on you and all these troubles and all these trials every time you come out on the other side you're stronger than you were before so he's he's only working against himself oh that's why you know that song God will make this child a blessing though he sends me to my knees Hallelujah you might look at it as a child but why don't you we shouldn't look at our trials as a blessing I I know I know we don't but I know we're gonna get down our knees oh God send me a trial how many have ever prayed that he's honest but you know he ain't good exactly what all the rest of us but say I don't either you know there's some things in life you don't have to pray for Charles is one of them they are promised you know trials are promised to the believer so I don't have to pray Lord send the child it's going to come in the right time and it'll come in a way that you did not expect so we'll get the oh God send the trial I just want to prove the devil I'm a Christian nah we're not that foolish no no we wanted to sometimes I want to keep our mouth shut right yo I've thought about Joe think about it this is just being as a man now what was God thinking yo here you have a man according to the Bible is perfect job was perfect the Bible says in all his ways he ate evil he was perfect he offered sacrifices everything perfect Yo God had a man right where he wanted him and then he points enough to the devil you know if it was me if I was God I would hide him away right well I got one perfect now I'm gonna make sure I don't want to get a hold of him but not God says have you have you considered my servant job uh I wonder you know job I I don't know if Joe heard that conversation or not you consider myself I don't know if he did or not but if he would have heard it Joe would have probably says oh no Lord don't say that but I don't know if you heard or not have you considered my servant job you know what the answer was yeah I've considered him but there's a hedge around him I wonder how many times the devil consider you I wonder how many times you wanted to attack you but he could because there was a pillow fire around you Hallelujah you remember Daniel in the wise then think about it those lions were they were they would not feed them for days for the the reason of capital punishment of throwing somebody in there they want them to be hungry so when they throw a man in there he that would just tear them apart eat them up in no time and so you know here are these Lions they're hungry and you bring Daniel and the Bible said that they listen they hated Daniels or they were gentle they were like you know let them down easy so they don't get hurt you think they were worried about that when they were going to want to kill them you're worried about him getting hurt the Bible said they threw him in other words you know they just open like a like but say the hatch or whatever yo you pulled back the gate the lines in the Daniel and they know they know when that door opens up brother Paul they know food is coming Uber is at the door Hallelujah and that door opens up and all the lines like you know and they take Daniel they throw them in there and for whatever reason it never bothered him I believe when they threw Daniel I believe there was a fire a pillar of light that went before him and you know animals are scared of Fire right so when they saw this fire they just backed up and the Bible said they said there all night Daniel's in there all night and the Lions never come close to him oh that's Daniel but how many times did it happen for you that you don't even know yo Daniel probably I don't know maybe he didn't even know the pillar of fire was there I have no idea I don't know what he seen but you know perhaps he had a good night's rest I don't know I don't think you have a good night's rest in a dance like that or not but but you know maybe you had a good night's rest but I know one person that didn't that was the king he loved Daniel he really didn't want to do that but he was trapped into that right and so he couldn't sleep all night so and you know what people do when he can't sleep all night to get up early oh might as well get up I can't sleep so he goes out and you know it's amazing he goes out there and he said and he he says oh Daniel was your god listen to these words here's the key was your God whom you serve continually not once in a while the God who you serve continually was he able to keep you and he waited can you imagine the suspense he wanted to hear the voice of Daniel but I don't know if he expected to hear it or not but something drove him out there to say oh yo Daniel was your God able your God your God your God was he able to keep you who you served continually and Daniel says oh King live forever my God who I serve continually has kept me all night I don't know I don't I don't know that King ever danced in the spirit or not but he probably did then Glory I love to hear Daniel's voice amen what listen it kept Daniel all night one person ah so this shows you the difference between Believers and unbelievers so they brought Daniel out and so what did the king do he commanded that those that threw him in their family that they throw them in the den and you know what the Bible says that um obviously paraphrasing but like every bone was broken they were consumed before they hit the ground and I don't know how many family members it was but it was you know a numerous obviously you know the families the ones and their families so it was a number of people and these Lions devoured them all before they hit the ground when they couldn't get one man Hallelujah because that one man had a pillar of Fire that was protecting him oh I tell you it pays to be a believer it pays to believe just like the three Hebrew children he said we will not bow we will not bear we will not burn we will not bow down the God of this age and they had the furnace he said seven times hotter threw him in there but there was room for four people hallelujah oh let me tell you something that far the Bible says it the ones that that threw him in they even it couldn't yo they killed them it was so hot where was that Fourth Man he had to be there before he ever entered the furnace because the others parents and the three were thrown in and the King looked in there and he rubbed his eyes he thought he was seeing things this is bye he says hey he says I'm a little confused here didn't we throw people at three people in there that's what yes oh King we did we threw three of those Fanatics in there he said well I don't know you might have thrown three in there but I see four I see four and the fourth one looks like the son of God how did that King know what the Son of God looks like God must have revealed it to him the Fourth Man it looked like the Son of God oh listen I want to tell you tonight no matter where you go what you go through you just remember that Fourth Man will always be there you might not sin they might not have saw him amen but they knew he was there not only were they in there but they were loosed and they were walking around I want to know that all the fire of the enemy can do is lose your chains oh that the trials of Life can do to lose your chains that fire only set them free Hallelujah and then he said now I know there's no God but Jehovah hallelujah oh listen brothers and sisters hey man let me just go I'll go close I just didn't say when [Laughter] oh my God all right Hallelujah don't you love the Lord hey man let me just go to one one one point here if I can find a quick the Bible says he send his word he healed them and delivered them from their destructions all that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men Let Me Tell You Tonight listen you might be sick but I want to say God can put healing in your body just like you could put the fish there you can put the healing there all we had to do is believe it amen accepted a simple faith that says I believe that promise is for me hallelujah oh listen the Bible said in Psalms 103 11. Hallelujah I'm so glad amen there is a power that can divorce your sin the Bible says for as the heaven is high above the Earth is so great is his Mercy toward them yet fear him as far as the East is from the West so far has he removed our transgressions from us hallelujah oh listen that's why we can say there is nothing there God has removed our transgressions he's forgiveness of our sins we can say there is nothing there our past sins there is nothing there Hallelujah why because of calvary amen Hallelujah listen so many people hang on to their past I'm winding down but like 7 47 it takes a long time to come down amen we we want to we we hold on to our past we blame what we're going through now for the past Bill listen let me say tonight before we close if you if your life has been changed by that divine nature you cannot blame your past come on Church I don't care what your daddy was what your mommy was that is not you come on you might say my daddy was a renegade and he did this and he did he abused me and he did all this it's not there calorie is greater than your past are you with me Hallelujah well it's sickness whether it's your past was how you were treated as a young person you cannot hold on to those things Calvary it's greater than those things amen the power of the holy spirit will make tours disappear it will make cripples walk blind to see Hallelujah the death to hear you believe that God is still God tonight amen we have to believe what he says and we have to have a revelation that our sins are gone you ask me why I'm happy because my sins are gone Hallelujah and One More Story can I Lord never say good night all right remember to start the old man that had gotten saved and just full of the Holy Ghost he said I want to close my Bible and uh he sit around he read the Bible they rejoice and shout and carry on amen and so he had a he had a daughter I know I told this here before but I just feel to say it again amen because get a revelation so his daughter also claimed to be a Christian but she she got amongst the classical group the classical cushions the better you know Society listen if you're a Christian you're a Christian you're no better Society amen we don't need some high pollutants we just need somebody that believes I worked around today he says you know talk about nouns and pronouns he says he says frankly I don't know which is which I thought praise the Lord I don't either not that that justifies me I'm not justifying ignorance I wish I would know more but I I don't have to know what non or pronoun is but know that my sins are gone Hallelujah and to know that amen God sent me a message to say Bill you are free so this girl you know got into the classical grouping they wanted to get together she wanted to get give to all the ladies at church and uh you know how the sisters do and come together and they talk when they chatter and you know gets a little noisy sometimes right sisters and so and so uh she thought well you know I can't you know what I'm gonna do with Dad you know he's that old type of Believers you know he gets excited when he reads the Bible he shouts and prays with the Lord and ah you know we're Christians but we don't want that something wrong Sergio what am I going to do with that she said well so I said oh I I know what I'll do I'll fix him a place up in the attic it's quite a place to put your dad isn't it here Dad I'm gonna put your daddy as soon as you fix the place up there clear the other place and set him a place up there where you could sit down and then she thought you know I can't give him a Bible because if you read the Bible there if you like to see me up there as he does here yeah hello that's a lesson for uh no matter where you are you read the Bible the God Church wherever it has the same effect so he's so well I can't give him the Bible so she said I'll give him an old geography or whatever it was book and he can read that and I said so here Dad here you know the day finally came to hear the book you know I know and you know she made it sound like it was for his good you know yeah you know I know that you don't want to be around all these ladies so I fixed your plays in the attic and here's a geography book and you can you can read that while you sit up there okay no problem you know he didn't care right and so he comes up there and all the the sisters came over you know they started drinking their lemonade and just having a good old time and they're in the middle of all their discussions or whatever they're talking about you know and uh and uh all of a sudden the Raptors started shaking it was a noise from up top just going on and she thought what in the world happened to him you know he just carried on you know if you ever been on the second floor of a house and somebody gets excited or something falls on the floor you downstairs boom you know and so here he is you'll probably dance around up there in the Attic Lord hallelujah oh oh so embarrassed so she goes up there you know Dad Dad what's the matter he said oh I I'm just reading here and she says well that's not the Bible you're reading he said I know it I know it [Laughter] but listen brother and sister he had the Bible here he didn't have to have the Bible had the same results she he said I know it's not I know it's not but he said but you know what oh I like this I was reading in the Bible the other day that's why it pays to read the Bible because at the right time God will bring him back to you Hallelujah as I was reading in the Bible the other day where where it says that God put our sins in the sea of forgetfulness and he says you know what he said I was reading here in this book you gave me that they can't pass the bottom of the ocean and he said just think wherever they are they're still going and he got excited right oh listen he what he had a revelation that his sins were gone I think that's the revelation we need sometimes and then to realize that our sins are gone and it made him happy whether the attic the living room wherever he was whether he had the Bible or not it made him happy because he knew they were gone just think I was reading in the Bible the other day they can't find the bottom of the ocean wherever they are they're still going to God there is nothing there have you confessed your sins have you confessed your
