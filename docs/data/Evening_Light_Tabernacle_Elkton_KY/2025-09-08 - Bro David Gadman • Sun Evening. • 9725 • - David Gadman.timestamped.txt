[32:33] [Music]
[32:35] it seems like they don't change.
[32:39] When all seems impossible,
[32:42] don't let fear steal your faith. When
[32:47] doubt starts to win, just look into your
[32:52] heart.

[32:59] never part.
[33:02] There's a miracle
[33:05] coming. There's a mountain that is
[33:09] moving. There's a victory that will be
[33:14] won.
[33:17] No matter the problem, God knows how to
[33:23] solve them. When you believe,
[33:27] when you only believe,

[33:38] It may have been some time now that you
[33:42] prayed for so long. And you may have
[33:46] been on your knees
[33:49] fighting the enemy,
[33:52] but we have a maker who can do all
[33:57] things.
[33:59] It only takes a little faith and God
[34:03] will make a way.
[34:05] There's a miracle coming. There's a
[34:10] mountain that is moving. There's a
[34:14] victory that will be won.
[34:20] No matter the problem, God knows how to
[34:25] solve them. Then you believe
[34:29] when you only believe
[34:33] God still does.

[35:06] mountain that is moving. There's a
[35:10] victory that will be won.

[36:27] man who's come with great expectations.
[36:29] Amen. Let's stand. We're going to invite
[36:30] Brother David this evening to preach
[36:33] what the Lord's laid on his heart and
[36:34] listening to the master of the wind as
[36:35] he comes this evening.
[36:39] My boat of life
[36:42] sails on a troubled sea.
[36:47] Ever there's a wind in my sail.
[36:55] But I have a friend
[36:59] who watches over me
[37:03] when the breeze turns into a game.
[37:11] I know the master of the wind.
[37:20] I know the maker of the rain.
[37:27] He can calm the storm, make the sun to
[37:32] shine again.
[37:35] I know the master of the way.
[37:43] Sometimes I soar like an eagle in the
[37:48] sky.
[37:50] Among the peaks my soul can be found.
[37:57] But an unexpected
[38:00] storm
[38:01] may drive me from the heights.
[38:05] It may bring me low, but it'll never
[38:08] bring me down.
[38:12] For I know
[38:15] the master of the wind.
[38:19] I know the maker
[38:24] of the rain.
[38:29] Bless you.
[38:32] The sun is shine again.
[38:37] I know the master of the wind. Let's do
[38:41] that one more time, can we?
[38:43] Oh, I know the master of the wind.
[38:49] [Music]
[38:52] I know the
[38:55] [Music]
[39:02] [Music]
[39:03] Sun to shine again.
[39:08] You know the monster of the wind.
[39:13] Amen. You believe that tonight or this
[39:16] afternoon? You know the maker of the
[39:19] wind. Amen. I I I tell you what, I'm
[39:23] glad I know him tonight. Amen. If it
[39:25] wasn't for him, where would I be at?
[39:27] Amen. But I appreciate him. I tell you
[39:29] what, you hear them songs and
[39:30] everything, I just want to get excited,
[39:32] but I can't get, you know, right now to
[39:34] excited. But I tell you what, I
[39:36] appreciate the Lord. Amen. makes me I
[39:39] tell you what I can run with the best of
[39:41] them,
[39:42] &gt;&gt; shout with the best of them, dance with
[39:44] the best of them, but all that you know
[39:46] that long as you then that's good and
[39:49] that's fine in its place but I want to
[39:51] make sure that I know the master of the
[39:53] wind. Amen.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; If I know him. Amen. Brother Brimson,
[39:57] you can know you can know this Bible
[40:00] frontwards and backwards. You can know
[40:02] all the catechism. You can know
[40:04] everything and that's not life. But to
[40:07] know him is life. And that's what I
[40:10] want. I want to know him. Amen. You
[40:12] believe that? And I I just uh appreciate
[40:15] Brother Tom inviting us this weekend.
[40:17] And it's too bad he ain't here. Brother
[40:20] Brad and neither one. I seen Brother
[40:22] Brad up at uh Brother Joseph's uh what
[40:25] been
[40:26] &gt;&gt; couple weeks ago uh at Brother Joseph
[40:28] Hammond's uh a couple weeks ago. Brother
[40:30] Homer was up there preaching. Brother
[40:32] Joseph Hammond's uh uh anniversary 30
[40:36] years. And uh so we went up there. We
[40:38] wasn't preaching. We', you know, taken a
[40:40] rest since our surgery. And we went up
[40:41] there, hear brother Homer, our pastor.
[40:43] So had some good times and everything.
[40:46] And brother David told me said that it
[40:48] was brother Brad's first time of hearing
[40:50] brother Homer meeting Brother Homer. I
[40:51] said, "Well, once did you meet Brother
[40:53] Homer?" That's it. You know, that's all
[40:55] you had to say. God only made one of
[40:58] Brother Homer. Thank God. Amen. My wife
[41:02] tells me said, "Go anywhere and preach
[41:03] you want to. just never repeat what
[41:05] brother Homer says. See, he says,
[41:07] "Brother Homer can get by with it."
[41:09] Said, "You won't be able to." So, I
[41:12] understand. I understand. But I
[41:14] appreciate Brother Homer, my pastor.
[41:15] Like I said, we've been there uh 24
[41:18] years. Uh well, it be let's see the 9th
[41:20] of September, which is uh Tuesday, I
[41:23] think it is, or something like that. So,
[41:25] been with brother Homer. Well, we knew
[41:26] him back, you know, in Amarella and
[41:29] different places. You know, his wife,
[41:31] Sister Margie, is actually my mom's
[41:33] cousin. And so, you know, we're just
[41:34] kind of, Brother Homer always told me,
[41:36] he said, "Anything ever happened to
[41:38] Sister Margie, you're history."
[41:41] So, instead of praying for Brother
[41:42] Homer, I prayed for Sister Margie a
[41:44] whole lot.
[41:46] And when she was passing away, when she
[41:48] was there in a hospital, you know, just
[41:51] no couple days, you know, there she
[41:53] would gone. I was crying and somebody
[41:54] said, "Gary, her, you know, brother
[41:57] Gary's son, Dave ain't crying cuz this
[42:00] Marty's my mom's leaving. He's crying
[42:02] because, you know, he's gonna be
[42:03] history. So, you know how it is. They
[42:06] always give me a hard time. So, anyway,
[42:07] I tried to give them a hard time, too,
[42:10] you know. So, but I ain't going to say
[42:12] what I say about the rest of them, but
[42:14] you know, that's neither here nor there.
[42:16] But anyway, we appreciate having us and
[42:20] we appreciate being here. Appreciate
[42:22] good service this morning. So, we trust
[42:24] that God's got something for us again
[42:25] tonight. Amen. If you have your Bibles,
[42:27] turn with me to the book of Psalms,
[42:29] chapter 133. and we'll just look at this
[42:32] Psalms here coming from the book of
[42:34] Psalms this weekend. So, you just keep
[42:37] me in prayer, you know, since uh
[42:41] uh somebody had called me and been
[42:44] checking up on me. I preached for him
[42:47] several several times and he said, "No,
[42:49] Brother David, once you get to feeling
[42:51] better after you recover from your
[42:52] surgery, put me on your list first." So,
[42:55] I ain't going to tell him that I came
[42:56] here first, you know. So, Amen. But
[42:59] anyway, we appreciate, you know,
[43:00] different ones praying for us and
[43:02] everything, you know, just just, you
[43:05] know, we just appreciate that prayer
[43:07] means a whole lot. Abraham said one
[43:09] place he said, "I don't solicit your
[43:10] money, but I sure do solicit your
[43:12] prayers."
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Psalms 133:1, "Behold, how good
[43:17] and how pleasant it is
[43:20] for brethren to dwell together in unity.
[43:23] is like the precious ointment upon the
[43:26] beard that ran down upon the beard, even
[43:29] Aaron's
[43:31] that went down to the skirts of his
[43:33] garments as the do of Herman and as the
[43:36] do of the that descended upon the
[43:39] mountains of Zion. For there the Lord
[43:42] commanded the blessings, even life
[43:45] forever more.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. How many's got a
[43:48] need? Father, we just ask, oh God, that
[43:51] you just once again come, Lord, and be
[43:54] with us again this afternoon, Father.
[43:56] And Lord, we're just so
[43:59] needful of you this afternoon, Father,
[44:02] to morning service. It was history,
[44:04] Father, but Lord, we just we just want
[44:07] to ask you to stop by once again this
[44:10] afternoon, Lord, and visit with us, Lord
[44:12] Jesus.
[44:14] Lord, we just ask, Lord, that you'd help
[44:16] me, Father.
[44:18] Lord, I need your help more than I ever
[44:20] had, Lord. And Father, I pray, oh God,
[44:23] that you just be with us, oh God, as we
[44:25] endeavor to try to say something that
[44:27] would be a blessing to your people,
[44:29] Lord, this afternoon. I pray, Lord, you
[44:31] just help me, Father. Let me get myself
[44:34] out of the way, Father, and you speak to
[44:36] us, Lord, through your word, Lord. Maybe
[44:38] you already spoke through us, maybe
[44:40] through a song, Lord, that special,
[44:43] Lord, congregational, whatever it may
[44:45] be, Lord. We so thank you, Lord, for
[44:48] your
[44:49] goodness and your mercy to us, oh God.
[44:52] Thank you for allowing it to follow us,
[44:54] Lord, all of our days. Lord, we just
[44:56] ask, Lord, you continue to be with us,
[44:58] Lord. Help us, Father. You saw the
[45:00] hands. You know what was behind each and
[45:02] every hand. Pray Lord you just take care
[45:04] of each and every one. Lord, continue to
[45:06] touch Brother Tom. Lord, different ones.
[45:08] Brother Brad, different ones. Lord,
[45:10] there's been one sick at our church.
[45:12] Lord, different ones things going
[45:14] around. Father, it just seems like every
[45:16] time you turn around, Lord, got a
[45:18] brother's always texting me about
[45:20] different prayer requests. Seems like
[45:21] every time you turn around, Lord,
[45:23] there's somebody needs you, Lord. I
[45:26] pray, Lord, you just minister to your
[45:27] bride around the world, Lord, where they
[45:29] may be gathered at this afternoon, Lord.
[45:31] Just touch and heal, sanctify, Lord,
[45:34] fill all with the Holy Ghost, Lord. Save
[45:36] the lost, Lord. And Father, we be
[45:38] comforted to give you the glory and the
[45:39] praise for it all. For we ask these
[45:41] things in Jesus' name. Amen. and you may
[45:43] be seated.
[45:45] Try not to hold you too long this
[45:48] afternoon, but just uh like I said, we
[45:50] appreciate being here this weekend and
[45:53] just wish I had more strength than what
[45:55] I do. But you know, maybe I come back
[45:57] and
[46:00] one of these days and do it again. But
[46:03] you know, if we never meet again this
[46:04] side, we're going to meet you over
[46:06] there. Amen. That's the place I want to
[46:08] be. where brother Bram described it on
[46:10] that film Decath of Deep. He said table
[46:13] spread thousands of miles.
[46:16] You're sitting across from battlecard
[46:18] veterans.
[46:20] Amen. And the king comes out, wipes the
[46:23] tears from her eyes, saying, "Don't cry
[46:25] no more. It's all over."
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Enter into the joys of the Lord
[46:29] that's been prepared for you before the
[46:31] foundation of the world. That's the
[46:33] That's what I'm looking forward to. Just
[46:35] to hear me, Just to hear him say, "Well
[46:37] done. Well done.
[46:40] Amen. Excuse me. That's what I'm looking
[46:43] forward to.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. I like to talk a little bit, like
[46:47] I said, try not to hold you too long,
[46:49] but just talk a little bit on unity,
[46:52] our covenant with one another. Unity,
[46:56] our covenant with one another. And I was
[46:58] thinking, you know, we I want to be in
[47:02] unity. I never want to be divided.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Divided we fall.
[47:08] unified we stand together
[47:12] &gt;&gt; and you know not to be comical or
[47:14] anything but you know somebody you know
[47:16] and I don't know how y'all around here
[47:19] you know and I I I don't get try not to
[47:22] get too mixed up in them but you know
[47:24] cuz you you can I guess you can do
[47:26] anything too much brother Ram said you
[47:29] could talk too much
[47:31] you you could uh you could uh you could
[47:33] sing too much you could uh do a lot of
[47:36] things he even said You know, brother
[47:38] Luke was telling me one time, brother
[47:40] Luke Gibson, he told me, he said, he
[47:42] never did he didn't get me. Then he
[47:43] said, I read another quote where brother
[47:45] said, you can talk too much, you can
[47:47] sing too much, you can walk too much.
[47:50] And so he said, but he said, you never
[47:53] can pray enough. Amen. And prayer
[47:55] changes things. And I I want to be a man
[47:58] of prayer. And you know, and I was just
[48:00] thinking, you know, and like I said, I I
[48:02] don't know how you, but everybody around
[48:04] our area, all they're big football fans.
[48:08] Alabama,
[48:10] &gt;&gt; roll tide. I get so sick of that.
[48:17] So anyway, when I'm first moved to
[48:19] Alabama, somebody said, "You need to
[48:21] choose your team,
[48:24] Alabama or Auburn."
[48:27] I said, "LSU?"
[48:30] Boy, I like to got killed, you know. I
[48:33] like to got I like to got my head
[48:34] chopped off, you know. I had me a cap,
[48:37] LSU. My wife was working in the daycare
[48:41] and they asked me to stand out because
[48:42] one of the one of the ladies that uh
[48:44] they used to have to you know walk
[48:46] across the street and they parked their
[48:47] cars across the street and one one of
[48:49] the young girls kind of somebody some
[48:51] man tried I don't know if he threatened
[48:53] her or what but you know how it is
[48:54] sometimes spoke you know maybe said
[48:56] something out the way so the her
[48:58] director asked me to kind of stand so I
[49:00] stood out there one day had my LSU cap
[49:02] on water they didn't jump me but anyway
[49:06] you know they had the license plates You
[49:08] know, I don't know. They said, uh, this
[49:11] is a house divided. Had Alabama on one
[49:13] side, the license of plate, LA, Auburn
[49:15] on the other side, you know, but if we
[49:18] just all can be united together.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. To be unified, to love one
[49:24] another.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me just read you something. I
[49:27] was just looking it up and I knew
[49:29] Brother Brandham had said this and I
[49:31] thought, well, man, my this was real
[49:32] good. So, I'll just read this to you. It
[49:34] be all right. If it ain't, I'm going to
[49:36] read it anyhow. Amen.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Now, I think that there's
[49:41] one thing that that this nation has
[49:43] done." Now, I'm an American.
[49:47] He said, "God knows that there there's a
[49:52] many a brand I probably uh uh uh flew
[49:55] over their uh their graves in France and
[49:59] so forth. You you brothers in the last
[50:02] war and going in this and maybe a a son
[50:05] too shortly. And if if it come to the
[50:08] like uh colors tonight, I'd be happy to
[50:12] walk out and give my life freely like my
[50:17] brother has who started like
[50:20] uh all the foreign uh countries uh with
[50:24] their uh
[50:26] you know with their uh blood for their
[50:28] family, shed their blood for their
[50:30] liberty that we have tonight. But
[50:32] there's anything that I can think of
[50:34] that's got a stain on our flag is a way
[50:38] we treated the native or the Indian.
[50:40] That's right. We spend billions of
[50:43] dollars. Listen to this. I thought, my
[50:45] this is good. He said, "We spend
[50:47] billions of dollars to or send billions
[50:50] of dollars to Russia for them to shoot
[50:52] it back at us. We send it to Japan for
[50:55] them to uh uh fix a war to shoot back at
[50:59] us. and our American Indian laying out
[51:01] here starving to death. But that's not
[51:04] right. It's not right. And if there's
[51:06] nothing I could do about it, I wish we
[51:08] had more men in the in Congress. We're s
[51:12] with like sitting here. I I'd take a
[51:14] trip up there and find out about it, but
[51:18] we I I'm afraid it wouldn't uh work now.
[51:21] But I think that there's they're
[51:22] certainly being uh uh treated wrong.
[51:25] They certainly be treated wrong. And
[51:27] after all, this is their country. And we
[51:30] just came right in and pushed them out.
[51:32] And the reason we come in and push them
[51:34] out is because they were disunified.
[51:38] One group in fighting that among one
[51:41] another. And right now, listen, we're
[51:43] we're reaping what we sowed. We're
[51:45] getting disunified. See, stir up. All
[51:47] right. It may take it a long time, but
[51:50] it it comes home. Don't you ever worry.
[51:54] Don't you never worry. It comes home. We
[51:56] reap what we sow. He said, "We came
[51:57] out." He said, "The Indians were so what
[52:00] was it? Was it uh uh I think and and
[52:02] brother Daryl Ward, he tells it about
[52:04] Geronimo when there's only a few of them
[52:06] left." And and one of them Indians said
[52:09] to the other Indian, "They were two
[52:11] different tribe, but he said, "I hate
[52:12] you. I hate you." And Geronimo said,
[52:14] "Don't never do that. There's too few of
[52:16] us. What about us as a bride of Christ?
[52:20] We shouldn't hate one another. We should
[52:22] love one another. Though we may differ
[52:24] some ways on different ideas or
[52:26] different what you know it's it just the
[52:28] same thing. If I go to the store and I
[52:31] say I want my uh uh uh groceries put in
[52:33] a bag and you come and say they I want
[52:36] mine put in a sack. It's the same thing.
[52:38] Why dysfellowship over whether it's a I
[52:40] said a sack and you said a bag. It's the
[52:42] same thing.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; But we get so disunified. Brother said
[52:48] that's what that was Indians. He said
[52:50] but don't worry it'll come back on us.
[52:52] He said, "We're getting so disunified."
[52:55] And if you read, if you look at history,
[52:57] it always repeats itself. And look at it
[52:59] now. We're so divided
[53:02] &gt;&gt; as a nation.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; We're going to fall.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Hey, I believe it's just about over
[53:11] with. And I want to be unified.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Not only with him, but I want to be
[53:16] unifi. I want to love everybody. You
[53:18] say, "Well, this brother's got some." I
[53:19] want to pray for him. And I hope he does
[53:22] me the same way. Oh my. I was thinking
[53:25] and I was sharing it with brother. He he
[53:27] said he didn't see it, but after Trump
[53:29] became president,
[53:31] I like Trump as as a I think he's a good
[53:34] president, but he sure got a foul mouth.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; But let me say this in saying that, and
[53:40] I ain't trying to get on politics and
[53:41] stuff, and I know when you go to work,
[53:43] if you you working around, they said two
[53:45] things you don't want to talk about at
[53:48] work, it'll get you killed. That's
[53:49] politics and religion.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Said you don't want to talk about them
[53:54] at work. That'll get you killed. But
[53:56] then when Trump got voted in a few
[53:57] months, there hadn't been a a guy and I
[54:00] forget, I think he might have been a
[54:01] Catholic, but he was an archbishop. He
[54:03] stood up. He handed and they called
[54:05] Trump up there. They handed him a cross.
[54:11] And that archbishop said that Trump
[54:13] reminded him of Constantine.
[54:17] And if you look what brother Brim said
[54:18] about Constantine, Constantine he said,
[54:20] was never a Christian.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; So the only thing he ever did maybe was
[54:24] religious was paint a cross on a church.
[54:27] But what Constantine did, he brought
[54:29] church and state together.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Now look at it where we're living at. I
[54:33] I tell you what, every just about every
[54:36] religion loves Trump.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; I wonder if he's I don't know. I ain't
[54:40] saying he's the one, but I tell you
[54:42] what, brothers and sisters, we're close.
[54:44] We're very close. I want to be ready to
[54:46] go. Don't you? Brother Bram said in the
[54:50] scripture says, "Behold, how great and
[54:52] how pleasant it is." How great and how
[54:55] pleasant it is for brethren to dwell
[54:58] together in unity. The scripture even
[55:00] said that. How pleasant and how great it
[55:03] is for brethren to dwell in unity.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; To dwell in unity, to fellowship with
[55:12] one another, to love one another.
[55:15] You remember
[55:18] brother Bosworth
[55:20] came to brother Brownman and said,
[55:21] "Brother Brown, you know what fellowship
[55:23] is?"
[55:24] He said, "Well, I think so." I He said,
[55:27] "I'll tell you what it is." He said,
[55:29] "It's two men in one boat, one ship,
[55:34] going in the same direction." Ah,
[55:36] brothers and sisters, I want to be in
[55:38] one ship. I want to be in the same ship
[55:39] you are. That ship of Zion going in the
[55:43] same direction.
[55:45] Hallelujah. Now listen, and I looked up
[55:48] this. I thought it was real good about
[55:49] unity. What's it do for a church? It
[55:53] makes the church a positive example to
[55:55] the world
[55:58] and helps draw others to us.
[56:03] If we're all in one mind and one accord,
[56:05] look at them in the upper room in one
[56:07] mind and one accord.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I said it makes the church a
[56:11] positive example.
[56:14] Hey, sure. We're all different. That's
[56:18] what makes the world go around. How
[56:20] would you all like to be the same?
[56:23] Let me ask you a question. How would you
[56:24] all like to be like brother David Wade
[56:26] back there?
[56:29] But we all we're all different. God made
[56:31] us some short ones, some tall ones, some
[56:35] heavy ones, some skinny ones,
[56:39] some with hair, some with no hair.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Hey, but it's God's bouquet. He made
[56:45] yellow, black, and white. They're all
[56:47] precious in his sight.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; So, we need to stick together. It makes
[56:53] it said it makes the church a positive
[56:55] example to the world and helps draw
[56:58] others to us.
[57:01] Number two, it's that it helps us
[57:04] cooperate as a body of believers.
[57:07] If we're in unity, like I said, unity,
[57:10] our covenant with one another, it helps
[57:13] us cooperate as a body of believers as
[57:17] God minus to. He min to cooperate as a
[57:23] body of believers,
[57:26] &gt;&gt; giving us a foretaste of heaven.
[57:31] Hallelujah. I don't believe there's
[57:33] going to be one over in one corner, one
[57:34] other. They didn't believe it the way we
[57:36] did. They Oh, they're over there. No,
[57:37] they ain't going to be no clicks in
[57:39] heaven.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad for that. Amen. Ain't you
[57:43] know what, brother Bradom said? If
[57:44] somebody draws a circle and draws me out
[57:47] of it, I'll just draw a bigger circle
[57:48] and draw them back into it. Hey, I want
[57:51] to be like that. Amen. And number three,
[57:54] it said not only it helps not only does
[57:56] it make the church a positive example,
[57:58] it helps incorporate us as a body, but
[58:00] it renews and revalletizes
[58:04] the ministry because there is less
[58:07] tension
[58:09] to sap our energy.
[58:11] I thought that's good.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. It it it renews and revitalizes
[58:17] the ministry
[58:19] because there is less tension to sap our
[58:23] energy. I thought that's good.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandon said it like this.
[58:29] 1947 deity of Christ. See, if there ever
[58:32] was a time that Christians need one
[58:35] another, it's right now. So, we need
[58:38] you.
[58:40] I can't say like the scripture says I
[58:42] can't say it and says we're all part of
[58:44] that body. How we how we get into that
[58:46] body by one spirit. We're all baptized
[58:48] in that one body and my our body was a
[58:51] eye. Where would the hands be? Where
[58:53] would the hearing be?
[58:55] &gt;&gt; One can't say because I ain't a foot I
[58:57] ain't going to be no part of the body.
[58:59] But I every part has its place. You have
[59:01] your place tonight. What if it was just
[59:04] all brother uh all minister brother Brad
[59:06] and them wouldn't have nobody to preach
[59:08] to. But you as a congregation as lady,
[59:10] they got a body to preach to.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; We all can't be song leaders.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; We all can't be uh uh worship leaders.
[59:19] We all can't be deacons. We all can't be
[59:21] trustees. But what we can be, we can be
[59:23] unified, praying for one another, and
[59:26] praying. Say, "God, I I Brother Brad,
[59:29] brother uh uh uh Tom, they don't have no
[59:32] way of knowing what I have need of.
[59:34] Brother David, he comes this weekend. He
[59:36] don't have no way of knowing what I have
[59:37] need of, but God, you do."
[59:40] &gt;&gt; And if you can speak to him, to speak to
[59:42] me through me by your word, God, then
[59:44] I'll be satisfied.
[59:47] Amen.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; I've been a lot of places and I didn't
[59:49] know what was going on. And I'm glad to
[59:52] God that I didn't. But somebody come to
[59:54] me after service said, "Oh, brother
[59:55] David, you never know what you said.
[59:57] That was meant just for me." Or,
[59:58] "Brother De, even the pastor say,
[1:00:00] "Brother David, you don't know what's
[1:00:01] been going on around here."
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; But he did.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; But he did.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; And he said, "We need one another."
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to be a help. Like I said
[1:00:14] this morning, I don't want to be a
[1:00:16] hindrance.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 13:11
[1:00:23] says like this. Finally, brethren,
[1:00:27] farewell,
[1:00:30] be perfect.
[1:00:33] Be of good comfort,
[1:00:35] be of one mind,
[1:00:38] live in peace,
[1:00:40] and the God of love and peace shall be
[1:00:42] with you. My what what big words to
[1:00:46] obey. Finally, brethren, farewell. Be
[1:00:50] perfect.
[1:00:52] And we can only be perfect in him.
[1:00:56] Ain't another ain't one of us in here
[1:00:58] perfect tonight without him or being in
[1:01:01] him. We all got flaws.
[1:01:05] We all have been road down roads of
[1:01:07] disappointments. We'll disappoint one
[1:01:09] another. Amen.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Tomma disappoint you. Brother
[1:01:15] Brad disappoints you.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; I'll disappoint you.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother David, have you ever
[1:01:21] been disappointed by Brother Homer?"
[1:01:22] Yes. I'll be honest.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; I'm sure if you're honest tonight,
[1:01:27] you've been disappointed by Brother Tom.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Let's be honest. But we got to love one
[1:01:33] another. Pray for your p. Brother said,
[1:01:35] "Pray for your pastor."
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:39] Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect.
[1:01:43] Be of good comfort.
[1:01:46] Be of one mind.
[1:01:49] Live in peace.
[1:01:52] Scripture says, "Blessed are the
[1:01:54] peacemakers."
[1:01:57] Said, "Live in peace and the God of love
[1:02:00] and peace shall be with you."
[1:02:04] Hallelujah.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; I like that.
[1:02:10] Rebraham said that's how in demonology
[1:02:12] 1953
[1:02:14] he said how the all the denomin every
[1:02:17] one of them and they can't get along
[1:02:18] with one another
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; and we be just then and let's just put
[1:02:22] us over in the same boat sometimes we
[1:02:24] can't get along with it's a shame
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; sure we may disagree
[1:02:31] sure we may disagree with one another
[1:02:35] you say well what about this what about
[1:02:36] Jeffersonville what about
[1:02:38] Jeffersonville.
[1:02:39] I pray
[1:02:42] for brother Joseph. I pray for Hey, hey,
[1:02:44] brother Brennan was here. He asked you
[1:02:46] said, he said, "If any credit goes to my
[1:02:49] family, it's my wife." He said, "If
[1:02:50] you're going to do anything, pray for my
[1:02:52] family." Didn't I say that?
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Well, what about you?
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; When you want somebody to pray for you,
[1:02:58] when you want somebody to pray for your
[1:03:00] family, that's me. That's brother Top.
[1:03:02] That's everybody.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:07] good preacher,
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; but
[1:03:10] we get also been out of shape. Brother
[1:03:13] said one and that's how denominations
[1:03:15] got started cuz somebody seen it a
[1:03:17] little different,
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; And maybe it wasn't nothing that would
[1:03:20] put us in a out of a rapture, but we
[1:03:23] just seen it a little bit different
[1:03:26] and we get all been out of shape because
[1:03:28] this one brother says this and this one
[1:03:29] brother, well, if you believe the way I
[1:03:31] do, I'll have you on my platform. if I
[1:03:32] you or whatever.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; You know, we go different and I ain't
[1:03:37] trying and just like that. But unity,
[1:03:39] our covenant with one another. You go to
[1:03:41] different places and people want to ask
[1:03:43] you say, "Well, who you preach for?"
[1:03:47] I'm going to get to some just just be
[1:03:49] tight. Just hold still. Brother said
[1:03:51] like this demonology 1953. Some believe
[1:03:54] he's coming on a white horse. Some
[1:03:57] believes he's coming on a white cloud.
[1:03:59] And then churches begin to build on
[1:04:01] that. Cuz
[1:04:03] this one believes he's coming on white
[1:04:05] horse. This one believe he's coming on a
[1:04:06] white cloud. Brother Brown said, "What
[1:04:08] difference does it make as long as he
[1:04:09] comes?"
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; He said, "Break up and separate
[1:04:15] call." And you remember when brother
[1:04:17] Brown preached church order and he said
[1:04:20] it and and there was a brother that
[1:04:22] disagreed and he and and they started
[1:04:24] call brother said don't do that. He
[1:04:26] said, "That's how this brother believes
[1:04:28] that. That's his problem. That he'll
[1:04:30] have to deal with that."
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Did he not say that? You can get it on
[1:04:34] tape. He said that. I ain't gonna call
[1:04:36] the brother's name. You can get it on
[1:04:38] tape, but hey, he said that.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; But he he said, "But don't call them
[1:04:43] that."
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Said, "Love him." He said, "That's what
[1:04:46] they want to do."
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "But that's how and you we get
[1:04:51] in and and and we break up and separate,
[1:04:53] call one another buzzard and all that.
[1:04:55] Listen what he said. Your heart's not
[1:04:58] right with God.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Your heart not right with God. Now I'm s
[1:05:05] I just turned 65
[1:05:07] born in 1960
[1:05:10] and I grew up during a little bit of
[1:05:12] maybe was back back then. I lived down
[1:05:15] in the south Louisiana
[1:05:17] segregation
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; still bad.
[1:05:24] I mean, from Alabama, still kind of bad,
[1:05:28] you know, civil rights and all that.
[1:05:30] Hey, it's still kind of, you know,
[1:05:32] Martin Luther or Martin Luther King and
[1:05:35] all that. I said, sometimes it's it's
[1:05:37] still bad. And you got to even today,
[1:05:39] you got to watch what you say.
[1:05:43] Watch what you do. And and and not
[1:05:46] trying to get nothing wrong, but
[1:05:47] sometimes we want to stereotype
[1:05:50] people.
[1:05:52] Well, they did that because they're that
[1:05:56] culture. They are that race. Come on.
[1:05:58] We've been stereotyped and and and the
[1:06:01] brother Ram said the natural types are
[1:06:03] spiritual and sometimes we ain't
[1:06:05] careful. It bleeds over there and we
[1:06:06] want to stereotype people
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; and we we say well he he he preaches for
[1:06:12] him because he believe it the way he
[1:06:14] does or whatever. Hey, I'm just
[1:06:16] evangelist. Hey, I I I just can go
[1:06:19] anywhere I want to if if I feel led to.
[1:06:22] And if a person he said, "Well, that
[1:06:23] brother over there, he believes in 15
[1:06:25] gods. You going to go preach for him?"
[1:06:26] If he invites me, I'll go preach for
[1:06:28] him. I ain't go there perhaps to help
[1:06:31] the brother. Maybe maybe he or but I'm
[1:06:34] he invited me to help his congregation.
[1:06:36] And that's what I want to do.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; If I can say one word that helped
[1:06:40] somebody, maybe a way where a a person
[1:06:44] that's out of the fold can bring them
[1:06:45] back in the fold. I want to be uh
[1:06:47] willing to help them.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "But our heart's not right with
[1:06:53] God." He said, "We are brothers. We must
[1:06:56] stick by one another. We need one
[1:06:59] another."
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; But too many times we I remember one
[1:07:04] time when Jimmy Swagger
[1:07:06] done what he done.
[1:07:10] Now whether he did that, what I don't
[1:07:12] know. You know how it is sometimes,
[1:07:14] especially these days, got fake news.
[1:07:17] There's only something that's real true
[1:07:19] and that's the report I believe
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; and that's this.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know we got so much of this and
[1:07:26] that, but after Jimmy Swagger did what
[1:07:29] he did, I remember this guy I was
[1:07:31] working with and he was of Hispanic
[1:07:34] descent.
[1:07:36] He came around the corner. We was fixing
[1:07:38] to go into the cafeteria, you know, get
[1:07:40] something to eat. He came around the
[1:07:42] corner. He go cried, "I've sinned. I've
[1:07:45] sinned."
[1:07:46] Like, you know how Jimmy Swagger, I
[1:07:49] didn't see it, but that's how they
[1:07:52] portrayed him. You know how he was doing
[1:07:53] on television said, "I said, look at
[1:07:56] you. All you preachers are just the
[1:07:58] same."
[1:08:02] I said, "You know what? Yesterday I was
[1:08:05] reading,
[1:08:06] and this was true. This is what I told
[1:08:08] him, and this happened for real. I said,
[1:08:10] "Yesterday, I was reading in a paper
[1:08:13] where this woman got molested
[1:08:16] and it was a Hispanic guy that did it."
[1:08:18] I said, "All you Hispanics are alike."
[1:08:21] He said, "Oh, oh, wait a minute. Wait."
[1:08:23] I said, "See, all of us preachers ain't
[1:08:25] alike." I said, "There's some true ones
[1:08:27] and and there's some there's some bad
[1:08:29] ones."
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I said, "But hey, uh, but we got
[1:08:32] to stick together. We got to love one
[1:08:34] another. We got to pray for one another.
[1:08:41] There's a book that somebody told me
[1:08:43] about
[1:08:45] and so I went to the bookstore and they
[1:08:46] didn't have it, the religious bookstore
[1:08:48] back home. So I ordered it and they got
[1:08:50] several different series of it. This one
[1:08:54] is called The Light and the Glory. Now
[1:08:56] I'm reading on it cuz I always like to
[1:08:58] read. Sometimes it's kind of hard to
[1:09:00] since you get married and stuff, you
[1:09:02] know, sometimes you got different
[1:09:03] obligations around the house. But when I
[1:09:04] was little, wasn't before I got married,
[1:09:06] my my kids like to read. My my my my my
[1:09:10] my my grandkids like to read. My
[1:09:13] grandson, my oldest grandson, he's 16
[1:09:16] years old, and my daughter homeschooled
[1:09:18] him. She taught him how to read when he
[1:09:19] was four years old, could pick up that
[1:09:21] Bible and read just just as good as I
[1:09:23] can. Maybe better. In fact, he loves to
[1:09:26] read. He told me he told me the other
[1:09:28] day, I forget when this happened, but he
[1:09:30] said, "Paulpa, you know what?" He I
[1:09:33] because how many ever read the Fox book
[1:09:35] of mortars?
[1:09:37] I mean one two ain't many. I mean it's a
[1:09:40] hard I've never read it myself. I looked
[1:09:42] it's hard book.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; You know what my grandson told me? 16
[1:09:46] years old. He said papa the other day I
[1:09:48] was kind of and I this could have been
[1:09:49] last two years ago. I don't know but he
[1:09:51] said papa I was kind of bored around the
[1:09:53] house.
[1:09:55] He works at Chick-fil-A when he don't
[1:09:57] have school or nothing but he said I'm
[1:09:58] kind of was kind of bored around the
[1:10:00] house. I said well what did you do? He
[1:10:01] said, "I picked up that Fox book of
[1:10:03] mortars and I read it all the way
[1:10:04] through."
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; I said, "Really?
[1:10:10] That shocked me. I hadn't even read it."
[1:10:13] And he said, "Paulpaw, I can tell you a
[1:10:15] little bit about it." He said, "But some
[1:10:17] of the stuff I won't tell you cuz it's
[1:10:18] gory."
[1:10:20] He said, "But there's a couple
[1:10:21] emperors." He said, "One emperor," and I
[1:10:23] forgot the name of him, said he was
[1:10:24] really bad. I mean, he could he could
[1:10:26] read that. He's that good. He's that
[1:10:28] smart. But I got this book called The
[1:10:30] Light and the Glory. And it began to
[1:10:32] tell about how America got founded. And
[1:10:34] I didn't really know this, but Columbus,
[1:10:37] he had several failures.
[1:10:39] And I think it was clean Queen Elizabeth
[1:10:41] didn't even want to support him. But
[1:10:44] finally, he got her to support him and
[1:10:46] everything. And my it just and many
[1:10:48] tempted failures coming across here to
[1:10:50] find a new that they call it the
[1:10:52] promised land. and and and to find the
[1:10:55] this new land and my and and and and
[1:10:57] many attempts and many failures. And
[1:11:00] then when they started getting over here
[1:11:01] and coming back, many discouragements,
[1:11:04] many people turned back. There was
[1:11:05] people that died, but hundreds people
[1:11:08] that died coming over here to get away
[1:11:11] for from bondage and come over here for
[1:11:13] religious purposes, for religious
[1:11:15] freedom.
[1:11:17] I I I didn't know that actually. I I
[1:11:20] though I like studying history, but I
[1:11:21] didn't know that it had come that that
[1:11:23] far and all that and how when they
[1:11:26] finally got there and there were several
[1:11:27] people, the Puritans, how they got
[1:11:29] started and the Quakers and the Puritans
[1:11:31] were supposed to be real pure, but I
[1:11:32] think the Quakers were more pure and
[1:11:34] more holy than the Puritans. And even
[1:11:36] going to sleep in church, let me tell
[1:11:38] you this. They would put a feather if a
[1:11:40] sister would go to sleep or a lady would
[1:11:42] go to sleep, they stick a feather under
[1:11:44] her nose and tickle her nose, had big
[1:11:46] old long stick. And if a man or
[1:11:48] something they had a little stick and
[1:11:49] would real long and had a little like a
[1:11:51] little uh uh uh nail or something would
[1:11:54] like a a beasting
[1:11:58] that'll keep you awake.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't want to go to sleep. But in
[1:12:03] this all this they begin to tell how
[1:12:05] they was unified when they first came
[1:12:07] over. You know you see what brother
[1:12:08] said. We drove off the American native
[1:12:10] and all that but they were so unified
[1:12:12] then said begin to low. He said, "We're
[1:12:14] so divided, especially when it became
[1:12:16] the Vietnam War and all that. A war that
[1:12:18] should never been fought. A war that
[1:12:20] went too long and some of our veterans
[1:12:22] that came back after that war, we
[1:12:23] treated them awful."
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Thank God for some of y'all who I don't
[1:12:28] know who here maybe been in the army but
[1:12:30] wasn't fought in the war or did that.
[1:12:32] Hey, thank God for you.
[1:12:35] That's why we can stand here tonight and
[1:12:37] preach the dictates of our heart because
[1:12:39] of men like you that went and fought for
[1:12:42] our freedom.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; But he said we're so divided. Now
[1:12:47] listen, and this is a quote out of this
[1:12:49] book. He said, "We love God and we're
[1:12:53] covenant to obey him or else we wouldn't
[1:12:56] be trying to serve him.
[1:12:58] But we're not living out our covenant
[1:13:00] with one another."
[1:13:02] The scripture says, "Love the Lord with
[1:13:04] all your heart and your neighbor as
[1:13:06] yourself."
[1:13:08] The two steps of faith in the Christian
[1:13:10] walk. The second step is a way in a way
[1:13:14] requires more faith because you must
[1:13:16] learn to trust a perfect God
[1:13:21] operating in and through imperfect
[1:13:23] vessels.
[1:13:28] Brother Bram said,
[1:13:31] "God has a lot to deal with when it
[1:13:34] comes to another human being trusting
[1:13:37] another human being."
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; So sometimes people has played us false,
[1:13:44] lied to us,
[1:13:46] and it's sometimes kind of hard to trust
[1:13:49] another human being,
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; another mortal.
[1:13:53] He said, "We must do this armed only
[1:13:57] with the assurance that it is God's will
[1:13:59] that the other vessels hearts are also
[1:14:02] turned towards his will and that they
[1:14:04] too are aware of their being called to
[1:14:08] serve him together."
[1:14:11] I like this. The second step also calls
[1:14:15] one to yield to their local part of the
[1:14:17] body of Christ
[1:14:20] and to dedicate oneself to that
[1:14:24] congregation and its work.
[1:14:28] I like that. You're called to a certain
[1:14:31] body.
[1:14:32] You're to dedicate yourself to that body
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; and that local congregation
[1:14:38] and its work. Listen,
[1:14:42] God permits pressures to befall the body
[1:14:45] of Christ to increase in commitment to
[1:14:49] one another
[1:14:51] as well as commitment to God.
[1:14:56] I tell you what, since I've been going
[1:14:58] through my illness, like I said, God
[1:15:01] touched me, but it's made myself commit
[1:15:03] to him a little bit more.
[1:15:05] Not that I was afraid to die or
[1:15:07] anything, but hey, there's things,
[1:15:09] brother David. Hey, there's things that
[1:15:12] ain't don't mean as much as I used to
[1:15:15] mean.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; But there's things that matters a whole
[1:15:20] lot more. And that my walk with him
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; is perfect.
[1:15:27] He said he he permits pressures. Brother
[1:15:30] Bram said he allows the church to go
[1:15:31] through tension. said tension was good
[1:15:34] for a church.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you don't understand it, but
[1:15:37] he said it was.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; I'm just saying what he said.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "God permits pressures to be
[1:15:44] part of the body of Christ to increase
[1:15:46] in a commitment to one another as well
[1:15:47] as a commitment to God. A house divided
[1:15:50] against itself shall not stand." You
[1:15:52] cannot be a family
[1:15:54] centered in Christ without being
[1:15:56] committed to some body of fellow
[1:15:58] Christians to belong to. Then brother
[1:16:01] Brown teach us that
[1:16:03] huh we're find us a church home where we
[1:16:05] can support it with our tithes and our
[1:16:07] offerings.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Said you cannot be a body committed to
[1:16:12] some body of fellow Christians. He said
[1:16:15] to belong to Christ is to belong to one
[1:16:17] another. You need one another in order
[1:16:19] to fulfill Christ's order. Independence
[1:16:21] is a nightmare because God did not
[1:16:23] intend man to live alone. God does his
[1:16:27] work of his work of maturing Christians
[1:16:30] primarily through other Christians. The
[1:16:33] process of maturing cannot be
[1:16:34] accomplished alone. A independent person
[1:16:37] will do whatever it is right. Whatever
[1:16:40] is right in their own eyes as judge
[1:16:43] judges say independence from the body
[1:16:45] means run.
[1:16:48] I thought my that was good. That was
[1:16:51] real good. We got to be committed to one
[1:16:53] another. committed to a local body. Let
[1:16:57] me say like this. God, brother Ram said,
[1:16:59] sometimes it's me using my faith to help
[1:17:02] somebody. And sometimes we got to use
[1:17:05] what we can to help. Maybe not only our
[1:17:08] faith, but maybe our our our our
[1:17:11] mental or our physical being to help
[1:17:13] somebody else.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; There was four lepers one or four men
[1:17:21] one time carrying a lame man.
[1:17:23] And I knew there was a song about it.
[1:17:25] Let me Can I just read it to you? I I
[1:17:28] ain't going to try to hold you too long,
[1:17:29] but I thought, my this is this was real
[1:17:31] good.
[1:17:33] I ain't going to tell you the name of
[1:17:34] it, but you might have heard it before
[1:17:36] if you have discounted my ignorance. One
[1:17:39] day, four men brought it. And sometimes
[1:17:40] we got to help one another. See, these
[1:17:43] four men that were carrying this one
[1:17:44] lame man on a pallet, they couldn't get
[1:17:47] that lame man couldn't carry himself to
[1:17:49] Jesus. So what they did, they helped
[1:17:51] them. Sometimes some of us we might not
[1:17:54] can get to Jesus by oursel and we can
[1:17:57] help one another.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; One day four men brought a man
[1:18:03] to Jesus.
[1:18:06] Still and lifeless he lay upon his bed.
[1:18:09] He had not moved since he was just a
[1:18:10] baby. Still he forgot to be still he
[1:18:14] longed to become a normal man. Now, we
[1:18:16] don't know much much about the men that
[1:18:19] carried the corners of his tattered bed
[1:18:22] that day. But if we may create an
[1:18:24] illustration, we'll see what these men
[1:18:26] might have said.
[1:18:30] Suppose the first man said, "I hate to
[1:18:32] doubt it, for Jesus touched my eyes when
[1:18:35] I was blind. He made me see, and there's
[1:18:37] no doubt about it, but this man's needs
[1:18:39] are much more serious than mine."
[1:18:44] Sometimes we feel like that but we can
[1:18:46] still help one another.
[1:18:48] Suppose this second man said
[1:18:51] we no need to bother this man's
[1:18:54] condition will remain the same though
[1:18:56] Jesus touched my hand when it was
[1:18:58] withered I don't believe he can he heal
[1:19:00] a man so lame
[1:19:03] suppose that third man said I hate to
[1:19:05] question but no one here is more
[1:19:07] skeptical than me though Jesus ch
[1:19:10] cleansed me when I was a leper this
[1:19:12] helpless man will never walk you see
[1:19:16] then every eye was turned turned to see
[1:19:18] that fourth man to see how he might
[1:19:21] criticize and doubt. But all three men
[1:19:24] were startled with amazement when that
[1:19:26] fourth man stepped out and said his name
[1:19:30] out loud. He said, "My name is Lazarus."
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Could I testify? My name is Lazarus. It
[1:19:39] feel good. It feels good to be alive.
[1:19:42] When I'm when I was when I in chains of
[1:19:45] death was bound, this man named Jesus
[1:19:48] called me out. If you think that your
[1:19:50] little problem is too big for him to
[1:19:52] solve,
[1:19:54] take it from the one who's heard from
[1:19:56] the mighty voice of God. A living
[1:19:59] testimony of his death touch. My name is
[1:20:02] Lazarus. Oh, I wanted to shout back
[1:20:04] there. Amen. But I got to hold still.
[1:20:07] Amen. My name is Lazarus. Amen. And
[1:20:09] sometimes we can help somebody. Maybe
[1:20:12] just testifying to somebody and telling
[1:20:13] somebody what Jesus did for us. Amen.
[1:20:17] There been four men when this man on
[1:20:19] this bed probably didn't have faith
[1:20:20] enough to get to Jesus. But them four
[1:20:22] men had enough faith that they could
[1:20:24] take his bed and they had to tear the
[1:20:26] roof off the ceiling to get him into see
[1:20:28] where Jesus was.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; What about Caleb and her? You remember
[1:20:37] what happened to him two guys? They set
[1:20:40] Moses on a rock because when Moses had
[1:20:42] his hand lifted up, Israel was
[1:20:44] progressing in the war. Well, when
[1:20:46] Moses's hands dropped, they begin to
[1:20:49] lose the battle. So, you know what they
[1:20:50] did? Caleb and her went up there, set
[1:20:52] Moses down on the rock, and held up his
[1:20:54] hands.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Maybe when brother Tom, your pastor, is
[1:20:59] going through a battle, my pastor,
[1:21:01] whoever it may be, and and he he needs
[1:21:04] your help, maybe you can go and help
[1:21:05] him. Set him on a rock and hold his
[1:21:08] hands up.
[1:21:11] Hallelujah. We need one another.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:20] Ah, we need to segregate ourselves from
[1:21:22] the things of the world, but still
[1:21:24] holding to God's truth.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:30] I love them. Don't you?
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love him with all my heart. Amen.
[1:21:35] Oh, I appreciate him with all my heart.
[1:21:37] Let me read you another little thing
[1:21:38] that Brother Bram said. A thanking man's
[1:21:40] filter.
[1:21:42] He said, "We want to grow closer and
[1:21:44] closer together. We must be one body. We
[1:21:47] must move together, forgetting one
[1:21:49] another's sins and our differences, just
[1:21:52] sticking closer and closer as we see
[1:21:54] that day approaching, assembling
[1:21:56] ourselves together with a one accord and
[1:21:58] one heart. And if one our brother, our
[1:22:01] sister gets out of the way, don't do
[1:22:03] nothing but pray for that person." and
[1:22:05] in love, always considering one another.
[1:22:07] Don't never let one of you get away.
[1:22:09] Stay together and if you can add more to
[1:22:12] it constantly all the time.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:18] Now, let's just look at this.
[1:22:21] There's four things
[1:22:23] and I'll get to it and then we'll close.
[1:22:25] That be all right. What about our
[1:22:27] covenant with one another?
[1:22:30] Mark 12
[1:22:32] 29-31
[1:22:35] it says and Jesus answered him the first
[1:22:39] of all the commandments is here O Israel
[1:22:42] the Lord our God is one Lord
[1:22:46] so the first command first of all the
[1:22:48] commandments is here Israel the Lord our
[1:22:51] God is one Lord
[1:22:54] and thus and he said and thou shalt love
[1:22:57] the Lord thy God with all thy heart.
[1:23:00] The main principle was the Lord our God
[1:23:03] is one God or one Lord and thou shalt
[1:23:08] love the Lord out of and with your whole
[1:23:12] heart.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; And with all thy mind out of and with
[1:23:21] all your mind, your soul, your your your
[1:23:24] your your heart, your life, everything.
[1:23:27] And with all thy strength,
[1:23:30] with all with with and all your
[1:23:32] strength, all your all your mind, all
[1:23:35] your faculty of thought and your
[1:23:36] understanding, and with all your
[1:23:38] strength, everything with all your soul,
[1:23:40] life out of it, and with all your mind,
[1:23:43] faculty, thought, understanding, with
[1:23:45] all your strength, everything, just give
[1:23:46] it to God.
[1:23:49] That was the first one. That's our
[1:23:51] covenant with one another. Amen. He
[1:23:55] said, "And the second is like, namely
[1:23:57] this, thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[1:23:59] thyself."
[1:24:02] Leviticus 18:19, I think it is, says it
[1:24:05] like this. Thou shalt not
[1:24:08] avenge nor bear any grudge against the
[1:24:11] children of thy people, but thou shalt
[1:24:14] love thy neighbor as thyself. I am the
[1:24:16] Lord.
[1:24:20] How many always How many has had
[1:24:22] somebody done something wrong to you in
[1:24:24] the church or sometimes you just can't
[1:24:27] wait to get out? Said, "I'll wait till I
[1:24:29] get out of here. I'll give them a piece
[1:24:32] of my mind. I'll tell you what. Oh, I
[1:24:34] got some quotes together and I'll show
[1:24:35] them what
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; help me, Lord."
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; And maybe they got some quotes together
[1:24:42] that they can show me where I'm wrong.
[1:24:47] That's right.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; The second is like, namely this, thou
[1:24:51] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
[1:24:53] There is none other commandment greater
[1:24:55] than these.
[1:24:57] Help us Lord.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; His laws is not burdensome.
[1:25:05] Two simple principles. Love God
[1:25:09] and love others.
[1:25:11] Love God completely.
[1:25:14] everything, all your heart, all your
[1:25:16] soul, all your mind,
[1:25:18] with all your strength, and care for
[1:25:21] others as you care for yourself.
[1:25:26] Come on.
[1:25:28] Asked her, that lady sitting right there
[1:25:30] with that white hair right there, that
[1:25:32] one right there, Mrs. Gadman, she said,
[1:25:35] "David, you going to have to cut this
[1:25:36] out
[1:25:38] since you got out of the hospital. You
[1:25:41] just been a baby.
[1:25:44] Do this and do this and do that. Hey.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Hey. Men are babies. Come on. Let's be
[1:25:52] honest.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Sometimes. Hey, we like to be babyed.
[1:25:58] Might as well be honest. We like to be
[1:26:01] babyed, you know. Hey, my wife's just
[1:26:04] like Sarah.
[1:26:06] Sarah called him Lord. Sarah called
[1:26:07] Abraham Lord. I asked for a glass glass
[1:26:10] of water. Lord, David, can't you get it
[1:26:12] yourself?
[1:26:12] [Applause]
[1:26:15] Nah, she's good. She
[1:26:19] She'll kill me after church. I got to
[1:26:21] ride back home with her.
[1:26:24] Hallelujah. But that's our covenant with
[1:26:26] one another. And there in that light of
[1:26:29] glory said, "We we we forsaken our
[1:26:31] covenant with one another." He said,
[1:26:33] "That's why we're so disunified.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; That's why we ain't got the unity that
[1:26:37] we and he said and brother Bam said it's
[1:26:39] going to come around. And you know how
[1:26:41] the old saying bias us. Amen. It's
[1:26:43] because what we did to the native and
[1:26:44] look at it and we're so disunified.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; In the natural and in the spiritual.
[1:26:53] That's our covenant with one another.
[1:26:55] What about Christ's order?
[1:26:58] John 13:34 and:es 34 and 35.
[1:27:02] This is Christ's order. A new
[1:27:04] commandment
[1:27:06] I give unto you.
[1:27:09] Somebody picked up that book. I was told
[1:27:11] one time we all got it and I I I must
[1:27:14] have misplay. I don't know. The 11th
[1:27:15] commandment. How many seen that brother?
[1:27:18] I'm just talking about love and all
[1:27:19] that. Talks about the the the possum and
[1:27:21] the and the the the hornets and
[1:27:23] everything. My I heard brother somebody
[1:27:27] say brother come by and preach for us.
[1:27:28] Man I read I didn't try I squat them
[1:27:31] spray. Give me some sprays. Try to spray
[1:27:33] them old hornets with that hornet spray.
[1:27:35] Now little hornets. I'm sorry. Go back.
[1:27:37] No. It's got to be real.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; It's got to be genuine.
[1:27:45] Can you imagine, brother said about
[1:27:47] mowing and he hid that and he said, "I'm
[1:27:48] sorry. I'm God's servant. I trying to
[1:27:51] hurry and get in this grass mold and I
[1:27:53] ran into your nest and bothered you,
[1:27:54] disturbed you."
[1:27:57] He really meant it.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; What about that killer bull?
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Said, "I got in your territory. I'm
[1:28:05] sorry.
[1:28:07] What about us?
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:28:12] it's all saying, and maybe Abraham
[1:28:14] Lincoln said it, I can't remember.
[1:28:17] You can't fool the people. You might
[1:28:19] fool them some of the time, but you
[1:28:20] can't fool them all the time.
[1:28:22] And you really know when somebody puts
[1:28:24] their arms around you, you don't have to
[1:28:26] have a gifted discernment, like brother
[1:28:27] Bram said, but you can know when
[1:28:29] somebody puts their arms around your
[1:28:30] sister, sister, and brother to brother,
[1:28:31] and they say they really love you, you
[1:28:33] know whether they're telling the truth
[1:28:34] or not. You know whether it's coming
[1:28:35] from the heart or not.
[1:28:38] Help me Lord.
[1:28:41] New commandment. They said something
[1:28:43] about that book. But Jesus said a new
[1:28:44] commandment. There was ten commandments
[1:28:47] and he said a new commandment. So that'd
[1:28:48] be the 11th commandment.
[1:28:51] He said a new commandment I give unto
[1:28:52] you that you love one another
[1:28:58] as I have loved you
[1:29:01] that you also love one another.
[1:29:05] He said, "A new commandment I give unto
[1:29:06] you, that you love one another as I have
[1:29:09] loved you, that you also love one
[1:29:12] another." How much did he love us? He
[1:29:15] came
[1:29:17] took on a sinful form of flesh to be
[1:29:20] tested like me and you were to go
[1:29:23] through pain, discomfort,
[1:29:25] disappointments, so he would know how
[1:29:27] mean you feel.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Brothers, sisters, young people, you
[1:29:31] feel rejected. You feel like nobody
[1:29:33] cares. He was rejected.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; He knows what you're going through.
[1:29:38] You feel like nobody love he he didn't
[1:29:40] feel like nobody loved him. He weeping
[1:29:42] over weeping over looking overlooking
[1:29:44] Jerusalem. He said, "How often I would
[1:29:45] have gathered you like a hing with a
[1:29:46] brood but you would not.
[1:29:49] You've been tempted young people, young
[1:29:51] men. You've been tempted by women. How
[1:29:53] can overcome?" Brother said, "Jesus was
[1:29:55] tempted by women.
[1:29:58] He knows what you're going through."
[1:30:01] Amen. That's right,
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; sisters. You feel like you're on the
[1:30:05] back burner sometimes. He knows what
[1:30:07] you're going through.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; He knows what you're going through.
[1:30:13] To be a faithful high priest, one that
[1:30:15] can be touched by the feeling of our
[1:30:17] infirmities.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; And he loved us that much. That's right.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Became one in us. Why can't we love one
[1:30:24] another? Why can't we pray for one
[1:30:26] another?
[1:30:31] He said, "A new commandment that you
[1:30:33] love one another as I have loved you,
[1:30:36] that you also love one another. By this
[1:30:38] shall all men know that you are my
[1:30:39] disciples if you have love one to
[1:30:42] another." My
[1:30:44] keep showing love among ourselves.
[1:30:48] Hey,
[1:30:50] people may come
[1:30:52] and it don't matter about our they may
[1:30:53] not understand our doctrine.
[1:30:56] Big building, what does it matter? They
[1:30:59] they may not care whether it's a
[1:31:02] storefront, whether it's a nice church
[1:31:03] building or what our doctrine, but what
[1:31:06] about our love toward one another?
[1:31:12] He said this. Oh, we read it this
[1:31:14] morning when I about being written
[1:31:15] epistles read of all men. Like I said,
[1:31:18] sometimes some people may not read a
[1:31:19] Bible, but they'll read your life.
[1:31:24] What about our love toward one another?
[1:31:26] United living examples.
[1:31:29] What about being living examples?
[1:31:35] My I want to be a living example.
[1:31:39] Don't you? That was our covenant with
[1:31:40] one another. Christ's order. Number
[1:31:43] three, unity.
[1:31:46] St. John 17:es 20 and 21.
[1:31:50] Neither pray I for these alone,
[1:31:53] but for them which also believe
[1:31:57] on me through their word.
[1:32:00] See, he said, "Neither pray I for these
[1:32:04] alone, but for them also which shall
[1:32:08] believe on me through their word."
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; In other words, them preaching and them
[1:32:15] testifying. I'm praying for those that
[1:32:17] will hear them preaching and testifying
[1:32:21] that they'll believe on me through their
[1:32:23] word. I pray Lord help us Lord God that
[1:32:26] hey when you go out you brothers on your
[1:32:27] job I pray God help them that maybe
[1:32:30] they're testifying or with you sisters
[1:32:32] in the grocery store or in your house
[1:32:34] and do your or somebody a neighbor or
[1:32:36] whatever that maybe you're testifying or
[1:32:38] just just being you just living your
[1:32:41] life daily
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; that they may whoever you may come in
[1:32:46] contact with that they'll believe on him
[1:32:48] through what you have are doing and
[1:32:50] through your words and through your
[1:32:51] testimony and by the way you live and
[1:32:53] conduct your life.
[1:32:57] Hallelujah. Jesus prayed for us,
[1:33:00] didn't he? He said, I pray
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; for these alone. He said that they shall
[1:33:07] be one or and then brother said the
[1:33:10] denomination. They say, "Oh, we just
[1:33:11] want but they," he said, "not like that,
[1:33:13] but one with what? One with the word."
[1:33:15] And who's the word? Christ is the word.
[1:33:18] And Christ sent us a word in our day.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:24] Not as the pope would have us one, but
[1:33:27] one with his word.
[1:33:31] Said, "Neither, I pray them for them,
[1:33:33] but for those that they all may be one,
[1:33:35] as thou, Father, art me and I in thee,
[1:33:39] that they also may be one in us, that
[1:33:41] the world may believe that thou hast
[1:33:44] sent me." Oh, is that what you want?
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; That the world may believe that. Hey,
[1:33:51] you have sent me that they can believe
[1:33:55] on me through your words, through your
[1:33:57] testifying, through your life.
[1:34:00] That's number three. Number four,
[1:34:03] our mandate.
[1:34:06] Our mandate.
[1:34:09] Listen what he says before I read this.
[1:34:12] This is he preached on the message when
[1:34:13] their eyes were open 1956.
[1:34:16] See, a lot of people say, "Well," and it
[1:34:18] it goes back again to like I said, the
[1:34:20] natural types of spiritual. The medical
[1:34:23] doctor, he's against the the the the the
[1:34:26] uh surgeon and the surgeon condemns the
[1:34:28] chiropractor. And the chiropractor, you
[1:34:30] know, and all that, brother says medical
[1:34:32] doctor, he the surgeon, they condemn,
[1:34:34] you know, the chiropractor, we we need
[1:34:36] you and he said, "And we need one
[1:34:38] another. We need every one of them.
[1:34:41] Where one can't help you, another one
[1:34:42] may can."
[1:34:44] Hey, we need us in the in the body of
[1:34:47] Christ. We need the pastor. We need the
[1:34:50] teacher. We need the prophet. We need we
[1:34:52] need all these. We need the five-fold
[1:34:54] ministry.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Number four, our mandate.
[1:35:01] And I didn't really know what mandate
[1:35:02] means, but every now and then they say,
[1:35:05] you know, like at work, you brothers at
[1:35:07] work, they get we give you a mandate or
[1:35:10] we we we're going to mandate this or
[1:35:12] this is a mandate. And a mandate means
[1:35:14] an official order or commission. In
[1:35:17] other words, it's official. This is an
[1:35:20] official order or a commission to do
[1:35:22] something. I mean, they wrote it down.
[1:35:24] It's a mandate. You got to do it. Give
[1:35:27] someone author or give someone authority
[1:35:29] to act in a certain way.
[1:35:32] This is our mandate.
[1:35:34] It's an order. We've been given it by
[1:35:38] the supreme being himself, Jesus Christ.
[1:35:42] We've been given a mandate an official
[1:35:44] order and that official order is
[1:35:46] Ephesians 4
[1:35:48] verse three endeavoring
[1:35:52] to keep the unity of the spirit
[1:35:54] in the bond of peace.
[1:35:57] Each and every one of us has been given
[1:35:59] a mandate this afternoon
[1:36:02] and that's endeavor.
[1:36:05] In other words, it means be eager and
[1:36:06] strive constantly
[1:36:09] to guard and keep the harmony.
[1:36:16] What about that? To guard,
[1:36:19] to strive, to be eager, to keep the
[1:36:23] harmony.
[1:36:25] Willing to be led.
[1:36:30] Willing to be led.
[1:36:32] Sometimes we ain't willing to be led by
[1:36:34] the Holy Spirit, but I want to be
[1:36:36] willing to be led.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Willing to be led and do our part.
[1:36:47] I want to do my part.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; If it's just coming to church 30 minutes
[1:36:50] early,
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Sitting quietly,
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; reading my Bible,
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; and praying. Say, Lord, you know,
[1:36:58] Brother Homer, he don't know what I have
[1:37:00] need of. He don't know what I've been
[1:37:01] going through this week and whatever you
[1:37:04] have for me.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; You say, "Can he do that, Brother
[1:37:08] David?"
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; You want a testimony?
[1:37:12] Me and my wife were sitting. We sat
[1:37:14] right there on the second bench or
[1:37:16] second pew. We ain't got pews now. We
[1:37:19] got chairs. But we sitting there in our
[1:37:21] church. I don't know if anybody's ever
[1:37:23] been to our church. I don't know if you
[1:37:25] have, brother. We only got two
[1:37:29] rows of seats, you know, one row and
[1:37:31] another row.
[1:37:33] So,
[1:37:35] been several years ago, my wife was
[1:37:38] sitting there and she's kind of nervous
[1:37:39] type.
[1:37:41] And she leaned over at me and said some
[1:37:43] things was going on. She said, "David,
[1:37:44] I'm just so nervous."
[1:37:47] And she named some things that were
[1:37:48] bothering her.
[1:37:52] And she said, "I just feel like getting
[1:37:53] up and going home." She said, "I ain't
[1:37:55] going to get nothing out of the
[1:37:56] service." How many's ever been there?
[1:38:01] I said, 'Well, we'll just pray.
[1:38:04] Now, whether I've seen I can't remember
[1:38:07] whether between services we went and ate
[1:38:10] with brother Homer. I don't know what,
[1:38:12] but I did not see him till he walked out
[1:38:15] there. If we did, that's fine. If not,
[1:38:17] I'm just saying I didn't see him cuz my
[1:38:20] wife leaned over and said, "Did you talk
[1:38:21] to Brother Homer?" Because here's what
[1:38:23] happened. Brother Homer got up there and
[1:38:25] I hadn't seen him before he walked out
[1:38:26] there. He got to preaching under the
[1:38:28] anointing and he stopped right in the
[1:38:30] middle and he said, "I don't know why
[1:38:32] I'm going this direction, but the Lord's
[1:38:33] leading me to this direction." And he
[1:38:35] named the things that my wife told me
[1:38:37] was bothering her.
[1:38:39] 30 minutes before the service, she told
[1:38:41] me he comes out and he hits on it. God's
[1:38:45] mindful of us.
[1:38:46] [Applause]
[1:38:50] God's mindful of us.
[1:38:52] He can do that. Amen. Focus on God, not
[1:38:55] ourselves. On what God can do as a body
[1:38:58] of believers. Amen. Brother Tom may not
[1:39:00] know what you have need of. Brother Brad
[1:39:02] don't know what you have need of. I may
[1:39:04] not know what you have need of the other
[1:39:05] advantage. But if you be praying and
[1:39:07] asking God and come in here and be as a
[1:39:09] body of believers in unity and not
[1:39:12] divided and pray and say, "God, you
[1:39:14] speak to the brother. Help him. Lord, I
[1:39:16] need you this morning. I need you
[1:39:18] tonight. I need you Wednesday, whatever
[1:39:19] it may be. and brother Tom or whoever it
[1:39:21] may be may leave their notes and speak
[1:39:23] to your condition then move on.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; He's God.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[1:39:31] spirit in the bond of peace. Let me read
[1:39:34] one more then we'll close. I trust this
[1:39:37] is all right this morning
[1:39:42] this afternoon. Listen what he says.
[1:39:44] We've all heard this one.
[1:39:48] I like it.
[1:39:50] Love one another
[1:39:52] above everything. Love one another.
[1:39:56] No matter what the devil tries to say.
[1:39:59] Now, you're all one great big sweet
[1:40:01] group now. But remember my warning. See,
[1:40:04] Satan won't let that stay that way. No,
[1:40:06] sir. He'll shoot everything. If he has
[1:40:09] to bring somebody in to make his target,
[1:40:11] he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in
[1:40:14] and set him down and cause him to
[1:40:15] fellowship with you under the quietness
[1:40:17] and things. And then he'll shoot that
[1:40:19] guy with some kind of a poison stuff and
[1:40:21] he'll start through the church with it.
[1:40:23] Don't you take sides with it. Don't you
[1:40:25] have nothing to do with anything else.
[1:40:27] You stay right, loving, and sweet and
[1:40:28] kind to one another. Pray for that man
[1:40:32] that he'll be saved to or that woman
[1:40:33] orever who it is. Just pray for them and
[1:40:36] stick one with another. And stay with
[1:40:38] your pastor. See, he's the shepherd. And
[1:40:41] you give him respects. You you he'll
[1:40:45] lead you through. and because he's
[1:40:47] ordained a god to do so. Now you do
[1:40:49] remember that the enemy will come
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; and when the when he does just cling
[1:40:56] that much closer together and the one
[1:40:58] that the devil is using for an enemy
[1:41:00] will either get out or come in.
[1:41:03] Ain't that something? Brother Brham
[1:41:05] didn't pull no punches. We all know
[1:41:08] this. It's called the word to the
[1:41:10] church.
[1:41:13] He said he either get in
[1:41:16] or we'll either get out or some or come
[1:41:19] in and be one of you. That's all. Don't
[1:41:21] never clan among one or or talk. Make
[1:41:25] yourself clanish. We we are one. I
[1:41:28] couldn't let left hand. I'm I'm mad at
[1:41:30] you. I'm going to take you away cuz
[1:41:33] you're not a right hand. He's at He's my
[1:41:35] left hand. I want him to stay there.
[1:41:38] Even the little tip of my finger. I want
[1:41:40] to stay right there. Every little part
[1:41:42] of my body stay right there. And God
[1:41:45] wants us as a body of believers to stay
[1:41:47] right exactly with one another. Right at
[1:41:51] uh right at with one another. And now
[1:41:54] you got tapes on that. You got tapes on
[1:41:57] what we believe. You got tapes on
[1:41:59] discipline in the church. How we behave
[1:42:01] ourselves in the church of God. How we
[1:42:02] got to come in together and set together
[1:42:05] in heavenly places. Don't stay home. If
[1:42:07] God is in your heart, you can't hardly
[1:42:09] wait for them doors to open out yonder
[1:42:10] to get in here to fellowship with your
[1:42:12] brothers. If you don't don't feel that
[1:42:14] way, then I'll tell you, it's time you
[1:42:16] get to praying because we're in the last
[1:42:18] days where the Bible exalted or exhorted
[1:42:21] us to to much more as we see that day
[1:42:24] approaching to love one another with
[1:42:26] Christian love and to and divine love.
[1:42:29] No, to to assemble ourselves together in
[1:42:32] heavenly places and and with with Christ
[1:42:34] Jesus and love one another. This will be
[1:42:38] this will all men know you are my
[1:42:39] disciples when you have love one for the
[1:42:41] other. That's right. Stay right
[1:42:43] together. If the brother you think he's
[1:42:45] a little wrong or the sister, say,
[1:42:47] "Lord, don't let that uh never uh have
[1:42:51] that root of bitterness spring up
[1:42:53] because it'll affect him and it take the
[1:42:55] Christ right out of my life. That poison
[1:42:58] acids of malice and jealousy and hatred
[1:43:00] that will just take the Holy Spirit
[1:43:01] right away from you. It'll run him from
[1:43:03] the tabernacle here. It'll kill the
[1:43:05] spirit of God or drive it away from
[1:43:08] there, hurt your pastor. It'll do
[1:43:10] everything. See, don't you do that. You
[1:43:12] just wax that much closer together. Draw
[1:43:15] take the buckle. As a brother testified,
[1:43:18] a minister here the other night about
[1:43:20] having a buckle. Send it and vision just
[1:43:22] that buckles on the whole armor of God.
[1:43:24] Just put her on, tighten up, move right
[1:43:26] up close to one another, love one
[1:43:28] another. Anyhow, talk nice about one
[1:43:31] another. Say nice things about one
[1:43:33] another. and then God will bless you.
[1:43:35] How many wants to be blessed? He said,
[1:43:37] "Talk nice about one another, say nice
[1:43:39] things about one another, pray for one
[1:43:41] another, and then God will bless you." I
[1:43:43] want to be blessed by God. Don't you?
[1:43:45] Let's stand together tonight.
[1:43:48] Hallelujah. You love him.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Give him praise in the
[1:43:52] house. Amen.
[1:43:54] [Applause]
[1:43:57] Hallelujah. I trust this was all right
[1:44:00] tonight.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I love him with all my heart.
[1:44:04] I appreciate him. Amen. Just I thought
[1:44:06] my just our unity, our covenant with one
[1:44:09] another. We failed so miserably, hadn't
[1:44:12] we? But if God will be merciful to us,
[1:44:14] he'll help us, won't he?
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just pray. Heavenly Father,
[1:44:19] Lord, we love you with all that's within
[1:44:21] our hearts. Lord, we appreciate you,
[1:44:23] Father. And Lord, if I said anything out
[1:44:26] of the way, forgive me, Lord. Didn't
[1:44:27] mean to.
[1:44:29] Just help me, Father. Brother Tom,
[1:44:31] thanks.
[1:44:32] send anything out of the way, he'll call
[1:44:33] me, let me know, Father. But Lord, I
[1:44:35] just felt this on my heart, Lord. Unity,
[1:44:37] our covenant with one another, Lord, how
[1:44:39] in the natural how that them guys and
[1:44:41] they took great detail in writing that
[1:44:43] book. They they searched it out all
[1:44:45] over, Lord, and talking about how
[1:44:47] America came to be and all that, Lord,
[1:44:48] and how they went through all the
[1:44:51] battles and scars they went through to
[1:44:52] get to where they were. And then all of
[1:44:55] a sudden to realize, Lord, that we've
[1:44:57] we've let down our covenant with one
[1:44:59] another. how we're so divided. Father,
[1:45:01] Lord, in the natural types, the
[1:45:03] spiritual, Father, God, help us, Lord.
[1:45:06] Help us to pray for one another like
[1:45:08] your prophet said, to love one another,
[1:45:10] to help one another, Lord Jesus. Pray
[1:45:13] for our pastor, Lord, and help him, Lord
[1:45:15] God. And Lord, you see both of them
[1:45:18] being sick to today. Lord, I pray, Lord,
[1:45:20] you'd touch Brother Brad again. Touch
[1:45:23] Brother Tom, Lord, everyone that
[1:45:24] wouldn't be here for some other reason.
[1:45:26] Lord, maybe those that were here this
[1:45:28] morning, had to leave or Lord, they had
[1:45:30] to drive back somewhere, Lord. God, I
[1:45:32] pray, Lord, you just continue to touch
[1:45:34] and bless. Lord God, help each and every
[1:45:37] one just drive us much closer to you,
[1:45:40] Lord. God, help us to keep our covenant
[1:45:42] that we made one a unity. Lord, a
[1:45:45] unified body, Lord. Father, oh, we may
[1:45:49] have some differences, no doubt, Lord.
[1:45:51] We may not see everything eye to eye, no
[1:45:53] doubt, Father, but Lord, may we love one
[1:45:56] another. May we pray for one another,
[1:45:58] Lord. May we just draw that much closer
[1:46:01] together, Lord. Father, we're living in
[1:46:03] a late hour. Time's running out, Father.
[1:46:07] Lord, there's some of us here sitting
[1:46:09] here, standing here tonight, Lord, that
[1:46:11] may have loved ones that are lost and
[1:46:12] without you, Lord. Father, we can't love
[1:46:16] one another. How do we expect them to
[1:46:17] love one another? If we can't hold
[1:46:20] together, how do we expect them to come
[1:46:21] in, Lord? But I pray for everyone that
[1:46:23] maybe have someone like that, Lord. May
[1:46:25] we all stand together, Lord, and we just
[1:46:27] sent out the Holy Ghost tonight. Lord,
[1:46:29] your prophet said we had a right to take
[1:46:32] your agent, God's Holy Spirit, and send
[1:46:34] it out there to wherever they may be.
[1:46:36] Maybe you robbed some of our young
[1:46:38] people. They're they're they're outside
[1:46:41] the fold tonight. Lord, maybe some of
[1:46:44] these moms, these dads have been praying
[1:46:45] for Wayward Boy, Wayward Girl. Lord, I
[1:46:48] pray Lord you go to where they're at
[1:46:49] tonight, Lord, by your Holy Spirit,
[1:46:52] Lord, and arrest their souls. May they
[1:46:54] realize, Lord, that there's more to life
[1:46:56] than what they're doing. Father,
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; maybe the Satan has robbed the health of
[1:46:59] some of us, our loved ones. I pray,
[1:47:01] Lord, you go, we have a right. Your
[1:47:03] prophet said we sent out the Holy Spirit
[1:47:05] to where they're at tonight. Ask you to
[1:47:07] raise them back up, touch them, Lord.
[1:47:08] May you heal their bodies, Lord. Lord,
[1:47:11] I'm a recipient of your healing power,
[1:47:13] Lord. Father, and I pray for those that
[1:47:16] are without tonight that may be sick,
[1:47:17] Lord. Maybe the doctors gave up on Lord,
[1:47:19] but Lord, you're still a healer.
[1:47:23] Maybe Lord, Satan has bound some people
[1:47:26] where they can't even worship you,
[1:47:27] right? Lord, they can't even come to
[1:47:29] church and raise their hands. Lord, we
[1:47:31] send out the Holy Spirit tonight. Lord,
[1:47:33] Lord, help them. Set them free tonight,
[1:47:35] Lord, by your power, Lord Jesus. Grant
[1:47:39] it, Lord, that we can lift our holy
[1:47:41] hands to you, Lord, to worship you in
[1:47:43] spirit and in truth. Grant it, Father.
[1:47:46] We love you. May we love one another.
[1:47:49] That's our covenant, Lord.
[1:47:52] This we all men know that you're my
[1:47:54] disciples if you have love one for the
[1:47:56] other. Grant it, Father. We ask these
[1:47:59] things in the lovely name of Jesus
[1:48:01] Christ. Amen. Amen. Brother, whatever
[1:48:04] you got there. Amen.

[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Do you want to live that way?
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just raise your hands to
[1:48:26] him and say, "Lord, I want to live the
[1:48:28] way you want me to live tonight." Amen.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; I want to love
[1:48:36] [Music]

[1:48:41] no more love.

[1:48:53] I want to live
[1:48:56] the way
[1:48:59] he wants me to live.
[1:49:03] I want to give

[1:49:14] to love
[1:49:16] to love. Bless the David.

[1:49:26] ever round out love the Lord.
[1:49:33] Oh, I want to live
[1:49:36] the way
[1:49:39] he wants me to live.
[1:49:43] I want to give
[1:49:46] until there's just no more
[1:49:51] to give. I want to love
[1:49:57] love till there's just no more love for
[1:50:03] I could never
[1:50:06] ever
[1:50:08] love the Lord
