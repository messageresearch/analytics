[4:24] Morning, brothers and sisters.
[4:27] If we'll just all stand this morning.
[4:30] Maybe
[4:32] brother Joe will open us in prayer this
[4:34] morning.
[4:36] Jesus
[4:39] all come before you this morning.
[4:46] Lord, we realize Lord Jesus each one of
[4:49] us here this morning has their own
[4:51] situation.
[4:53] Lord, we find ourselves many people Lord
[4:56] no doubt other than we always want to
[4:58] clean somebody else's step instead of
[5:01] wor.
[5:03] Lord I ask this morning that
[5:06] to look in the word and see where it is
[5:08] they need to be to get ready to leave
[5:11] here. Lord, if we just Lord, we know
[5:15] what to do. Lord, when you come, if we
[5:18] didn't do what you want us to do, we'll
[5:21] be beaten with many stripes. Lord, we
[5:24] realize the one that never knew what to
[5:27] do. They won't even get as beat as hard
[5:29] as us.
[5:31] Lord, we ask that you would help us this
[5:33] day. Lord, that we have our priorities
[5:36] that we would do what the word says and
[5:39] we realize this morning Lord Jesus we
[5:41] answer to you Lord your Lord that's who
[5:44] we have to give account to Lord I ask
[5:47] that you would ask help each family here
[5:50] Lord you know what they're going through
[5:52] this morning all of us are different
[5:55] Lord we ask you the Sunday school all
[5:59] the words that's been spoken Lord for
[6:01] the singing Lord Jesus
[6:04] the preaching of the word and we realize
[6:07] the wonderful place that we have to come
[6:09] to. It was you that allowed us to have
[6:12] it. Lord, we follow every devil from the
[6:15] pits of hell to try to keep us from
[6:17] getting it. But we realize this morning
[6:22] when something good is going to happen,
[6:24] you going to have to fight them. We say
[6:26] praise the Lord, we're fighting devils
[6:28] this morning, Lord. Lord, we ask that
[6:31] you come this day, Lord. We just tell
[6:34] you from our heart, Lord, we not worried
[6:36] about what other men, other women got to
[6:39] say. We worry about what you have to
[6:41] say. And we just want to tell you that
[6:43] we love you, Lord Jesus. Amen.
[6:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. The children can be dismissed for
[6:48] Sunday school. And if you'll go in the
[6:50] Psalms with me, we're going to go to
[6:52] Psalms 113. And we're going to read
[6:55] Psalms 113 and 114.
[7:00] Psalms
[7:05] 113.
[7:11] &gt;&gt; Praise ye the Lord. Praise, oh ye
[7:14] servants of the Lord. Praise the name of
[7:16] the Lord.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; From the rising of the sun unto the
[7:24] going down of the same, the Lord's name
[7:27] is to be praised.
[7:30] nations.
[7:34] &gt;&gt; Who is like unto the Lord our God who
[7:36] dwelleth on high?
[7:43] &gt;&gt; He raises up the poor out of the dust
[7:45] and lifteth up the needy out of the
[7:47] donghill.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; He maketh the barren women to keep house
[7:55] and to be joyful mother of children.
[7:57] Praise ye the Lord.
[8:05] Judah was his sanctuary and Israel his
[8:07] dominion.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; The mountains skipped like rams and the
[8:16] little hills like lambs.
[8:25] Ye mountains that you skipped like rams,
[8:28] and ye little hills like lambs,
[8:37] &gt;&gt; which turn the rock into a standing
[8:39] water, and the flint into the fountain
[8:41] of waters. God bless. You may be seated,
[8:43] Brother Brian.
[8:48] Morning
[8:57] brothers and sisters.
[8:59] &gt;&gt; You know after having knee knee
[9:01] replacements I mean going upstairs
[9:05] been always been a hard thing. I can go
[9:07] up and down a ladder every day all day
[9:09] and it doesn't bother me. But climbing a
[9:11] simple set of stairs can be a killer
[9:13] sometimes. You know, I was uh if you
[9:16] would turn with me to the fifth chapter
[9:18] of Matthew, one of those u paragraphs
[9:21] that was up there this morning really
[9:23] struck me. You you know, it's the one
[9:25] where you see the tree growing out of
[9:27] the rock. And I was just thinking, you
[9:30] can't force someone to believe the word
[9:32] of God and to receive Jesus Christ as
[9:34] their savior. You can beat it dead like
[9:38] a horse. And unless there's a seed of
[9:40] life in that individual and that soul to
[9:43] receive the word of God and to come into
[9:45] maturity,
[9:47] it's not going to happen. But doesn't
[9:49] mean that you don't have a
[9:51] responsibility to do that. But I was
[9:53] thinking, what do people need in the day
[9:56] that we live in this morning? What do
[9:57] they need to see? And I and it's just
[10:01] simple. They need to see a life lived.
[10:03] They need to see that God has made a
[10:05] change in you and me and our hearts and
[10:08] our lives and we're leave
[10:11] living excuse me a Christian life. you
[10:14] know, the experience I've had over my
[10:17] life sometimes I realize it's not the
[10:19] things that I've ever said to people or
[10:22] things, but it's the example that you
[10:24] show people that's what they they're
[10:27] watching you. Whether you're at work or
[10:29] whether you're at school or whatever you
[10:31] do, people are watching you. When you
[10:33] testify to be a Christian and a servant
[10:36] of Jesus Christ, they're watching you 24
[10:39] hours a day. And the negative people are
[10:43] looking for you to make the a mistake so
[10:46] they can, you know, just blow the two
[10:49] and say that you're not, you don't have
[10:51] it. And the other people are looking at
[10:53] the example and they can see that if you
[10:55] can live that life and God can change
[10:57] you and bring you into accountability,
[11:00] he can do the same for them. And I know
[11:03] from people that have talked to me
[11:05] sometimes it's the life that I live that
[11:08] brought them to to understand that there
[11:10] is a better way to live, you know, and
[11:12] that's what and it's really hard to
[11:14] believe, but that's what people really
[11:16] need in this generation. They need to
[11:18] see us as Christians living and doing
[11:21] and breathing everything that we believe
[11:24] and not being hypocritical about the way
[11:26] we are. And then another thing struck me
[11:28] about what was mentioned there this
[11:30] morning.
[11:31] I've learned in my life, you really know
[11:34] where you're at with the Lord. What when
[11:36] you wake up in the morning, that first
[11:38] thought or the first couple of thoughts
[11:40] once you get out of your bed, what is
[11:42] possessing your heart and mind in the
[11:44] morning before you even start the day.
[11:47] And if you look back and examine
[11:49] yourself, you can realize what's driving
[11:52] you that day. Uh do we all have
[11:56] problems? We all have problems. But the
[11:58] a I believe in my own life sometimes if
[12:01] I don't start the day right I don't
[12:03] finish the day right. So it's really
[12:05] important whatever we do in life that we
[12:07] got to start it right and that's in the
[12:10] word of God in prayer and then our first
[12:12] thoughts should be of the Lord and
[12:14] giving praise to him that we lived
[12:15] another day and uh but I was really uh
[12:20] let me get pull this out here. Uh I left
[12:22] my notebook at home. I'm not ad living
[12:26] you know you one thing I've learned I I
[12:29] say this a lot
[12:31] your obligation is to learn the word of
[12:33] God and apply it and put it in your
[12:35] heart and life and if you stay still
[12:37] enough I know and from my own experience
[12:40] you'd be surprised the things that God
[12:42] can do with you if you do what he asks
[12:44] you to do if you'll read the word of God
[12:47] if you'll read the message of the hour
[12:49] even though you think you might not know
[12:51] anything compared to your brothers and
[12:53] sisters you'd be surprised urprised.
[12:54] Sometimes the knowledge that'll come out
[12:57] of your heart and life if you just stay
[12:59] in the word of God and read the Bible,
[13:01] you'll be surprised. God will touch your
[13:02] heart. He'll touch your mind and you'll
[13:04] find yourself saying things to people
[13:07] and you'll say to yourself, "Where did
[13:08] that come from? Where did that idea come
[13:10] from?" But that's what that person
[13:12] needed in that time. But um
[13:16] I just wrote this note down to myself as
[13:19] I was thinking, but I'll read these
[13:21] scriptures here this morning. And I'm
[13:24] I'm totally off what I was thinking
[13:27] about this morning. But it really
[13:29] strikes me as we see the world that the
[13:32] condition it's in this morning, it's
[13:34] really important
[13:36] that we spend more time with the Lord
[13:38] every day. I as I get older, I realize I
[13:41] need to spend more time with him. You
[13:43] know, not that I didn't need him just as
[13:46] much as a young man as I do as an old
[13:48] man. That that doesn't change. We all
[13:50] need the Lord every day to fully possess
[13:52] our hearts and lives this morning. But
[13:55] I'll I'll just read a few of these
[13:56] scriptures before I go off the deep end
[13:58] here. And uh this is what we all know
[14:01] this here, but do we really apply it to
[14:04] our lives this morning? And I was also
[14:06] listening to a few messages, but I'll
[14:08] I'll just read these scriptures here.
[14:11] And and seeing the multitudes, he went
[14:13] up into a mountain and said mountain.
[14:16] And when he had set, his disciples said
[14:18] unto him, and he opened his mouth and
[14:20] taught them, saying,
[14:22] I I didn't read that right. I'm bad
[14:25] about that. His disciples came unto him.
[14:28] And he opened his mouth and taught them
[14:30] saying, and I mean, bless we people have
[14:35] this hanging in their houses. But do
[14:36] they live it? That's the most important
[14:39] thing. Blessed are the poor in spirit,
[14:41] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[14:43] Blessed are they that mourn, for they
[14:45] shall be comforted. Blessed are the
[14:48] meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
[14:49] And and when I read things like that, I
[14:52] want to see those attributes in me. I
[14:54] want God to apply those attributes to
[14:56] me. and I want them to give me these
[14:58] opportunities. Blessed are they which do
[15:00] hunger and thirst after righteousness,
[15:03] for they shall be filled. Blessed are
[15:05] the merciful, for they shall obtain
[15:07] mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart,
[15:10] for they shall see God. Blessed are the
[15:12] peacemakers, for they shall be called
[15:14] the children of God. And blessed are
[15:16] they which are persecuted for
[15:18] righteousness sake, for theirs is the
[15:21] kingdom of heaven. And I'll stop there.
[15:22] I was, you know, the world we live in
[15:25] crazy. I had never thought as a after
[15:29] all these years of living which are I
[15:31] haven't been on this earth very long. I
[15:33] never thought I'd see a time in our
[15:36] country and the world. They are so
[15:39] determined to bring about nuclear war. I
[15:42] mean they are they're just running.
[15:44] They're not even they don't no guard
[15:46] rails anymore. Everyone is running to
[15:49] that destination. They don't want to
[15:51] there's nothing to stop them anymore.
[15:53] And I was thinking this morning, if you
[15:56] if you read the, it's not what I think.
[15:59] If you go back to what brother Brandham
[16:01] said in and to Daniel 70 weeks and if
[16:04] you go back to the 12 chapters of
[16:06] Daniel, what really struck me, I'll
[16:08] finish with this thought this morning is
[16:10] that you remember when Daniel was
[16:12] praying before the angel of Gabriel came
[16:15] to him. You know what Gabriel told
[16:18] Daniel that the these these evil spirits
[16:21] of these areas were resisting me,
[16:24] hindering me, coming to you to give you
[16:27] this revelation of what God was going to
[16:30] do with your people in the years ahead.
[16:32] And I was just thinking that's where
[16:33] we're at this morning. When when you see
[16:36] the circumstances going on in the world,
[16:38] when you see Russia fighting Ukraine or
[16:41] you see Arabs fighting Jews, you just
[16:45] think of it more in a spiritual sense.
[16:47] The whole world is headed to a to a
[16:50] situation when they and what really
[16:51] strikes me is that it's just they can't
[16:55] stop themselves. the world is headed to
[16:57] destruction and they it's like they've
[16:59] all the all the keys like in in a
[17:02] military's perspective when you've taken
[17:04] all the keys off your taken all the
[17:06] safeties out and taking all the keys out
[17:08] there's nothing to stop it the point of
[17:10] pushing the button is right there and I
[17:13] was just thinking this morning it's
[17:14] really
[17:16] really striking that the not getting
[17:19] political here but I'll I'll just finish
[17:21] with this thought
[17:24] as as an older man I'll just say this
[17:26] one thing.
[17:27] It really strikes me that people
[17:31] that have never seen what violence can
[17:33] be and what a world can look like on the
[17:36] other side are so in a hurry to get
[17:39] there this morning. And I was just
[17:41] thinking what I started with in the
[17:44] world that we live in. I was going to
[17:46] read some scriptures here this morning.
[17:48] I was going to read this other one. But
[17:50] I'll just finish with this simple
[17:52] thought here this morning. As I see the
[17:54] circumstances in our country and the
[17:56] world this morning, I can see all these
[17:58] devils in a spiritual sense fighting
[18:00] each other across the earth and I it
[18:03] just lets me know like the brothers have
[18:06] been saying the last couple of months.
[18:08] You know, it's really important that you
[18:11] get I'll finish that will you stay
[18:14] closer as you see those days coming. You
[18:16] should get you closer to the Lord this
[18:18] morning. And I'm really off my point,
[18:21] but I'll just read this is from the from
[18:24] the devotional this morning in the
[18:25] spoken word. I finished with a thought
[18:28] if I'm I don't want to be all over the
[18:30] plate as they say, but this is what and
[18:33] I was also listening to the message from
[18:35] yesterday's
[18:37] uh devotional too also and uh really
[18:41] struck me what brother Manam talks about
[18:43] this a lot. What are your intent? What
[18:46] is your intentions? What are your goals?
[18:49] what what is your purpose? And you
[18:52] really need to find that in Christ this
[18:54] morning. Once you know your purpose and
[18:56] you know your what God wants of you in
[18:58] your heart and life, it really gives you
[19:00] the grounding and the stability you need
[19:02] to be successful in life. And I'll just
[19:04] read this and sit down. I know I keep
[19:06] talking and saying I'm going to sit
[19:08] down, but this comes out of the voice of
[19:11] God in the last days. Some of you might
[19:12] have read it already this morning. And
[19:16] it it goes to what I was saying. If
[19:18] you're that lukewarm believer or that
[19:20] unbeliever or the person that thinks
[19:23] you've got another year or you got
[19:25] another week or you got another seven or
[19:27] 10 years, that's what your enemy is
[19:30] going to try to tell you. Well, I've got
[19:31] another hour or I've got another week or
[19:34] I've got another year. That's your enemy
[19:36] talking to you because God would tell
[19:38] you you need to do it right now. If
[19:41] you're just a lukewarm believer, the
[19:42] voice of God, God cries in your heart
[19:45] this morning. You are a lukewarm
[19:47] believer and you better repent. You
[19:50] know, a lot of times as younger men, you
[19:53] you push that back. I can remember being
[19:55] a young man pushing those ideas and
[19:57] those thoughts back because I had my own
[20:00] way. I wanted to do my own thing. But
[20:02] we're living in a time on the earth
[20:04] where you can't be that way anymore. I
[20:07] know a lot of younger men and younger
[20:09] women have heard older men and older
[20:10] women tell you that for generations, but
[20:14] as you see the circumstances in the
[20:16] world, we know that every day we're
[20:17] getting closer. And he goes on to say,
[20:20] you men, women, boys, or girls that are
[20:22] not living for Christ and the voice of
[20:24] God speaks to you through his word and
[20:27] says, "Stop doing that." You know,
[20:29] that's that conscience that God has
[20:31] given you that that Holy Ghost that he's
[20:33] given you and maybe that little seed
[20:35] he's given you telling you that you need
[20:37] to stop doing those bad things. Now, I
[20:41] don't know what those things are, but
[20:42] you know what those things are that
[20:44] God's dealing with you. I lost my place.
[20:47] You better do it because you're going to
[20:50] going to hear again one day. And we all
[20:53] know that and it'll condemn you. You
[20:55] know what's really important? We all, we
[20:58] don't have an excuse here in this
[21:00] assembly this morning. You have all
[21:02] heard the word of God, the message of
[21:04] the hour. You are without excuse. And he
[21:07] goes on, it'll condemn you. You can't
[21:10] deny it. It's speaking to you now. And I
[21:12] know it speaks. It's just the same for
[21:14] me. It speaks to me every day. And
[21:16] remember, it's recorded. You know,
[21:18] that's one thing that struck me as a
[21:21] young man when I started. God started
[21:23] dealing with me realizing that every
[21:26] thought I have, every idea I have,
[21:29] whatever I do, God, there's an allseeing
[21:31] eye watching you this morning. And it's
[21:34] really important that you live the
[21:36] correct life. And it goes back to what I
[21:38] originally said. Your your friends, your
[21:41] family, the people you work with,
[21:44] they're watching you also to see what
[21:46] kind of life you're going to live. And
[21:47] those who do right and hears his voice
[21:49] will rise to righteousness, to glory,
[21:52] and to heaven. And I,
[21:57] as I see the circumstances there are in
[21:59] the world, uh I know I say this a lot,
[22:03] but you know, just simply as a man, I
[22:05] know that without the help of Jesus
[22:07] Christ this morning, there's no way that
[22:10] I personally can make it happen. But if
[22:13] I take everything I am and I yield it to
[22:16] Jesus Christ this morning, I know that
[22:19] he'll make it happen because that's what
[22:21] his word told me he'll do for me.
[22:23] Brother David
[22:34] &gt;&gt; you left that.
[22:36] Amen. You love the Lord with all your
[22:38] heart this morning.
[22:40] He's so good to us, isn't he?
[22:43] Amen. Let's sing that little chorus this
[22:45] morning. I love you, Lord, and I lift my
[22:48] voice this morning.
[22:50] Amen. We truly love him this morning and
[22:52] appreciate him.
[22:57] I love
[23:00] you, Lord.
[23:04] And I live my voice
[23:12] to worship
[23:16] you,
[23:18] oh my soul,
[23:22] rejoice.
[23:25] Oh, take joy, my king,
[23:32] in
[23:33] what you hear.
[23:38] Oh, let it be a sweet,
[23:42] sweet
[23:44] song
[23:46] in your ears. Is that your desire this
[23:49] morning? once again.
[23:52] Oh, I love you, Lord,
[23:59] and I lift my voice
[24:07] to worship
[24:11] you.
[24:13] Oh my soul,
[24:17] rejoice.
[24:21] Take joy
[24:23] my king
[24:27] in
[24:29] what you hear.
[24:33] Oh, let it be a sweet,
[24:37] sweet
[24:39] sound
[24:41] in your ear
[24:46] and pleasing.
[24:51] Oh, let me be pleasing
[24:56] to you.
[24:59] Let everything

[55:54] it's just good to be in the house of the
[55:56] Lord.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; It's good to be a Christian.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[56:02] &gt;&gt; in the church age book, Brother Brandham
[56:03] says, "He hath made us," and he's
[56:07] referring back to the Revelations 1 and6
[56:09] where it says, "He hath made us kings
[56:11] and priests unto God and his father, and
[56:13] him be glory and dominion forever and
[56:15] ever. Amen."
[56:17] But he says he hath made us. He says,
[56:20] "Oh, there are certain truths that we
[56:22] need to emphasize and this is one of
[56:25] them."
[56:26] &gt;&gt; He says, "This is one of them that he he
[56:30] hath made us."
[56:33] &gt;&gt; You and me,
[56:35] &gt;&gt; the bride around the world, he hath made
[56:37] us. He said salvation is his doing.
[56:40] Salvation is of the Lord all of grace.
[56:43] But he redeemed us for a purpose.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; He bought you for a purpose.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; He says, he says, and and so we're going
[56:54] to be kings upon the earth with him when
[56:56] he sits on on his throne. But now,
[57:00] present tense, but now we are spiritual
[57:04] kings and reign over a spiritual
[57:07] kingdom. He says, it says in Romans
[57:09] 5:17, for if by one man's offense death
[57:12] reigned by one, much more they which
[57:15] receive the abundance of grace and the
[57:17] gift of righteousness shall reign in
[57:20] life by one Jesus Christ. The price was
[57:23] bought and paid for on Calvary for you,
[57:27] &gt;&gt; for your purpose.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He says in Colossians, who hath
[57:32] delivered us from the power of darkness
[57:34] and hath translated us into the kingdom,
[57:37] which means reign
[57:39] of of his dear son. Right now we reign
[57:44] with Christ.
[57:48] Think about that. Right now we reign
[57:52] with Christ. He says, "And with that we
[57:55] having dominion over sin."
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, everything that Christ was. If
[58:00] you're reigning with him, you've got it,
[58:02] too.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; He says, "So he we're having dominion
[58:06] over sin. We're having dominion over the
[58:08] world.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; We're having dominion over the flesh."
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; You know that guy that you know that guy
[58:15] and that gal that woke up this morning
[58:17] and said this and that and the other and
[58:21] &gt;&gt; you've got dominion over that flesh.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; And he says you've got dominion and over
[58:27] the devil.
[58:30] So you've got dominion over. You don't
[58:32] have to fall for his lies anymore. You
[58:35] don't have to listen to him and his
[58:37] tricks. You don't have to listen to him
[58:39] and his folly when he tells you you're
[58:41] not good enough. You can't make it.
[58:43] You're not bride. Those are lies and
[58:45] tricks of the devil. And you have been
[58:47] given domain, dominion
[58:52] &gt;&gt; over his lies, over his tricks. When he
[58:56] says you're not going to make it, when
[58:58] he says you're going to fail,
[59:00] get thee behind me, Satan. Do you see
[59:03] where the word comes into play? We've
[59:05] been shown all the tricks of the trade.
[59:08] Our father was a craftsman. He was a
[59:10] carpenter. He knew all the tricks of the
[59:11] trade. And he laid it out word for word
[59:14] for word in the Bible so that we would
[59:16] have the the ability to have the
[59:18] dominion over what Satan throws at us.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; It's simple.
[59:24] Yes, indeed. Even now we are seated in
[59:27] heavenly places. He says he's showing
[59:29] forth his praise and glory, showing
[59:31] forth himself for it is Christ in us.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; And as long as we keep that at the
[59:38] forefront that it's Christ in us, it's
[59:41] not us manufacturing. It's not us doing.
[59:43] It's not because we study. It's not
[59:45] because we we do this or that. It's
[59:47] because we were predestined before the
[59:49] foundation of the world
[59:52] &gt;&gt; for a purpose.
[59:54] Let's read in Genesis 3:14 and 15.
[59:58] I want you to notice here God setting
[1:00:00] some things in order. We know the scene.
[1:00:03] We know the scenario. We know what's
[1:00:05] happened in the garden here.
[1:00:07] And so now God's coming down to set some
[1:00:10] things in order and take back, should we
[1:00:13] say, what the enemy stole.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; He went to the enemy's camp and he took
[1:00:17] back what he stole from him.
[1:00:21] Some of us need to get in our minds that
[1:00:23] we're going to go down to the enemy's
[1:00:24] camp today and we're going to take back
[1:00:27] what he's stolen from us.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; So, if you're sitting here depressed,
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; take it back. If you're sitting here
[1:00:36] full of anxiety and fear and doubt, go
[1:00:39] down to the enemy's camp and take it
[1:00:42] back because the order has been placed.
[1:00:44] Listen what he says. The Lord God said
[1:00:46] unto the serpent, because thou hast done
[1:00:50] this, thou art cursed above all cattle,
[1:00:52] and above every beast of the field, and
[1:00:54] upon thy belly thou shalt go, and dust
[1:00:58] shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.
[1:01:00] Now, that's putting somebody in his
[1:01:02] place.
[1:01:04] How many of you has got the devil under
[1:01:05] your foot?
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:01:10] And I will put enmity.
[1:01:13] You know what that means? That means
[1:01:16] an opposition
[1:01:18] that you're actively opposed in a
[1:01:20] hostile situation.
[1:01:22] So in other words, this is a mutual
[1:01:24] agreement. Devil, I don't like you and
[1:01:27] you don't like me.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Does anybody in here like him?
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; No. I think we're all in agreeance with
[1:01:33] that. We don't have no time for you in
[1:01:35] our lives, devil. So let me tell you
[1:01:37] what the ground rules say. Here's what
[1:01:40] the ground rules are in our
[1:01:41] relationship.
[1:01:43] I will put enmity between thee and the
[1:01:45] woman and between thy seed and her seed.
[1:01:48] It shall bruise thy head
[1:01:53] and thy shall bruise his heel. And I
[1:01:57] want to take my thought from it shall
[1:01:58] bruise thy head. And we're going to
[1:02:00] speak this morning on serpent slayers.
[1:02:04] Serpent slayers. And as we'll continue
[1:02:06] with some of our church age thought and
[1:02:08] if this would be a part five, serpent
[1:02:10] slayers, let's just bow our heads.
[1:02:12] Heavenly Father, we come before you this
[1:02:14] morning with grateful hearts. Thankful,
[1:02:16] Lord, for all that you do in our lives
[1:02:17] and for your grace and your mercy and
[1:02:20] and and the longsuffering you've had for
[1:02:22] your people, Lord Jesus, to help us all
[1:02:24] get time to get ourselves right and
[1:02:26] ready and for the word as it's going
[1:02:28] forth in this hour. And we see great
[1:02:30] things happening in the kingdom of God,
[1:02:32] Lord. and we just want to keep keep
[1:02:34] doing our part and pushing and doing
[1:02:36] what you would have us to do in the hour
[1:02:38] we're living in. Because as the word has
[1:02:40] told us and as our prophet has told us,
[1:02:42] we were born for a purpose. We were
[1:02:43] bought for a purpose and things have
[1:02:46] been set in order that we could be an
[1:02:48] active group of people, an active group
[1:02:51] of followers in Jesus's Christ ministry
[1:02:54] in this last day. So Lord, I ask that
[1:02:56] you bless the service today. Bless the
[1:02:58] words. Allow me to get myself out of the
[1:03:00] way and you just have preeminence and
[1:03:02] take full control over the situation. If
[1:03:04] there's any hindering spirits here,
[1:03:06] Lord, we rebuke them in the name of the
[1:03:08] Lord Jesus Christ. And we pray for this
[1:03:11] in your precious name. In the name of
[1:03:13] Jesus Christ. Amen. You can have your
[1:03:15] seats this morning.
[1:03:20] I'm going to
[1:03:22] look at this. I got this got this new
[1:03:24] gadget.
[1:03:27] Uhoh, that ain't the right one. Let me
[1:03:29] get this thing right. I'm playing this
[1:03:30] morning with this gadget. I set myself a
[1:03:34] timer because I lose track of time. So,
[1:03:37] this will tell me when we're at three
[1:03:38] hours.
[1:03:41] Just kidding.
[1:03:43] But we're talking about here serpent
[1:03:45] slayers. And I'm going to take my time
[1:03:48] and just kind of go through this and and
[1:03:50] if we have to break it down, we will.
[1:03:51] But I want to try to get to the end if
[1:03:53] we can and and just try to try to build
[1:03:55] upon what we we got coming up in the
[1:03:57] future here. Brother Brandon was talking
[1:03:59] about in the message the masterpiece.
[1:04:02] And he's speaking in the message
[1:04:03] masterpiece. And he's talking about God.
[1:04:05] And he said God has has been hewing down
[1:04:08] and hewing away by the patriarchs down
[1:04:11] through time and made his platform. And
[1:04:14] he brings them and he lays down a
[1:04:16] foundation upon these patriarchs. And he
[1:04:18] said he be to build upon his word. the
[1:04:21] prophets and he said finally he comes
[1:04:23] out there a and he finds the perfect
[1:04:26] prophet the perfect foundation the
[1:04:28] perfect vision that God has. Now you
[1:04:30] know if you know anything about the
[1:04:31] message you know he's talking about the
[1:04:33] masterpiece and he's talking about the
[1:04:34] statue and so now he's talking about
[1:04:37] Jesus coming onto the scene and he says
[1:04:40] in order for him to speak because he is
[1:04:42] the word and in order for him to speak
[1:04:46] he has to it has to come in that image.
[1:04:48] We know what Jesus image is. And so he
[1:04:51] says in order for the image to speak, it
[1:04:53] has to be smitten.
[1:04:55] There had to be a Calvary. There had to
[1:04:58] be a Calvary where he could come onto
[1:05:00] the scene. So that so that basically
[1:05:02] what we're looking at here is Jesus had
[1:05:04] to take back the dominion by going to
[1:05:07] Calvary. And his act on Calvary was his
[1:05:10] words made manifest.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; He saw you in the beginning.
[1:05:18] He knew we would need a redeemer.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; He knew he was the perfect image. He
[1:05:23] knew he was the perfect word. He knew he
[1:05:25] was everything we had need of. And in
[1:05:28] order for it to happen, he had to be
[1:05:29] smitten. There had to be something to
[1:05:31] take place. And the prophet begins to
[1:05:33] bring this down. And he talks about this
[1:05:35] when he talks about those Chinamen. Do
[1:05:38] you remember him talking about the
[1:05:39] Chinese men?
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; And he talks about the laundrymen. He
[1:05:43] says, "You know, they first started
[1:05:44] coming in and and they come into the
[1:05:46] West Coast and made their way across the
[1:05:48] East Coast." And he said, "The one thing
[1:05:50] they he" He said, "They couldn't speak
[1:05:51] English. They couldn't talk. They
[1:05:53] couldn't communicate."
[1:05:56] He said, "But they could do laundry."
[1:05:59] He said, "They were good at doing
[1:06:00] laundry." And he said the problem was,
[1:06:03] basically the problem was they didn't
[1:06:04] know how to write a ticket in English to
[1:06:06] say this is your laundry or this is your
[1:06:08] laundry. So when you would come back,
[1:06:10] they had no way of communication. And he
[1:06:12] said, 'But what they had was actually
[1:06:14] better than a written ticket. What they
[1:06:17] had was actually better than a written
[1:06:19] ticket. He said they would take this
[1:06:20] little piece of a card
[1:06:24] and he said they would take this card,
[1:06:26] you would bring them your laundry, they
[1:06:27] would take this card and they would tear
[1:06:29] this card.
[1:06:32] Come here. Come here, brother. Brother
[1:06:33] MJ,
[1:06:36] you're dropping off your dirty laundry
[1:06:38] today. Okay. All right. You You hold on
[1:06:40] to that. All right, I'll call you in a
[1:06:43] couple weeks if we get it done.
[1:06:47] And he said that they would they would
[1:06:49] have that card. They would tear that
[1:06:51] card. And he said they would one would
[1:06:53] keep one piece and one would keep the
[1:06:55] other. And he said it's better than what
[1:06:57] we have now because you have to have
[1:06:59] both pieces,
[1:07:02] both pieces of the puzzle to claim
[1:07:04] what's rightfully yours.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; He had to have one. You've got to have
[1:07:09] one. And he says there it must dovetail
[1:07:12] together and you could not impersonate
[1:07:14] it.
[1:07:15] You see, you could write a letter and
[1:07:17] say, "Oh, this is my laundry." If you've
[1:07:18] seen somebody come in there with a bunch
[1:07:20] of designer clothing, you think, "Man, I
[1:07:22] wish that was mine. I'm going to write
[1:07:23] me a ticket up and tell them this is my
[1:07:24] laundry." That's not the way it worked.
[1:07:26] They had to have the ticket in hand. And
[1:07:30] he said, "Here it was." He said, "They
[1:07:31] couldn't c they could copy them letters,
[1:07:34] but they could not impersonate that
[1:07:36] tear." And he said as they begin to take
[1:07:38] that ticket and he said God by his
[1:07:41] prophets under the laws condemned us to
[1:07:43] sin. Now think about this. God through
[1:07:46] the prophets by the law condemned us to
[1:07:49] sin and law has no grace.
[1:07:54] Do you realize none of us can make it by
[1:07:56] the law?
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; There would be no use for us even having
[1:08:03] a church service if we lived under law.
[1:08:06] Because I don't know about you, but
[1:08:08] myself, I I sometimes I find myself in a
[1:08:12] fault.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; In other words, I'm breaking the law.
[1:08:23] Ask my wife. She's got pictures.
[1:08:31] We uh was headed to Murphy'sboro last
[1:08:34] Wednesday, two Wednesdays ago.
[1:08:37] And you know if any anything you know
[1:08:39] about Nashville traffic
[1:08:42] on a weekday at quitting time our hour
[1:08:45] and 40 minute drive was was pegging out
[1:08:49] in the GPS at 2 hours and 50 minutes.
[1:08:53] She said we need to go the back way.
[1:08:56] I thought she said we need to go the
[1:08:58] speedway.
[1:09:00] That's not what she said.
[1:09:04] But I knew we were going to be looking
[1:09:05] at time was going to be of the essence.
[1:09:08] And by the law, I failed.
[1:09:13] I was in a hurry.
[1:09:16] Well, look at you angels.
[1:09:21] Praise you.
[1:09:24] So the on the back roads, I'm thinking I
[1:09:27] can make up some time,
[1:09:30] right? Nobody's on these roads. As far
[1:09:33] as you can see, nobody fields on both
[1:09:36] sides. Only thing I got to watch is for
[1:09:37] a crazy deer to run out from the
[1:09:39] cornfield.
[1:09:42] Top the hill, blue lights. They shut
[1:09:45] off. I said, "Oh, thank you." He's not
[1:09:46] He's just warning me. No.
[1:09:52] He turned them back on. Come on out. I I
[1:09:54] I slowed down real quick.
[1:09:59] You know what he's his This was his this
[1:10:00] was his words. He come up. I rode the
[1:10:02] window down and I'm sitting there
[1:10:04] dressed just pretty much like I am right
[1:10:06] now and he said, "Is there a legal
[1:10:09] reason why you're doing I ain't going to
[1:10:12] tell you half this and this?
[1:10:16] Is there a legal reason why you're doing
[1:10:19] this speed in this zone?" I'll put it to
[1:10:21] you that way.
[1:10:23] I said, "No, sir. There is absolutely no
[1:10:26] excuse whatsoever legally. I I shouldn't
[1:10:28] be doing it." He said, 'Where in the
[1:10:31] world are you going?' I said, 'I don't
[1:10:33] even want to tell you.
[1:10:39] I said, 'But I'm actually going to a
[1:10:41] service to preach tonight. He went.
[1:10:45] First time I ever seen me deflate a cop.
[1:10:49] He said, "Let me see your stuff. Let me
[1:10:51] see your your your license, this, that,
[1:10:52] and the other." So, we gave it to him
[1:10:53] and he comes back and he says, "Where
[1:10:57] you got to be?" I said, "I got to be in
[1:10:58] Murphy'sboro at 7 o'clock. That's why
[1:10:59] I'm in a hurry.
[1:11:01] He said, "You ain't going to make it."
[1:11:03] He said, "And don't think you're going
[1:11:04] to be hurrying through Robertson County
[1:11:06] cuz you're not." I said, "You're right.
[1:11:09] I will keep it at the speed limit." And
[1:11:11] I did. But he said, "Is there legally?
[1:11:14] Is there a reason?" You see, he had
[1:11:17] every right in the world to write me a
[1:11:19] ticket. He had every right to to to put
[1:11:22] me put No, he couldn't put me in
[1:11:24] handcuffs. I don't think I wasn't going
[1:11:25] that fast. But he had every right to
[1:11:28] write me a ticket, to cite me, give me a
[1:11:31] citation, tell me I got to go to court,
[1:11:32] tell me I got to pay a fine. And that's
[1:11:35] what has exactly happened here. He says
[1:11:38] the the law has no grace. Thankfully, he
[1:11:40] had grace. He said, "But it tells you
[1:11:42] you're a sinner. The law tells you
[1:11:45] you've done wrong. The law tells you."
[1:11:48] He said, "But when Jesus came on the
[1:11:50] scene, when Jesus come on the scene,
[1:11:54] law had no dominion anymore because by
[1:11:57] the grace, by the mercy that Jesus shed
[1:12:00] and the blood shed on Calvary, now he's
[1:12:03] on the scene and he was perfect."
[1:12:06] He said he was the identical image of
[1:12:09] the promise. Therefore, the promise of
[1:12:11] the Old Testament was met in Jesus
[1:12:13] Christ. It couldn't be met in Moses.
[1:12:15] Moses, like me and you, he made
[1:12:17] mistakes.
[1:12:19] But now that Jesus is on the scene, he
[1:12:21] says the the the the church will have to
[1:12:24] so match everything that God has
[1:12:26] promised and it must be the piece that's
[1:12:29] smitten off of it. So if the original,
[1:12:32] listen to this. So if the original is
[1:12:34] the word,
[1:12:36] so its subjects or believers,
[1:12:40] Christians, whatever you want to say, he
[1:12:42] says, "So its subjects that must be
[1:12:44] taken from it will be the word and match
[1:12:48] its side."
[1:12:53] Are you with me? Where the law condemns
[1:12:56] you, the law says you're dirty. He says
[1:13:00] the law says you're guilty. The law puts
[1:13:03] you in prison, but when he came, he was
[1:13:05] a matchpiece. And I like how he brought
[1:13:07] that out. He didn't say masterpiece, the
[1:13:10] matchpiece.
[1:13:12] He was the matchpiece in your life. He
[1:13:15] could bring you back to complete the
[1:13:18] ticket, the redemption that God had
[1:13:20] promised back in the Garden of Eden.
[1:13:24] He said when he said that thy seed that
[1:13:27] shall bruise the serpent's head.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Oh this is good.
[1:13:34] He says now we find that this perfect
[1:13:37] masterpiece that God has completed. We
[1:13:40] now notice that it was all the promise
[1:13:42] he had to be. He said and all the
[1:13:44] prophecies everything that God had made
[1:13:47] a promise of thy seed shall bruise the
[1:13:49] serpent's head. Now, he could not bruise
[1:13:52] it with law.
[1:13:55] Did you think about that? He couldn't
[1:13:58] bruise it with law because law brings
[1:14:00] punishment.
[1:14:05] He couldn't do it with law. He could
[1:14:08] only He could not bruise it with the
[1:14:09] prophets.
[1:14:11] They made mistakes.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; They were they were fallible.
[1:14:16] He couldn't do it with the prophets. So
[1:14:18] he did it when the woman's seed became
[1:14:20] the masterpiece Christ. He was the stone
[1:14:24] that Daniel saw hwn out of the mountain.
[1:14:26] He was the one that that could smite. He
[1:14:28] was the one that could bruise the
[1:14:30] serpent's head. His life matched exactly
[1:14:33] the life of Moses and David. But here's
[1:14:36] the thing.
[1:14:39] Redemption day.
[1:14:46] What'd you do?
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; The dirty, filthy clothes
[1:14:55] are no more.
[1:14:58] Why? Because I had a ticket in my hand.
[1:15:01] He had a ticket in his hand and said, "I
[1:15:03] don't have to live filthy and dirty and
[1:15:05] polluted anymore." Because Christ that
[1:15:07] went away in heaven and me down here, I
[1:15:10] was still on his mind. And the ticket
[1:15:13] came together and said, "Redeemed,
[1:15:15] [Applause]
[1:15:21] church age book, the key given me of the
[1:15:24] Lord." Now, this is brother Brandon a
[1:15:26] and the author writing. Can I I'm going
[1:15:29] to stop here because I I listened back
[1:15:31] to Brother Joe's message, Brother Joe
[1:15:32] Adams, and he I heard him mention the
[1:15:34] church age book. and and the church age
[1:15:36] book for some of you may not realize
[1:15:38] that it was not actually preached
[1:15:40] messages in the book. Brother Brandham
[1:15:43] preached the messages and then the book
[1:15:46] was compiled and called an exposition
[1:15:50] and this exposition was written by
[1:15:52] brother Lee Vale. Now that's been quite
[1:15:54] a controversy down through the time.
[1:15:57] It's not a problem with me because I can
[1:15:59] take the book, the church age exposition
[1:16:02] book, and I can line it up with all the
[1:16:04] messages that was preached.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; But I is it okay if I share this,
[1:16:09] brother Joe? Your story. Brother Joe, he
[1:16:12] he told me a story and brother Ber and
[1:16:14] and this is not in my notes. It just
[1:16:15] comes to me. But I want to clear up some
[1:16:17] error. And if this is wrong, well, talk
[1:16:20] to brother Joe.
[1:16:23] He said talk to him.
[1:16:26] But years ago, Brother Joe had a farm
[1:16:28] and it was a hunting farm and and and
[1:16:30] people would come in and visit. Well,
[1:16:32] Brother George Smith come in to visit
[1:16:35] and and he was hunting and he was and he
[1:16:37] was with Brother Joe and they were
[1:16:38] riding through the through Does
[1:16:40] everybody know who Brother George Smith
[1:16:41] is? Brother Brandham's son-in-law.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Okay. So he he's riding through the
[1:16:46] through the through the woods and
[1:16:48] through the fields and they're talking
[1:16:49] and this well brother Joe's got
[1:16:51] something burning on his heart because
[1:16:53] he's always he at that point had a had a
[1:16:55] little bit of a problem with the church
[1:16:56] age book. Is that right? Leave veil and
[1:17:00] the church age book.
[1:17:03] So he asked brother George he said what
[1:17:06] about the church age book being written
[1:17:07] by Lee Vale? And he said well let me
[1:17:10] tell you how this went. He said, "The
[1:17:12] manuscripts come in to brother
[1:17:14] Brandham."
[1:17:16] And brother George Smith said that the
[1:17:18] manuscripts come into Brother Brandham.
[1:17:19] And brother Brandham called him up and
[1:17:20] said, "Brother George, let's go for a
[1:17:22] ride."
[1:17:23] And he said they were just right. He
[1:17:24] said he would do that from time to time
[1:17:27] and just want to go ride just to kind of
[1:17:28] get away and relax and get away. And he
[1:17:30] said he had the manuscripts in the car.
[1:17:32] Is this right? And he said he had the
[1:17:35] manuscripts in the car and he said,
[1:17:36] "I've got to go through this book, this
[1:17:40] church age book to make sure it's
[1:17:41] right." He said, "Would you pull it out
[1:17:43] of the envelope or whatever it was in?"
[1:17:45] And he said, "Now, if you'll just thumb
[1:17:47] through it."
[1:17:50] So, Brother George just started thumbing
[1:17:52] through it like you would through the
[1:17:53] leaves of paper. You know what I mean?
[1:17:55] And Brother Bam will say, "Stop.
[1:17:57] That needs to be corrected. Make a note
[1:17:59] right there."
[1:18:01] And he said he would thumb through it
[1:18:02] again and say, "Stop. That right there
[1:18:05] needs to be corrected. Make a note right
[1:18:06] there. That's not right." And he said
[1:18:08] they rode around and went through that
[1:18:10] book thumbing him thumbing through the
[1:18:12] pages and him being able through the
[1:18:14] eyes of a prophet be able to see exactly
[1:18:16] where it needed to stop, the corrections
[1:18:18] that needed to be made. Now, this is not
[1:18:19] gospel. I I didn't witness it. Brother
[1:18:21] Joe didn't witness this. This is and I
[1:18:23] hate to say this is hearsay, but it was
[1:18:25] a witness there
[1:18:28] and said, "That's the way that this book
[1:18:30] was edited.
[1:18:32] Now that's looking through the eyes of a
[1:18:33] prophet.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; But he says the key given me of the
[1:18:39] Lord. And the reason I said that is
[1:18:41] because when you read the church age
[1:18:42] book, it's you notice it's not it's not
[1:18:44] in preached form.
[1:18:47] The verbiage is different. What's that
[1:18:50] word? The vernacular is different.
[1:18:54] We learned that word.
[1:18:59] But he says the key given me of the Lord
[1:19:01] whereby I was able to determine the
[1:19:02] messenger for each age is almost is the
[1:19:05] most scriptural one. In fact, it might
[1:19:08] be called the keystone of the Bible. It
[1:19:10] is the revelation that God never
[1:19:13] changes.
[1:19:15] Are you with me? Let's get back on track
[1:19:18] here. And his ways are as unchangeable
[1:19:21] as he is. Here it is. An unchanging God
[1:19:26] with unchanging ways. what he did at the
[1:19:29] first, he will have to keep doing until
[1:19:31] it's done for the last time.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; There's no stopping point with God until
[1:19:38] this age is over, until we rapture out
[1:19:40] of here.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; The things that he did in the first
[1:19:43] church age,
[1:19:45] the original church, has got to be done
[1:19:47] today in this hour.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; There will never be a change. Apply that
[1:19:55] to the church ages. He said it. Why do
[1:19:58] people want to debate it? Apply that to
[1:20:01] the church ages. He says that's that
[1:20:03] kind of man that God chose for the first
[1:20:06] age and how God manifested in that man's
[1:20:09] ministry would be the example for all
[1:20:12] other ages. So what God did in that
[1:20:15] first church age is what he wants to do
[1:20:17] in all other ages.
[1:20:22] You know, I always as a young believer,
[1:20:24] as a young message believer and student
[1:20:25] of the of the of the message, I always
[1:20:28] wondered why all these guys had their
[1:20:30] own message.
[1:20:32] Paul, Ireneius, Martin, Columbus,
[1:20:34] Luther, Wesley. But then you get up
[1:20:36] there, they all had their own me, their
[1:20:38] own message, their own reformation,
[1:20:39] their own things that was happening. And
[1:20:41] brother Brandon gets up and he says, "I
[1:20:43] only preach what Paul preaches."
[1:20:48] And it took a revelation for me to
[1:20:50] figure out he's only preaching what Paul
[1:20:51] preaches because Paul preached the
[1:20:53] original word and the faith and the the
[1:20:56] messenger in this last age has to take
[1:20:58] the faith of the of the children back to
[1:21:00] the fathers.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; So it's a it's a restoration message and
[1:21:04] he's taken us back to the exact true
[1:21:08] word as God delivered it in the first
[1:21:10] church age at the day of Pentecost.
[1:21:18] He says that word can't change or be
[1:21:20] changed because the word is God. In the
[1:21:23] beginning was the word. The word was was
[1:21:25] with God and the word was God. To change
[1:21:27] one word of it as Eve did, we already
[1:21:31] been down that road. We seen what that
[1:21:32] produced.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; It produced a calvary.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; And he says, and if we change one word
[1:21:40] as Eve did, it brings in sin. It brings
[1:21:42] in death. It brings in as Revelations.
[1:21:45] It says, "If any man add unto these
[1:21:47] things, God shall add unto him plagues."
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be living in a message
[1:21:54] full of plagues. I'm living in a message
[1:21:57] full of deliverance, full of victory,
[1:22:00] full of overcoming power, not plagues.
[1:22:03] That's how come he said, "I only
[1:22:05] preached what Paul preached."
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; So that's why I only preach what brother
[1:22:10] Brandham preached. Because if he can
[1:22:11] preach it, I can preach it. Amen.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; We were talking the other day in prayer
[1:22:20] meeting back there and I said, you know,
[1:22:21] we were talking about and please don't
[1:22:23] don't th don't keep your stones in your
[1:22:25] bags. Okay?
[1:22:29] But a lot of us, me included, like to
[1:22:31] listen to other ministers around the
[1:22:33] message.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; There there's nothing wrong with that.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; I got I got I got my favorites, too.
[1:22:43] And we like to listen those messages.
[1:22:44] But when I found out in my life when I'm
[1:22:48] listening to other ministers more than
[1:22:50] I'm listening to the messenger of the
[1:22:52] hour.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, why y'all so quiet?
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; I find out that that don't work out too
[1:23:03] well for me
[1:23:06] because it's his message that God gave
[1:23:09] him in this hour. Now, I love all these
[1:23:11] brothers. Don't get me wrong, I listen
[1:23:13] to them. But I I tell you that the first
[1:23:15] hour that I listen to on most days is an
[1:23:17] hour's worth of the message
[1:23:20] and then I listen to others.
[1:23:24] Man, I got to move. Brother Ber, they
[1:23:27] they digging around,
[1:23:30] squirming,
[1:23:33] squirming.
[1:23:35] But if any man shall add unto these
[1:23:37] things, God shall add plagues. And if
[1:23:39] any man shall take away from the words
[1:23:41] of the book of prophecy, God shall take
[1:23:43] away his part out of the book of life,
[1:23:45] out of the holy city, from the things
[1:23:47] which are written in this book. Thus,
[1:23:49] what the church was at Pentecost
[1:23:52] is the standard.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; You want to know how we're supposed to
[1:23:57] live?
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Study the book of Acts and study the day
[1:24:00] of Pentecost. I'm not talking about
[1:24:02] Isuza Street. I'm talking about the
[1:24:05] forefathers.
[1:24:07] When the Holy Ghost fell in that upper
[1:24:09] room chamber and they were baptized with
[1:24:11] the Holy Ghost,
[1:24:14] the Holy Ghost made them do things that
[1:24:16] me and you should be doing in this hour.
[1:24:20] Signs and wonders and things taking
[1:24:22] place.
[1:24:24] The church of Pentecost is a standard.
[1:24:27] That is the pattern. There is no other
[1:24:31] pattern.
[1:24:35] Well, I think if we do it this way, we
[1:24:38] can still fit it into the message.
[1:24:41] If we start, if we allow this, it'll
[1:24:44] draw more people, but we can still
[1:24:46] overshadow it with the message over
[1:24:47] here. Come on, church.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; He either said it or he didn't.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; We either believe it or we don't.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; We either live it or we don't.
[1:25:00] Thus, there is no other pattern. No
[1:25:03] matter what scholars say, God has not
[1:25:06] changed that pattern.
[1:25:09] What God did at Pentecost, he has has to
[1:25:12] keep on doing until the church age
[1:25:15] closes.
[1:25:20] What did they do after the day of
[1:25:22] Pentecost?
[1:25:25] Signs.
[1:25:27] You know, the Pentecostals want to say,
[1:25:29] "Well, they spoke in tongues, they
[1:25:30] danced, they shouted, and man, they had
[1:25:32] a jubilee."
[1:25:35] And they did,
[1:25:37] and we do, and we like it. But what's
[1:25:41] more important to me to be able to get
[1:25:43] up here and dance in the spirit and
[1:25:45] shout or to go and witness to somebody
[1:25:47] and see them give their heart to the
[1:25:48] Lord? Amen.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; What's more important for me to go and
[1:25:52] lay hands on somebody who's been sick
[1:25:54] and to see them recover and to see them
[1:25:56] to get well or to shout and speak in
[1:25:58] tongues?
[1:26:01] I think my mic's off. Brothers,
[1:26:06] what's more important? He says, "Scars
[1:26:09] will tell you that the apostolic age is
[1:26:12] over.
[1:26:13] Don't you believe it.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Don't you believe it. Such a statement
[1:26:19] is wrong. He says Peter said repent and
[1:26:22] be baptized every one of you in the name
[1:26:24] of Jesus Christ for remission of sins
[1:26:26] and you shall what?
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Receive what? The gift of what? The Holy
[1:26:31] Ghost.
[1:26:35] I need the Holy Ghost.
[1:26:38] You need the Holy Ghost. We need a
[1:26:41] governor in our life or we go around
[1:26:44] breaking rules all over the place.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Without the Holy Ghost, we're
[1:26:48] whoreongers.
[1:26:51] Without the Holy Ghost, we're drunkards.
[1:26:54] Without the Holy Ghost, we're drug
[1:26:56] addicts.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Do you see the importance?
[1:27:02] What the church had at Pentecost is her
[1:27:06] inalienable rights.
[1:27:11] inalienable rights.
[1:27:15] If you don't know what that word is, it
[1:27:16] means the fundamental rights that are
[1:27:18] impossible to take away.
[1:27:22] It's impossible to take away. You need
[1:27:26] healing, that is an inalienable right
[1:27:28] that you have.
[1:27:31] You need salvation, that is an
[1:27:33] inalienable right that you have. You
[1:27:35] need deliverance over a habit. That is
[1:27:37] an inalien of a right that you have
[1:27:40] because Calvary was for you.
[1:27:50] I like this part. That original church
[1:27:53] was not organized by men.
[1:28:00] Amen. Amen.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Because you know what man's idea does?
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; It fails.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; That early church was not organized by
[1:28:12] men. They didn't get up there and Peter
[1:28:13] say, "Now listen, Jesus has gone off the
[1:28:15] scene. So, let me tell you what we're
[1:28:17] going to do." He may have been the rock,
[1:28:20] but he he wasn't the Holy Ghost at that
[1:28:22] time.
[1:28:24] He didn't have it at that time. He was
[1:28:26] up there waiting like the rest of them.
[1:28:30] Well, I think they didn't set up and
[1:28:31] say, "Well, I think if since Jesus done
[1:28:33] it this way, maybe we should go out
[1:28:35] there and do this." You know, there was
[1:28:37] what, seven sons ofKeva. Where was that
[1:28:39] that story? Now, I didn't study this up,
[1:28:41] so I might be a little bit need to brush
[1:28:43] the edges off and chip it away a little
[1:28:45] bit. But they thought they could go do
[1:28:46] something.
[1:28:49] They were going to try to do something
[1:28:50] in the name of Jesus. They didn't know
[1:28:51] who Jesus was.
[1:28:54] And then and that spirit come out and he
[1:28:56] said, "Let me ask you something." He
[1:28:58] said I think he said Peter Jesus I know
[1:29:00] Peter I know but who are you?
[1:29:04] Who are you?
[1:29:06] So we have to be careful with that. But
[1:29:09] under the anointing of the Holy Ghost it
[1:29:11] says we will have manifested and signs
[1:29:14] and wonders and the gifts of the Holy
[1:29:17] Ghost. That original church was not
[1:29:19] organized by men. It was led by the Holy
[1:29:22] Ghost.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; It wasn't very big.
[1:29:30] Man, I tell you what, when I was I I get
[1:29:31] tired. I only dream just a few few times
[1:29:34] a year.
[1:29:36] And I guess I was just wore out this
[1:29:38] morning and I fell into asleep in a
[1:29:40] dream. Brother Ber, take it for what you
[1:29:43] want. There was a thousand newcomers to
[1:29:46] this church.
[1:29:48] They they stand outside and said, "I
[1:29:50] don't know where we going to sit." I
[1:29:51] said, "I don't either. We got a balcony.
[1:29:55] Amen.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; I probably shouldn't even said that.
[1:30:00] Forgive me. I'm checking myself on that.
[1:30:01] It's just a It's just a dream. Okay.
[1:30:06] But he said it wasn't very big.
[1:30:11] It was liked by everybody. No, it was
[1:30:14] hated. It was despised.
[1:30:18] It was persecuted unto the death. But it
[1:30:22] was a true to God.
[1:30:24] No matter what the hardships, no matter
[1:30:26] the persecutions, they were true to God.
[1:30:30] They were stoned. They were bowled. They
[1:30:32] were hung upside down. But they were
[1:30:34] true to the word of God. That's the
[1:30:37] original church. It stayed with the
[1:30:39] original word pattern.
[1:30:50] Watch this.
[1:30:52] This this this is in a different message
[1:30:53] here. God was showing himself in this on
[1:30:58] the sacrifices.
[1:31:00] He's speaking of Christ.
[1:31:02] He said he God took Jesus to the Calvary
[1:31:06] and tore him apart.
[1:31:10] Tore him apart.
[1:31:12] He said he tore him apart
[1:31:15] and he received the body up into heaven
[1:31:19] and sent the spirit back down upon us.
[1:31:24] That same spirit that was on him has to
[1:31:28] be on you and dovetail to be the bride
[1:31:32] at the end time.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Same spirit. He said that's right. See,
[1:31:39] it won't be a denomination. It'll be the
[1:31:41] word. That's what he was. And it's like
[1:31:44] the word has to come to word like in a
[1:31:47] human being. He said, you know, your
[1:31:50] body is built upon cells.
[1:31:53] And he had such a way to explain science
[1:31:55] that science can't explain itself. He
[1:31:58] said, in the human body, there was cell
[1:31:59] built upon cell upon sale upon sale. He
[1:32:02] said it wasn't a human cell and then the
[1:32:04] next cell built on there, a dog or the
[1:32:06] next sale of a pig. No, it was a human
[1:32:10] cell. And he said it was built on top of
[1:32:12] each other, cell after cell. And you
[1:32:14] know, I seen a study the other day and I
[1:32:15] thought it was the greatest one of the
[1:32:17] greatest scientific uh uh uh scientific
[1:32:22] it wasn't a study
[1:32:24] discoveries
[1:32:27] of all time.
[1:32:29] When I read this, I thought here's where
[1:32:31] it comes into play. You know, you were
[1:32:33] in the mind of Christ before the
[1:32:34] foundation of the world. You were
[1:32:37] predestinated.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; And if you were predestinated and you
[1:32:40] were in the mind of Christ, there had to
[1:32:42] be life in you.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; There had to be a light. Light is life,
[1:32:46] right? So science has now seen inside
[1:32:50] the womb of a woman
[1:32:53] and can see the egg
[1:32:56] of the woman and the life cell, the
[1:32:59] sperm of the male.
[1:33:01] And they've got it so precise now that
[1:33:03] they can see that when that one hits
[1:33:06] that egg and at the moment of contact,
[1:33:09] there's a spark of light.
[1:33:15] Somebody ought to be shouting
[1:33:18] because that tells us that right there
[1:33:20] at that very moment, the very thought of
[1:33:23] God says right there is the very life of
[1:33:25] of God coming down into that egg through
[1:33:28] that sperm cell, that life gene.
[1:33:31] and sell upon sale, he said. And that's
[1:33:33] the way it is in the body of Christ.
[1:33:35] It's all the word of God, not just part
[1:33:38] of it.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; All of it.
[1:33:43] Not just a little cell over here, a
[1:33:45] little cell over there. It's all that
[1:33:47] God was. It was salvation. It was
[1:33:50] healing. It's deliverance. It's all
[1:33:52] these things that he was.
[1:33:56] Brothers and sisters, that's the way
[1:33:57] it'll be in the last days. That's the
[1:34:00] way it'll be in the last day. That all
[1:34:01] that Christ was, the bride, will be also
[1:34:05] because Jesus plainly tells us, "The
[1:34:07] very works that I do,
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; shall you do also."
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; We cut ourselves short.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; We cut ourselves short. Listen to this.
[1:34:22] This is a direct quote from the Pergamin
[1:34:24] church age. When the bride will get back
[1:34:27] to being a word bride,
[1:34:32] you want to know what the next statement
[1:34:33] is? She will produce the very works that
[1:34:37] Jesus produced.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; When she gets back to being the word
[1:34:46] bride, in other words, she takes this
[1:34:48] word and she begins to eat it and eat it
[1:34:50] and eat it and eat it. That's right. And
[1:34:54] then because she's eating it and eating
[1:34:55] it and eating, then she begins to live
[1:34:57] it and live it and live it. And then
[1:34:59] when she's living it, she begins to give
[1:35:01] it and give it and give it.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Do you see how this cycle works?
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; She will be a work uh she will produce
[1:35:09] the very works that Jesus produced.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, you have been
[1:35:16] identified in this hour.
[1:35:19] You've been identified as overcomer.
[1:35:24] You're not you're not just uh you're not
[1:35:26] just following another movement,
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; but the movement called out to you. The
[1:35:32] movement of Christ says you are an
[1:35:34] overcomer. You are victorious. The bride
[1:35:36] of Jesus Christ. And it's time we start
[1:35:39] living like it, brothers and sisters.
[1:35:41] Live like an overcomer.
[1:35:44] Don't let things be out of your reach.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Don't let things be beyond your grasp.
[1:35:51] If you have if if if God tells you you
[1:35:53] need healing, if you need healing, grab
[1:35:55] your healing.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; If your children are weward, grab your
[1:35:59] children. Apply the word. Apply the word
[1:36:03] in their life, in your life.
[1:36:12] He says it this way in the first seal.
[1:36:14] He preaches in 63, the first seal. He
[1:36:16] says, "This is only to be revealed in
[1:36:18] the last day when this actual seal is
[1:36:21] broken." Broken to who? Not Christ, but
[1:36:24] to the church.
[1:36:27] Now, that left room for question, didn't
[1:36:29] it?
[1:36:31] Because some people sitting there was
[1:36:33] denominationalized.
[1:36:36] Well, is he talking about us? Is he
[1:36:37] talking about the Methodists, the
[1:36:38] Baptist, the P? Who's he talking about?
[1:36:41] Well, he must have picked up on that and
[1:36:42] he said, "Oh my, that just makes me
[1:36:44] tremble.
[1:36:46] That just makes me tremble. He said, 'I
[1:36:49] hope that the church truly understands
[1:36:51] it and what I mean, you people.
[1:36:56] I'm going to call you bride.
[1:36:59] Oh, there's a clear-cut definition right
[1:37:02] there. I'm not just talking to a church.
[1:37:05] I'm not just talking to an organization.
[1:37:07] I'm not just talking to some creeds and
[1:37:09] some dogmas that's been passed down
[1:37:11] through the ages. But what I am talking
[1:37:13] about is I'm talking about a bride
[1:37:15] church of Christ.
[1:37:18] The bride who lives the life of Jesus
[1:37:20] Christ. I'm talking to a specific group
[1:37:22] of people. And he said when you real
[1:37:25] born again Christians and you real
[1:37:27] servants of God hear that word.
[1:37:30] You come out of denominations.
[1:37:33] You come out of your creeds. You come
[1:37:35] out of all these things. And why?
[1:37:37] Because it falls on fertile ground. It
[1:37:40] falls on bedding ground and something on
[1:37:43] the inside of you says there's a seed on
[1:37:46] the inside of me. There's something on
[1:37:48] the inside that says I need sunlight. I
[1:37:51] need the s o n
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; and something starts to grow.
[1:37:58] It was always there. It was always
[1:38:01] there. But something begins to grow.
[1:38:08] You know, I heard a preacher say some
[1:38:10] time ago
[1:38:13] that that serpent seed nature comes out
[1:38:16] in us sometime.
[1:38:18] I said, "What?
[1:38:23] That ain't no serpent seed in this
[1:38:25] heart."
[1:38:29] I don't know where he got that if he's a
[1:38:30] slip of a tongue or what, but I heard it
[1:38:32] plain as day.
[1:38:35] There ain't no serpent seed in here. If
[1:38:38] you're debating in your mind whether you
[1:38:40] uh whether the serpent seed you may have
[1:38:42] a little bit of a nasty nature
[1:38:45] where it says that you're born in this
[1:38:46] world speaking lies. That's a nasty
[1:38:49] nature
[1:38:51] but there ain't two seeds growing in
[1:38:53] here.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; You don't you don't pluck one out and
[1:38:56] throw it away. That's not the way it
[1:38:58] works. Because if we believe in
[1:39:00] predestination, we believe that that
[1:39:02] seed was always in there.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:39:08] There ain't no serpent seed down in
[1:39:10] here. There's two.
[1:39:16] You say, "Well, why did I go through the
[1:39:17] things that I went through? Why did I
[1:39:19] have to ch Why did I have to ask these
[1:39:20] questions? Why did I have to to have
[1:39:22] these challenges? Why did I have to to
[1:39:24] see all of this?" He said, "Because you
[1:39:25] were deceived in the beginning."
[1:39:29] You were deceived in the beginning. That
[1:39:31] didn't change who you was.
[1:39:33] Circumstances in life don't change who
[1:39:35] you are. Cancer
[1:39:37] does not change you being a Christian.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; It it it is determined by which report
[1:39:46] you believe.
[1:39:54] Yeah, I'm going to do this. It's been on
[1:39:58] my mind, been on my heart. I'm going to
[1:39:59] do it.
[1:40:00] I thought about Sister Donna and I hope
[1:40:04] this is okay, Sister Donna. it. Don't
[1:40:05] you scold me after church. Okay.
[1:40:08] They come to us and they said, "Brother
[1:40:11] Ber called me." He said, "We've had a
[1:40:12] report. It wasn't good. He was he was in
[1:40:15] a bad shape." So, we had a meeting, me
[1:40:19] and my wife and sister Hannah, we had a
[1:40:21] meeting because we're nurses and they
[1:40:23] had some questions. And so, we we had a
[1:40:26] meeting and and and you know, some of
[1:40:28] you know the story. and and the the
[1:40:31] doctor told her said, "You're going to
[1:40:33] die from this cancer."
[1:40:38] Well, that's not a very good report.
[1:40:42] And immediately we said, "Well, I think
[1:40:44] you need a second opinion."
[1:40:47] And Sister Hannah, I believe it was,
[1:40:48] spoke to me. said, "And we're going to
[1:40:50] pray that we that you'll be sent and
[1:40:52] you'll find a doctor
[1:40:55] that will that will at least listen and
[1:40:57] and examine this the way that that we
[1:40:59] want to see it through the eyes of
[1:41:00] Christ."
[1:41:03] So, the report said, "You're going to
[1:41:05] die."
[1:41:08] What' they give you? Three months. Was
[1:41:10] it that long? Three months, three weeks,
[1:41:12] three days? We don't know. But the
[1:41:14] report was she's going to die from this.
[1:41:17] There's nothing we can do.
[1:41:20] She goes to the second opinion
[1:41:23] and says the doctor says you're not
[1:41:25] going to die from this. People come
[1:41:26] overcome this all the time.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Which report did she want to believe?
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Whose report are you going to believe?
[1:41:40] Are you going to believe what Satan
[1:41:41] tells you, what Satan throws at you at
[1:41:43] your doorstep? Or are you going to
[1:41:45] believe what God says? Amen.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Are we going to Yeah. Come on. Are we
[1:41:49] going to slay serpents?
[1:41:51] Are we going to stand on what c the
[1:41:53] serpent says? Whose report are you going
[1:41:55] to believe?
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; I believe the report of the Lord. His
[1:42:00] report says, "I am healed." His report
[1:42:02] says, "I am filled." His report says, "I
[1:42:04] am free." His report says, "Victory."
[1:42:08] That's the report of the Lord.
[1:42:17] She looks better today than she has in
[1:42:19] two, three years.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; You better say that.
[1:42:31] [Music]
[1:42:35] You're an overcomer.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; We don't listen to the defeat.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; We don't accept the defeat.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; We listen to the report of the
[1:42:45] overcomer.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Let me find me a spot here.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, I want you to notice the
[1:42:55] anointed word of his day,
[1:42:58] which you are a part of.
[1:43:01] When you heard that, you knew real quick
[1:43:03] you was an eagle.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; You knew real quick you was an eagle.
[1:43:10] When you heard that, you wasn't a
[1:43:13] denominational chicken to begin with.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Serpent seed, God's seed. You wasn't,
[1:43:19] let me repeat that. You wasn't a
[1:43:22] denominational chicken to begin with.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; You know there was something wrong.
[1:43:29] There was something wrong. And you know
[1:43:30] that you were trapped in it at the
[1:43:32] beginning. He said, "But the bridegroom
[1:43:35] took away your shame.
[1:43:40] Those nasty things you used to do, the
[1:43:42] traps you fell into, the lifestyle that
[1:43:45] was not pleasing.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; He took all of that away from you. He
[1:43:50] took away your shame and he put it in
[1:43:52] the sea of his forgetfulness by the
[1:43:55] washing of the water of the word and the
[1:43:58] blood of life.
[1:44:01] There is no death to the believer. It's
[1:44:04] the blood of life.
[1:44:09] And by that he says you're standing
[1:44:11] completely justified as though you never
[1:44:14] did it in the beginning.
[1:44:21] He said, "I'm trying to tell you to pull
[1:44:22] away from them shucks.
[1:44:25] Pull away from them shucks."
[1:44:27] You know, we we we should be rooted in
[1:44:29] the word. So rooted into the word that
[1:44:33] all of our nutrients come right through
[1:44:34] the word, through the word. Through the
[1:44:36] message, through the word. I got some
[1:44:38] pictures on my phone. I I wasn't going
[1:44:40] to bring it out in this message, but I
[1:44:41] wished I would have give it to them. But
[1:44:43] we we raised the moms, you know, we
[1:44:44] raised those moms. But we got some that
[1:44:46] just didn't have a good root system.
[1:44:49] And so I took pictures. This is about a
[1:44:51] month and a month or so after growing,
[1:44:53] month and a half after growing. And I
[1:44:55] took pictures of them. And I was going
[1:44:56] to show you here in church, and maybe we
[1:44:58] will sometime. But because the root
[1:45:00] system wasn't feeding on the nutrients,
[1:45:05] they begin to wither.
[1:45:08] They begin to die out. They had They
[1:45:10] look good in places, man. They look like
[1:45:12] they really was serving. Are you with
[1:45:14] me? They look like they really was
[1:45:16] growing, but then you go to the other
[1:45:18] side of them and it's just dead,
[1:45:21] wilted up, withered.
[1:45:23] What was it? They wasn't getting all the
[1:45:26] nutrients because the roots had been
[1:45:29] damaged.
[1:45:31] But you take that plant that's sitting
[1:45:33] right beside it, the same variety, the
[1:45:36] same species sitting right there beside
[1:45:38] it, and the roots are healthy, and it
[1:45:40] begins to suck in those nutrients, and
[1:45:42] it begins to feed. And it feeds on the
[1:45:44] word and it feeds on the message and
[1:45:46] it's feeding on God.
[1:45:48] It's feeding on the su like we feed on
[1:45:51] the s end. And that plant is sitting
[1:45:54] there today and it's this big around and
[1:45:56] it's green all over and it's fixing to
[1:45:58] bud. Why? Because it's feasting on the
[1:46:00] word.
[1:46:12] But really from the beginning,
[1:46:15] you were predestinated to be a son and
[1:46:18] daughter of God.
[1:46:22] He said, you're standing there
[1:46:23] completely. You never sinned at the
[1:46:26] first place. God don't even know nothing
[1:46:28] about it. Isn't that an amazing thing
[1:46:29] that all the things that you've done
[1:46:31] your life that you beat yourself up for
[1:46:34] day after day? I wish I'd never done
[1:46:36] this. I wished I'd never said that. I
[1:46:37] wish I I wished I wished I wished. God's
[1:46:40] thinking, what in the world is he
[1:46:42] talking about?
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; I don't even I I I don't know what he's
[1:46:51] thinking because I I never seen that
[1:46:53] happen. I don't even know that that took
[1:46:54] place. What is he beating himself up
[1:46:56] for? Why do we beat ourselves up
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; when the blood has been shed?
[1:47:06] God is an imu immutable in his nature.
[1:47:09] Then he is just as immutable in his
[1:47:12] ways.
[1:47:13] We're learning some words today.
[1:47:15] Immutable.
[1:47:17] Immutable means something that cannot be
[1:47:19] changed or altered.
[1:47:25] When he says you healed, you're healed.
[1:47:29] When he says your kids are yours,
[1:47:32] they're yours.
[1:47:34] When he says you're delivered from the
[1:47:36] filth of this world, you're delivered.
[1:47:39] When he says, "I saved your soul as
[1:47:42] though you never done it." You never did
[1:47:44] do it.
[1:47:49] So if he's a healer then, he's a healer
[1:47:51] now, a savior then, a savior now, a
[1:47:53] burden bearer then. He bears our burden
[1:47:55] today.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; That's my God.
[1:48:04] I'm going to read this quote again.
[1:48:05] We've read it about three times and I'm
[1:48:07] going to read it this maybe three or
[1:48:08] four.
[1:48:10] Christ in the true church is a
[1:48:12] continuation of the book of Acts.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; But the but the book of Revelation shows
[1:48:16] the Antichrist spirit would come into
[1:48:18] the church and defile it, making it
[1:48:19] lukewarm, formal, and powerless. It
[1:48:22] exposes Satan. It reveals his works
[1:48:26] attempted the destruction of God's
[1:48:27] people and discrediting God's word right
[1:48:30] down to the time he's cast into the lake
[1:48:32] of fire. He fights that.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Why are you in a battle? He fights that.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Why does temptations come, Paul? He's
[1:48:41] fighting you.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Why does doubt creep in our minds when
[1:48:46] we know the power that lays in the Holy
[1:48:49] Ghost?
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; He's fighting it.
[1:48:54] He's not going to lay down.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; He don't cow down. He's fighting it. He
[1:48:59] can't stand it. He knows that if the
[1:49:02] people get the true revelation of the
[1:49:04] true church,
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; what she is,
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; what she stands for, and that she can do
[1:49:13] the greater works.
[1:49:16] Say it with me. She will be an
[1:49:19] invincible army.
[1:49:24] You say, "Why do you keep why do you
[1:49:26] keep using that quote?" Because I want
[1:49:28] you to know in your mind that if you can
[1:49:30] get what God wants you to be, you will
[1:49:33] be that invincible army. That's you he's
[1:49:36] talking about. This wasn't this wasn't
[1:49:39] his message. It's our message.
[1:49:48] This is our message.
[1:49:51] I send you
[1:49:54] Elijah
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; the prophet.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "I send Elijah for
[1:50:00] himself."
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Eleazar didn't go find a bride for
[1:50:05] himself.
[1:50:07] Uh-uh.
[1:50:09] Elezer was sent out to find a bride for
[1:50:11] the bridegroom.
[1:50:15] The message was sent for you. The
[1:50:17] message is sent for us in this hour.
[1:50:19] This is our time. This is our season to
[1:50:22] let the world know what God is doing in
[1:50:24] this last of the church age. This church
[1:50:27] age is going to end. And when it ends,
[1:50:30] it'll be because of a rapture.
[1:50:32] Somebody's going to have to take that
[1:50:33] rapture. Somebody's going to have to
[1:50:35] live the signs and the wonders. Somebody
[1:50:38] has to be the ambassador and the
[1:50:40] representative in this hour.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Somebody has to let the world know that
[1:50:45] God is not dead.
[1:50:49] There is a living God in Elton,
[1:50:52] Kentucky. There's a living God. Oh,
[1:50:56] church. There's a living God that moves
[1:50:59] through his people. And this is the
[1:51:01] season that we let the world know
[1:51:02] through the life that we live.
[1:51:07] He will bring back in the last day.
[1:51:12] And they will hear a vindicated prophet
[1:51:14] give the exact truth as it was with
[1:51:17] Paul. He will restore the truth as they
[1:51:21] had it. I like how he always mentioned
[1:51:24] himself but never bragged on himself.
[1:51:27] Did you hear it?
[1:51:29] There'll be a vindicated prophet give
[1:51:30] the exact truth as it was with Paul. He
[1:51:32] will restore the truth as they had it.
[1:51:34] and those elect with him in that day
[1:51:37] will be the ones who truly manifest the
[1:51:41] Lord.
[1:51:45] You know what it means to manifest,
[1:51:46] right?
[1:51:48] You're going to do what he did. You're
[1:51:51] going to produce exactly what he did.
[1:51:53] So, they'll be the ones that manifest
[1:51:55] the Lord.
[1:51:57] Oh, don't let this one hurt you now. And
[1:51:59] be his body.
[1:52:04] It gets better. And be his voice
[1:52:10] and perform his works.
[1:52:18] He said, "But what's the matter is we
[1:52:20] got a bunch of hybrid buzzards." Uh-oh.
[1:52:23] We got a bunch of hybridized buzzards
[1:52:25] running around. And he said, "These
[1:52:27] buzzards, they go down there and they
[1:52:28] begin to to to to go in there and they
[1:52:30] get the crow in the nest. They're not
[1:52:31] eagles, although they may act like it,
[1:52:33] but they're they got a hybrid religion
[1:52:36] trying to mix the oil in the water. Have
[1:52:39] you ever seen that? Have you I you know
[1:52:41] I I've drained the oil in vehicles
[1:52:42] before and and leave it sitting out and
[1:52:44] forget about it and it rain on it. You
[1:52:47] talking about a nasty mess.
[1:52:50] You know that water that was once so
[1:52:52] clear and so pure, now it's kind of got
[1:52:54] a it's got a film on it. It's like a
[1:52:56] slick. It's just kind of milky and
[1:52:58] nasty. And that oil, it just it's it's
[1:53:01] broken down because oil and water don't
[1:53:04] mix. Buzzards and eagles don't mix.
[1:53:13] [Music]
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; If they couldn't sit in the nest
[1:53:16] together, they sure ain't going to nest
[1:53:18] here together.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; He said they couldn't set in the nest
[1:53:22] together. But he says, listen, he said
[1:53:25] it don't mix. He said, "But that little
[1:53:27] crow jumps up there and he call
[1:53:31] days of miracles has passed.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Days of miracles has passed."
[1:53:45] I had somebody ask me some time ago
[1:53:49] said, "Are you are you aware of the
[1:53:50] movement
[1:53:52] or do you know anything about the
[1:53:53] movement where it's all about signs and
[1:53:55] wonders and miracles?"
[1:53:59] I had to think for a minute. Well, I
[1:54:01] hope I'm kind of part of that movement.
[1:54:05] And they went on to say, "Yeah, there's
[1:54:08] a movement that it's all about signs and
[1:54:10] wonders and miracles, but they don't
[1:54:13] really have to live a life." I said,
[1:54:14] "Now, I ain't heard about that." I said,
[1:54:15] 'The the places I know where miracles
[1:54:18] are happening, signs and wonders are
[1:54:19] happening. The people are living the
[1:54:21] word.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; The people are living the message.
[1:54:24] They're following the word. They're
[1:54:25] doing the very things. And it's
[1:54:26] producing
[1:54:28] what the word says it'll produce.
[1:54:34] I kind of didn't know where they were
[1:54:35] going with that. I just kind of left it
[1:54:36] at that and said, "Hey, where I see it
[1:54:38] happening, they live in the word."
[1:54:44] He said that
[1:54:46] that crow, that buzzard calls out
[1:54:51] and says, "This is all fanaticism."
[1:54:58] You know, I find out a lot of times it's
[1:55:00] all fanaticism until people need
[1:55:03] something fanatical.
[1:55:07] You need a healing. You ready to get
[1:55:10] fanatical now?
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Change an attitude.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; You need You need deliverance. You got
[1:55:21] You're living a life of bondage. You get
[1:55:24] a little fanatical when you know there's
[1:55:25] a way to get free.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:33] Papa Eagle. They look like him.
[1:55:37] They believe the same he does. They look
[1:55:40] like him. They're made like him. They're
[1:55:41] built like him.
[1:55:44] He knows they're genuine eagles. Oh my.
[1:55:46] That's what God wants is genuine
[1:55:49] Messiah.
[1:55:53] That's a big word. That's a strong word
[1:55:56] because when you look at Messiah,
[1:55:57] Messiah means the anointed. And he says
[1:56:00] there, we are his children and we have a
[1:56:03] lesser anointing. Jehovah eagle is the
[1:56:05] great eagle. We're the eagles.
[1:56:08] He's the Messiah. We're the Messiah.
[1:56:11] He means he was anointed one. You are
[1:56:15] anointed.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:56:19] he says the with what? the same spirit
[1:56:22] that he was anointed with.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; The only difference is we have it in
[1:56:28] measure.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; He's unmeasurable.
[1:56:32] And he says it's like in that ocean out
[1:56:34] there. He said you take that spoonful
[1:56:35] and you take a spoon and dip it down
[1:56:37] into the ocean. Every bit of the
[1:56:39] elements that's in that ocean, whether
[1:56:41] it's sodium, calcium, pot pod ash, all
[1:56:45] the minerals,
[1:56:46] the vitamins, they're all in that spoon.
[1:56:50] But you can only get a taste of that.
[1:56:54] But you look out there in that ocean,
[1:56:56] you try to tell me how much of that is
[1:56:58] out there.
[1:57:00] It's immeasurable. You can't measure it.
[1:57:02] And that's the way it is. Even though
[1:57:03] God is everything we have need of, a
[1:57:06] portion of that lays on the inside of
[1:57:08] the believer in this hour to do the very
[1:57:11] works he did. The greater works. Why is
[1:57:14] it greater? Let me ask you this. to make
[1:57:17] this this there's a lot of ways you can
[1:57:19] look at this, but look at it this way
[1:57:22] today. Why is it greater? Did you Was
[1:57:24] you there when Jesus done those things?
[1:57:27] Did you see it?
[1:57:30] Why do you believe it?
[1:57:35] Why do you believe it? You wasn't there.
[1:57:38] You didn't see it. You didn't hear it.
[1:57:40] You didn't witness it.
[1:57:43] But more blessed is he
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; that did not see but believes.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; And you can take the very words that
[1:57:52] you've read in paper, the words written
[1:57:55] in red, the message of the hour, and you
[1:57:57] can believe the stories because you know
[1:58:00] people, you heard people, and you just
[1:58:01] that something on the inside of your
[1:58:03] heart begins to believe and it says, "I
[1:58:05] know this is real.
[1:58:07] I know this was done. There was too many
[1:58:10] witnesses. It's went around and around
[1:58:12] and around the world. There had to be
[1:58:15] some truth to it.
[1:58:22] It might look like a ocean and it is
[1:58:25] exactly. He said that's the way Papa
[1:58:27] Eagle thinks about his little ones. How
[1:58:28] he struts around.
[1:58:31] He'll scream and they scream back.
[1:58:37] I had a hard time with this picture kind
[1:58:38] of at first because he talks about this
[1:58:41] eagle, Papa Eagle, strutting around and
[1:58:43] he he's typing that out to the Lord.
[1:58:48] And here's our Lord strutting around and
[1:58:51] he's screaming down to his people and he
[1:58:54] said, "I'm he that was."
[1:58:57] And the little eagle screams back,
[1:58:59] "Amen, papa."
[1:59:03] You hear it and you respond. I am he
[1:59:06] that is.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen, Papa.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; I am he that is to come. Amen, Papa. And
[1:59:14] this goes back and forth and back and
[1:59:16] forth. And he says that I am the same
[1:59:18] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:23] I am a healer. Amen.
[1:59:26] I still give the Holy Ghost. Amen. This
[1:59:29] is direct quotes. Amen.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; I'm the same yesterday and for forever.
[1:59:33] Amen, Papa. But then that crow says,
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; I'm glad we don't hear a bunch of
[1:59:41] calling going on in here. I I said, I'm
[1:59:44] glad we hearing a bunch of amen and not
[1:59:46] a bunch of calling. We don't have
[1:59:47] buzzers. This ain't a buzzer boneyard
[1:59:49] around here.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; Buzzards don't roost around here. We get
[1:59:53] rid of the buzzards.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because we're serpent
[1:59:58] slayers.
[2:00:01] [Applause]
[2:00:08] You know, Moses,
[2:00:11] Moses was given quite a commission.
[2:00:14] You think about Moses. He's seen he seen
[2:00:16] what was going on with the uh with the
[2:00:18] children of Israel and he seen with
[2:00:20] their bondage. He seen what was going on
[2:00:21] and he tried to take matters in his own
[2:00:24] hands. That didn't work out too well for
[2:00:27] him. But he he tried to take matters in
[2:00:30] his own hands and and and and and
[2:00:33] caused the death and a murder of a of a
[2:00:36] soldier. Caused him a lot of troubles, a
[2:00:39] lot of hardships. Had to run off into
[2:00:42] the desert.
[2:00:44] But Moses had a commission.
[2:00:49] Moses comes in there to a place and he
[2:00:51] says
[2:00:52] he comes before the Lord and the Lord is
[2:00:54] in a burning bush on the back side of
[2:00:57] the desert
[2:00:59] and the Lord says to him, I have seen
[2:01:01] the oppression of my children and I have
[2:01:04] heard their cries.
[2:01:07] I want you to watch what he says. I have
[2:01:09] come down. He's here.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; The children of Israel are here. I have
[2:01:15] come down to deliver them out of the
[2:01:17] hand of the Egyptians and to bring them
[2:01:20] up from the land to a good and large
[2:01:23] land, a land flowing with milk and
[2:01:25] honey. Now, God didn't just decide out
[2:01:28] of the blue, I'm going to I'm going to
[2:01:29] I'm going to take care of this problem.
[2:01:30] No, he he's seen this this problem for
[2:01:32] over 400 years. And he's letting Moses
[2:01:35] know, I've heard the oppression of my
[2:01:38] people. I want you to know that I'm
[2:01:40] compassionate about my people.
[2:01:43] But Moses is at this state as he in his
[2:01:45] life, he's in a separation from God.
[2:01:48] How many's ever been in that separation?
[2:01:52] Yeah. You you maybe find yourself in a
[2:01:53] separation away from God. And Moses is
[2:01:56] in this separated state
[2:01:59] and he's and God is speaking to him. And
[2:02:02] even though Moses is separate from God
[2:02:05] and sometimes we find ourselves separate
[2:02:07] from God, he's really not that two
[2:02:10] distant away.
[2:02:13] He comes down and he begins to speak to
[2:02:15] Moses and he says, "I will send you
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; personal pronoun.
[2:02:25] I will have a bride.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; I no longer call you church. I call you
[2:02:32] bride."
[2:02:34] And he's speaking to Moses here and he
[2:02:36] says,"Ive come down to deliver deliver
[2:02:38] them and come now therefore I will send
[2:02:40] you."
[2:02:42] So you mean God has to rely on human
[2:02:44] resources?
[2:02:46] This would be a HR department's
[2:02:48] nightmare, wouldn't it? You go in there,
[2:02:50] you tell them, "God told me to tell
[2:02:51] these women to
[2:02:56] Some of you get that."
[2:03:01] But Moses sits there and he says,
[2:03:06] "What am I going to tell them?"
[2:03:09] Lord, I I know what you're saying. I
[2:03:11] hear what you're saying. But you know
[2:03:13] the children of Israel, they're going to
[2:03:14] ask, "Who sent you?
[2:03:17] Who sent you? Who who am I going to tell
[2:03:20] them that sent me down here to come and
[2:03:22] deliver them out of the hands of the
[2:03:23] Egyptians?"
[2:03:28] He said, "Moses, tell them I am that I
[2:03:32] am.
[2:03:35] I am that I am." And when they, the
[2:03:39] children of Israel ask you, you say, "I
[2:03:41] am has sent me to you."
[2:03:45] You say, "What if they say what's what's
[2:03:48] what's his name?" You see it it was kind
[2:03:51] of important because God always had
[2:03:52] revealed himself through names and
[2:03:55] titles down through the ages there.
[2:03:56] Abraham he he encountered a mazdc that
[2:04:00] was called God the most high. Later on
[2:04:02] Abraham seen the almighty God. Abraham
[2:04:05] then become to know the Lord as the
[2:04:07] everlasting God.
[2:04:10] You see Hagar says encountered that you
[2:04:13] are the God who sees.
[2:04:16] And this goes on and on and on. So down
[2:04:18] through time the children of Israel was
[2:04:19] going to ask who who sent you.
[2:04:22] You tell them I am that I am has sent
[2:04:25] me. Tell the children of Israel I am
[2:04:28] have sent me. And brother Brandham says
[2:04:31] Moses got up got up on he got on that
[2:04:33] next morning. He took his wife and set
[2:04:34] her up on that mule and she had a baby
[2:04:36] on her hip. And they go trotting out
[2:04:39] through there. And here's Moses now with
[2:04:41] the whiskers hanging down to his waist
[2:04:43] and walking down through there, a bald
[2:04:45] head shining, a crooked stick in his
[2:04:47] hand, shouting as hard as he could go.
[2:04:53] Where you going, Moses?
[2:04:56] I'm going down to Egypt to take it over.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; Take it over?
[2:05:05] A one-man invasion? How? He says because
[2:05:09] he had an absolute. He said he had an
[2:05:12] absolute. He had something. He had the
[2:05:14] word of God that he could stand on. He
[2:05:16] said it would be like today if God told
[2:05:18] you to go and one man take over Russia.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; This is the commission that he was
[2:05:24] given. So Moses is going down there and
[2:05:27] the the brother Brandham said the thing
[2:05:29] about it was he did it.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; So many times God calls on us. He asked
[2:05:35] us and sometimes we play it off or we
[2:05:37] push it off. But not Moses. He listened.
[2:05:40] He stood on the word and he did it. He
[2:05:43] did what God said. Now I want you to
[2:05:44] watch what God tells Moses. This is
[2:05:46] good.
[2:05:50] You know, Moses was full of excuses.
[2:05:53] Full of excuses. Separated from God. I'm
[2:05:56] not good enough. I can't speak well
[2:05:58] enough.
[2:06:00] They They won't honor me. They'll kill
[2:06:01] me. They won't They won't have me. What
[2:06:03] am I going to do? How am I going to do
[2:06:04] it? Listen to what God told him. He
[2:06:07] said, "I have made thee a god to
[2:06:12] Pharaoh."
[2:06:18] You ever heard of igllets?
[2:06:20] You heard of messiahs?
[2:06:24] I have made thee a god to Pharaoh. You
[2:06:28] see, Pharaoh had rejected all of the
[2:06:31] dealings with Yahweh, the God of Israel.
[2:06:34] He looks at him, he he tells him, he
[2:06:36] says, "Now, who is this? Who is the Lord
[2:06:38] that I should obey his voice and let
[2:06:40] Israel go?"
[2:06:44] You see, before Pharaoh,
[2:06:47] God, Moses now stands as God before
[2:06:51] Pharaoh. Pharaoh wouldn't have nothing
[2:06:53] to do with the with the one true God. So
[2:06:56] God pulls Moses onto the scene and
[2:06:58] says,"Now I'm going to make you a God in
[2:07:00] the eyes of Pharaoh."
[2:07:03] That's strong words, isn't it?
[2:07:06] Who sent you? I am that I am.
[2:07:12] Why should I let the people go? Because
[2:07:13] I am said so.
[2:07:20] Under which merit should I allow this to
[2:07:22] happen? And he takes that crooked stick
[2:07:25] and he throws that crooked stick down on
[2:07:27] the ground. And what does it become?
[2:07:32] Serpent.
[2:07:34] Well, then here comes Pharaoh's Janice.
[2:07:36] Jambbras,
[2:07:38] come here and show us what you can do.
[2:07:39] So they take their rods and they cast
[2:07:41] them on the ground and they become
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; But what does Moses's serpent do?
[2:07:54] You see, he was a serpent slayer. He had
[2:07:57] the word of God. God had made him a god
[2:08:00] before Pharaoh. The little G, not a big
[2:08:02] G, just like us. Little eaglet, little
[2:08:04] Messiah, little gods, amateur gods,
[2:08:07] ambassadors.
[2:08:09] And now here's Moses's serpent. It takes
[2:08:12] and it gobbles up the other two. You
[2:08:14] see, Satan can't live in the sight of
[2:08:17] God. If you let God be the overshadow,
[2:08:21] Satan has to leave. He has to flee. He
[2:08:24] can't dwell in the same place with God
[2:08:27] Almighty.
[2:08:29] God is calling for some serpent slayers.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; I think it's time some of us find our
[2:08:35] place in and a place in our life to
[2:08:38] where we say
[2:08:41] somebody ask you, how can you have your
[2:08:43] healing?
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; Because I am.
[2:08:51] I am healed.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; Who told you you was? I am healed.
[2:09:01] I got a whole list of them.
[2:09:05] You're not the same person I used to
[2:09:07] know.
[2:09:09] What happened to you?
[2:09:11] I'm a new creature.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Serpent slayers.
[2:09:18] When the enemy comes our way, we throw
[2:09:19] the I am. Under the anointing of the
[2:09:21] Holy Ghost, I am delivered under the
[2:09:23] anointing of the Holy Ghost. I am
[2:09:25] justified under the anointing of the
[2:09:27] Holy Ghost. I'm a new creature. I'm a
[2:09:29] new creation. I'm being transformed. I
[2:09:32] am heir.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; I am delivered. I'm free. I'm no longer
[2:09:37] in bondage.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; I am a serpent slayer.
[2:09:46] I am
[2:09:49] an eagllet.
[2:09:51] How many believes you're an eagllet
[2:09:52] today?
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. We got more,
[2:09:55] but we'll save it.
[2:09:58] We don't want to wear you out.
[2:10:07] I'm not a gadget guy.
[2:10:10] This is This was Carson's. He didn't
[2:10:12] want anymore. So I I took it over.
[2:10:25] I want you to listen to this as we get
[2:10:27] ready to close.
[2:10:29] I find out one of the greatest
[2:10:30] hindrances that the church has got today
[2:10:33] is that they're scared to death.
[2:10:39] As we pause there for a minute, you
[2:10:40] think Moses when he throwed that that
[2:10:42] rod down and then he saw Janice and
[2:10:45] Jambers, the two magicians, he saw their
[2:10:46] snake, do you think he jumped back and
[2:10:48] said, "Oh, I I guess I better head back
[2:10:49] to the desert.
[2:10:51] He's got two. I only got one."
[2:10:55] The biggest hindrance that the church
[2:10:57] has today is they're scared to death. He
[2:10:59] says, "What are you scared about? What
[2:11:01] are you scared about? If you could just
[2:11:03] only realize that who you are, you don't
[2:11:07] know who you are. You don't know that
[2:11:09] who that is sitting next to you. You
[2:11:11] say, "Well, that's my neighbor. That's
[2:11:13] your brother, right? Is that your
[2:11:15] brother?" You claim him Paul. You're a
[2:11:17] good man.
[2:11:19] That's my brother. He says, "But when
[2:11:23] you look at it and you know him, that's
[2:11:25] right. But he's a son of God.
[2:11:28] He's more than just your brother. That's
[2:11:30] more than just your sisters. You're more
[2:11:32] than just neighbors. You're a son and
[2:11:35] you're a daughter. You're sitting beside
[2:11:36] a son and a daughter of God. That's
[2:11:38] who's sitting next to you. And who are
[2:11:40] you? You're a Christian believer. You're
[2:11:42] a son and daughter of God. So, what are
[2:11:44] you scared about?
[2:11:47] No need of being scared.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; No need in being scared.
[2:12:02] He said, "As long as the devil can keep
[2:12:04] you scared, that's all he wants to do
[2:12:07] because he's got you right then."
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; But Jesus rose up and said, "Fear not."
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; You say, "Why is fear such a big thing?
[2:12:18] Why is fear such a big hindrance? Why
[2:12:20] why is fear is what he's talking about?"
[2:12:22] What is the first thing that happens
[2:12:23] when they say cancer?
[2:12:27] What happens when when you hear that
[2:12:28] there's been an accident?
[2:12:31] What happens when you see your kids
[2:12:32] going the wrong way?
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; You see where this all goes? But he
[2:12:38] said, "Don't let fear scare you.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; We have nothing to fear.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; Fear not."
[2:12:50] Listen, as long as that exists, the
[2:12:52] church can never stand upright.
[2:12:56] How many serpent slayers do we have?
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid of what
[2:13:01] Satan says. I'm not afraid of what he
[2:13:03] does. I'm not afraid of what he throws
[2:13:04] at me.
[2:13:07] As long as this fear exists, the church
[2:13:09] can never stand upright. And whenever
[2:13:12] they talk of fear is whenever talk of
[2:13:14] fear is vanished, the Holy Spirit is
[2:13:17] completely in control of the church.
[2:13:21] You want to be powerful? Listen to this.
[2:13:24] And when all fears are gone, the church
[2:13:27] has the power.
[2:13:31] How? He says, how? They have everything
[2:13:35] that heaven owns behind them.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, listen to me. Everything that heaven
[2:13:42] owns stands behind you. It supports you.
[2:13:45] It pushes you.
[2:13:48] He says, why? They're ambassadors of the
[2:13:51] throne. Amen.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; You're God's ambassador on the scene.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; What is an ambassador? They have the
[2:13:58] rights to everything the country has. He
[2:14:01] said if he was an ambassador for the
[2:14:03] United States and goes into Russia, he's
[2:14:05] got everything that the United States
[2:14:07] stands behind him and gives him.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; And if you're a Christian today and
[2:14:12] you're standing up on the word of God
[2:14:13] and you believe in Jesus for everything
[2:14:16] you have need of there, everything that
[2:14:18] heaven has is standing behind you. An
[2:14:21] ambassador of Christ has authority.
[2:14:25] Say, "I've got authority."
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; I've got authority.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Everything that Christ owns belongs to
[2:14:32] that ambassador.
[2:14:34] Let's bow our heads today. Heavenly
[2:14:36] Father, we come before you thankful,
[2:14:38] Lord, for the service you've given us.
[2:14:40] We trust we didn't tire anybody and that
[2:14:42] the word went forth and fell on fertile
[2:14:44] ground.
[2:14:45] But it just grows us, Father, to see in
[2:14:47] this late hour that we're living in.
[2:14:49] That at the final days of this age that
[2:14:52] we're living in, there will be a bride.
[2:14:53] There will be a group of people that are
[2:14:56] the true ambassadors of Christ, that the
[2:14:58] seed of a living God dwells on the
[2:15:00] inside. And and as the word goes, it
[2:15:02] grows. And as the word goes forth, it's
[2:15:04] fertilizing that seed. And that seed
[2:15:06] comes to manifestation. And that seed
[2:15:09] separates itself from the shook. And it
[2:15:12] holds itself up in the light of the sun.
[2:15:15] Lord Jesus,
[2:15:17] make us that people. Lord,
[2:15:19] no doubt there's people here that
[2:15:21] struggle with different different
[2:15:23] things, different anxieties and fears
[2:15:25] and doubts, but we don't have to fear
[2:15:27] those things. We don't have to we don't
[2:15:29] have to be lend an ear to the devil's
[2:15:32] lies and his tactics because we are
[2:15:34] serpent slayers.
[2:15:38] that day on Calvary
[2:15:40] when that price was paid
[2:15:43] and you went up to that cross
[2:15:46] and Satan was gnawing and striking at
[2:15:50] your feet and striking at your heels and
[2:15:54] trying to make you doubt what you was
[2:15:56] doing.
[2:16:00] When that blood be to run down that
[2:16:02] Calvary, that hill called Calvary, and
[2:16:05] that blood ran down the feet,
[2:16:11] and life left your body, Lord.
[2:16:15] That was for me. You died.
[2:16:17] That was for me. You died.
[2:16:20] And you went into a cold, dark tomb. And
[2:16:24] you laid there. That was for me.
[2:16:27] That was for the believers here. That
[2:16:28] was for evening light tabernacle. That
[2:16:30] was for believers around the world. That
[2:16:32] was for the bride. And you laid there in
[2:16:34] that cold, dark tomb. But on that third
[2:16:37] day when you rose again,
[2:16:40] you crushed the head of the serpent.
[2:16:43] That heel crushed the head of the
[2:16:46] serpent. That we no longer have to live
[2:16:47] in fear. We no longer have to live
[2:16:49] depressed. We no longer have to live
[2:16:51] with the with the torture and the
[2:16:53] torment of the devil. but that in this
[2:16:56] hour because of that heel bruised that
[2:16:59] serpent and crushed his head, we live as
[2:17:01] overcomers.
[2:17:03] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:17:07] For being mindful of us and our needs.
[2:17:10] We love you, Lord, with all of our
[2:17:11] hearts. We thank you. We give you
[2:17:14] praise. We give you glory. We can't we
[2:17:17] just can't we can't glor g g g g g g g g
[2:17:18] g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g
[2:17:18] g g g g g g g g g g g glorify you enough
[2:17:20] Lord. But all that we can give to you,
[2:17:23] all the worship, all the praise, Lord,
[2:17:25] let it be pleasing to your ear, let it
[2:17:28] be heartfelt because we love you, Lord.
[2:17:31] Without you, we're nothing.
[2:17:34] In Jesus precious name we pray. Amen.
[2:17:38] Amen.
[2:17:40] He became me.
[2:17:44] He
[2:17:46] became me
[2:17:49] that I might
[2:17:52] become him by grace.
[2:18:01] He
[2:18:02] became me
[2:18:06] that I might
[2:18:08] become him by grace.
[2:18:17] He
[2:18:18] took my place

[2:18:24] thank you Lord.
[2:18:26] Thank you Lord Jesus.
[2:18:30] Lord, for he
[2:18:34] became me

[2:18:39] become him
[2:18:42] by grace. Sing my name once again. Oh,

[2:19:51] Amen. You enjoy the word this morning.
