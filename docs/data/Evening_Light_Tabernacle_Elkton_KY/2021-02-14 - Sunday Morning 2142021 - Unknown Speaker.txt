house of the lord this morning good to see so many people make the effort to come out on a on a day like today and i guess probably the coldest temperatures we've had and expecting snow so i know that's that's got to be on everybody's mind and uh it's just human nature we we try to think and prepare for things to come so i know it's on your mind but if we could just give the lord uh you know 30 45 minutes an hour uh give him that much time i think it'll be a blessing to us and um just uh just pray that the lord will bless you in a special way um let's just go before the lord in prayer if we could bow bower heads heavenly father we're just thankful lord for this day you've given us for your grace your mercy lord lord we're thankful lord that the people have come out to hear your word this morning just the dedication that they've given lord we just ask lord a special blessing upon them lord we just ask lord that you would allow me to move myself out of the way lord that you would just come down and speak through my lips and that you would just anoint their ears to hear the words lord the words of your prophet lord as we study and we look upon them lord they're words that uh that we cherish lord and they're words that draw us close to you father they're words that will give us deliverance their words help us to be overcomers lord and you know in our thoughts and intents this morning is the subject of overcomers lord and we just ask lord that you just bless it in a very special way we just want to tell you we love you we appreciate you we lift up those that are sick and at home lord we just ask that your full uh physician ability would come down and touch their body lord we just want to tell you we love you and appreciate and dedicate the remainder of the service into your hands in christ's name amen if you would turn in your bibles to revelations chapter 3 remember to hold up those that are sick i found out this past week just through annual blood work that that i had had coveted so we're clear of it now so the antibodies are are in the system so hopefully we'll be able to fight it off next time but it's it's a bad little it's a bad little virus if you haven't had it i hope you don't get it if you do get it i i hope that i hope it don't hit you as hard as it does some i know one of the side effects that i seem to be or the symptoms that i seem to still be holding on to is shaking and so i talked to the doctor about that it's just like i mean just my hands shake it's not that i'm i mean i am nervous but i'm not that nervous and uh you know so my legs they just quiver and so they said it two months or two weeks to two months it can linger on like that so uh pray for each other pray for those that have it and trust that they get over it soon i want to look at the more this morning on the subject the overcomer and brother brown was speaking about the overcomer he was speaking about someone he said who was living in revival he said we should never let the spirit of revival die we've got to keep in revival constantly revived every day paul says we have to die daily that christ so the christ could live and that we must never let that revival die within us revelations chapter 3 verse 20 for our scripture reading behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and what's up with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear led him here with the spirit saith unto the churches you can have your seats this morning god bless you my lord has blessed us to the reading of the word and we look at the word overcomer and we see with the word overcomer it says it is a person who overcomes something one who succeeds in dealing with or gaining control of some problem or difficulty another word you can look at for overcomer is someone who conquers someone who defeats someone who overthrows reduces or subdues and vanquishes their enemy so we as believers we have to find ourselves in that place that we are overcomers we have to be able to identify ourselves as an overcomer uh we're looking at this brother brandon said when you look at the scripture reading it says did you ever notice it says he sat with me in my throne not on my throne but in my throne he said that is his domain see christ is the ruler the complete domain of god he said so the bride will be with him in his throne in the entire domain not on my throne but in my throne where is his domain reaches he said a throne is over a domain and the domain reaches just as far as the boundaries does and this is from eternity to eternity so brothers and sisters we see that the bride of jesus christ and christ himself are becoming so close together that they're not sitting on the throne again they're together on that throne he said he's not in that throne but they're on that throne together so they're so close so equal that anything i want you to know that anything that god has overcome you can overcome do you think about it that way i was just reading a story just the other day i was looking at some some quotes and some thoughts for a future message there and it come to me and brother brandon was talking about the bride of jesus christ and christ and he was talking about he said i have conducted marriages before and he said when i conducted those marriages he said i i see that man and that woman and they come there and they begin to take their vows and he said when they take their vows it's just like christ and the bride their hearts start to beat as one our hearts have to beat as one listen to what he says we're here this morning we're here to see where our shortcomings are if we're going to overcome anything we kind of have to know what we have to overcome right so he says we have to see where our shortcomings are how can we get from where we are today to where we ought to be how many wants to be better than tomorrow than you are today we all want to be in a place that we say god i want to grow in you i want to develop in you i want to be closer to you i want a relationship just like that marriage is that our our hearts beat as one he says overcoming you've got to overcome something and he's talking about the laotia church age so let's look at this for just a few minutes we're going to get into some characters here in a minute but just to lay a foundation the laodicea he says it had to be rebuked because they were different towards christ he said they had put christ on the outside in their age we see that today we see that christ is on the outside brothers and sisters christ has been put on the outside of the church he's been put on the outside of the christian world he's been put on the outside of society people don't want christ you say well there's a bunch of churches there's a lot of people that claim christianity a form of a form of christianity not all but some have a form of christianity he says but there is christ he's on the outside knocking you heard our scriptures he's knocking on the door trying to get himself back in he does not give up on those people christ is not going to give up on people he keeps knocking and knocking and knocking and the prophet said that is love that's god's love he said after he'd been put out of his own house after he'd been put out of his own house and trying to get back in if they will open the door he'll come back in are you thankful for that this morning how many has ever been in a place to where you feel like you've maybe put christ on the outside of your life and thank god he knocked on the door and he knocked and knocked and knocked until you opened back up and said come back in lord i need you brothers and sisters it couldn't be any clearer in the hour that we're living in when you see the corruption around us you see the corruption that we live in in politics our government in education and in church morals when you look at this we're talking about a battle we go through our day-to-day life we think about mostly us and our family but when you look at it through a big picture through god's eyes when you look at what's going on there is a major battle going on between good and evil there is a spiritual warfare that is going around all around us and satan is trying his best to remove god from anything and everything that he can that's why he hits the political side so much because he knows the countries are founded upon god on the principles of christianity so if he can remove them from the governments he's got a leg up he goes in and he tries to remove them from our from our educational systems they don't teach your kids about god in public school they're not going to they may teach some kind of of homosexuality they may teach transgender well that's the truth anyway when they allow boys who wants to claim that they're girls to go play on soccer teams and basketball teams there's a problem god has been removed from that system and satan is just attacking and attacking and attacking there is a moral decay that's around the churches it don't stop it it don't stop in the government it don't stop in in the educational systems it goes on into the churches homosexual marriages that's a common thing now that is a common thing your vice president my vice president was the what married the first couple in california she performed that marriage of same-sex marriage the first one ever in california government churches people education satan is hammering hammer and hammer and trying to get to that and the people are so blind to it we've got to be careful we've got to be careful with what we do with our lives because the the satan has used such a foundation of technology everybody got a phone everybody can probably get on social media if they want to you can get on a different website you can browse whatever we used to think 20 years ago 40 years ago that the television was a television that is a toothache compared to what we have today the television is a two thing it was just a precursor of what was to come now we see technology coming in and hitting and hammering and hammering and hammering and hammering at people you think well it's just innocent is it because the technology world i'm kind of getting off on this but the technology world is controlled by people those people are controlled by something it's a spirit it's either a christian spirit or it's an evil spirit and if you control what goes out among the amongst the people they're being led by something so what are they saying what are they engraving what kind of ads are being promoted at us and our children he's like man how do we do it how do we overcome how do we overcome when everything is being put against us how do we overcome when satan is constantly we're in this battle you don't even realize sometimes you're in a battle but brothers and sisters there will be a little group of people a little small group of people as small as it may be just a few just a handful they won't succumb to satan they won't succumb to the things that he's coming they will be mighty in spirit they will be mighty in spirit in such a way that they will overcome the enemy of this evil age so brother brown was talking about laodicea we're living there and he's talking about leo odyssey and he says she has this rebuke coming to her she needs a sharp rebuke from god so where is she going to get this rebuke well it should start right here but listen to what happened in the world this is what brother brown said now he's talking about the church world when our clergy gets so soft and dirty now you know how i feel about uh about uh the politics and so forth some somewhat you know we talked last time i'm a patriot i i love our country i want to see our country do good and you know we want to see it do good in such a way and i tell you during the whole election process i told my wife and i'll confess right here i said i think the churches have failed the government because men will stand up and say what should be said from a political way they don't stand up and say there shouldn't be homosexuality there shouldn't be same-sex marriages there shouldn't be those things going on there shouldn't a child should not be able at the age of four or five to tell his parents i want to be a girl that's not that's not thinking that's not right [Music] but the doty soft clergy he said they think that they're they treat them like it's a grandfather to their grandchildren and everything that the kids do is perfect that's why you don't have no sin that's why there's no wrong because they have taken god and put him in such a way that he's such a good god that you can do no wrong they make a big dirty grandfather he says but he's not he is a father and a father of righteousness and correction and he says his love is always corrective no matter how bad it hurts it's still correct we can't take this and start tearing pages out that we don't like we can't take this and start adding pages to make it say something that it don't say we have to stay right with what the word has been for years you cannot change god he don't change but the world has tried to take it and say well this don't mean this about a woman this doesn't mean that a woman can't preach well i'm gonna get with hit with this one is this online i hope it's not but a real mother and a real dad will correct their children when you don't get correction at home if none of you ever corrected your kids it would be so loud in here right now you wouldn't be able to stand it we would have a little it would be like renegades running around everywhere and that's what's happened in the church world they don't get correction from the pulpit so they're allowed to do whatever they want to do and it continues to get worse and worse and worse and worse until we see this age we're living in and we think my goodness my goodness how do we even how do we even get out in the world brother branham's talking he said i was crossing an old log the other day down a wash we call it a holler and he says i jumped up on this log on the outside it looked good it was a big old beach log he said i jumped up on it but a great big chunk fell off of it it was real rotten and doty he said that is the way that christians are becoming they've been dead in sin and trespasses so long to their doty they don't even realize that the sins and the trespasses and the things that they're going through is making them weak and doughy and rotten they've been come to a place that they just continue to go on that way and they don't even realize it he said they can hold they can't hold any weight he said they don't know what overcoming means so how do we overcome he says listen this is good he says at the beginning of the text he says overcome means to keep life in you keep life in you so this big tree that once stood mighty up in the forest has now fallen across into this holler and he said the water run over it and it began to run over and over and over and it made it dirty and rotten what happened what made that tree rot it lost its roots in the ground it lost its position in life and the life came out of it so we have to be able to keep the life of christ in us we have to live in such a way pray more read more give more to god expect more from god and give more to god keep that life burning on the inside he says you take a christian that's supposed to be a christian you let the life of god go from him the experience and the joy of serving christ and he said that living church where is such a going he said it will rot twice as quick it will rot twice as quick when you let the experience go or the joy of serving christ restore unto me the joy of my salvation why is that god god gives us those kind of messages so that we can hold on to something we need the life of christ in us we need that union the hearts beating as one it's got to be there listen to this i hate to read quotes but this this this was just so good as i followed through this message it was so good he said if we're trying to follow the message of the hour we should live constantly in the life of christ because if it don't you lay around and the things that you're supposed to do and don't do it the bible says he that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it's sin he said then you become doty and rotten when you're separated from the life of god so strive with all that's in you strive with all that's in you to stay in the life of christ that you be fruit bearing it's not good enough that you're just a christian it's not good enough that you just go through life and you you've claimed god you claim christianity you've been saved you've been baptized and you're living for christ but god wants to see some fruit from us the overcomers will bear fruit this lay ought to see a church age he says it's the grandest of all church ages and he chose us he chose us in the grandest of all church ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of eternity now when you're talking about blending something those two have to be pretty close so if you're going to be an eternal being and you're going to blend on into eternity you better be doing eternal things now getting yourself ready he says blending in of eternity and he says and then it's the greatest sinful age it's more sin in this age than there's ever been the powers of satan is many times harder to fight against than it was in any other age the powers of satan are harder to fight in this age than any other age that we've lived in you think about this brothers and sisters preachers have preached this message since the prophet was on the left scene right you've heard these quotes your whole life a lot of us right and you've heard these quotes and you believed them all along but if you think about it now these quotes are more than just thoughts they're more than just words that you're hearing now you can feel these quotes you go out into the world and you begin to feel these quotes physically mentally you can feel the corruption of the people around and i hate to be it sounds ugly and i don't mean it that way but you go out into the world and you begin to hear the vulgarity that people people smell and you begin to feel and you can just oh you carry it you can feel it's almost like you can feel demons brushing against you they're more than just quotes on a paper it is a time and an age that we're living in how did god trust us for that why do you ever think about it why did he choose me to live in this age why did he choose me to be a person that can they can overcome the wiles of the devil they can go out into the into the into the world and go out there and brush shoulders with these things and overcome it because a lot of people can't do it a lot of people can't overcome the temptations but he chose you he says back there in the early ages a christian for his profession of in a church belonging to christ would be beheaded for it he'd be killed he'd be put out of his misery and go to meet god quickly but now we're in an enduring process nobody's going to behead you it's not going to happen i don't think nobody's going to come after you because of what you believe they may throw darts at you they may throw stones at you figuratively speaking but nobody's going to come after you you're not going to be put out this quickly you're going to endure to the very end you are going to have to endure and overcome satan and all of his trickery up until the blending of time until eternity how are we going to do that how are we going to do that this is the age he says of a personal life of christ and he goes there talking about how the chemical of his body when you think about the holy ghost and what the holy ghost is when you think about what it means to have the holy ghost brothers and sisters when you look at that and you see that there was justification there was sanctification and then now there's baptism of the holy ghost what happens is that everything that god was as everything he will ever be is he took and he poured that all right down into you that day you said god fill me with the holy ghost there's your overcoming there's your overcoming right there that's how we're going to do it god has overcomers he has had overcomers in every age he said in every time every age there's been on earth god has always had somebody that he could put his hands on so let me put my hands on you you're an overcomer he said somebody that he could put his hands on as a witness on the earth because he's never been without a witness he said man how do i know we hadn't missed it because we're still witnessing we're still here we're still witnessing wanting more and more of god we're still walking through this and wanting more of god the bible says he that believeth on me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation or the judgment but has passed from death unto life do you believe you see where you're starting to identify do you see how you begin to identify as an overcomer it's all in the scriptures let's look at a few overcomers in noah's time we look at noah and we look at this andaluvian world that the prophet talks about and he said there was perhaps millions of people millions of people but there was eight overcomers do some do some math millions of people but eight overcomers there was eight real genuine overcomers he said that was uh noah's sons their wives and noah and his wife eight overcame eight entered the ark at the appropriate time how did they do it they listened to the word of god simple it's real simple it's simple to be an overcomer if you just do what god says listen to what i have to say he said they wasn't called on the outside of the door they wasn't calling the outside door they were on the inside but there was millions millions there that had good intentions they had good intentions they said oh maybe someday if this happens or that happens then i'll go up there and i'll see brother noah because he's a fine fella he said but there was only eight on the inside 120 years 120 years the echoes of warnings across the land think about it 120 years constantly the warnings echoed over and over and over but it wasn't taken seriously they didn't take the warning seriously they played it off as an unbelievable event an unbelievable event now now i'm talking to believers i'm talking to overcomers but you think about this how easy it would be to play this off as an unbelievable event he's building a ship up on top of a mountain that's never seen rain and he's telling them that this ship is going to float in the water and it's the only refuge now think about that now let me tell you something else me tell you another story god is going to come down from heaven and catch away a group of people and the twinkling in the moment in the twinkling of an eye [Music] now to us that sounds good i'm ready but to the world that is an unbelievable event they can't even imagine they can't fathom the thought of that happening that's the same thing that happened back during the andalusian destruction they needed to be sealed in with god and they wasn't brothers and sisters we're in a ceiling time we have to be sealed the holy ghost find ourselves in a place that nothing sounds unbelievable because god is still a miracle-working god god is still an overcomer god is still doing things that he done years and years ago i was reading i was reading about i like to look up songs and things in the history of songs and different different things church songs i like to know where they come from and you know we sing the anthem amazing grace over and over it's the anthem of christianity around the world it was written by john newton in 1772 1772 and he's out there on a slave trip ship i should say he's a slave trader and he's out there and he begins to he's beginning to search for god well during the search of god here comes this storm that comes upon the ship and the ship begins to get battered and battered and battered and it begins to take on water and they're out in the middle of the sea 1772 they didn't have technology it was life or death and he begins to fall down his age and he prays to god because something god can you save us and this the story goes that when he began to pray the cargo and the ship shifted directions and sealed where the ship was busted that's a miracle that's a miracle working god and god can still do that today for us don't ever underestimate or unbelieve what god can do for us he said brother branham how do i know i'm in there you wanna know how you know you're in there how do you know in your heart that you are the believer how do you know you're the bride of christ how do you know that you're the overcomer how do i know i'm sealed in that ark he said just watch the kind of life you're living look around just see if it's just lived out of you automatically he said or do you have to strain and pull and see what you're doing he says but don't do that did you ever try it don't he says just look at your life and see is is the life of christ living out of me automatically are the words that i speak on a daily basis are they pleasing to the ears of god we can all ask that question we get called up around you know in conversations and sometimes maybe we say things off the cuff and things we shouldn't have i'm probably the biggest one that i know of that can put my foot in my mouth quicker than anybody trying to say something that maybe is just a little cute or a little funny but then you realize maybe i shouldn't have said that maybe i shouldn't have said that they could have hurt somebody's feelings and i don't want to do that i don't want to portray that but he says just automatically see if it's living automatically of you he tells the story you know the story he tells about the baby and trying to put the baby's arm in the sleeve hole he said you can try to put that baby's arm in the sleeve hole he said he's up and down he's over here he's everything he can't do it he says put your coat on honey he says he can't do it his little arms is up and down and around and it takes a steady hand he says oh i'm glad that i can just yield my hand to the father the lord jesus christ and can get in there you help me you put the coat on me i'll quit trying and let you do it if that little baby keeps trying he says oh i can do it i can do it you sing a little kids i can do it mama i can do it he said he's just everywhere because he can't do it neither can you or i neither can you or i but if we just hold still and let him do it yield to him here lord here i am just let me be nothing i yield put my hand in the right place he says that's the victory that's your overcoming brothers and sisters how many here today would say lord put me in the right place today put my family in the right place today put my children in the right place today let our young people find the right partner in life let them live a right kind of marriage we need god to put us in the right place the thing you have to do is overcome yourself your idea and surrender yourself he overcome for you he knows the way we don't let's look at daniel for a minute talking about the days of daniel in noah's age there was eight in daniel's day there was four that's a little bit that makes you think a little bit doesn't it i'm glad we got millions and millions of people in the world today that makes us look a little better here's daniel another reason another way that you know you're an um that you know that you're a believer and that you know that you are an overcomer is you're going to be tested how many has ever been tested how many has ever been put through the trial and you think my when is this going to stop you've been put through the test he that cometh to god must be tested the prophet said that is a true sign of a child of god when he's tested when he's tested it's the greatest thing that's ever happened to you how many of you has ever said i just had the greatest thing ever happened to me today the greatest thing has happened to me today i i lost my job i run over nails and flattened all my tires run out of gas in the furnace it's going to be 20 what zero tonight maybe i just had the greatest thing happen to me you won't believe it now we don't look at it that way when we're going through it we don't look at the trials and the test as the greatest thing as precious as gold as the bible says i think peter said is this your trousers are as precious as gold we don't look at it that way when we're going through it but we will be tested and we will be tried here was daniel a prophet of god a man of god and he's sitting here and they look at daniel and they put him in a trap here's daniel he's in captivity and he's sitting here in captivity and he's been praying to god daily daily daily and somebody comes and says king darius we think you need to put a prohibition on uh praying to god we've got to stop daniel from seeking out his god because when he talks to god things happen for him and we need to stop it so for 30 days darius i think you need to just completely let there be no prayer to any gods outside of us and darius kind of like daniel but he was caught he had to do what the people said so he says okay for 30 days nobody prays nobody can turn towards the temple and get on their knees and pray to god so what does daniel do what's daniel going to do with this challenge so here's daniel in a trap never missed a day of praying in his life but knows if he goes to pray he'll be thrown right into the lines then death is imminent but the prophet said daniel wasn't afraid of them spies they were sitting there watching and waiting ready to pounce on him as soon as he prayed the prophet said that daniel went and threw up those shades he threw back the shutters and he got down on his knee throwed up his hands to god and prayed live or die i'm gonna have the victory live or die i'm gonna be an overcomer live or die they the lions can't eat me he stood beside god he knew who he was he was victorious and as the story goes and i read some stuff on it and on the internet some ancient writings and stuff that daniel was about 70 years old we think of him as a young person but he was about 70 years old down in the lion's den and one writer wrote that it was just like a man coming home to his dogs and they licked and wagged their tails and these are ferocious lines and they come up to a 70 year old man of god and licking him in the face and wagging their tails that's another one of my believable stories but it happened because god always sees his believers through god will always see his overcomers through shadrach meshach and abednego same thing here they're going to be challenged now on their faith by the fire they didn't fall they were so solid and so overcome they said man if the lions couldn't eat daniel the fire can't burn me so they stood there and initially they went in there it was thrown in there and the fire just licked them nothing the days of lot that was four the days of lot there were three you know brother brown said it'd be one in a million in the days of lot there were three to overcome lot and his two daughters you got two angels coming down into gomorrah two angels come down and lost sitting at the gates of the city and these two angels come down and come down they begin to speak to him and they warn him of what's to come fire is fixing to reign upon your city you need to get you and your family out of here so he goes back and he begins to to tell the family and he's feeding the the two uh the angels and he's feeding them in their house of course we know what happens the men come and they knock on the door and they want the two men for perversion they want the two men a lot offers them a daughter they this all falls apart or falls in place and god gets his family and begins to flee the city and as he's fleeing the city they're going out and he the angels told them do not look back do not go back to the old ways don't look back to your old city don't look back to your old job don't look back to the old desires of your life keep pressing on so here's a lot and he's pressing on and his two daughters are pressing on but here's lot's wife you know she's not even named in the bible not even named in the bible but she's walking along and the problem said she had desires that she couldn't get rid of she had desires that was hanging on to her from the world and she looked back and just like that turned into a pillar of salt why was that she started out on the right track she started out to go to be an overcomer she started out to go into a place that she could say i'm going on with god but in walking the journey she couldn't couldn't hold back from looking back at the old lifestyle she lived prophet actually said she won't go get her hair cut that's what she wanted to do couldn't get rid of the old things of the world couldn't overcome and the prophet said that satan finally overthrowed her there's no time to be looking back we've all agreed that we're in the most corrupt time the most evil age that there could possibly be so there's no time to be looking back it's time to keep our eyes focused on calvary to be looking to calvary to be looking for the unbelievable israel started out 2 million strong 2 million strong there was two we went from eight to four to three to two we're getting pretty close to that one brother jill israel started out two million strong he said they saw the manifestation of the spirit in egypt now we we know the children of israel and egypt let's think about their story for just a minute you want to talk about an unbelievable story how could they not follow on into the promised land after all that they had seen you think about these these people they were the very ones that saw all the plays they saw moses come in they saw moses do all the things that he did they saw the plagues happen they saw the the token put up on the lentils they were the people that put the put the token on the lentil that was those people but yet here they come now and they they go up to the red sea and they see moses speak and park the red sea think of what they saw think of the what they live but yet here they come to a place that they could not overcome because the prophet said it wasn't in their heart people seen a lot of stuff there's people around this message that could tell you things they saw but it's got to be in your heart it's got to be dwelling down deep into your heart there was two there was joshua and caleb and brother brown said when it come down to the showdown to the obstacles to where they looked like grasshoppers they said we can do it we're more than able we can do it i don't care what the enemy looks like how big your mountain is today we are more than able through christ who strengthens me that's all they can stand up on was god they were overcomers brother brown said those men had the word of the lord and they stayed with it they went over not that he that's not he that starts but he that finishes and you know what brother branham says it kind of it's almost like he's testing you testing your thoughts testing where you're at he says you weren't defeated none of us in here were born as an overcomer you're born defeated you're born defeated you're born into a place that birth can't bring you life you may be alive but there's no life until christ comes into your heart you're in a defeated world our world's defeated you're amongst defeated people this world's people the people this world are defeated he said you're amongst the defeated creeds and denominations he says you've got to come to victory some way and then he goes into talking about the lily and he said there's that little lily where did they come from when you look out upon that pond and you see those beautiful lilies out there and you see them they're just as pretty as they can be where did that lily come from he said it came from a little seed down at the bottom of that muddy murky stagnant water he said yet that little seed and all the radiance that was ever in it that'll ever shine was in it right at the bottom of that pond so there he was he was born in a defeated world but yet there was a seed inside of you that god said one of these days this little guy right here is going to shine one of these days i'm going to put my hands on him and he is going to be an overcomer in the last day one of these days he's going to prove to the world that i live so here's this little lily down at the bottom of this black dirty murky slimy pond this is what it was brothers and sisters we need more of the sun in our life so that we can express fully what we are we've got to have god to come down in our life and find out exactly how he can use us and and that we can prove ourselves to be overcomers he said he brought this little seed predestinated seed he brought it to life and it's present itself he said that's the over he overcome the mud he overcome the things of the world and now he freely gives himself out so ask yourself are we freely giving ourselves out to god are we freely doing what god has called us to do are we freely doing everything that he wants us to do if it is like i said you'll be able to see it just naturally radiating out of you it won't be hard it comes easy when that little lily sprouted forth and it sprung itself open and sprouted itself brother branham said there was a certain radiance about it he said that the little bee come over to it and said wow that's a pretty perfume now do you think that lily smelled like that at the bottom of that murky salami pond no but the life that was within it began to come forth brothers and sisters that's why it's so important that we as believers as overcomers it's so important that we have the life of christ living inside of us that we don't take this message lightly that we don't take the things of this of this the words and the quotes and the message and the things that god is doing in this late hour open our eyes because we get called up and i'm speaking to myself we get so caught up with the things around us that we fail to realize we're a part of the finish that we are a part of the finished work that we're the ones that's going to sit over there someday we're going to sit side by side with joshua and caleb you are as an overcomer you're going to sit there and you're going to ask noah how did you do that how did you do that for 120 years being mocked and ridiculed and laughed at and scorned and made fun of for 120 years how did you do that noah he says there was just something inside of me something inside of me that just made me kept pressing on daniel how did you know that those lines wasn't going to eat you up there was just something inside of me there was something inside him there was a life on the inside telling me you can't be defeated you're an overcomer how do you know that you're here today how many wants to express god in all his glory like that little lily you want to express god and all his glory as the musicians come i've got a few few scriptures i want to read to you as an encouragement to you i think you'll enjoy these because it's speaking about you it's speaking about you the overcomer it's speaking about the believer in the last day first john 5 4 says whatsoever for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world how many is born of god how many have been born again you've been saved you've been baptized you're filled with the holy ghost you can overcome the world you will overcome the world the scriptures tell us over and over he says john 16 33 these things have spoken unto you that in me might have peace that in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world james 1 12 blessed is the man that endureth temptation for if he has tried leave a crown of life more precious than gold for what the lord has promised to them that love him romans 8 37 nay and all these things that we were more than conquerors through him that loved us does god love you it's been proven to me over and over that god loves me because he didn't he didn't let me go he pulls me back into his flock he pulls me back in every time i want to go a different direction god will turn me back john 1 5 5 who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god we believe that that's speaking to us john 1 4 4 ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world let's stand to our feet i just know i want to be at a place that when i come when we come down to the end when that moment and the twinkling of an eye happens and i think about that moment and a twinkling of my eye i don't ever want there to be moments or minutes of doubt in my mind i want to know that i have just let god live through me in such a way that when he comes it it's no question we don't need it this is not a time of questions in our mind this is a time to say god i need more of you i want to be closer to you god i want that feeling of the holy ghost i was what you have poured down into me in such a way that i live truly for you the rest of the days of my life let's bow our heads heavenly father we thank you lord for this day we thank you for this group of people that's come out this morning lord to worship you to hear your word lord i trust with all my heart that something was said that would encourage the word as it went forth i i trust lord that it sunk deep down into someone's heart that they could truly see who we are lord and the hour we're living in that this is not a time to be playing church not a time to be observing what's going on around us but a time to be looking for you father a time that we need to be filled with so so full the holy ghost lord that there's no question in the life we live lord we don't want to come down to the time and have doubts and questions in our minds lord

jesus says to me
