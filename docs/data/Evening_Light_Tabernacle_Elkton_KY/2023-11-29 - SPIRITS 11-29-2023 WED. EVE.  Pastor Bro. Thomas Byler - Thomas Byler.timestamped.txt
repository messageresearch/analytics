[1:29:14] in that is
[1:29:15] it no then said the Jews will he kill
[1:29:19] himself because he saith whether I go
[1:29:22] you cannot come and he said unto them ye
[1:29:24] are from beneath I am from above ye are
[1:29:29] of this world I am not of this world we
[1:29:33] got it this blessings to the reading of
[1:29:35] the word be seated
[1:29:40] amen our emphasis Sunday was Ben making
[1:29:44] the statement when we are born again we
[1:29:47] are of heaven and of God amen and we're
[1:29:53] citizens of the kingdom of God and the
[1:29:56] Holy Spirit that dwells there that comes
[1:29:59] in you to make you act and look and
[1:30:03] think as it does
[1:30:07] Amen in that Nation where we're going to
[1:30:11] amen and better of course was talking
[1:30:13] about Sweden he was talking about
[1:30:15] Germany he was talking about America and
[1:30:17] so forth and uh all these different
[1:30:19] nations that have all these different
[1:30:21] spirits Ain that right and then he was
[1:30:24] def finding our spirit and where we come
[1:30:26] from and and so forth amen and so we
[1:30:30] want to just with the help of the Lord
[1:30:32] emphasize on this a little bit and
[1:30:33] talking about spirits I titled this
[1:30:36] Spirits because amen I want to talk
[1:30:39] about different Spirits different
[1:30:42] Spirits many
[1:30:45] spirits and we know that we're made of
[1:30:48] three things Body Soul and
[1:30:52] spirit and we know that the spirit that
[1:30:55] we have you've heard the statement many
[1:30:58] times you know that Spirit drives them
[1:31:01] to do something how many knows that it's
[1:31:02] your spirit that drives you so we could
[1:31:06] say that the spirit that everybody has
[1:31:08] is your
[1:31:10] driver is that right the spirit that you
[1:31:14] have is your driver it's what makes you
[1:31:17] do the things that you
[1:31:19] do amen hey amen praise the Lord so amen
[1:31:25] praise God now let me just start saying
[1:31:27] this that first of all there are many
[1:31:32] many spirits that are
[1:31:35] evil and those Spirits are many many
[1:31:39] different they differ one from another
[1:31:43] is that right they're different
[1:31:46] Spirits a lot of different Spirits we
[1:31:48] want to deal with that I want to I want
[1:31:50] to I want to talk to you with the help
[1:31:51] of a little bit about how some of those
[1:31:54] Spirits how they come in and what it
[1:31:56] takes to get them out is that right what
[1:32:00] it takes to get them out how they come
[1:32:03] in uh you
[1:32:05] know and you have to watch them you have
[1:32:08] to watch Spirits man I'm telling you how
[1:32:11] many knows you you know how easy it is
[1:32:13] to cop a
[1:32:14] attitude man it's very easy to pick up a
[1:32:18] spirit amen but what I want to say about
[1:32:21] the other part is while there is many
[1:32:24] evil spirits there's only one good
[1:32:28] spirit there's only one holy spirit amen
[1:32:32] only one
[1:32:34] amen amen only one now few things I want
[1:32:39] to focus on I want to talk Unity oness
[1:32:42] of that Spirit we want to talk the power
[1:32:44] of that spirit amen and as I've said
[1:32:47] that Spirit how far comes in how it goes
[1:32:49] out and of course much much could be SP
[1:32:53] just as far as reading amen just you
[1:32:56] could read I could just sit here
[1:32:57] probably and read all night where Paul
[1:32:59] talk about you know that we are not in
[1:33:01] the flesh but in the spirit if you're
[1:33:03] not in the spirit not a child of God
[1:33:05] they that are the children of God are
[1:33:07] led by the spirit of God Amen many
[1:33:09] different things like that and if you uh
[1:33:12] uh are led by the spirit then you will
[1:33:14] not fulfill the lust of the
[1:33:16] flesh amen we covered a lot of that and
[1:33:19] I don't want to go so much maybe that
[1:33:20] way as perhaps just a few little new
[1:33:22] things that like the Lord showed me that
[1:33:24] I want to dwell on unless of course he
[1:33:26] decides down that road amen but in St
[1:33:31] John 17 St John
[1:33:35] 17 and I really like it folks F The more
[1:33:37] I've been begin to think about this uh
[1:33:40] you know about how that Jesus told them
[1:33:43] look I'm not of this world you're at
[1:33:47] home here but I'm not at home here right
[1:33:51] Jesus says you're from beneath I'm from
[1:33:55] above how many believe that you were
[1:33:58] from beneath but after the New Birth
[1:34:00] takes place you got a spirit from
[1:34:03] another
[1:34:04] country another home another place and
[1:34:08] you are driven by that
[1:34:11] spirit and if I can't say nothing else
[1:34:14] tonight I want you to know and I believe
[1:34:16] we can all say amen and that is that we
[1:34:19] need more of that
[1:34:26] Spirit young people have some Spirit
[1:34:29] about you have some Spirit about you
[1:34:32] have some Spirit about you have some
[1:34:34] Spirit about you brother John oh folks
[1:34:36] have some Spirit about
[1:34:38] you huh I mean we need to have some oh
[1:34:43] don't you just love to get up up here
[1:34:45] and preacher you ain't got no Spirit
[1:34:47] about it's all theological and it's all
[1:34:50] historical this that or the
[1:34:56] other I'll fall
[1:34:58] asleep we all like Spirit we all like to
[1:35:01] be
[1:35:02] alive amen you know that say that if the
[1:35:06] same spirit that raised up Christ from
[1:35:08] the dead it will Quicken your mortal
[1:35:13] body and that Quicken me bring the
[1:35:17] [Applause]

[1:35:39] much and that this is one of the stories
[1:35:42] the Holy Spirit brings it to me so I'll
[1:35:43] go down this little Rabbit Trail or
[1:35:44] whatever one of the things I didn't tell

[1:38:21] if you hate God you love
[1:38:27] death
[1:38:29] amen I have a scripture here
[1:38:35] somewhere
[1:38:37] in because I wanted to talk to you a
[1:38:39] little bit about hate but it comes to my
[1:38:41] mind just now I'll just mention it no
[1:38:43] man can serve two masters for he will
[1:38:46] either hate the one amen how manyan know
[1:38:49] whenever you get the Holy Ghost
[1:38:51] me you get a little righteous
[1:38:54] hate hate that eats and Nick everything
[1:38:57] that's evil how many believes that when
[1:38:59] you become a Christian you hate
[1:39:01] everything that's evil he says ye that
[1:39:03] love the Lord hate amen hate evil in
[1:39:07] other places many other places I found
[1:39:09] where you know how the believer hates
[1:39:12] everything that's evil hated
[1:39:17] amen all
[1:39:19] right back to 17th chapter of St
[1:39:23] John we want to speak a little bit with
[1:39:26] the help of the Lord on on that one
[1:39:29] Spirit first of all that
[1:39:30] Unity that Oneness that the Holy Ghost
[1:39:35] brings amen and also in this scripture
[1:39:38] we'll find amen that we also are n of
[1:39:41] the world verse 11 chapter 17 of St
[1:39:45] John amen I kind of say it backwards
[1:39:48] don't I verse 11 chapter 17 know St John
[1:39:53] 1711 I don't know what it happens after
[1:39:55] 55 do that kind of say it backwards you
[1:39:59] don't even realize
[1:40:00] it amen that's all right when I get real
[1:40:03] old you're G to get real tired of me
[1:40:05] because I'll repeat myself repeat myself
[1:40:07] maybe I do already I don't hope so
[1:40:12] amen all right and now am I no more in
[1:40:16] the world but these are in the world and
[1:40:18] I come to thee Holy Father keep through
[1:40:20] thine
[1:40:21] name Those whom thou has given me that
[1:40:25] they may be one as we
[1:40:28] [Applause]
[1:40:29] are how many believe that there's one
[1:40:32] thing the Holy Ghost does it it makes
[1:40:35] you one with God it makes you one with
[1:40:39] one
[1:40:42] another
[1:40:43] amen so he's Desiring that the same
[1:40:46] Oneness that he had with the father is
[1:40:48] the same Oneness you and I are to have
[1:40:51] with
[1:40:53] him not a whole bunch of different but
[1:40:56] all to be
[1:40:57] one while I was with them in the world I
[1:41:00] kept them in thy name those that thou
[1:41:01] gavest me I have kept and none of them
[1:41:04] is lost but the son of predition that
[1:41:05] the scriptures might be fulfilled and
[1:41:08] now come I to thee and the things I
[1:41:11] speak in the world that there there that
[1:41:14] they might have my joy fulfilled them
[1:41:17] themselves I have given them Thy word
[1:41:20] and the world have hated them because
[1:41:23] they are not of the world world even as
[1:41:26] I am not of the
[1:41:29] world somebody give me a shout on that
[1:41:32] one that's right we're not of this

[1:42:00] dignity about you because you have your

[1:44:03] that by one Spirit are we all baptized
[1:44:06] into one
[1:44:08] body and members in particular I mean

[1:44:14] the Holy Ghost you get baptized into a
[1:44:17] body the body of Christ there's one body
[1:44:20] body there's one Church there's one Lord
[1:44:23] there's one Faith there's one
[1:44:26] baptism and there's one

[1:53:01] us to think the
[1:53:03] same I got to tell you I I don't even
[1:53:06] have to teach you if you've got the Holy
[1:53:08] Ghost the Holy Ghost oh
[1:53:12] my teach you the same thing you know how
[1:53:16] many preachers are preaching and if you
[1:53:17] look at it and you see how much of the
[1:53:19] same it is yes Amen brother the time he
[1:53:22] wanted to give a testimony Sunday and I
[1:53:24] it slipped my mind and I didn't realize
[1:53:26] that he had a 15minute testimony he had
[1:53:28] told me and I forgot because I've got so
[1:53:30] much in my mind but he says man it would
[1:53:31] have went along so perfectly with the
[1:53:33] message how many we got to be
[1:53:36] likeminded because it has to be the same
[1:53:41] Spirit we've all lived long enough to
[1:53:44] know that when you get somebody with a
[1:53:46] different Spirit there's going to be
[1:53:48] problems
[1:53:50] there's going to be big problems if
[1:53:52] somebody got the wrong Spirit why do you
[1:53:54] think it's so important to keep the
[1:53:55] right spirit in the
[1:53:58] church
[1:53:59] amen keep the right spirit in the
[1:54:04] church because it doesn't matter how
[1:54:07] little it's wrong it's still wrong if
[1:54:09] it's a wrong
[1:54:11] spirit
[1:54:13] amen all right praise the
[1:54:18] Lord
[1:54:21] there is power in the name of Jesus how
[1:54:25] many
[1:54:26] knows now let's look at Power for just a
[1:54:33] minute comes to my mind didn't have
[1:54:35] write it down but I think it was St John
[1:54:38] 1 says ye shall receive power after the
[1:54:41] Holy Ghost has come upon you it's see
[1:54:44] that or in Acts amen after the Holy
[1:54:47] Ghost has come upon you then you receive
[1:54:53] power let's go to Luke
[1:54:58] 8
[1:55:01] Luke
[1:55:09] 8 I wanted to
[1:55:11] compare the power of
[1:55:14] Legion with the power of
[1:55:17] Samson because they were both bre
[1:55:19] Breaking Chains they were breaking ropes
[1:55:21] they were breaking feathers a't that
[1:55:25] right and they arrive verse 26 in the at
[1:55:28] the country of the Gans which is over
[1:55:30] against Galilee and when he went forth
[1:55:33] to uh to land there met him out of the
[1:55:36] city a certain man which had Devils a
[1:55:39] long time and wear no clothes you know
[1:55:42] what brother R said people stripping
[1:55:44] their clothes off the only one in the
[1:55:45] Bible ever stripped his clothes off had
[1:55:47] a bunch of Devils on
[1:55:48] them
[1:55:50] neither Abode in any house how manyan
[1:55:53] know Holy Ghost will make you put on
[1:55:56] clothes neither he live in a house but
[1:55:58] in tombs and when he saw Jesus he cried
[1:56:01] out and fell down before him and with
[1:56:03] the loud boy said what have I to do with
[1:56:05] Jesus thou son of the god most high I
[1:56:07] beseech thee torment me not how many
[1:56:09] knows they got the tormenting coming for
[1:56:12] he had commanded the unclean Spirit to
[1:56:14] come out of him out of the man for often
[1:56:17] times it had caught him now these are
[1:56:19] parenthesis
[1:56:21] here caught him and had kept Bound in
[1:56:25] and was kept bound with chains and
[1:56:28] inets and he break the bands and was
[1:56:32] driven of the devil Into the Wilderness
[1:56:35] and Jesus asked him saying what is thy
[1:56:37] name and he said
[1:56:39] Legion I looked up how much Legion is
[1:56:43] Siri told me it's between 3,000 and
[1:56:48] 6,000
[1:56:51] and they besought him that he would not
[1:56:52] command them to go out into the de deep
[1:56:55] and there was there a herd of many swine
[1:56:57] feeding on the mountain and they
[1:56:58] besought him that he would suffer them
[1:57:00] to enter into them and he suffered them
[1:57:02] then went the Devils out of the man and
[1:57:03] went and entered into the swine and the
[1:57:05] her R ran violently down a steep Place
[1:57:08] into the lake and he jok how many knows
[1:57:11] another times uh he talked about how
[1:57:13] that he would cut himself and so forth
[1:57:15] a't that
[1:57:16] right now notice verse 35 and then they
[1:57:20] went out to see what was done and came
[1:57:23] to Jesus and found the man out of whom
[1:57:25] the Devils were departed sitting at
[1:57:27] Jesus feet clothed and in his right mind
[1:57:30] and they were
[1:57:33] afraid amen but said one place he says
[1:57:36] when you go into insane institution
[1:57:38] you'll find that people have lost their
[1:57:39] minds and so forth times there lot it
[1:57:43] takes a lot of people actually to handle
[1:57:45] them people they're many times
[1:57:48] stronger and amen I thought you know a
[1:57:50] Christian kind of loses his mind too and
[1:57:52] he becomes a lot stronger amen that this
[1:57:54] mind being you the carnal mind is em to
[1:57:57] be against Christ neither indeed can be
[1:57:59] but you got to have the mind of Christ
[1:58:00] you become much stronger amen if you
[1:58:03] have the mind of Christ now notice let's
[1:58:06] talk a little bit about spirits for a
[1:58:10] minute and how they enter
[1:58:13] in amen if you want to listen to a
[1:58:15] message I guess and I didn't even study
[1:58:17] this or look at it but I know know a lot
[1:58:20] of it amen where better preached on
[1:58:22] demonology enticing enticing Spirits is
[1:58:25] that right he talked about hard to enter
[1:58:28] and so forth I'll talk about that in a
[1:58:29] minute now one day B ban says down in
[1:58:32] the land of gadara No Doubt a sociable
[1:58:34] God-fearing citizen once lived but he
[1:58:38] got out in the wrong crowd just maybe
[1:58:40] married and had two or three little
[1:58:42] kides but he got mixed up in the wrong
[1:58:45] group amen how many believe that the
[1:58:47] Christian or a person no matter who you
[1:58:49] you are watch the group that you hang
[1:58:52] with young people watch who you hang
[1:58:56] with amen and there where a many young

[2:06:28] game is that right we just sit there
[2:06:31] like well I guess that's
[2:06:34] okay but you know I've come to the
[2:06:37] conclusion that maybe somebody that's
[2:06:39] that quiet doesn't have a child they
[2:06:41] don't have a grand child in the game but
[2:06:44] you got a child you got you got a little
[2:06:47] bit of your blindness all of a sudden
[2:06:49] yeah yeah yeah yeah you got to invest
[2:06:52] some blood in it you got to have some
[2:06:54] family that's in it you got to be a part
[2:06:56] of
[2:06:57] it but you don't know
[2:07:00] nobody I don't know about you if I go to
[2:07:02] a ball game I don't

[2:11:15] right now it doesn't matter what it is
[2:11:17] because we hate
[2:11:20] evil but sometimes that evil is in
[2:11:22] people and we don't hate people we love
[2:11:26] even our enemies but we hate that evil
[2:11:28] that's in
[2:11:29] them but you let jealousy get you let

[2:11:43] professors go to college and tell the
[2:11:45] kids the truth that all these attitud
[2:11:48] and all these they're actually demons
[2:11:49] out of the pits of hell that are jumping
[2:11:51] on their hearts that are causing them to
[2:11:53] hate
[2:11:55] people

[2:12:17] it's just teach them what it really the
[2:12:19] truth is that they are driven by a
[2:12:24] spirit those professors are driven by a
[2:12:28] spirit to teach them things they
[2:12:29] oughtn't to teach them and cause
[2:12:36] them black lives matter one of the
