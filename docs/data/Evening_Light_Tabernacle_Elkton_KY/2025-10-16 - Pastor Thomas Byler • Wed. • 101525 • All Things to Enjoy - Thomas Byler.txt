[Music] &gt;&gt; If you were blind and then could see If you were bound and then set free, &gt;&gt; then you'd understand why Jesus means so much to me. &gt;&gt; If you were hurt and then were healed. If by his grace God was revealed, &gt;&gt; then you'd understand why he means so much to me. &gt;&gt; I love the Lord because he died for me on Calary. I love the Lord because his power set the sinner free. &gt;&gt; Although I cannot comprehend, I know his love is without end. Now you understand why he means so much to me. &gt;&gt; If you were lost and then were found. If you were deaf and then hurt sound, then you'd understand why Jesus means so much to me. If you were dead and then felt lying. That's how it feels when you find Christ. Now you understand why he so much to me. [Music] I love the Lord because he died for me on Calvary. I love the Lord because his power set the sinner free. Although I cannot comprehend, I know his love is without him.

Don't you love him tonight? Amen. I love you for your mercy never fails me. And all my days I've been held in your hands. From the moment that I wake up until I lay my head. Oh, I will sing the goodness of God. [Music] All my life you have been faithful. [Music] All my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God. I love your voice. You have led me through the fire. In darkest night, you are close like no other. I've known you as a father. I've known you as a friend. And I have been in the goodness of God. And all my life, God bless you. You've been faithful. [Music] With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God. [Music] Amen. Praise the Lord. What a nice song. Amen. Praise the Lord. I don't know who made who wrote that, but it was a very inspirational song. Good evening, everyone. Amen. God bless each one that was traveling. Glad to have everybody back again. Amen. And thank you musicians. That'll be all. Appreciate the music tonight. Amen. Amen. Getting that time of year when days are certainly getting shorter. Getting a little bit darker. Amen. It's bad, brother Troy. When you come to church and it's dark already, right? I know what that's like. Amen. In the middle of winter and we're going to church. We got over an hour drive and but it's dark already, you know. Amen. It can seem like a long night, but Amen. Praise the Lord. It's worth it though, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, we greet you all in the name of the Lord and Amen. Trust God is good to you. And if y'all have need of anything, Amen. We're certainly here to help you in any way that we can. Amen. Let's just bow our head. Lord Jesus, we once again approach your throne of grace, Lord Jesus. So grateful to have a wonderful God like you, Lord. Father, we're just so thankful for what you did for us on Calvary, Lord, as Brother Steve and Sister Becky sang the song. Thank you for dying for us, Lord. Lord, and it helps, Lord, to understand just why we feel the way that we do about you, Lord. and we just desire God that you'll just bless the service tonight as I've been praying through the week and there was a certain direction that I was going and I just didn't seem to be able to really find the mind of the Lord on it and just prayed for something that you would give us and I feel like God you Lord you went a different direction and certainly in a different way but we just pray God that it'll be truly your mind Lord Jesus not myself but Father that you'll speak to your people the words, Father, that they need to hear tonight, God. And help us to go from here a better people than what we've come, Lord. Father, you've heard the different requests, Lord Jesus. Those who have needs, we know that you're more than able to meet it, Father. And we just pray that you'd give us the faith to receive everything that we have need of. Bless the reading of the word now, meditation of a heart. Help me to get out of the way and help the people to operate the gift tonight. Father, we just love you and commit ourselves to you now in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. didn't uh don't always really like to say this. It I think it puts y'all on guard a little bit whenever I tell you. Well, this is uh another first one. Amen. Amen. Kind of a first message that I really preached. Amen. On this. So, Amen. Um Amen. I trust be a blessing to you. I know I've preached many times on that while we preached on Sunday talking about blessing. Amen. Blessing. But I felt like the Lord had just given us something a little deeper. Even though it was something that we've ministered on before, but amen. If God's in it, Amen. It doesn't matter what it is, it's always good. Praise the Lord. So, if you will turn your Bibles tonight, we'll go begin um with First Timothy. First Timothy. Amen. Just a simple little thought. Amen. But anyway, 1 Timothy 6 and verse 17. Amen. Half the congregation looks down and half the congregation looks up. So, Amen. Amen. 17. Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high- minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy. May God add his blessings to the reading of the word. You can be seated. Not a title tonight. You can put it up if you want to. My title tonight is all things to enjoy. Amen. I was going to just call it enjoy it. Enjoy it. Amen. But I thought it'd be more appropriate because it's straight out of the scriptures. All things to enjoy. Amen. Praise the Lord. How many believes that every part of the scripture is inspired. &gt;&gt; I believe this part is inspired. Amen. And so we want to speak on that with the help of the Lord for a little while. Amen. talking about enjoyment. Enjoyment. Amen. So God gave us everything so you could do what? &gt;&gt; Enjoy it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, where I was raised, where I come from, they just everything's so hard, so cold, and you don't have much of a smile. You got to be staunch, you know, and uh you know, you you know, you just just don't find them smiling a lot. You know, you know, smile, a smile, I found out as I was studying, a smile is precious. &gt;&gt; That's right. Frowns come by pretty easy. It's easy to frown in the world that we're living in. &gt;&gt; When you find somebody with a smile, it's almost, whoa, what what what's that? What's he so happy about? Right? But he gives us all things, everything to enjoy. I thought I began to think about that. Amen. Now, I want to actually talk about enjoying and I'm going to tie that in with pleasure, having pleasure. And then we want to talk about joy. Amen. The other side is going to bring in a little bit of joy. Amen. And show you kind of the difference and how that we enjoy having joy. How many glad to have joy? Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Joy unspeakable and full of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. First, I want to read Amen. And you know uh what I pulled up on the meaning of uh enjoy. The meaning of enjoy. Well, you know, I first when I thought about this, I says, "Boy, you sure don't need to pull that up. Everybody knows what it is what enjoy is." But I did anyway. And I thought it pulled something else up that I kind of want to use the word out of. And it says to enjoy means to experience pleasure and satisfaction from something. Amen. &gt;&gt; Pleasure and satisfaction. Amen. Brother, how many know said in one place he said the world is pleasure mad. pleasure mad. Why do you think that Disney World and uh you know places of swimming and slides and uh you know these wheels and the I don't know they got all kinds of crazy stuff out there don't they to try to give people pleasure give them joy you know give them a thrill something to enjoy. Let me say this. If a person doesn't have God and doesn't know God, and the world is full of no joy, suffering, and agony, a lot of times they'll take a gun to their head or they'll jump off a bridge because life ain't worth living. &gt;&gt; So, I want to start out by saying that we need pleasure. We need enjoyment. You're eating really good or you're just quiet tonight, but That's right. Enjoy. That's right. Pleasure and satisfaction from something. To have the benefit of something. Amen. I like that. That too. Amen. The benefit of something or to have it as a condition. It can also mean to have a good time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Woo. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many come to church to have a good time? &gt;&gt; That's right. Thank you, Lord. We come here to have a good time. And mama stopped there and bring back the thought brother Brandham. He was world dating a worldly girl and they went out there and they were smoking cigarettes. She tried to hand her him a cigarette. Ain't that right? Tried to get him to drink and he wanted to go to a dance and they says, "I don't dance. I don't smoke. I don't drink." things. You said, "Well, what do you do for fun?" &gt;&gt; Well, I like to go to church. &gt;&gt; How many's having a good time? &gt;&gt; That's right. We're having a good time. We're doing what we enjoy, Brother John. &gt;&gt; That's why we drive through the dark. That's why we come on Wednesday because we got something in our heart that has given us joy and we enjoy having joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. But brother B said we can't wait for the doors to open. Apparently not everybody wanted to come tonight. &gt;&gt; Maybe you don't enjoy church enough. &gt;&gt; Hello. Apparently not. There's something else you enjoy more. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Or you'd be here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. And what do you think we're going to do when we go over there to the other side? &gt;&gt; We're going to enjoy ourselves. &gt;&gt; We're going to have a lot of fun. We're going to let the glory roll when the roll is called in glory. &gt;&gt; We're going to have the time of our life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Isn't that what it said? That's right. It means that you are having a good time. We're having a great time. I thought, boy, this is a Wednesday night. Everybody going to be tired. Ain't nobody going to feel like really having a good time tonight. But we preach Sunday. Ain't that right? If you really got God on the inside, it don't matter if it's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, whatever. You ain't got to get in here to get built up. No, you come in here built up. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All right, let's not preach that again. Hallelujah. That's good, isn't it? Oh, I like that meaning main meaning of enjoy is to experience pleasure. This is the most common meaning as in I enjoy reading books or we enjoyed our vacation. How many know there's a lot of people that like enjoyment? &gt;&gt; People do all kinds of things for enjoyment. Amen. They like to have pleasure. Enjoyment is to have pleasure. &gt;&gt; Bible says that in the last days people will be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. &gt;&gt; But I wrote underneath there he says our pleasure is loving God. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Our pleasure is loving God. That's what our pleasure is. Amen. All right, let's talk about joy for a minute. Amen. Joy in the Bible. Joy is a deepseated inner gladness and state of being that comes from trusting God even amidst hardship rather than being dependent upon circumstances. It is considered a fruit of the spirit and can be expressed through praise, worship, and rejoicing. Amen. How many know a lot of times there's a lot of rejoicing that happens when you're having a good time &gt;&gt; and when you're having pleasure and rejoicing in God's promises and salvation. Biblical joy is a distinct concept from fleeting happiness such as is often based upon worldly circumstances. Source of joy. The ultimate source of joy is God himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not external factors. It stems from relationship with Jesus Christ and the security of one's salvation. Romans 14:17 says, "For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but it's righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost." How many believe that's the kingdom that you and I are in? &gt;&gt; It's something that we all crave. It's something that we all thirst for. Everybody wants joy. &gt;&gt; Everybody wants happiness. Everybody wants to have a good time. Everybody wants to have pleasure. &gt;&gt; It's in us. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't have it paged. I wish I would. Now I got to go find it. Amen. Talk about pleasure. Talk about enjoy. God tells us that he gave us everything so that we could enjoy it. So God wants you to have everything that he gives you. He wants you to enjoy it. And I'm thankful I'm thankful that enjoyment isn't just for Amen. the good times &gt;&gt; are the good things. &gt;&gt; It's also for the bad. You know, you can have pleasure in the bad stuff, pleasure in the bad stuff. All right, let me finish this verse. Now, talk about pleasure. Notice this. As we say, talk about tying enjoyment in with pleasure. In Revelations 4 and 11, it says, "Thou art worthy, oh Lord, to receive glory and honor and power, for thou has created all things and for thy &gt;&gt; pleasure." &gt;&gt; Pleasure. Enjoyment. &gt;&gt; For his enjoyment. He did it for his enjoyment. You think that God wants us to go through life depressed, downhearted? with the blues. That's what like the prophet of God said. He don't believe that a a you know a Christian is tossed about. Amen. That he's got the blues and everything else. No. A Christian God wants you to be happy. He wants you to enjoy things. &gt;&gt; Sure he does. really in in in a way, you know, when I got to thinking about this and that title, it ought to attract we ought to have at least 10 or two hits on this one. Enjoying all things. Hey, everybody, they going to click on that. You know, click on that. You know, I like to enjoy all things. Amen. Well, just listen a while. We'll see if you like it or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Amen. Please place. Praise the Lord. All right. Got a got quite a few things here. I want to talk about our happy. Have you ever heard of your happy thought? Your happy place. You know, get your mind channeled somewhere and something good and something happy. [Music] Well, the Bible does talk about he says whatsoever things are good, report whatsoever things are, think on these things. How many believe you and I, I don't know about you, but we got a happy thought. We got a happy place we can go to. &gt;&gt; We sure do. &gt;&gt; I'm jumping around here now. &gt;&gt; All right. That's right. We'll get into that in a minute. The ultimate source of God's joy is God himself, not external factors. It stems from relationship with Jesus Christ and the security of one's salvation. Amen. Why? Cuz all those people, they go out there and they have a good time. They enjoy themselves, but it's a temporary enjoyment. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even at bars, the people come up there and they want to give you a drink and they'll say, "What's your pleasure?" Ain't that right? Well, tonight I want to ask the world. I want to ask you, "What is your pleasure?" In other words, what do you do for pleasure? cuz you're going to do something for pleasure. Ain't nobody that don't like to have some kind of pleasure, some kind of enjoyment. &gt;&gt; I don't know, brother Sean. Some people are just so sad and blue dear. They hate when anybody else smiles or is happy. They don't want you to be happy. I'm the kind of people I try to get away from. I got to go, man. That's right. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right. Another one. So, a state of being, it is described as a state of being that is constant. This joy is constant rather than a fleeting feeling. Amen. &gt;&gt; Didn't David even say, "The joy of the Lord is my strength." &gt;&gt; Amen. We really getting down if we're going to sing the song. He fills my heart with laughter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, we ain't started yet. Y'all ready tonight? Y'all want to have church? We We'll have church. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is a fresh one. I like it fresh. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Now notice it's constant rather than a fleeting feeling like happiness. Despite circumstances, biblical joy is possible even during times of sorrow or suffering. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; All right, we might as well preach. Paul said in 2 Corinthians 12 and verse 7, "An least I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of revelations, there was given unto me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me. Least I should be exalted above measure." In other words, he'd get so high on it way up there somewhere, God allowed a thorn in his flesh to keep him down. I bought these things of the Lord thrice that he might depart. And he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly, therefore, will I glory in mine infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore, I take pleasure, Paul. I take pleasure. I enjoy. I know that's a little hard to sink in, ain't it? A little hard to fathom that somebody could enjoy infirmities. Well, you take it what you want. He called it pleasure. All right. Sounds like enjoyment to me. pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake. And here comes the punchline, folks. Here is what make Paul happy about the whole thing. He said, "Because for when I am weak, then I am truly strong." How many know that when you are weak, he becomes strong? My strength is made perfect in weakness. If you'd never have cancer, if you'd never get downhearted, you would never enjoy the good time. You couldn't call upon God and say, "God, deliver me out of this." And when he does, can you imagine David when he killed Goliath afterwards? He must have had a dance party. W It was a trial. Sure, it was hard. Amen. And I had to have faith. But guess what? Now look, it's God that does. It strengthens you. That's where his fun was in seeing God work. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Evening light tabernacle. Our pleasure is in seeing God come. Amen. And change our situations. That's why we're happy. That's why we have joy in the midst of trials. The Christian, brother Bram said, is to conduct himself with joy amidst the trials that God allows that come his way. I love that revelation right there. [Music] Isn't it something that God has so fixed it that we can have joy unspeakable and full of glory? We can have our mountaintop experiences. And then we can have our terrible times. We can have our times of trial, times of rainfall, times of trouble. But how many knows that your trials, brother Bam says, sometimes we pray for comfort and peace and God sends us trial does the best thing that he can. Send us a trial. Why? Because that's where God shows that he's with you, that he loves you, and it makes you stronger. Even our trials make us stronger &gt;&gt; if we allow them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If we allow them to, it'll make you even happier. Amen. Even happier. even give you more joy because the joy of the Lord goes deeper than just a temporary feeling, &gt;&gt; a worldly happiness, &gt;&gt; a good oldfashioned mud bogging with big old trucks spitting that mud up and everybody hello. Next day, you know, all they're drinking and all they're getting drunk. Next day they have a big old hangover. We come to church and we we have a good time and we have a hangover. I was wear I was thinking on the church even the believer has hangovers. That's right. I like my hangover, brother John. I love my hangover because I'm telling you what, the Holy Spirit just comes and he encumbers us here on a Wednesday night. He comes down upon us. Ain't that right? And we get drunk in their spirit. We act funny a little bit. Amen. And then the next morning, guess what? Amen. He's still hanging over me. He's still hanging over me. I feel as good the next morning as I did on Wednesday night. Woo! I love my hangover. Woo! That's right. Make old man jump up and kick his heels together. Why? We got something to have be happy about. &gt;&gt; We got real joy. If you want joy, real joy, wonderful joy, let Jesus come into your heart. &gt;&gt; Get more of Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's why we think of our business and our work. Oh well, if my bank account has $20,000 in it, I'm a pretty happy camper. You might have joy cuz you got money in the bank. Maybe your retirement fund is up to $500,000. Woo! You feel pretty good. Well, guess what? That Bible says that riches grows wings and flies away. Amen. But I want you to know that's not lasting joy. We don't look at our bank account. We don't look at this, that, or the other. We look at what God said. When Job when he was in a bad shape, Amen. all down on the ash heap. God, man. He begin to say, "Who who uh set the foundations of the world? Who put the cornerstone out there? Who set it there?" He says, "Where was you, Job?" Amen. When the morning stars sang together, and the sons of God shot it for joy. Amen. He tried to get him in the right thought. Whatsoever things are good, whatsoever everything to love you a good report. Think about God and I'll bring you joy. &gt;&gt; That's our happy thought. Amen. What are we going to do when we get over there? &gt;&gt; We're going to sit there. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yeah. For a thousand years. Why? Because that joy will never fade. &gt;&gt; And it's constant. It's forever. &gt;&gt; Has anybody got anything to be happy about? &gt;&gt; That's right. Think about it. You got a lot to be happy about. I'm going to sit there under evergreen. I'm going to think, "Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord, that you thought of me before the foundation of the world. Thank you for your grace. Thank you for saving me. Thank you for saving me. It's amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved the rest like me. Amen. You can have all the deep revelations you want to. I just be glad to know that I'm a son of God and I made it to heaven and I'm there as his child. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Oh my. We get too complicated. go back to the simplicity of things. Thank you for Calvary. Thank you for what he did for me, for dying for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. He said that you jo enjoy. Well, imagine how long we would be, Brother Brad, if we just really start writing down all things. Whenever I begin to think about he gave all things. Amen. For you to enjoy Romans. No Corinthians. Ah, come on. Now, this is the nice part. If you could just scroll it down, brother Brad, I wouldn't have to go looking for it. All right, let me look see where it's at. When I begin to think about all things, there it is. It's just not on that side of the page where I usually look new Bibles. I like to keep the same Bible so that I know it's down in that corner up there. So, I mean, I think the other day at Walmart, I bought about four of them because I wear them out a lot. So you got to have about four of them the same kind. Listen, let no man therefore glory in men, for all things are yours. &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you we're pretty quiet for having been just told that everything's yours. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Yeah. The Bible don't lie. Everything is yours. He says, "Whether Paul or Apollos or Cphus or the world, how many believe the world is ours?" That's right. All of you sinners, all of that, this is not their world. This is theirs now. They're allowed to say they're squatters, but this is our world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Whether the world or life, how many believe life is yours? &gt;&gt; Or death. Death is yours. &gt;&gt; Or things present or things to come. All are yours and you are Christ. &gt;&gt; How many I don't like that last part. How many glad that you belong to Christ &gt;&gt; and you're a joined heir of everything he gets. You're a joined heir. &gt;&gt; Just like a wife, she has everything the husband has. &gt;&gt; Everything is yours. All things. Praise be to God. Amen. So why shouldn't we have joy in our hearts? Amen. In Psalms 16 and verse 11 it says, "Thou wilt show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy." &gt;&gt; How many loves just to worship the Lord, come to church, hear the word of God, sing those songs, bathe in his presence. That's why I know maybe we should more, but just after church, you know, we just dart out of here. Maybe sometimes we linger a little bit. &gt;&gt; Just bask in his presence. &gt;&gt; Bask in it. Amen. Listen. In his presence is fullness of joy. At thy r right hand are pleasures forever more. How many knows that being with God is a real pleasure? We take pleasure in the presence of Almighty God. There's so many pleasures. Amen. In Christ. Praise the Lord. Amen. It is so satisfying. People will do just about anything for that pleasure. Is that right? Why do you think that they get wicked and wicked and wicer? Because what they did do doesn't satisfy them anymore. &gt;&gt; Doesn't give them pleasure anymore. Brother Brandon been preaching said the women had become so common to man that ma man left man and went with man. had become so common. &gt;&gt; Hello. They had become so wicked. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And now look at where it's at. Gotten even worse. There's no end. Why? Because they can never find what they're looking for. &gt;&gt; They'll never find that joy that you have. &gt;&gt; Amen. That true enjoyment, the real pleasure that comes with knowing that your sins are gone. &gt;&gt; How many believes that it's a real pleasure to know that you've been forgiven of your sins? It's a real pleasure to know that you've been justified, &gt;&gt; that you're righteous before God. The real pleasure that we have, the real enjoyment that we have is our fellowship with Almighty God on a daily basis, &gt;&gt; whether you're at home or whether you're at work or wherever you are. &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you, brother Brian commotes it every time he comes up here, but you got to have that personal relationship with God, that personal walk with God. There's nothing in the world like it. If you don't have that, get it. I don't care if you got to stay in a corn field. You're half starved. Maybe all the way. Go right to the point of death. Like old Buddy Robinson said, "God, if you don't give me the Holy Ghost, you're going to come back and find a pile of bones in this place." He got desperate about it and God come on the scene. Amen. The world wants pleasure. They do. And everything they do, they do because of that thirsting that's in their heart. How many is enjoying having that thirst quenched? &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I'm glad that God come and quenched that thirst in my soul. He said, "You drink this water, you'll never thirst again. Eat this food and you'll never hunger again." I thank God I am enjoying the fact that we've eating a food that fills that satisfy. I don't have to have another nose ring. I don't have look like some bull walking around running around with a nose ring. Hello. Or my earrings. Or I don't. No. I'm happy. I mean, he's happy. &gt;&gt; That's right. I I'm glad. I I I enjoy my life because he's in control. That's the only way you'll ever really enjoy life is if he's in control. &gt;&gt; Amen. I like to hunt. I like to fish. Amen. Some people get their enjoyment out of uh NASCAR. They get it out of uh Disney World. They get it out of hunting. You know, there's a sign that says, "And you know, I've hunted almost every day of my life. They love it. That's their pleasure. And every other day has been wasted." That's a fanatic, ain't it? It's a little bit overboard. Hello. But I'm here to tell you, Amen. Every day that you don't spend with God is wasted. &gt;&gt; Amen. And fellowshipping with God, that's a waste of time. Amen. All of those things will never satisfy. &gt;&gt; They'll never give you real enjoyment. They never give you true joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The sinner, he wants to enjoy things. But Bam says in enticing spirits, the church comes in and adopts other things. They have to have a little party where they can all lay in the beach for recreation or a little enjoyment. How many knows they even go on the beaches for enjoyment, &gt;&gt; for pleasure? They think maybe they get a little peace out there looking at the sunset. How many knows looking at the sunset's not going to give you any peace? No. Drinking a beer or dope or whatever, it's not going to give you any peace. &gt;&gt; No. A card party to get together, even a church for fellowship. That's right. Have to dance somewhere. one another the member's house sometimes maybe even the church basement a dance adopting trying to get something to satisfy what's the matter he says they're a bunch of pigs anyway they're pigs to begin with he says if ever they come in contact with Christ they'd have so much joy those things would be dead than midnight to them &gt;&gt; gospel drunk on the spirit amen joy unspeakable and full of glory. &gt;&gt; If your joy isn't contagious, then you ain't got enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't condemn the sinner. Have mercy on him. Let him go ahead and smoke his pipe. Let him drink his liquor. Let him have his car parties. That's his pleasure. Don't blame him coming home and everything tired and wore out. He wants some pleasure. Isn't that right? Everybody wants some pleasure. Everybody wants enjoyment. But the thing for you to do is to live such a godly life that you can prove to him that the gospel holds 10,000 times more than that for him. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? Amen. Let him know there's something so much greater than that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Than what they have. &gt;&gt; Amen. My Then he goes to say and if he dies in that state, he'll go under a devil's intoxication dragging that old pipe. God's his judge. Amen. But there's one thing. If you die under the anointing power of the Holy Ghost, like Steven did when he looked up in the face of God said, "I see the heavens open and Jesus standing at the right hand of God." You're a heavenbound bird. Amen. One more. I like this one. An old famous one. You'll know where I'm going in a minute. Have you ever noticed how the world gets into the spirit of things of the world? They go to their ball games, their sporting events, their dances, and enter into the spirit of it. They don't sit there like wall flowers. &gt;&gt; Hello. Old dried up sticks. They ready right into the feel of things. Amen. And become part of things. But oh, they hate the Christian for getting in the spirit of God's word. Amen. How many believe that we get in the spirit of God's word? &gt;&gt; They call us fanatics and holy rollers. They call us crazy. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; After the way that they call hair or heresy, so worshiped by the God of my father. &gt;&gt; Amen. Think about it. They want to call you crazy. Amen. Matthew 5, I believe it is. Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Amen. Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake. Rejoice. Woo. &gt;&gt; What's Let me hear what rejoicing sounds like. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Woo. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. Rejoice and be exceeding glad. &gt;&gt; Be exceeding glad when they call you oldfashioned. Amen. Why? Because you're worthy. Remember when Peter them were beaten and everything else and persecuted, they went out there and they rejoiced. They were happy because they were found worthy to suffer for the cross. They were having a good time. They were enjoying. That was their pleasure. &gt;&gt; That was to suffer for Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Be exceedingly glad. Rejoice and be exceedingly glad when they make fun of you. Amen. Call me crazy if you want to. I'm not the one with pink hair and nose rings and look like a freak. &gt;&gt; Amen. Boy, it's just terrible out there, isn't it? &gt;&gt; I don't know where I was today for sure. I guess it was Menard or something. And you know, there there you are in line. There's a woman right in front of you with these little bitty old shorts on. And I says, you know, that's a perfect that's her underwear. Where where's your skirt? I thought, boy, you really want to say, "Hey, lady, you forgot your skirt." Didn't have the nerve. Y'all forgive me. [Applause] But that's the truth, ain't it? That's the world we're living in. &gt;&gt; People go out there and don't realize they completely forgot to get dressed everywhere, too, isn't it? You thought it was bad when Brother Brandon was here. Look at it right out now. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Our sisters wears those tights maybe in sports and so forth and that's good. But Lord of mercy, I probably should have already a time or two had to talk with somebody come in here in tights. Hello. At least our sisters wear their skirts. Praise the Lord. All right. Well, that wasn't in the script, so I don't know. That's just the world we're living in. Aren't you glad that Hey, if they've called you oldfashioned, Peter and they were beaten. &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul when he was talking about his I was thrice was I beaten with rods. Amen. A shipwreck. How many knows? Paul said when I was in a shipwreck. Amen. Fixing to go down. He was weak. But then God became strong. How many knows when you become weak, he becomes strong. That's a good time for God to step on the scene. Listen, they won't they don't they don't slow their hatred and disapproval. But ignore that. You can expect it knowing where it is coming from. Just go on and get in the spirit of worship. Our spirit is clean. Our spirit is fresh. It's real. It is sober and it's serious, but nonetheless full of the joy of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Woo. And Christians, he says, "Ought to be just as exuberant and full of pleasure in the Lord as the world is and is when it savors and delights in its pleasures." &gt;&gt; Amen. Like I told you before, boy, I'll tell you what, when that guy comes into the touchdown zone, what he do? Spike that ball. Hello. When we say, "Well, praise be to God." Amen. Justified as though we never done it in the first place. Woo! Yeah. Just as exuberant as they are in there, we ought to be in ours. Praise God. When I was a sinner, Christ come down and he saved me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They go to wave and they just have a time. Yeah. Come on, people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just exuberant &gt;&gt; in our pleasures as they are theirs. &gt;&gt; What are we doing? We're enjoying it. &gt;&gt; Enjoy it. Go ahead. Enjoy it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Might as well. &gt;&gt; All right, let's get our closing statements tonight. I didn't pull the quotes up. Pleasure. Enjoyment. Well, brother Ber, what if I'm sick and dying? What if I come down to the door of death and I'm laying on the bed? How in the world are we going to enjoy that? Have I got your attention? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, I want to tell you something. I believe that you can still have your enjoyment. &gt;&gt; You can still have your pleasure. How do I know? Because if you remember brother Bossworth when he was going, brother Brandham went to him and wanted to pray for him and he said, "No, brother Brandham, I'm just going." And brother Brandham in the wisdom of a Godly man asked him, "When was your greatest time? When was the greatest enjoyment? Where's the greatest time of your pleasure? What was the best time of when people getting healed, eyes coming open? What was it? When is your greatest pleasure? He said, "No, not back then. Right now." &gt;&gt; He said, "This is the best time of my life cuz I'm 5 minutes from now. I'm going to go into the presence of God. I'm going to go and be where I've wanted to be the whole time." Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to make a statement that should stick down in our hard drive. I believe brother Bosworth lived his life for that day. He kept looking for that day. How many knows brother Brandham did? He looked for the day that he would go see Hope and Sharon Rose. He looked and lived for that day. Evan Bosworth must have lived for that day. How many believes that you'll live right? You'll do right. Ain't nobody going to have to tell you, preach you, or put you in the church band to try to get you to do right. If you'll look at that last day when I come down to that door of death, how many would say, "That's how I want to go." If I go by the way of the grave, that's how I want to go. I wanted to say, "This is my time of my life. This is the best time. I'm fixing to go." Paul Raider, he was dying, ain't that right? And they were singing near my God to some kind of a sad song or whatever. He says, "Come on, pull them saints back." Who's down here? Me or you? Sense of humor. Down at the cross where my savior down some chipper song. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even in death, you can have joy. How many believes &gt;&gt; you can have joy? You can have pleasure because that's what you're living for. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you'll live right if you look for that day. Live for that day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul when he come down to that says, "Oh death, oh death, where's your sting? Oh grave, where's your victory?" But I thank G God through Jesus Christ that gives us the victory. Amen. How many's glad to have victory tonight? &gt;&gt; Victory is mine. Amen. I found the pleasure I once craved. I forget just how it goes. It is joy and peace within. It is like a great overwhelming flood springing up within my soul. It is joy unspeakable and full of glory. Full of glory, full of glory. It is joy unspeakable and full of glory. Oh, the half has never yet been told. God bless you. Stand with me. Have a prayer before we turn it over to brother David. How many tonight would admit that you need more of the joy of the Lord? &gt;&gt; You need to enjoy this whole thing a whole lot better than you do. Raise your hand if that's the truth. Lord Jesus, you know why you laid that on my hand, my heart, Lord. I said, God, you lay what we need, Father, on our hearts, Lord. And I know I need that, Lord. Father, it shouldn't be out in the barn that I scream and holler and worship you, Lord. But wherever I am, we should enjoy the presence of God. And that goes for every one of us, Lord. We got our hands raised and saying, Lord, we need more of that joy. Paul and Silas when they were in jail, what did they begin to pray? And they begin to sing. and so forth. They had their pleasure to be able to be persecuted for Christ. They had joy that is everlasting that comes only by knowing God. And that was their enjoyment. That was their pleasure is living for God. We raise our hands tonight, God, and say, "Help us to go from here a different people than what we live Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday." Lord, tomorrow help us to have a different attitude about things to keep our mind on you, on the things that'll actually inspire us and give us joy. None of the things, our jobs and all of that gives us joy, Lord. It is you. It's your word. It's your presence, Father, that we meditate upon day and night, Lord Jesus, that gives us pleasure that draws us closer to you, Lord. Gives us true joy so that our spouses, our children can see that mom and dad really have something. and made a children say, "Mom, I want what you got. Dad, I want what you got." And you can pray with him. See, let's pray. You can have it. Surrender your life to God. And you can have that same joy, that same peace. Father, we thank you, Lord Jesus, that you have the peace that you've given us, the joy that you've given us, the grace that you've given us. Father, the comfort that you have given us. And we you knew we needed a comforter, Lord. And we thank you for that comfort. Amen. I believe it was when the angels come down, they brought tidings of comfort and joy to Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, Father. And that what we have in our hearts, Lord Jesus, we don't have to go to the world and all these other stuff for comfort or joy. We come to church to get more, Lord. And Father, we ask, God, as our hands are up now, Lord, give us more of your joy. Lord Jet does no matter what the circumstances is, whether it's good or bad, we can always obtain that joy in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. God bless you, brother David. Well, I have found his grace is all complete. He supply every need. Well, while I sit and learn at Jesus feet, will I am free? Yes, free indeed. Well, it is joy unspeakable and full of glory. Full of glory is full of glory. It is joy unspeakable and full of glory all the half has never yet been told. Will I have found the pleasures I once great? It is joy and peace within. Well, what a wonderous blessing I am sing from the awful golf of sea. Well, it is joy unspeakable and full of glory for love. Glory full love. Glory. It is joy unspeakable and full of glory. Oh, the half has never yet been told. And I have found that hope so bright and clear. The realm of grace and oh the Savior's presence is so near. Well, I can see his smiling face. Well, it is joy unspeakable and full of glory full of gloryful love. It is joy unspeakable and full love. Glory the half has never yet been told. And I have found that joy no tongue can tell.
