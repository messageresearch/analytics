lips of clay that has been formed by your hand and Lord may you just take control of the vessel and speak through these lips Lord and speak to the ears as well Lord that it not just be our carnality that's hearing the word and speaking the word but it would be the spirit that you've placed on the inside of each of us this this evening Lord may you have the preeminence Lord may you receive all the honor and all the glory from the service tonight we love you father we just commit it to you now in Jesus name if you have your Bibles this evening we're going to look here and could have got my top amen well we we bring you greetings once again we have had a wonderful time here with you all even like Tabernacle brother Thomas we've had a wonderful time with him I didn't know like you said I didn't know if we were going to make up or down out of that stand but we made it but it was the most disgusting stand I've ever been in in my life if I got any kind of ailments when I leave well y'all pray for me that's right my my my but we made it praise God and we're here we're honored to be here with you again tonight and brother Thomas and I were talking just you know meditating over the friendship that we've kind of formed the last couple days and you know it's just great to be able to to visit with people and have something in common not just you know not just things that we en Joy like hunting and and things of that nature but also this message and you know recognizes his love for the message and his love for the people and we're so thankful for that and you should be thankful as well that you have a pastor that that loves you and he loves this message and you say well he should know everything well you know what we're human so you know when that time comes God's going to give us what we have need of in that season of life but until that time we should just get behind the gift and let's continue to pray for your pastor pray for your ministry team here brother Brad as well and just pray that God will feed them what they have need of so they can in turn feed you what you have need of and you know that's how we're going to get out of here honestly it's no big eyes or little 's it's all of us pushing putting our shoulder together for the purpose that God can be glorified and so tonight I just want to take a little bit of time and I want to speak to you on he will finish it now we understand in the scripture the Bible does already tell us that when he bowed his head and died he said it is finished we already understand it's a finished work but you how many of you are human tonight all right good so you're human and there's a lot of times when we're facing difficulties in life we're going through hardships and we're going through trials sometimes we ask oursel when will he finish this have you ever just asked that question when will this be over I want to encourage you tonight he will finish it and we find here in Philippians 1 verse6 being confident of this very thing that he which begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ God bless you you can have your seats also look here in Hebrews 12 and verse two Hebrews 12 and verse two says looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith so he's not only the beginner of our faith he's also the finisher of our faith so what we're looking at tonight is that he will finish what he started so this word finisher here means completer perfector so there's a lot of times we get up in the morning we look in the mirror and you know what you you get older you get more wrinkles you get older you need B gay you need some kind of rubbing element ointment on your body because you know what pain starts setting in joints start setting you know inflammation there but we find no matter what we go through on this side out of Eternity we got a promise that he's the finisher and though we may not look perfect we may not feel perfect we have a perfect god with a perfect word and that perfect God and a perfect word is going to perfect the people and he's already put it out there and there ain't a devil in hell can stop that word from completion so I'm here to encourage you no matter what you're going through no matter the situation you're in tonight or the weed that you face God will perform perform that work he will complete that work he will finish what he started because he is God and God's got a purpose and God's got a plan and God's got you in his thoughts and God will not throw you away he will not lose you he will not forsake you God understands your situation and he will finish that which he begun in your life I just believe that you know we're human we Face hardships and we gone through hard times but we have to look at the word of God and and be like David David encouraged himself in the Lord and sometimes we need to just stop stop uh praising our trials stop praising our situation stop giving those things life and look to the word of God look to the promises of God and encourage yourself in the word that you're no longer out in the world doing the things that ungodly people are doing but God has called you to a message God has called you to a holy life God has f you with the Holy Ghost God will save your children God will heal your body all these things God's promised in his word and if God promised it he will finish it do you believe that so we find Paul here is affirming to us that that which he started he will finish and he's declaring that man has nothing to do with this you know you meet some people they want to take all the credit that's right I can't stand that kind of person I'm sorry any know they want to take everybody's credit they want to take they can't they can't afford for anybody else to get any kind of credit but Paul is telling you here and he's telling us man has nothing to do with this this is not a work that man started therefore it's not a work that man's going to be able to finish this is the work that God started and if God started it hell or high water God will finish it no matter how bad Satan he get God has already said that he will have a bride and she will be without spot and she will be without blemish and she will be perfect you think he's going to come take some imperfect bride no sir look I picked the best woman in the world in my eyes that's right she's perfect for me and God's picked the perfect one for him so we find here notice in John 1:12 but as many as received him to them gave he the power to become sons of God I didn't see in that scripture that man had anything to do with that at all to many as received him to them gave he the he gave them the power to become sons of God even to them that believed on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of Flesh otherwise nor of the will of man but of God oh Hallelujah so God is taking man he's taking you Humanity he's taking your failures he's taking your mistakes he's taking all that out of the equation tonight and God says I did it I started it and I'm going to finish it he's going to look beyond your failures he's going to look beyond your mistakes he's going to look Beyond those valleys that you go through and God said I'm going to bring my bride to a perfect end notice in the message possessing all things brother man would tell us I'm an heir of all things and we touched on a lot of that this past Sunday but and so some of these thoughts that you here today is be because when a man studies everything just gets poured into it you know he just he's on a train of thought and so this has kind of been the train of thought I've had for the last several months but he says I'm an air of all things amen it's given to me I'm an air I can claim everything that God promised me there you are it's mine how do you get it something You' done no sir it's unmar gift that God gave us and it's ours it belongs to us so it's unmar so man has nothing to do with this at all therefore Paul says we can be confident otherwise you can be persuaded you can be confident of this very thing tonight that he almighty God Elohim Jehovah I mean the the almighty the one who formed and fashioned our bodies the one who knew we would be here in what age to put us in he that began this work will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ notice this is a work that God started God thought of you and God desired to have fellowship with you so much so that he knew which age to bring you in thank God he didn't bring me in the horse and buggy age I like my truck I mean we get down the road pretty quick I don't passing these Amish and you know hey I praise God I'm not in that day somebody should say Amen a little bit louter than what you just did God's made way but we find see God desired in the beginning God desired to have fellowship with you I know sometimes that's hard to believe huh cuz you see your failures you see your mistakes you see your Humanity but God sees his promise see God sees the thoughts that he's poured into that and we find here God knew which age to bring you into he knew what family to to allow you to be born into he watched over your seed just take for instance there's going to be a child born here the 17th of May Joshua and Ayah this dude's all the way up from Washington Canada somewhere but God knew that there was a seed that needed to come to fruition that was already predestinated before the foundation of the world and how in the world Joshua Rivas scored a Leah is beyond he out kicked his coverage tonight but God already was watching over the sea they got to put this one with that one to make this one come the life cuz I got that seed predestinated for a certain age for a certain time and that's what God is here tonight and if God could say that and do that don't you think God's able to finish it for you and I tonight and even in our own homes and our own families with her own children he's watched over that seed and he knew where to put that seed he knew what church to put that seed into he knew what family to put it into he knew the right atmosphere and if he knows all that won't he finish what he started I'm so thankful that God's not depending on me to finish his work so he that began the work will finish the work and some you know it may take days it may take weeks months years but God will complete it remember the prophet of God said that a Son of God can go a long time before he ever recognizes that he's a son but inside of that son though he doesn't recognize it God put a deposit in there and no matter how much the devil tries to cover it up tries to smear it out try to ruin his name try to maybe tat him up and do whatever else ruin his life with alcohol and drugs no matter what there's a sea laying inside of that life you know I just think about you know how brother B would talk about different ones like Rosella Griffin who was an alcoholic and she cut the insides of her jacket out and stuffed bottles of whiskey in there cuz she was that bad off Satan thought he had that seed Satan thought he' had done it he' got her to ruin her life was in shambles she lived on a street and she was a alcoholic and controlled and dictated her life but in one moment in the presence of God in one service God came down and he still God tonight he can come down on a Tuesday night it may not be a Wednesday night it may not be a normal servant but he's still God and you're still his people tonight and he still got obligation to you God is obligated to his word and if the word of God is living on the inside of you then God is obligated to you tonight he's obligated to finish what he started so when did this work begin brother Joe brother B would tell us in the message Easter seal if you hadn't listened to that in a while I encourage you to go back and listen to it he says and then when we being the his children are part of him that is the attributes of his thing thinking notice we're attributes of his thinking and the thought is expressed and becomes word God's thinking now I love that that then each individual here that possesses this eternal life was before the foundational World in God's sinking it's the only way it could be cuz you're an attribute that's an expression of a thought see has become a word and the word has taken life and it's Eternal that's the reason we have eternal life we become Sons and Daughters of God through the Same Spirit by the same for knowledge of God so God fornew us and we're going to get into just a little bit and I I wish I I wish I had a little bit more time a few more weeks I got a several thoughts I would love to preach to you on the word would bring forth because you know man you just start studying down a little series and that thing just grows and grows and grows and grows and it's been one of the greatest studies that I've done but we find when God started in Genesis or when he stated in Genesis that he will he will have a church he will have a man he would have a bride of people he said let us make man in our own image God was placing it out there no matter what the age was what how bad the age was how bad it would get no matter what he was going to have somebody that was going to fit his image and so we find what God started in Genesis he's going to finish in theay to see an age so the thoughts that he had in the beginning will culminate in an end time people in an end time Bride come on bride see the church that he established on the day of pente cost will be the same church that he raptures in our day you say what do you mean brother I'm saying she's going to have the same power she's going to have the same anointing she's going to have the same Spirit what she did there she's going to do here we're not going to put the gifts on the shelf and say we don't need them anymore because we got the revealed word because we got the revealed word those gifts are going to be in operation in the local body so here we find he's the amen of God do you believe that otherwise he's just so be it the final say there's nothing left for discussion God's already put a declaration out there it will be what he says it will be therefore he will finish what he said that he will do so no matter what comes against the word no matter how many Devils rage war against it to try to stop it God's already spoken it and he will see it till its completion he will finish the work so in Genesis 1 and verse 26 you could go there with me if you don't mind and we find here this is where God is setting the if you would say the cogs into motion all the way back in Genesis but it actually goes further than this and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created Man In His Image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them so we find in Genesis what was God doing God was expressing his desire to have a family see before at one one point he was he wasn't even God he was uh the self-existing one therefore he made angels and Angels worshiped him and then he became God but those angels were created to worship him they couldn't do anything else but God had a desire to make Man In His Image and he put man on free moral agency so that that man will love him unconditionally that man would make a choice he would love God and serve God or he wouldn't love God or he wouldn't serve God so he was expressing his desire to have a family his desire to have a bride and God had thoughts of you thoughts of you being part of that family yeah I know sometimes you wish you wasn't born in the family you were born into right you know they say you can choose your friends you can't choose your family but this is not what we're thinking see God chose you put you in his family before you were ever born before you breathed your first breath before you ever had your first trial sickness heartache maybe before your first sin God had you in his thoughts think about job for a minute we look here and we find job job lost his wealth job lost his children Joe's wife turned against him my you know how that is Brothers No you don't hopefully not but you know I mean that one that's supposed to love you like nobody else turns against you won't you just Curse God and die job and job got down on himself he got he cursed the day that he was born but he never cursed God and we look here in job 38:4 God speaking he comes down because he's mindful of job same way he's mindful of you the same way he spoke to some of you this past Sunday we find here God begins to speak to job job where was thou when I laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou Hast the understanding then we look down in verse seven and he begins to say when the morning Stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for Joy not just during that time but all all the sons of God even down into the L DEC and age when they were shouting job God was reminding job he was telling Joe Jo before you ever lost your children before you ever lost your wealth before you ever got sick in your body before your wife ever turned against you job where were you at job you was in my thinking before I laid the foundations of the world and I saw you shouting I saw you praising God I saw you worshiping God did not see job in defeat he saw job in Victory and what am I telling you you're in the very thoughts of God tonight God doesn't see you in defeat God sees you in Victory God sees you Rising above that situation shouting and worshiping and praising God that's the way I want him to see me and how can he see you that way because you were in his thinking you want to talk about an overcomer you can't help but overcome come on Church you're a Victor you're the winner see God didn't see job as a fail believer but he saw job worshiping he knew that one day job was going to see and joob was going to speak out I know my redeemer liveth and though the skin worms destroy this Humanity of mine though it destroys My Flesh I'm going to see him my eyes are going to Behold Him him they're going to behold my Creator oh I love that see God had confidence in what he placed in job's life he had confidence in the seed that he placed in job's life and he knew that job was going to outlast a test and what am I telling you this morning that God has confidence in the seed that he placed in your life this evening he's got confidence in you this evening if you could just have confidence that he'll finish what he started so notice we find here in 2 Thessalonians 2 and: 13 we were chosen from the beginning the Bible tells us but we are bound to give thanks always to God for you Brethren beloved of the Lord because God had chosen from the beginning or God has chosen from the beginning you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth where unto he called you by Our Gospel so we were chosen from the beginning the beginning is not when you were born the beginning wasn't when you came to the Earth the beginning wasn't when you came to the Altar and accepted him as a savior the beginning wasn't when you accepted the message of the hour when you was in the beginning that was when you were in the thoughts of God and God chose you right there to be a son to be a daughter of God to live in Elon Kentucky to overcome and L of sin to withstand every test that the enemy can put upon you he chose you for this hour but for your natural birth God called you and chose you and placed you here man I love that God has so much confidence in that that it means I'm going to overcome notice now where did he choose us let's go to Ephesians tonight Ephesians 1 and verse4 the Bible says according as he had chosen us in in him oh that's just beautiful according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world there we go back to the beginning that we should be holy there it is church come on that we should be without blame before him and love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will let's go to verse 7 in whom we have Redemption through his blood forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein Heath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself so we were chosen in the beginning then he comes and tells us in the Ephesians that the beginning was in him in Christ oh my you can't lose little bride how can you lose don't get down on yourself encourage yourself in the Lord it tells you where you come from it tells you where you're going it tells you where you were chosen and if God chose you there God ain't going to unchoose you thank God God ain't like us brother you know God is he's so good to us he ain't gonna let you know one minute choose you next minute he throws you to the curb no we were chosen in him that means we will be victorious man didn't choose you the church didn't choose you the prophet didn't choose you the bishop didn't choose you I don't care who it is none of them chose you God chose you and when did he do it before the foundation you know that in one place brother Brown said that he created the the beaches and he created the oceans and he created the mountains because he knew that there would be a desire in some of you that like mountains and so he created mountains cuz you would have that desire because you would like that so God knew your thoughts what you would like therefore when he created the foundations of the world he created it with you in mind what a God we serve tonight God is so mindful of us I can't stand a beach I mean you get sand in places you didn't even know you had and you digging that sand out three four five weeks later but you can go to a mountain top man it's so beautiful and Breezy and cool and you ain't getting sand on the mountain top if you are you in the wrong Mountain but see some of you like beaches some of you ladies I don't know why but you do guys if you like a beach well I'm sorry but God knew what you would like therefore he formed it and fashioned it so notice we were in his thinking and he called us and predestinated US unto the adoption the place ing as a son some of us were without in the world without any hope dead in sin and trespasses but yet there was a seed that God deposited before the foundation of the world and one day you had to hear that eagle Scream one day you had to hear from your theophany because that word was already placed inside of you because you were a thought of God and every thought of God shall be manifested in its time in the age in which God desired it to be so notice listen what brother Brown says in the church age he said heing Is Now set forth the love of God he desired in love a family of his own a family of Sons Sons like him there before him lies all mankind as one lump of clay and out of that same lump he will now make vessels unto honor and unto dishonor but he says the choosing will be his own choosing then those chosen ones born of a spirit will be trained to conform Into His Image in their walk then we go into Christ to mystery of God revealed and he preaches Christ to mystery just after opening the Seven Seals and so we find here now the book is no longer a closed book now the book is an open book so the understanding begins to be illuminated like a Roman Candle Revelation upon Revelation begins to unfold and now he can see what the whole purpose and plan of God is and he says back in the back part of God's mind there was something that God was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed so now he's going just beyond the foundations of the world now he's getting us into the back part of God's mind going back into the thinking of God and he says so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed and in him was love in him was to be a father in him was to be a son in him was to be a savior in him was to be a Healer all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in God so God brother B says God had a purpose and a hidden Mystery and we can go into this and go into it but I'm not going to just dive off into it because I'm only going to preach just a little bit longer I'm not going to hold you too long tonight but we find here if you go and you look and you paragraph 457 brother B says Jesus showing that he himself God in him will be manifested in his bride in the last days so in Christ The Mystery of God revealed we find the purpose of God the plan of God God is wanting to manifest himself in a body never before no other age ever had him manifested in the body well we can say the Ephesian age right because we or yeah when the when he poured it out but we find that immediately they went into the Dark Ages just some 33 years after the establishment of the church they be to listen to Man versus the spirit and they went off into this to to the Dark Ages but we find it took a Malachi 4 Ministry it took a revelation 10:7 Ministry to do what to bring him back here again so that now he's no longer God above us now he's no longer God With Us now he's God in us and that's what God's desire has been the whole time that he can come and Tabernacle your Humanity so will be God coming in Bride form in this hour which is Christ The Mystery of God revealed so we find Christ the true headship going in coming in his bride doing the same works that he did at the beginning making ready the fulfilling of his word as he did at first John 14:12 he says now the head and the body are becoming one in works and in sign and in life Vindicated by God himself through his promise word for the last days he promised this in the last days he says now if you're spiritual you'll catch it so the great mystery is his coming and we understand we're not talking about his physical coming because he will come he has three Corporal comings he comes we know he comes to redeem his bride he comes for his bride and he comes with his bride but now we find him in the lesty and age and if you go back and listen to Christ's mystery you find he's here again but he's not here in a Corporal body but the prophet would say he's here in every detail same power same anointing same Authority same in every detail except the Corporal body why because it's in this age that now he can come and Tabernacle your [Music] Humanity oh come on that should make a Baptist Shout tonight that should make you rejoice tonight it ain't about you it never was you to have to do this and work yourself up and be good enough and do hell marriage and do whatever it was all about God coming in this hour and taking control of your flesh and your Humanity God Almighty Tabernacle your humanity and it's always been a mystery see we find some people that are not spirit spiritual they look at the vessel like Ain't No Way in God's green earth does that man got he ain't God and then you got some that want to deify the man and they said there ain't no way he can be human he's nothing but God our preach Ms not too long ago we had the answer and that was the struggle that Satan had cuz he looked and he said this man is supposed to be God but yet brother Bram said he was 100% man but yet he was 100% God so there's the question how can you be God and yet be full man be 100% man and how can you be 100% man and yet be God oh I hope you get this and all that God was he poured it into Christ and all that Christ was he poured it into a bride so what am I telling you I'm telling you how can you be 100% God when you're man and how can you be man when you're 100% God we got the answer tonight to the devil's question that God came in this hour and it's no longer us but it's him coming through us that which he prophesied that which he declared he's finishing in the end time bride so the secret has always been about your coming the secret has always been about your coming that's why he kept it a secret he was coming and Bri right for cuz if he knew if the devil got a hold of that and I want you just to see this just for a minute the Bible tells us that there's there's a reward to those in one of the ages he's going to give a white stone to and in that white stone is going to give you a new name that no one knows but he that receives it see it's a personal revelation that you know that you know where you come from Brother Thomas is one of of a pastor and a minister that he is he can't give you that revelation God and God alone has to impart that Revelation to you that you come from my thoughts and what you are is not who you are but what you are is who I am through you so God is coming to work through a bride so that his word will be performed so that he will complete that which he's already declared let us make man in our image and if we're made in the image of God shouldn't we do Godly things shouldn't we have the supernatural signs and wonders following our ministry shouldn't we be able to speak in tongues and do other things of that nature and see God manifest in this hour but we done got so spiritual that we put those things back on the shf and we don't want anything to do with them I'm tell you it's time to take them off the shf and let the Holy Ghost holy ghost in our church let the Holy Ghost move in our lives let them move in our homes let them move in our children let the Holy Ghost do what he declares he will do he will finish this work if we allow him to finish it and Satan fight you so hard he attacks with fear and depression anxiety and complexity cuz he doesn't want you to know the revelation of who you are he doesn't want you to get that Revelation he's doing everything he can to keep it a mystery to you but he that gets a white stone gets a new name do you know that the Overcomer of every age that the leot to see an overcomer gets the gets the reward from all the previous ages you get a new name you get to sit with him in his throne that means we're going to rule and Reign Church you ain't going to be sitting on the tractor raining we're going to be sitting in a throne riging that Throne is a domain that's right oh my some of you been looking for a domain for a long time well I'm telling you it's coming God's got one pre-planned for you I'll tell you what you're going to sit there you're going to rule and rain with him it's going to be a glorious time in the Millennium Church we're going to be sitting down at the wedding supper of the Lamb there ain't going to be a plate missing there ain't going to be an extra plate there God knows your name is there God knows when he put you there and God's is obligated to it tonight I'm telling you we got a right to to thank God for what he's going to do for us what he's doing in our lives it's been a mystery but it's no longer a mystery anymore we see Christ in his body we see Christ manifested in the bride but Satan doesn't want you to have this Revelation I'm just going to go through some quotes here just to affirm reaffirm the word is falling apart all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church at that day you should know that I'm in the Father the father and me I in you and you in me so it's been God all along you see his same works the church is ordained to carry on his works with the same Spirit you couldn't carry on the same work without the Same Spirit That's right The Same Spirit Carries On the work then he says in the super sign oh God if the world could only see that that God and man are one the super sign was first man he said the super sign was first was that first man that God could come in into all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he pours into the church the super super sign God and man together that was to be the Super sign of the last day when the entire Bible was to be revealed or fulfilled in the last days where is it going to be fulfilled in the bride let's keep on going now then he says but the church has got a super sign God back in the church manifested in flesh God United with man his sure super sign then in ver verse 1112 he says notice the Eternal sign an unfailing sign it will never fail the word and man become one when God's word and man's become one in St John the first chapter in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was made God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that's the super sign and if that was the Super sign of that day when the same spirit that was on Jesus Christ comes into his church to manifest the written word for today it is still a super sign don't you realize you're a super people you know when I was a kid me and my brother we we love cartoons I was Superman you ever seen a little fat Stumpy Superman well I'd wrap a a pillowcase around my neck and jump off the jump off the dresser woo I thought I was somebody I let him be Batman or Robin one of them little weaker cartoon characters see I always I didn't know God put that super sign in me that desire to be something but God has placed it in we because his spirit is now tabernacling our Humanity now we are the super sign of the last days nobody will ever see Christ outside of the life that you live tonight CU nobody else can manifest Christ but his bride notice he says in Christ The Mystery of God he said he has showed or revealed in every typed that's in the Bible therefore the entire Bible is a revelation of God's mystery in Christ the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose that he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible and all the acts of all the other believers in the Bible has been in type and expressing what God's Great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it so let's just look at some of these Abraham and Sarah God in showing he's going to take a bride and he's going to turn her back young again so that she can bring forth the manifested words we look in Boaz and Ruth what was he doing here Boaz took a moabit to be a wife it's God declaring he's going to have a gentile bride we got salmon and Rahab we got Joseph before he revealed himself to his brothers he sent his Gentile bride back into the chamber everything has always been about him and a bride him and a bride him and a bride it's always about him and a bride you are the very heart desire of God tonight so everywhere in the scriptures it's always been about that how many of you here are married Brothers come on John raise your hand High you you're married there you go you know how it is you got a beautiful wife you love her you tell her things that you don't tell nobody else come on brother you can say Amen to that it's okay I'll say Amen to it amen I tell my wife things I don't tell nobody else and you love her and you bring her close to you and you just begin to talk to her she knows your hurts more than anybody she knows what makes you happy more than anybody she knows you better than anybody so what are you saying I'm saying that God so longs to have a bride that he can pull close to his side that he can whisper to her his Mysteries he can tell her his heart's desire and that's what he sent a message for cuz he's telling her who she is and how much she means to him she's he's telling her her place in the economy of God brother B would say you know he said this lady here used to be Miss Bry but now she's Miss brandom and he said and we will be Miss Jesus Christ so many people ask well what is my purpose brother Joe how many youve ever asked that question question a handful of you good let me tell you what your purpose is you were created to worship God you were created to praise His name you were created to love him you were created to reciprocate God's love toward you you can understand tonight that nobody can love God like you you know the Angels can't love God the way you can love him and furthermore no one can love you like him so nobody can love no no one can love God like the bride and no no one can love the bride like him it's a match that's made in heaven it's a union it's an invisible Union right now but one day Church he's coming because he said I'm going to finish this work there's going to be an overcomer in leod deia and she's going to sit right in my Throne she's going to rule and reign with me in my domain can I go just a little bit further he said when the Jews rejected it the Gentiles received it which was the type of the Bride he said he could he would call out a people of the Gentiles for his name's sake he said then then he goes this little girl back here she used to be a br but now she's a brandom she's my wife and the Bride of Jesus Christ will be Miss Jesus Christ Hallelujah baptized in his name in his name filled with his power robed in his righteousness Hallelujah there she is and now notice that was a gentile bride but Satan is doing everything he can to stop that marriage to keep that Union from happening to keep the bride from uniting with the groom and he's doing everything he can to get the bride to fall out of love with her groom he places vices in front of her he consumes her attention consumes her time tries to discredit God's word gets her to doubt tries to Blind her from the truth but I want you to know Satan doesn't have enough power tonight to stop what God has already set in motion so when God stated in the beginning that he's gonna have a bride then he's going to finish what he said you know God's not like you and I brother Tommy you know God don't start something to get bored with it and put it on the Shelf say well I'll get to it when I got time thank God he's not like that CU if that was the case look where we we be well I'll just get to Joe whenever I got time see God doesn't do that God will finish what he started I love it so we find here brother B tells us in the identified Christ of all ages he said but in in this great God Elohim was attributes there was attributes there to be to be God attributes to be a father attributes to be a son attributes to be a savior attributes to be a healer all these attributes was in God and if you ever got eternal life you were in God's attributes because you got eternal life Jesus came as a redeemer and to redeem means to bring it back to where it started right he says you were in God's thinking so sometimes we need to be reminded that we were in God's thinking especially when you're up against a trial up against a battle it's nice to be reminded on a midweek service where you came from and where you're going and we find in the church a l to see and age brother bam tells us and this to me is probably one of the most beautiful quotes he said his very existence is for his own he couldn't even be God without you the attributes to be a father attributes to be a Healer the attributes to be a savior he couldn't have those attributes without you don't you see your Place how important you are to God he said his very existence is for his own he loves them and cares for them His Eye Is ever upon them see and he tells us that he will lose none of us but raise us up in the last day he goes oh I'm so glad that I'm resting on his faithfulness we look in jermiah 29:1 it's a very familiar uh scripture for all of us and God is speaking here to Jeremiah and he saysi know the thoughts that I think toward you sayeth the Lord these are thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end so this word thought here means plan or purpose so God knows the purpose for each of our lives and the word peace here means completeness otherwise we can say finished so God has a thought a purpose to complete that which which he started in your life and the reward that he's going to give the end that he's here is the reward and we find in Revelations 3 and verse 21 to him that overcometh will he Grant to sit with him in my in his throne so God is already saw the whole human race he's already saw every age and which bride will be in each age but there will be a final Bride of the final age and she receives a reward unlike any other age but because in this AG there's going to be one that won't taste of death but she's going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and she's going to rule and reign with him and we find in Joel 2 vers2 says I will restore to you all the years that the Locust has eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar the polymer worm my great Army which I sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that had dwelt wonderfully with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you should know that I am in the midst of Israel and I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed that word restore here means to finish I will finish so we find the devil coming he came through four stages the Locust the caterpillar the cankerworm and what did he do he ate ate down the brid tree trying to destroy it but God had already prophesied and put it in writing put it in the pages of the Bible that I'm going to restore all that he had ate down so what is he saying it's a promise he's going to finish that brid tree she's going to come up in the last Age and what she was in the beginning she will be again in the end she won't be missing a lib she won't be missing a branch she won't be missing a fruit she won't be missing nothing she will be a perfect bride because he had sent a perfect word and if the word's not perfect then the bride can't be perfect and let me tell you and we've received everything we had need of through the message that we received why because it's a perfect message and it's making is producing A Perfect People by a perfect word and if it's not a perfect message then we we must have him to come again to perfect the message but it's is already perfect that's why return Ministry people believe that they believe these little things I was out in California last weekend with a group of Spanish people all Spanish and they all are in the return Ministry are coming out of the return Ministry and they believe that brother brandom has to return because he's got to fulfill a couple of these quotes and if we believe that then what we're saying is we have an imperfect word because in the the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished so all the Mysteries has to be made known because he's a seventh angel that's why we're not looking for him to come back we got a perfect message everything we have need of for Perfection is found right there on 1200 tapes and he said you're going to eat in plenty you're not going to starve to death now if you starve it's because you won't eat this is one thing you don't want to go on a diet with you want to Gorge yourself you want to get gluttonous with this word and just fill your appetite with it because this is what's going to change your body and God put it no other age could capture a voice and put it on tape unlike this age what was God doing God was saving the best for last cuz he knew there was going to be a bride that was going to need this word because Satan was going to create an Eden but out of that Eden he was going to raise up a brid tree and she was going to overcome because he already spoke overcoming power to her I will restore all the [Applause] years I will complete what I had started brother bam says God promised that he would bring his bride out what would he do there would be a seed and there'd be a light in the evening time how would he do all these things just exactly by the way he he original planed in the Old Testament and New Testament it isn't through denominations notice he says how will he take his bride by the word not by a new cart not by some theolog or theological idea but according to his word he will identify her so the evening time message it's going to have an evening time people and it's going to bring evening time results that means there's going to be a people that's going to believe it so the message that we preach is a message that's calling out a bride not some intellectual knowledge not some understanding but it's the word that's identifying her because there's a word on the inside of her and when that word is preached there's a deep and that deep response to the word brother B says when the Deep call it to the Deep he said it takes more than just joining a church it takes more than shaking hands with the preacher it takes more than living a good straight life it takes something to satisfy the inside of you that pours down from God into the soul the Deep calling into the deep at the noise of thy water spouts oh Lord the Deep calling to the Deep what is the Deep the word on the inside of you that seed that God planted there before the foundation of the world and when the word which is the message of the hour God's voice for this day begins to speak to that seed on the inside it can't help but to come to life it can't help but to respond to the word and he said when you heard that you heard from your theophany I'm here to tell you you can't lose my we are should be the happiest people in Elton Kentucky man somebody need to tap your neighbor tell them to smile a while give your face a rest we got a reason to Rejoice Church no other age has had a message like this message and for God to let that message cross your ears and come into your heart and produce the same signs the same wonders the same love and the same life what am I what is it it's declaring that you are the final voice to the final age God is putting his print upon you that he will finish it through your life God's permanently showing you are the bride the one that's been prophesied to come sages and great men have been waiting on this moment and can I say it we're here can I say it we're here if you've been looking at the news Church we're almost ready to leave this place oh there's fears of another war on the side but I ain't worried about that we're not fearing another Great War we got a promise we got a promise before that comes this bride's going to be taken up why because the word's been spoken and he will finish that word God's going to finish what he started notice Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts this is a quote that we quote and quote and quote and quote and quote but please don't let it just be a quote but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm and boy we have seen some lukewarm churches rise up in this day and I ain't talking about baptist and Presbyterian and Pentecostal I'm talking about message they have lost their fire notice but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist spirit will come in the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless it EXP oses Satan revealing his Works attempt the destruction of God's people and discrediting of God's word right down to the time that he's cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows Satan knows that if the people get a true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible Army I know some of y'all are really tired tonight but that should have struck a cord somewhere man I ain't never like going into a fight but when I knew I was going to come out being the Victor I had some questionable fights in my life but man when I knew that I was going to win I squared my shoulders back and I had fun with it what am I telling you if you can get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern to withstand that Antichrist Spirit you will be an invincible Army that's why we preach to you the message that's why we preach to your faith that's why we preaching into a rure we want you to see the two Spirits within the framework so that you can by God's spirit recognize that that's God speaking to you and when God start speaking to you your faith will begin to rise up and then you square your shoulders back you're Invincible little bride you're Invincible let me just go some other places to where BR says here now notice Oh my he says now in the last days a true bride Church Christ seed will come to The Headstone she will be a super Church a super race as she nears him they and the bride will be so much like that they'll be in his very image this is in order to be United with him this will they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God and he says denominations cannot produce this wrong seed then he says in the pergan church age from a little group of true seed of the word God will present Christ with the Beloved bride she is Virgin of his word she is Virgin because she know no man's Creeds or dogmas but by and through the members of the Bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be manifested in a virgin and then he had a prophecy I no longer call you church but I call you bride God showing a separation a distinction you're not the church but you're my bride you're a super race A different race as we said this past Sunday You're of a prophetic class of people then he goes on to say he says now there will be a time come forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his godhead his deity through his church have preeminence in his church oh my what the anointed man referring to Christ but now the anointed people anointed people he says oh my to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom anointed by what accepting what Eve turned down and Adam coming back with the anointing of the word Oh my he said see Anointed with the word when Eve turned down he comes back and we accept and he's come back in this day with the word and Eve rejected that word she rejected that life but what he came back with the in this hour we accept it so we accept our position as bride we accept his life we accept his word oh don't you just love that he said now he the bridegroom he took away your shame he put it in the sea of forgivness by the washing of the water of the word he said that's what the Bible said and you're standing completely Justified as though you never did it in the beginning he goes oh this is my message to the church you're standing complete Justified like you never did it in the first place he says oh you're the pure he said you talk about our Thanksgiving I feel real good I'm more thankful for that than anything I know he says you're the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus and believes every word of God stands as though you never ever sin in the first place you are perfect what is he saying it is finished little bride you are perfect why a was it wasn't brother Thomas that made you perfect but the word made you perfect and the word blood for you and that's why you're perfect today he says you're standing completely you never sin in the first place God don't even know it so quit laying in the bed hashing it out out quit going over and over and wishing you would have done it just forget about it pray about it ask forgiveness God don't even know what you're talking about he said God don't even know it's in the sea of forgiveness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning all right here we go back before the foundation of the world back in the beginning you would say you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God and you're standing now oh Hallelujah I said you're standing now like you never done it like you're back in the mind of God like God originally created it and what God started God's going to finish it Church you're standing right there the pure virous sinless bride of Jesus Christ we got a reason to shout we got a reason to Rejoice we're not standing in a in accusation we're not standing in sin we're standing in Victory tonight amen the word has BL for us the word has perfected us and God said it's finished musicians if you'd come he says you're The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless Son of God standing with your pure unadulterated bride word that he Washed by the Water of his own blood that became flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was oh church he said your first wedding was a old you never done it oh you never done it brother Tommy you never done it oh the devil was reminds you you did this and you did this and look at your life look at the scarves look at the this and look at the that but in the first place in the mind of God God sees you job he sees you in Victory he sees you worshiping he sees you praising God he sees you oh he sees you complete finished product because why because it ain't about man's doing it's about what God has already done for this little bride and what God had done he is finished and I'm ready to declare to you tonight we are that bride we are here the wait is over little bride you are the culmination of the mysteries of God you are the culmination there's not another one promise let's stand to her feet and Worship the Lord this evening oh lotus in the preview of the Bride let me just go here just if you would play something soft and I'm ending with this he said there came up a little bride lovely in vision and I Heard a Voice by my side side of me say here's the preview of the bride and she came by and I noticed by the way she she was very lovely pretty young she was walking just in Step as she could not in a marsh just in a stride a woman you know how they walk gracefully ladylike that's the way she was walking coming to my left on this side and she went out of my sight and he said it was the prettiest bunch of clean dressed women I've ever seen in my life each one of them looked I was just dressed different they all had long hair and longer sleeves and skirts and so forth young women they look kind of say maybe 20 and she was the cleanest sweetest looking people I've ever seen she passed by test all right here we go he says now he says she was beautiful and said that that's the bride but now we're going to review the churches and when they came up each one look like they got worse I've never seen such a filthy bunch in my life I heard a noise and it's it said Here Comes the American group and he showed me the church and they come up from each age and how vulgar in the last one the last day Church age she was led by witch they were morally dressed so filthy looking they were marching to the time of twisting Rock and rolling those women throwing themselves just in twist with holding just a paper gray hypocritical you know gray looking paper holding in front of them like a hoola skirt holding in front of them and completely new from the waist up and they were marching or time twisting and carrying on with the music and walking up and that is the church and he said each one of them had their real short frizzy looking thing hair real short hair he looking all over real short haircut and full of makeup absolutely nothing but look like street prostitutes and he go when they passed by my heart fainted I thought well if that's what we've been trying to present to Christ as a bride all the efforts and things that man has put forth to try to bring forth the bride and vulgar and dirty and filthy looking prostitute like that to be a bride of Christ he said it made my heart sick and we find Church it look like Satan is one this is the church this is this is what we can present to God as a bride as a filthy looking Church twisting the rock and roll I remember when I was in the Baptist Church there was a group called Skillet that they invited to the church it was nothing but hardcore rock and roll headbanging type music in the house of God I didn't know that before I heard this but this is exactly the manifestation he saw saw what I saw with my natural eyes but he said the bride will come in preview again and I heard he goes and here the bride came behind and the very same looking bride that passed by at the beginning he goes oh my heart jumped for joy to know that there will be a bride she will be made of the same thing clothed in the same thing the one that was in the beginning she will be called he goes oh I know that's to be the truth that this isn't the truth and every Vision that I ever had back had been wrong so he said the bride passed by and she was perfectly in the same position the second time as she was the first time he said notice now others the others when they went off they went off into chaos and destruction but when he saw the bride she didn't go off into chaos and destruction she rose up in Victory what am I telling you little bride what that first bride was you are tonight you're the same what God established on the day of Pentecost is the same bride that he has here tonight you're perfect she's perfectly the second time like she was the first time oh Hallelujah aren't you so thankful and he said notice Masterpiece family has come again Christ and his bride ready to come the second Adam the second Eve ready now to return back to their home the whole picture has been Redemption from where it was bringing it back just exactly bringing it back again so we don't have to be afraid of the the political environment in the land around us and wars and tensions of war and fear of nuclear war and anything like that what God had stated in the beginning he's finishing right here tonight he's finishing mama and daddy is finishing in your children come on somebody he's finishing you got a right he's finishing in your children they may not look like it but he's going to finish it because why because there's a word that they and their offspring shall be there with them so we've been promised a body change he's going to finish that we've been promised a place at the wedding supper he's going to finish that we've been promised to sit with him in his throne brother John he's going to finish that he's promised he's going to wipe all our tears away brother Thomas he will finish that one day that's going to be a reality he promised that our Offspring will be there he's going to finish that we've seen prodical come back just service after service we're seeing it happen Church we've been promised that will never suffer another headache another heartache another loss he's going to finish that we've been promised that we'll never grow old never be sick and God's going to finish that as well he will finish what he promised and he's promised a bride and you're it God bless you tonight church God bless you you're it you're the culmination you're the revelation of the mystery of God all that God had ever planned to do every message God ever sent every preacher he ever put here was for the purpose of you standing right where you're
