whom the world cannot receive but it seeth him not neither knoweth him not but ye know him for he dwelleth in you and he shall be in you yet a little while but the world seeth me no more but you see

confess myself to him I love that um Jesus answered and said unto him if any man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and I will come unto him and make my Abode with him these things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you the peace I leave unto you my peace I give unto you not as a world giveth give unto you let not your heart be troubled neither Let It Be Afraid you love me and this one together and now I have told you before it came to pass that when it come to pass you might believe amen about drawer come on you may be seated John 14 there's one of my favorite verses I love having 27 it says peace I leave with you Jesus saying peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth peace there's no peace in the world he says again uh he says give I unto you let not your heart be troubled he said neither let it be afraid that's good it's encouraging and in the world we live in guess what we need encouraging I need encouraging you you guys might be living above where I am but I think we all sometimes need encouraging uh so the god hold him here pretty uh just not it wasn't very much notice they had but I was just going to go uh to Matthew if you go with me to Matthew 24 keep scripture portion of scripture you're here it's Matthew 24 it keeps coming back to me a lot but we'll just start reading through here let's listen to Brethren a little bit this morning actually it was on Gabriel Gabriel's instruction to Daniel and he was saying in there which we know the world we live in it's dark world it's not a not a nice place to live as far as um the world is dark but as a you know uh Abraham and Sarah were pilgrims and Were Strangers my brother Brandon was saying in this message he was saying how Daniel got taken he said at age 13 around 13 or 14 he got taken uh and to a foreign land a heathenland and where nobody believes like he did nobody sang songs like he did nobody was like him but he kept the faith he kept in the scripture he kept in the work for his day he said he was studying books and uh that's where this uh scr or message came from Gabriel's instruction to Daniel but uh how he kept himself faithful to what God had called for him to be he said and when brother Brown was mentioned he said 68 years he kept him so nobody believed like he did it was just him but anyway here in Matthew we're going uh to Matthew 24 we'll just start in there where Jesus is speaking to the disciples and Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came unto him for to show him the done left upon another and as he said upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately seen tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world Jesus answered and said for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many and he shall hear and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you'd be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet said for nation shall rise against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines pestilence and earthquakes in diverse places and all these things are the beginning of Sorrows then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake and then it shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because of iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall the same shall be saved and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for witness unto all nations and then shall the End come when ye therefore see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the Prophet stand in the Holy place whosoever let him understand then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains let him which is on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house neither let him that which is in the field return back to take his clothes and woe unto them that are with child unto them that give suck in those days but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the Sabbath day for then shall be Great Tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time nor ever shall be and except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened and if anyone shall say unto you Lo hears Christ or there leave it not for there shall arise false Christ false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect behold I have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert gone off for neither is he in this treat Secret for as the lightning cometh out of the East and even unto the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be for Weather Service the car forever wheresoever the carcass is there shall the Eagles be gathered together immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall appear the son of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and great Glory you shall send his angels with the Great Sound of the trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the Four Winds from one end to heaven to the other he says now learn the parable of the Fig Tree when his when his branch is yet tender puteth forth leaves he known that summer is nigh so likewise ye when you shall see all these things know that it is near even at the door brother said the the children of Israel were pushed back into their Homeland for that purpose rarely I say unto you this generation shall not pass through all these things be fulfilled Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away but of that day and hour knoweth no man not no not the angels of heaven but my father only he keeps going on here he says but as the days of Noah were so it shall also be the coming of the son of man B for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking now just say no in your personal lives look at what's going on in the world for us in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark they were living just their normal lives they were working doing whatever they had to do and they knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the seven man be then shall UV in the field and one shall be taken and the other left two women shall be grinding at the meal one shall be taken the other left watch therefore for you know not whether for you know not what hour your Lord doeth come but know this that if the good man of the house had known it well watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be also read ready for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season blessed is that servant whom is Lord when he cometh shall find so doing verily I say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his Goods the evil servant Chastain is hard but if the evil spirit shall seen it hurt my Lord Do It delay is coming well we're in that stage where man's basically saying he is delaying his coming and a lot of people are saying there is no such thing as even a god and shall begin to Smite his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunkards the lord of the that servant shall come in a day when you looketh not for him and in an hour that he is not aware and she'll cut a misunder and appoint him with his poor his portion with the Hypocrites there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth and he keeps going here in the next uh chapter like and The Virgins and the ten virgins but it's just Jesus pointing us to to us and telling us what it's going to be like when he when he's coming back and if you look around you can see these scriptures being fulfilled today in our in our life and what's going on in the world uh that's how it I had another um I don't know if I can find that one I had another quote here about but basically what's really what I'm saying you know the hardest he was saying that America needs uh needs uh people to be testimonies you know uh um missionaries basically and he was saying that it's harder to uh to for uh educated heed than what she was what he called Amer a lot of Americans educated Heathen to accept God and what's God's done in this day then for a non-educated heathen but if you look out there that's what all the churches they become they do they do their own thing they do whatever seems right I guess unto them or they take a man's ideas again over what God had said in the scriptures and what was brought out in our day and this is from that same uh message here Gabriel's instruction to Daniel brother Adam said oh God if there ever was a time that we ought to be setting ourselves in order to pray it's now for we as his true servant we see by the letters of the Apostles by the warnings of the holy spirit that were in the last days the Holy Spirit speaks that in the last days men will be heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than of God truce Breakers false accusers incontinent those that are good I understand it he said by the letter and you can see that in the in the media and all these things despise of those that do good it's not just good enough for them but uh to not do good but now they're despisers of those that do good they have a grudge or an uh something against you because you try to live a Christian Life but remember says and I understand that there will come scoffers in the last days I understand that there will be a nations against Nations and reflect this on the life and the day that we're in right now think about what's going on in the world nations against nations in the last day I understand there will be a tidal waves waves in the last days I understand that will be fearful sights like flying saucers just I think I read a little news clip uh some sort of hearing and some sort of uh discussions about UFOs I've never before that I ever known that Congress would go talk about come meet together and talk about UFOs what can be done about UFOs flying saucers in the heavens mysterious sites Brotherman says men's Hearts will be failing for fear it'll be perplexity of time and distress amongst the people I read that that they'll go into organization things and denominations and have a confederation in the last day I understand that women will Bob off their hair in the last day understand their well shorts clothes you know short close and walk with high heel shoes tinkling as they oh he said in the last days I understand that the morale will be very low in the last days look at the morale of the people yeah yeah very low it's really really low it's a to a set a point of being sad I understand that the preachers will be false shepherds in the last days look at the denominational preachers false Shepherds they're yeah terrible false Shepherds Gathering to their own self riches but they can't and he goes on to say last days they'll compromise yep they've compromised and will not feed the people the word of God but we'll go after Creeds and things instead but I understand there will be a voice and this is where brother bear this is where we come in but I understand there will be a voice come in the last days crying out falling to the people back to the original message back to the things of God I understand by the book those things will take place he says I understand that in the last days there will come a famine the churches will be so organized and so set to everything in the last days there will become a famine that it will not be for bread and water only but for hearing the true word of God and people will go from the eat system request from the North and the South nope that they'll fail to hear I understand that by the book s but in that day oh God they're in Elijah before that they become an end and he will have to have a message that will turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers to the original go back to again to the end and start I understand that it will take place just before the spirit leaves Gentile church and returns unto the Jews and that was out of the um Gabriel's instruction to Daniel well we're right on the verge of that my friend so if anything as uh the scripture says look up your Redemption draw nigh God bless you Brother David amen he loved Lord this morning I appreciated that very much this morning let's stand this morning and amen and it's just good to be in the house of the Lord or didn't it amen praise him praise him in the morning praise him in the noontime if we could this morning well praise him oh praise him oh praise him in the morning praise him in

can play one and uh thank you for that that music today so I'll read you a little quote here as you're we're getting settled in I I certainly am and feeling the presence of God this morning and feel like we're right in tune with where God wants us to be and um everybody do me a favor take your right hand reach over your left shoulder grab your seat belt and latch in brother Brown said do you realize that you're sons of God the atmosphere and the air that you live in you create a situation around you that either draws you're pulling God in or you're pushing it away one of those two things you're either drawing on God or you're pushing God away he said we ought to get ourselves in that kind of atmosphere create each one of you is a creator did you know that each one of you people that's born again is a Creator we must create an atmosphere amen turn with me in the scriptures if you would to Genesis this chapter one Genesis chapter 1 like I said I feel completely in tune with the songs that we're saying in the way things have come about and transpired and so I'm ready to uh to Genesis chapter one in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and the Darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening in the morning were the first day turn with me into Revelations if you would chapter 21. we're going to start at the beginning and end at the end I'm not going to cover everything in between I promise Revelations chapter 21. and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city a New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them aren't you happy he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God what a beautiful scene and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that set upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done it's done say it with me it is done I'm the alpha the of Life freely say inherit inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son may the Lord that is blessings to the reading of the word you may be seated I want to speak to you King Dom Builder Kingdom Builders in the message secondhand robe the prophet says when mankind the sons of Adam were backed into a corner diseases afflictions and sin canker in them eating them driving them to hell like taskmasters the devil has broke everything they tried they sent God sent prophets they just done away with the prophets God sent judges they done away with the judges Kings everything they've done away with it the law he'd done away with it they couldn't keep it everything they've done Adam's race stood helpless Adam's race stood helpless sickness diseases Affliction sin everything hell and no one could do nothing about it Army Come Marching In for natural beans here they here said this little natural people with nothing they could do watch this then in heaven something took place then in heaven something took place Adam's people was backed into a corner when you and I find ourselves brothers and sisters backed into a corner something in heaven takes place he said there was one that stepped out called Jesus the precious Son of God the ones thou called Jesus standing up there one day on Calvary he said when he seen the thickest part of any human life the darkest part death every man fears death he said and when Jesus of Nazareth run against every devil in hell when Jesus run against every devil that there was in hell he didn't some devils you fight he didn't say this devil or that devil uh maybe this devil or or maybe this sickness he said when he run against every devil that was in hell and caught death caught him and pulled him right into his bosom he said he called him and put him right into his bosom and conquered death he sent back the Holy Spirit listen what he said he sent back the Holy Spirit he said take this and do the best you can Liberate the people the Holy Spirit was commanded to liberate the people the Holy Spirit was given to set you and I free it was given so that we could be just like Jesus we could be creators and after gods just like Jesus he said and I tell you we got a fire I wonderful weapon of it it says there's no such thing he said but I'm going to pick it up and say we need to receive the Holy Ghost and because it will defeat every devil of sin drunkenness whatever it is we've got him on the run to be conquered I'm tired of running from Satan I like to see him on the run for a little while I want enough god in me that when the devil looks at me he said oh no he's up again I'm getting out of here because he's coming after me put him on the run and conquer him foreign he said it's conquered sin sickness Sorrows is conquered he said uh we are at the spirit in our own possession as Divine the branches on the vine the spirit emerging and energizing the church with the Holy Spirit we've commanded to go into the world and preach the gospel cast out Devils lay hands on the sick and they shall recover let me tell you there's there's big things happening around the Bride of Jesus Christ it's not just here but you listen to messages you watch Service as you go participate in Services big things are happening around the Bride of Jesus Christ in Virginia and Florida in Tennessee in Kentucky right here in Elkton Kentucky big things can happen with the Holy Ghost in our lives we have to harness the power harness the energy of the Holy Ghost you see in the beginning I'm going to lay some foundations now we're building today in the beginning you have God and he created the Heaven and the Earth and you see God began to create out of a thought that he had in his mind and on what he wanted to accomplish begin to build upon his thoughts and the Bible tells us the first thing that God is the creator in the beginning he created the heavens and the Earth so here God speaks and things begin to come into existence things that wasn't there are now beginning to appear and God begins to act solely this creation is solely upon this act of God this is not an accident this is not an accident that God said to set up and said God said let there be that was not an accident there was a plan there was a blueprint there was something in thought in the very Mind Of God that he wanted to create this this deity this self-expression of God brothers and sisters creating a world is work you ask any Builder work if you build a house it's work it's hard work if you're going to build a family it's work it's hard work if you're going to build a career it's work it's hard work if you're going to build a life that is surrounded and filled with the power of God Almighty it's work it's a lot of work it's hard work and God begins to prove that to us as he begins to build and he begins to speak the worlds into existence and step by step by step we see God using his Almighty power I want you to notice that there is an order to this creation the first there's an order to this that God takes the form of chaos you might say and the prophecy there's a little clinker began to drop and he takes this form and he begins to go into the Realms of the heavens and on day one God creates the lock and separates it from the darkness and he's forming day and night on day two he separates the waters and he creates the sky on the first part of day three he separates the dry land from the sea now notice that all of these I told you these were in an order in a sequence for a purpose I want you to notice that all of these were essential to the survival of what was to follow have you noticed in the Bible as time goes on you learned a little something from the people behind you you learned a little lesson from Moses you learned a little lesson from David all of those things were essential to get the Bride of Jesus Christ where she needs to be at the end time so God he begins to meticulously plan all of this out sky has to be a place for the birds the ocean has to be in place for the fish and the Earth has to be in place for you and God meticulously puts all of this in order here and he begins to fill these Realms that he has created on day three he creates plant life on day four the Sun the moon the stars the sky the lights are beautiful in themselves can you imagine the picture as God has been building off of this blueprint that he had in his mind and he's building step by step by step and on day five God fills the water in the sky with fishes and birds gonna survived without the plants that he put in a few days before nothing is out of order with God nothing is out of out of order with God nothing's out of place everything's in sequence in other words you can't lose finally on the sixth day he creates animals and then the Apex of God's creation the humanity to populate the land God and objects of worship setting up there with a desire for somebody to love him with a desire for somebody to worship him with a desire for somebody to adore him and praise him and lift him up you know a lot of times we get it backwards we we hope God will do all that for us we want to feel God's love we want to feel God's affection we want to feel God's blessings but the truth of the matter is it started with him wanting to be wanted by us he cares that much for you and I that he wants to be worshiped by us pay close attention here by noticing God accomplishes all of these things by speaking God's there God said God said God said God said let there be and it was and if we're many creators if we're supposed to be set in an atmosphere that God can be right in our midst and if we're sending an atmosphere if God said why can't bride say because the word says with the Greater Works is what we will do brothers and sisters this lets us know that God's power is more than sufficient to create and maintain his creation you think his plan is going to falter no do you think his plan is going to fall short no there is common a rapture somebody's going to see it might as well be me somebody's going to see it somebody's gonna live it somebody is going to translate right out of here bam and you're going to be in another dimension and then there's no more time you go from time into it we don't need to worry about God running out of gas you know we we we we kind of wonder sometimes as is this Creation in a dire state of existence so you know the world around us is looks like it's just completely Fallen apart and from time to time we look at it and we think oh my goodness what is going on spiritually speaking it may look so but nothing is out of order the chaos that you see in this world today is exactly what's got to happen things that are going on in this world the people turning from God losing their love for God and their desire for for God and church and Christianity it's got to happen but God's creation God's creation the true creation his passion what he loves and what he's passionate about the true love the Bride of Jesus Christ she's vibrant she's only she's in love She's On Fire for God she's moving on right where she should be she is making herself ready go God this creation is secure the believer's existence is secure Satan can't harm you he has to ask permission to touch you he can't lay a finger on you we're just like job you got a hedge about you and I pray that on my my kids all the time when they go out I say God put more hedge of protection around my children with that hedge of protection you know God doesn't need help from anyone or anything really to maintain his goals huh and I'll prove it to you at the end here God's going to have it God's way and there's nothing that can change that so you do you realize no matter how Grim it may look through our Earthly eyes as we look out there there is no battle there are no forces there is no amount of Chaos that can threaten or undo the creation that God has begun in his bride I feel so defeated you win we don't go on feelings that's why we don't go on feelings because I wake up a lot of mornings and think man I don't feel like getting out of bed I don't feel like going I don't feel like reading I don't feel like praying I don't feel like talking we can't base what we're going through on our feelings you say well well I I feel beat down you win you're looking at it through the wrong set of eyes you have to put your spiritual eyes on when you don't feel good you have to look through your spiritual eyes and keep preaching and keep pushing and keep pushing and keep building God's Kingdom in your very life somewhere between Genesis 1 and Revelations 21 this Earth was corrupted this Earth was seems broken this world seems to be out of kilter it seems to be filled with people and forces that are completely and continually working against against God's very purpose and it looks like not everything in this world is going according to God's plan and that's why the prophet said she can do the Greater Works we've used this quote a lot lately it must mean something she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if you get the two the revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church if you get that framework of the two Spirits he said in the Christian church and by God's spirit discern there's your key If You by God's spirit can just discern two Spirits What Spirit are you following what are you being led by what are you answering to what are you commit ment to what are you doing to then discern the two spirits and then she will be able to withstand the Antichrist spirit and Satan will be powerless before her brothers and sisters God chose to share his creativity he chose to share the creative responsibility with human beings it's God's choice not a necessity it's a privilege may I say it that way that God would entrust you that God would look down and say that person is so important he loves me so much he has dedicated his life to me so much I'm going to freely pour myself out upon him I'm going to pour myself out upon her and the Very works that I do up here they'll do that's the way God thinks about you so think about this now God is building a kingdom God wants to pour himself out into you and we've heard the story about the ocean right if I go to the ocean and I find and I jump into the ocean and I take a big old swallow a gulf of the ocean water there's about 92 minerals and salts that are in that ocean water and if I take a big old gulp of that ocean of water I'm gonna choke I'm going to gag I'm gonna spew because I'm not used to that ocean water now if I go take a teaspoon out there and dip it in that ocean and put it in my mouth what am I gonna do I'm gonna choke and I'm gonna spew and I'm gonna get that out of my system because it's the same 92 elements that's in the ocean in the vast ocean that it is in the teaspoon and so everything that God is the ocean of God's ability and his power to build a kingdom it all Lays right here if God is Faith your faith if he's virtue your virtue if he's knowledge your knowledge your patience your godliness your brotherly kindness your love your everything that God is because one teaspoon of God is enough and sufficient for all [Applause] [Music] we have to understand that if God is building a kingdom so is Satan but the difference is is Satan has zero ability to create anything he can't create nothing when we look at Satan we we have to understand he's a counterfeit he he's not an original he's a bluff he's an Illusionist he uses trickery he's he's an antagonist on God's people he likes to use Illusions you've all seen Illusionist right they can make things appear like they're not right you know you say I'm not an Illusionist I did the best I could do but they appear make things appear as though they're not so he's an Illusionist and Satan is this counterfeiter but the one thing I know the most about Satan to be absolutely true is that he is a liar and Satan is only as powerful as we make him Satan is only as powerful as we let him be he's only as big as we let him grow he's only as loud as we let him bark he has no ability and so here it is Satan if we let him come into our lives and we let him place the shackles of unbelief and sin around us we've allowed that to come into our home we've allowed that to come into this Kingdom that we're building and if we allow that to come in there then we find ourselves under what bondage we find ourselves under bondage come on church if we allow fear to enter into the channel of our thoughts what do we become we become anxious we become nervous we become scared that our whole world is falling apart why is that why are preachers preaching so hard on anxiety fear and nervousness I'll tell you why they're preaching on it because it's the age we're living in and the prophet said in the end times it's an age of neurotics and so we're battling those same Spirits you're not you're not uh you're not immune to the spirits that you're rubbing up against our job though is to battle them so preachers are having to hit on fear anxiety nervousness over and over and over and if we let those come into our thoughts and we let a doubt it flare up in our Christians life it won't belong to you even wonder if you're saved you will actually Wonder you'll begin to question and there's nothing but a lie of the devil it's an illusion that he tells you you're not going to make it you're not living good enough let me tell you none of us are living good enough none of us are living good enough we need to live closer to God today than we've ever lived in our lives I liked what brother Butler said he needs to get more into the word I need to get more into the word you need to get more into the word we need to stay in God's presence he knows Satan knows just what channels to get into to infiltrate your minds he knows just which Avenues to go down to he knows your every weakness he knows the weaknesses that your flesh has he knows the weaknesses that's been handed down to you from generation to generation Maybe by your great great grandfather there is a flaw in your DNA system because you're human and Satan begins to explore that and he looks back and he says you know foreign had this problem I think I can probably get him with that problem you think he don't know who you are he knows exactly who you are he knows whether he knows whether the uh whether he knows everything about your family we might as well say that Satan knows your family tree he knows your history but thinking about that thank God I know that my my life was bought and paid for on a tree on Calvary my family tree of my history does not matter because my tree is on calvary's Hill yeah that's where I get my freedom Martin are gone my soul's been set free and brothers and sisters the question today is which kingdom are we building this morning which kingdom are we building this morning you know the the Bible tells us that the Israelites were slaves in Egypt they had to make bricks for Pharaoh's buildings that's what they did they come down there and and there's a new King in town and this King he really didn't care and and Joseph meant nothing to him all the goodness that the people of God had all the freedoms they had it meant nothing to this new king and he comes there and he says you know what we have to be careful here guys he said they're growing in numbers and they're getting bigger and bigger and bigger and the more they grow and the more they stay in the word and the more they pray the stronger they get and they could just get enough people together to uprise against us and then they're going to overthrow us and we can't win the war and soon we'll be they'll be too large for us to defeat and to have bondage over them basically what he was saying was if this person brings his liquor fire and this one brings his look of fire and she brings her Lake of Fire and this lick of fire in this liquor fire and then all this leaks of fire began to come together we become an Unstoppable Army before pharaoh and Pharaoh knew that so he tried to hinder them by putting oppression on them and forced labor upon the children of Israel God's people under forced labor now pray question building the ancient Egyptian monuments but Satan has you do for him if you're not careful the great monuments were built with stones to the last eons of times we see it in the pyramids the Sphinx all the tombs King touch tomb all those filled with stones but you know what palaces the very home Satan the kingdom of pharaoh has built with mud bricks so that it would become uncomfortable so that it would be cool In the Heat of the day and warm at night and it was built on the backs of God's people there's a painting in rockemeyer's Tomb rockemeyer was an ancient Egyptian a noble official of the 18th Dynasty he was a governor of slave making bricks and it shows it's like a it's like a do-it-yourself step by step step one two three four and he tells every step of how it's done in these hieroglyphics the paintings in his town but the first app and what I would consider probably the hardest step was there was a pit that was dug in some of the best clay around they would put water in there and it shows in these hieroglyphics the slaves trodden and packing the mud and the clay and in this bog in their tracking and they're treading and they're bogged down and sin they're bogged down with with oppression they're balled down with doubts and fears are you with me and they're carrying the weight and the burdens that Pharaoh has put upon them so that he can be glorified this is God's people and they're going through there and they're looking at there and they're bogged down by old habits and they're bogged down by new habits you say new habits I thought we're Christians we shouldn't pick up new habits well let me tell you it happens and that's where bogged down the trip for us to get out of the mud pits we are far past time to be treading in the mud pits of Satan and Pharaoh's mud pit we have no need or no ability we should have no desire to build it any buildings for Satan and Moses comes onto the scene here and Moses comes onto the scene here with a word from the Lord and he says pharaoh let my people go Let My People Go Moses had a word from the Lord and God says Moses I'm tired of my people I've heard their cries I've heard their oppression I've heard their cries and I want you to go down there and tell pharaoh to let my people go now let me tell you if you're a king of a kingdom and you've got thousands and thousands of people doing your work in a service to you day after day after and you've got them right under your thumb are you just gonna say okay you can have them by no and Pharaoh didn't do that either he kept he kept a hold on and he said Moses had been true to God come through the trials now watch what Moses said all of nature screamed out against it as he took the Israelites on the path of Duty mountains on this side deserts on this side he said Pharaoh's Army was pursuing them and the Red Sea blocked them off all of nature screaming against them and he said there they stood it looked like God was a poor military man and they was trapped how many of these ever felt trapped you felt like you found yourself in a place that you're saying oh my God I want out of here so bad but this has consumed me so much I can't get out of it I can't get out of this I can't get rid of this fish I can't get rid of this doubt I can't get rid of this habit and you find yourself right there and it looks like you may be a poor military man because you've got yourself trapped you know a deer ain't very smart or a bobcat or a skunk or a fox or whatever they're not real smart if they find themselves trapped and these men find themselves trapped and he said it looked like God was a poor military man to push them right into a corner where they would perish well that sounds grim that sounds gloomy that sounds like a a day of doubt and a day of Destruction for the children of Israel but the prophet said that God loves to do that how many of you love it when he does it God loves to do it he said God loves to show his mighty hand yes he does he likes to show his power you see what kind of Kingdom we're living in we're living in a kingdom of power and authority and he said he's waiting to show it tonight in you he's waiting to show it to the center to turn him around to the woman of ill Fame to change her back to make her back to a young man or a young woman just took a wrong path to bring them back he's ready to do that he's ready to show his power to the man dying of cancer he's ready to show his power to diabetes he's ready to show his power to the blind they're backed into a corner he said he's put them right down there into that trap it looked like nature itself was hiding its face and he said one writer said that they got into a place and wondered what Moses would do and he had one command go forward go forward he said if you're in the line of duty no matter what it says go forward go forward he says the greatest experiences I've ever had or come up against is things I couldn't get over things I couldn't go under things I couldn't go around things I just had to stand there and watch God make a way through it we don't have to win every battle on our own God is standing there waiting to show himself powerful he wants to do it he puts you in places where he can do it and you can turn around and say glory to God he's seen me through he said that old colored man had his Bible told you know the story and he said they said Moses why you carry that Bible you can't read he said I believe it he said I believe it he said but you can't read he said you believe all to there I believe it from Kimber to cut kiver and The Giver too because it says Holy Bible and he says almost he said what if God you anything God told you to do he said yes I would he said what are you going to do if God tells you to jump through that stone wall the guy thought he had him stumped he said I'll tell you what I do he said I would jump and I would believe there would be a hole there if God told me to jump that's the kind of power that God is God Will Make A Way when there seems no way you know sometimes getting out of order is the best order to be in West but I liked it when brother Butler come down and sang a song on his own this morning this is the day that the Lord has made kind of goes with the scriptures did you pick up on that God moves in Mighty ways God changes things did you hear the song that Sister Laura played yeah it was gone movement is orchestrating the the whole system we build kingdoms you want an atmosphere build the atmosphere why do you think preachers pick certain songs and certain things that go with the message they pray about it they think on it they're building an atmosphere and trying to build an atmosphere that you can get yourself into and God can have a way to work through you to pull you to encourage you Moses trapped here in this place and he's right in the line of duty he says it says he's forward he said Moses he said one writer said that he believed God looked down through the pillar of fire with angry fiery eyes and he looked at that red sea that was trying to cut off his children he said in the line of duty they were he said in the sea got scared to look down through the pillar fire with angry fiery eyes and in the sea to say sorry I didn't mean to come on through I didn't mean to do that I'm sorry God that's how much God cares for you that's how much nature responds to the power of God and God's Authority he said if he can look through that Pillar of Fire and do that what could he do for you if you'll just look through the blood of Jesus Christ they crossed over the Red Sea see you rolled back they walked across on dry land you know they tried to debate that and they tried to debate that and they try to debate that well they can debate that all they want but God will put somebody in place that'll prove it there was some archaeologists and scientists they said this is where we crossed this is where it's at biblically this is where this is where it says it would be we're going to do some research 30 feet below the water was a highway a ridge 30 feet below the water and in that they found chariots and wheels and helmets and skeletons dead horses hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of Chariots scattered and littered across the Red Sea floor tell me it didn't happen how did they get there me and the task Masters are now laying all behind them dead God's people would no longer be beaten God's people would no longer be under the bondage no more no more treading in the pits of Meyer and bogged down by the by the things of Satan in their life the task my sisters lay Dead behind them and Moses's message of let my people go had come to pass you see we had a message from God in our day too we had a message from God in our day too and my people come out of her my people come out of denominations come out of your denominational way of thinking and listen to what God has to say hey brothers and sisters God is building the kingdom a holy ghost filled bride that will take her stand against the kingdom of Satan Joshua 1 it talks about after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord came to pass that the Lord spoken to Joshua the son of none and he said Moses my servant is dead now follow along with me Moses had a message let my people go the prophet had a message come out of her my people the word says to Joshua Moses my servant is dead are you with me Moses my servant is dead the same and God is now telling Joshua you go down here and you go over the Jordan you take these people unto the land which I give them you do it Joshua you do it every place that The Souls of your feet try it wasn't the messenger anymore Moses is gone he's not coming back I love the stories I love all that but the possum the squirrel uh the bees the Hornets the bull all of this are for you to learn and grow from that's for you to overcome you find your Beast you beat your bull because Moses my servant is dead and I go you go into the land he says there shall not be any man able to stand before thee all the days of thy life of thy life as I was with Moses you remember that ocean we talked about as I was an ocean to Moses now you take a teaspoon of it Joshua because I was an ocean to brother random now you take a teaspoon of it Brian you find yourself overcoming you find yourself doing and doing what the works of the Holy Ghost the Greater Works be strong and courageous that thou May observe listen to what he says be strong that I may observe and do according to the law which Moses my servant commanded thee now we ain't under law but we had a lot of really good words marriage and divorce children of a bride servancy godhead and he's telling Joshua sure you take what Moses said it was a sin and turned not to the left or to the right that thou mayest Prosper wherever you go I'm going to say you take whatever he said and you don't turn from the left or the right and you do exactly what he said and see if you don't Prosper everywhere you may go see if your home don't grow see if your job don't grow see if your spiritual life don't grow if you will get underneath the word if you'll get underneath the word and the message you will see I I get mad at myself because I do not spend the time I'm being honest with you I'm mad at myself because I'm cutting myself short of everything God wants to do for me my priorities are not always what I always said I think I got God first I know I don't this is just coming now this is off the notes but I told my kids I have to preach sometimes when at home when I feel like the I need to be great to make sure God is first wait for a director two you are away from you if he's directing you away or she's Let It Go God is building this Kingdom this Holy Ghost Kingdom Moses thy servant is dead but as I was with Moses I will I failed thee I'm gonna have good courage this law shall not depart out of thy mouth meditate on it day and night day and night I'm embarrassed I'm embarrassed when I hear people say they listen to three messages a day I'm embarrassed I get occupied you know Satan when those children of Israel were down there in Egypt and they were treading through the muck and the minor and they were doing this and that Pharaoh said they got too much time on their hands take away their straw he does that in our lives they got too much time to read let's give them another job they got too much time to study let's give them another sport to play let's put them on another travel ball team hey I'm preaching to myself pointing one at you three at me the courage if they were ever thou goest something for Joshua that it ought to do for us when we hear that that God is with thee wherever thou goest you know what Joshua did he jumped up and it said Joshua commanded his officers of the people saying pass through the host foreign everybody prepare your victuals for Within American River he stepped into what the word was saying in his hour prepare yourself because the day is coming and the prophet said he can see Joshua out there and he said he could see him a young leader and he said he didn't get scared even though Moses was dead he didn't get scared he said but our eyes and go across this Jordan he said something about it Hallelujah he says there's a deep calling to the Deep that's what was happening in Joshua's life because that River it was that they said it was at the time of the of the the melting of the The Ice and the river was flowing faster than it ever flowed it was roaring faster than they had ever seen and he's standing on this side and it's wider than it's ever been and he says in three days I'm going across there and y'all are coming with me that's courage that's courage and he said there was a deep on the other side of that River there was a deep over there calling saying come over that's me saying that probably didn't say that come hauling from the deep when we listen to heaven there's something there's a deep that's calling when you're sitting there and you're awaking in the middle of the night and it's laying something spiritual in your mind that is a d calling down saying come up come up it's preparing you to come up a little bit higher come over he said God shows there's something pushing down coming down to us he said when you hear that thing brother you believe this tonight believe it in the name of the Lord that the things we have done are the minor things to what God is fixing to do right now Prophet said the things that I have done are minor things compared to what you're fixing to see God do now you're going to hear of great things brothers and sisters when I listen to messages being preached and brother Byler had mentioned this too we hear a move we hear a call we hear a a movement of God amongst his people and it's preparing a group of people and it's getting a group of people ready and you're going to hear great things and every people's got different gifts in their lives and different Ministries and and different things happen different different singing abilities preaching abilities and this preacher preaches different than this preacher something's got a gift of healing some got a gift of teaching some got a gift of explaining but everybody's moving in One Direction get your people ready what we need are some joshuas to rise up what we need in this hour are some joshuas to rise up and stand faithful to the words been given we need men and women who will look art out of your mouth men and women who will March right across the river stand the the river that stands in the way of your Promised Land God is building a kingdom and I'm coming to a close bear with me Joshua 24 14-16 says now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth put away the gods which your fathers have served on the other side of the flood and on the other in Egypt as you serve the Lord and if it seems evil unto you to serve the Lord choose this day whom you will serve whether the Gods which your father served were on the other side of the flood are the gods of the amorites and who me and my house we're going to serve the Lord Richard and said God forbid that we should forsake the Lord and serve other gods what was he doing he's building a kingdom Joshua was building a kingdom and telling the people serve God after me and my house we're going to serve God Jesus answers talks to Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood have not revealed this unto thee but the Father which is in heaven I say unto thee thou Peter Upon This Rock my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I will give unto thee the king these are the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever that shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven he says this is the revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour not what he was in another hour what he is now the Bible expresses it's a grown in the bride it's growing the bride to a full stature he said the bride the Rapture will come forth he said and there is any any pre-planed by God it's all backed up remember I told you God is going to get what God wants none of us are going to do anything outside of what God wants us to do listen to this quote the bride is in the right and the Rapture will come forth there is an all pre-planned by God all backed up from the beginning he knows every man every place who would sit all about it he know the exact seat you'd be setting in this morning June the 30th July 30th 2023. he knew when you'd get that go to the bathroom he knew what songs we were going to sing he knew it and who wouldn't see Steve he said it's all pre-blind God knew it would be here he made it that way so that when we get there he's gone to prepare a place for us he said when we get there it'll all be prepared just like even the night is prepared and this hour's prepared building a kingdom God's Building A kingdom I'm searching for a city whose Builder and maker is God he's on the omnipresent because he's omniscient he's omniscient because he's omnipresent therefore by his foreknowledge he can't just be like the wind over here and he's a bean he just isn't a myth he's a being he dwells he dwells in a house he dwells in a place called heaven and therefore being omnipresent omniscient knowing all things and omnipresent he knows all things he said now you grew from your birth when you was born and presented into this world God knew you were going to be here on this Earth he he growed from birth to Church hey I could things would come in my mind and I could see it as Vivid as day as I'm looking at you and then two three days later he'll come to pass now what happened with that I got old brother Matt but he says there's things that happen strange what was it that led me to go to the altar at a Louisiana campus full of hundreds of people what was it that what was that strange feeling that told me to be down there you would have thought I'd have been the last one there with the group I was with I was with a bunch of saints not really laughs I think we all made it down there before the night was over but something called on me something strange happened and called me to come down the front why was that because God knew he had a plan for me God knows he's got a plan for you sometimes he says we just don't understand understand these things but God is building a kingdom God is building a kingdom and his people in his bride and the bride is going to be in that Kingdom listen this and we're going to get ready to close he said the world had sin the penalty of sin was death he had to die that's why God was manifested in flesh so he could take death on him and pay the penalty there's nothing to come back it's not earmarked it's absolutely freely paid all the debt is paid it belongs to him and we are delegates of his kingdom so when Satan tells you you're not one of his that you'll only serve Satan that your life is wicked that you can't make it that you you'll never make a rapture you tell him say Satan you're a liar because God tells me that I'm a delegate of his kingdom and that I'm assembled right here tonight in the name of Jesus Christ sitting in Heavenly places God is building a kingdom let's stand to our feet musicians would come oh let's just bow our heads go before the Lord in prayer brother Josh if you prepare favorite songs and he sings it and and uh so if I asked him we get done praying he'll sing for us it's just bow our heads Heavenly Father we're just thankful Lord for this day we're thankful Lord to be part of a kingdom being built that we don't have to tread and trot and and be weighed down and bogged down into the pits of the clay that pharaoh and Satan would Place upon us with doubts and fear and anxieties and depressions and habits and battles that we have to face we don't have to be tied down and Shackled In bonds anymore but we're part of the kingdom of a greater Kingdom we're part of an eternal Kingdom we're part of a kingdom where you you call us Lord Jesus and there's a deep that's calling out to the deep and there's a place that you've gone to prepare for us and it'll be a place as we've never imagined before we read about it we sing songs about it we dream about it but it'll be a place where there'll be no more Sorrows No More Tears no more fears no more doubts no more worries it'll just be a Heavenly place a Heavenly Home a kingdom and Lord Jesus we come to realize that no matter what we go through in life no matter what challenges we face in life the obstacles the struggles Satan cannot do anything to us that is not allowed and then no matter what we go through in life no matter the the the the the worst of struggles the rivers that we've got to cross the Roaring rivers that we have to cross Lord we realize that because of you because of the Holy Spirit the holy
