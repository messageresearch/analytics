[1:01:09] pray you bless the ears of the hearer in
[1:01:11] Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles
[1:01:14] you can turn to Joshua
[1:01:23] 24 amen I as we got here last week we
[1:01:26] were here on Saturday night my son and I
[1:01:29] made it into town and obviously we
[1:01:31] understand we had some snow come in and
[1:01:32] some sleep come in that night and we
[1:01:34] couldn't have church Sunday morning but
[1:01:36] during the night I was awoken at 3:00 in
[1:01:39] the morning with a dream and the that
[1:01:42] dream is the inspiration for this
[1:01:44] message this morning so I want to preach
[1:01:46] to you a thought on I choose to live so
[1:01:50] there's not one of us here whether we're
[1:01:52] a young person whether we're an old
[1:01:54] person whether we have lived the life of
[1:01:56] sin whether we've come out of
[1:01:58] denominations whether we cut our teeth
[1:02:00] on a Pew we must choose this day so
[1:02:05] we're going to look here in Joshua 24
[1:02:07] and this is a new year obviously we're
[1:02:09] in 2025 and I know this is not my home
[1:02:12] Church brother Thomas this is my second
[1:02:14] home
[1:02:15] Church uh this is my New Year's message
[1:02:18] to evening light Tabernacle Tabernacle
[1:02:21] Elton Kentucky and so I want to look
[1:02:24] here and as I said I believe the lord
[1:02:26] gave me this dream and I will share the
[1:02:28] dream later during the service with you
[1:02:30] I'm not going to be pushed for time I'm
[1:02:32] the one that's got to drive nine hours
[1:02:33] home you don't so uh I just want to
[1:02:36] deliver my heart this morning because I
[1:02:38] believe God inspired it but we find here
[1:02:40] in Joshua 24 and verse
[1:02:42] 14 now therefore fear the lord and serve
[1:02:46] him in sincerity and in truth and put
[1:02:49] away the gods which your father served
[1:02:51] on the other side of the flood and in
[1:02:53] Egypt and serve ye the Lord and if it
[1:02:56] seem evil unto you to serve the Lord
[1:02:58] then choose you this day whom you will
[1:03:00] serve whether the gods which your
[1:03:02] fathers served that were on the other
[1:03:04] side of the flood are the gods of the
[1:03:06] amorites in whose land you dwell but as
[1:03:08] for me and my house we will serve the
[1:03:13] Lord I wonder if we can make that
[1:03:17] declaration you know we get so caught up
[1:03:19] in all the events going on that this
[1:03:21] church is bigger and this church is
[1:03:23] doing this and this church is doing that
[1:03:25] and or this family's got this and this
[1:03:27] family drove up in a new car and this
[1:03:29] one's got this and everything's going
[1:03:31] here we're looking everywhere else but I
[1:03:33] wonder this morning can we make that
[1:03:36] declaration for me and for my house quit
[1:03:40] looking at your neighbor's house quit
[1:03:42] looking at the house of the church
[1:03:43] member down the road or the next state
[1:03:46] over but for me and for my
[1:03:49] house we will serve the Lord amen I love
[1:03:55] how he said that and the people answered
[1:03:57] and and said unto him excuse me let me
[1:03:58] go back he says if it seem good for you
[1:04:01] to serve the Lord choose you this day
[1:04:03] whom he'll serve whether the gods which
[1:04:04] your father served that were on the
[1:04:06] other side of the flood are the god of
[1:04:07] the amorites in whose land you now dwell
[1:04:10] but it's for me and my house we will
[1:04:11] serve the Lord and the people answered
[1:04:14] and said God forbid that we should
[1:04:17] forsake the Lord to serve other
[1:04:19] gods for the Lord Our God he it is that
[1:04:23] brought us out of our fathers out of the
[1:04:25] land of be Egypt from the house of
[1:04:26] bondage and which did those great signs
[1:04:29] in our sight and preserved Us in all the
[1:04:31] way wherein we went among all the people
[1:04:33] through whom we passed and the Lord
[1:04:35] drave out from before us all the people
[1:04:37] even the amorites which dwelt in the
[1:04:39] land therefore we will also serve the
[1:04:42] Lord for he is our
[1:04:46] god let's keep going and Joshua said
[1:04:48] unto the people you cannot serve the
[1:04:50] Lord for he is a holy God he is a
[1:04:53] jealous God he will not forgive your
[1:04:57] transgressions nor your sins if you
[1:04:59] forsake the Lord now clue in here Church
[1:05:03] we're making a declaration this morning
[1:05:05] we're going to serve the Lord but if
[1:05:07] notice if you forsake the Lord and serve
[1:05:10] strange Gods then he will turn and do
[1:05:13] you hurt and consume you after that he
[1:05:16] had done good to you and the people said
[1:05:18] unto Joshua nay but we will serve the
[1:05:21] Lord and Joshua said unto the people you
[1:05:25] are with witness against yourselves that
[1:05:27] you have chosen you that you have that
[1:05:30] ye have chosen you the Lord to serve him
[1:05:33] and they said we Are
[1:05:35] Witnesses now therefore put away said he
[1:05:37] the strange Gods which are among you and
[1:05:40] incline your heart unto the Lord God of
[1:05:42] Israel and the people said unto Joshua
[1:05:45] the Lord Our God we will serve and his
[1:05:47] voice we will obey so Joshua made a
[1:05:49] covenant with the people that day and he
[1:05:51] s them a statute and an ordinance in
[1:05:53] shikim and Joshua wrote these words in
[1:05:56] the book of The Law of God and took a
[1:05:57] great Stone which is a revelation and he
[1:06:00] set it upon there and under an oak that
[1:06:03] was by the sanctuary of the Lord and
[1:06:04] Joshua said unto the people behold this
[1:06:08] Stone this
[1:06:11] Stone come on church this this Stone
[1:06:15] today not Wednesday night coming up not
[1:06:18] next Sunday but today this Stone shall
[1:06:21] be a witness unto you for it is for it
[1:06:24] ha heard all the words of the Lord which
[1:06:26] spake unto us and it shall therefore a
[1:06:29] witness unto you lest you deny your God
[1:06:32] so Joshua let the people depart every
[1:06:35] man into his inheritance God bless you
[1:06:38] you can have your seats this evening or
[1:06:39] this
[1:06:42] morning so we want to kind of take this
[1:06:44] thought like I said I'm just going to
[1:06:46] take my time I will start my timer and
[1:06:47] if I'm over time you just have to
[1:06:49] forgive me it may be a few months weeks
[1:06:51] before I get back so I'll just use some
[1:06:53] time from that point but I just just
[1:06:55] want to look at this as maybe a New
[1:06:57] Year's message I know I'm not a part of
[1:06:59] your ministry team here I'm definitely
[1:07:00] not your pastor but as a minister of the
[1:07:03] gospel and God wakes you up at 3:00 in
[1:07:05] the morning and gives you a dream that's
[1:07:06] so vivid and I say Lord please don't let
[1:07:09] me forget this dream and so I woke up
[1:07:11] the next morning I begin to just
[1:07:13] meditate on it and meditate on it
[1:07:15] meditate on it and I will share it a
[1:07:17] little bit later but so I just think
[1:07:19] back here and we see Joshua if we go
[1:07:21] back to verse or chapter 23 and verse
[1:07:24] one
[1:07:26] Joshua charges he gives a charge to the
[1:07:29] leaders of Israel and I believe today I
[1:07:32] can give a charge because I'm under that
[1:07:34] same headship of Christ a charge to the
[1:07:36] leaders of every household and even like
[1:07:41] Tabernacle in Joshua here in in Joshua
[1:07:43] 23 and verse1 it said it came to pass a
[1:07:46] long time after that that the Lord had
[1:07:48] given rest unto Israel from all their
[1:07:51] enemies round about that Joshua waxs old
[1:07:53] and was stricken in age now notice
[1:07:55] Joshua begins to reflect on his past he
[1:08:00] G begins to reflect in his old
[1:08:03] age maybe he's given his new year's
[1:08:06] message and he looks back of where the
[1:08:09] people of Israel have come from or maybe
[1:08:13] where the church has come from they come
[1:08:16] from a church a little small country
[1:08:19] white church that had a you know a a
[1:08:21] little pot belly heater on the inside
[1:08:23] and and maybe had some out house
[1:08:25] restrooms and oh we come a long way
[1:08:28] since then and he's reflecting back and
[1:08:31] he's sh oh we we've come so far we've
[1:08:34] we've been through great valleys we've
[1:08:36] gone through splits we we've gone
[1:08:38] through hurs we've gone through
[1:08:39] mountaintops we come a long way and and
[1:08:42] he's looking back but he calls all the
[1:08:44] leaders of Israel come here because
[1:08:47] Joshua knows he's about to cross over
[1:08:49] and being a an eternal land and he's
[1:08:52] calling everybody to encourage them
[1:08:55] notice Joshua didn't called him together
[1:08:58] to to to beat them over the head he
[1:09:00] didn't called them together to be
[1:09:02] destructive and the criticize and point
[1:09:04] out their flaws point out their
[1:09:06] weaknesses but Joshua called the leaders
[1:09:09] together to encourage them to choose you
[1:09:12] this
[1:09:15] day and it comes down personal Church to
[1:09:18] every one of us here this
[1:09:20] morning choose you this day
[1:09:26] let's keep reading here and is Joshua
[1:09:28] called for all of
[1:09:30] Israel and for the elders and for their
[1:09:32] heads so Mom Dad you're not escaping the
[1:09:36] service
[1:09:37] today dad you have a holy responsibility
[1:09:42] to your
[1:09:45] family I'm talking about a holy
[1:09:49] responsibility and if there's mothers
[1:09:51] here who are single moms and you have
[1:09:53] children you bear that same
[1:09:56] responsibility to your
[1:09:58] children this is something we may not be
[1:10:01] able to change everything but we can
[1:10:03] impact the lives of those that God has
[1:10:05] entrusted in our
[1:10:08] care he called the elders and all the
[1:10:11] heads and for their judges and for the
[1:10:13] officers and they said unto them I am
[1:10:15] old and I'm stricken in age otherwise
[1:10:18] brother B I'm not going to be here much
[1:10:21] longer but I'm giving you my farewell
[1:10:24] message I'm giving you my New Year's
[1:10:27] message and you have seen all that the
[1:10:30] Lord your God had done unto all the
[1:10:32] nations because of you look this is
[1:10:35] beautiful and I want you as a message
[1:10:38] believing people if we go back and we've
[1:10:40] heard the the sermons from 47 to 65 and
[1:10:44] some of you may have witnessed brother
[1:10:46] brandom's meetings and you may have seen
[1:10:48] the display of the supernatural but even
[1:10:50] aside from Brother Brandon's personal
[1:10:52] Ministry look at what God has done in
[1:10:55] the ministry of the Bride from that
[1:10:58] point because they received the same
[1:11:00] word the same
[1:11:05] Revelation now Joshua's going back and
[1:11:08] he's beginning to tell him of all that
[1:11:10] the Lord has
[1:11:12] done oh that's just beautiful he begins
[1:11:15] to remind them of the great battles they
[1:11:18] won brother
[1:11:20] Thomas the great victories brother
[1:11:22] Thomas that God had wrought for them and
[1:11:25] he secured for them and for the people
[1:11:28] of
[1:11:30] God and he tells them you have seen
[1:11:35] it you have witnessed all that the Lord
[1:11:38] had
[1:11:41] done and he says your God is he that had
[1:11:44] fought for you and but he says now in
[1:11:46] verse four Joshua 23 and verse4 behold I
[1:11:50] have divided unto you bot these nations
[1:11:53] that remain to be be an inheritance for
[1:11:56] your tribes from Jordan and with the
[1:11:59] Nations that I have cut off even unto
[1:12:02] the great seed Westward and the Lord
[1:12:04] your God he shall expel them from before
[1:12:07] you and drive them out of your sight and
[1:12:10] you shall possess their land as the Lord
[1:12:14] your God has promised you now there's
[1:12:17] some of you sitting here this morning
[1:12:18] that is yet to possess that PO portion
[1:12:21] of
[1:12:23] land but God has promised it for
[1:12:27] you God has promised it for you fathers
[1:12:30] for you mothers for you children the
[1:12:32] Bible says as many as the Lord Our God
[1:12:37] shall
[1:12:39] call let me tell you if I was a parent
[1:12:42] here this morning a father and a mother
[1:12:45] and I had children that just doesn't
[1:12:47] really seem like they want to get behind
[1:12:49] the movement of God and they just come
[1:12:51] and they just sit down and you know
[1:12:53] instead of criticize and get on your
[1:12:55] knees in your prayer closet get on your
[1:12:58] knees and seek God and say God go oh God

[1:13:16] criticize them for doing his criticize
[1:13:18] them from doing act all your criticizing
[1:13:21] does is push them out of the house of
[1:13:23] God and out of your house but but you

[1:15:18] don't you walk out defeated but claim

[1:15:24] morning yes
[1:15:28] notice in verse five and the Lord your
[1:15:30] God he shall expel woo right there kick
[1:15:34] him out of the house kick him out of the
[1:15:36] church not the people the
[1:15:40] spirits the Lord your God he shall expel
[1:15:43] them before you and drive them out of
[1:15:45] your
[1:15:46] sight and ye shall possess their
[1:15:52] land notice in verse six he says but be
[1:15:55] you therefore very
[1:15:57] courageous to keep and to
[1:16:02] do I'm taking my time personally this
[1:16:06] morning to keep and to
[1:16:10] do not just merely
[1:16:15] believing but to keep that means to
[1:16:19] store in your heart to keep it there to
[1:16:23] meditate on it and to do that means to
[1:16:27] act that means you got to put your faith
[1:16:30] your beleving in action and if it never
[1:16:32] comes into action then you don't really
[1:16:36] believe but to keep and to do that is
[1:16:39] written in the book of the law of Moses
[1:16:42] that you turn not aside there from to
[1:16:45] the right hand or to the left hand now I
[1:16:52] touched on some things Wednesday night
[1:16:53] and I'm going to touch on them again
[1:16:55] this morning and I got a purpose behind
[1:16:58] it so we find here in Joshua 7 that he
[1:17:02] says that you come not among these
[1:17:05] nations these that remain among you
[1:17:07] neither make mention of the name of
[1:17:10] their
[1:17:12] gods nor cause to swear by them
[1:17:16] otherwise don't take an oath by their
[1:17:18] gods neither serve them nor bow
[1:17:22] yourselves unto them now I spoke just a
[1:17:26] little bit Wednesday night on when God
[1:17:28] calls a man he calls for a total
[1:17:33] separation so we're going to look at
[1:17:35] this again because I've been studying
[1:17:37] all week preparing because I know God
[1:17:39] gave me this
[1:17:41] thought and I believe if God give a man
[1:17:44] woke him up at 3:00 in the morning a
[1:17:45] week knowing I wasn't even supposed to
[1:17:47] be here this Sunday I was supposed to be
[1:17:49] in complete another church but I believe
[1:17:51] God kept me here for one one person that
[1:17:55] can receive this word that'll make that
[1:17:57] declaration this morning I choose to
[1:18:04] live so we look here now he says but
[1:18:07] cleave unto the Lord your God as you
[1:18:09] have done unto this day for the Lord has
[1:18:11] driven out from before you great Nations
[1:18:14] and strong notice he's given you many
[1:18:16] great battles and he's given you a lot
[1:18:18] of great
[1:18:19] victories but as for you no man has been
[1:18:22] able to stand before you m
[1:18:25] so not only is is Joshua showing how
[1:18:29] great God is but he's even showing how
[1:18:32] great you are as a people that will
[1:18:35] follow God that would trust God that
[1:18:38] would stay in obedience with the word of
[1:18:41] God that will do what totally separate
[1:18:44] yourself from
[1:18:48] unbelief he says oh man he says one man
[1:18:51] you shall chase a thousand for the Lord
[1:18:53] your God he it is that fight us for you
[1:18:56] as he ha promised you take good heed
[1:18:58] therefore unto yourselves that you love
[1:19:01] the Lord your
[1:19:05] God that's good that you love the Lord
[1:19:09] your God not the Lord in the world not
[1:19:11] the Lord in your video game not the Lord
[1:19:13] in your makeup not the Lord in your
[1:19:15] fashion but the Lord hallelujah the Lord
[1:19:18] your God
[1:19:24] brother Brown makes a statement he said
[1:19:26] God called Abraham him being 75 years
[1:19:30] old and he said separate yourself from
[1:19:33] your Kindred now young person it's not
[1:19:35] just God dealing with you there's some
[1:19:38] 75 year old that's been sitting on the
[1:19:41] bench a long time oh they ain't made one
[1:19:44] move but God is calling you for a total
[1:19:48] separation he goes separate yourself
[1:19:51] from your Kindred you know when when God
[1:19:54] called me brother Brad I left all that I
[1:19:57] had over Mississippi I left all my
[1:19:59] friends I left my family behind I didn't
[1:20:02] know one person well I take that back I
[1:20:04] had an aunt and uncle in Louisiana and I
[1:20:06] I left everything and I moved in with
[1:20:08] them for a few months and before I got
[1:20:10] my own place but I left it all because
[1:20:12] when God calls a man it's time that you
[1:20:15] separate from your unbelieving
[1:20:17] Associates you can't hang on and I'm
[1:20:20] just going to be their friend let me
[1:20:22] tell you I'm just going to go down to
[1:20:24] the bar and I'm going to witness to them
[1:20:26] no God is calling for a total
[1:20:29] separation you got to separate yourself
[1:20:32] and be yolked up with the Holy Ghost and
[1:20:35] receive that anointing and receive that
[1:20:37] life before you can dare be a true
[1:20:40] witness of this
[1:20:44] message but notice what brother bam says
[1:20:46] he goes it's strange how we change that
[1:20:49] today God called for separation but we
[1:20:53] call for mixers
[1:20:58] oh we like those cool
[1:21:00] preachers they just you know he he gets
[1:21:02] me you know he just gets in there and
[1:21:05] you know he don't really preach real
[1:21:07] hard he's a lot of faith and da d d and
[1:21:09] I'm not saying anything negative about
[1:21:11] that but you know we don't hear that
[1:21:13] closed we don't want that closed line
[1:21:15] religion we don't want that heavy stuff
[1:21:18] we want you know what if if if if the
[1:21:20] preachers would just stay down here on
[1:21:21] this light upu and just tell us what we
[1:21:23] want to hear you know that's what we
[1:21:26] want you don't think your Prophet dealt
[1:21:29] with that notice what he say he say the
[1:21:32] people when you're choosing their Pastor
[1:21:34] you do that so he says they want a
[1:21:36] little slick fella you know that that
[1:21:38] take a social drink and he won't condemn
[1:21:41] smoke and a few other things a good guy
[1:21:43] that'll mix with the crowd let me tell
[1:21:45] you I'm not mixing with nobody's
[1:21:47] personality I'm not mixing I'm not
[1:21:50] compromising I'm staying with the word
[1:21:53] I'm staying with the message say I came
[1:21:55] out 255 years ago and I dare to go back
[1:21:58] to that lifestyle I dare to go back for
[1:22:01] me and for my house for me and for my
[1:22:04] family we're going to serve God we're
[1:22:06] going to live for God we choose to live
[1:22:08] this
[1:22:09] [Applause]
[1:22:11] morning why
[1:22:15] compromise why do you want a mixer we
[1:22:17] all want a
[1:22:18] mixer you want to make sure you're in
[1:22:20] the wrong
[1:22:21] Church you're in to make you want to
[1:22:23] make sure you got the wrong wrong God
[1:22:25] this
[1:22:28] morning God
[1:22:30] calls for a total separation from the
[1:22:34] things of the
[1:22:35] world oh here we go again you're going
[1:22:38] to beat us up
[1:22:43] again notice the Bible says be ye
[1:22:47] separate it doesn't say mix together oh
[1:22:51] maybe you can you know if you just kind
[1:22:52] of compromise here and there maybe
[1:22:53] you'll win
[1:22:55] everybody no be ye separate sayth the
[1:22:59] Lord and I will receive
[1:23:02] you see we want mixers God wants
[1:23:06] separators not a mixer a separator the
[1:23:08] Holy Ghost spoke separate me Paul and
[1:23:10] bartimus to the work see a separation
[1:23:13] God segregates his people that's from
[1:23:17] right and from
[1:23:20] wrong see Abraham was to separate
[1:23:23] himself in the sojourn and us Strange
[1:23:24] Land that he knew not of isn't that a
[1:23:27] beautiful picture
[1:23:29] today when God by election called you to
[1:23:33] to his beloved then immediately God
[1:23:36] speaks to you to separate yourself from
[1:23:38] the old crowd the pool room the Stitch
[1:23:41] and sew parties where they tell jokes
[1:23:43] and carry on a separation
[1:23:55] brother M says now I'm possessing all
[1:23:57] things 1962 he said Abraham had it kind
[1:24:00] of rough you say yeah I believe you know
[1:24:03] I I I can I can com I mean I can
[1:24:06] understand what Abraham went through no
[1:24:08] you cannot there ain't a one of us here
[1:24:10] this morning has had it rough you're
[1:24:13] blessed very blessed of the
[1:24:17] Lord he said there was lot having an
[1:24:20] easy waiting and
[1:24:22] waiting just waiting and sin how easy it
[1:24:26] is and how pleasing sin looks to be how
[1:24:29] innocent it looks to be now if lot says
[1:24:32] this notice what he says as long as I
[1:24:35] believe I believe in God so why can't I
[1:24:38] go down here in Sodom it'll be all right
[1:24:43] see the mentality of a
[1:24:45] lot well I
[1:24:48] believe but notice when God called
[1:24:51] Abraham he called him to separate
[1:24:53] himself from every
[1:24:55] thing and that's what we have to do
[1:24:58] that's what your Prophet saying that's
[1:24:59] what we have to do God calls us to a
[1:25:01] total separation from sin come out from
[1:25:03] among it be not partakers of it shun it
[1:25:06] the very appearance of evil separation
[1:25:08] completely annihilated from it stay your
[1:25:12] distance away from it don't tread upon
[1:25:14] its grounds no matter how nice it
[1:25:19] looks so we find many
[1:25:21] today brother Thomas they have theot
[1:25:25] mentality well brother Joe I believe God
[1:25:28] sent a
[1:25:29] prophet mean my mom and dad they play
[1:25:32] tapes all my
[1:25:34] life I believe brother brandom's
[1:25:36] Vindicated I believe he's a prophet of
[1:25:39] God and yet they still live in
[1:25:45] sin they still as we would say have one
[1:25:48] foot in the world and one foot in
[1:25:52] church so I asked ask you you that have
[1:25:56] that foot in the world and that foot in
[1:25:59] church church has got to be more than
[1:26:01] appeasing our religious
[1:26:06] conscience it's more than our religious
[1:26:10] responsibilities and our religious
[1:26:14] duties and we find that there's a lot of
[1:26:18] a lot of Christians are believers today
[1:26:21] that you know what just as long as I
[1:26:23] believe God in Prophet I'm
[1:26:25] okay and you see the world and the
[1:26:28] influence all over
[1:26:30] them I've been to
[1:26:32] churches and I'm not condemning please
[1:26:35] don't take it as that this morning but
[1:26:37] I'm just pouring my heart out I've been
[1:26:38] to churches and I preached to bobbed
[1:26:41] hair makeup I mean painted up Jezebel's
[1:26:44] in a message church with their hands
[1:26:47] raised worshiping God in all sincerity
[1:26:50] that they know just because they believe
[1:26:52] God sent a prophet
[1:26:57] and got the entire look of the world on
[1:27:00] their
[1:27:04] life the Bible says in 1 John we're
[1:27:06] going to go down this road just for a
[1:27:08] minute the Bible says in 1 John 2 and
[1:27:09] verse 15
[1:27:12] love oh oh there we go now you gonna get
[1:27:14] something nice we're gonna talk about
[1:27:16] the love no you just buckle
[1:27:18] up the Bible says love not the world
[1:27:25] all the young people just de they just
[1:27:26] quit on me I see it look at him they're
[1:27:29] like oh here he goes we get this at
[1:27:30] every camp
[1:27:32] meeting so why do you get
[1:27:36] it because we love
[1:27:40] you we sincerely want to see
[1:27:43] you see you with a desire see your heart
[1:27:47] overwhelmed to serve God we don't want
[1:27:50] to see you complacent we don't want to
[1:27:52] see you content in the
[1:27:55] world we want to see you take that foot
[1:27:58] out of the world and put it on the word
[1:28:01] and stand on the things of God to make a
[1:28:03] declaration I may be a young person this
[1:28:06] morning but I choose to live I choose to
[1:28:09] serve God I choose to follow God that's
[1:28:13] what our desire should be we're not here
[1:28:16] to beat you over the head and condemn
[1:28:18] you no we're here to take your hand and
[1:28:21] to lift you out of the things of the
[1:28:23] world and bring bring you to the promise
[1:28:25] of the
[1:28:27] [Applause]
[1:28:30] word says love not the world neither the
[1:28:33] things that are in the
[1:28:37] world if any man love the world then the
[1:28:40] love of the father is not in him for all
[1:28:44] that is in the
[1:28:45] world the lust of the Flesh and the lust
[1:28:48] of the eyes and the pride of life is not
[1:28:50] of the father but is of the world and
[1:28:53] the world passes away and the lust
[1:28:56] thereof but he that doeth the will of
[1:28:59] God abideth
[1:29:01] forever so I want to break this word
[1:29:04] some of these words down for you this
[1:29:06] morning we think about lust and the
[1:29:09] Bible talks about the lust of the Flesh
[1:29:12] and the lust of the eyes now initially
[1:29:15] when you hear lust you think you got a
[1:29:17] sexual
[1:29:20] problem no that's because a lot of times
[1:29:22] that's that that's kind of How It's
[1:29:24] portrayed but notice this word lust
[1:29:26] means desire craving longing desire for
[1:29:31] what is
[1:29:34] forbidden desire for that which is
[1:29:37] forbidden notice but and we think about
[1:29:40] you can have a lust for
[1:29:42] money till you'll treat your neighbor
[1:29:44] wrong just to get the upper hand you
[1:29:46] have a Lust For position you don't
[1:29:48] matter who you step on just so you can
[1:29:50] climb that ladder of success you can
[1:29:52] have a Lust For
[1:29:55] power and you can see Powers Collide
[1:29:58] even in a church when there's some
[1:30:00] deacons that want to take control of the
[1:30:02] ministry and that nickan Spirit we
[1:30:05] finally they reverse niotis to where
[1:30:07] they feel like they have a say you can
[1:30:09] have a lust for power a lust for
[1:30:11] vengeance you can have a lust for
[1:30:15] beauty some of you young girls you have
[1:30:18] a lust for beauty because you don't feel
[1:30:20] secure in how God Made You and then you
[1:30:24] see the vog magazines and you see the
[1:30:27] you know the the influencers all over
[1:30:29] the social media God ain't calling you
[1:30:32] to
[1:30:33] that God's calling you to a holy
[1:30:38] life but we can have a lust for beauty
[1:30:41] and a lust for an
[1:30:44] acceptance a desire to be accepted in
[1:30:47] the wrong
[1:30:48] groups with the wrong
[1:30:51] people so you say brother Joe I don't
[1:30:55] love the world now let me just get you
[1:30:57] straight I don't love the
[1:31:00] world all right well let's just look at
[1:31:03] it and see you search your
[1:31:06] heart so when we look at verse
[1:31:09] 15 there's two forms of the word love in
[1:31:13] this one
[1:31:14] verse the Bible says the first form is
[1:31:18] agapo it's to welcome to entertain to be
[1:31:21] fond of to love dearly to be be well
[1:31:24] pleased to be contented at or with a
[1:31:27] thing to Delight
[1:31:30] in all right so you got that
[1:31:33] definition the next form of the word
[1:31:36] love that is used and it's used toward
[1:31:39] God or the Father's Love toward us the
[1:31:42] second is agape and that is affection or
[1:31:46] benevolence so when we read this let's
[1:31:49] reread this scripture here and kind of
[1:31:52] see how it says in 1 John
[1:31:54] 2 and verse 15 if you love or
[1:31:57] entertain the world or he's saying love
[1:32:01] not or entertain not the world neither
[1:32:04] the things that are in the world if any
[1:32:06] man love or is fond of or pleased with
[1:32:09] or contented with the world then the
[1:32:11] love or the benevolence the affection of
[1:32:14] the father is not in
[1:32:18] him if you're
[1:32:21] contented with the world if you're
[1:32:23] please if your appetite is filled up
[1:32:27] with the things of the
[1:32:28] world you gulp down movies and you gulp
[1:32:31] down you know secular uh radios and and
[1:32:35] mo uh uh songs and different things like
[1:32:37] that if you're feeding on other things
[1:32:40] then it shows you that there is a love a
[1:32:43] desire a contentment with what the world
[1:32:46] can offer
[1:32:48] you and he says and when that is the
[1:32:50] case then the love the benevolence the
[1:32:53] affection of the father is not in your
[1:32:57] heart so when we read it like this we
[1:33:00] can see that God is calling for a total
[1:33:04] separation God is calling for you to be
[1:33:08] different do you understand young people
[1:33:11] that fashion you know a lot of times we
[1:33:12] want to be fashionable and let me just
[1:33:14] let's just agree M Believers we're a
[1:33:16] little bit behind the curve on
[1:33:18] fashion it's okay we're not at the
[1:33:21] height of fashion we may be year two
[1:33:24] three years but as we find that the Next
[1:33:27] Generation and is socially connected
[1:33:30] with social media and things like that
[1:33:32] then we're not so far behind the curve
[1:33:34] as we used to
[1:33:37] be but you know just last month I went
[1:33:40] to Hollywood California I was out there
[1:33:42] preaching to an Hispanic group of people
[1:33:44] and we went to Hollywood and we walked
[1:33:46] down the the Hollywood Boulevard and the
[1:33:49] stars the the stars of fame or the Walk
[1:33:51] of Fame and let me just tell you it
[1:33:53] ain't all is cracked up to be it is
[1:33:56] filthy homeless
[1:33:59] everywhere marijuana drugs on the street
[1:34:02] needles on the street bums on the Street
[1:34:05] Homeless on the street it's not a safe
[1:34:09] place to go and yet Hollywood is the one
[1:34:13] that is putting out the fashion and the
[1:34:15] trends that many of our young people are
[1:34:18] yoking their yourself up
[1:34:20] with it is the pit of Hell and you're
[1:34:24] telling me that you're
[1:34:26] satisfied with those
[1:34:28] things if you can only see the spirit
[1:34:32] behind it if you can only see the spirit
[1:34:35] behind some of the dress or the fashion
[1:34:38] some of the
[1:34:40] movements so I'm not trying like I said
[1:34:42] I'm not here to condemn you today I'm
[1:34:44] just want to encourage you look Beyond
[1:34:46] where is the influence coming from I was
[1:34:50] at a church one time and I preached on
[1:34:51] some bracelets and I preached on
[1:34:53] necklace says and and I had a brother
[1:34:55] come to me afterwards he says you got to
[1:34:57] show me that in the
[1:34:59] message I mean
[1:35:01] really I'm going to have to show you
[1:35:03] that in the message so I went and look
[1:35:05] it's not in the message and he probably
[1:35:07] like woo told
[1:35:09] you told you I can wear my necklace I'm
[1:35:12] like but here's the deal when brother
[1:35:15] brandham when he was asking question and
[1:35:17] answers by the
[1:35:18] Ladies by the
[1:35:21] ladies I say it again by the
[1:35:24] sisters can we wear jewelry he said it's
[1:35:28] okay to wear jewelry just don't look
[1:35:30] like you went through through a 10 cent
[1:35:32] store with a magnet on now that's the
[1:35:35] ladies trying to be right with God but
[1:35:38] yet you see the influence of the world
[1:35:40] bringing it right in and now it's a
[1:35:43] trend it's a fashion it has a spirit
[1:35:45] connected to it coming from somewhere
[1:35:48] and now we have young men all throughout
[1:35:50] the message we got preachers out there
[1:35:53] and they wearing bracelets and necklaces
[1:35:55] and all kinds I'm talking about where
[1:35:57] are we going to hold a
[1:35:59] standard now let me just say this I
[1:36:01] don't think it's Heaven or Hell at least
[1:36:03] I hope not but I'm asking you see the
[1:36:08] spirit behind the influence of
[1:36:11] it see the spirit behind the influence
[1:36:15] question and answers brother brandham
[1:36:16] 1964 he's asked that
[1:36:19] question and now we're 60s something
[1:36:22] years past or right at 60 years past
[1:36:24] that
[1:36:27] 61 how dare a brother ask brother can I
[1:36:30] wear this type he would probably say
[1:36:33] where you getting your
[1:36:37] influence if you
[1:36:39] love I'm trying to bring it back to
[1:36:41] scripture if you love if you entertain
[1:36:44] if you're contented with the
[1:36:48] Fashions the
[1:36:50] movements the
[1:36:52] movies all these things of the
[1:36:55] world then the love the affection the
[1:36:58] benevolence as a husband to his wife is
[1:37:01] not going to be
[1:37:03] there because God is a
[1:37:09] gentleman like I said I'm not here to
[1:37:11] condemn you I'm not here I'm here to
[1:37:13] encourage you I'm here to speak to you
[1:37:16] God is calling for a total
[1:37:20] separation why come this far why come so
[1:37:23] close and to let something so
[1:37:27] frivolous you say well brother Joe what
[1:37:29] if I can get in wearing my necklace or
[1:37:32] what if I can get in cutting my hair
[1:37:34] what if I can get in wearing my makeup
[1:37:36] what if you
[1:37:38] can't let's just make it personal what
[1:37:40] if you
[1:37:44] can't so why come this far so close look
[1:37:48] around and you see the times that we're
[1:37:50] living in even nominal Church system
[1:37:53] recognize we can't be here much longer
[1:37:56] why play
[1:37:57] church I'm trying to encourage you you
[1:38:00] got to make your declaration you can
[1:38:02] either serve the gods of your fathers
[1:38:05] that they served on the other side of
[1:38:07] the flood the gods of fashion the gods
[1:38:10] of Hollywood because your father and
[1:38:12] your mother they used to do all those
[1:38:14] things they used to look that way do
[1:38:15] that kind of stuff or you can serve this
[1:38:20] God the only true Liv Living
[1:38:25] God so when God calls brother said God
[1:38:28] has a provided way when he calls for a
[1:38:30] total separation from all things of the
[1:38:32] world Annihilation from worldly
[1:38:35] things so today some of you may not like
[1:38:39] that whole deal on jewelry especially
[1:38:40] some of you young boys if that's what
[1:38:42] you're doing and you may want to throw
[1:38:43] eggs at me right now and that's
[1:38:45] completely all right but I'm just
[1:38:46] telling you take it back to the message
[1:38:48] take it back to the
[1:38:50] message you know what if I hurt your
[1:38:51] feelings I'm sorry I'm taking it back to
[1:38:53] the word I'm not
[1:38:55] compromising my my son Joseph asked me
[1:38:57] when he was 8 years old though he played
[1:38:59] on a A Little League World Series ball
[1:39:01] team he was a you know Little League
[1:39:03] World Series kid and and all of them got
[1:39:05] these bracelets because they got to go
[1:39:06] to this certain tournament and we made
[1:39:08] the World Series and D I said buddy you
[1:39:10] can put that on your back but it ain't
[1:39:11] going on your
[1:39:13] wrist he wanted to be like the other boy
[1:39:16] and that's okay to be to be accepted but
[1:39:19] there's got to be a Joshua that says for
[1:39:21] me and for my family
[1:39:23] we're going to hold true to the
[1:39:25] standards of the word we're going to
[1:39:26] hold true it may not be uh Pleasant and
[1:39:30] he may have been a little bit rejected
[1:39:32] by it but you know what he's never
[1:39:33] questioned me not one time he's 19 years
[1:39:36] old I've not had one struggle with my
[1:39:38] son with a desire to do any of that cuz
[1:39:42] he was taught from a little boy that's
[1:39:44] not what we do we hold to the word of
[1:39:47] God well I don't see it black and white
[1:39:50] well see the spirit behind it see
[1:39:53] question behind it why people some of
[1:39:55] the question and answers seem to be so
[1:39:57] frivolous brother brandom can we wear
[1:39:59] our
[1:40:00] pajamas when we go to bed at night he
[1:40:02] goes I don't see why you would want to
[1:40:04] do that you're a lady just a nice slip
[1:40:07] or a gown would
[1:40:14] do I mean we could talk about the young
[1:40:16] people what about
[1:40:19] that they had sincere questions they
[1:40:21] sincerely wanted to be right right and
[1:40:24] he says I don't know why you would want
[1:40:25] to do that when a nice nice gown would
[1:40:29] do you know a house coat or whatever but
[1:40:33] we we have gotten so far removed and let
[1:40:36] me I don't want to get ahead of myself
[1:40:37] like I said I got all day today church
[1:40:38] so I'm just going to try to preach this
[1:40:40] and feel the leadership of the Lord but
[1:40:43] bear again please I'm encouraging you
[1:40:46] search your heart search your motive
[1:40:50] search your desires that's right because
[1:40:53] you can hide from your pastor you can
[1:40:55] hide from the the assistant ministry
[1:40:57] here brother Brad or any evangelist
[1:40:59] coming in hide from me but you're not
[1:41:01] going to hide from yourself and you're
[1:41:03] not going to hide from
[1:41:05] God the two of you know for sure exactly
[1:41:08] where your heart is
[1:41:14] lending notice here in Jehovah jahra
[1:41:17] total separation from all not just some
[1:41:21] not just school not just this not just
[1:41:24] that but all unbelief and remember
[1:41:26] Abraham the patriarch was never
[1:41:28] absolutely fully blessed until he obeyed
[1:41:31] exactly what God said to
[1:41:37] do and will never never be blessed any
[1:41:42] and have the blessings until we obey
[1:41:44] what God Said
[1:41:47] do
[1:41:49] we now he's taking it from 2,000 years
[1:41:52] ago or even beyond that and bringing it
[1:41:56] bringing it up to date we will never be
[1:41:59] fully blessed truly blessed until we do
[1:42:02] what God says do
[1:42:04] notice Abraham when he left Earth he
[1:42:07] didn't receive the Holy Ghost he didn't
[1:42:08] receive the promised land when he just
[1:42:10] left Earth well you know just coming out
[1:42:12] as one thing but God is Not only calling
[1:42:15] you out God is calling you
[1:42:17] in so we find Abraham had to fully obey
[1:42:22] he never received the promise just by
[1:42:24] leaving her he had to separate from his
[1:42:29] father that's right he had to separate
[1:42:32] from his nephew lot he had to separate
[1:42:35] from his family but notice what Abraham
[1:42:38] did Abraham chose lot chose Sodom he
[1:42:43] chose the world Abraham chose the barren
[1:42:46] lands the hard land it was the harder
[1:42:48] way but it was the precise way and God
[1:42:52] rewarded Abraham God blessed Abraham
[1:42:55] because Abraham separated himself he
[1:42:58] detached himself from family attribution
[1:43:01] generational curses and whatever it may
[1:43:03] be family influence he said no I'm going
[1:43:06] to follow the
[1:43:09] [Applause]
[1:43:13] Lord I'm going to follow the
[1:43:16] [Applause]
[1:43:21] lord that's exactly right and brother B
[1:43:23] makes a statement in the token message
[1:43:25] now we're all familiar with the token he
[1:43:27] says when you fully obey the word of God
[1:43:30] in full
[1:43:32] surrender young people clue in on that
[1:43:34] full surrender I mean there ain't no
[1:43:37] foot
[1:43:38] dangling in the world I saw your pastor
[1:43:42] I watched a clip of your pastor day he
[1:43:43] did this or something like that trying
[1:43:46] to sit on the desk so I know anything
[1:43:48] can go in here just as long as the
[1:43:50] spirit has this way so we ain't dangling
[1:43:53] are feet in the world but a full
[1:43:59] surrender that means you check your
[1:44:01] Revelation you check your experience by
[1:44:04] the word of God if it doesn't line up
[1:44:07] then you need to line up if it doesn't
[1:44:10] line up then you need to make a
[1:44:11] declaration today me and my family me
[1:44:14] and my house I am going to choose to
[1:44:17] serve the Lord I'm going to give God a
[1:44:20] full surrender a full obedience a Full
[1:44:23] Sacrifice I'm gonna serve God I'm gonna
[1:44:26] live for
[1:44:32] God now we live in a day brother Brad of
[1:44:35] an entitlement and Society right
[1:44:39] everybody feels
[1:44:40] entitled well I'm entitled to that Pew
[1:44:43] right there let me just tell you what
[1:44:46] you are entitled to by your prophet he
[1:44:48] says full obedience to the word and full
[1:44:51] surrender it entitles you to the Holy
[1:44:54] Ghost now you want to talk about
[1:44:56] entitlement mentality you fully
[1:44:58] surrendered to God fully surrendered to
[1:45:00] the word and full obedience to him and
[1:45:03] God will fill you with the Holy Ghost
[1:45:06] you won't have to question it you won't
[1:45:08] have to doubt it you won't have to go
[1:45:10] searching for it you won't have to fast
[1:45:12] about it God will fill you with the Holy
[1:45:16] Ghost but you must come under full
[1:45:19] obedience to the word
[1:45:24] he says yes sir obedience not he that
[1:45:26] saith Lord Lord but he that doeth the
[1:45:29] will full obedience to the full word of
[1:45:32] God entitles us to the Token no other
[1:45:35] way there is that you could ever be
[1:45:37] entitled to the Token until you fully
[1:45:40] obey the
[1:45:43] word you hear people today
[1:45:46] said you know I got the Holy
[1:45:50] Ghost and yet things pop up many years
[1:45:54] later things pop up out of their life
[1:45:57] they had the Holy Ghost because they
[1:45:58] came and they shouted I'm not saying
[1:46:01] that the Holy Ghost didn't make you
[1:46:02] shout but you don't shout to get it but
[1:46:05] once you get it you will shout some of
[1:46:08] them got emotional some of them ran I
[1:46:10] got the Holy Ghost I
[1:46:12] ran you know what I go look there's some
[1:46:15] track stars out there they run every
[1:46:16] other Saturday ain't none of them got
[1:46:18] the Holy Ghost but they CLA oh I did
[1:46:21] this and I don't say that you you didn't
[1:46:23] come under the the the Holy Ghost anoint
[1:46:25] your flesh to do these things but I'm
[1:46:27] not talking about the Holy Ghost on the
[1:46:29] flesh I'm not talking about the Holy
[1:46:31] Ghost on the outside I'm talking about
[1:46:33] the token life the literal life of Jesus
[1:46:36] Christ coming on the inside of you and
[1:46:39] full obedience to the message full
[1:46:41] obedience to the word of God entitles
[1:46:44] you then more to more than just to shout
[1:46:46] to More Than Just A Dance to more than
[1:46:48] just an emotion it entitles you to the
[1:46:51] very life of Jesus Christ no matter how
[1:46:54] rough it gets how low it gets you'll
[1:46:56] come out because why because it ain't
[1:46:58] your life it's his life living inside of
[1:47:01] you bringing you through it Lord give us
[1:47:04] the Holy Ghost give us more than just a
[1:47:06] sensation give us more than just an
[1:47:08] emotion but fill our every fi Lord with
[1:47:12] the baptism of the Holy
[1:47:18] Ghost what did John 3:5 Jesus tells them
[1:47:22] he said very verily I say unto you
[1:47:25] except a man be born of water and a
[1:47:27] spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of
[1:47:29] God that which is born of the flesh is
[1:47:32] fleshly that which is born of the spirit
[1:47:34] is Spirit Marvel not that I say unto
[1:47:37] thee that ye must be born
[1:47:41] again what does it mean to be born again
[1:47:45] it means to receive Jesus
[1:47:48] Christ in the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:47:52] the genuine brother man we call it that
[1:47:55] the true genuine baptism of the Holy
[1:48:01] Ghost so we find here in the token
[1:48:06] message brother BR says now when he said
[1:48:07] you must be born again that don't mean
[1:48:09] jump up and down at the
[1:48:11] altar because some of us mistake that we
[1:48:13] go to camp meetings I see young people I
[1:48:16] work with young people at the camp
[1:48:17] meetings you go and you see them have an
[1:48:19] emotional response but your month later
[1:48:21] two months later they're back down have
[1:48:23] to go to another camp meeting to come
[1:48:25] back
[1:48:26] up where's the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[1:48:29] is the keeper he's a stabilizer you get
[1:48:33] I'm not saying you're not going to have
[1:48:34] bad days but I'm telling you you're not
[1:48:35] going to have those kind of days you're
[1:48:37] not going to drop off in the slumps when
[1:48:39] you got the baptism of Holy Ghost
[1:48:41] because the Holy Ghost is keeping
[1:48:45] power he's a stabilizer brother B says
[1:48:48] what time he goes you know those great
[1:48:49] big ships they put stabilizers on the
[1:48:51] ships no matter what kind of ways they
[1:48:53] coming through it stabilizes the ship
[1:48:56] and he says and God has given us the
[1:48:57] stabilizer the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:49:00] no matter what kind of waters we come
[1:49:02] across we have a stabilizer it
[1:49:04] stabilizes us against the waves and he
[1:49:06] said they will no by any means overtake
[1:49:08] us but we will crest every one of them
[1:49:12] oh sister daughter we're going to come
[1:49:14] over cancer it ain't nothing God's given
[1:49:16] us a
[1:49:17] stabilizer a stabilizer no matter what
[1:49:20] cancer is it could be breast cancer it
[1:49:22] could be lymphoma it doesn't matter God
[1:49:25] is given a stabilizer in this day he's
[1:49:28] given us the means the baptism of the
[1:49:30] Holy Ghost to
[1:49:32] [Applause]
[1:49:39] overcome said it don't mean jump up and
[1:49:41] down at the altar that don't mean walk
[1:49:42] back there and shake hands with the
[1:49:44] pastor that don't mean all this
[1:49:46] foolishness that we've we've seen done
[1:49:48] it don't mean putting your name on a
[1:49:50] church book it means death to your first
[1:49:55] being if you get mad at me just want to
[1:49:57] get mad at your Prophet cuz I'm
[1:49:58] preaching what he
[1:50:00] said death to
[1:50:04] yourself means you got to put your pride
[1:50:06] aside you got to put your arrogance
[1:50:08] aside got to put your thoughts aside got
[1:50:10] to quit looking at the preacher with
[1:50:12] darts in your eyes and say okay help me
[1:50:15] line up this
[1:50:16] morning it means that the blood has been
[1:50:19] applied and you're identified by the
[1:50:21] life of Jesus and if he be the vine and
[1:50:24] we are the branches then the life that's
[1:50:27] in the branch must flow out through the
[1:50:29] or the life in the vine must flow out
[1:50:31] through the branches so the very same
[1:50:34] things he
[1:50:36] did we must do
[1:50:39] also we can't compromise
[1:50:42] church so Jesus's first Doctrine how
[1:50:45] many knows what it
[1:50:47] was y'all don't know I'll tell you you
[1:50:51] say Jesus's first doctr his first
[1:50:56] teaching it's so
[1:50:58] simple ye must be born
[1:51:02] again that was his first teaching and if
[1:51:06] he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:51:08] today and forever then it's still
[1:51:11] teaching
[1:51:12] today it still applies brother bad today
[1:51:16] Mom Dad young old we must be born again
[1:51:20] not born of a church not born of a
[1:51:23] theology not born of a Doctrine but born
[1:51:25] of the spirit of the Living
[1:51:29] God but you find today my my my my can I
[1:51:34] keep going please say
[1:51:37] yes you find today that many many
[1:51:42] many well let me back up you say brother
[1:51:44] Joe you kind of been strong on this
[1:51:47] statement you've been laboring pretty
[1:51:48] hard on this why are you laboring so
[1:51:50] hard on this thought God gave you a
[1:51:53] dream for our
[1:51:55] church God gave you something for the
[1:51:57] church yeah he did let me just share
[1:52:00] what he says here what was the Holy
[1:52:02] Ghost given for he goes to you people
[1:52:04] it's absolutely essential and necessary
[1:52:07] and compelling and compulsary that you
[1:52:10] receive the Holy Ghost
[1:52:12] now for if you don't you can't come in
[1:52:16] the
[1:52:18] resurrection you understand that church
[1:52:21] you understand that young people do you
[1:52:23] understand why it's compulsory it's
[1:52:25] necessary that you receive the Holy
[1:52:27] Ghost now not wait you're not promised
[1:52:30] the next camp meeting you're not
[1:52:31] promised another service but you are
[1:52:34] promised now then in another place he
[1:52:36] said Satan doesn't care how religious
[1:52:39] you
[1:52:40] are how right you are in your Doctrine
[1:52:43] if you missed that
[1:52:46] life if you miss the life of the Holy
[1:52:49] Ghost you won't come up anyhow
[1:52:53] no matter how religious how good how
[1:52:55] many churches you belong to or or will
[1:52:58] belong to it doesn't matter one thing
[1:53:00] unless you've been born again that's why
[1:53:03] I'm laboring about being born again
[1:53:05] that's why I'm challenging you look at
[1:53:08] your heart look at your
[1:53:10] desires don't just go through the
[1:53:12] motions don't just settle for a
[1:53:13] goosebump don't just settle for good
[1:53:15] service don't just settle for you know
[1:53:18] maybe a shout here or a shout there I
[1:53:20] talk about taking your experience with
[1:53:22] the word do I have the Holy
[1:53:26] Ghost and you and God

[1:53:39] Community second third fourth
[1:53:41] Generations now beginning to drift away
[1:53:45] from the principles of the message you
[1:53:48] find as the Next Generation goes if
[1:53:51] they're not taught right in if there's
[1:53:53] not the high priest of the home then
[1:53:54] you'll find that next Generation begin
[1:53:56] to drift and the things of God the
[1:53:59] preaching of the gospel and the message
[1:54:01] of the hour won't seem so so important
[1:54:04] to
[1:54:10] them man brother Joe you said you had a
[1:54:12] message it it's
[1:54:14] coming so we have people in our churches
[1:54:17] today we have young people in our church
[1:54:19] I have children they don't know what it
[1:54:21] means to be out in the World they don't
[1:54:24] know what it means to belong to a
[1:54:25] Baptist Church or a Pentecostal church
[1:54:27] or some other form of denomination they
[1:54:29] don't know we got we got Generations
[1:54:31] sitting right here in Elton Kentucky
[1:54:34] you've not known anything but this
[1:54:36] church you've not known anything but
[1:54:39] this message but yet you don't
[1:54:42] understand the reality of the prophet of
[1:54:45] the message why did God send you a
[1:54:47] prophet that turn your heart away from
[1:54:51] denominationalism away away from
[1:54:52] unbelief away from sin well brother Joe
[1:54:56] we don't sin we're not out there we we
[1:54:58] were right here in the church but yet
[1:55:00] your heart is so far from
[1:55:04] God he says in one place with their
[1:55:07] mouth they profess me but their hearts
[1:55:09] are far
[1:55:13] away and this is what Israel was
[1:55:16] doing they've been through great battles
[1:55:19] they've seen great victories they come
[1:55:20] through the flood they come out of Egypt
[1:55:23] they destroyed the walls of
[1:55:26] Jericho just by
[1:55:29] shouting
[1:55:31] woo just by
[1:55:35] shouting they come to a Cades barer they
[1:55:38] went around the mountain for 40 years
[1:55:41] but one day it's time to come Joshua
[1:55:45] take him in divide the land give them
[1:55:48] their
[1:55:49] inheritance God sent you a Joshua the
[1:55:51] Holy Ghost in this day to divide the
[1:55:55] promises to
[1:55:56] us and notice what Joshua was saying to
[1:56:00] them choose you this
[1:56:05] day who you're going to serve whether
[1:56:08] you're going to serve the god of the
[1:56:10] amorites whether you're going to serve
[1:56:12] the god of the
[1:56:14] Egyptians or whether you're going to
[1:56:16] serve the god that your fathers did on
[1:56:19] the other side of the flood that's not
[1:56:20] talking about Noah's flood that's about
[1:56:22] the great flood of the river of
[1:56:24] frees so he says you got a choice let me
[1:56:27] tell you somebody today young person or
[1:56:29] old you're going to serve
[1:56:32] something you're going to serve somebody
[1:56:35] something is going to be your God boys
[1:56:38] it could be your girlfriend you can make
[1:56:40] her your God husband it could be your
[1:56:42] wife or whatever it could be your car
[1:56:44] brother B says it's all kind of things
[1:56:46] that we make a God but God is Desiring
[1:56:49] your worship God is Desiring your
[1:56:51] praises this morning God is asking you
[1:56:54] as a church body who will you
[1:57:00] serve that's
[1:57:04] right we're fine today but many of our
[1:57:06] young people and we have it at evening
[1:57:09] light Tabernacle in M Louisiana the
[1:57:13] same we treat the message as a list of
[1:57:17] dos and don'ts well I don't wear makeup
[1:57:20] okay this is what we do this is our
[1:57:22] religion it's our covering I don't wear
[1:57:24] and I wear my hair long I wear skirts I
[1:57:26] don't dress
[1:57:28] inappropriate and we do all these things
[1:57:31] and it's a list and not
[1:57:36] love it's a
[1:57:38] list it's rules we follow versus
[1:57:42] obedience to the
[1:57:44] word and if you can ever twist your
[1:57:47] thinking or change your thinking to
[1:57:49] where it's no longer a list of dos and
[1:57:51] don'ts
[1:57:53] but you're in love with the
[1:57:57] author then you would understand why our
[1:58:00] Our Ladies don't wear or cut their hair
[1:58:03] why they don't wear makeup we understand
[1:58:06] why our boys don't look like the world
[1:58:08] cuz now it's a love that due
[1:58:12] benevolence that I spoke of
[1:58:14] earlier let's keep on going now but you
[1:58:18] find you're finding more in this day
[1:58:20] that we go people say the Lord Lord
[1:58:22] delays his
[1:58:24] coming I know nobody here has said
[1:58:28] that Matthew 24 and verse 46 says
[1:58:31] blessed is that servant whom his Lord
[1:58:33] when he cometh shall find so doing
[1:58:35] verily I say unto you that he shall make
[1:58:37] him ruler over all his Goods but he that
[1:58:41] but if that evil servant shall say in
[1:58:43] his heart my the Lord delayeth his
[1:58:45] coming he shall begin to Smite his
[1:58:48] fellow servants and to eat and drink
[1:58:51] with and be drunk
[1:58:52] Dr see you find those you know we have
[1:58:55] people they say it they may not say it
[1:58:57] in their mouth or with their mouth but
[1:58:58] they're saying it with their heart
[1:59:00] they're saying it with their
[1:59:02] attitude so we find as Joshua we go back
[1:59:06] here in Joshua 24 and verse one Joshua
[1:59:09] gathers all the tribes of
[1:59:11] Israel because he's trying to get them
[1:59:13] now if we're we're gonna start bringing
[1:59:14] this home I'm G I'm gonna have you out
[1:59:16] by 1:00 is that
[1:59:18] okay man that was a weak
[1:59:21] amen I figur the young people be
[1:59:22] shouting right about now yeah hurry up
[1:59:26] man but notice here Joshua gathers all
[1:59:30] the tribe of Israel at shikim and he
[1:59:32] called the elders and the heads and the
[1:59:34] judges and officers and he presents and
[1:59:36] he begins to tell them you got a choice
[1:59:39] that lays before you
[1:59:41] today he didn't deny that you're going
[1:59:44] to serve
[1:59:46] something but he's telling you got to
[1:59:48] make a choice whom you're going to
[1:59:51] serve see notice Abraham's father Tara
[1:59:54] if y'all know much about Tara I'll did
[1:59:56] some research on this he wasn't just an
[1:59:58] average citizen he was a military
[2:00:01] General under
[2:00:03] Nimrod also tradition relates that
[2:00:06] Tara's son Abraham was born nimrod's
[2:00:09] astrologers warned that this child will
[2:00:11] one day conquer the land and fearful of
[2:00:13] nimrod's Wrath Tara hid Abraham his
[2:00:16] mother and the wet nurse in a cave for
[2:00:18] 10
[2:00:19] years Terror was deeply involved in idol
[2:00:22] worship even running a shop that sold
[2:00:25] idols and history has it Legend has it
[2:00:29] that Tera let Abraham he had to oversee
[2:00:32] the shop one day and Abraham got all the
[2:00:35] little gods and he he put the big God
[2:00:37] right in the middle and he put all the
[2:00:39] other little Gods all around the big God
[2:00:42] and he smashed all the little gods and
[2:00:44] when Tara came back and he said Abraham
[2:00:47] why' you do this he said you know he
[2:00:49] said he said I didn't do it the god in
[2:00:52] the middle did it the big God did it and
[2:00:54] ter said you know that that's not a God
[2:00:56] you know that's just something that we
[2:00:57] sell he says that's exactly right it's
[2:01:00] not a God so why do you want to sell it
[2:01:03] to the people as if it is a God and
[2:01:05] that's what I'm trying to tell you this
[2:01:07] morning these things that I'm talking
[2:01:08] about they're just little bitty make
[2:01:10] belief God but there's only one true
[2:01:13] Living God and he's the one that's
[2:01:15] worthy to be praised he's the one that's
[2:01:18] worthy to be served this morning don't
[2:01:20] give your affection to some false god
[2:01:23] some Idol give it to almighty God
[2:01:25] worship and serve the Living
[2:01:31] God Tara was an astrologer he practiced
[2:01:35] astrology saw the Stars he knew that his
[2:01:37] son Haron would die by fire but that his
[2:01:41] descendant would fill the land now
[2:01:42] notice Abraham married Heron's daughter
[2:01:47] Sarah and he had a dream he was an
[2:01:49] astrologer he knew that his son har
[2:01:52] would die but that his seed would fill
[2:01:54] the land and he did it through Sarah so
[2:01:57] despite all the Decades of idol worship
[2:02:00] ter eventually saw the truth and belief
[2:02:03] in one God so he came
[2:02:06] around but notice Abraham God says I
[2:02:09] took you from took your father Abram
[2:02:11] from the other side of the flood and him
[2:02:13] throughout all the land of Canaan and
[2:02:15] multiply the seed and gave him Isaac I
[2:02:17] gave unto Isaac Jacob and and Esau and I
[2:02:20] gave unto Esau s to possess it but Jacob
[2:02:23] and his children went down to to Egypt I
[2:02:26] sent Moses also now he's going to tell
[2:02:28] them the history now he's coming to tell
[2:02:31] them the testimonies sometimes it's good
[2:02:33] for us to be reminded of what great
[2:02:34] things God has done right here in our
[2:02:36] local assembly let me tell you in a few
[2:02:39] months we're going to hear another great
[2:02:40] testimony how God overcame cancer how
[2:02:43] God defeated cancer and he's going to be
[2:02:44] sharing it to you you have witnessed
[2:02:46] this you have seen this this is who I am
[2:02:50] this is what I'm doing in your miss your
[2:02:52] eyes have witnessed the
[2:02:56] supernatural I brought you out of the
[2:02:58] land I brought your father out I I've
[2:03:00] done all these great things he says I
[2:03:02] sent Moses and Aaron I plagued Egypt
[2:03:04] according to that which was done among
[2:03:06] them and afterward I brought you out I
[2:03:08] brought your fathers out of Egypt and
[2:03:09] you came into the sea and the Egyptians
[2:03:12] pursued after your your fathers with
[2:03:14] chariots and Horsemen un the sea and
[2:03:16] when they Cried unto the Lord I put
[2:03:18] Darkness between you and the Egyptians
[2:03:20] and I brought the sea upon them and
[2:03:22] covered them and your eyes have seen
[2:03:24] what I have done in Egypt and you dwelt
[2:03:26] in the wilderness a long season and I
[2:03:28] brought you into the land of the
[2:03:29] amorites this is Joshua 24:8 which dwelt
[2:03:32] on the other side of Jordan and they
[2:03:34] fought with you and I gave them into
[2:03:35] your hand that you might possess their
[2:03:37] land and I destroy them from before you
[2:03:40] then he says in verse n then baac the
[2:03:42] son of zipper king of Moab arose and he
[2:03:44] war against Israel and he s he called
[2:03:46] balam the son of beor to curse you and
[2:03:49] but I would not hearken unto balum
[2:03:50] therefore he blessed you
[2:03:53] still oh church people tried to curse
[2:03:55] you but God just blesses you brother Joe
[2:03:59] look at your blessings oh my people try
[2:04:02] to curse you and condemn you but God's
[2:04:04] blessed you and multiplied your hand
[2:04:07] let's keep going he goes I went over
[2:04:09] Jordan and you went over Jordan and came
[2:04:11] unto Jericho and the men of Jericho
[2:04:13] fought against you and the amorites and
[2:04:15] the perizzites and the Canaanites and
[2:04:17] the Hittites and the gites and the
[2:04:18] hivites and the jebusites and I deliver
[2:04:21] delivered them into your
[2:04:24] hand and I sent Hornets before you which
[2:04:27] drave them out from before you even the
[2:04:29] two kings of the amorites but not with
[2:04:31] the sword nor with thy bow I've given
[2:04:34] you land for which you did not
[2:04:37] labor and cities which you did not build
[2:04:41] and you dwelt in them of The Vineyards
[2:04:44] and Olive yards which you ye planted not
[2:04:47] do you
[2:04:48] eat my he's reminding him everything
[2:04:52] that you have is because of
[2:04:57] me
[2:04:59] everything that you have is because of
[2:05:03] me and he's showing them all the great
[2:05:06] testimonies you should have been drowned
[2:05:08] in that red sea but I parted the seas in
[2:05:11] your life I brought you through I
[2:05:13] destroyed those task Masters that used
[2:05:16] to beat you and condemn you and accuse
[2:05:18] you I destroyed them and you saw the
[2:05:21] waters over overtake them I God had done
[2:05:24] all
[2:05:25] this and Joshua before his passing is
[2:05:29] reminding Israel of all that God has
[2:05:37] done and I love how God sometimes
[2:05:39] reminds us brother Tommy of where we
[2:05:42] have come from taking desire drugs right
[2:05:45] out of your
[2:05:46] life take the desire women and alcohol
[2:05:50] and party and that kind of kind of
[2:05:51] living right out of your life he's
[2:05:53] brought you through deep trials and
[2:05:55] afflictions and he's brought some of us
[2:05:57] older ones out of denominational
[2:06:01] isms and he placed you in the word of
[2:06:05] God in the can I say it like this he
[2:06:08] placed you in the promised
[2:06:13] land notice he reminds them to show them
[2:06:17] that this you must recognize the
[2:06:19] supernatural that's been in our midst
[2:06:22] this is not Legend though it's
[2:06:26] legendary this is not
[2:06:29] myth because he's greater than any
[2:06:32] myth and if we not having any ties to
[2:06:37] the message and see what God had done
[2:06:39] through a prophet in the 60s and 40s and
[2:06:41] 50s we would think it's all Legend but
[2:06:44] some of you here today can testify of
[2:06:47] the same power the same Grace the same
[2:06:51] healings that was done there is being
[2:06:54] done here again today because God
[2:06:57] doesn't
[2:06:58] change God doesn't
[2:07:05] change so he placed him in the choice
[2:07:08] land a great land a land that flows with
[2:07:10] milk and honey a land that God chose for
[2:07:13] the elect and God has taken you out of
[2:07:15] foreign lands you here this morning out
[2:07:19] of foreign lands and he's placed you in
[2:07:22] the message placed you in the word and
[2:07:25] he begins to remind them of all that
[2:07:28] he's done all the enemies that he
[2:07:34] destroyed I'm gonna go a little bit
[2:07:36] further now try to oh I got a lot of
[2:07:38] ground to cover I got 45 minutes can I
[2:07:41] go 45
[2:07:42] minutes
[2:07:45] notice showed them all the great
[2:07:49] enemies we heard through a prophet's
[2:07:52] Ministry cancer was defeated heart
[2:07:54] trouble Was Defeated blinded eyes open
[2:07:57] Dead Boys raised
[2:07:59] again dead babies come back to life he's
[2:08:03] showing all the he said there's nothing
[2:08:06] that stood before God and there's nobody
[2:08:09] that can stand before
[2:08:11] you so God has brought us here today not
[2:08:15] just here in this church but he's
[2:08:18] brought you here in this age
[2:08:22] cuz there's never been another people
[2:08:25] like you there's never been another age
[2:08:29] like this age you say what makes it so
[2:08:32] special brother Joo because there is
[2:08:34] going to be somebody that's going to
[2:08:36] fulfill the scriptures of being a part
[2:08:38] of those that are alive and
[2:08:41] remain those that are focused no matter
[2:08:43] what they see no matter the political
[2:08:45] drama out in the world no matter about
[2:08:47] Hollywood burning and Russia's in a war
[2:08:50] with the Ukraine and this is going on
[2:08:52] and that is going on and people are
[2:08:53] drifting away people are leaving the
[2:08:55] message yet God is determined I will
[2:08:58] have a bride she will be without spot
[2:09:02] she will be without blemish she will be
[2:09:05] perfect because a perfect word a perfect
[2:09:08] message has come and she has stressed
[2:09:10] herself with the baptism of the Holy
[2:09:12] Ghost she's put on the robe of
[2:09:14] righteousness she's not walking by her
[2:09:16] own ability she's walking by the power
[2:09:18] of a living God
[2:09:20] [Applause]
[2:09:27] I believe if we could be honest with
[2:09:29] ourselves today church this is the new
[2:09:30] year let's go into this new year and
[2:09:33] let's check it
[2:09:35] up and let's look back over this past

[2:12:37] of our hands he'll bless the fruit of
[2:12:38] our Fields he'll bless our churches
[2:12:41] we're
[2:12:42] blessed we're
[2:12:45] blessed and it's not man's
[2:12:48] doing it's God's doing
[2:12:52] so we can look and we can
[2:12:54] recount and I like brother B he preaches
[2:12:57] a message of thought as I thought on my
[2:13:01] ways sometimes it does US good to think
[2:13:05] about our
[2:13:07] ways as I told you Wednesday night
[2:13:09] there's not a day goes by that I'll wake
[2:13:11] up and I thank God for this
[2:13:13] message because I know where I was
[2:13:16] without it there's not a day that I
[2:13:18] don't lay my head on a pillow in the
[2:13:20] last prayers God God thank you for the
[2:13:22] truth for opening my eyes so that I can
[2:13:25] see it I don't take it for
[2:13:29] granted because I made a choice brother
[2:13:33] Tommy I made a choice to live and to
[2:13:36] serve
[2:13:38] God and you must make that same Choice
[2:13:42] young person you must make that same
[2:13:44] choice Mom you must make that same
[2:13:46] Choice Papa father leader of the home
[2:13:49] you must make that same
[2:13:52] choice so Joshua is causing the men to
[2:13:55] look look where we
[2:13:57] are can we on this new year look back
[2:14:02] brother Thomas is a church body when
[2:14:04] there used to be a little church with
[2:14:07] ouses as sister Donna said last night we
[2:14:10] were talking she says back when we had
[2:14:12] ouses you didn't see people popping up
[2:14:14] like popcorn running into the bathroom
[2:14:16] nobody wanted to go to the ouse maybe we
[2:14:19] needed shut the bathrooms put ouses in
[2:14:22] the
[2:14:23] back you give a preacher a complex every
[2:14:26] time you jump up and walk out like woo
[2:14:28] they going walk out on that one woo
[2:14:30] walking out on that one put some ouses
[2:14:33] ain't nobody running out we'll be
[2:14:35] sitting there holding it shake
[2:14:41] it yeah but look where the churches come
[2:14:47] from look where you have come
[2:14:49] from Lord
[2:14:51] amen look where you have come from we
[2:14:54] think about the church and we can see we
[2:14:55] can reflect over that and we can see the
[2:14:57] pot belly we can see the was flying
[2:14:59] around and M we can see the beautiful
[2:15:01] church God has blessed you with and a
[2:15:03] congregation brother Thomas that God has
[2:15:04] blessed you with and we can see we've
[2:15:07] been through
[2:15:09] battles it's not come
[2:15:12] easy but Joshua is showing them here we
[2:15:15] are in the
[2:15:18] land we're in the land of promise and
[2:15:22] can I tell you that we are in the land
[2:15:25] of the opening of the word the land of
[2:15:28] promise Generations Church ages have
[2:15:31] waited for this time and you're
[2:15:36] here I said you're
[2:15:40] here Lord this message went down through
[2:15:43] the Dark Ages and it was almost snuffed
[2:15:45] out was almost wiped out but God be to
[2:15:49] restore and look at it you you are the
[2:15:51] final
[2:15:52] restoration of what God's desire is and
[2:15:55] can I tell you like this that God is not
[2:15:58] complete without you and when we take a
[2:16:01] rapture we are the very completion of
[2:16:04] every thought that God had because he
[2:16:06] had thoughts of you before the
[2:16:07] foundation of the world and no matter
[2:16:09] what you'd have to come through no
[2:16:11] matter what afflictions you had to face
[2:16:13] God knew that you was going to be here
[2:16:15] and that you would be an overcomer and
[2:16:17] he's going to reward them that overcome
[2:16:19] to he that overcometh and the L to C and
[2:16:21] H will I grant to sit with me in my
[2:16:24] Throne that means there's going to be a
[2:16:26] bride ruling and reigning with him
[2:16:28] overcoming the loud de seeing Spirit of
[2:16:31] lukewarmness of cold formal of just
[2:16:33] going to church but they are going to be
[2:16:35] on fire for God they are going to be set
[2:16:38] apart separated from the things of the
[2:16:41] world oh Hallelujah somebody say Amen to
[2:16:44] the word of
[2:16:46] God we're not among those that are out
[2:16:49] there we are among the alive and the
[2:16:51] [Applause]
[2:16:59] remain he says Joshua
[2:17:02] 24:14 therefore
[2:17:05] fear the
[2:17:08] lord fear the lord job 28:28 behold the
[2:17:13] fear of the Lord that is
[2:17:15] wisdom to depart from Evil is to have
[2:17:18] understanding Psalms 2 and vers 11 serve
[2:17:21] the Lord with fear and rejoice with
[2:17:22] trembling Proverbs 1:7 the fear of the
[2:17:25] Lord is the beginning of
[2:17:29] knowledge reverence him church as a sole
[2:17:33] object of your religious
[2:17:35] worship it ain't about believing God
[2:17:38] sent a prophet I'm glad you do but if
[2:17:40] you just believe God s a prophet and
[2:17:42] you're not reverencing him what point
[2:17:45] what point what purpose
[2:17:51] notice reverence him for all the great
[2:17:55] things that he has done fear Him for
[2:17:59] goodness sake let him be your
[2:18:02] influence then we find in Joshua 24 and
[2:18:05] verse1
[2:18:07] 14 it says serve him in
[2:18:11] sincerity and in truth I hope this is
[2:18:14] okay brother
[2:18:17] Thomas serve him in sincerity
[2:18:21] and in truth so the Latin word here for
[2:18:26] sincerity comes from a word that denotes
[2:18:29] honey without
[2:18:32] wax honey without wax otherwise unmix
[2:18:38] Purity the Greek word is considered by
[2:18:41] some to be founded on the idea that
[2:18:43] something is held up into the Rays of
[2:18:45] the Sun and is proved to be without
[2:18:47] Speck or flaw
[2:18:50] there's going to be a church that God is
[2:18:53] going to raise up and he's going to lift
[2:18:55] up to the raise of his son and he's
[2:18:57] going to find she's Church she's my
[2:19:00] church she's bone of my bone Flesh of My
[2:19:02] Flesh she's my church she's without spot
[2:19:05] she's without blemish she's not laid
[2:19:07] down in a bed of Affliction when it's
[2:19:08] some man's idolatry but no she's a
[2:19:10] Church of the Living God and there's no
[2:19:12] flaw found in
[2:19:15] her
[2:19:18] sincerity and in truth serve him
[2:19:20] uprightness of your soul without
[2:19:23] hypocrisy or deceit and according to the
[2:19:26] truth of his word the Bible says in 1
[2:19:28] Corinthians 5 and verse 6 your glor is
[2:19:30] not good know you not that A little leav
[2:19:33] leaven a whole lump how many Bakers do
[2:19:37] we have in here this morning man we
[2:19:39] don't have very many people raise their
[2:19:40] hand thank you for putting your hand up
[2:19:42] thank you I mean y'all
[2:19:45] scared leav little bit of yeast will
[2:19:49] flow out through the whole lump of dough
[2:19:52] and it leavens the whole lump but notice
[2:19:56] what it says here it says Purge out
[2:19:59] there for the old
[2:20:01] leaven once you put the leaven
[2:20:04] in you got to be quick to remove the
[2:20:07] leaven from the lump or the entire lump
[2:20:10] becomes leavened says that you may be a
[2:20:13] new lump so notice when we have this
[2:20:16] kind of preaching it's not not to
[2:20:18] condemn you but that you'll become a new
[2:20:20] lump
[2:20:22] for even Christ Our Passover is
[2:20:24] sacrificed for us therefore let us keep
[2:20:27] the feast not with the old leaven
[2:20:30] neither with the leaven of malice and
[2:20:31] wickedness but with the unleavened bread
[2:20:34] of
[2:20:35] sincerity and
[2:20:37] Truth now I'm going to skip some things
[2:20:40] because I want to get
[2:20:41] somewhere and we find brother bandam had
[2:20:44] a
[2:20:45] dream he had a dream of a mamba
[2:20:49] snake this m B snake was coming at him
[2:20:52] hissing he said it got to get closer and
[2:20:54] try to hit but it would miss it couldn't
[2:20:56] attack me he said then it turned from me
[2:20:58] they went to my friend he's jumping over
[2:21:00] jumping over jumping over and he said
[2:21:01] God if if that thing hits him he's going
[2:21:03] to
[2:21:04] die and the Lord came now in his dream
[2:21:07] and said you have been given power to
[2:21:11] bind him and the
[2:21:16] worst come on
[2:21:19] church he he said the serpent turned to
[2:21:21] me and I said I looked at me again and a
[2:21:23] voice came from heaven and said you've
[2:21:24] been given power to bind him the worst
[2:21:26] are any and I said God what must I do he
[2:21:31] said there's one thing that you must do
[2:21:33] you must be more
[2:21:38] sincere don't you understand why I'm my
[2:21:41] heart has been pulled this this way this
[2:21:43] morning it's not to condemn you it's not
[2:21:46] to bash you it's not to criticize you
[2:21:50] but it's to encourage you to be more
[2:21:52] sincere he said you have been given
[2:21:55] power to bind the serpent but it's going
[2:21:58] to take a take a deeper
[2:22:02] sincerity said God will forg he says and
[2:22:05] brother B says now God forgive me for my
[2:22:07] insinc or my insincerity and let me have
[2:22:09] sincerity and when I raised up my hands
[2:22:11] to him there was a great something came
[2:22:13] over me just lifted me up seemed like
[2:22:15] the whole body was charged with
[2:22:16] something and I looked at the serpent
[2:22:18] and it started towards me and he he
[2:22:20] couldn't do it yet and I said Satan in
[2:22:21] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I bind
[2:22:24] you and the serpent he said a blue smoke
[2:22:27] flew out of him and he cured up he made
[2:22:29] a sign like an s a capital S backwards
[2:22:31] like an N sign that which means bind
[2:22:34] this one or anything below
[2:22:38] him church if we're going to be a
[2:22:40] Victorious church if we're going to see
[2:22:43] cancer defeated we're going to see homes
[2:22:46] restored we're going to see the pews
[2:22:48] filled
[2:22:51] we're going to see our way where young
[2:22:52] people on fire for
[2:22:54] God then it's going to take a greater
[2:22:58] sincerity cuz you can bind
[2:23:01] him and anything below
[2:23:04] him you can bind him and any disease any
[2:23:09] Affliction any spirit that would try to
[2:23:11] slip its way in you can bind it and he
[2:23:15] also the angel of the Lord or the spirit
[2:23:16] of God told brother man just so you know
[2:23:19] you can also un unbind
[2:23:22] him so not only church do you have the
[2:23:26] power to bind but you have the power to
[2:23:28] unbind it and let that thing
[2:23:31] loose but it takes a greater sincerity
[2:23:34] brother B say he woke up from the dream
[2:23:35] he went and got his Bible and he flipped
[2:23:37] over to First Corinthians he goes when
[2:23:39] you come to the feast the feast which a
[2:23:42] fast and the bodies the feast with the
[2:23:44] Lord he said we know that so when you
[2:23:46] come to the feast don't come with old
[2:23:47] leaven leav of malice notice malice and
[2:23:50] so forth come with the unleavened bread
[2:23:53] of sincerity and Truth just exactly what
[2:23:55] he had told me in the
[2:23:57] vision come with the unleavened bread of
[2:24:00] sincerity and truth that is the
[2:24:04] word then he says and I seen what he
[2:24:07] meant so brother Bram at one point in
[2:24:10] his ministry was so captivated by The
[2:24:12] Miracles and was the signs and the
[2:24:15] Wonders and he was constantly having a
[2:24:18] vision having a vision having a vision
[2:24:20] having a Vision having a vision having a
[2:24:24] vision but it's going to take more than
[2:24:25] that to catch the rainbow
[2:24:27] trout it's G to take the
[2:24:30] word can I tell you you are the rainbow
[2:24:35] trout so if a prophet of God had to be
[2:24:37] more SE to to bind the serpent what
[2:24:40] about
[2:24:42] us we can't bind him just by believing
[2:24:44] claiming that we're Believers claiming
[2:24:46] that we believe God sent a prophet
[2:24:47] claiming that we believe the message of
[2:24:48] the hour we can't bind him we still
[2:24:50] having desires of the things of the
[2:24:51] world in our heart the only way we can
[2:24:54] bind the serpent him the worst or
[2:24:56] anything below him is to have a life
[2:24:58] that's
[2:25:01] sincere and Joshua calls the men of
[2:25:04] Israel choose you this
[2:25:07] day notice he didn't put it off to
[2:25:11] 2026 he didn't put it off to May when
[2:25:13] you have your special meetings he didn't
[2:25:15] put it off to Wednesday night when it
[2:25:17] was just going to be a you know maybe
[2:25:18] our Wednesday night services we don't
[2:25:19] put so much credit or Credence on them
[2:25:21] like we do Sunday morning no no no every
[2:25:23] service is equally the same that's
[2:25:26] right Joshua says choose you this
[2:25:32] day whom you're going to
[2:25:34] serve choose for yourselves in verse 15
[2:25:38] choose for yourselves this day whom
[2:25:40] you're going to serve so it comes down
[2:25:44] individually it doesn't depend on who
[2:25:46] your what church you attend who your
[2:25:47] pastor is who your parents are choose
[2:25:50] ose your C you can't kick the can down
[2:25:54] the road any
[2:25:56] longer God's calling for a total
[2:25:59] separation of unbelief and he says if it
[2:26:03] seems evil to serve the
[2:26:06] Lord if it's so evil to serve the Lord
[2:26:11] then you got a choice the god of the
[2:26:13] amorites the god of the Egyptians oh you
[2:26:17] can serve Tera gods that were on the
[2:26:20] other side of the flood see CU Joshua
[2:26:23] knew you're going to serve
[2:26:27] something there's not one of us here
[2:26:30] that's not serving
[2:26:32] something we make something a God you
[2:26:36] can make your career a God you can make
[2:26:38] your money a God you can make your car a
[2:26:40] God your house a God your spouse a
[2:26:42] God but there's only one God the Bible
[2:26:46] says in Matthew 6:24 no man can serve
[2:26:48] two masters
[2:26:50] notice it says for either he will hate
[2:26:52] one and love the other or he will hold
[2:26:53] to one and despise the other you cannot
[2:26:56] serve God and man so we
[2:26:59] find that we have to make a choice and I
[2:27:03] I'm gonna try to get in try to get
[2:27:04] through some of this see Joshua made a
[2:27:08] decision me and my
[2:27:13] house see Joshua had a history he had a
[2:27:17] relationship brother Thomas he knew what
[2:27:20] it meant to serve God he knew what it
[2:27:22] meant to follow under Moses and be
[2:27:25] obedient to a
[2:27:27] pastor though maybe he didn't understand
[2:27:30] all of moses' thinking and all of his
[2:27:32] theology he trusted that the god that
[2:27:34] spoke to Moses was still his God and he
[2:27:37] was going to follow Moses no matter
[2:27:39] where Moses was told to go Joshua was
[2:27:41] going to follow Joshua was going to be
[2:27:42] in obedience and when it came time for
[2:27:44] the ministry to come off of Moses and to
[2:27:47] come on the Joshua Joshua just stepped
[2:27:49] right into it
[2:27:52] he didn't kick against it he didn't harp
[2:27:54] against see Joshua decision meant that
[2:27:56] all hesitation was gone his decision
[2:27:59] meant that he lived above all the evil
[2:28:01] influences of the others his decision
[2:28:03] was deep it was calm it was clear it was
[2:28:05] fixed it was well grounded and it was
[2:28:07] solemnly made he look and he made his
[2:28:11] decision
[2:28:12] openly this wasn't something he' done in
[2:28:14] a
[2:28:16] closet he wanted all of Israel to know
[2:28:21] for me and for my
[2:28:24] house we're going to serve
[2:28:28] God for me and my kids and my wife we're
[2:28:34] going to serve
[2:28:38] God see he has served God his whole
[2:28:42] life and brother B says I can't make
[2:28:45] your
[2:28:46] decision I can only pray for you you
[2:28:50] have to make your
[2:28:52] decision let me hurry this on up cuz I
[2:28:54] want to get to the dream brother says
[2:28:56] judgment begins at the house of God
[2:28:58] we're in the house of God tonight you
[2:28:59] got to make your decision you got to
[2:29:01] make your decision whether you'll come
[2:29:03] to Christ or whether you'll turn him
[2:29:04] down every sinner in here has got to
[2:29:07] make a decision right now you'll either
[2:29:09] go out that door better man or woman
[2:29:11] than you came in or you'll go out worse
[2:29:13] than you was when you come in you can't
[2:29:15] stand mediocre tonight you got to make
[2:29:18] it hey this is on my heart he said it
[2:29:21] was on my heart but now it's on your
[2:29:23] hands you got to make your decision you

[2:29:28] a good church member maybe you've always
[2:29:30] longed that always longed that you
[2:29:32] wanted more of God you might have wanted
[2:29:34] to do something for God remember you're
[2:29:36] only mortal once that one time was the
[2:29:38] only time you're going to be mortal this
[2:29:41] may be the time that you got to make
[2:29:42] your decision you're either going to
[2:29:44] move up with God or stay where you are
[2:29:46] you may have to make your decision
[2:29:49] tonight
[2:29:51] Every Man Has a choice every man is
[2:29:54] governed by some passion some guiding
[2:29:57] principle some
[2:29:58] philosophy which becomes his
[2:30:02] God he's governed he's going to
[2:30:05] serve serve this flesh and this flesh
[2:30:08] becomes a God to us our desires of
[2:30:11] success and money and career becomes a
[2:30:13] God to us wealth Fame you know brother

[2:31:54] passion God's of pride and arrogance
[2:31:57] can't be corrected by nobody much less
[2:32:00] correction of the word feel like you're

[2:32:29] follow peace with all men and Holiness
[2:32:31] without which no man shall see the Lord
[2:32:33] looking diligently lest any man fall by
[2:32:36] the grace of God lest any root of
[2:32:38] bitterness springing up trouble you
[2:32:40] bitterness is Extreme
[2:32:42] wickedness especially they call it
[2:32:45] poison it's bitterness directly traced
[2:32:48] to the failure to forgive
[2:32:51] of it makes you costic sarcastic
[2:32:54] condemning and nasty how many's raising
[2:32:57] your hand I want to be
[2:32:59] bitter no you don't be costic
[2:33:04] nasty bitterness is anger that is
[2:33:06] fermented in the hearts of those that
[2:33:08] will not
[2:33:10] forgive and that thing becomes a
[2:33:13] god oh you're sitting in the presence
[2:33:16] Supernatural all
[2:33:18] around but it a little God that I'm
[2:33:21] serving I want to let go of I'm holding
[2:33:24] ONN to this hurt I'm holding on to this
[2:33:26] bitterness it gives me a sense of power
[2:33:30] gives me a sense of purpose of
[2:33:36] belonging brother says get all these
[2:33:38] little differences away from your little
[2:33:39] isms little funny feelings around you
[2:33:42] from your
[2:33:45] brethren oh well I thought that was you
[2:33:48] being mean brother Joon I'm telling you
[2:33:49] what the prophet
[2:33:51] said around you for Brethren and things
[2:33:55] like that shake it away don't let no
[2:33:57] root of biters ever get into your soul
[2:33:59] if you do it will caner
[2:34:04] you brother says also he said inmer
[2:34:07] church he said a root of bitterness
[2:34:09] defiles
[2:34:11] many then there's God's of jealousy and
[2:34:13] jealousy is a complex emotion that
[2:34:15] evolves feelings of insecurity fear and
[2:34:17] anxiety notice Cain
[2:34:21] everything we're talking about we take
[2:34:22] it back to the Bible Cain slew his
[2:34:24] brother at the
[2:34:27] altar at the
[2:34:29] altar worshiping God he slays his
[2:34:32] brother on the altar because of
[2:34:36] jealousy and some of us we look at what
[2:34:40] this one has and we be
[2:34:42] jealous or maybe favor that this one has
[2:34:46] belongings things material things or
[2:34:48] even spiritual ual growth Revelation and
[2:34:52] if we're not careful we become
[2:34:56] jealous can I tell you what the jealousy
[2:34:59] does to your body though let me just
[2:35:00] show you some things jealousy places
[2:35:03] strain on the
[2:35:04] heart palpitations may be felt jealousy
[2:35:07] stimulates sympathetic nervous system
[2:35:10] hormones like adrenaline are released to
[2:35:12] promote flight or fight responses
[2:35:14] jealous emotions quickly show on our
[2:35:17] faces ooo
[2:35:20] You Can't
[2:35:22] Hide let me tell you people know when
[2:35:25] Joe Adams ain't happy it's all over my
[2:35:27] body I'm like oh I hate
[2:35:31] that that's when sometimes I just stay
[2:35:33] at home Alone brother Brad it's just
[2:35:35] best don't even
[2:35:37] go because it shows notice what it says
[2:35:41] jealousy now I wasn't saying I was
[2:35:42] jealous I'm just saying there's times I
[2:35:44] just want to be by myself there's times
[2:35:47] we don't have good days people okay
[2:35:50] jealously displays in frowns narrow eyes
[2:35:53] pressed lips flare nostrils clinched
[2:35:58] Jaws none of y'all have ever been there
[2:36:01] Cher thems right all of y'all got your
[2:36:03] wings on got them tucked in your purse
[2:36:04] and you're sitting on them so you don't
[2:36:06] fly away right
[2:36:07] now studies reveal that jealousy places
[2:36:11] stress on the immune system chronic
[2:36:13] stress also lowers immunity by reducing
[2:36:16] white blood cells to fight infection
[2:36:18] suppressed immunity immunity from
[2:36:20] jealousy makes people more susceptible
[2:36:22] to colds flu other illnesses viruses
[2:36:26] like the Epstein bar that causes a
[2:36:28] fatigue may also reactivate old injuries
[2:36:31] and pain can flare up due to weakness of
[2:36:34] defenses due to
[2:36:35] [Music]
[2:36:37] jealousy a little God nobody knows about
[2:36:40] it but man your face sure shows it your
[2:36:43] body still shows it wonder why you got
[2:36:46] all those ailments and all that sickness
[2:36:48] and all that come now ever can get
[2:36:52] well oh but I'm in the promised land put
[2:36:56] away the
[2:37:00] gods God's a grudges let's look at
[2:37:02] another one I got 15 minutes I'm gonna
[2:37:04] try to hit that cuz I got a long
[2:37:06] drive Leviticus 19:17 Thou shalt not
[2:37:09] hate thy brother in thy
[2:37:12] heart woo praise God Thou shalt not hate
[2:37:17] thy brother in thy heart well where
[2:37:18] should we hate him
[2:37:20] don't hate your
[2:37:21] brother don't hate him in your heart
[2:37:23] don't hate him in your home don't hate
[2:37:24] him at church don't hate him when you're
[2:37:26] alone don't hate your brother love your
[2:37:30] neighbor pray for those that despite use
[2:37:33] you notice Thou shalt in any wise rebuke
[2:37:37] thy neighbor and not suffer sin upon Him
[2:37:39] Thou shalt not
[2:37:43] avenge Thou shalt not avenge that means
[2:37:46] you ain't got to talk about it you ain't
[2:37:48] got to run them down
[2:37:50] brother said if somebody done you wrong
[2:37:52] don't mention
[2:37:54] it you don't have to avenge nor bear any
[2:38:00] grudge against the children of thy
[2:38:02] people but Thou shalt love thy neighbor
[2:38:04] as thyself I am the Lord so what is a
[2:38:07] grudge persistent feeling of ill will
[2:38:09] resentment resulting from a past insult
[2:38:12] or injury so let's just look at what
[2:38:15] grudges do to us is this okay
[2:38:19] it snares you in anger and makes you
[2:38:21] more prone to persistent renumeration
[2:38:24] rather than moving forward with your
[2:38:26] life when you got a grudge you just keep
[2:38:28] going over it and you keep grinding it
[2:38:30] and you keep grinding it and you keep
[2:38:32] and you look at that per and you you
[2:38:34] know the flares the Jaws tighten nostril
[2:38:36] flare eyebrows all that stuff we just
[2:38:38] read about that's what happens when
[2:38:39] you're holding on to a grudge you just
[2:38:41] live it and live it and replay it and
[2:38:43] replay it and replay it and replay
[2:38:46] it Grudge inhibit your ability to cope
[2:38:49] with or resolve your issue and keeps you
[2:38:51] stuck in the
[2:38:54] past now I started this message and
[2:38:57] Joshua started this message out by
[2:39:00] showing you all that God has done all
[2:39:03] the great victories all the great
[2:39:05] Miracles where he's placed you now we're
[2:39:07] in the word and he's telling us we must
[2:39:10] put away these strange
[2:39:14] Gods foreign God grudges are foreign to
[2:39:18] Lord
[2:39:20] bitterness is forign to the Lord notice
[2:39:23] also Grudge holding can adversely impact
[2:39:25] your mental
[2:39:27] health and you wonder why some people
[2:39:29] are
[2:39:33] stupid they let go of that
[2:39:36] Grudge it impacts your mental
[2:39:40] health I knew y'all thought that'd be
[2:39:42] funny I just slipped that in there for
[2:39:45] you that's that's Louisiana that's cjun
[2:39:48] talk
[2:39:50] sometimes we wonder how can people be
[2:39:52] like that cuz they
[2:39:55] stupid it makes you feel angrier
[2:39:59] grudges I know nobody's in here has ever
[2:40:02] lost
[2:40:03] sleep because you replayed that scenario
[2:40:06] over and over and over and over right
[2:40:15] nobody oh my well praise God we're not a
[2:40:18] perfect church are we notice now instead
[2:40:22] of accepting and moving on from a
[2:40:23] negative experience or finding an
[2:40:25] acceptable resolution holding on can
[2:40:28] trap you in the
[2:40:30] loop of resentment of bitterness of
[2:40:33] hopelessness of emptiness of an
[2:40:37] enragement simply put harboring negative
[2:40:39] feelings naturally makes you more
[2:40:41] exposed to those more unpleasant
[2:40:43] emotions and thoughts which can skew
[2:40:45] your mindset toward negativity either
[2:40:48] slowly or with a swift shift any focus
[2:40:51] on negativity can damper your overall
[2:40:53] well-being as I said Wednesday night you
[2:40:55] know there's just some people you just
[2:40:57] don't want to be
[2:40:58] around they're so
[2:41:01] negative now let's look at the god of
[2:41:05] Envy this one we don't talk about very
[2:41:08] much do we Envy is a feeling of
[2:41:10] discontentment or resentful longing
[2:41:13] aroused by someone else's possessions
[2:41:16] qualities luck desire to have a quality
[2:41:19] possession or other desirable attributes
[2:41:22] belonging to someone else and if we're
[2:41:25] not careful the devil will take your
[2:41:28] eyes of off how God has blessed you
[2:41:30] personally how he's blessed your family
[2:41:33] how he's blessed your home how he's
[2:41:35] blessed your marriage and he's got you
[2:41:37] pointing over here looking at somebody
[2:41:39] else my brother so and so drove up in a
[2:41:42] new Ford well big
[2:41:45] deal you got your children his kids are
[2:41:48] wer
[2:41:49] you're worried about his forward he's
[2:41:51] looking at your kids wishing he could
[2:41:52] have the same kind of family that you
[2:41:54] got
[2:41:56] Envy Envy a god of Envy never satisfied
[2:42:01] with what God has done for
[2:42:03] us always looking always looking always
[2:42:07] comparing comparing Ministry comparing
[2:42:10] talents comparing I wish I could sing
[2:42:12] like this one God put you to sing the
[2:42:15] way you sing to bless the people the way
[2:42:17] you bless the people
[2:42:20] notice Envy like other feelings may be
[2:42:22] experienced in a various uh and and it
[2:42:25] intensifies in various ways it may be
[2:42:27] considered beny uh which sometimes in
[2:42:30] comparison motivates us to improve our
[2:42:32] lives sometimes it can be destructive
[2:42:34] where all that you do is compare
[2:42:37] yourself to the next person let me just
[2:42:39] tell you serving God is not a
[2:42:42] competition it's not a
[2:42:47] competition little God of Envy let's
[2:42:50] kick it out of a heart then there's
[2:42:51] God's of resentment feelings that
[2:42:53] increases stress
[2:42:56] levels chronic sleep deprivation is
[2:42:58] associated with the multitude of health
[2:43:00] problems including obesity diabetes
[2:43:03] cognitive impairment all because of
[2:43:05] resentment you resent somebody so
[2:43:09] much can I tell you when you have
[2:43:11] bitterness envy and jealousy resentment
[2:43:14] crudes you're not hurting the other
[2:43:17] individual
[2:43:20] you are actually physically spiritually
[2:43:24] hurting
[2:43:27] yourself so now I come to the part of
[2:43:31] the message to where God gave me the
[2:43:32] dream I had a dream 3 o'clock 3:30 I
[2:43:36] believe it was Saturday morning I woke
[2:43:37] up Sunday morning and this dream it was
[2:43:39] so
[2:43:40] vivid it's a
[2:43:43] dream names and faces we will not tell
[2:43:48] it's a dream
[2:43:49] my daughter and I Rebecca were having
[2:43:52] dinner with a pastor and his
[2:43:55] wife the wife made mention of something
[2:43:58] that some of the young people had
[2:44:01] said about her husband about his
[2:44:04] preaching about the church and I looked
[2:44:07] at her and I said you just have to let
[2:44:09] those things
[2:44:11] go you know they're young people they
[2:44:14] don't know what they're talking about
[2:44:15] and her response was they heard it from
[2:44:18] someone where they must have heard it
[2:44:20] from their
[2:44:21] parents and my response was they may
[2:44:24] have heard
[2:44:25] it and they may have said it but you
[2:44:29] have to choose to let it
[2:44:32] go you have a
[2:44:35] choice well how you going to
[2:44:38] respond and as I finished my plate of
[2:44:41] food and I was about to walk out our
[2:44:43] husband walk back into the room and he
[2:44:45] could not sit down and have the meal
[2:44:47] with us because he was so tore up
[2:44:50] because of what was said to so tore up
[2:44:52] brother Thomas with
[2:44:53] bitterness and anger and
[2:44:58] jealousy and bear in mind this
[2:45:00] pastor had a lot of health
[2:45:04] issues cancer in his body heart trouble
[2:45:07] things his body failing
[2:45:09] him because something happened to his
[2:45:12] church church went through a split and
[2:45:16] he's never been able to move from that
[2:45:18] split in he's
[2:45:20] hurt and it's all he preaches about is
[2:45:23] his hurt all his focus is that church
[2:45:27] and as me and my wife now know me and my
[2:45:29] daughter Rebecca got up to leave as I
[2:45:31] was walking out the door he made a
[2:45:34] comment brother Tommy says let's just
[2:45:36] keep this between
[2:45:38] us and I was walking and he had an
[2:45:41] outside staircase I was walking down and
[2:45:43] I looked back at him and I
[2:45:45] said I know how you feel more than you
[2:45:51] realize how well do I
[2:45:54] know how you feel and what you're
[2:45:58] experiencing and I looked at him and I
[2:46:00] said I have been
[2:46:01] hurt but I choose to go
[2:46:04] on I have been wronged by Men by
[2:46:08] churchmen by
[2:46:09] Brothers but I chose not to hold it
[2:46:13] against
[2:46:14] them I have felt the pain and the agony
[2:46:17] of bitterness in
[2:46:20] resentment but I chose to
[2:46:23] forgive see I chose not to hold on to
[2:46:26] bitterness and I was walking down I kept
[2:46:28] looking at and said I chose not to hold
[2:46:30] on to the bitterness I chose not to hold
[2:46:33] on to the jealousy I choose not to hold
[2:46:35] on to the resentment and and the malice
[2:46:37] I choose not to hold on to the wrongs
[2:46:39] and keep reminding them of what they've
[2:46:41] done I choose to forgive and I choose to
[2:46:44] serve the
[2:46:46] Lord I choose not to
[2:46:50] die holding on the
[2:46:53] things that I shouldn't be holding on to
[2:46:56] and my last words to him was I choose to
[2:47:02] live I choose to live to live free from
[2:47:08] bitterness to live victorious in the
[2:47:10] promised land of the word to live with
[2:47:14] no resentment toward anybody or
[2:47:16] anything to live without any malice or
[2:47:20] any grief or any jealousy over anything
[2:47:23] that's been done or any
[2:47:25] recount Joshua still the
[2:47:31] people and he said choose you this
[2:47:34] day whom you're going to
[2:47:38] serve we're going to look here in
[2:47:40] Deuteronomy as I bring this to a close
[2:47:41] Deuteronomy
[2:47:45] 30:9 I call Heaven and Earth to record
[2:47:48] this day against you you that I have set
[2:47:49] before you life and death blessing and
[2:47:53] cursings therefore choose
[2:47:57] life therefore choose like and brother
[2:48:01] Bron makes a statement here in by faith
[2:48:03] Moses he said A man was
[2:48:05] given the privilege to choose one he
[2:48:08] desired and so it is today you're given
[2:48:11] a privilege as free moral agents to
[2:48:12] choose whatever you want to choose my
[2:48:15] advice to you is don't look at the
[2:48:18] modern things around you the popularity
[2:48:21] the glamour that you could be but choose
[2:48:23] rather by faith him and give the promise
[2:48:27] that someday he will come and righten
[2:48:29] all the wrongs and will give you eternal
[2:48:32] life and raise you
[2:48:34] up as I am musicians if you would
[2:48:42] come
[2:48:45] Joshua for me
[2:48:49] and I don't want you to look at me when
[2:48:50] I say this as a preacher but for
[2:48:52] me and for my
[2:48:56] family I choose to serve the
[2:48:59] Lord for
[2:49:01] me and for my family I'm going on with
[2:49:08] God and he's reminded and if that's the
[2:49:10] case if you are then you got to put
[2:49:13] these other things
[2:49:15] away now as we start this New Year
[2:49:20] if you know that song draw me draw me
[2:49:24] Lord y know that maybe not just play
[2:49:29] something here Josh
[2:49:31] was about to cross off the
[2:49:34] scene stricken in age but he made a
[2:49:39] declaration to all men to all leaders to
[2:49:44] all the
[2:49:45] families I'm going to serve the Lord
[2:49:48] this church can empty out but I'm going
[2:49:50] to serve the Lord there may not be
[2:49:53] another church invite me to their Church
[2:49:54] to preach but I'm going to serve the
[2:49:56] Lord I may not have a friend left in the
[2:49:58] world but I'm going to serve the
[2:50:00] Lord for me and my
[2:50:04] family me and my family we got to make a
[2:50:08] decision and some of you have been hurt
[2:50:11] some of you have been
