[0:00] that that spiritual warfare the spoken
[0:03] word The Original Seed the seed of
[0:05] discrepancy Jesus Christ said that we
[0:08] believe it we can receive it we are free
[0:10] right now not going to be we're already
[0:12] free that's been the name of the Lord
[0:14] you know we're the bride of Christ you
[0:16] know what like I put up there you know
[0:17] this manner from Heaven the message of
[0:19] the hours Jesus Christ ain't coming he's
[0:21] all right
[0:22] already here he's here today whatever
[0:24] you have need of he's here hallelujah
[0:27] man he's living through US fleshly
[0:28] Hearts he's living out through us we're
[0:30] walking talking written Epistles red
[0:32] ball men that's Jesus Christ Living
[0:34] Through us are we his hands eyes ears
[0:36] and feet all that he can do is get
[0:37] himself more Victory through us that
[0:39] should be his name Lord I just love the
[0:41] Lord I Just Want To Praise His Name you
[0:43] know man gets me all pumped up thinking
[0:45] about him man he's so good to me you
[0:47] know I said let us not let it become
[0:49] common to us that you know he's passing
[0:51] our way you know and I had to write this
[0:54] all down because I can get I'm already
[0:56] winging it right now but if I get I'm
[0:57] trying not to go too long you know I'm
[0:59] trying to keep it on track here but you
[1:02] know the Lord you know he was dealing
[1:04] with me you know we don't want to let
[1:06] things come coming to us you know
[1:08] and all that we do you know you know
[1:10] like I told Brother Josh you know I said
[1:12] I was reading Psalms 91 every day there
[1:14] for a long time and then I don't know
[1:16] that song thou Lord or uh shield for me
[1:19] and you know and I hadn't opened the
[1:21] Bible one day and it was Psalms three
[1:22] and it was that very song that I was
[1:24] singing all the time and I started
[1:25] reading that every day
[1:26] foreign
[1:27] you know and and I put it down here a
[1:30] little bit in Psalms 3 it says uh but
[1:33] thou Lord all right my shield for my
[1:35] glory the lifter in my head I cried on
[1:37] the Lord with my voice he heard me out
[1:39] of his holy hell Salah I laid me down
[1:41] and slept and the Lord sustained me you
[1:44] know and I will not be afraid of ten
[1:45] thousands of people but let me say this
[1:47] is spiritual warfare raging the devil
[1:49] hates me I hate him and it don't matter
[1:51] how many he's against me the
[1:53] Lord God's with me Ain't Nothing Gonna
[1:55] hinder me you know you know what you
[1:57] know what the devil child do you know he
[1:59] couldn't come get me with the aorta or
[2:00] oxygen or a heart problem or nothing
[2:02] like that because Jesus Christ unhealed
[2:03] me it's already done but me and Tammy
[2:06] weighed out my propane tanks and one
[2:07] night I cooked one meal next morning I
[2:09] woke up going fired up and through the
[2:11] night it was getting really cold I'd
[2:12] fire up my rope my other big propane
[2:14] tank fire it up and uh uh you know
[2:18] throughout the night I woke up the next
[2:19] morning gonna fire up my coffee propane
[2:21] tank was empty so what did the Lord do
[2:23] he sustained me all through the night I
[2:25] must have sit there and breathe that
[2:26] propane and how much when I lit up the
[2:28] other propane thank you you know how
[2:30] they do that anyway if the room was
[2:32] filled what it was a lord sustaining me
[2:34] I believe that was a scripture he laid
[2:36] on my heart to keep reading and
[2:37] believing it because he's with me even
[2:39] in me to the end of the world oh I just
[2:41] love him he's so rich in Mercy but think
[2:43] about it he says I laid me down and slip
[2:45] and the Lord sustained me he kept me
[2:47] when they try to come and try to get you
[2:49] when you can't see you got a protection
[2:51] he's got my six he's going with me
[2:53] possibly the name of the Lord my
[2:55] goodness he's so good to us ain't he and
[2:57] I said I just wanted to uh I said thank
[3:00] you for a second let's just think for a
[3:02] second here what are we here for you
[3:04] know I was I was just I really got to
[3:06] really thinking on this what are we here
[3:08] for are we here to live and die and be a
[3:11] bump on the log and go through the
[3:12] motions and just uh come and go and go
[3:14] to heaven go to hell go to some
[3:16] fairytale line I don't think so we're in
[3:18] a spiritual warfare we're Sons and
[3:20] Daughters of God Jesus Christ wants to
[3:22] live through us we are we doing our
[3:24] vessels to him to get himself more glory
[3:26] and iron praise due to his name blessed
[3:28] be the name of the Lord we're the body
[3:30] of Christ this is what it says Gibson
[3:32] Collins are without repentance what whoa
[3:34] you know what we might not be gifted to
[3:36] be Pastor preachers singers it don't
[3:37] matter but guess what we're called out
[3:39] people we hear the message of our the
[3:42] Manna From Heaven Jesus Christ is here
[3:43] if that is it is that a gift if we're
[3:47] wanting a million is that a gift
[3:50] more than more than conquerors we're
[3:53] we're the body of Christ think about it
[3:55] for a second when you just stop and
[3:56] think we're the highest up is you can be
[3:58] in God's Army right now
[4:03] [Applause]
[4:06] I don't know what you came here to do
[4:08] but I can't praise the Lord we're in
[4:10] spiritual warfare it's your time right
[4:11] now this is when we come to battle we
[4:13] come you know they would go kill
[4:15] Philistines and Army and battle them
[4:16] battle that's what we're doing right now
[4:18] stand for Jesus Christ clap your hands
[4:21] praise the Lord giving amen give him a
[4:23] shout but be the name of the Lord glory
[4:26] to God just get me all fired up inside
[4:29] thinking about him
[4:30] I said there was a day there I just
[4:32] opened my Bible I don't know how I know
[4:34] I know at least five times and I've
[4:36] opened it a couple times since then and
[4:38] the Lord put me I just you ever do it
[4:40] just just because of the way you got
[4:41] Lord open the Bible five times
[4:45] it landed me on the very last chapter in
[4:48] Ecclesiastes and he said fear God keep
[4:52] my Commandments that's the whole duty of
[4:54] mine I just love that I open it again
[4:57] well I came to one time the one day this
[4:59] one person share here and wrap it up
[5:01] here sorry taking so long but uh I came
[5:05] to the it's just I thought it was just
[5:06] so ironic you know that day this is
[5:09] where I'm going
[5:10] all right so I wanted to share this
[5:13] because you know
[5:14] has re-fired me up it beat me down but
[5:17] it brought me back up God works all
[5:19] things for the good you know I said when
[5:21] the Lord comes knocking we don't want to
[5:23] miss it so today if he comes knocking at
[5:25] your horse door or if he starts dealing
[5:27] with you don't ignore it don't let it
[5:29] become common to us that's what that's
[5:30] what you know because you know I said
[5:33] there was a day there I went and had
[5:35] cold plunge then I I was just having a
[5:38] time with the Lord this morning I
[5:39] overslept and I'm like you know what so
[5:41] I just start praising God always playing
[5:42] a little bit of music listening to some
[5:44] sermons just having Church me and the
[5:46] Lord
[5:48] and I went down I was coming back down
[5:49] the road there on the four-wheeler and
[5:51] just something dropped down my the same
[5:53] voice that said why don't you fast today
[5:57] and I sit there and reasoned it out you
[5:59] know you know I was like was that me
[6:02] yeah I can't pass today I thought to
[6:04] myself I gotta hike all these mountains
[6:06] you know I can't be passing today but
[6:09] you know
[6:10] I went on and when I found my I came
[6:12] back I'm like Lord I'm really I just
[6:15] think I need something from me I opened
[6:17] the Bible and then I flip back one page
[6:19] just so ironically I flip back one page
[6:22] he said eat that bread and drink that
[6:25] wine I was thinking of wine the Holy
[6:27] Spirit stimulation of Revelation blessed
[6:29] to be the name of the Lord okay so I
[6:31] went on it restored my joy okay maybe
[6:33] that was just me making that up in my
[6:34] head
[6:35] well I went on and then I realized you
[6:38] know that same voice I went back to the
[6:41] day right there I was sitting over there
[6:42] the same voice came to me once you quit
[6:44] smoking today I said I can't quit
[6:45] smoking today I'm going to Papa's
[6:47] everybody at my papa smokes and he said
[6:49] why don't you hang out with like faith I
[6:50] said I will 19 years I've never smoked a
[6:53] cigarette again never know tobacco
[6:55] products again but right there that boys
[6:57] blessed be the name of the Lord that
[6:59] same voice told me I was going to be
[7:01] healed I believe I'm Healed that same
[7:03] voice came to me when I was sitting
[7:05] there in my living room when the doctor
[7:06] told me I need to get checked for sleep
[7:08] apnea he said and I was sitting there
[7:10] about two weeks later he said that same
[7:11] boy said Do you believe the same I said
[7:13] man I need to go get checked out I guess
[7:15] he said you believe that same God healed
[7:16] Jay Ordo heal your sleep apne I do
[7:18] blessed be the name of the Lord was
[7:21] healed and then then that same voice
[7:23] when I had a buddy of mine coming up
[7:25] just a little bit ago I forgot about
[7:26] that but uh
[7:28] uh a buddy of mine struggling with drugs
[7:31] and stuff and I said why don't we just
[7:32] we can get together create an atmosphere
[7:34] you know I told you all that testimony
[7:36] and he ended up flaking on me but the
[7:38] Lord came and said what about me and you
[7:41] and I said okay let's go you know and we
[7:43] did it and by God's grace they told me
[7:45] I'd never be medication free and I'm
[7:46] like 9 10 months now completely
[7:48] medication free because the Lord God Is
[7:50] A Healer he is the same yesterday today
[7:53] and forever and I just love the Lord
[7:56] you know must be his name and I just
[7:59] don't believe there's anything that
[8:01] could hinder us you know and it was very
[8:03] discouraging because here this is what
[8:05] this is why I say it you know and God
[8:07] works all things together for the good
[8:09] and there's no retreat in God's Army
[8:10] we're only pressing forward I was very
[8:12] discouraged like thinking man what could
[8:15] have been
[8:15] the Lord come knocking like that what in
[8:18] the world you never know man you could
[8:19] broke out speaking in tongues you could
[8:21] have just had and you know I've been
[8:23] praying for just a closer walk with thee
[8:24] Oh Lord and who knows what could have
[8:27] happened and that's the moral of the
[8:29] story is what if he comes knocking today
[8:31] don't leave here thinking what could
[8:33] have happened
[8:34] should have happened you know he's here
[8:36] to set you free he's here to heal your
[8:38] body he's healed to give you a Revival
[8:40] no matter what you have need of he's
[8:42] here so we came to Worship the Lord and
[8:45] spirit and truth and magnify his great
[8:46] name because he's worthy to be praised
[8:48] you know and uh I guess we all
[8:52] we're gonna sing a special we're gonna
[8:53] have any other magician during my solo
[8:55] and this whole deal
[8:57] y'all want the musicians y'all want to
[8:59] come and play with me
[9:01] we're gonna have some fun look I just
[9:03] seen uh they've done a song service out
[9:05] there brother Donnie's you know boy got
[9:07] the scene they was singing and got the
[9:08] sharing and stuff and this and that and
[9:10] he's like you know he said uh he said
[9:12] can we we start church early tomorrow he
[9:14] said I love this I don't want to leave
[9:16] you know what would come for we ain't no
[9:18] hurry or we can't even magnify the King
[9:20] of Kings he's worthy to be praised don't
[9:23] need to get you fired up

[9:40] Worship up and then I'm gonna try to I'm
[9:43] not I'm not a singer so anybody out here
[9:45] that wasn't here before I didn't said I
[9:46] ain't no singer when I got out of the
[9:48] hospital uh I gave up Instagram and all
[9:50] that and started picking a little bit
[9:52] and all I said wouldn't make a Joyful
[9:53] Noise and if I can get up here you know
[9:55] anybody can I've been telling Tammy you
[9:58] know he's worthy to be praised we can
[10:00] take all these fears I thought you know

[10:03] everybody that's nervous and scared we
[10:06] can smash all that well get up here at
[10:07] the same time because then guess what we
[10:09] ain't got nothing to be scared about no

[1:26:49] he gave you a hug
[1:26:51] he said even though you made a mistake I
[1:26:53] didn't change who you are you're still

[1:27:52] the relative improved said 23 years this
[1:27:54] guy's sit in a firehouse and he worked
[1:27:56] in the fire he's been 20 years he said

[1:28:40] you saying that our prayers aren't heard
[1:28:42] but I believe there's coming for fruits
[1:28:44] in the body of Jesus Christ of particles
[1:28:47] coming on
[1:28:54] the threefold purpose of God brother
[1:28:57] remember preaches in Christ the Mr God
[1:28:59] goes his first Express himself
[1:29:00] completely in Christ second to have
[1:29:02] preeminence
[1:29:04] by this in his church will his body the
[1:29:07] bride till he could have the preeminence
[1:29:09] Express himself through them I mean
[1:29:13] what's God to express himself there's
[1:29:15] then you let this word have preeminence
[1:29:18] in your life
[1:29:19] Let It Be The Lord of your life
[1:29:25] I know I can't brother man that's right
[1:29:28] you can't but he can't

[1:30:25] I'll let that's it
[1:30:30] you still love me I'm still your buddy
[1:30:34] I'm an evangelist I just say it like it
[1:30:35] is
[1:30:38] no
[1:30:45] if the spirit of God is speaking to your
[1:30:47] heart
[1:30:49] you know what he's doing he's calling
[1:30:51] you into your place
[1:30:52] you've grown stale just get a little
[1:30:55] closer to the fire
[1:30:56] gotten too busy you ain't had time
[1:31:01] get a little closer yeah
[1:31:04] you watch God give you strength to do
[1:31:06] all things
[1:31:16] I was thinking I was riding down the
[1:31:17] road the other day it's been a year and
[1:31:18] a half ago so I went the other day it
[1:31:20] was the other day but it's long days
[1:31:21] away
[1:31:23] remember I've said this quote it just
[1:31:24] struck me I was listening to this on the
[1:31:25] way to church hey you know what when you
[1:31:27] get in your car you can invite Jesus to
[1:31:29] come
[1:31:31] some of you drive a lot
[1:31:34] press play
[1:31:36] that's where I agree with it totally it
[1:31:39] doesn't take the place to the pulpit
[1:31:40] ever
[1:31:45] proven by the Bible
[1:31:48] the prophet's quotebook
[1:31:50] plain and simple
[1:31:52] I want to argue that point
[1:31:54] but God will come anywhere you invite
[1:31:57] him
[1:31:58] maybe you work at a factory and your job
[1:32:01] is to move this part from there to there
[1:32:03] and it's loud and obnoxious there's a
[1:32:05] lot of things going on aren't you
[1:32:07] thankful for your folks
[1:32:09] plug the world out and begin to talk to
[1:32:11] the Lord
[1:32:15] he watched God come down and begin
[1:32:16] fellowship with you
[1:32:18] he wants to fellowship with you
[1:32:21] that's a reason he went to the cross
[1:32:25] you know I was going down the road and I
[1:32:26] remember him said this he says great
[1:32:27] major events happens inhibit before it
[1:32:29] happens on the earth he reflects himself
[1:32:31] in other words before Messiah came into
[1:32:34] into a place where his ministry would
[1:32:36] start they'll come forth a star out of
[1:32:38] heaven
[1:32:39] you know his brother may have said this
[1:32:40] and immediately struck me the cloud
[1:32:43] the cloud
[1:32:50] what was the picture of the cloud I'm
[1:32:52] gonna give it to you I should have gave
[1:32:53] it to them in the back so you can see it
[1:32:54] better but I'll show you guys know what
[1:32:55] the cloud picture is we're messaging
[1:32:57] believers
[1:33:02] that was a cloud right
[1:33:04] it was Cloud a major event happened in
[1:33:06] the heavens
[1:33:08] the world didn't see it and not the same
[1:33:10] as Jesus
[1:33:12] the world didn't see it
[1:33:15] but it came forth that you and I
[1:33:16] wouldn't understand something
[1:33:20] oh
[1:33:24] first of all
[1:33:26] let me get it right you have to look at
[1:33:28] it the right way
[1:33:30] listen saints of God this was the very
[1:33:33] what what is that picture of is that a
[1:33:34] picture of brother Brian
[1:33:36] who's that the image of
[1:33:42] it was the head
[1:33:44] coming to the body
[1:33:45] this would happen in the heavens before
[1:33:47] brother Brandon preached the seals what
[1:33:49] was it it was the mind of God Simplicity
[1:33:52] I'm a simple preacher I can believe this
[1:33:55] because I can see it Hallelujah
[1:33:58] all right what was it it was what's in
[1:34:01] the head the vision
[1:34:02] what's in the head the mouse Oh Glory
[1:34:05] what's in the head not your head
[1:34:07] this is the head of Christ
[1:34:11] so as I begin to think of that
[1:34:14] I'm not going to question this message
[1:34:15] any longer I'm not going to try to
[1:34:18] figure it out I'm just going to believe
[1:34:19] it I'm just going to say where the
[1:34:20] Prophet said I'm looking forward with it
[1:34:22] why because if God would come and
[1:34:24] vindicate it if God would come from the
[1:34:26] heavens and put his seal of approval but
[1:34:28] the man who would say that cloud did not
[1:34:30] come for me it came to show that the
[1:34:32] message is true
[1:34:34] listen this message must bring us into
[1:34:37] our place he said come on earn my people
[1:34:40] it was my people that would see the mind
[1:34:43] of God and walk in the Liberty that God
[1:34:46] gave him
[1:34:52] take this I believe it was a while
[1:34:55] before he even saw it himself
[1:34:57] he said you better turn it
[1:34:58] to the right
[1:35:00] let's just say to God look at this
[1:35:02] message the right way
[1:35:05] look at this message the right way this
[1:35:08] message is the very image of Jesus
[1:35:13] Christ
[1:35:17] it's not a man's idea this was not even
[1:35:19] brother branham's message
[1:35:22] when he stepped up there on both my rock
[1:35:24] and he raised his hand what was it that
[1:35:26] came into his hand Hallelujah it was not
[1:35:29] from the brand of Sword it was the
[1:35:31] king's sword what was the message for
[1:35:33] quick question the message quit looking
[1:35:36] at it the wrong way look at it say it's
[1:35:38] right it's right it's for me it's my
[1:35:41] headship it's the word of God to me
[1:35:47] it'll bring you into an anointing it'll
[1:35:50] bring you into a deeper relationship
[1:35:51] with the Lord Jesus Christ but I don't
[1:35:54] understand it all amen I don't either
[1:36:00] what kind of preacher is he
[1:36:01] and everything well
[1:36:03] everyone understands everything I
[1:36:05] guarantee he's false
[1:36:08] particulated
[1:36:13] Hallelujah I don't understand everything
[1:36:15] that's why God didn't base it on your
[1:36:17] understanding he said if thou can't
[1:36:19] believe we walk by what our
[1:36:21] understanding our sight no we walk by
[1:36:24] faith and as you continue to walk the
[1:36:27] light goes out in front of you and the
[1:36:28] light goes out in front of you and for
[1:36:30] the next step Oh Glory for the next step
[1:36:33] he gives you the light to take the next
[1:36:34] step and we're walking by faith and one
[1:36:37] of these days we're gonna be like Enoch
[1:36:38] that next step's not going to be
[1:36:39] Earthbound any longer that next step's
[1:36:42] gonna take us on the glory why because
[1:36:44] I'm not following my mind I'm not
[1:36:45] looking at my ideas I'm not looking at
[1:36:47] my passions I did I look into the mind
[1:36:49] of Jesus Christ
[1:36:53] what is the Mind reveal it revealed
[1:36:55] where you came from it reveal where
[1:36:57] you're going he puts you as a
[1:36:59] predestinated seat before the foundation
[1:37:01] of the world coming under the light of
[1:37:03] Jesus Christ in this hour it becomes
[1:37:04] quicker that now you manifest the word
[1:37:07] for your day
[1:37:09] [Music]
[1:37:13] and you guys gonna pull me to death
[1:37:15] don't pull out

[1:37:20] you love him this morning
[1:37:26] so they're looking at the wrong angle
[1:37:28] you've got to look at the right angle
[1:37:29] the only Lord God can reveal it which is
[1:37:32] the right angle turn it to the right and
[1:37:35] look at it there he is
[1:37:38] listen brother man I'm going to teach us
[1:37:40] he said if you don't see Jesus in every
[1:37:42] scripture read it again
[1:37:45] listen and you see some man's idea
[1:37:47] that's all right look at it again Jesus
[1:37:49] is right there in the midst of it
[1:37:51] how do you know that he said he would be
[1:37:53] he said behold I walk in the midst of
[1:37:56] the seven golden candle sits and I'm
[1:37:58] here to tell you he's still walking he's
[1:38:00] still the same he's still in action what

[1:38:06] God my God's here today my God's here to
[1:38:10] take you from just like you of the
[1:38:12] darkness of Doubt of the fear of this
[1:38:14] world into a glorious relationship

[1:38:23] Barbara
[1:38:29] Hallelujah subjection Oh my he said that
[1:38:33] word
[1:38:34] subjection husbands
[1:38:38] you have your place right
[1:38:40] wives
[1:38:42] huh what
[1:38:45] Amen brother Tom no wife should
[1:38:48] have your place
[1:38:49] my brother man would also say to your
[1:38:51] husbands
[1:38:52] you live such a life
[1:38:55] that your wife would want to be in
[1:38:56] subjection to you
[1:38:58] why are you gonna say that brother Matt
[1:39:02] let's get a balance
[1:39:04] you live such a life that she say honey
[1:39:07] what do you think
[1:39:08] you've been praying about this have you
[1:39:10] no but I will I'll let you know
[1:39:15] sorry we do live in a human body
[1:39:18] we're not perfect
[1:39:19] [Music]
[1:39:23] they all pay for me then
[1:39:28] by the way to say this is this doesn't
[1:39:30] think you man's field in 1965. this is a
[1:39:32] mystery how that women should be in
[1:39:34] respect to their husbands even the
[1:39:35] second place now let me drop down just
[1:39:37] like why does a woman every time she
[1:39:38] gets married put a veil over her face
[1:39:40] she's coming to her husband the head
[1:39:43] just so like Rebecca did she put a bail
[1:39:46] over her face to meet Isaac she's no
[1:39:48] more head Isaac's her head and the
[1:39:50] church ought to be so submissive to the
[1:39:54] word of God
[1:39:56] yeah all right where's the word of God
[1:39:59] come from
[1:40:04] now they don't give brother Thomas the
[1:40:05] right to preach anything he wants
[1:40:08] because who's our head
[1:40:12] hope it's okay buddy
[1:40:16] when you walk into those doors
[1:40:19] absolutely to expect I know complacency
[1:40:22] you talked about it
[1:40:24] you're so complacent well it's just
[1:40:26] another Wednesday night
[1:40:29] Sunday morning
[1:40:30] let me go do my duty pay my ties and
[1:40:34] you've lost something somewhere
[1:40:36] [Applause]
[1:40:37] you lost your first love
[1:40:40] I'm not trying to be mean
[1:40:43] Revelation comes in all kinds of ways it
[1:40:46] came to David thou art thy man that man
[1:40:50] but what did David do
[1:40:53] he came into his place
[1:40:55] submitted himself man that's good he
[1:40:57] submitted himself to the word of God
[1:41:00] come on now if you're wrong this morning
[1:41:03] I know I'm always wrong
[1:41:08] foreign

[1:41:19] she takes no thought for herself she has
[1:41:22] no head Christ is her head not somebody
[1:41:25] ecclesiastial Bunch but Christ is her
[1:41:28] head the word and the Word was made
[1:41:30] flesh into one Among Us and I believe
[1:41:31] the word is being made flesh and
[1:41:33] dwelling Among Us Again Hallelujah why
[1:41:36] because the body of Jesus Christ is
[1:41:38] coming to a uniting town and the head is
[1:41:41] coming to the body and when it comes
[1:41:43] down there's a greater power that comes
[1:41:45] with it that now you can speak to your
[1:41:47] Mountain

[1:42:47] I'd better have a fit back everybody as
[1:42:50] the eagle serves his nest what is the
[1:42:52] eagle doing
[1:42:53] trying to get them to feel uncomfortable
[1:42:55] how many felt real comfortable with
[1:42:57] covered foreign
[1:43:03] good air not air I just touched
[1:43:08] never thought of it
[1:43:10] I don't sleep with the covers on my head

[1:44:09] but you see Satan be made manifesting
[1:44:12] people getting in total possession of of
[1:44:14] sin of Satan but if there's people
[1:44:16] getting in total possession of Satan
[1:44:18] then there ought to be people getting
[1:44:19] total possession of the Holy Ghost and
[1:44:21] now they can stand at the end time
[1:44:22] that's not who I am that's not where I'm

[1:45:51] go be a Trapper
[1:45:53] there'll be a guide
[1:45:54] that's where he wanted to be
[1:45:58] Jesus left all this
[1:46:03] he left all of Heaven
[1:46:05] that at this very moment you could come
[1:46:07] into your place he became me
[1:46:11] that I through him might become him
[1:46:17] let me finish
[1:46:23] two more two more things that will stop
[1:46:25] Hebrews chapter six and one it says let
[1:46:27] us go on unto perfection
[1:46:31] that word of perfection is sometimes oh
[1:46:33] my goodness he's going to talk on
[1:46:34] purpose there's no way I can be perfect
[1:46:36] yes there is
[1:46:40] he provided a lamp
[1:46:43] by the blood of an innocent one there's
[1:46:46] a Perfection when you go look at that
[1:46:48] word you know what that word means
[1:46:49] maturity
[1:46:54] we still got a lot of babies in their
[1:46:56] message pews
[1:47:02] up in there
[1:47:04] we're still out of babies complaining
[1:47:06] and whining because it's getting hard
[1:47:09] but who's in control of this
[1:47:13] if he brought you there
[1:47:14] he brought you there for a purpose
[1:47:17] if he sends you into a valley that means
[1:47:20] you're coming out of the valley a
[1:47:21] different person you know where most
[1:47:23] your growth is done
[1:47:25] on the mountain brother Matt no
[1:47:27] naturally you go on the mountains you
[1:47:29] get up there real high how much green
[1:47:31] stuff is there

[1:47:34] there's a tree line
[1:47:36] you know that tree line
[1:47:38] no growth but it's down in that Valley
[1:47:42] I don't know where you're at
[1:47:44] but God's telling you I'm in control
[1:47:48] I know what this Valley is doing to you
[1:47:51] I know what it's doing to you you know
[1:47:53] what it's doing how are you matured how

[1:47:57] suffering
[1:48:01] maybe you won't raise your hand how may
[1:48:03] you say oh God I'm suffering right now
[1:48:06] seems like the worst time I've ever had
[1:48:08] my
[1:48:10] God will bring suffering in many
[1:48:12] different ways
[1:48:14] but it's really to work on your
[1:48:16] character
[1:48:17] and to let you know you have the ability
[1:48:19] to stand in that mountain and say
[1:48:22] mountain in the name of Jesus Christ be
[1:48:26] removed into the sea I believe the word
[1:48:29] I believe what God says I will not
[1:48:32] accept doubt I will not accept fear I
[1:48:34] accept the word of God and even if
[1:48:36] you're standing there tomorrow I'm going
[1:48:38] to keep speaking to you and little by
[1:48:39] little brother I'm saying a little sad
[1:48:41] and the Brain would leave a little sat

[1:48:44] movement but saints of God we should see
[1:48:46] maturity in our life there needs to be
[1:48:49] growing in our life I don't care how
[1:48:51] long you've been in this message you
[1:48:52] need to be growing if you're on the face
[1:48:54] of the Earth your character needs to be
[1:48:57] growing
[1:48:59] Embrace that trial
[1:49:01] Embrace that suffering man I'll tell you
[1:49:04] what it gives you a whole different
[1:49:05] aspect instead of getting out of it

[1:49:11] one more thing
[1:49:13] Hallelujah

[1:51:11] wants it well glory to God you you
[1:51:14] whatever you want I want it
[1:51:17] I'll take the saith the Lord
[1:51:28] Hebrews chapter Ephesians chapter 4
[1:51:29] talks about the fivefold ministry he
[1:51:31] said until we all
[1:51:33] come into our place
[1:51:35] the statue of a perfect man
[1:51:39] you know why they're against my full
[1:51:40] ministry because the devil is afraid
[1:51:43] the bride will actually recognize who
[1:51:45] she is
[1:51:46] and once you recognize who she is he
[1:51:49] knows there's no devil in hell there's
[1:51:51] nothing that he can do and he's scared
[1:51:54] to death and he's trying to hold you
[1:51:55] back he's trying to keep you in a place
[1:51:57] that he's got you beat down he takes
[1:51:59] your sins he takes your thoughts and he
[1:52:01] begins to world you listen he's been
[1:52:02] doing it for many many years but God's
[1:52:04] so fit to sit you in this age that you
[1:52:06] can overcome everything of the devil he

[2:21:25] amen
[2:21:32] verse 23 Paul says for I have received
[2:21:34] of the Lord that which also I delivered
[2:21:36] unto you that the Lord Jesus same night
[2:21:38] in which he was betrayed took bread and
[2:21:41] when he had given thanks he break it and
[2:21:43] said take eat this is my body which is
[2:21:45] broken for you this do in remembrance of
[2:21:48] me after the same manner also he took
[2:21:51] the cup and when he heads up saying this
[2:21:53] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[2:21:55] this New Year is off the street drink it
[2:21:58] in remembrance of me for as often as he
[2:22:01] eat this bread and drink of his cup of
[2:22:02] the Lord
[2:22:04] you do show the Lord's death until he
[2:22:06] come whoever whosoever shall eat of this
[2:22:08] bread and drink of this cup of the Lord
[2:22:10] unworthy they shall be guilty of the
[2:22:12] body and blood of the Lord but let the
[2:22:14] man examine himself and so let him eat
[2:22:16] of that bread and drink of that cup for
[2:22:18] he that he didn't drink a damnation to
[2:22:20] him eat and drinketh unworthily eat it
[2:22:24] and drink a damnation to himself not
[2:22:26] Discerning the Lord's body and for this
[2:22:29] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[2:22:31] and many sleep for if we judge ourselves
[2:22:33] we should not be judged but when we are
[2:22:36] judged we are chasing of the Lord that
[2:22:38] we should not be condemned with the
[2:22:39] world whoever my brethren when you come
[2:22:41] together to eat Terry one for another
[2:22:43] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[2:22:45] home that you come not together unto
[2:22:48] condemnation and the rest will I said in
[2:22:50] order when I come will have award a
[2:22:53] moment of silence so that you can judge
[2:22:54] yourself and make sure that you confess
[2:22:56] anything that you've done wrong or
[2:22:58] whatever make everything right so that
[2:23:00] you don't come to the Lord's table

[2:33:28] read the scripture for foot washing this
[2:33:30] morning
[2:33:30] in Saint John the 13th chapter
[2:33:37] verse 1 says now before the Feast of the
[2:33:40] Passover when Jesus knew that his hour
[2:33:41] was come
[2:33:43] that he should be part out of this world
[2:33:45] having loved
[2:33:47] out of this world unto the father having
[2:33:49] loved his own which were in the world he
[2:33:52] loved them unto the end and supper being
[2:33:54] ended the devil having now put into the
[2:33:56] heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's son to
[2:33:59] betray him Jesus knowing that the father
[2:34:01] had given all things into his hands that
[2:34:05] he was come from God and went to God he
[2:34:08] rises from supper and laid inside his
[2:34:09] garments and took a towel and girded
[2:34:11] himself after that he walked pour with
[2:34:13] water into a basin and began to watch
[2:34:15] the disciples feet and to wipe them with
[2:34:18] the towel wherewith he was girded
[2:34:21] then cometh either Simon Peter and Peter
[2:34:24] saith unto him Lord the Salvage my feet
[2:34:27] Jesus answers and said unto him I what I
[2:34:30] do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt
[2:34:32] know Hereafter Peter saith unto him thou
[2:34:35] shall never wash my feet
[2:34:36] Jesus answers him if I watched he not
[2:34:39] thou has no part with me
[2:34:42] Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my
[2:34:44] feet only but also my hands in my head
[2:34:46] Jesus saith to him he that is washed
[2:34:49] need is not saved and washed his feet
[2:34:50] but he's clean every wit and you are
[2:34:53] clean but not all for he knew who should
[2:34:55] betray him therefore said he you are not
[2:34:58] all clean so after that he had washed
[2:35:00] her feet and had taken his garments and
[2:35:02] was set down again he said unto them
[2:35:03] know you what I have done to you you
[2:35:06] call me master and Lord and you say well
[2:35:07] for so I am if I've been your lord in
[2:35:10] mass or have washed your feet you also
[2:35:12] ought to wash one another's feet for I
[2:35:14] have given you an example that you
[2:35:15] should do as I have done unto you verily
[2:35:18] verily I say unto you the servant is not
[2:35:20] created and he's Lord neither he that is
[2:35:22] sent greater than he that sent him if
