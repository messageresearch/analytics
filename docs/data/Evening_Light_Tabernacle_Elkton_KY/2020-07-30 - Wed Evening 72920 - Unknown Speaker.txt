TRANSCRIPT
========================================
able brother thomas is not capable i believe god's able to speak to our hearts don't you let's sing that little courses but tom comes fill my cup lord [Music] amen [Applause] [Music] [Music] heaven will feed me [Music] once again [Music] [Music] of [Music] feeling [Applause] [Music] i [Music] [Applause] my soul bread of heaven feed me [Music] amen praise the lord amen one verse one one part of that song i don't quite understand amen and that is until i want no more amen how many of you ever got to place you didn't want no more and i can't really say that amen but i think it expresses that we appreciate amy and the lord's goodness thank you musicians amen praise the lord good to be in the house of the lord amen good to see everybody our wednesday night crowd anyway everybody out tonight so praise the lord i guess good to see everybody amen god is good isn't he amen felt a little better out there a little more bearable amen i thought anyway i wasn't in the woods or anything but no not that humidity i know we mowed we waited till about noon yesterday to come to church mow the grass because i like it dry otherwise it clumps up but at noon it was still just wet as you know ever so anyway so yeah the humidity but it does cause the grass to grow so that's all right amen praise the lord but god is good anyway amen i think the weather's got it cooling down just a little bit here the next few weeks so i think it'll be nice if it's as good as what they say anyway anytime you got mid mid 80s you're not too bad off amen praise the lord well i'm sorry to hear about that amen different ones getting that corona i don't know just how bad it is how bad people are have it you know but um you know you are starting to hear uh more of people having it i guess so anyway i think they're talking about it peaking here sometime maybe far too awful long amen the whole world's sick isn't it amen the whole world is sick i think it's certainly a uh applicable i guess spiritually also amen certainly is a sick world we're living in so but we're thankful for the lord how many thanks for the lord jesus christ amen all right but further without further ado let's just bow our heads lord jesus we come before you thanking you once again that we can assemble ourselves together in your name knowing lord jesus that here you are in our midst lord jesus that you're with us leading us and guiding us father and lord jesus your our comfort your our peace and we just thank you so much for all that you are and all that you mean to us lord and as we try to just speak on that tonight for a little bit about what you are how great you are and just what it is that you mean to us and how much you mean to us lord let me just pray father you would take to have the service and take the preeminence and every part of it lord bless the reading of the word lord meditation of our heart we just ask god you'll bless our assembling together and each one that has made an effort to come out on this wednesday night lord this midweek service and we also pray for those streaming lord we ask god you'd be with them in a special way maybe they receive a blessing lord jesus from your word lord tonight we ask these blessings and favors in your name the lord jesus christ amen and amen to turn your bibles if you will to saint john saint john 14. amen how many likes to get together and talk about jesus i was thinking that song let's talk about jesus amen that's what we're going to do tonight let's just talk about jesus amen it's always good to talk about the lord saint john 14 1-6 let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house or many mansions and if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there you may be also and whether i go you know and the way you know thomas said unto him lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me may god it is blessings to the reading of the word amen i want to speak on the waymaker the waymaker tonight amen and so we want to this is going to be really like i said earlier we want to just talk a little bit about the attributes of god how many knows that god has attributes amen and an attribute from the best that i can understand is it's what a person is and what is in a person amen and so an attribute is something that would be displayed you know something that comes out of a person something that's manifested because it's in a person i think brother branham made it pretty uh clear in the way that he explained it that in him was to be father and that right so he had an attribute of being a father and but he didn't have any children so he couldn't be a father right you have to have a have to be have children to have a father and i just look at the natural for just a minute looking at myself or you could probably see yourself as this perhaps at least some of these things would be something that you are you know and one of my attributes would be that i'm a son all right i'm a son not my father right so i have children so i'm a father that's an attribute of me and a grandfather because i have grandchildren and then i also have a husband and i'm a brother all right i'm an uncle i'm a cousin i'm a friend all right and so you know if ever i perhaps save somebody's life they would say man you're my savior and that right if i fought in great battles like napoleon what you know you might be a warrior i'm not a fighter i'm not i'm not considered a warrior in that way but yet i am a warrior in the battle that is in the lord is that right and so forth and then perhaps a deliverer if you was to help somebody out of a hole and save them you would be at their deliverer so though all of those attributes is in us also how many knows that amen but um so that's what god is god is we know we're an amateur god he believes we're an amateur god and in the life in the world that we're living in we find that people are certainly glorifying the attributes that they have and they're right they have they're glorifying that but you know tonight we want to glorify god amen i believe that as we get older amen we realize that there's really less things in this world that perhaps impresses us as much as what it used to amen it doesn't mean as much to us anymore amen and as i as i get older i begin and you know when i preach this maybe over and over again but i begin to look at god and i get more impressed with god and what he is am right and the attributes of what god is amen what what he is and that's what we want to talk about tonight is one of his attributes all right well this is one of the attributes and this is of course just one you know and it but he has many he has so many i believe one place the bible talks about it on him was many crowns why because he's the king of kings he's lord of lords he's he's so much he's he has so many things that he is what we would call the best at there's nobody does it better than him amen i believe brother brennan one time whenever uh they had a healing service the one night and different ones got healed and so forth and then the next day they put that flyer out you know that brother branham was false and he was the fbi was going to expose him for being simon the sorcerer or whatever you know this all this rigamarole in it had everybody tell her up because they put them flyers on everybody can you imagine the riffraff that would that cause you know and those girls i guess some girls came to him you know that got healed or whatever they said brother brandon we don't know what to do we don't know what to do y'all remember that story and uh so he says you know last night sisters you saw jesus as a healer come to come to church tonight tonight you're going to see him as a warrior oh my you're going to see him fight a battle all right and y'all remember brother brown come up he says now i understand that the fbi is going to expose me tonight so i say to them if the fbi i'm not sure if it was exact words but something to the effect if i remember hearing it right he said so mr fbi man come on down now and expose me something to that extent so you can imagine the congregation and that right and how quiet they were and uh oh my everybody's at their edge there see what's happening here what's going to go on here you know and he says you know it isn't the fbi at all but what he says but it's nothing but a couple backslid preachers that have put this together you know they have put this together and put this out to cause disruption and the one of them sitting up there in the balcony up there with the white suit on the other one's sitting right over there that was jesus doing the battle right he knew exactly who it was because brother branham god would reveal to him exactly what it was and them guys coward and hello he coward found the door got out of there you know what it is that's what he said they did and then that was jesus fighting as a warrior now you know that's part of the reason brother brennan when he was here he he always he always said can anybody any time any place tell me come show me where when the holy spirit spoke through him that that was ever wrong one time i challenge you to come to me and tell me am i right how many knows that he was never challenged oh brother brandon was going to be challenged at one time because they were going to challenge him on the serpent see the waterhead those 70 preachers up there right but come to find out you know he had brother batman told him about not having the room in this side of the other they're not going to have the room and and so forth and there because the holy spirit warned him that there's a trap laid for him they did challenge him back in the day you know but he even challenged them back and says again this was a warrior situation and he says you know come on up now and anyone that wants to dispute the water baptism or the serpent seed is to come stand by my side now the angel i told brother brandon he says i will be by your right side i will be by your side go ahead that's the one time that the brother of anthem had the right and the permission from god to challenge him because most of the time in a dispute or a debate he didn't know part of it isn't that right if both word took it for him one time he said i'll take the challenge but but the band says i don't believe in this beating over this one time the angels told him yeah go ahead you go ahead and you go up there i'll be by your side and brother manager he said now come up here with your bible and stand by my side later on he says they're probably struck that angel would have killed him because they'd been standing right there by that angel let me tell you something people started walking up these steps and fall over down back a tobling he'd be saying okay anyone else huh would anybody else bring the bible up here welcome to it huh but let you know but they didn't but the mom says they were smarter than i thought they were because they didn't even come up and challenge it because that man that that friend of his that he had told that he would not get the room and there would be a certain kind of person sitting over here a certain kind of person sitting over here certain time person sitting over here when he got up he says y'all might want to do this with brother he says but he told me yesterday that man was going to sit there he told me yesterday that man was going to sit there he told me yeah that man was going to sit there and that'd be enough just can't dare anybody that right i'd back off too and so they did but that's just the way that god works and amen i mean he's glad to know that that's what you are following you're following the living god that the same god that was with israel over in the red sea and so forth that fought against pharaoh that father that david that fought against that goliath that very same god is the one you and i are following and serving this morning this evening amen how many is glad for a god that has attributes that takes care of things praise the lord but anyway so you know that then god says you know he always you know nothing and the point that i was wanting to try to get to that i didn't even get to yet but you know while he was alive sure he got challenged sure people said stuff but you know look at what people are doing today huh they're saying all kinds of stuff like he's a false prophet like this wasn't right over here right over there this out of the other at least don't mind you know why did you you know he was probably wasn't even here whenever he was here but they don't have that kind of courage hey man they did you know oh my it's just it's terrible i'd be scared for them if they were here amen i'm scared for them now you know that it's not going to be a good thing when they stand before god while he was living nobody said and remember remember how that god told moses he says you know that nothing's going to stand in your way and then when joshua took over the ministry he told joshua too he says nobody is going to be able to stand in your way and that brother bannon was told that same thing there ain't nothing going to be standing in your way nothing's going to stop you nothing's going to stand in your way of of going on because god is with you that's why the witch doctors over germany and different places that they would have the actual tent he was in coming up with wind and a storm that they brought up and brewed up and they were gonna blow it away this side of the other and the prophet would speak and calm the storm is that right why because those angels were there to make it right to make it good amen nothing was going to stand in this way praise be to god tonight praise the lord i aren't you glad tonight to know that you're serving the living god praise be to god now isn't it something in our scene here how that jesus was there and he was in the middle of jake john there and he got to talking about them talking to them and telling them they know that in my father's there's many mansions and if it were not so i would have told you but i'm going to go and i'm going to prepare a place for you let it be a piece a lot of message on preparedness and how to uh how to god before the foundation of the world notice even now this just comes to mind out of jesus said you know on the judgment day he says oh sheep on the right side and so forth he says enter into the joint of the lord that was prepared for you from the foundation of the world how many believes that amen that kingdom over there in heaven over there it has been prepared for you it is ready for you it is waiting for you god has prepared it already now i want to talk about jesus providing him to making a way the main thing we want to try to focus on if i possibly can and then it's the uh the the how did god always makes a way i listened to other man today on god making away men many different messages he spoke on but the one thing that stand out for me is that everything that we have need of no matter what it is god makes a way for it how many thankful for that i was sitting back there in my study and i just got you know got the writing down and then it says you know there is no question that he hasn't got the answer for there is no problem that he doesn't have the solution for why we ought to be running around the building right about now huh no matter think about you know how many questions go through our mind you know how many questions there is in the world sure there's a lot of questions but there's not one that he don't have the answer for [Music] i want to back up this a little bit because i believe that god is infallible talk about jesus is that all right that he's perfect all right so that just automatically almost is more than my fuse box can handle it wants to flip a breaker because it's so big huh to think that god cannot ever make a mistake i was thinking you know what if somebody would claim hey you know right here i can show you where he messed up or where he didn't hold and keep his word if you found one fault in god wouldn't that be terrible because that's making fallible just one isn't that right just one mistake just one word unfulfilled would make him fallible he's not he is infallible aren't you glad to serve a god like that oh my if he says something if his word says something it absolutely has to come to pass let me say something else if he thinks something huh if he thinks something it has to come to pass do you realize that if he didn't think of you being in heaven you're never going to be there why because he knew where you would be is that right he knows whether you'll be there or down yonder and if he thought of you up there all right then that's where you're gonna be period too much you're not right to think about it there ain't no way probably gotta tell you it's impossible for you not to make it you can no more pass away than god can pass away because his thoughts are eternal amen praise be the god oh my when i got to thinking about this and meditating on this i just about had me a jubilee oh my just think about it isn't it something that there's something in this world that you can meditate upon that can actually just get you to almost have a running fit and i don't know hardly anything in the world except this for sure this is the one thing that you can think about that you can meditate about amen you know what i did this week i tried to practice what i preached you know and i talked about how that we can get so busy with the things of the world that don't bring us joy am i right so busy with it until it brings a weight upon us and it actually can bring depression because the more you worry about stuff the more depressed you can get the more weight down you can get and i'm thinking about this should be taken care of and that should be taken care of and i could go do this and i said no thomas you're not doing it i had to make myself stay before the lord because i remember what the prophet said he says the minister shouldn't be so busy out there he has to have his quiet time he has to have that quiet time with the lord if he expects god to use him that he better have somebody said no no that don't need to be done i need to keep my mind on here why because you get so busy until you can't concentrate on the lord and i want to tell you something folks i don't care if you're laying in your bed at night think about the lord before you go to sleep as long as you can when you wake up they lay there an extra 15 minutes just to think about the lord it'll actually do you good david talked about meditating to him and the night watches and so forth while i'm leaping on the bed amen while i'm getting up wherever they're thinking about him it'll actually change your demeanor it'll change your atmosphere your wife will like you better your husband will like you better because you'll have a better attitude if you've been basking in the presence of god that's where the problem is if we don't drink the medicine that's inside the doctor's office as we sit on the doorstep and boohoo about not feeling good let me say it again because the prophet did he says you know they're not he described it that way that that's where the problem is is that people you know the solution is there it's right inside of the office there but they will sit on the doctor's doorstep and they will not go inside and take the medicine and they will actually die at the doctor's doorstep how many believe that this is the doctor this is dr jesus and he'll come to his door but they don't want to go in and get the things that he has to walk he's going to give them they still want a little bit of their own way and they will die right outside of the door how many of these doors open whosoever will let him come welcome hello it ain't got no call us by appointment just stay in your car and we will give you give us a call and we'll come out and help you hello how many is tired of that stuff i like to go and talk to a person you know but he's gotten that way no it's not like that it's come on in we got the medicine that'll cure your problem amen how many believe that all right and it's done me good lord just help me not to be too busy how many of us how many of you is with me you practice while i preach between now and sunday will you all right you practice a little bit taking more time the lord meditate on him let him reveal things give you fresh revelation get you a little revival going on how many wants of revival say lord i still need a revival i need a revival lord that's right well it's there amen praise be to god all right so we think about that and how that god has provided first of all the bible says this that without god there was not anything made that was made another scripture says that god has freely given us everything that he has made he has given us all things freely to enjoy which one of you parents if your child really wants something they'll get it for them now if you do it all the time you spoil them right but most of the time if you have a child and you really they really want something if you possibly can it makes them happy you're going to get it for them and that's the way our heavenly father is he knows he knew what you would want and so he made a way for you to have it think about it aaron's the seat that you're sitting on is it comfortable well god made it for you so you could enjoy your comfort everybody enjoy a comfortable seat yeah he made the cloth he made the material he made the wood he made everything we just put it together am i right all everything everything has been provided by him for us huh praise the lord air conditioning huh come on people it's hot out you ought to give the lord say thank you lord fair conditioning that's right think about it it was his goodness it's his grace i don't care what it is it all comes from him all good things come from god everything good everything bad comes from you know who we don't like him so much we don't talk about him around here too much other than we're rebuking him and kicking him out the door all the time that right yeah not those doors these doors that door that door that oh how many that's what's got to go out of god at the door of your heart get on out i am so depressed you got to get out devil i'm not wanting to be depressed anymore huh amen praise the lord but tonight we want to talk about the attribute of provider of providing a way and the waymaker i like that song they got out with he's a waymaker i mean at least he's a waymaker he's the way maker all right so he says listen there's no problem that he doesn't have the solution for wouldn't you love to say that tell the that to the white house there ain't no question that y'all got jesus can't answer there ain't no problem that you all got that jesus can't take care of huh there ain't nothing that he can't fix that's right praise be to god but what are they gonna do one place i really wanted to quote one i wanted to pull one quote out where brother braham says you know man just hates god's way humanity just hates god's way they don't like his way they don't want his way two two aspects i want to talk about with the help of the lord that is how that the lord always makes a way and the other one is people not accepting that way refusing that way just think about jesus here telling his disciples he says you know i go to prepare a place for you so there they were following their leader their leader was talking about leaving i'm not always going to be with y'all i'm going to leave but from now on he said you know the way all right you know what he said you know the way from now on where i go you know and the way you know thomas says lord we know not is that right straight up jesus you are so wrong huh that's what he said jesus just said you know where i'm going and you know the way thomas says nope we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way huh thomas knew it and didn't know it didn't new did he know i guess and jesus said what thomas i am the way you're looking at the way you've got the way with you i am the way follow me and i'll take you to that place and i'm going to make ready a place for you i guess one of the last things i want to talk about tonight now maybe go ahead and just speak it now but that is that even in death isn't that right how many believes god has a place he doesn't leave you hanging now this is also what i wanted to say one of the scariest most shakenest most horrible places that you'll ever come to in life okay is you come to places you'll have questions that you don't have an answer for you'll have a problem that you won't have a solution for how many knows those are bad places to be you'll accomplish you'll come to a problem that you don't know how to fix you don't know how to overcome huh that's those are bad places to be but i'm so thankful that the lord said that he always makes a way the lord hears the red prayers of the righteous and deliver them and believe that i want to tell you something else and we're probably at that place we'll we'll probably come to that place no doubt but that will come to a place brother brad that we've never been before let me say this i believe that we'll probably come to a place that we never expect it to be because we don't know exactly how this thing's going to wind up we got our preconceived ideas but brother baby says when you think you got it all figured out mark it down you probably got it wrong and can you imagine if things is little different than what we thought how upset we might be like well it's not supposed to go this way right i didn't expect this to happen can i just say what comes to mind we expect the democrats to bring on the mark of the priest huh maybe it'll be the republicans huh you never know which way it'll go because we both we know one thing they're both led by the devil isn't that right it could go sharp right it could go sharp left huh could go any which direction but this one thing we know god's going to fulfill these scriptures one way or the other but this one comfort that we have one comfort that we can have and that is that if we come to that place like where god loves to bring his people he likes to bring you to places you didn't expect to be because if you're expecting it ah no problem right but if you're not expecting it that's where the hard thing comes to have to face issues and things that you are not expecting and that you do not know how to handle huh an illustration of and i heard brother ramsey and god make it away he's talking about the three hebrew children he says you know if they had a scripture where it says you know they're going to throw god's children into the fiery furnace and god's going to deliver them brother baby says it would have been easy but they had no scripture that said that that would happen he just said they had this one thing he says we don't know if he will but we know that god is able but says that's what you got to do amen if you're ever going to get anything from god you have got to know that he is able to do it you got to listen to that in 62 he says you know it's not that we just have to hope for it or maybe god will do it now you can come and say god your word is said it i'm trusting and i'm accepting it i'm believing what you have said god that's how we can come to him now he says amen so perhaps not expected perhaps they never expect that to be thrown all the way into the furnace huh i think i really think this is a good warning for us both people that are here and people on on the internet a warning for us and that is that we may come to that place that we are not expecting that we're not aware of huh but the important thing is going to be is that we trust in the one that is promised to make your way always promised to make a way so the three hebrew children they didn't expect it but guess what you know it wasn't the flood that came it wasn't the angel of water that just brought in a gully washer and drowned that fire huh wasn't that at all no they actually got thrown into the midst of the fire right and i'd like for some scientists to tell me what in the world how a person can be in the fire that is white hot right how many knows what white coals are i mean why seven times hotter than normal and just walking around there the flames licking all over their body and not even singing one little air somebody said praise the lord how many believes that that god can actually put you in the middle of something that if you are surrendered and i want to say this amen that that's what god's looking for if you really want to see the power of god he god is looking for somebody that is surrendered to him that is yielded to him the three hebrew they were completely in the hands of god and god took care of them took the fire out of the flames he was the creator of the fire he knew exactly what chemicals to bring out of it to take the heat out of it and they could walk around in about 68 degree air conditioning huh that's right they didn't come out there if they had a little i don't know i don't wear no clone but whatever cologne a man wears or i guess it's clone right you don't want to wear a perfume perfume with a woman's but cologne come out there you still smell just like he went in shadrach meshach and abednego and not even what hair is since see in the middle of the way that you don't know how god's going to do it it don't matter how tall how complicated it is god will find a way god always makes a way how many believes that god made a way in the days of noah for people not to dawn he says go into the ark he'll be safe he made a way for him before he drowned everybody with the rain and the flood he warned them all and he actually made a way for him and not only made a way but begged them to come for 120 every year that goes by those tapes are the long-suffering almighty god to the world god knew there's a fire coming how many knows god said it's gonna burn and what did he what did he do he sent jesus christ to save us and he sent malachi 4 to get himself out of the muck and the mire of denominationalism to pull us on out of there and to have us ready he sent the prophet just like he said noah before the flood came he said another prophet before the fire is going to fall amen those who accept god's way will escape how many believe that if you accept god's way if you go god's way that he provides god's way is not iffy it's not well maybe you might when you get in god's path and you follow him you're going to make it is that right just keep following him there's not going to be no your fans or butts but the thing of it is and we already know what brother bam said he says there's only two ways in this world and that's god's way in your way amen your way he said he's always wrong and his way is always right [Music] his way is never wrong you'll never go wrong following god's way and you'll never go right following your own way it has to be god's way praise be to god but better batman mentions it and especially in the line of cain and then so many millions of people they do not want god's way they want to do it their way there is a way okay there is a way the true way is to follow christ to take up your cross and follow him in that right it might not be an easy path but it's a glorious path and i'm glad that god got me on it i would rather have it than any other way in the world but there's the other way the other way is hey man you're just gonna throw out god's way you're gonna do what you want live how you want drink all you want smoke all you want party all you want commit all the adultery that you want huh you're gonna do whatever you want and there's so many people that are that away and they don't worry about the consequences they don't mind reaping the consequences later on because there will be consequences churches and denominations the same way religious oh yeah you know we know that jesus comes and he vindicates and he proves to what the prophetic god was saying we know jesus always comes they no man can stand in the front of the prophet of god but the angel is there huh but we still want to do it our way my church don't teach that go ahead go your way think about it i'll hit it for the fire anything outside of god's way that he's provided will burn and the sad thing is just like it was in the days of noah no doubt but noah had scratched mark's sister johnny on the outside of the door scratching and clawing there was probably blood on the outside where they clawed until their fingers bled they were wanting to get in they were wanting to get in and i can say thus saith the scripture so will it be in this day because he says they'll call early they'll call but i will not answer they'll come they'll seek me but they will not find me they'll call upon me but i will not answer because when i did call when i didn't reach out my arm and regard it i didn't want it if i got to let my hair grow and be holy and live righteous and speak in tongues and and shout and be a christian and a holy i don't want all that they don't want all that well go ahead is that right but it's phenomenal how that that most of the people in this world want to go their way they don't want god's provided way they don't want the way that god makes they don't want the answer that god has they don't want the solution to their problem they love their problem too much amen oh my can i say something tonight amen if you don't want the solution if you don't really want the solution you're going to stay and love your problem but if you want a solution to your problem god has it in the medical world there is no sickness that god don't have medicine for let me believe that in god's medicine cabinet it doesn't matter if it's cancer it don't matter what it is huh leprosy even a foot needing to grow up huh that don't happen outside of a miracle isn't that right feet growing out or whatever it might be god has the solution for it it's there praise the lord let me just say what comes to mind is that all right just think about it now if god has got a remedy for every problem that we have it doesn't matter what it is but we really think about that he's got the solution and then we ask ourselves then why do i still have this problem well the prophet god taught us that if god ever healed a man isn't that right you ever healed a man on certain conditions if you meet those certain conditions you're guaranteed to get healed you need the holy ghost meet those conditions god is guaranteed he's got to meet it again [Music] he even told the devil's child that if you do what my child did i'll accept you he told cain do what you planted on and you'll be accepted humans are so hardheaded you can beat them over the head with a ball bat brother peter they still don't get it they still don't get it they refuse to get it humanity out let me tell you something outside of the children of god it's really bad it's chaos it's a brute piece world it's a dog-eat-dog world outside of the children of god disobedient to parents isn't that right traitors haiti high-minded lovers of pleasure more than god truths break everything in the book you name it they'll do it all they don't want the solution how many wants the solution say god i want the solution i want the way i want your way god don't let me have my way let me say this that this applies to your everyday life is what we're talking about here not just accepting salvation or getting the holy ghost no that's the way that you live every day has to be god's way for you to be a real christian or be a real real christian it's the way that we live every day it's the way we do every day it's the way we think every day that's god's way because he wants 100 control of you amen praise the lord all right isn't it wonderful to glorify god i don't rather do that than some basketball player or some football player huh the nfl oh do you have nfl what are they all gonna do kneel next just tweaked the air right out of me didn't you i really don't care about watching them anymore that's right the whole world there's there's no glory in it anymore there's no there's no prestige there's no what he might call i don't know glory i guess you know why it's falling apart this is the only thing that we can glory in paul said you know we don't glory in ourselves paul was not glory in himself let our glory be in christ because he is worthy of what all the glory amen praise the lord all right it's no sickness that he doesn't have a way to heal you with amen as his servant i believe that more today than any time i believe it's just as good today as it was when brother branham was here it is but it's just up to the individual it's up to you it's up to me i've been healed hello folks i've had things in my side i wonder what in the world's going on hello for a long time sure what is it what is it that just he the lord is my healer he's my healer i ain't felt it in a long time and i trust i never will you don't know how many things god heals up and heals you with they say we all have cancer you know right and but sometimes it'll just work out extra and go up into something amen it's just like brother bam's wife remember she had that thing on her ovary but it wasn't until she did something with this it's pleasing to the lord the glory allowed that thing to grow huh it's all in the mercy and the grace of god all right let's go on so praise the lord amen there's no hunger that he hasn't got food to satisfy that hunger amen there's no thirst that he can't quench he has made it away how many believes it he has made a provision for everything that you have need of praise be to god hallelujah we don't always understand now the problem of god he makes a statement the bible clearly declares if you'll go with me let's go to the next thought here in first corinthians 10. first corinthians 10. it talked about how that israel that god wasn't very well pleased with them how that they were overthrown in the wilderness that's uh first corinthians 10 and around 5. god wasn't very pleased these were done for example sir that we wouldn't lust after evil things and so forth and then down in verse 10 neither murmur yet some of the murmured and were destroyed of destroyer amen now all these things happen unto them for example and they are written for our admonition upon whom the answer of the world to come just to go to show you how that god will take the same scripture and just give you a little something else through it we've talked about murmuring many times and this out of the other but did you realize that even in the murmuring even if they're complaining the snakes begin to buy them and they begin to die and they're right he sent them out there they were dying by the thousands and they called moses help us help us help us help us help us it's something about when a man yells for help god has an ear open isn't that right and what does god do he makes a way for him i mean even though they murmured he god made a way for them to be alive and they took a serpent and put it upon the pole and just said just look huh what if it had been me what if i had been amongst the group that murmured and complained the snake would have come and bit me i'm i'm dizzy i can't really get but i know that there's a there's a serpent on the paw just over the hill and if i just see that thing i'll be healed oh i'm i'm saying y'all can't barely see bump your head into a tree come back around and come on up and you know keep going and keep trying just come up over the hill and your eyes are almost too faint you look at that pole wow something sweeps over the pain is all gone and you're back to strength like you should be when you do anything to get to look on that pole jesus said if i be drifted up i will draw all men unto myself how many believe that you just look upon jesus and believe on him look and live look and live amen he was the type of that serpent that judged serpent on a pole that serpent that you bad nature that you and i should have been judged for there he was and took our judgment that's it was sin being judged and he was our judgment just look at that and you'll live praise the lord god made it way for him even though they were dying by the thousands he made a way you know god said one place separates yourself moses and i'll just destroy the whole bunch well if god chose to can you imagine he could choose not to make a way they'd all just drop dead except for moses but he's a mercy for god i'm thankful for a mercy for god we serve a god that cares he just simply cares don't ever think god don't care let me tell you this i believe that god cares more than your mom your dad your brother your sister your uncle your aunt your grandma your great-grandma god cares more than any of us he sure does amen i'm thankful for a god that cares now this is not where i was going verse 13 is where i want to go now notice there has no temptation taken you but such as is coming to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way amen praise the lord for the way of escape amen now that temptation is also used over in james let's go to james as a trial okay as a trial a temptation or a trial the bible says they were tempted in the wilderness is that right they were tested they were tried in the wilderness so whenever you come to a place of trial god always makes a way out james 1 and 12 says blessed is a man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord has promised to them that love him how many knows that these temptations that come our way are more precious to us than gold more than your bank account more than you could have if he was a billionaire to be truly tested by almighty god it's worth more than any gold or you could silver you could have it's more precious all right my brethren counted all joy when you fall verse chapter one verse two when you fall into diverse temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience amen a lot of some of you can sympathize with me on this i thought that when i had a flat tire or or back in the day my bank was overdrawn or uh something like that i really had a problem i had a trial or something happened that you know you'd have to suffer for a week or two perhaps your car breaks down and you don't know where you're gonna drive next but you know as you get older sometimes those trials they don't last for a week or two they maybe last for a year or two how i forget how long it was but the ram said that whenever he disobeyed in africa for years he had he was sick sick sick sick for years sometimes our trials and temptations are long and hard but just remember this the bible says that if you endure it huh if you can get through it and still be a christian love the lord more there's a crown waiting for you he's saying that's the kind of people god wants to live with that's going the kind of people that's going to be with god is the ones that can go through a long hard trial and james understood this well because he knew that one thing these trials these tests do is they give you patience because if you're not patient in a trial you're going to lose it quick huh you're not going to be able to endure and that's not the kind god wants to be with him but it teaches you patience that's why anymore i'm sure a lot of us along with myself that when anything comes up i'm patient in it just take it easy don't get all excited don't get all right up don't get all flustered huh i'm not going to do any good but i guarantee you one thing can i say something one thing i can do if you get all flustered it's not going to make it better it is going to make it worse all those of you with experience on that that's right you get flustered about it and you get round about it you only mess it up worse amen we've all got experience there so lord help us that's what james was saying here count it all joy when you fall into knowing this that it works patience and if you're a patient man through trials there's very little things that you can't go through if you're patient and something about james and patience but let patients have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing how many knows that means like lacking nothing you'll have everything you need the bible talks another place about prophets and so forth being our examples who through patience obtained the promises amen like moses for 25 years like noah for 120 years through patience they obtained the promises praise the lord because guess what god don't want a two-week man in heaven well i'll tell you what i'm in heaven to two weeks now and you know i tell you what i i can't handle this anymore no he don't want someone like that no he wants somebody could be there a while somebody will endure the test of eternity you don't want no devil in there anymore he done had one of them that after a trillion years he decided you know i want to be like him i want to be a god i want people to worship me he got lifted up and pride was found in his heart and sin was firing in his heart isn't that right and he took two thirds of the angels or a third of the angels with him they got tired of heaven um got old to him church got old to him i don't know about you but i was looking forward tonight get together on a midweek this is the best part of the week getting together talk about something real something that isn't disappointing huh something that's got all the answers the lord jesus christ the holy ghost amen i won't keep you much longer let me just say this how many knows that brother bam said when you get the holy ghost how many knows jesus is the answer the holy ghost is the answer jesus is the answer he is the answer because why why is he the answer because he's got the prob solution to your problem he is the solution to the problem he can fix it he can take care of it rem says when you get the holy ghost he says you have now you you are then so to speak in possession of everything that you ever will have need of in this life's journey in other words the way is there the way is god will make sure that you taken care of for in this life's journey and in the world to come even in death how many knows he's already got your body prepared for you and when we go to crying over somebody here in the front of here and then oh man we're going to miss him at all we're just so depressed he said no we don't really realize it because we haven't seen it like brother branham had but that's the most glorious place they could ever be huh as a christian but that's just that beyond that last breath lies the world like you can't even imagine huh why because jesus don't stop taking care of his making ways just on this side no he makes the way we like control sister johnny's we like to have control of things that's one of the things that scares people to death about death all right you're no longer in control you're going to lay there and you're going to lose the ability like brother ivan did he lost the ability to move his hands and keep his hands in him or lose he lost the ability his body finally shut down finally shut down you come down there that death it just puts you in that corner isn't that right and then you're completely helpless you can't move your hand anymore can't move your arms anymore you can't speak anymore and you go on and you take that last breath and the spirit leaves comes out of the body how many knows you're in the hands of god but he makes a way he takes that soul and he puts it over into a perfectly young perfect body where he can't hug each other again and that soul goes into that other body because god makes a way i'm just glad that he does that he's the waymaker he gives that new body and our loved ones christians all christians they go over there and they're right there and they have another body they're not this body but they have another body that they can actually hug each other but a brand even brother brandon thought that ben and he taught it i seen i see the tape where he actually taught it that you know when you get over there you can't really pick cheek shake people's hands because you're a ghost or they're like a cloud or a vapor or whatever you just go right through it you know and be nothing there how are you going to give anybody hug it's just kind of a cloud it's kind of what he thought isn't that right until after division he says no it meets another hand when you grab somebody you hug them and that you actually have feeling in there right so i'm just glad for a waymaker that when you take that last breath that's what's so important to be a christian huh how many knows it's so important to be a christian because what if there's not a not a way made for you i could preach to you half an hour on where brother bram says what a horrible thing it is for a soul drifting on this sea of life with no pilot to guide him no waymaker no christ in here what a horrible life it is without the holy ghost he says the worst nightmare the worst thing that could ever happen for you would be to die out of this world without knowing god why there is no body there's no way for you there's no way made for you the unbelievers that refuse god's way they don't give them automatically a nice weight and that's what they're expecting i'm gonna have my way here and i'm going to have enough no no no you're in for a shock you're in for a surprise so then he says those people that had to have their own way do it your way you can have you can do it your way but when you come down to that death don't expect him to give you away we have a way we have a body we have a palace we have a place prepared for us am i right but they don't have a place and what is it what is it like it's just the same there as it is here it's a nightmare but the map says you go out there and that soul of yours right it's just floating it's just out there lost huh some of them try to go back into their body they want their body back because they want a body they need to be in the body but they can't come their their body their body's in the grave it's all gone they try to come back into this dimension and this you want to have just a little touch of spooky stuff yet tonight before you go to bed all right try not to get scared but abandoned tells the story of a car out in there is it arizona or somewhere out in the desert where a guy where a car hits the man with the overcoat and then right boom hits the man overcoat flies he goes back to find him and he ain't nowhere to be found the guy says man he goes to the police station i ran somebody over they went back there couldn't find nothing they said [Music] a few years ago somebody was hit with that description right about there but man what did he say about it if i'm not wrong he was trying to come back into this dimension and he actually i don't know how he did it how he would materialize enough to hit a car and actually make a sound but that's what he said folks i don't know about you but i don't want that way how many is with me i don't want that way i want that new body in that perfect light amen that god has made away don't worry the lord can turn it into a nice dream amen it doesn't have to be a nightmare amen you love the lord how many tonight are with me would say lord help me to live my life the way you want me to live it let's stand god bless you stand with me tonight i want to live the way that he wants me to live the way that he wants me to live amen and that is to be more like jesus you love him tonight let's bow our heads lord jesus we come before you father while we maybe thought that was funny but lord we realize it really wasn't for we realize that man is still out there in gross darkness because he didn't know you he had taken his own way perhaps i pray god tonight after after tonight that each and everyone here and listening to this message will say god take any way that i still have about myself that i want to do it my way lord take it from me lord and help me to replace that with your way in my life father whatever you have said in your word whatever you want me to do that's what i want to do lord we want to choose your way father for you have promised no matter what our situation is young or old whatever our situation is lord you've always made a way of escape you make a way for us lord we ask god that you help each one here tonight even as your prophet has said sometimes it's all about finding that way sometimes it's not easy finding that way but lord i pray god that you all each and everyone tonight that no matter what we come up against father that you help us define that way that you have made father to get through what we go through and we just ask god to give us patience and tribulation and temptations and trials that you'd give us patience and let it have its perfect work god that we might always trust in you and say god i don't know what to do with this and how to do about it i don't know don't have to ant but you do lord and i'm surrendered to you my life is surrendered to you and i'm trusting you to take me through this rock or this wall or this hard place we pray god as we come down to the end of time we don't know just how things will end up but we know the one that knows and we are in your care and we are most grateful tonight lord jesus to know that you are in the ship guiding it and leading us bringing this comfort father as we go through this journey we ask god that you'll just bless every heart and every hand as we completely surrender to you from the youngest to the oldest we say god here i am i surrender my ways to you lord help me live the way you want me to live father and follow your ways so that when i come down to the end of my life lord when i take them final breaths when this body shuts down as the prophet of god says you feel that coming up through your arm this that or the other lord we can say i know my redeemer liveth father may we be just like brother banham's mom lord where she was dying and brother brandon asked him as she was beginning to not be able to move her hand say if you love him as much as you ever did move your hand she couldn't move her hand anymore and then he said if you love the lord just as much bet your eye and she would bat her eye just a little movement just to show that she loves you just as much as ever and she went out to meet the lord and father i pray god help us help us to be ready lord to meet you for we know that your prophet said we are not fit to live until we're ready to die we ask god you would help us to be ready at any time father if you would call us we love you we ask your blessing upon this congregation of people and those listening lord help us to live different between wednesday and next sunday than what we have if there's any changes that need to be made lord help us to change them and say god have your way lord we ask these blessings and favors in jesus name amen and amen amen praise the lord okay so sunday lord willing i mean i plan we plan on being back i think we're going to go up to cumberland i won't be here friday night brother john but we're going to go to cumberland state park i guess

appreciate y'all and amen just continue to pray that the lord will watch over us amen keep the corona of ours at bay and pray for those that do have it and they've got to just deliver them because he
