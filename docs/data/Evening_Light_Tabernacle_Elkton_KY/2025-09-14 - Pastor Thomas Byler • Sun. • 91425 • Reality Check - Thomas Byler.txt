[Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Our heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] We'll just stand this morning. Maybe brother John Wade will open us in prayer this morning. Amen. The children can be dismissed for Sunday school. And if you'll go with me in the Psalms, we're going to continue in Psalms here. And we're going to go to Psalms 32. Psalms 32. Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long. &gt;&gt; I acknowledge my sin unto thee. Mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgression unto the Lord, and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Sa Thou art my hiding place. Thou shalt preserve me from trouble. Thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. say, "Be he not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding, whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridal, lest they come near unto thee." &gt;&gt; Be glad in the Lord. This one together. Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous, and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart. God bless. You may be seated, Brother Brian. &gt;&gt; Morning, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; I was just going to read if you want before get like a rocket and take off here. If you turn to uh first 2 Corinthians the 7th chapter, but I was going to reread that 8th verse here this morning. I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go and I'll guide thee with mine. And I was just thinking this morning, isn't that really precious to us as Christian believers this morning that God's got you in the palm of your hands? And if you'll just yield all that you are, everything that you are, both you know, body, spo, soul, and spirit to the heavenly father, the Lord, he'll he'll keep you in the palm of his hands and guide you in this wicked age that we live in. But uh I was going to read something before I get into that chapter. I I told you I have already taken care of all the major expenses for the upcoming year. Uh, it was a little bit more than I told you the last time. I was wrong. The insurance for the last year wasn't 39. It was 4,200. And you all know from your own policies that it's gone up again this year. So, the church's policy was around $4,700. And I went ahead and prepaid for 1,800 gallons of propane. So, you know, just in the past few weeks, it's been several thousand dollars I've put out, but the church will be all right. When I make the deposit this coming week, we'll we'll still be at about $10,000 in the general fund, and I I have about $1,400 in the building funds. So, the Lord has blessed us as we move forward. But um you know I was think I was sitting there uh it could be a dangerous thing and this one thought come to me that we're living in the age where everyone thinks it's just okay. And I'm really to be honest with you it's not just okay. You can't just be okay. You got to know that you know that God has touched your heart and that he's changed you. Because if you go along just believing everything is okay, then you'll wake up one day realizing that you're lost. But I was going to read a little bit out of the uh 12th chapter of of Matthew this morning. Um, and this is what Jesus had to say. Uh, I'm going to read from about the 39th verse. If I read too much, I'll apologize before I get started. But he answered and said, this is the 39th verse of the 12th chapter, but I'm going to be going to 2 Corinthians also. But he answered and said unto them, an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign, and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And we're at that right now. For Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly. So the son of man shall be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. but really struck me. The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because it repented at the preaching of Jonas. Behold, a greater than Jonas is here. And when you if you go back to Jonah, you realize that the Ninevites, I mean, they put sackcloth on everything. Their animals, their children, their wives, you know, the husbands, the leaders, the king himself, they all put sackcloth and they humbled themselves before our living God. And and you look at this age that we live in this morning. You think they would be able to would they humble themselves that way this morning? And I it would be a hard thing to see them do that. They're so they're running to destruction so fast. They're not even questioning the path that they're on anymore. And he goes on to say, "The queen of the south shall rise up in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it. for she shall come. She came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold, a greater than Solomon is here. And and she was willing to travel great distances in her day and time, which was a hard thing, you know, going by camel and by horse. You know, most people won't even leave their driveway to go hear the word of God in the age that we live in this morning. And they'll be held accountable. We'll all be held accountable for it. And he goes on to say, and this is what I was really thinking about this morning before I go into Corinthians. And Jesus taught the people that that's why I say it's not just okay. If you wind up playing with Christianity and playing with church, you're going to wake up one day and you're going to be possessed by spirits that you really don't want to possess you. Well, this is what Jesus had to say. When the unclean spirit goes out of When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places seeking rest and finding nothing. None. And some of us were like that. But we embrace the cross and the salvation of Jesus Christ. So we had that shield. We had that edge. So when they were looking for a way back in, there was no way back in. But if you're playing with church and playing with God, then you won't have that hedge. You won't have that protection if they're looking to come back in. And then he goes on to say, when the unclean spirit is gone out of man, he walketh through the dry places, seek and rest, and find it not. Then he saith, I will return in unto the my house whence I came out. And when he has come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. So if you play with church, you know, you reach that first pillar there. you you accept Christ, but you don't move into Christ. You you you got a clean dwelling. You got a clean place, but it's not being possessed by the Holy Spirit and the presence of Jesus Christ. It's open for other things to come into that clean place. And he goes, then he goeth and taketh himself. And this is what I was thinking about. It's not just the first date. You wind out being seven times worse than you were before. and then goeth he and taketh himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell therefore, and the last state of the man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be unto this wicked generation. And I was just thinking that's where we're at this morning. The world is, you know, brother Brandham said all those spirits were released in the river of Euphrates. You know, you just think before the the same spirits that were before the flood, the same spirits that were after the flood, you know, those same spirits are here and they continually have one objective and one goal is to ruin your life and ruin your experience in Jesus Christ this morning. And it's our obligation as Christians and as believers not to leave anything open in our hearts and lives that you fully have to have the armor of Jesus Christ on you where there isn't any openings that they can sneak in and make your life worse today than it was yesterday. And I'll just finish a few of these verses here as I go. You know, he also talks in that chapter about, you know, who's his mother, who's his father, who's his son, you know, brother and sister. And he simply said, "All that have given up everything and follow me." Um, Corinthians the 7th, 2 Corinthians the 7th chapter. I was wanting to read this before I get started because I'll get in a hurry and without reading it, but I I just been thinking about the circumstances the last week and that's why I said it's not just okay. You know, I was thinking about 911. You know, everyone went back to church for a few weeks and when did what happened after a few weeks? They went right back to who they really are and what they are. the and that's what I'm trying to it's not just okay. You can't have an okay spirit on you this morning. You actually have to have the actual spirit of Jesus Christ. If you don't have that spirit and you got that just it's just okay. You know, it'll be all right. Everything's all right. If you got that kind of spirit, it's not going to be all right. And I'll uh just read this. This is this morning's devotional. Um and this is what brother Brandham had to say. You know the lion of the tribe of Judah, rise up and roar. Thou art roaring in this last day. And he's talking about the time we're in right now. Your eyes are narrowed and you're looking down. You're seeing the sin of the so-called Christian nation and world. And the perspective here is to think that, you know, this was 60 plus years ago. So just think of where we're at this morning. It's even worse than than it was for him. Seeing that the sin of this nation when it's been bought with precious blood, you're seeing how the denominations are waiting over your word and seeing how the false prophets are lying. God truths they're denying and I could say to ourselves this morning, I think I'm reading the wrong one. I'm think but I'll just finish reading. I have multiple papers in my Bible. I'm reading the wrong one. the royal line of Judah. Let your prophets cry out. When God speaks, who can keep from prophesying? If the word of God comes out of the Bible, moving up through the prophet, how can we hold his peace? And that's where we're at this morning. If he would blow to pieces, oh God, let your prophet roar. Let roll out of your message, God. Let every creature of your kingdom take heed. May they stop. May the women stop and examine themselves. You know, and I as a man, I got we wouldn't be in the condition of the world it is. You know, a lot of people like putting it on everything else, but if men have been who they needed to be the last hundred years, the world wouldn't be like it is this morning. May they stop, May the women stop and examine themselves. May the men stop and examine themselves. May every preacher that listens to this tape stop and examine. And goes, this kind of goes to what I was thinking this morning. It's not just okay. If you got a just okay spirit on you, it's not okay. You have to have the right spirit. For the lo lion of the tribe of Judah ra the true word coming to the prophet. Speak, cry out, repent, and turn back before it's too late. You know, and that's what I was thinking when I was reading in Matthew this morning. We don't want to be be ever in the state of that person where the seven spirits came back and made our end state worse than our beginning state. But I'll just read and sit down out of Corinthians 2 Corinthians the 7th chapter. I'll probably read about 11 verses. This is what Paul, brother Paul had to say. You know what brother Paul had to say 2,000 years ago is just important today as it was 2,000 years ago. Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and the spirit, perfecting holiness and the fear of God. Just remember when we read this, whatever you're holding on to in your life, if you can't bring it through these scriptures, then you don't need it this morning. Receive us. We have wronged no man. We have corrupted no man. We have defrauded no man. I I speak not this to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts to die and to live with you. Great is my boldness of my speech toward you. Great is my gloring of you. I am filled with comfort. I am exceedingly joyful in all your tribulations. For when you were come, forgive some of my pronunciation, into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side without without our fighting fightings with in our fears. Nevertheless, God that comforth those that are cast down comfort us by the coming of Titus, not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you. when we we were told the earnest of your desire, your mourning, your fe fervent mind toward me so that I rejoice the more for though I made you sorry with a letter he's talking about writing letters and he had to be honest with the people bringing them to repentance I do not repent though I did repent for I am perceived that the same epistle had made you sorrow through it you were for a season now I rejoice not that you were made sorrow but you sorrow to repentance. And that's what I was saying earlier. Everything we read in the word of God in the message of Yahweh should be doing what Paul's saying here should be bringing you to repentance and receiving the true spirit this morning. And I lost my place. Now I rejoice not that you were made sorry, but you sorrowful to repentance. For you were made sorry for a godly manner that you might receive damage by us and nothing. And I'll stop at these last two verses this morning. For the godly s sorrow workketh repentance to salvation, not to be repented of, but the sorrow of the world workketh death. So what he's basically saying, true biblical sorrow of the of what we do in our lives will bring you to repentance. God will give you that spirit in your heart. If you stay quiet enough in your spirit and in your life, God will show you the parts of your life that we need to change or I need to change. It's so important that you listen to that still quiet voice as it's trying to lead you in the day and age. you know that there's been a lot of circumstances in the last week and I was just thinking of what brother Brandham said 60 year the one I was going to read where he was talking six in 1965 he was talking about 60 he was talking about how the message has not denominated after 20 years in that in that quote but we're 80 years past what he said in 1965 so I'm thinking no it won't denominize it won't come into anything other than the true word of God. And God is looking for individuals this morning. I can only speak for he wants to put his spirit in. He wants to give you the victory in the age that we live this morning. And the only way you can get there is by truly yielding to Jesus Christ this morning. Brother David &gt;&gt; of the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. enjoyed that this morning. And it's just good to be a Christian, isn't it? It's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning. And just looking forward to what God has for us by the way of his word this morning. And my just just excited for his goodness and mercy. And let's stand this morning if we could. And you know, I was thinking as brother Troy read that I like that seventh verse says, "Thou art my hiding place. Thou shalt preserve me from trouble. Thou shalt compass me about with song of deliverance. Say, love. I'm so glad that he's our hiding place this morning. Aren't you? Amen. And Amen. My hope is in the Lord this morning. Amen. Not in this world, not in Donald Trump, not in Putin, but my hope is in the Lord this morning from this day forth. Amen. Let's sing it with all of our heart. Oh my hope is in the Lord from this time on and ever more. Oh my hope is in the Lord forever more. I stand in all within the presence of the Lord. In whom the wisdom of the ages lies. For whom the raging of the seas subside. The living sacrifice, the only of life. Oh my hope. Visit the Lord. This time on and ever more. Oh my hope is in the Lord forever more. His tender mercies come with every rising sun. to meet the sinner in his brokenness. To offer healing and forgiveness and those who trust in him arrest. Oh my hope. Yes, it's in the Lord. From this time on and ever more. Oh, my hope is in the Lord forever more. Oh yes. Oh my home. Visit the Lord from this time on and ever more. Oh my hope is in the Lord forever more. Let's sing that second verse again if we could. I just love this. His tender mercies come with every rising sun. To meet the sitter in his bro goodness. To offer healing and forgiveness [Music] to those who trust in him will find their heart at rest. Oh, my hope is in the Lord from this time on and ever more. Oh, my hope is in the Lord forever more. Once again, my hope is in the Lord. Oh my hope is in the Lord from this time on and ever more. Oh my hope forever more. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise this morning. Amen. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Don't you just love him this morning? God bless you. It's good to see each and everyone out. We still have some that are not feeling well this morning, but we've got some visitors and brother Steve's sisters are here. And uh I wrote it down so I wouldn't forget. Sister Sheila and Sister Edith. God bless you all this morning. And it's good to have them here with us this morning. And I think Sister Eith just had a birthday, didn't you? Got another day older, didn't you? Let's give her a hand this morning for her birthday this morning. Amen. Amen. And uh I I got a notification this morning that it was a national holiday today. Who got that notification besides me? Well, my phone told me it's Sister Becky's birthday today. And we can't tell how old she is. Brother Steve said not. He didn't want to be in trouble this morning. So, but we just want to wish sister uh Becky a happy birthday this morning. We appreciate all that her and brother Steve do for the church and we we appreciate all of you this morning. You know, I thought, you know, I think I come from a pretty good family. The Wads, they're pretty good people, ain't they, Daniel? But, you know, I thought, Lord, you give us a family this morning. A family of God. &gt;&gt; You know, how awesome is that? That's pretty awesome. I think &gt;&gt; I just really believe that. Amen. And I'm I'm just happy to be that he wanted me to be a child this morning. Aren't you? &gt;&gt; That he chose me. &gt;&gt; I sure didn't I sure didn't deserve it, but I sure am thankful this morning. Amen. Thank God I am free this morning. Amen. Let's sing it with all of our heart this morning. Amen. Amen. Well, for a long time I traveled. Oh yes. Down a long, lonely road. Oh yes. My heart was so heavy it said I sank low. Yes.

And you know, not only is he did he save us, but he's a healer this morning.

Brother Daniel and brother Michael John, brother Paul, where are you at? Where Paul's not here? Come ahead, brother Daniel. Amen. We have some prayer requests this morning. We want to take to the Lord in prayer and want to give thanks to the Lord. Brother Brad's feeling better and Brother Thomas is feeling better and and uh Brother John text me just a few minutes ago. Brother John Ler, he said he's doing better this morning. They're they're not here this morning. We want to continue to remember brother John in prayer this morning that God will just be with them. And brother Thomas said brother Caleb is still very sick this morning. So we want to remember brother Caleb Ber this morning and our shut in sister Parish and sister Peggy. And I talked to brother David Smith, her son, the other day and he said she was doing good. Said she still relies on oxygen a lot. So we want to continue to pray that the Lord will just help Sister Peggy and also Sister Janette and Sister Sherry and continue to heal Brother Glenn. Just pray that God will help them. And also Sister Aaliyah and Hi May are not feeling well this morning. We want to remember them in prayer that God would just would just touch their bodies this morning. And uh also, Brother Brad give a request in the back for a na a man by the name of Roy that has cancer. and uh brother uh Weston had met him and told him about brother Brad and them about their business and they talked to them and his wife began to tell uh Sister Joyce about their condition and they begin to witness what God has done and amen our God's a healer this morning. So, we're going to ask brother Brad if he'll come and take these needs to the Lord. And if you have need on your heart, you just let it be known by the uplifted hand. Come ahead, brother Brad. [Music] With you. If you've got just a second. The Lord, you know, the Lord puts people in our lives at certain times and certain places and sometimes we don't know, we don't understand what for what, but we're we each have a purpose and God's got a plan and a mission for our lives. And that lady began to pour out her heart to Joah. Just kind of cornered her and and began to pour out uh the the need in her husband's life. Found out this week he had stage four prostate cancer. And so um Jo began to witness to her a little bit. She came out and they were at our greenhouse and and Joah said, "You we want to pray for you." And so I said, "What are we praying for?" And because I wasn't in there and she began to tell us and and just pouring out, you know, the devastating news and uh I said, 'Well, Joyce, did you tell her about Sister Donna? She said, 'N no, but I will. She began to tell her about Sister Donna. And I said, did you tell her about Brother Ron? She said, "No, but I will." So, we began to tell him about Brother Ron. I said that they gave him four months to live. He's been for five, five years now. brain cancer, lung cancer, bone cancer, well, you name it, it was all over. And she said, "What kind of church do y'all go to?" I said, "Well, I can tell you more." And uh so we begin to witness and just just prayed for them. And she said, "We we we used to go to we go to non-denominational church," she said. She said, "We I used to be a Baptist and we we went to church. That's all we ever did. Went to church. But we begin to pray. the anointing fell and and we laid hands on him and I thought she was going to run all over that field and scream and dancing. I mean, she was fixing to cut loose and but they they need a touch from God. And you know, the Bible tells us in in the book of Acts chapter 19, it said special miracles were done through Paul. How many's had a special miracle? Come on, church. We believe. Look at the hands all over the building. Special miracles. So if they took handkerchiefs from Paul who had special miracles done and they can lay those handkerchiefs on the people and those people would be made well. What makes us any different? Special miracles will be wrought by the people that God has working through. So we're going to we're going to pray over this handkerchief the needs of the people this morning and and we're just going to believe that special miracles will happen. How many believes that this morning? Hands all over the building. Let's just pray. Heavenly Father, we come before you this morning, Lord, with grateful hearts, thankful we see and have heard testimonies, and we see the goodness and the good things that you do in our lives, Lord, and the miracles that's happened in this very church, the churches that we associate with, brothers and sisters of like precious faith. When we bind our faith together and we believe, we put the devil on the run. We put the devil on the run and we we we cast him aside. We get him out of our lives, Lord. We look at the testimonies, Sister Donna, Brother Ron, Sister Elena, Buts, and we could just go on and on and on of the things that you've done. So, we bring these needs before you. We We didn't know these people that we come in contact with, but she said before she left, she said, "This is the only this is the reason we came to see you. It wasn't about a business or a flower." She said, "This is the reason you prayed for us. You've encouraged us." And Lord, we just want the words of encouragement to go to them. We we lay our hands upon this handkerchief. We pray and we bind our faith as a congregation for this special need that special miracles will happen. You know the needs of the people here, Sister Aaliyah, Sister Hie, Little Hie. Lord, that the devil's trying to hold them down and and Lord, we just ask that you would move on the scene for Brother John, Sister Peggy, different ones, Sister Margie, the different ones, Sister Janette, and we could just keep going on. Lord, we're a needy people, Lord, but you're a great big God. You're a great big God that heals and delivers and sets the captives free this morning, Lord. So, we we bind our faith. We put Satan on the run. We rebuke him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and ask that these special miracles would happen in these lives. We ask that you be in the remainder of the service. Bless this offering, Lord, and bless those that can give and those who cannot. Lord, we love you with all of our hearts and give you honor, praise, and glory for the testimonies that will come through this prayer, through these fa through through the binding of our faith. We give you the the glory before it we receive it, Lord, in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; For our transgressions. Oh yes. Oh, he was bruised for our iniquity. Oh, and surely he bore our sorrows and by his stripes we I like this verse. Oh, he has healed my sick soul, made me every widow, and he'll do the same for you. Oh yes. Oh, he's the same yesterday and today and for this Jesus of Calary. He was wounded once again this morning. Oh, and he was wounded for our transgression. Oh, he was praised for our uniquely. [Music] Yes. Oh, and surely evil are sorrow [Music] and by his stripes we are healed. Amen. You love him this morning. Amen. And I' I'd just like to give a little testimony if I could before we have brother Steve and them come sing this morning. And few weeks ago, we were playing volleyball out here. And of course, you know, I still think I'm young and my body keeps telling me I'm I'm I'm tired. And I spun around to try to hit the ball. And when I did, my leg just popped. And it got hard as a rock and I soaked it and everything. And about 3 days later, my whole foot turned black, blue, purple, and my toes. And and Janet told me, she said, "You know, you suffering with diabetes, all those things are dangerous for you." And she said, "You keep telling me you're going to quit. It's hard to retire." But, you know, and I just trusted the Lord and and you know, and I thought, God, you're a healer today. And I may not can play ever again in my life, but I want to thank him for touching my body this morning. And and there not been any problems. My toes have clean. They're not black, blue, and purple anymore. My foot's fine. And I just want to thank the Lord for watching over me. And, you know, God is good. And come ahead, Brother Steve, this morning. And amen. He's He's an awesome God. And you know, I I just I just love him this morning. And we appreciate him this morning, don't we? Amen. Amen. We've asked Brother Steve and Sister Becky to sing. And You didn't tell me [Music] What the [Music] How many times must I prove how much I love you? How many ways must my love for you I show? [Music] How many times must I resue you from trouble for you to know just how much I love you. Didn't I wake you up this morning? [Music] in your right mind when you walked into a problem. And I still cry in a time when you got along life's journey. My angel carried you so you would know just how much I love you. [Music] &gt;&gt; How many days must I be a fence all around you? How many nights must I wipe your tears away? How many storms must I bring you safely through for you to know just how much I love you. When I wake you up this morning, when you come to your right, when you walk into a problem, I step right in on time when you got weak. A long last journey my angel carried you so you would know just how much I love you. &gt;&gt; Did I put food on your table and I showed up when your bills were due? Where the pain is in your body and Christ [Music] when you were lost in sorrow. I died to set you free. So you would know just how much I love you. When I put food on your table, show up. And the pills were due. When the pain was striking your body, I said he bound to you. When you were lost in sin and sorrow, I died to set you free. You would know just how much I love you. &gt;&gt; So you would know. &gt;&gt; So you would know how much. So you would know. So you would know how much &gt;&gt; So you would know just how much I love you. [Music] [Applause] You know, that's an awesome song. &gt;&gt; That's one of my favorite songs. And you know, in the age we live in, there's not many wake up in their right mind anymore. but most of all that God chose you this morning. Brother Brandham said we should be the happiest people in the world this morning for all he's done for us this morning. I'm grateful. Aren't you this morning? Let's stand and let's just give the Lord a hand of praise this morning for his goodness and mercy. Amen. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Amen. We're going to ask Brother Tom to come this morning and Amen. We're going to sing that little chorus as Brother Thomas comes this morning. Thank you. Thank you, Lord, for saving me this morning. Well, thank you. Thank you, Lord, for saving me. Oh, yes. Oh, thank you. Thank you, Lord, for saving me. Once I was lost, now I'm found. Now my soul is heaven bound. Oh, thank you. Thank you, Lord, for saving me. Once again, oh, I say thank you. Thank you, Lord, for saving me. God bless you, Lord. [Music] Once I was lost, I'm found. Now my soul is heaven bound. Thank you. Thank you, Lord, saving me. Oh, and I'm so glad that Jesus set me free. I'm so glad that Jesus set me free. Oh, I'm so glad that Jesus set me free. Singing glory hallelujah. Jesus set me free. Oh s had me bound. But Jesus set me free. Oh me bound. My Jesus set me free. Oh. Sing me bound. My Jesus set me free. Singing glory, hallelujah. Jesus set me free. I'm on my way to heaven. Shouting victory. I'm on my way to heaven. Shouting victory. I'm on my way. Heaven. Shouting victory. Sing and cry. Hallelujah. Jesus set me free. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. I guess that's it. Thank you, musicians. &gt;&gt; I was thinking that. I was wondering if we had that last week and I just couldn't do it. All right, let's do have birthdays and anniversary. Thank you for reminding me, Brother Joe. Amen. You can be seated. All those that have a birthday in this month, if you want to come up. Amen. We'll sing for you. Amen. [Music] A happy Oh, a happy birthday to you. A happy birthday to you. May you feel Jesus very near every day of the year. A happy birthday to you. A happy birthday to you and the best one you've ever had. Happy birthday, y'all. Amen. God bless you. Amen. How about anniversaries? Anybody get married in this month, September? There we go. That sounds better. A happy anniversary to you. A happy anniversary to you. May you feel all Jesus near every day of the year. A happy anniversary to you. A happy anniversary to you and the best one you've ever had. Happy anniversary. Yeah. Praise the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And God is good, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand this morning. Amen. We want to remember Charlie Kirk and their family this morning. Amen. We uh know enough about him that that uh he went right in the face of the devil. &gt;&gt; I mean, he faced the devil down. So much so that he'd have to wear a bulletproof vest. Ain't that right? Yeah. Because of the threats. Ain't that right? So he wasn't afraid to get right out there and try to help them young people. &gt;&gt; Try to tell them the truth. &gt;&gt; Is that right? So I have a lot of respect for the man. Amen. And you're certainly living in Bible days. Yeah. Isn't that right? Where evil tries to destroy good. &gt;&gt; That's right. And so from what I understand, the man was living with a a trans partner. So that tells you much a whole lot about the trans person. Is that right? are homosexual. If they'll do that, folks, if a man will live with a man or something like it, they'll do just about anything. I'll say this from the pulpit. They have no morality. You got no morality. Zero. I wouldn't trust you more than nothing. That's right. And it's sad. But we do pray for the man that did it. We pray that God will bring conviction on him. Ain't that right? We pray for him. We pray that God will save his soul. That's right. Perhaps you'll see that this man was willing to give his life for what he believed. &gt;&gt; When you do that, you've got something worthwhile &gt;&gt; because I highly doubt he's got something worth giving his life for. Amen. So, we pray for him. We pray God save his soul. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Have mercy on him. Amen. But what he did was terrible. And so we want to just think about in a modern age in our own country where a Christian because he's a Christian and stands for Christ they took his life. Amen. So they if killed him martyed him because of that because of that. Amen. Because of his stands against these type of lifestyles and simply just telling the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Nowadays telling the truth can get you killed. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; But that's okay. We're going to tell the truth anyway. I I don't care who hears it. I don't care if you like it or not. It's the truth and we're going to stand for it. &gt;&gt; That's right. We don't We don't give one bit one little care whether you don't like it. &gt;&gt; It's still the truth. It's always going to be the truth. &gt;&gt; And it ain't going to change. We ain't going to change for people's opinion. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; We don't change for nobody. Amen. We stand with the Lord if it costs our lives. &gt;&gt; We would much rather die. Hello. than to give in to such scum and such such falseeness. &gt;&gt; Amen. And such perversion. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. No way we would ever want to uh taint our souls with such things. Amen. It shows where the world is. So, let's have a moment of silence to remember Charlie Kirk. Lord Jesus, this morning we also remember his wife, his children, his family, Lord, that have to separate from him and suffer the loss and feel that emptiness and have to go through that, Lord. And we do pray for comfort for them, Lord, that they could believe that Charlie's over in heaven, knowing he's given his life for the gospel and for the cause of Christ. And we just pray for them in a special way that you'll bring comfort to that family now in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, good morning everybody. &gt;&gt; Morning. &gt;&gt; Good to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so we want to try to preach the message that we were going to Wednesday, but we just doesn't fill up the strength yet Wednesday. And we certainly hate to have cancelled, but after I cancelceled, I says, "Boy, I'm glad I did. I'm just going to rest." Amen. Because anyway, I uh I mean, how many know this is some pretty pretty strong stuff. Remember Caleb? I know he's had a got a bad way to go of it. And I know John, I think, got it maybe, you know, pretty bad, too. So, Amen. And so I don't know if any I don't know a lot of men are getting it. I do know that. But we just pray that God will give them strength. Give Caleb strength and John bring them back up. Amen. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. And so I've had plenty of time to study. Amen. And so kind of a new subject for me really. So Amen. We want to just see what the Lord will have for us this morning. I'd like to have a board meeting if I could, but Irvin, if you have to leave right after church, uh, unless you have to, let me know. But if you don't, Amen. I need the board. I'd like to talk to the board this this morning after service if you will. And also, we're not going to have communion this morning. Amen. Amen. Let's bow our heads, go before the Lord in prayer. Father, we come before you, Lord. We want to thank you, Lord, for being able to gather together, Lord, once again in your precious name, Father. Lord, and as we try to deliver what we feel you've laid upon our heart to speak, we Lord ask, God, that you just get me out of the way, Lord, and use your gift. Let the people operate the gift, God. Lord Jesus, and feed the sheep this morning, spiritual food. And Lord, truly help us to go from here closer to you, Father, than when we come in those doors, Lord Jesus. For we always want to leave better and not worse, Lord. And Father, we ask God you'll bless the reading of the word, meditation of our heart now, and bless those that are not feeling well. We believe that by your stripes they are healed. Thank you Lord for feeling better oursel Lord and brother different ones that have come out gotten over this. Thank you for health. Father we praise you for it. We ask these blessings in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. All right. So let's turn our Bibles if you will to 2 Corinthians 4. 2 Corinthians the 4th chapter. Amen. Amen. And do you um uh let me see. We'll put that title up in a minute. 2 Corinthians 4 verse 16. For which cause we faint not, but through our though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. for our light affliction which is but for a moment workketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. While we look not at things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. Amen. May God bless the reading of the word. You can be seated this morning. My title this morning is going to be reality check. reality check. Amen. I think we're all familiar with the phrase, isn't that right? Amen. Reality check. Sometimes we need a reality check. And we want to talk about that for a little bit. Amen. Amen. Brother Brad, get my phone, would you? Amen. I did have something there that I wanted to bring out. I didn't think I had anything on there, but now that I'm starting on this, I do have something I want to try to pull up. basically the definition of reality. Amen. What Siri says about what the re what uh the definition of reality is. Amen. And it says it this way. Um it says the world or the state of things as they actually exist. Amen. as opposed to an idealistic an ide idealistic or notional idea of them. A thing that is actually experienced. I like that. A thing that is actually experienced or seen. Is that right? Amen. Especially when this uh Okay. And then the next one is a thing that exists in fact. In other words, the truth. Is that right? some facts. Amen. Something that's real. Amen. Having previously only existed in one's mind. The quality of being liike or resembling an original. Amen. So something that's real. I just want to say something that's real. Amen. Because if we're living in a world where there's very very many things, it's not real. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'll start with saying this. Brother Bram said, "Even us looking at each other." He says, "You look at each other and see Troy, I see you." What did Brother Bram say? No, you never seen Troy. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. We think we see each other. It looks real to me. &gt;&gt; But yet, Brother Bram said, "No, you've never really seen each other. The only thing that you see is the house that you're living in. &gt;&gt; Why? Because how many know this here house here it's made out of dust. In other words, if you went out there and really dry right now and you grab a handful of dust and the Bible says we come from dust and we go back to dust. &gt;&gt; You come from dirt and you go back to dirt. You know, so and and I think it was Peter one place says our life is our even our very life is like a vapor which appears for a while. It's like a mist, right? A vapor is like a mist. It's comes for a while and then it's gone. &gt;&gt; Not real. Not real. And and Paul here explaining it. Brother Brandon when he preached this message of what I that I'm that I I pulled some quotes out of called the uh the unfailing reality of the living God. The re unfailing realities of the living God. Amen. And so we want to start amen with first a prayer or a little as he was approaching scripture one place he says it this way. Amen. Something that's real and something that's not real. Now we want to approach this my friends sainely reverently and scripturally. It must come from the scriptures. And if it's not in the scriptures and the meaning is not carried, can we say this morning on absolutely biblical and scripturally, then it's wrong. &gt;&gt; It's just some makeup. It's mystical. &gt;&gt; It's not real. So even if a church service isn't carried out according to the scripture, it's a myth. Not real. &gt;&gt; Wow. How many believe it has to be according to the scriptures? &gt;&gt; Amen. Has to be according to the scriptures or it's just a myth. It's not reality. Oh my. The whole world is living outside of reality. They need a reality check. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believes the world needs a reality check? Sometimes we need a reality check. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Mystical, but it's not real. He said it's not real. Even a service is not real. And I'll just go ahead and take my time. Is that okay? We'll just go down this road a little bit because brother Bram said that the church world is doing God a service without it being his will. When you're doing something outside of the will of God, hello. Then you're just doing some dream. You're having some dream, doing something mystical. It's not really real. And I'll go ahead and go right really, really deep here. Because even on that day, because it goes real deep, we'll get there. But even on that day, many will come to me and say, "Haven't we cast out devils? Haven't we spoken tongues? Haven't we all these things?" Well, I never knew you. &gt;&gt; How many know you were? They were living in a fantasy world. They were not living in reality. They weren't deceived. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believes that that day on that day there's going to be a real reality check on the day of judgment? Folks, you can deceive yourself and everything else you want over here, but there's a reality check coming for the whole world. &gt;&gt; Everybody's going to have a reality check. Oh, there is no God. There is no hell. You're in for some real a real crude awakening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'll just go ahead and say this that if you're religion and you believe this message in your mind, you're still living in a mystical world. &gt;&gt; It has to be more than just some psychology. It has to be more than just in your mind. It has to be a reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham, he used the scripture of the woman at the well when he preached his unfailing realities because his woman was thirsting, right? Isn't that right? Drawing water. I'll give you water, you never thirst again. Water you're drinking now, you're going to get thirsty again. It's never going to satisfy you. Isn't that right? How many believe a lot of people live in that world of drinking water that never satisfied? &gt;&gt; What did he say over in Isaiah 56 somewhere over there? Oh ho, everyone that thirsts and everybody that hungers and so forth, come. I'll give you drink. I'll give you food. I'll give you food and drink. Amen. That you come not to buy. You don't have to buy. Just come and get. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And uh you'll be satisfied. And this woman, she had she needed to be satisfied. And so he used that one. And then he makes a statement. We're just going to start here. In the days when g of Jesus of Nazareth when he was here on earth walking in flesh, he found the people in his day seeking a religion that would bring them deliverance. They wanted a religion that would deliver them from all of their evils and their enemies. And Christianity met every challenge that they asked for. Christianity met every thing that they needed and everything that they asked for. It challenged everyone of their needs. I was going to read this here at the end, but I'm going to bring it in here because it's a pretty good time to bring it in. It challenged everyone of their need, but they would not receive it. Listen. He says uh God, he's omnipotent. He's all power. That's the kind of God that we serve. It's not some pagan idol. It is a living resurrected Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit, which is the spirit of the Lord Jesus that covers the whole earth that he that he would be everywhere, knows all things. He's got all wisdom and power. What a wonderful God. He says, "And and to know that not it's not just some makeup. &gt;&gt; It's just not somebody's theology, but he lives in us, &gt;&gt; chose himself, proves himself alive. Oh, we ought to be here. We should not be or should we not be the most happiest people in the world?" &gt;&gt; Amen. Our hearts should be racing swiftly traveling around the world and seeing different nations and their gods and their idols and so forth and all the philosophies and to know all of their foolishness. Amen. There's not one of them. Their founders are dead and in the grave and gone. The only one that can prove their leader is alive and remain is this gospel of Jesus Christ. Amen. Listen. But when our God, our Jesus comes on the scene and does the same things that he did when he was here before, that proves that he lives. He's not dead. How many know that Christianity is the only real religion? &gt;&gt; Everything else is a myth. I hope everybody out there hears that there's no other correct religion out of Jesus Christ, the son of the living God. None. They're every last one of them dead. They're everyone a myth. &gt;&gt; And people love a myth. People love to live in unreality, if there's such a word. &gt;&gt; People love to live there. And it's sad, but people love to live in something that's actually a phony than the real thing. Oh my. So he says they didn't want it then. They didn't want and it's about the same today. Back to our quote. We find people like it was then seeking a religion that'll do something for them that'll bring some reality to them. Amen. And true Christianity meets every one of those challenges. How many glad for that this morning? But they don't receive it. There's a lot of different reasons, but we'll touch a couple. They just don't want it. It's the nature of the people. Now, I'm not speaking to the bornag again church. I'm speaking to the nation and the country as a whole. They just don't seem to want it. Because see, if you really want anything, you can't rest till you get it. &gt;&gt; How many glad that you want something real? [Applause] &gt;&gt; I want the real McCoy, Brother Urban, &gt;&gt; how many wants the real McCoy? &gt;&gt; As we put it, I want the real thing. Don't sell me no substitute because the devil, man, he offers people all kinds of substitutes. &gt;&gt; Substitute joy, &gt;&gt; substitute peace, &gt;&gt; substitute salvation, &gt;&gt; substitute religions. As a matter of fact, all whose names are not written in the Lamb's book of life shall wander after the beast. That's right. The whole world wanders after the beast, after the deceiver. And I'll tell you why. Why do people not want the real thing? Why do why do they not want to have have reality? You can go to people and tell them that Jesus Christ came in this hour and did exactly what he did when he was here walking on the face of the earth. He discerned the thoughts and intents of the heart. He healed the sick, raised the dead, and he did it in his body. And they don't want to hear it. They want their church. &gt;&gt; They want their religion. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen to this. But today, people are trying to give people something that they really need and they don't want to accept it. They just don't want it. And the attitude of the people hasn't changed. And yet, that is exactly what the world needs today. &gt;&gt; How many knows that Christ has provided everybody with exact I like that exactly what they have need of. Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; We don't have to wonder whether the Baptist or the Methodists or the Menite or the Amish or any of those. We don't have to wonder about whether they're right or not. &gt;&gt; We don't wonder. Hey, maybe I ought to belong to that one. Maybe I No, you ain't got to wonder that cuz Christ came and proved himself and took us back to the word. There's no doubt in our minds and how happy we ought to be &gt;&gt; to have the resurrected Christ. Not just in brother Bham, but in our amongst us this morning. Exactly what the world needs is the religion of Jesus Christ. Deliverance from the things that they're fearing and dreading and have need to be delivered of. Oh my, it's just like it was back then. the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Herodians, and all these different sex of religions that they had. Amen. So he comes down here, he says, "But when he comes in his power of his resurrection to make people live and act and behave themselves and change their attitudes, change their ways, change their living. They don't want nothing to do with that." &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right. Do you want to live the way they want to live? Thinking man's filtered. Brother Bam says there's so many different churches out there. You can go out there and you can have just about whatever you have a taste for. The devil will provide you for it. &gt;&gt; And people have a taste for stagnation. They don't like a church that's alive. They like somebody that's quiet. They don't want to have your the neighbors and everybody around them screaming and hollering, "Woo! Praise be to God." They might be under pressure to need to do a little debt themselves. &gt;&gt; They don't want to be rebuked for being cold and lukewarm and and all of this. No, they like their lukewarm living. &gt;&gt; They like to live the way they want to live and still claim God and still be religious. &gt;&gt; That's their taste. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bram describes it very well. He was a prophet. He would, right? &gt;&gt; That's why I like to read it. They want to live the way they want to live. They want to continue right on living the way they have always lived, but yet very religious. Go to church, be a member thereof. Amen. They can go to Sunday morning, whatever time it is, and about 15 minutes sermon from the pastor. They walk away from there kind of halfway feeling satisfied that they've done their religion for the week. God help us. How many I hope nobody's like that here this morning. We didn't just come here about 15 minutes. Amen. That through our religion. We come here to worship the Lord. We come here to praise God. We come here to tell the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. We come here to get washed. We get come here to have our sins forgiven. We come here to walk away with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I'm not a longer lover of stagnation. When there's no hallelujah, there's no praise. Amen. and the preacher can't preach, I get a little worried. &gt;&gt; No, we like that fresh water bubbling up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many likes that fresh water? That spring of water. &gt;&gt; People are living in the glare of another age. Brother Bam says, "Oh, those churches, they're living in Luther, Wesley, Pentecost, and some day going by they're living in a mirage. Amen. It looks like though there's water on the road up ahead from the heat. Hey, there's water up there. Be careful. But you never get there. There's never no water. Amen. It's a myth. It's a mirage. That's where they're living. They're living in a mirage. The glare of another age, not the real thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They like that. feel kind of like they did their religion but still go out there dirty. Still go out there with the same desire that they had. Oh, it's in this message. You ought to go listen to it. Brother Bam says, "Man, if God, if the your nature hasn't been changed and you still got the same desires, amen, that you had before, I wonder what you got." But I don't believe it was the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; No. When the baptism of the Holy Ghost becomes, it changes your nature. That's right. &gt;&gt; And many people will be deceived. But Bam said there's going to be millions and billions of mimics of Christianity. They're not going to be the real thing. They're going to be phony. They're going to be fake Christians. &gt;&gt; Mimics &gt;&gt; acting like somebody else. He says, "God speed today that we are what we are. Act like who you are. Not trying to impersonate somebody else. Be real. be yourself. &gt;&gt; Everybody trying to act like somebody else impersonating and everything else mimics a lot of phony out there. A lot of things, a lot of people that claim to be Christians aren't really Christians. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. As I was studying, I say, "You better watch your neighbor who you sit by." Amen. Because if they aren't genuinely really born again, be careful. &gt;&gt; That's right. They're not going to think right. They're not going to talk right. They're not going to lead you right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Birds of a feather flock together. If &gt;&gt; you can't get along with one another, there's somebody got the wrong spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Message people ought to love message people. Amen. We ought to be filled with the Holy Ghost. We can get along. &gt;&gt; We can say we're sorry. &gt;&gt; We can apologize. We got enough of the Holy Ghost in us to tell us when we're wrong. &gt;&gt; We got enough of the Holy Ghost about us to repent if we need to repent. &gt;&gt; Get right. Don't keep going down the same road. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank be to God. Amen. That's what he said. Just enough to make them feel kind of halfway satisfied that they've done their religion for their week. That settles it. Go back and do anything they want to the rest of the week. &gt;&gt; Amen. But like back in the Old Testament, right? go do their religion, sacrifice their lambs, s make their sacrifices, but still go out the door the same nature that they had before. Do you realize this morning that God in the Old Testament, he was kind of a myth to people, the father above us, he was out there somewhere and nobody really understood who God is or what he was or what he was like. &gt;&gt; What is this God like? &gt;&gt; Do you wonder what it was really like? Amen. He come down on a mountain and Amen. and fire and smoke and earthquake and scared him to death. He said, "Don't let God speak. Let Moses speak." And ever since that time, God has always used prophets. He's always used the instrumentality of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believes he does this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God just changes his mask. &gt;&gt; Amen. But it was just a mystical something. But when Jesus Christ came, what happened? I'll tell you what happened, when this mystical God, this thoughts of people's imaginations of what God was like, express himself come down. Amen. When the beginning was the word, the word was with God, the word was God. But when the word became flesh, &gt;&gt; now it's a different story. &gt;&gt; That word becoming flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 1 and3 says, "He who being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person." &gt;&gt; How many believe that Jesus Christ was the express image of God? The way that he lived, the way that he loved, the mercy that he had, and the grace that he had, it expressed God. You could see God. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Peter and all of them were still living in a myth. &gt;&gt; They were still living in a dream world. E, even though they were sanctified, even though they were justified, hello. They just hadn't got filled yet. They weren't converted yet. Amen. How many believe that? Because even Jesus said, "When you're converted, &gt;&gt; young people, you can't just get reformed. You have to get converted." &gt;&gt; A conversion. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's why Peter, if you think about it, said the same things that he said. He'd always open up his mouth and without the Holy Ghost speaking, you're bound to say the wrong thing. &gt;&gt; He'd always be saying the wrong thing. But there Christ was there. God was a reality. When the dead were raised, it was a reality. When the lepers were cleansed, it was a reality. It was real. Amen. Let me just go backwards a little bit. How many knows? And uh I'll pick this back up again. Let's go way, way, way back. Amen. Back to Eve. Eve and Adam. They lived, could speak to trees, speak to nature. It would do it. Never had a feebleness. They never had to deal with sugar, blood pressure, old age, or feebleness. &gt;&gt; Oh my. No feebleness. Perfect strife. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Felt perfectly good all the time, right? We don't feel like that. The days are shorter and less of feeling that energy. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I like that energy. Some of us are smiling because we know, Amen. As you get older, there's less of it. You appreciate it more. You young people, you enjoy being young. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Jump. Holler. Yeah. Yeah. One of these days you're going to be going. &gt;&gt; Old age really stinks, don't it? &gt;&gt; That's right. Ain't no fun. &gt;&gt; All of those 18 years, 20 years of that vibrance and that energy. Don't worry, you'll pay for it. You have about 20 years old or however long you get to be sagging around at the old age. Hello. So enjoy it while you can. But they had reality. Isn't that right? They had reality had life. And what did the devil do? He brought in a fake reality. &gt;&gt; And Eve believed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many know the devil said, "Thou shalt not surely die." But when she began to get wrinkles and she got old and she was immortal, she that was a reality check for her. Reality check was God's word is true. How many believes that the world needs a reality check that this Bible is the truth. [Applause] This is reality. Everything is not reality. It's a dream. It's a myth. It's fake. It's not real. &gt;&gt; Even Paul said the things that we seen Amen. Amen. are are temporal. &gt;&gt; They're not real. Only the things that you don't see are real. Amen. Brother Brandon was preaching up in Canada and that soldier that was healed the night before couldn't walk and different things and he was healed. The next day, Brother Brandon was walking down the street and there was a salesman there, TV salesman. You all remember the story and he got to talking to this TV salesman and some cowboy dude and you know and he got to talking to him and and he said, "Let me sell you one of these TVs." and so forth. No, I'm just passing through. Brother Bram says, "I'm just here for the meetings." "Oh, you ain't with that Brandon Bunch, are you?" "Yeah, I'm with that Brandon Bunch." He says, "Well," he says, "Didn't you ever see it?" He says, "What do you think about that discernment and all of that?" He says, "I think it's all mental psychology." Called him a hypocrite or something like that or real bad names and so forth. Amen. Kept talking. Kept talking. And come to find out he realized brother Brandon was a preacher. I just called you a hypocrite or something what it was mythal the tele telepathy or whatever. And he says right to your face. He said well I'd rather hear you tell tell it to my face than anywhere else. And then later on he brother Bam said I said yeah a fellow said to me not long ago he said brother Bham he said anything that's not scientifically proven is not real. Now, I said, I'll just contradict that, brother, and say that anything that is scientifically proven isn't real. &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, it's not eternal. There'll come a day when it will cease to exist. It'll be gone. It's not real. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, that sounds don't sound intelligent." I said, "I know it don't sound intelligent, but it's correct intelligence. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's correct intelligence. &gt;&gt; You think you're alive, just let some time go by. We'll put you in a box and bury you. That's how alive you are. How many knows that even this life here is death? &gt;&gt; Remember that woman in the hotel? Oh, this is life. She said, no, it's not. It's death. Bible says we were we were in we who were dead in sins and trespasses. He that hath the son hath life. He that hath not the son had not life. In other words, you're dead. &gt;&gt; You're not really alive. What do you think these Hollywood stars and all their money and all their beauty and they made it as a star, but they'll disfigure their face and look like a pumpkin of some kind blowing their lips up and their cheeks up and look freaky as all get out. Yeah, that's right. I hope you're listening. Why? Because you're not satisfied with how you look. How did you get to be a movie star in the first place? It wasn't with the new look you got. Why? It's because there's something empty in here. &gt;&gt; They're dead. &gt;&gt; Why do you think people are not happy with their one wife or their one husband? Because they're dead. They're empty. &gt;&gt; Felio love isn't real either. Felio love, brother Bam says, will turn to hate. And hate turns to murder. How many of them will murder your wife? murder their husbands. Hello. But agape love is real. &gt;&gt; Agape love won't divorce his wife and go love won't divorce your husband because you're living higher than Felio. &gt;&gt; How many believe that's what we need? We need the real love of God. It's real. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we see here that anything you see isn't real. It's only the things that we don't say that's real. Amen. All right. So, he says that don't sound but it's correct intelligence. The real things of life cannot be scientifically proven. He said, "If it isn't scientifically proven, I can't accept it." I said, "Are you a married man?" He said, "Yes, sir." "You love your wife?" "Yes." "Scientifically, tell me what love is. What part of you? Pull it out here and analyze it." Hello. Got him already. Just one question. One question. Come on. Scientifically proved love to me. Ain't no way. &gt;&gt; Prove scientifically you got a mind. Got to take your word for it. &gt;&gt; All right, let's go a little bit faster here. And I said, "Have you got any mind?" He said, "Certainly." I said, "Scientifically, show me what your mind is." Can't be done. Certainly. He says, "But listen, but what's real? Love is real. Joy is real. &gt;&gt; You might not be able to see it see it, but we can sure see the effects of it. &gt;&gt; When we get a little happy, you can see, hey, boy, that person's happy. That person has some joy. &gt;&gt; Long suffering, peace is real. &gt;&gt; Goodness, gentleness, patience, all those are God and they're the real thing. Amen. The scientific things are perishable, come from the earth. Amen. But the unscientific things are the real things that come from heaven. God, the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; How many believe the Holy Spirit? It's real. &gt;&gt; How many's got it? &gt;&gt; It's real. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. and blew it off again. No, that's the old one. All right. All right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Angels all around us campus around us. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Amen. I love the way brother Dwayne Lawson preached on angels and bring quotes out where brother Bam says of sister all of a sudden just something comes over and oh my you know and he says it was angels wings &gt;&gt; rubbing up against them giving you that extra inspiration. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe we got angels around us influencing us &gt;&gt; trying to wave us on? Amen. Supernatural. They are the everlasting things. Amen. Believe on the Lord. Don't just try to scientifically Amen. Prove it. Amen. Praise the Lord. Every essential thing about us is unseen. How many believes that? Every essential thing. what people won't go through to have joy. &gt;&gt; People will marry a husband, a wife, thinking, "Oh, I'm going to be happy with a husband and wife. I'm going to be happy with marriage." Until reality sets in. Hello. And it's maybe not as cozy as what you thought it was. And you need realize you need something more than a mate. You need something that satisfies you already. &gt;&gt; Then God will add that to you and it'll be the next best thing to what you got. But don't rely on those things for happiness and joy. &gt;&gt; No, there's only one true happiness, only one real joy, &gt;&gt; and that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in your soul. Outside of that, it's all a substitute. People will do drugs and doing drugs out there for try to have a little good feeling to feel good. &gt;&gt; I ain't got to do no drugs. I ain't got to drink no beer and I feel good. &gt;&gt; Guess what? I won't wake up with a hangover. They will. And they'll wake up empty and they'll have to go back then the next day and try to do the same thing. and drug upon drug and never satisfied. Amen. Until blisters and boils and everything, amen, their skin falls off them and they rot in their flesh trying to find joy &gt;&gt; when God and Christianity has already provided it for them. &gt;&gt; But they want a substitute rather than the real thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. You love him. &gt;&gt; So we go back to our story. Jesus Christ when he was here. We He was the expressed image of God. He was God in flesh. He was reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In flesh. &gt;&gt; That's what we want this morning. I could have titled it that reality in flesh &gt;&gt; because the word is reality &gt;&gt; and the word was made flesh come down in flesh. Is that right? You all remember the little story about the little boy that was scared of lightning and his mom and family was a Christian family. She says, "Junior, go upstairs. Go to bed. You have nothing to be scared about. You ain't got nothing to be scared about. Don't The lightning won't hurt you. Thunders won't hurt you." He was kind of whimpering and whining and so forth. And he got up there into bed. Amen. Junior snubbed a few times after she said, "Don't be scared. God is with you. He'll protect us." Junior snubbed a few times. He says, "Mama, I believe that, too." But when that lightning's flashing so close to the window, I like the feel that God has got some skin on it. &gt;&gt; Amen. How about us? When the lightning's flashing, when the sea is roaring, when the evil is in the land, I want God with some skin on. &gt;&gt; I want God or is a reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a big saying. It's a great saying, almost hard to be understood, but for the disciples to walk with Jesus, to have him right there doing miracles, signs and wonders, speaking to him. &gt;&gt; But how many believes that you and I have something better than that? &gt;&gt; Better than that. Yes. &gt;&gt; When Jesus went to the grave of Lazarus and rose him from the dead, everybody was in awe. Wow. Nobody could do these things unless he was of God. They were in awe. Wow. when they couldn't cast out that epilepticy out of a child. Ain't that right? And Jesus had to come along and say, "Oh, ye of little faith." He cast that devil out. Everybody was in when he said, "I do nothing but what my father shows me first. Show us the father and it'll satisfy us." They wanted to see this father. They wanted to experience the father. How many knows the life of God, the power of God was still void in those disciples? &gt;&gt; Not that they didn't have authority to go cast out devils because Jesus gave them that authority. He gave them the faith to do it. But their nature wasn't changed. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me their nature was changed. Peter lied like the devil. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Got mad fixing to cut a man's head off. Not his ear. Oh boy. Here's here here here here's a good one for us. You know, you would think that if Jesus had anything to do with protecting that man that his ear wouldn't have got cut off, huh? Well, Jesus was there and he didn't let Peter cut his head off. And you know, sometimes things happen in our lives. We think, well, if God was going to do something, he wouldn't, you know, just allow this to happen. But sometimes he does. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Now, this is off the subject, but just remember that when things aren't quite the way you think they are, just trust God. &gt;&gt; He's got it in his control. He knows what he's doing. &gt;&gt; He grabbed that ear up there, and we had an instant reattachment of the ear. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. But God was still not I want to say this. God was still not a reality to Peter. &gt;&gt; Peace was still not a reality to him. The real comfort that comes with justification and sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost, it was still not a reality. No. Because if it would have been, Jesus wouldn't have had to go to the cross. There would have been no need of the day of Pentecost, the second chapter of Acts. Isn't that right? Because they would have had what they had need of. But they had a need. &gt;&gt; Amen. They had a need, and that was reality. the reality of God, of what he is, of who he is. Amen. Praise be to God. Because they could never understand when he said, "My peace give I unto you. Not as the world giveth, give I unto you." Amen. My joy I give to you that your joy may be full. He comes to give his fullness of joy. How many believes it wasn't until the day of Pentecost &gt;&gt; when they were in that upper room? God was a myth. Jesus was a myth. They didn't really know who he was. And remember this. Remember Paul said, "From now on, we don't know Jesus after the flesh." &gt;&gt; Is that what Paul said? In other words, we don't need we don't know him after the flesh. But we know him where? In here. We know him by spiritual revelation. &gt;&gt; How does this thing How does God become real to you when he reveals himself personally to you? See, it ain't just good enough for Jesus to be filled with God. No. But I need to be filled with God. You needed to be filled with God. It isn't just enough that your mom has the Holy Ghost that they know God. No, you want to know God. I want to know him myself. &gt;&gt; I don't need God in my dad and my mom. That's fine. But I need God in here. I want a personal reality of God in my life. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, it won't do you no good. Your mom's experience, my experience, your pastor's experience isn't going to do you any good. No, you got to have a personal revelation &gt;&gt; for him not to be some historical god, &gt;&gt; some god of history, some myth. I can tell you how God delivered me, how he forgave me, but that doesn't do you any good. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? The angel of the Lord was with the prophet. God was with the prophet. That's all fine. Yeah. But we need God here. We need the angel of the Lord here. &gt;&gt; I need him here with me. I want God in my skin. Do you want God in your skin? Everything else is false. Everything else is a failure. Everything else is a lie. You won't make it. Many of them will get it on their flesh. They'll get happy. They'll get on on their flesh. They'll get it in their spirit and speak in tongues, but it don't change their nature. Why do you think Jesus says, "You've got to be born again. You've got to be changed in your soul. Many will come to me in that day and say, "Haven't one day the other thing." You were living in a mess. You're still living your own life doing your own thing. Hello. Very few that'll ever live in that full reality. Praise be to God. We want God with skin on. Didn't Brother Bram say out there in them deserts, the word is becoming flesh. The flesh is becoming word. They're becoming one. How many believe we're becoming one with Christ? &gt;&gt; That's right. God is coming down in a greater way. Oh, I want to say people lived in the times of Brother Brandham saw his meetings. Look at where they are today. Still got a plane waiting up to come back. Their children, they're just listening to tapes and everything else. And their children going wayward. Amen. Wearing clothes. They ought from holiness. I'm here to tell you that we better get closer to the God. Amen. Than what we were when brother Brandham was here. We don't know brother Brandham according to the flesh anymore. He's gone. We better get to the one that he was pointing us to. He pointed us to Christ. Let's get to Christ. Where am I going to send you through the brand tabernacle to no? I sent you to Christ. &gt;&gt; If you want to know where you going to be, where you're going to meet to be in the rapture, you're going to have to be in Christ. And Christ has to be in you. How many want to say, "God, I want more of the reality of joy. I want the reality of peace that pass understanding. I want that to be real to me. &gt;&gt; You can have it to be real to you. &gt;&gt; The cycle of revival and death has never failed. All you have to do is recall this last move of God in the spirit. When men and women dressed like Christians, went to church, prayed all night, took to the street corners, and weren't ashamed of the manifestation of the spirit. They left their old dead churches and worshiped in homes or in store buildings. They had reality. Don't talk to me about services going by. Amen. How preachers could preach. Amen. And such an anointing come until people would repent. Amen. That's not just some historical God. I believe that we have ought to have it here this morning. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We want God to be real this morning. Amen. No man knows the things of God saved the spirit and he to whom the spirit of God reveals them. We need to call on God for revelation more than anything else in the world. We have accepted the Bible. I'm putting here. We have accepted the message. We know the message. We understand the message. We read the message. We have accepted the great truth of it. But it's still not real to most people. &gt;&gt; What good does it do to you if it's not real? &gt;&gt; You're still living in a mystical world of your imagination. But when God comes down, how many believes the Holy Ghost is real? &gt;&gt; When you repent and confess your sins, Amen. And the Holy Spirit comes down in there, there's something that takes place. &gt;&gt; There's a supernatural power that's more real than you sitting here. &gt;&gt; How many know that's really the only real things? Hallelujah. Think about it. Everything that's really real is the things we can't see right now. The baptism of the Holy Spirit giving him more of you. See God come down in a greater way. Oh, wish to God that I open up the eyes of Amen. Our eyes to be able to see the Holy Spirit coming down &gt;&gt; in every heart that wants him right now. Every young person that wants to experience God in a real way. &gt;&gt; Amen. in a reality. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's real. Real joy. &gt;&gt; If you want joy, real joy, wonderful joy, let Jesus come into your heart. Oh, I read a quote this morning. Oh my. Where brother Abraham said this here that Christ is coming. It is real. Nobody has ever been able to come and disprove what Jesus is doing. Many have tried it. But he says this thing is this is real. This is the real manifestation of Jesus Christ in our generation in our day. And it ought to what? Do what? What it ought to do to us? He said make us the happiest people on the face of the earth. that you're following something real, not something fake. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every time you go to the grocery store and you give them a $100 bill, what do they do? &gt;&gt; They check it for reality. &gt;&gt; Authenticity. Isn't that right? They'll either rub that little old marker on it or they'll put it up to something. Let's see if this is real. &gt;&gt; That's right. How many believe that's the way ought we do when we come to church. Amen. To present ourselves before God. Amen. Let's see if we're really real or not. Put us in front of that mirror. Amen. See if we see our reflection in that Bible. Amen. When the preacher preaches, Amen. s talk about joy unspeakable and full of glory. You talk about peace that passes understanding. That's right, brother Father. I'm looking in the mirror. That's me. &gt;&gt; That's me. &gt;&gt; Not just some day going by. &gt;&gt; Some historical god. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you imagine Samson picking a fight with the Philistines? You know he picked a fight, right? He was looking for a fight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Looking for some way to justly kill half of them. And he finally got his way. Can you imagine if he stood in front of them thousand Philistines says, "I'm going to whoop every last one of y'all. I'mma whoop all of you. You're right. &gt;&gt; He says, "Bring it. Bring it." And they come at him. And it said he slew them heaps upon heaps. Heaps upon heaps. They had to crawl over top of the dead ones to get to him. Amen. Then there'd be another pile and then another pile and another pile. How many believe them hard-headed Philistines had reality check? Goliath had a hard reality check that the power of God is greater than his psychology and his biceps. The power in the name of God is greater. Woo! How many believe this morning cancer, Amen, is going to get a reality check. Amen. You ain't got no right here. Depression, you ain't got no right here. You're getting a reality check this morning. Get on out of here. You're not going to bring me down. You're not going to depress me. You're not going to bring my joint out. &gt;&gt; You're not You're not going to quieten this church up. &gt;&gt; I don't care how much CO you bring around. I don't care what you have. Boom. Then we by his stripes we are healed. You just make me a child a little more because of his healing power. How many believe you ought to do that? you get healed from something, you ought to give God a little bit of glory. &gt;&gt; You ought to give him a little praise. &gt;&gt; It's got to be more than just in your mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care if you have it just in your mind. You go over and over and over until it drops down into your heart and then it becomes a reality. &gt;&gt; Now I know what you're talking about. Paul said, "Nobody can talk speaking by the Holy Ghost calls Jesus the Christ." And nobody can call Jesus the Christ but by the Holy Ghost. In other words, you don't even know him. &gt;&gt; You do not know him until you have him in here. Then you know him. &gt;&gt; You know him mentally. And that's not good enough. &gt;&gt; That's the way Peter and them knew him. They knew him mentally and and knew his actions. But after the day of Pentecost, then they really knew what God was like. &gt;&gt; Amen. You understand how he believes that &gt;&gt; Steven when he was being stoned, they were killing him. He had so much of God in him. He knew so much about what it was like to be Jesus like to be God. I hope this is not too heavy. And I believe it's right. You know what it's like to be God. You know what it's like to be God. Why? Because where is he? &gt;&gt; Living his life out through you. So, you know, it's not hard to forgive people that sin against you. It's not hard to forgive cuz why? You refuse to hold a grudge. You refuse to be unforgiven. Oh, bitterness. Jesus said on the cross, "Forgive them, father, for they don't know what they do." Steven, when he was being stoned, he said the same thing. Don't lay this to their charge. Hello. I'll go ahead and make the statement. Most people that are doing you wrong are spiritually blind to what they're doing. They're so caught up in that spirit that they'll use a quote to justify themselves. &gt;&gt; Now, that's blind, folks. They don't know what they're doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. How about them witches that had that table up there. Amen. Challenging the prophet. Amen. If he had the power to bring it down, he used his name, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost name, and everything else. But when he'd come down and like take them legs off, they had a reality check. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; How many believe that this world is going to have a reality check? When the fire falls, the tribulation, amen, they'll go to the rocks and the hills. Amen. Say, "Hide us from the face." To him that said, "Oh, they're going to know God's coming." &gt;&gt; I don't care how much they try to fool themselves. They're going to know they got it coming. &gt;&gt; On the day of judgment, in the days of Noah, they had a reality check. Ah, you crazy man with your boat up on top of a hill. Crazy. But when the thunder struck and when the water comes up over their curbs, comes up into their houses, they had a reality check in their mind. This guy was right. &gt;&gt; Oh, how many churches, how many preachers, how many people out there that seen the acts of the Jesus Christ through the prophet in this hour knew the tapes were right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're in for a reality check when they're left in the tribulation period. When they come over there, they're going to be having a reality check. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Every soul, every knee is going to have a reality check. &gt;&gt; Shall bow, every mouth shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. I believe that everybody's going to have a reality check. Oh my, I want mine this morning. How many is with me? Say, God, I want a reality check. Don't you let me live in some fantasy of just trying to go to church to make myself feel better. God, it's got to be your literal life on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. God help us. God help me. I want to be real. Amen. &gt;&gt; I know y'all are with me on that. I Amen. Amen. Look up that song if you will. My God is real. He's real in my soul. &gt;&gt; For he has washed and he's made me whole. Amen. Praise the Lord. False gods, false salvation, myths, dreams. My my the whole world is full of the phony of the substitutes. &gt;&gt; And if there's anything I could do this morning, anything I could say and to myself is search your heart. &gt;&gt; Search your soul. See what your desires are. See where your passion is, where your treasure is, what you love more than anything else. Find out if your nature has been changed. See if your spirit is more powerful than your flesh. Hello. See where you're at with God. Don't fool yourself. &gt;&gt; Don't be fooled. Don't be satisfied with some substitute that do the devil would offer &gt;&gt; because it's full of it. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. In closing, I want to repeat just a little bit something. Young people especially, pray for revelation. Pray for revelation. That revelation Jesus said to Peter, he says, "Who what has revealed this to you? My father in heaven has revealed this to you." He says, "And upon this rock, I'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." Pray for God to personally reveal himself to you. Fill you with the Holy Spirit so that you can know the joy. Your mom and dad will help you through your trials and everything you go through. But when you become an adult, guess what? You may not have your mom and dad. You have to learn to fight your battles. &gt;&gt; You have to learn to think the right thoughts. when you're going through trials, when you're going through things, when you're going through temptation, how to resist. Hello. How to dedicate yourself to God on a daily basis to have a personal prayer life every day, a &gt;&gt; personal walk with God. &gt;&gt; Because remember, it's not a church thing. It's a individual thing &gt;&gt; with every individual. &gt;&gt; Amen. his saving power, his forgiveness power, his filling power, his delivering power. &gt;&gt; I'll How many in here have went come to places? I know Irvin's have with Troy. Troy has, Brother Joe, Hannah, just a lot of us. I have many times come up to places to where you really did all you can. you. Anything you possibly can do, you'll do, but it just doesn't seem to change. It's just a wall. Don't know how you're going to get through it. Hello. Not enough to drive you crazy, but praise be to God. What does it do? It drives you not crazy, but to your knees. And you know what it's like to not be able to get over it, under it, or around it. &gt;&gt; And then what do you do? I want to just say just relax. Just relax. Don't bite all your fingernails off. Commit it to God. But Bram says that's he got come to that place. Many place. Commit it to God and watch God take you through. &gt;&gt; How many's been there? If you've been there, give God a hand. Say, "Thank you, Lord. You took me through." &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; We didn't have to dig a hole for you. You made it through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you do, if we do have to dig a hole for you or for me, praise God anyway. &gt;&gt; Why? Because I've got a better house. I'm in a better place. You ain't got nothing to fear, church, when you're in God's hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, he's glad for that. &gt;&gt; Never fear. Don't fear. I just had a quote on that. Brother Bam says, "No matter how many atomic bombs, no matter what's going or coming," he says, "you're in his hands. You don't have to worry about nothing. We are in his control. He is at the wheel." He said, "God is at the wheel." How many believes God is at the wheel of your life? &gt;&gt; He's at the wheel of my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's real. &gt;&gt; I thank God for that reality. The reality of Jesus Christ. Not Jacob Emmen, Men of Simon, Martin Luther, John Wesley, Pentecost or Isuza Street. Hello. But this message, it lives on. Amen. How many believes that the message didn't die with Brother Brandham? Brother Bham's message is not an age gone by. Don't never let a preacher come up here and say, "Well, now that was in Brother Brandham's day, Brother Bram's age." And I'm going to tell you why I say that just now as it's coming. And I'll tell you why that is. It's because Brother Brandham said, "These tapes will live on." &gt;&gt; And that how many believe that this message don't die. It's not some This is our age. There's no other message. And this message lives on. these tapes will live on. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe, how many believe it's going to take us to a transformation? &gt;&gt; Amen. When the world's on fire, don't you want God's bosom to be your pillow? When the world is just falling apart and it's getting where it is at, I want to have it to be a reality in my life. One of these days, we'll be changed in the moment, in the twinkling of an eye. How many looking for the rapture to be a reality? &gt;&gt; That's right. Not just a myth, but it'll be a reality to us one of these days. Musicians, come on up if you will stand with me. I want to ask a couple questions. You be honest, eyes closed. Is there any this morning that just really maybe you're just pretty far away from God? Young people, old people, don't matter. And God's just not really real to you. You'd like to raise your hand, say, "I want God to be real to me. &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. God bless you." Hands all over. Jesus sees your hand. &gt;&gt; And I'm believing as your pastor that God is going to deal with your heart. You just watch. You just watch this coming week. you that's got your hand up, I believe God's going to answer that prayer because Christianity has what you have need of. Christ has what you have need of and you need Christ to be a greater reality in your life. He wants to be a greater reality than a lot of times we allow him to be. &gt;&gt; God bless you. How about those who do know God, but you want to know him in a greater reality. God, I want a greater reality. Lord, in a deeper walk with you, Lord, a closer walk, Father. &gt;&gt; So, we ask God, as we all raise our hands to you this morning, we pray in the name of Jesus Christ, that Lord, you'll reveal yourself in a greater way, Lord, to our hearts and to our lives, Lord. And help us to realize that all these natural things, God, they're not real. The only real thing is you. It's your spirit. It's you living in our life, Lord. The life that I now live, I live by the faith of the son of God. God, that's the reality that we desire this morning in our lives. That we could say like Paul, father, the life I now live, it's not my life, but it's his life. Help me not to spend so much time. Help me not to focus so much on the things that aren't real. Help me to focus more on my prayer life and my dedication to you, Lord, and saying, "God, I want you to be more real in my life." Just as Peter as he had that Holy Ghost when he came to the impotent man, amen, on the way to the temple and said, "Silver and gold, we have none, but in the name of Jesus, such as we have, we give to you. Rise up and walk, oh Lord, let the church have that, Father. Oh, burn, burn, Holy Spirit, burn in me. You set my soul on fire. Fill me with the Holy Ghost and God's full desire. Make me like the Christ of old, healing and raising the dead. Oh, give me the power that Jesus had through the blood that was shed. Father, this morning that's our heart's cry. Lord, help us be original. Help us all to be real. Lord, we don't, none of us want to put on, be a fake or a mimic. We want to be the genuine article, Lord. We raise our hands in surrenderance to you, Lord, and ask, God, that in the coming days, Lord, you'll make yourself more real to us than what we've ever known. And Lord, we don't know just how you'll do it, but we'll be aware and we'll be ready and we'll be waiting for you to give that answer to those cries this morning in Jesus name. Did everybody say it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Give the Lord a hand and say, "Thank you, Jesus, for talking to us, Lord. Thank you, Lord, for coming, Lord, and help us and inspiring us, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord." Amen. Have you got that song up? I may try to help sing that just a little bit as before we turn. Well, my God is real. He's really in my soul. My God is real for he has washed me. His love for me is like your God. My God is real for I can feel him in my soul. You are something not know [Music] [Music] that God is real for I can feel. Oh yes, my God is real. He's real in my soul. My God is real. For he has washed and he's made me whole. [Music] His love for me. It's like we're gold. My God is real. For I can feel him in my soul and some folk may die. Some folk may score. All can go on and leave me alone. But as for me, I'll take God's part. And God is real. For I can feel him in my heart. My God is real. Oh yes, he's real in my heart. My God is real for he has and he's made me whole. His love for me is like gold. My God is real for I can't feel him in my heart. And I cannot tell just how you felt when Jesus took your sins away. But since that day, oh, since that hour, God has been real. For I can feel his holy power. Oh, my God is real. He's real in my soul. My God is real. for he has washed and he made daily me oh his love for me. It's like we're gone. God is real for I can feel you in my soul. Amen. Is he real to you this morning? Amen. Did you enjoy the word this morning? My, what an awesome message this morning. And Amen. Aren't you just so thankful that he lives in your heart and life this morning? Amen. God bless you this morning. We appreciate each and every one is here and our visitors. God bless you all this morning. And Amen. Amen. Just remember the service Wednesday night at 7:00. Come expecting. And and as we go this morning, let's sing this little song. I'm so glad that Jesus set me free. as you go this morning. Well, I'm so glad, God bless you, that Jesus set me free. Well, I'm so glad that Jesus set me free.
