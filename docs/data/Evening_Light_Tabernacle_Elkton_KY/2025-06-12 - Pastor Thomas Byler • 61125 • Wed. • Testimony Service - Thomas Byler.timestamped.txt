[34:28] always there for me. Amen. Well, I
[34:31] started out traveling for the Lord many
[34:34] years ago.
[34:38] Well, I had a lot of heartache, had a
[34:41] lot of grief, and oh,
[34:46] and when I would stumble and then I
[34:48] would tumble down,
[34:53] and then I would say it wouldn't take
[34:56] nothing for my journey now.
[34:59] Well, I wouldn't take nothing for my
[35:02] journey now.
[35:04] Got to make it to heaven somehow. Though
[35:08] the devil keeps me and he tries to turn
[35:11] me around.
[35:14] Oh, he's offered everything that's got a
[35:17] name. All the wealth I want.
[35:22] If I could still, I would take nothing
[35:24] for my journey now.
[35:28] Well, there's nothing in the world that
[35:31] could ever take the place of God's love.
[35:36] All the silver and gold couldn't by
[35:39] mighty touch from above.
[35:43] When my soul needs healing, then I begin
[35:46] to feel his power.
[35:50] And I'd say, "Thank the Lord. I wouldn't
[35:53] take nothing for my journey now."
[35:57] Well, I wouldn't take nothing.
[36:02] Got to make it to heaven somehow. Though
[36:05] the devil tempts me and he tries to turn
[36:08] me around.
[36:11] Oh, he's offered everything. He's got a
[36:15] name. All the wealth I want. World and
[36:18] fame. If I could still, I wouldn't take
[36:21] nothing for my journey now. I sing it
[36:25] again. Well, I wouldn't take nothing for
[36:28] my journey now.
[36:30] Got to make it to heaven somehow. Though

[38:28] my soul would be lost.
[38:34] And I'm so glad
[38:37] he was willing
[38:40] to drink that bitter cup. Although he
[38:45] prayed, "Father, let it pass from me."
[38:53] And I'm so glad he didn't call a
[38:59] heaven's angels
[39:03] from my hands to pull the nails that
[39:08] torment me.
[39:12] Who had enough
[39:15] for a place called Mount Calvary?

[39:28] cross.

[40:05] cross
[40:09] and had it not been
[40:12] for a man
[40:14] called Jesus.

[44:07] we're so grateful, Lord Jesus, that
[44:09] Father, for some of us, for myself,
[44:13] Lord, that was many, many, many years
[44:15] ago, Father, when I put my hope, my
[44:18] trust in you, and it was forever more,
[44:21] Lord Jesus. And we're still in that
[44:22] forever more. Lord, we're so grateful,
[44:25] God, to have a God like you that we can
[44:27] put our hope and our confidence and our
[44:29] trust in. Lord, what would we do if we
[44:31] didn't have you, Lord Jesus? We would go
[44:33] crazy just like the rest of the world,
[44:36] Father. But Lord, we ask God tonight as
[44:38] we've assembled ourselves together. We
[44:40] desire, Lord Jesus, that you'll come
[44:42] down and let your Holy Spirit have the
[44:43] preeminence in service, Lord. We ask God
[44:46] that you would take every spin spirit
[44:48] under the control of the Holy Spirit. so
[44:51] that you could have your way in every
[44:52] testimony that's given, Lord Jesus. We
[44:55] ask God that your name would be
[44:57] glorified, that you'd be worshiped, Lord
[44:59] Jesus. That you'd be lifted up, Lord
[45:01] Jesus, and that the body of Christ would
[45:03] be edified, Lord Jesus, by the things
[45:05] that are said this evening. We commit
[45:07] this service to you now in Jesus' name.

[45:29] what you think, but anyway, it's going
[45:32] to be good. Amen. So, praise the Lord.

[45:57] are calling for a 88% chance of showers,
[46:00] but it'll be dry enough down there that

[46:06] come and uh uh uh come earlier or
[46:09] whatever to get out on the lake or
[46:11] whatever you want, you're welcome to

[46:15] majority, we'll just make it at 10:30.
[46:17] Donna, is 10:30 good? Start at 10:30.
[46:20] All right. We'll just start maybe at
[46:22] 10:30 and then everybody bring a dish
[46:24] like we usually do. If you would bring a
[46:26] chair, we're going to have a couple
[46:27] chairs. Uh maybe or a couple of the
[46:30] benches down by the creek. Amen. For you
[46:32] to sit on and a picnic table. Um so I
[46:36] wanted to ask a couple of the young men
[46:38] if you would. I've got my trailer out
[46:39] there. I need one picnic table and two
[46:43] benches if you would. All right. I need
[46:45] those loaded up after service if you
[46:46] could for me so that we could get those
[46:49] down there. Amen. But we're looking
[46:51] forward to it. Amen. How many loves to
[46:52] fellowship one with another? Amen. If it
[46:55] rains out, we'll go out to the garage
[46:56] and fellowship in the house and
[46:58] fellowship whatever we can find room
[47:00] for. Ain't that right? So hopefully
[47:02] everybody can come. Amen. I know not
[47:04] everybody can because we've all got
[47:06] something going. some somebody got
[47:08] something going, right? So, it's hard to
[47:10] get everybody to be able to come, but I
[47:12] I'm praying, Lord Jesus, just help the
[47:14] weather to be good. Ain't that right?
[47:15] So, amen. So, that's uh for Saturday.
[47:20] Amen. And um so,
[47:24] I want to, you know, you go back after
[47:27] preaching. Amen. And you I know Sunday I
[47:30] was looking for that punchline punchline
[47:32] quote. Amen. And I couldn't find it. So
[47:35] when I got home, I went to looking for
[47:37] it. And I said, "Where was that at?
[47:38] Where was my punch line at?" Amen. I
[47:41] found it. So if y'all bear with me, I'd
[47:42] like to finish the punch line. Is that
[47:44] okay? Talking about emotion, right?
[47:47] Amen. Emotion in church and and all of
[47:49] all that we do. Amen. And what Brother
[47:51] Brandham said about it. Amen. And I
[47:53] found it in the in the quote where he
[47:55] talks about we find amongst a lot of
[47:57] people where emotions and so forth is a
[48:00] lot of times there's people people that
[48:02] are super emotional. Of course, you
[48:03] know, uh there tends to be tattlings,
[48:06] backbitings, and things like that. Amen.
[48:08] And people spirit of men, women going
[48:10] amongst one another. Oh, this ain't
[48:12] right and that ain't right. And he says,
[48:14] most of the time it's the person that's
[48:16] causing the stir. That's not right.
[48:18] Ain't that right now? So, and it was
[48:20] right after that. It was the final, it
[48:22] was the finishing of it, amen, of that
[48:24] quote. Amen. Is what I was really
[48:26] looking for. See, because how many knows
[48:28] that God hates discord among brethren?
[48:32] Amen. Amen. And I thought our theme for
[48:34] tonight would be uh our theme tonight.
[48:36] Amen. In testifying is about edifying
[48:39] the body of Christ. How many wants to be
[48:42] edify the body of Christ? We don't want
[48:44] to be a cancer. We don't want to be a
[48:46] hindrance. We want to be do something
[48:47] that would edify the body of Christ. If
[48:50] you know something's wrong somewhere,
[48:51] whatever. Amen. You want to try to do it
[48:53] in the Holy Spirit way to build that up.
[48:56] Ain't that right? Amen. Certainly, we
[48:58] don't want to make things worse. But God
[49:00] hates discord among among brethren. Then
[49:03] brothers Brandham says, "Be reverent. Be
[49:06] holy. Love God." Now I remembered that
[49:09] he's going to end up with emotions.
[49:11] Be reverent. Be holy. Amen. And and I
[49:17] missed the part about how many brother
[49:18] Bam talking about uh how the church used
[49:21] to be sweet and loving, you know, when
[49:23] he preached the lamb and the dove. He
[49:25] says, "Make sure you always have that
[49:26] sweet and gentle spirit." Amen. Because
[49:29] it's easy to get that spirit I don't
[49:31] know it just because it it can be it can
[49:34] almost anything can cause your spirit to
[49:37] change can it? Amen. Whether it's
[49:39] problems or something major come up. So
[49:42] and it's hardest thing sometimes to keep
[49:44] your spirit from getting upset. Amen. So
[49:48] I believe part of spiritual maturity is
[49:51] keeping your spirit in check. Amen. He
[49:54] that ruleth his spirit is mightier than
[49:56] he that taketh a city.
[49:59] Amen. So, praise the Lord. All right.
[50:01] Not going to preach tonight, but be
[50:03] holy. Love God. Stand by him. He says,
[50:06] "And as long as you know that your life
[50:08] is divvying up with the Bible, with
[50:11] purity of heart, purity of thought, love
[50:14] towards your brother, trying your best
[50:16] to up the kingdom of God, and doing
[50:19] those things, dressing right, living
[50:21] right, talking right, going to the right
[50:24] places, then you can have all the
[50:26] emotions that you want.
[50:28] Amen. I thought that was a good
[50:29] punchline, didn't you? And everybody
[50:32] will believe it. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[50:34] I do feel, you know, I feel, you know, I
[50:37] I got to go by a little bit by feelings.
[50:39] You know, the prophet of God, he could
[50:40] come and tell you, you know, there's a
[50:42] change in his ministry, but I feel like
[50:44] the Lord's going to change my ministry
[50:47] just a little bit. I believe it's going
[50:48] to take a turn. Amen. And so, y'all pray
[50:51] for me. Amen. And uh you'll feel it.
[50:54] You'll know what I'm talking about.
[50:56] Amen. But uh it's just God moving. Amen.
[51:00] And I believe that I believe that God
[51:02] keeps moving us on and on and on and on
[51:05] and changing us. Amen. Because that's
[51:07] what it's all about. Amen.
[51:10] So, praise the Lord.
[51:13] Amen. I want to read a scripture. Stand
[51:15] with me. The scripture, how many knows,
[51:16] brother Brand? There may be different
[51:18] ones, you know, maybe brother Ed Wardo,
[51:20] maybe he'll read a scripture. I don't
[51:21] know. But I want to make sure we read a
[51:22] scripture because we know that no no
[51:24] service is complete without reading of
[51:26] scriptures. Brother Ram said, "I right."
[51:28] So in Ephesians 4:10 and 16. So tonight,
[51:32] Brother Ed, I uh if you take all the
[51:35] time, you take all the time. We'll take
[51:37] next Wednesday and have another
[51:38] testimony service. So just whatever God
[51:40] laid on your heart, testify, take your
[51:42] time. Amen. And then if you have time,
[51:44] Amen. of I'm sure that a lot of us have
[51:46] a testimony also. However, I have one
[51:49] before you. Amen. that I want to let
[51:52] have for the church. Amen. And it is it
[51:55] is quite a testimony. Amen. Praise the
[51:58] Lord. So in chapter 4 of Ephesians and
[52:03] we'll begin with verse 10, he that
[52:06] descended is also the same also that
[52:09] ascended far above the heavens that he
[52:12] might fill all things. And he gave some
[52:15] apostles, some prophets, some
[52:17] evangelists, some pastors and teachers
[52:20] for the perfecting of the saints, for
[52:22] the work of the ministry, for the
[52:23] edifying of the body of Christ. How many
[52:26] believe that's what the five-fold
[52:27] ministry, that's what any of us wants to
[52:30] be is somebody that edifies the body of
[52:33] Christ till we all come into the unity
[52:36] of the faith and of the knowledge of the
[52:38] son of God unto a perfect man, unto the
[52:41] measure, the stature, the fullness of
[52:42] Christ. Amen. And I can't help but think
[52:45] about Enoch. Ain't that right? That he
[52:47] walked with God and he was not. I can't
[52:50] help but believe that the bride is going
[52:51] to come to the place to where she walks
[52:53] with God and then she is not. How many
[52:56] wants to be ready for the rapture?
[52:58] That's what we want to ready be ready
[52:59] for. Amen. that we henceforth be no more
[53:02] children tossed to and fro and carried
[53:04] about with every wind of doctrine by the
[53:06] slight of men and cunning craftiness
[53:08] whereby they lie in weight to deceive,
[53:10] but speaking the truth in love, may grow
[53:12] up into him all things which is the
[53:14] head, even Christ, from whom the whole
[53:17] body fitly jointed together, and
[53:20] compacted by that by that which every
[53:23] joint supplieth, according to effectual
[53:26] working of the measure of every part,
[53:28] making increase of the body, unto the
[53:31] edifying of itself in love. And uh
[53:34] without preaching tonight, that's
[53:37] scripture talking about uh that body,
[53:40] each joint fitly fitting together.
[53:44] You imagine trying to eat without arms,
[53:48] no arms. How many know there's people
[53:50] like that? They don't have any arms.
[53:52] That'd be a terrible, terrible, terrible
[53:54] way to try to eat. But Amen. the B the
[53:57] arm. Amen. It's wonderful have arm, but
[53:59] this wouldn't do much good if you didn't
[54:01] have a hand. Amen.
[54:05] We read the scriptures. You could keep
[54:07] you standing all night. But Amen. If you
[54:09] didn't have a hand, then guess what? How
[54:11] many knows those fingers serve a
[54:12] purpose? And that is the way you and I
[54:14] are sitting here tonight. Amen. At a
[54:17] local body of believers, each one has a
[54:20] part. And when everybody does their
[54:22] part, oh my, I'll tell you what, it just
[54:24] grabs that spoon just perfectly. It dips
[54:27] it right down in there. Amen. The mouth,
[54:29] the jaw opens. Just good. It's thankful
[54:32] for every part of the body. Amen. Praise
[54:35] the Lord.
[54:37] Amen.
[54:41] So, I have already uh shared a little
[54:45] bit with a couple of my minister
[54:48] brethren. Amen. But we've not put this
[54:51] out. Amen.
[54:54] uh because I wanted to save it for
[54:55] tonight basically. Amen. And
[55:00] first of all, I want to give a report a
[55:02] little bit on Sister Parish. Sister
[55:04] Parish, a few weeks ago, me and my wife
[55:06] went and visited her. Amen. At her home
[55:08] before she uh went to the hospital and
[55:10] removed 3.8, I think it is liters of
[55:14] fluid off of her stomach. Now, how many
[55:16] know a 2 liter bottle? Three lers. Now,
[55:19] almost four. That is a lot of liquid,
[55:22] isn't it? And before that it was like
[55:24] two liters. Before that it was like one
[55:26] liter. So it was one, two, and then
[55:29] almost four. And so things weren't
[55:32] looking so good. I was concerned. Ain't
[55:34] that right? I was concerned for our
[55:36] sister. I really was. And uh so she's
[55:39] been at the nursing home for now uh for
[55:42] the last eight days, I guess it is. And
[55:45] it's been about 12 days since she's had
[55:48] her liquid removed. and we went and seen
[55:51] her today and uh you know she does look
[55:55] and she looks like she may have a liter
[55:57] liter and a half at the most maybe
[55:58] somewhere there. That's just my guess
[56:01] but it's not very much you know and for
[56:04] that amount of time for her to not have
[56:06] built up anymore that's a great sign of
[56:08] improvement. Amen. So now the other part
[56:12] is you should see her just her your uh
[56:16] her demeanor. She's got a strength more
[56:18] strength. She'll cut up with you and and
[56:22] laugh. Brother Steven Becky went seen
[56:24] her uh earlier today also. And if
[56:26] anybody wants to see her, I think she's
[56:27] going to get out Saturday, but if
[56:29] anybody wants to stop by, you can go see
[56:31] her there. But uh she is a whole lot
[56:34] more chipper and they're uh they're
[56:37] walking her and pushing her and then
[56:39] she's walking up and down down the
[56:40] aisles and she's bragging about that and
[56:43] they said, you know, before they can
[56:44] send her home that she has to learn how
[56:46] to get up. So they were trying to teach
[56:48] her how to get up and she says, "Well, I
[56:50] just rolled over on my knees and hands
[56:52] and got up, you know." And so they were
[56:54] like, "Well, okay. All right. As long as
[56:56] you can get up, you know." So, but I you
[56:59] know having seen her today. Amen. Two
[57:02] weeks ago I had posted not just on the
[57:04] men but me on the men but down I posted
[57:06] on the web top. So everybody that prayed
[57:08] thank you so much. Amen. Because she's
[57:10] really trying to have faith and she's
[57:12] had faith and and different times. She
[57:14] said it's so hard time. She said it's so
[57:16] hard. She said it's so hard when you
[57:17] feel like you're about to die to have
[57:19] faith. But she's got that bulldog faith
[57:21] and she's held on. So may God lift her
[57:24] up. Amen. Now um
[57:29] this is the
[57:31] very special testimony.
[57:33] Um
[57:35] as you know
[57:37] my wife you know about eight months ago
[57:41] was report you know um diagnosed with
[57:44] cancer and so forth and and when it came
[57:47] to the lymph nodes and things like that.
[57:49] Now, this last time we talked about
[57:52] lymph nodes and her not having cancer in
[57:54] her lymph nodes, but I wanted to make it
[57:55] clear because whenever I give a report
[57:57] or hear a report, I like for you to be
[58:00] straight. I I don't want to exaggerate.
[58:02] Hello. Uh don't make it sound like
[58:04] something it isn't, but when they took
[58:06] her uterus out and had that surgery,
[58:09] they took like four at least four lymph
[58:11] nodes out. So, when we said those lymph
[58:13] nodes, she was no cancer free from lymph
[58:15] nodes, we weren't talking about the
[58:17] whole body. We were talking about those
[58:18] lymph nodes that they took out during
[58:20] that time in that area. You know,
[58:22] because the doctor had said when I asked
[58:24] him at first when she was first
[58:26] diagnosed on the lymph nodes how many,
[58:28] he said there's too many to count. He
[58:30] said there's too many to count that are
[58:32] cancerous. And so, uh, we did a finally
[58:36] did a CAT scan and a PET scan about
[58:39] y'all know when it was I don't know
[58:40] exact time, but it was at least three,
[58:42] four weeks ago. And the doctor sent
[58:44] Grace a report. Amen. And and of course
[58:47] we had to just look at the numbers and
[58:48] we can't read some of that stuff, you
[58:50] know, but the doctor never I was kind of
[58:52] I was like give me give me a call talk
[58:55] tell me something. But we just didn't
[58:56] really worry about it. And so but from
[58:59] the numbers that we was looking at
[59:01] looked like maybe the mass on her breast
[59:03] maybe had depreciated per 50% or
[59:06] something. At least the numbers were
[59:08] about half of what they were. It looked
[59:09] good anyway. And so we let you all know
[59:11] that it looks like it's you know
[59:12] depreciated a lot. But today after
[59:15] talking to him after he looked over the
[59:18] PET scan or what they called the bone
[59:20] scan and also uh the CAT scan. They did
[59:22] a boat PET scan and a CAT scan I think
[59:25] the first same day, right, Donna? I
[59:28] think we went to one place and then we
[59:29] went to the other. But anyway, so he
[59:31] called yesterday and had a phone
[59:33] conference. the first one that we didn't
[59:35] go all the way to Evansville and talk to
[59:37] him just, you know, just to talk to him
[59:39] about 10 15 minutes and he had just had
[59:41] a conference and uh but he uh he told us
[59:45] what's going on. Amen. And so I've
[59:49] talked to I've sent a few texts to
[59:51] brother uh Andrew Spencer, I think it
[59:54] was, and brother Joe Adams. And so uh I
[59:57] let him know that we're going to have
[59:58] this testimony. Amen. Then that Donna is
[1:00:01] going to be given the testimony and
[1:00:03] basically it's going to be her testimony
[1:00:05] of of the report uh that the doctor gave
[1:00:08] of the cancer that was uh of course in
[1:00:11] her upper on her bones which was her up
[1:00:14] you know on he said it was on her spine
[1:00:16] up higher. Amen. And brother Brad
[1:00:18] remembers when she was in the office and
[1:00:19] it really hurt back there up on the
[1:00:22] higher part. And many times she's had a
[1:00:24] I've had to help her out of bed and
[1:00:26] different times that it was really
[1:00:27] hurting even in the lower abdomen area
[1:00:30] uh pelvic area I guess it was you know
[1:00:31] and so he said you've got it here there
[1:00:34] u you know and so it's going she's going
[1:00:38] to tell you about the bone she's going
[1:00:39] to talk about they had spots all the
[1:00:41] doctor talked like she had a lot of
[1:00:43] spots on her lungs and also in her lymph
[1:00:46] nodes a lot of her nymph nodes um lungs
[1:00:50] and nip road nymph nodes foods and of
[1:00:52] course the breast and also the bone. So
[1:00:55] I want her to come up and if y'all would
[1:00:58] make sure that you know you get the
[1:00:59] video on her if you would and she I'm
[1:01:01] going to have her come up here. Amen.
[1:01:03] And give the report. How many wants to
[1:01:04] hear reports? Let's find out what's
[1:01:07] going on.
[1:01:25] Well, first off, I'm glad he said as
[1:01:27] long as everything's lined up, you can
[1:01:29] have all the emotions you want. So,
[1:01:33] but I uh I just want to thank the Lord.
[1:01:35] I want to praise the Lord for my
[1:01:37] healing. Um because just from the very
[1:01:41] start, that's what he just let me know
[1:01:44] that it wasn't mine that you know. So
[1:01:48] anyway, like he said, we had the uterus
[1:01:51] removed and they didn't find anything
[1:01:54] there. I kept the report and I keep it
[1:01:56] in my purse
[1:01:58] and um so yesterday he called and we had
[1:02:01] like he said a conference and he um he
[1:02:05] wanted to know how I was feeling and I
[1:02:07] said I'm feeling awesome. you know, I
[1:02:09] said, I go, you know, I do, you know,
[1:02:12] and um he says, well, he says, you know,
[1:02:14] he wanted to talk, you know, let me know
[1:02:17] about the the results of the scan. And
[1:02:21] um he said that in the scan, the way
[1:02:24] they tell the difference like for the
[1:02:26] bone, he said, is they'll take the scan
[1:02:29] from before and then they take the scan
[1:02:31] that they took. And in the scan before
[1:02:35] is when they saw that the can where the
[1:02:38] cancer was on the bones. Well, now
[1:02:42] comparing the scan that they took this
[1:02:45] time to that scan, he said it shows
[1:02:48] activity, but it's like the bone is
[1:02:51] healing itself and we know it's just
[1:02:54] gone. So just the cancer was not there.
[1:02:57] Yeah. That the cancer wasn't there. It's
[1:02:59] the bone that is healing over those
[1:03:01] places. And then he said there's no
[1:03:05] activity in lymph nodes.
[1:03:18] And and here's where I just say
[1:03:23] Goliath is dead because there's no spots
[1:03:26] on my lungs anymore.
[1:03:32] Amen. Amen. Stand up. Say, "Thank you,
[1:03:35] Lord Jesus." Yes. Thank you, Lord.
[1:03:39] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Just praise your
[1:03:41] name. Okay.
[1:03:45] And
[1:03:46] Yes. And then also the mass is in the
[1:03:51] breast area is significantly
[1:03:53] reduced and it is responding to
[1:03:56] treatment and he said that we'll
[1:03:59] continue with treatment. But I just
[1:04:02] thank the Lord. And I just want to take
[1:04:03] this opportunity too because
[1:04:06] everybody's prayers and the way that
[1:04:09] everybody came together and put their
[1:04:12] faith and God give us his faith and we
[1:04:14] all put it together and joined together.
[1:04:17] Not just our home church here. And I
[1:04:19] love you and I thank y'all so much for
[1:04:21] your prayers and for being there. And I
[1:04:24] think about just everybody that like
[1:04:27] Sister Janette and the different ones. I
[1:04:29] just thank Lord just kick that devil
[1:04:32] back to the hell where he belongs, you
[1:04:34] know. That's right. And I just want to
[1:04:37] thank even like pastors from other
[1:04:39] churches and their congregations. People
[1:04:41] that didn't even know me were praying
[1:04:43] for me like in desperation. And I just
[1:04:46] thank the Lord that we have brothers and
[1:04:49] sisters not just here but all over that
[1:04:52] pray for us. And when we pray, we may
[1:04:54] not know who we're praying for, but God
[1:04:56] knows them and he knows what we're
[1:04:58] praying about. So that's right. Always
[1:05:01] pray. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:05:08] [Applause]
[1:05:13] Amen. Amen. God bless. Hallelujah. Thank
[1:05:18] you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Amen.
[1:05:21] That's words came to my that thong that
[1:05:24] came into my heart. He's in the house.
[1:05:27] How many believes he's in the house?
[1:05:28] Amen. And he is working even when we
[1:05:31] don't know. And he's on the job. He's
[1:05:33] doing he's doing what Jesus always does.
[1:05:35] And we appreciate that. Amen. And of
[1:05:37] course I mean I come in from outside and
[1:05:40] I didn't realize she was on the
[1:05:42] conference with him. And so I come in
[1:05:43] about halfway through. Amen. And uh
[1:05:45] begin to quickly record it because I
[1:05:47] wanted to record the whole thing. But I
[1:05:49] didn't get in there quick enough. But he
[1:05:50] explained that this type of cancer, he
[1:05:52] says if the if that cancer, they're
[1:05:55] coming up with things that even if this
[1:05:56] cancer would kind of reject that
[1:05:59] treatment or whatever, there's others
[1:06:00] that he would, you know, go to and
[1:06:02] whatever. But we ultimately believe that
[1:06:04] it's the Lord Jesus Christ healing her.
[1:06:07] How many believes that? That's right.
[1:06:08] That's Jesus Christ.
[1:06:12] [Applause]
[1:06:14] Amen. And when I heard that about the
[1:06:15] lymph nodes because he the doctor had
[1:06:17] said too many to count and then his
[1:06:19] doctor said he said he put it this way.
[1:06:21] He it's just like it's gone. It's just
[1:06:24] gone. Not there anymore. But praise the
[1:06:26] Lord. Amen. So he is Oh my. Amen. Praise
[1:06:31] the Lord. I believe he's getting his
[1:06:33] face pounded. Ain't that right? Praise
[1:06:35] the Lord. So Jesus is winning. Amen.
[1:06:39] Jesus is winning. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:06:41] Thank you, Lord.
[1:06:47] Amen. God bless you. Brother Edward will
[1:06:49] come on up here and share your testimony
[1:06:51] with you. Amen.
[1:07:06] God bless you, brother. Appreciate you.
[1:07:16] May the Lord bless you
[1:07:19] and thank you for this uh wonderful
[1:07:21] opportunity
[1:07:22] not try to testify or anything like that
[1:07:24] but to hear her testimony that's that's
[1:07:28] good
[1:07:30] appreciate uh brother Thomas thank you
[1:07:34] thank you for the opportunity uh it
[1:07:37] takes a quality of man like himself
[1:07:40] myself to do this. He doesn't know me.
[1:07:44] It's just a person that comes to church
[1:07:45] here every so often. He lives in Indiana
[1:07:48] and he's I I asked him about the
[1:07:49] testimony. He said, "Go ahead and do
[1:07:51] it." Well, praise the Lord. Um
[1:07:54] running around traffic and things and
[1:07:56] but we made it. That's the main thing.
[1:07:59] It's been it's been years since I step
[1:08:01] on a pulpit, so it'll be a little
[1:08:03] difficult. Okay. I'm not a preacher. You
[1:08:05] can tell I don't look like a preacher,
[1:08:07] but uh you just pray for me and and uh
[1:08:10] this is a little different type of a
[1:08:12] testimony if I can call it not so much
[1:08:15] of a of a testimony itself. It's it's a
[1:08:17] testimony. It's a real testimony, but
[1:08:19] it's in a different way perhaps that you
[1:08:21] never heard it this way or perhaps
[1:08:23] expressions or things that will be say
[1:08:26] on the testimony that my somebody will
[1:08:28] say, "Well, that was not a testimony.
[1:08:30] That was something else." But there's a
[1:08:31] testimony. Okay. Um uh let we already
[1:08:35] pray. Can can we pray again? Can we get
[1:08:37] on your feet please for a minute and
[1:08:38] we'll pray again.
[1:08:42] Heavenly father Lord God what a
[1:08:44] privilege Lord Jesus it is Lord God to
[1:08:46] come to the house of God and to thank
[1:08:49] you for all the wonderful things that
[1:08:51] you have done for our lives Lord Jesus.
[1:08:54] Life is not is not easy. The prophet
[1:08:56] have declared Lord God and we know and
[1:08:58] we live it. And but we thank you Lord
[1:09:01] Jesus that you have bless us with the
[1:09:04] revelation of your word Lord Jesus that
[1:09:06] everything works for the good for those
[1:09:09] who love you Lord God and we love you
[1:09:11] Lord God. So we thank you again Lord
[1:09:13] Jesus even though we already pray Lord
[1:09:14] God. I personally need your help Lord
[1:09:17] Jesus. I'm nervous Lord God but you can
[1:09:20] take care of that Lord God. I pray that
[1:09:22] you help us this evening and everything
[1:09:24] that I could say or testify, Lord God,
[1:09:27] be for your glory. I pray in the name of
[1:09:30] the Lord Jesus Christ. While you're
[1:09:32] standing, you can turn um to a little
[1:09:35] scripture here. I have a few notes and
[1:09:37] things there, but I kind of have it
[1:09:40] pretty much on memory. Le let's let's
[1:09:42] open on uh Deuteronomy uh chapter 4.
[1:09:45] Okay? And I'm going to read a couple of
[1:09:48] scriptures
[1:09:50] uh to begin the testimony and then we we
[1:09:53] let you be seated. I know you'll be
[1:09:55] standing for for a good while. Uh
[1:09:58] Deuteronomy chapter 4 and we're going to
[1:10:01] go to I have my other Bible and the
[1:10:03] other one is easy to find it. But then
[1:10:05] all of a sudden I thought because my my
[1:10:07] site is not the best and Sharon had a
[1:10:10] different Bible and I said, "Well, let
[1:10:12] me have your Bible." And now I don't I I
[1:10:13] don't find the book, but I'll find it.
[1:10:15] Anyhow, um Deuteronomy chapter 4 and
[1:10:19] we're going to read there um
[1:10:22] vers uh
[1:10:26] uh 7-8 in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:10:29] Christ. And it says like this, for one
[1:10:32] nation is there so great who had God so
[1:10:36] not unto them as the Lord our God is in
[1:10:39] all things that we call upon him for.
[1:10:42] and one nation there is so great that
[1:10:44] had statutes and judgments so righteous
[1:10:48] as all this law which are set before you
[1:10:51] this day. Only take heed to thyself, and
[1:10:55] keep thy soul diligently, lest thou
[1:10:57] forget the things which thine nights
[1:11:00] have seen, lest they depart from thy
[1:11:03] heart all the days of thy life. But
[1:11:06] teach them thy sons and thy sons sons.
[1:11:09] God bless you. You may be seated.
[1:11:13] Um, first of all, I I need to start to
[1:11:16] who we are, right? If Moses comes with a
[1:11:19] testimony and and he says, "Well, I was
[1:11:21] in in in the back of the desert and and
[1:11:24] I'm taking care of this sheep and and
[1:11:26] there's a it's a bush and it's on fire,
[1:11:29] but he needs to identify who is Moses."
[1:11:32] A lot of the people know who Moses was
[1:11:35] and and and he went ahead and gave
[1:11:37] testimony. First of all, we're from
[1:11:40] Mexico. the state of Halisco on the
[1:11:42] Pacific coast. If you know your US
[1:11:45] geographical arena, boy, it's far from
[1:11:48] here. Okay, it's if you know a little
[1:11:51] bit is on the Pacific West, Mexico.
[1:11:53] Okay, Halisco, Wal Laara is the state
[1:11:55] capital. But anyhow, I was born there. I
[1:11:58] kind of grew up in California. I spent
[1:11:59] most of my younger years in California,
[1:12:01] Long Beach, around those places. That's
[1:12:03] a good place to be from. But anyhow,
[1:12:05] California. But anyhow, most of my kids
[1:12:07] were born there. Stephanie, Levi, uh,
[1:12:09] Gethsemane,
[1:12:11] um, now Cher, well, Gerson was born in
[1:12:14] Jeffersonville. She was born in
[1:12:15] California, too, after. But anyhow, so
[1:12:18] growing up in California, not knowing
[1:12:20] the word of God, growing up as
[1:12:22] Catholics, you know, by tradition, by
[1:12:25] culture, you you only know the church
[1:12:27] and you only know the creed and the
[1:12:29] priest and and you don't have a Bible.
[1:12:31] We did have an old Bible there, but it
[1:12:34] was not something that we read at night
[1:12:36] or anything like that. My dad had an old
[1:12:39] Bible that was given to him back in the
[1:12:40] 60s back in California because he travel
[1:12:42] up on the West Coast and places like
[1:12:44] that. And I always think I wish brother
[1:12:46] I wish my dad would have heard of
[1:12:47] Brother Brandon. He was in San Maria,
[1:12:49] San Jose, some of those places where
[1:12:50] brother Brandon was around in the 56, 57
[1:12:54] up to 63 or 64. But then when I go back
[1:12:57] in time and I was thinking I wish my dad
[1:12:58] would have stopped there in Santa Maria
[1:13:00] or San Jose, those places where brother
[1:13:02] Brandon was preaching. Perhaps my dad
[1:13:04] was traveling in a bus and there's a
[1:13:05] prophet on going to a meeting. But he
[1:13:09] never heard from brother Brandon. But I
[1:13:10] I'm glad I did hear um the word of God.
[1:13:13] But anyhow, that's that's part of life.
[1:13:16] When I was about uh I got to give this
[1:13:18] testimony, right? when I was about uh 19
[1:13:22] 20 years old living there in Long Beach,
[1:13:24] California just real close to that place
[1:13:26] where brother Brandon preached uh
[1:13:28] Abraham's faith and those places where
[1:13:30] he speaks about this minister that comes
[1:13:33] out of the place with his people well
[1:13:35] dressed up and when brother Brandon's
[1:13:37] congregation came it was on a straight
[1:13:39] jack his wheelchairs and all that we
[1:13:41] live across the street from there. I
[1:13:43] didn't know that but anyhow I got to
[1:13:45] know that after but I I used to pray
[1:13:47] this way. I don't know. I used to pray
[1:13:48] this way and that was where the building
[1:13:50] was. But anyhow, this is back years ago.
[1:13:53] So, um, back in those days, not knowing
[1:13:56] the word of God, not having the
[1:13:58] revelation of the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:14:01] Uh, there was a neighbor of mine. I used
[1:14:03] to cut my grass and do real clean and
[1:14:04] everything need. I I like things clean
[1:14:06] and stuff like that. I don't have time
[1:14:08] to do it anymore. But back then, I was
[1:14:10] single and I have plenty of time, so I
[1:14:12] can clean the grass straight. Um, so
[1:14:15] anyhow, there was this preacher from
[1:14:16] South America. He would come from work
[1:14:19] uh right around 6:00 and it was like a
[1:14:21] Wednesday evening, Brother Thomas. And
[1:14:23] he will come park his Toyota, go up the
[1:14:25] second story apartment where he lived
[1:14:27] and dress up real nice and get on the
[1:14:30] car and go to church, wife and a
[1:14:32] daughter. I remember there was a little
[1:14:33] girl there. Go to church and and he
[1:14:35] always see a life living before me. He
[1:14:40] always caught my attention. This man
[1:14:43] works hard. I can tell he don't look
[1:14:45] clean. He comes from a construction
[1:14:47] perhaps. And he comes and and and and
[1:14:50] gets ready to go to church. And I
[1:14:52] thought church is a good place to be
[1:14:54] this evening. And I will drive by
[1:14:56] churches and I can hear the singing and
[1:14:58] I can hear the music and and he always
[1:15:00] excite me about church. But I never
[1:15:02] went. But anyhow, one day he he started
[1:15:05] talking to me. One day I was on the
[1:15:06] fence. We was talking. He said, "Well,
[1:15:08] you you need to read your Bible. Do you
[1:15:10] have a Bible?" "No, sir. I don't have a
[1:15:13] Bible." Said, "I'll get you a Bible." He
[1:15:14] gave me a Bible. Um, you know, I'm not
[1:15:17] going to go back in dates and times, but
[1:15:19] this is I'm I'm 49. I was about 19. So,
[1:15:22] a long time back. You can make the
[1:15:23] numbers later on. Okay? But anyhow, he
[1:15:26] um he told me, he said, "You just pray
[1:15:30] in the name of the Lord Jesus, and
[1:15:32] you'll see that God will make things
[1:15:34] happen for you."
[1:15:37] I'm assuming he had an understanding and
[1:15:39] saw my hunger for the Lord and he was
[1:15:43] trying to work me into God and I think I
[1:15:46] pray for him every so often when I
[1:15:48] remember but anyhow so and I began to
[1:15:51] pray little things life situations work
[1:15:56] uh and then I pray and things just
[1:15:58] happen.
[1:16:00] He said, "You pray in the name of the
[1:16:02] Lord Jesus." That was new for me. And I
[1:16:04] started praying and things have worked
[1:16:06] and things were changing. My life was
[1:16:08] changing and I started liking it. I
[1:16:10] said, "I'm going to pray again. This
[1:16:12] situation at the job, this situation in
[1:16:14] life, so I'm going to pray and I started
[1:16:17] praying and praying and and things were
[1:16:19] changing in my life." So I said, "This
[1:16:22] is good." I started liking it. I I read
[1:16:24] the Jehovah Witness books uh how to know
[1:16:26] God is a little red thick book and and
[1:16:28] and if I mention names and things like
[1:16:30] that remember it's not so much of a
[1:16:31] testimony it's going to get testimony
[1:16:33] here in a minute but um some of them
[1:16:36] books uh it's called how to know God
[1:16:38] it's about the thingness of this one
[1:16:40] here is red maybe you have read it
[1:16:42] perhaps they have it all over the world
[1:16:44] but anyhow I read the whole book they
[1:16:45] will come to my house talk to me about
[1:16:46] God things like that and this is you
[1:16:49] know lost in the world without God
[1:16:52] without hope. Okay? And and and then you
[1:16:56] know whoever been in the world, you know
[1:16:57] how it is. You think you got it, but you
[1:16:59] don't have nothing. Everything is out of
[1:17:01] everything is chaos. Okay? So that's
[1:17:04] then um right around, you know, 19 years
[1:17:07] old, 20, 21, 22. I was down here in
[1:17:10] Georgia places, you know, travel
[1:17:12] different places. My wife and I, we had
[1:17:13] moved 22 times since we married. Uh we
[1:17:16] we always pay rent. Everything was in
[1:17:18] order. We they didn't kick us out of the
[1:17:19] house. It's just we go places. Okay.
[1:17:21] Okay. So, 22 times. Um, but anyhow, so
[1:17:26] going back over there,
[1:17:29] the thirst, the hunger for God, it was
[1:17:32] just so vivid. It was just so vivid. I
[1:17:36] was a person that I like history. I I
[1:17:38] study history uh from the Roman Empire
[1:17:41] to the Greek Grecian Empire, the the
[1:17:43] British Empire, the the the the the
[1:17:46] travelers, the the Portuguese uh
[1:17:48] adventures and and all that, the
[1:17:51] American pioneers and and and who went
[1:17:54] to the West first and all that history.
[1:17:56] I love it. I love history. When when you
[1:17:58] know history, you can tell little things
[1:17:59] there because you understand why
[1:18:01] people's move and why they they did
[1:18:03] things that they did back then. So,
[1:18:06] anyhow, going back to the testimony,
[1:18:08] uh, I'm not I'm not going to even open
[1:18:10] this book yet. I hope I'm uh I can do
[1:18:12] well on the time. I think it's uh maybe
[1:18:15] seven. Is that clock okay? It was
[1:18:17] twisted. I think it's I don't know. I
[1:18:19] think it's 8:00, maybe 8 o'clock. Um, so
[1:18:23] being with that hunger for God, it was
[1:18:28] just genuine hunger. I mean, I I I see
[1:18:31] message churches back in all Mexico and
[1:18:34] I will drive by by and I see them and
[1:18:37] the way they dress, the way they do
[1:18:39] things. I thought it was something that
[1:18:41] I need to check out, but I never did.
[1:18:44] Finally uh met my wife uh in late uh
[1:18:49] 1999.
[1:18:50] We got married pretty quick, three or
[1:18:52] four months. But anyhow, again, we went
[1:18:56] to California, same city because that's
[1:18:59] what my in-laws are still here are and
[1:19:01] stuff like that. And
[1:19:04] then one day, this is funny, brother
[1:19:07] Thomas, because I'm hearing radio and
[1:19:11] this is like 8 8:00 in the evening,
[1:19:13] right about this time, I'm delivering
[1:19:15] pizzas, okay? Um, I'm not going to tell
[1:19:17] you the name of the company, but anyhow,
[1:19:19] Pixus, and I'm the Liam Pixus, and I'm
[1:19:21] hearing this preacher on the radio,
[1:19:23] okay? And he's talking about that Jesus,
[1:19:26] the Lord,
[1:19:28] um,
[1:19:29] God cannot die. He said, he said it was
[1:19:32] the man, but the spirit has to leave
[1:19:34] Jesus before he died. And that kind of
[1:19:36] makes a lot of sense, you know, the
[1:19:38] spirit cannot die. But anyhow, and then
[1:19:40] he did mention the name of William
[1:19:41] Brandon.
[1:19:44] William Bron. He said there was a man
[1:19:45] from the east by the name of William
[1:19:47] Bron and it just didn't check it, didn't
[1:19:50] pay attention to it. Keep on leaving.
[1:19:53] One day um I'm going on this place.
[1:19:55] There's a golf course here on the side.
[1:19:57] Real beautiful day. California used to
[1:19:59] be nice. I think it's still nice. But
[1:20:00] anyhow, um it was very very nice. You
[1:20:04] you enjoy the flowers. You en enjoy the
[1:20:06] grass and everything is just clean and
[1:20:07] and things like that. But anyhow, I'm
[1:20:09] driving and somebody hits the the golf
[1:20:11] ball and and they just missed the fence
[1:20:13] and all that. And I'm in the car here,
[1:20:15] my my hand right here, and it hit about
[1:20:17] an inch inch and a half from my elbow
[1:20:19] and it bent the door. And I was
[1:20:21] thinking, man, if that would have hit my
[1:20:23] my skinny hand, it would have break it
[1:20:25] in half.
[1:20:26] And I said, that was a real close call.
[1:20:29] And and it just the spirit of the Lord.
[1:20:32] I was hearing some worship song at the
[1:20:34] moment when the ball hit the car and I
[1:20:36] couldn't just help it. I just turn
[1:20:39] around, park my car. There was people in
[1:20:42] a park with I didn't care who was
[1:20:44] watching me. I I I gave my life to the
[1:20:47] Lord in public right on the car. I said,
[1:20:50] "Lord, I'm a sinner. I know if I die
[1:20:53] today, I I will go to hell. I was frank
[1:20:56] straight and it was a fact." And I said,
[1:20:59] "The things that I do, the way I live, I
[1:21:02] cannot do this no more. Lord, if you
[1:21:05] forgive me, I will serve you the rest of
[1:21:07] my life. And I was bowling and crying
[1:21:10] and and asking the Lord to to forgive
[1:21:13] me. I got home and I told my wife, I
[1:21:15] said, "This is what happens. And I need
[1:21:18] to serve God. I'm going to surrender my
[1:21:20] life to the Lord. I'm going to give my
[1:21:21] life to the Lord." And she didn't know
[1:21:24] much about God or anything like that
[1:21:25] herself to even though her in-laws were
[1:21:28] message believers back then already. She
[1:21:30] had heard about Brother Bron and things
[1:21:31] like that. There was a wonderful sister
[1:21:33] there in Old Mexico that really
[1:21:34] influenced my wife, the dressing, uh the
[1:21:38] life, the way she treated her husband.
[1:21:41] My wife, she still remember she already
[1:21:42] went with the Lord. But anyhow, she
[1:21:44] said, "I remember her the way she
[1:21:47] treated and he was not a believer, but
[1:21:49] her life was tremendous." And so going
[1:21:53] back over there,
[1:21:56] um, we started trying to, you know, look
[1:22:00] for the Lord and try to do the best. So
[1:22:03] I said, "We're going to go to church." I
[1:22:04] told my wife the same day. I said,
[1:22:06] "We're going to go to church." She said,
[1:22:07] "Where?" I don't know. There's churches
[1:22:09] around here. Everywhere I drive, there's
[1:22:10] churches they uh Protestant uh the way
[1:22:13] and and different churches. So that was
[1:22:15] like a Thursday. Then on Saturday, we go
[1:22:18] to a Google store someplace over there
[1:22:21] and and we're looking for a church for
[1:22:22] Sunday. And then then my wife, there's a
[1:22:26] lady over there with a lawn skirt. And
[1:22:27] then she's already struck a conversation
[1:22:29] with my wife and she already given a a
[1:22:31] church name and address and invite you
[1:22:33] over Sunday. And when I saw that
[1:22:35] conversation, I just come along. I said,
[1:22:36] "Lady, we just made our decision
[1:22:38] yesterday to go to church." I said,
[1:22:40] "We're going to your church." And we
[1:22:42] went. Anyhow, we went to a church,
[1:22:44] Trinitarian Church. This a long story
[1:22:46] short, we're going to we're going to go
[1:22:47] to the message. That's just part of
[1:22:49] growing in the word of God. Being
[1:22:51] baptized in the titles,
[1:22:53] I I went
[1:22:56] a dry center and I came a wet center out
[1:22:59] of the water. And I I know it was not
[1:23:02] right. But anyhow, this is uh you know
[1:23:06] uh 2020 21. We have our daughter
[1:23:10] Stephanie, then Levi,
[1:23:13] then Gethsemane. She's 21, I believe.
[1:23:16] Um, but anyhow, the the wife, Joshua's
[1:23:19] uh uh wife. But anyhow, then we were in
[1:23:22] California again.
[1:23:25] And then I just felt we need to move
[1:23:27] east. So, if you wonder why we're here,
[1:23:30] we're in California this 21 years ago.
[1:23:33] And I just felt a pull. I said, "We're
[1:23:35] going to move east." I said, "I don't
[1:23:36] know where. I don't have a job
[1:23:38] promotion. I don't I don't know anybody.
[1:23:41] I don't know where to go." But I told my
[1:23:43] wife, I just feel in my heart that we
[1:23:44] had to move east, east of the Rockies. I
[1:23:47] said, Denver,
[1:23:49] somewhere in Iowa, Wisconsin, Georgia,
[1:23:52] New York. I never thought so far, but
[1:23:54] somewhere close here. And and and I told
[1:23:57] my wife, I said, "We going to move east
[1:23:59] one of these days." So, she was going to
[1:24:01] Mexico with the three little kitties.
[1:24:03] And I said, "We'll just go over there
[1:24:04] and I follow suit in the next month or
[1:24:06] two and and I catch up with you." But
[1:24:08] anyhow, we went back to Old Mexico
[1:24:10] again. and we're there
[1:24:13] and we're going to a Pentecostal church.
[1:24:18] Then the Lord showed me a dream. This is
[1:24:20] where the testimony comes. Okay? Cuz I I
[1:24:23] believe that God is still God and he's
[1:24:27] still the same as he was when he met
[1:24:30] Moses there
[1:24:32] when when he talked to Joshua around the
[1:24:36] city. He's still the same God. It's just
[1:24:40] up to us whether we can call him on the
[1:24:42] scene for our situation. But he's still
[1:24:46] God. But anyhow, go trying to get to the
[1:24:49] testimony.
[1:24:51] I had a dream. I'm in Old Mexico. Okay.
[1:24:57] I dreamed that I was in Jeffersonville,
[1:25:00] Indiana. I never been in Jeffersonville,
[1:25:02] Indiana in my life before. This is 2021.
[1:25:07] Okay. And I have heard the voice of the
[1:25:10] Lord before.
[1:25:13] And I can tell you when God speaks,
[1:25:15] okay?
[1:25:16] And I'm there and I see a couple ladies
[1:25:20] kind of your age, sister, maybe I don't
[1:25:22] know, 61, 62, 68, whatever. And they're
[1:25:25] going to a church service and they're
[1:25:28] going in and I'm walking on the sidewalk
[1:25:31] and they say, "Come in. You're welcome.
[1:25:34] There's church service." I said, "Well,
[1:25:37] I would like to and I can hear the
[1:25:38] singing and the praising over there and
[1:25:40] that that calling and I said, "No, no,
[1:25:42] no." Said, "Yeah, you're welcome." And
[1:25:43] they went to the side door of the church
[1:25:45] went in the church and all of a sudden
[1:25:47] I'm walking again and I turn around
[1:25:51] and you know that know the brown
[1:25:53] tabernacle there in Jeffersonville. I'm
[1:25:54] in front of the brown tabernacle and I'm
[1:25:56] walking towards
[1:25:58] the street over there and all of a
[1:26:01] sudden the the Lord God is talking to
[1:26:04] me.
[1:26:07] I say is that a church? He says yes. Is
[1:26:10] there a service? Yeah, there's a
[1:26:11] service. And and then God is talking to
[1:26:14] me and then I try to understand okay
[1:26:17] there's a church. There's two ladies
[1:26:18] went in the church. Now I have read a
[1:26:21] little bit of brother Brandon prior to
[1:26:23] that
[1:26:26] and he says this is the Brandon
[1:26:27] tabernacle
[1:26:29] the way it was before it was fixed
[1:26:33] and I look at the building and look like
[1:26:36] white bricks
[1:26:38] type of a church steps on the side
[1:26:42] and then I turn around to the left and
[1:26:45] and that emotion trying to worship the
[1:26:47] Lord. Okay. And I'm in the presence of
[1:26:50] God in the dream and I'm trying to
[1:26:52] understand, but I I want to hear what he
[1:26:54] wants to say. And I Okay. And then I
[1:26:57] turn to the left again and the service
[1:26:59] is still going on the church there. And
[1:27:01] I turned to the left and I saw like a
[1:27:02] canyon.
[1:27:04] We call them canyons in the west, you
[1:27:06] know, a river, something real wide. And
[1:27:09] I couldn't understand what it was. And I
[1:27:11] was trying to see what is between me
[1:27:13] here and there. But I can see cars on
[1:27:15] the other side of the canyon. And cars
[1:27:18] are going south north fast. I can see
[1:27:22] the cars literally with my own eyes. And
[1:27:24] I can see the cars and and I try to
[1:27:27] understand what is this? A river, a
[1:27:28] ditch, a um a a canyon or something
[1:27:32] between me and those cars. And I turn
[1:27:34] around when I turn around. I'm here on
[1:27:37] the brown taco go to the side. Then I
[1:27:39] saw Brother Brandon coming out of the
[1:27:41] church from the left side. He's wearing
[1:27:42] a little black hat. And there's a black
[1:27:45] man, African-American man, coming out of
[1:27:48] the church soon. I can see him. And
[1:27:50] brother Brandon is coming out of there.
[1:27:51] It looks like he finished the service
[1:27:53] and he's going to his car. And I was not
[1:27:56] too much concerned about Brother Brandon
[1:27:58] of the black man and the people right
[1:27:59] there on the side of the door. I'm
[1:28:01] concerned. I need to understand what I'm
[1:28:04] here. There's cars over there, but what
[1:28:06] is between me and the cars? There's
[1:28:09] something on the dream trying to
[1:28:11] understand what is it? And I turn around
[1:28:14] and I walk the street and I saw parking
[1:28:18] like enough for 20 30 cars in front of
[1:28:20] the church and I can walk on the street
[1:28:23] and I go to the left again and then I go
[1:28:25] to the left to the church and I saw the
[1:28:27] street like turning a little curb.
[1:28:30] I saw the leaves. I never saw leaves in
[1:28:32] my life before because back southwest
[1:28:36] they don't fall, you know. You don't we
[1:28:38] don't have a fall over there. You have a
[1:28:40] fall here. But anyhow, and I saw the
[1:28:41] leaves on the ground and I said, "I can
[1:28:43] see that green tree, but I see leaves on
[1:28:45] the ground. I never seen that before."
[1:28:47] And then I turned around and and I asked
[1:28:49] the Lord,
[1:28:54] "What is it between me and those cars?"
[1:28:57] And then in front of me over here, I can
[1:28:58] see like a bridge going over across.
[1:29:01] And I can see the semmites. I can see
[1:29:03] the cars with these natural eyes. And I
[1:29:06] can see the old cars. I said, "Well,
[1:29:07] there's got to be like a like a like a
[1:29:09] bridge or something. And they're going
[1:29:10] about each other.
[1:29:12] And I asked the Lord. I turn around
[1:29:17] and I look at brother Brandon and I
[1:29:19] said, "Is he your servant? Your
[1:29:22] prophet?" I said, "Your prophet?" He
[1:29:23] said, "My servant."
[1:29:25] Okay. And then and I tried to understand
[1:29:29] the dream. And he said,
[1:29:32] "Forgive me. I'm trying to make words,
[1:29:34] okay? But the best that I can describe,
[1:29:37] the best that I can break into words, he
[1:29:41] said it. You go to them who know about
[1:29:44] him
[1:29:46] and you will understand what is between
[1:29:48] you and the cars.
[1:29:52] I wake up in the morning
[1:29:55] and I told my wife, I said, "I need a a
[1:29:58] piece of paper and a pencil. Is that
[1:30:00] right?" I said, "I need to write it
[1:30:03] down." What I saw, I was in front of the
[1:30:06] Brandon Tabernacle. I saw these ladies
[1:30:08] going into the church. I saw Brother
[1:30:10] Brandon coming from the side. The Lord
[1:30:12] was speaking to me. I walked in the
[1:30:14] street. I saw the street. I saw the
[1:30:16] building.
[1:30:18] And the Lord told me that was his
[1:30:19] servant.
[1:30:21] But I I asked him about this bridge or
[1:30:24] these places over here like a canyon.
[1:30:27] And I saw even the the river turning.
[1:30:30] Now I call it rivet because I understood
[1:30:32] that after making a turn, okay,
[1:30:36] supernaturally
[1:30:38] and and I get to
[1:30:41] wake up, get my piece of paper, pencil,
[1:30:44] and I had to write the details because I
[1:30:46] forget things. I said, I don't want to
[1:30:48] forget this. I need to write it down. So
[1:30:50] it happened like three days after I had
[1:30:52] this information, very vivid, not a
[1:30:55] nightmare, not a not a just a dream.
[1:30:59] This is something from the Lord. I need
[1:31:00] to write it down. Nightmares, I told my
[1:31:03] wife, they don't last a second. Once I
[1:31:05] awake, they're gone. I don't need to
[1:31:07] entertain nightmares or nothing like
[1:31:08] that. I just blow them out. But a but a
[1:31:12] dream from the Lord, I need to keep it
[1:31:14] because he's going to help me and he's
[1:31:16] going to help others. But anyhow, so
[1:31:18] then like three days later, this is like
[1:31:20] a like a Thursday. Then on Saturday
[1:31:23] morning, her brother named Joseph,
[1:31:25] he comes real early in the morning to
[1:31:27] the house. we're still in bed. And he
[1:31:30] comes.
[1:31:32] It's about 6:45 a.m. We're still in bed.
[1:31:35] And I told my wife, "But you kind of
[1:31:37] dress up. Go and see who it is. Don't
[1:31:39] open the door. Just see who it is and
[1:31:42] let let me know." And I meanwhile can
[1:31:44] kind of dress up. But she comes to the
[1:31:47] door. She said, "Oh, my brother Jose. He
[1:31:49] needs to talk to you." I said, "Oh, just
[1:31:50] tell give him a minute." I kind of dress
[1:31:52] up and I go to the door
[1:31:55] and this is Amen. My wife could say,
[1:31:58] "Amen." Because this is this is true.
[1:32:00] This is true. This is I'm not making
[1:32:03] this up. I don't I don't He didn't tell
[1:32:06] me to tell it. He didn't He don't know,
[1:32:09] right? Do you know this? No. Um but
[1:32:12] anyhow, so there he comes three days
[1:32:16] after. I'm going to bypass a lot of
[1:32:18] details for the sake of time, okay?
[1:32:20] There's there's more to it, but I'm
[1:32:21] going to go to it. He comes in the
[1:32:23] morning. This is a message believer. The
[1:32:25] Lord done told me two days before you
[1:32:28] asked these people if the things that
[1:32:31] you saw with your natural eyes are
[1:32:33] according to reality.
[1:32:36] Brother Brandon was my prophet. Well,
[1:32:39] I'm putting those words. He was my
[1:32:41] prophet. So, Saturday he comes and he
[1:32:44] says, "Well, there's going to be a
[1:32:45] little gathering like this Saturday with
[1:32:47] the brother, right? There's three to
[1:32:49] four message churches over there.
[1:32:52] brothers is still in the message and and
[1:32:54] they have this situation of a little
[1:32:56] gathering, a little food get together
[1:32:57] and stuff like that. And he says, "Well,
[1:32:59] the brothers over there at brother
[1:33:01] Roberto's house, they're going to have a
[1:33:02] little get together. The sister's going
[1:33:04] to cook or something and I'm going to
[1:33:05] donate a lamb or two. Lamb is good." And
[1:33:08] I said, "Well, I got too much work like
[1:33:11] always." I said, "But I'll tell you
[1:33:12] what, I'm coming."
[1:33:15] I said, "We're coming." And I told my
[1:33:17] wife, she said, "We're coming." I said,
[1:33:19] "Yeah, we're coming." I said, "I got to
[1:33:20] go to work over there." Yeah. the kiddos
[1:33:22] ready and I said, "Uh, we just get on
[1:33:24] the truck and go." And and these people
[1:33:26] are message believers. We're not message
[1:33:28] believers. Uh, and stuff like that. But
[1:33:31] we come over there and the Lord done
[1:33:33] told me, "You need to ask him about it."
[1:33:35] And and they had a little gathering
[1:33:37] there. We come to the kitchen, big old
[1:33:38] nice msquid table. They're all eating.
[1:33:41] They're finishing. And the Lord done
[1:33:42] told me to ask him. And and they're
[1:33:44] about to get out of their table so the
[1:33:45] sisters can come in. And I just have to
[1:33:48] say, "Brothers, I'm sorry. I I need to
[1:33:50] uh tell you a testimony, a dream that I
[1:33:53] had three nights ago. And I start
[1:33:55] telling the testimony right there. And
[1:33:57] the pastor is sitting over there.
[1:33:58] There's another pastor over here on the
[1:34:00] side, a son leader named Mabel, he
[1:34:02] already went with the Lord, too. But
[1:34:03] anyhow, I'm on the corner table and and
[1:34:06] I'm telling the dream and they're about
[1:34:07] to get up and brother Ju means Jon of
[1:34:10] God. Anyhow, he says, "Well, brother,
[1:34:13] uh, let's just dismiss ourselves from
[1:34:14] the table. Let's go outside under the
[1:34:16] shade over there and you finish your
[1:34:18] testimony while the sisters can come in,
[1:34:20] they can make themselves and they can
[1:34:21] eat. Kids were playing, you know,
[1:34:23] motorcycles, little things outside, you
[1:34:24] know, younger fellas are on the outside
[1:34:26] over there. And uh so we come outside
[1:34:28] and I keep on going with the testimony
[1:34:31] and when I start telling that that
[1:34:33] river, that canyon, there's a brother,
[1:34:36] he's about 67 years old named Antonio
[1:34:38] Sanchez. Very uh good people. They just
[1:34:42] do farming and corn and stuff. They're
[1:34:44] pretty well when it comes to cotton and
[1:34:45] stuff like that. That's not part of the
[1:34:47] testimony, but wonderful people. And
[1:34:49] this is a man that he doesn't know me
[1:34:50] either.
[1:34:52] And he uh he started breaking into
[1:34:55] tears. I noticed he's he's he's crying
[1:34:59] and he said, "Brother," he said that,
[1:35:02] and this a pastor,
[1:35:05] they have wisdom.
[1:35:07] He He says, "Brother, that's the Ohio
[1:35:11] River."
[1:35:13] the Ohio River. He said, "And that
[1:35:15] freeway is the Gene Snider Freeway."
[1:35:18] He said, "And that bridge that you saw
[1:35:20] is 65 going across the river to
[1:35:23] Louisville, Kentucky."
[1:35:26] He said, "And that curve that you saw,
[1:35:28] the Ohio River makes this curve over
[1:35:30] here in Clarksville, Indiana." And he
[1:35:32] turns
[1:35:33] and the man is crying.
[1:35:37] Then I kind of finish the testimony to
[1:35:40] them. Okay. But anyhow, and then he uh
[1:35:44] he says, 'Well, the pastor, brother, you
[1:35:48] probably need to read more. You know,
[1:35:49] that's wisdom. He said, ' There's a
[1:35:51] particular book about brother Brandon's
[1:35:53] life and gave me the name, the actor,
[1:35:54] and all that. I'm not going to go to
[1:35:55] names and stuff like that. He said he
[1:35:57] has reading three to four. There's some
[1:35:59] that are translated already, but you can
[1:36:01] read English probably. You can read it.
[1:36:02] He said, "I got four." I think he's
[1:36:04] making the number five book. He said,
[1:36:06] "You read it. When you finish one, bring
[1:36:09] it to me.
[1:36:11] get the other book, read it, and that's
[1:36:13] the way we do it. And he said, "So, so
[1:36:16] so, so you know, I said, "Brother, I
[1:36:17] don't had to read a single letter. I
[1:36:19] believe it, but it will help me. Give me
[1:36:22] the books." And I started, he he went to
[1:36:25] the truck, got me a book, and I got home
[1:36:27] and I started reading the book. I
[1:36:29] started Brother Brandon's life when he
[1:36:31] was a child and all that. When I when I
[1:36:34] went to the picture, there's a picture
[1:36:36] of the Brandon Tabernacle before 1963.
[1:36:40] It was whitish. It's got like three
[1:36:42] stone like kind of the shape of the
[1:36:45] balcony over there. When I opened that
[1:36:47] page, I was crying. Brother David, I saw
[1:36:50] that building with my own eyes. I saw
[1:36:54] that building. I I cried through all
[1:36:57] them three four books because how in the
[1:37:00] world me myself in another country I can
[1:37:03] be in Jeffersonville Indiana the Lord
[1:37:05] God of heaven is talking to me and is
[1:37:07] revealing to me that brother Brandon was
[1:37:09] his prophet
[1:37:11] this is uh um 2021 somewhere in there
[1:37:15] going back to California why I have felt
[1:37:18] that pull to move east that's what it
[1:37:21] was the Lord was preparing us to to um
[1:37:26] to receive this message.
[1:37:28] Then we end up in California again. We
[1:37:30] went up to Wisconsin, different places.
[1:37:32] And then we moved to Jeffersonville. No
[1:37:34] GPS, no nothing. Oldfashioned all Atlas
[1:37:38] books. You probably use them, brother.
[1:37:40] And I still like him. They're pretty
[1:37:41] accurate. If you mark them real well,
[1:37:43] you can go places. And and and so we're
[1:37:45] up in Wisconsin. Long story short, we
[1:37:48] decided to move to Jeffersonville,
[1:37:50] Indiana. We packed and and left and
[1:37:52] we're coming down. And my wife said,
[1:37:53] "How in the world you going to know
[1:37:55] where the church is?" I said, "I've been
[1:37:56] there before." I said, "I'm going to
[1:37:58] tell you where it is." I said, "We're
[1:38:00] we're taking uh uh we're exiting here on
[1:38:03] on on on on Tennis Street. I'm going to
[1:38:05] turn right on Spring. I'm going to get
[1:38:06] to to uh Penn and I'm going to turn
[1:38:09] left." I said, "The little brick church
[1:38:10] is on the left right there." I said,
[1:38:12] "I'm going to go left and park and go to
[1:38:14] church." That's the way it went because
[1:38:17] I I was there before. So going to that's
[1:38:20] that's how I received the message.
[1:38:22] That's how I received the message. Uh
[1:38:25] was not a
[1:38:28] not a I thank the Lord for his grace and
[1:38:31] his mercy that he still works the same
[1:38:34] way he did back then. So if I get to to
[1:38:37] to you know kind of go with the
[1:38:38] testimony if I say some things here
[1:38:41] please forgive me. Okay? Uh because this
[1:38:44] message is true.
[1:38:47] This is as genuine as good as Moses
[1:38:50] writing the book of Genesis. This
[1:38:53] message is the same in a greater way
[1:38:56] because a greater revelation taking us
[1:38:59] back to the original faith of the
[1:39:01] fathers. So this message is true. If
[1:39:04] somebody says, well, brother Brandon
[1:39:06] said here something here, made a mistake
[1:39:07] there. I said, no, you're too late to
[1:39:09] tell me. When I didn't know the name
[1:39:12] William Brandon, my God told me who
[1:39:16] William Brandon was. When I read his
[1:39:20] life,
[1:39:22] it told me this is true. When I heard
[1:39:24] the first tape,
[1:39:27] I said that's nothing but the truth. And
[1:39:32] and I received the message in in 2021.
[1:39:35] My wife received the message. Uh even
[1:39:37] the day when we got baptized, I told my
[1:39:39] wife. There's so much on testimony. But
[1:39:42] anyhow, still in California, I was some
[1:39:44] prayer and the Lord said, "I'm one." The
[1:39:47] Lord revealed to me that he was one
[1:39:49] before I even heard one tape. So when I
[1:39:52] hear the tape and brother Brandon
[1:39:53] teaches that he's one, that's nothing
[1:39:55] but the truth. Uh trying to save time
[1:39:58] and looking at the clock. The clock is
[1:39:59] going pretty fast. So there we receive
[1:40:03] the message. We come to Jeffersonville.
[1:40:06] So many blessings. The Lord has blessed
[1:40:08] us beyond beyond. Let me tell you, I I
[1:40:12] say this honestly and maybe the world
[1:40:13] can watch me today and some people that
[1:40:15] knows me. Um my name is said and Ed in
[1:40:19] Hebrew means ones that testify.
[1:40:23] You go back when Joshua conquered the
[1:40:25] land and they went back the tribe and
[1:40:28] tribe and a half went back across the
[1:40:30] river and they build up an altar unto
[1:40:33] the Lord and they they thought well this
[1:40:35] these people are going back to idolatry.
[1:40:37] He said no Ed means one who testify. So
[1:40:41] that's my name and and and I like to
[1:40:44] thank the Lord for that because I like
[1:40:46] to testify of what he's done in my life.
[1:40:49] I mean, I see my life where I come from,
[1:40:53] how the Lord has brought me out this
[1:40:55] far. And and I I I definitely believe
[1:40:59] that God loves each and every one of us
[1:41:03] as an individual, as an individual
[1:41:05] person. It's it's not that you know the
[1:41:08] pastor, well, the pastor has to sit on
[1:41:11] the back of the church here. He he he
[1:41:14] has to dress better than the brother
[1:41:16] over here or anything. No, the Lord is
[1:41:20] the same to you, the same as a preacher
[1:41:23] over there, same as a younger couple
[1:41:25] over there. He He's He's an awesome God.
[1:41:28] And he deals with individuals.
[1:41:31] It's not my dad,
[1:41:34] my grandpa, my uncle is you and God. And
[1:41:38] when you come to him humbly
[1:41:41] in prayer, he he can reveal things to
[1:41:44] you. If if I'm talking about the dream,
[1:41:47] he's always done it. It's not the first
[1:41:49] time. It's not the first time. Cornelius
[1:41:52] is there praying and he's a just man. I
[1:41:55] was not a just man. Cornelius was a just
[1:41:57] man because the Bible declares that. And
[1:41:59] then the Lord sent an angel. So same
[1:42:03] thing.
[1:42:05] Go and get Simon and he's going to tell
[1:42:10] you what is between you and the cars.
[1:42:13] and he received the Holy Spirit. Um, so
[1:42:16] trying to look at the time there
[1:42:19] coming into the message and receiving
[1:42:21] the message and the word of God and and
[1:42:23] I always think to myself, sometimes I
[1:42:25] told my wife, I said, "You know what? I
[1:42:27] don't even know what to do. Sometimes I
[1:42:30] I just get overwhelmed, brother Tummy,
[1:42:33] that that I just want to cry. I'll be on
[1:42:36] the job. I'll be shopping. I'll be
[1:42:38] driving. I just feel like, Lord, why me?
[1:42:41] It's just why you protected me? Why why
[1:42:45] you kept me? I mean, I come from a from
[1:42:48] a group of people, a tribe of of
[1:42:50] hundreds, in fact, on the county that I
[1:42:52] grew up over there in Mexico. I mean,
[1:42:54] it's big families by the thousands by
[1:42:57] the thousands. And none of them is a
[1:42:59] message believer that I know. I'm the
[1:43:02] only one. I don't brag about it, but I
[1:43:06] testify about it everywhere I go.
[1:43:09] Everywhere I go, I I I I I tell people
[1:43:13] about his um his grace and mercy because
[1:43:18] he his grace upon our lives, his
[1:43:20] protection wrecks situations and lives.
[1:43:23] I could have been dead 20 times already
[1:43:26] gone, completely gone without God,
[1:43:29] without hope. And I'm still here
[1:43:30] testifying on this uh little church in
[1:43:33] Kentucky. and and and I seek God's
[1:43:35] blessings, his provisions in life about
[1:43:39] children, health,
[1:43:42] many many things that revelation,
[1:43:44] understanding of this word. So if
[1:43:46] somebody comes to me on these days, if
[1:43:48] so and so, brother so and so come over
[1:43:50] here and he puts me a 100 videos and 100
[1:43:53] understandings about the message of the
[1:43:55] hour and trying to take talk to me about
[1:43:59] the message or out of the message. Too
[1:44:02] late, brother. too late. This this this
[1:44:05] message is the truth. It's nothing but
[1:44:08] the truth. There's no mistakes on this
[1:44:10] message. Uh there's no errors on this
[1:44:13] message. Everything is from God. If if
[1:44:16] you want to know what's going on in the
[1:44:18] world, just play a tape. Just play a
[1:44:22] tape and you understand what's the
[1:44:24] president is doing, what is the other
[1:44:26] country people is doing. Just play a
[1:44:28] tape. The other day I was up in
[1:44:30] Indianapolis just going in my normal
[1:44:32] life and I'm playing something and and
[1:44:34] what the tape said it was exactly what
[1:44:37] the president was doing on the very same
[1:44:40] day. It's it's just it's a turn word.
[1:44:44] It's like you open your Bible and and
[1:44:46] and like you were talking the other day,
[1:44:48] brother, there about things that the
[1:44:50] Lord you read something on the Bible and
[1:44:52] perhaps back then didn't perhaps didn't
[1:44:55] touch your heart too much and before you
[1:44:57] know you open a scripture it's like you
[1:44:59] can leave on that verse for a whole
[1:45:01] month
[1:45:03] for a whole month a whole year one
[1:45:05] little verse in the Bible is the same
[1:45:06] with the tapes is the same thing that is
[1:45:09] the living word of God. I I if if
[1:45:13] especially younger people, you hear them
[1:45:16] tapes, your life is gonna be changed.
[1:45:19] It's going to be changed because it's
[1:45:21] not the voice of a Kentucky preacher, is
[1:45:24] the voice of God using the little men.
[1:45:27] And then not only that, he inspired him
[1:45:30] to preach the message
[1:45:33] and and and and lives are changed by
[1:45:36] hearing those tapes. Brother Brandon
[1:45:38] said that, right? and and I'm trying to
[1:45:40] get to to a little bit of the testimony
[1:45:42] and that's part of it. The Lord has done
[1:45:44] so much and I know time and and and my
[1:45:46] nerves are a little bit out of order. Um
[1:45:49] but
[1:45:51] it's so great to to hear even the
[1:45:53] testimony of our sister today and the
[1:45:55] things that the Lord do constantly
[1:45:58] constantly constantly constantly. I
[1:46:01] mean, if I can tell you dreams, things
[1:46:04] that the Lord has showed me from there
[1:46:07] on, it's just too much. It's just too
[1:46:10] much. It will have to take years. My
[1:46:12] little wife there too, you know, brother
[1:46:14] Brandon says that when when God calls a
[1:46:16] man, he calls his wife to. And before
[1:46:19] you know, the preacher might be thinking
[1:46:21] on something to preach and he's putting
[1:46:23] his notes together and before the sister
[1:46:25] will come on the door and she says
[1:46:26] something and it's like that's what I
[1:46:28] was looking for for the last three days
[1:46:31] and I just got to write it down. You
[1:46:32] don't tell her perhaps you don't give
[1:46:34] her the credit or whatever, but you know
[1:46:36] it's the Lord. My wife has seen visions,
[1:46:39] dreams, things that come to pass through
[1:46:42] the letter through the letter on time
[1:46:45] everything. And and I thank God for
[1:46:47] that. that the the Lord has blessed me
[1:46:50] with a with a wonderful wife and and
[1:46:52] before you know it there's so many
[1:46:54] things just the other day I mean that
[1:46:57] little woman we go through a lot of
[1:46:58] struggle for kids and stuff like that
[1:47:01] and we have a little situation with with
[1:47:02] one of our sons over there and the Lord
[1:47:05] just told her in a dream okay well he's
[1:47:07] doing this here he's going to do that
[1:47:09] here so he don't have to tell me I just
[1:47:11] tell him you know this is our God our
[1:47:15] God is is not a is not a far away
[1:47:17] distance God the the win you know and
[1:47:20] forgot about us. Well, he come sent a
[1:47:22] messenger. He went and preached gave the
[1:47:25] testimony of his life, how he grew up
[1:47:27] and things like that and started going
[1:47:29] about the campaign, the healing
[1:47:30] campaigns and and the discernment of the
[1:47:32] heart and telling people who they were
[1:47:35] and and and and the word of God and all
[1:47:37] that and and God would just give up on
[1:47:39] life and give up on humanity. Oh, okay.
[1:47:42] everything. I already sent the prophet.
[1:47:44] I already sent the message and I just
[1:47:47] give up. God is still speaking. God is
[1:47:51] still revealing his word. It's just it's
[1:47:54] just the same word but for the time and
[1:47:56] the season that you need it. If if you
[1:47:59] find yourself in a situation where you
[1:48:01] there's no way out, just encou I
[1:48:04] encourage you to get to your Bible and
[1:48:06] the answer is right here.
[1:48:09] You go to sleep and perhaps you can be
[1:48:10] playing a tape on the middle of the
[1:48:12] night because I do a whole lot. And
[1:48:14] you'll be playing a tape and the Holy
[1:48:15] Spirit will wake you up on the very
[1:48:18] moment, the very second and it tells you
[1:48:21] exactly what you need and then put you
[1:48:24] back to sleep and get up, go to work.
[1:48:28] And it's just it's just wonderful. I
[1:48:30] mean, it's just uh I'm going to I'm
[1:48:32] going to keep going. Uh brother Tom,
[1:48:34] just a little bit more. A little bit
[1:48:36] more. Um, so that's how we got the
[1:48:39] message in our lives. So when somebody
[1:48:41] comes to me, if if my father is already
[1:48:44] uh gone with the Lord, my mother's still
[1:48:46] living, my my my in-laws and all that.
[1:48:48] If a priest comes to me and he he offers
[1:48:51] me the whole world and he says, "Well,
[1:48:53] that's not the truth." I said, "Buddy,
[1:48:55] you're too late. The word of God is a
[1:48:58] fact. It's a fact. Is the truth." This
[1:49:02] message is exactly with the word of God.
[1:49:05] Exactly on time, not before.
[1:49:09] Not in the middle nor after. He said,
[1:49:12] "Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet
[1:49:15] before." Right? I send you
[1:49:20] Elijah the prophet before the dreadful.
[1:49:25] Right?
[1:49:27] The Lord. Can anybody tell there is
[1:49:30] something dreadful coming into the
[1:49:32] earth? I think we can tell, right? But
[1:49:35] he already sent Elijah to tell us what
[1:49:38] to do and how to act and how to conduct
[1:49:41] ourselves in our lives. So, we're not
[1:49:43] going to be afraid. Well, the whole
[1:49:45] nation fell yesterday. Who cares? The
[1:49:48] whole world fell apart in Russia. Are
[1:49:51] you worried about that? I I won't be
[1:49:53] worried about a thing. Well, he he's
[1:49:55] getting ready to push that messenger so
[1:50:00] I already have the messenger. He already
[1:50:03] told me what's taking place. So, I'm not
[1:50:06] worried about Putin. I'm not worried
[1:50:08] about anybody back there, China and the
[1:50:11] whole world. They they they can put the
[1:50:14] whole world together with all the
[1:50:16] armaments and all the chemicals and all
[1:50:18] the stuff that they have together to try
[1:50:21] to destroy this bride. they will not be
[1:50:23] able to do it because brother Van said
[1:50:26] before one missile hits his earth will
[1:50:30] be gone.
[1:50:32] So that's that's uh
[1:50:36] that that's my my standing tonight and
[1:50:38] and trying to you know move on with the
[1:50:40] time.
[1:50:42] This message is nothing but the true and
[1:50:45] and trying to go to the message that's
[1:50:46] the testimony that's how we got the
[1:50:49] message ourselves. That's how we receive
[1:50:51] the message. I I I I believe in the
[1:50:54] ministry. I believe in a preacher can
[1:50:57] pick a word and and it just you go on
[1:50:59] the word and you just my goodness,
[1:51:01] that's so tremendous and that's so
[1:51:02] tremendous and you leave with it the
[1:51:04] wisdom of of of a pastor like brother
[1:51:07] Thomas last Sunday. You know, the world
[1:51:09] is so shook up about these things here.
[1:51:10] Said, "Well, just go on with your life.
[1:51:13] Just go on with your business. Just go
[1:51:15] on with your family. Don't be concerned
[1:51:17] about them things." You know, we had the
[1:51:19] word of God. We had the answer for the
[1:51:21] devil's question, right? So, I thought
[1:51:23] that was a wonderful sermon last Sunday.
[1:51:25] Not not excited about trying to predict
[1:51:28] what is going to happen and this
[1:51:29] company's going to drop and and this
[1:51:31] government is going to do this. No, the
[1:51:33] word of God is a secure place. That's
[1:51:35] where you rest your souls on it. Um, but
[1:51:38] going back to the testimony, this word
[1:51:40] is so powerful. It's just so powerful.
[1:51:44] This word is tremendously powerful.
[1:51:47] Going back a little bit to the
[1:51:48] testimonies and part of that I'm not
[1:51:49] going to even open this book because
[1:51:51] it's too much um about the word of God
[1:51:54] and so tremendous in our lives the worth
[1:51:57] to not only give our time and our
[1:52:00] efforts worth to give ourselves
[1:52:03] completely to this message the where
[1:52:06] wherever we we shop with wherever we
[1:52:09] work wherever we go to school like
[1:52:11] ladies with your long hair I told my
[1:52:14] wife all the time I said if I was a
[1:52:16] woman, I will have my hair as long as I
[1:52:18] could. You know, if I had it this short,
[1:52:20] I have it this long, I'll wear it with
[1:52:22] proud wherever I go. And and if somebody
[1:52:25] said, "Lady, well, your hair, look at
[1:52:27] how long it is." I said, "Well, it's on
[1:52:30] the book of God." And I like to honor
[1:52:33] him
[1:52:34] because he said it and and and what a
[1:52:37] testimony wherever they go. Oh, your
[1:52:40] hair is so long. Why you dress that?
[1:52:43] because it's on the word of God and I do
[1:52:45] it for my God. So I if the Lord would to
[1:52:49] have a certain dress code for the man
[1:52:52] which he does holiness right unto the
[1:52:55] Lord but if the Lord would have a
[1:52:57] certain particular hat or something that
[1:52:59] you put on I would wear it you know back
[1:53:02] in the old days they had a front part on
[1:53:04] their heads and they have a title on
[1:53:06] their hands and things like that that's
[1:53:07] a ritual but now we have it in the table
[1:53:11] of our hearts. There was a preacher
[1:53:13] there in uh uh Tennessee was he's
[1:53:15] talking about he was from from Africa
[1:53:17] some place over there. He's talking
[1:53:18] about the message. He said he said I had
[1:53:21] the app an application or something. He
[1:53:23] said I have the app in my heart and
[1:53:25] that's what I want this message. The
[1:53:28] anything that comes alone if I'm driving
[1:53:30] on reverse I need to drive on the
[1:53:32] message. I I if I'm talking to a
[1:53:36] business person I need to talk with the
[1:53:38] message. I if if I'm meeting an
[1:53:40] individual who is aggressive, difficult
[1:53:43] to deal with, I had to talk to that guy
[1:53:45] with the message completely with the
[1:53:47] word of God and nothing will will stand
[1:53:51] you. If you have the message in front of
[1:53:54] you, nothing, no devil, no devil, Satan
[1:53:59] and all his God has tried
[1:54:03] already. He already bankrupt his
[1:54:06] arsenal. He's already broken. I think
[1:54:08] he's looking for firecrackers or
[1:54:11] something over there in hell because
[1:54:12] he's got nothing. He already tried to to
[1:54:16] to drown, to burn, to kill, to destroy,
[1:54:20] you know, he tried all the taxes that
[1:54:22] he's got to stop this ride, but he's not
[1:54:25] able to do it. The the ride keeps on
[1:54:27] going because she's got the word of God.
[1:54:30] Going back to the to to testimonies, you
[1:54:33] know, um this this this word is is is so
[1:54:36] powerful. Um that is a living word. Two
[1:54:41] more testimonies and I go to something
[1:54:43] little and then and then I I finish.
[1:54:47] I told this part to brother
[1:54:50] Tom the other day about Ron Spencer.
[1:54:55] Okay. Well, this is this is something.
[1:54:58] When he hears this, he's gonna be shook.
[1:55:02] He's gonna be, I never heard that
[1:55:04] before. But anyhow, going back to
[1:55:08] dreams, I received the message to a
[1:55:10] dream. You go back to the Old Testament,
[1:55:14] the book of Amos, right? It says, okay,
[1:55:20] Peter referred to that, right? that in
[1:55:23] the latter time.
[1:55:25] Right? So, we're living here. We're
[1:55:28] living here. Um, again, this is years
[1:55:32] ago, three or four years. I don't have
[1:55:33] the dates and I don't even have the time
[1:55:35] for that. Okay? You just take my word
[1:55:38] for it and and if you have a question,
[1:55:40] you can ask some people, not myself,
[1:55:43] somebody else talking about cancer and
[1:55:45] things like that. Okay? So, we s
[1:55:49] preachers here in the internet and
[1:55:51] different things like that. But anyhow,
[1:55:53] I don't know Ron Spencer. Okay. I I I
[1:55:56] met Andrew the other day real quick in
[1:55:57] my He was sitting and I come with a
[1:56:00] little funny word over there. He's like,
[1:56:01] "What are you talking about?" You You
[1:56:03] heard right what I said. But anyhow, um
[1:56:08] this is a few years, I would say four
[1:56:10] years ago. I don't know where when he
[1:56:12] was diagnosed with that cancer,
[1:56:15] but I had another dream of thousands.
[1:56:18] Okay, I'm just referring I'm just
[1:56:20] referring to three to four. No more than
[1:56:22] that because there's there's so many but
[1:56:24] just one of them because it's today.
[1:56:27] Okay. If somebody says well brother
[1:56:30] Brandon said that in 1933 brother
[1:56:32] Brandon is done gone. Brother Billy Paul
[1:56:33] is done gone and everybody's gone. Who
[1:56:37] we going to go to? Well come to me.
[1:56:40] Come to me if you if you want to know if
[1:56:42] this message is true. Just come to me.
[1:56:44] Okay. And I feel good now. I feel good.
[1:56:47] I feel better now. But what I'm saying
[1:56:49] is this. Ron Spencer,
[1:56:52] I had a dream that he was preaching in
[1:56:56] Indian light tabernacle there in
[1:56:58] Louisiana. Not in Kentucky. They're in
[1:57:00] Louisiana. And and my wife and I are in
[1:57:03] that church and we're sitting in the
[1:57:06] front row like where you are, brother.
[1:57:08] Somewhere there. Second or third row.
[1:57:10] Right there. And he's over here and he's
[1:57:12] preparing. He's a preacher. I'm not a
[1:57:14] preacher. He opens his Bible. He opens
[1:57:16] his test. And I'm like, we're here near
[1:57:18] the light tabernacle. Brother Ron
[1:57:20] Spencer is preaching. We're sitting over
[1:57:22] here. And all of a sudden, we were moved
[1:57:24] like to the back and we end up in a
[1:57:26] higher ground like with the brother
[1:57:28] where the computer over there is a
[1:57:30] little higher than the deacon over
[1:57:31] there, a little bit higher. And I can
[1:57:33] still see him and he's preaching. And
[1:57:36] again, my goodness. And I can I can This
[1:57:38] is a gift, okay? It's on the word of
[1:57:40] God. It's on this Bible. If anybody
[1:57:43] questions this, it's on this word. It's
[1:57:47] not on on a book that I carry on my back
[1:57:49] pocket. It's on this book what I'm
[1:57:51] telling you, okay? The testimony and
[1:57:53] this other testimony. And I'm there
[1:57:57] and I know that I'm there and I see Ron
[1:58:01] uh Ron's pastor preaching and the Lord
[1:58:03] God of heaven revealed to me and the
[1:58:06] Lord says
[1:58:08] I'm not finished with him. He's not
[1:58:10] going to die with that cancer.
[1:58:14] I wake up and I go to my little wife and
[1:58:17] my children. I said, I had a dream.
[1:58:22] I was there in evening light tabernacle.
[1:58:24] Brother Ron Spencer was preaching. We
[1:58:26] were like in the third row and all of a
[1:58:28] sudden I felt myself like a little
[1:58:29] higher like an on the back
[1:58:33] and the Lord told me that he's not
[1:58:36] finished with him that he's going to
[1:58:38] continue on. The Lord didn't tell me a
[1:58:40] date.
[1:58:41] The Lord didn't say he's going to leave
[1:58:43] 150. Okay? He said, "I'm not finished
[1:58:45] with him."
[1:58:47] Okay? So, I wrote it down. I put it on
[1:58:50] things. And then I called Brother George
[1:58:52] Winters. Do you know him by any chance?
[1:58:55] Anyhow, his brother was here. He was
[1:58:56] leaning sons here, right?
[1:59:00] Uh, yeah. Anyhow, that's his brother,
[1:59:04] George. I used to call him quite often.
[1:59:06] Not anymore. But anyhow, and and and and
[1:59:10] then I was calling one day and we was
[1:59:11] talking about things. He said, "Well,
[1:59:13] you know who's here?" I said, "I don't
[1:59:14] know." He said, "Ron Spencer and Andrew
[1:59:16] are here." This is when he traveled that
[1:59:18] 700 mile. Whoever knows the story, you
[1:59:21] know, he went back over there. They went
[1:59:22] to the lake and his um brother Timothy
[1:59:26] Pu Puit uh uh kids received the Holy
[1:59:29] Spirit. And then he told me, he said,
[1:59:31] "Well, Ron is here." I said, 'Well, that
[1:59:34] sayeth the Lord, he's going to preach.
[1:59:37] And I said, 'not only that, I was in a
[1:59:38] hardware store there in Charleston,
[1:59:39] Indiana. We're still on the phone. And I
[1:59:41] said, and that say the Lord, he's not
[1:59:43] going to die. I said, and he's going to
[1:59:46] preach and eat the live tabernacle and
[1:59:48] I'm going to be there. I'm going to be
[1:59:50] sitting in the third row and I'm going
[1:59:51] to be moving in the back. Write it down.
[1:59:54] And when I say that, that sayeth the
[1:59:56] Lord with my broken English and and my
[1:59:58] nerves. And I thought that's a pretty
[2:00:00] pretty pretty heavy word. That's taking
[2:00:04] God's word and saying it. I said, I done
[2:00:08] told you, George, that sayeth the Lord,
[2:00:10] I'm going to be there. He's going to
[2:00:12] preach. The Lord is not finished with
[2:00:14] him.
[2:00:15] I told my wife and my kids, my my
[2:00:17] sons-in-law and all that. I said, "Write
[2:00:19] it down. They're witness of that." And I
[2:00:22] said, "We're going to go." One day, it
[2:00:24] just happens. We went over there. We
[2:00:26] didn't plan because we're in a vision.
[2:00:28] going to win a seat over here. We're
[2:00:29] going to move this way. And I had to
[2:00:30] move. No, none of that. There were some
[2:00:34] uh uh meetings for jungle fellers and
[2:00:36] and and young people and stuff like
[2:00:38] that. They're playing outside over
[2:00:40] there. And then brother Joe Adams is on
[2:00:42] his truck over there. He's uh selling
[2:00:44] these shirts for the for the camp or
[2:00:46] whatever it was. I went and bought two
[2:00:49] and and and then my wife says, "Well, we
[2:00:50] just better get in the church before we
[2:00:52] don't get a seat." I said, "Well, let's
[2:00:54] do it." And and we I said, "Brother Joe,
[2:00:57] thank you. I'll pay you." and here's
[2:00:58] your change. I said, "Keep the change."
[2:01:00] And I just rush into the church and we
[2:01:02] will set over there and I'm there trying
[2:01:05] to pray and I'm we kind of the first
[2:01:06] people in the church. There was a few
[2:01:08] some people already in the front row so
[2:01:10] we're over there and we're sitting. My
[2:01:11] wife said, "I want to sit close." I
[2:01:13] said, "Well, this is our time. Let's go
[2:01:14] and do it." And we and we come, we're
[2:01:16] sitting over there and I'm praying and
[2:01:18] then there's a deacon that comes to me
[2:01:19] and says, "Brother, uh, this these three
[2:01:22] front rows are reserved for for the
[2:01:24] Jude. will you mind to to move? And I
[2:01:28] said, "Yes, sir. I I will." And then I
[2:01:30] asked my wife and she's like,
[2:01:33] she wanted to stay there. I said, "We're
[2:01:36] moving." I said, "The deacon then told
[2:01:38] me we had to move." Okay. But I said,
[2:01:41] "We're moving." So, I got her said,
[2:01:44] "Let's let's go up there. Let's move."
[2:01:46] And we went back over there to to the
[2:01:48] second grade or whatever on the top. And
[2:01:50] um we're over there and I'm not thinking
[2:01:53] of that. I'm not concerned about what I
[2:01:55] saw or anything like that. And then he
[2:01:57] opens his Bible and his test and he says
[2:02:00] these words and you can go back on
[2:02:02] record on time. He says, "This is not
[2:02:04] only a service. This is a vision being
[2:02:06] fulfilled."
[2:02:07] When he said that, I felt like I can go
[2:02:09] out of the church, go home, we're done
[2:02:11] for my part. For my part. And that took
[2:02:15] place to the letter. To the letter. Now,
[2:02:18] you have heard the reports of his life.
[2:02:22] Okay? And I told people all over the
[2:02:25] place, anybody who's got brother George
[2:02:27] Winter's number,
[2:02:30] call him and ask him if he I didn't told
[2:02:33] him
[2:02:35] that saith the Lord.
[2:02:39] Okay, that's two witnesses. He and I.
[2:02:43] That's my wife Gerson. Is that right?
[2:02:47] That's correct. Right. Okay. Well, we
[2:02:50] have four witnesses. That's that's
[2:02:51] that's more than enough. Okay. And
[2:02:54] that's some people might say, "Well,
[2:02:56] that's pretty simple, brother. You need
[2:02:57] to drink some water." I do have to drink
[2:02:59] some water. But
[2:03:02] uh it's just, you know,
[2:03:08] but I'm drinking from the rock.
[2:03:11] That's the water that I've been
[2:03:12] drinking.
[2:03:14] Uh I've been drinking from this rock and
[2:03:16] and I don't want to uh stop drinking
[2:03:18] from this rock. And it's just one, you
[2:03:21] know, one thing of another. We're
[2:03:22] talking about a hurricane that happened
[2:03:24] in Florida. I'm not trying to make
[2:03:26] myself nobody, okay? If if anybody says
[2:03:30] I'm not wearing like tuxedos or anything
[2:03:32] like that. I did have a a change dress,
[2:03:34] okay, on the truck, but I was too late.
[2:03:36] I couldn't change. I was trying to dress
[2:03:38] better, okay? But no time. We just had
[2:03:40] to rush in the church. And that's what
[2:03:42] it is. That's what I got. But my Lord
[2:03:44] became a beggar for me. Do you know
[2:03:46] that? You know that Jesus of Nazareth
[2:03:48] became a beggar on the streets.
[2:03:52] And so when you drive your nice truck or
[2:03:54] you go to your nice home and your nice
[2:03:56] floors and all that, just remember Jesus
[2:03:59] was a homeless. That's what the Bible
[2:04:02] declares for you and me. Every time I go
[2:04:05] to bed and I pull my pillow,
[2:04:08] I think my Lord didn't have a pillow and
[2:04:12] I have a pillow. So he he didn't have a
[2:04:15] pillow so I can have a pillow on my
[2:04:17] head. So so so we're not making
[2:04:19] ourselves anything in life. We had to to
[2:04:22] to u lift his name on high.
[2:04:27] So that's that's some people will say
[2:04:29] well that's pretty simple. Is that
[2:04:30] simple? That another guy will be in that
[2:04:34] a guy will be in a country and he has a
[2:04:37] dream being in another country and the
[2:04:40] Lord God of heaven is talking to him.
[2:04:44] Okay. Not the pope,
[2:04:47] not the state state presptor or the
[2:04:50] governor,
[2:04:53] God himself and revealing his word. And
[2:04:56] I'm here in Kentucky
[2:04:59] telling you this message isn't true.
[2:05:01] That could be simple. It's not for me.
[2:05:04] Now, what about
[2:05:06] Mr. Spencer? Is that simple? Not for me.
[2:05:10] If I'm dying and somebody has a vision,
[2:05:13] let's say him over there, and I'm dying,
[2:05:16] and the Lord tells him,
[2:05:19] tell this Mr. Mora
[2:05:23] that that he's going to live another 10
[2:05:25] years. And then he showed me in the
[2:05:29] Bible
[2:05:31] here on these pages that it was God who
[2:05:34] spoke to him. I I'll start a business or
[2:05:36] something for another 10 years. I I'll
[2:05:40] I'll do something, brother. I'll get my
[2:05:41] cow or do something, you know, because
[2:05:44] if it's in the Bible, I believe it. Is
[2:05:46] that too simple? The man is well known.
[2:05:49] Ron Spencer all over the world. He
[2:05:52] preaches from the European nations to
[2:05:55] Canada, all over the place. And a little
[2:05:57] guy there in Charleston, Indiana has a
[2:05:59] dream from the Lord. And now the doctors
[2:06:02] come and say, "You are a miracle."
[2:06:08] To me, that settles the question. It has
[2:06:12] to be God. It has to be God involved in
[2:06:15] the situation. Don't you glad that he
[2:06:18] cares about our little details and our
[2:06:20] little life and situation that I mean
[2:06:22] the sister here. I mean think about
[2:06:24] that. It's just and then we just take it
[2:06:27] so for granted. It's like okay we went
[2:06:29] to church really. You went to church. It
[2:06:32] it was not like the old days.
[2:06:35] It was like the old days. It was not
[2:06:38] wellusa's truth. Well, they spoke in
[2:06:40] tonesues and they interpret tones and
[2:06:42] and they prophesied and and they have
[2:06:45] oil on their hands and things like that
[2:06:46] that came after. Well, that was
[2:06:48] wonderful for the good part. Right now,
[2:06:52] when it comes to realities of doctors
[2:06:56] saying those things and then we still
[2:06:58] move on the morning and get up and I
[2:07:00] guess I'm a message believer. I'm going
[2:07:02] to go to work and I'm going to do this
[2:07:03] that or the other. we probably had to,
[2:07:06] you know, kind of get on our beds or or
[2:07:08] wake out of our beds and and say, "Well,
[2:07:12] I think God is amongst his people,
[2:07:15] right?" And not only that, wherever you
[2:07:17] go, testify of it. You're the only
[2:07:19] light. There's no light. You see any
[2:07:22] light where you work? Do you see any
[2:07:24] light around anybody's? They don't have
[2:07:27] no light. You're the only light. So when
[2:07:29] you go to any city, wherever you go, you
[2:07:32] are the person who's holding that city
[2:07:36] for that day,
[2:07:38] that freeway,
[2:07:40] that tornado is going to be stopped
[2:07:43] because he's driving over there. Okay?
[2:07:46] So when you're driving, your little
[2:07:48] truck or your semi or your nice
[2:07:50] electric, whatever car you drive or a
[2:07:52] little thing that barely goes, okay?
[2:07:55] Well, your little car is surrounded by
[2:07:58] angels
[2:08:01] because you're on the car and you you
[2:08:03] don't have to pop up pop yourself say
[2:08:05] tell every, "Hey, I'm here. We're all
[2:08:07] okay. We're going to get home. Don't
[2:08:09] worry. Traffic is heavy. We're going to
[2:08:10] get home." No, you just have to realize
[2:08:13] you are the person who's the angel is
[2:08:16] watching. So, that tornado is going to
[2:08:18] go above the bridge. It's going to hit
[2:08:20] the field and it's going to go to the
[2:08:22] other side and you're going to get home
[2:08:24] and you're going to have the recording
[2:08:25] that I show some people here. I showed
[2:08:26] you the recording, right? Or somebody I
[2:08:28] don't know. I show it to somebody there
[2:08:30] in Indiana the other day. I mean, we're
[2:08:32] in the middle of the tornado right there
[2:08:33] and I'm recording. Said, "Well, there's
[2:08:34] a tornado over here about our heads.
[2:08:36] Everybody's under the bridge. It's okay.
[2:08:38] Let it pass. We just We need to get
[2:08:40] these people moving so we can go home."
[2:08:42] But that's how life has to be for a
[2:08:44] believer. Not being concerned about
[2:08:46] anything. You know if you have a
[2:08:49] situation in life, we all have
[2:08:50] situations, then just take it to the
[2:08:53] Lord. Just come, Lord, this is what is
[2:08:56] really hard on me. Help me Lord Jesus.
[2:08:59] And and it could be a situation to
[2:09:01] humble yourself. You know, myself,
[2:09:03] brother Tommy was saying sometime back
[2:09:04] on his testimony that he he he could not
[2:09:07] speak in public. Imagine myself,
[2:09:09] brother. I can hardly say anything. I
[2:09:12] can say amen, but beyond that, my my
[2:09:14] hallelujah have a little accent, too. So
[2:09:17] imagine I can say anything. I can hardly
[2:09:19] speak anything. But whatever I can do
[2:09:21] for the Lord, I'm going to do it. And
[2:09:23] then whatever situation the Lord puts on
[2:09:26] your hands, use it. Use it. And don't
[2:09:29] feel like you're not capable to do it.
[2:09:32] You are the only light on this earth.
[2:09:35] That's the only light that you have. And
[2:09:37] and I'm gonna move on there.
[2:09:40] If if they call me about this testimony,
[2:09:42] they can call me. You can give my
[2:09:44] number. It's okay. the whole world.
[2:09:46] Okay. About these testimonies,
[2:09:48] everybody. If a critic says, "Oh, that
[2:09:50] guy says that he saw brother Brandon
[2:09:53] back in the past and then he saw the
[2:09:55] Brandon tabernacle back in the past and
[2:09:57] then the God was talking to him." Yeah.
[2:10:00] Tell him to call me because he can show
[2:10:02] you things. Moses wrote the Bible, went
[2:10:05] back to the past. He saw Adam naked, his
[2:10:09] wife. He saw the serpent in the past and
[2:10:13] he was in the future. And then he wrote
[2:10:16] about the future, the Messiah. So Moses
[2:10:18] was able to go back in the past, stayed
[2:10:21] on the present
[2:10:24] and then go on the future, come back
[2:10:26] again and tell Joshua how things are
[2:10:28] going to go over there. Past, present,
[2:10:30] and future. Because that's God. Going
[2:10:32] back to another wonderful testimony. I'm
[2:10:35] looking at the clock. Nine. Another 10
[2:10:37] minutes maybe. Yeah, I think it's almost
[2:10:40] nine, right? I see almost nine.
[2:10:43] So, this this war this word is is
[2:10:46] eternal. I tell my wife and the kids, I
[2:10:48] said, "Remind me of some of the
[2:10:50] testimonies because I have too many. One
[2:10:52] of them another dream.
[2:10:55] This is the hurricanes that happen in
[2:10:57] Florida.
[2:10:58] You don't make those things." Brother
[2:11:00] Brown said, "You dream me a dream,
[2:11:02] right?" No. No way. There's no way you
[2:11:05] can do that. If the Lord has a time or
[2:11:08] something for your life, he will show it
[2:11:09] to you. But there's no way you can say
[2:11:11] yourself, "Okay, at 1:00 a.m. in the
[2:11:12] morning, I'm going to dream about this
[2:11:14] and by 1:30, I will cut the dream and
[2:11:17] then I write it down and I go back to
[2:11:18] sleep." You cannot control that. Well,
[2:11:21] let me let let's go back to if this was
[2:11:24] too simple, let me give you one that
[2:11:27] might shake your your shoes, especially
[2:11:29] those who don't believe. The believer,
[2:11:31] the believer believes, Brother Brandon
[2:11:32] says, right? The believer believes all
[2:11:34] these things are common things for you
[2:11:36] because you're a believer. But the
[2:11:38] common person, well, let's go back to
[2:11:39] the common person if somebody's watching
[2:11:42] this, okay? A common person, okay? An
[2:11:45] average person.
[2:11:48] 2015,
[2:11:50] that's about 10 years ago.
[2:11:53] We live there in Jeffersonville,
[2:11:54] Indiana. There on on on core and walnut
[2:11:58] somewhere over there. I can give you the
[2:12:00] address. uh 420 Walnut Jeffersonville if
[2:12:04] somebody wants to check the house. We
[2:12:05] did pay the rent and everything is okay.
[2:12:07] But anyhow, they can check the house
[2:12:10] where we live. Okay, we will pray. We
[2:12:14] will have devotions before we go to bed
[2:12:16] and things like that and then I will I
[2:12:18] will go back to the message and then
[2:12:19] brother Brandon says that the Lord
[2:12:21] himself makes himself there and he comes
[2:12:24] present when you speak about him. And we
[2:12:27] were just praying and things about the
[2:12:29] kids going to school and working and
[2:12:30] stuff like that. And we're praying.
[2:12:32] We're reading our Bibles and we perhaps
[2:12:34] read a little bit of the message or put
[2:12:36] a little tape or something, you know, a
[2:12:38] little portion perhaps a half a tape or
[2:12:40] something. But we're on the word of God
[2:12:42] and all of a sudden I just felt Brother
[2:12:44] David, I said, "The Lord is on this
[2:12:47] house.
[2:12:49] The Lord God is on this little house."
[2:12:52] Didn't I tell you, Maggie, for days? I
[2:12:55] said, 'The Lord is on this house. We
[2:12:58] were surrounded by crazy people. 2 2
[2:13:01] 3:00 a.m. in the morning, you hear
[2:13:02] gunshots and things like that and people
[2:13:04] screaming and cops and all over the
[2:13:06] place and we're still in bed. Okay. But
[2:13:10] anyhow,
[2:13:11] and and it just was something on my
[2:13:13] heart. I said, "The Lord is on this
[2:13:14] house." And I keep on telling my wife, I
[2:13:17] said, 'I won't be surprised that the
[2:13:19] Lord is going to come to the table here.
[2:13:22] Oh, he's going to wake up the kids
[2:13:24] tonight. I said, 'The Lord is right here
[2:13:26] on this house. We're praying and I was
[2:13:30] having a big back problem. Big back
[2:13:33] problem. I used to work in a place there
[2:13:35] in Jeffersonville welding and do a lot
[2:13:36] of things that I'm not going to even
[2:13:37] mention the details, but wonderful
[2:13:39] people, Christian message believers. But
[2:13:41] anyhow, I couldn't bend myself. We work
[2:13:43] with tools and things like that and you
[2:13:45] had to bend to pick a wrench or a tool
[2:13:47] or something. We work with cranes and
[2:13:49] different things and I couldn't bend
[2:13:51] myself. I struggled to get things. I
[2:13:52] almost got to get on my knee to pick a
[2:13:54] tool or or or something that I dropped
[2:13:56] or electrical something. We did
[2:13:58] electrical um a lot of stuff there,
[2:14:01] plumbing and all that and and my back
[2:14:03] was terrible.
[2:14:06] The the first two testimonies were too
[2:14:08] simple. This could be a little bit
[2:14:09] simpler for somebody, but it's the
[2:14:11] truth.
[2:14:13] We went to bed. I don't have the date. I
[2:14:15] don't remember the hour. It was a night
[2:14:19] right around 1 1:30, 2 a.m. in the
[2:14:21] morning, somewhere in there with hours
[2:14:22] of the night. I'm in bed.
[2:14:28] Then I feel such a headache.
[2:14:31] Terrible headache. You had them before.
[2:14:33] You had to take medicine and things like
[2:14:35] that to kind of control that. feels like
[2:14:37] your head is going to just come off. I
[2:14:40] never had such a headache in my life
[2:14:42] ever. Very terrible headache. It was
[2:14:45] just very, very hard to me. And I was
[2:14:47] thinking, I'm going to wake up my wife
[2:14:49] and we had she's going to rush me to the
[2:14:51] hospital. I don't want to do that. I'm
[2:14:54] going to miss Jeff tomorrow and and and
[2:14:56] I have this headache and I'm my
[2:14:59] goodness. And I I'm like, should I tell
[2:15:02] her? Should I tell her? And I didn't
[2:15:04] wake her up. Such a headache. And all of
[2:15:06] a sudden
[2:15:08] from the headache I went to a dream.
[2:15:13] And then I dream that Tony Brian,
[2:15:18] brother Nathan's Brian's brother, okay,
[2:15:21] you know him, okay, he was putting a
[2:15:24] board together. It was like a the back
[2:15:26] part of a bed and he's got like a a 6x6
[2:15:32] real nice cedar wood and he's putting
[2:15:34] this board together
[2:15:36] and then he places the board it like so
[2:15:39] awesome. You you work with wood and
[2:15:42] before you know you're working with
[2:15:43] something it just fits right perfectly.
[2:15:46] And I said mine Tony how do you do that?
[2:15:49] It was just perfectly. I want I said
[2:15:51] he's a carpenter. He did it just
[2:15:53] perfectly.
[2:15:55] And I was just in the spirit and and and
[2:15:58] I and I and I saw myself there watching
[2:16:01] him doing this board.
[2:16:04] And then I turned to my left and then
[2:16:07] the Lord Jesus
[2:16:10] came from the kitchen
[2:16:13] through the wall
[2:16:16] through the washer room and I'm on my
[2:16:20] bed and this is my mind thinking well
[2:16:24] when he comes to this wall that wall is
[2:16:26] just going to burst open
[2:16:28] and there he comes. The wall didn't
[2:16:30] broke, didn't break,
[2:16:34] and he came through. And I'm like, I
[2:16:36] need to wake up my wife. I need to The
[2:16:38] Lord is is right about our bed. And and
[2:16:42] and I need to see him. I need to see
[2:16:43] him. And
[2:16:45] the walls were not cracked. He comes
[2:16:48] right above us. Exactly the way brother
[2:16:50] Brandon described him.
[2:16:52] The color of hair, color of eyes, the
[2:16:54] stature exactly the way brother Brandon
[2:16:57] Hullman's
[2:16:59] head of Christ right there came through
[2:17:03] the window. The window didn't shut her.
[2:17:05] Went out of the house. When I saw like
[2:17:09] the window, you know, he goes through
[2:17:10] the window, he vanished. And I'm trying
[2:17:13] to tell my wife, but I want to see him.
[2:17:17] and and and I just like if I die
[2:17:24] I don't remember nothing from there
[2:17:27] nothing at all till I wake up in the
[2:17:30] morning
[2:17:32] and I wake up in the morning
[2:17:35] I know I saw the Lord I know I saw Tommy
[2:17:38] um sorry Tony Brian you can ask him I
[2:17:42] gave that testimony in the church so
[2:17:44] it's it's not something new they know
[2:17:46] about He knows about it. Okay, you can
[2:17:49] ask him, sister, when you go over there
[2:17:50] to Indiana. Okay, this is years ago.
[2:17:54] And and then when I wake up,
[2:17:58] brother Brad, I felt like I was 12 years
[2:18:02] old.
[2:18:04] I felt so light,
[2:18:07] so renew,
[2:18:10] full of strength.
[2:18:12] Not a single ache or pain or or
[2:18:15] heaviness or stomach situation. I mean I
[2:18:20] feel so good. So good.
[2:18:24] I if I go back in my Jude days when I
[2:18:28] can jump rope or I can uh play soccer or
[2:18:33] I can do wild things, you know, and and
[2:18:38] if I I don't have the memory of those
[2:18:40] things and maybe I can go back and
[2:18:42] remember, oh, I remember when we did
[2:18:44] this or the other, you know, I can run
[2:18:46] this much or I can swim this much,
[2:18:49] right? I remember swimming there in the
[2:18:52] Pacific and I just go, "Wow, I can swim
[2:18:55] a lot back then. I can go on a bike back
[2:18:58] then." And and I remember feeling okay,
[2:19:01] but when I wake up with this dream, I
[2:19:04] feel super
[2:19:06] super light, super
[2:19:09] good. I had to write the dream down.
[2:19:14] Is that true, Maggie?
[2:19:18] I went. Is that true, Gian? Is that
[2:19:20] true, Sharon?
[2:19:22] Okay. And brother Brian can say that and
[2:19:25] many other people, my in-laws and all
[2:19:27] that. They're going to see the video. Is
[2:19:29] that true, Joshua? Is that true, Isaiah?
[2:19:31] Levi.
[2:19:33] Okay, that's a true. That's a fact. I
[2:19:37] went to work
[2:19:39] knowing what I know.
[2:19:43] I'm just working, brother. I feel like a
[2:19:46] deer. I feel like a I can jump on top of
[2:19:49] the building and come back inside and
[2:19:51] and no aches, no pains, no I don't even
[2:19:53] feel the boots. Not even my my helmet
[2:19:56] and my goggles and stuff like that that
[2:19:58] I have to use on a on that type of an
[2:20:00] industry, you know. I don't feel that.
[2:20:03] Not at all. I I feel good. And then I
[2:20:06] went I dropped a a socket or something
[2:20:09] there with these machineries that we
[2:20:10] machines that we used to put together
[2:20:12] for mining and stuff like that. Sorry, I
[2:20:14] was out of the microphone. But anyhow,
[2:20:16] and I vent
[2:20:19] pick it up. Oh my goodness. This thing
[2:20:23] is gone. Oh, I feel so good. And I I
[2:20:29] I
[2:20:31] couldn't just about to testify. And I
[2:20:33] told my coworker, he already went with
[2:20:35] the Lord, too. But anyhow, I said I
[2:20:37] said, um,
[2:20:40] I need to remember his name. But anyhow,
[2:20:42] I went I said, "You know what, Rey?"
[2:20:46] uh he worked for a company that we did
[2:20:47] some machines for the company and stuff
[2:20:49] like that. Worked together. He was
[2:20:50] Catholic. But anyhow, I prayed for him
[2:20:53] many times. The Lord healed him. But
[2:20:55] anyhow, I said, "Ray, you remember my
[2:20:56] back?" I said, "I don't have it no
[2:20:59] more." I went and play around the ground
[2:21:02] almost. I said, "I can bend now. I can
[2:21:05] do anything. We can go on them presses
[2:21:06] and put them together. I'm not going to
[2:21:08] struggle no more." Completely healed.
[2:21:12] Completely healed. To this day,
[2:21:16] completely healed. No, no pain at all.
[2:21:20] Nothing.
[2:21:22] Now, is this too simple that somebody
[2:21:26] can see Jesus with their eyes and and
[2:21:27] still leave? I saw him. I saw him. I
[2:21:32] have seen him. I have heard him before
[2:21:35] many times like in the first dream and
[2:21:38] all the dreams and all the things but I
[2:21:39] have seen him with my known eyes.
[2:21:44] So, so if somebody comes to you, let's
[2:21:47] say an in-law sister or somebody
[2:21:51] or or some business people or or a
[2:21:53] school teacher comes to you and question
[2:21:56] your experience with the Lord and he
[2:21:59] questions your religion and what do you
[2:22:02] do for life?
[2:22:05] Well, tell them you know what? The same
[2:22:07] God that was with Moses
[2:22:12] came and revealed himself in a prophet
[2:22:16] named William Brham.
[2:22:18] And we have proof of that.
[2:22:22] Thousands of thousands of thousands and
[2:22:24] thousands and thousands of testimonies.
[2:22:27] So if I feel just I don't want to say
[2:22:30] this word I feel bad for them people who
[2:22:34] saw the man William Brandon
[2:22:38] like Judas saw Jesus and betrayed him.
[2:22:42] Paul never saw Jesus
[2:22:45] then he saw him after he was resurrected
[2:22:48] and and he wrote the New Testament and
[2:22:50] we believe it and is the true right. The
[2:22:53] sister probably remembers brother Renan.
[2:22:56] I see him on the dream. Um,
[2:23:00] so
[2:23:01] what I what I want the testimony to be
[2:23:05] is for you all that that what you
[2:23:08] believe is not just a religion.
[2:23:11] It is not just something that somebody
[2:23:14] came up a preacher went to your jail
[2:23:15] cell and says, "Hey buddy, you have to
[2:23:18] repent. You have to serve the Lord and
[2:23:20] because your your life is going to be
[2:23:22] better. your your your family situation
[2:23:25] is going to be better. Your marital
[2:23:27] situation is going to get better. Uh
[2:23:30] your in-laws is going to like you
[2:23:31] anymore. Um I mean more but anyhow
[2:23:34] because it happens anymore. But what I'm
[2:23:37] saying is this here is the God is true.
[2:23:42] You know what? This God that we serve is
[2:23:46] a living God. He's a living God and he
[2:23:49] proves himself over and over and over
[2:23:54] and over again. If somebody tries to go
[2:23:56] back in the old days, one 1937
[2:23:59] 454, well, brother Brandon was just
[2:24:01] preaching and he said the pope from the
[2:24:04] United States.
[2:24:06] It was a prophet who said it. And read
[2:24:10] the first sentences on the message. He
[2:24:13] was teaching in the Holy Spirit or of
[2:24:16] the Holy Spirit if you remember right.
[2:24:19] So that same Holy Spirit
[2:24:22] told the prophet you say this use his
[2:24:25] mouth and said it. And now ourselves we
[2:24:29] live to see it.
[2:24:31] That's part of it. There's so many
[2:24:33] things that are taking place in the
[2:24:34] world that there is a fact. There's
[2:24:36] there's there's there's true. This
[2:24:38] message is nothing but the truth.
[2:24:42] Two more and I'll finish. Okay, two more
[2:24:45] short ones
[2:24:47] about the word of God and the message.
[2:24:51] Jesus Christ is the same just today,
[2:24:53] today and forever. And whatever you go
[2:24:56] in life, whatever you do in life,
[2:24:57] whatever you go through,
[2:25:00] just testify of it.
[2:25:03] This message is good to live super good.
[2:25:08] This message is good to raise children.
[2:25:11] The best one. This message is good to
[2:25:14] raise grandchildren. The best one. I
[2:25:17] have a grandbaby. Okay. I have a
[2:25:20] grandbaby. Her name is Chilo. I was
[2:25:22] there in Jeffersonville, Indiana
[2:25:25] on a store there a Saturday getting
[2:25:27] groceries and stuff like that. I'm I'm
[2:25:29] cutting it down now. Um doing some
[2:25:32] groceries and things over there. And I'm
[2:25:34] going there. My wife is with the
[2:25:35] shopping cart. She's already moving over
[2:25:37] there. And then I'm getting some milk. I
[2:25:39] want organic milk. and I'm trying to get
[2:25:41] my milk. And there's a man on a little
[2:25:43] electric chair. He's moving around. And
[2:25:46] then he says, "You're a preacher."
[2:25:50] And I said, "No,
[2:25:52] you're you're a preacher." I said, "No,
[2:25:54] sir. I'm just, you know, you're a
[2:25:56] preacher."
[2:25:58] And I just tried to, you know, walk away
[2:26:01] from him and trying to get my milk. And
[2:26:03] he comes comes around. He said, "You're
[2:26:04] a preacher."
[2:26:07] Ah, he said, 'Well, let me tell you why.
[2:26:11] He said, 'The reason why I know you're a
[2:26:12] preacher because you don't want to do
[2:26:14] it. He said, 'Th that's the best sign
[2:26:16] that I can tell you. Because the Lord
[2:26:18] has been calling you for time and time
[2:26:20] and you don't want to do it. That's
[2:26:22] check that
[2:26:24] because you don't want to do it. I can
[2:26:26] tell you you're a preacher,
[2:26:29] he said. And let me tell you something
[2:26:30] else. And I then when he says that, I go
[2:26:33] back on time in history and I said,
[2:26:34] 'Well, he's got something in there
[2:26:38] and he says, "Well, prepare yourself
[2:26:41] because the Lord is getting ready to do
[2:26:44] great things and you know it when you
[2:26:47] see it."
[2:26:50] Then I got my milk and I move on. My
[2:26:52] wife's already getting ready to pay.
[2:26:54] He's on the other side. And I told my
[2:26:57] wife said, "That man, do you know?"
[2:26:58] Nope. I I don't recognize him around the
[2:27:02] area, Jeffersonville, some places, you
[2:27:04] know. And and I said, "This man told me
[2:27:07] this, that, and the other."
[2:27:10] We got in the car. He's still looking at
[2:27:11] me in the parking lot. Goes away. He's
[2:27:14] about 64, 67 years old, great. He's got
[2:27:16] a little ba baseball cap there. I'm
[2:27:19] sorry.
[2:27:21] Then he said, "Get ready because the
[2:27:23] Lord is getting ready to do great
[2:27:24] things." That's a Saturday.
[2:27:28] The next day I'm at the house trying to
[2:27:29] take a little nap after church. We went
[2:27:31] to a certain church. I can remember. But
[2:27:33] anyhow,
[2:27:35] and then my daughter Stephanie comes to
[2:27:37] the house and I'm trying to rest. And I
[2:27:40] even told my wife, "Please don't let
[2:27:42] anybody wake me. I'm just gone.
[2:27:45] I need to rest."
[2:27:48] And then there she comes. It was like
[2:27:50] three, five minutes of my sleep. No
[2:27:52] dream. Okay. I'm sleeping good. And then
[2:27:56] my wife says, "Well, you you need to get
[2:27:58] up. Isaiah and Stephanie are here. They
[2:28:01] need to talk to you." And we were
[2:28:03] waiting for grandb babies for a while.
[2:28:06] And then she comes in a little brown bag
[2:28:08] and she says, "Hey, pull a couple little
[2:28:11] shoes."
[2:28:13] Baby,
[2:28:15] to me, with all respects,
[2:28:18] grown baby means a whole lot.
[2:28:21] It It means a whole lot. it. Especially
[2:28:24] the first one, it means a whole lot. And
[2:28:27] then I went back to the night before
[2:28:30] that man told me
[2:28:33] the Lord is getting ready to do great
[2:28:37] things. To me, having a grandbaby
[2:28:41] is a mountaintop
[2:28:43] life achievement.
[2:28:45] Achievement. I mean, I'm talking about
[2:28:48] fulfillment.
[2:28:50] something that the Lord allowed me to
[2:28:51] have. That little girl is spiritual.
[2:28:56] Oh my goodness. That man told me that I
[2:28:59] was a preacher. I'm not a preacher. He
[2:29:01] told me the reason why is because you
[2:29:03] don't want to do it. The Lord has called
[2:29:04] me in the past to different things. I'm
[2:29:06] not going to go to details. You knew
[2:29:08] Brother Collins, right? Willard Collins
[2:29:11] was the pastor at the Brandon
[2:29:12] Tabernacle. Do you know him? Okay. He
[2:29:16] asked me to speak at the Brandon
[2:29:17] Tabernacle. I'm not going to go to that
[2:29:19] detail because the time the Lord showed
[2:29:22] me another dream. I was in Mexico and
[2:29:25] brother Collins asked me to speak at the
[2:29:27] Brown and Tabernacle
[2:29:29] when I was in Old Mexico because we
[2:29:31] travel a lot. Not anymore but we used to
[2:29:33] go back and foreign places. Okay. When I
[2:29:36] come to Indiana, he asked me to speak.
[2:29:40] You know how I feel, brother. If I was a
[2:29:43] man who wants to make a name or somebody
[2:29:45] of himself, I would have take the offer.
[2:29:48] I would to go to the best barber. I
[2:29:50] would to get my suit tied and my best
[2:29:53] shoes. I will prepare myself. I will
[2:29:55] pray and I will come and preach because
[2:29:57] I'm not preaching in Rome. I'm preaching
[2:30:00] at the Brown and Tabernacle.
[2:30:02] Right? But I didn't took the offering.
[2:30:05] And even on the same vision that the
[2:30:06] Lord told me, I refuse. I was shaken to
[2:30:10] pieces. He asked me to speak. Now I know
[2:30:14] why he asked me for it. I refused that
[2:30:16] offer. There were some other offers
[2:30:19] before different places and I said no.
[2:30:23] This message is the truth. Now when it
[2:30:26] comes to what I'm telling you about my
[2:30:28] personal testimony about the Lord about
[2:30:30] the oh the the the the hurricane in
[2:30:33] Florida Halen or Helen or whatever
[2:30:36] hurricane the Lord showed me a a dream.
[2:30:39] I'm talking to a man named Elias.
[2:30:42] not Pontious Pilate, Elias,
[2:30:46] a a friend of mine, relative, and we're
[2:30:48] talking. He's from Florida.
[2:30:51] In the dream, he's telling me the
[2:30:52] governor says that we need to leave
[2:30:54] because there's a terrible hurricane. He
[2:30:57] said, "My brothers and everybody from
[2:30:59] Orlando are packing up. They had to
[2:31:00] leave."
[2:31:02] I wake up and I told my wife, I said,
[2:31:04] "There's a there's a hurricane coming to
[2:31:06] to Florida. Elias was telling me and I
[2:31:09] can see the whole state of Florida from
[2:31:11] the tip to the tough underwater with
[2:31:14] this ice.
[2:31:16] And I told my wife, I said, "There's a
[2:31:18] hurricane coming. I saw it. I didn't
[2:31:21] tell nobody. If I go to a church and
[2:31:23] tell it, ah, brother, come on. You dream
[2:31:26] too much. You always told us that the 10
[2:31:28] dreams over there and this dream and
[2:31:30] this all the dream, you just dreaming
[2:31:31] too much." I would have told to Mr.
[2:31:34] Dantes. I would have called him and say,
[2:31:36] "Sir, get ready. There's a hurricane
[2:31:38] coming." I saw it with my own eyes and
[2:31:41] it happened to the letter like a week,
[2:31:44] week and a half. Then when I had the
[2:31:46] dream, I start checking,
[2:31:48] you know, the checker chair or or the
[2:31:50] hat or the shoe or the table, the
[2:31:52] guitar, right? I'm start checking for
[2:31:53] those details, right? Because I already
[2:31:55] saw it. Nothing. No hurricanes in the
[2:31:58] area. like a week after there he comes
[2:32:02] and he washes all Florida and I told
[2:32:06] many people right Maggie many people
[2:32:08] about it
[2:32:10] uh so I'm taking a lot of time uh
[2:32:12] forgive me for that I'm sorry I
[2:32:14] apologize for for all the time that I'm
[2:32:16] taking last one
[2:32:21] when it comes to an eyewitness
[2:32:24] of this message the Lord has given me
[2:32:27] privileges that not many people has had
[2:32:30] in their lives. Okay, I'm not going to
[2:32:33] go back to family roots or anything like
[2:32:34] that because that's no no heritage to
[2:32:37] brag about it. Not at all. But I can
[2:32:40] brag on the heritage of
[2:32:43] God's family and his word. That's the
[2:32:46] only thing that I have. Okay.
[2:32:51] I had the privilege
[2:32:54] to have a friendship with brother
[2:32:56] Willard Collins. He was the pastor of
[2:33:00] the Brandon Tabernacle for about 44
[2:33:02] years. Since brother Brandon passed
[2:33:04] away, he was already assistant pastor.
[2:33:07] And if you know the history, he moved to
[2:33:09] Arizona. When brother Brandon passed
[2:33:11] away, brother Neville gets sick. I know
[2:33:13] all details. They're they're my friends.
[2:33:15] I I can tell you the details about
[2:33:17] brother Neville and and things like that
[2:33:19] because the Lord gave me that privilege
[2:33:22] to go to their homes. They told me
[2:33:24] personal testimonies. Brother Wi uh
[2:33:28] Collins invented a machine to cut hate
[2:33:30] and things like that. I still have his
[2:33:31] business card at the house. He begged me
[2:33:33] to come and see the machine. I never
[2:33:35] went. I would have gone. But anyhow,
[2:33:39] I have been friends with brother
[2:33:42] Collins.
[2:33:44] He will ask me to preach at the brand
[2:33:46] tabernacle.
[2:33:47] I could have been the the janitor of the
[2:33:50] church. They will pay my rent in front
[2:33:51] of the brand tabernacle. I refuse that
[2:33:53] too.
[2:33:55] Brother Hickerson,
[2:33:58] he spent many times, hours with him.
[2:34:01] This is brother Brandon's friends.
[2:34:04] I got to work with the family.
[2:34:08] Brother Joseph Brandon, brother Billy
[2:34:10] Paul Brandon. When they asked me to work
[2:34:12] for them, the Lord showed me a vision.
[2:34:16] He sent somebody to tell me he needed to
[2:34:18] talk to me in the back of the church.
[2:34:20] The Lord then showed me the night before
[2:34:22] and I said, "Brother Eddie, it's Joseph
[2:34:25] Brandon. I'm going to meet him in the
[2:34:26] back of that corner church." He said,
[2:34:28] "Who told you?" Said, "The Holy Spirit."
[2:34:31] I went around and exactly I met him on
[2:34:33] the corner. He offered me a job. I I had
[2:34:37] duplicated. I had help with the
[2:34:39] translation. when they record the
[2:34:41] translations many tapes like Amnesia
[2:34:44] many many tapes different different
[2:34:45] languages on India French and different
[2:34:47] other countries and stuff like that by
[2:34:49] the thousands okay I I I try I well they
[2:34:53] translated them we we duplicate them
[2:34:56] make more okay I had the privilege that
[2:34:59] brother Billy Paul Brandon wrote a lot
[2:35:01] of paychecks for me
[2:35:04] okay so if somebody says well this that
[2:35:06] or the other I know these people
[2:35:11] especially like brother Collins,
[2:35:14] brother Hickerson, even Fred Sullman. I
[2:35:18] met him in a church. He said he was the
[2:35:20] Messiah. I said that's pretty heavy,
[2:35:22] man. He was not the Messiah.
[2:35:25] But he said it, right?
[2:35:29] And I'm saying this on this church.
[2:35:31] Anybody who's watching this video, the
[2:35:34] pastor is not saying this.
[2:35:37] Ed Moa is saying this not the pastor.
[2:35:41] Make sure you understand this here.
[2:35:44] So I had the privilege to know the
[2:35:46] friends of brother Brandon. They were
[2:35:49] and some is still alive are my friends.
[2:35:52] I could have wear their even their own
[2:35:55] clothes.
[2:35:57] I could have wear the president of Boys
[2:35:59] of God Recordings personal shoes and
[2:36:02] clothes and jackets if I wanted but I
[2:36:05] didn't want them.
[2:36:07] They help me so much. Okay. So, when it
[2:36:10] comes to this message, this message is
[2:36:11] true. If you know anything about history
[2:36:14] things in Jeffersonville, this that or
[2:36:16] the other. I I've been a person that I
[2:36:20] have dig into this message.
[2:36:23] I I don't I don't like to have it just
[2:36:25] here. I like to have it over here, too.
[2:36:27] When a question arise, I can have the
[2:36:29] answer right on the spot. I have the
[2:36:32] mysteries of God here written down.
[2:36:35] 1962, brother Brandon is is quoting the
[2:36:38] the mysteries the Mr. Scoffield put on
[2:36:39] the Bible. I know that I I can tell you
[2:36:42] what tape he said it because I had
[2:36:44] myself into the message. If somebody
[2:36:47] saying that, okay, okay, yes. Yes.
[2:36:49] That's when brother Brandon came over
[2:36:50] there and and the gun blew up and he
[2:36:52] went to brother Rattle's church and I
[2:36:55] can give you even the dates of the
[2:36:56] tapes. Like when somebody somebody says,
[2:36:58] "Well, I'm glad that brother Rena says
[2:37:00] um good evening friends." He called me a
[2:37:03] friend. I said, I can go a little bit
[2:37:05] beyond that. He calls me precious
[2:37:08] friend.
[2:37:10] Good evening, my precious friends. Right
[2:37:13] before he went to Arizona, he said it.
[2:37:16] Okay. And not only that, I got I got to
[2:37:18] stop.
[2:37:20] This word is the true.
[2:37:24] This word is the true. So, I encourage
[2:37:27] you to to not only believe it yourself,
[2:37:32] okay? Not only have it for your own
[2:37:36] personal, feel proud about it.
[2:37:40] Tell the world about it. What do you
[2:37:42] believe? The prophet William Mariam
[2:37:45] Brandon. Where is he from? Where? Well,
[2:37:48] here in Kentucky.
[2:37:50] What did he said? Nothing but the truth.
[2:37:54] He didn't preach nothing out of the
[2:37:56] Bible. Exactly. On the Bible. That was
[2:37:59] the prophet that was prophesied that
[2:38:01] will come on this age and we're
[2:38:04] privileged. We're not in Ghana.
[2:38:08] We're not in South America.
[2:38:11] We're not
[2:38:14] in Nepal.
[2:38:17] What's the name of this state? Kentucky.
[2:38:20] I think I said it right. This Kentucky.
[2:38:22] Okay.
[2:38:24] You're privileged people. You're
[2:38:26] privileged people. You should be on fire
[2:38:28] for this message. You should be on fire
[2:38:31] for this message. Wherever you go,
[2:38:34] whatever um whatever you do in life,
[2:38:38] refuse the things of life.
[2:38:42] The world is full of stuff
[2:38:45] to clog your eyes and your ears so you
[2:38:48] don't hear this still small voice. Do
[2:38:51] you have it? You had the greatest
[2:38:53] privilege
[2:38:54] that mankind ever had. So when you wake
[2:38:57] up in the morning tomorrow and you go
[2:39:00] about your lives,
[2:39:02] just realize who you are.
[2:39:05] You didn't body, you didn't deserve it.
[2:39:09] A lot of us, none of our forefathers
[2:39:11] were Christians filled with the Holy
[2:39:15] Spirit, you know, and and here we are
[2:39:18] understanding this message and the truth
[2:39:20] of God in our day. We need to get up in
[2:39:23] the morning and and with our children,
[2:39:26] grandchildren, co-workers, business
[2:39:29] people, you need to you need to go like
[2:39:31] a brother say up in Ohio. He went to a
[2:39:34] business place and they're trying to
[2:39:36] find a table for themselves so they can
[2:39:37] eat. He said he called the waiter. He
[2:39:40] said, "Hey, I'm the most important
[2:39:43] people or person that you're going to
[2:39:45] meet today.
[2:39:48] So, find me a seat. There will be no
[2:39:50] other guy more important than me sitting
[2:39:54] on your restaurant. That's why he said
[2:39:56] it. I didn't say it. Somebody said it.
[2:39:58] Okay. That's the way you have to leave.
[2:40:00] That's the way that's the way you go
[2:40:01] about life. Use the more important this
[2:40:04] the most important person on your
[2:40:07] business, brother Tommy. On your
[2:40:09] business is how do you do this? He helps
[2:40:12] me. He's my provider. He's my defender.
[2:40:16] He picked me out when I could not pick
[2:40:18] myself. I couldn't get myself together.
[2:40:21] And I tried this way and I tried this
[2:40:23] way and I could have put myself
[2:40:24] together, but he put me up. I'm not
[2:40:28] going to refuse that. I'm going to walk
[2:40:29] on this light and leave this message and
[2:40:32] tell others about it. Now, when it comes
[2:40:34] to the word of God, you know, this word
[2:40:36] is anointed. Okay? And there's anointing
[2:40:39] there's anointed preachers like brother
[2:40:41] Thomas here and many other brothers that
[2:40:44] preach with the anointing of the Holy
[2:40:46] Spirit of God. But there's one thing too
[2:40:48] that I think we're missing so much on
[2:40:51] the tapes. Talking about the tapes now
[2:40:54] because somebody makes a denomination on
[2:40:56] the tape. That means that the tape
[2:40:59] itself is denominated under something.
[2:41:03] That's the free word of God. Brother
[2:41:06] Brand has said it. We believe it.
[2:41:08] Finish. Right. The question is over.
[2:41:12] Oh my goodness. I had to stop. Was
[2:41:14] coming from Indianapolis. I was telling
[2:41:17] this John coworker about the meetings in
[2:41:20] Louisiana.
[2:41:21] Brother Wayne Lawson was preaching
[2:41:23] wonderful services years ago, the Holy
[2:41:26] Spirit falling upon the meetings. And I
[2:41:28] was just testifying to this young
[2:41:30] fellow. I want him to have what I have
[2:41:34] and he just don't have it. And I said,
[2:41:36] "Brother," I said, "Remember when
[2:41:38] brother Brand," because he knows a
[2:41:39] little bit about the message. He said,
[2:41:40] "Remember when brother Brandon went up
[2:41:42] to Metawaka, Indiana, and he goes over
[2:41:44] there and he sees these two people and
[2:41:47] then the black man comes, he's he's 80
[2:41:49] some years old and he's he's he said,
[2:41:51] "Well, brother, do you start preaching
[2:41:53] about, you know, from Genesis over, I'm
[2:41:55] going to go back before the horizontal
[2:41:57] rainbow and before the creation was ever
[2:41:59] what made and the Holy Spirit drop upon
[2:42:03] him and he said, "You don't have enough
[2:42:05] room for me to preach, right?" And
[2:42:08] brother Rana is sitting over there and
[2:42:09] he says, "Boy, if the Holy Spirit or
[2:42:11] what these people have can do that for
[2:42:13] that many, what it can do for me?" I was
[2:42:16] telling him that story
[2:42:20] word by word.
[2:42:23] He he turns his phone and then he start
[2:42:26] playing a tape,
[2:42:28] some tape, some message.
[2:42:30] The phone drops on the floor. He bends,
[2:42:33] picks the phone up.
[2:42:36] I'm glad you have a clock here, brother.
[2:42:37] That works better than that one. This is
[2:42:39] a pulpit. So, this is what you follow,
[2:42:41] not that one. Praise the Lord. But
[2:42:44] anyhow, he uh the phone drops, he picks
[2:42:49] the phone,
[2:42:51] the phone changed to a different tape,
[2:42:55] and he play exactly the words that I
[2:42:58] told him word by word.
[2:43:02] Right there. Wow. He didn't make it. I
[2:43:06] didn't tell him that they play exactly
[2:43:09] what I have say two minutes before,
[2:43:12] maybe a minute and a half. That means
[2:43:14] the Holy Spirit was pleased what I was
[2:43:17] telling him. And the Holy Spirit changed
[2:43:20] the tape, title, whatever was playing on
[2:43:23] that and put another sermon. And the
[2:43:26] Holy Spirit went and grabbed the very
[2:43:28] word and put it on the very minute, on
[2:43:30] the very instant, exactly what I was
[2:43:32] telling him. on the on the spot.
[2:43:38] My wife had a little plant tree over
[2:43:40] there on the house. It was a little palm
[2:43:42] tree or something that we bought
[2:43:43] somewhere in Alabama someplace over
[2:43:44] there. And and and one was doing good.
[2:43:47] The other one's not not doing too good.
[2:43:48] And I told her, "Well, just talk to the
[2:43:50] plant. Start talking to her. Tell her,
[2:43:52] "Well, get better. We like you. You
[2:43:54] know, do you you two look good at the
[2:43:56] house here? You know, talk to the palm
[2:43:58] tree."
[2:44:00] Roll Tommy. I go to work.
[2:44:06] She's playing a tape.
[2:44:08] Okay. She's playing a tape.
[2:44:12] She goes outside to talk to the palm
[2:44:14] tree.
[2:44:16] Brother Brandon is saying exactly what I
[2:44:19] told her. Brother Brandon said, "Isn't
[2:44:21] that a nice palm tree?"
[2:44:26] Did she make that happen?
[2:44:28] Did she plan to do that? Did she pick
[2:44:32] the the tape and the number and the
[2:44:34] words of brother Rana would say when she
[2:44:36] opened the door to go over there? She
[2:44:39] didn't do it. Hundreds of times I was
[2:44:42] healed of getting blind by hearing the
[2:44:45] tape. Perfect fa. The Lord heal my
[2:44:48] sight. The Lord.
[2:44:51] Oh my goodness. I need to stop. We were
[2:44:53] at the old house there in Mexico.
[2:44:54] Halisco. Little brick house is still
[2:44:56] there. Somebody called me the other day.
[2:44:57] They want to rent it out. They're going
[2:44:58] to have it anyhow. No, it's empty. They
[2:45:00] need to use it. They need to cut the
[2:45:01] trees and do some work on the house. But
[2:45:03] anyhow, I need somebody to move in the
[2:45:05] house. We're playing a sermon
[2:45:09] from Brother Brandon.
[2:45:11] Then my sister from the city comes and
[2:45:14] she's bringing some the nice bread type
[2:45:17] that you have over there. Uh the Mexican
[2:45:19] style sister over there from Guadalajara
[2:45:21] is famous. It's real good bread. But
[2:45:23] anyhow, and we're playing this tape
[2:45:27] and then they come, they park their work
[2:45:29] band. He's an electrician. He parks a
[2:45:31] white nice band over there. And I told
[2:45:33] my wife, I said, "We're hearing the
[2:45:34] tape." I said, "There's Stella, that's
[2:45:36] her name, my older sister, and Arturo,
[2:45:38] her husband." I said, "They're coming to
[2:45:40] the house. I don't know what to do for
[2:45:42] respect. I need to turn it off." But I
[2:45:46] said, "I'm not going to turn it off.
[2:45:48] They they if they need if they're coming
[2:45:50] to our home, it's a Wednesday night.
[2:45:51] We're hearing this tape. They need to
[2:45:53] wait till we finish. Then we go about
[2:45:55] their visit. Right. So, we're there and
[2:45:59] and then I said, "Well, I'mma I'm going
[2:46:02] to ask her to come in the house. There's
[2:46:04] plenty of seats and stuff. She can sit
[2:46:06] over here." And I go to the door.
[2:46:10] And I opened the door and she said, "Oh,
[2:46:13] uh, Lo is a nickname for it." And said,
[2:46:15] "Lo, uh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
[2:46:17] disturb you all. You guys are hearing
[2:46:19] that sermon. Uh uh but but we we wanted
[2:46:22] to breed you some bread.
[2:46:25] Imagine you have five kids and it's a
[2:46:27] big basket of bread and you got coffee
[2:46:29] and milk or something. You can have a
[2:46:31] jubilee before you go to bed, right? So
[2:46:34] she comes over there and I said, "Brian,
[2:46:36] my goodness, it's a good thing.
[2:46:38] Praise the Lord." And then
[2:46:43] sorry I missed one part. Thank you, Lord
[2:46:45] God.
[2:46:48] They park the truck, the van, and they
[2:46:50] come in front of the house. I know who
[2:46:52] they are. I know the vehicle that they
[2:46:54] drive. And and I go to open the door.
[2:46:57] And then Brother Brandon says on the
[2:46:58] tape, "And the children eats the bread
[2:47:03] that is sent for."
[2:47:07] And I go and open the door and I said,
[2:47:10] "Wait a minute. No, you you're not in
[2:47:11] trouble." I said, "Come on.
[2:47:15] We're hearing this tape from this
[2:47:16] American prophet. You need to hear what
[2:47:19] he said on the tape. Exactly what you
[2:47:22] told me.
[2:47:24] And the children, I may not put in the
[2:47:26] works exactly together. You older people
[2:47:29] must know this by memory.
[2:47:32] The children is the bread
[2:47:36] that is sent for. You can finish the
[2:47:38] phrase if you remember that part. Okay?
[2:47:41] And we're hearing that. So let me tell
[2:47:42] you by finish this. I'm not promoting
[2:47:46] anybody or anything. This is a testimony
[2:47:49] of what the Lord has done in our lives.
[2:47:51] Okay?
[2:47:53] That's all I can tell you.
[2:47:55] This word is anointed.
[2:47:59] This word can change your life. This
[2:48:03] word is eternal.
[2:48:06] Heavens and earth will pass and is
[2:48:08] passing but this war will remain. And
[2:48:13] what brother Brandon preach and record
[2:48:16] is still as good as it was in 59
[2:48:23] 36 37
[2:48:27] 65 and beyond.
[2:48:30] Okay. Is still the true. So, if you're
[2:48:34] thirsting and you're you don't know what
[2:48:36] to do in life, just grab yourself a
[2:48:38] tape,
[2:48:40] play it, and the Holy Spirit is going to
[2:48:41] give you the answer for it. The answer
[2:48:44] for it. And and and and and if you
[2:48:46] wonder why I scream and holler, "Amen."
[2:48:49] Not Gloria, but hallelujah. You know,
[2:48:52] something like that. And that order is
[2:48:54] because when I'm working or I'm driving,
[2:48:56] I have the prophet playing on my car and
[2:49:00] one tape. I can play one tape and I have
[2:49:04] enough anointing and I have enough
[2:49:08] fire on my life that I can go for years
[2:49:11] and then the the good part to have it on
[2:49:14] my heart that is right there is a store.
[2:49:18] It's right there. It's a store for a
[2:49:20] living because everything is going to
[2:49:21] fail. Everything is going to break apart
[2:49:23] and it's breaking apart. But if you have
[2:49:25] that word, what I encourage you is not
[2:49:27] so much have it in a physical or or a
[2:49:31] phone that you can play with it. Have it
[2:49:33] here that you can you can go back as you
[2:49:36] drive and as you do your life and you
[2:49:38] living, you can literally put a sermon
[2:49:40] together.
[2:49:42] If you're in the word of God, you can
[2:49:43] have everything you you you can quoted
[2:49:45] scriptures from from the beginning to
[2:49:48] the end. and h how how David was able to
[2:49:52] sing the the psalms by the Holy Spirit.
[2:49:56] How John was able to say
[2:49:59] he's the lamb of God because he was on
[2:50:02] the word of God and the Holy Spirit was
[2:50:03] there. Now our God is a living I need to
[2:50:08] stop.
[2:50:11] Our God is a living consuming fire.
[2:50:15] I if if if if we get in that channel
[2:50:20] of that you live in a revival 247.
[2:50:26] Amen.
[2:50:28] 24/7.
[2:50:30] That you're constantly on that revival.
[2:50:33] Constantly. Constantly. Constantly. When
[2:50:35] you talk to your kids. Oh my goodness. I
[2:50:37] I I just need to stop. My grandbaby
[2:50:40] Shiloh. My goodness. That testimony
[2:50:42] about great things.
[2:50:44] We was in Indiana. We told your sister
[2:50:46] about the meetings over there. You know,
[2:50:47] the brother from Texas and and Ohio,
[2:50:50] they came and preaching, you know.
[2:50:52] Anyhow, he this preacher George, he's
[2:50:56] preaching and everybody's
[2:50:59] like they don't know what he's talking
[2:51:01] about.
[2:51:02] And then he says something tremendous.
[2:51:05] Tremendous.
[2:51:07] Nobody said nothing. Not even me.
[2:51:12] And my grandbaby, she's on the back of
[2:51:14] the church. She's not even three years
[2:51:16] old.
[2:51:18] And she says, "Amen."
[2:51:22] And the preacher
[2:51:24] replies
[2:51:25] to that child's and notes,
[2:51:29] "Who's the only one who captured that
[2:51:31] word? Who's the only one who got what he
[2:51:34] said?"
[2:51:36] I told my my daughter, I said it was a
[2:51:38] child was saying amen and hallelujah and
[2:51:41] praise God and all that on the back. And
[2:51:44] when that preacher says something
[2:51:45] tremendous, that church would have gone
[2:51:47] fire. Everything was so quiet. But the
[2:51:51] baby said, "Amen."
[2:51:53] That old man told me, "Get ready. The
[2:51:56] Lord is getting ready to do great
[2:51:58] things. I'm not promoting my grandbaby
[2:52:00] to be a preacher.
[2:52:02] She's going to be a a housewife. Got if
[2:52:04] the Lord terries. Okay. I have two
[2:52:08] granddaughters. Neither one will be a
[2:52:09] preacher. Okay. If I ever have a
[2:52:12] grandson,
[2:52:14] then I can say he might be a preacher.
[2:52:17] Okay? But they're not going to be
[2:52:18] preachers. But John the Baptist was
[2:52:21] filled with the Holy Spirit before he
[2:52:24] even came to the earth. We believe that,
[2:52:27] right? So it's the Bible. So these days
[2:52:31] that we're living, if somebody comes to
[2:52:34] you with something, you know, so and so
[2:52:37] is making a video about this and about
[2:52:39] that foolishness.
[2:52:42] That's not right.
[2:52:45] If there's a way in the word of God and
[2:52:48] in the message, pray for the person. If
[2:52:51] the word of God says, "Oh my good, I
[2:52:53] need to say this.
[2:52:57] Anything that it has been said or it
[2:53:00] could have been said
[2:53:04] about the son of man Jesus in flesh will
[2:53:08] be forgiven. Right? He said but when the
[2:53:11] holy spirit come when the spirit of
[2:53:13] truth comes
[2:53:15] one word
[2:53:17] against it will not be forgiven on this
[2:53:22] world nor the world to come.
[2:53:27] That's tremendous.
[2:53:29] I If I had a little thought, brother
[2:53:31] Tom, if I have a little negative
[2:53:34] something there, I will blow it before
[2:53:37] it even gets half a word.
[2:53:40] Blow it away because this is the true.
[2:53:43] Nothing but the truth. This word is
[2:53:46] true. So,
[2:53:49] I'm here to testify and to tell you that
[2:53:53] this message is alive. The Holy Spirit
[2:53:56] is alive. Jesus is going to come for a
[2:53:58] bride. She's making herself ready. And
[2:54:02] then she's receiving the earnest.
[2:54:06] And with the earnest, there is
[2:54:07] dividends.
[2:54:09] The dividends on the conversation,
[2:54:11] sister, with the doctor. That's part of
[2:54:14] the dividends. And that proves that it's
[2:54:16] a resurrection because something is
[2:54:18] already broken or or or damaged and then
[2:54:21] all of a sudden just comes again.
[2:54:23] That's creation.
[2:54:25] That's God creating again. Not in a
[2:54:28] younger person. The reason why I'm
[2:54:30] giving this testimony because I'll be 50
[2:54:32] years old in August the second this
[2:54:35] year, God willing and I don't want to
[2:54:37] wait no more. Brother Brandon said, I'm
[2:54:40] getting to be an old man and I' I'm an
[2:54:42] old man now. He died at 54. I'm an old
[2:54:45] man and I'm not going to let another
[2:54:47] day,
[2:54:49] another week
[2:54:51] without me telling anybody
[2:54:56] to encourage the church, to encourage
[2:54:58] the believers. That's that's the
[2:55:00] testimony. What the testimony does and
[2:55:03] and and and and to get another one that
[2:55:05] might be interested into light and and
[2:55:09] not only well I well well No brother,
[2:55:15] here
[2:55:17] your water baptism is wrong is on the
[2:55:20] Bible.
[2:55:22] The only light in the world is on this
[2:55:25] message.
[2:55:27] You mean to tell me that the only pastor
[2:55:29] in this whole county or three to four,
[2:55:31] five counties around, the only pastor
[2:55:33] that has light is him? Yes, sir. I'm
[2:55:36] telling you that he's the only one. No
[2:55:39] other one.
[2:55:41] Okay. So if you're the only one, you
[2:55:44] should leave. You should talk. You
[2:55:46] should conduct yourselves that way.
[2:55:47] You're the only light. So when it comes
[2:55:49] to any situation, don't back.
[2:55:53] Not even the dirt behind the sole of
[2:55:55] your shoot on the devil.
[2:55:58] Not even that much back on the devil.
[2:56:01] nothing when it comes to dressing for
[2:56:03] for ladies,
[2:56:05] when it comes to to the word of God,
[2:56:08] when it comes to faith, when it comes to
[2:56:11] believing,
[2:56:14] nothing. I have burned all my bridges.
[2:56:18] All of them. I have I don't have nothing
[2:56:20] to go back to it, but I have a lot to go
[2:56:23] forward. Have a lot to go forward. And
[2:56:27] and I'm I'm pressing on for that because
[2:56:30] it's so good to be a message believer.
[2:56:33] It's so good to be a message believer.
[2:56:35] It's so good to know that William
[2:56:36] Brandon was God's prophet.
[2:56:39] It's so good to know that and testify
[2:56:41] about it everywhere I go. And it's so
[2:56:44] good to know that the God of William
[2:56:46] Brandon lives on flesh.
[2:56:50] Your flesh. Your flesh can be anointed
[2:56:53] and you can see visions and you can
[2:56:55] prophesy according to the spirit and the
[2:57:00] time of the spirit with this word. And
[2:57:03] it's not limited. A sister can see a
[2:57:05] vision about her ditches, about her
[2:57:07] broken machine. Oh my goodness. God
[2:57:10] bless you. I had to stop. It's just too
[2:57:12] much. Brother Tom, God bless you.
[2:57:19] God bless you.
[2:57:24] Amen. Appreciate that.
[2:57:26] All right. Who's I didn't know who's
[2:57:29] next. I was going to say, but we
[2:57:31] appreciate that, brother Ed. God bless
[2:57:33] you to hear that God is still working in
[2:57:35] our hearts and lives like that. Amen.
[2:57:37] Praise the Lord. So, Amen. It's
[2:57:40] certainly good. Wasn't that time just
[2:57:41] flew by? I don't know about you, but it
[2:57:43] just flew by. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:57:48] Hallelujah. Well, brother, I tell you
[2:57:51] what, he told me he had stories to tell,
[2:57:53] and I'm sure that's just a fraction of
[2:57:55] what you got. So, it's certainly good to
[2:57:57] see how God works. Amen. I really like
[2:58:00] the one thing he said about the Bible
[2:58:04] and the message of the hour is the
[2:58:07] truth. How many believes that? That's
[2:58:08] that's our absolute. Amen.
[2:58:11] Praise the Lord. That is our absolute.
[2:58:14] And uh everything I say, everything but
[2:58:17] anybody says has to line up with that.
[2:58:20] Praise the Lord.
[2:58:22] Praise the Lord. We made history
[2:58:23] tonight. Amen. 33 years. We've never
[2:58:26] went this long on Wednesday night. So,
[2:58:29] brother, you made history tonight. God
[2:58:31] bless you.
[2:58:35] Amen. Didn't hurt us a bit, did it? No.
[2:58:39] Didn't hurt us a bit. Amen. I'll tell
[2:58:41] you what, you know, they used to Paul
[2:58:43] used to have what? All night meetings,
[2:58:45] you know, all night long with who's
[2:58:48] next, you know, and let's testify some
[2:58:50] more of this great God that we serve.
[2:58:52] Amen. So, let's stand tonight. Amen. I
[2:58:56] think we'll just have prayer and let you
[2:58:58] go. Amen. And so, how many have really
[2:59:01] appreciated that testimony? Let's give
[2:59:03] him a hand. God bless you, brother Ed.
[2:59:05] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:59:10] Lord Jesus, we humbly come before you,
[2:59:12] Lord Jesus. And we have heard tonight,
[2:59:14] Father, in a great way, Lord Jesus, how
[2:59:17] that you still show visions, how you
[2:59:19] still work in dreams, Lord Jesus. And
[2:59:22] we're never we're never afraid to hear
[2:59:24] somebody testify of thus sayeth the
[2:59:27] Lord, this is going to happen or Lord,
[2:59:29] because we know and been taught by your
[2:59:31] prophet that Lord, if it truly is of
[2:59:33] God, we ain't got to worry about it.
[2:59:35] It's going to take place. And Lord, to
[2:59:38] hear, Father, that this brother has had
[2:59:40] these visions and these dreams and it
[2:59:42] really did come to pl come to pass,
[2:59:44] Father. Lord Jesus, that means it's of
[2:59:47] you. And we pray, God, that you would
[2:59:49] continue to work in this congregation,
[2:59:50] Lord, each and every one of our hearts,
[2:59:52] Father, that's full of your spirit, Lord
[2:59:55] Jesus. Work in us in a mighty way. Help
[2:59:57] us to realize that you're not dead.
[2:59:59] You're not just a God of history, but
[3:00:01] you're a God that's present, Father.
[3:00:03] Lord Jesus, we so much see it, Father.
[3:00:06] Even in the working of the miracle, Lord
[3:00:08] Jesus, in my wife, Father, Lord, we see
[3:00:10] you working, Lord Jesus. And we know
[3:00:12] that each and everyone in here, Lord
[3:00:14] Jesus. Father, you're working in their
[3:00:16] lives, Lord Jesus. Work among us, keep
[3:00:19] working among us, Lord. Help us to see
[3:00:21] you. And as our brother said, not to
[3:00:23] keep our eyes on the things of the world
[3:00:25] or to be too entangled in the things of
[3:00:27] the world, but more in prayer. Lord
[3:00:30] Jesus, help us to be the kind of people
[3:00:32] that it wouldn't be nothing for us to
[3:00:34] really have an all night prayer meeting
[3:00:36] to talk about the Lord. Amen. All night
[3:00:38] long, Lord Jesus. Father, we do thank
[3:00:41] you for this service. And we know that
[3:00:42] it went long, Lord. But that's okay,
[3:00:45] Lord. We needed a service that went
[3:00:47] longer than what we're used to, Father.
[3:00:49] And I do pray for each and every one,
[3:00:51] God, for the sacrifice and the patience
[3:00:53] that they've had, Lord. that you'd make
[3:00:55] give them an extra good sleep for the
[3:00:57] morning, Lord, so they'd be ready to go
[3:00:58] to work in the morning and truly get up
[3:01:01] and thank you, Father, for being
[3:01:02] privileged people, Father, when
[3:01:05] thousands of around us, Lord Jesus,
[3:01:07] don't know you, you picked us, Lord
[3:01:09] Jesus. And we're so grateful, Lord God,
[3:01:11] for the work of grace that you did in
[3:01:13] our lives, Lord Jesus. Now, Father, we
[3:01:16] come to a close of this service and we
[3:01:17] ask, God, that go with each one, Lord
[3:01:20] Jesus. each one that has driven far,
[3:01:22] give him traveling mercies, Lord Jesus,
[3:01:25] and help us to ponder these things that
[3:01:26] we have heard, Lord Jesus, and
[3:01:28] appreciate them in Jesus name. Amen. And
[3:01:31] amen. God bless you. You're dismissed.
