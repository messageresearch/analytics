[46:22] what you have to say to the church
[46:24] tonight God we ask in Jesus name amen
[46:27] turn your bibles if you will right into
[46:30] 1 Corinthians the 14th chapter First
[46:33] Corinthians
[46:54] 14
[46:57] 6 through 8 now Brethren I come if I
[47:01] come unto you speaking with
[47:06] tongu or by knowledge or by
[47:09] prophesying or by
[47:11] Doctrine and even things without Life
[47:15] Giving
[47:16] sound whether pipe or
[47:19] harp except they give a distinction in
[47:22] the sounds how shall it be known what is
[47:26] piped or
[47:30] harped for if the trumpet gives an
[47:32] uncertain sound who shall prepare
[47:36] himself to battle may God add His
[47:38] blessings to the reading of the word you
[47:40] can be seated now how many knows what
[47:43] message brother Brandon preached out of
[47:45] that
[47:48] one the uncertain sound that's right
[47:53] uncertain sound well that's not what
[47:55] we're preaching on the uncertain sound
[47:58] we're actually want to preach on the
[48:00] absolute amen the absolute I called it
[48:04] the Christians absolute this is back on
[48:07] kind of on our series amen the overview
[48:09] of a Christian the Christians absolute
[48:13] amen amen and I'm going to read another
[48:16] scripture um let me see over
[48:19] in Matthew I believe it
[48:24] is Matthew 6
[48:27] 16 and we'll begin with
[48:31] verse
[48:33] 13 when Jesus came into the coast of
[48:35] cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples
[48:39] saying whom do men say that I
[48:41] the and they said some say that thou art
[48:44] John the Baptist and some Elias and
[48:47] others J Jeremiah so one of the prophets
[48:49] and he said unto them but who say ye
[48:52] that I am and Simon Peter answered and
[48:55] and said Thou Art the Christ son of the
[48:58] Living God and Jesus answered and said
[49:01] unto him blessed are thou Simon bar
[49:04] Jonas for flesh and blood is not
[49:07] revealed it unto you but my Father which
[49:08] is in heaven and I say unto thee Thou
[49:11] Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will
[49:14] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[49:18] shall not Prevail against them amen so
[49:23] what a different tune in
[49:26] right one of them talks about an
[49:28] uncertain sound now nobody knowing just
[49:30] exactly what to do I mean and what do
[49:33] you do when you don't know what to do
[49:36] pretty much nothing you wait until you
[49:38] know what you're going to do you don't
[49:40] go presumptuously amen amen I was
[49:43] listening to uh I think the Bible
[49:45] yesterday and God had told him not to go
[49:47] up and fight against this certain uh
[49:49] enemy and so forth and but they presumed
[49:52] to go anyway and presumed and went after
[49:55] and I thought but that's right brother B
[49:56] preach a message on presuming don't go
[49:59] presuming you want to make sure of what
[50:01] you're doing amen so I thought I'd start
[50:04] out first of all if we're going to talk
[50:05] about absolute we want to talk about
[50:07] perhaps something that's uncertain or
[50:10] amen said it's something brother B
[50:13] called amen preaching on uncertain
[50:16] uncertain
[50:18] uncertainty
[50:20] amen amen and then we want to talk about
[50:22] that absolute brother bam says now we're
[50:24] living in a day of great
[50:27] uncertainty we all know
[50:34] [Applause]
[50:35] that
[50:37] amen there is great you talk about back
[50:41] in the 60s or 50s when he preached this
[50:43] in
[50:45] 1960 great uncertainty he
[50:48] said how manyan knows anytime anybody's
[50:52] outside of Christ it's always uncertain
[50:55] there's no certainty outside of Jesus
[51:00] Christ
[51:05] amen amen I've got a few out here this
[51:09] way amen we all know that the day of
[51:11] uncertainty time of
[51:13] uncertainty I don't believe that there
[51:16] ever was a time since the time first
[51:18] began back in the Garden of Eden When
[51:21] sin come in and broke eternity into time
[51:24] I do not believe there's ever been a
[51:26] space of time with so much
[51:31] uncertainty as
[51:34] today because there's not even one hope
[51:37] left in the natural
[51:40] world
[51:42] today now you say well I've seen times
[51:45] and reading history when the wars
[51:47] covered the earth that is true but never
[51:49] a time when the whole world could be
[51:53] blowed up or would be blowed up to
[51:55] people Jesus
[51:57] just second and such a
[52:01] destruction he says it it take weeks and
[52:04] hours and so forth now it just takes one
[52:07] minute maybe not that just a button
[52:11] press and she's all over Cuba can do it
[52:15] herself that little bitty Haiti could do
[52:18] it just any little nation that wants to
[52:20] can set the whole world completely on
[52:24] fire and blow her out of her orbit
[52:27] anytime they want to see it only
[52:31] takes one
[52:33] ftic well there's tens of millions and
[52:36] billions around the world to do that we
[52:38] shouldn't have a lot of Fanatics don't
[52:40] we watch some suicide case just reach up
[52:43] there and be to be among them and the
[52:46] devil so possess him just where this big
[52:49] these big hangers are hanging and just
[52:51] press that button and here they go amen
[52:55] get the wrong guy in

[58:20] how glad for an
[58:22] absolute as I was hearing a man speak
[58:27] or talk not long ago and he used the
[58:29] word absolute and I thought that's a
[58:31] very fine word perhaps he says I hear it
[58:34] used so many
[58:38] times
[58:41] absolutely and I looked up in the
[58:43] dictionary and Webster according to
[58:45] Webster it's perfect in itself it's
[58:48] Unlimited in its power primarily an
[58:50] ultimate an ultimate means that's all
[58:53] it's an absolute
[58:55] unlimited power amen the word absolute
[58:58] is perfect in itself he kind of repeats
[59:00] your amen and I thought that's a
[59:02] glorious thing
[59:05] that a
[59:07] Wonder
[59:09] wonderful
[59:12] word
[59:15] [Music]
[59:17] amen body should have an
[59:20] ultimate and every great achievement
[59:23] that's ever been achieved
[59:25] has to have an absolute behind
[59:32] it no matter what it
[59:35] is it's had an absolute behind it that's
[59:38] that's the final line back through this
[59:41] he says
[59:43] now listen it's an ultimate it meets an
[59:46] called an anchor
[59:49] amen the anchor
[59:52] absolute it's a fin
[59:55] tying post to every achievement amen and
[1:00:01] how the enemy in every way that he can
[1:00:03] will try to get you away from that app
[1:00:07] from that anchor that they in Egypt they
[1:00:10] got cornered there by the Red Sea
[1:00:12] mountains on one side Valley on the
[1:00:14] other Red Sea no escape nowhere no way

[1:25:33] how much you argue you're still
[1:25:35] wrong amen you love him praise the Lord
[1:25:40] all right let's go down to a few other
[1:25:44] things shall we brother bam talks about
[1:25:46] the Stars there's a lot of stars out
[1:25:48] there how many know every other every
[1:25:51] Star out there rotates it
[1:25:54] moves we could even look at the Seven
[1:25:56] Stars they come and they go they rotate
[1:26:00] but there's one star that's out there
[1:26:02] that does not
[1:26:03] move how many of these there's it does
[1:26:06] it just stays right there it's Christ
[1:26:10] it's his word it stays the same
[1:26:13] yesterday today and forever for our lost
[1:26:16] person amen all you got to do is to look
[1:26:18] at that North Star you'll know where
[1:26:20] you're at but every another star moves
[1:26:24] you can't rely on that stay with the
[1:26:26] North Star a lot of people got a
[1:26:28] revelation to this out of the other but
[1:26:30] you better stay with the North
[1:26:32] Star oh my listen to what he says you
[1:26:34] know we got a lot of stars but there's
[1:26:36] only one true star that don't move
[1:26:39] that's a nor star cuz he sits in the
[1:26:41] center of the earth no matter where
[1:26:43] you're whether you're on the back side
[1:26:46] upside wherever you're at the North
[1:26:48] Stars is just the same it's your North
[1:26:51] Star now see
[1:26:52] there's a lot of stars place but if
[1:26:55] you're in the sea any Sean knows any
[1:26:58] hunter knows that roams the woods knows
[1:27:00] your North Star is the your place that's
[1:27:03] all then it's like your compass your
[1:27:06] compass won't point you to Mars or
[1:27:08] Jupiter or somewhere else It'll point
[1:27:10] you to the north star that is your
[1:27:14] absolute no matter what your experience
[1:27:17] is then if something you tells you the
[1:27:19] Bible isn't true the power of God the
[1:27:22] Apostles the prophets the pastors the
[1:27:23] teachers the gift of the spirit just
[1:27:26] isn't the same as it was when it flowed
[1:27:28] through the apostles at Pentecost
[1:27:30] there's something wrong with your
[1:27:33] absolute it has to tie to a
[1:27:35] denominational Creed instead of the
[1:27:37] Bible amen when he said both heavens and
[1:27:40] earth will pass away but my absolute
[1:27:42] will never pass
[1:27:44] away

[1:28:20] perfect no everyone of us would say no
[1:28:23] I've seen some guys call an imperfect
[1:28:25] call but guess what if he called it
[1:28:28] that's what it

[1:30:22] you know you get a preacher I've been
[1:30:25] I've been slacked there's times where I
[1:30:26] just did not deal with things the way I
[1:30:28] should have
[1:30:30] hello and if you let things go it only
[1:30:32] gets worse it's just like kids is't that
[1:30:34] right if you let it get you let it go it
[1:30:36] gets worse somebody has to call it out
[1:30:39] somebody got to deal with it amen you

[1:30:45] white even though sometimes you don't
[1:30:47] want to it te to hide off of you but you
[1:30:50] got to do it
[1:30:56] amen got to have an absolute he's he's
[1:30:58] the absolute anyway even if you don't
[1:31:00] like him he's the absolute his word is
[1:31:03] final no matter what you say about it
[1:31:07] it's that way now if you didn't the
[1:31:10] whole game would go into
[1:31:15] chaos that's what he
[1:31:17] says how many knows that we've arrived
[1:31:20] there the world has arrived there
[1:31:22] that one of the first things quotes that
[1:31:25] I remember that came to my
[1:31:29] mind amen when I thought about this
[1:31:32] absolute was a little bit further back
[1:31:35] here brother man makes a stat me let me
[1:31:38] tell you I'll tell you now no sir
[1:31:41] politics will never work no sir
[1:31:43] democracy will never work democracy is
[1:31:46] rotten to the
[1:31:48] Bone now I'm going to ask you kind of a
[1:31:51] and I like to ask a question
[1:31:55] sometimes what would it take for
[1:31:57] democracy to
[1:32:01] work what would it take for what does it
[1:32:04] take for a democracy like America to
[1:32:09] work it's something
[1:32:12] that some of our for forefathers even
[1:32:15] said who should run
[1:32:18] it who should run the Democracy in order
[1:32:21] for to work who should run it do you
[1:32:25] know well I'm fixing to tell
[1:32:28] you if it could be
[1:32:34] run and if I'm not wrong some of our
[1:32:36] forefathers even said that that if it's
[1:32:38] as long as it's run by Christians it'll
[1:32:44] work but when you put it out there in
[1:32:47] the world it becomes all sales and no no
[1:32:53] anchor Amen in other words there's no
[1:32:56] absolute anymore when unbelievers and
[1:33:00] sinners get a hold of
[1:33:02] it
[1:33:06] amen how many knows the left how bad
[1:33:09] they hated when Trump put what three
[1:33:12] conservative justices they got lost
[1:33:14] their
[1:33:16] minds they loost their
[1:33:20] minds another is five decades we've been
[1:33:24] put back because you're going to be
[1:33:25] there on for a lifetime they just lose
[1:33:27] lost their mind they went conservative
[1:33:29] judges on there that won't really uphold
[1:33:33] the
[1:33:39] Constitution
[1:33:42] amen that's the truth cuz how many
[1:33:45] know uh uh rule on a certain way that's
[1:33:49] how it'll be cuz they are the ultimate
