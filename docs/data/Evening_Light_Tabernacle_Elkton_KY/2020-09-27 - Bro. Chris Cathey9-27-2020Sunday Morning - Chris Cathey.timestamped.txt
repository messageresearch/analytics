[17:18] that was wrecked and

[17:27] pulled me from the maori clay and
[17:28] you might be sitting here from the
[17:30] baptist or catholic wherever you were
[17:32] but god picked you up this morning i'll
[17:34] tell you if you got a family that
[17:35] believes this message
[17:36] you should be thankful this morning you
[17:39] have a family that you i can't call my
[17:40] dad today and say dad i can't believe
[17:42] this quote i found her the word of god i
[17:44] found he wants to hang the phone up
[17:46] because he's like son i i don't know
[17:48] what you went into i said dad this is
[17:50] the best thing that ever happened to me
[17:52] i tell you once i saw the revelation of
[17:54] god i saw more than just a man i saw
[17:57] i saw god in a man i saw god and a man i
[18:00] know you got to get past
[18:01] the past you know somebody wants to get
[18:03] hung up on the man but it was god in
[18:05] that man
[18:06] i tell you he led just like he led moses
[18:08] he said moses went down the bush in
[18:10] more than five minutes of his whole
[18:12] ministry when he went to the bush
[18:14] he said it changed his life five minutes
[18:17] changed his life
[18:18] and i'll tell you sometimes there's no
[18:20] matter if you've been in that message 50
[18:21] years or 100 years or whatever it is
[18:24] i'll tell you we need to have something
[18:25] united this morning
[18:27] we need to re-light our candle this
[18:29] morning and say where is your faith this
[18:31] morning
[18:32] i tell you sometimes we want to we want
[18:34] to rely and say uh well you know
[18:36] this virus i'm not saying there's not a
[18:38] virus out here but i'll tell you there's
[18:40] god that's greater than this virus
[18:42] there's a god that i put my trust in and
[18:45] every waking minute i have
[18:46] my breath comes from god i'll tell you
[18:49] guys when you lay down at night
[18:50] and you realize you're one heartbeat
[18:52] away from not waking up
[18:54] i tell you but when you trust in god you
[18:56] just sleep like a baby
[18:58] i tell you why when you when you lay
[19:00] down at night put your head my wife's
[19:02] like man you were out
[19:03] you were gone i couldn't wake you up if
[19:05] someone broke in the house you no one
[19:07] would even know
[19:08] she said i'd have to wake you up i said
[19:10] but you know what because
[19:11] i just i'm resting in god when i'm gone
[19:15] and when i'm in the bed i'm out
[19:18] because i know if i don't wake up i'm in
[19:20] glory
[19:21] i crossed over jordan i it don't matter
[19:25] but i tell you church i think there's a
[19:26] time in our lives where
[19:28] the bride of fight the brother christ
[19:30] the devil is trying to come after
[19:31] the bride as strong as he can two
[19:34] hundred thousand thousand demons just
[19:36] released on this earth
[19:38] and they're chasing the bride this
[19:39] morning they got these churches they got
[19:41] the people they got
[19:42] they got the world i'm not saying to be
[19:45] them because the same person that
[19:47] i was can be witness to and they could
[19:49] by your life or
[19:50] whatever and they could see the message
[19:52] of the hour we're still here this
[19:54] morning we
[19:54] we need someone to keep witnessing not
[19:56] just me or other buyer
[19:58] but you as well because someone in your
[20:01] church places could be that last seed
[20:03] it could be that last seat we're waiting
[20:05] on for us to get out of here
[20:07] and i'll tell you a church there's a
[20:08] pest house out here everywhere you go
[20:11] it's filth everywhere you go every time
[20:14] i get up i kinda just
[20:15] say lord help me this morning we're
[20:17] gonna have to get up in this filthy land
[20:19] but church between that six and nine
[20:21] hours i'm waiting for
[20:23] between that six to nine hour i every
[20:25] morning i get up i say lord
[20:27] this could be it i get in the car and i
[20:29] start to drive and it's still not nine
[20:31] o'clock and i'm still looking
[20:33] yeah i'm rolling down the window i'm
[20:35] nowhere i don't know what's going to
[20:36] happen but
[20:37] church i don't have all the answers but
[20:38] god does i might not know the whole book
[20:41] but i know the author of the book this
[20:42] morning
[20:44] i tell you we gotta get anchored in
[20:45] christ we got the bride of christ going
[20:48] around on earth and
[20:49] we got we we say we believe a message
[20:52] what does that mean
[20:54] we say we carry books and we believe
[20:56] this tape and we quote this quote but do
[20:58] we really believe what we believe
[21:01] i'll tell you church this time get
[21:02] anchored in christ this morning
[21:04] it's time to get the anchor of christ in
[21:06] your life and say i
[21:07] trust god greater is he that's he that's
[21:10] he that's in me that he that's in the
[21:11] world
[21:12] that's just not a scripture this morning
[21:14] that's the truth this morning
[21:17] i'll tell you we got to trust in that
[21:18] but he looked at even the disciples and
[21:20] they were frantic and then here comes
[21:21] the storm
[21:22] i believe storms are everywhere this
[21:24] morning i believe there's a virus in the
[21:26] land and there's
[21:27] this land but god is god sees it all
[21:31] god sees all this you don't thank god
[21:32] before the foundation of the world saw a
[21:34] virus coming in the land
[21:36] i believe it's an old city keeps going
[21:38] keep coming happening
[21:39] but i tell you what the bride is making
[21:41] herself ready she's clothing herself
[21:44] she's clothing herself in the word she's
[21:46] listening to the tapes
[21:48] she's making herself ready not just me
[21:50] but brother byler
[21:51] but you and you yourself not just on a
[21:54] sunday or
[21:55] a thursday or wednesday service but i'm
[21:57] telling you church
[21:58] it's the daily walk with christ i'll
[22:01] tell you i see the bride it's just
[22:02] like brother bram saw him he saw the
[22:04] brothers the end time he saw the bride
[22:06] getting out of line
[22:07] and he started seeing him get that line
[22:09] he started screaming get back in line
[22:10] i believe that's happening this morning
[22:12] i believe i see what brother bram saw
[22:15] when he started seeing the bride just
[22:16] started slipping away or oh
[22:18] well i could just come to church one day
[22:20] and i could go and do this
[22:21] and go do you know what every time the
[22:23] church door is open we should be at
[22:25] church
[22:26] home we should be bringing our kids to
[22:27] church like come on let's get a touch
[22:29] from god this morning
[22:31] not a touch from me but from god this
[22:33] morning i'll tell you
[22:34] a week away the the day we're living in
[22:37] it's dark out there
[22:38] but there's got and there's light
[22:40] in the evening time
[22:42] i'm glad brother brown the last he had
[22:44] to laugh right here
[22:45] he had the last episode a little life
[22:46] for me and you this morning
[22:48] in the last days because he saw lebron
[22:51] that was getting out of here
[22:53] you we might look out number but we're
[22:54] not outnumbered this morning
[22:56] we're not outnumbered if you could just
[22:58] see along these walls or
[22:59] you can see through this place i'm
[23:01] telling you church you'd wake you up
[23:03] this morning
[23:03] it'll put something in you it'll make
[23:05] you walk different active or talk
[23:07] different
[23:08] if you can just see these walls this
[23:09] morning you see the angels they kept
[23:11] them out of them
[23:12] oh by the word of god he says they ain't
[23:14] careful by us that fear god
[23:16] they don't just they're just not you
[23:18] know we're just not coming to church to
[23:20] play churches
[23:21] it's time to make business this morning
[23:23] it's time to come with a
[23:24] seal in your heart and say lord i want
[23:26] more faith
[23:28] i'm tired of living in fear and anxiety
[23:30] and depression
[23:31] i tell you church brother brown talks
[23:33] about you know he has the statue of a
[23:35] perfect man and you got faith at the
[23:37] bottom
[23:38] and you got virtue knowledge timber is
[23:40] patience brotherly kindness and love
[23:43] well i think our our foundation is not
[23:46] built on faith this morning
[23:48] it might be built on something else lost
[23:50] or something of the world this morning
[23:51] but i'm telling you church we got to get
[23:53] our foundation built on
[23:54] faith this morning you know when i'm
[23:57] building a house and they started
[23:58] digging the footers i was building the
[24:00] house
[24:00] the other the other month and they
[24:02] started they called me up said we had to
[24:03] go six foot deeper
[24:04] because we didn't hit solid ground i
[24:06] said oh goodness because then we had
[24:08] more rock and more rock and it cost more
[24:10] and started raising the price up but we
[24:12] didn't know until we got in there
[24:13] they kept digging to the hip solid
[24:15] ground i think this morning we got gotta

[24:28] people's church and
[24:29] i said well we could we pray for him but
[24:31] i tell you it takes the faith of god
[24:33] that's going to get you out of here it's
[24:35] the faith of god trusting in god
[24:37] that builders maker like abraham his
[24:40] billiard maker was god
[24:42] everything i have now my cars my house
[24:45] everything we have
[24:46] it's it's gonna all burn up but i'll
[24:48] tell you church if we just
[24:49] believe in the author this morning this
[24:52] word he said heavens and earth and
[24:53] will pass away but my word of god will
[24:55] not we gotta get claimed in the world
[24:58] we gotta clothe ourselves i don't i tell
[25:01] you what church i'm not
[25:02] i'm telling you we go through trials and
[25:05] things all the time with
[25:06] with our family or this or that or maybe
[25:08] somebody calls but you know what we need
[25:10] to get a prayer
[25:11] i said we need to get prayer back in the
[25:13] homes we need to have more prayer in the
[25:15] homes and
[25:16] and touch god this morning i think god
[25:18] wants to hear from us
[25:20] but sometimes we don't want to hear from
[25:21] him we want to hear from others or
[25:24] someone that's got a call we call a
[25:26] friend or we say hey
[25:27] what do you got to say about this hey
[25:29] god wants you to call him up
[25:31] and say hey what do you got to say to me
[25:33] this morning
[25:34] what are you speaking to me if it's a
[25:36] relationship or
[25:37] a family matter god wants to hear from
[25:39] you
[25:41] you know we want to call somebody say
[25:42] hey hey listen to this what do you think
[25:44] i'm
[25:45] i'm a bad about it i'll call this or
[25:47] call i'll keep calling until i get the
[25:49] answer that i need
[25:51] but sometimes i just say lord forgive me
[25:53] i need to pray to you because you have
[25:55] the answer
[25:56] you have the answer god has our answers
[25:58] if we just yield to him this morning
[26:00] and trust him and say god i need you
[26:02] this morning
[26:04] i'll tell you it takes faith but i like
[26:06] what he said he said the masterposing
[26:08] in verse 24 and they came to him and he
[26:10] walked him and said master master
[26:12] we perish and then he rose and rebuked
[26:15] the wind and rage in the water and they
[26:17] ceased and they they were calm and he
[26:20] said where is thy faith
[26:22] i believe that's what's happening today
[26:24] that we're kind of like going back like
[26:25] the disciples were
[26:26] we're in this boat and we're all trying
[26:28] to get out of here and we're like the
[26:30] storms start to raging
[26:32] and family problems start to come and
[26:33] the virus comes to the land
[26:35] and you say hey where's our faith
[26:37] where's our faith
[26:39] are we trusting in god this morning are
[26:41] we are we calling on god on the scene
[26:43] this morning saying god
[26:44] oh get me out of here i believe if we
[26:46] could all just join together as a bride
[26:48] this morning and say god
[26:49] i'll tell you why lord please come get
[26:51] us come quickly lord
[26:53] i believe he's waiting for a bride to
[26:55] just keep calling his name
[26:57] calling his name i believe god i believe
[26:59] that god is close to the mercy seats
[27:00] about over
[27:02] he's calling people in i've never seen
[27:04] so many people being baptized and
[27:05] families being brought in
[27:07] and people being saved right here at the
[27:09] end time because he said he'd leave this
[27:11] 99 to go after one this morning
[27:13] hold on church i'll tell you god cares
[27:16] this morning
[27:17] if do you care this morning turn to
[27:20] hebrews chapter 11 this morning
[27:22] everybody's pretty familiar with this he
[27:24] says now faith is the substance of
[27:26] things hoped for
[27:27] the evidence of things not seen
[27:30] for if it by the elders obtained a good
[27:33] report through faith we understand that
[27:35] the worlds
[27:36] were framed by the word of god aren't
[27:38] you thankful for that this morning
[27:40] that everything was framed by the word
[27:43] of god
[27:44] so that things which were seen were not
[27:46] made things which they do appear
[27:49] and it goes through and i'm not gonna
[27:50] have time to go through it all this
[27:51] morning but enoch
[27:52] he said by faith enoch was translated he
[27:55] could he should
[27:56] not see death and was not found because
[27:59] god had translated him and that
[28:01] wonderful
[28:02] verse 6 but without faith it is
[28:04] impossible to please him
[28:06] for he that cometh to god must believe
[28:09] that he is
[28:10] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[28:12] diligently seek him
[28:14] church i think we need to make a note
[28:16] tonight or this morning and say
[28:18] uh it's not just by faith but are you
[28:20] diligently seeking the lord
[28:23] are you searching for a stronger walk in
[28:25] the lord
[28:26] are you searching for something just
[28:28] greater than i just want to be
[28:29] complacent or
[28:30] just be stagnant or do i just i've been
[28:33] in the message for 20 or 30 years or 40
[28:35] years and i carry a book and i said
[28:37] quote
[28:37] it's more than that church it's more
[28:40] it's a it's a deep walk
[28:42] it's a deep call it's a it's a high
[28:44] calling church
[28:45] i tell you church is a high calling to
[28:47] be children the sons and daughters of
[28:49] the king
[28:50] broadband said one place and i really
[28:52] like it i paraphrased it this morning
[28:54] but he said that sinner or he said he
[28:56] was comparing the angels compared to the
[28:58] sinner
[28:59] and he said which one was higher which
[29:00] was lord he said the sinner's higher
[29:02] than even angels
[29:04] he said because they were already us as
[29:06] we are saved by grace
[29:07] he said the children and he basically
[29:09] said the children of god this morning
[29:12] are higher than the angels this morning
[29:14] the children said the children are going
[29:17] higher than the angels this morning oh
[29:19] they should put a smile on your face
[29:21] that should make you wake up and say
[29:24] greater is he that send me the he that's
[29:26] in the world
[29:26] holy make it when you go to work it
[29:28] should make you put a song in your
[29:30] hearts
[29:31] that should make you say you know what
[29:33] i'm going through a battle but god's in
[29:34] this battle
[29:36] i'll tell you like joshua and all them
[29:38] throughout the battle and
[29:39] they're in the battle and they stop the
[29:40] sun and whatever you have need of this
[29:42] morning hey he's he seemed it yesterday
[29:44] today and forever
[29:45] no matter what you have need of he can
[29:46] do it two thousand years ago whatever it
[29:48] is
[29:49] he he's same yesterday today and forever
[29:51] oh church i'm telling you
[29:53] when you realize that god is on the
[29:54] scene when you when you apply your faith
[29:56] this morning
[29:57] oh sometimes we get stagnated in our
[29:59] faith but i'm here to wake you up this
[30:01] morning and tell you
[30:02] that god is real and this message of the
[30:05] hour has come to wake up the bride and
[30:07] say
[30:08] hey bride we're closing you this morning
[30:10] brother brown preached the message is
[30:11] the second handed robe
[30:13] and i think what he's doing he said i'll
[30:14] put the robe on her
[30:16] i'm putting a robe on the bride this
[30:18] morning and sometimes we want to try to
[30:19] fit in it but we're going to let god put
[30:21] the robe on this morning
[30:23] we gotta let god put the code on this
[30:25] morning you know when you go get
[30:26] signs for a coat they size you up but i
[30:29] tell you god is sizing us up this
[30:31] morning
[30:32] he's got a virus in the land but he's
[30:33] sizing this up this morning
[30:35] saying is he truly who he says he is
[30:38] is he true is his sister truly who she
[30:40] says he is
[30:42] church is the greatest vital but but you
[30:44] know you think about
[30:45] joshua and all them they got we got to
[30:47] possess the land
[30:48] he said it's not you know he didn't say
[30:50] it was a picnic but said it was a battle
[30:53] he said it was a daily battle we gotta
[30:55] fight he said we gotta fight for every
[30:57] inch of ground this morning
[30:59] church we're fighting this morning and
[31:01] we're fighting for every inch and
[31:03] it might not be easy but that church is
[31:05] almost over
[31:07] it's almost over i tell you i see the
[31:09] light shining i see it coming down
[31:11] i every morning i get up i say one day
[31:13] closer to you lord
[31:15] oh if i don't wake up i cross over if i
[31:18] lose everything i still
[31:19] i gain i gain the word of god i gain
[31:22] heaven
[31:23] i tell your church when we realize who
[31:25] our father is
[31:27] we know who our daddy is this morning
[31:29] we're not just talking about him said he
[31:31] would get
[31:32] his son he would get him up in their lap
[31:33] and he would put him in their lap and
[31:35] brother
[31:36] said he would say they would sit up in
[31:37] their lap and he would say daddy show me
[31:39] your muscles
[31:41] my brother said show me your muscle he
[31:42] said it made me feel good
[31:44] he said made me feel good he said think
[31:46] about what the father says when you say
[31:48] show me your muscles
[31:49] think about what the father says when
[31:51] you say god i need you
[31:53] i know i'm he'll bury her this morning i
[31:55] hit the red sea this morning
[31:57] and he makes the red sea he makes the
[31:58] sea stand at attention this morning
[32:01] oh church we realize who our father is
[32:03] we're sons and daughters of a king this
[32:05] morning
[32:06] oh church we were both with a price paid
[32:08] on calvary
[32:10] hold church when you realize that make
[32:12] you shout it'll make you
[32:14] sing this morning it'll make you walk
[32:16] different make you talk different this
[32:17] morning
[32:18] oh church when i look out there i said
[32:20] god i see what you did for me on calvary
[32:23] oh church i'm telling the church it
[32:25] excites me i know
[32:26] i'm not upset this morning i'm excited
[32:29] this morning
[32:30] because god think about it he went down
[32:32] gotham and got on this cross
[32:34] for you and me this morning but you know
[32:36] what when they when they started to
[32:37] black out these they get called
[32:39] 10 the legions of angels all their
[32:41] angels could have came
[32:42] but he saw i believe i believe when he
[32:44] was on that cross he saw
[32:45] millions of miles away and he saw every
[32:48] one of us this morning
[32:49] and he saw a bride this morning that
[32:51] said hey they're going to live for me
[32:54] no matter if they go through a virus or
[32:56] they go through this or they go through
[32:57] that doesn't matter what they go through
[32:59] you know what he's gonna trust me he's
[33:01] gonna walk with me
[33:03] but i'll tell you church where is your
[33:04] faith this morning we gotta raise up
[33:07] hey wait we got a little but remember in
[33:09] one place he said
[33:10] the bride is living below her means
[33:12] she's not asking god what she needs
[33:14] she's telling others what she needs or
[33:16] do i tell my wife this or i come home
[33:18] and say hey this is this
[33:20] but sometimes i say look let's just pray
[33:22] let's just go to the author he knows the
[33:24] answer
[33:25] i don't have the answer i sometimes feel
[33:27] like i had the answer
[33:28] or you know as a husband you always want
[33:30] to fix something or do this or
[33:32] she's like hey just listen to me just
[33:34] just sit down and listen i just want to
[33:35] talk you don't have to fix nothing
[33:37] i think we treat god that way sometimes
[33:40] you know hey
[33:41] let me tell you what i want to tell you
[33:42] no let god tell you what he wants to
[33:44] tell you
[33:45] let him show you your path of life like
[33:48] the word says
[33:49] the path of life i believe he's showing
[33:51] us a path to life and it's the greatest
[33:53] path i could ever live in
[33:54] it's the greatest path i could ever walk
[33:56] in it's the greatest path
[33:58] we could ever see is there is you know
[34:00] like abraham and sarah
[34:02] think about it 65 and 75 he he had faith
[34:05] in god
[34:07] 25 years he kept waiting in the promise
[34:09] imagine how many people looked at him
[34:11] and said
[34:11] you're crazy you've lost your mind oh
[34:14] church it ain't just us it's throughout
[34:16] the whole bible
[34:17] david the goliath think about it
[34:19] brothers they have 14 inches fingers
[34:22] i mean imagine having that big of a hand
[34:23] and fingers and here comes david
[34:26] and here comes paul here comes saul at
[34:27] the time and saul says well i'll just
[34:29] i'll put this on you and it's like
[34:31] brother
[34:32] said he was an old ruddy old fella and
[34:34] he said he put these ar he put his own
[34:37] armor on him he said it was just about
[34:39] to fall off of him
[34:41] but he had faith in god he said i don't
[34:45] care he said i saw what god can do
[34:48] i saw what god can do for me i saw god
[34:50] heal cancer
[34:51] i saw god heal the blinded eyes i tell
[34:54] you god
[34:55] he is still the same yesterday today in
[34:57] favor i'm not just telling you i'm
[34:58] talking about experience this morning
[35:00] i've been in revivals where people's
[35:01] been healed of cancer whatever it is
[35:04] because god is greater than what we can
[35:06] think of
[35:07] i'll tell you when you start thinking
[35:08] with your eyes you don't think you
[35:10] people don't think you in this world you
[35:12] don't think you think logical
[35:14] because of this world you're you're
[35:15] going from the inside
[35:17] what i've said there's the body the
[35:19] spirit and the soul
[35:21] and our church we got to get past the
[35:23] body you know where you feel
[35:24] taste here and in the spirit conscience
[35:26] memory affection reason imagination
[35:29] we got to get into the soul this morning
[35:31] but he said in that soul there's two
[35:32] things
[35:33] there's faith in doubt but church
[35:36] i get past that this morning not just a
[35:39] feeling i got god
[35:40] or oh i just said oh i prayed to god and
[35:43] said god forgive me of my sins but
[35:44] truly meant business with god and said
[35:47] god i'm turning from my ways
[35:49] god i need you to help me but go out
[35:51] late at these altar this morning and i
[35:53] said god
[35:53] you give me faith to never turn back to
[35:55] that again
[35:57] we gotta have an upper room experience
[35:58] this morning more than just
[36:00] a little just a little experience or oh
[36:03] i believe god but the bride of christ
[36:05] i'll tell you what we should be we
[36:06] should be robert said we should be the
[36:08] happiest people
[36:09] brother said we should be the happiest
[36:11] people walk around here and say hey
[36:13] how's your day all well
[36:15] well you know what hey we all have a bad
[36:17] day we all have this and all have trials
[36:19] and
[36:20] tribulations but i tell you what i try
[36:22] my best to come home rachel said how you
[36:24] dance it was great
[36:25] it was good because i could take that
[36:28] negativity and just start going down
[36:30] that road
[36:31] and before long the whole house is
[36:33] depressed
[36:34] the kids are depressed the kids come
[36:36] today and say hey dad are you
[36:38] oh well you know the day will do and
[36:40] then they want to go away they want to
[36:41] run out
[36:42] they weren't in the bedroom and shut the
[36:43] door i'll tell you church just be
[36:45] positive
[36:47] barbara said be positive i'll tell you
[36:49] church try it one time
[36:51] i'll tell you what just go in there and
[36:52] going there you'd be the worst day
[36:54] ever
[36:54] just start talking positive thoughts
[36:56] start claiming that hey
[36:58] he said when you're sick he said to walk
[37:00] into it
[37:01] he said to claim it this morning he said
[37:03] when you're sick you start
[37:04] you so your body obeys your confession
[37:06] this morning
[37:07] i'll tell you i start i start going well
[37:09] i'll sing a song or rachel get on the
[37:11] piano and
[37:12] play a song or i'll be down and out
[37:14] she'll play and she'll be just singing
[37:15] away
[37:16] i get caught up in the atmosphere and i
[37:18] start to realize oh my goodness
[37:20] jesus is in the house i started to
[37:23] realize that
[37:24] that that that doesn't matter any more
[37:27] it might look like a big situation this
[37:29] morning whatever you come in this church
[37:31] with this morning
[37:32] it might look big you know but caleb got
[37:34] his mountain
[37:35] i don't care how big it looks but if you
[37:37] can trust god this morning
[37:38] and have faith in god god will sell you
[37:40] through
[37:41] god will see you through this morning
[37:46] oh but faith the definition of faith
[37:48] complete
[37:49] trust or confidence in something someone
[37:52] or something
[37:53] complete trust i believe we're gonna
[37:56] have complete trust in god this morning
[37:58] not just a little bit of trust but
[38:00] complete trust in our father this
[38:02] morning
[38:02] we're to have trust in god that that if
[38:05] he's all or all
[38:06] then we go to our father this morning
[38:08] say god i need you in this situation
[38:11] but a substance it says that now the
[38:13] faith is the substance of things hoped
[38:15] for but the evidence of things not seen
[38:17] it says substance what's this definition
[38:20] a particular kind of matter
[38:22] it says a intoxicating stimulating
[38:25] drug especially he said a real
[38:28] physical matter on which a person or
[38:31] things consist
[38:33] that has tangible solid presence
[38:36] oh church if we could just get
[38:38] intoxicated in jesus this morning
[38:40] oh if we could just get a substance in
[38:42] you this morning and get intoxicated in
[38:45] jesus this morning it'll change your
[38:46] life
[38:47] oh it'll change your family's life it'll
[38:49] change your kids it'll make you talk
[38:51] different walk different
[38:52] act different i'll tell you what i tell
[38:55] you get around
[38:56] a bunch of believers or go to somewhere
[38:58] or go to a fellowship they call you and
[38:59] they go
[39:00] you know there were some true good i
[39:01] mean i tell you there's something about
[39:02] them people
[39:03] you don't have to say say a whole lot
[39:05] about them there's something about them
[39:06] because the bride of christ
[39:09] they're sons and daughters of the king
[39:13] i mean church i'm not just telling you
[39:15] this more if you haven't met jesus this
[39:16] morning i invite you to
[39:18] to dedicate your life or ask god forgive
[39:20] you and turn from it if you haven't been
[39:22] baptized
[39:23] brother i know brother byler would would
[39:25] turn on the water right now
[39:27] but i tell you what i tell you what when
[39:29] one sinner repents all heaven rejoices
[39:32] i tell you why i rejoice because i'm not
[39:35] here in the battlefield
[39:36] so i told rachel i'm not in it for the
[39:37] money i'm here for one more soul
[39:39] he said one world is one soul's worth 10
[39:42] million worlds
[39:43] my bank account is looking up into
[39:44] heaven now and what we got on earth
[39:47] because as you see the economy's failing
[39:49] everything's failing i believe they're
[39:51] just
[39:51] they're just i think they're just trying
[39:52] to blind their eyes with how bad it
[39:54] really is
[39:56] how bad the economy really is but church
[39:58] i'm not here to fill you with fear this
[40:00] morning i'm here to fill you with the

[42:47] available body of facts of information
[42:49] indicating whether
[42:50] a belief or proposition is true or valid
[42:55] church does god does jesus have enough
[42:57] evidence on us this morning that we can
[42:59] find guilty in jesus this morning
[43:01] does he have enough evidence in us this
[43:03] morning to say are we convicted
[43:06] that we're under jesus christ this
[43:07] morning would he say
[43:09] hey i have enough evidence on that day
[43:11] when we get in front of jesus christ
[43:13] does he have enough evidence to say hey
[43:14] he's on my side
[43:17] that's kind of like had he right she
[43:19] didn't see she saw god and she
[43:21] she saw beyond brother branham and she's
[43:24] sitting there and it blew my mind when i
[43:25] first came
[43:26] the message and heard hey wright's story
[43:28] and my and
[43:29] it got to actually my brother my
[43:30] father-in-law talked to haley wright and
[43:33] all them
[43:33] and it just was it just really really
[43:36] god
[43:37] just off what she said i mean she just
[43:40] said that she just looked at him and
[43:41] they were they were talking hey wright
[43:43] was sitting there and
[43:44] she just sitting there and just off what
[43:45] she said she said that's nothing but the
[43:47] truth
[43:48] he said you can have anything you want
[43:49] you have money
[43:51] i want the salvation of my voice you
[43:54] know i don't care someone said we're

[43:56] don't care where they're at
[43:57] there's the salvation is done she got
[44:00] what she needed of i don't care what
[44:02] it's a picture of the day
[44:03] you might look at something that looks
[44:04] different to you but god sees it all
[44:07] different
[44:07] it's all the clouds we might say oh well
[44:10] you know the devil always wants to say
[44:11] well look at this and
[44:12] oh look at her boys now but you know
[44:14] what they're saved this morning
[44:16] because it was just her uh she obeyed
[44:19] the word she
[44:20] she agreed with the word you know i'll
[44:22] tell you church we can realize how much
[44:24] just agreeing with the word of god this
[44:25] morning will do for us
[44:27] i'll tell you it'll save you he said the
[44:29] worlds were formed by the word of god
[44:31] everything we have needed brother said
[44:33] the stars are in place every time we
[44:34] look out
[44:35] the stars are in place the general is in
[44:38] place
[44:39] he said one place he said he's put the
[44:41] five stars on his ride this morning
[44:43] he said he said j-e-s-u-s
[44:47] f-a-i-t-h he gave us the five stars this
[44:50] morning
[44:51] but the great commander-in-chief this
[44:52] morning i was in the military for 12
[44:54] years
[44:54] i was serving in the army went here went
[44:56] there went all over
[44:58] but i tell you this is the greatest
[44:59] military the greatest army i could ever
[45:01] serve in
[45:03] was when i came and saw this lights when
[45:05] i saw this wonderful light
[45:07] i tell you the rest of the family went
[45:08] one way i went one way
[45:10] i tell you i've been happy and crazy
[45:11] ever since i said dad just leave me
[45:14] alone i love it
[45:16] i said because the more i read this word
[45:17] of god and the more i listen to my tapes
[45:20] the more i realize how much i need them
[45:22] and i realize
[45:23] i realize that i'm just faulty i'm just
[45:25] a place of clay i told someone today i'm
[45:27] just
[45:27] i'm just a piece of clay trying to be
[45:29] formed and shaped
[45:30] in god's image and i'm doing my best
[45:32] that that i could get in the word every
[45:34] day and
[45:35] pray every day and raise up my faith but
[45:37] the word of god says
[45:39] you know it says it says if the to raise
[45:41] your faith is by hearing the word of god
[45:44] it takes hearing the word of god so when
[45:47] i see faith falling in this day
[45:49] there's the only i just go back to the
[45:51] word that we're not in the bible enough
[45:53] we're not listening to the brother by or
[45:56] the minister enough or we're not
[45:58] listening to the word of god that's
[45:59] coming forth enough
[46:00] that we're not we're not listening to
[46:02] what god has to say to us this morning
[46:05] i tell you says it comes by faith it
[46:06] comes by hearing the word of god
[46:08] i believe that with all my heart this
[46:10] morning that that it's by faith that
[46:12] we're gonna make it
[46:14] but in hebrews 12 verse 2 it says
[46:17] looking unto jesus the author and
[46:19] finisher of our faith
[46:21] who for the joy that was set before him
[46:24] endured the cross
[46:25] despised in the shame and is set down at
[46:28] the right hand of the throne of god
[46:31] aren't you thankful this morning that
[46:33] god is sitting at the right hand of god
[46:35] he's sitting there far above the moon's
[46:38] the star
[46:38] he's far above it all and he's on the
[46:40] right hand of the father
[46:42] making an intercession for our
[46:43] confession this morning
[46:45] old church we can realize when we walk
[46:47] we walk in the church or we start to
[46:49] pray who we're speaking to this morning
[46:51] we're just not speaking to somebody this
[46:53] morning we're speaking to the author
[46:55] this morning
[46:56] oh that formed the worlds framed the
[46:58] word of god this morning
[47:00] we're not just speaking to our health or
[47:02] i mean you think about it
[47:03] you're kidding it hits me more every day
[47:05] and i used to get joe and say well i
[47:06] want this
[47:07] and you know what broadband said when
[47:09] you ask god for something
[47:11] he looks at the motive and objective
[47:14] brother
[47:14] said god looks at your motive and
[47:16] objective don't you do the same thing
[47:18] when your child comes to you
[47:20] he says well i need this or i need this
[47:22] i'll say well you know maybe this
[47:23] oh an ipad nah well we started to
[47:26] realize they started to pray
[47:27] what can that lead their minds to or
[47:30] what could that bring them down to
[47:32] where that could mean they already get
[47:33] enough in their little we do a little
[47:35] homeschool group
[47:36] back at home and i don't know there's
[47:38] probably what 50 kids in it
[47:40] and it was always from kindergarten all
[47:42] the way to fifth and every year they had
[47:43] a great trade and we got a building
[47:45] it's nothing all message kids all of
[47:48] them but they're all from all different
[47:49] walks of life kids will come home and
[47:51] tell me this or say a joke and
[47:53] well that ain't right they shouldn't
[47:55] well i know they gotta
[47:56] rub you gotta rub shoulders with the
[47:58] world but they're in these schools and
[48:00] we're in this little what we call
[48:02] message school but
[48:04] they all come from all different walks
[48:06] of life you know the parents might need
[48:07] to read the bible with them they might
[48:09] not
[48:09] even they say they're in the message but
[48:12] not even reading the bible with the kids
[48:14] not even they're they're saying jokes
[48:16] they shouldn't say to him then he gets
[48:18] there and i said all right
[48:19] he can't do that no you shouldn't say
[48:21] and but but god's doing that with his
[48:23] children this morning
[48:24] he we're reading the word and he's
[48:26] taking one thing off of us
[48:28] every day saying hey this is this
[48:31] shouldn't be here
[48:31] or this shouldn't be here or that
[48:33] shouldn't be here he's every day he's
[48:35] taking things away from me
[48:37] and i'm so thankful that he's he's
[48:39] cleaning us up
[48:40] and he's about to present us to the
[48:42] bride you think about the bride she goes
[48:45] away and
[48:45] she prepares months for a wedding that
[48:47] brother chase shop talks about to get
[48:49] married and
[48:50] back at home and repairing months and
[48:53] months for a wedding but i tell you
[48:54] church i'm preparing every day for that
[48:56] true wedding supper
[48:58] that's in the air i'll let you but i'm
[49:00] excited this morning
[49:01] i'm excited i'm looking like abraham
[49:04] saul and john saw that city coming down
[49:06] i got faith this morning it's about to
[49:08] happen it's not just something i'm just
[49:10] sitting here trying to tell you this
[49:11] morning
[49:12] i'll tell you i went back and forth back
[49:13] and forth and what to say and what to
[49:15] preach on and god said hey speak on
[49:17] faith
[49:18] we need more faith this morning not just
[49:21] a a waiver in faith but
[49:22] but a faith that has a root a foundation
[49:25] this morning
[49:28] one that has one that has a foundation
[49:30] and i was looking at joshua
[49:31] joshua this morning verse one chapter
[49:34] one and it said now after the
[49:36] after the death of moses the servant of
[49:38] the lord came to pass and the lord
[49:40] spoken to joshua the son of nun
[49:42] moses minister saying moses my servant
[49:45] is dead
[49:46] now therefore rise go after the jordan
[49:48] now and all the
[49:49] all this people unto the land and i'll
[49:52] give
[49:52] he said i do give to them even to the
[49:54] children of israel
[49:56] every place that your soul of your feet
[49:58] shall tread upon
[49:59] that have i've given them to as i said
[50:02] unto moses
[50:03] from the wilderness and from lebanon
[50:05] he's and he keeps going and just to skip
[50:07] down for time for a spot
[50:08] there shall not any man be able to stand
[50:11] before
[50:12] thee in all the days of thy life as i
[50:14] was with moses i will be with thee
[50:16] i will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[50:19] aren't you thankful for this morning
[50:21] that we can say god
[50:23] that you said you'll never leave us or
[50:25] forsake us this morning
[50:26] oh don't you make you excited that this
[50:29] morning that he said wherever your souls
[50:31] of your
[50:31] your feet should try i'll be there with
[50:33] you
[50:34] oh church i just believe it this morning
[50:37] if you're a children of god this morning
[50:39] if you had to get to the well this
[50:40] morning
[50:41] oh if you just came back to christ i'm
[50:43] telling you to get into the fountain of
[50:45] living water that will fill you
[50:47] not by me but something that will that
[50:49] will be everlasting that will change
[50:51] your life
[50:52] that'll keep cleansing you it's a
[50:53] process church it don't take
[50:55] one day it takes several days and days
[50:57] and months and years
[50:59] it's a it's a daily cleansing it's like
[51:01] david said that mercy is new every
[51:03] morning
[51:04] i believe that church we got we gotta
[51:06] believe in trusting god more we gotta
[51:08] have faith in god more
[51:11] but verse six he said listen to this he
[51:13] said be strong and of good courage
[51:16] for unto the people shalt thou divine
[51:18] for inheritance the land
[51:20] which i swear to their fathers to give
[51:22] them
[51:23] only be thou strong and very courageous
[51:26] that thou mayest observe to do according
[51:30] to all the law which moses my servant
[51:32] commanded thee
[51:34] i tell you church we need to be strong
[51:35] and courageous
[51:37] verse 9 had not i commanded thee be
[51:40] strong
[51:41] of good courage be not afraid
[51:45] neither nor be thou dismayed for the
[51:48] lord
[51:48] god is with with either whatsoever
[51:51] thou goest church i believe that this
[51:55] morning

[51:59] he sees everything
[52:00] he sees everything he's telling josh hey
[52:03] look you're moses
[52:04] moses is gone but wherever your feet

[55:22] and stop going against the current we
[55:23] want to

[59:25] up for yourself and realize that
[59:27] that ain't nothing but the truth this
[59:29] morning
[59:30] but i tell you they talk it takes a
[59:32] little relationship with god
[59:34] more than just saying i'm gonna hide
[59:36] behind a message
[59:38] i'm behind behind a messenger it's more
[59:41] than that
[59:43] it's picking our faith up this morning
[59:44] and saying god
[59:46] i want to read every word of god and i
[59:48] want to be clothed with your words
[59:50] i want to be clothed with your word my
[59:52] family needs it everything else will
[59:54] burn up but your word will not
[59:57] and more than just saying i believe it
[59:59] or i could say a quote but
[1:00:00] truly truly come in one with the word of
[1:00:03] god
[1:00:04] it's becoming one with the word of god
[1:00:06] this morning
[1:00:08] i'll tell you brother i'm saying this
[1:00:10] message time tested faith
[1:00:12] he said but it's so simple to have faith
[1:00:15] he said for instance you cannot move
[1:00:17] out of your seat if you were able to
[1:00:19] come in and sit down
[1:00:21] you cannot move from your seat unless
[1:00:23] you have faith
[1:00:24] that you'll do it he said you can put
[1:00:28] your hat on again unless you have faith
[1:00:30] you can do it
[1:00:31] he said never can you draw another
[1:00:34] breath
[1:00:34] unless you have faith you can do it
[1:00:37] faith is so common
[1:00:39] that when you look at it for something a
[1:00:41] little unusual we go
[1:00:43] way over the top for it trying to find
[1:00:46] it's what's right next to us
[1:00:50] he says old testament when the blood was
[1:00:52] applied over the lentils of the door
[1:00:54] i told him they put his my hyssop dipped
[1:00:57] in the blood and rubbed over the door
[1:00:59] hips
[1:00:59] it's just a common weed he says then how
[1:01:02] appropriate that
[1:01:03] is tonight to apply hyssop as
[1:01:06] faith he said put the blood of
[1:01:09] blood on by faith he said how
[1:01:13] we've covered by the blood by faith
[1:01:15] common faith
[1:01:16] he said well you say but for miracles
[1:01:18] and for healing brother brahm is some
[1:01:20] different type of faith
[1:01:21] no it's the same faith he said there's
[1:01:24] only one
[1:01:24] faith in all things he says all things
[1:01:27] and all things
[1:01:28] are the original it's fake church
[1:01:32] you don't believe how much faith you
[1:01:33] gotta have you get out in your car and
[1:01:35] you crank it up
[1:01:36] you have faith that it's going to crank
[1:01:38] up this morning yeah i had faith that
[1:01:40] when i get up this morning that we're
[1:01:42] going to drive
[1:01:42] whatever two hours and a half that we're
[1:01:45] gonna have faith
[1:01:46] even though we know what time to get up
[1:01:48] that we had faith in the car
[1:01:50] to crank this morning i had faith that i
[1:01:53] told my brother hey i'll be there
[1:01:55] but that was faith this morning that was
[1:01:58] but
[1:01:58] but when we realized that we we serve a
[1:02:00] god that's greater and i serve a god
[1:02:02] that
[1:02:03] i put my faith and trust in this morning
[1:02:05] not in my wife
[1:02:06] not in my kids but in a god that i trust
[1:02:09] that god will look down and when i push
[1:02:11] the button it cranks
[1:02:13] it's my faith that everything we do we
[1:02:15] eat we breathe
[1:02:16] everything we do is by faith but you get
[1:02:19] the airplane
[1:02:20] whatever it is whatever you do you know
[1:02:22] we don't we don't sometimes we don't we
[1:02:23] don't i don't we don't have to

[1:02:34] minutes we don't know
[1:02:35] oh well it's been on for a year it'd be
[1:02:37] fine
[1:02:38] but you know what that's sometimes with
[1:02:39] our lives in christ the engine lights on
[1:02:43] sometimes the engine lights on i believe
[1:02:45] some of the engine lights are on
[1:02:47] we got this virus going around town and
[1:02:48] the engine light's on in our life and
[1:02:50] we're all around oh my gosh what are we
[1:02:51] going to do
[1:02:52] no you need to have a checkup with jesus
[1:02:54] and let him cut the engine light off
[1:02:55] this morning
[1:02:56] and tell you look greater is he that's
[1:02:58] in me that he is in the world
[1:02:59] and you said the world's reformed by the
[1:03:01] word of god i'm in the word of god
[1:03:03] i trust you if if something happens to
[1:03:05] my body well then i'm just going to be
[1:03:07] with the lord
[1:03:09] i tell you church we gotta raise up our
[1:03:11] faith this morning
[1:03:13] and trust god that that he's our all in
[1:03:15] all

[1:03:19] house
[1:03:19] shelter over us he gives us a job he
[1:03:22] puts food on our table

[1:03:34] money to bring home the food
[1:03:35] whatever it is that's faith i tell you
[1:03:38] every brother abraham said in this
[1:03:39] message
[1:03:39] he said everything we do is based on
[1:03:42] faith
[1:03:43] the way we breathe the way we act well
[1:03:44] whatever we do we have to have faith to
[1:03:46] do it
[1:03:48] i believe church we're we our world's
[1:03:51] starving for that he talked about the 25
[1:03:54] cent i really like that
[1:03:55] he said he could have the 25 cent he
[1:03:56] could have the purchasing power to buy
[1:03:58] that
[1:03:58] loaf of bread but hey he was just as
[1:04:02] content with the 25 cent in his pocket
[1:04:05] because he knew he had the purchasing
[1:04:06] power church if
[1:04:08] we would believe today that there's
[1:04:10] purchasing power in the blood of christ
[1:04:11] this morning
[1:04:12] let's purchase a price for your sin this
[1:04:15] morning

[1:09:14] i'm going to make it no matter what i'm
[1:09:16] going to see my family through
[1:09:18] and so we got scriptures all over the
[1:09:20] place all over our doors and
[1:09:22] you know for me and my house we're going
[1:09:23] to serve the lord
[1:09:25] i tell you we're going to serve the lord
[1:09:26] i don't no matter what we go through
[1:09:28] like we'll have family battles or
[1:09:30] whatever battles you're going through
[1:09:31] but you and your family keep pressing on
[1:09:34] oh keep pressing on i'm telling you
[1:09:35] it is tough out there but i tell you we
[1:09:37] serve a god that's
[1:09:38] greater than that anything we have
[1:09:42] we serve god that's greater than any
[1:09:44] that's above the stars the moons that's
[1:09:46] like i said in hebrews 11 he hung the
[1:09:48] world
[1:09:49] like romans 8 well i mean romans 10
[1:09:52] verse 17
[1:09:53] so then faith cometh by hearing and
[1:09:55] hearing by the word of god
[1:09:57] that's what we're doing here this
[1:09:58] morning we're
[1:10:00] the only people want to know have an
[1:10:02] answer but i'm saying there's always a
[1:10:04] bible answer if you open it up and just
[1:10:05] go find it
[1:10:07] where faith comes it comes by the
[1:10:09] hearing of the word of god
[1:10:11] so when your face starts to get a little
[1:10:12] weak listen to the word of god
[1:10:16] read the word of god listen to the
[1:10:17] prophet
[1:10:19] let it dubs held together and it will
[1:10:22] raise your faith
[1:10:24] you think you got weak faith given the
[1:10:25] word more that's what the word of god
[1:10:27] says
[1:10:29] ephesians well here i'm about close here
[1:10:32] shortly
[1:10:32] ephesians chapter two we'll skip down to
[1:10:35] verse
[1:10:36] four but god who is rich in mercy
[1:10:39] great love wherein he loved us even when
[1:10:42] we were dead and sins had quickened us
[1:10:45] together with christ
[1:10:46] by grace ye are saved and hath raised us
[1:10:50] up together and made us sit in heavenly
[1:10:52] places in christ jesus
[1:10:55] all that should excite you this morning
[1:10:57] that in the ages that come
[1:10:59] he might show the exceeding riches of
[1:11:01] his of his grace and his kindness
[1:11:03] towards us through christ jesus for by
[1:11:07] grace ye are saved through faith
[1:11:12] through faith and not of yourselves
[1:11:16] it is the gift of god church ain't
[1:11:19] nothing you could do
[1:11:20] there ain't nothing what you can work up
[1:11:21] there ain't no emotions you can work out
[1:11:23] to be saved it's a gift to god this
[1:11:26] morning
[1:11:27] it's like me handing the gift to a
[1:11:28] neighbor it's like me doing this
[1:11:30] the other day we do this or give this to
[1:11:32] somebody hey i don't want that i don't
[1:11:34] care what you want i'm going to give you
[1:11:35] this god told me to give this to you
[1:11:37] it's a gift keep it
[1:11:41] god died on the cross he gave all his
[1:11:43] whole life for me and you this morning
[1:11:46] every one of us this morning he gave you
[1:11:48] breath in your body if you have health
[1:11:50] in your body
[1:11:51] whatever it is you walked in this church
[1:11:52] you should be praising god this morning
[1:11:54] had a father-in-law hadn't been off the
[1:11:56] bed in seven months
[1:11:58] finally started getting back up walking
[1:11:59] they called rachel last night at one
[1:12:01] o'clock in the morning and said man this
[1:12:02] man
[1:12:03] is strong it's an ox ain't been a bad

[1:12:07] what's that man about to tear the place
[1:12:09] down he's like get me out of this place
[1:12:12] but it was faith he he trusted a higher
[1:12:14] power than what he has
[1:12:16] it takes faith in god this morning
[1:12:20] but like i said but before about four by
[1:12:22] grace we are saved through faith
[1:12:24] not of ourselves it is a gift of god
[1:12:28] oh church i tell you it truly is the
[1:12:30] gift of god
[1:12:31] if you trust god this morning it's like
[1:12:34] that it's like lebron said that
[1:12:36] story i really like where he talks about
[1:12:37] where he goes some ass asks the slave he
[1:12:39] asked
[1:12:40] he asked him he says hey is that why is
[1:12:42] that slave act different this
[1:12:43] is what's going on do you feed them
[1:12:45] different brother said no i don't
[1:12:47] they don't feed them different we don't
[1:12:48] feed the seed you know he told the story
[1:12:50] he said i don't feed that slave any
[1:12:52] different
[1:12:52] he said i was wondering the same thing
[1:12:55] he said he started researching
[1:12:56] i'll tell you church you should make a
[1:12:57] shout right here he said i started
[1:12:59] researching i started looking up
[1:13:00] and i started realizing where oh he was
[1:13:02] a child of the king
[1:13:04] he said that's what made him different
[1:13:06] he said he started looking down through
[1:13:07] his heritage
[1:13:08] and realized his daddy was a child of
[1:13:10] the king he said he acted different he
[1:13:12] did everything different
[1:13:13] he said he acted like the boss he said
[1:13:16] but he's just a save just like everybody
[1:13:18] else
[1:13:19] church when you realize you're a child
[1:13:21] of the king this morning you realize
[1:13:23] when you have a prayer this morning it
[1:13:25] goes beyond these walls this morning
[1:13:27] it goes beyond the ceiling this morning
[1:13:29] it goes greater than your
[1:13:31] faith it goes to jesus this morning
[1:13:33] that's sitting on the right hand the
[1:13:34] father this morning saying
[1:13:36] hey have faith in me this morning you
[1:13:38] come through these doors you got
[1:13:39] depression or anxiety
[1:13:40] or family that's lost or whatever it is
[1:13:43] god's greater than that this morning
[1:13:45] i'll tell you you got to trust god this
[1:13:47] morning to have faith in him
[1:13:49] you have the purchasing power we just
[1:13:51] got to claim the purchasing power this
[1:13:53] morning
[1:13:54] and realize who our daddy is that we're
[1:13:56] just not
[1:13:57] we're just not talking to or just a hell
[1:13:59] of this imagine like a
[1:14:00] earthly daddy we're talking to a daddy
[1:14:03] that formed their world
[1:14:04] they put the stars in there in the earth
[1:14:06] we're talking to a daddy
[1:14:08] that that that paid the ultimate price
[1:14:10] for our sins this morning
[1:14:11] that brother brown said one drop of
[1:14:13] blood is like a thing of clorox and it
[1:14:15] just wipes it white as snow
[1:14:17] oh church can't you think about it i'll
[1:14:19] tell you we we think about our sins and
[1:14:21] you just put it down there one drop of
[1:14:22] blood cleanses it all
[1:14:24] oh sickness whatever it is he's paid
[1:14:27] that price this morning
[1:14:28] oh church you don't make it you know
[1:14:30] he'll put something in you this morning
[1:14:32] he'll give you zeal
[1:14:33] it'll make you happy this morning it'll
[1:14:35] put something in you
[1:14:36] that make you have a character this
[1:14:38] morning
[1:14:40] i tell you church you're gonna change
[1:14:41] your life it's changing me every day
[1:14:44] this word of god is
[1:14:45] i'll tell you every day i wake up i want
[1:14:47] to just get more of them
[1:14:48] i want to get more in the word of god
[1:14:50] because i tell you it's a sharper than
[1:14:52] any two-edged sword
[1:14:54] it's just it's cutting everything off of
[1:14:56] this world that i can have
[1:14:58] the things that i used to care about the
[1:15:00] things i used to watch
[1:15:01] i tell you what back in the world don't
[1:15:03] have it anymore don't have it
[1:15:05] don't have it tv none of that stuff grew
[1:15:08] up with it
[1:15:09] but i don't have it i'll tell you what
[1:15:11] he said blow it out with a shotgun
[1:15:13] don't have any of it because you start
[1:15:16] to realize that the world starts to
[1:15:17] become
[1:15:18] it just becomes a in the distance
[1:15:22] as you get in the word of god you start
[1:15:23] listening to these messages
[1:15:25] things of the world just start you're
[1:15:27] almost like blinded from it
[1:15:28] and then when you hear something or on
[1:15:30] your job and they'll say would you hear
[1:15:32] this i have
[1:15:33] what i don't know i said i can show you
[1:15:35] this scripture i read last night
[1:15:37] was scared let me tell you this quote i
[1:15:40] just heard
[1:15:41] i tell you brother christ is making her
[1:15:44] she's making herself ready
[1:15:46] she's clothing herself
[1:15:49] in matthew chapter 9 verse 18 while he
[1:15:53] take these things unto them behold there
[1:15:56] came a certain ruler and worshipped him
[1:15:58] saying my daughter is
[1:15:59] even now is dead but come and lay thy
[1:16:02] hand upon her and
[1:16:03] shall and she shall live jesus arose and
[1:16:06] followed him and said to the
[1:16:07] so did his disciples and behold a woman
[1:16:10] which was deceased with a blood issue 12
[1:16:13] years came behind him and touched the
[1:16:15] hem of his garment
[1:16:16] for she said unto herself if i may but
[1:16:19] touch
[1:16:20] his garment i shall be whole but jesus
[1:16:23] turned him about
[1:16:25] a and when he saw her he said daughter
[1:16:27] be of good comfort thy faith hath made
[1:16:29] thy whole
[1:16:31] and the woman was made whole from that
[1:16:32] hour
[1:16:34] by faith it took faith to say
[1:16:38] if i could only touches him if i could
[1:16:41] only just touch the hem of his garment
[1:16:42] didn't even have to ask for prayer just
[1:16:45] said if i could touch the master
[1:16:48] i think today we got to touch the master
[1:16:50] i think the bride of christ
[1:16:51] needs to raise up and touch the master
[1:16:53] this morning
[1:16:55] if you've come with a need this morning
[1:16:56] god cares god truly knows what you have
[1:16:59] need of
[1:16:59] before you even ask him he just wants
[1:17:02] you to ask him
[1:17:03] he just wants you just like picking up
[1:17:05] the phone or calling your father or
[1:17:07] whatever it is call your mother
[1:17:08] they just want you to say hey this is
[1:17:10] what's going on
[1:17:12] don't talk about it just call the call
[1:17:14] call your father up and say god
[1:17:17] you know what's going on already but god
[1:17:20] i need your help
[1:17:22] it might take one year it might take six
[1:17:24] months it could happen right on the spot
[1:17:25] it can happen 10 years down the road
[1:17:28] abraham 25 years he kept searching for
[1:17:30] that promise
[1:17:32] that promised son and then he got it
[1:17:35] because he trusted god he trusted god
[1:17:38] and it comes down to trust in our father
[1:17:40] it comes down romans 8 30 now you'll
[1:17:42] turn to this but romans 8 38 through 39
[1:17:44] it says for i'm persuaded
[1:17:46] this is truly i love this scripture
[1:17:48] because this is me for i'm persuaded
[1:17:50] that neither
[1:17:51] death nor life nor angels nor
[1:17:54] principalities
[1:17:55] nor powers nor things present or things
[1:17:58] to come virus whatever you have
[1:18:00] listen no height nor death nor any other
[1:18:03] creature
[1:18:03] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:18:05] love of god which is in christ jesus our
[1:18:07] lord
[1:18:08] nothing whatever it is bring it on
[1:18:12] because nothing will separate the love
[1:18:13] of christ
[1:18:15] nothing will once you get anchored in
[1:18:17] jesus christ nothing will separate us
[1:18:19] and if you're young and you're looking
[1:18:21] to get married or whatever it is
[1:18:22] i'll tell you make sure they have jesus
[1:18:24] in their life
[1:18:26] make sure you go through the courtship
[1:18:28] because you could one decision you have
[1:18:30] to live with that the rest of your life
[1:18:32] one decision you have to live with that
[1:18:34] person the rest of your life
[1:18:37] one decision could just put you on the
[1:18:39] wrong road one decision of us
[1:18:41] not serving god can put us there
[1:18:43] whatever decision life trying to make it
[1:18:45] with jesus
[1:18:46] no matter if it's your job or whatever
[1:18:48] to have need of

[1:18:52] need you to show me in this situation
[1:18:54] i need you to i i don't know what to do
[1:18:56] but god you know what to do

[1:29:33] bride is getting
[1:29:35] i mean the lord is getting his bride
[1:29:37] ready

[1:30:05] would really be bad
