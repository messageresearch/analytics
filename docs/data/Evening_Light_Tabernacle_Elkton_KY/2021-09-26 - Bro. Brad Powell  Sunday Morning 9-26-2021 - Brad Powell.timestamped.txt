[25:03] through thy precepts i get understanding
[25:05] therefore i hate every false way god
[25:08] bless you may be seated brother brian
[25:24] morning brothers and sisters you know
[25:26] you reading those uh
[25:29] verses right there i don't care if the
[25:31] the oldest man the youngest man same for
[25:34] the woman the smartest man or the
[25:36] dumbest man i don't mean that in a bad
[25:39] way
[25:40] you have more knowledge and more
[25:42] understanding in the world we live in
[25:44] this morning to anyone out there i don't
[25:46] care if he's got double degrees phd's
[25:49] the scripture just tells you if you've
[25:51] got the revelation
[25:53] of god's word for the hour that you live
[25:55] in
[25:56] then
[25:57] you're smarter than the rest of those
[25:59] people out there in the world that you
[26:01] know they they would call you uh
[26:03] ignorant because you hold on to a simple
[26:06] faith and a simple truth but it's the
[26:08] opposite it's completely the opposite
[26:11] you're holding on to something that has
[26:14] more weight to it than what they believe
[26:16] but if you return with me to uh
[26:19] uh galatians the sixth chapter
[26:27] before i get started i've like i talked
[26:30] to you before
[26:31] i paid all those bills that we talked
[26:33] about i didn't pay all the insurance i'm
[26:36] paid up into
[26:38] the uh
[26:39] last day in february for the next so the
[26:42] first six months is paid for
[26:44] all
[26:45] not all the fuel i only paid two
[26:47] thousand dollars for the winter fill but
[26:50] last year was about
[26:52] by the time what we had in the tanks and
[26:55] well we didn't have as much in the tank
[26:57] last fall as we started
[26:59] as we do this year we're almost 80
[27:02] so i'm thinking we'll be all right i
[27:04] might have to top it pending on the
[27:06] winner the kind of winner we get i think
[27:09] we'll be all right with the fuel cell
[27:11] that's brought the general fund down
[27:13] from that amount that i told you about
[27:15] so
[27:16] right now we're down to about
[27:19] right about five thousand dollars i have
[27:21] a deposit ready to make
[27:23] before i go on vacation so i'm gonna try
[27:26] to make that deposit on monday or
[27:28] tuesday morning so the church
[27:30] financially is still sitting pretty well
[27:33] uh the only last thing i have to do for
[27:35] the church is
[27:37] i'm i need to try to de-lime the boiler
[27:39] before we start the seasoning i don't
[27:41] know if i'm going to have that time but
[27:43] that's the last thing i have to do
[27:45] before we
[27:46] we turn the heat on but we've been
[27:48] pretty fortunate with this one i have
[27:50] had no issues
[27:52] in two years uh with it so the other
[27:55] ones before that
[27:57] every every 18 months to 12 months
[27:59] either it was a part that went out or
[28:02] we had a leak so uh
[28:04] just hoping the best and god will bless
[28:07] us there but i was uh listening to
[28:10] numerous
[28:12] messages this morning just sitting in my
[28:14] office and the thing i wrote some notes
[28:18] down
[28:18] but
[28:20] all of us sitting here this morning
[28:22] wouldn't be here this morning unless we
[28:24] believe jesus christ
[28:26] and the word of god and obviously you
[28:28] can't make someone believe you can't
[28:30] force someone to believe
[28:32] you can't explain sometimes to somebody
[28:35] why you believe but you just believe and
[28:37] that's a gift that god gives you doesn't
[28:40] mean it excuses you be ignorant of god's
[28:43] word i'm not saying that but it's a gift
[28:45] that god gives each of us
[28:47] every day that we just simply believe
[28:49] god's word and and we just stand on it
[28:52] we live on it we it's there's nothing
[28:55] else we can do but depend on it and you
[28:58] can sometimes some people you can't
[29:00] explain to them why you believe you just
[29:02] believe now
[29:04] the world we live in right now they call
[29:06] that vine ignorance you know because you
[29:08] just simply believe a simple truth but
[29:11] it's really important that we believe
[29:14] just what god tells us but i'll read
[29:17] this this morning you know and brother
[29:19] brown was in the message i was listening
[29:22] this morning
[29:23] the one thing that really struck me we
[29:26] overlooked he he always told the people
[29:29] i if if god has saved you sanctified you
[29:33] and given you the holy ghost don't be
[29:35] afraid to ask for something here in that
[29:37] match i don't know how many times he
[29:39] said that don't be afraid to ask god
[29:42] for something that you need in the hour
[29:45] of your need you know a lot of times as
[29:47] men
[29:48] you have a tendency just want to bear
[29:50] your pains and bear your burdens but
[29:52] that's not how a christian's really
[29:54] supposed to be you need to release your
[29:56] burdens to him and whatever your need is
[29:58] you don't be afraid ask god for it you
[30:01] know whatever that need is this morning
[30:03] or in your life don't be afraid to ask
[30:05] god to do something for you the more you
[30:08] ask him to do and the more that he
[30:09] proves himself to you the greater your
[30:12] experience will be and the more willing
[30:14] you'll be to want to share it with
[30:16] someone else you never ask god to do
[30:18] something for you it doesn't give you an
[30:20] opportunity to tell people what god's
[30:22] done for you so you should never be
[30:24] afraid to ask god to do something for
[30:26] you now some people that's different
[30:28] they would rather just bear their
[30:30] burdens and go to the grave just like
[30:32] that but that's not how a christian's
[30:34] supposed to be but let me read this here
[30:36] before i get off on the tangent here and
[30:39] this is what paul had to say
[30:41] brethren if a man be overtaken excuse me
[30:44] brethren if a man be overtaken in a fall
[30:47] he that are spiritual restore such as
[30:49] one in the spirit of meekness
[30:51] considering myself at least thou also be
[30:54] tempted you know that word meekness
[30:55] there sometimes we forget about that you
[30:58] like i just said you can't make someone
[31:00] believe but in meekness and in love you
[31:02] try to correct your brother or your
[31:04] neighbor when you know they're doing
[31:06] something wrong does it make you better
[31:08] than them should you have an attitude
[31:10] like you're better than them no but in
[31:12] meekness and in love you try to correct
[31:14] people
[31:15] consider myself least thou also be
[31:18] tempted and that's what paul is saying
[31:19] here when you're trying to correct
[31:21] people you be really mindful of your own
[31:24] attitude and your own place in life and
[31:27] he goes up bear ye another one another's
[31:29] burdens and so fulfill the law of christ
[31:33] for if a man think himself to be
[31:35] something when he is nothing he deceives
[31:37] himself you know i spend hours talking
[31:39] about that
[31:40] that's how most of the people on that
[31:42] you work with they forget that they're
[31:44] human too they make
[31:46] any time you deal with people a lot of
[31:48] times when they're on a tangent they
[31:50] forget that they're a human being and
[31:52] they make mistakes also too
[31:55] let everyone prove his own works and he
[31:57] shall have rejoicing himself alone not
[32:00] in another you know that goes about not
[32:02] being afraid to ask god for something
[32:05] and you're going to bear your own works
[32:07] one day and he goes every man shall bear
[32:09] his own burdens let him that is taught
[32:11] in the word communicate on to him that
[32:13] teaches in all good things
[32:15] be not deceived god is not mocked for
[32:17] whatever a man selleth that shall he
[32:19] also reap you know
[32:21] you know every man every woman every
[32:24] child you all know that you when you
[32:26] reach something you sow or excuse me i
[32:28] shouldn't have said it that way when you
[32:30] sow you reap
[32:32] it's an
[32:33] aspect of life you can't get away with
[32:35] i've done things in my flesh as a young
[32:37] man that i'm paying for today as i live
[32:40] that we all are at that point
[32:42] it goes on to say
[32:44] let him that his thought and word
[32:46] communicate on to all that teacheth good
[32:48] things be not deceived god is not mocked
[32:51] so whatsoever a man so that shall he
[32:53] also reap
[32:55] for he that soweth to his thought shall
[32:57] reap
[32:58] shall of the flesh reap corruption but
[33:00] he that soweth to the spirit shall the
[33:02] spirit reap life everlasting i'll finish
[33:06] on that eighth verse you know there's
[33:08] two types of selling you either sow good
[33:10] seed or you sow bad seed in your life
[33:13] and that's a choice we're going to make
[33:14] this morning or we've made in our whole
[33:16] life what kind of seed we plant in the
[33:18] ground
[33:19] and uh we want it to be good seed that
[33:21] it brings forth more life in our lives
[33:24] and everything that we do
[33:26] you know i was uh
[33:30] just like when i was listening to that
[33:31] message i say i'll just say it again
[33:33] that's one thing that struck me while he
[33:36] was teaching
[33:37] to the people
[33:38] that's he kept saying it time and time
[33:41] and time again don't be afraid to ask
[33:43] god for something whatever it is this
[33:45] morning
[33:46] just don't be afraid if you've done
[33:49] what god asked you to do if you've met
[33:51] those requirements that god has asked
[33:53] you to do and you've
[33:56] done all those things and don't be
[33:57] afraid to ask god to do something for
[33:59] you this morning brother david
[34:19] hey man you love him with all of your
[34:21] heart this morning

[38:38] thought yeah you are definitely crazy
[38:41] this morning and then he's talking about

[1:00:36] i just uh
[1:00:37] thankful thankful for the pre-service
[1:00:39] and the sunday school and
[1:00:42] the songs that we're saying just
[1:00:43] couldn't have lined up any better than
[1:00:46] than what i had on my mind that'd be all
[1:00:48] for the music thank you
[1:00:49] um
[1:00:51] and you know brother brian why don't you
[1:00:53] have your seat for just a minute i
[1:00:55] i kind of had a detour of thoughts here
[1:00:56] when i listened to the sunday school and
[1:00:58] then the uh the
[1:01:00] the special that was sung there and
[1:01:02] brother brian was talking about the
[1:01:04] sunday school really stuck to me there
[1:01:05] where he was talking about he'd done
[1:01:07] some things as a young man
[1:01:10] and you know i think we've all been
[1:01:11] there and uh this last week i i was
[1:01:14] asked to go preach i guess the chapel
[1:01:17] at the boys school
[1:01:19] and that's kind of what we we spoke on
[1:01:21] is scars and the life that we live as a
[1:01:25] young person this should be our greatest
[1:01:26] time in our life but yet if we're not
[1:01:28] careful
[1:01:29] the memories that we have and the things
[1:01:31] we see and hear and do as a young person
[1:01:34] creates memories of scars
[1:01:36] and and so uh i thought about that i
[1:01:38] thought man that's just really kind of
[1:01:40] fitting with with what's going on then
[1:01:42] when uh sister sister becky and brother
[1:01:44] steve there they
[1:01:46] got up there and singing about
[1:01:48] the mountain if you've got a mountain
[1:01:49] you can't climb or a river you can't
[1:01:50] cross or a valley that's too wide
[1:01:53] there's a way across it
[1:01:55] and you know that goes kind of right
[1:01:57] along with what uh what my fault was
[1:01:59] today and
[1:02:00] um
[1:02:02] sitting there and i was studying and
[1:02:04] this little
[1:02:05] little story come to me and said there
[1:02:07] was a little five-year-old boy
[1:02:09] uh that was in the kitchen
[1:02:11] and he was watching his mother make
[1:02:13] supper and
[1:02:14] she asked this little boy said i want
[1:02:15] you to go down to the cellar and i want
[1:02:17] you to get me a can of tomato soup
[1:02:20] and he said i don't want to go down
[1:02:22] there i don't i don't want to go down
[1:02:23] there alone
[1:02:24] it's dark down there i'm scared i don't
[1:02:26] want to go mama
[1:02:28] and she asked again he was still
[1:02:30] persistent i don't want to go and
[1:02:32] finally the mom looked at the little boy
[1:02:33] and she said it's okay jesus will be in
[1:02:36] there with you
[1:02:38] jesus will be in there with you and so
[1:02:40] the little boy he walked down slowly
[1:02:42] down there and he opened up into the
[1:02:43] door to go on down to the cellar and he
[1:02:45] looked down in there and he said it was
[1:02:46] dark and musky and
[1:02:48] and and he was scared and fearful and
[1:02:51] and just about then he was fixing to
[1:02:52] leave and then he got the idea and he
[1:02:54] said jesus
[1:02:56] if you're in there would you hand me a
[1:02:57] can of tomato soup
[1:03:01] now we laugh at that but i think about
[1:03:03] this when we think about this in our
[1:03:05] life so many times
[1:03:07] we're called upon to go into
[1:03:08] uncomfortable situations
[1:03:12] we're faced with situations where we
[1:03:13] have to climb the mountain
[1:03:15] and
[1:03:16] and we look at the story
[1:03:18] that little story and we kind of chuckle
[1:03:19] at it but it's just true because we go
[1:03:22] into places that we're driven into
[1:03:24] sometimes we go into places that that'll
[1:03:27] challenge us and see if we really do
[1:03:29] believe what we say we believe
[1:03:33] and this way god puts us through these
[1:03:35] tests and we have to have this mindset
[1:03:37] that no matter
[1:03:39] where life takes us
[1:03:41] and no matter what i have to do no
[1:03:44] matter what it is god i'm going through
[1:03:50] because it's easy to stop
[1:03:53] it's easy to quit
[1:03:56] it's easy to not keep pressing on
[1:03:59] so this morning i'm going to try to take
[1:04:01] my time uh i i just felt like i i were
[1:04:04] several directions i felt to go but i i
[1:04:06] just felt that i want to slow down if i
[1:04:08] could this morning and maybe teach just
[1:04:10] a little bit and that's not by my choice
[1:04:13] but that's just the way i felt to go so
[1:04:16] we'll try to slow slow it down a little
[1:04:18] bit
[1:04:19] if you would stand with me we'll read
[1:04:21] into in the book of genesis
[1:04:26] genesis 22
[1:04:31] i think a lot of times we
[1:04:33] preachers we like to preach because it's
[1:04:35] it's energetic and and you know teaching
[1:04:37] can be energetic too but a lot of times
[1:04:39] when you preach your thoughts are moving
[1:04:41] so fast
[1:04:42] and and and you're being inspired so
[1:04:44] quick that you oh you kind of pass over
[1:04:46] the little details and a lot of times in
[1:04:48] life it's the little details that'll get
[1:04:51] you through the big problems
[1:04:53] so genesis 22
[1:04:58] it came to pass after these things that
[1:05:01] god did tempt abraham
[1:05:04] and said unto him abraham and he said
[1:05:06] behold here i am
[1:05:08] and he said take now
[1:05:10] thy son
[1:05:12] thine only son
[1:05:14] whom thou lovest
[1:05:16] now i want you to remember that little
[1:05:17] statement there whom thou lovest
[1:05:21] and get thee into the land of moriah and
[1:05:22] offer him there for a burnt offering
[1:05:24] upon one of the mountains for which i
[1:05:26] tell thee of
[1:05:27] and abraham rose up early in the morning
[1:05:30] and saddled his ass and took two young
[1:05:32] men with him and isaac his son
[1:05:35] and claimed wood for the burnt offering
[1:05:38] and rose up and went into the place of
[1:05:40] which god had told him
[1:05:42] then on the third day
[1:05:44] how many is thankful for the third day
[1:05:47] on the third day abraham lifted up his
[1:05:50] eyes and saw the place afar off
[1:05:53] and abraham said unto his young men
[1:05:56] abide here with the ass and i and the
[1:05:59] lad will go yonder and worship remember
[1:06:01] that go yonder and worship
[1:06:05] and
[1:06:06] come again to you hold on to that
[1:06:08] there's a lot in this
[1:06:10] come again to you and abraham took the
[1:06:13] wood of the burnt offering and laid it
[1:06:15] upon isaac his son and he took the fire
[1:06:18] in his hand and a knife
[1:06:20] and they went both of them together
[1:06:22] and isaac spake unto abraham his father
[1:06:24] and said my father
[1:06:26] and he said here i am my son and he said
[1:06:28] behold the fire and the wood
[1:06:31] but where is the lamb for the burnt
[1:06:34] offering
[1:06:37] my goodness
[1:06:39] think about this question if it was
[1:06:41] given to you dad i see the wood i see
[1:06:43] the fire i see the knife but where is
[1:06:45] the
[1:06:46] where's the lamb at
[1:06:49] this was a 16 to 18 year old young man
[1:06:52] the prophet said some people think he
[1:06:53] was 33 around the same age as christ
[1:06:56] when all this happened this wasn't a
[1:06:58] child that was oblivious or didn't know
[1:07:00] what was going on he knew exactly what
[1:07:02] they were going to do
[1:07:04] where is the lamb
[1:07:06] and watch what abraham said my son
[1:07:09] remember this
[1:07:11] god will provide himself a lamb
[1:07:15] for a burnt offering
[1:07:16] and so they went to
[1:07:18] both of them together and they came to
[1:07:20] the place which god had told them of and
[1:07:22] abraham built an altar there and laid
[1:07:23] the wood in order and bound isaac
[1:07:27] his son
[1:07:28] and laid him on the altar upon the wood
[1:07:30] and abraham stretched forth his hand and
[1:07:32] took the knife
[1:07:34] to slay
[1:07:35] his
[1:07:36] son let's pray heavenly father we're
[1:07:39] thankful lord for this day you've given
[1:07:40] us for the many blessings in our lives
[1:07:43] regrets your mercy lord and lord we we
[1:07:47] feel like the service has been
[1:07:48] orchestrated from the very beginning to
[1:07:51] bring honor and glory to you and to
[1:07:53] build our faith this morning lord to to
[1:07:55] show us who we are as believers and to
[1:07:57] help us recognize that you move in our
[1:07:59] life you work in our life and you expect
[1:08:02] great things from us because you put it
[1:08:04] in there to begin with and you just want
[1:08:06] to see it pulled out of us lord and so
[1:08:07] we asked lord this morning as the word
[1:08:09] goes forth as the preaching and the
[1:08:11] teaching goes forward that we be drawn
[1:08:13] closer to you lord
[1:08:14] we just want to tell you lord we give
[1:08:16] you honor we give you praise and glory
[1:08:18] for all you do in jesus name god bless
[1:08:21] you may have your seats
[1:08:23] many times i feel like we
[1:08:26] we get to a place that we uh
[1:08:29] we
[1:08:30] take god's power and his ability for
[1:08:33] granted
[1:08:34] we don't we don't let god be god a lot
[1:08:38] of times we're so uh so caught up in our
[1:08:41] human self that we want to control
[1:08:43] things we want things to be the way we
[1:08:44] want it and we don't let god be god and
[1:08:47] do what god is capable of doing listen
[1:08:50] to this quote and
[1:08:51] it's in 54 god providing healing for
[1:08:54] this generation
[1:08:55] and and if you want to look it up but he
[1:08:57] says when the crucial moment has been
[1:08:59] come
[1:09:00] god is able to step in right there and
[1:09:02] provide the sacrifice or a provided way
[1:09:07] when god has made us a promise
[1:09:10] god's under obligation to his word to
[1:09:14] keep it
[1:09:17] his obligation is to you the believer so
[1:09:20] if he gives you a promise and he tells
[1:09:22] you that you're going to go through the
[1:09:23] life and you're going to do this and
[1:09:25] you're going to do that it's his
[1:09:26] obligation to keep his word listen to
[1:09:28] this next quote and this is where i it
[1:09:30] blew my mind i read it four or five
[1:09:31] times to make sure i was reading it
[1:09:32] right and i read it and listen what he
[1:09:35] says he says because god he's preaching
[1:09:38] in chicago
[1:09:39] and he says god could make sea serpes
[1:09:42] crawl out of that lake there so big that
[1:09:45] it would mash chicago down if he seemed
[1:09:48] fit to do it
[1:09:51] and we limit god's ability
[1:09:54] we limit what god can do he can make sea
[1:09:56] serpents crawl out of the lake so big
[1:09:58] that it would mash chicago down if he
[1:10:00] seemed fit to do it he says that sounds
[1:10:02] mythical but he could do it he could
[1:10:04] create one when god speaks he speaks
[1:10:06] life into existence and he can speak
[1:10:08] life out of existence he's god and we
[1:10:10] underestimate his being his ability for
[1:10:13] he can do all things
[1:10:19] so look in here we see
[1:10:22] abraham here
[1:10:25] looking here at abraham
[1:10:29] and the jewish teaching here tells us
[1:10:32] that uh abraham was tested in 10
[1:10:35] different manners of events in his life
[1:10:40] and a lot of times we we don't think
[1:10:41] about that we look at different people
[1:10:42] in the bible we look at the different
[1:10:44] events that they go through but we
[1:10:45] always think about abraham and being the
[1:10:47] father of faith
[1:10:49] brother branham says this he says now
[1:10:51] god the creator speaking here to abraham
[1:10:54] the patriarch and he said gave him a
[1:10:57] promise of a son through sarah his wife
[1:11:00] who was now nearing about the age of 90
[1:11:02] and abraham was a hundred and about that
[1:11:05] time about 25 years of waiting for god
[1:11:07] to fulfill his promise little isaac was
[1:11:10] born
[1:11:11] and then after isaac became the age of
[1:11:13] about 16 or 18 god told him to take
[1:11:15] isaac out and to offer him for a
[1:11:17] sacrifice and he said that was
[1:11:19] destroying destroying every hope that he
[1:11:23] would ever be heir
[1:11:25] to the world
[1:11:29] can you imagine what's going through
[1:11:31] abraham's mind
[1:11:33] god has given him this promise and now
[1:11:34] all of a sudden he's going to destroy
[1:11:36] every hope he has brothers and sisters
[1:11:38] over and over and over in life we're
[1:11:40] going to be tested
[1:11:43] and god here and the prophet's not
[1:11:45] talking about trials and so much of
[1:11:47] battles but something that will make you
[1:11:49] stand for what you believe
[1:11:51] abraham here was being called to stand
[1:11:53] for what he believed and he had to stand
[1:11:55] on the faith that was in him and i
[1:11:57] thought about this and i thought about
[1:11:58] peter and i thought about when peter was
[1:12:00] called and he wanted to walk on the
[1:12:02] water and he said lord beat me to come
[1:12:05] and so instantly there's something
[1:12:07] inside of him when jesus said come
[1:12:10] faith rose up inside of peter it was
[1:12:12] already there god had already there
[1:12:13] because peter had seen things happen
[1:12:15] over and over and over so peter now
[1:12:17] looks and he hears god come peter so he
[1:12:20] comes but what happened his faith began
[1:12:23] to waver
[1:12:24] he began to look at the circumstances
[1:12:26] all around him
[1:12:28] and that faith that was so strong to
[1:12:30] give him the ability the true ability to
[1:12:32] walk on water
[1:12:34] wavered
[1:12:37] and so peter because he's wavering faith
[1:12:39] he didn't he didn't hold on to all that
[1:12:42] he had learnt he didn't hold on to all
[1:12:44] that he had seen the miracles after
[1:12:46] miracle after miracle and because of
[1:12:47] that slowly he drifted down in the water
[1:12:50] and cried out saved me
[1:12:54] but we see abraham here he's got 10
[1:12:57] different times in his life that's
[1:12:58] documented in jewish traditions here god
[1:13:01] tells it let's look at him god tells him
[1:13:03] to leave your homeland and become a
[1:13:04] stranger in the land of canaan
[1:13:07] that takes a little bit of faith
[1:13:09] leave everything that you know leave all
[1:13:11] of your customs all of your traditions
[1:13:13] leave everything and go into a strange
[1:13:14] land and start all over
[1:13:18] of course immediately when he gets there
[1:13:21] what happens but a famine
[1:13:25] we a lot of times we make a move we
[1:13:26] think it's going to be for the better
[1:13:28] right
[1:13:30] and he gets there and there's a famine
[1:13:32] next thing we know the egyptians they
[1:13:34] like the looks of his wife
[1:13:38] say hey we we want to take her and he's
[1:13:39] all oh
[1:13:41] that's my sister
[1:13:43] you remember the story
[1:13:45] that's my sister because he was afraid
[1:13:46] for his life
[1:13:50] abraham faces the battle of nine kings
[1:13:53] another big battle there in the in the
[1:13:55] bible
[1:13:56] he marries hagar
[1:13:58] because he can't have children with
[1:14:00] sarah
[1:14:01] god tells him to circumcise himself at
[1:14:04] an at an old age
[1:14:08] that'll kill most people
[1:14:10] it was a brutal procedure back in those
[1:14:12] days and it would kill most people today
[1:14:17] again
[1:14:18] the second time his wife has looked upon
[1:14:22] twice
[1:14:24] and he tells the same stories my sister
[1:14:26] twice this happens
[1:14:28] and then god tells him things are
[1:14:30] finally going good he's got a child
[1:14:32] israel god tells him says send hagar
[1:14:34] away
[1:14:36] get rid of hagar and ishmael get them
[1:14:38] out of your life send them out of the
[1:14:39] way get them out gone
[1:14:44] and lastly god tells him to sacrifice
[1:14:46] his dear son isaac
[1:14:48] upon this altar
[1:14:50] and we see abraham's life it's it's
[1:14:52] spoken about and talked about again
[1:14:55] back into the new testament in the book
[1:14:56] of hebrews because we look at him as the
[1:14:58] father of faith and abraham is honored
[1:15:02] and he's honored for his obedience and
[1:15:04] his commitment to god and for the life
[1:15:06] he lived a faithful life to god
[1:15:11] and he's talked about in the heap in the
[1:15:13] book of hebrews in chapter 11
[1:15:15] and even sarah is brought into it and
[1:15:17] says through faith sarah also received
[1:15:20] strength to conceive and a child was
[1:15:22] delivered when she was past her age
[1:15:24] because she judged him faithful who had
[1:15:26] a promise
[1:15:29] so faith surrounded these people
[1:15:33] and as believers
[1:15:35] faith surrounds us people
[1:15:39] but what do we do with it
[1:15:42] so it's important that we look here and
[1:15:44] as we look at this and we break this
[1:15:45] down and we see brothers and sisters and
[1:15:47] we note here that god tested abraham
[1:15:50] and it wasn't so much of a test to
[1:15:52] produce faith to try to get him stronger
[1:15:55] in faith but it was it was a test to
[1:15:57] reveal the faith
[1:16:01] are you hearing me
[1:16:03] it was a test to reveal the faith that
[1:16:05] was already in there and god built this
[1:16:08] faith slowly
[1:16:09] in abraham's life tested him day by day
[1:16:12] slowly piece by piece year by year he
[1:16:15] was building and building and building
[1:16:17] to get abraham to a place that he could
[1:16:19] carry out what god was going to ask him
[1:16:21] to do
[1:16:23] and so what that tells us is that we
[1:16:25] have to learn from our trials and our
[1:16:27] tests
[1:16:29] we have to be committed to say god when
[1:16:31] i go through something and you put me
[1:16:33] through something what have i learned
[1:16:35] what have i gained how have i grown in
[1:16:38] your word and how has my faith been
[1:16:40] strengthened
[1:16:44] you have to ask yourself christians
[1:16:46] brothers and sisters we have to be
[1:16:48] honest and ask ourselves these things so
[1:16:50] that we can
[1:16:51] get to a place that god wants us you
[1:16:52] know we're expecting to take a rapture
[1:16:56] we've got to get the faith that's within
[1:16:58] us pulled out to the surface
[1:17:02] i can't imagine a better test than what
[1:17:03] the lord applied to abraham on that day
[1:17:07] here's your only son
[1:17:10] here's the son that i promised you for
[1:17:11] 25 years
[1:17:13] and there's the son that i turned you
[1:17:15] back to a young man so and your wife to
[1:17:17] a young woman so that you could have the
[1:17:18] sun here is the sun that's going to be
[1:17:20] heir to everything and you're going to
[1:17:22] be the the grains of sand are going to
[1:17:24] be the number of your people
[1:17:27] this is the sun think about it put it in
[1:17:29] your day put it in our perspective this
[1:17:31] is the one that you raised up you called
[1:17:33] it as a baby
[1:17:34] this is the son that you sent off to
[1:17:36] school you took pictures of him the
[1:17:38] first day of school
[1:17:39] you were so proud of him you got him
[1:17:41] involved in
[1:17:43] sports and he loved these things and now
[1:17:45] he's grown up to 16 18 years old he's a
[1:17:47] young man in the prime of his life
[1:17:52] and i want you to take him up here on
[1:17:53] this hill
[1:17:56] and slay him
[1:18:04] god calls down to abraham abraham and he
[1:18:07] says here i am
[1:18:09] here i am
[1:18:10] what was that abraham was quick to
[1:18:13] answer the call of god
[1:18:16] abraham was quick and it's a wonderful
[1:18:18] example of how the man or woman of faith
[1:18:20] should respond to god and then when god
[1:18:23] calls upon us we should be quick to
[1:18:25] faithfully answer him
[1:18:28] we should be able to answer god but do
[1:18:30] we do that
[1:18:34] do we do that
[1:18:40] said
[1:18:41] here i am
[1:18:42] which meant
[1:18:44] i'm ready
[1:18:50] abraham knew
[1:18:51] what he'd been through
[1:18:53] abraham knew the battles that he had
[1:18:55] overcome the trials the tests
[1:18:59] the life that he had been
[1:19:00] been honed out of
[1:19:03] and he looks at him and he says i'm
[1:19:04] ready god
[1:19:06] i'm ready to be taught
[1:19:08] i'm ready to obey
[1:19:10] i'm ready to surrender and i'm ready to
[1:19:13] be examined by god
[1:19:17] are we there
[1:19:19] are we there this morning that we can
[1:19:21] look at god and say god whatever the
[1:19:23] word when the word goes forth teach me
[1:19:25] from it god and i'm going to obey that
[1:19:27] word and god i want you to know that i'm
[1:19:29] going to fully surrender my life
[1:19:32] and here's the hard one
[1:19:34] and examine me
[1:19:39] how many of us can
[1:19:40] don't raise your hands
[1:19:42] but how many of us could stand before
[1:19:44] god and say examine me i know where i'm
[1:19:46] at god
[1:19:50] examine me
[1:19:52] that's a tough question
[1:19:57] but brothers and sisters i believe god
[1:20:00] when he asked called for abraham and
[1:20:01] abraham said here i am i believe that
[1:20:03] god must have adored the boldness in
[1:20:05] that man's voice
[1:20:07] and he must adore the boldness of the
[1:20:10] believers when we stand before him and
[1:20:11] say come god i need more of you
[1:20:17] take now your son your only son
[1:20:20] isaac
[1:20:22] did you notice there that there's
[1:20:23] significance in that
[1:20:25] that god called isaac
[1:20:28] your only son
[1:20:30] he called him your only son when abraham
[1:20:32] had another son ishmael
[1:20:34] but ishmael in the previous chapter had
[1:20:36] been cast out and thrown away and so as
[1:20:38] far as god was concerned and as far as
[1:20:41] the godly covenant was concerned abraham
[1:20:43] had one son
[1:20:48] one son
[1:20:50] and he looks at this and he says it's
[1:20:52] your only son isaac whom you
[1:20:56] love
[1:20:57] remember i told you to hold on to that
[1:20:58] whom you love
[1:21:01] and if you count
[1:21:03] or start in the book of genesis 1 1
[1:21:06] to genesis 22 when we get right here
[1:21:08] that's the first time the word love
[1:21:11] is ever used
[1:21:14] there's some significance there that's
[1:21:16] the first time that the word love is
[1:21:18] used in the bible i didn't believe it
[1:21:20] either go home put it in your computer
[1:21:22] keep it up and see it's the first time
[1:21:24] that love is ever used it's first
[1:21:26] mentioned in the context of a love
[1:21:28] between a father and a son
[1:21:32] and the connection of the idea that
[1:21:33] there's going to be a sacrificial
[1:21:35] offering of the son
[1:21:38] are you with me
[1:21:39] that's deep
[1:21:41] that's deep you better put on your
[1:21:42] thinking through your thinking caps
[1:21:44] because abraham is being told i want you
[1:21:47] to take your son whom you love i'm going
[1:21:49] to love my son
[1:21:56] the first time that love
[1:21:58] is cast into humanity
[1:22:04] yet with this love
[1:22:07] every phrase
[1:22:08] of god's commandment to abraham
[1:22:11] cuts like a knife
[1:22:14] everything god told abraham is cutting
[1:22:17] he tells him take your son he didn't say
[1:22:20] ask ask isaac
[1:22:22] ask him if if he wants to go
[1:22:25] go talk to sarah about this situation
[1:22:27] and see what she thinks
[1:22:31] take
[1:22:32] take your son your only son
[1:22:37] cuts him right there cuts him
[1:22:41] take your only son isaac whom you love
[1:22:46] cutting him
[1:22:49] cutting him deep
[1:22:52] and offer him
[1:22:53] as a burnt offering
[1:22:57] god telling abraham to offer him as a
[1:22:59] burnt offering
[1:23:03] for that offering to take place there
[1:23:04] has to be a sacrifice there has to be a
[1:23:06] death
[1:23:07] and you see abraham he was a sojourner
[1:23:10] he was a pilgrim in the land of canaan
[1:23:13] and and he heard about he heard this
[1:23:15] when god told him this and this wasn't
[1:23:17] nothing new for the canaanites
[1:23:20] this wasn't nothing they were used to
[1:23:22] having uh sacrifice sacrificial
[1:23:25] offerings before their gods
[1:23:27] and abraham hears this and it kind of
[1:23:30] strikes him just a little funny as he
[1:23:31] thinks about this can you imagine
[1:23:33] because he's thinking the people of
[1:23:35] canaan there's nothing strange about
[1:23:36] this
[1:23:37] but i thought yahweh was different
[1:23:41] i thought god was different
[1:23:43] and so with this command that god has
[1:23:45] given abraham he must wonder yahweh
[1:23:48] what kind of covenant is this i thought
[1:23:50] you was the creator of heaven and earth
[1:23:53] are you like these pagan gods that the
[1:23:56] canaanites and others worship
[1:24:00] they say it don't matter
[1:24:03] if god's leading you or not if god's
[1:24:05] head of the program or not there's going
[1:24:07] to be something that's going to place a
[1:24:08] little bit of doubt in your walk
[1:24:11] there's going to be something that gives
[1:24:12] you a little bit of room
[1:24:15] to make a decision
[1:24:17] you see our christian walk is based
[1:24:19] around the decisions we make
[1:24:22] and here abraham was caught between a
[1:24:25] rock and a hard place so to speak and he
[1:24:26] had to make a decision he had to make a
[1:24:28] decision am i going to believe that this
[1:24:30] is the god a new a god of a true
[1:24:34] covenant the creator of heaven and earth
[1:24:36] or am i going to believe this is some
[1:24:42] pagan see abraham's no different than we
[1:24:45] are today
[1:24:48] we find ourselves a lot of times in
[1:24:51] situations where we question our minds
[1:24:53] god what are you doing
[1:24:58] and we try to take things upon ourself
[1:25:02] but by the end of the story abraham knew
[1:25:04] that god was not like these pagan gods
[1:25:07] god was not going to demand a human
[1:25:09] sacrifice but in fact the truth was just
[1:25:11] the opposite but let me ask you this
[1:25:13] morning how would you react put yourself
[1:25:15] in abraham's shoes i always like to do
[1:25:17] that
[1:25:18] because i like to honestly ask myself
[1:25:20] what would i say
[1:25:24] put yourself in his shoes what would you
[1:25:26] say
[1:25:29] we would do what most people would say
[1:25:30] god mind your own business
[1:25:34] this is my son
[1:25:36] this is my life
[1:25:39] this is this is the way i want to do it
[1:25:41] mind your own business
[1:25:43] [Applause]
[1:25:46] thankful for one honest art
[1:25:52] i'm going to do it my way and see that's
[1:25:54] what the world has done
[1:25:56] [Music]
[1:25:57] they they tell god to mind his own
[1:25:59] business that's not what believers do
[1:26:02] but that's what the world does
[1:26:04] they say we need prayer in school
[1:26:07] mind your own business god we don't want
[1:26:09] you in our schools
[1:26:11] we know as believers we need the ten
[1:26:13] commandments to be posted on every
[1:26:14] building in the in the nation
[1:26:17] mind your own business god get out of
[1:26:18] our courts
[1:26:21] and that's what the world does over and
[1:26:23] over and over they say mind your own
[1:26:24] business but not abraham
[1:26:27] [Music]
[1:26:28] not abraham it meant more to him he
[1:26:31] wanted to be pleasing to god
[1:26:36] this test here was difficult
[1:26:40] in another aspect and it because it
[1:26:42] seemed to contradict the previous
[1:26:44] promise of god
[1:26:45] he's already told uh i told him he said
[1:26:48] it's already told abraham that i promise
[1:26:50] and isaac your seed shall be called
[1:26:55] that's a promise
[1:26:57] and what i said earlier you can't god
[1:26:59] can't change his mind on his promises
[1:27:02] it's going to come to pass and he tells
[1:27:04] him in isaac yours shall be called but
[1:27:06] still there's a strange contradictory
[1:27:09] how am i going to kill my son
[1:27:12] who's going to be
[1:27:13] who my seed is going to be in when he
[1:27:15] doesn't have children
[1:27:18] how am i going to do that how am i going
[1:27:20] to do this but god made a promise and
[1:27:23] brother and sister sometimes god wants
[1:27:25] us to learn the difference between
[1:27:27] trusting the promise
[1:27:29] and trusting the promiser
[1:27:33] there's a big difference
[1:27:36] there's a big difference between trust
[1:27:37] in the promise because we can believe
[1:27:38] for a promise but you may not get to
[1:27:41] that promise the way you thought you
[1:27:44] would and when you feel like you're
[1:27:47] running in circles and you're battling
[1:27:48] and you think god i know you told me to
[1:27:50] do this i know you told me to go here i
[1:27:52] know you told me to move here i know you
[1:27:54] told me to take this job i know you told
[1:27:56] me to send my kids here
[1:28:00] everything it seems like from the pits
[1:28:02] of hell battles against you
[1:28:07] are you trusting the promiser
[1:28:12] because the promiser said you're going
[1:28:13] to get there he didn't say hell
[1:28:19] and see it's easy for us sometimes to
[1:28:21] put god's promise
[1:28:23] before god himself and we feel it's our
[1:28:25] responsibility i'm going to bring this
[1:28:27] promise to pass
[1:28:31] god you told me i'm going to go here i'm
[1:28:34] going to do this i'm going to do that
[1:28:36] i'll tell you what i'm going to i'm
[1:28:37] going to go this way
[1:28:39] i'm going to circle around and i'm going
[1:28:40] to come back through here and i'm going
[1:28:41] to go through this through this riverbed
[1:28:43] and i'm going to climb this mountain
[1:28:46] and all the while god's saying
[1:28:49] you're on the wrong road to the promise
[1:28:52] the children of israel they were given a
[1:28:54] promise i promised land
[1:28:57] but they wanted to do it their own way
[1:29:01] and wander
[1:29:02] and wander
[1:29:04] and wander
[1:29:05] and wander on a few days journey for 40
[1:29:08] years
[1:29:11] you think they were trusting the
[1:29:13] promiser
[1:29:15] no no they were trusting in themselves
[1:29:17] but we we can't allow things in this
[1:29:19] world to to think we're going to take a
[1:29:20] matter into our own hands
[1:29:23] that's not the way the promiser works
[1:29:29] down south brother brown said there was
[1:29:30] a
[1:29:31] an old black guy that loved the lord he
[1:29:33] believed the word
[1:29:35] and he said his boss said to him said
[1:29:37] why do you carry that bible for
[1:29:40] and he said well boss i believe it
[1:29:44] he said you can't read
[1:29:46] he says what do you carry it for
[1:29:48] he said i carry it because i believe it
[1:29:50] from cover to cover
[1:29:52] and he said i believe the cover also
[1:29:54] because it's got holy bible on it
[1:29:58] and he said somebody tells me that
[1:30:00] anyway
[1:30:01] he said i know it can't fail for it's
[1:30:04] god's promise
[1:30:07] and the boss said do you believe that he
[1:30:09] keep all those promises
[1:30:12] he said i most certainly do
[1:30:15] and he said well what if god
[1:30:17] would tell you to jump through that
[1:30:18] stone wall
[1:30:20] what would you do
[1:30:24] he said i jump
[1:30:28] i jump
[1:30:31] now in our life
[1:30:33] if god told me to go through a stone
[1:30:34] wall
[1:30:36] i might try to go around
[1:30:38] the end of that thing
[1:30:40] because being honest
[1:30:42] it would probably hurt if i jumped into
[1:30:44] that stone wall
[1:30:47] are you with me
[1:30:48] so i'm going to try to take a route
[1:30:50] around it myself to get to where where
[1:30:52] god told me to be but that's not what
[1:30:54] this guy said
[1:30:55] he says no if god told me to jump
[1:30:57] through that stone wall i would jump
[1:30:59] and the boss told him he said well how
[1:31:01] would you think you'd get through it
[1:31:02] there's no hole in it
[1:31:04] and he said well if god told me to jump
[1:31:07] it'd have a hole in it when i got there
[1:31:11] that's faith
[1:31:12] that's living upon what the promiser
[1:31:14] says and not the promise so he said if
[1:31:16] god told me to jump through it i'm going
[1:31:18] to jump because there will be a hole
[1:31:20] there and no matter what kind of wall
[1:31:22] you're up against this morning if god
[1:31:25] told you that you would be on the other
[1:31:27] side he'll make a way through it
[1:31:34] god tells abraham go into the land of
[1:31:37] mariah
[1:31:38] and upon the mountains for which i shall
[1:31:40] tell you see god has specifics in life
[1:31:45] he's going to have him go to a specific
[1:31:47] place at a specific time on a specific
[1:31:49] day
[1:31:52] and we rush
[1:31:55] we rush things in life
[1:31:57] we're not patient like we should be we
[1:31:59] want things done now we're instant we're
[1:32:01] in the instant age and god says go to
[1:32:04] this certain certain place at this
[1:32:06] certain certain time and then i'm gonna
[1:32:07] instruct you what to do
[1:32:12] so abraham does just that
[1:32:15] he rises up early and no sign of
[1:32:18] hesitation when god tells him to go he
[1:32:20] rises up early
[1:32:22] and i'm thinking to myself that must
[1:32:24] have been one sleepless night
[1:32:27] as he's in the camp with isaac no one
[1:32:29] knows what's fixing to happen and i'm
[1:32:31] thinking that must have been one
[1:32:32] sleepless night but god's obedience
[1:32:34] showed that he trusted god even when he
[1:32:37] didn't
[1:32:38] understand that's where we find
[1:32:40] ourselves in trouble a lot of times we
[1:32:42] don't understand god and what he's
[1:32:44] wanting us to do and so
[1:32:46] we figure it out and we try to uh wait
[1:32:49] until we understand things in other
[1:32:51] words we say god i'll do it and i'll
[1:32:54] obey you and when i understand it all
[1:33:01] god's not wanting you to understand what
[1:33:03] he wants you to do
[1:33:05] i don't understand a lot of things god
[1:33:07] has asked me to do
[1:33:11] but he's asking me to believe
[1:33:13] because whenever we put ourselves up
[1:33:15] there and say god i'm going to wait till
[1:33:17] i understand you're putting yourself up
[1:33:19] there on equal grounds with him
[1:33:24] yep
[1:33:26] and that's not going to work
[1:33:28] abraham showed the the obedience
[1:33:32] abraham knew god i can't walk unless
[1:33:34] you're holding my hand
[1:33:36] and he knows that he goes through there
[1:33:38] and he he don't go through there and and
[1:33:40] seek or debate and ask for counsel from
[1:33:42] others
[1:33:45] why is it when sometimes god speaks in
[1:33:47] our lives
[1:33:49] and it's so dear and treasured we want
[1:33:52] to go ask everybody's opinion
[1:33:55] and everybody's approval god told me to
[1:33:57] do this god told me to do that what do
[1:33:59] you think about it
[1:34:03] abraham didn't question
[1:34:05] he got up he went he began to move and
[1:34:07] it showed that he trusted god even when
[1:34:09] he didn't feel like it how many times in
[1:34:11] our lives
[1:34:12] dad you had to walk trust god when you
[1:34:14] don't feel like it
[1:34:16] i'm thankful i don't have to operate on
[1:34:18] my feelings
[1:34:21] because many times i don't feel like
[1:34:22] doing a lot of things
[1:34:25] but god requires us to move upon him
[1:34:28] when he calls upon us not upon our
[1:34:30] feelings
[1:34:31] if we went up our feelings we'll be in
[1:34:33] trouble
[1:34:36] abraham didn't have a word of argument
[1:34:40] no arguments there not one solitary
[1:34:43] question not even hesitation
[1:34:45] when he did that it's like to say god
[1:34:47] you're god
[1:34:49] i don't have to ask you why
[1:34:51] i don't have to know what the purpose is
[1:34:53] i don't have to know what the reason is
[1:34:55] but god you said it i'll do it
[1:35:03] i'm saying a lot of catchy things here i
[1:35:05] hope you're writing these down but
[1:35:06] remember as i say it god your god if you
[1:35:08] said it i'll do it we're still talking
[1:35:10] about him taking his son to the top of
[1:35:11] the mountain cutting his throat spilling
[1:35:13] his blood and burning him
[1:35:16] there's the reality of it
[1:35:21] and he saddles up his donkey
[1:35:28] and he goes out and begins to cut wood
[1:35:34] here's abraham he's out here now and
[1:35:36] he's saddling up his own donkey and he's
[1:35:39] starting to cut wood splitting wood
[1:35:42] why would he do that
[1:35:45] abraham had
[1:35:47] hundreds probably servants
[1:35:49] he had all kinds of people he had two
[1:35:50] young men with him on this journey that
[1:35:52] could have easily went out there and got
[1:35:53] his donkey ready busted his wood and got
[1:35:55] it ready but he wasn't going to do that
[1:35:58] this man was a sheik
[1:36:00] and he was mighty in his camp but at
[1:36:03] this time in his life he became a wood
[1:36:05] splitter because he knew that this work
[1:36:07] was too sacred for anybody else's hands
[1:36:11] and so he humbles himself down and goes
[1:36:13] down to begin to split wood
[1:36:16] and he'll doubt every time he split a
[1:36:17] piece of wood it would split his heart
[1:36:22] knowing that the wood he's splitting
[1:36:25] is to sacrifice his son
[1:36:32] he goes to the place that god tells him
[1:36:34] to go
[1:36:36] and and he's wonderfully trusting and
[1:36:39] obedient
[1:36:41] and he goes right to the spot where god
[1:36:43] tells him to go
[1:36:47] and you know would have been a whole lot
[1:36:49] easier on abraham if he could have just
[1:36:51] said god spare my son
[1:36:54] i'll just take my life
[1:36:57] he would have gladly done that
[1:36:59] there's not a father sitting in here who
[1:37:01] wouldn't gladly give your life to save
[1:37:03] your son
[1:37:06] but abraham didn't do that
[1:37:09] and he came up on this place into the
[1:37:11] third day
[1:37:14] a place which is today the modern day
[1:37:16] jerusalem
[1:37:17] and he said i'll go up yonder and
[1:37:19] worship
[1:37:21] i'm going to go up yonder and worship
[1:37:23] and when we talk about worship that is
[1:37:24] the first time the word worship is used
[1:37:27] in the bible
[1:37:29] same as love isn't that something
[1:37:33] worship and love and you've got god and
[1:37:36] and and jesus and you've got abraham and
[1:37:38] isaac
[1:37:39] and you've got love and worship father
[1:37:41] son
[1:37:42] both both examples are committed
[1:37:44] themselves to
[1:37:45] saving
[1:37:49] he said i'm going to go up there and
[1:37:51] worship which means to bow down
[1:37:55] he wasn't going up there to sing songs
[1:37:56] of praise and have a worship elevation
[1:37:58] worship service
[1:38:03] no he was going there to bow down before
[1:38:05] god and say god you've called upon me to
[1:38:07] do this and in humility and obedience i
[1:38:10] laid my life my son's life
[1:38:14] down and abraham leave to go up on up
[1:38:18] into the altar
[1:38:20] up into the mountains and abraham makes
[1:38:21] one of the most faithful statements
[1:38:23] you'll ever see in the bible and he
[1:38:25] looks to his servants and he says and we
[1:38:27] will come back to you
[1:38:31] he didn't say i'm coming back
[1:38:34] he said we will come back to you one of
[1:38:36] the most faithful things that's ever
[1:38:38] said and he's speaking to these young
[1:38:40] men and he's telling him i believe that
[1:38:42] both me myself and isaac are going to
[1:38:45] return
[1:38:48] so let me ask you how could he do that
[1:38:51] how could god tell him to go up there
[1:38:53] and sacrifice his son but yet he knows
[1:38:55] he's going to come back with him
[1:38:57] there was something deep on the deep on
[1:38:59] the inside there that was called to
[1:39:00] abraham and let him know that no matter
[1:39:02] what happens if god takes your only son
[1:39:06] and slays him he'll raise him up again
[1:39:10] he didn't ever doubt that there was
[1:39:11] going to be a sacrifice
[1:39:13] he didn't ever doubt that there was
[1:39:14] going to be a sacrifice but he knew that
[1:39:16] god would see a way back through because
[1:39:18] god had promised him isaac and him will
[1:39:21] be your seed
[1:39:31] you know at this age abraham's done been
[1:39:33] through a lot
[1:39:35] abraham's been through a lot in life at
[1:39:37] this point
[1:39:38] and abraham is at this point he's
[1:39:41] already been
[1:39:42] rejuvenated to youth and his wife sarah
[1:39:44] rejuvenated to youth and had a son so
[1:39:46] the probability of him the likelihood of
[1:39:49] him having any more children should
[1:39:51] isaac die
[1:39:53] it's not very good
[1:39:55] so he's living on a promise
[1:39:58] that is out of this world
[1:40:01] he's living upon a promise knowing that
[1:40:03] if isaac dies the very light of abraham
[1:40:06] is quenched
[1:40:08] there is no seed and abraham's name is
[1:40:11] forgotten
[1:40:17] abraham knew listen to this abraham knew
[1:40:20] anything was possible but he also knew
[1:40:23] that it was impossible for god to break
[1:40:24] his promise
[1:40:27] abraham knew that god was not a liar
[1:40:30] he knew that god was not a liar other
[1:40:33] than but but he based his up on his
[1:40:35] faith
[1:40:36] he based it upon god's promise
[1:40:38] and abraham now takes this wood and his
[1:40:40] burnt offering and lays it upon isaac
[1:40:43] his son this thing is progressing we're
[1:40:45] getting to the end of this battle
[1:40:48] we're getting to the end of this
[1:40:50] conflict that abraham's going through
[1:40:52] and having to see what god is wanting
[1:40:53] him to do
[1:40:54] and isaac received the wood
[1:40:57] for his own sacrifice
[1:41:01] he receives the wood from his own
[1:41:03] sacrifice from his father and carries it
[1:41:05] to the hill
[1:41:07] now let me tell you
[1:41:10] if my daddy told me he was going to kill
[1:41:12] me
[1:41:13] in a roundabout way i'm going to put i
[1:41:15] don't put the picture of the puzzle
[1:41:17] together i see the big picture
[1:41:19] all right we're going up here we got
[1:41:20] fire we got wood we got ropes to bind
[1:41:22] somebody with
[1:41:24] we got a knife
[1:41:26] but we don't have a lamp
[1:41:28] and i'm 16 17 years old
[1:41:31] man somebody fixing a fight
[1:41:33] either that or i'm fixing a run
[1:41:38] won't be no holding me on that mountain
[1:41:43] but there was something more to it there
[1:41:45] the bible says they have all of this
[1:41:48] and the bible says but the two of them
[1:41:50] went together
[1:41:52] you know what that means
[1:41:54] it literally means that the two of them
[1:41:55] went
[1:41:57] in
[1:41:58] agreement
[1:42:02] but when we look at abraham we think oh
[1:42:03] abraham's the father of faith and and
[1:42:06] and he's so obedient to the word of god
[1:42:08] but look at isaac
[1:42:11] we're talking about a young man that
[1:42:12] says
[1:42:14] god didn't speak to him
[1:42:16] he's going upon the promises of his
[1:42:18] daddy
[1:42:19] and he's saying god spoke to you i agree
[1:42:22] with your dad i'll do whatever you have
[1:42:24] me to do
[1:42:27] in agreement
[1:42:30] and he looks at him
[1:42:32] he said my son
[1:42:33] [Music]
[1:42:34] god will provide a lamb himself
[1:42:37] for this burnt offering
[1:42:40] abraham knew
[1:42:43] somehow that there was going to be a
[1:42:45] sacrifice
[1:42:47] and that god was going to offer
[1:42:49] something
[1:42:50] for sacrifice
[1:42:53] but where is this lamb
[1:42:57] where is this lamb
[1:43:00] what are we going to do where is this
[1:43:02] lamb how can we find this lamb we're
[1:43:03] going up into the mountains where
[1:43:05] there's no water there's rocks there's
[1:43:06] no vegetation there's nothing up there
[1:43:08] that can live where is this lamb
[1:43:11] that question has been asked all through
[1:43:13] the bible through the faithful from
[1:43:14] isaac to moses to david to isaiah all
[1:43:17] the way to john the baptist to where he
[1:43:19] finally says behold the lamb of god who
[1:43:22] takes away the sin of the world
[1:43:28] where is this lamb
[1:43:32] and here we have a remarkable picture
[1:43:36] we have a picture of the work of jesus
[1:43:39] at the cross
[1:43:41] thousands of years
[1:43:43] before it ever happened
[1:43:45] we have a picture of the son of a
[1:43:47] promise
[1:43:48] willingly went to sacrifice in obedience
[1:43:51] to his father
[1:43:52] carrying the wood
[1:43:56] on his back
[1:43:58] up a hill
[1:44:01] upon the same mountain with full
[1:44:03] confidence that there will be a
[1:44:05] resurrection
[1:44:11] i hope this is not too too deep
[1:44:14] because i'm not a deep preacher and if
[1:44:16] i'm too deep we're in trouble
[1:44:20] as an obedient son
[1:44:22] isaac lays down this wood
[1:44:26] and he lays down this wood ready to be
[1:44:28] sacrificed
[1:44:30] and brothers and sisters abraham now
[1:44:32] stretches out his hand and takes this
[1:44:34] knife to slay his son
[1:44:37] and abraham there's completely willing
[1:44:39] to plunge this knife right into the
[1:44:42] heart of his own son
[1:44:45] willingly
[1:44:47] and able
[1:44:49] to do it
[1:44:53] but he's got a hope
[1:44:55] he's got a promise
[1:44:57] he's got a promise that if he has to go
[1:44:59] through with this and this is the way
[1:45:01] the sacrifice lays out he's got a
[1:45:02] promise in his mind that somehow god is
[1:45:05] going to raise him up
[1:45:12] and the prophet said he raised his hand
[1:45:14] and as he raised his hand the holy ghost
[1:45:16] caught it
[1:45:19] and the holy ghost called it and said
[1:45:21] abraham abraham he said here i am lord
[1:45:24] can you imagine the the elation he must
[1:45:27] have had when he heard that voice and he
[1:45:29] felt the holy ghost stop his hand and
[1:45:30] says here i am lord stay your hand don't
[1:45:33] touch the boy
[1:45:38] don't touch the boy
[1:45:42] i know
[1:45:43] you love me
[1:45:46] listen
[1:45:47] you wouldn't withhold your own son
[1:45:51] i know you love
[1:45:54] me abraham
[1:45:59] and about that time
[1:46:05] in a land where there's no lambs living
[1:46:10] and he hears this bleeding from behind
[1:46:12] him he looks around and there's a ram a
[1:46:14] little male sheep caught by his horns in
[1:46:16] the thick where did that ram come of it
[1:46:18] he said he was a hundred miles from
[1:46:20] civilization
[1:46:22] where did that lamb come from he's on
[1:46:24] top of this mountain where there's
[1:46:25] nothing no water how did he get up there
[1:46:28] it wasn't a vision it was a real lamb
[1:46:31] said he picked him up and he was kicking
[1:46:33] and bleeding
[1:46:34] and he laid him up there and he cut his
[1:46:36] throat and the blood run out
[1:46:40] it wasn't a vision
[1:46:42] it was a real lamb
[1:46:44] it was a real lamb where did it come
[1:46:46] from no wonder he called it jehovah
[1:46:48] jireh
[1:46:50] the lord provided
[1:46:52] he said god almighty who could speak
[1:46:55] himself into a body and speak angels
[1:46:57] into a body spoke that ram into
[1:47:00] existence
[1:47:04] and you're going to tell me we're going
[1:47:05] to worry about how we get to the other
[1:47:06] side of our promises when god says right
[1:47:09] there hundreds of miles from
[1:47:10] civilization he speaks a ram into
[1:47:12] existence
[1:47:14] and the prophet said that he can he can
[1:47:16] take and make a hole through a wall
[1:47:17] where you can go through it
[1:47:19] and he's telling me he can make a sea
[1:47:20] serpent come out of the lake of chicago
[1:47:22] that would smash it to the ground
[1:47:27] amen thank you
[1:47:30] and so here we have now into existence
[1:47:33] in one minute five minutes later it went
[1:47:35] out of existence he said for god is
[1:47:37] jehovah jireh no matter what the
[1:47:39] conditions are he'll provide himself a
[1:47:42] sacrifice
[1:47:51] when god asked abraham for an ultimate
[1:47:53] demonstration of love and commitment
[1:47:56] he asked for his son
[1:48:00] when god the father wanted to show us
[1:48:03] the ultimate demonstration of his love
[1:48:05] and commitment to us
[1:48:07] he gave us his son
[1:48:12] we can say to the lord now
[1:48:15] lord
[1:48:16] i know that you love me
[1:48:19] seeing that you have not withheld your
[1:48:21] son
[1:48:22] your only son
[1:48:24] from me
[1:48:26] do you see how these two turned on each
[1:48:28] other
[1:48:30] one goes right in and dovetails right
[1:48:32] into the other story
[1:48:34] here's the lamb that abraham goes up
[1:48:36] there and willingly gives his son a
[1:48:38] sacrifice because and god looks like he
[1:48:41] says i know you love me now abraham i
[1:48:43] know you love me but now we can look and
[1:48:45] say god i know you love me
[1:48:47] because you gave me your son
[1:48:50] your only son and abraham looks at that
[1:48:53] place and says i'm gonna name this place
[1:48:56] jehovah
[1:48:57] jairo
[1:49:00] notice that he didn't name it in the
[1:49:02] reference of what he experienced
[1:49:05] no
[1:49:06] he didn't name it mount trial
[1:49:09] he didn't name it mount agony
[1:49:12] or mount obedience
[1:49:14] instead he named it a hill for what
[1:49:16] reference
[1:49:17] to what god had done for him he named it
[1:49:20] mount provision
[1:49:25] see sometimes we walk up these mountains
[1:49:28] and it's step by step
[1:49:31] and day by day
[1:49:33] and we wonder
[1:49:35] when will i see the promise
[1:49:38] but just above the top
[1:49:42] there is a promise to be had
[1:49:44] isaac his life is a picture of jesus it
[1:49:46] becomes clear both were loved by their
[1:49:49] fathers
[1:49:51] both were offered themselves willingly
[1:49:55] jesus willingly offered his life carried
[1:49:57] that that wood upon his back up to the
[1:50:00] mount mount calvary isaac carrying the
[1:50:02] wood upon his back to mount provision
[1:50:08] both carried their wood up there both
[1:50:10] were sacrificed on the very same hill
[1:50:14] in the very same region
[1:50:16] and both were delivered on the same
[1:50:18] third day
[1:50:22] what a story we have here
[1:50:24] brothers and sisters
[1:50:26] as we close here there's no reason for
[1:50:29] us not to believe what god has promised
[1:50:31] us
[1:50:32] god has promised us a life and a life of
[1:50:35] abundance god has promised us a life and
[1:50:38] raptures at the end of this life god has
[1:50:41] offered us and given us a commitment to
[1:50:43] him that says we are his
[1:50:46] and because we're his
[1:50:48] he is
[1:50:51] that's ours so if you're walking up the
[1:50:53] hill today
[1:50:54] if you're walking up a mountain today
[1:50:57] and god has made you a promise i i
[1:50:59] challenge you to grasp on to that
[1:51:01] promise
[1:51:02] and say god i don't know how but the
[1:51:04] sacrifice will be made i don't know how
[1:51:07] i'll get there i don't know how i'll get
[1:51:08] what you've got for me but god i know
[1:51:10] that there will be a sacrifice made and
[1:51:12] i'm going to come out on the other side
[1:51:16] do you love him this morning
[1:51:18] musicians if you would come would stand
[1:51:20] to our feet
[1:51:27] i love i love breaking down stories and
[1:51:29] i know it's hard sometimes when you
[1:51:30] teach it it wears you out
[1:51:33] but we need good scriptural teaching
[1:51:36] because like i said it's the little
[1:51:38] things we overlook that may just be the
[1:51:40] little tidbits you need to get you
[1:51:41] through tomorrow
[1:51:47] if we could just all bow our heads
[1:51:50] go before the lord in prayer
[1:51:56] lord we thank you lord for
[1:51:58] this little service lord jesus and we
[1:52:01] thank you for the word lord as
[1:52:03] as it was given to us this morning lord
[1:52:05] and i know it sure
[1:52:06] touched my heart and things that were
[1:52:08] brought out that i'd never seen before
[1:52:11] and to know that
[1:52:13] when abraham and isaac was typing you
[1:52:16] and jesus and the sacrifice that would
[1:52:18] be made it was the first time that love
[1:52:20] was mentioned
[1:52:21] and there's no greater love than the
[1:52:23] love that uh that you have for your son
[1:52:25] and for the the love that jesus
[1:52:28] willingly went up on the cross of
[1:52:29] calvary and shed his blood for us
[1:52:32] a sacrifice
[1:52:34] a substitute for where i should have
[1:52:36] been this morning
[1:52:39] there's no greater love story to be told
[1:52:44] for that blood that was shed for sinners
[1:52:46] such as i
[1:52:49] so lord we worship you this morning
[1:52:52] we bowed down humbly before you this
[1:52:54] morning
[1:52:55] with humility and obedience lord jesus
[1:52:58] coming before you and just asking lord
[1:53:00] that you will
[1:53:02] continue to draw out the faith that's
[1:53:05] inside us
[1:53:06] that you will continue to strengthen
[1:53:08] that faith that is inside us lord lord
[1:53:10] we've heard the word preached for years
[1:53:12] we've heard of a rapture we've heard of
[1:53:15] uh
[1:53:16] of a translation of an instantaneous
[1:53:18] translation lord but build our faith a
[1:53:20] greater day by day by day
[1:53:24] that we could accept
[1:53:26] a transformation that's to take place
[1:53:30] because god no matter what we do
[1:53:34] if we will commit ourselves and be in
[1:53:36] obedience to you as abraham was we know
[1:53:38] that you will see us through
[1:53:41] [Music]
[1:53:43] and we thank you for that lord
[1:53:48] yes thank you lord jesus
