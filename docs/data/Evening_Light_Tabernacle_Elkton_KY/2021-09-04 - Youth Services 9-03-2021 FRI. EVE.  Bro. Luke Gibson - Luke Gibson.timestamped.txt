[6:03] god bless you and good to see everybody
[6:05] tonight amen
[6:07] amen just praise the lord for bringing
[6:10] everybody safe amen i know it's a lot of
[6:12] probably a lot of trouting for everybody
[6:14] so let's just give the lord a hand for
[6:16] bringing everybody here safely thank you
[6:19] [Applause]
[6:23] we want to welcome everyone to our
[6:26] i don't know 18th somewhere in there i
[6:28] guess brother john
[6:29] somewhere but anyway to our 2021 youth
[6:33] meetings we don't call the bank but
[6:35] anymore because we don't have that but
[6:36] we are
[6:37] able to
[6:38] squeeze this in this year because that's
[6:40] kind of what we're doing i know the
[6:41] covet's going around and
[6:43] and so there's a lot of people leery of
[6:45] it but we haven't had a lot of it around
[6:47] here so
[6:48] i know it is different places so we do
[6:50] ask everybody to be careful if you feel
[6:52] sick at all
[6:54] uh that you would not come amen because
[6:56] we certainly don't want to spread
[6:57] anything and we do appreciate
[6:59] those who are taking precautions just to
[7:01] watch it a little bit but our ultimate
[7:03] faith is in the lord jesus christ
[7:04] somebody believes that
[7:05] but we're looking forward to a good time
[7:07] in the lord amen and i believe after uh
[7:10] you know i know it's always kind of a
[7:13] time of winding down for us here at the
[7:15] church especially and those
[7:17] who are getting everything together all
[7:19] of us sometimes you have so much on your
[7:21] mind
[7:22] that you really need to just stop and
[7:24] say lord i'm just shutting in with you
[7:26] now and
[7:27] laying down all the cares and the
[7:29] worries about whether this is done or
[7:30] whether that's done
[7:32] amen because the ultimate thing that
[7:34] we're looking for is for the lord jesus
[7:35] christ to come unto amen
[7:38] just let his presence be felt amen
[7:41] amen how many wants to just make jesus
[7:44] welcome amen just make jesus welcome
[7:47] amen and to speak to our hearts through
[7:49] his minister amen brother luke gibson
[7:51] he's our minister this weekend we
[7:53] certainly appreciate him coming up amen
[7:56] and those who came with them and so
[7:57] forth we appreciate all of you amen so i
[8:00] know all of our visitors by all all of
[8:02] you as visitors almost uh but anyway so
[8:05] we appreciate amen and welcome you amen
[8:08] and we look forward to amen getting to
[8:10] spend the weekend with you with the
[8:12] grace by the grace of god
[8:14] amen
[8:16] so we just going to stand and have
[8:18] prayer amen

[8:22] have a prayer request here and i do want
[8:24] to remember my brother-in-law david and
[8:27] his wife amy

[8:30] not but they do have had some really bad
[8:33] symptoms of some sickness of
[8:36] sorest vote headaches and things like
[8:38] that so we just pray god will be
[8:39] merciful to them and i have one here

[8:44] stomach issues so we want to remember
[8:47] cody

[8:50] spoken request tonight before we go for

[9:03] great throne of grace tonight lord

[9:45] highlight it's god to be able to hear
[9:47] your word lord jesus everything else is
[9:49] temporal but father we know it when we
[9:51] hear your word it is eternal lord it's
[9:54] the only thing of value and we ask god
[9:56] that you'd help us lord to ask in your
[9:58] presence and lord that the minister
[10:00] father would be welcomed lord jesus thus
[10:02] gift would be welcomed and pulled on
[10:04] father and that lord it would bring down

[10:11] jesus we come with great expectation
[10:13] lord knowing god that we don't just come

[39:53] it's just good to be a christian tonight
[39:55] always good to be in the service of the
[39:57] lord and you know believe this or not
[39:59] i've been going to church since i've
[40:01] been eight days year old
[40:04] i've been going to church even when i
[40:05] don't remember going to church
[40:07] my mommy had me and
[40:09] one week later they said i was in church
[40:11] i was in a pentecostal old-fashioned
[40:13] tent meeting took me out to the service
[40:16] and
[40:16] i used to be have to be made to go to
[40:18] church i'm glad my parents made me go to
[40:21] church but i sure love it when god gave
[40:22] me the holy ghost and i wanted to go to
[40:25] church
[40:26] amen i
[40:27] am certainly happy to be here tonight in
[40:29] the service of the lord and just want to
[40:31] take a moment say thank you to your
[40:32] pastor for first of all for having this
[40:35] meeting been willing to have a meeting
[40:37] like this at times like we're living in
[40:39] and then giving us the privilege of the
[40:41] invite to be able to be here to
[40:43] fellowship around the word of the lord
[40:45] i've been doing my best for the last 23
[40:47] years in south carolina to shorten the
[40:50] generational gap i believe the young
[40:52] people face battles that i don't face
[40:55] maybe as a 51 year old man or someone
[40:57] else faces a 70 year old man but i do
[41:00] believe that the gospel message to the
[41:02] young and the old is exactly the same
[41:04] message
[41:05] so i won't change that i have seven
[41:08] children two of my children are with me
[41:10] tonight zechariah
[41:12] and abigail and then my wife is with me
[41:14] also and then my
[41:16] oldest grandson is with me as well i got
[41:19] five grandkids now been 15 years i think
[41:21] since i've been here 14 or 15 years none
[41:24] of my children were married but now
[41:25] they've given me five grandkids and i
[41:27] got another one on the way
[41:29] and if i knew them grandkids were going
[41:30] to be so much fun i would have had them
[41:32] first
[41:34] i tell everybody i love seeing my
[41:35] grandkids come
[41:37] they live next door to me i love seeing
[41:38] them come over to the house but i sure
[41:39] love seeing when they leave
[41:42] amen so
[41:43] but tonight god don't have no
[41:44] grandchildren the prophet of god said
[41:46] all he has the sons and daughters and
[41:49] the only way that we can get into him is
[41:50] we have to be borned into him by the
[41:52] holy ghost so we still believe in
[41:54] old-fashioned holy ghost message amen we
[41:57] certainly um do appreciate the lord
[41:59] tonight i was born for this kind of an
[42:02] atmosphere
[42:04] singing don't bother me
[42:06] music don't bother me
[42:08] somebody's screaming amen don't bother
[42:10] me i don't even get nervous when people
[42:12] shout
[42:13] i i like to see people enjoy what they
[42:16] have
[42:17] i mean we go the ball games people
[42:19] scream like crazy and then we come to
[42:22] church and people get quiet as a church
[42:23] mouse i got a boy back there when he was
[42:26] a kid we were at that six flags i
[42:28] believe it's called six flags over
[42:30] georgia and i did i never have liked
[42:32] them stupid roller coaster i think
[42:34] that's all temptation tempting god you
[42:36] know that stuff but i he told me so

[42:40] when i say that you know
[42:41] but i had he told me daddy come ride
[42:43] with me i said no oh come on daddy ride
[42:46] so i decided i'd get on there with him
[42:48] and they they make it go real slow going
[42:50] up
[42:51] it's kind of just anticipation when you
[42:53] get the top he told me to lift my hands
[42:56] up
[42:56] and i lift my hands i'm going to drop
[42:58] down the other side son you talk about
[43:00] screaming my stomach went down in my

[43:35] lord
[43:37] been baptized in the name of the lord
[43:38] jesus christ that's to me i'm a blessed

[43:44] office one day down in louisiana i was
[43:47] 21 years old i'll never forget these
[43:49] words it was like a knife into my heart

[43:53] you dare go around the world
[43:55] and try to win the world
[43:57] and lose your own family
[43:59] and man that has stuck with me and i
[44:01] have done everything i can to not be a
[44:05] legalist but i've tried to make my
[44:08] children realize how wonderful it is to
[44:10] serve christ

[44:15] almost 29 years the oldest are have
[44:18] never had to ask mom and daddy are we

[44:27] tonight amen now i want you to turn with
[44:30] me if you would as you're standing i
[44:31] want to just make a confession i'm going
[44:33] to do my best to preach in the simplest
[44:37] and most practical terms i can
[44:39] because they said i'm preaching to young
[44:40] people
[44:41] and young people you're going to love me
[44:42] for this i'm going to try to also preach
[44:45] short
[44:47] i'm going to try to preach short
[44:48] messages but i want to get right to the
[44:50] point i don't want to drag it out i want
[44:52] to just get my thought i have struggled
[44:55] i prayed i've asked god or which way
[44:57] would you like me to go and just i just
[44:59] want to obey him if i could and just
[45:01] talk to you from my heart what god has
[45:04] laid on it so luke chapter 22 i want to
[45:07] read verse 31 and verse 32.
[45:11] i didn't know do y'all put scripture
[45:13] okay all right um luke 22
[45:16] beginning with verse 31
[45:18] and we'll read 31 and 32. now i'm going
[45:21] to take my jacket off and i don't mean
[45:22] i'm preaching a long time
[45:24] i don't have
[45:26] a what but i see a clock back there and
[45:28] that's a good thing
[45:29] it's like you you've heard the story of
[45:31] the old pentecostal boy talk the
[45:33] catholic kid and they're going to church
[45:34] with him so if you come to me i'll go to
[45:36] mass with you you ever heard that and so
[45:38] the little pentecostal boy went to the
[45:39] catholic church and the priest you know
[45:41] he did something like this and the old
[45:42] pentecost boy said what's that he'd tell
[45:44] him and then he dipped his finger in the
[45:46] water and did something else said what's
[45:47] that then he rubbed some beans he said
[45:49] what's that head keep asking about
[45:51] everything going on so finally the
[45:53] catholic boy went to the pentecost
[45:55] aboard the church and the preacher got
[45:56] to preach him he'd pick up his watch and
[45:58] look at set it back down and he'd preach
[46:00] along her pick up his watch and look and
[46:01] set it back down and preach along pick
[46:03] up his watch set it back down find a cat
[46:05] boy had an upset what does that mean
[46:06] when he picks up his watch he said
[46:08] absolutely nothing
[46:14] i don't want that to be your experience
[46:16] tonight
[46:17] luke 22 beginning with verse 31
[46:21] and the lord said simon
[46:24] simon behold
[46:27] satan hath desired to have you
[46:30] that he
[46:31] may sift you
[46:34] as wheat
[46:36] i love this but i have prayed for thee
[46:39] that thy faith fail not
[46:42] and when
[46:44] not if but when thou art converted
[46:48] strengthen

[47:06] has made efforts to come into your
[47:08] presence we thank you for brother

[47:12] led us tonight in worship and brought us

[47:20] god

[47:30] we desire
[47:31] lord for the flashlight of your presence
[47:33] to shine upon every heart
[47:36] and lord if there be some way in us

[47:45] transformation would come
[47:47] lord only you can change us
[47:50] we can do things to make ourselves
[47:52] better but lord only you have the power
[47:55] and the ability to change our lives
[47:58] we pray you do that tonight speak to
[48:00] every heart on this opening service
[48:02] we'll give you praise for all things in
[48:04] the name of the lord jesus christ
[48:06] and everybody says
[48:08] you young people shake somebody's hand a
[48:10] couple of hands one or two and just tell
[48:12] them that say god bless you problems
[48:14] that's the greatest thing you say
[48:16] somebody's god bless you and then you
[48:18] may be seated god bless you brother god
[48:20] bless you brother william
[48:27] our scene tonight opens
[48:30] with what is known as the upper room
[48:34] jesus had just
[48:36] broke bread with his disciples
[48:39] in what we would call the last supper
[48:42] really it's known as the last supper but
[48:44] it's really to us the first
[48:46] communion it was here that jesus had
[48:50] girded himself with a towel
[48:52] knelt down in the most
[48:54] humbling
[48:56] like a what the prophet would call in
[48:58] the sense of a foot washing flunky
[49:01] humility is what he displayed in that
[49:04] room that night
[49:05] and he washed the disciples feet
[49:09] it was here the disciples had this final
[49:12] moment of solitude just them and the
[49:16] lord jesus
[49:18] i think in my heart
[49:19] what a blessing that must have been
[49:22] to have maybe we would have been like
[49:25] peter and shocked just to think that
[49:27] jesus would kneel down there and attempt
[49:30] to wash
[49:31] his feet when we would think no no no
[49:33] let us wash your feet
[49:35] but jesus said that the son of man came
[49:38] not to be served but to serve
[49:41] the property god made a comment that was
[49:44] never a man that ever lived like jesus
[49:47] matter of fact he said that eternal life
[49:50] was not living for yourself but it was
[49:53] living for others
[49:55] jesus was the greatest example of a man
[49:59] who fully gave his life for each one of
[50:02] us tonight
[50:04] i remember one day
[50:06] jesus was you know he always somehow
[50:08] made the religious crowd angry
[50:11] the bible says that he was a a friend of
[50:14] sinners
[50:16] the religious people were uncomfortable
[50:18] with him but it seemed like sinners
[50:21] felt this comfortable to surround him
[50:23] because jesus wasn't a condemning person
[50:26] he was a man that had compassion on them
[50:28] that were lost
[50:30] one day they were so upset with him the
[50:33] bible said they took up stones to stone
[50:35] and he said for what good work that you
[50:38] stole me they said thou being a man
[50:41] maketh thyself god
[50:43] but they were wrong jesus was not a man
[50:46] making himself god he was god who made
[50:49] himself a man
[50:51] and he was the greatest display of what
[50:54] god would want to be if he were to
[50:56] become a man and he did in the person of
[50:59] the lord jesus christ
[51:01] after that
[51:03] setting then all of a sudden jesus stops
[51:07] and he looks to peter but this time he
[51:11] doesn't call him peter
[51:13] he says simon
[51:16] simon
[51:18] behold satan has desired to help you
[51:22] that he may sift you as wheat now you
[51:25] know when jesus called peter originally
[51:28] he was simon bart jonah but do you know
[51:31] in matthew chapter 16 when jesus asked
[51:35] the disciples it finally came to place
[51:37] that his ministry was such displayed
[51:40] that he turned the disciples said hey
[51:41] who do men say i the son of man am
[51:45] they said well some say you're this and
[51:47] john the baptist elias jeremiah's on the
[51:50] prophets but then he stopped saying but
[51:52] who do you say i am
[51:54] and it was then that simon
[51:57] spoke out and said thou art the christ
[52:01] the son of the living god jesus stopped
[52:05] and said simon barjona blessed are you
[52:08] flesh and blood hath not give you this
[52:11] but my father which is in heaven have to
[52:13] give you this
[52:15] look jesus was a flesh man so he himself
[52:18] didn't even give simon that revelation
[52:20] he attributed the revelation that simon
[52:23] had that came from the
[52:26] father then he stopped and he said but i
[52:28] said unto thee thou art
[52:31] peter
[52:35] he didn't call him simon
[52:37] he called him peter
[52:39] and do you know that for the rest of his
[52:42] ministry with peter jesus never called
[52:46] him simon
[52:48] only would refer to him as peter
[52:51] but this night
[52:53] in that supper room he doesn't turn to
[52:56] him and say peter peter
[52:59] he says simon
[53:01] simon
[53:02] satan have desired to help you that he
[53:05] may sift you as weak now remember it was
[53:08] this simon that said you're the christ
[53:10] the son of the living god
[53:12] it was also this simon that said lord
[53:15] don't just watch my hands and feet watch
[53:17] me all the way through
[53:19] then jesus stopped and said look behold
[53:23] look behold simon simon satan had
[53:26] desired to help you
[53:28] listen to that brother that ought to
[53:30] tell you something i'm going to tell you
[53:31] something right the closer you get to
[53:34] god the more the enemy's going to come
[53:36] after you
[53:38] i hear people say well the devil don't
[53:40] never bother me that's because you don't
[53:42] never bother him
[53:45] you go to you make up your mind and i
[53:47] i'm going to pray more i'm going to
[53:49] listen to tapes more i'm going to go to
[53:51] church more you watch all hell turn
[53:53] loose on you the devil will come after
[53:55] you with everything he's got because
[53:57] every time there's you make a step and
[53:59] get closer to god satan's going to do
[54:00] his best to try to drive you away from
[54:02] that presence
[54:04] but listen to this
[54:06] he says
[54:07] satan have desired to have you
[54:10] listen to that satan not to kill you but
[54:12] to have you that he may sift you as
[54:16] wheat
[54:17] now watch this because at the end of the
[54:20] word wheat
[54:21] is where you see that little colon which
[54:23] means the thought isn't done
[54:26] here comes a really big word
[54:28] that jesus uses and he said but
[54:32] i
[54:33] have prayed for thee
[54:35] listen to that satan want you but i have
[54:38] prayed for you he desires to sit to his
[54:41] weak but i i'm gonna get to that simon
[54:43] in a minute but he said but i have
[54:46] prayed for thee but in spite the fact
[54:48] that the devil may have to be after
[54:50] tonight i have prayed for you in spite
[54:53] that the satan desires to sift you i
[54:56] have prayed for you for the fact that
[54:58] the devil would like to take you back in
[55:00] the world jesus said i have prayed for
[55:03] you and brother in the times the trials
[55:05] and testings of life when the battles
[55:07] are raging in your young heart you want
[55:10] to remember one thing there's somebody
[55:12] on your side
[55:14] and of god before you who can be against
[55:16] you but i'd rather have jesus praying
[55:19] for me than anybody i know
[55:22] because tonight he is at the right hand
[55:24] of the father
[55:26] the bible said he's ever living to make
[55:28] intercession upon the confessor of the
[55:30] saints there's somebody on our side
[55:32] hallelujah that's already got the keys
[55:35] of death hell in the grave i like what
[55:37] oh brother howard carroll said one time
[55:39] poor old devil don't even have the keys
[55:41] to his own house jesus has got those
[55:43] keys
[55:45] can you say praise the lord
[55:47] but i want to remember this simon
[55:50] simon
[55:51] i have prayed for you
[55:53] that your faith
[55:55] failed not
[55:56] now look at this when he refers to him
[55:59] assignment it's obvious
[56:01] that jesus has referred to the man
[56:03] before he had a revelation
[56:06] think about that he's talking to the man
[56:09] and what it is of satan like brother
[56:11] baptist says
[56:12] i'm going to say it to you young people
[56:13] tonight when you get there back to the
[56:15] holy ghost and god sealed you in the
[56:17] kingdom
[56:18] the devil can't unsave what god has
[56:20] saved
[56:22] the devil can't even unseal what god has
[56:24] sealed when god sealed you with the holy
[56:27] spirit you're sealed for all time and
[56:29] all of eternity but he can come after
[56:32] your flesh your flesh isn't converted
[56:35] your flesh ain't saved that's why you've
[56:37] got to confident the holy spirit and you
[56:39] take
[56:40] your body and throw it shut to the word
[56:43] of god brethren said satan's got one
[56:45] punch coming at every one of us tonight
[56:48] but when you get the holy ghost that's
[56:50] the keeping power that's the staying
[56:52] power that what keeps you anchored to
[56:54] christ
[56:56] so he says to simon satan has desired to
[56:59] have you
[57:00] that he may sip to his wheat and i'm
[57:02] going to finish that thought in a minute
[57:04] but stay here
[57:05] but
[57:07] no no no and
[57:09] when you are converted
[57:13] strengthen not if you are but when you
[57:16] are converted
[57:17] strengthened by
[57:20] brethren
[57:21] i'd like to take for just a few minutes
[57:23] tonight by the help of god
[57:26] while i have your undivided attention
[57:29] i'd like to speak on this
[57:31] being sifted
[57:34] in satan's eden
[57:37] being sifted
[57:39] satan seen it's amazing to me that when
[57:41] i look at the scripture all of the
[57:43] illustrations
[57:45] and the things that god could use to
[57:47] show this traumatizing experience this
[57:51] trial this test that you remember when
[57:54] you become a christian
[57:56] even if you got saved tonight and you go
[57:58] home and you boys had a dog and you got
[58:00] saved and you go home night the dog's
[58:02] gonna bark at you differently
[58:05] everything turns on you when you get
[58:07] saved like a boy told me one time say
[58:10] look i serve god if i could get rid of
[58:11] my friends i said oh no you deserve god
[58:14] they'll get rid of you
[58:18] you ain't got to get rid of nothing you
[58:20] just surrender god and it all take care
[58:22] of itself like people say oh if i could
[58:24] just do right i'd come and get saved if
[58:27] i could clean my life up and all come
[58:30] just like you are he's got enough power
[58:32] to change you lift you out of my
[58:35] set your feet on a rock change your life
[58:37] for the power of the holy spirit you
[58:39] ain't got to do nothing he'll do it all
[58:42] it will just surrender to him
[58:44] but think about it
[58:46] wheat
[58:47] he desires to sift you as wheat now
[58:50] wheat
[58:51] while it's growing endures a lot of
[58:54] storms out there in the field
[58:57] it endures a lot of fervent heat coming
[58:59] from the sun yes it does while it's
[59:02] growing and maturing it endures winds
[59:05] and weather and all kinds of different
[59:07] things the wheat has to go through over
[59:09] and over
[59:10] but only one time
[59:13] listen to me closely in that
[59:16] wheat's life
[59:18] is sifted
[59:21] there comes a time that that wheat
[59:24] will go through a lot of things but then
[59:26] there will come a time
[59:27] that that we will face what it feels
[59:30] like
[59:31] the greatest test the greatest trial
[59:34] and it wonders within itself how am i
[59:38] going to make it
[59:39] it's like the prophet we talked about
[59:42] job the
[59:43] statement he used was
[59:45] job was a renowned man then he said
[59:47] satan had desired to sift him and try
[59:52] him
[59:53] then brother batman said that all
[59:54] christians believers they're tried every
[59:57] son that cometh to god must be tried and
[1:00:01] chasing every son of god like job we
[1:00:04] face our storms hey we got different
[1:00:06] trials no question different temptation
[1:00:09] different cold times and hot times and a
[1:00:12] lot of winds and our ups and our downs
[1:00:14] and our pressures and we go through a
[1:00:16] lot of different things in our christian
[1:00:18] experience but every one of us will have
[1:00:21] to come a time that we face
[1:00:24] the sifter
[1:00:26] listen close because you're living
[1:00:30] now
[1:00:31] in satan's eden
[1:00:33] how many y'all's ever heard that message
[1:00:36] right you're not in god's eden
[1:00:38] you're in satan's eden
[1:00:41] satan in the beginning
[1:00:42] came down into god's eden and the
[1:00:44] prophet said beat adam to his wife
[1:00:47] they were fortified behind the walls of
[1:00:50] the word and the prophet said lucifer
[1:00:52] climbed under the walls of the word and
[1:00:54] vicariously through the serpent beat
[1:00:57] adam to his wife
[1:00:59] am i right
[1:01:01] then adam took her to himself and in her
[1:01:04] womb was two seeds
[1:01:06] adams and the serpent right and god's
[1:01:09] eden
[1:01:11] plunged the entire human race
[1:01:13] in the death and we fell because of
[1:01:16] adam's decision now for six thousand
[1:01:18] years satan has been making his own eden
[1:01:21] and the property god actually says satan
[1:01:23] has had a marvelous success in carrying
[1:01:26] out his threats to be god
[1:01:28] now
[1:01:29] we are living in satan's eden
[1:01:32] and let me tell you what happened
[1:01:35] when the serpent got to eve
[1:01:39] her womb was still open
[1:01:41] so adam was able to get his seed in
[1:01:43] there before that wound closed up
[1:01:48] now we're in satan's eden
[1:01:50] let me give you some consolation night
[1:01:53] god came down satan's heathen
[1:01:55] and he's beat satan to this bride
[1:01:59] and you know what he did he pregnanted
[1:02:00] you in this hour but brother bothered
[1:02:03] when he pregnanted us young people he
[1:02:05] doesn't leave your womb open for satan
[1:02:07] to get to you when he pregnant you he
[1:02:09] closes the womb up and seals you in
[1:02:11] there by the holy ghost so that satan
[1:02:13] can't never get to you glory to god when
[1:02:16] a man's born to god the bible said he
[1:02:18] does not commit sin that means he can't
[1:02:20] even disbelieve no more because that
[1:02:23] soul is sealing it with christ yeah
[1:02:25] there's going to come a lot of battles
[1:02:26] yes there's going to come a lot of trial
[1:02:28] yes there's going to come a lot of
[1:02:29] testing but i'm here tonight to tell you
[1:02:31] there's an anchor down that soul that
[1:02:34] sometime when you feel like you can't
[1:02:35] make it another day there's a tie post
[1:02:38] down there that'll hold you to christ
[1:02:40] thank god for the holy ghost
[1:02:46] and i've seen
[1:02:47] over the last few years
[1:02:50] some are not making it
[1:02:52] i'm not here to paint a bad picture but
[1:02:55] i just want to tell you
[1:02:56] friends close friends of mine preachers
[1:02:59] are dropping off like flies
[1:03:02] maybe oh how can i say it maybe we
[1:03:05] depend on our gift
[1:03:06] our ability to sing our ability to
[1:03:08] preach i ain't saved because i preach
[1:03:11] but i thank god i ain't going to heaven
[1:03:13] because the way i preach if i would i
[1:03:15] wouldn't get very far i'm going to
[1:03:17] heaven because somebody paid a price for
[1:03:19] me i'm going to heaven because somebody
[1:03:21] called me
[1:03:22] always somebody justified me somebody
[1:03:24] sanctified me somebody baptized me with
[1:03:27] the holy ghost and i'll tell you
[1:03:28] something else in the mind of god he's
[1:03:30] already glorified me
[1:03:34] but you realize
[1:03:36] without this
[1:03:38] conversion
[1:03:40] this tie post
[1:03:42] if you're depending on anything else to
[1:03:44] hold you
[1:03:46] you're not going to make it
[1:03:48] and i'm not here to tell you but i've
[1:03:50] seen
[1:03:51] people come down to that hour existing
[1:03:54] where they come down facing the greatest
[1:03:56] battle
[1:03:57] if that tide post ain't there
[1:04:00] drags them away
[1:04:01] they get over in that realm
[1:04:03] of reasoning and they start freezing oh
[1:04:06] brother look i can be more plainer they
[1:04:08] reason this message out they're trying
[1:04:10] to figure things out hey god didn't call
[1:04:13] me to figure this out god told me to
[1:04:15] believe this message god called you to
[1:04:17] believe this man i don't want to tell
[1:04:19] with that crowd you know maybe tomorrow
[1:04:20] night god willing i'm gonna preach a
[1:04:22] message on the web not not the internet
[1:04:25] but the web satan's web like a spider
[1:04:27] but there's so many caught up in that
[1:04:29] thing don't get ahead of myself but
[1:04:31] brother satan's got guns aimed at every
[1:04:34] one of you young people before i get in
[1:04:36] my whole subject i'm going to tell you
[1:04:38] somebody's prayed for you somebody's
[1:04:40] interceding for you somebody's watching
[1:04:42] over you it ain't luke gibson it ain't
[1:04:44] brother byler it ain't brother branham
[1:04:46] though i i have great respect for my
[1:04:48] prophet there's somebody greater than
[1:04:50] all of us watching over you and his
[1:04:52] name's jesus
[1:04:54] praise be to god
[1:05:00] some ain't making it but there is some
[1:05:03] that is allowing the pressure
[1:05:06] of the sifter to work on them
[1:05:09] and i see what you prayed a while ago
[1:05:12] some of the immaturities taken out of us
[1:05:14] i see some here's a word some of the
[1:05:16] green is starting to be faked out of us
[1:05:18] the sincerity and the
[1:05:20] sacredness and the attributes of the
[1:05:22] holy spirit and some of us are allowing
[1:05:25] ourselves to go through that scepter and
[1:05:27] just submit to the pressure of god and
[1:05:29] submit to the trial and all of a sudden
[1:05:31] you're starting to see some greenness go
[1:05:33] out listen now and some gold must come
[1:05:35] in
[1:05:37] some some golden
[1:05:39] ripe
[1:05:40] harvest wheat
[1:05:42] brother can't you hear the night by the
[1:05:44] ears of the holy ghost the combine out
[1:05:47] there coming he's coming to take this
[1:05:49] wheat home into the garner and in this
[1:05:52] meeting when it's done all i know is i
[1:05:54] want to be one step closer like enoch to
[1:05:57] the coming of the lord jesus when he
[1:05:59] comes i want to go with him
[1:06:02] now the scepter going through the
[1:06:04] scepter everybody tonight i want you
[1:06:06] young people be with me now the scepter
[1:06:08] say sifter
[1:06:10] the scepter going to the scepter is very
[1:06:13] hard
[1:06:14] let me give you a couple of things
[1:06:15] that's going to happen number one when
[1:06:18] you go through the scepter
[1:06:19] the pressure
[1:06:21] is going to get heavy
[1:06:25] it's going to get healthy
[1:06:27] it's not going to be like when you first
[1:06:29] got saved
[1:06:31] man you was the most happiest thing you
[1:06:34] there was
[1:06:36] you didn't think
[1:06:38] god he was unsaved
[1:06:40] you didn't see nobody's fault
[1:06:42] you served god a while you start
[1:06:45] maturing
[1:06:46] the pressure's coming on
[1:06:48] and satan's goal
[1:06:50] is what jesus said to make your faith
[1:06:53] fail
[1:06:55] the devil wanted peter's watch peter's
[1:06:58] faith to fail
[1:07:00] but jesus didn't say peter's faith would
[1:07:02] fail he said simon
[1:07:07] simon
[1:07:08] brother i don't care what the devil done
[1:07:11] he couldn't have never got peter
[1:07:13] you went after simon
[1:07:16] he'll go after your flesh
[1:07:18] because he can't touch your soul
[1:07:22] are y'all listen to me
[1:07:24] it's in this sister the wheat oh glory
[1:07:27] it's been so pressured
[1:07:29] that when god's gone it comes out like
[1:07:32] bread
[1:07:35] god allows this
[1:07:37] to take you as a wheat and when he's
[1:07:39] done he'll make himself a loaf of bread
[1:07:43] and he'll take your life and make you a
[1:07:45] blessing to others
[1:07:46] [Music]
[1:07:49] he'll use your life as a testimony to
[1:07:51] tell somebody like we're surrounded
[1:07:53] night by great calories i looked back to
[1:07:55] the old temp see them great calories i
[1:07:57] said if abraham could have faith for 25
[1:08:00] years surely i could have faith for some
[1:08:02] little kidney stone the devil attacked
[1:08:04] me with if that man could be 25 years
[1:08:06] surely i can believe 25 hours
[1:08:12] that's right
[1:08:13] i think about what shadrach meshach and
[1:08:16] abednego
[1:08:17] daniel all them old saints back there
[1:08:20] brother they weren't no different
[1:08:22] brother butler if you was back there
[1:08:24] your life could have possibly been one
[1:08:25] of the characters of the bible
[1:08:29] they wasn't like superheroes
[1:08:32] they were men and women would like
[1:08:34] passing just like we are
[1:08:36] but they had a faith in their heart
[1:08:38] they surrendered to god amen and he took
[1:08:41] their life and pinned it in there as
[1:08:43] examples to us
[1:08:44] if god would be with them god will be
[1:08:46] with us if god can take them through god
[1:08:49] can take us through if they can have
[1:08:51] faith we can have faith if they can walk
[1:08:53] in the lion's den and shut
[1:08:56] his mouth we can walk in the lines again
[1:08:58] if they can take shadrach meshach and
[1:09:00] abednego some in the fiery furnace and
[1:09:03] not even come out with a smell of smoke
[1:09:04] on him don't you think he's still jesus
[1:09:07] christ the safe yesterday today and
[1:09:09] forever
[1:09:10] [Music]
[1:09:12] sure he is it'd be good for them he can
[1:09:14] do it for us
[1:09:17] yes the pressure
[1:09:19] is going to get heavy on you
[1:09:21] during the sifting time
[1:09:24] listen now
[1:09:25] in those times some of you been there so
[1:09:27] you know what i'm talking about
[1:09:29] it's going to be hard to pray
[1:09:31] yes sir
[1:09:33] everything jesus says to peter he could
[1:09:35] have said to him he didn't say peter i'm
[1:09:38] standing with you
[1:09:39] i'm standing by you
[1:09:41] i'll be right there standing for you no
[1:09:43] he said i'll be praying for you
[1:09:46] because when you're going through the
[1:09:48] sifter
[1:09:49] the pressure mount so much seems like
[1:09:51] from above below left right everywhere
[1:09:54] just seem like everywhere you turn you
[1:09:56] find yourself on your face it's so
[1:09:59] you're so much pressure sometimes you
[1:10:01] can't already feel like you can even
[1:10:02] pray
[1:10:05] you feel like
[1:10:06] you need god more than ever but you
[1:10:08] can't find him
[1:10:10] it seemed like at times that you even
[1:10:13] uttered words but it didn't go beyond
[1:10:15] the ceiling
[1:10:16] until one prophet said the heavens
[1:10:18] become like brass
[1:10:23] matter of fact i'll say what brother man
[1:10:25] said
[1:10:25] god literally lays silent on you
[1:10:31] what's happening
[1:10:32] when you're going through that septic
[1:10:34] and you feel you can't get a prayer
[1:10:36] through
[1:10:37] don't you ever forget
[1:10:39] sitting at the right hand of the father
[1:10:41] if somebody get a prayer through for you
[1:10:43] and that's why i said peter
[1:10:45] i'll be praying for you
[1:10:48] what an encouragement number three let
[1:10:50] me give this to you now hurry
[1:10:52] the third thing is
[1:10:54] not only more pressure hard to pray
[1:10:57] but the process of sifting listen to me
[1:11:00] hurts
[1:11:03] don't ever let nobody tell you it don't
[1:11:05] hurt it hurts
[1:11:07] no one has ever faced the scepter but
[1:11:09] has to admit this hurts
[1:11:13] i talked to a man last night from south
[1:11:15] africa
[1:11:16] brother what he told me where his life
[1:11:19] is at
[1:11:20] i thought my god this man stood beside
[1:11:23] me traveled with me
[1:11:25] now as left as wife living with another
[1:11:27] woman
[1:11:28] walked away from the message you can't
[1:11:30] tell me that don't hurt
[1:11:35] there's times you face things that
[1:11:37] simply
[1:11:38] hurt i wonder tonight
[1:11:41] could i borrow that microphone if we
[1:11:43] could pull no don't turn it on just
[1:11:45] leave it off if you would
[1:11:46] it's just an illustration
[1:11:50] if we'd call the wheat
[1:11:52] and we'd ask that wheat just before
[1:11:54] it sifted
[1:11:56] we'd say that we come we testify tell us
[1:12:00] what it's like
[1:12:01] the first thing that little wheat would
[1:12:03] say
[1:12:04] oh
[1:12:05] they cut me down out of the field
[1:12:09] say i used to think i could stand tall
[1:12:12] now i'm flat on my back as if god is
[1:12:15] taking me down and i'm nothing
[1:12:18] they take me through this process they
[1:12:21] literally have beat me
[1:12:22] they beat me beyond recognition then i'm
[1:12:26] battered so that the shaft would just
[1:12:28] scatter away what they what they put me
[1:12:31] through i'm here scattered there and
[1:12:34] yonder i'm just tore to pieces and i'm
[1:12:36] shaking and i'm put through a grinder
[1:12:38] and then i put through a shift and all i
[1:12:40] can say is from beginning to end this
[1:12:43] all hurt me in a way and i never dreamed
[1:12:46] that serving god could hurt me
[1:12:51] and i would venture to say tonight
[1:12:53] some of you has not been there yet but i
[1:12:55] would like to say there are some here
[1:12:56] that can tell you i laid on my pillow
[1:12:58] until i feel my pillow with tears at
[1:13:00] night
[1:13:02] with what god has permitted me to go
[1:13:05] through the pressure got so heavy that i
[1:13:07] thought being dead would be better than
[1:13:09] being alive
[1:13:11] what's god doing to me
[1:13:13] he's allowing
[1:13:15] me to be sifted god
[1:13:17] uses that sifter
[1:13:19] oh my
[1:13:20] so that we are not only being blessed by
[1:13:23] god
[1:13:24] but that we become
[1:13:26] the blessing to others
[1:13:28] young man
[1:13:29] young lady tonight we'll tell you why
[1:13:32] god allows it
[1:13:34] number one listen to me
[1:13:36] i'm gonna read some things brother said
[1:13:38] but i gotta hurry
[1:13:39] he does it because
[1:13:41] he wants to shake your flesh
[1:13:44] he wants to shake
[1:13:46] your flesh when god permits you to go
[1:13:49] through the scepter that's what he did
[1:13:50] he was shaking peter's flesh
[1:13:54] simon got over there
[1:13:56] christ was crucified you know it come
[1:13:58] down to where it looked like the message
[1:14:00] has finally died
[1:14:03] nobody's got the victory
[1:14:06] they thought it was done this man who we
[1:14:08] thought would be the prophet the messiah
[1:14:10] he's dead he's gone
[1:14:13] look at this
[1:14:14] peter didn't go to fishing simon
[1:14:18] what did peter when jesus called him he
[1:14:20] gave him revelation peter is identified
[1:14:22] with the revelation of jesus's ministry
[1:14:24] simon is identified as the fisherman
[1:14:28] and when he got down to it and he was
[1:14:30] shook jesus told him before the cup
[1:14:34] grows you'll deny me three times thrice
[1:14:36] before the crows
[1:14:38] now you say what you want to i always
[1:14:41] thought about old john the baptist
[1:14:43] brother god have mercy got down in that
[1:14:46] prison only thing i know the prophet
[1:14:48] said was his eagle eye got filmed over
[1:14:50] and they come ask him you know are you
[1:14:52] him and then this they fight jesus
[1:14:54] messiah and then finally he got to his
[1:14:56] disciples said come here guys
[1:14:59] i'm down in this prison
[1:15:01] i know i introduced him i know i said
[1:15:04] he's the lamb of god but i want you to
[1:15:06] go down there and ask him
[1:15:09] are you him
[1:15:11] are you really him that what happened he
[1:15:13] got discouraged the prophet said
[1:15:15] now brother if it can happen to a
[1:15:16] prophet with a spiritual life surely it
[1:15:18] can happen to us
[1:15:20] watch this them two men ran down there
[1:15:23] he said he had a crowd he acknowledged
[1:15:25] those two men how can i help you said
[1:15:27] we're disciples of john he told us can
[1:15:29] you imagine that cro
[1:15:31] where disciples are done he told us to
[1:15:33] ask are you him or shall we look for
[1:15:35] another
[1:15:37] jesus said go back and tell john the
[1:15:39] blind see
[1:15:41] the depth here the dumb wraith the
[1:15:43] gospel is preached to the poor
[1:15:45] brothers and guys turned around took off
[1:15:47] running as fast as they can go got the
[1:15:49] top the hill just said hey
[1:15:51] wait a second let me tell you crowd
[1:15:53] something because he knew what they was
[1:15:55] thinking and he stopped and said and
[1:15:56] them two boys turned around and heard
[1:15:58] jesus say jesus they heard jesus say
[1:16:00] something like this and there ain't been
[1:16:02] one born among women greater than john
[1:16:04] the baptist but i can imagine he got
[1:16:06] down to the prison god and there john
[1:16:08] said come here guys tell me what did he
[1:16:10] say what did he say he said tell you
[1:16:12] that the dead's being raised the blind
[1:16:14] is seeing the depths here and the
[1:16:16] gospels happen and the poor having the
[1:16:18] gospel pray to them john said oh my
[1:16:21] oh my you can just tell the depression
[1:16:24] the happiness on hey but wait john
[1:16:26] there's one more thing he said what did
[1:16:28] he say he said to all that crowd there
[1:16:30] ain't a
[1:16:31] born man born among women greater than
[1:16:34] john the baptist or i can see that old
[1:16:37] beak beat itself said hey take me to the
[1:16:39] chopping box i'm ready to go now amen
[1:16:42] god come down there sent to me and jesus
[1:16:45] encouraged john the baptist in his
[1:16:47] discouragement and his doubting he still
[1:16:50] made a way for him
[1:16:52] the bible said when we disbelieve god
[1:16:54] abides faithful
[1:17:00] the sifter wants to shake our flesh let
[1:17:03] me tell you why watch
[1:17:05] bubbam said
[1:17:06] we don't need so much of
[1:17:09] dips in the spirit
[1:17:11] or spiritual waking we need a revival
[1:17:14] let's watch us let's revive what we got
[1:17:18] not spiritual awakening
[1:17:20] sometimes that's cause mixed multitudes
[1:17:23] but we need a revival that'll sift down
[1:17:28] that'll shake down and we'll cut all the
[1:17:30] things out
[1:17:31] like standing there by the seashore i
[1:17:33] was talking some brethren over in puerto
[1:17:34] rico a few weeks ago that when they seen
[1:17:36] the great sea and the great storm the
[1:17:38] waves were higher than this tabernacle
[1:17:40] and you know what
[1:17:41] it
[1:17:42] hasn't got one more drop of water in it
[1:17:44] and when it's perfectly calm
[1:17:47] but what does that churning and that
[1:17:48] jump and what does it mean it throws all
[1:17:51] the trash out upon the bank what the
[1:17:53] church listen close what the church
[1:17:55] needs is a revival that'll shake from
[1:17:58] all of its worldliness and all the
[1:18:00] things of the world and bring us back to
[1:18:02] purity and the wholeness of god in our
[1:18:04] hearts as believers and he says humanity
[1:18:07] why does god shake us down i'll tell you
[1:18:10] why he shakes us down so that you come
[1:18:12] the place you realize i can't make it
[1:18:14] without him i'm not living this on my
[1:18:16] own it's the power of christ that rest
[1:18:19] upon me brother the day you young people
[1:18:22] come to place you realize it's not you
[1:18:24] doing it but it's christ in you doing it
[1:18:26] when a boy told me they said but look i
[1:18:27] can't live for god i said you can't but
[1:18:30] he can you surrender your life to him
[1:18:32] let him come in christ will live the
[1:18:34] christian life through you
[1:18:36] you believe that same man
[1:18:38] now you say
[1:18:40] why why
[1:18:42] why would this why would this be the
[1:18:43] case why would
[1:18:45] simon be accepted now you remember these
[1:18:47] guys are men just like us
[1:18:49] what shocks me
[1:18:51] about seven verses prior
[1:18:53] to that
[1:18:55] uh jesus telling simon that he would be
[1:18:57] sifted like wheat
[1:19:00] do you know six verses prior to that
[1:19:02] seven verse prior that verse 24
[1:19:04] the bible said there was strife among
[1:19:06] the disciples
[1:19:08] you know what they were fussing about
[1:19:10] who would be the greatest
[1:19:12] you imagine that who would be the
[1:19:14] greatest
[1:19:16] in the kingdom i'll tell you what them
[1:19:17] boys needed they needed a revival of
[1:19:19] humility
[1:19:22] we're here to compare ourselves with
[1:19:23] each other
[1:19:24] we're here to compare ourselves to one
[1:19:26] person and that's christ
[1:19:29] look we don't justify ourselves because
[1:19:31] we think we're doing better than the
[1:19:33] next guy
[1:19:34] come on now listen to me
[1:19:37] no we're here to be mow the image of god
[1:19:41] when we start thinking highly of
[1:19:42] ourselves oh how sometimes it takes us
[1:19:45] years to understand that that's when god
[1:19:48] when we start thinking too high of
[1:19:49] ourselves god will allow that center to
[1:19:51] come just to show us that we are weak we
[1:19:54] are frail and that we're how
[1:19:56] insignificant we are in this big program
[1:19:59] of god god allows us to be sifted so
[1:20:01] that we're not
[1:20:02] exalted above measure
[1:20:06] i told our people in our church when you
[1:20:08] meet them
[1:20:10] denominational folk on your job don't
[1:20:12] put your nose up because you think you
[1:20:15] got more revelation than they got let me
[1:20:17] tell you something there go you but for
[1:20:18] the grace of god you wouldn't even see
[1:20:20] this mess if it wasn't for grace
[1:20:23] you young girls god bless you that you
[1:20:24] obey the word and have long hair you
[1:20:27] don't have to paint yourself up but when
[1:20:28] you go to school and you see that young
[1:20:30] lady dressing and looking at don't put
[1:20:32] your nose a patter just pray and say god
[1:20:35] one day that would have been me but you
[1:20:37] turned me around
[1:20:38] i wouldn't maybe some of you not wasn't
[1:20:40] raised in a home or a mom and see some
[1:20:42] of y'all are
[1:20:43] maybe never been there because you had a
[1:20:45] mom and dad that wouldn't let you do it
[1:20:48] it don't mean you didn't have the desire
[1:20:49] to do it it's that they kept that desire
[1:20:51] in place until god got a hold of you you
[1:20:54] can't tell me brother they can't tell me
[1:20:56] i wouldn't want to tell you i was raised
[1:20:57] in a preacher's home but i wouldn't tell
[1:20:59] you the stuff i was outdoing my cousin i
[1:21:01] wouldn't tell my children that after i
[1:21:03] didn't want to tell my daddy
[1:21:06] and i had no mama act like god talking
[1:21:08] to her all the time
[1:21:09] that frustrated the fire to me she gets
[1:21:11] you to confess and stuff making you
[1:21:13] think god done told her you know god
[1:21:15] didn't tell her
[1:21:17] yeah we had a friend come over one time
[1:21:19] his name was larry and we don't warn
[1:21:21] larry about mama mama's a spiritual
[1:21:24] woman but god ain't talking to her all
[1:21:25] the time don't you believe that stuff so
[1:21:28] david and i my brother we went out of
[1:21:29] the room larry was in there with mama
[1:21:32] mama got to talking to him we come back
[1:21:34] and larry's bawling like a baby that boy
[1:21:36] don't know nothing about god he don't
[1:21:38] know anything about the way we know had
[1:21:40] no clue about his crime we come and said
[1:21:42] what in the world you crying for your
[1:21:45] mama made me think god knew i was or she
[1:21:47] knew i got told her that i was smoking
[1:21:50] marijuana
[1:21:51] said my god man did you tell her yeah i
[1:21:54] told her everything
[1:21:57] i said son god did larry god didn't tell
[1:21:59] her
[1:22:01] nothing she tricked you into thinking
[1:22:03] god was talking to her
[1:22:09] but thank god for good parents
[1:22:11] but you know what having good parents
[1:22:13] and men raised in a christian home that
[1:22:15] don't automatically make us not have the
[1:22:16] desire for the things in the world
[1:22:17] brother bib said i could take billy paul
[1:22:19] joe take it out into it and that nature
[1:22:20] come out of them so here's what we got
[1:22:22] to remember that's god sent us put
[1:22:24] pressure shake our flesh that we don't
[1:22:26] ever think or have the attitude oh i
[1:22:28] stand because of who i am we don't stand
[1:22:31] nothing because of who we are we stand
[1:22:33] because
[1:22:34] him we're gonna make it by the grace of
[1:22:36] god we're saved by the grace of god
[1:22:38] we're going to live for god tomorrow
[1:22:40] because of his grace let me go a step
[1:22:41] further you're going to go into rapture
[1:22:43] because the grace of god the bible says
[1:22:45] when that heads don't come it comes with
[1:22:47] shoutings crying works works no faith
[1:22:50] fed no grace grace undead
[1:22:55] i'm saved by the grace of god
[1:22:57] you believe that same man
[1:23:00] god
[1:23:01] called him twice
[1:23:04] by his fleshly name simon
[1:23:08] to show him that his flesh
[1:23:10] would fail
[1:23:13] listen
[1:23:14] i said a minute ago
[1:23:16] he said are you him
[1:23:18] no i don't know nothing about him
[1:23:20] second time
[1:23:22] my speech betrayeth you you know how
[1:23:24] these young people these people go out
[1:23:26] the world and they were trying to act
[1:23:27] like the world and every time they open
[1:23:29] their mouth some little message term
[1:23:31] comes out
[1:23:32] by speech betrayaphy
[1:23:34] i can listen to preachers out here in
[1:23:35] radio land on television and tell you
[1:23:38] what tape they're listening to what book
[1:23:40] to read now because their speech betrays
[1:23:42] them
[1:23:44] act like they don't want our message but
[1:23:45] they sure like digging into it don't
[1:23:47] they they pull out what they want they
[1:23:49] know this is some good wheat this is
[1:23:51] some
[1:23:52] full seven course meal this is some
[1:23:55] bread that's been wheat that's been
[1:23:56] tried and tested and proven and
[1:23:58] vindicated
[1:24:02] god uses this scepter to show that we're
[1:24:04] nothing
[1:24:05] the power of his grace
[1:24:07] listen to this
[1:24:09] you'll never be stronger in god until
[1:24:11] you realize
[1:24:12] how weak you are
[1:24:15] i know that goes against the grain
[1:24:17] psychology and all that but remember
[1:24:18] there's perfect strength
[1:24:20] and perfect
[1:24:22] weakness
[1:24:24] simon was weak
[1:24:26] until he denied the lord listen this is
[1:24:28] powerful he denied the lord all of a
[1:24:30] sudden can you imagine when the cop
[1:24:31] crewed oh my
[1:24:34] he knew then
[1:24:35] what jesus said was true
[1:24:37] now watch simon went and picked up his
[1:24:40] fish and that went back to doing he's
[1:24:41] doing but did you know on resurrection
[1:24:44] morning
[1:24:45] mark the 16th chapter about seven verse
[1:24:48] jesus met two women
[1:24:50] he said go tell my disciples
[1:24:54] come on finish it don't tell my
[1:24:56] disciples and
[1:24:58] peter
[1:25:01] called him by that new name again
[1:25:03] you know can you imagine when they got
[1:25:05] back and the disciples come around said
[1:25:06] hey we've seen the lord we've seen the
[1:25:08] lord and something what did he say he
[1:25:11] said tell all of y'all and express to
[1:25:13] you peter he called your name and said
[1:25:15] tell you he's risen and he'll meet you
[1:25:17] down another godly glory like god
[1:25:20] something happened and peter you know
[1:25:21] what happened that revelation was still
[1:25:22] anchored down in his soul that's what
[1:25:25] satan could not touch
[1:25:29] glory to cut hey your flesh might fail
[1:25:32] but there's something down your soul is
[1:25:34] a tied post holding you to christ come
[1:25:36] on church when everything feel like it's
[1:25:38] shaking as a tide post down that soul
[1:25:40] that's what my man called your absolute
[1:25:42] it holds you to christ
[1:25:47] yes sir shakes your flesh
[1:25:52] shakes your flesh paul went through it i
[1:25:54] gotta i gotta go but he said this
[1:25:56] prayed i pray three god did let me god
[1:25:59] deliver me god take this thorn away no
[1:26:02] why you gonna leave it so he wouldn't be
[1:26:04] exalted above measure
[1:26:06] each one of you not got a trial in your
[1:26:08] flesh
[1:26:09] some of us got such a strong trial you
[1:26:11] don't even want to tell nobody
[1:26:12] there's men so old brother they laid on
[1:26:14] their dying beth 90 years old and fought
[1:26:17] the same trial all of their life
[1:26:20] they say what's the greatest time in
[1:26:22] your life
[1:26:23] right now why god's fixing delivering me
[1:26:25] from this trial that i've always had
[1:26:28] and set
[1:26:30] me free hey it didn't change that they
[1:26:32] were son of god they had their battles
[1:26:34] their battles hey when you're sealed in
[1:26:36] they ain't no battle that soul remembers
[1:26:38] when you're still in there the
[1:26:39] struggle's over in that soul that's what
[1:26:41] he said it's over down in there your
[1:26:42] struggle's in this flesh
[1:26:44] it ain't boring again
[1:26:46] the motions of sin are still in your
[1:26:47] flesh come on listen to him you ever
[1:26:49] notice a young person when you get
[1:26:51] called on god you don't go pick up new
[1:26:53] sins
[1:26:54] you don't go pick up new habits
[1:26:57] you go back to what you kind of used to
[1:26:58] do because those motions are still in
[1:27:01] your flesh
[1:27:02] the sin factory in the soul has been
[1:27:04] shut down there ain't no more sin being
[1:27:07] produced because you can't sin but the
[1:27:09] sins are still in the body because it's
[1:27:10] not converted brother one these mornings
[1:27:13] on that resurrection morning and that
[1:27:15] glorious morning god's gonna give us a
[1:27:17] body that's commendary with the light we
[1:27:19] already got we're gonna get a body that
[1:27:21] matches our soul
[1:27:24] man my soul is already in the glory of
[1:27:26] fight condition and it's gonna give me a
[1:27:28] blood the battle's gonna be over but
[1:27:30] until then he's going to shake my flesh
[1:27:33] so that i know it's not me that's doing
[1:27:35] it it's christ that's doing it
[1:27:38] oh praise the lord
[1:27:39] let me hurry hurry i got to hurry i got
[1:27:41] to go i know i said i got to be short
[1:27:44] i don't have a watch
[1:27:45] and if i was picking up don't pay no
[1:27:46] attention
[1:27:47] and i'm not gonna say i'm closing a
[1:27:49] hundred times if i do you holler pharaoh
[1:27:51] let my people go
[1:27:57] let me tell you what god does i gotta
[1:27:58] hurry seriously not only shakes our
[1:28:00] flesh listen to this young people
[1:28:03] god puts you through the scepter so that
[1:28:04] he can separate you from filth
[1:28:06] so he can separate you from everything
[1:28:08] that's not like christ
[1:28:11] the scepter is a filtering process don't
[1:28:13] get no further let me get to this
[1:28:16] the scepter is a strainer the scepter
[1:28:18] filters out the wheat
[1:28:19] that things from the wheat that are not
[1:28:22] even seen
[1:28:24] by the human eye
[1:28:26] over the middle east the women during
[1:28:28] the harvest time
[1:28:31] the harvest time was always during the
[1:28:32] breezing part of the year
[1:28:35] they would lay out on large sheets and
[1:28:36] they'd lay the
[1:28:37] weed on the sheets and then they would
[1:28:40] take something like a stiff broom and
[1:28:41] they would beat the wheat
[1:28:44] and as they beat the wheat they were
[1:28:45] breaking up the shaft and the stems and
[1:28:47] the leaves and everything off of the
[1:28:49] wheat
[1:28:51] and after this beating was over
[1:28:53] in the harvest time on the wednesday
[1:28:55] windy desert four women would get it on
[1:28:58] each side of the sheet listen to this
[1:29:00] and after they beat the wheat the four
[1:29:02] women would grab the corners
[1:29:04] and when the wind blows they throw the
[1:29:06] do like this to the sheet and blow the
[1:29:08] weed up
[1:29:10] and all the shaft and the thing that had
[1:29:12] no fruit on it would be blown away
[1:29:15] and the wheat would drop right back down
[1:29:17] in its place
[1:29:18] you know why
[1:29:20] it had fruit on it
[1:29:22] had weight to it when the wind blew the
[1:29:24] shaft was driven away
[1:29:26] and listen this and the wheat
[1:29:28] was put back back where it belongs
[1:29:31] you understand why we just don't need to
[1:29:33] have church
[1:29:34] we need to have the wind of god blow
[1:29:36] through here
[1:29:37] we need to have every service we need
[1:29:39] the holy ghost among us
[1:29:41] i don't mean man of facts or something i
[1:29:44] don't mean like you shout tonight
[1:29:45] tomorrow night you think you have to
[1:29:46] make yourself shout again i'm not
[1:29:48] talking about that i'm not just letting
[1:29:50] the holy ghost have his way
[1:29:52] [Music]
[1:29:53] i've seen enough of that stuff pentecost
[1:29:56] they shout when the music is going when
[1:29:57] it's done they quit shouting forget that
[1:29:59] nonsense brother i want to see a
[1:30:01] response to the word
[1:30:04] this i said wednesday night at my church
[1:30:06] that we don't have drums wish i didn't
[1:30:08] just don't have nobody know how to play
[1:30:09] them right that guy they told me i
[1:30:10] played him right i set him up and he
[1:30:11] started playing saying i'll get off of
[1:30:12] him you know how to play him right
[1:30:16] i want somebody just beat him but drums
[1:30:18] and piano you know what this is this
[1:30:20] ain't our music this is accompanying our
[1:30:23] music
[1:30:24] the music's in your heart
[1:30:26] where you sing and make melody to the
[1:30:28] lord
[1:30:29] this is all just accompaniment it ain't
[1:30:31] replacement
[1:30:33] come on now brother william don't get up
[1:30:36] here like a robot and get you to do no
[1:30:38] you enter into his gates with
[1:30:40] thanksgiving you come in here to the
[1:30:42] courts with praise there's something in
[1:30:44] your heart responding it'll bring the
[1:30:46] presence of the holy spirit he is that
[1:30:48] one about what god will do he'll drive
[1:30:50] everything that's not supposed to be
[1:30:52] part it'll drive the word we'll put you
[1:30:54] through a filter and drive away
[1:30:56] everything that's not like christ and
[1:30:58] put you back in your place
[1:31:02] oh with a god then the wheat
[1:31:04] hangs in there even in the shifting
[1:31:07] you know what happens these extreme
[1:31:09] measures some of the time that god takes
[1:31:12] gets us more pure like like i'm speaking
[1:31:13] may go the shad with me she's abednego
[1:31:15] put in the firefight and the bible said
[1:31:18] imagine this they were bound
[1:31:21] when were put in they were bound they
[1:31:23] said turn the heat up
[1:31:25] seven times hotter
[1:31:29] finally they said the servant came over
[1:31:31] and he looked in and said oh king
[1:31:34] did we not cast three men
[1:31:36] in the fire but there's
[1:31:39] four men
[1:31:40] and he didn't just say there's four men
[1:31:42] he said there's four men loose in the
[1:31:44] fire
[1:31:45] what's that tell me that god don't put
[1:31:47] us in the fire to bind us he puts in the
[1:31:49] fire to lose stuff to free us from
[1:31:52] everything that binds us and the prophet
[1:31:54] said they came out there without even
[1:31:56] smelling smoke on their clothes
[1:32:00] oh that god he wants to free us and whom
[1:32:03] the son has set free all that god is
[1:32:06] free indeed
[1:32:11] let me
[1:32:12] i almost said i'm on clothes
[1:32:15] you preach at home in long gory's church
[1:32:16] you say that you're in trouble
[1:32:18] i was preaching there a few months ago i
[1:32:20] said i'm gonna close everyone the
[1:32:21] musicians gotta come up said what were
[1:32:23] y'all doing
[1:32:24] brother homie said we're closing you
[1:32:25] just said you're closing i train them
[1:32:27] when the preacher said you're closing
[1:32:28] they get up on the platform it's done
[1:32:29] you're done he meant that i had to quit
[1:32:33] i preach at homers
[1:32:34] i don't say that
[1:32:36] it's not even in my notes
[1:32:39] i've trained myself not to say i'm
[1:32:41] closing
[1:32:43] amen
[1:32:45] listen to this
[1:32:48] strengthens your faith
[1:32:50] i'm done i'm almost done
[1:32:52] it strengthens your faith let me tell
[1:32:54] you why i know that
[1:32:55] because jesus says
[1:32:57] when you go through this peter
[1:32:59] and
[1:33:01] when
[1:33:02] thou art
[1:33:05] converted
[1:33:06] but you remember brother said he was
[1:33:07] already justified
[1:33:09] he even thought they were sanctified
[1:33:11] so this sifting that say that satan
[1:33:13] would put
[1:33:14] simon through
[1:33:16] would only push peter's faith
[1:33:18] on up to pentecost
[1:33:20] so we can get bored again
[1:33:22] so we can get converted now look i'm not
[1:33:24] an auto mechanic i got a boy one of my
[1:33:26] boys
[1:33:27] is a he works for the ford motor company
[1:33:30] i don't know nothing about cars you know
[1:33:32] how much i know about cars
[1:33:33] when i was 70 years old i'm gonna tell
[1:33:35] y'all sunday when i was about 16 seven
[1:33:37] years old i was full-time preaching
[1:33:39] preached all up in kentucky you know
[1:33:40] down through georgia south carolina
[1:33:42] florida british all over the place
[1:33:43] sixteen seven years old and i had no ltd
[1:33:46] you know you wouldn't really call
[1:33:47] degrees until you drove a big car and i
[1:33:49] had a big car
[1:33:51] and that car started knocking on me
[1:33:54] and i pulled into waldorf florida sam
[1:33:56] davis pulled into his place i said sam
[1:33:59] my car's about on its last leg what's
[1:34:00] wrong with it i said the engine's
[1:34:02] knocking he said hold on son that's kind
[1:34:04] of preacher's eyes around hold on son
[1:34:06] and he went down and got me some oil
[1:34:09] olive oil a couple bottles of olive oil
[1:34:12] i thought what in the world's he doing
[1:34:14] he raised that hood up
[1:34:16] brother he raised that hook took about
[1:34:19] three bottles of olive oil and poured
[1:34:20] into my oil so that car is gonna be all
[1:34:23] right it's healed in jesus name
[1:34:25] hey
[1:34:26] you think i'm kidding i got in that car
[1:34:28] and just trusted god went down the road
[1:34:30] the knock and stuff and i drove that car
[1:34:32] until i couldn't drive it no more hey
[1:34:34] he's still the same that's about as much
[1:34:36] as i know about engines i just know
[1:34:39] enough that he can heal an engine he can
[1:34:41] heal my body hey man if he can heal an
[1:34:43] engine he can he can he'll cancer if he
[1:34:45] can heal an engine he can do anything
[1:34:47] that's the god we serve
[1:34:50] he's a mighty big god tonight
[1:34:53] finally watch what happens now really i
[1:34:56] said that but i don't know nothing so
[1:34:58] some of you guys are mechanic i hope i'm
[1:34:59] saying this right but i looked it up
[1:35:01] this is what they say
[1:35:03] an automatic transmission
[1:35:05] they have what they call a torque
[1:35:06] converter anybody hear a mechanic
[1:35:09] nobody praise god you won't know if i'm
[1:35:10] telling the truth then
[1:35:12] i've got to do
[1:35:15] this is right i'm telling you that's
[1:35:16] right now that torque converter has got
[1:35:18] three functions
[1:35:20] but one of the main purposes of it is to
[1:35:22] convert power
[1:35:25] listen the converter transfers the power
[1:35:28] from the engine to the transmission
[1:35:30] input shaft
[1:35:32] plus it multiplies the engine torque
[1:35:34] output
[1:35:36] now you may not that may not mean
[1:35:37] nothing but listen to me closely the
[1:35:39] transmission has no power within itself
[1:35:43] but the main drive does
[1:35:45] the motor is where the horsepower is and
[1:35:48] there's so much power in the motor
[1:35:50] to the input of the transmission if you
[1:35:52] hook the transmission to the power of
[1:35:54] the motor blood the pieces
[1:35:57] but then there's the torque converter
[1:36:00] and what that converter is takes the
[1:36:02] power of the engine
[1:36:04] that motor and transmits it in a way
[1:36:06] that doesn't blow the transmission up
[1:36:08] but builds it up
[1:36:10] where it can push it down the road
[1:36:13] listen to this but without the converter
[1:36:16] it's impossible to transfer the main
[1:36:17] power the source to the transmission
[1:36:20] that converter says i can handle taking
[1:36:23] the power from the motor put it into the
[1:36:25] treadmill in such a way so they can give
[1:36:26] it more power than it's ever dreamed of
[1:36:29] you say what's that mean that means this
[1:36:31] that god cannot hook you up in your
[1:36:33] condition right now directly to him and
[1:36:35] blow you to pieces but when he brings
[1:36:37] that converter in then that conversion
[1:36:40] comes and he takes his power puts it
[1:36:42] into you and it pushes you down the road
[1:36:44] amen instead of you holding that power
[1:36:46] it puts it out of you and does something
[1:36:48] for christ
[1:36:51] thank god for conversion
[1:36:53] thank god for the holy ghost
[1:36:55] you say power yes in acts chapter one
[1:36:58] when the disciples got together after
[1:37:00] jesus resurrection they said well you at
[1:37:02] this time he said hey wait wait it's not
[1:37:03] giving you no the time of the season
[1:37:06] with the father putting his own power
[1:37:07] that's his own authority but you shall
[1:37:09] receive power after that the holy ghost
[1:37:12] has come upon you he said go do some
[1:37:14] wait until you being new with power from
[1:37:16] on high you look up that word power you
[1:37:18] know what it means it's the word dunamis
[1:37:20] it's where we get the word dynamite
[1:37:23] but when god gives you the holy ghost
[1:37:25] you might be just like little david but
[1:37:27] god put a stick of dynamite in you
[1:37:29] lord of god when he lights you up you
[1:37:31] blow the devil's kingdom to pieces it
[1:37:33] don't blow you up it builds you up in
[1:37:35] christ it makes you strong in christ but
[1:37:38] it gives you power over the devil hey
[1:37:40] gives you power over the world i say
[1:37:43] like brother brown gives you power to
[1:37:44] live right gives you power to walk right
[1:37:47] get your pot gives you sisters power to
[1:37:48] dress right gives you boys power to live
[1:37:51] right do right talk right confess right
[1:37:57] that's what this converter does
[1:38:01] you love him saying man
[1:38:03] sometimes
[1:38:05] you know there's a song
[1:38:07] there's a guy by the name of
[1:38:09] that well they call him fn lehman but
[1:38:10] his name was frederick lehman
[1:38:13] 1917
[1:38:15] lehman wrote a
[1:38:17] song i only had two stanzas two verses
[1:38:20] but back in those days the song was
[1:38:22] considered you know that was considered
[1:38:24] william was considered incomplete if
[1:38:25] they had three stanzas they wouldn't
[1:38:27] copyright unless i had three verses to
[1:38:29] it no lehman wrote a verse two verses
[1:38:32] told his family he wrote a verse but
[1:38:34] they even got so full of spirit of god
[1:38:36] 1970s they didn't his family thought he
[1:38:39] was crazy
[1:38:40] all they do is sing and worship and talk
[1:38:42] about god when they go out on the
[1:38:44] streets he'd be telling by about christ
[1:38:46] it got so bad
[1:38:47] that his own wife
[1:38:49] committed him to a mental institution
[1:38:52] he spent the last eight or ten years
[1:38:55] of his life
[1:38:56] and 8 by 10
[1:38:58] sale
[1:39:00] and you would have thought
[1:39:02] that if anything could have took god
[1:39:03] away from him that would have done it
[1:39:05] but i'd like to tell you this quickly
[1:39:08] oh paul
[1:39:10] spent most of his life in a prison my
[1:39:12] brother i like my office
[1:39:14] i like air conditioning i told myself i
[1:39:16] could have never been the prophet to the
[1:39:18] age because he wouldn't have found me in
[1:39:19] no cave he'd had to come to the holiday
[1:39:22] and express
[1:39:23] amen fired me
[1:39:25] come on let's be honest i'm just not

[1:40:54] in the years that he spent in that eight
[1:40:55] by ten cell
[1:40:58] they thought he was gone
[1:41:00] nobody come and visit him the nurse that
[1:41:02] looked after him finally when he died
[1:41:04] called one of his granddaughters and

[1:41:15] come and
[1:41:16] she went in there and it took her in
[1:41:18] that little 8-10 cell
[1:41:20] and brother
[1:41:22] bother they pulled his car back
[1:41:25] when they pulled his cop back
[1:41:27] their inscribed was the third verse to
[1:41:29] that song
[1:41:31] became copyrighted it's in your song
[1:41:33] book right there
[1:41:34] and that verse reads something like this
[1:41:37] could we with ink
[1:41:39] the ocean field
[1:41:41] and where the skies a parchment made
[1:41:44] where every stock on earth acquired and
[1:41:47] every man ascribed by trade
[1:41:49] to write the love of god above
[1:41:52] would drain the oceans dry nor could the
[1:41:54] scroll contain the whole those stretched
[1:41:56] from sky to sky oh the love of god
[1:41:59] how rich and pure
[1:42:01] how measurous and strong it shall
[1:42:03] forevermore endure the saints and angels
[1:42:07] song
[1:42:08] brother when they thought he was broke
[1:42:09] down there was a tie post in that soul
[1:42:12] brother said satan got his mind but he
[1:42:14] couldn't touch his soul
[1:42:17] see sometimes god breaks us down and
[1:42:20] it's through the scepter
[1:42:22] that god
[1:42:23] strengthens
[1:42:25] our faith
[1:42:26] let me close on this one tonight as our
[1:42:29] musicians are coming
[1:42:32] when you go to the sifter
[1:42:35] i wasn't kidding i'm closing musicians
[1:42:36] come please
[1:42:39] be like homer's church now
[1:42:43] you know what you're going to find out
[1:42:45] in those times listen to me young people
[1:42:48] i'll put you through the center you're
[1:42:49] going to find out who your friends are
[1:42:54] you know as well as i do nobody knew
[1:42:56] peter like jesus
[1:42:59] he spoke to peter three times
[1:43:02] peter finally said
[1:43:04] lord i'll go with you both to prison to
[1:43:06] death he said peter the shall crow
[1:43:09] not grow this day before thou hast
[1:43:11] thrice denied me
[1:43:13] thou knowest me
[1:43:16] jesus knew simon would betray him
[1:43:19] or deny him
[1:43:22] he said i'll go fishing i'll forget it
[1:43:24] all
[1:43:25] but jesus says but
[1:43:28] i like it but
[1:43:30] i have prayed for thee
[1:43:32] the bible says that we were in our sins
[1:43:34] and trespasses
[1:43:36] away from god couldn't make it
[1:43:39] and ephesians 2 verse 5 says 4 says but
[1:43:43] god who's rich in mercy
[1:43:47] brother when you say that little word
[1:43:48] but it means everything's changing
[1:43:50] like in revelation 10 when the mighty
[1:43:52] angel come down 700 and they said write
[1:43:54] it not see i'll do it not it was sealed
[1:43:56] up
[1:43:57] verse 7 says
[1:43:58] but
[1:43:59] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:44:01] angel when he begins to sound it means a
[1:44:04] changing
[1:44:06] but i prayed for thee let me tell you
[1:44:08] something
[1:44:09] when you go through the sifter you have
[1:44:11] a friend
[1:44:12] who sticks closer to you than a brother
[1:44:16] and his name is jesus
[1:44:21] you know what friend is
[1:44:22] a friend is someone
[1:44:25] who stands by you
[1:44:27] when he or she has every right not to
[1:44:31] god has every right to turn away from us
[1:44:34] he doesn't
[1:44:37] but if you would just get a song ready i
[1:44:39] want to i want to tell this and then i
[1:44:41] want us to pray
[1:44:44] have you ever heard anybody
[1:44:46] come to you and say
[1:44:47] hey
[1:44:48] i

[1:45:05] until

[1:45:08] process
[1:45:10] and all of a sudden nobody wants wheat
[1:45:13] raw
[1:45:14] but everybody loves a loaf of bread
[1:45:19] what's the point
[1:45:20] god put you through the process
[1:45:22] put you through the fiery trial
[1:45:25] but when he brings you out
[1:45:27] you don't bring out a weed he brings out
