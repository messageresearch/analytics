than just one but amen praise the lord anyway good to see brian feeling a little better i guess you know all right amen we're glad that he's doing better amen praise the lord so god bless you tonight amen that's power ahead well we prayed already and we yeah here we go i'm really struggling tonight all right praise the lord uh turn your bibles if you will and we'll go to the book of uh over in the book of jude you know i've been talking about the power of light and the power of darkness right amen and that's the only two powers there is according to the prophet of god there's only two powers in this world you're you are powered by one of those your strength comes from one of those amen either the power of the holy ghost or an empty heart is that right that where there is no holy ghost power amen and then all you have is uh your physical power or the devil's power or the power of hate isn't that right amen and so we know that the initial and one of the most main things about uh powers of the evil one is hate and jealousy and so forth amen and the other one is of course love and grace and forgiveness amen amen now we want to look we want to look with the help of the lord those who are and to be honest with you we're going to dwell quite a bit on it and it's going to be on the negative tonight it's going to be on the part of those who are powered and governed by the wrong power which is satan's power amen we want to look tonight at the destination of them for just a minute their destination and so forth and and i like i said i haven't got i may say some things concerning the destination of those who are powered by god but i don't know we'll just see how much time we have and go from there but in jude in jude this is the thought in the scripture that come to me and i meant to read it sunday so this is kind of a continuation off of sunday amen but i will title this the day of vengeance of our lord amen the day of vengeance of our lord amen let's read jude the first chapter and we'll read i guess the first six verses and then i happened to run across another scripture that was very similar to that so we'll read it and you'll notice this is the epistle of jude and we'll see how close jude was to peter when peter talked about the same thing okay jude 1 jude the servant of jesus christ the brother of james to them that are sanctified by god the father and preserved in jesus christ and call mercy unto you in peace and love be multiplied i know he's talking to the elect right the sanctified amen mercy peace and love be multiplied i like that don't you that just plumbs make me feel good to think that you may have mercy how many glad for the mercy of god amen the peace of god the love of god and then multiply it amen i'm glad that it's not just so much but it can be multiplied amen you can get more of i like that praise be to god that's who you like beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints amen wow when you think about the kind of faith that they had right amen peter just walking by perceiving that he had faith in hill i perceive that thou art feared to be healed he says in the name of jesus christ civil and silver and gold have i not but such as i have i give unto you and then the jesus name rise up and walk they rose up and walked leap for joy went into the temple and praising god that's the kind of faith they originally had for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordean to this condemnation now how many knows the church first church had problems with people coming in and twisting things up and messing things up they sure did and then that is just exactly what the devil always does yeah you'll get to see the in a minute just hang on there amen ungodly man turning the grace of our lord into the lasciviousness and denying the only lord god in our lord jesus christ i will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how that the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt afterward destroyed them that believed not in the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he had reserved in everlasting chains remember we're talking about darkness now those who served ark just end up here right he has reserved them notice how in the first chapter he says preserved the saints are preserved in jesus christ these are reserved in everlasting chains under darkness amen unto the judgment of the great day even as sodom and gomorrah and the cities about them and like manna giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth for an example suffering the vengeance of the eternal fire have this begotten to reading of the words you can be seated amen when i read this scripture even suddenly when i read the scriptures that they are reserved and kept in under everlasting chains of darkness amen now we know that to live a life of this darkness is a depressed life it's a terrible place to be to be without god amen to be without the holy ghost to be without peace how many know this is a neurotic age this is a nervous age that we're living in people are nervous you know how many times i listen to the prophet and and people he always says now you're nervous you know all these people that come through they're nervous everybody's nervous you know and there's a lot of reasons why we can be nervous but for one thing it's perhaps something in our conscience a lot of times something lays back in our life just out of the other amen and it's a it's a discomfort to be nervous i don't like to be nervous to you amen but it is something that god has caused this actually almost like a thirst to give us a warning to make us want to draw closer to god all right let's start here and so i thought about under the chains if they're kept there they're under and they can't never get out of that state i don't know about you but whenever you're not if you're nervous if you're upset whatever it might be if you get a little away from god aren't you glad that you're not chained to that you can actually get away from it y'all keep staying your seats don't run up around there you know i don't know about you i'm really glad that we can we can go before the lord amen and you can come out of whatever you want to come out of because these guys are never coming out of it they're stuck there they're never going to come out of it amen first of all let me just say i i like i like the number two i like to preach about the number two two things everything's in twos two hours there's only two powers right and jesus said there's only two masters right only two masters he says you'll either serve one or the other let me say this the one is of course i like i like one better huh i like one better because you don't want to be mixed up and confused about serving two masters just serve one master right that simplifies things now right then if you serve god you ain't got to worry about the devil and all his problems but now the other problem is if you serve the other master the other master you know the the the thing that he does that's so tricky is that he has people that's actually serving him and yet they think they're serving the other master and the prophet saying one of his later sermons he says millions and billions you know are actually serving the devil thinking they're serving god because the devil deceives the whole world the bible says you know he's a very he's a deceiver am right amen so two masters there's two powers amen and there's only two choices a person can make when i think about this every young man every young woman every person every boy and girl every man every woman anybody that's ever born into this world let me tell you something you are born between a rock and a hard place huh you you're you're really born in a fix you really are every human being you are born in a fix because first of all god created you to be a human being and with that being a human being you have the power to reason to think to make choices huh and with the fact that you're a human being comes a huge responsibility huh because of the fact that you have a soul right and that soul is gonna end up somewhere huh and another two that i like is there's either heaven or hell god has no purgatory right there's no somewhere else even though human beings and americans and our politicians and our school teachers and our college professors might try to teach you different do you think that when you die that's gonna be it just because you believe that's gonna be it no of course not you know the only way that you'll get anything accurate and know for sure is this right here this here don't care what you believe you have to believe this or you're wrong period amen what i really like about it is the fact that god came in our generation and he showed us without question that he's real huh we don't have to wonder anymore if god is real because he came and he had his picture taken with his prophet i mean god had his picture taken with the prophet would you like to see it there it is right there that's right you all know the story and i'm not going to get into it but god actually took his own even even if the fbi and and and uh i don't know just the the the one that inspects things like that and checks things out he says it's the only supernatural picture that was ever taken right he even verified it which i don't care if he did or not it's i still believe it folks there's people that spoke against that and died and got terrible things happened to him there's people that says i believe that and got healed right away huh so a responsibility i like this because you have to make a choice now when i think about this the choice that you make determines your destination where are you going to come out at and in this world you have to make that choice that's why i say a rock and a heart base is because you absolutely have to make that choice you can actually choose not to choose and you chose that's right if you choose not to choose and ignore it you chose to ignore it and you made the wrong choice and you'll end up in hell so you see how it is how sincere how yes sincere it is that you can't just not choose and not end up somewhere in between no you're going to end up somewhere and if you think you're not going to make a choice you're making a choice and ultimately if you don't choose christ you're choosing not to choose christ isn't that right and that is your choice so there is no getting out of it let me just read it to the way that the prophet said it in respects he says you can only do two things and it lays either mercy or judgment right you have to accept one or the other and there's where we stand tonight we either take god's mercy or we stand his judgment there's just no way of getting around it amen absolutely no way to get around it god always oh this is the good part god makes a way of escape for those who desire escape and then if you don't take that escape route you're going to be caught in the judgment that's coming now i believe the prophet taught us he says that the number one way that you can know that judgment is on its way is when god sends a prophet because god always there's every single time after prophet comes judgments follows it because people make their choice about what that prophet said amen they make their choice about what that prophet said and you have to you have to choose god's mercy and his grace or you have to stand his judgment amen stand the wrath that comes with there is no way of escape man don't you just wish everybody up in our white house would hear that tonight you will not escape you think you might but the day will come when you will absolutely have to face it huh god raised a prophet right out of the united states of america possibly the greatest prophet ever lived hello possibly the greatest ever because he got to go for 30 some odd years go around the world and around the world seven times i believe it was and preach the gospel and demonstrate the power of god like no other time because i don't know any time i i don't really don't know any time that a prophet went you all universal like that all over the world that many times to prove to the world god's real on your tapes that's right and all of our leaders and everybody those tapes will be played back on the day of judgment because brother bam says this message these messages will meet this generation into judgment because it wasn't the power of brother madam to do nothing amen i thought the other day i thought how nice it would have been to be able to be there and listen or record jesus talking about the wolf with the woman at the well and saying you're sad right y'all have that no uh you've got no husband because you've had five no one you're without eight do you deserve their thoughts and i actually have that in record wouldn't be glad to say you see that but yet we've got that very same thing in recordings time and time and time and time and time and again amen very same thing my my my oh my for the people that desirable ways what's left over has to stand in other words if you don't choose his grace and his mercy him dying on the cross for you and and paying for your sins if you don't choose freedom if you don't choose to be free from that if you don't choose to have realize that your sin was paid right there and when you accept him your sin everything you've ever done it gets paid for isn't it nice in other words he picked up the tab he died for the sins of the whole world everything from cain all the way to the last sin that had ever sinned he paid for every bit of it let me believe that amen and if you don't accept the payment then he's going to ask for you to pay for your sin because you have to pay for your sin sin has to be paid for not not even the smallest little bitty bitty bitty sin that anybody in the history of the world ever will go unpaid god's not going to miss any of it huh because what was it jesus said he said there's the things that are done in darkness will be brought the light there's nothing here that will not be revealed absolutely nothing because he's god amen so i'm happy tonight brother aren't you happy to know that christ has come and done the work in your life me tell you something that peace that you feel in your heart the joy that you have that feeling that knowing that you're right with god that's priceless there's nothing like it in the world i would rather be like job sitting on the ash eating boils and miserable miserable wishing i could die and still have that feeling than to be the king of the world and have all pleasures of the world at my disposal and not be right with god i would rather be that wouldn't you can and be right with god all right let's read now notice if you'll notice when it comes to judgment notice how that god's not forgetting anything all right here in the new testament it goes all the way back to i will put you in remembrance huh i remember over revelations remember i have remembered her iniquities i remembered her sins and i have come to pay i mean those vengeance is mine says the lord i will repay hear the bible's remembering the israelites having escaped save the people out of land of egypt afterwards destroyed them that believed not so now notice how many know that those people are kept in store then he goes from there to the angels which kept not their first estate even the angels am i right they're kept in store god has reserved them they're under the chains of darkness they're in a lost condition somewhere reserved for judgment day [Music] my oh my folks and then it mentions even as sodom and gomorrah how many no no folks the sodomites and the gomorrahites they were not forgiven or it wouldn't be in there just like abraham and his faults aren't found in the new testament huh but even sodom and gomor there remember there's nobody going to escape amen and it even talks about michael the archangel having respect when he's contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses burst not bringing against him any railing accusation but said the lord rebuked big amen angels watched your mouth when speaking to the devil did i read it wrong michael the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses semi-railing accusation but she said lord rebuke you huh but these speak evil of things they know not in other words you read the rest of it i'm not going to go through all of that but it talks about man people are so quick to run their mouths huh you got to be careful about what you say about god god knows who god sends about god's children amen because they're there's a recompense for it amen there's a recompense for everything that you do it even mentions in verse 11 of jude woe unto them for they have gone after the way of all the way back to cain is even mentioned here there's cain's not forgotten cocaine is under that bond of darkness waiting for his judgment i mean how's that he's waiting for his judgment he's been waiting there for six thousand years all right and then he talked greedily after the heir of balaam huh perished in the game saying of kara when i was even kora and all of them were swallowed up in the earth sure their bodies are dead but their souls are somewhere bound they're somewhere waiting for the judgment because why they made the wrong choice they made the wrong korah made the wrong choice cain made the wrong choice amen and before i go back to peter and come in paralleling what he said let's go to verse 14 of jude well let's go to verse 13 raging waves of the siege foaming out their own shame wandering stars to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever my that is a terrible place to be i believe probably god says you can't imagine how bad hell is how bad it is you can't even imagine it one place he says a literal burning fire would be a pleasure comparative what it really is like it's horrible it's terrible place remember when he went there when he wasn't saved and he got any and he was dying and so forth he went beyond the curtain he was falling and falling and falling and falling it was a terrible moment there's no mom that no dad god he said he yelled god there was no god there was no hope going huh that's right he said he's been to both places he says whatever you do don't you take that downward road amen because there he said he's been at the other place and he says there is no words to describe how beautiful it is amen even paul said i has not seen ear heard amen the things that god has prepared for them to love it amen we can't even imagine you uh i like that song you can only imagine i can only imagine i like to imagine amen amen beautiful because everything here is just a negative isn't it remember this let's remember this here and out there that this is only a well there's so many different words to describe what this world is really like but you got about 70 years where god tests you tries you improves you and molds you and shapes you and teaches you and sends you to school and all the things that he does to get you ready for what's over there that's all this is here just a temporary place amen why in the world would we want to make the right choice why wouldn't people choose god and eternal life amen let's go to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever and enoch hello and i mentioned enoch all the way in genesis also the seventh from adam prophesied of these sayings behold the lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints to execute judgment upon all not just some not the not the slightest person will be missing on that day amen to bring execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly hello driven by that dark force among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed and of all their big fat mouths hard speeches isn't that what we're experiencing today people that are just against god will just say anything against god they're not afraid to say anything they're hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him and of course it says these are murmurs and complainers and walking after their own lusts and their mouths speaking great swelling words having men's admiration in person and that you know because of an advantage amen all right now let's look at peter and how he put it in ii peter 2 if you want to go with me we'll see how that peter they must have had pretty close to the same revelation revelation we'll go down to verse 11 i mean some of these words are just so close to the others it's something else let's begin with verse 1. but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privately shall bring in them the heresies even denying the lord that brought that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction and many shall follow their pernicious ways by reason of whom the way of the truth shall be evil spoken of and through covetousness shall withday with framed words is that right make merchandise of you whose judgment now for a long time lingereth not and their damnation slumbereth not for if god spared not the angels that sinned amen but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness jude said chains under darkness peter said chains of darkness trapped there can't get out held by chain of circumstance amen to be reserved unto judgment amen do you see the destination of the ungodly that's their destination when they leave this world to be in a condition that they cannot get out of anybody that listens to the catholic priests and has your grandpa pay a million dollars to pray you out of purgatory well i'm sorry but it isn't going to work you're going to be stuck there if you're not with god amen ain't enough money in the world to ever get you out of there amen how many knows the prophet of god believed in purgatory i believe in purgatory but it's here right now because purging cleansing right get right that's our time now this is burger this is the time to get purged purge from your old sense amen because when you take that last breath it's not over there anymore amen to be reserved unto judgment and spare not the old world talking about the days of noah isn't that right but saved noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly how many know that every last one of those folks that died in the flood they're all reserved in chains of darkness they're still waiting there we understand that it's all the way from cain all the way from the person that died three minutes ago that went to the region of lost they're under chains of darkness amen they're not dead they're alive over there amen in a lost world that's right then he talks about turning the cities of sodom and gomorrah into ashes right condemn them with an overthrow making them an example unto those that afterwards should live ungodly hello world sodom and gomorrah that's right god overthrew them made you and made an example and you have to close your ear you have to turn your head and and ignore the example that god gives just to end up being in a place where they are and saying i should have listened amen but delivered just lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked verse 9 the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations amen aren't you glad for that and to reserve the unjust how to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished [Music] my my my you ask me why i'm happy because my sins are gone they're underneath the blood on the cross of calvary this fire removed this darkness is from dawn aren't you glad that there's no condemnation to them that are in christ there's no judgment to those that are in christ jesus the bible said don't you know that the saint shall judge the world amen and he comes with ten thousands of his saints to execute judgment upon all amen so we see brother insisted the destination the destination of course ends up in the white throne judgment how many knows that after the thousand years are expired according to revelations there after a thousand years even for another thousand years it's been 2000 years uh even since the time of christ since cain has supposedly been around 6 000 years so they're going to have to wait a very very long time before their judgment every becomes amen now let's talk about the day of the lord being the day of vengeance now we know that whenever the holy spirit lifts the bride amen up off the church i mean up off the earth when we'll be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump the trump of god shall sound the dead in christ shall rise first and we which are our lives and remain shall be caught up to meet the lord in the air but that coming of the lord and that coming of the lord is as a thief in the night the thief in the night comes and he goes and you don't know till morning until you know that you've been broken into have been robbed he's done come and gone that's how it's going to be for this world for the coming of the rapture coming of the lord now when he comes back with his saints it's going to be a different story it comes upon white horses under the sixth seal to the battle of armageddon and we come down there and destroy the place and take over amen that'll be the ultimate end amen the ultimate end but it's also how many knows the tribulation trade is also called judgment day the day of judgment it's also called the day of vengeance according to isaiah 61 i believe it is amen to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god amen two things and we're living the day right at the edge of the day of the vengeance of god amen folks i'm here to tell you the world does not realize what it has in store for them remember our prophet saw this vision and he said this about he says before us lays the most horrible time for the unbeliever the most horrible time and i want to read it to you but the scripture talks about how that when they'll realize and have to admit that god is no matter how much eight years they are they're gonna realize that they're facing god and it's going to do something to their hearts huh because i'm here today this earth is going to shake it's going to we enjoy having a good solid floor don't we but folks when we're going here this whole world is going to shake amen because when like like i said when that when that blood of jesus christ leaves and there's a ring from what i understand the prophet said there's a ring a circling the earth called the blood of jesus christ isn't that right and this is called man's day man's day is the day when you get to choose which way you're going to go this is man's day as the prophet of god said man's day is when when people will man will do whatever they kind of want to with you they'll push you around and so forth the prophet said and the bible talks about it he says you know he says don't be afraid of them that can kill your body because jesus knew it was going to happen i mean as all the disciples got killed paul got his head cut off the only one that didn't he died of a natural death with john the revelator right that john's the only one died of natural day everybody else got killed and then the christians down through the dark ages if you remember remember jesus said that you can't give a cup of cold water to one of mine unless i give you a reward amen and he says you know and if you offend one of my children if you offend one of my children it'd be better for a millstone but be hanged about your neck and for you to be cast into the depth of the sea this doesn't that sound just a little extreme for offending one of them that's a pretty extreme punishment for offending one of god's children god don't take it too kindly amen talk about man say like i said i'm gonna jump around a little bit this morning this evening i don't know just how far i get but i want to talk about this a little bit first of all because when we talk about those who are powered by the eve of them remember they're the ones that want to kill you they're the ones that hate you amen they're powered by the devil and jesus said told us what turn the other cheek go the extra mile when somebody's bad to you don't you know persecute you pray for those pray for them love them why because we're powered by god's power not satan's power amen and paul put it this way let me just read what paul said you said the same thing peter peter did over in first peter second chapter he talks about you know suffering wrongfully and so forth how that there's a reward that comes with it and here paul is saying in the 12th chapter of romans verse 13 distributing to the necessity of the saints given the hospitality bless them that persecute you bless and curse not rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that we be of the same mind one to another mind not high things condescend men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits and recommends recompense recompense no man evil or evil amen provide things honest in the sight of men and if all possible as much as life in you live peaceably with all men i mean those christians are peace lovers they love peace amen we will go to war to make peace that's right we will go to war to the devil to try to make sure you get to peace that's why paul would go and he would preach the gospel and man there'd be such an uproar who's made this upper paul's made this uproar yeah he made some uproars trying to get everybody to come to peace right that's right because we love peace we don't want anybody to be not to have the peace of god amen live peaceably with all men dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord [Music] how many knows that all those christians that died all down through the dark ages the popes the priests everybody that betrayed them because jesus said brother's gonna betray brother and and and son's gonna be trained father father's gonna betray son to demon to death huh but when you got your sins forgiven remember every one of those will be having to stand to judgment for what they have done on the day of judgment nobody's getting away with anything one place jesus said um let me think here well i've said it already talk about don't worry about those that they destroy your flesh but fear him that can destroy both body and soul in hell and from what i understand every sinner doesn't have a theophany so their body is called back everybody's called back and they're judged in the body that they send it wow and then both of them are destroyed you know i might just say this that people want to think that when you die you're just annihilated that's it like another place besides heaven or hell well i do believe in the alliation don't you i believe in annihilation but it's when you've paid for the last sin that you have done in hell when you pay for the last one brother bram says you'll become extinct because hell is not eternal your soul is not eternal you don't burn eternally that's right you eventually come to nothing but it isn't before the judgment not before paying amen so no matter how much people try to get out of that they're not going to amen so vengeance is mine saith the lord i will repay and we know that so many offenses have come amen through people through individuals down through the ages [Applause] and every one of them has to pay for those vengeance is mine i will prepay say of the lord therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirsts give him greed for in so doing thou shalt he calls a fire upon his head praise the lord amen when you know that god's going to take care of your stuff he's going to take care of your problem he's going to take care of anybody that does you wrong you can afford to be nice see i ain't going to die you got to hit i ain't got to let that little bitterness come in my heart i just let it go lord you deal with it amen because he said he will repay you pray for him don't you you pray for mercy you pray for grace god forgive him it's not that you want him to pay it's not that you want him to do that no if your heart got in your heart right you do like like stephen and like jesus himself don't lay it on their charge amen why because you realize that if god held the sins against you that you've done you wouldn't have a chance either amen that's right that's where jesus said you know if you don't forgive others god's not gonna give forgive you another place he talked about you know there was two two people that owned somebody money and the one that owed the guy a whole bunch the guy forgave him for the whole bunch and then that guy the little the other person owed this guy money right and man he threw him in jail he didn't forgive him for nothing and the first man that he owed the one guy owner a lot amen he says look shouldn't you have forgiven him amen that's the way that's the world we're living in i mean should we forgive everybody because really when you think about it you've done terrible things amen you owe a whole lot you can afford to forgive somebody amen and then it says he calls a fire on his head be not overcome by evil but overcome evil with good turn to isaiah with me isaiah 1 and we'll begin to look at the day of judgment that comes upon the earth after the holy spirit is lifted and god's wrath comes down upon man now this is i want you to look at this scripture and see the parallel between isaiah and revelation the book of revelations enter into the rock and hide thee i'm sorry didn't tell you where did i sorry isaiah 2. i said it to you been looking for a while and verse 10. all right we got it enter into the rock and high being the dust for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty folks i'm here to tell you when he gets up when he begins to rock this world people are going to be in awe they're going to be in shock the law of demand looks of man shall be humbled and the heartiness of men shall be bowed down and the lord alone shall be exalted in that day for the day of the lord now notice there we're talking about the day of the lord this is man's day man's day they kind of do whatever they want but god's day is coming amen god's going to have his day i i don't know can i just say what comes to my crazy mind it reminds me of a two fighters right and this one fighters just beating the other guy just all the pieces and just beating him knocking him down and beating him all over huh and the guy's perhaps just taking it just taking it just taking it just taking it but what's going to happen when he can take all that when he started dishing it out huh that's going to be the way it is with god yeah god took all that he let us he let us die over revelations i wanted to take the time but maybe i'll just in the smyrna church age he says be thou faithful unto death thou shalt have 10 years of tribulation in around a hundred years perhaps somewhere in there after the death of christ there was 10 years when the christians were bitterly bitterly hunted down and killed in all kinds of matter tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of christians during that time frame that were just slaughtered fulfilling that scripture huh amen but you think about man's day but when god comes up when he begins to get angry when he his day of vengeance comes folks this is what it's going to be like for today the lord of hosts shall be upon everyone that is proud and lofty and upon everyone that is lifted up and he shall be brought low my you think america our morality just everything about america low ebb but wait till california goes down wait till this world begins to rock wait until brother bam says there is a recession coming that'll make the last one look like a picnic huh wait till everything crumbles around everybody you talk about everybody the whole world i can just hear now i can just hear it in that tribulation period people talking about god and god help us and god help us god help i can hear it now you reckon god's going to help him no there's not going to be any help not any more help than it was the day that he flooded the whole earth in the days of noah brought low down in verse 17 and the loftiness of man shall be bowed down the hardiness of men shall be made low and the lord alone shall be exalted in that day and the idols he shall utterly abolish in other words everything that people absolutely put before god isn't that right they're going to be smashed to pieces they're not going to have it anymore and they shall go into the holes of the rocks and into the caves of the earth for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty when he arises to shake terribly the earth how many know this world is in for a real shaking one place the bible says that all the islands fled away there's a lot of islands out there and they're all going to vanish the bible says they're all going to vanish away another place the bible says all the cities of the world fell now can you imagine those big cars skyscrapers all of them smack and falling down it all going to come crashing down then where's the pride then where's the big mouths now people know they're gonna have to face god and it's gonna scare them to death when he rises to shake terribly the earth in that day a man shall cast his idols of silver and his idols of gold which to have made each other for themselves to worship to the moles and to the bats and to go into the clefts of the rock into the tops of the ragged rocks for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty when he arises again he says it to shake terribly the earth amen isaiah 13 says it this way isaiah 13 and verse 6. how will ye for the day of the lord is at hand and it shall come as a destruction from the almighty therefore shall all hands be faint and every man's heart shall melt and they shall be afraid pangs of sorrow hey there's not going to be any more joy around and they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth and they shall be amazed at one another and their faces shall be as flames i can imagine asking the politician well what about this well i don't know i don't know ain't gonna know what to do they're just gonna know that we're all gonna have to it looks like we're all gonna face god yeah they'll get on us they'll know they're faking i have to face god amen because it's gonna be his day you had your day now it's my day and it's gonna be a day of wrath therefore will i shake the heavens and the earth shall remove out of her place in the wrath of the lord of hosts and in the day of his fierce anger wow go to revelations revelation six and this is under the sixth seal we know all the way up to the the fourth seal verse eight six revelation six and verse eight will begin and i looked and behold a pale horse remember that's the last horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed him fellow with him and power was given unto him over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth we've seen that down through the dark ages now he knows what the fifth seal is according to probably god the fifth seal was the souls of those uh that were hit uh killed by eichmann and two different ones all of that was so those souls that were under the altar crying how long o lord until you avenge our blood amen all right that was the fifth seal was them but now we know that the bride's supposed to be gone before the sixth seal comes isn't that right before the sixth seal happened the bride's supposed to be gone and i beheld verse 12 my beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake amen that gives certainly gives uh because remember there was a great earthquake when jesus the resurrect resurrection happen this this is presumption but it does gives you a reason to wonder whether when california goes down the rapture won't take place it's somewhere along the line it would be correspond with an earthquake amen but a great earthquake and the sun became black a sackcloth of hair and the moon became his blood and the stars remember he shakes the heavens and the earth over in isaiah right and the stars of heaven fell upon the earth amen even as a fig tree casters or untimely fix when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty man the bond man and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and remember remember what isaiah said there enter into the rock and hide the end of dust amen for the day of the lord is coming so here revelations once again it says in the dens and the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and the rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that setteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is common who shall be able to stand many places in the revelation he talks about the wrath of god poured out without mixture in the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of almighty god folks i don't know about you but you there's some people that you don't want to get mad but can you imagine when god gets angry and not just angry the bible says it talks about his fierce wrath because you know it's one thing to be mad but when somebody's furious you really want to hit the door when they're furious man and that's what god's going to be he's going to be his fury he's going to be very angry amen and rightfully so rightfully because man he extended his arm he extended his arm thousands of times he extended his arm did miracles signs and wonders and show them and they see oh turned away turned away turned away he says now you turned away mercy now you will stand his judgment that's right literally buildings falling on people earth opening up people falling in all the wrath of god they have to stand as judgment because if they refuse his mercy amen amen i don't think i brought it out you see folks why we have time to come church on wednesday sunday to search our hearts search our souls see honest you are i mean those the pure heart they shall see god make sure everything's right make sure every little sin is taken care of make sure that when he comes you're ready to go amen it's not because we're afraid of his wrath even though we do want to escape his wrath but because we simply appreciate his mercy we appreciate his grace we appreciate what he has done we accept what he has done we receive his mercy we accept it deep you know that's why i only want one i only want one choice and that's him amen not just one one choice and that's jesus christ aren't you glad somebody said praise the lord say i'm glad i chose him and he chose me amen because only two choices only two destinations one is to go and meet him in the air with all the saints right with all the saints of all the ages that have died give their life amen for the gospel for jesus christ amen can i read uh i know it's getting about that time but can i read just a little more amen we see the signs how many notes we can see the sign surroundings telling us that this judgment is getting close russia is getting in the right mental attitude to blow somebody up they're talking about be super fast missiles that they're going to send to people who support ukraine and so forth folks to me we all know that was nothing less than a nuclear threat because they claimed to have those supersonic you know that ain't nothing but a a threat they said another place if there is a any kind of a nuclear war there will be no nato they said getting in the mental condition world won't take too much one of these days it's not just going to take not too much but they will do it after the bride is gone amen but the signs one of the great signs was that god sent us elijah behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord amen how many believes that and he did and he warned and he did so much through that prophet for the gentiles that we are without excuse no excuse amen peter he says the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also in the works they're in shall be burnt up and then he talks to us seeing them that these things shall be dissolved what kind of person on you to be in all holy living and godliness how many please we better be godly without holiness no man shall see god amen and godliness remember over judy says they're ungodly deep they have ungodly committed he's talking about us being in godliness looking for the hasting unto the coming of the day of god amen wherein the heavens being on far shall be dissolved the elements shall melt with fervently nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new heavens and a new earth wherein is no evil no unrighteousness we're into allah's righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him
