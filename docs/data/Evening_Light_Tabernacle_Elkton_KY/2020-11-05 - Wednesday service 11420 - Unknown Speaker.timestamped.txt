[1:46] now when you feel little prayer we're

[1:54] burning we will find a little thought
[1:57] with jesus makes everything once again
[2:00] if we care tonight
[2:02] oh let us
[2:08] [Music]
[2:22] [Music]
[2:27] you will find a little talk with
[2:34] jesus
[2:36] you believe that with all of your heart
[2:37] tonight amen god bless you it's good to
[2:40] see each and everyone out tonight and
[2:43] we have some prayer requests we want to
[2:44] take the lord in prayer tonight and
[2:46] before we do i was called a
[2:50] friend of mine he lives down by
[2:52] jeffersonville brother truman jackson
[2:53] and
[2:54] we had prayer for sister carol his wife
[2:56] and
[2:57] she's had cancer and i just every once
[3:00] while i call him just to see how they're
[3:02] doing and
[3:04] i called him uh i guess it was last
[3:07] night
[3:08] my days they kind of get away from me
[3:10] but i asked him how everything was going
[3:12] and
[3:14] he said sister carol was doing really
[3:16] good and they thanking god for the
[3:18] cancer being gone and
[3:21] and so he goes to brother nathan
[3:25] bryant's church and brother nathan's
[3:26] mother had cancer also and
[3:28] i said well how's brother nathan's mom
[3:30] doing he said she's doing fine so the
[3:33] lords healed her of cancer and
[3:35] and i said well and there was four in
[3:37] their church that had cancer there was
[3:39] three sisters
[3:40] and a brother and i said well how
[3:43] and i'm ashamed of myself because i
[3:46] wrote the other sister's name down and i
[3:48] wrote it so bad i couldn't even read it
[3:49] myself and
[3:51] he said he said she's doing fine
[3:54] but he said she was on dialysis before
[3:57] she got the cancer and he said she needs
[4:00] a touch from the lord for that and i
[4:01] said well we'll remember her in prayer
[4:03] and
[4:03] of course i messed her name up and asked
[4:06] him about the brother and he said
[4:07] he's doing fine he's cancer-free and i
[4:11] just began to
[4:14] i said god you're an awesome god
[4:18] and i told jan you know i said you know
[4:19] we get
[4:21] we get sick every once in a while but
[4:25] people that go through a disease like
[4:26] cancer and i watched it with my mother
[4:28] and
[4:29] i said you know we don't know what it is
[4:32] if you haven't had something like that
[4:33] to know what it is to get up
[4:35] and be sick and all day long you're sick
[4:39] until god moves in such a way that it's
[4:42] gone
[4:43] and and then i begin to think of what
[4:46] brother thomas preached on sunday god's
[4:48] miracles
[4:50] and my heart just overjoyed and what
[4:53] he's done for us
[4:54] and of course i always think of sister
[4:55] anne she's gone home now to be at the
[4:57] lord and
[4:58] how he healed her and just the many
[5:00] things and i thought lord
[5:03] you're still the same if we can only
[5:06] believe and
[5:07] so we have some needs tonight sister
[5:09] adriana is
[5:10] not feeling well tonight and sister
[5:12] serenity
[5:14] she's not feeling well and also sister

[5:25] mark well three of my grandchildren mark
[5:28] shay and
[5:29] madison they all had to go get a test
[5:31] today for the coveted
[5:33] so just pray that all's well with them
[5:35] and
[5:36] also brother john and sister alicia are
[5:38] not here and they ask that we remember
[5:40] them they bought a
[5:41] new dog and it decided to run away and
[5:43] they've been trying to get a hold of it
[5:44] and catch it so remember

[22:01] your void father but that it would
[22:02] accomplish
[22:04] lord what it was intended for we love
[22:06] you and we just ask god for your divine
[22:08] guidance now in jesus name
[22:10] amen and amen open your bibles if you
[22:14] will the second corinthians
[22:17] speak on a very familiar subject for us
[22:20] amen and it was something that brother
[22:22] branham
[22:23] spoke on amen and i just want to see
[22:26] what the lord will have for us
[22:28] amen to come and to see what he'll pull
[22:31] from it
[22:32] and i'm going to a different scripture
[22:34] than what he used
[22:36] let's say let's go to ii corinthians
[22:40] sixth chapter
[22:47] second corinthians six
[22:56] and we'll begin with
[23:01] verse 14 through verse
[23:05] 17 be ye not unequally yoked together
[23:09] with unbelievers for what fellowship
[23:12] hath righteousness with unrighteousness
[23:15] and what communion hath light with
[23:17] darkness
[23:19] and what accord concord hath christ
[23:23] with belial or what part hath
[23:26] he that believeth with an infidel
[23:29] and what agreement at the temple of god
[23:31] with idols
[23:33] for ye are the temple of the living god
[23:35] as god has said i will dwell in them
[23:38] and i will walk in them i will be their
[23:40] god and they shall be my people
[23:43] wherefore come out from among them and
[23:45] be ye separate
[23:47] saith the lord and touch not the unclean
[23:49] thing and i will
[23:51] receive you let's go to first
[23:53] corinthians
[23:56] first corinthians
[23:59] first chapter
[24:05] verse 18 and then we'll jump down to
[24:09] verse 22.
[24:10] verse 18 says for the preaching of the
[24:12] cross is to them that perish
[24:15] foolishness but unto us which are saved
[24:18] it is the power of god
[24:20] verse 22 for the jews require a sign
[24:24] and the greeks seek after wisdom but we
[24:27] preach
[24:28] christ crucified and to the jews the
[24:30] stumbling block and unto the greeks
[24:33] foolishness but unto them that are
[24:35] called both to the jews and greeks
[24:37] christ the power of god and the wisdom
[24:39] of god because the foolishness of god is
[24:42] wiser than men and the weakness of god
[24:44] is stronger
[24:45] than men for you see your calling
[24:47] brethren how that not many
[24:49] wise men after the flesh not many mighty
[24:52] not many
[24:53] noble are called but god has chosen
[24:56] the foolish things of the world to
[24:59] confound the wise
[25:01] and god has chosen the weak things of
[25:04] the world to confound
[25:06] the things which are mighty and the base
[25:09] things
[25:09] of the world and things which are
[25:11] despised
[25:13] hath god chosen the a and things
[25:17] which are not to bring to not things
[25:20] that are amen may god add his blessings
[25:22] to the reading of the word
[25:24] amen you can be seated i want to take my
[25:27] message and i'm going to call it just
[25:29] what brother branham called it
[25:30] i want to talk about oddballs
[25:34] oddballs amen
[25:37] amen i think every one of us is familiar
[25:40] with that uh tape and that message that
[25:43] brother brandon preached on oddballs
[25:46] amen and i got to thinking about that
[25:48] and uh
[25:50] uh one place brother bam said you know
[25:52] the
[25:53] farmer is a oddball to the business man
[25:56] and
[25:56] and he just went on a couple different
[25:58] things and how that
[26:00] uh he got to speaking of diversity amen
[26:05] of the many different diversities that
[26:08] we have in the world we're certainly
[26:10] living in a world of diversity
[26:13] and it seems to be that the world amen
[26:16] is trying to make everybody one
[26:19] everybody
[26:20] the same amen and we're living in that
[26:23] kind of a world
[26:25] but you know the truth of the matter is
[26:28] is that we're living in a world that has
[26:30] a lot of diverse
[26:32] kind of people now right and
[26:35] we know brother branham taught many
[26:37] places and he said different things
[26:39] about how that
[26:40] god wants separators he says the world
[26:43] wants mixers they want to mix it all
[26:45] together
[26:46] you know i'd mix it all together but god
[26:48] wants separators people that
[26:51] you know realize that you are different
[26:53] amen
[26:55] and there's so many different different
[26:57] things in different clans
[27:00] uh i believe it was somewhere in
[27:01] revelations it talks about in the tribes
[27:05] of the earth shall mourn because of him
[27:08] amen so even the bible talks about
[27:10] how that there's a lot of different
[27:12] tribes right
[27:14] and so we know back in the indian times
[27:16] there was a lot of different
[27:17] a lot of different tribes even though
[27:19] they were all indian there was all still
[27:21] a lot of tribes a lot of different
[27:23] tribes and they would have contention
[27:25] with those tribes
[27:27] and because of that diversity that there
[27:29] is in the world and the differences that
[27:31] there is in the world
[27:32] there is always bound to be stress there
[27:35] is always bound to be friction
[27:38] amen and we all know that it doesn't
[27:40] take a whole lot to have
[27:42] friction or to have differences and to
[27:45] bring
[27:46] division in that right to bring division
[27:49] amongst people because really uh
[27:52] you know even two people can't walk
[27:54] together unless they be agreed right
[27:57] and so uh even people having different
[28:00] one of the major things that
[28:03] causes divisiveness and brings
[28:05] divisiveness
[28:06] is even as much as somebody having a
[28:09] different opinion
[28:11] either idea a different idea or
[28:14] a different goal will cause people to
[28:16] have be divisive
[28:18] amen and it kind of separates people it
[28:20] you know if you don't have the same goal
[28:22] as somebody else
[28:23] if you don't think the same as somebody
[28:25] else it has a tendency to separate you
[28:29] amen and we know that even though all
[28:30] the indians here in america when they
[28:32] were here they were all different tribes
[28:34] and so forth
[28:34] you know it was because of the fact that
[28:36] they couldn't come together
[28:38] amen amen and and really clan together
[28:41] is why they lost the war and so forth
[28:43] but they were all indians they shouldn't
[28:45] you would think that they would all get
[28:47] together but they all have their
[28:48] little differences in that right amen
[28:52] and they were odd to each other our
[28:54] our our differences become odd to each
[28:57] other amen and
[28:58] if you have a certain idea and i think
[29:00] we could take our democrats and our
[29:02] republicans
[29:03] and you know they have different goals
[29:05] they have different ambitions you know
[29:07] and so it divides them you know you know
[29:10] if you don't have the same goal you're
[29:11] not on the same path
[29:13] i mean it brings division and so forth
[29:16] amen
[29:17] and so we look at this and i will begin
[29:18] to think about how that
[29:21] brother branham even would talk about
[29:23] even the farmer and some
[29:25] something as simple as the farmer and
[29:27] the businessman
[29:28] and and because they have different
[29:30] ideas they have different
[29:32] desires perhaps different goals and you
[29:35] know
[29:35] uh you know and so it causes them to be
[29:38] an oddball he says it makes them odd
[29:41] to each other amen it makes them
[29:44] odd amen so let me just start and i want
[29:48] to i want to
[29:49] you know i want to say this perhaps
[29:51] while i have to have it in my mind
[29:52] because
[29:53] a lot of times i don't don't think about
[29:55] it later on
[29:56] but we realized that brother branham
[29:57] talked about the churches the
[29:59] pentecostals the oneness the tunis
[30:01] the threeness you know there was a lot
[30:02] of different churches they had a lot of
[30:04] a lot of different ideas and different a
[30:07] different way they saw the scripture and
[30:08] it would cause that caused them to be
[30:10] divided you know right
[30:11] but he said many times he talked about
[30:13] you know when you're really filled with
[30:15] the holy ghost
[30:16] amen it you don't dwell on those
[30:19] differences
[30:20] is that right amen if you dwell on those
[30:23] differences and those
[30:24] differences causes you to be divided
[30:26] then you really don't have the spirit of
[30:28] god
[30:29] amen and so when it comes to the church
[30:32] of god we want to get to this a little
[30:33] bit later perhaps when it comes to the
[30:35] body of christ
[30:37] amen we don't have divisions we don't
[30:40] we aren't oddballs to each other
[30:43] because we have the same goal we have
[30:45] the same thought we have the same
[30:47] ideas how many believes that and i'll
[30:50] perhaps take to take it to scripture
[30:52] after a while let me just start tonight
[30:55] by reading a story that i really like
[30:57] amen and the first one if you don't mind
[31:00] i'm just gonna
[31:01] um i'm just going to mention it because
[31:05] no actually right here it is i mean i
[31:06] did print it out i didn't think i
[31:08] printed it out but i'm going to go ahead
[31:09] and read it
[31:10] now notice he says now this is really
[31:12] not any place for jokes and so forth but
[31:14] there was a little german
[31:15] out german man out west on the west
[31:17] coast where we was at
[31:19] and he received the holy ghost and he
[31:21] went down the street and he just began
[31:22] to walk a little beast and he'd
[31:24] raise up his hands and he'd speak in
[31:26] tongues he'd run he'd jump
[31:28] he'd shout and he was at work carrying
[31:31] on like that and his balls came to him
[31:33] said you know where have you been
[31:36] amen he says well you must have been
[31:38] there with amongst that bunch of nuts
[31:41] amen and he says then you think they are
[31:44] nuts he said sure they are
[31:46] amen so how many knows that we could go
[31:48] on this morning this evening and knowing
[31:50] realizing that
[31:52] and we as christians were called
[31:54] fanatics we're called
[31:56] uh holy rollers we're called nuts we're
[31:59] called crazy
[32:00] we're called all kinds of names that we
[32:01] get called why
[32:03] because we're an oddball to somebody
[32:05] that's not a christian
[32:07] and part of the reason that i mentioned
[32:08] that and read that in first corinthians
[32:10] was because
[32:11] and paul even was saying here that you
[32:14] know
[32:14] uh that with the greeks and with the
[32:17] jews
[32:18] not not the with the greeks and who was
[32:21] it the greeks
[32:23] and the jews that was the jews the jews
[32:25] require a sign to greet
[32:27] seek after wisdom and even even say
[32:29] bringing the distinction between them
[32:31] talking about how that they even think
[32:34] that you know
[32:35] one of them requires this they look for
[32:36] this they look for that you know and
[32:38] they call
[32:39] the preaching of the gospel foolishness
[32:43] amen they call it foolishness but we
[32:45] realize that amen to us
[32:47] it's the last thing but foolish
[32:50] amen it's the power of god preaching it
[32:53] it's salvation to us
[32:55] but they think it's foolishness the very
[32:57] thing that can save you so they think
[32:59] it's foolish
[33:01] amen and when uh and now
[33:04] and if you'll notice let me finish the
[33:06] story but now notice so here he says
[33:07] the boss called him call said that
[33:09] they're a bunch of nuts
[33:11] and he said well praise the lord for the
[33:13] nuts
[33:14] he says do you know what he says the
[33:16] nuts play a big
[33:18] part amen he says for instance in the
[33:21] automobile
[33:22] you take all the nuts out of it and you
[33:24] ain't got nothing but a bunch of
[33:26] young or junk isn't that right
[33:30] a bunch of young and so that's just
[33:32] about right
[33:33] amen how many knows that's pretty much
[33:36] you can apply
[33:37] that to the whole world amen you take
[33:40] the people
[33:41] of god that are considered to be nuts
[33:44] you take them out and you really got
[33:46] nothing but sodom and gomorrah
[33:48] you got nothing but a bunch of junk amen
[33:51] because these nuts is really
[33:53] what hold things together amen and we
[33:56] can go
[33:56] all the way down through time but
[33:58] abandon did he talk about
[34:00] noah's day how did he was a nut
[34:03] he was considered a fanatic he was
[34:05] considered a nut
[34:07] to think that it was going to rain amen
[34:12] and let me just say first of all you
[34:14] know because of the diversity that we
[34:15] have
[34:16] there's definite major diverse
[34:19] things in the bible amen there's not all
[34:22] people
[34:22] are the same all right because
[34:26] uh you know even paul talked about here
[34:28] he talks about what
[34:29] fellowship does light have with darkness
[34:32] jesus said you know
[34:34] i send you out into this world like
[34:36] sheep amongst
[34:38] wolves hello there's a big difference
[34:40] there
[34:41] and so there's wolves in this world
[34:44] there's a sheep in the world we realize
[34:46] there's
[34:47] canes in the world the lineage of cain
[34:49] which are murderers and everything else
[34:51] amen there's the children of darkness
[34:54] isn't that right and the children of
[34:56] light there's
[34:56] a big difference there amen
[34:59] it's a huge difference amen it divides
[35:03] us it makes us amen different
[35:06] we don't have the same goal we don't
[35:08] have the same ambitions
[35:10] amen one is of darkness one is of light
[35:13] there is
[35:14] amen major differences in the world
[35:17] amen and so you know just taking this
[35:21] so he says listen he says and when you
[35:24] so when you
[35:25] you are so different amen when you get
[35:28] the holy ghost when the holy ghost comes
[35:30] on to you
[35:31] on you until you mind until the mind of
[35:35] this world don't like you
[35:36] he says they're against you they want
[35:39] nothing to do with you
[35:41] after all you're born of another world
[35:44] and you become an alien to this world
[35:48] now there's another whole thought in
[35:49] itself that when you become born again
[35:52] you put yourself in a special class of
[35:54] people how many knows that
[35:56] amen when you're born of the holy ghost
[35:58] you become a part of the body of christ
[36:02] amen now the body of christ amen it may
[36:05] have diversity of gifts and diverse
[36:07] kind of people and so forth but even
[36:09] though we have
[36:10] all of this diversity the one thing that
[36:14] we have in common and the one thing that
[36:16] welds
[36:16] all our diversity together and it glues
[36:20] it together
[36:21] is the love of god how many believes
[36:23] that
[36:24] when you have the love of god even
[36:25] though we're different we think
[36:27] different we have different traits you
[36:28] know perhaps naturally speaking in our
[36:30] nature and
[36:31] some of our characteristics are very
[36:33] different when it comes to holy ghost
[36:35] amen those differences get away from you
[36:38] like the prophet of god said amen you
[36:40] don't see those differences you don't
[36:41] recognize those difference because
[36:43] truly you end up having the one one mind
[36:46] you have the same goal
[36:48] once you're dropped in the body of
[36:49] christ through the new birth
[36:51] in other words you are not an oddball to
[36:54] each other
[36:55] amen because you know you can't have the
[36:58] same people thinking the same way
[36:59] having the same goal you're not odd to
[37:01] each other why
[37:02] because you're one body amen
[37:06] praise the lord so it makes you
[37:07] different he's asking me the world
[37:09] especially they don't want nothing to do
[37:10] you
[37:10] amen they don't have no fellowship with
[37:12] you amen
[37:14] praise the lord the second one i want to
[37:16] bring in is a very well known story
[37:18] amen how that brother bam tells the
[37:20] story here he says and now
[37:22] i was going down the street one time in
[37:24] los angeles california
[37:25] i seen a very odd person amen acting ah
[37:30] how many knows a real christian is a odd
[37:33] person to the world
[37:36] peculiar people hey that
[37:39] different people this person was an odd
[37:42] person going down there
[37:43] and he was walking down the street not
[37:46] picketing but just merely taking an
[37:48] afternoon stroke and i went to the other
[37:50] side of the street to see what he was
[37:52] doing
[37:52] everybody was turning around laughing at
[37:55] him because of his peculiarity
[37:57] i noticed he had a sign hanging on the
[37:59] front of him and i thought that i'd see
[38:01] what everybody was laughing about
[38:04] this odd peculiar man and so i noticed
[38:06] him and as the people looked at him they
[38:08] laughed at him
[38:10] and he seemed to have a different kind
[38:12] of a smile a smile of contentment
[38:16] amen how many believes that's the way to
[38:18] the christian dead
[38:20] amen now i see none of y'all going down
[38:24] through elkton with this sign on your
[38:25] back yet
[38:27] huh we'll be kind of different wouldn't
[38:30] it
[38:32] and listen smile of contentment and
[38:34] other smiles that people were giving him
[38:36] was kind more of a
[38:37] ridiculing him but he seemed satisfied
[38:41] in what he was doing
[38:46] amen now me knows as we go through this
[38:49] life as young people grow up there's a
[38:51] you have to decide which oddball
[38:54] you're going to be with what crowd
[38:58] you're going to hang with because i mean
[39:00] there's a lot of different crowds out
[39:02] there

[39:09] are the motorcycle rallies that happen
[39:11] different places you know on the
[39:13] oh my i mean you could be a part of that
[39:16] you look about oh man there's just so
[39:18] many different ones
[39:20] huh but i don't know about you but
[39:23] for me you have to make a chance you
[39:24] have to make a choice to where you gonna
[39:26] be

[39:30] mean that number i'm in that number
[39:32] amen that blood washed number robed in
[39:35] white
[39:36] amen i want to be in that number you
[39:38] have to decide what what crowd you're
[39:40] gonna be with
[39:41] i don't know about you but for for me
[39:43] being a christian i want to be in that
[39:45] crowd
[39:45] amen that's washed in the blood of jesus
[39:47] christ that stands
[39:49] amen on the other side in eternity
[39:52] with eternal life i want to be
[39:55] one of them how many wants to be one of
[39:58] them that's what i want to be i want to
[40:00] be one of those ones that
[40:01] live through all of eternity
[40:04] amen and i don't mind being a fool or
[40:07] whatever it takes
[40:09] an oddball or a nut whatever people want
[40:11] to think of me it doesn't matter to me
[40:14] as long as i'm a part of that number out
[40:17] of
[40:17] all the other numbers of all the
[40:19] different crowds that's the crowd i want
[40:20] to belong into
[40:22] the one that's going to leave this world
[40:23] one of these days amen
[40:26] but this man here he was happy with what
[40:28] he was doing
[40:30] that's what a whole lot what i think
[40:31] about when a man satisfied
[40:33] in what he's doing is right though he
[40:37] be an oddball to somebody else if he's
[40:41] satisfied
[40:42] that what he's doing is right then let
[40:44] him stay that way
[40:46] stay with it this man was so
[40:49] satisfied with who he was so satisfied
[40:53] with being in the crowd of
[40:54] oddball he didn't mind putting a sign on
[40:57] his front
[40:58] and putting a sign on his back and on
[41:00] the front front he says
[41:02] you might call this foolish i may be a
[41:04] fool
[41:05] i don't mind being a fool for christ he
[41:08] says i am a fool
[41:09] for christ praise the lord
[41:15] amen and as he went by brother brown
[41:17] says listen this and as i come close to
[41:19] the little man notice
[41:21] across his chest here was a black board
[41:23] was wrote i
[41:24] am a fool and at the bottom head for
[41:27] christ
[41:29] amen i'm a fool in great letters and
[41:32] down at the bottom said for
[41:33] christ and everybody was laughing at
[41:36] this
[41:40] oh my who you reckon is going to have
[41:43] the last lap pete
[41:46] when he gets over the other side now
[41:48] people on the other side they're going
[41:50] to say there's that guy that walked down
[41:51] the street
[41:52] had that he said boy i didn't mind being
[41:56] a fool for christ because i know where i
[41:57] was going y'all
[41:59] and that right that's right so they
[42:02] might have laughed at him but he'll have
[42:04] the last laugh
[42:06] i'm a fool for christ everybody laughing
[42:08] listen laughing
[42:10] and as the little man pressed on down
[42:11] through the crowd of cheers and carrying
[42:14] on
[42:15] i looked to turn to look what was on his
[42:18] back and there was a great big question
[42:20] mark
[42:20] on this back said down at the bottom
[42:23] said now
[42:24] whose fool are you

[42:46] all right and i've of course
[42:49] listen let me finish this here so he
[42:51] says
[42:52] and then thinking of this group
[42:56] all right paul had said i have become a
[42:58] fool in glory
[42:59] and so forth then thinking of this group
[43:01] no doubt that in the eyes of people on
[43:04] the other side
[43:05] you've become a fool you have become
[43:08] what they would call today
[43:10] the oddball huh boy isn't he a oddball

[43:52] and i hate to tell you this but it's
[43:54] either god or it's the devil
[43:56] if it ain't god guess who it is the
[43:58] devil
[44:00] amen most likely i dare say that if they
[44:02] say i ain't serving nobody i could dare
[44:04] say you know you're serving the devil if
[44:06] you're not serving nobody because you're
[44:07] serving yourself
[44:08] thereby serving the devil
[44:12] huh you got to serve somebody
[44:15] praise the lord got to be somebody's
[44:17] full i mean
[44:18] people don't mind being the devil's fool
[44:21] people are not
[44:24] huh didn't brother brown say that uh i

[45:18] they are to be different well they dare
[45:20] to be different
[45:22] we just don't there to be different huh
[45:24] but listen so you think about the world

[45:28] what they do and how nuts they act
[45:30] people go to the ball game and they
[45:32] all like nuts oh boy but didn't brother
[45:36] bam talk about he says he
[45:37] is somewhere i don't know if he's seen
[45:38] it or what but that'll be a ball game
[45:40] you know they get so
[45:41] so hyped up that they take this big old
[45:43] straw hat when somebody got a home run
[45:45] he said they grabbed that saw and go and
[45:48] jerk it down over their head and give
[45:49] himself some
[45:50] ring just with that ring of that straw
[45:52] hat
[45:53] finally looking pope pied up there and
[45:55] ring around his collar
[46:00] you know they say they don't care how
[46:02] they're acting around here
[46:03] they're excited they completely act a
[46:06] fool
[46:08] they don't mind acting fool for this
[46:09] side or the other but
[46:11] come to church bam says and oh brother
[46:14] venom i
[46:15] couldn't preach man if that woman like
[46:17] that screams and stuff it sends chills
[46:20] up my back
[46:21] you know he said you'd freeze the debts
[46:24] if you got to heaven
[46:25] there's going to be a bunch of big bunch
[46:26] of screaming you ever heard
[46:28] but you don't mind going out there
[46:30] screaming but uh come on folks
[46:33] better be yeah come on think about it
[46:36] you know
[46:36] look at david how many knows david was
[46:38] the nut
[46:39] he went a little crazy lower when you
[46:42] think about
[46:43] how good god is and how great god is and
[46:45] how wonderful god is
[46:47] amen how many knows david had been
[46:49] delivered out of the hands of his
[46:51] enemies and out of the jaws of death a
[46:53] million times
[46:54] when the ark when god was coming into
[46:56] the camp he didn't mind going
[46:58] and dancing and shouting and screaming
[47:00] and hollering so much until his wife
[47:02] thought
[47:02] david you are nuts
[47:07] michelle or michelle i guess
[47:10] somehow it's pronounced like that and
[47:13] you know
[47:13] she thought he was nuts people might
[47:15] have thought he was nuts but he didn't
[47:17] mind being
[47:17] up for christ we need more nuts
[47:22] we need people that are a little bit
[47:23] more fanatical about god why because
[47:25] he's worth it
[47:27] he's our everything he's all he's our
[47:30] breath he's our sunshine he's our all in
[47:32] all
[47:36] amen
[47:38] that's right so he says the other side
[47:41] is two
[47:42] they're all oddballs amen so you have to
[47:44] be somebody's fool
[47:46] not rather be a fool for christ see
[47:50] god said that his people would be a
[47:53] peculiar
[47:54] people ah chosen elected royal
[47:57] priesthood
[47:58] offering up spiritual sacrifices unto
[48:01] god
[48:03] hey folks when they have those rock and
[48:04] roll bands and those
[48:06] uh concerts that they're worshiping the
[48:09] devil
[48:10] they're worshiping they're bringing up
[48:12] sacrifices to the devil
[48:14] when we come to church we sing amazing
[48:16] grace how sweet this out
[48:18] that saved a wretch like me we're
[48:20] offering up spiritual sacrifices to our
[48:23] god
[48:26] glory praise the lord
[48:30] offering up spiritual sacrifice says
[48:33] worshiping our god
[48:35] so if we get the acting a little stupid
[48:38] to people
[48:39] or like or not that's just fine with me
[48:44] huh he's worth it
[48:54] he never corrected him he said no david
[48:57] you got a little wildfire there
[48:59] make sure you leave your shirt on
[49:01] tomorrow huh
[49:08] no he never corrected him he would if he
[49:10] would have got out of line he says
[49:11] that's the way i like to be worshipped
[49:12] somebody really loves the lord
[49:15] amen now don't get me wrong we don't
[49:17] strip our shirt off today right
[49:20] but people can take things out of
[49:21] context can't they
[49:23] that's where brother bam says why i am
[49:25] so misunderstood he would say stuff and
[49:27] people would say hey it's all right
[49:28] rip your shirt off you heard him up
[49:30] there uh
[49:32] amen you love the lord okay so that's
[49:35] right
[49:36] oddballs they are oh my when you think
[49:38] about it
[49:40] oddballs or a nut and this guy here
[49:43] henry
[49:44] amen he says you know if it wasn't for
[49:46] the nuts
[49:48] everything would fall apart
[49:52] amen i may know that if it wouldn't have
[49:53] been for the days of noah
[49:55] if it wouldn't have been for the nut no
[49:57] flesh would have been saved
[50:01] now butterbank says that you know if if
[50:03] you have a nut there has to be a bolt to
[50:05] fit that nut
[50:07] and it's got to be threaded to that bolt
[50:10] i wanted to bring a bolt and i didn't
[50:11] i forgot to do it big old bolt in a nut
[50:14] you know because when you've got that
[50:15] nut all by itself
[50:17] well it's just a nut
[50:21] right but if that nut is threaded to
[50:24] something it serves a purpose
[50:27] amen and i'll tell you what david he was
[50:30] threaded to something that served a
[50:32] purpose
[50:33] noah was threaded to almighty god
[50:36] and it pulled everybody that listened to
[50:38] that nut
[50:39] everybody that was connected to that nut
[50:42] it pulled them
[50:43] amen and it saved them from the flood
[50:47] amen if it wouldn't have been for that
[50:48] it all been lost
[50:51] amen most how many knows moses was
[50:54] considered a nut
[50:56] i also called some of these people that
[50:58] people call nuts
[51:00] crazy mad
[51:04] pioneers noah was a pioneer
[51:08] he was going into territory in the place
[51:10] where they had never went before there
[51:12] was never no rain before
[51:14] but yet he said there's going to be
[51:16] because god said there is
[51:18] moses when he came down into pharaoh's
[51:20] presence he said let my people go
[51:24] god said it amen and pharaoh
[51:28] amen listen noah i mean moses was a nut
[51:31] to pharaoh what
[51:32] is this not doing in my audience here
[51:36] amy telling me he come in here telling
[51:38] me that i gotta let all my people go
[51:41] but yet on the opposite side brother ben
[51:44] says student pharaoh was also
[51:46] nut he's crazy not listen to moses
[51:50] he's crazy how could you hear that god
[51:53] said do it and then not do it
[51:56] knowing the history of the israelites
[51:59] and that god was with him
[52:01] kind of like you and me today right i
[52:04] mean we talk about
[52:05] amen we talk about god and people think
[52:07] we're nuts
[52:08] and we think they're nuts because listen
[52:10] with the identification with what god
[52:12] has come and proved
[52:14] himself alive and look at the miracle of
[52:17] everything and then you still can't see
[52:19] god you still don't believe
[52:20] god even though you're walking on the
[52:22] miracle every day of your life you're
[52:25] walking on the miracle of god and you
[52:26] never see it never recognize it
[52:32] you fail to acknowledge there's a god
[52:34] even the universe couldn't be this way
[52:35] without the heaven to be a god you've
[52:37] got to be crazy
[52:39] well i think the way i think it see it
[52:42] you have got to be a nut
[52:43] you've got to be completely crazy to
[52:46] walk on a miracle to know that this
[52:47] thing can't just be by chance the stars
[52:49] and galaxies
[52:50] amen the very earth that you were
[52:52] creating was created by the word of god
[52:55] it's created by this bible right here
[52:58] how many believes that this is what
[52:59] created the heavens and the earth
[53:02] most important book brother mom says you
[53:05] know there was a certain man that wrote
[53:06] the book nadal said that that was the
[53:08] most
[53:09] most important book it was the book of
[53:10] the year brother brown says i beg to
[53:12] differ with you
[53:14] every year the book of the year is this
[53:16] book right here
[53:20] amen aren't you glad to have a prophet
[53:22] like what we did how many knows he was a
[53:24] nut to the world too
[53:26] the man says it's about time for another
[53:27] nut he's at the pentecostal we're nuts
[53:29] for a while
[53:30] they were considered nuts they were
[53:32] considered crazy
[53:34] why they'd speak in tongues shout and
[53:37] mind run the aisles and do all kinds of
[53:39] things
[53:39] man they were all considered great they
[53:42] were nuts for a while but what
[53:44] is it it's the thing that held it
[53:45] together and they said now they
[53:47] went right back into the same slot that
[53:49] they came out of
[53:52] amendment it's about time for another
[53:54] nut to come on the scene
[53:56] we did get another nut to come on the
[53:58] scene i'm glad to be associated with
[54:00] that nut
[54:03] that's right because guess what it's not
[54:06] it is
[54:06] connected to a boat called christ
[54:10] and it's going to thread us right into
[54:11] the skies one of these days
[54:14] amen and then they can have this world
[54:17] amen
[54:17] we'll be back when it's cleaned off
[54:21] amen praise the lord
[54:25] that's right look at that just the
[54:28] different ones
[54:33] moses considered a nut considered crazy
[54:37] john the baptist to the pharisees
[54:41] they didn't even realize he was the
[54:42] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[54:45] prepare you the way of the lord he was
[54:48] threatening everybody to christ
[54:50] and they're right telling them christ's
[54:52] coming trying to thread him to death
[54:53] you know and everybody listen to them
[54:55] got baptized
[54:57] amen and then jesus come along
[55:00] and was he called crazy was he a nut
[55:04] turn with me if you will let's go see
[55:10] saint john 10. how many knows man
[55:14] mad means crazy
[55:17] crazy's a nut what we would call today
[55:19] the crazy house
[55:21] loony bin amen
[55:24] well we would call people nuts they're
[55:26] nuts out of their mind
[55:29] crazy when jesus went to preaching
[55:34] chapter 10 of saint john
[55:37] verse 18 no man taketh it
[55:43] from me but i lay it down of myself i
[55:45] have power to lay it down and i have
[55:47] power to take it again
[55:49] this come this commandment have i
[55:51] received it by my father
[55:53] and there was a division therefore among
[55:56] the jews for the
[55:58] for these saints how many knows that
[56:00] whenever paul preached he'd always be a
[56:01] division
[56:02] jesus preached there's always a division
[56:05] light
[56:05] separating from darkness those who
[56:07] believe and those who believe not
[56:09] amen and many of them said
[56:13] he hath the devil and is mad
[56:17] huh called him crazy called him a nut
[56:21] right why hear ye him other said these
[56:25] are not the words of him that have the
[56:26] devil
[56:27] can the devil open eye the eyes of the
[56:30] blind
[56:31] jesus comes along and he preaches amen
[56:33] even talking about unless you eat my
[56:35] flesh and drink my blood and everything
[56:37] else
[56:37] and they thought he was crazy why
[56:41] because he was just a humble carpenter
[56:43] son mary and joseph
[56:46] amen he was born in such a humble way
[56:48] come in such a humble way until they
[56:50] could not recognize it
[56:52] but i mean knows that he was rejected
[56:55] most of the time their nuts are rejected
[56:57] they don't accept them just like they
[56:59] didn't
[57:00] today let me tell you something
[57:05] it's going to be quite the judgment is
[57:07] going to be quite something
[57:10] isn't it for this generation of people
[57:12] who were in the prophet of god's
[57:14] meetings and saw
[57:15] the messiah come down jesus come down in
[57:18] the holy ghost form and discern the
[57:19] thoughts and tense of the heart
[57:22] time and time and time again and then to
[57:25] put him out
[57:27] it's going to be a day of reckoning amen
[57:34] so even jesus was called mad along comes
[57:37] paul how many knows that paul also
[57:40] was called crazy he also was called a
[57:43] nut
[57:45] or in acts 26
[57:49] acts 26 we'll begin with verse 19.
[57:53] it says whereupon king agrippa i was not
[57:56] disobedient unto the heavenly vision
[57:58] but showed first unto them of damascus
[58:01] and at jerusalem
[58:03] and throughout all the coasts of judea
[58:05] and then to the gentiles
[58:07] that they should repent and turn to god
[58:10] and do works meet for repentance for
[58:13] these causes the jews
[58:14] caught me in the temple and went about
[58:16] to kill me having therefore obtained
[58:18] help of god i continued unto this day
[58:21] witnessing both to the small and to the
[58:22] great saying none other things
[58:24] then those which the prophets and moses
[58:27] did
[58:27] say should come that christ should
[58:30] suffer
[58:31] and that he should be the first that
[58:34] should rise from the dead
[58:35] and should show light unto the people
[58:38] and to the gentiles
[58:40] and as he does speak for himself festus
[58:42] said with the loud lights
[58:44] paul died beside thyself much learning
[58:47] has made me mad
[58:51] huh you're mad paul
[58:54] you're not but what was it
[58:58] this nut here brought the message in the
[59:01] gospel
[59:02] from the jews to us gentiles
[59:06] and that right pull us right into the
[59:08] presence of god
[59:10] amen what people call foolish
[59:14] and fools nuts and crazy
[59:18] god calls grace amen
[59:23] praise the lord let me just say this in
[59:26] closing
[59:27] let's read over and as i was saying
[59:30] there's two factions there's
[59:32] now we know that even we as people we as
[59:34] human beings
[59:35] all of us we we have a lot of diversity
[59:38] a lot of differences
[59:39] a lot of different ways perhaps that we
[59:41] do things families can be different
[59:45] families do difference we're taught
[59:47] different by our parents a lot of times
[59:49] and because of that sometimes it causes
[59:51] friction
[59:52] sometimes we'll think them people are
[59:54] odd you know
[59:55] oh my we each and every one of us are
[59:58] like man if it isn't done the way i
[59:59] think it ought to be done it ain't done
[1:00:01] right
[1:00:03] you know and that's where we let go you
[1:00:04] know it's just you know
[1:00:06] it doesn't work too good but when you
[1:00:08] come into the body of christ let's let's
[1:00:10] see what paul said
[1:00:11] because i don't believe that in the body
[1:00:13] of christ we're not a bunch of crazy
[1:00:15] people to each other we're not a bunch
[1:00:16] of nuts to each other
[1:00:18] and then when you say like i believe
[1:00:20] that acts 2 38
[1:00:21] it's the way to come to christ we can't
[1:00:24] say amen to that brother
[1:00:27] there's one lord one faith one baptism
[1:00:30] amen but there's one body
[1:00:32] one church and it's not because you amen
[1:00:34] shook my hand or joined
[1:00:36] evening like tabernacle but there's only
[1:00:37] one body and you have to be baptized
[1:00:40] into that body
[1:00:41] by the holy ghost it makes us one
[1:00:44] amen it brings us together when we get
[1:00:47] the holy ghost how many knows there's
[1:00:48] one thing
[1:00:49] that like i said earlier amen that
[1:00:52] actually
[1:00:52] wells and absolutely glues us together
[1:00:55] and i want to tell you right now
[1:00:57] that's what keeps a family together it's
[1:00:59] what keeps a church together
[1:01:00] it's what keeps friends together is the
[1:01:04] love of the lord jesus christ
[1:01:06] now how many knows that god tried to
[1:01:09] glue the whole world together
[1:01:11] amen by saint john's saint john 3 16 god
[1:01:14] so loved the world that he gave his only
[1:01:15] god son
[1:01:16] and whosoever should believe him should
[1:01:18] not perish but every blessing
[1:01:20] he tried to reach out and this
[1:01:22] generation and the signs and the wonders
[1:01:24] that he did world over
[1:01:26] he tried to get the pentecostals and the
[1:01:28] baptists and the methodists and all of
[1:01:30] them
[1:01:30] we all know that in the in around 1960
[1:01:34] 1962 1963 you know
[1:01:36] right in that timeframe he would try to
[1:01:37] get them all together and cause them all
[1:01:40] to be glued together by the love of god
[1:01:42] because that's the only thing that will
[1:01:44] overrule
[1:01:46] your differences and your oddness to
[1:01:49] each other
[1:01:50] it's the holy spirit in your heart it's
[1:01:52] the only thing that'll do it
[1:01:54] nothing else will do it if it isn't
[1:01:57] there
[1:01:57] you're not going to be glued together
[1:01:59] amen
[1:02:00] there's one quote that i thought of back
[1:02:02] there that i want to just mention here
[1:02:05] brother bam says when you separate from
[1:02:06] divine love then you can't overlook your
[1:02:09] brother's mistakes or his faults or his
[1:02:11] differences in that right
[1:02:12] can't overlook him anymore you gotta
[1:02:14] bawl him out for it that's right you
[1:02:16] can't overlook your sister's mistakes no
[1:02:17] more
[1:02:18] because you've gotten away from the
[1:02:19] divine part that love part
[1:02:22] but if you really love the lord jesus if
[1:02:23] your sister or brother does something to
[1:02:25] you
[1:02:25] that's all right they didn't mean to do
[1:02:27] it i mean those love covers a multitude
[1:02:30] of sins now how many knows that the
[1:02:33] opposite of love is what
[1:02:36] hate right hate will cause you to
[1:02:41] magnify each other's differences and and
[1:02:44] really it tears
[1:02:47] nations apart in
[1:02:51] it's tearing our nation apart right now
[1:02:53] but we know that they refused love
[1:02:55] they refused god now god gives them hate
[1:02:59] and as a result of hate amen you have
[1:03:01] people that absolutely hate each other
[1:03:05] amen and it's a sad
[1:03:09] sad thing amen because it tears it rips
[1:03:13] apart it's like taking a piece of cloth
[1:03:15] and just shredding it
[1:03:17] i mean if you lose the holy ghost it's
[1:03:20] so easy to have a falling out with your
[1:03:22] brother or your sister
[1:03:26] they did they did this they did that you
[1:03:28] know you know there you go
[1:03:31] but the love of god goes way beyond that
[1:03:34] realizing hey you know i'm not perfect
[1:03:36] either what if god wrote you off
[1:03:38] every time you made a mistake or you did
[1:03:41] something wrong
[1:03:42] so i don't know about you but i didn't
[1:03:43] believe that what the church of god what
[1:03:45] we all need more is the love of god in
[1:03:47] our heart
[1:03:48] it wells us together and it causes us to
[1:03:50] do like paul did here in closing
[1:03:52] he says in first corinthians
[1:03:57] he says you know now i beseech you
[1:03:59] brethren by the name of the lord jesus
[1:04:01] that you all speak the same thing and
[1:04:04] that there be no
[1:04:05] divisions among you amen
[1:04:09] the world sure there's a separation
[1:04:11] there's a division
[1:04:12] between a believer and unbeliever
[1:04:14] there's a division between a
[1:04:16] make-believer and a believer
[1:04:18] and certainly like paul said earlier
[1:04:20] don't be unequally
[1:04:22] equally yoked together with unbelievers
[1:04:24] for what fellowship has
[1:04:25] light with darkness and so forth but you
[1:04:27] when you're in the
[1:04:28] whole same holy spirit he says there be
[1:04:31] no divisions among you
[1:04:32] but that ye be perfectly joined
[1:04:35] together in the same mind
[1:04:38] and in the same judgment
[1:04:42] for it has been declared upon you my
[1:04:44] brother by them which are of the house
[1:04:46] of chloe
[1:04:46] that there are contentions among you
[1:04:49] amen why because they were still
[1:04:51] nitpicking about their little difference
[1:04:53] one is a paul one is of this one
[1:04:56] all the little differences that the love
[1:04:59] of god's supposed to take care of
[1:05:01] and the division and all the things that
[1:05:04] makes
[1:05:05] people seem odd to each other it all
[1:05:08] goes by the wayside
[1:05:09] i mean he believes there's none of that
[1:05:10] in the body of christ god bless you
[1:05:13] tonight stand with me
[1:05:14] musicians if you'll come
[1:05:24] i mean loves the lord
[1:05:30] i mean loves each other
[1:05:31] [Applause]
[1:05:33] how many knows it makes me love
[1:05:35] everybody
[1:05:36] makes me love everybody makes me love
[1:05:39] everybody it's good enough for me
[1:05:44] give me that old time religion

[1:05:55] i think we're just a key down aren't we
[1:05:58] it's the
[1:05:59] old time holy spirit and the devil won't
[1:06:03] go
[1:06:04] near it that's the reason people
[1:06:07] fear it and it's good enough for me
[1:06:11] give me that old-time religion
[1:06:15] give me that old religion gave me that
[1:06:19] old-time religion
[1:06:22] it's good enough for me
[1:06:25] it will make me love
[1:06:28] but it makes me love everybody
[1:06:32] makes me love everybody
[1:06:36] it's good enough for me it will
[1:06:39] me all right i'm messing it up really
[1:06:42] good again
[1:06:43] amen let's go to one of the verses
[1:06:47] it's so good that i want no other for it
[1:06:51] makes me love my brother and it brings
[1:06:55] things from undercover
[1:06:57] it's good enough for me so give me that
[1:07:01] old-time
[1:07:02] religion give me that old-timer legend
[1:07:06] give me that old
[1:07:08] time religion it's good enough for me
[1:07:13] it will make you stop your life
[1:07:16] it will save you when you're dying
[1:07:20] it will start the devil flying
[1:07:23] and it's good enough for me give me that
[1:07:28] now worship the lord
[1:07:31] [Applause]
[1:07:32] give me that old-time religion
[1:07:36] it's good enough for me but it's the
