[30:18] amen the book of acts
[30:28] the 16th chapter acts 16.
[30:41] and verse 25 and at midnight
[30:45] paul and silas prayed and sang praises
[30:48] unto god and the prisoners heard them
[30:52] and suddenly there was a great
[30:54] earthquake so that the foundations of
[30:56] the prison were shaken
[30:58] and immediately all the doors were
[31:00] opened
[31:02] and everyone's bands were loosed
[31:05] and the keeper of the prison awakening
[31:08] out of his sleep and seeing the prison
[31:10] doors open
[31:11] he drew out his sword and would have
[31:13] killed himself supposing that the
[31:14] prisoners had been fled
[31:17] but paul cried with a loud voice saying
[31:20] do thyself no harm we are all here.
[31:23] then he called for a light and sprang it
[31:25] and came trembling and fell down before
[31:27] paul and silas
[31:29] and brought them out and said sirs what
[31:31] must i do to be saved and they said
[31:33] believe on the lord jesus christ
[31:35] and thou shalt be saved and thy house
[31:38] may god add his blessings to the reading
[31:40] of the word you can be seated tonight
[31:43] amen tonight i want to talk about being
[31:46] privileged
[31:48] privileged amen being privileged
[31:51] amen so that's what we want to focus on
[31:54] and i really kind of had a hard time
[31:55] figuring out just which way
[31:57] what i wanted to uh title this you know
[32:01] but
[32:02] that's about the best that i could come
[32:03] up with amen
[32:05] talk about having an attitude of
[32:07] gratitude amen
[32:08] i believe in this hour that we're living
[32:10] in and we know that
[32:12] gross darkness is upon the earth amen
[32:14] how many believes that
[32:16] we're living in a world of darkness and
[32:18] i
[32:19] thought about this scripture here when i
[32:22] begin to
[32:22] have this message kind of come to me
[32:24] about paul and silas about midnight
[32:27] you know and we know that uh we're
[32:29] living also in a midnight hour
[32:31] i mean he knows that but bam said when
[32:33] he was here
[32:34] i guess back in the 50s or 40s or
[32:37] whatever way back then talked about how
[32:38] that science has said that
[32:40] we're like three minutes to midnight
[32:42] amen
[32:43] and so you know we're in a very very
[32:46] dark hour
[32:47] amen and i got to thinking about that
[32:49] darkness and how much darkness that we
[32:51] really have around us and
[32:52] paul here of course we know we use this
[32:55] as an illustration
[32:57] many different messages and things could
[32:58] be brought from this
[33:00] just from what we have read whether it
[33:01] was the plan of salvation
[33:03] amen about what must i do to be saved
[33:06] amen the simplicity of salvation
[33:08] comes out of this little scripture that
[33:10] we read amen believe on the lord jesus
[33:12] christ you know not join church and do
[33:14] this that or the other
[33:15] simply believe on the lord jesus christ
[33:17] thou shalt be saved and so forth but
[33:19] what i want to draw from it tonight is a
[33:21] little bit more has to do with
[33:23] the condition that paul found himself we
[33:26] know that they were in prison they were
[33:28] in
[33:28] chains it was the middle of the night
[33:31] and it could have been
[33:32] what we would call a uh
[33:36] the lowest of low for him a really bad
[33:39] place
[33:40] you know to be have been thrown in jail
[33:43] and the stalks put on your feet and your
[33:45] hands and so forth
[33:46] be there in the middle of the night but
[33:48] yet they found
[33:49] something in themselves to sing about
[33:54] something to praise god about amen
[33:57] something and you know let me see here
[34:01] all right yeah they begin now
[34:04] and i thought about this i began to
[34:06] think about this and i'll go ahead and
[34:07] just kind of
[34:08] uh mention this here we'll get into this
[34:10] for just a few minutes
[34:11] if we can for perhaps now i want to talk
[34:14] to you first about
[34:15] the ingredients the ingredients to a
[34:18] healthy happy life
[34:21] amen a diet and how many knows you
[34:24] uh there's things that you can do that
[34:26] really drag you down
[34:27] there's things that you do that is not
[34:29] good for you but
[34:30] the ingredients i want to talk about
[34:32] this with just this
[34:34] a little thought here with paul and
[34:36] silas
[34:37] you know and i believe that one of the
[34:39] ingredients and that we have to have
[34:42] amen and we have to have a lot of first
[34:44] of all the first
[34:45] ingredient in our life that we have to
[34:48] have to have a healthy happy life
[34:50] amen how many knows what that first one
[34:52] might be anybody can guess
[34:56] that's one of them there you go first
[34:59] very good amen that's a good answer the
[35:02] very first thing you got to have in your
[35:04] life
[35:04] is god how he believes that
[35:07] because even jesus said that without me
[35:10] you can do nothing
[35:12] there's nothing any good you can't do
[35:14] anything without god
[35:16] amen if the world could just realize
[35:19] that
[35:20] that is the ingredient that god put in
[35:23] the center of our hearts
[35:25] to begin with he left a void there isn't
[35:28] that right
[35:29] because he meant that place to be filled
[35:33] he meant for something to be in that
[35:35] place in that heart and that
[35:37] is that was a room for himself
[35:40] so that he could be in the throne room
[35:45] because how many know that's the throne
[35:46] rune of almighty god you know because
[35:49] the pharisees were bickering with jesus
[35:51] and saying you know
[35:53] uh you know we we just don't like the
[35:54] way the disciples they don't even wash
[35:56] their hands and so forth and
[35:58] complaining about the way they did and
[36:00] jesus went to tell him you know it's not
[36:02] what you eat and what goes in the mouth
[36:04] that defiles a man but it's what comes
[36:06] out
[36:07] he identified the throne room for out of
[36:10] the heart
[36:11] come this and heart of the heart come
[36:13] murderers and
[36:14] and all of these things the problem is
[36:17] with the heart
[36:19] and i'll tell you what anybody can we
[36:21] say it i'm sure i'll get a good healthy
[36:23] amen
[36:24] on this and anybody that doesn't have
[36:27] god
[36:27] is not gonna have true joy
[36:31] they're not gonna have a healthy life
[36:34] folks we people listen i don't care amen
[36:38] if we are how faithful
[36:39] we are to church or whatever it might be
[36:41] amen unless god is in there
[36:44] you're still just going to be as empty
[36:46] as if he wasn't in church
[36:48] call yourself a christian we all believe
[36:50] that but if that
[36:52] if god isn't in there amen you're just
[36:54] as empty you still have
[36:56] do you don't have the right ingredient
[36:58] and that's what paul had
[37:00] one thing that paul had he didn't have
[37:03] nothing else
[37:04] he had been stripped of everything he
[37:06] didn't own anything
[37:07] amen and here he was in prison in a very
[37:10] dark place
[37:14] and that's where this world is it's in a
[37:16] very dark place
[37:19] that right you and i are getting into
[37:22] that dark place
[37:23] and that forgive me for changing my
[37:25] thought for just a second but you know
[37:27] if i'm not wrong whenever the angel
[37:29] painted the layout of ch
[37:32] age back over here it's actually on the
[37:34] billboard it's actually here
[37:36] i don't know if you can follow me or not
[37:38] mike or whatever but anyway right here
[37:40] this layout
[37:41] see if you'll notice that this age was
[37:44] actually
[37:44] completely blacked out
[37:47] he said to put a little sliver of light
[37:49] in it didn't he
[37:50] and i don't know why that one doesn't
[37:52] have it but this is the hour this is the
[37:54] age
[37:55] that it actually becomes completely
[37:58] black
[38:01] completely dark
[38:05] amen we want to talk about what the
[38:07] darkness
[38:08] is what light is and so forth in a
[38:10] little bit amen but
[38:11] uh you know we're living in an hour and
[38:13] i and can we just say this i
[38:15] you know if i understand it right okay
[38:19] that when that complete darkness comes
[38:22] all right it's be when the holy spirit
[38:26] is lifted from the world amen amen
[38:29] because
[38:29] as long as god is here you're going to
[38:31] have light here
[38:32] but when the holy spirit leaves us
[38:34] gentiles isn't that right
[38:36] that's when it completely blacks out
[38:42] then it's when things are really going
[38:44] to get bad
[38:46] and listen you know we're a privileged
[38:49] people i want to preach about privilege
[38:51] because
[38:51] the fact that you can have god is a real
[38:55] privilege
[38:59] people aren't going to realize the
[39:00] privilege that they had
[39:02] until they can't get it because when
[39:05] they completely blacks out
[39:07] they will call and deal one god but he
[39:09] won't be there
[39:10] for him huh
[39:14] now you talk about real bad that would
[39:17] be real bad
[39:20] oh my so in the next one let me just go
[39:24] on the next one
[39:25] but first of all you got to have god
[39:27] amen because without god you
[39:29] can do nothing the next important thing
[39:33] if you want to be a healthy christian
[39:37] how many wants to be a healthy christian
[39:40] who wants to be a better christian
[39:42] want to be a stronger christian
[39:45] what did brother branham say read your
[39:48] bible and pray
[39:49] more that's the only way you'll get
[39:52] stronger
[39:54] the next is prayer that i got wrote down
[39:56] here because it's very important
[39:58] that if you are a strong christian it's
[40:00] because that you have an
[40:02] intimate deep relationship with jesus
[40:04] christ
[40:07] you talk to him a lot you're friends
[40:11] huh if he's your friend it's going to
[40:14] mold you it's going to shape you it's
[40:16] going to make you what you ought to be
[40:19] and there's something that brother
[40:20] brandon what did brother baby say about
[40:22] prayer
[40:26] that's right brother tom you can't do it
[40:28] enough right you can't never pray too
[40:30] much
[40:32] amen so it's something that you can't do
[40:34] too much is talk to the lord
[40:37] sometimes i don't quite pray like i
[40:39] should and i'll think about going down
[40:40] the road hey
[40:41] if i'm driving i don't mind talking the
[40:43] lord anywhere i get a chance to talk to
[40:45] the lord it's always in season
[40:48] to talk to the lord so if you
[40:52] want a good strong healthy christian
[40:54] life you have to pray
[40:56] a lot the more you pray the more you're
[41:01] going to be stronger in the lord
[41:03] it's absolute necessity and a question
[41:06] you start slacking on your prayer life
[41:08] and every other portion becomes
[41:10] unimportant to you
[41:12] you get away from god
[41:15] again the next of course i wrote in here
[41:18] is church
[41:20] i may believe that church is important
[41:24] and we would almost almost
[41:27] want to meet amongst the coronavirus
[41:31] because we don't want to quit church
[41:35] huh it hurts us to have the cancer
[41:38] church and stay at home
[41:41] we might do it if we know and truly
[41:43] believe that it would save life hello
[41:46] yeah i don't have a problem with
[41:48] actually doing it if you know if we
[41:50] need to but it hurts you know we don't
[41:52] really want to do it because we love to
[41:54] fellowship
[41:56] how many bleeds believers love the
[41:59] fellowship around the word of god
[42:01] and that we love to be able to go out
[42:03] back and shake each other's hand
[42:06] amen and to see each other
[42:10] i mean i was kind of studying this
[42:12] afternoon and amen i was thinking boy it
[42:14] seems like a long time since sunday i'm
[42:17] ready to go back to church again
[42:20] huh how many believes that's the way it
[42:23] ought to be with everyone
[42:25] oh man it's been half a week i ain't
[42:27] seen none of the believers i'd like to
[42:28] see him again
[42:30] i'd like to get around and fellowship
[42:32] around the world
[42:34] church is an important part of a strong
[42:38] christian walk with the lord why
[42:41] because you feed on the word how many
[42:44] knows you feed on the word
[42:45] you get fed at the house of god
[42:50] if you don't eat you're gonna get skinny
[42:54] you're gonna get weak if you don't eat
[42:56] and that's where we come together the
[42:58] house of god not only to eat but
[43:00] also to fellowship one with another
[43:03] that's why we don't just like to have to
[43:06] jump in our car and go right away we
[43:08] like to be able to talk to each other
[43:09] and shake each other's hands if at all
[43:11] possible
[43:13] now right
[43:16] amen i believe it amen and i know in
[43:20] this time
[43:20] and during this time we have to be
[43:22] careful about all of that because
[43:24] you know they're having the social
[43:25] distances i've i'm like brother blind i
[43:27] guess i heard about brother brian
[43:29] you know yeah and he don't want no man
[43:31] he don't want to wear no mask
[43:34] is that right pretty staunch about have
[43:36] you worn one yet
[43:38] he ain't that horrible congratulations
[43:41] i couldn't quite do it because you know
[43:44] uh
[43:44] i i you know but i i carry them i don't
[43:47] care of them whenever i go into a
[43:48] business you know
[43:49] i know about you but i gotta have my
[43:50] milk you know i love my milk and i'm
[43:53] going to wear a mask for milk
[43:56] or whatever you know and so anyway i
[43:58] don't know where i'm going with this
[43:59] maybe it's getting a little carnal here
[44:01] but
[44:01] you know and anyway you think about it
[44:03] you know we don't want to do this but
[44:05] if it means you know they like the
[44:07] social network because of it
[44:09] and you know the thing of it is is we
[44:11] used to not think perhaps that this was
[44:13] real serious but
[44:15] we know like was historic he takes it
[44:17] well and it's really struggling it can't
[44:19] be real
[44:21] amen bad certainly don't vote for
[44:22] politicizing all of this but i do
[44:24] believe
[44:25] that you ought to take precautions amen
[44:28] and so anyway
[44:29] all right well let's get off of that so
[44:31] praise the lord anyway
[44:32] i didn't want to really either but i
[44:34] kind of gave in for that just
[44:35] you know to go into the places and so
[44:37] forth i don't know what you do but
[44:39] anyway
[44:40] they're pretty they're i would say that
[44:41] they're pretty lenient you know if they
[44:42] don't throw you out
[44:44] because you won't then hey you're all
[44:46] right you know
[44:47] because they can't do that you know they
[44:50] can't make you wear one but they can
[44:51] throw you off
[44:53] amen and the law supposedly can't uh
[44:56] arrest you
[44:57] for not wearing one but if you get on
[45:00] their property and they tell you to
[45:01] leave you
[45:02] i've been told that that's where you
[45:04] cross the line because your
[45:05] criminal trespassing for anybody tells
[45:07] you to get off their property
[45:09] so just so you all know we don't want
[45:10] nobody arrested here
[45:13] all right praise the lord so now let's
[45:15] just look at this a little bit
[45:17] listen brother bam says let's talk about
[45:19] this darkness a little bit because
[45:21] and as i got to thinking about this i
[45:22] think about
[45:24] all of the negative
[45:27] all of the darkness because how many
[45:29] knows everything negative
[45:31] is darkness that's why everything
[45:34] negative is darkness
[45:36] you know and you have so much of it you
[45:38] have so much a lot of it
[45:40] and even even this let me just kind of
[45:41] say this that we can come up here and we
[45:44] can preach about
[45:45] this is the end of the world the world
[45:47] is ending the economy is collapsing
[45:49] there is no hope for this world it's
[45:52] doomed huh sure
[45:56] that's all true but i don't know about
[45:58] you but that's not all i want to hear
[46:01] huh if we just constantly preach the
[46:04] negative the negative or the negative
[46:07] why
[46:07] why can't get you down wouldn't it kind
[46:10] of depress you it'd be as bad as
[46:11] watching the news all the time
[46:14] i wonder how many hands would go up that
[46:16] would say you know i have cut back on
[46:19] watching the news because it just gets
[46:21] to me
[46:25] yeah i cut back a little bit i think it
[46:28] was uh
[46:28] michael tidwell he says he says he'll
[46:30] only allow himself for three times a day
[46:34] that's silk quite often you know most of
[46:36] the time people will get up after coffee
[46:38] you know and they'll look at the news
[46:40] and the weather or whatever
[46:42] on your app you know watch you know fox
[46:44] news i'm sure everybody looks at fox
[46:45] news and not all of them
[46:47] i better put that right there now but
[46:49] anyway
[46:51] you have your coffee you have your news
[46:53] and you have your weather you know and
[46:55] hey that's good for the day i know what
[46:57] the weather's going to be i know half of
[46:59] what's going on around in the world but
[47:01] you know if you even that
[47:02] is so negative that you don't want to
[47:05] watch it all the time because it is so
[47:07] negative
[47:08] we could be negative we could preach
[47:10] this negativity
[47:11] until man it would be depressing
[47:14] and if all i ever told you that the
[47:16] world's going to end and there's no hope
[47:18] for this world why it'd be
[47:19] a little negative it'd be a little
[47:21] depressing
[47:22] even those those things are true what i
[47:25] thought about what made me happy this
[47:27] week was the thought it was this thought
[47:30] and that is that air is light
[47:33] in the midst of darkness
[47:37] there is a hope in the middle of
[47:40] hopelessness
[47:41] there is still that there there is still
[47:43] that limber that shimmer of light there
[47:45] for us
[47:47] what is that little glimmer of light
[47:49] that little glimmer of light is that the
[47:51] bible has
[47:52] absolutely pronounced that this world is
[47:54] going to burn
[47:55] i heard brother brahm say i believe it
[47:57] was in future home he talked about the
[47:59] volcano that will come up
[48:00] amen and all of those things that will
[48:02] re if the earth will
[48:04] actually renew itself i mean you talk
[48:07] about
[48:07] covering everything up covering it all
[48:10] up and
[48:11] all of that's going to happen but the
[48:12] bible gives us this hope
[48:14] and he gives us this hope and that hope
[48:16] yes that there
[48:17] is only one hope
[48:21] how many know that there is a hope
[48:25] amen and that is the coming of the lord
[48:28] for the believer i'm not worried about
[48:31] the world burning
[48:33] i'm not worried about the world ending
[48:37] 1960 hearing recognizing and acting on
[48:41] the word of god listen to that
[48:43] brother branham covers politics he
[48:45] covers all of these things he called
[48:47] covers the economy and all of that how
[48:49] corrupt and how all of that is at its
[48:50] end
[48:51] i was going to maybe even play a segment
[48:53] of that just to cover that
[48:54] and he covers it all in there but you
[48:58] think about it now that they're still in
[49:00] the midst of it all
[49:01] just like saul or paul just like saul
[49:06] it doesn't matter how dark it gets it
[49:08] doesn't matter how gloomy it is
[49:11] i am thankful that there is light in the
[49:13] middle of it
[49:15] because if there was no light there
[49:17] would be no hope
[49:20] huh there would be nothing but
[49:24] doom and we see the world
[49:27] in doom shape isn't that right
[49:31] but i like what paul said
[49:34] in
[49:39] thessalonians 5 5 he says you know
[49:43] ye are all the children of light
[49:47] and the children of the day ye are not
[49:50] of the night
[49:51] are of the darkness amen how many
[49:55] believe that every individual
[49:58] they either are living by darkness or
[50:01] they're living by light
[50:03] and we have been promised that in the
[50:05] midst of a dark
[50:07] world that we would not have to walk in
[50:10] darkness
[50:12] amen praise the lord
[50:16] now let me go on with just the other
[50:22] one on the ingredients and that is
[50:24] worship praise god
[50:26] and giving thanks how many believe that
[50:28] the christian
[50:29] amen every christian has an
[50:33] attitude of gratitude
[50:37] ain't nobody that likes to live around
[50:39] the negative all the time person
[50:41] and they thankful for anything they got
[50:46] nobody likes to live around the person
[50:47] nobody should you don't want to be
[50:49] that way why is part of the darkness
[50:53] but part of the light of a person and
[50:55] part of an absolute
[50:57] wonderful life is that you have joy
[51:00] unspeakable and full of glory
[51:03] that you worship and that you praise god
[51:06] and you
[51:07] thank god and you worship god
[51:10] and you give thanks you're a thankful
[51:14] person
[51:16] that's an ingredient to healthy
[51:18] christian life
[51:19] and a happy healthy life
[51:22] those are the it's just some of the
[51:23] ingredients and the other one of course
[51:25] is love
[51:26] that i've got wrote down here but that
[51:29] comes part of
[51:31] the light that's on the inside of us
[51:32] maybe we'll pick that up in a little bit
[51:35] all right so i've got rock down here
[51:37] notice
[51:38] blackout amen this world is blacking out
[51:44] amen and when the bride leaves it'll be
[51:47] completely blacked out people will go to
[51:50] church shall seek god they'll ask
[51:52] forgiveness and they'll want god but
[51:54] there won't be no hope
[51:57] it'll be so dark until all might will be
[51:59] terribly dark
[52:01] completely dark
[52:05] amen this coast comes to my mind right
[52:07] now
[52:08] remember brother branham had a
[52:10] blackboard
[52:12] it was all black and he'd take a chalk i
[52:15] believe and put a little dot on it once
[52:17] in a while
[52:18] that right and those dots represented
[52:21] light
[52:22] and that right and those dots represent
[52:25] the believer
[52:27] that is you that little dot is you in
[52:30] the midst of the darkness
[52:34] praise the lord how many believes deny
[52:37] that
[52:38] you are the light of the world
[52:42] you are the only light that people out
[52:44] there will ever see
[52:47] you're the only sermon they'll ever hear
[52:50] because every one of us is a living
[52:52] sermon
[52:55] we are the light of the world
[52:58] amen let me read you a couple quotes
[53:00] here can i
[53:02] oh what a privileged privileged
[53:07] i thought about i don't know just what
[53:09] the definition of privileged is
[53:11] but in my mind to be privileged is to be
[53:15] able to have access to something
[53:18] isn't that right because if you can't
[53:20] get something that you really want why
[53:22] you're not a privileged person
[53:25] amen and as i believe the prophet would
[53:28] say many times you are a privileged
[53:30] person today
[53:31] to be able to accept the lord jesus
[53:33] christ as your savior
[53:35] amen we're privileged people i believe
[53:39] i you know i don't know what the whole
[53:41] world is all maybe there's a better
[53:42] country than what we live in
[53:46] y'all's quiet now right some of shaking
[53:48] heads i don't think so russia
[53:50] no china no
[53:53] huh north korea no hardly any country in
[53:57] the shape that we're in
[53:59] we are probably still the most
[54:01] privileged people
[54:02] on the face of the earth yeah
[54:06] but i say are people thankful for that
[54:09] privilege
[54:10] no they're not thankful people aren't
[54:12] thankful
[54:13] but in the midst of an unthankful world
[54:16] there will be people that are thankful
[54:19] amen so brother bob says it this way oh
[54:23] in this great
[54:24] hour of darkness and chaos
[54:28] over the earth
[54:31] we should be think about it
[54:36] let me just say this each and every one
[54:39] of us here tonight
[54:40] and out there you should be able to say
[54:44] i'm the happiest person in the world
[54:56] that's what you should be able to say or
[55:00] you're living in the category where
[55:02] brother brown said that the people are
[55:04] living below the privileges
[55:08] amen just comes to mind
[55:11] brother dale potter used to call the upc
[55:14] underprivileged children y'all remember
[55:16] that
[55:18] underprivileged children the upc
[55:21] that was pentecostal people that are
[55:23] living below their
[55:24] privileges
[55:28] hallelujah how many believe we're
[55:30] privileged people
[55:32] we don't realize how privileged we are
[55:39] because once you begin to realize how
[55:41] privileged you really are
[55:43] it'll make you happy oh my
[55:47] arch you are thankful that you're that
[55:50] you know the lord that you're privileged
[55:52] to know the lord that's the main one
[55:56] that i can think of
[55:58] is to be one of god's children to know
[56:00] that you
[56:01] are one of god's children
[56:04] because notice paul had lost all things
[56:06] he said i have suffered the loss of
[56:08] all things and i count them but don't
[56:12] strong words that's right for the
[56:15] knowledge
[56:16] of knowing jesus
[56:19] there he was in the inner prison in the
[56:21] middle of the night in stocks and bonds
[56:23] and he was still
[56:24] the happiest person in the world
[56:28] happy singing it said the other folks
[56:32] that he didn't say now silas let's sing
[56:35] a song to the lord
[56:37] but we don't want to wake nobody up so
[56:40] keep it down what you let's just say
[56:44] amazing grace
[56:46] how sweet the sound
[56:52] oh if the bible says the other prisoners
[56:55] heard them
[56:56] i don't know where they were but they
[56:58] begin to sing praise the lord
[57:03] amazing grace
[57:05] hallelujah oh my can you imagine
[57:08] bellowing through that prison house
[57:13] hey be quiet maybe maybe your guard said
[57:16] hey you'll be quiet
[57:17] paul says what you gonna do put me in
[57:19] jail
[57:24] he was already in jail oh what are you
[57:27] gonna do
[57:27] time you up i'm already tied up
[57:31] amen and they begin to sing and the
[57:34] people heard
[57:34] them let me tell you something i believe
[57:37] that your neighborhood i believe your
[57:39] mama your daddy your brother your sister
[57:41] i believe you're workers i believe you
[57:43] both
[57:43] i believe they ought to be able to hear
[57:45] and see the shining light in your life
[57:50] because you're a privileged person and
[57:52] you're happy about being a privileged
[57:53] person
[57:55] amen can i just say what comes to mind
[58:00] it makes you want to take all these
[58:01] people that are not appreciative of
[58:03] their privileges and load them on up on
[58:04] the boat you ought to hear my wife
[58:08] she said oh no no but don't tell them
[58:10] honey don't tell them
[58:11] yeah think about it and take them to
[58:13] where you know maybe they'll be happy
[58:15] somewhere else
[58:17] isn't that right that's right
[58:20] you know i think a lot of that stuff's
[58:22] pretty accurate you know
[58:24] they said one two three or whatever and
[58:26] go in a corner just out of the other and
[58:28] don't spank them you know and they throw
[58:29] the toys at them now they're throwing
[58:31] rocks
[58:33] better bam said they'd go completely
[58:34] insane
[58:36] i believe he's right i mean the prophet
[58:38] was right
[58:39] amen all these things are important the
[58:41] home is important the mother is
[58:43] important weapons are important
[58:45] correction is important praise the lord
[58:49] so he says listen in this ark there's a
[58:51] darkness and chaos over there we ought
[58:52] to be
[58:54] not gloomy huh
[58:57] not all depressed
[59:02] let me just stop here if you're
[59:04] depressed
[59:06] sorrowful and beat down
[59:10] and not with the lord huh because
[59:12] sometimes you can be sad in the lord
[59:15] sometimes you can be going through a
[59:16] trial and you're not so happy
[59:18] huh but you still got that joy down
[59:20] there
[59:22] i mean that's how it is but if that joy
[59:24] is not down there
[59:26] amen in that oh depression and that
[59:29] darkness
[59:30] i want you to know you don't have to be
[59:32] that way you're privileged
[59:34] to be able to go to the lord in prayer
[59:37] how many thankful for the grace of god
[59:39] that if you mess up
[59:40] hey if god wrote you off what a horrible
[59:43] situation you'd be in but we have our
[59:46] privilege to be able to go before our
[59:48] lord in prayer
[59:51] oh my and to rejoice to know
[59:54] all the time when the people are so
[59:57] indoctrinated
[59:59] in indoctrinated and all kinds of isms
[1:00:02] and things in the world
[1:00:03] and yet today the real living god by his
[1:00:07] word and by physical
[1:00:09] evidence shows us that he's here with us
[1:00:15] amen how many please if that's the real
[1:00:18] privileges that we have he says i will
[1:00:21] never
[1:00:22] leave you nor will i
[1:00:25] we're privileged because if he ever does
[1:00:27] you're not a privileged person anymore
[1:00:30] gross darkness will come upon your heart
[1:00:35] if he would ever leave us or forsake us
[1:00:40] amen he's here with us working and
[1:00:43] moving and living
[1:00:45] and acting exactly like he has always
[1:00:48] did
[1:00:49] what a privileged people that we are
[1:00:52] to have this thank you lord
[1:00:56] when i was wondering what was right amen
[1:00:59] you came and showed me the true light
[1:01:03] even jesus says boy you are a privileged
[1:01:06] person if you can see these things
[1:01:08] if you have eyes to see and if you have
[1:01:10] ears to hear
[1:01:11] you are a blessed person
[1:01:14] a happy person brother man says that
[1:01:17] means
[1:01:18] amen i believe it's time
[1:01:23] for revelations 19 where it says let us
[1:01:26] be glad
[1:01:28] and rejoice
[1:01:35] rejoice did you ever see a little kid
[1:01:37] rejoicing
[1:01:40] they get plum happy don't they they just

[1:01:48] rejoicing

[1:02:03] are you doing
[1:02:04] put it back up you're like who in the
[1:02:06] world what's going on
[1:02:09] huh i still think it's funny
[1:02:12] to go down the road and wave wave at
[1:02:14] people see how many a wave
[1:02:16] some will wave back then a time or two i
[1:02:18] didn't think about they went
[1:02:20] by and waved that says hey you didn't
[1:02:22] wave they did oh man i missed that one
[1:02:27] about 50 50. you know and i said that
[1:02:30] one didn't wave she said yeah he did i
[1:02:31] seen his little finger coming up off the
[1:02:33] road i said well praise god it was the
[1:02:34] right one
[1:02:39] you never know nowadays
[1:02:45] all right well praise the lord so now
[1:02:48] notice
[1:02:48] brett brown says did you ever stop to
[1:02:51] think of what a privileged
[1:02:52] people we are at this day did you ever
[1:02:55] stop
[1:02:56] yeah i did this week i stopped for a
[1:03:00] minute and i began to think of what
[1:03:02] a privileged people we are
[1:03:06] amen and i don't you say well brother
[1:03:08] butler you know i
[1:03:10] don't have much i don't own much i don't
[1:03:12] mean that's not what i'm talking about i
[1:03:13] don't care if we're as poor as paul is
[1:03:15] you're still
[1:03:16] a privileged person that ought to be the
[1:03:18] happiest person in the world
[1:03:20] i don't care if you're daniel and the
[1:03:22] lion said or the sheep hebrew children
[1:03:24] fixing to burn in the fire
[1:03:25] you could be the happiest person in the
[1:03:27] world
[1:03:29] why brother brother let me tell you why
[1:03:32] because it's like abraham he says god
[1:03:35] told abraham he said
[1:03:36] i am your portion brother bannon was
[1:03:40] back there
[1:03:40] and a little old trailer of his and he
[1:03:43] had a little typewriter and he got to
[1:03:44] thinking about tommy osborne he got to
[1:03:46] thinking about billy graham and horror
[1:03:48] roberts and how did they have
[1:03:49] these great big buildings and everything
[1:03:51] else and he says here i am lord and a
[1:03:53] little low trailer with a little old
[1:03:55] typewriter
[1:03:56] he's a voice told him but i am your
[1:04:00] portion
[1:04:04] it don't matter how much you got it what
[1:04:06] you got in this world
[1:04:08] if you've got god you've got everything
[1:04:13] you take this whole world and give me
[1:04:15] jesus
[1:04:16] take this all out but give me jesus how
[1:04:19] many is with business more tonight
[1:04:22] you can have it all i just want to make
[1:04:23] sure i got jesus
[1:04:26] because if you got him you got
[1:04:27] everything praise the lord
[1:04:31] what a privilege we are for this day
[1:04:33] living in the closing of this world's
[1:04:35] history
[1:04:36] huh that's where we're living in the
[1:04:38] closing of this world's history but yet
[1:04:40] we're the most
[1:04:41] privileged people and living in a time
[1:04:43] when there's all kinds of ism
[1:04:46] and creates all of these things going on
[1:04:50] and yet in the midst of all that god
[1:04:53] writes in on the waves and confirms his
[1:04:56] word before
[1:04:57] us hallelujah
[1:05:00] i'm thankful for that again oh i'm so
[1:05:04] glad
[1:05:05] that the prophet promised that there
[1:05:07] would be light in the evening
[1:05:10] it is our when it's so dark
[1:05:14] in the world huh doom
[1:05:18] and gloom and to know that we are living
[1:05:21] and
[1:05:22] walking in the light
[1:05:25] praise be the god heart oh but don't
[1:05:27] that make wanna sing that song
[1:05:29] we'll walk in the light such a beautiful
[1:05:33] light
[1:05:34] amen walk where the dewdrops of mercy
[1:05:37] are bright
[1:05:41] come on people i'm getting too happy up
[1:05:43] here it ain't right i need another
[1:05:44] person to fill me up a little more
[1:05:47] huh i'll leave the way to
[1:05:50] be i believe that's what god does for us
[1:05:54] amen all right the light that he
[1:05:57] promised that he would do
[1:05:59] oh my he promised he would do it here we
[1:06:02] are
[1:06:03] the privileged people tonight to enjoy
[1:06:05] these things
[1:06:07] at the end time praise the lord
[1:06:11] hallelujah what is darkness i got wrote
[1:06:14] down here
[1:06:16] what is darkness darkness is sorrow
[1:06:20] no joy all right no joy
[1:06:24] but instead of sorrow god gives you joy
[1:06:27] unspeakable because listen if there was
[1:06:30] no
[1:06:31] christ if there was the holy ghost you
[1:06:33] truly would
[1:06:35] not have that joy i mean believe
[1:06:38] i'm thankful for joy the other one is
[1:06:41] we're living in a dark hopeless world
[1:06:47] we're living in a doomed world
[1:06:51] i mean how many knows there is no coming
[1:06:55] back
[1:06:57] she is going over the falls
[1:07:00] huh she is going down she is going to
[1:07:04] burn
[1:07:06] yeah a doomed world
[1:07:09] that we're living on quite something in
[1:07:12] it
[1:07:13] they've been living on the planet that's
[1:07:15] doomed
[1:07:17] maybe we'd better get down to this
[1:07:18] kennedy space center and think about
[1:07:20] going to mars
[1:07:22] huh that's all they can do maybe get a
[1:07:25] space shape station ready
[1:07:28] uh i heard brother brown talking about
[1:07:30] the fire that's coming
[1:07:31] i think it was the future home he talked
[1:07:33] about those uh
[1:07:34] gases and things that are in those upper
[1:07:36] atmosphere
[1:07:38] he talked about them igniting he talked
[1:07:40] about them even going off
[1:07:42] and burning can you imagine the heat
[1:07:44] that that would create
[1:07:46] is that right so he even talked about
[1:07:48] that
[1:07:50] so my my think about it
[1:07:53] it's going to absolutely be something
[1:07:55] else but yet in the midst of it all
[1:07:58] we can have joy unspeakable because
[1:07:59] because we don't have a kennedy space
[1:08:01] center we have a
[1:08:02] jesus christ spaceship called a
[1:08:05] countdown and that right
[1:08:07] in the gospel ship i'm just glad to be
[1:08:10] in the gospel ship
[1:08:11] yes amen came in the door
[1:08:15] come in the door of the gospel by acts 2
[1:08:17] 38
[1:08:18] got baptized in this jesus name got
[1:08:21] filled with the holy ghost
[1:08:23] i'm sitting here in one of the seats
[1:08:25] that's reserved for me
[1:08:27] i was glad to have reservations on this
[1:08:29] ship
[1:08:30] amen praise the lord all right
[1:08:35] oh my
[1:08:39] i laugh because i think about naturally
[1:08:42] how happy we would be
[1:08:43] if we knew that we was going somewhere
[1:08:45] safe
[1:08:46] just before the destruction and we had
[1:08:48] our seat reserved and we would be
[1:08:50] outside of that ship
[1:08:52] huh we'd be shaking each other saying
[1:08:54] boy are we pleasant oh
[1:08:56] isn't that wonder is that great to know
[1:08:58] that hey we're going to leave this place
[1:08:59] before this thing burns up because it's
[1:09:01] going now
[1:09:02] huh but we hear about leaving the light
[1:09:06] huh we don't quite as excited maybe as
[1:09:08] we should
[1:09:10] all right now i'm not just here to get
[1:09:12] you excited but i'm excited because the
[1:09:13] lord jesus christ is real
[1:09:16] there is truly light
[1:09:20] still in the midst of the darkness
[1:09:24] and i'm here to tell you that sometime
[1:09:26] there will not be light in the darkness
[1:09:29] that light will go out
[1:09:33] be completely black and i want to
[1:09:36] not be here when that happens i believe
[1:09:39] i'm a part of that light i believe you
[1:09:41] are a part of that light that will leave
[1:09:46] amen all right
[1:09:49] so listen that's right a privileged
[1:09:52] people we are
[1:09:54] to enjoy these things
[1:09:57] our heavenly father we are indeed a
[1:09:59] privileged people this morning
[1:10:02] in the face of this changing world
[1:10:07] and we have a hold of the hand
[1:10:11] of the unchanging god
[1:10:14] amen times may change but he's eternal
[1:10:18] and his word is in our heart
[1:10:21] it's the ultimate of our thoughts
[1:10:25] they always drift back to the word no
[1:10:28] matter where
[1:10:29] we stray he says
[1:10:33] it always comes back to the word
[1:10:39] i'm thankful for that privilege that
[1:10:41] whenever you do stray a little
[1:10:44] amen and you can come back to the word
[1:10:46] the holy spirit brings you back
[1:10:48] to the word to keep you on course
[1:10:51] otherwise we would drift out into outer
[1:10:53] darkness
[1:10:54] and chaos and stay
[1:10:58] there amen but it's his mercy
[1:11:02] they always drift back to that word no
[1:11:04] matter where we stray come back to the
[1:11:05] word it's a typos of our heart
[1:11:07] and we're so grateful for that
[1:11:11] amen one more quote now we're just
[1:11:13] gloriously
[1:11:14] and very very thankful for what he has
[1:11:17] done for us the great mysterious hand
[1:11:19] this is the fifth seal
[1:11:20] the great mysterious head of the living
[1:11:22] god what greater thing could be
[1:11:25] how much more of a privileged people
[1:11:28] could would be
[1:11:29] to have the presence of our king
[1:11:33] among us and the king of kings and the
[1:11:35] lord of lords
[1:11:38] what a great honor and what a privileged
[1:11:41] people
[1:11:43] to have him in our midst
[1:11:47] amen how many thankful to have in our
[1:11:51] midst
[1:11:52] amen praise the lord we're how many
[1:11:56] thankful for it
[1:11:59] all right
[1:12:04] let's talk about just in closing
[1:12:08] how that we can be because how many
[1:12:10] believes we truly are the light of the
[1:12:11] world
[1:12:13] jesus said in matthew i've got it there
[1:12:15] he says ye are
[1:12:16] the light of the world and a candle
[1:12:20] that is lit is not to be put under a
[1:12:22] bushel a lie
[1:12:24] a city that is on a hill that's lit up
[1:12:26] it cannot be hid
[1:12:28] that's what you and i are and how are we
[1:12:31] that way
[1:12:32] by not having all of those negatives on
[1:12:36] us
[1:12:36] amen have sin have
[1:12:39] uh unbelief amen
[1:12:44] all those things are things that are
[1:12:47] dark
[1:12:47] they're of the darkness not of the light
[1:12:49] amen
[1:12:51] one of the one of the most listen you
[1:12:54] know
[1:12:54] i thought about well what about the
[1:12:56] negative
[1:12:57] people think about and paul said you
[1:12:59] know all the promises of god
[1:13:02] are yea and amen
[1:13:06] in other words they're positive how many
[1:13:07] beliefs everything about that is
[1:13:08] positive
[1:13:10] the only thing that's not positive
[1:13:14] it's not this it's those who don't
[1:13:17] believe it
[1:13:19] that that's where the negative is that's
[1:13:22] where the darkness is
[1:13:24] that's what a damn nation is those that
[1:13:26] don't believe
[1:13:28] but it's all it's everything positive
[1:13:31] for the believer
[1:13:33] brother bam even said he makes a
[1:13:34] statement he says you know the holy
[1:13:35] spirit
[1:13:36] is never negative the holy ghost is
[1:13:39] there's nothing negative about the holy
[1:13:41] spirit
[1:13:42] nothing oh i could
[1:13:46] i just when you think about what the
[1:13:48] lord has done in your life
[1:13:51] how he forgave you of all your sins i
[1:13:54] put him all in the sea of his
[1:13:56] forgetfulness
[1:13:57] is that right that even even said look
[1:14:01] the judgment that's coming that's wrote
[1:14:03] in the bible you're going to be on the
[1:14:04] other side of it okay
[1:14:06] you're going to be with me in judgment
[1:14:08] judging the world about paul said
[1:14:10] don't you know that the saints are going
[1:14:11] to judge the world
[1:14:14] he took you completely out of judgment
[1:14:16] he took you out of condemnation
[1:14:19] he had a part and that he had a pardon
[1:14:21] wrote for you
[1:14:23] he's actually a pardon for the whole
[1:14:24] world but they don't receive it
[1:14:27] that's what's negative about it because
[1:14:29] then they have to take the condemnation
[1:14:30] that he wrote
[1:14:33] amen they have to they have to be in the
[1:14:36] fire because they didn't accept the holy
[1:14:38] ghost fire they didn't accept the way
[1:14:40] out
[1:14:43] oh think about the yay of god's word
[1:14:47] everything's positive about god's word
[1:14:50] and then when he did save you when he
[1:14:52] did fill you with the holy ghost
[1:14:55] amen just like abraham the first time
[1:14:57] that he lied to that king down there
[1:15:00] isn't that right
[1:15:01] god didn't write him off
[1:15:04] amen god didn't write ever he took lot
[1:15:06] along with him
[1:15:08] he shouldn't have taken his lot of his
[1:15:10] father-in-law and he got into a big
[1:15:12] bunch of fusses and fights and
[1:15:13] everything else and they had to part
[1:15:15] their ways
[1:15:16] but god didn't write him up for it no he
[1:15:18] worked with him he taught him and he was
[1:15:20] teaching them
[1:15:22] he had grace he was mercy it was a it
[1:15:24] was a what
[1:15:25] unconditional covenant unconditional
[1:15:28] promise abraham i'm gonna do this
[1:15:32] and i believe that is to you and i
[1:15:33] tonight that god's promises
[1:15:35] are unconditional if he has begun to
[1:15:38] walk good work
[1:15:39] in you he is able to perform it
[1:15:45] oh my
[1:15:52] think about it the honor and the
[1:15:55] privilege if he has
[1:15:56] started that work and all of us
[1:15:59] are nature different all of us may rebel
[1:16:03] against god
[1:16:04] more or he may have to work harder on
[1:16:06] some of us
[1:16:08] to get us where we need to be isn't that
[1:16:10] right
[1:16:11] but he got abraham to where he ought to
[1:16:12] be and through life's journey to think
[1:16:15] you know
[1:16:16] the one of the greatest privilege one of
[1:16:18] the things that really
[1:16:19] really i love so much is that you know
[1:16:22] it is not you holding on it's him alone
[1:16:27] he's got his hand on you praise god
[1:16:34] and i'd be long gone i'd be long gone
[1:16:38] if it wasn't for the grace of god
[1:16:41] long gone
[1:16:45] huh no doubt be in the grave already
[1:16:50] huh because that's where the devil puts
[1:16:53] you the first chance he gets
[1:16:55] you serve him won't last all that long
[1:17:00] amen so i thank god for his grace
[1:17:04] i'm sure everybody can say i thank god
[1:17:06] for his mercy
[1:17:07] for his grace and for his hand
[1:17:13] that pulled you and hold you
[1:17:17] mercy said no i'm not gonna let you go
[1:17:22] i'm not gonna let you slip away

[1:18:06] living in a merciless world
[1:18:08] brutal killing and everything else amen
