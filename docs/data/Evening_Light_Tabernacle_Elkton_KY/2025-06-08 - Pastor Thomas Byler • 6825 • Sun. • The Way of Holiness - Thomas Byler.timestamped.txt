[16:54] Amen. Good to be in the house of the
[16:55] Lord this morning. If you could let's
[16:57] just stand before we turn to brother
[17:00] Troy. just have one quick announcement
[17:01] that we wanted to make. Um after after
[17:04] the communion service today, everyone
[17:06] who's planning or a representative
[17:08] especially that's planning to go to the
[17:10] TWWT camp, we need to meet and uh we're
[17:13] trying to work on transportation. So we
[17:14] need to know how many adults, how many
[17:16] children uh to make sure that we have
[17:18] the right number of uh vans or bus or
[17:21] whatever we need to do. So uh please
[17:24] meet with us, don't run off and we'll
[17:25] we'll just kind of get together. There
[17:27] is one thing I do need to announce.
[17:28] There was some confusion over whether or
[17:30] not adults could go to the services. Uh
[17:33] I did text brother Ericson up there and
[17:36] yes, adults are welcome to come to any
[17:38] of the services. Uh they just ask that
[17:40] we prioritize the young people during
[17:42] the day and in the seating which is is
[17:46] obvious. So uh just remember that. But
[17:48] if you're planning to go, please please
[17:50] meet with us after after we have
[17:52] communion today. So let's just bow our
[17:53] heads. We'll open the service in prayer.
[17:56] Heavenly Father, we come before you this
[17:57] morning with grateful hearts, thankful
[17:59] to be in your house once again, Lord.
[18:01] And we just come with expectations once
[18:03] again that you will meet us on the scene
[18:05] this morning. We just ask, Father, that
[18:07] you'll bless our pastor as he's labored
[18:09] and prepared over the word and and and
[18:11] and has stewed over what to bring uh
[18:14] your people, Lord, that would just be
[18:15] edifying and and to draw us close to
[18:17] you, Father. So, we just ask a special
[18:20] anointing and blessing upon him this
[18:21] morning as he delivers the message. And
[18:23] we ask, Father, that you would just move
[18:25] amongst our midst and that we would just
[18:27] be wooed in your presence, Lord, as as
[18:30] the prophet taught us that the mother
[18:31] hen broods over her over her young,
[18:34] Lord. And and just uh may we feel your
[18:36] presence and and the anointing fill us
[18:38] in a way that uh that's just un
[18:41] unmistakably you, Father. We just want
[18:43] to tell you we love you. We appreciate
[18:44] you. and ask that everything to be said
[18:46] and done and and the sang and the songs
[18:48] of worship be to bring honor and praise
[18:51] and glory to you and that it would be
[18:53] pleasing to your ears this morning. In
[18:55] Jesus name we pray.
[18:59] Amen. The children can be dismissed for
[19:02] Sunday school. And if we'll go in our
[19:04] scriptures, we'll go to uh Psalms Psalms
[19:07] 9.
[19:16] Psalms nine.
[19:21] I will praise thee, oh Lord, with my
[19:24] whole heart. I will show forth all thy
[19:26] marvelous works.
[19:35] When mine enemies are turned back, they
[19:37] shall fall and perish at thy presence.
[19:47] Thou has rebuked the heathen. Thou has
[19:49] destroyed the wicked. Thou has put out
[19:51] their name forever and ever.
[20:03] But the Lord shall endure forever. He
[20:05] hath prepared his throne for judgment.
[20:15] The Lord also will be a refuge for the
[20:17] oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.
[20:28] Sing praises to the Lord which dwelleth
[20:30] in Zion. Declare among the people his
[20:33] doings.
[20:41] Have mercy upon me, oh Lord. Consider my
[20:44] trouble which I suffer of them that hate
[20:47] me. Thou that liftest me up from the
[20:49] gates of death.
[20:58] The heathen are sunk down in the pit
[21:01] that they made in the and the net which
[21:03] they hid is their own foot taken.
[21:15] The wicked shall be turned into hell and
[21:18] all the nations that forget God.
[21:28] Arise, O Lord, let not men prevail. Let
[21:31] the heathen be judged in thy sight. Put
[21:34] them in fear, O Lord, that the nations
[21:36] may know themselves to be but men. SA
[21:40] God bless you. May be seated, Brother
[21:41] Brian.
[21:56] Morning, brothers and sisters.
[21:59] I hope you've all had a good week and
[22:03] if you would turn with me to
[22:07] uh John the 14th
[22:10] chapter. You know, I was sitting for a
[22:13] few hours last night and this morning
[22:14] and I was thinking, you know, all across
[22:17] the world this morning and all the
[22:20] mainline churches, Pentecostal churches,
[22:23] they'll be celebrating Acts Acts two.
[22:27] And I was thinking when you think about
[22:31] it, how wonderful that experience is for
[22:35] the believers to be baptized in the Holy
[22:37] Ghost and to have the very life of God
[22:40] in the heart of a believer. And I I was
[22:43] I'll just before I get going, I'll just
[22:45] read a few of these scriptures.
[22:49] uh starting we all starting at
[22:54] about about the ninth verse of the 14th
[22:57] chapter of John and you know I spent a
[23:00] lot of time reading the gospel of John
[23:02] it's one of the gospels that you can you
[23:04] can never read too you know you can
[23:06] never read God's word too much of course
[23:08] that's a known that's a real statement
[23:11] there but um I'll start at this ninth
[23:14] verse and Jesus said unto them haven't I
[23:17] been so long with you that you have not
[23:20] known me, Philillip. He that seen me
[23:22] hath seen the father. How sayest thou
[23:24] then show us the father? And you go, I
[23:27] might be reading a lot here. Believest
[23:29] thou not that I am in the father, and
[23:31] the father in me. The words that I speak
[23:33] unto you. I speak not of myself, but the
[23:36] father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the
[23:39] works. That's the same for us today.
[23:41] It's not us doing it, but it's God
[23:44] possessing our hearts and souls doing it
[23:46] today.
[23:47] You can't do it yourself, but God can do
[23:49] it for you. Believe me, and I am in the
[23:52] Father and the Father in me, or also
[23:54] believe me for the very work's sake. And
[23:56] that's the same for us as a church this
[23:58] morning. When God does something for
[24:00] you, it gives you a foundation. It makes
[24:02] you stable. And you can go the next step
[24:05] and keep working in it. And it goes,
[24:08] "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that
[24:10] believeth on me, the works that I do
[24:12] shall he do also. Greater works than
[24:15] these shall he do because I go unto the
[24:17] father. So Christ, the Lord is setting a
[24:20] principle right here. He's telling these
[24:22] 12 apostles, he's telling them what he's
[24:25] about to do. Could they they didn't
[24:28] really understand it until the day of
[24:30] Pentecost, but until the 40 days before
[24:33] he ascended. But he's given them the
[24:36] word that they can go back to to know
[24:37] that he's telling them the truth and
[24:39] says, "Whatsoever you shall I missed the
[24:42] point. Believe me, for I am in the
[24:44] Father and the Father in me also believe
[24:47] me for the very works sake. Verily,
[24:50] verily, I say unto you, he that
[24:52] believeth on me, and the works that I do
[24:54] shall he do also greater works than
[24:56] these shall he do, because I go unto the
[25:00] Father. And whosoever you shall
[25:03] whatsoever, excuse me, whatsoever you
[25:05] shall ask in my name, I will do that the
[25:07] father will be glorified in the son. And
[25:10] he goes on to say here, if you shall ask
[25:13] anything of my name, I will do it.
[25:15] That's a promise this morning here. And
[25:17] he goes on, if you love me, you will
[25:19] keep my
[25:20] commandments. And I will pray the father
[25:22] and he shall give you another comforter
[25:24] that he may abide with you forever. even
[25:27] the spirit of truth whom the world
[25:29] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[25:31] neither knoweth him but you know him for
[25:34] he dwelleth in you and shall be in you
[25:36] and I was just thinking this morning in
[25:40] a a principle
[25:42] here each of us as individuals in the
[25:45] body of Christ all of us come from
[25:48] different
[25:49] circumstances different areas in the
[25:51] country maybe even different areas in
[25:53] the world and I was thinking but In
[25:56] God's mind, he had an image of us this
[26:00] morning from the foundation of the
[26:02] world. He knew who you were, where you
[26:05] were going to be, and what time you
[26:06] would be on this earth. And I was just
[26:08] thinking how that God could think of me
[26:12] as an individual thousands of years ago
[26:14] and bring about a plan to bring me where
[26:16] I am this morning, to bring me into his.
[26:19] And I was just
[26:22] thinking for 6 thou for 6,000 years he's
[26:26] been dealing with mankind. I was just
[26:27] thinking of all the people before the
[26:30] cross that were looking for the cross.
[26:33] Then all of us that are looking back to
[26:35] the cross this morning, of all the word
[26:38] of God that we have this morning and
[26:39] everything we have, it's all based on
[26:41] what happened on the day of Pentecost.
[26:43] And I was just thinking that God could
[26:45] love us individuals enough that he was
[26:49] willing to split his spirit and put a
[26:51] little bit of himself in each one of us
[26:53] this morning that we would be able to
[26:56] prosper in the day and the age that we
[26:58] live in. And I'll just keep reading here
[27:00] because if I I find it easier as I read
[27:03] God's word
[27:04] that it speaks to you this morning. You
[27:08] can't, you know, I was all the things I
[27:11] also was thinking for the last couple of
[27:14] months, you know, the meetings and all
[27:16] the different ministers and all the
[27:18] different things Thomas and brother Brad
[27:21] have been been
[27:23] preaching. The two things strike ideas
[27:27] really struck me is that you have to
[27:30] have faith and believe and obedience.
[27:33] You got to have both of them. You have
[27:35] to have faith in the word of God and
[27:37] faith in what God has done for you and
[27:40] your experience in the word of God.
[27:42] That's your foundation. And then you
[27:44] have to have obedience to the word of
[27:46] God. And you know the scripture
[27:49] says the believer or the worshipper has
[27:53] to believe that he is God and will and
[27:57] dilig and he will reward him diligently
[28:00] that believes that he is God. And then
[28:02] you go the next thing. Brother Brandham
[28:04] said, "Full obedience to the word of God
[28:07] gives the believer the token, the token,
[28:11] the actual presence of Jesus Christ."
[28:13] You got to have both. You have to be
[28:14] grounded in your life where you have
[28:17] both faith and obedience to the word of
[28:20] God. And it will make you strong. And I
[28:24] I hope I find the right thing. I was
[28:25] sitting there this
[28:28] morning. No, I don't have I have the
[28:31] right one here.
[28:33] I just know myself too well. I'm just
[28:35] one of those kind of people that once I
[28:37] get going, I find it hard to
[28:39] stop. But I was listening to a lot of
[28:42] messages from 1965 where brother
[28:46] Brandham was in the uh Los Angeles
[28:49] meetings and there's several messages
[28:51] that go along with those meetings. And
[28:53] the one thing that really struck my
[28:55] heart about what he was preaching to
[28:57] those people like one in a million and
[29:00] uh proving God, you know, there's a lot
[29:02] of messages that come out of that time.
[29:04] And he, brother Brandham, was hitting on
[29:06] the same things that the ministers the
[29:08] past several months have been trying to
[29:11] hit on, they've been hitting on for us.
[29:14] He's you you have to
[29:17] believe God's word. you you you have to
[29:21] just cast it all aside and reach out in
[29:24] faith and grab the promises of God,
[29:27] whatever that need is for you this
[29:28] morning, and just step out in faith on
[29:31] it.
[29:32] And I I missed my point here this
[29:36] morning. Let me go back here.
[29:40] I'll
[29:46] just as I find out as I get older, not
[29:50] losing myself here this morning, I was
[29:52] just thinking, you know, how dependent
[29:55] as a human being I am on the presence of
[29:57] the Lord in my heart and life. You know,
[30:00] I some most people think I'm probably
[30:03] pretty unemotional type of man. you
[30:05] know, I don't demonstrate emotion, but I
[30:08] just think when I thought of myself
[30:11] years ago that like I was saying, God
[30:13] had a picture of me from the foundation
[30:16] of the earth. And we all, like I said in
[30:18] the beginning, we all come from
[30:19] different areas, but that God could get
[30:22] a hold of me and my family in a place
[30:24] totally away from this church. And you
[30:27] got to think about the foundation that
[30:29] God gives you. So, you know that he's
[30:32] walked with you every day of your life
[30:34] and brought you from one area to another
[30:36] area in your life. And I just think of
[30:38] myself, you all know I'm not from this
[30:41] area, but I was just thinking that God
[30:43] would think of me as just a a boy in
[30:46] Long Island, New York, raised in a
[30:49] Catholic family, all the things I've
[30:51] gone through in my life, that God could
[30:53] love me enough to bring about salvation
[30:55] to my heart and soul one day and to show
[30:58] me this revealed word of the hour. Even
[31:01] though I like some of us, you know, not
[31:04] raised in church. So you could, but not
[31:07] raised in an atmosphere of church,
[31:09] raised basically raised out there in the
[31:12] world, but that God could love me enough
[31:14] to bring his word to me, tell me that he
[31:16] loves me, give me his word and his
[31:19] spirit in my heart and life, and set me
[31:20] about on a walk. And and it really
[31:23] strikes me. It really, it's something
[31:26] that's firm in my heart and life that I
[31:28] know that God did it. It's not something
[31:30] I did, nothing that I that I could ever
[31:34] deserve, but I know that God loved me
[31:37] enough that he would deal with my heart
[31:39] and life. I maybe I don't know where I'm
[31:41] going this morning, but I I was reading
[31:43] this quote this morning. I was reading
[31:45] other things. Um, this is from the
[31:48] Sunday school to this is the idea I had
[31:52] I couldn't find the thing for a couple
[31:55] of weeks ago. And I was thinking these
[31:58] are the notes about it. And what it
[32:01] really strikes to what I'm talking about
[32:03] is you can't manufacture anything. You
[32:06] either are or you're not. You can might
[32:09] maybe fool your friends, fool your
[32:11] parents, fool your pastor. Most of the
[32:13] time you can't fool your pastor if he's
[32:15] an actually god-given pastor full of the
[32:17] Holy Ghost. You're not going to fool
[32:19] him. You might think you are, but you
[32:22] can't you you don't manufacture the
[32:24] fruit of the spirit. You can't
[32:27] manufacture that. You have to put
[32:29] yourself in a position that you that the
[32:32] spirit of Christ takes a hold of your
[32:33] heart and life and then you just live
[32:35] it. It just comes out of your heart and
[32:37] out of your life. Does it make does it
[32:40] mean that we do everything right every
[32:42] day? No, it doesn't mean that. But
[32:44] you're willing to say you're sorry.
[32:46] You're willing to admit you're wrong.
[32:48] You're willing to go to your knees
[32:49] before the Lord and say, "I've made this
[32:52] mistake. I need you to make me better
[32:54] and make me stronger that I might not
[32:56] have the same problem. You know, that's
[32:58] the thing about the Christian
[32:59] experience. It doesn't look in the back.
[33:01] It looks forward. It doesn't worry about
[33:04] what you did in the past or the mistakes
[33:06] you made. It looks forward. Does that
[33:08] mean you should be making those same
[33:10] mistakes every day? No. But you're
[33:12] looking forward to the cross to keep
[33:14] going. And I just wrote this idea. I had
[33:17] some other ideas this morning, but
[33:19] they're just blank now. But it says you
[33:22] bear the as long as you're a
[33:23] spiritfilled Christian, you're going to
[33:25] bear it. As long as the presence of
[33:27] Jesus Christ is in your heart and life,
[33:29] you're going to bear that spirit. You're
[33:31] going to bear that wool like a sheep.
[33:33] You know, and I was just thinking about
[33:35] the world that we live in. You know,
[33:37] Christians really don't want to be
[33:39] sheep. You know why? Because to be a
[33:41] sheep, you have to be wanting to be led.
[33:43] The spirit of the age out there is a
[33:46] defiant spirit out there. It doesn't
[33:48] want to be led. It wants to have its own
[33:50] rights, its own individuality and
[33:53] everything that it does. But the thing
[33:55] about a Christian, it wants to be led.
[33:57] It wants to be led by the word of God.
[33:59] It wants to be led by the spirit of
[34:01] Christ. And it wants to be moved in the
[34:03] direction of glory. It and I was just I
[34:06] just wrote these notes to myself and
[34:09] bear. But you can see in your life and
[34:11] this is the most important thing I found
[34:13] in the mistakes I've made in my life.
[34:16] But you by that spirit that God gives
[34:19] you, you can you can see in your life
[34:21] whether you have it or not. And that you
[34:23] know that I'll just finish with this
[34:25] thought this
[34:26] morning. You have to have that right
[34:28] mind in this in the gospel. You have to
[34:31] have that right spirit. It's really
[34:33] important because in the age that we
[34:34] live in this morning, if if you don't
[34:37] have God's mind in you, you don't have
[34:40] the spirit of Christ, you won't see your
[34:42] faults. God won't be able to deal with
[34:45] you to show you your faults and you'll
[34:47] just keep getting worse every day after
[34:50] day after day. And before you know it,
[34:52] you go to the other side not realizing
[34:55] all the mistakes you made. And I as I
[34:57] was listening to brother Brandham last
[34:59] night, this morning, yesterday, and the
[35:02] days, the thing that really struck me
[35:06] and I was, you know, I'm hearing
[35:07] ministers say the same
[35:10] thing that without the baptism of the
[35:14] Holy Ghost and the spirit of Christ in
[35:16] your heart and in your life, you won't
[35:18] be successful as a believer. You'll keep
[35:20] making the same mistakes, having the
[35:23] same problems, and you'll never keep m
[35:26] you'll never go forward. And I was just
[35:28] thinking and I was also thinking about
[35:32] uh people have been talking about fear
[35:36] having fear. You know a Christian a
[35:40] Bible believing Christian a good
[35:42] Christian soldier when the enemy is
[35:44] trying to be put fear on you know what
[35:46] that's going to make you do? It's going
[35:48] to make you be ready. It's going to have
[35:50] the opposite effect. It's not going to
[35:51] do what the devil wants it to do to you.
[35:54] It's going to make you ready. And what I
[35:56] mean by that, when you think something
[35:58] bad is going to be happen, what is that
[35:59] going to make you do? If you're a good
[36:01] soldier, it's going to make you ready
[36:03] because you're going to pray more.
[36:04] You're going to read God's word more.
[36:06] You're going to depend on Christ more
[36:08] than you're going to depend on your own
[36:10] abilities and solving that problem. And
[36:13] I I simply I'll just simply say it like
[36:15] this without dropping anything. Without
[36:18] Christ in our hearts and lives this
[36:20] morning, we're nothing. without his
[36:23] ability to lead us on this path, it's
[36:26] impossible to be successful in the age
[36:28] that we live in. And you know, there's a
[36:31] lot of needs here this morning. There's
[36:33] a lot of needs, I guess, through all the
[36:35] churches, through all the people in the
[36:37] world. But we all serve a God that's
[36:40] more than able this morning to meet
[36:42] those needs, whatever they are. Brother
[36:45] Josh

[37:10] home. So, if anybody would like to visit
[37:11] her, I know she'd really appreciate
[37:13] that. He may have seen God. God is so

[53:50] just to tell you thank you and we love
[53:52] you, Lord. And we know it's a finished
[53:55] work. Whatever we have need of in our
[53:57] lives, and we bring requests to you,
[53:59] it's because we want to converse with
[54:01] you. We want to have fellowship with
[54:02] you, and we just want to talk with you
[54:04] and commune with you, Lord. And so Lord,
[54:06] we bring the request, the unspoken and
[54:09] those that maybe were written or wasn't
[54:10] written down, but you know before the
[54:12] foundation, and it's a finished work,
[54:14] Lord, and your word declares it. You the
[54:17] the very nature around us declares how
[54:20] awesome you are, Lord. And I was just
[54:22] reading a story this morning where the
[54:24] the molecules of water respond to the
[54:27] word of God with with pleasure, Lord.
[54:29] that a and and and so Lord, we know that
[54:32] everything around us is just pleasing
[54:34] when it hears your word and that's us
[54:36] this morning, Lord. So fill us this
[54:38] morning, Lord. Bless this offering.
[54:40] Bless those who can give and those who
[54:41] cannot. And we just count everything as
[54:44] a finished work this morning. In Jesus
[54:46] name we pray.

[1:06:12] musicians. Amen. Praise the
[1:06:20] Lord. Amen.
[1:06:24] Wednesday evening. There's been a couple
[1:06:25] requests of having a testimony meeting.
[1:06:27] And so I've prayed about it and I'd like
[1:06:30] to uh have this coming Wednesday have a
[1:06:33] testimony meeting. Amen. I know brother
[1:06:35] Eduardo back there. I he'll take as much
[1:06:38] time as you want. He's got some
[1:06:40] testimonies of the Lord of what he's
[1:06:41] done in his life. So Amen. We're looking
[1:06:43] forward to him giving his testimony.
[1:06:45] Amen. And then I told him if we had time
[1:06:47] for others, we'll have time for others.
[1:06:49] Amen. But that'll be this coming
[1:06:51] Wednesday.
[1:06:52] Amen. Praise the
[1:06:54] Lord. Amen. Sister Peggy says, "Thank
[1:06:57] you all for your prayers. I am feeling
[1:06:59] better today and going to feel even
[1:07:01] better tomorrow. Gre greetings to all of
[1:07:04] my family and friends who are in Elkman,
[1:07:06] Kentucky." Let's give her a hand. God
[1:07:08] bless you. Amen. Sister
[1:07:10] Peggy.
[1:07:14] Amen. Hallelujah. So, we are very
[1:07:16] grateful. Amen. That she is doing
[1:07:19] better. Amen. And we want to remember
[1:07:20] Sister Parish in a special way. She has
[1:07:23] a real need of a touch from the Lord
[1:07:25] because that liquid keeps building up.
[1:07:27] Amen. And so we pray that God will send
[1:07:29] down the faith to receive and that he'll
[1:07:32] send down the healing. Amen. That she
[1:07:34] needs. Amen. For a touch from the Lord.
[1:07:36] Amen. So I think those are some pretty
[1:07:39] dire needs there. And so Amen. Praise
[1:07:42] the Lord. Well, Amen. This will be a
[1:07:45] follow-up message after the meetings.
[1:07:47] Amen. And so we uh certainly enjoyed the
[1:07:51] meetings that we had. Amen. I mean, he's
[1:07:53] very very thankful for what the Lord
[1:07:56] did. Amen. In the meetings that we've
[1:07:58] had. Uh and so, you know, we had a lot
[1:08:02] of emotion. Amen. A lot of worship.
[1:08:05] Amen. A lot of times we express
[1:08:07] ourselves. Amen. In that way. So this
[1:08:09] morning we're going to kind of talk
[1:08:11] about emotion for a while. Amen. With
[1:08:12] the help of the Lord. Amen. We're going
[1:08:14] to talk talk about that. Amen.
[1:08:17] Um I this is one of those messages that
[1:08:21] Amen just kind of has been laying on my
[1:08:23] heart. Amen. And
[1:08:26] um it's kind of been a burden on my
[1:08:28] heart. Amen. So Amen. It'll be basically
[1:08:32] one of those messages. Amen. Uh
[1:08:34] something I feel I there's some things
[1:08:36] that I want to say uh to the church.
[1:08:39] Amen. And and I pray that in it all that
[1:08:43] he'll just have his way. Amen. But if
[1:08:46] you will stand with me again, we'll just
[1:08:49] get into the word of God. Amen. First,
[1:08:51] we'll have prayer. O to the author
[1:08:53] first. Lord Jesus, we come before you,
[1:08:55] Lord, this morning, grateful hearts,
[1:08:58] God, to be assembled together once again
[1:09:00] in your name, Lord, knowing that you are
[1:09:03] here in our midst, Lord. Father, you
[1:09:06] have been here in our midst. And we
[1:09:08] believe, God, that you'll never leave us
[1:09:10] nor forsake us. And we're grateful for
[1:09:12] this to know that God, you are leading
[1:09:14] and guiding this church, Lord Jesus.
[1:09:17] You're you are the one that leads and
[1:09:19] guides us, Father. And we're thankful,
[1:09:21] Lord, even as Brother Brian said in
[1:09:22] Sunday school to have that leadership of
[1:09:24] the Holy Spirit in our lives. It's the
[1:09:26] greatest honor and pre privilege that we
[1:09:29] can have. We ask God this morning, Lord,
[1:09:31] as I feel this on my heart, have felt
[1:09:34] this on my heart for some strange reason
[1:09:36] in the last few weeks. I have been
[1:09:38] burdened in a different way than I had
[1:09:40] been in a while. And I still don't
[1:09:42] understand it just right. Understand
[1:09:44] just exactly why. But I do know that
[1:09:46] you'll reveal it to me. And I I just
[1:09:48] want to follow your spirit and your
[1:09:50] leading. And ask God that you'll direct
[1:09:52] me, Father. Lord, direct each and every
[1:09:54] one of us this morning, Lord Jesus, to a
[1:09:56] closer walk with you, a deeper walk with
[1:09:58] you, Father, and help us to understand
[1:10:00] and uh the things that we need to
[1:10:02] understand, Lord. We ask God your
[1:10:04] blessing upon the reading of the word as
[1:10:05] we open it now and try to convey Lord to
[1:10:08] the people what's on our heart and to
[1:10:10] lay out the message you I feel Lord
[1:10:12] you've laid upon my heart to minister
[1:10:13] this morning in Jesus name we ask it.
[1:10:16] Amen and amen. If we'll turn if you
[1:10:20] will go to
[1:10:23] uh first kings first
[1:10:26] kings. Amen.
[1:10:29] And I got a lot of my quotes out of the
[1:10:31] message called What Doest Thou Hear?
[1:10:35] What do thou hear? So if you want to
[1:10:37] listen to that message, Amen. just type
[1:10:39] that in. What do thou hear? Amen. I
[1:10:42] believe it was Elijah. Amen. And I don't
[1:10:46] I've got
[1:10:48] uh Amen. I've got the u the date on
[1:10:53] it. Amen. And I got a lot of them, a lot
[1:10:56] of quotes on my iPad this morning. So,
[1:10:58] hope that'll all go good.
[1:11:00] Amen. That was in 59
[1:11:03] 0301 evening
[1:11:06] 0301. Amen. We'll start with chapter 19
[1:11:10] of First
[1:11:13] Kings. And Ahab told Jezebel all that
[1:11:16] Elijah had done and with all how he had
[1:11:19] slain all the prophets with the sword.
[1:11:22] And then Jezebel sent a messenger unto
[1:11:25] Elijah, saying, "So let the gods do to
[1:11:28] me and me uh and and more also, if I
[1:11:32] make not thy life as the life of one of
[1:11:34] them by tomorrow about this time." And
[1:11:37] when he saw that, he arose and went for
[1:11:39] his life and came to Beersa, which
[1:11:42] belongth to Judah, and left his servant
[1:11:44] there. And but he himself went a day's
[1:11:47] journey into the wilderness and he came
[1:11:49] and sat down under a juniper tree and he
[1:11:52] requested for himself that he might die
[1:11:54] and said, "It is enough, Lord. Oh Lord,
[1:11:57] take away my life, for I am not better
[1:12:00] than my fathers."
[1:12:03] Amen. Amen. Down in verse nine, let's go
[1:12:06] to verse nine. And he came thither into
[1:12:09] a cave and lodged there. And behold, the
[1:12:12] word of the Lord came unto him, and he
[1:12:14] said unto him, "What doest thou here,
[1:12:16] Elijah?" And he said, "I have been very
[1:12:19] zealous for the Lord, God of hosts, for
[1:12:22] the children of
[1:12:23] Israel, have forsaken thy covenant, and
[1:12:25] thrown down thine altars, and have slain
[1:12:27] thine prophets with the sword. And I,
[1:12:30] even I only am left," and they seek my
[1:12:32] life to take it away." And he said, "Go
[1:12:35] forth and stand upon the mount before
[1:12:37] the Lord." and before the Lord. Uh, and
[1:12:40] behold, the Lord passed by, and a great
[1:12:42] strong wind rent the mountains, and
[1:12:45] break in pieces the rocks before the
[1:12:47] Lord. But the Lord was not in the wind.
[1:12:50] And after the wind, an earthquake, but
[1:12:52] the Lord was not in the earthquake. And
[1:12:54] after the earthquake, a fire, but the
[1:12:56] Lord was not in the fire. And after
[1:12:59] that, after the fire, a still small
[1:13:02] voice. And it was so when Elijah heard
[1:13:05] it that he wrapped his face in his
[1:13:07] mantle and went out and stood in the
[1:13:09] entering in of the cave. And behold,
[1:13:11] there came a voice unto him and said,
[1:13:14] "What doest thou hear, Elijah?" May God
[1:13:17] add his blessings to the reading of the
[1:13:19] word. You can be
[1:13:22] seated. Amen. We want to talk about
[1:13:25] first of all, we want to talk about the
[1:13:26] juniper tree uh with the help of the
[1:13:29] Lord for just a minute. Brother Bam says
[1:13:32] here in the quote, he says, 'Now our
[1:13:33] story goes in three different places.
[1:13:35] One, Mount Carmel. The next under the
[1:13:38] juniper tree and the third place God
[1:13:40] meets him. He's in a cave. So, we want
[1:13:44] to talk about those three with the help
[1:13:46] of the Lord for a while and see what we
[1:13:47] can draw from it. Amen. Mount Carmel. Of
[1:13:50] course, we read that over in the sec in
[1:13:52] Kings uh uh first kings 18. And we find
[1:13:57] that Elijah had challenged those 400
[1:14:01] prophets. Amen. To see whose God was
[1:14:04] God. Ain't that right? And said, "You
[1:14:06] make an altar and you offer sacrifice
[1:14:08] and the God that answers by fire, let
[1:14:10] him be God." Ain't that right? And when
[1:14:13] they went and uh begin to offer uh their
[1:14:17] sacrifices and and it says that it came
[1:14:20] to pass at noon that Elijah mocked them
[1:14:23] and said cry aloud for he is a for he is
[1:14:27] a god either he is uh talking or he is
[1:14:31] pursuing or he is in a journey or
[1:14:34] pre-adventure he sleepeth and he must be
[1:14:37] awakened. So Elijah under the anointing
[1:14:40] and under the inspiration actually
[1:14:43] mocked all of those prophets.
[1:14:45] That right? He was way up there in the
[1:14:48] realms of the spirit. Amen. Kind of like
[1:14:51] what we were way up there in the realms
[1:14:53] of the spirit. Amen. You know, brother
[1:14:56] Bam says it this way. He says we know uh
[1:14:59] he says not long ago he says uh Stephen
[1:15:02] Foster, he says my little son sitting
[1:15:04] back there in the building was his
[1:15:05] favoriteite poet. He says, "Many of you
[1:15:07] know Stephen Foster know of him. He gave
[1:15:10] America some of his greatest folk songs
[1:15:12] that they ever had. He was considered a
[1:15:15] neurotic and he wrote my old Kentucky
[1:15:18] home and so forth. That's just a little
[1:15:20] ways from where I live and and and was
[1:15:22] just about 70 miles from where I was
[1:15:24] born." Amen. About two summers ago, I
[1:15:27] visited the old Kentucky home, he says,
[1:15:29] for my first time. And I was sitting at
[1:15:31] the bench or at the desk and he wrote
[1:15:33] that so where he wrote that song, world
[1:15:35] famous. And I was looking at his picture
[1:15:37] where the Saraphim the angel was
[1:15:40] supposed to have touched him to give him
[1:15:42] inspiration to write
[1:15:44] it. And uh the guide and so forth that
[1:15:47] had done left the room and I was sitting
[1:15:49] there and I thought Mr.
[1:15:51] Foster looked like you're an intelligent
[1:15:53] looking man. I thought why what made you
[1:15:56] do what you did? Now, he would write a
[1:15:59] song that he had in his mind, but after
[1:16:01] he'd get through writing a song, coming
[1:16:03] down off of that inspiration, he'd get
[1:16:06] drunk, go out and get it drunk, and
[1:16:08] finally he got into such a place that he
[1:16:10] called a servant, ordered a razor,
[1:16:12] committed suicide, cut his throat.
[1:16:14] Steven Fostner. Amen. Not long ago, I
[1:16:17] stood by the side of William Cooper's
[1:16:18] grave. He wrote, "There is a fountain
[1:16:20] filled with blood drawn from Emanuel's
[1:16:24] veins." Amen.
[1:16:36] and sinners plunged beneath that flood
[1:16:39] lose all their guilty
[1:16:44] saints in London, England. I stood there
[1:16:48] by his
[1:16:50] grave and he laid my hand and and I laid
[1:16:53] my hand over on the tombstone and I
[1:16:55] thought, "God, rest his gallant soul." I
[1:16:58] thought, "Mr. Kalper, why was you
[1:17:02] considered a neurotic?" You know, after
[1:17:05] he wrote that song, there is a fountain
[1:17:07] filled with blood drawn from Emanuel's
[1:17:09] vein. He came out of the inspiration and
[1:17:12] got down, called a cab, went to try to
[1:17:15] find a
[1:17:24] river, to commit suicide, to drown
[1:17:27] himself in the river. William Cooper,
[1:17:30] that's his history right there by his
[1:17:33] grave. I apologize, Michael. Do y'all
[1:17:36] have another one of those little foam
[1:17:38] things or no? or get it off of the other
[1:17:40] one maybe because my lost mind and I
[1:17:42] know it's making her act. Amen. He says
[1:17:45] that's his history right
[1:17:47] there by his grave. Then I remembered
[1:17:51] Jonah the prophet that he was going down
[1:17:54] to Nineveh. Take him a ship to
[1:18:03] Tarsus. Excuse us for a second.
[1:18:10] Let's try that. Thank you,
[1:18:14] Mike. All right.
[1:18:17] Jonah, the inspiration of God fell upon
[1:18:20] him, and he went down and gave his
[1:18:22] prophecy before Nineveh, where God had
[1:18:24] sent him, and they even put sackcloths
[1:18:26] on the cattle and on the hills, and God
[1:18:29] spared that great city. And such
[1:18:32] inspiration. And then he went up and sat
[1:18:35] down uh under a gourd or a tree and
[1:18:37] prayed that God would take his life.
[1:18:40] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. I don't
[1:18:44] know if any of us have ever climbed that
[1:18:45] high in the spirit. Amen. Before, but
[1:18:48] Amen. How many know sometimes Amen. And
[1:18:52] listen to what it says, but it's brother
[1:18:54] Brandon will explain it. And I thought
[1:18:56] of Elijah who went down there by the
[1:18:58] brook kidrth and suffered to fil the
[1:19:00] ravens closed the heavens. He went rain
[1:19:03] then opened up the heavens down there
[1:19:04] brought fire down out of heaven. Amen.
[1:19:06] And when the inspiration left him. Amen.
[1:19:10] By the threat of a woman he ran out
[1:19:11] there in the wilderness. Amen. And
[1:19:13] prayed for God to let him
[1:19:15] die.
[1:19:17] Amen. Amen. That's right. Oh, I could
[1:19:20] just go on and on, my friends. Amen.
[1:19:23] people that were brought under such
[1:19:24] tremendous inspiration from another
[1:19:27] land. Amen. You go out of this world
[1:19:29] somewhere else way up and then when you
[1:19:32] come uh you're up there it's all right.
[1:19:35] Or when you're down it's all right. But
[1:19:37] when you come in between there. See now
[1:19:40] as long as the inspiration was on them
[1:19:42] they were all right. But when the
[1:19:44] inspiration
[1:19:45] leaves what hurts. Amen. How many knows
[1:19:48] we don't never have to have the Holy
[1:19:50] Ghost leave us. Amen. But there is a
[1:19:52] realm that you can climb. Amen. I've
[1:19:55] experienced it many times going to youth
[1:19:56] camp and so forth. Amen. And just oh my,
[1:20:00] you just I I'd be singing all the way
[1:20:01] home and just shouting and praising God
[1:20:04] and and so forth, you know. But then
[1:20:05] there's a you you come down out of that
[1:20:08] and come back to reality and you have a
[1:20:10] maybe kind of depressing, you know. It's
[1:20:12] just it's not the same that isn't always
[1:20:16] that doesn't stay on you all the time in
[1:20:18] that measure.
[1:20:20] Amen. When you come down, you can have a
[1:20:22] juniper tree experience or kind of a the
[1:20:26] blues as you might say. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:28] Especially come in between, he says, now
[1:20:30] if you're you go back, you go back to
[1:20:32] work, you go back to doing the things
[1:20:34] that you usually do, you know,
[1:20:35] everything's all right. But just coming
[1:20:37] out of that, brother Baptist says it's
[1:20:38] that in between time that's really hard.
[1:20:41] He says here, not long ago, standing in
[1:20:43] the meetings and finding so many
[1:20:45] desiring. Now, I'm not sure which
[1:20:46] meetings he was talking about. I do know
[1:20:48] when he was in Arkansas, I believe he
[1:20:50] was, and he preached for like eight days
[1:20:51] straight and so forth that he overdid
[1:20:54] himself. Ain't that right? He overdid
[1:20:56] himself and he had to get off the field
[1:20:58] for a while and so forth. He overdid it
[1:21:00] because he was trying to make up for
[1:21:01] lost time. Standing a meeting find so
[1:21:03] many desiring and I stayed for
[1:21:05] discernment so much and one meeting
[1:21:07] right after another having oh just
[1:21:09] constantly for eight months I couldn't
[1:21:11] get up or down. I stayed right in
[1:21:14] between there. He says, "And you know
[1:21:16] the time was they rushed me everywhere.
[1:21:18] Mayo Clinic said there's no earthly
[1:21:20] chance for him." That's right. Now
[1:21:22] you're up or down. When you get down,
[1:21:25] why you're It seems to be all right. He
[1:21:28] says, "But in between there, that's what
[1:21:31] hurts."
[1:21:32] Amen. Praise the Lord. So, we just
[1:21:35] wanted to share that. Amen. Praise the
[1:21:39] Lord. Amen. There's a couple things that
[1:21:41] I want to share that's kind of off the
[1:21:43] subject, but I feel that I want to share
[1:21:45] it with the help of the Lord. Amen. Um,
[1:21:49] before we get into our main part of the
[1:21:51] sermon, I do have a lot of quotes to
[1:21:53] read this morning. I hope you don't
[1:21:54] mind. Amen. I I really enjoy Amen. what
[1:21:58] the prophet has to say. Amen. Praise the
[1:22:01] Lord.
[1:22:08] Now, um, brother Bam talking about after
[1:22:11] the seals had been opened on questions
[1:22:13] and answers on the
[1:22:15] seals. I think this is where I want to
[1:22:17] go. Yeah, because I've kind of kind of
[1:22:19] got into that already. Meant to bring
[1:22:21] that in, but it's okay.
[1:22:24] Amen. A major prophecy had been
[1:22:27] fulfilled when the seals were open. How
[1:22:29] many believe that? So much so that
[1:22:31] there'd be a lot of people that thought
[1:22:32] that mercy was over because of what he
[1:22:34] said. You know, when those seals are
[1:22:36] broke, then there's no more mercy and so
[1:22:37] forth. He stepped forth and everything.
[1:22:39] There was all kinds of questions people
[1:22:40] had. People had uh questions and so
[1:22:43] forth. And I thought that it was
[1:22:44] significant. I thought it might help
[1:22:46] you, might help me. this morning when I
[1:22:48] when I when I thought about this this
[1:22:50] this quote and this admonition that
[1:22:53] brother Brandham gave to the people at
[1:22:55] that time because people would think
[1:22:57] they were I believe I didn't quote print
[1:22:59] out the uh uh the question but the
[1:23:01] question was asked whether should
[1:23:03] evangelists continue on the
[1:23:05] field even they were asking well you
[1:23:08] know when you see prophecy fulfilled
[1:23:10] such as the pope going over there and
[1:23:12] coming out and when you see the woman
[1:23:13] fulfilled and all these different things
[1:23:15] it's really trying you know It has to
[1:23:17] way a way of kind of you know waking you
[1:23:20] up or shaking you or whatever it does.
[1:23:23] What does it do? The question is what do
[1:23:25] we do in cases like this? And I would
[1:23:26] just want to give you amen what the
[1:23:28] prophet of God said. You know they asked
[1:23:30] should evangelists continue on the
[1:23:32] field. Amen. He says in this hour of
[1:23:34] course what they uh what they mean
[1:23:36] certainly by all means don't change a
[1:23:39] thing. Amen. If Jesus is coming the in
[1:23:43] the morning, preach today like it was
[1:23:45] going to be in 10 years. Amen. Uh in 10
[1:23:49] years from today, but live like it's
[1:23:51] going to be at this very hour.
[1:23:54] Amen. Praise the Lord. And I thought
[1:23:57] about our church here. I thought about,
[1:23:59] you know, uh how good God has been to us
[1:24:01] and how that he has proven himself to be
[1:24:03] with us over the years through many many
[1:24:08] uh brier patches, through many hard
[1:24:10] times, many ups, many downs. And I
[1:24:12] thought of the song Brother Becky sang.
[1:24:15] Amen. Amen. Uh how many times am I going
[1:24:18] to have to prove to you that I love you?
[1:24:20] Amen. How many believes that God loves
[1:24:22] us? God is with us. Amen. And so uh you
[1:24:26] you know and and as the pastor I I I
[1:24:29] just want to I feel led to to tell you
[1:24:31] this the same thing the prophet would
[1:24:33] have said. You know what do you do? He
[1:24:35] says don't change a thing. Keep on going
[1:24:38] the way that you're going.
[1:24:40] How many believe that? Now listen um
[1:24:46] uh but live like it's going to be. He
[1:24:48] says don't get scrubbled up. Now that's
[1:24:50] why I'm trying to warn you about just
[1:24:52] don't be odd and peculiar. Don't change
[1:24:55] nothing. But if you're doing something
[1:24:57] wrong or doing evil, hello. Then yes.
[1:25:00] Amen. Another place he talked about he,
[1:25:03] you know, if you want to go on the other
[1:25:04] side of things a little bit,
[1:25:07] um, you know, in in in
[1:25:10] uh the token and I believe it was it was
[1:25:15] a token, one of them, and I'm forget
[1:25:18] what the other one was, but I know the
[1:25:20] token. He says whatever you do what no
[1:25:22] matter how many religious demonstrations
[1:25:24] he says he says lay us out everything
[1:25:26] else. Amen. Until you have the literal
[1:25:28] life of Jesus Christ in you. How many
[1:25:30] believes that? In other words and then
[1:25:32] another place when he was telling about
[1:25:34] uh uh uh that dimension over there and
[1:25:37] the the people that are in that
[1:25:38] dimension and he says when you get over
[1:25:40] there there's nothing but perfect love
[1:25:42] there. Ain't that right? He says he says
[1:25:45] so whatever you do amen make sure you
[1:25:47] have perfect love. It'll take perfect
[1:25:49] love to put you in that place. Amen. He
[1:25:52] says, and and I don't have the quote,
[1:25:54] but you all remember me quoting it
[1:25:55] before. He says, "Whatever you do,
[1:25:57] change now." He says, "Change. If you're
[1:26:00] not in this way, you need to make a
[1:26:02] change." So, there is a time for a
[1:26:03] change. Amen. If you haven't got what
[1:26:06] it's takes, Amen. to Amen. to go in the
[1:26:09] rapture. Amen. Then you need to change.
[1:26:15] Amen. And I have I have a lot to say in
[1:26:16] that area especially when I think about
[1:26:18] us as a group here as a group here.
[1:26:21] Amen. For the most part, let me say
[1:26:23] this. For the most part, I believe we
[1:26:26] have pretty mature Christians here. We
[1:26:29] have veterans here. And we don't have
[1:26:31] amateurs here. We have fought the devil
[1:26:33] on every on every case in every
[1:26:35] scenario. Amen. I I still have to I
[1:26:38] still personally have to have to look
[1:26:41] out and watch for more weapons that are
[1:26:44] formed against me to come against me
[1:26:47] because as far as I'm concerned, the
[1:26:49] devil has thrown everything in that he's
[1:26:51] got in his arsenal at me at this church.
[1:26:55] Hello. He has. But no weapon formed
[1:26:58] against thee shall stand.
[1:27:01] Amen. No weapon formed against us has
[1:27:04] ever stood. And I'm thankful for that.
[1:27:07] That's God's grace. That's God's mercy.
[1:27:10] Amen. And so I say, "Keep going." Amen.
[1:27:13] Keep going. Whatever you're doing, keep
[1:27:15] going. Keep doing it. Amen. Because I,
[1:27:17] as a pastor, and and I think this is
[1:27:20] part of the burden that I feel is that
[1:27:22] the de the devil would like to change
[1:27:24] things.
[1:27:26] He would He doesn't like it when it's
[1:27:28] going the way it's supposed to be going.
[1:27:29] Amen. And when you're being blessed and
[1:27:31] God is with you and God is blessing it.
[1:27:34] Amen. It's the devil's business to come
[1:27:35] in here and say, "Well, this you
[1:27:37] shouldn't be this way and that shouldn't
[1:27:38] be this way and this that or the other."
[1:27:40] Watch out. Amen. I don't know about you,
[1:27:43] but if you've got a business or anything
[1:27:44] that's being blessed, don't change what
[1:27:46] you're doing. Ain't that right? And if
[1:27:49] you're serving God and we're in the
[1:27:50] center of God's will, don't change what
[1:27:52] you're doing. Keep doing what you're
[1:27:54] doing. Amen. I thought my we shouldn't
[1:27:56] be tell I you you know you know I
[1:27:59] shouldn't have to tell you that you need
[1:28:01] to read your Bible and pray every day.
[1:28:04] Amen. I shouldn't have to tell you that.
[1:28:06] You should be doing that already.
[1:28:09] Amen. Jesus said Jesus said didn't he
[1:28:12] Jesus didn't say get ready
[1:28:15] for the rapture. He said be ready. Be
[1:28:18] ready. How many believe that we aren't
[1:28:20] you know if you're not ready you should
[1:28:22] be getting ready. Yes. But if you you
[1:28:24] ought to be at the place that you are
[1:28:26] ready. Amen. Amen. We ought to be
[1:28:29] walking in maturity. We ought to be
[1:28:31] walking the way that God Amen. is
[1:28:33] pleasing to the Lord. Like Eli uh uh
[1:28:37] Enoch, like Enoch walked, he pleased
[1:28:39] God. Amen. And as a pastor, that's where
[1:28:42] I want to get everybody in here. You
[1:28:43] ought to not be having to repent of your
[1:28:45] little this, that, and the other. You
[1:28:47] ought to be already repentant. You ought
[1:28:48] to be over some of those things that
[1:28:50] you're not over with. Amen. Because why?
[1:28:53] We're in too late an hour now, folks.
[1:28:55] It's time to be ready.
[1:28:58] Amen. To be ready and on guard every
[1:29:00] day. Walking with the Lord. Amen. I'll
[1:29:02] tell you what, I've learned and be I've
[1:29:04] been up on the roof this week working
[1:29:06] hard on the roof and and and I'll tell
[1:29:09] you what, I've had a valley that I had
[1:29:10] to put in and and cutting metal for that
[1:29:13] valley and and trying to figure out just
[1:29:15] how to cut that and everything. And I'd
[1:29:16] pray about every piece. Lord, help me
[1:29:18] not to mess this piece up. Pray before I
[1:29:21] go, Lord, don't let me mess up today.
[1:29:22] Lord, help things go to good. And while
[1:29:24] I'm up there, pray constantly. Lord,
[1:29:26] help me. Help me. I don't know about
[1:29:27] you, but I want the Lord to be with me
[1:29:29] every step that I take. Amen. Not just
[1:29:32] once in a while, but every step that we
[1:29:34] take, we want God, amen, to be leading
[1:29:36] and guiding us. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:29:41] All right. So, he says, if you're doing
[1:29:42] something wrong, yeah, do repent
[1:29:44] quickly. He says if you're building a
[1:29:46] house, put it up. He says, "If Jesus
[1:29:48] comes tomorrow, you'd be found faithful
[1:29:51] at due at your duty. If you're building
[1:29:54] your church, go on, put it up. I'd
[1:29:56] rather be putting the money in stat than
[1:29:58] some be found with it in my pocket."
[1:30:00] Just keep on continue as you
[1:30:04] are. Cuz there's a lot of people who's
[1:30:06] getting a whole lot of funny ideas about
[1:30:08] the the millennium. There's folks that
[1:30:10] would show up under the bridge in
[1:30:11] Jeffersonville. We heard that the
[1:30:13] millennium was up here. My gracious, a
[1:30:16] millennium made under a bridge in
[1:30:18] Jeffersonville. You know, people was
[1:30:21] people will absolutely misunderstand a
[1:30:23] preacher sometimes. Amen.
[1:30:26] Praise the Lord. Amen. I will say this,
[1:30:29] it come to mind. For some reason, the
[1:30:31] Holy Spirit seems to have brought it
[1:30:32] back. But while I feel like the maturity
[1:30:34] of majority of us are at a place of
[1:30:37] maturity, I do realize that we still
[1:30:39] have a lot of growing to do. We still
[1:30:41] have a lot of more maturing to do. Amen.
[1:30:44] And I'll maybe sometime mention those
[1:30:47] areas. But we also have new people. We
[1:30:49] also have young people in the Lord.
[1:30:52] Amen. So we have all the different
[1:30:54] categories. Amen. Amen. All different
[1:30:57] categories. And so we have to try to
[1:30:59] follow the leading of the spirit and to
[1:31:01] try to minister. Amen. That will be a
[1:31:04] little bit some of those things that I
[1:31:05] try to do this morning. Amen. With the
[1:31:07] help of the Lord. We want to with Amen.
[1:31:10] And I'm going to finish this, but um uh
[1:31:14] Amen. All
[1:31:16] right. So, so he says if you're building
[1:31:19] a house, he says, "Put it up." Now,
[1:31:21] notice here, keep doing it. Everybody
[1:31:24] understand now. Just continue right on.
[1:31:28] You just go right on as you are. Now,
[1:31:30] just don't stop. Don't do nothing. Just
[1:31:33] go right on as you are. Keep on serving
[1:31:36] the Lord. Amen. Amen. We can all say to
[1:31:39] that, right? Amen. Then he goes to
[1:31:42] talking about if you're working for
[1:31:43] somebody and you quit 15 minutes early,
[1:31:45] you're going to get docked. If you're
[1:31:47] planting wheat, plant your wheat. If
[1:31:49] you're digging potatoes, go on and dig
[1:31:51] them out. Say, "Well, nobody will eat
[1:31:53] them." That don't make any difference.
[1:31:54] Dig them out anyhow. Just continue on as
[1:31:57] you are. He got a letter from somebody.
[1:31:59] They were trying to sell the farm. He
[1:32:01] said, "Don't sell the farm." Amen. Amen.
[1:32:05] Oh my. If I know that he was coming
[1:32:07] tomorrow and I was the farmer, I'd put
[1:32:09] my crop out today. Amen.
[1:32:12] I'd put my crop out today if I knew he
[1:32:15] was coming tomorrow. Why? What is the
[1:32:17] point that you're trying to make? I
[1:32:19] believe what he was trying to make is if
[1:32:20] you are in the place that God wants you
[1:32:23] to be. Amen. Then keep on doing what
[1:32:26] you're doing. If you have to do
[1:32:28] something different, then you're not
[1:32:29] doing what you ought to be doing in the
[1:32:30] first place.
[1:32:34] Amen. I thought this week I said, you
[1:32:36] know, it's good to know where God wants
[1:32:38] you, where God plants you. Amen. Where
[1:32:40] God wants you. I thought, you know,
[1:32:42] there's some really, really wonderful
[1:32:44] message churches around. Amen. There's
[1:32:47] Brother Biscos, there's Brother Ron
[1:32:48] Spencer, there's a just all these
[1:32:50] different churches. I thought, Brother
[1:32:52] B, if you had your choice of which one
[1:32:54] that you would go to, Amen. which one
[1:32:57] you would want to be in, which one you
[1:32:58] would you choose? I thought about asking
[1:33:00] you a trick question this morning. Amen.
[1:33:02] Which one would you want to go to? Which
[1:33:05] one would you want to be in?
[1:33:11] Well, that was not really a quick
[1:33:13] question, was it? They got that one
[1:33:15] pretty quick. That's right. Because I
[1:33:17] was going to say, if you want to be
[1:33:18] somewhere else, then I question your
[1:33:20] revelation.
[1:33:22] I question your revelation of what what
[1:33:24] church you ought to be in, who really is
[1:33:26] your pastor? Because you need a
[1:33:27] revelation of that according to the
[1:33:29] prophet. Why? So that you can know.
[1:33:31] Amen. I know where I would want to be. I
[1:33:33] want to be right here. Amen. They're
[1:33:36] fine. They're all in their place.
[1:33:37] They're as good as anybody. Amen. Maybe
[1:33:39] better than us. No doubt. But still, if
[1:33:41] you are where God wants you to be, you
[1:33:43] can have that confidence.
[1:33:46] Amen. And you'll know that you're going
[1:33:48] to be blessed. That God's going to bless
[1:33:49] you. Amen. Brother Bam said every
[1:33:52] Christian ought to have a church home, a
[1:33:54] place that you support, that you go to,
[1:33:56] that you pay your tithe, that you push
[1:33:57] on. Amen. That that the people will
[1:33:59] know, not just out somewhere. Amen. If
[1:34:02] you're just out somewhere, guess what I
[1:34:04] like what I heard a brother say this
[1:34:05] week. He says, "If you're out and away
[1:34:06] from church, Amen. you don't go to
[1:34:08] church somewhere, you are everything to
[1:34:11] you is right." And uh and it's the Holy
[1:34:14] Ghost. Everything that you There's
[1:34:15] nobody there to say, "Hey, you know that
[1:34:17] ain't right." Uh everything you do, you
[1:34:20] think it's right. And we don't need
[1:34:22] that. We need somebody to correct us
[1:34:24] when we need correction.
[1:34:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:29] Amen. Hallelujah. So, thank the Lord you
[1:34:32] got that answer right. Brother, I'm
[1:34:36] going to tell brother Glenn, you know,
[1:34:38] the way I felt about it. I've always
[1:34:39] felt about it when I sat under a pastor,
[1:34:41] man, we'd have some evangelists. We'd
[1:34:42] have preach come by and I'm here to tell
[1:34:44] you, they could just absolutely preach
[1:34:46] the house down, but if you ask me, Amen,
[1:34:50] who the better preacher was, who's the
[1:34:53] best preacher? Brother Glenn there in
[1:34:55] the back. He says, "Boy, them preachers,
[1:34:56] they almost preach as good as you do.
[1:35:01] That guy said, "God bless you, brother
[1:35:03] Glenn." You know, well, if you like
[1:35:06] somebody else more than you love your
[1:35:08] pastor, I don't know. You know, you got
[1:35:10] to love them all. Hello. But you got to
[1:35:12] know who's feeding you every day.
[1:35:14] Somebody's going to be there for you
[1:35:15] every day. Amen. Anyway, that's just a
[1:35:18] little tidbit. Is that okay? Amen. So,
[1:35:21] know where you are. Know who you're
[1:35:23] supposed to be, where you're supposed to
[1:35:24] be. Be doing what you're supposed to be
[1:35:26] doing. Amen. Because the rapture could
[1:35:29] take place any time. And how many
[1:35:32] believe that? That's my ambition. That's
[1:35:34] my goal is to have you ready today. Not
[1:35:37] tomorrow, today. Before this service is
[1:35:40] over, you need to be ready. You need to
[1:35:43] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost all
[1:35:45] the way down into your soul. Amen. With
[1:35:48] the help of the Lord, we want to look at
[1:35:49] the past. Amen. We want to look at the
[1:35:51] past a little bit and we want to try to
[1:35:53] learn from history. Amen.
[1:35:55] Can you imagine how smart we would be if
[1:35:59] people would learn from history? We
[1:36:01] would be an
[1:36:03] intellectual uh spiritual intellectual
[1:36:06] or intelligence should I say. Amen. Full
[1:36:09] of the real that we're supposed to have.
[1:36:12] Amen. We could look at Sodom and
[1:36:14] Gomorrah and say, "Hey, we don't never
[1:36:15] want to be with Sodom and Gomorra. We
[1:36:17] know what that happened, right?" Amen.
[1:36:18] We don't never want to backslide because
[1:36:20] we know what happens to them. Amen. God
[1:36:22] gives the old whip out. Lord. Oh, we
[1:36:25] could just man you could learn and learn
[1:36:26] and learn and learn. But the people
[1:36:28] don't learn. Amen. And they always fall
[1:36:31] into the cycle of revival. Amen. And
[1:36:34] then end up in that cycle of death. But
[1:36:36] brother Bam says this pure word of God,
[1:36:38] I read it yesterday. He said, "This pure
[1:36:40] word of God, it'll never denominate."
[1:36:42] You can't make a denomination out of
[1:36:44] this message. People will People will
[1:36:47] have their little denomination, but you
[1:36:49] can't denominate this. No. This word
[1:36:52] will come right back. Amen. His word
[1:36:54] will come right back and it will correct
[1:36:56] you. It will condemn your cond your
[1:37:00] denomination. Amen. You can be a one-man
[1:37:03] denomination. Go off and add a little
[1:37:06] bit of your own ideas to this and you're
[1:37:08] in trouble. Amen. A one man-made
[1:37:11] denomination. Brother Bam says just to
[1:37:13] add it to it or put your own thoughts to
[1:37:14] it. Amen. It'll never denominate.
[1:37:20] Amen. Praise the
[1:37:23] Lord. All
[1:37:31] right. Amen. So he says, "If I was a
[1:37:35] farmer and I knew he's coming tomorrow,
[1:37:36] I would put out my crops." And the last
[1:37:39] thought that I want to speak on this is
[1:37:41] somebody came and said that they gave
[1:37:43] their pastor a second set of keys. Amen.
[1:37:46] because the rapture take place in it. He
[1:37:48] then better bam says I guess the pastor
[1:37:50] was going to miss
[1:37:54] it. Amen. I'd say you keep your set of
[1:37:57] keys. What are you talking
[1:38:00] about? Give it to somebody else. Not me,
[1:38:03] buddy. Amen. How many got is wants to be
[1:38:06] ready for the rapture? Praise the Lord.
[1:38:09] Amen. Let me start off with this also.
[1:38:11] Listen. So, how many knows that first of
[1:38:13] all, God is a God of variety.
[1:38:17] Amen. Even in a church, let me just lay
[1:38:19] a little foundation. Even in a church,
[1:38:21] there's so much diversity. Even as
[1:38:23] brother Brian was said, he comes from
[1:38:24] New York. I come from
[1:38:27] Ohio. Hello. People from
[1:38:31] Michigan. Amen. And I could tell you I
[1:38:34] could tell you personalities of people
[1:38:36] that I've met from Michigan. I don't
[1:38:38] really
[1:38:41] like don't really like their their their
[1:38:44] personality. They're pretty too rough
[1:38:46] cut, unsensitive about anything they
[1:38:48] say. Just straightforward. I just tell
[1:38:51] them how it is. Yeah. And sometimes you
[1:38:52] hurt everybody. You better off keep your
[1:38:54] mouth
[1:38:55] shut. Amen. I I look at myself. The Holy
[1:38:59] Ghost gets me a picture of myself. You
[1:39:01] know, Ohio's not far from
[1:39:03] [Laughter]
[1:39:06] Michigan. Oh my. I thought, you know,
[1:39:08] you're just sometimes you just telling
[1:39:10] how it is and you don't have much
[1:39:11] feelings either. Maybe you ought to be a
[1:39:13] little more sensitive. But I realized,
[1:39:15] hey, I'm from up that way, too. Lord,
[1:39:17] help me. Amen. How many? We all need the
[1:39:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost to make us
[1:39:20] sweet and gentle, meek, and so forth and
[1:39:24] loving. Amen. And so, anyway, praise the
[1:39:28] Lord. But we are all Amen. All
[1:39:31] different. Come from different places.
[1:39:32] Amen. We have different uh appetites.
[1:39:35] Let me just read what Brother Brandham
[1:39:37] says. Now, when we started across the
[1:39:39] country, he says, "I'm a lover of for of
[1:39:41] a Ford. I like a Ford, he said. But my
[1:39:45] boy, he likes a Chevrolet just the same,
[1:39:48] just as much as uh as a Chevy as I am
[1:39:51] for a Ford. That's right. He says, he'll
[1:39:54] tell me, "Your rattlet trap Ford won't
[1:39:56] make it." And I said, "Your old junker
[1:39:59] Chevy
[1:40:00] won't. But you know what? He remains my
[1:40:03] son. I remain his daddy. We stayed in
[1:40:06] our car and we both got there." Amen.
[1:40:08] How many believes that's right? You
[1:40:10] might differ. You differ with this.
[1:40:12] different with that. But in heart, we're
[1:40:14] still part one of another. Amen. So
[1:40:18] listen, he says, "And we stayed in the
[1:40:20] car, got there, because we was both
[1:40:22] looking for something greater than a
[1:40:23] four-door Chevy." When I go to buy ice
[1:40:25] cream for my children, one will say,
[1:40:27] "Well, I want vanilla." And the other
[1:40:28] one will say, "I want chocolate." The
[1:40:30] other one's strawberry. And the other
[1:40:31] one say orange. And I come back and I
[1:40:33] got a rainbow color. So many different
[1:40:35] things. He says, he says, "That's only a
[1:40:37] taste. It's all ice cream." Here it
[1:40:40] stands today. We're all born of the same
[1:40:42] spirit. Amen. It's all ice cream. It's
[1:40:45] all the spirit of God. And you know
[1:40:47] what? The rainbow makes a covenant and
[1:40:49] so forth. See, God doesn't have and
[1:40:51] dwell in a Sears and Robok harmony
[1:40:53] house. Anyhow, God is a God of variety.
[1:40:58] Amen. Thank the Lord for variety.
[1:41:01] Sometimes we don't do so good with
[1:41:03] variety, but we need that variety. Ain't
[1:41:06] that right? Amen. We need people that
[1:41:08] are different from us. Peter was so much
[1:41:10] different than John. John was more
[1:41:13] sensitive and loving and amen saying
[1:41:15] love one another. By this shall men know
[1:41:17] that uh uh uh that that you are
[1:41:20] in love one another for God is love. He
[1:41:23] that loveth is of God. He that loveth
[1:41:25] not amen his brother whom he has seen
[1:41:27] amen does not love God. Ain't that
[1:41:29] right? But Peter on the other hand when
[1:41:31] he was just more of a dogmatic. He was
[1:41:33] more extreme person. Peter was Amen.
[1:41:37] Peter was a whole lot more extreme.
[1:41:39] Amen. And even Jesus, Amen, had to
[1:41:41] rebuke him and cast Satan to get bee
[1:41:43] behind me, satan, when he says, "No,
[1:41:46] you're not going to Calvary and this
[1:41:47] that or the other." He says, you know,
[1:41:48] "Get thee behind me." That's the devil
[1:41:50] talking to him. So he opened his mouth
[1:41:52] sometimes when he shouldn't have when we
[1:41:53] take the communion like we're going to
[1:41:55] do this morning with the help of the
[1:41:56] Lord. Amen. Amen. And and Peter, you
[1:41:58] know, he would say, he says, you know,
[1:42:00] you'll never wash my head. You're the
[1:42:01] master. Don't you get down there and
[1:42:02] wash my feet. I'll wash your feet. He
[1:42:05] says, if I wash thee not, thou hast no
[1:42:07] part with me. Oh, well, my hands in my
[1:42:09] head, too. Amen. And he was just always
[1:42:13] just, you know, boisterous like that.
[1:42:14] And so, God makes us all different.
[1:42:17] Amen. Aren't you glad God makes us
[1:42:19] different? God
[1:42:20] loves a variety different people. So,
[1:42:23] whatever God makes you, even brother Bam
[1:42:25] says, he makes fat people. He makes
[1:42:26] skinny peoples. He make tall people. He
[1:42:29] says some with orange with with I've got
[1:42:32] it here. I don't think I don't think I
[1:42:34] quoted that one out, but he says he
[1:42:36] makes them with brown hair, red hair,
[1:42:37] and he said blue hair. And I'm like,
[1:42:39] blue
[1:42:40] hair. Yeah, it says blue hair. I don't
[1:42:42] know if they misinterpret it, but
[1:42:44] there's sure some blue hair out there
[1:42:46] now. I don't know if it's of
[1:42:51] God. Oh my, but God loves variety. Amen.
[1:42:56] Aren't you glad there's people with
[1:42:57] different personalities than what you
[1:42:59] are? Amen. I'm here to tell you what,
[1:43:01] Brother Bam says, "What would we be if
[1:43:03] everybody always agreed with us on
[1:43:05] everything and we never had any
[1:43:07] adversity. Never say, "No, I don't agree
[1:43:09] with you on that." Why? We'd be just
[1:43:11] some dish rag. No, it's good for you to
[1:43:13] have some adversity. How many knows it
[1:43:15] brings out the glory of God? Amen. And
[1:43:18] that you can love them anyway, even no
[1:43:20] matter how much different they are.
[1:43:23] Hersburgers, hall beggars, bers, and you
[1:43:25] name it. All of these different ones
[1:43:27] coming from different backgrounds. And
[1:43:29] Amen. And you got to be careful that you
[1:43:31] don't dislike somebody. Cuz brother Bram
[1:43:33] said, "It's a terrible thing for you to
[1:43:35] dislike somebody." Amen. Because the
[1:43:38] love of God makes me love everybody.
[1:43:40] Makes me even my enemies. It makes me
[1:43:42] love everybody. We need that maturity.
[1:43:45] If we're going into rapture, we need
[1:43:47] that maturity.
[1:43:50] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:43:54] All right, let's start on our sermon.
[1:43:56] Hallelujah.
[1:44:00] Now in uh in first kings we see here and
[1:44:06] I want to read another I want to read
[1:44:08] another scripture found over in
[1:44:11] Isaiah. Amen. And then I'll give you my
[1:44:15] title. Give you my title. In
[1:44:20] Isaiah
[1:44:23] 35 and verse 8, it says, "And a highway
[1:44:27] shall there
[1:44:28] be and a
[1:44:31] way and it shall be called, it shall be
[1:44:34] called the way of
[1:44:36] holiness." Amen. The way of
[1:44:41] holiness. Praise the Lord. Brother
[1:44:43] Brandham reads that and he says, "And
[1:44:46] then they used to talk about the highway
[1:44:48] of holiness." Now, if you ever read
[1:44:50] that, you get that in Isaiah 35. If
[1:44:52] you'll notice, there shall be a highway
[1:44:55] and a
[1:44:57] way. He says, "Now, the end is a
[1:45:00] conjunction." and see a highway. It was
[1:45:03] a highway of holiness and it shall be a
[1:45:06] highway and a way and it the way and it
[1:45:10] shall be called the way of holiness.
[1:45:13] Amen. I think I titled it the way of
[1:45:15] holiness. Not the way of um not the
[1:45:18] highway of holiness, but the way of
[1:45:20] holiness. And the way of the road is the
[1:45:23] middle of the road.
[1:45:26] Amen. It's built this so that the waters
[1:45:29] will wash off the trash on both sides,
[1:45:33] keeping the road clean. If you don't,
[1:45:35] you'll have puddles standing in your
[1:45:37] road all the time if it's not built
[1:45:40] right. He says the way is the middle of
[1:45:44] the road. Amen. Amen. And I wanted to
[1:45:47] talk to you about that middle of the
[1:45:49] road. That the middle of the road, he
[1:45:51] says the road is built at a slant. Every
[1:45:54] good road is built with a slope in the
[1:45:56] middle. Ain't that right? Amen. So that
[1:45:59] when it washes the water runs off this
[1:46:01] side, the water runs off that side.
[1:46:08] Amen. And it washes all the trash off.
[1:46:11] Now, Brother Brandham told us that,
[1:46:13] Amen. that that we are a Christian is to
[1:46:16] go down the middle of the road. And he
[1:46:19] kept saying that. And people would say,
[1:46:21] "Brother Brandom," he'd say, Uh, well,
[1:46:24] that's not very good. You know, if you
[1:46:26] go down the middle of the road, you're
[1:46:27] going to get wrecked up. You're going to
[1:46:29] wreck if you go up the bottom up down
[1:46:31] the middle of the
[1:46:34] road. Oh my. I like this though because
[1:46:37] brother Bannon come back with something,
[1:46:38] didn't he? He says, "You don't
[1:46:40] understand, brother. There's not a
[1:46:42] two-way street. If you go this way, you
[1:46:44] either fall off and you're gone. But
[1:46:47] there's no coming back this way. There's
[1:46:48] nobody cut this. It's a oneway
[1:46:51] street. Amen.
[1:46:55] Amen.
[1:46:58] Hallelujah. Let me see if I can tie some
[1:47:00] of this together with the help of the
[1:47:03] Lord.
[1:47:06] Amen. Now, Brother Bam says, "Now, Mount
[1:47:09] Carmel, he says these different pl three
[1:47:12] different places. One's Mount Carmel,
[1:47:14] the next is the juniper tree, and the
[1:47:15] third place is where God meets him, and
[1:47:17] he's in a cave." Amen. And it's very
[1:47:21] strange. She says, "The pastor knows in
[1:47:23] other ministers watch." He said, "After
[1:47:26] your mount caramels, you're going to
[1:47:28] have a juniper tree." I mean, oh my,
[1:47:31] listen to this. Whenever a man has a
[1:47:33] blessing in the power of God pours down
[1:47:35] and does something for you, hallelujah.
[1:47:38] How many believe that what God has done?
[1:47:41] Amen. And really, the thing that I want
[1:47:43] to one aspect of the message this
[1:47:46] morning is I want to ask what has come
[1:47:49] out of our meetings.
[1:47:55] what has come out of it.
[1:47:57] Amen. So now he says he says listen he
[1:48:01] says God pours down his blessing does
[1:48:03] something look out Satan is on the track
[1:48:05] just remember the next day that Monday
[1:48:08] after a good day on Sunday it's going to
[1:48:11] be a hard thing because the devil he's
[1:48:14] going to do everything that he can to
[1:48:16] knock that confidence out of you that
[1:48:20] the Holy Spirit has instilled you on the
[1:48:24] day before. Amen. Amen. Listen. So, we
[1:48:28] find out that he went 40 days and 40
[1:48:31] nights and God located him standing
[1:48:34] pulled back in a
[1:48:37] cave.
[1:48:39] Amen. God wanted to attract his
[1:48:41] attention. So, there was a great storm
[1:48:44] that passed by. It rent the mountains.
[1:48:47] It was so powerful that it shook the
[1:48:49] rocks. God wasn't in the storm. And he
[1:48:52] went before and it went before God did.
[1:48:55] And then there was again a great
[1:48:56] earthquake that shook the earth. And
[1:48:58] still God wasn't in the earthquake. And
[1:49:01] there come a fire. But God wasn't in the
[1:49:03] fire.
[1:49:16] Amen. I missed my one quote. We'll go
[1:49:18] get on that here. There's a quote that
[1:49:20] he made that I wanted to bring out here.
[1:49:22] Listen.
[1:49:30] Um, okay. So, and God wasn't into fire,
[1:49:33] brother, sister. He says, "I've been in
[1:49:36] a cave long
[1:49:37] enough, and you have too, and know that
[1:49:40] there has been a lot of earthquakes,
[1:49:42] shakings around, a lot of noise, fusses,
[1:49:46] stews, and things like that, and big
[1:49:48] meetings." Now you have to understand
[1:49:50] that brother Brandham was coming now to
[1:49:52] a place in 1959 and he was dealing with
[1:49:56] the Pentecostals. He was dealing with
[1:49:58] all the churches. Ain't that right? Cuz
[1:50:01] having a running around the church
[1:50:04] screaming and how I'll tell you what all
[1:50:07] of that pe and getting fallen out and
[1:50:10] everything else that has been all down
[1:50:12] through the ages.
[1:50:14] It's been before us. Ain't that right?
[1:50:17] And I love it. How many likes it?
[1:50:21] Amen. Praise the Lord. Sure we do. But
[1:50:24] notice, but brother Brandham, for some
[1:50:27] reason, and then you'll you'll see it
[1:50:29] when he when I speak of it here. Amen.
[1:50:31] That he he is looking for the results of
[1:50:33] it all. And I'll just say this um
[1:50:38] because I don't know exactly where it's
[1:50:39] found. I'm thinking that it might be
[1:50:41] lean not to your own understanding, but
[1:50:43] I've read it several times here in his
[1:50:45] church where brother Arab says all of
[1:50:47] our campaigns and all of this revival
[1:50:49] and all of this. He said it was a
[1:50:52] complete
[1:50:53] failure. Remember that. He said it's
[1:50:56] failing. All of going to the the poll
[1:50:58] and and everybody going to the poll and
[1:51:00] prayers, you might as well not have
[1:51:01] prayed. He said he was very negative
[1:51:04] about
[1:51:06] it. And you know why? because he's
[1:51:09] seeing ultimately where they went with
[1:51:12] it. Where did all those churches go?
[1:51:15] Where are they today? Are they in the
[1:51:17] message? No. They're still out there
[1:51:19] where he tried to get them out of. It
[1:51:21] didn't do any good.
[1:51:24] It was so bad. Hello. It was so bad that
[1:51:26] 1963 to 1965, Brother Bannon hardly had
[1:51:30] any open doors.
[1:51:32] Hello. How many knows that? Because
[1:51:34] Christ had been put outside. So I can
[1:51:36] understand why he would make the
[1:51:37] statements. He knows why he made the
[1:51:39] statements that he did.
[1:51:47] Oh my brother Brad, I am so glad. I am
[1:51:50] so glad that there is a prophecy and a
[1:51:53] word in here that says that this bride
[1:51:55] in this age will not fall.
[1:52:02] She will not go that way.
[1:52:07] Amen. So, let's look at history a little
[1:52:09] bit and learn from it. Praise the Lord.
[1:52:12] Now,
[1:52:13] notice he's been in the cave long enough
[1:52:15] back there resting long enough. Time to
[1:52:17] get out here and listen to what God has
[1:52:18] to say. He says, "Not a noise fence." He
[1:52:21] says, he says, "And big meetings, but
[1:52:24] where has been God out of it?" That's
[1:52:27] the reason why I said what I did this
[1:52:29] morning. There's got to come something
[1:52:31] deeper than a healing service.
[1:52:34] There's got to come something deeper
[1:52:36] than the gift of speaking in tongues.
[1:52:38] There's got to come something deeper
[1:52:40] than rushing mighty winds.
[1:52:44] The wind went forth, but God wasn't in
[1:52:46] it. We've had rushing mighty winds all
[1:52:49] over the country and
[1:52:50] sensations. Amen. Blood coming in their
[1:52:53] face and in their hands, all kinds of
[1:52:55] signs. But where was God at?
[1:53:00] Where is God at?
[1:53:04] My praise the
[1:53:08] Lord. He says Elijah waited yet he was a
[1:53:12] prophet but he listened to it. He never
[1:53:15] went out to compare revivals with them.
[1:53:18] He never went out to get the biggest
[1:53:19] tent in the country. He never went out
[1:53:21] to get on television and so forth as we
[1:53:24] would call it. Amen. back in there in
[1:53:26] there they they would try to see who
[1:53:28] would have the biggest tent, who could
[1:53:30] have the biggest crowds, who could have
[1:53:31] the biggest
[1:53:33] revivals. Hello, how many knows God is
[1:53:36] not in that.
[1:53:38] He's not in us competing against each
[1:53:41] other. We're not competing against
[1:53:44] anybody.
[1:53:47] Amen. No, sir. God is in small things.
[1:53:50] God is in little things. Praise the
[1:53:52] Lord. He never went out to do all that.
[1:53:55] All the great fuss. And America is
[1:53:57] guilty of listening to those noises. Oh,
[1:54:00] we love
[1:54:02] noise. But God's not in noise.
[1:54:07] Hello. Now, we know that wherever Jesus
[1:54:10] is, there's always some noise.
[1:54:14] Amen. But what does the noise do? Where
[1:54:16] are those people at? Where were they at
[1:54:19] at
[1:54:20] Calvary? Amen. It's got to be more than
[1:54:22] just
[1:54:24] noise. Amen. If that would have been so,
[1:54:28] the Africans that beat the tomtoms, man,
[1:54:30] he says, the tomtoms, you like you never
[1:54:33] heard such a noise in a rhythm, but
[1:54:35] God's not in it. We've had mighty
[1:54:37] rushing winds. We've had all kinds of
[1:54:39] fires and earthquakes and shakes and
[1:54:41] revival and things like that. And God
[1:54:43] wasn't in
[1:54:46] it.
[1:54:47] Amen. Praise the Lord. How many? We've
[1:54:50] had We've had many. We many different
[1:54:52] peoples rose up and said we're in the
[1:54:53] bride's revival. We're in the bride's
[1:54:54] rev. We've heard that before.
[1:54:59] But what are we? I do believe that we're
[1:55:01] in a revival. We are in the bride's
[1:55:03] revival. Amen. It doesn't go from here
[1:55:06] to there. When the bride's in a revival,
[1:55:08] it's going to go all the way to the end.
[1:55:10] It's something that God does. We need
[1:55:12] revival.
[1:55:15] Amen. Praise the Lord. And I'm going to
[1:55:18] go ahead and say what I wanted to say
[1:55:19] even about revival. I said you shouldn't
[1:55:21] have to get ready. You should be ready.
[1:55:23] And I want to say that you should not
[1:55:25] need a revival.
[1:55:27] You should not need a revival. I've made
[1:55:29] that statement. We want revival. We need
[1:55:31] revival. Oh, okay. So, I guess you're
[1:55:33] backsliding, diving because whenever
[1:55:35] somebody's dying, you got to revive
[1:55:36] them.
[1:55:38] What are you half dead? You ought to be
[1:55:40] in revival. You're talking about the
[1:55:42] fire. The fire is here. I don't come to
[1:55:45] church and get pumped up. I don't come
[1:55:47] here and have the pump handle. Hey, I'm
[1:55:49] already on fire. What are you talking
[1:55:51] about? I'm already revived. Stay
[1:55:53] revived. I don't want you half dead.
[1:55:58] Amen. Praise the
[1:56:00] Lord.
[1:56:03] Hallelujah. Unfortunately, sometimes we
[1:56:05] do get a little backslid, don't we? And
[1:56:08] we do need revival sometimes because
[1:56:09] we're still in this flesh. And this
[1:56:11] flesh has a real strong tendency to pull
[1:56:13] you down.
[1:56:15] Amen.
[1:56:17] Okay, now notice, so he says, "We've had
[1:56:20] mighty winds and so forth, revival and
[1:56:22] things like that. God wasn't in it." He
[1:56:26] says, "If it had been, it would have
[1:56:29] shown
[1:56:30] itself." Hallelujah. Amen. If you've got
[1:56:33] the life of Christ, it will produce the
[1:56:36] fruits of the spirit. It's not something
[1:56:39] that you have to
[1:56:40] manufacture. It's just something that
[1:56:42] manifests itself. It just bears itself
[1:56:45] out. That's what brother Brandham was
[1:56:47] saying. If all of this would have been
[1:56:49] good, if God had been in it, they'd have
[1:56:51] been right here in the middle of the
[1:56:52] message of the hour.
[1:57:05] Amen. Quick one. I was talking to my
[1:57:08] good friend Dr. Lee who's present now,
[1:57:11] quite a theologian. And so we usually
[1:57:13] have some pretty good discussions on the
[1:57:15] scriptures. Very smart. And he asked me
[1:57:17] one time what I thought about the
[1:57:19] initial evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:57:20] because how many know people are always
[1:57:22] looking for well this is the Holy Ghost
[1:57:24] and that's the Holy Ghost and oh my if
[1:57:26] you shout you got the Holy Ghost. If you
[1:57:27] speak in tongues you got the Holy
[1:57:29] Ghost. All these different
[1:57:32] things. And even in the prophet's
[1:57:36] ministry he had different times that he
[1:57:37] said he thought that well he'll just say
[1:57:39] it. Let me just read it. He says, "Uh,
[1:57:43] what was the initial evidence of the
[1:57:44] Holy Ghost? Was it speaking in tongues?"
[1:57:47] I said, "Many go years ago." I said, 'N
[1:57:49] no, I can't see that. He said, 'Neither
[1:57:51] do I. I said, uh, though I have taught
[1:57:54] that. And he says, what would you think
[1:57:55] would be the evidence? I said, the most
[1:57:58] perfect evidence that I can think of is
[1:58:00] love. And so we got to talking on that.
[1:58:02] And I thought, uh, that sounded pretty
[1:58:04] good. So I just held that if a man's got
[1:58:07] love. But one day the Lord in a
[1:58:10] vision straightened me out and he said
[1:58:13] that the evidence of the spirit was
[1:58:15] those who could receive the word.
[1:58:22] Neither love nor speaking in tongues but
[1:58:24] it's receiving the word. And then Dr.
[1:58:28] Veil was saying to me he said that's
[1:58:30] scriptural. He said, "Because John 14
[1:58:32] says, when the Holy Ghost is come upon
[1:58:35] you, he will reveal these things to you
[1:58:38] that I've taught you." Oh, let me stop
[1:58:40] there for a minute. How many knows if
[1:58:42] you ever get the real baptism of the
[1:58:44] Holy Ghost in your heart, it will
[1:58:46] actually bring you and and show you the
[1:58:49] things that he's already said, it'll
[1:58:51] make you come subject to what the word
[1:58:53] of God says.
[1:58:55] [Applause]
[1:58:56] Amen. And it'll show you things to come.
[1:59:00] It'll bring your body subject to the
[1:59:03] word.
[1:59:07] Amen. Just like brother Bram said, if
[1:59:10] pastor or preacher comes up here and
[1:59:12] preaches to you the truth and you walk
[1:59:13] out and you can't receive that and shows
[1:59:15] you're a pastor child and that what's on
[1:59:17] you and if you're doing something wrong
[1:59:19] in the church and the pastor corrects
[1:59:20] you and you walk out and get mad, you
[1:59:22] didn't have the right spirit in the
[1:59:24] first place
[1:59:26] because the Holy Ghost always say, "God,
[1:59:27] I want to be right. That's right.
[1:59:32] Amen. That's quite something, isn't it?
[1:59:35] That's right. My my
[1:59:39] my cause the evidence of the Holy Ghost,
[1:59:42] it can be it can be uh you know, let me
[1:59:45] just let me just read you a couple
[1:59:47] scriptures here if I can real
[1:59:50] quick. See, Jesus said, "Enter ye at the
[1:59:54] straight gate, for wide is the gate, and
[1:59:56] broad is the way that leadth to
[1:59:58] destruction." And many there be that go
[1:59:59] therein thereat. But straight is the
[2:00:03] gate, narrow is the way that leadth to
[2:00:05] life, and few there be that find
[2:00:08] it. He said in verse 21, "Not everyone
[2:00:11] that saith to me, Lord, Lord," shall
[2:00:13] enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he
[2:00:14] that doeth the will of the word, amen,
[2:00:17] the Father which is in heaven. Because
[2:00:20] many will say to me in that day, Lord,
[2:00:22] haven't we not prophesied in thy name?
[2:00:25] Haven't we spoke in tongues? Haven't we
[2:00:27] shouted? Haven't we screamed? Haven't we
[2:00:28] done all the things? Listen. In my name,
[2:00:32] cast out devils. Can you imagine? These
[2:00:35] peoples were devil casters. They could
[2:00:37] cast devils out. But they still weren't
[2:00:39] saved.
[2:00:42] Hello. And in thy name did many mighty
[2:00:46] and wonderful works. And then I will
[2:00:48] confess unto them, depart from me. I
[2:00:52] never knew you.
[2:00:55] What a terrible thing.
[2:00:58] Now notice in the vision he showed me
[2:01:00] that. Now listen here. He says it's
[2:01:03] scriptural. Now notice this is what I
[2:01:06] really like. He says when he the Holy
[2:01:08] Ghost has come upon you, he reveal
[2:01:10] things to you that yeah that I've taught
[2:01:12] you. Amen. He will show you things to
[2:01:17] come. So there is the genuine evidence
[2:01:21] of the Holy Ghost. He has never told me
[2:01:25] anything wrong yet. Give the Lord a
[2:01:28] hand. Say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus."
[2:01:30] Hallelujah. He's never told him anything
[2:01:32] wrong yet. It's the word of God. Praise
[2:01:36] the Lord. Amen. Now, notice it would
[2:01:39] have showed itself
[2:01:41] up. Amen. He says, "People are so
[2:01:44] carried away with all the noise. America
[2:01:47] loves
[2:01:49] noise. Look at what they're doing. They
[2:01:52] turn on these old radios just as hard as
[2:01:54] they can with rock and roll and boogie
[2:01:56] woogie and all kinds of stuff. And they
[2:01:59] got to have it so loud it'll blast your
[2:02:01] eard drums out. It'll almost pop their
[2:02:06] trunks. Trunk full of
[2:02:09] speaking. You hear what's that rattling
[2:02:12] sound? That's the vibration of the metal
[2:02:14] on their car from the boom booms. My oh
[2:02:18] my. Hey, love
[2:02:21] noise. I guess we're prone to be that
[2:02:24] way. We're human being. When you talk
[2:02:26] about emotion, that's just one of our
[2:02:28] many, many feelings. How many know we
[2:02:30] need to have emotion? You got to have
[2:02:32] emotion. God takes those emotions and
[2:02:34] those senses so that you can feel for
[2:02:36] somebody. Amen. So that you can cry for
[2:02:39] somebody. So that you can pray for
[2:02:41] somebody. Amen. You got to put yourself
[2:02:43] in their shoes. Those emotions are okay.
[2:02:47] if used by properly by God. Amen. But
[2:02:50] they don't say much about it. Doesn't do
[2:02:53] all that much for you. Amen. Now
[2:02:56] notice that's right. The eard drums out
[2:02:59] nearly all the noise all the time of the
[2:03:01] day. And brother Bam says, "And in the
[2:03:04] church, we have beaten the tambourines.
[2:03:06] We have run up and down and screamed and
[2:03:08] hollered and whooped and we had and and
[2:03:10] and had a great time like that. Nothing
[2:03:12] against it." Amen. How many glad that?
[2:03:15] Nothing against it. We like that. We
[2:03:18] like for people to be loose. We don't
[2:03:21] want to come into a church. Amen. When
[2:03:22] there's ice hanging from the
[2:03:24] chandeliers.
[2:03:28] Amen. All right. Let me see here. I'm
[2:03:30] going to I'm going to try
[2:03:32] to pull some of this
[2:03:40] in. All
[2:03:42] right. And the church is tambourines.
[2:03:45] Nothing against it. He says, "But where
[2:03:47] was God in it? What did it do?" He says,
[2:03:50] "Broke us up into little pieces called
[2:03:53] Assemblies of God and Church of God,
[2:03:55] Pentecostal, United and oneness and
[2:03:57] tunas and different things." And God
[2:03:59] wasn't in it. It's a forerunner of God.
[2:04:01] It's a
[2:04:03] framework. Now, am I saying that about
[2:04:05] this church? Not a bit. I don't believe
[2:04:07] that. I don't believe that God's not in
[2:04:09] it. I believe God's in it. But if you're
[2:04:12] off the word, God's not in it.
[2:04:18] Amen. You got to be on the word. You got
[2:04:20] to be right with God. Amen. We've
[2:04:24] clapped hands and said, "Glory to God."
[2:04:26] We when you shout, you got it. And the
[2:04:29] Methodists said, and the Nazarines, and
[2:04:31] they found out they didn't have it. The
[2:04:33] Pentecostal said, "Clap your hands and
[2:04:35] shout till you speak in tongues and then
[2:04:37] you got it." But we found out they
[2:04:39] didn't have it. And now there's one more
[2:04:41] thing left. And God, take me down to the
[2:04:43] cave where I can find it. Let's get that
[2:04:46] still
[2:04:48] small voice.
[2:04:52] Something that puts the cream in life.
[2:04:55] That something that though you speak
[2:04:56] with tongues of men and angels, I have
[2:04:58] not that you're nothing. Is that what
[2:05:01] Paul said? Though I have faith to move
[2:05:03] mountains, though I give my body to be
[2:05:05] burnt, though I do all those things, if
[2:05:07] I haven't got that something way down on
[2:05:10] the inside. Oh, I want to get to that
[2:05:12] here in a minute. Hallelujah. something
[2:05:14] that puts a cream in life. That's
[2:05:16] something that uh and have something
[2:05:18] like that. You're nothing. If you don't
[2:05:20] have that, you're nothing. Though you
[2:05:22] can prophesy and speak with tongue and
[2:05:24] show signs and wonders and work miracles
[2:05:26] and do great signs, but if that little
[2:05:29] something, that still small voice isn't
[2:05:32] in there, you're still nothing.
[2:05:36] Amen. See, that's what we're listening
[2:05:38] for now. We've had
[2:05:41] thunders. Huh?
[2:05:44] Oh, I love it. I love it when this place
[2:05:46] sounds like thunder and I don't know,
[2:05:49] but you know, we've had the even the
[2:05:51] movement of the thunders within the
[2:05:53] message. Where's it at
[2:05:55] today? What did they do? They went the
[2:05:58] seeding on a certain thing, just a
[2:06:00] certain thing, thinking the thunders are
[2:06:03] going to wake her up. They believeing,
[2:06:05] hey, this is going to wake the bride up.
[2:06:06] You got to have this. You got to have my
[2:06:08] revelation. And where is it at today? I
[2:06:11] don't know about you, but I want
[2:06:13] something that'll carry me all the way
[2:06:15] [Applause]
[2:06:20] through. Not just part way. And if
[2:06:23] you're off the word, so-called message
[2:06:25] churches screaming and howling and
[2:06:27] dancing more than what we have fall
[2:06:29] apart because they're not on the word of
[2:06:31] God. If it's not on the word of God,
[2:06:34] it'll fall apart.
[2:06:36] Amen. And you'll go home depressed.
[2:06:38] Well, I sure had so much Sunday, but I
[2:06:40] still can't overcome this or can't
[2:06:42] overcome that. That's because maybe
[2:06:44] you're relying too much on emotion and
[2:06:46] not on that still small voice to speak
[2:06:48] to your heart. Cuz I'm here to tell you
[2:06:50] now, Amen. Jesus said, "When you pray,
[2:06:53] you go in a secret place. Go in that
[2:06:55] quiet secret place where there's nobody
[2:06:57] else at." Amen. And let me talk to you
[2:07:00] and I you'll come out of there when you
[2:07:02] hear my still small voice. Amen. And
[2:07:04] you'll be able to take on every devil of
[2:07:06] hell.
[2:07:09] Got to have that still small voice.
[2:07:12] Quiet.
[2:07:14] Amen.
[2:07:18] Amen. You're still nothing if you don't
[2:07:21] ain't got that. We've had thunders.
[2:07:23] We've had Peruia. We've had this. We've
[2:07:25] had that.
[2:07:27] Amen. I've listened to
[2:07:30] preachers.
[2:07:32] Amen. I'll mention the
[2:07:35] name. Maybe I won't.
[2:07:37] Some of you'll know who I'm talking
[2:07:39] about. Part of the reason I come up to
[2:07:42] Elton, Kentucky, because my pastor let
[2:07:44] somebody preach. That was just way off
[2:07:46] the
[2:07:47] word. I lost my confidence. I went to
[2:07:50] the pastor. What about this? And you
[2:07:53] talk about preaching under anointing. I
[2:07:55] mean, preacher on the anointing like you
[2:07:58] ain't never heard.
[2:08:00] But it there's something wrong.
[2:08:03] Something seriously wrong. It wasn't
[2:08:05] long before that man went off out into
[2:08:06] somewhere off and got a church and stuff
[2:08:08] and a little group and stuff and it all
[2:08:10] diminished. It all fell apart. Why?
[2:08:13] Because it wasn't on the word of God. It
[2:08:14] was on somebody's revelation and so
[2:08:16] forth. Never go by anointing. How many
[2:08:18] knows you can't even go by anointing
[2:08:20] because the that anointing falls on the
[2:08:22] just and the unjust.
[2:08:24] Amen. It's whether it lines up with that
[2:08:26] word of God or not. That's where it's
[2:08:28] at, folks.
[2:08:30] Hallelujah. You got to have that middle
[2:08:33] of the road. How many believe that?
[2:08:37] Hallelujah. Listen, I'll just pick this
[2:08:40] up here now. Now, on this side, when
[2:08:42] people get converted and their minds
[2:08:44] just set right on Christ, and if they're
[2:08:47] just a little scholarly and don't keep
[2:08:49] under prayer till they're real cold,
[2:08:52] they'll get real cold and stiff and
[2:08:54] starchy and indifferent. And then if
[2:08:57] they're just a little bit nervous, why
[2:08:59] if you don't watch, they'll just get
[2:09:00] radical and wild on this side. See, and
[2:09:03] go plum into sensations and things.
[2:09:08] Amen. Praise the
[2:09:12] Lord. Sensations and things. But the
[2:09:15] real
[2:09:16] church is a real sane gospel right in
[2:09:20] the middle of the road. It's not cold
[2:09:23] and starchy and neither is it
[2:09:25] fanaticism.
[2:09:28] What is that fanaticism? The
[2:09:29] Pentecostals, they got into that
[2:09:32] fanaticism and they thought, man, if you
[2:09:34] don't speak in tongues and shouting,
[2:09:36] Amen. and all of that. Amen. You ain't
[2:09:38] got the Holy Ghost. If you didn't speak
[2:09:39] in tongues, you ain't got the Holy
[2:09:41] Ghost. How many know that was
[2:09:43] fanaticism?
[2:09:48] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:09:56] It's a
[2:09:58] real good, warm gospel, heartfelt love
[2:10:03] of God going right down the middle of
[2:10:06] the road, calling from both sides. How
[2:10:09] many
[2:10:11] knows? Amen. I thought, you
[2:10:15] know, we're different. We worship
[2:10:18] different.
[2:10:20] We do worship different. Some of us are
[2:10:22] more
[2:10:23] quiet. Some of us cry and we've been to
[2:10:26] what's being said.
[2:10:29] Hello.
[2:10:32] Others. You know, jump up and down. I'm
[2:10:34] more that kind.
[2:10:37] Hello.
[2:10:39] You
[2:10:40] know, and brother Brandon, but brother,
[2:10:43] I think, let me just say this. I believe
[2:10:46] that amen is something everybody
[2:10:48] everybody ought to be able to do. I
[2:10:51] don't say well you don't never say and
[2:10:53] brother Bam says the Holy Ghost will
[2:10:54] amen the word of God.
[2:10:57] Sometimes we preachers we'll set it
[2:10:59] settle for a nod while he's nodding.
[2:11:04] Well he's smiling. Show me the quote.
[2:11:08] Show me the quote. Well says well if you
[2:11:09] can't amen smile or or nod your head. I
[2:11:13] don't remember him saying that. If you
[2:11:14] find it, you let me know and I'll preach
[2:11:16] just that and I'll
[2:11:17] repent. Amen. Why? But if you really
[2:11:20] want to seek the Holy Ghost, if you
[2:11:22] really want him to do something, say
[2:11:23] amen.
[2:11:24] [Applause]
[2:11:27] Hallelujah. Same way with hallelujah.
[2:11:29] It's a universal language. Praise be to
[2:11:32] God.
[2:11:36] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:11:39] Amen. Down the middle of the road.
[2:11:42] Praise the Lord.
[2:11:45] calling from both sides. That's right.
[2:11:48] He says, "Oh, how going and get how you
[2:11:51] going to get that church?" Amen. Get get
[2:11:53] it right with how you going to get that
[2:11:55] that church right stay right with the
[2:11:58] urum thumb of those nonsense. And it's
[2:12:01] got to a place till where you go into
[2:12:04] church. It's either so cold and formal
[2:12:06] and dry. How many knows from what I hear
[2:12:10] preachers telling it's something that's
[2:12:13] going around in the message churches?
[2:12:14] You're either one way or you're the
[2:12:17] other way. Amen.
[2:12:21] I thought maybe sometimes, you know, and
[2:12:23] I have been there and I I I don't go out
[2:12:24] a lot, but I've been there where boy,
[2:12:26] I'll tell you what, you couldn't get a
[2:12:28] amen out of nobody.
[2:12:30] And it was a plowing job. Just plow.
[2:12:33] Just keep on, you know. And I'm
[2:12:36] like, I guess I should just be a servant
[2:12:38] of the Lord. And I said, y'all ain't
[2:12:39] ready for this. God bless you. You want
[2:12:42] me to come back again? Y'all pray up and
[2:12:44] I'll come back. And if y'all when y'all
[2:12:46] ready for this?
[2:12:50] Amen. How many know We got to be careful
[2:12:52] we don't let that happen in our church.
[2:12:54] Come to church all stiff and cold and
[2:12:56] and you're not what you used to be and
[2:12:58] oh, the revival's over. Come on, people.
[2:13:01] Come in here. Pull on the gift of God.
[2:13:03] Be ready. Come pray it
[2:13:07] up. Get
[2:13:09] Jesus
[2:13:11] pray. Oh, so he's a spiritual mometer of
[2:13:14] 50 below zero people just sat there like
[2:13:17] a wart on the pickle just a shower
[2:13:20] indifferent puckered up.
[2:13:24] Jesus Christ came to save sinners.
[2:13:29] All pokered up. That's right. That's
[2:13:32] scary.
[2:13:35] Amen.
[2:13:36] Hallelujah. When it gets too quiet, I
[2:13:39] get a little worried.
[2:13:41] Amen. That's right. You'll hear that's
[2:13:45] right. Sour and indifferent, pucker up.
[2:13:46] And if if and if you hear somebody way
[2:13:49] in the back corner somewhere might grunt
[2:13:51] out a little.
[2:13:53] Amen. Once in a while like it hurts.
[2:13:58] All of them will stretch their neck like
[2:14:00] geese and look around and see what in
[2:14:02] the world took place. You know that's
[2:14:04] the truth. I'm not saying that as a
[2:14:06] joke. That ain't nothing but the truth.
[2:14:08] Our churches when they organize their
[2:14:10] churches and things that they do, they
[2:14:11] block off the blessing of God by their
[2:14:13] theology and get God can't even break
[2:14:16] through and bless the people. Amen. They
[2:14:18] get their church so formal, so stiff and
[2:14:21] so starchy till the Holy Ghost can't
[2:14:23] come into the church. And then when the
[2:14:26] devil seen that they he had them made it
[2:14:28] that way and some of them was going to
[2:14:29] break through somehow. Then he lets them
[2:14:32] open another channel. Amen. That isn't
[2:14:34] really the gospel and run them off into
[2:14:37] fanaticism. How many knows that's what
[2:14:39] the devil will try to do? He'll try to
[2:14:41] push you off on this side or he'll try
[2:14:43] to push you off on that side. He don't
[2:14:45] want you down the middle of the road. He
[2:14:47] wants you to be a complete fanatic off
[2:14:49] the word or he wants to be cold and
[2:14:51] formal and stiff.
[2:14:54] That's how he wants you to one way or
[2:14:56] the other. But we want that way. The way
[2:14:59] of holiness. The way of holiness down
[2:15:02] the middle of the road.
[2:15:05] Amen. Praise the
[2:15:07] Lord. All right. Channels, right? And
[2:15:10] either one of them bunch of fanatics.
[2:15:12] Listen, they're either a bunch of
[2:15:13] fanatics or they're a bunch of
[2:15:17] starches. But in the middle of the road,
[2:15:19] there's a gospel of the Lord Jesus
[2:15:21] Christ.
[2:15:22] As I spoke this morning, back this up
[2:15:24] way, there's this great question I'm
[2:15:26] fixing to ask in a few minutes. Is this
[2:15:28] that men that uh that men take one
[2:15:31] another's spirit? Be careful that you
[2:15:33] don't just get some spir men's spirit
[2:15:36] instead of the spirit of the Lord.
[2:15:40] Go into the church and watch the way
[2:15:42] that the pastor acts and you'll see the
[2:15:44] p that's the way that the people act.
[2:15:47] See, if the pastor is real starchy and
[2:15:50] stiff, the people will be the same way.
[2:15:52] And if you go into where it's wild and
[2:15:55] fanaticism, the people will be the same
[2:15:58] way. How many know it's important that
[2:16:00] you've got a pastor that's down the
[2:16:02] middle of the road?
[2:16:04] Amen. But I will say that the pastor has
[2:16:06] a major influence on how the church
[2:16:13] is on how we
[2:16:15] are. Amen. Praise the
[2:16:22] Lord. The time's getting away. He says,
[2:16:25] I got something a little more here I
[2:16:26] want to show you. Do you see what I
[2:16:28] mean, friends? We full gospel people. I
[2:16:30] believe the creed of the cross. But what
[2:16:34] is it? We'd better watch. The full
[2:16:36] gospel church has divided into two ways
[2:16:39] right now. One of them is getting cold
[2:16:41] and formal and indifferent. A danger
[2:16:44] line. Amen. How many know when you get
[2:16:47] so cold and so stiff and so there's a
[2:16:50] danger line.
[2:16:52] Amen. You just can't say amen, you just
[2:16:55] can't get Well, come on. You're you're
[2:16:58] freezing up. When you get so cold, you
[2:17:00] freeze up.
[2:17:02] Start moving that mouth. Praise the
[2:17:03] Lord. Amen. Yeah. That's right, brother.
[2:17:05] Preacher, loosen up a little. Get some
[2:17:08] of that frost
[2:17:10] off. Amen. Wave that hanky road. That's
[2:17:13] right. Loosen up a little. Get that ice.
[2:17:15] Get that cold off.
[2:17:20] Amen. Praise the Lord. Two different
[2:17:23] directions. I thought about the message
[2:17:24] kind of seems to be going that way. We
[2:17:26] got to watch. How many knows?
[2:17:29] We'll get into some good stuff here in
[2:17:31] about an
[2:17:33] hour. Calling from listen. So now notice
[2:17:37] the next one's getting a bunch of all
[2:17:39] kinds of listen. So one of them gets
[2:17:41] cold and formal and different the danger
[2:17:42] line. The next one's getting a bunch of
[2:17:45] kinds of mystics here and how things
[2:17:48] even scriptural. How many knows? For
[2:17:50] some reason they had blood coming out on
[2:17:52] their forehead I guess and on their
[2:17:53] hands and then they oh there's some
[2:17:55] blood here. Amen. you know, come and be
[2:17:57] anointed and stuff. And they had all
[2:17:58] kinds of stuff going on. Brother Brand
[2:18:01] time. Amen. How many knows he was
[2:18:03] straightening it out? That's not even
[2:18:05] scriptural. Watch it. Stay right in the
[2:18:08] middle of the road, brother. Stand for
[2:18:10] the same gospel. Bringing all these
[2:18:13] bringing all the holiness of the Lord
[2:18:14] Jesus and calling from both sides, but
[2:18:18] don't get on either side. Amen. He says,
[2:18:22] "I feel sorry for a pastor. a pastor uh
[2:18:25] that's a real true pastor here's a
[2:18:28] element in the church wants to be a
[2:18:30] fanatic and another one on this side
[2:18:33] wants just to be
[2:18:35] ritualistic and usually the cold former
[2:18:38] gets
[2:18:39] it all I can say is not while I'm
[2:18:44] here and not if I can help it isn't that
[2:18:47] right oh my preachers we got we got we
[2:18:50] got ways of we got ways sprucing you up
[2:18:54] a little bit. Amen. Like uh if your your
[2:18:57] religion don't have no emotion in it,
[2:18:59] maybe you ought to bury it. Amen. We can
[2:19:03] sure get happy at a baseball game and
[2:19:05] use all of those quotes. If that don't
[2:19:07] get you going, I don't know what will.
[2:19:10] Amen. But there's a middle of the road.
[2:19:11] How many believe there's a middle of the
[2:19:13] road? Amen. And usually the cold formal
[2:19:16] gets it because they are the educated
[2:19:18] scholarly
[2:19:20] type until they're both of them has not
[2:19:23] spiritual and the first thing you know
[2:19:25] your church freezes it
[2:19:28] up and they don't if they don't watch
[2:19:31] they're both both of them
[2:19:33] bragging. Oh, I know the message. I know
[2:19:35] God. I'm an intellectual this that or
[2:19:37] the other. And the other one well we got
[2:19:40] emotion. I'm daring to tell you we ain't
[2:19:42] got no dry hides around now. Both of
[2:19:44] them bragging. Both of them a little
[2:19:46] indifferent. Both of them not the way
[2:19:48] they ought to be. Humble and say, "God,
[2:19:50] just use me."
[2:19:53] Amen. Praise the
[2:19:57] Lord. Freezes up. They're both a little
[2:20:00] bragging. And then the first thing you
[2:20:01] know, he says, "Then you take off on
[2:20:04] this side. But pray God send you some
[2:20:08] sensible, sound gospel preacher that'll
[2:20:11] stand in that way and give you a little
[2:20:14] spanking once in a while when you need
[2:20:16] it and give you a
[2:20:18] little love when you need it. Keep you
[2:20:21] lined up with the scriptures and with
[2:20:23] the spirit. He's a shepherd watching
[2:20:26] over you. And if you got that pastor,
[2:20:29] flee to God and pray for him all the
[2:20:31] time and listen to him. Amen. How many
[2:20:34] believe that?
[2:20:35] Hallelujah. Listen, brother Bam says
[2:20:37] that you know in the Bible talking about
[2:20:39] the evidence of the Holy Ghost in the
[2:20:41] Old Testament. It says go through the
[2:20:42] city and mark those who sigh and cry for
[2:20:45] the abominations that done in the city.
[2:20:47] He didn't say those that speak in tong,
[2:20:50] shout or dance or whatever. But listen,
[2:20:52] he said mark those who have a burden on
[2:20:54] their heart for the lost. Amen. Have God
[2:20:57] on the inside. Praise the Lord. Go
[2:21:00] through the city. Put a seal on them.
[2:21:02] That sweet Holy Spirit. has something in
[2:21:05] the human heart that makes it call out
[2:21:07] with love of God to do the will of God.
[2:21:09] Not just jump up and down and holler and
[2:21:11] run over the building and speak in
[2:21:13] tongues, not just pray for the sick, not
[2:21:15] just prophesy. That's all okay. That
[2:21:17] ain't what I'm talking about. That's the
[2:21:19] outward something. Amen.
[2:21:22] Oh my. That's good. He says that's some
[2:21:24] of the spirit. That's right. But if
[2:21:26] there isn't something in there to anchor
[2:21:29] you with that,
[2:21:31] it doesn't do a bit of good. It's that
[2:21:33] wheel in the middle of the wheel. If
[2:21:35] you're not anchored back there by love,
[2:21:37] it'll do more harm than it will do good.
[2:21:44] Praise the Lord. We're just getting into
[2:21:47] good stuff. And now look what the church
[2:21:49] has done. It's either got off on a bunch
[2:21:51] of fanaticism and it went it either went
[2:21:54] real starchy and stiff and take one of
[2:21:56] on this one. But brother, there's a
[2:21:58] middle of the road where the true real
[2:22:00] true true gospel is being preached and
[2:22:02] the real true Bible signs and wonders
[2:22:04] are following. Amen. How many believe
[2:22:06] that? Amen. A sweet Holy Spirit that
[2:22:08] leads the church. That's the kind of
[2:22:10] church to go
[2:22:12] to. An intelligent church preaching the
[2:22:16] word, standing on the word with a real
[2:22:18] full gospel sermon, real spirit of God.
[2:22:21] Something in that spirit. Amen.
[2:22:23] Everything is decent. Everything in
[2:22:26] order. everything in love. That's the
[2:22:28] kind of church we want. How many wants
[2:22:30] to belong to that church? Raise your
[2:22:33] hand. Why sure we all do and God wants
[2:22:36] us to.
[2:22:41] Amen. Praise the
[2:22:44] Lord.
[2:22:51] Amen. Amen. So, back on what thou doest?
[2:22:56] What doest thou here? Actually, I think
[2:22:59] it'd be a good time
[2:23:01] to let me just keep going. We're not
[2:23:03] going to cut it
[2:23:05] short. Praise the
[2:23:07] Lord. Okay. Now, we've had thunders.
[2:23:10] We've had fire. We've had rushing mighty
[2:23:12] winds and earthquake. But God sent us
[2:23:14] that still small voice.
[2:23:19] That's what we need. Listen, brother. We
[2:23:21] need that still small voice that speaks.
[2:23:25] How many believe each and every one of
[2:23:26] you has that still small voice?
[2:23:31] I got to listen hard, brothers and
[2:23:32] sisters. I got to listen hard for the
[2:23:35] sermons that I preach to that still
[2:23:38] small voice that tells you this is what
[2:23:42] you need to speak. I had a certain
[2:23:44] direction, certain thing that I wanted
[2:23:46] to speak on and then it directed me to
[2:23:48] what dost thou here message that brother
[2:23:51] Brandon preached on when he seen how the
[2:23:53] Pentecostals went off into fanaticism.
[2:23:55] Ain't that right? And there he brings
[2:23:57] all of these things out and then I've
[2:23:58] got a few more things that I want to
[2:24:00] bring out. Amen. Just to be led by the
[2:24:03] spirit.
[2:24:05] Amen.
[2:24:06] Like brother Brian says almost every
[2:24:08] Sunday, it's the most important thing is
[2:24:10] that you're led individually led by the
[2:24:13] spirit.
[2:24:15] Amen. God bless you. All right. Now,
[2:24:18] notice that's right. Send us a Jesus
[2:24:20] said you couldn't hear his voice in the
[2:24:22] street. You didn't hear him crying. He
[2:24:24] was our pattern. Look at him. He was
[2:24:26] compared his spirit like a dove. Gentle.
[2:24:29] See, it's great things. Now, here's a
[2:24:31] good thing. What what's what's the
[2:24:32] greatest? When we're screaming and
[2:24:35] shouting and running the aisles and and
[2:24:38] all these things, what's what's what's
[2:24:39] the great what's great? What's really
[2:24:41] deep? What is deep?
[2:24:47] Because the way I see it, we should
[2:24:49] scream. We should shout. We're
[2:24:51] worshiping the Lord. That's how we
[2:24:52] worship God. When you get over yonder,
[2:24:54] it's not going to be a quiet place.
[2:24:56] We're going to be screaming and
[2:24:56] shouting, having a good time in the
[2:24:58] Lord. Amen. But for our walk, for as a
[2:25:01] church, as you walk, I want every one of
[2:25:03] you to have that way deep thing. Amen.
[2:25:08] Listen to what he says. What is the
[2:25:10] great things? Brother Brandham makes a
[2:25:13] statement. He says, "It's great
[2:25:15] things are quiet
[2:25:22] things." Great things are quiet,
[2:25:27] still small.
[2:25:33] Boys, did you know friends? Did you know
[2:25:36] that friends? Listen. The sun which
[2:25:38] gives life to the earth and every little
[2:25:41] every living thing, botney life, plant
[2:25:43] life, tree life, our life, whatever more
[2:25:46] it brings forth life, the sun does. And
[2:25:48] it can draw a million gallons of water
[2:25:51] from the earth and make less noise than
[2:25:53] we do going to the pump and pumping a
[2:25:56] bucket of water.
[2:26:01] It does. It keeps everything alive.
[2:26:07] And it isn't even as noisy as me
[2:26:10] speaking here.
[2:26:12] How quiet it is.
[2:26:17] Powerful. Did you ever hear don't mess
[2:26:20] with a quiet
[2:26:22] one? Don't mess with the quiet one.
[2:26:27] There's power there. Power you don't
[2:26:30] want to
[2:26:31] experience. Don't pick on him. Huh? Let
[2:26:36] me tell you something. That's God.
[2:26:38] God is quiet. He speaks to us in a small
[2:26:41] voice. There's times when it's loud. How
[2:26:43] many know he lifted up his voice and
[2:26:45] spoke? Sometimes he speaks loud, but a
[2:26:47] lot of times he's being just gentle.
[2:26:50] Amen. Quiet things are great things.
[2:26:53] Amen.
[2:26:55] listen than what we get out of a pump.
[2:26:57] See, it's big things. Quiet things are
[2:27:00] big things. Did you ever hear the world
[2:27:02] turning? Do you ever hear the planets as
[2:27:04] they pass by? Did you ever hear one?
[2:27:07] That's the big things. Did you ever hear
[2:27:09] the
[2:27:09] sunrise? We already know what he said
[2:27:12] about a wagon. When it's empty, it does
[2:27:14] a lot of rattling.
[2:27:17] Amen. Trust. That's not your case and
[2:27:19] not my case. When we rattle, we're still
[2:27:21] loaded. Is that okay? That's right.
[2:27:24] Because if we're not, then you're fake.
[2:27:27] Amen.
[2:27:30] Amen. We're like, brother Bam, sometimes
[2:27:33] you get so full. We get so full, it just
[2:27:35] kind of overflows.
[2:27:37] Amen. We just got to walk around. We
[2:27:39] just got to let it off a little bit. We
[2:27:41] got to shout a little bit. Sure.
[2:27:45] But if you ain't got God, you're still
[2:27:47] empty. And they're Hello. See, the
[2:27:50] Pentecostals and what they did is they
[2:27:51] relied on emotion. That was their
[2:27:54] religion. That if you don't have
[2:27:56] emotion, well, you just ain't got it.
[2:27:57] Don't you ever think that about somebody
[2:27:59] just because they're not real emotional
[2:28:01] or as emotional as you. Amen. That
[2:28:04] they're not godly or that they're not
[2:28:05] filled with God. It's simply not true.
[2:28:07] Because we have a bad tendency to try to
[2:28:09] make everybody like us. You got to be
[2:28:11] like me or you ain't got it. Don't you
[2:28:13] ever go there.
[2:28:16] Amen. Don't go there. Amen.
[2:28:20] And the same way with churches,
[2:28:21] comparing one church to another. Don't
[2:28:23] do that. It's not wise.
[2:28:27] Let's be led by the Holy Ghost. Praise
[2:28:29] the Lord. On. Oh, we think we have to
[2:28:32] have a lot of na noise. We have to have
[2:28:34] brass bands. We beat we a lot of jumping
[2:28:37] and up and down. He says, "And or he
[2:28:40] says, listen, if we don't have a whole
[2:28:41] lot of jumping up and down or we ain't
[2:28:44] had no good
[2:28:46] meeting." Amen.
[2:28:49] Not always the case, folks. Not always
[2:28:52] the case at all. No. Because I'll tell
[2:28:55] you what, when we get down there to the
[2:28:56] fellowship hall and we have food and
[2:28:58] sometimes or you get around to
[2:29:00] somebody's in when everybody's all of a
[2:29:01] sudden things will get
[2:29:04] quiet and I'll say it's pretty quiet
[2:29:06] around here. Everybody's
[2:29:10] eating. They're feeding their mouth, not
[2:29:12] running their
[2:29:15] mouth. Oh my. Praise the Lord. Why?
[2:29:18] Quiet
[2:29:20] feeding. Sometimes when you sit there
[2:29:22] and you're quiet. I know you're taking
[2:29:24] it in. You're eating. How many believes
[2:29:27] that? That's right. You ain't had a good
[2:29:30] meeting. That's the way the Pentecostals
[2:29:31] saw it. I don't see it that way. I
[2:29:33] believe that the Holy Spirit leading the
[2:29:36] church, anointing us to do what we
[2:29:38] do. We think everybody has to be on top
[2:29:42] clapping their hands and things. We
[2:29:45] think that the music has to be going in
[2:29:46] a rhythm and everybody run up and down
[2:29:48] the aisles. He says, "We've had that."
[2:29:51] And what good has it done? Where is it
[2:29:54] at? Where has it got us today? Into a
[2:29:57] bunch of confusion. Into a bunch of
[2:29:59] denominations, broke up. Even
[2:30:02] brotherhood is
[2:30:04] ruined.
[2:30:05] Hello. Doesn't mean much to do all of
[2:30:09] that if you don't have unity and if you
[2:30:11] don't have the love of God. And it
[2:30:12] causes people to get broke
[2:30:23] up. Of all the shouting, we've had
[2:30:26] enough to blast blast the noise to
[2:30:29] convert the whole
[2:30:31] world. I We haven't had that much here.
[2:30:34] We can have some more. But he's saying
[2:30:36] in his time, they had they had some
[2:30:39] noisy meetings.
[2:30:41] Amen. People whenever the Holy Spirit
[2:30:44] would move sometimes they would they
[2:30:46] would get to screaming or whatever and
[2:30:47] so forth. But brother Brandham after
[2:30:49] discerning the thoughts and intents of
[2:30:51] the heart he didn't get up here and see
[2:30:54] which fastest play song that he could
[2:30:56] play. A lot of times he'd just say now
[2:31:00] I love
[2:31:03] him.
[2:31:05] I love him. I read just the other day he
[2:31:09] says you know when the blessings of God
[2:31:10] fall people shout and so forth but he
[2:31:12] says you ever let him come into your
[2:31:14] presence you won't be shouting and
[2:31:15] screaming it's a fearful sight fearful
[2:31:18] thing awesome thing amen that's the
[2:31:22] blessings of God we love the blessings
[2:31:23] of
[2:31:24] God is this all right
[2:31:28] listen to convert the whole world we've
[2:31:30] had enough haring and hollering and
[2:31:32] carrying on till what's it done it has
[2:31:34] built has it built the church no it's
[2:31:36] built denominations It made men go out
[2:31:38] with puffed up ideas and stuff church.
[2:31:42] Didn't even brother Bam say as a
[2:31:43] preacher man, you know, you got to be
[2:31:44] careful. He'll start to preach and he'll
[2:31:46] start to get a little popular. God will
[2:31:47] bless him and all of a sudden, you know,
[2:31:49] he thinks he's a somebody. He says, and
[2:31:52] then he goes the opposite way. Goes the
[2:31:54] opposite way. And I want to show you,
[2:31:57] Amen, that that's the way it can go with
[2:32:00] anybody.
[2:32:02] Listen. Praise the Lord. I don't like
[2:32:04] that stuff. He said stuffed church and
[2:32:07] so forth. What's it done? Walk out on
[2:32:10] the platform and they say, "Oh, look at
[2:32:11] him. He's a prince. Look at how he's
[2:32:14] dressed just polished and everything."
[2:32:16] Amen. And he knows just about how to
[2:32:18] make his vows and so forth. That ain't
[2:32:21] what God chooses. You don't have to have
[2:32:23] princes and so forth stand up there like
[2:32:25] a I don't know what. It ain't the
[2:32:27] clothes that you wear or the eloquent
[2:32:29] ones will you speak with. It's that
[2:32:32] something on the inside of you, that
[2:32:35] voice of God.
[2:32:44] Amen. I'll read it. You never did see
[2:32:47] the sunrise. You never did hear it. Did
[2:32:49] you ever go out at night to hear the
[2:32:51] defall? What would we do without it?
[2:32:54] See, it don't take that. I'll tell you
[2:32:56] one thing
[2:32:58] now. It's the still. It isn't the
[2:33:01] riffling waters that
[2:33:03] reflects such a big noise and jumps up
[2:33:06] and down that reflects the beauty of the
[2:33:09] stars in it. It's that small pool that's
[2:33:13] deep and
[2:33:16] still that reflects the beauty of the
[2:33:20] stars. Let the beauty of Jesus be seen
[2:33:25] in me. How many? That's right. What we
[2:33:30] need tonight is that deep rich
[2:33:33] experience. I want to say where people
[2:33:36] have been in their closet praying,
[2:33:39] listening to that still small voice and
[2:33:42] that still small voice speaking back to
[2:33:45] you. Ain't that right? Bringing
[2:33:48] revelation, revealing himself to you so
[2:33:51] that when you come out, there's not
[2:33:52] enough devils in hell to stop you. that
[2:33:55] whatever situations, whatever comes your
[2:33:57] way, you'll be able to overcome. Amen.
[2:34:02] All right. Listen. See, listen. I'll
[2:34:06] tell you one thing. Listen. Big noise
[2:34:08] jumps up and reflects the beauty. What
[2:34:10] we need tonight. Deep experience.
[2:34:12] Something way down there. It doesn't
[2:34:14] have to shout yet. It might.
[2:34:17] Amen. It don't have to, but it might.
[2:34:22] But we put all emphasis on our shouting
[2:34:25] and it might never speak in tongues but
[2:34:27] yet it might but we put too much
[2:34:29] emphasis on on that. How many knows even
[2:34:31] brother Bam said even as far as the
[2:34:33] healing he says that's not that's
[2:34:35] healing is a minor. How many know
[2:34:38] shouting screaming that's all a minor
[2:34:40] the major is are you hearing that still
[2:34:43] small voice? How many knows even the
[2:34:45] message of the hour? There's so much the
[2:34:47] message hearing brother Pham's voice.
[2:34:50] Amen. When you listen to that tape and
[2:34:53] when you begin to hear not just his
[2:34:55] voice, but it was something about the
[2:34:56] voice, but what he said is what
[2:34:59] attracted your attention. It caught
[2:35:00] that. There has to be a voice in you
[2:35:03] that says, you know, I believe that's
[2:35:05] right. You might be sitting here this
[2:35:07] morning and hearing the preacher and
[2:35:09] there's to be something, a voice in you
[2:35:11] that says, I believe that what he's
[2:35:12] saying is the truth. You got to hear
[2:35:15] that still small voice saying, "Yeah, I
[2:35:17] believe that. I believe that's the
[2:35:20] truth. I receive the word.
[2:35:24] Amen. Amen.
[2:35:40] Don't think that because that you've
[2:35:41] spoken tongues or that you know so much
[2:35:44] about the scriptures or you read
[2:35:47] somebody's books or you know more than
[2:35:48] the other fellow. He said mark put a
[2:35:51] mark on those who cry for the
[2:35:53] abomination that's stunned the city. Who
[2:35:56] would he mark tonight? See it's the
[2:35:58] depth of the spirit not the shallowess.
[2:36:01] It's not the shell on the hickory of
[2:36:03] that, you know, that's good. It's the
[2:36:05] hickory under the shell. You got a big
[2:36:08] empty shell. You got nothing under
[2:36:09] there. What we need tonight is the depth
[2:36:11] of the love of God.
[2:36:14] Amen. Here's what I want to get to for
[2:36:18] one
[2:36:20] part. What have you heard in all of
[2:36:24] it? You'll be going in a few days and
[2:36:27] you'll hear Billy Graham. You'll hear
[2:36:29] Oral Roberts. You'll hear others, great
[2:36:31] men. Nothing against those men. They're
[2:36:33] God's servants. But don't listen to the
[2:36:35] noise. Hear that still small voice.
[2:36:39] Amen. How many know it's kind of like
[2:36:40] around the message? We have revivals
[2:36:42] here. We have revivals
[2:36:44] there. But listen, make sure that you
[2:36:47] hear that still small voice.
[2:36:52] He said, "That still small voice, that
[2:36:54] depth of something that comes across
[2:36:55] into the human heart that takes all the
[2:36:58] foolishness away from you, that takes
[2:37:00] all the world away from you, that makes
[2:37:02] you hate the things of the world and
[2:37:04] love the things of
[2:37:08] God. That's the
[2:37:10] depth. That's the pool that reflects the
[2:37:13] stars and God's glory. That's the thing
[2:37:16] that brings forth tears to the eyes,
[2:37:18] brings joy unspeakable and full of
[2:37:20] glory. It makes you stand when all other
[2:37:24] things will fail you. How many know
[2:37:27] you've got to have that something that
[2:37:29] when you're under the juniper tree, when
[2:37:31] you're in depression, when you're down,
[2:37:33] Amen. that something holds. Amen. That
[2:37:36] Amen. you won't be the same. Praise the
[2:37:38] Lord. That changes your very nature.
[2:37:42] Amen. And when sickness comes, even
[2:37:44] death, it's still got that reflection of
[2:37:46] God's blessing in it. That's that little
[2:37:49] pool that's deep. It reflects the
[2:37:51] heavens, not that riffling noise of the
[2:37:53] water. Riffling waters are not very
[2:37:55] deep, it's still waters that runs
[2:37:59] deep. May God help us tonight, friends,
[2:38:02] to remember that no matter what outward
[2:38:05] we do, whatever good things we do, Amen.
[2:38:09] though we give our body to be burnt and
[2:38:11] all of these things. If you haven't got
[2:38:13] the love of God down on the inside, you
[2:38:16] are still nothing. Praise the Lord. Now,
[2:38:19] another thing that takes place, I
[2:38:21] believe, I think that any man that's got
[2:38:23] an experience with God or a woman is
[2:38:26] bound to get a little emotional.
[2:38:32] Preacher that preaches and if he really
[2:38:34] gets under the anointing, he's bound to
[2:38:36] get a little emotional. Amen. Bound to
[2:38:40] get all over him. Amen. That's right.
[2:38:43] Bound to Oh, I could stop there. When
[2:38:46] you think about what God has done to us,
[2:38:48] for us in this generation, what he does
[2:38:50] to us daily, it's bound to cause a
[2:38:53] little emotion.
[2:39:00] Amen.
[2:39:02] Praise the Lord. I just believe it.
[2:39:04] That's right. But you know what? They've
[2:39:06] adopted emotionalism for the baptism of
[2:39:09] the Holy Ghost. Amen. And they just got
[2:39:12] a lot of noise and there's nothing in
[2:39:15] it. You live, listen, I like this. You
[2:39:18] live just as holy as you live noisy.
[2:39:25] That's all
[2:39:29] right. Praise the Lord.
[2:39:34] I was thinking about this and I thought,
[2:39:35] you know, I'm probably the noisiest
[2:39:37] person in here, so I better live live
[2:39:41] really. You know what? And better bam
[2:39:44] says, uh, he said, live as high as you
[2:39:47] jump. I probably jump higher than
[2:39:50] anybody. I didn't see anybody else
[2:39:51] jumping off of
[2:39:55] here. I
[2:39:58] jump like that. Get up in the air a
[2:40:01] little bit.
[2:40:03] Anybody want to try it?
[2:40:07] That's right. So, Brother Brad, I better
[2:40:09] live pretty high. Lord, help me. Y'all
[2:40:11] pray for me, will you? Cuz I want to I
[2:40:13] want to live high. You know, I want my
[2:40:16] life to speak loud. How many knows
[2:40:19] actions are speak louder than words do?
[2:40:24] Amen. Are you ready for some goodter
[2:40:27] stuff?
[2:40:28] Oh, this is going to get good here. And
[2:40:30] I'm just going to jump over, I think, if
[2:40:32] I can find it here. I got to be able to
[2:40:35] find
[2:40:36] this. Yeah, here it
[2:40:39] is. Amen. People can jump up and
[2:40:42] down. People can jump up and down and
[2:40:46] shout all night long. Speak with tongues
[2:40:50] like pouring peas on a dry.
[2:41:01] just uh rolling.
[2:41:07] Huh? That's right. And walk out the next
[2:41:11] morning with enough temper to fight a
[2:41:13] buzz.
[2:41:14] That's right. Go right on and tell
[2:41:17] something in the church that'll cause
[2:41:19] the whole church to be broke up.
[2:41:27] Oh my. Hello. It's nothing in the world
[2:41:31] but enticing demon spirits.
[2:41:37] That's right. When you can do something
[2:41:38] like that in action and all of your
[2:41:40] shout and all of this here is Amen. It
[2:41:43] might look good, but down in there is a
[2:41:45] devil.
[2:41:48] Hello.
[2:41:50] Me. Oh, God bless you. We we want to
[2:41:54] brother John and sister Debbie, you're
[2:41:55] leaving tomorrow, right? Before I I
[2:41:57] wanted to say it at the beginning of
[2:41:58] service. We're praying for you. They're
[2:41:59] going to cross the pond over there to
[2:42:01] England and Katie. So, we pray for them
[2:42:03] traveling mercies tomorrow. Amen. God
[2:42:05] bless
[2:42:06] y'all. Amen. Jump up and down and shout,
[2:42:09] speak in tongues and so forth. My think
[2:42:12] about cause the church to be broke up.
[2:42:14] Nothing in the world but enticing
[2:42:16] spirits. Now, I want to say this as a
[2:42:18] pastor. I don't know if this is what
[2:42:20] weighing on me. The fact is, the fact of
[2:42:23] the matter is I've needed a cave for the
[2:42:25] last few weeks. Just a little time of
[2:42:26] get away just to get in a cave and have
[2:42:29] that spill voice talk to me. Amen.
[2:42:31] Because when you're trying to lead a
[2:42:33] church and people, folks, you want to be
[2:42:35] sure that you lead it right.
[2:42:37] Amen. And this this this this scripture
[2:42:41] come this quote came to me, Amen. about
[2:42:44] emotions and our emotions so forth. And
[2:42:46] it actually put up a little bit of a a a
[2:42:49] a warning to me as a pastor. It's put up
[2:42:52] a
[2:42:58] warning. You know why? And I'm going to
[2:43:00] tell you why. Brother Benham says in
[2:43:02] enticing spirits, he says amongst a lot
[2:43:05] of people we find were emotions and so
[2:43:08] forth. Amen. Where the people are real
[2:43:12] emotional. Well, I'm going to put it in
[2:43:14] that way. and so forth. There becomes
[2:43:19] tattlings,
[2:43:22] backbitings.
[2:43:23] Amen. And all kinds of ungodly things,
[2:43:28] brother. That's sulic acid in the
[2:43:30] church. It's demon powers.
[2:43:33] Spirit of men and women get amongst
[2:43:35] themselves and try to push off and say,
[2:43:37] "Well, this one's not right and that
[2:43:39] one's not right." You know, our church
[2:43:41] isn't spiritual like it ought to be, and
[2:43:43] is it? Just watch your mouth.
[2:43:47] This one ain't where you ought to be.
[2:43:48] And this one I just shut up and you keep
[2:43:51] praying. Don't you let your emotions get
[2:43:54] all the better of you. Hello. Because he
[2:43:57] says if you're living on that emotion,
[2:43:58] but it can go the wrong way. I want to
[2:44:00] say as the pastor this morning, quick.
[2:44:05] Amen. Don't think I haven't seen it.
[2:44:08] Amen.
[2:44:10] where my down in Florida I'll tell you
[2:44:12] people got so spiritual they got
[2:44:15] together I don't know if brother John
[2:44:17] some of y'all remember but they'd pull
[2:44:19] off get off the church I'd go you know
[2:44:21] we the Bible says that the five-fold
[2:44:23] ministry is for the perfecting of church
[2:44:25] and just we've got the perfect word and
[2:44:27] we've got perfect faith and so we don't
[2:44:29] need the pre pastor
[2:44:31] anymore pulled off somewhere had a
[2:44:34] little
[2:44:35] meeting even somebody you well know kind
[2:44:38] of got up went off into that meeting,
[2:44:39] got off almost. It was so convincing
[2:44:41] almost that almost carried people
[2:44:44] off. But what was it down on the inside?
[2:44:47] There wasn't something wasn't
[2:44:49] right cuz why? If you've got the Holy
[2:44:52] Ghost, you'll want to stay subject to
[2:44:54] god's word.
[2:44:56] Don't go off somewhere.
[2:44:59] Amen. So I said, be careful. The devil
[2:45:01] try to take that emotion of yours and go
[2:45:03] the wrong way. Keep it just simply
[2:45:06] praising God.
[2:45:10] Amen.
[2:45:12] Hallelujah. That's right. Good one. This
[2:45:14] one's not right. That one's not right.
[2:45:15] And if you'll chase it down nine out of
[2:45:18] nine times out of 10, that's pretty much
[2:45:20] all the time. It's the person that's
[2:45:22] making the stir. Somebody that's
[2:45:24] discontent. Amen. And they'll bring
[2:45:26] discord into church. And I'm here to
[2:45:28] tell you, God hates division in a
[2:45:31] church. God hates discord in a church.
[2:45:36] Amen.
[2:45:39] I'm going to just say a few things. Let
[2:45:40] me say, you know, even our music system,
[2:45:43] even our music, we know that the pastor
[2:45:45] is the overall of the music. Isn't that
[2:45:47] right? He kind of orchestrates it and we
[2:45:50] have to find the direction of it and so
[2:45:52] forth. And if you like a certain song
[2:45:54] and you want to tell the song leaders,
[2:45:55] you know, I I'd like for you to sing
[2:45:57] this song for me today, this, that, the
[2:45:58] other. But there's only one person that
[2:46:00] has a right to go to the song leader and
[2:46:02] say, now I want you to sing a little bit
[2:46:04] more of the modern songs and don't do so
[2:46:06] this. Don't tell the song leaders what
[2:46:09] kind of songs they're gonna say. That's
[2:46:10] my job. Hello.
[2:46:14] How many believes that? Why? Because we
[2:46:16] orchestrated and we want some of those
[2:46:17] newer songs. They're a blessing.
[2:46:20] They are.
[2:46:22] Amen. But do you have to be careful? How
[2:46:25] many know you have to be careful? Amen.
[2:46:27] When you get together and you you begin
[2:46:29] to talk about the church and so forth
[2:46:31] and everything else. Sure. There's
[2:46:33] things that ain't right.
[2:46:35] You can find things about me that ain't
[2:46:37] right if you look hard enough. You're
[2:46:39] not thinking of how that we serve such a
[2:46:42] perfect God. We have a perfect commander
[2:46:44] and that's why we love to follow him.
[2:46:47] But anybody that's human, I don't care
[2:46:49] what you are. If you're a mom or a dad,
[2:46:51] you're not going to be perfect and yet
[2:46:52] you have to teach your children. If
[2:46:54] you're pastor, you're not going to be
[2:46:55] perfect, but yet you have to teach the
[2:46:57] church. It's my job to teach y'all.
[2:47:00] Ain't that right? And yet not perfect.
[2:47:02] God help me. I want to be perfectly in
[2:47:05] his will. But I had thought this, you
[2:47:07] know, I want I want to tell you
[2:47:08] something. We can use more emotion up
[2:47:10] here in the church. Sure. I don't have
[2:47:12] any problem with with All right. Let me
[2:47:15] let me just let me let me let brother
[2:47:17] Brandham say it. Would that be okay? I
[2:47:19] think I can find it.
[2:47:36] All
[2:47:36] right, listen. God's got a bunch of
[2:47:39] people that can shout. Then everybody
[2:47:41] had to shout. Some of them spoke in
[2:47:45] tongue. Listen, somebody spoke in
[2:47:47] tonesues and everybody had to speak in
[2:47:48] tongues. He says, "And they got it all
[2:47:51] like that till it come what?
[2:47:52] Contaminated with entire spirits."
[2:47:54] People enticing people to do emotions
[2:47:57] where they when there's no God in it at
[2:48:00] all. Then they go out and live any kind
[2:48:02] of a life that desire to and call it
[2:48:05] Christian.
[2:48:07] How many believes it's got to go? Your
[2:48:08] life has to go with it.
[2:48:12] Amen. Praise the Lord. I do not have
[2:48:15] that that one quote that I was looking
[2:48:21] for. The wrong emotion. Let's talk about
[2:48:24] the wrong emotions and the right
[2:48:26] emotions. The wrong motion was one time
[2:48:28] in the Old Testament. Y'all remember
[2:48:31] when uh
[2:48:32] uh he put it brother Brandham puts it
[2:48:35] down here
[2:48:36] when I'm not sure which one it was
[2:48:39] Hezekiah or one of
[2:48:41] them or was it Ahab? Ahab got his
[2:48:44] prophets together and one of these
[2:48:47] prophets the preacher he was so sure
[2:48:50] that he was right that he made himself a
[2:48:52] pair of horns and danced all around and
[2:48:54] made a big commotion. He was going to
[2:48:56] push the other Syrian army out. But it
[2:49:00] was a lie. He says God's word said
[2:49:02] different. Amen.
[2:49:06] You can be emotional all right if you've
[2:49:09] got the right kind of emotion behind it.
[2:49:11] The right kind of emotion moving the
[2:49:12] emotion. Amen. They were emotional. They
[2:49:15] jumped. They danced. They did all of
[2:49:16] that. David danced before. His wife
[2:49:19] laughed at him. And God looked down out
[2:49:21] of heaven and said, "David, you're a man
[2:49:22] after my own heart.
[2:49:26] Amen. I'm going to go ahead and say
[2:49:27] something. Sometimes, you know, like my
[2:49:29] wife, she was s back there and she says,
[2:49:30] "But I just felt like getting up and
[2:49:32] walking and and something said she come
[2:49:34] held her back and she says, "No, no. If
[2:49:36] something tells me to go, I'm going to
[2:49:37] go walk." You
[2:49:39] know, I wonder sometimes if you don't
[2:49:41] almost feel like getting up and dancing
[2:49:43] a little bit, you know, but you won't.
[2:49:45] I'll look funny. I don't want Don't have
[2:49:46] a second thought about it. If you're
[2:49:48] anointed to dance, you don't always have
[2:49:50] to just be, you know, dance for the
[2:49:52] Lord.
[2:49:54] Why? Because the Bible says dance to
[2:49:56] him, praise him in the dance, praise him
[2:49:59] in this way, praise him in that way.
[2:50:03] Amen.
[2:50:05] Hallelujah. So David
[2:50:07] did. So just because listen. So just
[2:50:11] because we can emotional don't mean
[2:50:12] we're saved. Amen. Because we go to
[2:50:14] church don't mean we're saved. Don't
[2:50:15] believe those enticing. A real spirit of
[2:50:17] God, a real word of God is the truth of
[2:50:19] God which is the seed of God will
[2:50:21] produce God in your life. You'll be
[2:50:23] godly and saintly and holy. Praise the
[2:50:32] Lord. Praise the Lord.
[2:50:38] You love him this morning.
[2:50:44] Amen. I'm not trying to go long, but I
[2:50:47] am trying to try to get out everything
[2:50:49] that I the Lord laid on my heart to
[2:50:51] speak. I know. I'm trusting that he was
[2:50:53] a blessing to you this morning so far
[2:50:55] that you've enjoyed it. Amen. I know
[2:50:58] that I have by the grace of
[2:51:00] God. Amen. God is good.
[2:51:21] So in closing, I'll go ahead and
[2:51:25] close. I think the quote that I had was
[2:51:27] looking for. He says, "So if you want to
[2:51:29] dance or shout, just make sure that your
[2:51:32] life lives up to that dance, to that
[2:51:34] shout." Amen. I believe that's good.
[2:51:36] Amen. And uh that applies to all of us,
[2:51:39] every one of us. And we want we want to
[2:51:41] be pleasing to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:51:44] Now notice what brother Bram says. What
[2:51:46] hearest thou? It depends on what you're
[2:51:48] listening for. What hears doubt? It
[2:51:50] depends on what you're listening for,
[2:51:52] friend. If you're listening and you hear
[2:51:54] a great revival somewhere, 10,000 people
[2:51:56] are gathered, go ahead. He says,
[2:52:00] listen, but God's not even that God's
[2:52:02] not into great crowds. That don't make a
[2:52:05] difference to him. He says the racetrack
[2:52:07] has that and everything else. Rock and
[2:52:09] rollers have that. But if you go for
[2:52:12] anything else, if you're listening for
[2:52:15] anything else but that still small
[2:52:17] voice, then get back to the cave. Go
[2:52:20] back under that juniper tree until you
[2:52:21] can prepare. Amen. Hold yourself quiet
[2:52:25] and wait. Amen. Let the thunders go by.
[2:52:29] Let the earthquakes go by. Let the
[2:52:31] rushing winds go by, the fire go by,
[2:52:33] whatever it will. Amen. I think of that
[2:52:35] song. Teach me Lord to wait while hearts
[2:52:37] are a flame. How many believes you are
[2:52:40] to wait on the Lord? Amen. To pray.
[2:52:43] Sometimes somebody will be just on fire.
[2:52:45] Amen. Another person will get on fire.
[2:52:48] Amen. And you wish you was. I wish I was
[2:52:51] on fire like that. What do you do? Just
[2:52:53] go in your closet and wait upon the
[2:52:55] Lord. Talk to him about it and let him
[2:52:59] speak back to you. Amen. And that fire
[2:53:01] will begin to burn in you. Amen. But
[2:53:04] wait upon the Lord. Don't do anything
[2:53:06] just in a halfway way. He says we've
[2:53:10] heard many voices. There is so much that
[2:53:13] that'll say come over here to this
[2:53:15] church and and if you'll join our
[2:53:17] church, we'll we have the best group in
[2:53:19] the city, the best dress, the mayor of
[2:53:21] city and many people's in their
[2:53:23] meetings. Lord, have governors and so
[2:53:25] forth come out with many speeches. Lord,
[2:53:28] keep it from me. He says, Lord, hide me
[2:53:30] in a cave and let me wait on you. What
[2:53:33] do I care what the governor says? I want
[2:53:35] to hear that still small voice of my
[2:53:37] savior. Oh, help me to wait, Lord, to
[2:53:40] renew my strength as I wait on you. And
[2:53:44] help this church, Lord, that they shall
[2:53:47] wait upon you and renew their faith.
[2:53:50] Renew their strength. Mount up with
[2:53:52] wings like eagles. Amen. May they be
[2:53:55] listening, Lord, tonight. He says, not
[2:53:57] for noise, not for a shout, but for the
[2:53:59] listening of that still small voice.
[2:54:04] One thing I remember I wanted to write
[2:54:05] down and didn't and that is if you
[2:54:07] really want to see evening light
[2:54:09] tabernacle grow in the power of almighty
[2:54:12] God find that prayer closet have that
[2:54:16] that
[2:54:18] that quiet time that place in the garden
[2:54:21] alone.
[2:54:23] I mean believe that that's really where
[2:54:25] we get our strength is when we're alone
[2:54:27] with God somewhere.
[2:54:29] Amen. And then you'll see the power of
[2:54:31] God.
[2:54:34] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:54:37] Hallelujah.
[2:54:40] Praise the Lord.
[2:54:44] God is good, isn't he?
[2:54:46] Everything decently and in order. and
[2:54:51] seeing our
[2:54:52] children grow in Christ and have that
[2:54:56] same foundation, having that same
[2:54:58] real experience with God in the heart
[2:55:02] that when troubles come, when trials
[2:55:04] come, heartaches come, even death,
[2:55:07] Brother Abraham says, you need that
[2:55:09] anchor that holds. Amen. God bless you.
[2:55:13] Let's stand this morning. We'll just
[2:55:15] turn the order to service. Amen.
[2:55:19] How many is very thankful that we can
[2:55:21] observe
[2:55:22] communion? We like to do that once a
[2:55:25] month by the help of the Lord to
[2:55:27] remember what he
[2:55:29] did. Amen. And the fact that you are
[2:55:31] standing where you are. You have the
[2:55:33] peace in your heart like you have you
[2:55:36] have joy unspeakable in your heart
[2:55:38] because of what he did on Calvary for
[2:55:40] you. Amen. Let's bow our heads. I wonder
[2:55:44] this morning if anybody if you could
[2:55:48] say, "Let me just test you a little bit
[2:55:50] with our eyes closed. I want to test you
[2:55:52] a little bit. And I want to ask you when
[2:55:55] the last time that the Holy Spirit
[2:55:57] really spoke something to your
[2:56:00] heart." Really spoke something to your
[2:56:06] heart. You should be able to say last
[2:56:09] week, maybe this morning, maybe
[2:56:12] yesterday. But remember, he wants to
[2:56:14] speak to
[2:56:16] you. And you realize that he can speak
[2:56:20] through you to you when you're reading
[2:56:22] his word. He can speak to you when the
[2:56:25] preacher is preaching. Hopefully, it
[2:56:27] happened this morning that God spoke
[2:56:29] through my voice and you heard his voice
[2:56:31] even now.
[2:56:34] But I'm thinking something
[2:56:37] special. I know he does that for me when
[2:56:39] I'm working
[2:56:40] and
[2:56:43] and I'll ask him to help me for things
[2:56:47] to go good and I'll pick up a board and
[2:56:51] I need to make a
[2:56:53] cut and that board will be exactly the
[2:56:56] size I need. I'm like, "Thank you,
[2:56:59] Lord." That's how I like to for it to
[2:57:00] go. I like to go good. The Lord is with
[2:57:03] you wherever you are, whatever you're
[2:57:06] doing. And if you don't have that
[2:57:08] relationship with the Lord this morning,
[2:57:09] you want a deeper relationship with the
[2:57:12] Lord this morning, would you raise your
[2:57:13] hand, say, "God, help me go to that
[2:57:15] depth, that love, that depth that really
[2:57:18] holds me in every
[2:57:20] circumstance. I want to shout. I want to
[2:57:22] praise God." We need to worship God in
[2:57:24] that way. We sure don't want to be cold
[2:57:26] and stiff and starchy, but we don't make
[2:57:28] that our anchor. We don't make that our
[2:57:30] religion or our symbol that we've got
[2:57:32] the baptism of the Holy Ghost or that
[2:57:34] we're saved. That is our expression of
[2:57:36] our love back to
[2:57:38] him. We are not as the Pentecostals were
[2:57:42] and as brother Brandham said that it
[2:57:44] didn't do them a bit of good and that it
[2:57:45] wasn't any good. God wasn't in it
[2:57:48] because they rejected Christ ultimately.
[2:57:50] We don't do that. We accept the Lord
[2:57:52] Jesus. We receive him and we worship him
[2:57:55] in that way and we'd never stop doing it
[2:57:57] that way. But we want that deep walk
[2:57:59] that when you come to the hardships and
[2:58:02] trials, when troubles come, that you'll
[2:58:05] be able to commit yourself to Christ,
[2:58:08] that you can lean on God in every aspect
[2:58:11] of your life, and that you can be
[2:58:12] pleasing, and that your neighbors and
[2:58:15] will see Christ. They will see that
[2:58:18] reflection of that deep walk that you
[2:58:21] have. That person has been in the prayer
[2:58:24] closet. They have heard that still small
[2:58:27] voice. That is a real Christian right
[2:58:33] there. I asked something of him the
[2:58:35] other day and he didn't have any problem
[2:58:38] giving or helping me
[2:58:41] out. I was in trouble or I was really
[2:58:45] down or and that person lifted me up,
[2:58:48] encouraged me and strengthened
[2:58:50] me. Maybe somebody would have fallen.
[2:58:54] know I'm just come short of the glory of
[2:58:56] God. Well, get back up. Encourage him.
[2:58:58] Don't just condemn him for things. Lord,
[2:59:00] help us that others could see the
[2:59:03] reflection of Jesus in our life, Lord.
[2:59:05] That's what we want most of all, Father.
[2:59:08] And the prophet of God said, "Then you
[2:59:10] can have all the shouting and all that
[2:59:12] you want as long as that's there." And
[2:59:15] we love you, Lord Jesus, this morning.
[2:59:17] We want to tell you that. And we raise
[2:59:18] our hands to you saying, "God, give us
[2:59:21] all a deeper walk, Lord Jesus. We want
[2:59:23] to walk where Enoch walked. We want
[2:59:25] every one of our children, I want as a
[2:59:27] pastor, I want everybody here to be
[2:59:29] walking in the place that they are
[2:59:31] ready, that they could say, "I'm ready
[2:59:33] to go." As I asked my son the other day
[2:59:35] and we was speaking, Lord Jesus, of
[2:59:37] somebody that perhaps wasn't ready. And
[2:59:40] he makes a statement that I really
[2:59:41] loved. He says, "If I died now, I would
[2:59:44] be ready to go. I would go to glory." I
[2:59:47] said, "I was love to hear that coming
[2:59:50] from my son. That means so
[2:59:52] much, Lord. That's what I want for each
[2:59:55] one here,
[2:59:57] God. That if they would die today, they
[3:00:00] could say, "I'll be in the presence of
[3:00:02] God, in just a short little
[3:00:04] while." Father, we want to be ready for
[3:00:07] your rapture. We have no time to play
[3:00:09] church. We We're past that, Lord Jesus.
[3:00:12] We don't have to be told that anymore.
[3:00:14] We're not playing church anymore. Not
[3:00:16] taking it lightly, Lord. Now move,
[3:00:19] Father, on every
[3:00:20] heart. Come down, Lord Jesus. Now,
[3:00:23] Father, as the hands are raised, go down
[3:00:25] through their fingers, go down through
[3:00:27] their arms, go down through their into
[3:00:29] their heart, Lord, and fill that little
[3:00:31] place, Lord Jesus. If it's empty, God, I
[3:00:34] ask you'll fill it right now. Every man,
[3:00:36] woman, and child in here, we believe
[3:00:39] your word. We receive your word into our
[3:00:41] hearts just now. We receive your spirit
[3:00:44] in its fullness. Let us go from here a
[3:00:47] changed people now in the name of Jesus
[3:00:50] Christ. Amen.
