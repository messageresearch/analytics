[24:45] we're here father to hear from you
[24:47] and see what you would have us to speak
[24:49] and what you'd want us to hear and how
[24:51] you would want to move and just what
[24:53] you'd want to do father and help us to
[24:55] speak a word that would be in season
[24:57] father lord what we have need of hearing
[24:59] today lord jesus we just surrender
[25:02] ourselves see asking god that you'll
[25:04] speak to your people tonight the word

[25:31] lord with us touch from you lord jesus a
[25:33] special
[25:34] lord
[25:35] voice a little word god that you would
[25:37] speak to our hearts that we would know
[25:40] that it's you speaking to us because
[25:42] only you know what's in our hearts lord
[25:44] what we think and what we have need of
[25:47] blessed now we ask in the name of jesus
[25:49] christ
[25:50] amen and amen
[25:52] amen i was just praying and seeing what
[25:54] the lord would have uh just what he'd
[25:57] want us to speak
[25:58] and
[25:59] i know
[26:00] it's always appreciated whenever you can
[26:03] amen have the lord lay something on your
[26:05] heart that
[26:06] you know people will come to you and
[26:07] just say things like you know that i
[26:09] really needed that that was just for me
[26:12] you know
[26:13] and so i mean a timely message is always
[26:16] what we want especially in this late
[26:18] hour
[26:19] and you know we we need that we need
[26:21] that this week we'll need that next week
[26:23] we'll need that next month
[26:25] amen we'll need to the lord for to keep
[26:27] speaking to our hearts the moment until
[26:29] he until we see him in person amen how
[26:32] many for looking forward to seeing him
[26:34] in person amen
[26:36] so we feel him we know he's in our
[26:38] hearts
[26:39] he speaks to us in that way but one of
[26:41] these days
[26:42] amen we're going to see him face to face
[26:45] so we're thankful for that
[26:46] amen so if you will let's turn there's
[26:48] just two scriptures that came to my mind
[26:51] and i thought well you've preached on
[26:53] that before but uh you know i said you
[26:56] lord if you have something different but
[26:57] that just popped right back into my
[26:59] heart and mine
[27:00] and i said okay well if that's the
[27:02] direction you want us to go we'll go
[27:03] there amen
[27:05] amen so we want to and and basically
[27:07] what i feel like is this is something
[27:09] that this is a message that the lord
[27:11] jesus himself
[27:13] tells us and gives to us
[27:15] a warning that he gives us in this hour
[27:18] in the hour in which you are and i are
[27:20] living amen so we're going to
[27:22] revelations 19
[27:24] revelations 19 two scriptures that we
[27:26] want to begin with amen realize the more
[27:28] that i study this more deep it really is
[27:31] amen
[27:32] and so we'll probably just touch touch
[27:34] the tops of it a little bit revelations
[27:36] 19
[27:37] amen i certainly like certainly like the
[27:40] book of revelation don't you
[27:43] especially since we've had a prophet to
[27:45] come and give us the interpretation of
[27:47] it amen
[27:48] uh and so we're so thankful for that
[27:51] but in revelations 19 and down in verse
[27:55] 6
[27:56] it says and i heard as it were the voice
[27:59] of a great multitude amen now this
[28:02] reason i read verse 6 is because
[28:06] amen this
[28:07] voice that he heard
[28:09] was through this multitude and it also
[28:11] ties into verse 7
[28:13] and what it says
[28:15] and i heard as it were
[28:16] the voice of a great multitude and the
[28:18] voice of many waters
[28:21] and as the voice of mighty thundering
[28:23] saying
[28:25] hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent
[28:28] reigneth notice what this voice says and
[28:31] i let us be glad and rejoice
[28:34] amen let us be glad and rejoice and give
[28:37] honor to him
[28:38] for the marriage of the lamb is come and
[28:41] his wife has made herself ready
[28:44] and to her was granted that she should
[28:46] be arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[28:49] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[28:52] of saints
[28:54] amen and he says unto me right blessed
[28:57] are they which are called unto the
[28:58] marriage supper of the lamb
[29:01] and he saith unto me these are the true
[29:05] sayings of god amen now over in matthew
[29:09] the other scripture that came to me was
[29:10] in matthew
[29:12] and this is jesus message to you and to
[29:15] me certainly relevant for our day for
[29:18] our hour and for what we do from one
[29:21] week to another amen what we are doing
[29:25] amen
[29:27] now notice
[29:29] it says in verse 42 and i'm going to go
[29:31] back and pick this up the whole the
[29:33] whole thought of the whole thing but we
[29:35] want to just read this scripture just to
[29:37] let you be seated
[29:39] chapter
[29:40] chapter 24
[29:43] verse
[29:44] 42.
[29:54] he says watch therefore for you know not
[29:56] the hour that your lord must come but
[29:58] know this that if the goodman of the
[29:59] house would have known and what watched
[30:01] a thief would come he would have watched
[30:03] and would have not suffered his house to
[30:05] be broken up therefore be now notice
[30:09] that ready work
[30:10] the bride has made herself ready jesus
[30:13] tells us here therefore
[30:16] be ye also
[30:18] ready amen
[30:20] amen so that's our message from the lord
[30:22] tonight is be
[30:24] ready
[30:25] be
[30:27] ready
[30:28] be
[30:30] ready that's the most important thing he
[30:32] said
[30:33] amen
[30:34] for in such an hour as you think not son
[30:37] of man cometh amen so may god has
[30:40] blessings to reading the word you can be
[30:42] seated i want to go back a little bit
[30:44] first of all i want to read a little bit
[30:47] more but let's go get a little bit more
[30:48] of a
[30:51] background to this to this before we uh
[30:55] basically go into it
[30:57] go back to verse 29 now
[31:00] this is we know that there was three
[31:02] questions asked jesus
[31:04] when shall
[31:06] when shall
[31:08] what was it the question anymore he says
[31:10] tell us when shall these things be what
[31:12] shall be the sign of thy coming and of
[31:14] the end of the world and he goes to
[31:15] talking about how there's going to be
[31:17] wars and destructions and earthquakes
[31:19] and but he says don't fear the end is
[31:22] not yet you know and he talks about
[31:24] pestilence earthquakes and all the
[31:26] different things that happened because
[31:27] he knew that all these things were going
[31:29] to happen over a 2000 year period but
[31:32] down in verse 29 i believe the prophet
[31:34] god brought it and it brought it into
[31:36] perspective he got to talking about
[31:38] being the tribulation period amen in
[31:40] verse 29 on immediately after
[31:42] tribulation of those days
[31:44] shall the sun be darkened and the moon
[31:46] shall not give her light and the stars
[31:49] shall fall from heaven and the powers of
[31:51] the heavens
[31:52] shall be shaken and then shall appear
[31:54] the sign of the son of man in heaven and
[31:57] then shall all the tribes of the earth
[31:59] mourn and they shall
[32:00] man
[32:01] coming in the clouds of heaven with
[32:03] power and great glory
[32:06] he shall send his angels with a great
[32:08] sound of a trumpet and they shall be
[32:11] gathered them his elect from the four
[32:13] winds from one hand of heaven to the
[32:16] other i do not know the exact
[32:18] interpretation of this but i do know
[32:20] that angels are messengers isn't that
[32:22] right
[32:23] amen and there's a gathering together
[32:25] whether
[32:26] where the carcass is there the eagles
[32:28] gather together
[32:29] amen with prophet went across the earth
[32:31] what seven times all the way around
[32:34] seven times
[32:35] gathering that bride out of that uh out
[32:38] of that church isn't that right come out
[32:41] of her and so forth amen gathering
[32:43] together from one end of the heaven now
[32:44] he says now learn the parable of the fig
[32:46] tree and we know that's israel right
[32:49] that's israel when his branch is yet
[32:51] tender and put it forth his leaves you
[32:53] know that summer is nigh amen so
[32:55] whenever we see them become a nation
[32:58] so likewise ye when you shall see all
[33:00] these things that know that it is near
[33:03] even at the doors
[33:06] verily i say unto you this generation
[33:08] shall not pass till all these things be
[33:10] fulfilled heaven and earth shall pass
[33:12] away but my word shall not pass away
[33:16] amen we can stop there and preach about
[33:18] four months right
[33:20] amen that one thing you can count on is
[33:22] that when god says something it's gonna
[33:24] come to pass
[33:26] amen there isn't there isn't enough
[33:28] powers in all of hell to try to stop god
[33:30] from fulfilling his word
[33:33] amen but of the day and the hour knoweth
[33:36] no man no not the angels of heaven but
[33:39] my father only amen
[33:41] so the coming of the lord is going to be
[33:44] a secret the coming of the lord is going
[33:46] to happen in a day and an hour that
[33:49] people are not expecting
[33:51] amen it's going to happen suddenly it's
[33:53] going to for we know that to the earth
[33:56] and to the people of the world it's
[33:57] going to they won't even realize when
[34:00] the rapture takes place because only
[34:01] that any christ shall rise first they
[34:04] won't know until the tribulation period
[34:06] sets in and so forth because he says he
[34:08] comes as a thief in the night to take
[34:10] his bride away two shall be in the field
[34:13] two shall be take one shall be taken
[34:15] amen let me just read it but as the days
[34:17] of noah were so shall also the coming of
[34:19] the son
[34:20] of man be
[34:21] for
[34:22] as in the days of that noah before the
[34:24] flood they were eating and drinking they
[34:27] were marrying and giving in marriage
[34:29] amen
[34:31] until the day that noah entered into the
[34:34] ark and they knew not until the flood
[34:36] came and took them all away so shall
[34:38] also the son of may coming of the son of
[34:40] man be
[34:41] amen two shall be in the field the one
[34:43] shall be taken and the other one left
[34:46] two shall be grinding at the mill the
[34:48] one shall be taken and the other one
[34:50] left
[34:50] amen we know that there's people going
[34:52] to just come up missing
[34:54] and of course we know that thousands
[34:56] come up missing every day
[34:58] amen and it's not going to be a big deal
[34:59] it's not going to be like denominations
[35:01] and people think skies
[35:03] you know jets are going to drop out of
[35:05] the skies and trains are going to derail
[35:07] and oh there's going to be big traffic
[35:09] jams and all this because of all the
[35:11] people that are going
[35:13] no that's not going to be like that it's
[35:14] going to be a very few jesus says even
[35:16] he says if i don't hasten my coming no
[35:18] flesh will be saved
[35:20] well i even find for faith when i come
[35:22] on the earth and we realize we're living
[35:24] in that time where people are you know
[35:27] people live that don't have it on the
[35:28] inside of the inside of the inside
[35:31] sooner or later they just wither away
[35:33] amen amen and they just the people are
[35:35] losing faith you have to have that
[35:37] anchor way down on the inside
[35:40] okay so we see here that eating and
[35:42] drinking building and so forth
[35:44] everything was going on just like normal
[35:47] until that day that it happens amen
[35:50] so it says then two will be taken and so
[35:52] forth but now notice and he says two but
[35:54] be taken now notice as he says jesus
[35:57] tells them something i like it he says
[36:00] now watch i like that because we want to
[36:02] speak on tonight if you're wondering
[36:03] what the title is the title is be ready

[36:21] for that hour because we don't want that
[36:23] hour to take us unawares i don't believe
[36:26] that he's gonna take the bride of jesus
[36:28] christ unawares no because we're awake
[36:31] and we're watching amen and we are not
[36:33] gonna be we're gonna not gonna suffer

[36:49] the signs of the time we can watch
[36:51] around us and we can know in what watch
[36:53] we are and we knowing what watched

[37:04] hour to take nixon a man cometh that's
[37:05] verse 44.

[39:30] do you think that god wants these people
[39:32] that are up in office now ruling his
[39:34] kingdom in heaven
[39:36] no
[39:37] not even close
[39:40] no they won't never beat around they're
[39:42] not going to be there
[39:44] they'll be putting the lake of fire
[39:47] yeah that's right where god destroys
[39:49] them why
[39:50] because god offered a mercy
[39:54] god come and vindicated and prove that
[39:55] it was him and they turned it down
[39:58] i brought malachi 4 right out of the
[40:00] hills of kentucky the greatest prophet
[40:02] ever and they turned him down kicked him
[40:04] out
[40:06] yeah you know they know that ain't
[40:08] nobody can dispute that
[40:10] ain't nobody can dispute it
[40:12] proven over and over and over again
[40:15] you know i was listening to the bible
[40:17] i'm
[40:18] listening to the whole bible here at
[40:20] genesis and i was just listening and
[40:21] listening and listening and i was
[40:22] listening where where moses went out
[40:25] there and god commissioned moses to go
[40:26] down to his people
[40:29] and he says you know how they who do i
[40:31] say that sentiment they're not going to
[40:32] believe me he says well what is that
[40:35] that's got in your hand throw that stick
[40:37] down it turns to a snake and so forth he
[40:39] says he says now he says if they won't
[40:41] believe the first sign put your hand in
[40:43] your body they'll become leprous amen
[40:45] and then they'll put it in again and go
[40:47] away if they don't believe the first
[40:48] sign they'll believe the second one
[40:50] huh how many signs did god do in this
[40:53] generation people still don't believe it
[40:57] multiple over and over and over and over
[41:00] and over again they still won't believe
[41:02] it
[41:03] it's sad ain't it amen all right
[41:08] so he says here
[41:10] now but and if that evil servant shall
[41:12] say in his heart the lord delayeth his
[41:14] coming and shall begin to smite his
[41:16] fellow servants and to eat and to drink
[41:18] with the drunken i'd like to talk on
[41:21] that a little bit because you know it's
[41:22] not necessarily just eating and drinking
[41:25] and you know drinking whiskey and wine
[41:27] and all that stuff but people got to get
[41:29] drunk on all kinds of things
[41:31] people get drunk on pleasure to get
[41:33] money mad to get drunk on the cares of
[41:35] life and money and all these other
[41:37] things
[41:39] people get drunk and all kinds of it but
[41:41] notice how it says that a person that
[41:43] you know begins to
[41:45] think that the lord delays his coming to
[41:47] all this up and become mean
[41:50] and that right to become mean and
[41:52] arrogant and everything else smite one
[41:54] another and oh my that's how do you do
[41:56] when the lord you don't expect the lord
[41:58] to come
[41:59] when you get away from god
[42:02] then it's that the lord of that servant
[42:04] shall come in a day that he don't look
[42:05] for an hour that he is not aware of and
[42:08] shall cut him oh boy we don't want to be
[42:10] in this part do we cut his
[42:13] and shall cut him asunder and appoint
[42:14] his portion with the hypocrite still
[42:17] shall be weeping
[42:19] and gnashing of truth amen
[42:22] great tribulation period praise be to
[42:25] god
[42:26] all right
[42:28] chapter 25 notice he says here then
[42:31] shall the kingdom of heaven be like unto
[42:32] ten virgins which took their lamps now
[42:36] we're going to talk a little bit about
[42:37] getting ready that all right
[42:39] ten virgins that took their lamps and
[42:42] went forth to meet him what is this went
[42:46] forth all about
[42:48] you got to go out this message of this
[42:50] hour is to come out
[42:53] how many believes that it's to come out
[42:54] to go out go out to meet him go out of
[42:56] where
[42:57] go out of all of his sin go out of all
[42:59] this chaos
[43:01] amen go out of churches you got to leave
[43:03] churches nowadays if you want to be in
[43:05] the bride of christ
[43:07] amen
[43:09] let me just stop here take a little time
[43:11] here but we know that
[43:12] when god created adam and eve
[43:16] it was the thought that he had of having
[43:18] his own wife isn't that right
[43:21] and it's the most beautiful thing there
[43:23] is outside of salvation a good wife a
[43:25] good husband that's a bad thing that god
[43:27] could give you but he had something
[43:29] greater in mind didn't he he had
[43:32] something greater in mind he had a
[43:35] thought that he also wanted a
[43:38] wife he wanted a bride
[43:42] amen this bride is going to make herself
[43:45] ready
[43:47] boy
[43:49] now how many knows better bam talk
[43:51] there's a lot of a lot of things where
[43:53] where brother man talked about the
[43:55] vision that he had of that dump and so
[43:57] forth if he goes that way and so forth
[43:59] and you know
[44:01] that it would end up in catastrophe but
[44:03] if if not he does he chose the right
[44:05] path and so forth he says now god has
[44:08] blessed him with being able to what
[44:10] dress the bride
[44:12] another give us the clothing that we
[44:15] need to dress because every bride has to
[44:17] have a wedding dress
[44:20] right and over in revelation 19 chapter
[44:23] we find out that he says
[44:24] she was granted to her that she should
[44:26] be arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[44:33] clean and white represents unspotted
[44:37] huh
[44:39] you don't go smearing a bunch of mud on
[44:41] on on a bride's dress
[44:43] you don't have no ink on it not right it
[44:45] has to be spot it has to be pure it has
[44:47] to be white it has to be clean and
[44:49] that's how god is gonna have a pride for
[44:52] himself without spot and without wrinkle
[44:57] amen
[44:59] but now how many knows that the devil
[45:00] also has a bride
[45:03] the devil has a church now we know that
[45:05] a female is a type of the church
[45:09] right
[45:10] amen she is the type of the church now
[45:13] the prophet taught us you look at the
[45:15] conditions of women and you'll see the
[45:17] conditions of a church
[45:19] amen now you look at the worldly women
[45:21] boy it's terribly bad but even in a
[45:24] local church even in a church here or
[45:26] any church you go to look at all the
[45:28] women
[45:30] huh
[45:31] and you'll see
[45:33] what condition that church is in
[45:36] amen so go visit your baptist church
[45:38] sometime go visit these others
[45:41] it's bad ain't it that's right
[45:44] and so we see here that god is going to
[45:46] have a church without spot without
[45:47] wrinkle amen and these uh virgins that
[45:51] went out if you'll notice
[45:54] amen they went out there was five wise
[45:57] five foolish the wise took oil in their
[46:01] vessels in other words they had the
[46:03] baptism of the holy ghost
[46:07] oil
[46:08] represents the
[46:12] you may go into a church today and
[46:13] somebody say the preacher say something
[46:16] and amen some brother or say hey man
[46:18] there's a sister saying hey man boy
[46:21] everybody turn your head what's going on
[46:24] amen people begin to screaming and
[46:26] slobbering and speaking in tongues and
[46:29] act like a bunch of acts 2 38 children
[46:32] isn't that right
[46:34] them denominations they were like they
[46:36] don't know what
[46:38] to do with all that man they can't have
[46:40] all that
[46:41] they put her out of our church right
[46:43] away
[46:45] amen
[46:47] now over in revelations we look we're
[46:49] gonna let me finish this first
[46:51] all right and at midnight there was a
[46:53] cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go
[46:56] ye out to meet him
[46:58] and then all those virgins arose and
[47:00] trim their lamps i truly believe that
[47:02] that call has absolutely
[47:05] done went forth that it's time to go out
[47:08] and meet the bridegroom
[47:10] because this bridegroom is the word in
[47:12] the beginning was the word the word was
[47:14] with god and the word was god
[47:17] isn't that right so we go and we join
[47:20] ourselves with the word of god amen amen
[47:23] when you come to god you have to what
[47:25] submit yourself what 100 to him just
[47:28] like a wife does her husband and then
[47:30] she submits himself herself completely
[47:33] to him she surrenders herself to him
[47:36] amen and that's what god is looking for
[47:38] how he knows that's what god's looking
[47:40] for us here as we approach him in the
[47:42] rapture time and the catching away he is
[47:44] looking for a wife and husband
[47:47] relationship
[47:49] that's what he wants not just because
[47:51] you're worried about going hell but
[47:54] because you know just as a husband and
[47:56] wife the sweetness the you know how they
[47:58] just know each other and how they just
[48:00] love each other and oh my
[48:04] maybe i shouldn't go down this road but
[48:06] maybe i will
[48:09] you know i was thinking of you know when
[48:11] you're courtney the girl and you know
[48:13] girl you really like her you really love
[48:15] her and you want to impress her man
[48:17] you'll open the car door and man you'll
[48:19] buy her
[48:20] you'll pay for her meal
[48:22] you're gonna hand her that bill
[48:24] right
[48:25] and mine's just whatever she wants you
[48:28] give it to her don't you
[48:30] anything you could possibly do for but
[48:32] that all changes long a little bit after
[48:34] marriage and that's why we got the
[48:35] problems that we do
[48:38] well you sisters don't have to amen your
[48:40] husband might hear but that's the truth
[48:42] right
[48:43] we'd have a whole lot better marriage is
[48:45] if we try to please our wife
[48:49] didn't paul say that a husband sees how
[48:52] that she can please he's his wife and a
[48:55] wife being married sees how she can
[48:58] please her husband
[49:00] amen and that's in a spiritual realm too
[49:02] isn't that right
[49:03] amen we want to please the lord and
[49:06] that's why god is so good to us with
[49:08] everything because he wants to please us
[49:11] that's why he says to ask abundantly
[49:13] that you join me for before i come to
[49:16] give you life for that more abundantly
[49:18] god wants you to have abundant life not
[49:20] some
[49:22] uh
[49:23] drag
[49:25] life shouldn't be a drag
[49:28] no should have abundant life
[49:30] if you're in christ
[49:32] amen
[49:33] i just had that revelation this week i
[49:35] said you know i need to treat my wife
[49:37] you know try to make her and i do but
[49:39] you know just the idea hey you know if
[49:41] we did that more
[49:44] treated our wives as good as we did our
[49:47] well girlfriend
[49:49] when she was our girlfriend
[49:51] everything would be okay
[49:55] that's right
[49:57] all right
[49:58] so let's talk about this false church
[50:01] first of all when we get over into
[50:03] revelations we talk about and i want to
[50:05] i want to give you a picture of the
[50:06] false search what we're to come out of
[50:08] we're going to show you what you got to
[50:09] get away from
[50:11] right what you want what you've got to
[50:13] get away from to really get dressed amen
[50:16] and to be ready to meet the lord you
[50:17] can't be part of because the fact is the
[50:20] public god said that you know people
[50:22] today and the churches today are running
[50:25] without
[50:27] a message
[50:29] they really don't have a message for the
[50:30] people
[50:32] well jesus died two thousand years ago
[50:34] well that's wonderful but there's a
[50:36] whole lot more nowadays
[50:38] we have questions like which church is
[50:40] right
[50:41] you know what's right who's right
[50:44] what's truth what's not truth you know
[50:46] there's all kinds of questions
[50:49] you know why are the lutherans now
[50:51] having a uproar because they have a
[50:55] uh what is it i don't even know the word
[50:57] anymore trans
[51:00] uh
[51:01] trans
[51:02] you know
[51:03] or somebody that's was made from a boy
[51:05] to a girl and they have a problem with
[51:07] him being a bishop
[51:10] transgender yeah having a trans yeah i
[51:13] you got such complicated words anymore
[51:15] but
[51:16] transgender bishop i'm like oh my
[51:19] gracious you mean they let that in there
[51:23] where are we at
[51:25] amen i'll tell you where we're at we're
[51:27] found in revelations
[51:29] in revelation 17 is where we're at
[51:32] when we begin to look
[51:35] at devil and his bride
[51:38] amen
[51:39] now we know that the whole thing you
[51:42] know when it comes right down to it all
[51:44] the way from eve and adam eve to how
[51:46] that you know she committed fornication
[51:48] against her husband and so forth and
[51:50] it's been adultery
[51:52] from the very beginning amen she became
[51:55] a harlot
[51:57] when you cheat on your husband or your
[51:59] wife you know it's harlotry
[52:02] prostitution not prostitution that's for
[52:04] sale but harlotry it becomes like a
[52:06] and so the bible has some strong
[52:09] words all all through revelations you'll
[52:11] find these strong words and i want to
[52:13] show you why revelation 17 it says and
[52:16] there came one of the seven angels which
[52:18] had the seven miles and talked with me
[52:21] saying come heather and i want to show
[52:22] you the judgment of the great that
[52:25] setteth upon many waters if you're
[52:28] wondering what waters are
[52:30] over in the same chapter verse 15 and he
[52:33] says unto me the waters which thou saw
[52:35] us where the seth are peoples and
[52:39] multitudes and nations and tongues
[52:42] so in other words this great is
[52:44] over nations to tongues and peoples
[52:47] amen
[52:48] she has a vast following
[52:51] over a whole lot of people the great
[52:54] horrors
[52:55] i mean he calls her just he didn't mean
[52:58] he didn't diminish he didn't he just
[53:00] called her what she was
[53:02] because to take
[53:03] another man to take another man's word
[53:06] amen over his how many knows jesus is
[53:09] not too happy with that god's not too
[53:11] pleased with sharing
[53:13] his wife
[53:16] amen
[53:17] and so he says you know sitteth upon
[53:20] many waters with whom the kings of the
[53:23] earth have committed fornication and the
[53:25] inhabitants of the earth have been made
[53:27] drunk with the wine of her fornication
[53:30] we know that wine represents stimulation
[53:35] so when i got to thinking about this
[53:37] people absolutely get some kind of a
[53:39] kick out of some kind of a sensation out
[53:43] of committing adultery on god
[53:47] it's terrible i don't know why but to do
[53:50] naturally speaking naturally speaking if
[53:53] you have a woman that has got the wrong
[53:55] spirit on her
[53:57] in that right and she likes to flirt
[53:58] with other guys well guess what you have
[54:01] issues you got problems
[54:03] because it's a spirit
[54:06] a bad woman the bible says is water in a
[54:09] man's blood
[54:10] and vice versa is that right
[54:13] and for some reason we know that we're
[54:15] living in an age of adultery and
[54:17] whoredom and everything else and even
[54:19] the prophet said back in the 60s it's
[54:21] hard to find a virtuous girl you'd have
[54:24] to go to some black woods church
[54:25] somewhere to find one
[54:27] because all the public schools while
[54:29] their law prostitutes before they ever
[54:31] get out of there
[54:35] amen
[54:37] maybe not all but close
[54:39] and where are we at today
[54:42] oh my but notice
[54:44] a stimulation
[54:46] of her fornication a why never
[54:48] fornication the kings of the earth have
[54:50] committed fornication
[54:52] so he carried me away in the spirit into
[54:54] the wilderness and i saw a woman all
[54:56] right a woman a church
[54:59] sitting upon a scarlet colored beast
[55:02] names of full of names of
[55:04] blasphemy having seven heads and ten
[55:07] horns
[55:08] and the woman was a raided purple and
[55:10] scarlet color and decked with gold and
[55:12] precious stones and pearls having in a
[55:15] golden cup in her hand
[55:17] full of the abominations and the
[55:20] filthiness of her fornication
[55:23] now who in the world is this church
[55:28] who in the world
[55:30] who has a cup full of her of the
[55:32] abominations that are forming the
[55:33] filthiness
[55:35] of her for a cake he gets real explicit
[55:37] don't he
[55:39] amen
[55:41] upon her forehead was her name written
[55:43] mystery babylon the great
[55:46] the mother
[55:47] notice it's not just her that's a harlot
[55:50] but she has children she has daughters
[55:54] that are harlots
[55:57] amen
[56:00] daughters that are harlots and
[56:02] abominations of the earth
[56:05] here's another identification mark of
[56:07] this woman
[56:08] this woman i saw was drunken with the
[56:11] blood of the saints and the blood of the
[56:12] martyrs of jesus and when i saw her i
[56:15] wondered with great admiration
[56:18] i don't know exactly what it is that
[56:19] john saw but we know that the catholic
[56:21] church came and it's always decked with
[56:23] gold they have the great cathedrals and
[56:25] everything else and she will admit that
[56:27] she is guilty of killing 68 million
[56:31] people down through the dark ages
[56:34] that was satan's tool church is satan's
[56:37] tool but the bible says that one
[56:39] woman
[56:41] and if you're not dressed right is more
[56:43] of a temptation and the greatest reason
[56:45] for a man to fall to the worst trap
[56:47] there is
[56:48] right
[56:50] but he said spiritually he says a church
[56:53] is the most deceiving thing that there
[56:55] is
[56:56] because woman types church and it's the
[56:58] church that's so deceiving people go in
[57:00] there wanting to be good people nuns go
[57:03] in there wanting to be good people
[57:06] huh
[57:08] but most of them become servants to the
[57:11] priests hello
[57:13] it's just terrible
[57:14] amen
[57:15] and so you see that how that people go
[57:18] into baptist churches methodist churches
[57:21] and the preacher
[57:23] now brother bam taught us he says if you
[57:25] really want to see what kind of a woman
[57:27] she is see what kind of children she
[57:29] brings forth
[57:31] right
[57:33] he says these riggies and these cats and
[57:35] the elvis and preacher lets him goes out
[57:37] the public bathing and everything else
[57:39] and wear these kitties and so forth and
[57:42] come to church with shorts on and pants
[57:44] on i mean those bible says that a woman
[57:46] that wears a garment pertains to a man
[57:48] it's an abomination in the sight of god
[57:53] boy
[57:54] we done
[57:57] got a lot of people riled up there if
[57:58] they all heard this
[58:01] abominations
[58:03] it's an abominations
[58:05] mother of harlots
[58:07] churches
[58:08] how many knows that's what the churches
[58:09] are nowadays
[58:11] i hate to announce it but they're the
[58:12] heartless
[58:13] the denominations out there are the
[58:15] harlots
[58:16] baptist methodists pentecostals
[58:19] pentecostals as much harlotry as any of
[58:22] them
[58:23] they could have jesus come right down in
[58:25] the congregation discern the thoughts
[58:26] and do all the signs and be exactly
[58:28] according the word preach the gospel and
[58:30] then say anybody that goes to those
[58:32] meetings will kick you out
[58:35] if you go and you want to join up with
[58:37] jesus we'll kick you out of our church
[58:39] we'll excommunicate you
[58:42] one man said to brother ben now i gotta
[58:44] take him off the book because he come
[58:45] over there to your meetings
[58:47] well what's that mean i mean ain't gonna
[58:49] make it you are full more foolish than i
[58:51] thought you was
[58:52] brother bran said well something to that
[58:54] extent he says you not
[58:56] not as wise as i thought he says
[58:58] that ain't the truth that ain't true
[59:01] don't you worry about taking if you've
[59:02] been in other words you better get your
[59:04] name off of that book if you want it on
[59:06] his book
[59:08] so they're the prostitute their heart
[59:10] they will absolutely claim to be married
[59:12] to christ and take their own
[59:14] understanding take their wisdom over
[59:17] gods
[59:19] that's why they'll be left in the
[59:20] tribulation period
[59:23] that's why they'll be screaming oh god i
[59:25] thought i was serving all you know
[59:26] there's going to be so much weeping and
[59:28] wailing
[59:29] there's going to be so many people
[59:30] disappointed
[59:32] because they thought they could get
[59:33] ready to their self

[59:37] people that think they're getting ready
[59:39] i'm gonna get ready i'm gonna get myself
[59:41] ready to wait i want to get ready
[59:43] yeah take your way and you're going to
[59:45] find that you if you do get in somehow
[59:48] you're going to be that guy that jesus
[59:49] says you know when
[59:51] there was a wedding and there was a
[59:52] garment this guy didn't have a wedding
[59:54] garment on it the master i mean hey how
[59:56] did you get in here
[59:58] without the wedding garment
[1:00:01] he says find him take him behind him and
[1:00:03] cast him in the outer darkness weeping
[1:00:05] and wailing gnashing of teeth right get
[1:00:07] him out of here
[1:00:09] people want to go people want to get
[1:00:10] there their own way you're not going to
[1:00:12] get there your own way

[1:02:31] angel come down from heaven having great
[1:02:33] power and the earth was lightened with
[1:02:34] his glory and he cried mightily with his
[1:02:37] strong voice
[1:02:38] saying babylon the greatest fallen
[1:02:41] is fallen has become the habitation of
[1:02:43] devils and the hold of every foul spirit
[1:02:47] in the cage of every unclean and hateful
[1:02:49] bird

[1:03:10] committed fornications with her
[1:03:12] and the merchants of the earth are waxed
[1:03:15] rich through the abundance of her
[1:03:18] delicacies
[1:03:21] amen
[1:03:23] look at that
[1:03:26] the kings of the earth
[1:03:28] every time how many knows that whenever
[1:03:31] the pope has a meeting
[1:03:33] all of the even the uh over the middle
[1:03:35] east all of those leaders they'll come
[1:03:37] and they'll join him still be with him

[1:03:42] we ran from that thing
[1:03:43] we didn't want no catholicism we want no
[1:03:46] part of all that because we know what
[1:03:47] they all did but like that look how they
[1:03:49] have come back in

[1:03:55] yeah because boy they they know but here
[1:03:58] they finally to make their way back in
[1:04:01] you know and invading of look at how
[1:04:03] many catholics we have there in in our
[1:04:06] office up there and so forth of course
[1:04:08] we know what brother branham said about
[1:04:09] president kennedy he was the first
[1:04:10] catholic he says you
[1:04:13] who sold your birthright to vote for the
[1:04:15] very thing that we ran from

[1:04:35] come out of her come out of who
[1:04:38] lay out to see her
[1:04:39] come out of that harlot system
[1:04:43] that prostitute system
[1:04:46] of revelation 3.
[1:04:49] how many knows revelation 3 is the
[1:04:51] letter to the churches
[1:04:53] and in the last church age he said and
[1:04:55] unto the angel of the church of the
[1:04:57] laodiceans right these things saith the
[1:04:59] amen the faithful and true witness the
[1:05:01] beginning of the creation of god i know
[1:05:03] thy works that thou art neither cold nor
[1:05:05] hot i would that were cold nor hot so
[1:05:07] that because thou art lukewarm i will
[1:05:09] spew thee out of my mouth because thou
[1:05:12] says i am rich increased with goods and
[1:05:14] have need of nothing
[1:05:16] in other words i ain't got to listen to
[1:05:17] that crank i ain't got to follow all
[1:05:20] that they thought they had all they need
[1:05:22] they did not have all they need
[1:05:24] when your denominational church you do
[1:05:26] not have the need what you need to make
[1:05:28] a rapture
[1:05:31] amen
[1:05:34] well i was preaching this i said just go
[1:05:36] visit the baptist church the methodist
[1:05:37] church oh visit see how the women dress
[1:05:40] when you come into this church look at
[1:05:41] the women how they dress
[1:05:43] and you'll see with the condition of the
[1:05:45] church you're all dressed like
[1:05:46] prostitutes well that's a prostitute
[1:05:47] church
[1:05:49] huh
[1:05:51] it shows more on men i mean on women
[1:05:53] than does men
[1:05:54] all of us know not to come in here with
[1:05:56] shorts and it's like that and the other
[1:05:57] isn't that right
[1:05:58] as our women i'm proud
[1:06:00] i wouldn't be afraid to pray to all of
[1:06:01] our sisters up and say this is to where
[1:06:03] christian dresses
[1:06:04] amen
[1:06:07] but they said they have need of nothing
[1:06:09] and have noticed and noah's not that
[1:06:12] thou art wretched this church was
[1:06:14] wretched and miserable and poor
[1:06:18] and blind and naked i don't think i'm
[1:06:21] going to take this church to heaven
[1:06:24] no
[1:06:25] no
[1:06:26] because you're going to be without spot
[1:06:28] without wrinkle have a dress on of pure
[1:06:32] white
[1:06:33] how many beliefs and that white this is
[1:06:35] the righteousness of saints
[1:06:37] now it says saints but we know that we
[1:06:39] don't have our own righteousness so
[1:06:41] whatever's righteousness you have you
[1:06:43] got from him
[1:06:45] amen and i'm sure that's what
[1:06:49] what is
[1:06:51] his righteousness
[1:06:53] amen
[1:06:54] praise be the lord
[1:06:57] blind and naked that's what the church
[1:07:00] condition was they were wretched
[1:07:02] miserable poor blind and naked
[1:07:05] then he says i constantly abide me a
[1:07:07] gold tried to defy the thou mayest be
[1:07:09] rich and white raymond
[1:07:11] the dumbest be clothed and that the
[1:07:13] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[1:07:15] anoint that i said without eyes with
[1:07:17] eyes if thou may see
[1:07:20] oh my as many as i love i rebuke that's
[1:07:23] what he just got finished doing
[1:07:26] that's why brother brown's message is
[1:07:27] half of brother brown's message it's a
[1:07:29] rebuke to women
[1:07:30] it's
[1:07:31] a rebuke to churches and when he
[1:07:33] preached and said
[1:07:34] denominationalism is the mark of the
[1:07:37] beast
[1:07:40] he was pretty strong and then they threw
[1:07:42] him out
[1:07:44] speaking in tongues is not the evidence
[1:07:46] of the holy ghost
[1:07:48] we'll throw you out for that it just
[1:07:50] showed you didn't have it

[1:10:54] going to be ready
[1:10:56] you can't be part of attack part of that
[1:10:58] how many knows this message when it
[1:11:00] comes it preaches holiness it preaches
[1:11:03] purity

[1:11:14] amen
[1:11:20] brother bram says no you know as a woman
[1:11:22] if she is married to christ the word she
[1:11:24] cannot be married to a church
[1:11:26] denomination at the same time
[1:11:29] for she's bound by it
[1:11:30] she shall not live with both husbands at
[1:11:33] the same time
[1:11:35] and that's what people are doing
[1:11:37] living with preachers that won't preach
[1:11:39] the truth
[1:11:41] amen still claiming that they love the
[1:11:44] lord singing god's music and songs
[1:11:48] but living
[1:11:50] with two husbands
[1:11:52] amen
[1:11:53] she shall be called an adulterer that's
[1:11:55] kandre one to another see
[1:11:57] one is of god and the other one is man
[1:11:59] made
[1:12:01] amen
[1:12:02] what would you do if you
[1:12:04] knew that this church is not of god
[1:12:07] you get out of here quick
[1:12:10] it's the same way with any other church
[1:12:12] if it's not a god
[1:12:15] it's either of god or it's not it either
[1:12:18] stands for the full word of god or it
[1:12:20] doesn't or it compromises
[1:12:23] and that's the deceiving part that's why
[1:12:25] so many will come and say didn't we do
[1:12:27] this and didn't we do that
[1:12:29] they thought they were right but they
[1:12:31] weren't
[1:12:33] amen
[1:12:35] my
[1:12:38] let me tell you a word i was listening
[1:12:40] to a tape and this is what something
[1:12:42] something bill abraham said that i
[1:12:43] really like listen close
[1:12:46] now just watch stay close to christ let
[1:12:49] me warn you know as a minister of the
[1:12:50] gospel don't take any foolishness and
[1:12:53] don't imagine anything
[1:12:54] why because people were having
[1:12:56] oil coming out of their hands and blood
[1:12:58] and this that or the other all kinds of
[1:13:00] imaginations and things that are not
[1:13:01] scriptural
[1:13:03] hello and it all banishes can i say that
[1:13:06] anything that isn't really founded upon
[1:13:08] the word it vanishes it
[1:13:10] it comes to nothing
[1:13:13] and all those little feelings and
[1:13:14] sensations and foolishness all came to
[1:13:17] nothing he says don't take any of those
[1:13:19] things stay right there until until on
[1:13:22] the inside of the inside is anchored to
[1:13:25] the word
[1:13:26] that you're right with christ because
[1:13:28] that's the only thing that's going to
[1:13:29] make it because we're in the most
[1:13:30] deceitful age that we've ever lived
[1:13:33] it would deceive the very elect that if
[1:13:35] it was possible
[1:13:36] many false prophets are going into the
[1:13:39] land
[1:13:40] many false preachers
[1:13:44] see come over here coming over there now
[1:13:46] there's only one place and that is to
[1:13:47] meet god on the basis of his word
[1:13:50] come into christ and he is everywhere

[1:13:56] and they can do the same thing like the

[1:20:11] boy that's the truth
[1:20:13] god let me stand with the principles of
[1:20:15] one man as a minister the word of jesus
[1:20:18] christ heavens and earth will pass away
[1:20:21] but it'll never fail
[1:20:23] on this rock i'll build my church and
[1:20:26] the gates of hell
[1:20:28] shall never prevail against it amen
[1:20:34] praise be to god
[1:20:38] god is looking for a church
[1:20:41] that is not mixed up
[1:20:43] with my idea
[1:20:45] any other preacher's idea
[1:20:48] but is committed
[1:20:50] to god's word
[1:20:52] let god's word be true and every man
[1:20:55] lie
[1:20:56] that's what the bible says
[1:20:58] every man's word let it be a lie and
[1:21:00] mine the truth
[1:21:02] and it is
[1:21:04] amen
[1:21:06] to show you that it is
[1:21:09] like a husband-and-wife relationship
[1:21:11] with god and his church
[1:21:14] amen and i believe that that's the way
[1:21:15] we should live tonight let me in closing
[1:21:17] say i believe that's the way we should
[1:21:19] live
[1:21:20] we don't want to do something against
[1:21:22] our lord because he's also
[1:21:25] our husband
[1:21:27] and we want to please
[1:21:30] our husband
[1:21:32] how many believes he's our husband
[1:21:34] amen that's exactly right he's our
[1:21:38] lord
[1:21:39] he knows best
[1:21:42] amen
[1:21:44] you know
[1:21:45] there's there's churches and preachers
[1:21:46] that take this too far
[1:21:48] but they'll say a woman don't even need
[1:21:49] to do any thinking
[1:21:52] the only thought she should have is his
[1:21:53] thoughts
[1:21:54] because it's go with the word but we
[1:21:56] don't want to have our own thought we
[1:21:57] want his thoughts right
[1:21:59] but people take that too far
[1:22:01] and they play with it and go the wrong
[1:22:02] way with it
[1:22:04] but with god
[1:22:06] we don't really have to have our own
[1:22:08] thought
[1:22:09] because as long as we think his thoughts
[1:22:10] are going to be perfect
[1:22:12] unfortunately a husband
[1:22:14] he can be wrong
[1:22:15] is that right
[1:22:19] i don't know should i say it sister
[1:22:21] johnny
[1:22:22] sometimes men ought to listen to their
[1:22:24] wives
[1:22:29] there you go
[1:22:30] yeah
[1:22:33] amen
[1:22:36] oh my
[1:22:39] they're smart
[1:22:41] i got a smart life i was out there
[1:22:43] putting some more metal on my barn
[1:22:45] yesterday are you ready donna
[1:22:48] and i thought of a joke
[1:22:50] i said honey i got a joke
[1:22:52] i said every good wife laughs at this
[1:22:54] joke she goes
[1:22:59] i'm like oh that was good that was you
[1:23:01] got me there
[1:23:02] every good wife laughed at her husband
[1:23:04] joe yeah right that's funny i thought
[1:23:06] that was good right there
[1:23:08] but anyway
[1:23:10] she's smart i like it smart don't you
[1:23:13] all right but anyway i won't tell you
[1:23:15] the joke maybe later amen
[1:23:19] but anyway so listen
[1:23:21] amen you love the lord tonight i'm sorry
[1:23:23] if that was a little out maybe just a
[1:23:25] little bit out there but anyway i
[1:23:27] thought it was good i mean whenever she
[1:23:29] did that so ephesians verse 22 of
[1:23:32] chapter four why wives submit yourselves
[1:23:35] unto your own husbands as unto the lord
[1:23:38] for the husband is the head of the wife
[1:23:39] even as christ is the head of the church
[1:23:42] and he is the savior of the body
[1:23:44] therefore as the church is subject unto
[1:23:46] christ so let wives be to their own
[1:23:48] husbands and everything
[1:23:49] husbands love your wives even as christ
[1:23:52] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:23:53] forward how many knows it goes both ways
[1:23:57] that he might sanctify cleanse it with
[1:23:59] the washing of the water by the word
[1:24:01] then he might present it to himself a
[1:24:02] glorious church
[1:24:05] now notice
[1:24:06] not having spot
[1:24:08] or wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:24:11] should be holy
[1:24:13] and without
[1:24:14] blemish
[1:24:16] so ought men to love their wives as
[1:24:18] their own bodies he that loveth his wife
[1:24:20] loveth himself for no man ever hated his
[1:24:23] own flesh but nourishes and cherishes it
[1:24:25] even as the lord the church for we are
[1:24:27] members of his body and of his flesh and
[1:24:29] his bone
[1:24:30] and for this cause shall a man leaving
[1:24:32] his father and the mother
[1:24:34] let me just say this you have to leave
[1:24:36] everything else
[1:24:38] if you're going to join with the lord
[1:24:40] nobody believes that might be church
[1:24:43] might be your own ideas might be your
[1:24:44] own ways it might be your own life it
[1:24:47] might be all kinds of things
[1:24:49] but you leave everything else
[1:24:51] you didn't jesus say unless if you're
[1:24:53] willing to say call to follow me
[1:24:56] you're not worthy of me
[1:24:59] and shall we and they too shall be one
[1:25:01] flesh notice the last verse
[1:25:04] that he says he says he's not really
[1:25:06] talking about husbands and wives
[1:25:08] this is a great mystery but i speak
[1:25:11] concerning
[1:25:13] christ
[1:25:14] and the church
[1:25:15] that's who he really was talking about
[1:25:17] when brother branham preached invisible
[1:25:19] union of the bride he says you know
[1:25:21] whatever you husbands your new wives are
[1:25:23] and so forth he made different
[1:25:24] statements and so forth about a wife
[1:25:26] being true to her husband or having to
[1:25:28] confess that to her husband or whatever
[1:25:30] and vice versa and make everything right
[1:25:32] and then he goes on and of course great
[1:25:34] into detail he says you know i'm that's
[1:25:36] i'm not so much talking about tasman but
[1:25:38] i'm talking about christ and his church
[1:25:40] he says you can't be
[1:25:42] to the old denomination of church your
