when we get into Millennium there will never be a hurricane over there Lord amen and we just want to thank you Lord for your love and your mercy tonight bless the thoughts of our heart bless the service tonight bless each one that has come in Jesus name amen and amen we'll get right into the scriptures and then we'll uh amen just have maybe a testimony or two and then before we get started Zachariah if you will go to the book of Zechariah hey man we want to talk on a subject tonight that we will be talking about Amen in 10 000 years from now amen praise the Lord so tonight we want to talk about Grace amen well speak on Grace Zechariah 4 amen a few quotes that I've pulled out of the message the prophet preached on and he used his scripture when he preached on the message of Grace amen and then I want to try to lay a little Foundation but Zechariah 4 1 and the angel that talked with me came again and wake me as a man that is awakened out of sleep I'm gonna move this down a little bit waking out of his sleep and said unto me what's seeth now and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold and with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the ball and the other upon the left side thereof so I answered and spake to the angel to talk with me saying what are these my Lord then the angel to talk with me answered and said unto me know it's thou not what these be and I said no my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain before zeruba pulled out shall become a plane and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace unto it amen may God add His blessings to the reading in the words you can be seated amen tonight amen just prayerful about what the Lord would want me to stay amen because I think a word in season is perhaps worth a lot more words out of season so we always desire the will of the Lord amen and so Amy I kind of got to thinking about the grace of almighty God Amen and how wonderful it is and so we uh was that went and visited our family down there was it the viewing down there or my uncle that passed away while we was going I got a call that my uncle had passed so we went to that viewing uh Saturday night a man got to talk to a lot of my families and relatives and different ones in my oldest first cousin which would have been uh Nevin Nevin was the name of the man that passed away he was 85 years old amen 85. and so his oldest son I go over the farm I got to talk a little bit about to his second second son I believe he was and he got to telling me about how that one he lost the two-year-old boy two-year-old boy 20 23 years ago he meant to a uh a combine accident I guess a horses ran away and he wasn't on it and he was his children were out there around that field and the one one little boy wouldn't come when his other sisters and brothers called him and so forth horses ended up running away and cutting the boy up real bad and and he was talking about how did the head went and got into uh Vanderbilt and how that they were there and of course they ended up losing him and I says you know what that's quite something because about 20 some odd years ago I remember being at Vanderbilt meeting my first cousins that were there and I've never before or after met any of my cousins that I know of at Vanderbilt and they said they were there I guess for their son I believe it was and so and I says I wonder if that was the time and that was pretty close to the time frame because it was Nevin's boy and child and I said you know it was kind of strange but I believe it was that same time I didn't know it but I didn't even talking to him and so forth about it and and then uh my cousin was telling me a little bit about his dad I didn't know him never well I know a lot of my others but there's a big Amish community out down there uh just down past hohen wall down there from Tennessee and and so come to find out that he had 16 children amen so I had 16 cousins that I had never once grow up you know as first cousins and so you know it just goes to show you how I have not gotten around my family and amen I've left my family pretty much you know years years ago and and anyway so I got to talk to a few of them there and he got to telling me how that he uh had 16 children and I said by the same wife and yes he was by the same woman you know so they had 16. and of course I already have 16 uncles and aunts that's just on my dad's side okay but a lot of those are half ants and half angles because he had eight by one mom woman and then eight by another so but it's anyway it's 16 and so I found just this one now this was a full full-blooded brother of my dad's Nevin was and um uh they said that he had six tuned children you know or 16 children and then he said he has 150 grandchildren amen and uh so I'm believing that this is true and he had 300 great-grandchildren so that's just by one of my uncles so that tells you a little bit about the relation I have that I don't know nothing about amen but amen I certainly you know and going back there and sitting in an old house you know sitting on the hard benches and shaking their hands and seeing my sister there and different ones you know it just brings back old memories you know of what it was like growing up amen and horse and buggy and uh you know the the staunchness of them and how they really don't change and so forth and you know it really your heart really goes out you know for him realizing you know that they're in that and believing that that's gonna it's gonna be what takes them to heaven and so forth and of course I asked my my first cousin the oldest one that's at the house he says well how was it with him and so forth and he says I guess it was all right you know and he had done a lot for him and he says I'm about it I'm sure he appreciated all that we've done for him but you know they they just kind of have a hope that you're gonna make it and so you really feel for them and I think about how that really you're watching all them little ones and all of those that are in that and if God don't do something to break you free from that most likely that's what you're going to be and of course once you marry and so forth and then you kind of get in ingrained in that and that's pretty much the course that you take but my heart went out to him to think about how that have that much relation and there they are to me trapped in a cage you can't get out don't realize what's out there don't realize the freedom that they could have the joy that they could have and have no Glimpse really of perhaps a lot of them even my cousins you know that they have never had a glimpse of this generation you know and I thought about how that it would sure be nice if I could take a bunch of books you know perhaps God sent a prophet and to South Africa life story anyway anything you could do you know for them you know but it's very hard because it doesn't take long once you get your foot in there or whatever the rumor will go around real quick you know that you don't listen to him and do this out of the other and and so forth but you know I just really feel for him and I've I kind of felt like Paul did talking about uh they're in Romans how that he wished himself a curse for his Brethren he loved him so much amen it's all the love that you have as much as you love them you realize that it's only the grace of God it's all by the grace of God and I got to thinking of how good how precious the grace of God really is and you know I thought about how that the grace of God is something that to us should never get old you know we're going to be singing about it in 10 000 years from now man how knows that it better be I'm talking about it you know what what you're going to hear me talking about and singing you'll hear me singing Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound let's save the rich like me amen but you know sometimes we forget but I believe it's something that always comes back to us at least it does me and it's always As Good As It Ever Was when you think about how good God was to save me tonight with the help of the lord we want to look and understand amen I wrote down here you know I believe it's D.L Moody brother bam said when he really realized what Grace was you ran out in the streets and met somebody and said do you know Grace Grace who you know and he said you know Amazing Grace how many knows it's simply amazing so I wrote down here as you know getting let's get to know Grace better how many wants to get to know Grace better tonight so that's what we want to do with the help of the Lord helping to understand what Grace really is amen what it means to us Ephesians 2 amen I want to read 2 and 1 through 10. praise the Lord and you has he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins Hallelujah I mean it's glad to be alive amen amen by the grace of God we're in times past you walk according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit did not worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom we also have had our conversation in times past in the lust of the flesh prevailing the desires of the Flesh and the mind and Word By Nature the children of Wrath even as others now I understand the prophet of God when he come along he says look you were not a child of the wicked one year or of the Disobedience but you just had their nature how many knows that because if you're actually a child of the devil there ain't no way you'll never come to it God could beg plead and do whatever you wanted to but you never desire you never want it amen just like Cain he didn't want it even though it was offered to him on a silver platter by God himself amen amen by the children of Wrath even as others all right we were my nature but God who is rich in Mercy praise the Lord I mean he's glad for his Mercy love mercy and Grace go hand in hand now brother bam said love and love and grace our twin sisters I believe tonight that Mercy is in there somewhere too amen cause love always produces Mercy mercy and Grace all go together and then even when we were dead in sins have quickened us together with Christ for by grace are you saved and as bases up together and made us to sit tonight in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah he knows raised it up and made us to sit together that any ages to come he might show now notice that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace in kindness to our us through Jesus Christ for by grace are ye saved through faith and not and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God praise be to God now notice if you'll notice here this headstone that we've already read a reading about in uh in Zechariah there was a headstone that that was to come this is what Madam says now right after reading those cerebral scriptures he says now we're all acquainted with this scripture that reads in the Bible we know that this was during the time of the preparation of the restoration for of the Temple was was a great Prince among the people who had laid the foundation of the building now I want you to put on your spiritual thinking amen anointing jacket this morning as we think and this great Prince had determined to rebuild the house of the Lord and then when he did he had laid the foundation stone and as we read further we find that at God that's rubable has laid the foundation with his hands he also shall bring forth The Headstone and then I want you to notice he never said that he shall bring forth the Cornerstone he shall bring forth the headstone and we know that the scripture said that Jesus is the Chief Cornerstone and he's also the headstone now it will think in it for a few minutes that the seventh church not like this praise the Lord because we can think we can read between the lines we can put on our thinking cap but when brother Venom explains it you don't have to do too much thinking anymore you know what he's talking about but we want to hear right not my thinking but we want to have the correct interpretation we want to understand what he's saying all right now that the Sabbath Church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the father there's in other words to rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit not by power nor by might but by my spirit saith the Lord not my organization not by denomination but by the holy spirit will bring forth the church in these last days now according to the prophecy there will come ahead Stone and one I want you to notice that when that headstone comes the prince is going to cry out the message will grow out Grace Grace Grace praise the Lord now notice when this capstone's coming how many knows this is a Capstone message this is the Capstone message and it's something that cries out in a million cries out in you that oh my oh my amazing Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound that same Wretch like Me oh my Grace before we realize that God is the one that hands out Grace he gives it to whom he will to whomever he will oh my praise the Lord it's he's it's giving out Sovereign Grace now how many has heard that the meaning of Grace or what Grace is is Grace is unmerited favor with God in other words you don't deserve it you can't work for it you can't labor for it huh it's unmerited favor with God Grace is when you deserve to die but you're given lights you are a sinner you're lost you're undone but God picks you up and does something for you now I didn't go into all the quotes and things but you know that according to the prophet of God he didn't think it'd be a handful of people that'll make it to the rapture how many knows you read them and you you wonder if anyone would be saving you just Jesus said well I even find faith when I come back to the Earth I am and then he typed it he said you know according to Israel and when they came out and what they did is they came out two million strong and out of that original Bunch that went out only two made it now let me tell you those are uh what do you want to call an overwhelming inconceivable odds because I can't imagine a flood of people two million people and two people yeah had all these things but yet they all perished so brother baptized you take that type he says you killed go with one out of a million he says there's about a 500 million Christians and if it was one out of a million about 500 people would go in the Rapture 500 people left here and he says nobody even notice just a small number [Applause] Oh I thought about how that man you think about the people that are out there think about all the churches all the Amish world the Pentecostal the Baptist the methodists they think about all of those people who talks about how today would come in that day and they would say did we prophesy did we do this didn't we cast out devils and do Mighty things but he will say depart from me thank you oh my the time for meals and there's Millions but the Bible says there's millions and billions of mimics of Christianity so many people claim to have that Grace and no God but they really don't I want you to know something if you know and believe in your heart with all of your heart that you're a child of God you're a privileged person now I wrote down here what does it take to make you happy uh what does it take to make you happy as a Christian there's a lot of time people amen they want more knowledge they want more Revelation they want more uh you know understanding and a lot of times that knowledge a lot of times concept the Bible says it just brings Pride people want prestige they want to understand and know more even in the Bible next it talks about a certain group of people that they were always wanting to hear somebody else talk because they want to have more understanding of things then you have other people spiritual what that makes them happiest if they're standing in the spirit if they're speaking in tongues it's prophesying huh and that's what they like helps they like to dwell in the Realms of emotion is that right people like to be emotional that makes them happy they go on feelings other perhaps signs have enough Faith to move mountains or do spines do Miracles this out of the other but to me tonight what makes me happy is to know that I'm a son of God I was thinking doesn't the scripture say something about that you should be satisfied or with Grace you know Sonic Grace should satisfy you you should be settled with Grace amen Amazing Grace let me tell you something when I got to thinking about Grace it is absolutely amazing amazing praise the Lord Amazing Grace you think about it the Bible talks about Matthew 24. he says If any man come to you and say Lord here is Christ and there is Christ believe it not for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall sow great signs and wonders and so much that if it were possible it would receive the very elect how many knows we are living in a very deceiving age Revelation it talks about all who shall wander after the Beast they'll all be deceived whose names are not written in the last book of life from the foundation of the world right how many knows that tonight I want to say that Grace Amazing Grace brings you and it leads you to not be deceived [Music] because there'll be many people that are deceived I'm at least this message that God brought it's just don't take this Mark don't take it don't be deceived so my question to you tonight is how do you know you're not deceived well I got to thinking about that because you know you want to know you want to be sure about what you believe you want to be sure about where you stand for one thing the Bible says by their fruits you shall know them because we know that what did he say in Saul's in prison now and no no it was in 191 anointed ones at the end time remember as you know the Bible says the rain falls on the just and the unjust when you come to the Pentecost around me seeing this man sitting back there amen prophesied speaking in tongue and talk to Zion and so forth he come to pass and then he seen he shook his hand or something to see that he was living with a woman that he's not supposed to be with all messed up in his marriage limited sin and brother back to this truck or whatever and he says God how can this be I don't understand this God opened his Bible and showed him he says he says you know the rain falls on the just and the yeah what do we understand by the grace of almighty God he said he's got to go further than just your flesh it's got to go further than just speaking in tongues and being able doing all of that and having faith to move mountains to see the devil's cast out and all that he's got to go deeper than that It's gotta go all the way down to where It's gotta be down in your life cause your life is your soul you've got to be changed on the inside your very Nature has to be danger desires have to be changed and you're deceived if you know that God has come down and work in you and you know it's amazing grace is gonna make you the happiest person in the world cause y'all out of a million people God is Grace on you he asked the new Grace unmarily favor Grace never gets old [Music] even though brother Brown says it's as old as time why is it as always time because Grace is God because love produces Grace and God is love praise be to God aren't you glad I'm glad for Grace then I go back to my favorites my famous scriptures that I love so much John says behold behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us Bill what matter of Grace that God has bestowed upon you that you should be called the son of God huh oh what great love ominous that God's grace and God's love looks to something before God just gives you Grace right before he just hands grace to you hands Mercy to you huh he don't do it to anybody anybody does it no there's millions that he don't over in Romans let's read here for a minute Romans 9. here is Paul certainly that's the scripture that came to my mind in the last week I say the truth in Christ I lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart for I wish that myself would be a curse for Christ's sake for the brethren my Kinsmen according to the flesh who are Israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises amen man people will drive horse and bug and they'll live real strict all their lives because they think that's going to do something for them amen and according to denying of the flesh you think that surely God would get a hold of us you know and it was strange hearing from my my second first cousin the second one line of the 16 he says you know that day before all of this happened he said something told me something was going to happen today huh to hear something spiritual coming from them it's kind of different amen something was going to happen but he didn't know what and you know how he shook it off uh I don't know what it is and just go on you got to go on and he didn't of course he did all right whose are the fathers and of whom being at the flesh Christ came to whom who is over all God be blessed forever amen not as though the word of God had taken non-effect for they are not all Israel which are Israel praise be to God you know that was one thing that the prophet had to overcome man he had such a love such a passion for people and yet you know the last difference and everything he Continental word and they wouldn't do it got discouraged and wanted just to go to the mountains forget people huh you pretty much wanted to forgive people why because he was so discouraged because you put all that out and then nothing comes back and the people just just get it and he had to get his feeling back and realize you know not everybody's called he realizes not everybody's an eagle amen not everybody's blessed like what you and I are how many believe you're blessed if you're a child of God you are a blessed person folks I don't have to have great emotion I don't have to have this that or the other just let know that I am a child of God just let me know that I'm one of his and I'm Gonna Be Happy that's what makes me happy Amen on down these are because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the sea for This Is The Word of Promise at this time I will come and say I shall have her son and not only this but on Rebecca he goes right to another one Rebecca had conceived one even by Our Father Isaac for the children not yet being born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not it works but of him that called so he was said unto her the elders Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have a love and he so have I ate it where I'm going this evening is that disgrace looks back to the election Grace looks to election because God don't just give anybody Grace huh you really don't no you see how many knows God knows a man's heart he knows what's in man he don't make mistakes why do you think the people that claim to have the grace of God claim to know the grace of God they are the ones that make a disgrace if they don't really have the grace of God because the grace of God will clean you up the grace of God will make you do right live right amen and if it ain't God it's disgrace amen oh my all right let's go on what shall we say them verse 14. it's the unrighteousness with God God forbid he says for he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy amen and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so it is nor him that about us but it's God that's great how many leaves that tonight praise be to God are you a recipient of his grace I'm not sure but it seems like the prophet of God said somewhere he says you know that I am a product I am a manifestation of the grace of God of the grace of God foreign Hallelujah aren't you glad to be associated with the grace of almighty God to think that there's billions there's Millions God could have chose beside you but if he picked you you are real special the most special thing you'll ever possess in this earth is to have the understanding to know that you are a child of God Christ be to God doesn't matter what else comes goes doesn't matter how horrible your death is as long as you know you're a child of God folks I was thinking today and I was looking at the clouds and the great creation that God has made and just enjoying it and I thought you know but this isn't even this real that's what it's like when you die and go to the other side that's what the prophet said it's more real over there than what this ever will be amen oh my Lord help us not him that will it nor him that runeth but it's God that shows Mercy I saw love mercy and Grace I saw love mercy and Grace that is so full of grace so full of Mercy I mean Lisa oh my God all right but that God just before he talks about Pharaoh even for this purpose if I raise the up so it looks to election God looks at election God looks at what's in you what's inside of you he knows what's inside of you what does that mean he knew you and what you do that you would have let's just be honest that you'd have that c Gene of God on the inside I mean please without that c Gene in the genetics of God a way that you'll ever come to the full surrender to God now you'll always be reserved somewhere that's why so many people can go so far with the word of God but can't go all the way huh because there's something wrong in the genetics something in the makeup praise be to God aren't you glad for that thing to think that God had Grace on you why do you think that as this headstone comes we have a better understanding better knowledge of what this The Riches of his grace isn't that what uh Ephesians said there all right verse seven that in the ages to come he might show exceeding Riches of his grace Amen in his kindness in Jesus Christ we've never understood even in front of God he could how can that man be such a hypocrite and still speaking talk dance in the spirit Where's God huh folks I'm here to tell you for a lot of them it's preachers behind the pulp and preach like a freight train coming at you preach like God oh my but just be careful there will be something wrong somewhere huh something will be wrong somewhere if they aren't exactly right with God praise be to God he didn't understand exactly how things could be but we've learned hey you know people can have it on the floor huh open hauling my case be to God get your Habit in the spirit oh they can have the Holy Ghost on the spirit isn't that right the band says take your heavens the genuine holy ghost on the spirit Realm they can speak in tongues like torn Peas on the guy go hide or something or a piece of paper or whatever I

popped that little hinge off there and all of a sudden when I did all the pressure was lit off when I took my screw and pop it off and it was way too much for my little thin stick over there it popped over there and the whole windshield crashed and smacked down over top of my head I had my hand up there in the crack all right it's not so swelled anymore but it come across there and almost completely crushed my hand and it would have but by God's grace it's somehow that just an angel of the Lord I believe help me just grab that lid before it goes any further because it was ready so bad

worse but I thank God for watching over me and I thought you know that's just the devil and I thought they will talk back to me he says why you blame me for everything don't you think that was just your carelessness you should add something a whole lot more than a little old ride over there right I get the blame for everything oh well maybe I shouldn't blame you for everything I didn't see any wicked demons knocking that thing out and all of these other stuff maybe had nothing to do with it you know what I thought I had I had an answer for him this is what I told him no no if you were to cause Eve to fall I wouldn't have had this is it your fault I said it's your fault I said from now on anything bad happens in my life you're getting away anything at all you get the blame and anything good that happens I'm crediting God for it oh thank you to God blame the devil there would never be nothing happening bad if he wasn't for what he did any in regarding Choice oh his fault it goes

he does what he wants to do with it isn't that wonderful amen he can save the vilest he can save the worst he can save the impurus he can say the immolest I mean I've got thief on the cross he was worthy of death no doubt he had probably murdered somebody some man and woman's child perhaps or some mom or some dad killed somebody perhaps and that Phantom might say no I want to see him hang I want to see him die but that man had something in his heart he says when you come to your come to Paradise remember me isn't that right remember me and Jesus turned and looked at him he says today I

just really killed him just love them he's in a whole different world hey man praise be to God he can save who he wants to he can make the vile of Sinner clean let me tell you something right now the church and those prophets and so forth that were in the book of Acts whenever Saul was persecuting him even conscending to the stoning of Stephen huh taking people's thoughts while they stoned them what a cold-hearted mean person huh but yet God did what he reached down his hand even Paul said I'm the chief sinner why because he didn't just go out drink and smoke no he came after God's people and persecuted them even to the death you don't do much worse than that huh he was the violence he said on the word Setter but God realized I did it in ignorance he did it in ignorance do you know one of the greatest places of our blessings lay the greatest blessings lays right here bless it are your eyes for the sea and blessed are your ears for they here I mean please your eyes of understanding he tried to fellow people God sent a prophet in this generation that's you realize that should be to me that's one of the one greatest things you can tell in person ask this question what do you think about all these different churches claiming to serve the same God if that doesn't get their little mind going I don't know what will and then tell them that God has sent them Prophet to straighten it all out to let you know what is the right way and they have to choose whether they want to listen to you or not isn't that right then they have the truth well I don't believe God does that doesn't matter what you believe or think God did do it he did do it he said I sent you a lie to the prophet before the great deal is the grace of almighty God that pulled us out of those cages it's the grace of God tonight that you're not some certain denominational Church are you with me caged up the Bible says that dead become the cage of every unclean and hateful bird they're cages for the prime sister nothing but a bunch of cages he didn't have his farm huh why and deceived I mean those are deceived that's sad it's so sad but it's truth very few are gonna make it very few have their eyes opened you're a privileged person to understand you don't have to be Mennonite Amish Baptist Presbyterian Penny calls or any none of that you have to be a Christian [Music] it's not about well I'm a member of evening light Tabernacle that don't do nothing for you huh no there's only one thing that does something for you only one thing that counts to you for anything and that is the grace of God and your relationship with Jesus Christ because our Prophet didn't point us to no church he clearly said it on the back of the tapes on the same he says I don't point you to a church I don't I'm not here to build a denomination start another church or another movement or this out of the other I'm here to bring man to a closer relationship with God how many of these side it was Grace to this generation they don't want that Grace but you and I do and I'm thankful for that Grace praise be to God it was Grace that saved me how many believe that it was Grace that called you it was Grace that elected you can't you see election that if God did something in your life you changed your heart change your soul change your desires and he's given you a fellowship with him that has told you that your name is on the book [Applause] everybody under the Earth on top of the Earth around the earth heard John scream her John praise God when he seen his name on the book he recognized who he was he found his true identity no my everybody heard him scream I believe it's John's a type of the church John's the type of the Bride when the bride realized who she is she can do the Greater Works because why it's not the chair she realizes him doing it I don't care what it is I don't care what my situation is amen it is God that is in control praise be to God that's how I want God in my life every aspect Lord I see you here Lord I see you there amen amazing wow I stand I stand in all of you amen it's awesome it's amazing Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound that saved a Wretch like Me I once was lost but now I'm found I was blind and you still would be if it wasn't for the grace of God opening your eyes if it wasn't for the grace of God opening your ears you'd still be in the dark you'd still not understand you would be deceived amen because it would be so deceiving Matthew 24 24 says that if it was possible it would deceive the very elect Billy Graham I believe one place I'm made a statement he said it's so deceiving that even the elector being deceived brother Brown came back and corrected it praise be to God he says that's not what the word says the word says that if it was possible if it would only have to be worded just a little bit different it's because it says uh if it was not if but it could possibly deceive the very elect it is so deceiving that it can't possibly that gives it a possibility of happening but he says if it were possible hey man I'd be glad for that come on now hold your seat if it were popped it's not possible the light can't be deceived she's elected not to she's going to have her eyes open to the deception and say how many knows Satan Satan is coming in like a flood and it is the grace of God that holds you that song says uh through many dangers toils and snares I have already come amen to us grace that brought me save this far it will be grace that takes me home how many leaves that it was Grace that called you it's Grace that holds you and guardian angels are around us Christ be to God and it's the grace of God will take us home and when we've been there Ten Thousand Years bright shiny as the sun our wife is in our glory and our praise going up to him ten thousand years later we'll have no last days to sing God's Praise of his grace and when we first begun don't you let it get too old to you the grace of God unmerited favor it wasn't you it was him seeing something in you opening your eyes oh I believe that ah you can't just say that let's open it you know I believe that really God did that the prophet Christ did do the same things today as he did when he walked on the Earth give me a tape I want to hear it huh let me check this out when you hear it you realize hey this guy don't play around he's he he's not trying to get popularity I mean look at how he's preaching against those that claim to be crazy oh that's so better man I'm hit against people so hard we talk about legalism but buddy I'll tell you what if you looked at Brother Band look at how hard he was on cutting hair and wearing pants and all these other things it was because people who claiming to be Christians were acting that way and he condemned them for it amen because you wouldn't act that way if you as a Christian amen you men you smoke it's that and the other this you know get a check on your life you better check your life make sure that those things are out of there amen because how many believes I believe God is getting a people ready oh my do you believe I said people put your name in there I believe God is getting ready [Music] and then we'll get you ready a little bit selfish there right yeah but the better bands say it's the only one going out of the evening like Tabernacle what'd he say well I want you to go well I do but I'm leaving folks you believe that you're that one going I'm his with me that's right uh we won't we won't have no open discussion because I know I'd have an argument right here leaving isn't that what we'd have I'd hope so you love the Lord 20 after eight can I tell you one last story I'm gonna read your story about Grace amen Amazing Grace God's grace is like this let me tell you a story in ending God's grace is like this one time there was a mighty king and this mighty king had a son and it was his only son and one day a murderer killed that boy and through that Kingdom when the delegates hunting for that murder and they finally found that murder and when they found him they brought back and imprisoned him and when they did it trial was set and the sentence was made oh it was a terrible thing he had murdered the King's son and he knowed but he was coming to him they put him in the inner cells locked him and locked the doors and put pads and so forth guards around it because we know what kind of a horrible punishment this was the boy was going to receive because he had killed the King's son the Royal King's son guards was placed all around the doors he was putting the Inner Cell stripped nothing but a loincloth and there he was set there in that condition starving wouldn't even give him nothing to eat he said in that condition and they brought him up to trial and he was found guilty and proven guilty and sentence was made and he was to be executed under horrible capital punishment he was to be killed by inches until his mortal life was gone sentenced by the judge and was to die and he begged and he cried and he says oh though I am guilty though I am guilty I am sorry that I did it I wish I had never done it I'm so sorry I did it in the moment in a rage of temper I did it I didn't mean to do it that way one day the king went down to the Palace to visit the boy to tell him talk him tell him about it killing his son ask him about killing his son the only son he had he killed that boy he says I'm going down there to talk to him and he went down there he looked back at that cage like a caged an animal he saw a little skinny body being there in a corner crying his face all sunk in this jaw sank back his eyes way back matter was all over his eyes and his mouth was Whited over no water thirsty laying there on his face crying and the King said stand up they come up to him he looked at him he says why did you kill my son what did my son do to you what did he do to Merit such a death as you killed him stabbing him to death with the spirit he said nothing my Lord not one thing just my own impotence just my own ways I killed him because I was jealous of him and I got in a temper fit and I killed him said I'm to die under the Earth Justice sir I realize and I deserve it only thing I'm crying for I'm just so sorry that I killed that Royal man like that Without a Cause and the King turned on his heels and walked out went back to the desk and said destroy all the records you know put them in the sea of forgetfulness destroy all the records wash them up bring him up here now send down the road for him after a while a great big limousine so to speak drove up to the door but it did a carpet was spread out to the prison cell the king stood at the end of the lemons his son come said come my son and ride home with me to the Palace put the king's robe upon around his shoulder he said from henceforth you are my son because he had pity he was sad that he did it but the map says that's Grace that was me that was you we killed the Son of God with our sins we were alien dirty filthy laying in the cells of the world and God washed Us by the blood of his own son cleansed us cleaned us up put a robe of the Holy Ghost on and now a great Chariot of God will back up to the door someday and we'll go home to live with him and all the records are destroyed we can't be judged no more burn them up he put them in the sea of forgetfulness and remembers about it no more no wonder we can sing Amazing Grace how sweet to sound that save the Wretch like Me let's stand musicians if you'll come I once was lost but now I'm found I was blind but
