[31:25] amen
[31:26] if you will open your bibles we'll just
[31:28] get into the word for a little while
[31:30] tonight
[31:30] just a simple little thought that i feel
[31:32] like amen we certainly have spoken
[31:34] before but
[31:35] amen i don't know why the lord has me
[31:37] going in this direction but
[31:39] amen i'm sure that he has it for a
[31:41] purpose
[31:42] and i pray that it'll be a blessing to
[31:44] you amen
[31:46] um so did you mention that brother david
[31:49] about timmy parish or no
[31:52] you did okay i just i was probably busy
[31:55] studying and i didn't know for sure and
[31:57] they had asked me to
[31:58] make sure to mention that so we want to
[31:59] make sure to remember him in prayer
[32:00] tomorrow
[32:01] in a special way too amen
[32:04] let's turn our bibles to saint john
[32:08] saint john 8.
[32:19] and then also hebrews
[32:22] i'm going to hebrews the 12th chapter
[32:25] but let's read saint john 8
[32:27] first and we'll begin with
[32:32] verse 30. and as he spake these words
[32:36] many believed on him
[32:38] then said jesus to those jews which
[32:40] believed on him
[32:42] if you continue in my word then ye are
[32:44] my disciples
[32:45] indeed and you shall know the truth
[32:50] and the truth shall make you free
[32:53] they answered him we be abraham's seed
[32:56] and we're never in bondage to any man
[32:59] how sayeth thou ye shall be made free
[33:02] jesus answers them verily verily i say
[33:05] unto
[33:06] you whosoever committeth sin is the
[33:09] servant of sin
[33:10] and the servant abideth not in the house
[33:12] forever
[33:13] but the son abideth forever if the son
[33:17] therefore shall make you free
[33:19] you shall be free indeed
[33:22] over in hebrews the 12th chapter verse
[33:24] 1.
[33:36] we're foreseeing we also are compassed
[33:39] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[33:42] let us lay aside every weight and the
[33:45] sin
[33:45] which does so easily beset us and let us
[33:48] run with patience the race that is set
[33:50] before us
[33:51] looking unto jesus the author and finish
[33:53] of our faith who for the joy
[33:55] that was set before him endured the
[33:57] cross despising the shame
[33:59] and is set down at the right hand of the
[34:02] throne of god
[34:03] may god had his blessings to reading in
[34:04] the words you can be seated
[34:06] i want to talk tonight for a little
[34:08] while about
[34:11] freedom and bondage bondage and freedom
[34:15] amen amen so that's what we want to
[34:18] speak on with the help of the lord
[34:21] if you notice here jesus talking about
[34:23] he was telling them that whoever the son
[34:25] makes free
[34:26] is free indeed amen
[34:29] and when we think about that we go back
[34:32] to all the way back into
[34:34] genesis of course but let me uh also
[34:37] talk just for a few minutes
[34:38] on the weight talks about let us lay
[34:41] aside
[34:42] every weight and the sin that does so
[34:45] easily
[34:45] beside us amen and what really began to
[34:50] come to me when i began to think about
[34:51] this subject was
[34:53] the weight of sin amen the weight
[34:57] of sin and i wanted to focus on that for
[34:59] just a little bit because somebody knows
[35:00] that sin is a is a great
[35:02] real big heavy weight
[35:06] amen and of course we know what weight
[35:08] does weight puts you
[35:09] under stress amen it puts up puts you
[35:13] under a burden it stresses you out amen
[35:16] so that's what weight does it stresses
[35:17] you out it gets you
[35:19] put you under pressure right
[35:22] that's what weight is naturally speaking
[35:25] naturally speaking in our flesh
[35:27] amen and i got to thinking about this
[35:29] how that uh
[35:30] you know one of the biggest battles i
[35:32] guess the person will face
[35:34] amen one of the biggest battles in the
[35:36] natural that you and i are going to
[35:39] face is the battle of the bulge
[35:44] isn't that right that's right getting
[35:47] fat
[35:48] it's a real battle amen i've been
[35:50] battling it for years now
[35:52] guess what i'm still fat you know so
[35:55] it's quite a battle
[35:56] it's it's weight just wants to come on
[35:59] it's so
[36:00] easy it's easy to take weight off but
[36:02] i'll tell you what if you aren't
[36:04] watchful
[36:04] very careful amend them to mocus it's
[36:07] just too easy to order
[36:09] and the weight just seems to come back
[36:11] how many knows it's uh how many
[36:13] have a problem with losing weight and
[36:15] then it comes back
[36:16] you ain't got to raise your hand i'm
[36:17] just but yeah you can say amen too if
[36:19] you want to
[36:20] but that's the truth isn't it and so we
[36:23] think about that and that wait how many
[36:24] knows it
[36:25] it is it's me i don't know about you but
[36:27] when i get it get to a certain point
[36:30] amen brother ryan laughing too because
[36:33] we know it's hard to tie that shoe it's
[36:35] hard to put that shoe on
[36:38] isn't it yeah it's just it's just and
[36:41] i'll tell you what
[36:42] you know uh you know when i i'll tell
[36:45] you what you know and
[36:46] and and as you get older you get too
[36:48] much weight and you're in your mind so
[36:49] so
[36:50] i'll tell you what i know and i know
[36:51] when i'm too heavy brother jeff when i'm
[36:53] too heavy
[36:54] i'll go down my stairs like this
[37:01] you know but i get especially after
[37:05] playing volleyball or something like
[37:06] that i really walk like that you know
[37:08] but anyway you think about it in the
[37:10] natural
[37:11] weight is not good for you how many
[37:13] knows the doctor says weight is not good
[37:15] for you
[37:16] amen it is so many things that goes
[37:19] against you
[37:20] as you gain weight amen i told my wife i
[37:24] said you know people that are obese
[37:27] you know i've come to the conclusion
[37:29] that they probably just gave up
[37:33] isn't that about the truth because it's
[37:35] a real battle it's a
[37:36] it's a hard fight and eventually you
[37:38] just said i just can't do it
[37:40] you know and if you ever come to that
[37:41] place it's just going to get a lot worse
[37:44] amen you must keep up the fight you must
[37:46] keep pressing
[37:47] amen to not over get overweight it's a
[37:51] constant battle
[37:52] and it's the same way spiritually
[37:56] and that right the bible says let's lay
[37:58] aside every weight
[38:00] amen because every little sin every
[38:02] little something
[38:03] that causes you to weigh you down
[38:07] amen that's what weight is spiritual
[38:10] weight is something that weighs you down
[38:11] it makes you heavy
[38:14] it makes you harder to walk it makes you
[38:16] immobile spiritually
[38:18] amen you can't go forward anymore hardly
[38:21] anymore and you can't do the things you
[38:22] used to do
[38:24] amen and it piles on how many knows it's
[38:27] just like
[38:28] calories the more you do the worse it
[38:30] gets the heavier you get
[38:32] now we know the prophet of god said that
[38:34] people god put a thirst in people
[38:36] and people try to quench that thirst
[38:37] isn't that right and they try to find a
[38:39] little joy they try to
[38:41] find a way to release get out from
[38:44] under the pressure of the weight and
[38:46] they'll drink
[38:47] they'll go out and get drunk and they're
[38:50] right
[38:51] they forget about all their troubles
[38:53] until the next morning is twice as bad
[38:56] what is it it's a multiplication of
[38:58] weight
[38:59] the sin just gets worse and worse and
[39:02] worse
[39:02] the weight gets worse and worse and
[39:04] worse
[39:05] until the brain says you know that
[39:07] there's so many
[39:08] that'll blow their brains out because
[39:10] they just can't
[39:12] stand it anymore that's where it goes to
[39:16] amen and we know that the first stress
[39:18] the first
[39:19] weight the first sin that eve brought
[39:22] amen was
[39:23] all the way in the garden of eden and
[39:24] amen adam and eve you know they were in
[39:26] a place where they were truly free
[39:30] isn't that right they were truly free
[39:35] and then they walked with the lion they
[39:37] put their arms around the lion and
[39:39] oh my what a beautiful place it was but
[39:42] after the weight of sin
[39:44] came in and that right after sin came in
[39:47] it brought such a weight
[39:49] until they brought in fear sin is a
[39:52] amen excuse me wait the weight of sin
[39:56] brings fear one of the first thing that
[39:58] sin does it brings scare
[40:00] people get scared people begin to worry
[40:04] and then they begin to amen get boggled
[40:07] up
[40:08] and get scared now once adam walked with
[40:10] the lion and now
[40:12] amen we find him hiding behind the
[40:14] bushes
[40:17] huh he got a little weight on him and he
[40:20] had
[40:20] sinned and now he goes from being free
[40:24] to having weighed on him amen and being
[40:27] scared of the lord and his voice
[40:30] and not only that but it brought
[40:32] inferior he meant he felt like he was
[40:34] inferior he wasn't worthy of being in
[40:36] the lord's presence
[40:38] it brought condemnation it brought all
[40:41] kinds of things
[40:43] that's what sin does it brings all kinds
[40:46] of weight on people
[40:50] amen and just because that we are free
[40:55] at one time how much and how often it
[40:57] happens folks
[40:58] amen if you are free amen the devil will
[41:02] do
[41:02] anything in his power to put weight on
[41:04] you
[41:06] to weigh you down amen
[41:10] now i got to thinking about this
[41:14] and life is weight
[41:17] how many knows life itself is weight
[41:22] first of all we were born in sin
[41:25] shaped in iniquity come into this world
[41:28] speaking lies
[41:30] amen we were born with a weight on us
[41:34] life is weight doesn't matter what
[41:36] portion you think about it it's all
[41:38] weight it's all stress
[41:39] it's a burden it's responsibility
[41:44] amen and the older we get the more
[41:47] responsibility we have isn't that right
[41:50] i mean even as a child you think about
[41:52] it even as a child they were they're
[41:54] free they're happy
[41:56] but let them do something wrong and when
[41:58] obama comes with the stick
[42:00] when they're fixing to get paddled them
[42:02] kids get under stress
[42:05] oh no this is terrible their whole world
[42:09] turns upside down isn't that right it's
[42:13] not a beautiful place anymore
[42:15] they're stressed because they did wrong
[42:17] and they're going to get punished for it
[42:19] amen because what that's what sin does
[42:21] that's what wronged us
[42:22] and they were born to that isn't that
[42:24] right and so
[42:25] just from one thing to another the
[42:27] responsibilities of life
[42:29] i mean those that's a weight it meant
[42:32] having to get up every morning we have a
[42:34] responsibility every morning we got to
[42:36] get up we got to go to work
[42:38] some people think they can just be a
[42:39] couch potato stay home and maybe let the
[42:41] government take care of them i don't
[42:43] know but it don't work
[42:44] that way for me doesn't you
[42:47] no it's hard and then people don't like
[42:50] an alarm clock you know i
[42:52] hated that thing too but guess what it's
[42:54] going to go beep
[42:55] beep beep beep beep i gotta go another
[42:59] day i gotta go to work
[43:00] huh you don't think about it but it's a
[43:03] responsibility it's a weight it's a
[43:05] pressure
[43:06] the whole world is under a pressure now
[43:08] what the prophet of god said even
[43:10] preached on how did it disperse the
[43:11] people's under it
[43:12] amen and they don't know how to get out
[43:14] from under it
[43:16] it weighs them down and it also enslaves
[43:19] them
[43:20] i mean this way enslaves people
[43:27] and causes them not to be free
[43:30] anymore now there's nothing like being
[43:33] free
[43:34] and truly we won't be completely free
[43:39] and that right how does that song go
[43:42] amen about these bars of bones and so
[43:45] forth
[43:46] amen when my spirit will be set free
[43:49] isn't that right amen when this life is
[43:52] over
[43:52] all the weight of it all the burden of
[43:54] it amen you'll always be under
[43:56] responsibility you'll always be under
[43:59] uh stress there'll always be pressure as
[44:01] long as you're in this world
[44:03] but we'll truly be free when we leave
[44:05] this world amen
[44:06] that's where that true freedom is amen
[44:09] as far as the natural but now we're
[44:10] talking about a spiritual stem
[44:12] in our hearts and in our souls and in
[44:15] our minds
[44:16] hello we can be free now
[44:20] free freedom or bondage you're either
[44:23] living in one or the other tonight
[44:25] you're either free or you're bound amen
[44:28] and jesus was trying to tell them that
[44:30] hey
[44:31] you know if you're my disciples if you
[44:33] believe my word
[44:34] amen you will know the truth and the
[44:37] truth
[44:38] is going to set you free
[44:41] now we know that in the old testament
[44:43] whenever they sounded that trumpet and
[44:44] so forth and
[44:45] went out saying everybody can go free
[44:47] isn't that right they knew that that
[44:49] sound
[44:50] of that trumpet it was said you can be
[44:52] free and that's what jesus came to say
[44:54] is that you can be
[44:58] free amen
[45:01] it was the rising of the sun same with
[45:02] the uh the slaves and so forth we know
[45:05] that
[45:05] abraham lincoln and so forth died they
[45:07] mean afraid of slaves
[45:09] free fled for when you get old it all
[45:12] goes backwards
[45:13] free to slaves amen to freedom slaves
[45:17] and he says when that sun rises every
[45:18] freak
[45:19] every slave can go free it's a freedom
[45:21] amen it's a type of jesus christ
[45:23] i mean when he rose he make a
[45:25] declaration all right you can go free
[45:27] now you always in bondage to the devil
[45:30] amen even jesus says you know if you're
[45:32] a servant of sin
[45:34] you are a slave to him amen anybody that
[45:37] commits sin is a servant of the sin
[45:39] or you are a slave to it and he came to
[45:42] set
[45:42] us free from that amen
[45:47] and i'm glad for that he came to set us
[45:49] free and he made a proclamation
[45:51] that if he sets you free you are going
[45:54] to be
[45:54] free indeed
[45:58] let me tell you i could mention
[45:59] different ones in the church here you
[46:00] know
[46:01] like brother david was talking about how
[46:03] that you know how that
[46:05] he he got an anchor way back in his life
[46:07] there's an anchor that happened
[46:10] amen we can look at each other's lives
[46:13] and we can tell
[46:14] whether we got that anchor or whether we
[46:16] don't have that anchor
[46:18] that right because that anchor holds how
[46:21] many believes that anchor holds you
[46:23] if that egg isn't there oh it is never
[46:26] going to work
[46:28] amen we need that anchor and it doesn't
[46:31] matter what comes or what goes or how
[46:32] much of a burden what it is
[46:35] we've learned how to let off the
[46:37] pressure amen
[46:38] praise the lord so you think about how
[46:40] that uh
[46:43] you know we were not free our minds were
[46:46] under condemnation
[46:48] amen when you're condemned and uh you're
[46:51] guilty of something how many knows
[46:53] there's
[46:53] no freedom there
[46:57] i'll tell you what just since i've i've
[46:59] listened back to 1959 los angeles
[47:02] and listened to brother branham's life
[47:04] story and how did he talk about how that
[47:06] you know how he lost his wife and the
[47:08] promise that he made that he would meet
[47:10] her on the
[47:10] in heaven and so forth and how that she
[47:13] had come back and
[47:14] and she didn't want to leave she had an
[47:15] eight-month-old baby and about a
[47:17] two-year-old boy i guess billy paul was
[47:19] somewhere in there
[47:20] how did she want to leave him but she
[47:21] says you know they're calling me home
[47:23] i'm going home and it's such a beautiful
[47:25] place
[47:26] of perfect peace he says ever since time
[47:30] he says
[47:31] one thing that he made a statement in
[47:33] that message was you know
[47:34] set your sight set your affections on
[47:37] things above
[47:38] not on the things of this world amen
[47:42] amen so we realize brothers and sisters
[47:45] that
[47:46] even as in this life there's
[47:48] responsibility you have to
[47:50] uh you have to make many choices in life
[47:52] it's a big responsibility it's a weight
[47:55] there's just there's just weight that we
[47:57] have to deal with pressure
[47:58] that everybody has to deal with
[48:00] teenagers have to deal with it
[48:02] and people are absolutely cracking under
[48:04] that pressure
[48:05] under the weight of sin people are going
[48:08] crazy
[48:09] the whole world is going crazy
[48:12] amen but you know how many knows that we
[48:15] were not made
[48:17] to be in bondage amen
[48:21] i'm glad tonight for it over in matthew
[48:25] over in matthew 11 and verse 28 jesus
[48:28] makes a statement now notice this
[48:29] how many knows that jesus had the weight
[48:32] of the whole world on his shoulders
[48:35] in other words if he doesn't go through
[48:36] with this it will cost
[48:38] every soul every soul was on his
[48:42] shoulder
[48:42] the weight of the whole world was on the
[48:46] shoulders of jesus christ
[48:48] you talk about a heavy weight but yet he
[48:50] could say to you and to me
[48:52] he says come unto me all ye that
[48:56] labor and are heavy laden
[49:00] now the pharisees says we ain't never
[49:02] been fried in bondage to nobody
[49:04] they were in bondage and didn't know it
[49:09] isn't that right because everybody that
[49:11] is born of sin
[49:13] shaped iniquity everybody was under
[49:15] bondage
[49:17] everybody was heavy laden
[49:22] amen how many know that if you're not in
[49:24] christ
[49:26] you have a real good reason to have a
[49:28] frown
[49:30] amen your smile is turned upside down
[49:35] isn't that right that's what weight will
[49:38] do
[49:39] i mean that was too much responsibility
[49:40] even we as human beings we were only man
[49:43] to take so much pressure so much weight
[49:47] amen but think about it he says he who
[49:50] had
[49:51] the whole weight of the whole world on
[49:53] him says come
[49:54] unto me all ye that labor and are
[49:57] heavy laden and i will give you
[50:01] rest
[50:05] praise be to god there isn't the church
[50:07] in the world that can bring you to this
[50:09] there ain't a prophet no priest nobody
[50:12] that can bring you to this
[50:13] only can you find this in christ
[50:17] only in the baptism of the holy ghost
[50:20] will you find this place
[50:23] of rest and this place
[50:26] that you can lay down your heavy
[50:29] weight amen
[50:34] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[50:37] for our meek
[50:38] and lowly in heart and ye shall find
[50:41] rests
[50:42] unto your souls now how many knows a
[50:46] person that's fat
[50:47] they're going to get tired twice as
[50:49] quick as a person that isn't
[50:52] huh they're going to get weary twice as
[50:55] quick
[50:56] amen and they're going to have to sit
[50:59] down a whole lot more they're going to
[51:01] have to rest a lot
[51:02] anybody that has a lot of labor he says
[51:04] if you're
[51:06] laboring and heavy laden he said come to
[51:09] me
[51:09] and i will give you rest
[51:17] i don't know 20
[51:21] 30 40 50 60 about 40 years
[51:24] that i've been in in the lord by god's
[51:27] grace
[51:28] and i'll tell you i am never i always
[51:31] marvel
[51:33] i am just amazed at how a person that's
[51:37] in christ
[51:38] how they can rest you don't have to
[51:41] worry
[51:44] how that you can have peace in the midst
[51:46] of the storm
[51:48] and when this world is just falling
[51:49] apart like it is
[51:51] you can have rest that's what jesus said
[51:55] he come and give you rest
[51:56] give you peace he said i give you peace
[51:59] not as the world gives give
[52:00] unto you amen but jesus is peace that
[52:03] passes
[52:04] understanding amen
[52:08] but now notice here also verse 30 he
[52:11] says
[52:12] for my yoke huh
[52:15] how many knows a yoke is a burden
[52:17] something they put on their back
[52:19] a yoke that you got to carry a burden
[52:22] that you got to carry
[52:24] my yoke is easy and my burden
[52:28] is light amen
[52:32] that's right and my burden is light so
[52:36] when you come to christ
[52:38] his yoke is easy and his burden is light
[52:41] you can feel like there is a ton of
[52:44] weight on you
[52:45] or you can feel light as a feather
[52:48] the holy ghost makes you feel like it
[52:50] could just almost
[52:52] float away amen
[52:55] why because it's not necessarily because
[52:57] this body
[52:59] but it's because of what's going on in
[53:00] your spirit
[53:02] hello all the weight's gone amen
[53:06] how many knows that weight can only be
[53:07] dropped you can only drop this weight it
[53:09] ain't by no
[53:10] diet phil huh the only way you'll drop
[53:14] that weight is to bring it to jesus
[53:17] huh it's not by a workout but it's by
[53:20] getting on your knees that's where you
[53:23] get rid of the weight
[53:25] praise be to god i'm so thankful for
[53:27] that
[53:28] amen i want to talk more about fear
[53:32] ma'am i may not but you know
[53:34] i pray that we would be so so free
[53:37] that we could be free from fear even if
[53:40] we come down to the door of
[53:42] death that you don't even have to fear
[53:44] death
[53:47] wouldn't that truly be wouldn't that
[53:49] truly be a place of freedom
[53:51] to get to the place of death that you
[53:52] would not fear it
[53:54] wouldn't be scared of it at all that's
[53:56] where god wants us he wants us at that
[53:58] place
[53:59] to where not only in death but anything
[54:02] anything in life you don't have to be
[54:05] afraid of it
[54:07] i mean those when you come back to
[54:09] christ the scare is gone
[54:12] well they're going to shoot you so what
[54:13] they're going to take me right into the
[54:15] presence of god
[54:16] this may happen and that and it's all
[54:17] okay when you're in christ
[54:20] amen all right let me uh
[54:24] there's a couple quotes i want to read
[54:26] to you
[54:27] and one illustration that i want to i
[54:29] want i want to i want to use this
[54:31] evening

[54:45] had just been captured and it was one of
[54:48] the most pitiful sights that i'd ever
[54:50] had the privilege of seeing this great
[54:52] heavenly bird had been captured and
[54:54] netted by someone
[54:56] and thrown into a cage nahami knows
[54:58] that's exactly what the devil did
[54:59] the serpent did the devil did through
[55:01] the serpent and then he absolutely
[55:04] netted the whole human race and threw
[55:07] him into
[55:07] a cage
[55:11] and that poor fella was so out of place
[55:13] that he would jump
[55:14] with all that was within him against the
[55:17] big bars flopping his wing only to find
[55:19] himself to fall back
[55:20] on his back amen how many knows outside
[55:24] of the baptism of the holy ghost
[55:26] giving you victory over sin you may try
[55:28] to overcome you may try and try and try
[55:31] but you'll find yourself right on your
[55:33] back
[55:35] amen defeated
[55:38] man tried and tried and tried but he
[55:40] couldn't david couldn't solomon couldn't
[55:43] solomon the wisest man of all and all
[55:45] the boy he was so wise
[55:47] but didn't in the end his wives mislead
[55:49] him and he worshipped the mother god
[55:51] he tried but outside why do you think we
[55:54] needed the baptism in the holy ghost
[55:56] amen because in themselves they couldn't
[55:58] david couldn't none of them could
[56:01] tried to do right tried to show forth
[56:03] even them great man david and so forth
[56:05] just couldn't do it neither can you or i
[56:08] outside of the holy ghost
[56:11] and that poor eagle had beat himself to
[56:13] those bars until all the feathers were
[56:15] speed from his wings
[56:16] and his head and his face was all bloody
[56:18] and bruised
[56:20] amen and as i watched him again proudly
[56:23] walked back and with all that he heard
[56:25] he poured himself against those bars
[56:27] only to find himself
[56:29] knocked backwards again and as he laid
[56:31] there on that floor
[56:33] and his weary eyes soared
[56:36] the skies i thought what
[56:39] a pitiful sight what
[56:43] a pitiful sight there he was laying on
[56:45] his back all
[56:46] beating bruised and he looked up there
[56:48] where he used to soar
[56:51] up above the clouds now he's looking up
[56:54] at the clouds he used to look down
[56:56] at the clouds and here he is in the cage
[57:00] what a pitiful sight almost enough to
[57:03] make anybody cry
[57:04] but iran says if i'd had a million
[57:06] dollars i'd have given and i believe it
[57:09] if i believe probably god had a million
[57:10] dollars he'd give him that
[57:12] let this eagle go
[57:15] you know how many knows brother brandon
[57:17] wasn't much on canaries and all of these
[57:18] caged animals and cage birds
[57:22] i don't like it either amen
[57:26] no why they were made to be free
[57:30] amen but this eagle was in
[57:33] such a terrible way he was looking now
[57:34] notice
[57:36] no so he says what a pitiful sight made
[57:40] not to be on the earth here he's a
[57:42] heavenly bird his whole makeup was to
[57:44] live
[57:44] in the blue way above the haunts and
[57:47] cares of this world
[57:50] amen but to see a bird like that
[57:53] borned up there born in the earth the
[57:56] sword of skies and he had caged in such
[57:58] a way
[57:59] that he could never again soar the skies
[58:03] that reminded me of samson how many
[58:06] knows
[58:07] he knew what it was like to be
[58:08] victorious to be undefeatable
[58:11] am i right nobody could stop him he
[58:14] would
[58:14] he would go and light their fields on
[58:17] fire he'd pick a fight
[58:19] samson pick fights he could be proud he
[58:23] had
[58:24] he could not be defeated until he gave
[58:27] his secret away
[58:29] and there he was isn't that right his
[58:32] eyes plucked out
[58:33] going around in circles going around
[58:36] and a slave to the enemy
[58:40] what a horrible sight i have to push
[58:42] around that grinding meal and just go
[58:44] round
[58:44] and round he was a slave to the enemy
[58:48] that's the way you and i were we were
[58:50] slave to sin
[58:51] we were slave to our lusts we were slave
[58:53] to
[58:54] all of these other things we were slave
[58:56] to it
[58:59] how many knows we're going to you're
[59:00] going to be a slave one way or the other
[59:02] we're going to be a slave
[59:04] it's either going to be the devil but
[59:05] it's going to be god remember jesus said
[59:07] no man can co
[59:08] can serve two masters let me tell you
[59:12] how many knows if there would have been
[59:13] more than two he'd
[59:14] said four there's only two
[59:17] either serve one or you serve the other
[59:20] you're either a servant of one
[59:21] or you're the servant of the other
[59:23] you're a slave to one or a slave to the
[59:25] other
[59:26] you're either bound hello you're either
[59:29] in chains you're either
[59:31] a slave to the devil tonight and you're
[59:33] not free
[59:35] or you're free and you're serving christ
[59:39] amen one or the other praise the lord
[59:42] i am so glad amen
[59:46] so and listen
[59:49] all right but to see a bird like that
[59:52] made up there noticed yet caged in such
[59:55] a way he could never sword the skies
[59:56] again
[59:57] and as he laid there looking at that
[59:58] place where he had been and had been
[1:00:00] made to soar
[1:00:02] but by the cunningness of man
[1:00:06] he had been caged for life
[1:00:11] that's sad isn't it caged for life
[1:00:16] i don't know about you but that's a
[1:00:18] hopeless situation
[1:00:20] if he was to be like in prison for life
[1:00:23] no chance of parole
[1:00:26] huh no chance of parole
[1:00:30] what if you was about a quarter of the
[1:00:32] way
[1:00:33] through your sentence and they found out
[1:00:37] that hey it wasn't really you
[1:00:40] you know you're going to be set free

[1:01:09] you could call for god
[1:01:11] and he ain't there you you know you
[1:01:14] think about all the chances that you
[1:01:15] could have had and that you had
[1:01:17] but you don't have any chances over
[1:01:18] there it is for life
[1:01:21] amen it's a horrible place just to know
[1:01:24] that
[1:01:25] but by the cunningness of man he had
[1:01:26] been caged for life what a pitiful sight
[1:01:29] but brethren he says that's not a bad
[1:01:31] sight at all
[1:01:32] to walk out here in the streets of
[1:01:34] chicago
[1:01:36] and we don't have to go to chicago we
[1:01:37] can go to walmart over there at
[1:01:39] russellville
[1:01:40] or you can go around and you can see how
[1:01:42] that people are absolutely
[1:01:45] encages enslaved
[1:01:48] to the devil weighed down
[1:01:52] with sin amen
[1:01:56] wait heavy laden to find men who were
[1:01:59] born and shaped in the image of god to
[1:02:01] be sons and daughters of god
[1:02:02] to find them caged
[1:02:06] by sin and habits
[1:02:09] and the cares of this world it's far
[1:02:12] more
[1:02:12] pitiful shape than that eagle was
[1:02:15] how many knows man was not made to be
[1:02:18] bound he was made to be free
[1:02:22] amen how many knows that's truly what
[1:02:24] all of man was made for
[1:02:26] and the reason they do all the crazy
[1:02:28] stuff that they do
[1:02:30] is they're trying to get out
[1:02:34] that's exactly what the prophet god said
[1:02:36] listen he said they drink they cry they
[1:02:38] do all these things listen
[1:02:39] he wasn't made to be a slave he was made
[1:02:41] to be a son of god he was made in the
[1:02:43] image of god
[1:02:44] he was placed in him an immortal soul
[1:02:46] and a thirst to thirst
[1:02:48] after god and then he tries to satisfy
[1:02:50] that blessed holy thirst with whiskey
[1:02:53] alcohol tobacco big times luxury
[1:02:57] amen pleasure
[1:03:00] any way that he can people that get
[1:03:02] weighed down they'll drink they'll do
[1:03:04] all of that to try to satisfy
[1:03:06] that thirst that's in their heart
[1:03:09] because you're not complete you are
[1:03:11] absolutely not
[1:03:14] complete without god
[1:03:17] without the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:03:19] you're still
[1:03:21] empty amen
[1:03:25] and they try all these things to satisfy
[1:03:28] and it doesn't work
[1:03:29] does it no it doesn't men and women are
[1:03:32] only caged and kept away from the real
[1:03:35] god given privilege that they have
[1:03:37] they're bound by sin
[1:03:40] not that god wants them that way but
[1:03:42] they willfully do that
[1:03:44] amen they thirst for satisfaction
[1:03:49] notice brother bam says here this is
[1:03:50] what i thought about now here we hear
[1:03:52] so much today we are free
[1:03:55] we live in a beautiful america and we
[1:03:57] are free
[1:03:59] amen isn't that what we hear so much
[1:04:02] and we have been free it's been you know
[1:04:05] how many say that
[1:04:06] freedom isn't free you have to fight for
[1:04:08] it and guess what you have to keep
[1:04:10] shedding your blood
[1:04:11] you have to keep fighting to stay free
[1:04:14] well we can clearly see that the fight's
[1:04:17] over
[1:04:17] people are not willing to fight for
[1:04:18] freedom anymore that's why it's going to
[1:04:20] keep going the way that it is
[1:04:23] amen and that's why our freedoms will be
[1:04:27] taken from us
[1:04:29] huh because people oh no no
[1:04:32] no back whenever kennedy come into
[1:04:35] office and he was a catholic
[1:04:38] what happened with him just a little
[1:04:40] before that brother bam says now they
[1:04:42] didn't put up with that just a little
[1:04:43] bit before that
[1:04:44] but now it's gotten to where people are
[1:04:46] sleeping
[1:04:48] yeah and they let it in huh they let it
[1:04:51] in it
[1:04:52] came in and so forth and now we don't
[1:04:54] think nothing of it
[1:04:58] we could get really political here but
[1:04:59] we'll hold off
[1:05:01] anyway listen you are in a million
[1:05:03] listen so now i know this we are free
[1:05:05] oh we live in a beautiful we're free he
[1:05:07] says oh the air is full of it
[1:05:09] thousand seven but you are a million
[1:05:12] miles
[1:05:13] from being free
[1:05:16] you're not free don't you be deceived by
[1:05:19] that
[1:05:19] america is one of the greatest deceived
[1:05:22] nations
[1:05:23] and in more bondage than any place i
[1:05:25] know of
[1:05:26] they're worst in bondage than communism
[1:05:28] could put them in
[1:05:31] that's what he said we're worse as far
[1:05:34] as not being free
[1:05:35] here in america then you would be if you
[1:05:38] was under
[1:05:39] well putin i was going to say garbage
[1:05:41] off but that was a few years ago
[1:05:44] we're up to putin now

[1:06:18] few minutes
[1:06:19] let's look at where our liberty truly
[1:06:22] lays and what it is that
[1:06:24] we're bound by
[1:06:27] they're there in worse bondage than
[1:06:29] communism could put them in
[1:06:31] cause communism can only hurt the body
[1:06:34] they can put the body into bondage but
[1:06:35] when a devil comes
[1:06:36] in he puts the soul in bondage
[1:06:42] and man is a slave america is a bunch

[1:13:20] and they're right and then it's a sign
[1:13:22] that they have joy they're happy they're
[1:13:24] free
[1:13:25] that's the way the believer ought to be
[1:13:27] god wants you free
[1:13:29] he who he christ sets free is absolutely
[1:13:33] free
[1:13:36] i could use a little more of it up here
[1:13:41] a little more freedom
[1:13:44] how about you can you little freedom say
[1:13:47] oh lord sir
[1:13:48] set me free set me on fire let me be
[1:13:52] free
[1:13:53] from sin from doubt huh
[1:13:56] but you know how the devil tries to
[1:13:57] capture us a lot of time if the devil's
[1:14:00] going to capture you
[1:14:01] if he go get you you're not going to get
[1:14:04] you
[1:14:05] through your mind
[1:14:08] he'll bring thoughts around oh you're
[1:14:11] not really of god huh
[1:14:14] you'll bring things to all kinds of
[1:14:16] thoughts around uh you can't never
[1:14:18] overcome
[1:14:20] huh he'll bring thoughts on my stat
[1:14:23] sister i tell you i just know that
[1:14:24] sister don't like me she didn't even
[1:14:26] look at me
[1:14:28] and you'll go all week fret you'll be
[1:14:31] bothered i'm sick that thinking will
[1:14:33] bother you and bother you
[1:14:37] when that sister didn't have nothing
[1:14:38] against you at all
[1:14:40] that's what the devil does amen he likes
[1:14:43] to bind us with
[1:14:44] a bird he likes to make a nest on our
[1:14:46] head but
[1:14:48] says you can't help the thoughts from
[1:14:49] coming but you can help keep that bird
[1:14:52] off of there
[1:14:53] and for making a nest on it and while
[1:14:55] let me say that let me put it that
[1:14:57] correctly
[1:14:57] i believe it says he can't help but the
[1:14:59] birds fly over your head
[1:15:01] right but they ain't gonna land
[1:15:05] and get a bunch of straw amen
[1:15:08] and get you all bungled up because the
[1:15:10] devil wants your mind
[1:15:11] boggled up
[1:15:18] let me just say this 40 years of
[1:15:20] experience preaching
[1:15:22] if a thought torments you it's probably
[1:15:25] not of god
[1:15:28] if a thought causes you not to be able
[1:15:29] to sleep at night
[1:15:31] remember it's the devil because i have
[1:15:34] thought i've had a lot of them i've had
[1:15:36] a lot of new thoughts man i tossed and
[1:15:37] turned and
[1:15:39] threaded fretted and carried on but you
[1:15:41] know if i pray
[1:15:43] if i'll pray and i'll get the right
[1:15:46] thought
[1:15:49] every single time if i think what god
[1:15:51] wants me to think
[1:15:53] it'll bring me peace it always
[1:15:56] brings me peace and i say that's it
[1:15:58] thank you lord
[1:16:01] praise be to god you love him tonight
[1:16:06] all right so he says if you're a
[1:16:09] christian you're a slave you're a bond
[1:16:10] slave to the lord jesus
[1:16:13] now notice you have uh you're like two
[1:16:15] people your body and spirit
[1:16:16] and if you cater to the flesh you're
[1:16:20] a slave of the devil amen
[1:16:24] how many of us we're not here to show
[1:16:26] our biceps
[1:16:28] i don't know what triceps are but
[1:16:29] something somewhere along in there
[1:16:31] we're not here to brag about our flesh
[1:16:34] we're here to brag about the holy ghost
[1:16:37] we're a bag about
[1:16:39] god amen we're not worried about the
[1:16:41] flesh the flesh is the devil
[1:16:43] amen of the devil because holy spirit is
[1:16:46] of god
[1:16:47] so notice if you cater to the flesh
[1:16:49] you're of the devil you
[1:16:50] and now but you've got to crucify you'll
[1:16:52] crucify the soul that's in you
[1:16:54] in other words the flesh will go out
[1:16:56] doing things that'll just grieve your
[1:16:57] soul right away from you
[1:17:00] for the bible says the soul that sinneth
[1:17:02] that soul shall die
[1:17:03] and you have to crucify the flesh in
[1:17:05] order to be a bond slave
[1:17:07] amen to christ to be a servant of jesus
[1:17:11] christ so your slave
[1:17:14] anyway you take it
[1:17:17] i believe that you're a slave one way
[1:17:20] or the other amen
[1:17:24] when you're a loved slave to christ
[1:17:26] you're shackled to christ
[1:17:28] by pre-destiny by for the nation by
[1:17:31] election
[1:17:33] how many know that his love is in
[1:17:36] election
[1:17:38] he elected you that's how he proved his
[1:17:40] love
[1:17:41] amen and you're chained by that you put
[1:17:44] and then you're you're chained to jesus
[1:17:46] christ you've got a shackle on your leg
[1:17:49] amen and you love the lord and i'll tell
[1:17:50] you when your flesh wants to go and do
[1:17:52] that
[1:17:52] it just can't go it won't let it go that
[1:17:54] way
[1:17:56] no unless you got a unless you uh how
[1:18:00] does it say it
[1:18:02] uh you've got religion you're religious
[1:18:05] but you know
[1:18:06] the power thereof people deny the power
[1:18:10] thereof amen
[1:18:12] you're shackled like paul said he was a
[1:18:14] prisoner of christ but abandoned when he
[1:18:16] spoke on that
[1:18:17] he says he was a love slave to jesus
[1:18:24] christ
[1:18:26] i know a man in the message
[1:18:31] believe the message seemed to be holy
[1:18:33] ghost filled
[1:18:35] john smith down in florida
[1:18:38] and he just quit he went out on the
[1:18:40] barstool drank
[1:18:42] he just he just went and went to drink
[1:18:45] it
[1:18:46] it wasn't hardly any time at all he was
[1:18:49] dead
[1:18:51] seven weeks donna about a week or two
[1:18:56] seven days or so you know and hey
[1:18:59] well you say well no you brother bran
[1:19:02] says you know if a child is disobedient
[1:19:04] and does that
[1:19:05] god will take you off the earth
[1:19:08] you know i'm not the judge of whether
[1:19:10] you'll be there but it looks to me a
[1:19:11] whole lot like that's what god did
[1:19:13] wouldn't you want to be that kind of a
[1:19:15] slave to god that you would say god
[1:19:17] before you let me go before i before you
[1:19:20] let me go you take me
[1:19:22] i want to be i want to be tied that way
[1:19:24] to god that he'll take me off the earth
[1:19:26] before he'll let me be lost i don't know
[1:19:28] about you but i like this
[1:19:30] i like this servitude to the lord
[1:19:33] i like being a love saved to him
[1:19:38] is it nice to know that cast all your
[1:19:41] cares upon him
[1:19:43] for he cares for you
[1:19:47] cast all your cares upon him for he
[1:19:49] cares for you
[1:19:51] that's all you cares upon him for he
[1:19:53] cares for you what about it why do you
[1:19:55] keep saying that because i'm 100
[1:19:56] convinced that that's what a lot of us
[1:19:58] need to do a whole lot more of
[1:20:01] we still have so many cares in our mind
[1:20:04] well i gotta do this and i gotta make
[1:20:06] sure that's taken care of don't worry
[1:20:07] about all of that
[1:20:08] just cast it all on him and say god i
[1:20:10] care about you
[1:20:12] i ain't gotta fret about this i gotta
[1:20:14] fret about that
[1:20:15] people are so busy
[1:20:18] so enslaved with the cares
[1:20:21] of this world until they can't really be
[1:20:24] free like they ought to be
[1:20:26] i hope everybody out there listening
[1:20:28] listen to this amen don't be so
[1:20:30] enslaved with the cares of life
[1:20:35] having to have money having to pay your
[1:20:37] bills having to do this
[1:20:38] until you become a slave to it
[1:20:42] huh jesus didn't want us to be that way
[1:20:46] no he didn't he says seek ye first the
[1:20:49] kingdom of the god
[1:20:50] of heaven and all these things shall be
[1:20:53] added unto

[1:21:10] to get on the boat that god made him a
[1:21:13] plank
[1:21:14] out of water a water plank

[1:23:06] let's stand
[1:23:16] close your eyes bow your heads
[1:23:21] i want each and every one of you to do a
[1:23:24] little
[1:23:24] analysis of yourself
[1:23:29] what i mean by that is i want you to
[1:23:31] think about
[1:23:32] in your life where perhaps
[1:23:37] you aren't free
[1:23:40] like you should be
[1:23:44] i'm sure it isn't drinking or smoking
[1:23:48] or this that or the other but that's why
[1:23:50] you have to
[1:23:52] look at yourself and say am i really
[1:23:55] free
[1:23:57] like i should be or am i sitting here a
[1:24:01] message believer and
[1:24:03] yet not really free i i've got a weight
[1:24:06] on my shoulder i'm stressed
[1:24:10] i've got burdens
[1:24:14] i'm stressed out i'm under all this
[1:24:16] pressure
[1:24:17] i don't know which way to go i don't
[1:24:18] know what to do
[1:24:20] maybe it's not even that bad but it's
[1:24:22] just one little thing in your life
[1:24:24] somewhere that's got you kind of weighed
[1:24:27] it down
[1:24:30] wonder if you'd be honest search your
[1:24:32] heart think about what it is
[1:24:34] first of all you have to know what it is
[1:24:38] before you can lay it at jesus feet
[1:24:42] see we could have you come to the altar
[1:24:43] i thought about doing that
[1:24:45] if you want to lay down your weight you
[1:24:47] want to lighten up
[1:24:49] you want to feel like a feather but you
[1:24:52] know i know that you don't have to come
[1:24:53] to the altar because i know the altar is
[1:24:55] your heart
[1:24:57] and i know he knows your thoughts right
[1:24:58] now he knows what you're thinking
[1:25:03] he hears you and i wonder if there's
[1:25:07] those that were just in their
[1:25:08] heart and mind say god you know
[1:25:12] what i have need of right now you know
[1:25:15] that i'm not as free as

[1:25:50] honest
[1:25:52] lord jesus i come before you lord both
[1:25:54] with myself my own hand up
[1:25:56] and others that are heavy-lifting and
[1:25:59] have something in their heart that they

[1:26:02] that they want to be free from and i ask
[1:26:05] in the name of jesus christ that you'll
[1:26:06] come in the altar of their heart
