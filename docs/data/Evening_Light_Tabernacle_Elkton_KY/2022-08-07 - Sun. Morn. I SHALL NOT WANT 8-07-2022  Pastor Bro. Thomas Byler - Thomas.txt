brothers and sisters we'll just stand this morning brother brad will open us in prayer this morning and if we go in the psalms we'll go to this psalms 127 just a little real short psalms here the children can be dismissed for sunday school psalms 127 just a few little verses except the lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the lord keep the city the watchmen wakeeth but in vain lo children are a heritage of the lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward happy this one together happy is the man that hath is quiver full of them they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate god bless you may be seated brother brian good morning brothers and sisters according to those scriptures some of you brothers and sisters should get busy if you return with me to uh romans the 11th chapter i wasn't trying to be overly funny there before i get started um uh i sat down i made the church payment yesterday that the normal not exceeding much of the normal amount as of yesterday when i made that principal payment and the interest payment what's left in the uh of principal is 68 000 and 6847 and change but something happened a lot this week i don't know i don't know if it happened to some of you all the church was on a it makes no sense saying that way we we had a fixed rate for so long and then it went to an adjustable rate so for the last couple of years it actually dropped a couple of years ago went up last year like a quarter point but this year this week it went up a whole percentage so it was four and a half last month come september the september payment is going to be five and a half percent and um i said i figured this out that if just doing the normal payment we would have uh 53 payments left basically on the loan four years and five months now of course i know a lot of you know that that's not fixed as i pay more principal the the years the amount of months at the end of the loan are going to change but that's just a rough estimate you know where we stand as a church paying off the uh paying off the loan that's a long way from where we started like i told you we took initially took out 175 000 then we we when we did the original loan we had a plus up available up to 200 000 and we took a 200 000 brothers and sisters that doesn't even touch the bucket how much it was actually put in the church over those couple of years we when we put it together whether it's your own personal labor or your own personal finances as you all know 200 000 dollars couldn't have built a church like this so the lord has truly blessed us but going back to the to this eleventh chapter i was sitting there thinking this morning and i and i was reading some stuff and i was reading about this man reading other people's writings and stuff and i was reading about this man this has been probably over a hundred years ago and he was a you know he was going to a samurai he was wanting to be a theologian and he was after all those years you know reading studying and believing he still he was he was very stressful very stressful about his circumstances about the word of god and the truths that were presented in it and then one day he just realized that he just simply had to accept what god wanted to do for him it wasn't all not that the education was bad or good it wasn't none of that really mattered it was just simply believing christ in believing what god purpose is for you as an individual just simply accepting it and reaching out in faith but he realizes all that was required of them now paul also said that you have to work out your salvation with fear and trembling it doesn't take that away but that fear and trembling and that conviction that comes upon your heart and life brings you to a point where you realize just like in john bunyan wrote in all his books that you simply have to reach out in faith and accept what god has done for you and that's a daily walk that we all have to take every day as whether you're young or you're old whatever situation you're in your enemy's goal is to put you in such a stressful life that you're looking at the wrong things and trying to keep you from looking at the right things and and when i was reading this morning in that thing that man finally realized that no matter what the world or whatever was going on uh he just simply had to reach out in faith and walk where god was leading him and once you have that you know brother branham talk about it a lot once you have that that tie post that stake in the ground that you know that god has done something for you whatever that is whether it's a revelation of the word of god and how god speaks to you everyone is different once you have that experience you can't be tricky anymore you know that god is real and then no matter what happens you can know that you can trust him to bring you to that final destination that we all desire to bring in and i was uh not trying to be funny here i was just thinking you know especially you younger men and women you know you hadn't had those experiences in the life of ups and downs as many ups and downs as you get older and that's not a good thing sometimes when you get older it makes you hard makes you crusty makes you you know trusting you yourself more than you trust in god but people and i think they know so much you know what's funny about it is you know i i do a business that everything i do is based on national law if you it's gonna do the same thing every time time and time again if you do it the right way and i was just thinking those there's those people out there that put science above religion or put their own understanding above anything else but you'll find out that those same people that are trusting in the natural laws of god and don't believe in a god what's so funny about them is that they'll fight you the hardest if there is no god or if there is no truth then why do they fight you so much i mean it's just a revelation got to realize it's that they fight you so much about something that they don't believe it just to me i find it funny sometimes but going going hearing this uh i wrote this down i hope i i'll just start at this 12th chapter not wanting to take a lot of time you know we all have to work out our salvation with fear and trembling and the understanding that i'm that's not that's not what i'm reading in my notes but i just feel it in my heart that every man and woman here or in the world has to come to that place where they have to realize that god has a true purpose for you and for your life and you just gotta surrender i mean you know i remember being a younger man that's one thing i would never do i would never surrender to god's will and then you find out as you get older but more that you choose not to surrender to god's will the harder your life will get once you realize that then you'll just simply surrender i know it you can talk about it you can preach about it you can do all things about it but every individual simply has to do that themselves but let me read a little bit out of this 12th chapter but i can tell you one thing i and i'm on another candidate again but i've i the one thing i learned myself i can only speak for myself a lot of times when i was a younger man i always wondered who could i trust who could put i put my confidence in you know in a natural sense i i you know i wasn't raised in a christian home but who could i trust who could i have confidence in and all you men and women have known that as you get older you see people that you thought you could have confidence in and you see them fail make mistakes that you thought that they never mistake that shouldn't shake you and i was thinking i realized that when god was speaking me the only thing i could have confidence in that i could have trust in is himself i could only trust jesus christ and anything that was affecting me that's the only thing as a man as for speaking for myself that i could trust god's word and what he's taught me and what i've been led to believe that's the only thing i can trust anything outside of that i found that if i was trusting too much in the things of the world it was going to fall apart one day but i'll just read from this um uh these scriptures here in the 12th chapter of romans you know paul was talking to the gentiles in the 11th chapter he's talking to the gentiles saying how god loved him so much that he took the real branch god's branch and took it out of the tree and set it aside so he could bring us into that tree and feed us from the word of god and freedom from his spirit and he's talking to the gentiles and telling them not to become not to think of themselves greater than what they really are because the same god that took that pure branch and took it out and put the wild branch in could take us out and i'm and i'm just thinking we're so many years past that point right now and everyone in the world that we live in takes it for granted now like it's always going to be there and we know by the message of the hour and the word of god it's not always going to be there god is only coming for those that he knows and those that are our zone but i'll just read this and sit down i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercy of god that you present your body is a living sacrifice holy and acceptable on the god which is your reasonable service so paul's talking here he's not asking us to do anything more than what god expects us to do you know a lot of times we want to do the great things and god wants you to do the simple things that's it's just just especially man that's just how they are they think that they have to do this great thing but around their close part of their life they're not doing the little things and be not conformed to the world but be transformed by the renewing of your minds that you may prove what is good and acceptable and perfect will of god for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according to us god had dealt to every man the measure of faith and that's that's a true statement you know any time god puts you in a position whether it's in a spiritual position or even out in a job when you think that when you when you start thinking in your heart and in your life that without you nothing is going to work and nothing's going to be able to move without you then you put yourself in a bad place that you know that's a common problem in the world people suffer from self-importance and he goes on to say whereas many members in one body all members not of the same office my point being no matter what you're doing there's always someone that can do it better once you have that revelation you realize you're not as important as you think you are and that makes you more willing to accept counsel accept advice or look for a better way to do something and for as many members are in one body all members are not the same office so we bring many as one body in christ that everyone remembers one of another having the gifts different according to the grace that is given to us well the prophecy let us prophesy according to the portion of faith i'll just finish what paul is saying there you know god gives every man and every woman different gifts and the way a man and a woman should accept that is that if you know that god has given you a gift you shouldn't be upset or envious or jealous over another man's gift or another woman's gift just stay in your lane in life that's what you know that's the hard thing i see in this world god gives us the lane he tells us what he wants to be and what he wants us to do and sometimes we've got to be in everyone else's lane instead of in our own lane and that's where we need to be as christian what god is leading you to do if he's touching your heart to do something just stay in faith and believe what he's got for you to do brother josh [Applause] man let's stand this morning it's good to be here hey man i hope everyone's having a good morning i remember brother david he's sick this morning i

gathered in your name we know that you'll be in our midst lord and we're so grateful for that father we come before you lord asking god that you would just be with us this morning and just bless the meditation of our heart father and that which we feel you've laid upon our heart to speak lord we ask god that you'd speak to your people this morning the words lord jesus and minister them to their other things that we have need of lord and we'll be careful to give you the praise jon and the glory in jesus name amen amen we want to continue on the promises of god is that okay amen let's take another ser and we'll start with first peter ii peter ii peter 1. [Music] ii peter 1 and verse 3 and 4. according as his divine power has given unto us all things amen now notice that given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises how many beliefs that's been done amen how many beliefs we have exceeding great and precious promises amen that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust now turn over if you will to the book of psalms 23 psalms 23. the lord is my shepherd i shall not want amen may god add his blessings to the reading you can be seated my title this morning is i shall not want amen amen i was messing with my cows and different things out there and of course always having trying to have my mind on the lord and and just seeing what the lord would have to speak and that's the scripture that came to my mind amen and so i was just inspired by it and so we want to try to minister on that with the help of the lord amen amen now first i want to speak to you and give you a couple quotes of what the prophet god said about amen a god's untapped resources amen amen untapped resources that we have he says you know he says my grandfather he says wrote an ox card he says and i'm driving a ford v8 all right my son will fly a jet plane that's he says that just we're just moving on that's what religion ought to be the coming of the lord is at hand the church ought to be moving on up into powers amen science can only climb so high and he goes into describing of where how science has come we look at where science has come from right look at how it's progressed in 100 years amen all right he said science can only climb so far and then it has to drop off okay but we've got untapped sources or resources in other places yes that's never been touched of the power unlimited of god that we ought to be moving into he says we're living a million miles under our privileges tonight our privilege of that the creations ought to be enjoying another one he says well that's what the pentecostal church as soon as it was born and uh or any church when it's born into the kingdom of god it becomes sons and daughters of god but we stopped that that when the pentecostal church received the gift of speaking in tongues and interpretation based out there amen how many knows it's not it's important not to stop if i could say anything this morning you could see where you're at now with the lord and ask yourself this question are you daily progressing are you a better christian than you was last week or last month or last year if you can't really say yeah i've really gotten a lot closer to the lord then you need to repent because that's not where god wants us he don't want us to stay in one place he wants us to continuously to progress in him amen my let me see that's right they stopped at that there's no place to stop amen that's the place to begin we've got untapped resources everywhere amen now you want to see what some of those things are and i'm going to show you with the help of the lord what that resource that untapped resource is is that okay amen untapped resource amen all right we've got untapped resources everywhere it says all things are possible to them that believe there's your resource if thou canst believe all things are possible amen i am sure that probably every one of us has asked god for things we didn't get it and so forth perhaps and somehow in our mind that's kind of hard to believe because perhaps you failed you didn't ask you didn't get what you asked for huh and it's so big that you can't say of yourself yeah i believe that truly huh ask anything in my name and i will do it huh that's pretty big isn't it amen if thou can't believe all things are possible praise the lord now go back to the scripture of psalms 23 i like david i like david's life i like the examples that you can pull from david i like his scriptures here because david here i believe is talking about his shepherd what god meant to him amen what god meant to him he said the lord is my shepherd i will not need i will not lack i will not want amen praise the lord think about it if he is your shepherd you're not going to lack you are not going to need anything or should i say have to need anything because he's going to supply for you praise the lord i'm being mad for that promise that when he's your shepherd i shall not won glory david didn't have much when the bear came when the lion came isn't that right all he had is slain [Applause] and god that was the key it didn't matter how little it was it's just this lingering stone don't look much to me all of us would say brother brad i'm on a pretty big caliber gun brother austin i want one of them big guns something that'll just blow him to pieces right but surely don't give me no clean stone but no it did not david had god he didn't need anything more i believe he could have punched him in the face and killed him if he needed to is that right how about samson samson knew what it was not the need not to want not to lack when he had god that's what the world lacks remember there's you know i believe it was a uh belty shazer where that handwriting on the wall that came down he says you've been weighed in the balance and found lacking you've been found wanting you're not what you ought to be you're wrong you're off you're lacking boy boy i'll tell you what i wonder if we looked in our lives how much we're lacking huh but god don't want you to lack amen he wants you to give you everything that you have need of praise the lord i believe it's paul that said in philippians my god but my god shall supply all your need according to his richest in glory amen and i'd imagine there is some serious riches in glory what is that riches that riches is that god can take care of any problem that you got he can supply anything that you have need of that's the richest how many know that's a serious risk great and precious promises through christ jesus paul said how many that's how you receive these riches that's how you have all of your things supplied is because and through jesus christ the greatest name name there's no higher name than jesus christ amen in matthew 7 and 7 it says ask and it shall be given to you huh y'all just hang on man hang in there ask and it shall be given unto you seek and ye shall fly knock and it shall be opened unto you huh praise the lord think about it god is good isn't he ask and it shall be given unto you seek and so forth brother brother begins makes a statement and quote he says we have no need or lack of anything praise the lord why because it has all how many knows that it's all been supplied it has been given to us what you have need of your need has been supplied let's all say that my need has been supplied you see we think that we need a whole bunch of stuff we don't need that's where the problem comes in well i need this not need that no you need what god has for you that's what you truly need amen paul didn't have a whole lot think about it just the same scripture the same chapter he paul says i know how to have much i know how to have little i can do all things through christ with strengthen me and just a few more scriptures is everybody tells you that god is going to supply your need amen paul knew what it was like not to lack paul didn't like he had everything that god wanted him to have everything that he had needed when he come to the door of death he had he had need of victory didn't he amen he says i thank god through christ jesus who gives us the victory this thing of death has been taken away and everything else god had given him the victory praise the lord oh i like that don't you again a quote brother bam says that's the way that we are when we receive the baptism of the holy ghost praise be to god all right here we go are you ready i'm telling you i know we hear these quotes maybe all our life but god help you this morning if you'll just just do whatever you got to do to try to make this real to yourself huh i believe that these things are there and we just have them as a memory but i don't know about you but i want it to be not a memory or a thought or a quote i want it to be a reality how many with me i want this to be a reality i believe in the church age book the man talked about he says we've got the word it's just that it's not real to people i believe that's the problem is that the word of god is not real to people not a reality but when you get the baptism in the holy ghost to you sick people now and to you that are born again of the spirit of god when god planted you in christ which is the inexhaustible fountain of lives amen now we're tapping into it aren't we we're tapping into untapped resources people that don't have god need to tap in you need the baptism of the holy ghost you tap into the inexhaustible fountain of life constantly flowing can i just say what comes to mind thank you brother chris anybody else think about it when you get and you get capped into christ it should never run dry or dull it's a constant flowing stream amen praise god which is the inexhaustible fountain of life and everything that you need was put in you when you receive the holy ghost for your life's journey and he also says for this world and for everything else everything is in you then [Applause] your healing salvation joy happiness it don't matter it's in you now the only thing you have to do is push let me go let me uh let me finish it push and drink drink and push hallelujah everything's there you just have to let it loose go to pushing go to drinking like a tree that's planted you it just needs water how many knows here not so long ago we had almost a drought around here it's so dry it was so dry my grass wouldn't grow huh i was hoping my pasture fields would get enough grass last through october november so i don't have to feed till december and it wasn't growing as this isn't going to happen but hallelujah praise god we got some rain didn't we amen when that rain came the grass just began to come up but now they're in waste deep grass and everything's green and they're beautiful in green again why because of that rain because of that water i hope you're hearing me spiritually you will be green you will have clap in your hands you'll have joy it'll be life if the water of the holy ghost comes on you the the problem with too many message believers is they don't have fresh revelation they don't have that water flowing like they should huh lord help us oh my we're gonna get to the good part here that i lack really good anyway all right just go to pushing and drinking and stirring you going to reach out going to deeper depth higher height amen it's all there [Applause] you don't need it don't need some divine healer to come by to heal you glory think about it ain't nobody got to lay their hands on you it might help you if you need that for faith that's okay but many of you could just get the revelation that healing is mine salvation is mine whatever it is it's mine at home wherever you are if you get a revelation healing is mine it's mine i believe what god said [Music] you can be healed no matter where you are praise be to god aren't you thankful for that have faith like jesus have faith in god i was listening to a tape the other day and brother bam was talking about when you want something from god you don't have to have extraordinary faith so for faith he says just believe what god said accept it and go on and i'm like what he's telling if you don't want to have to have that super faith that you think about no you just have to believe god said it i believe it that settles it and take it and go amen go on and act like it's already done praise be to god hallelujah god he's good isn't he amen see you don't have to come by and heal your divine healing has already been purchased at calvary the only thing you have to do is you're planted in christ drink from the fountain that never runs dry praise the lord we already taught here and won't teach it too much here i mean this morning dwell on it should i say too much this morning and that is that every promise of god and and brother brown other places said that you know it's when jesus said it was finished he was finished he said if he was here he couldn't heal you have to accept what he's already done how many knows if jesus himself here was trying to hear he all he can do is promote you to believe you'd still have to reach that level of faith and accept that because he had many crowds it's just a few people would a lot of times get healed amen we already have jesus here can we say we already have jesus he's already here he's in your heart he's right in here he's just waiting for you to believe him to accept it and live like it's already done i think i preached a whole sermon on he can't do a thing for you until you accept that it's already finished until you accept it's already done he can't do anything for you you have to accept what he did amen have faith jesus christ the son of god is here to take over everything that you have need of he promised to supply your need from your birth to the end of your life praise the lord uh aren't you glad for that to the end of your life well let's see if this is really true saint john 14 jesus said to his disciples don't let your hearts be troubled you believe in god you believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not so i would have told you and i go to prepare a place for you amen and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there you may be also so just think about this morning of jesus jesus told his disciples look i'm going to go away we're going to talk about the hereafter a little bit and i'm telling you i'm going to win i'm going to go prepare a place for you according to the prophet of god he's already building that new jerusalem over there we don't know what all know what all is going on over there he's creating all kinds of new things in a new jerusalem for us to dwell dwell in they're busy over there everything's under construction heaven a place for us so that whenever wherever he is there will be elsa if jesus would be concerned about where we're gonna be after this don't you think he's already taken care of everything over here too sure he's already taken care of it this morning i'm here to tell you that i believe that whatever trial whatever whatever problem whatever it comes in my life or your life he's already got a way of escape he's already made it away for you huh all you have to do is yield to him all you have to say lord i'm trusting you in this amen because nothing comes on you nothing comes on me without god's permission so whatever comes remember it was permitted by god and it's for a purpose amen when you got that you know god's got it under control hallelujah praise the lord now that's right from birth to the end of your life that's the way it is with the christian life we are planted together in christ jesus who is the inexhaustible fountain of life we're planted in christ and then we just drink and drink and drink and push out and everything that we're in need of in this life's journey divine healing powers of god all these other things is in the engine individual here that's received the baptism of the holy ghost for you're planted in christ hallelujah the holy spirit yes sir and everything you have need of in his life's journey even the rapture is in you then [Applause] calm down people even the rapture is in you man the more i think about that to realize it's already there [Music] don't have to wait for it it's in there christ is the rapture and the scripture that comes to my mind to justify a statement like that would be when he was there with marth and mary they wanted lazarus to raise up what'd he say i am the resurrection and the life so if you've got him you've got the resurrection in you always is scripture always backed up amen aren't you glad for that even the rapture is in you that's the truth the rapture is in us now oh my first he said don't resent that don't resent that i'll tell you resentment targets the word of god can lead you in bad places amen because if you resent the truth there's something wrong with you something wrong with your spirit for resenting the truth amen but people did it apparently prophet got picked up on that amen oh my he used the scripture as all he has predestinated he's justified isn't that right and all who has justified he has already already glorified praise the lord he's already done the work it's already done amen praise the lord we're just waiting for the time how many believes that we're just waiting for the time but you've got to be part of the first resurrection you've got to be part of the resurrection that you who were once dead and sins now are alive and quickened unto god let me know that we've had the resurrection in the spiritual realm but we're certainly looking for a resurrection to this thing a body change praise be to god how many believes that oh my hallelujah we think about samson amen god supplied his need didn't he he did not lack i mean he lacked the army he lost he lacked tens of thousands of soldiers huh one man going up against perhaps tens of thousands it said he killed a thousand the rest of them ran probably right i didn't know telling how many there actually was one man taking on a whole army amen he did not lie he could testify this morning i know what it's like not the lack amen until i lost the holy ghost or until i got away from god then you're going to lack oh yeah you're going to lack then but as long as you're in christ you're not going gonna lie as long as he's your shepherd you're not gonna laugh now no doubt samson could have done it with his fist too probably but he looked around for some kind of weapon and looked around and he said the bible says he got a dry jawbone old dried up jawbone of a mule right picked it up and as the prophet put it was slamming that guy's helmet snowed out probably hit their helmets so hard until they fractured their head now can you imagine what it would do to a dry jawbone the splintering that would take place hallelujah he could praise be the god it's not samson it's not the job only it's god that caused him not to lack david with the bear he didn't like he didn't like when it comes to goliath oh my moses didn't lack god doesn't want his children to lack do you want your children to like no you don't want your children to lack you want to teach them everything they need to know and you want to supply them with what they have need of [Music] how careful we are to make sure we have the right vitamins and all this that and the other that you eat your beans that you eat your corn to eat your meat to make sure they're all healthy do our best to make sure that our children are healthy that they're taken care of what about us who are the armies of the living god will let god supply you with the weapons that you need with the power that you need to fight this battle in this layout i see age that we're living in amen folks we got to go higher you're going to have to get closer to god are you with me as we go on we got to get closer we got to become better closer more like christ all the time praise be to god live or die live or die live for christ amen praise the lord tapping into the resource i mean believe it when you tap oh my at the thought when you tap into god you have tapped into those resources those untapped resources amen how many believes that because you've done tapped into everything huh everything that you have need of praise be to god you know but peter put it this way when he was talking about partakers of the precious promises and so forth that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature so what was peter talking about he was talking about a nature change for us wasn't he because everything else is external folks like i said wednesday it's the fire that matters it's our nature that matters peter said we've been given all these promises through jesus christ amen whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life amen from the promises to you to your children the baptism of the holy ghost it's god's precious promise the baptism of the holy ghost is god's precious promise and it will change your nature you can try to quit this and you can try to quit that you can try all of that you want to but you'll never succeed until you see god i don't know about all that i just want more of your nature i need your holy ghost where it's not my nature to do that it's not my desire to do that are you with me listen to everybody that's a secret right there i just told you a secret of entering in amen and being able to overcome the only way with your the only way you're going to overcome is being partakers of this divine nature it has how maybe it has to be your nature not something you force yourself to do amen we've been partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust folks you think you can climb a little higher i think we got to climb a little higher we look at what jesus did walked on water raised lazarus from the dead huh we look what jesus did in brother banham's ministry 13 people are so raised from the dead what was it when brother branham was over in germany i believe it wasn't that little boy that vision that he had that he had wrote down everybody had wrote down and his accident and all of a sudden disappeared and he realized that that was that boy that they had probably had prophesied would raise a bunch of russian soldiers and everything else hello that was around he says man the russians were hugging finnish people i guess they were really at odds with each other hated each other but the russians and the different ones says we'll serve a god that can raise the dead that's what brother brennan's ministry was all about is proving that jesus is alive to the world that's what it was all about he proved to the world that god is real and then we look at brother branham's life and we see him stopping a storm creating squirrels speaking to a bull huh when is it going to be before we have testimonies like that here in this church yes this certain thing it may not be a bull or all of that but whatever it is you'll be able to come to church and say i have a testimony i was about to die and i prayed and believed the holy spirit come down that love came over me huh and god took care of my situations i don't know about you but that's where i want to get to i want to get to where all things are possible and i see the power of god in my life like never before amen always thirsting for more and it never runs dry ironman aren't you glad for that this morning i know that's your heart's desire too you wouldn't be sitting there if it wasn't amen oh my god's attributes is what we're talking about how many knows he's a deliverer you need deliverance god's there to deliver and he is the mighty deliverer because david remember what david said he didn't say i'ma take your head off this side or the other i believe if i you go back and look again i believe he says god that delivered the lion to me god that delivered to bear to me god's going to deliver you hallelujah it was god's delivering power he had need of deliverance now take this stone and put it where it belongs and deliver that diet to me it's not my ability but it's god's ability how many believe that's how we got to live we can't live our own ability we got to have god's ability oh what a shame your oh what a savior is mine how many glad that man you in your wretched condition your sinful condition god came down and he saved you and i'll sing about it through ceaseless ages that is to come his deliverance praise be to god for his deliverance amen my you could just go on and on prepared all right god supplies god causes you not to need he supplies all our needs every day for the rest of your life anybody ever wondered how in the world you gonna die yeah brother come on come on i can't hear you that's right we all think about it how's it going babe [Music] then we think about the fact that it's probably better that we don't know uh it's really best you don't know because you would worry and fret wouldn't you man if it was my fire or by accident you wouldn't drive in the car you'd go horsebuggy or something uh you fear but you know what is one good thing how many knows this one good thing about it is god's got to got you taken care of how many please god will be there for you precious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints it's a precious thing to him huh you know he's watching over you he knows how you're going to die it doesn't matter how you're going to die as long as he's with you knows he's there you're all right how many believes that yeah he will supply that's been taken care of you're not going to lack you're not going to want when it comes to there how many wants to make sure when i get into that place i don't want to lack i don't want to suffer needs oh oh god i'm so sorry oh god help me help me help me huh no you want to be right where you want to be to say you can say this is my coronation day this is busy today amen i'm going to be with my loved ones and with jesus amen so god's going to take care of it how many is glad for god i shall not want david knew that god supplies all his needs amen i'm so thankful that jesus supplied them all at calvary everything amen over in psalms 23 for just a little longer psalms 23 we're going to go through this the lord is my shepherd i shall not want amen he maketh me to lie down in green pastures praise the lord i like that where the water's been flowing isn't that right it has to have water to be green not dry places but green places he leadeth me besides the still waters amen how many believes that be still and know that i am god he restoreth my soul huh praise the lord david knew what it was like to get away from god and david knew what it was like to be reconciled to god huh he restoreth my soul and he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake i mean that's what also what god does lead you in the path of righteousness and now notice here i like this scripture yay though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death that's this life brother branham explained that's what this life is not just the door of death but this life is the valley of the shadow of death amen i will fear evil did i miss something here oh my stomp with me yeah i will fear no evil no way how many how much newt we've had a calvary since david we had a cross since david that taking care of the fear of death taking care of any kind of fear that wants to come on you i hope everybody that fears a little heard that any kind of fear that comes upon you you remember the lord is watching over you he's taking care of you he's going to watch out for you you do not have to fear any evil we've had some brave brave christians down through the dark ages that they would turn the lions loose on them huh all kinds of things that dude they didn't fear no evil god gave him the victory over that amen they gladly went to their deaths huh if you wanted to go home to be with the lord all you have to do is come out of your catacombs and say i'm a christian i define the czech catholic church that pope and all that's the antichrist oh boy did you know if you said the pope was the antichrist they'd find a special death for you they'd put you in this barrel somewhere with razor blades all in it and turn you a few times until you were done or have a satchel of the virgin mary right with the arms out and stuff and coming together and smash you with pierce you through where's our christians today i have heard of christians long ago isn't that right it'd be fought before a tyrant's wrong they were told that he would spare their life amen but they would not deny the name of christ one by one they chose to die amen amen god's word they would not deny great they feared no evil and why for thou art with me thyroid i don't know all these words perhaps but you know rod most of the time the rod of correction the staff of taking care of you and watching over you but the right correction that rod and i staff they comfort me amen that prepares the table before the uh if now prepares the table before me in the presence of mine enemies now i know it is my head with oil my cup runs over woo gotta anoint you so much until you just gotta run around the tree you just gotta give the god a dance you just gotta shout you just gotta praise god it's such an anointing until your cup runs over fill my cup lord i lift it up praise be to god aren't you glad surely terribleness and no mercy is going to follow me no surely my goodness and mercy shall follow me all the day of my life how many believes when god supplies and when he takes care of him causes you not the one it's for all the days of your life i've been born again probably since i was 20 60 20 30 40 56 40 years i'm here to testify god's always taking care of me i've never lacked yeah even when you get away from god god don't lack he takes you back he forgives you how many believe there's forgiveness hallelujah aren't you glad for that if if he wouldn't take you back you'd be empty hearted the whole time you have no peace you'd have no comfort paul said in romans 2 i believe it is for the ungodly there's nothing but wrath and indignation and judgment and all of that waiting for the unbeliever not in my notes can we go to it it's in his notes if i can find it that is all right but unto them verse 8 of chapter 2 unto them that are contentious and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness boy they don't have a whole lot of taking care of us do they okay but obey not the truth but obey unrighteousness indignation wrath tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that do with evil wow i i'm glad to be on the right side aren't you aren't you glad that you have a god that surprise causes you to be by still waters restores your soul gives you joy happiness promises you promise you see you that you have everything that you have need of right in you preacher ain't got to get it too nobody else got you've got it already whatever it is that you have need of amen i'm so thankful for that all right we go let's go on i didn't even see this i've seen it before but upon every soul of man to do with evil to the jew first and also to the gentile but glory how many knows it's glory praise the lord coming to church it's heavenly places i mean please we're in heavenly places in christ jesus this morning we are not will be we are now in heavenly places glory and honor and peace amen i like that glory and honor and peace to every man that worketh good to the jew first and also to the gentiles praise be to god for there is no respect of persons with god for as many as have sinned without the law shall also perish without the law and as many as have sinned in the law shall also be judged by the law praise be to god one more scripture before we close matthew 22. matthew 22 brother brandon makes reference to this scripture in preaching things that are to be when he spoke of how that how that everything was prepared for us when we came here everything will be prepared for us when we go over younder god is taking care of it all he has supplied all these things and prepared everything and in matthew 22 and verse 4 he says well let's just go back let's read all of this and jesus answered and speak unto them again by parables and said the kingdom of heaven is like a to a certain king which made a marriage for his son and he sent forth his servants to call them that were bitten to the wedding and they would not come again he sent forth servants saint tell them which are been behold i have prepared my dinner how many means god is prepared jesus has a table spread where everything you have need of can be taken care of if you're hungry for whatever it is god has that taken care of for you my falcon and my battlings are killed and all things are ready praise be to god come unto the marriage so we know that god calls the whole world and says look i've prepared everything i believe that's what will be said on the judgment days i prepared everything i gave you everything [Applause] why did you take it they won't have an excuse the world will not have an excuse i looked somewhere in the news this week and one of the commentators i guess somewhere said you know that the new generation of kids that don't know jesus he says they're making things better for us they're gonna be it's gonna be better with the kids that don't know jesus it's actually a better generation brother bad that just almost gets your righteous indignation up look at the kids look how they kill each other look at that you call that better that's how blind this world is let me tell you something what they need is jesus they need jesus more than ever that's why it's a complete riot out there it's because they don't know jesus that was a devil talk and if i ever heard it isn't that right to say that it's a better it's not a better generation ain't nobody i don't care if it's teenagers or older people who it is without christ you're not a better person no not at all amen i'm so glad aren't you glad that you have come to his table to eat to come say lord you know what i have need of let's stand and i want you to think about what you have need of this morning amen what is it that you need do you believe god can supply that this morning if it's a closer walk if it's more of the holy ghost let me tell you something we shouldn't be getting drained of the holy ghost we shouldn't be we should be getting more full of the holy spirit but you can't do it if you spend more time on the things of the world and less reading and pray how many knows that this just comes fresh i got this wrote down but remember the woman that asked how can i get closer to god what did he say read your bible more and pray more that's the only way that you'll get more is by drinking more looking through here say god's what's mine lord how should i be what should i be father where do i lack come let's apply that lack i'm here to tell you i believe jesus is telling each and every one of us that he wants to be he's here this morning he's telling you i want to give you what you have need of i want to give you what you have need of more than what you wanted that was that's a quote god is more willing to pour himself into us than what we're willing to open up and let him how many believes that so maybe that would be a desire this morning lord help me to be willing to open up how many is with me lord let me be willing to open up to let you in and as you pastor i'm here to tell you the way that you do that is you meditate more on god you pray more you read your bible more you focus more let the spiritual man grow [Music] starve that natural man a little bit deprive him of taking all of your time that you should have for god take back that time amen your dedication your surrenderance amen how many that's what it's going to take we all desire to see more of god in our lives these miracles see things i'm not necessarily looking for them i just want more of god because i know that it'll happen then everything will take its place but i need more god i need to be closer to him amen and he's bringing me closer to him i trust he is you are you better today than you was last week last month are you better this year than last year how is it huh ask yourself that question where are you at where you want to go closer to him let's bow our heads lord jesus you see our hands father we need more of you amen you're all we need like a song said lord are you he's all i need he's all i need jesus is all i need lord for you we know how you care about us we already discussed that lord jesus the fall of a spirit a number over here and so forth the clothes that we have the food that we have you already see you care about all that you take care of that lord but father we just ask god that you'd help us to care more about you father to love you greater lord to go into deeper depth higher height with you not to stay on the same plateau and certainly not backslide or go further away from you father we ask god forgive us of our back slidings are going away from you just law lord jesus and we pray father that you take every life in here [Music] every schedule that everyone has lord and father their schedule is so busy that it's taking them away from you lord i pray god that they would reschedule their schedule the lord and reprogram themselves so that they'd have more time with you and that goes for me too lord jesus help me to have more time for you lord to meditate and to pray and lord to have a desire and a passion for the lost like you do father for a desire to get people closer to you lord to lead them to your father take all these little frictions take all of these little things that shouldn't even be bothering us take them away from us lord and help us have a real relationship with you this morning as we raise our hands we ask god that you would help us lord each hand that i saw go up lord that wants to open up their heart in a greater way so that you can pour yourself into us in a greater way lord so that we can have more of you father and lord see more of your glory in our lives that's our heart's desire and we come to you now asking god that you pour more of yourself into us lord he says we're here to drink we say come into my heart come into my heart call me into my heart lord jesus come in today come in to stay come into my heart in a greater way lord jesus this morning may i go from here with peace in my heart greater than what i had when i came in those doors lord a greater peace a greater dedication lord that when i go back to my home when i go back to my job lord that i'm more dedicated more sincere and more loving more kind god so that the people around me will be able to see a difference in my life and they will see not me but they'll see you lord they'll see christ in our lives help us to be alive help us to shine our light to this world father and wherever we are lord let this little light shine we ask in jesus christ's name now for your honor in your glory amen and amen god bless you brother josh if you would
