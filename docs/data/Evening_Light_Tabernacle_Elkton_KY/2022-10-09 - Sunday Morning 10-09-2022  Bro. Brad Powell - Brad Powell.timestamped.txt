[10:50] the way to go right there that's a good
[10:52] good thing to be happy about praise be
[10:54] to God God is good isn't he amen so I'm
[10:57] going to do Sunday school this morning
[10:59] and uh amen so if you want to turn with
[11:02] me I'm going to talk a little bit about
[11:04] the big band
[11:06] that'd be all right
[11:07] talk about the big bang you mean we're
[11:10] going to have our version of The Big
[11:12] Bang will that be all right
[11:15] turn if you will to Second Peter
[11:31] second Peter
[11:35] and uh
[11:37] verse chapter 3
[11:43] how many knows that this whole thing
[11:45] is going to go out in a big bang
[11:49] amen it's going to go out in a big bang
[11:51] they claim that it came in with a big
[11:53] bang well I don't know about all that
[11:54] but I know it's going out in a big bang
[11:57] amen
[11:58] so chapter 3 verse 9 the Lord is not
[12:03] slack like something that he is
[12:06] concerning his promise as some men
[12:09] counts lackleness but it's
[12:11] long-suffering to us word not willing
[12:13] that any should perish but that all
[12:15] should come to repentance but the day of
[12:18] the Lord will come as a thief in the
[12:20] night into which the heavens shall pass
[12:23] away with a great noise
[12:28] amen
[12:30] great noise and the elements shall melt
[12:33] with fervent heat the Earth also and the
[12:36] works that are therein shall be
[12:39] burned up amen how many knows all this
[12:43] wickedness all this evil is going to be
[12:46] burned
[12:47] it's all going to be burned up amen
[12:51] seeing then that all these things shall
[12:53] be dissolved what manner of persons are
[12:57] ye to be in all holy conversation and
[13:00] godliness
[13:01] amen notice that I want to just focus on
[13:04] that for a minute
[13:05] see that's what we're focusing on right
[13:07] we're focusing on the fact that it's all
[13:10] going to come to an end it's going to be
[13:11] dissolved amen and it causes us to be
[13:15] prepared for it amen get ready for
[13:17] what's coming
[13:18] amen because it's certainly on us
[13:21] looking for and Hasting unto the coming
[13:25] of the day of God if you'll notice it
[13:28] didn't say the Lord's coming we are
[13:31] looking for that but this calls it the
[13:33] day of God I mean those in the church
[13:36] age but probably God said this is man's
[13:38] day man has his day they do with you
[13:40] what you want slap you around but God's
[13:42] gonna have his day
[13:44] when he has his day it's gonna be his
[13:47] day amen praise the Lord
[13:51] his the day of the Lord wherein the
[13:53] heavens being on fire shall be dissolved
[13:56] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[13:58] Heat nevertheless we according to his
[14:01] promise look for a new heavens and a
[14:04] newer
[14:05] praise the Lord
[14:07] amen wherein dwelleth righteousness amen
[14:10] so now notice I'll treat one more verse
[14:12] and then we'll quit wherefore beloved
[14:14] seeing that he looked for such things be
[14:17] diligent that you may be found of him in
[14:20] peace without spot and blameless how
[14:24] many believe that every individual is
[14:27] personally responsible to find yourself
[14:30] that way don't rely on nobody else don't
[14:33] expect nobody else to get you this way
[14:34] just expect
[14:36] it out of yourself
[14:38] amen that's right Let each individual be
[14:42] diligent that you may be found of him in
[14:44] peace
[14:45] now notice I want to go back up again uh
[14:49] nevertheless we
[14:50] according to it to his promise look for
[14:53] a new heavens and a new Earth and if
[14:56] you'll notice verse 10 also it says uh
[15:00] they wait a minute long suffering the
[15:04] day of the Lord will come as a thief
[15:05] tonight in which the heavens so there it
[15:07] is that's what I'm looking for in which
[15:09] the heavens shall pass away with a great
[15:12] noise and the elements shall melt with
[15:15] fervent heat and I mean those heavens
[15:18] and earth
[15:19] I shall pass away Jesus said but my word
[15:22] shall never pass away
[15:24] now pass away we know that when a person
[15:27] passes away they die isn't that right
[15:30] but they don't become extinct they're
[15:33] not extinct they're not annihilated to
[15:36] pass away it's not the you know this
[15:39] Earth that we're living on we know that
[15:40] it's not going to be annihilated or
[15:42] extinct now it's never going to nothing
[15:45] because we know that this is the very
[15:47] Earth that God cleanses and purifies
[15:49] just like he did to your body amen we
[15:52] give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[15:53] he cleansed it and purified it and made
[15:55] a place for him to dwell amen and so it
[15:58] passes away the Earth the heavens and
[16:00] earth will pass away not in our late
[16:02] amen and so we know that it's going to
[16:05] pass away all the evil that is in it is
[16:08] going to pass away
[16:10] amen now I want to turn over to
[16:13] Revelation 20
[16:15] first chapter and we want to look at it
[16:17] after it has passed away after the big
[16:21] bang after the great noise
[16:23] amen and see what what it looks like
[16:26] amen Isn't it nice to be able to have
[16:28] not a uh Daily Newspaper but this is
[16:33] this is the news of the future amen
[16:36] how many knows that your daily newspaper
[16:39] tells you what happened yesterday
[16:42] you know that would they always write
[16:44] about what happened yesterday but this
[16:46] not only tells you what happens
[16:47] yesterday it tells you what's happening
[16:49] today and it tells you what's going to
[16:52] happen tomorrow
[16:53] and you can Bank on it
[16:58] oh my yo isn't it awesome to know that
[17:00] there's something that's absolute sure
[17:04] nothing else outside of this is sure
[17:07] amen but this is absolute it is short
[17:10] amen and I'm thankful for that all right
[17:14] now Revelations 21 we want to look at
[17:16] this now notice it says
[17:19] yeah
[17:21] I remember Peter said we look for what
[17:24] a new heavens and a new Earth
[17:27] that's right made new
[17:29] now in Revelation 21. now we know this
[17:32] is of course after uh tribulation period
[17:35] and all that and I saw a new Heaven and
[17:38] a new Earth
[17:40] for the first heavens and the first
[17:43] Earth were passed away how did they pass
[17:46] away with a great noise
[17:48] now notice and there was no more sea now
[17:52] prophet of God told us that even the sea
[17:54] will blow up in this great noise
[17:57] because
[17:59] of the age
[18:00] and man you talk about
[18:02] fire you talk about burning the elements
[18:05] everything will melt with ferprint heat
[18:07] it all passed away and there was no
[18:09] mercy I mean those two-thirds of the
[18:13] earth is ocean
[18:15] right
[18:18] there won't be no shortage of places for
[18:20] us
[18:22] praise the Lord
[18:23] man I can't imagine you know you know
[18:26] it's just it causes your mind to kind of
[18:31] uh go into
[18:33] you know because you look at all these
[18:35] cities and look at all this skyscrapers
[18:37] and all this how are you going to bury
[18:38] all that how are we going to get rid of
[18:39] all that because we surely won't
[18:42] be
[18:44] heaven
[18:46] two-thirds amen that'll be that much
[18:48] more for us now notice so he says and I
[18:51] saw the holy city
[18:53] need a new Jerusalem coming down from
[18:57] God out of Heaven prepared as a bride
[19:01] and adorned for her husband
[19:04] praise God
[19:06] how many knows that's what this new
[19:08] place that God's Gonna Be he's building
[19:10] a place for us
[19:11] and it's going to be just like a brand
[19:14] new wife walking up all adorned and
[19:17] that's something how he always adorned
[19:20] the woman all the men don't adorn that
[19:22] much the woman's under the doors
[19:24] and all is about her you don't get no
[19:27] round of love when he comes logging in
[19:29] uh or stand up Ovation and everybody
[19:31] look
[19:33] but for her it's a special place special
[19:35] thing isn't that right that's the way it
[19:37] is with Christ and his bride
[19:39] because amen we see uh
[19:42] uh you know that I don't even knows God
[19:44] has a bride God has a church God has a
[19:46] people amen and when this comes down
[19:48] it's going to be a thing of beauty
[19:51] and I I Can Only You Can Only Imagine
[19:55] all right
[19:57] and I heard a great voice out of Heaven
[19:59] saying behold the Tabernacle of God is
[20:02] with men and he shall dwell with them
[20:06] now how many knows he does dwell with
[20:07] them us now
[20:09] but he's in US amen we don't see his
[20:12] Corporal body
[20:14] but how many notes will see his
[20:16] corporate body then
[20:18] we will dwell right there with him
[20:21] and not amongst these and not about this
[20:24] unbelief not amongst this homosexual and
[20:27] all these others

[22:24] oh my
[22:26] God oh neither sorrow nor crying and
[22:30] neither shall there be any more pain
[22:34] praise be to God you know this world is
[22:36] full of pain and suffering
[22:40] lots of pain and suffering goes on in
[22:42] this world a lot of weeping a lot of
[22:44] crying and a lot of disappointments but
[22:47] all that's going to be gone you're not
[22:49] going to be any of that there it's hard
[22:51] for us to imagine it but it's true amen
[22:55] no more pain for the former things are
[22:58] passed away
[23:01] amen aren't many glad for that all of
[23:04] that is going to be absent from our
[23:07] presence
[23:09] and he that sat upon this Throne said
[23:12] behold
[23:14] I like that behold I make all things new
[23:20] praise be to God and he said unto me
[23:23] right
[23:24] for these words our faith are true and
[23:29] faithful I like that
[23:33] now notice we counted hours the end of
[23:36] the whole Bible and then he said unto me
[23:40] it is done
[23:43] I mean those are going to come a time
[23:45] when it's all done
[23:49] praise the Lord
[23:51] so many things we go through in life
[23:53] that we're done this is done that's done
[23:56] can't go with your daddy
[23:59] with that
[24:01] and that day we'll come over there when
[24:03] we're over there
[24:06] The Voice will say it is done
[24:09] there was one other time I believe God
[24:11] said it is finished right that was on
[24:15] Calvary when he purchased your salvation
[24:17] when he purchased your healing when he
[24:20] purchased your joy when he purchased
[24:22] everything you ever had need of and he
[24:24] bought it and he paid for it he said it
[24:26] is done the work is done the suffering
[24:28] it's done the bleeding's done that right
[24:30] just before he gave up the ghost he said
[24:32] it's finished my work is done come
[24:35] another time when he says it's done
[24:37] that's after his people are with him
[24:40] that he has redeemed and purchased amen
[24:44] I am the first or I am Alpha and I am
[24:48] the Omega I am the beginning and I am
[24:52] the end
[24:53] and I will give unto him that is the
[24:55] thirst
[24:56] amen I may believe that it's such a
[24:59] blessing to want to go to church yeah
[25:03] you can be glad that you're thirsty for
[25:06] some life for more of God
[25:08] be thankful for nothing oh my
[25:14] it's sad that we have
[25:16] one empty Pew it's sad that we have an
[25:19] empty balcony
[25:23] the whole world should thirst for this
[25:27] but they don't do that
[25:30] that's why we have a smaller crowd
[25:31] because there's just fewer people that
[25:34] have a real thirst and a real hunger for
[25:36] God
[25:37] how many is hungry and thirsty I mean
[25:40] these God's going to feed him to feed

[55:54] the flow of the Holy Spirit you can feel
[55:57] it from the Sunday School the reading of
[55:59] the word the songs that we're sang and
[56:00] we just want to continue to bring that
[56:02] out and fully surrender ourselves to God
[56:05] this morning and
[56:07] just deliver the word of God thank you
[56:09] musicians appreciate the music
[56:13] you know the songs that we're saying I
[56:15] was writing them down because they they
[56:17] set the pace for the service and and the
[56:20] atmosphere and behold what manner of man
[56:22] is this and take up your cross and
[56:26] um the different ones that were sung and
[56:28] it just goes right along with what I've
[56:30] been looking at this week and and
[56:31] thinking on and I just asked this
[56:34] morning how many of you has been tested
[56:35] this week
[56:38] we're in testing times
[56:41] and the the load is heavy and the burden
[56:44] is heavy the weight is heavy the stress
[56:46] the pressure and I just want to to bring
[56:50] a little message this morning I'm going
[56:52] to try to slow down I don't have a a big
[56:54] plate but I think we got good food uh so
[56:58] uh we're gonna Feast on what the Lord's
[57:00] laid on our on our heart turn to Matthew
[57:02] chapter 11.
[57:06] foreign
[57:09] Matthew chapter 11 this is one of the
[57:11] most familiar scriptures and it's
[57:13] probably been preached on as much as any
[57:15] scripture in the Bible
[57:18] but if we come with Open Hearts it'll be
[57:20] made Anew to us every day
[57:23] Matthew chapter 11 and verse 28.
[57:27] I still hear the pages turning
[57:30] say Amen if you're there
[57:32] amen
[57:33] come unto me all ye that labor and are
[57:38] heavy laden
[57:39] and they didn't notice it didn't say
[57:41] some of you a few of you says all of you
[57:44] all that are that are laboring a heavy
[57:47] laid and I will give you rest
[57:48] take my yoke
[57:51] up on you and learn of me for I am meek
[57:54] and lowly in heart and ye shall find
[57:56] rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy
[58:01] and my burden is light let's just pray
[58:05] Heavenly Father we just come before you
[58:07] this morning with grateful hearts with a
[58:09] great grateful hearts that we can come
[58:11] and fellowship around your word and with
[58:13] the Believers and brothers and sisters
[58:15] have gathered together and they've
[58:16] brought their lick of fire and and we've
[58:19] come together to to set the building of
[58:22] fire so to speak Lord Jesus and or we
[58:24] can definitely feel your presence and
[58:26] Lord we ask that that presence would
[58:27] stay with us as I Surrender myself fully
[58:30] to you Lord I said all thoughts aside
[58:32] and just ask that you would take
[58:33] complete control my thoughts are just
[58:36] broken thoughts and and broken ideas
[58:38] Lord but you're solid you're true your
[58:41] word never fails and Lord we depend upon
[58:44] that open our hearts to receive see what
[58:45] you would have for us Lord and lead us
[58:47] in the way the word would have us to go
[58:49] we just want to tell you we love you and
[58:51] appreciate you and give you all honor
[58:53] and glory for those words that will be
[58:55] spoken in Jesus name amen amen you can
[58:58] have your seats
[59:00] so we look at the scripture here my yoke
[59:03] is easy and my burden is light and when
[59:06] I first looked at this you know we've
[59:07] like I said we've looked at this many
[59:09] many times uh over time and and has been
[59:13] preached over and over but I want you to
[59:15] notice when he talks about his yoke now
[59:17] we don't talk about Yokes and harnesses
[59:19] and such so more so much as we do in the
[59:22] times past but the difference is I want
[59:25] to demonstrate to you or tell you the
[59:27] difference between the harness and a
[59:29] yoke the harness is used on an
[59:32] individual animal
[59:34] so we have an animal that's going out to
[59:36] work and if you're using one animal you
[59:37] put a harness on that animal and that
[59:40] animal begins to work and he's doing
[59:42] you're dependent solely upon that
[59:44] animal's harness it's a pool as he works
[59:46] through the fields but Jesus here the
[59:48] word is telling us take my yoke
[59:52] my yoke because a yoke is used on two
[59:55] different animals
[59:57] it's no longer one person trying to do
[59:59] everything his self it's no longer you
[1:00:02] trying to make your way it's no longer
[1:00:03] you trying to overcome your battles but
[1:00:06] now you're yoked yourself with Jesus
[1:00:09] Christ
[1:00:10] I can't harness myself and overcome this
[1:00:13] world
[1:00:15] I can't put a harness on me and work and
[1:00:18] try to work my way through the obstacles
[1:00:20] that I face on day-to-day basis so I
[1:00:23] have to rely on this scripture and go
[1:00:25] back and say I need to be yoked with you
[1:00:28] Jesus so that I can be an overcomer so
[1:00:31] that I'm not doing this all by myself
[1:00:35] the harness versus the yoke
[1:00:38] and my title this morning is burdens
[1:00:41] into blessings
[1:00:43] think about this I want to focus on
[1:00:46] these two words if and I guess I'm gonna
[1:00:48] try to take my time
[1:00:49] burdens and blessings so as we look at
[1:00:52] burdens
[1:00:54] we look at the word burden and it means
[1:00:56] a load
[1:00:58] it means something we associate with a
[1:01:00] weight or a task or a pressure or a
[1:01:04] stress
[1:01:06] this is the words that type burdens
[1:01:10] and we're living in a burdened age
[1:01:13] and I want you to listen to what the
[1:01:14] dictionary the sentence it uses in it
[1:01:16] says the burden of establishing that the
[1:01:20] cost was unreasonable
[1:01:22] and when I read that I thought man we
[1:01:24] can sure put in there the burden of
[1:01:26] forgiveness
[1:01:27] the cost was unreasonable
[1:01:33] let that sink in for a second
[1:01:35] the burden of forgiveness the cost of
[1:01:38] that was unreasonable
[1:01:39] you and I should never have had to ask
[1:01:41] one man to carry all of our sins
[1:01:45] all of our all of our weaknesses all of
[1:01:48] our doubts all of our fears all of our
[1:01:50] sickness we should never have had to put
[1:01:53] that burden on one man that's an
[1:01:56] unreasonable cost to bear
[1:01:59] He Paid a Debt that I could never pay
[1:02:03] now let's look at the word blessings
[1:02:06] we look at the word blessings
[1:02:10] and we see God's favor
[1:02:13] God's protection God's goodness God's
[1:02:16] reward God's relief success we think
[1:02:19] about this we're all looking for
[1:02:21] blessings right
[1:02:23] how many times do we say Lord bless us
[1:02:25] Lord Lord bless this Lord bless that
[1:02:27] Lord bless my children bless bless bless
[1:02:30] we're looking for blessed sins but let
[1:02:32] me tell you be careful what you ask for
[1:02:37] because you cannot have the blessing
[1:02:40] without first bearing the burden
[1:02:44] no blessing that you'll ever receive
[1:02:46] comes without a cost
[1:02:48] there's a cost that's associated with
[1:02:50] each blessings and I've heard that
[1:02:52] burdens and blessings are first cousins
[1:02:54] they're always together you can't have
[1:02:56] one without the other in other words you
[1:02:58] really can't be blessed until you've
[1:03:00] been burdened
[1:03:03] because blessings are the reward of
[1:03:06] carrying the weight
[1:03:08] [Music]
[1:03:15] brothers and sisters we may not like it
[1:03:17] in our flesh
[1:03:19] we may not get that warm and fuzzy
[1:03:22] feeling and that just little getting us
[1:03:24] and happiness when we go through things
[1:03:27] but our flesh is not what matters
[1:03:31] we have to go through these things we
[1:03:33] have to go through the test and through
[1:03:34] the trials and through the obstacles in
[1:03:36] order for us to be successful
[1:03:39] to be successful Christians to be
[1:03:42] successful business owners to be
[1:03:44] successful church leaders
[1:03:46] [Music]
[1:03:48] you have to be able to go through these
[1:03:50] burdens
[1:03:54] I thought about this
[1:03:57] and I can remember when I first started
[1:03:59] preaching
[1:04:02] fun times
[1:04:05] not really
[1:04:09] but you were prepared and you prepare
[1:04:11] and you prepare and the people look at
[1:04:13] you with a stare on their face
[1:04:18] and I wondered it I wanted I wonder when
[1:04:20] are they ever going to respond to what
[1:04:22] I'm saying
[1:04:24] what are they going to look and really
[1:04:26] be thinking what are you saying some
[1:04:28] good stuff amen he's really preaching
[1:04:31] preach brother amen what are they going
[1:04:32] to do that when are they going to help
[1:04:33] me
[1:04:36] and then I had a wise preacher by the
[1:04:39] name of bro Daryl Ward
[1:04:41] you know I talked to him and he said
[1:04:43] Brother Brad he said
[1:04:45] I don't mean to hurt your feelings
[1:04:48] but the
[1:04:50] people are enduring you
[1:04:59] yeah you talking about
[1:05:02] busting that bubble
[1:05:05] the people are enduring you because you
[1:05:08] haven't been through things yet
[1:05:11] you haven't been through the challenges
[1:05:13] of life you can't get up there and tell
[1:05:15] how a marriage is supposed to work you
[1:05:16] ain't been married long enough you don't
[1:05:18] know what it means to see your kids
[1:05:19] suffer you don't even have kids they're
[1:05:21] just too young you don't know the
[1:05:23] burdens of life where you can portray it
[1:05:26] and give it back to the people
[1:05:28] they are enduring you
[1:05:35] that's a burden
[1:05:39] but now I've come to realize that it's
[1:05:42] our responsibility to show the world how
[1:05:45] Christ reacts in a crisis
[1:05:49] it's on our shoulders now to show the
[1:05:52] world what happens when we as Christians
[1:05:54] are challenged so let me throw some
[1:05:56] words at you and ask yourself how often
[1:05:58] you can relate to these words
[1:06:00] barrier
[1:06:04] how many has ever felt like you've had
[1:06:05] barriers throwed up in your life
[1:06:08] you've had things come up a hurdle
[1:06:13] you ever watched those people run
[1:06:15] hurdles
[1:06:16] oh they look good for about the first
[1:06:18] 100 meters and after that them legs
[1:06:20] start really really hard to get over
[1:06:21] them
[1:06:23] it's a hurdle in their life of stumbling
[1:06:26] Bach a snag a setback
[1:06:31] here's one we hear and we hate to hear
[1:06:34] a complication
[1:06:42] doctor comes out says I'm sorry the
[1:06:43] surgery didn't go as well we run into
[1:06:45] some complications
[1:06:48] what kind of Burden does that instantly
[1:06:49] hit you with
[1:06:51] complications difficulty problems
[1:06:54] disadvantaged
[1:06:57] we can all relate to these words
[1:06:59] and we can all put these and we consider
[1:07:01] these words as as blocks and things that
[1:07:03] prevent us from achieving or hinders us
[1:07:06] and our success but that's not the way
[1:07:08] God sees it
[1:07:10] when God sees these words when God hears
[1:07:12] us use these words he says I see a
[1:07:15] blessing in the making
[1:07:17] I see an opportunity for a child of mine
[1:07:20] to overcome a mountain that he couldn't
[1:07:22] go over I see an opportunity for for my
[1:07:25] child to to overcome and rise to an
[1:07:28] occasion higher than he ever has if
[1:07:30] he'll just yoke his self with me
[1:07:34] if he will lay down his burdens
[1:07:37] right
[1:07:38] yeah and leave it alone
[1:07:42] foreign
[1:07:45] I'm sorry you're going to get them
[1:07:46] anyway
[1:07:49] to the prophet he says now go
[1:07:53] es on son from the cruel testing
[1:07:56] that he's not going to spare you or I
[1:07:59] from Cruel testing
[1:08:01] [Music]
[1:08:03] I had somebody earlier well it's been
[1:08:06] some time ago
[1:08:09] they were
[1:08:10] giving me their wisdom
[1:08:13] they don't attend church but they were
[1:08:15] giving me their wisdom
[1:08:17] and they were telling me how that this
[1:08:19] young couple was planning to move and
[1:08:21] everything was going uh against them and
[1:08:24] this fell through and that fell through
[1:08:26] and they're they're moving for this
[1:08:28] reason they think it's going to help
[1:08:29] them here and help them there and
[1:08:31] they're trying to do this and do that
[1:08:32] and everything's just falling apart and
[1:08:34] he said you know what I'm not I'm not a
[1:08:36] religious person but it looks to me like
[1:08:38] if this was God's plan
[1:08:41] everything would go smooth
[1:08:45] the way you said that right you're not a
[1:08:47] religious person
[1:08:49] because that's not the way things
[1:08:50] operate
[1:08:51] if you want the blessings of a good
[1:08:54] church
[1:08:55] you're going to have to burden for that
[1:08:57] if you want the blessings of a good job
[1:08:58] you're going to have to bear the burden
[1:09:00] of that if you want the blessings on
[1:09:01] your children you're gonna have to bear
[1:09:03] the burden of that and pray and pray and
[1:09:05] pray don't let roadblocks and barriers
[1:09:08] and stumbling blocks set you back and
[1:09:10] think well that's not God's will
[1:09:12] maybe God is setting you up to overcome
[1:09:16] and show the world
[1:09:18] that he is able
[1:09:20] [Applause]
[1:09:21] [Music]
[1:09:25] here was Jesus was confronting his
[1:09:28] greatest test that he ever had
[1:09:30] Gethsemane just laid before him he said
[1:09:33] it was that once and final
[1:09:34] all-sufficient test that must come when
[1:09:37] the burdens of the entire world
[1:09:40] laid upon his blessed shoulder
[1:09:44] he said there was no one in all of
[1:09:46] heaven or earth that could that could
[1:09:47] ever stood it but him
[1:09:49] and to know that all the sins of past
[1:09:52] present and future rested upon his
[1:09:55] decision
[1:09:56] and it was one of the most greatest
[1:09:58] victories that Christ ever won proved
[1:10:01] his great messiahship and when he said
[1:10:04] to God not my will but thine be done
[1:10:09] not my will but thine be done that was
[1:10:11] the greatest victory that he had ever
[1:10:13] won all the Demons of Torment was around
[1:10:16] him to tempt him and try him
[1:10:20] in another place he's talking on the
[1:10:22] same same kind of story and yes all the
[1:10:25] demons were there to torment and to try
[1:10:27] and brother Branham said that Billy
[1:10:30] Sunday said that there was Angel setting
[1:10:31] in every tree limb all around just
[1:10:34] waiting for his call
[1:10:36] to change the situation
[1:10:39] but God cared about us too much
[1:10:42] and he plays those burdens upon him and
[1:10:44] he stood there and he took that torture
[1:10:46] and he said not my will but thine be
[1:10:49] done and we have to get into our minds
[1:10:51] and we have to say not my will
[1:10:53] but thine be done
[1:10:55] you know it's easy to come and say Lord
[1:10:57] I'm gonna lay my birds
[1:10:59] down
[1:11:00] and you lay down this problem and then
[1:11:03] you try to fix it and figure it out all
[1:11:05] week long
[1:11:07] you want the outcome to still be what
[1:11:09] you want it to be
[1:11:11] that's not thy will being done
[1:11:14] [Music]
[1:11:16] we have to get to a place that when we
[1:11:18] have burdens when we have cares and
[1:11:19] concerns and things that we have no
[1:11:21] control over we lay it down at the foot
[1:11:23] of the cross and we walk away from it
[1:11:25] and say whatever the whatever the
[1:11:28] situation whatever the circumstance
[1:11:30] however this ends God it's you
[1:11:39] he said and when we get right with God
[1:11:42] our hearts become pure the holy spirit
[1:11:43] is taking place in our hearts it's the
[1:11:46] most glorious thing the Bible tells us
[1:11:48] our testings and trials
[1:11:50] are more precious
[1:11:53] silver and gold
[1:11:57] that's that's hard that's hard to
[1:12:00] swallow
[1:12:01] and James he begins to talk about it in
[1:12:04] the book of James
[1:12:05] after when he talks about the troubles
[1:12:07] that we have in life and he says my
[1:12:09] brethren counted all joy
[1:12:12] when you fall into diver's Temptations
[1:12:14] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:12:16] faith worketh patience
[1:12:19] so you mean to tell me that I'm supposed
[1:12:21] to consider
[1:12:22] this
[1:12:24] pure joy
[1:12:28] man y'all get quiet
[1:12:31] when life comes knocking at your door
[1:12:35] hey yes sir who are you I'm problems
[1:12:40] that's who I am I'm problems
[1:12:44] I'm fear
[1:12:47] I'm anxiety
[1:12:49] I'm pressure
[1:12:53] well they've knocked on my door I don't
[1:12:54] know if they've ever been it's yours
[1:12:58] I'm supposed to consider that Joy
[1:13:01] and I'm supposed to look at that and
[1:13:03] face my trials and know that these
[1:13:05] testings are going to develop
[1:13:06] perseverance
[1:13:10] that's when we want to throw in the
[1:13:11] towel so many times
[1:13:13] I quit
[1:13:15] things go wrong at work I'm done
[1:13:18] we're going to throw in a towel we quit
[1:13:19] your marriage hits a little bump in the
[1:13:21] road we're divorced
[1:13:30] this applies to all Christians
[1:13:33] because James there he says we should he
[1:13:36] didn't say that we should Rejoice if
[1:13:40] we have trials
[1:13:42] you can look at it later James chapter
[1:13:44] one he said you will rejoice when you
[1:13:47] have trials
[1:13:50] you know it's easy to be a Christian
[1:13:52] when things are going good
[1:13:54] but let's let the problems come knocking
[1:13:57] at the door then things get a little
[1:13:58] more sticky a little more difficult a
[1:14:00] little hairy situation there and the
[1:14:02] next thing you know you're wondering can
[1:14:04] I even praise God
[1:14:09] foreign
[1:14:12] these trials are what molds us
[1:14:15] and makes us
[1:14:17] these trials we have to learn how to get
[1:14:20] through these problems
[1:14:23] but I'm afraid sometimes many times we
[1:14:26] try to focus more on ourselves and not
[1:14:27] enough on God
[1:14:30] and we step into that pity party phase
[1:14:34] yeah
[1:14:35] woe is me
[1:14:37] pity party God just don't love me
[1:14:42] if he loved me he wouldn't do me this
[1:14:44] way
[1:14:45] and we begin to step into that phase
[1:14:47] right there instead of really instead of
[1:14:49] looking and taking the problem
[1:14:53] to the problem solver
[1:14:56] we magnify the problem
[1:15:00] we begin to brag and and just tell Satan
[1:15:03] how good this problem is and we tell
[1:15:05] everybody about it
[1:15:08] the doctor said if I don't do this and
[1:15:11] I'm gonna have this and I got so many
[1:15:13] months to live and this is the kind of
[1:15:15] cancer you can never get over and the
[1:15:17] heart disease they don't even know if
[1:15:19] they've got appeal to correct it go to
[1:15:21] the problem solver
[1:15:24] don't magnify the problem lay it at his
[1:15:27] feet
[1:15:30] [Music]
[1:15:32] I'm going to take just a minute to
[1:15:35] talk about Trevor hessen
[1:15:39] as I was thinking about this week Joyce
[1:15:41] to talk to Tina yesterday
[1:15:45] and we prayed for Trevor and we prayed
[1:15:48] for him and we've seen things happen
[1:15:49] we've seen since he was 15 he's what 21
[1:15:52] now
[1:15:53] 20.
[1:15:56] and we look at the situation
[1:16:00] and I look at it Through The Eyes of a
[1:16:02] nurse
[1:16:04] and I hear he's got tubes in both lungs
[1:16:08] a tube down his throat
[1:16:12] tubes drains coming out of his sides and
[1:16:15] he's got sepsis
[1:16:20] I never claimed it I never said it out
[1:16:22] loud but I thought this boy will never
[1:16:23] make it
[1:16:27] you don't realize the magnitude of what
[1:16:30] he was going through
[1:16:32] I've seen this in hospitals
[1:16:35] I've seen people get septic and be gone
[1:16:37] in a couple of hours
[1:16:40] I've seen tubes that get backed up and
[1:16:43] cause people to drown on their own
[1:16:44] breath
[1:16:46] I've seen this over and over and so I
[1:16:49] knew the magnitude of this this young
[1:16:51] man had been through over I think over a
[1:16:53] hundred surgeries
[1:16:54] under Anastasia over a hundred times
[1:16:59] and the doctors come out and say we had
[1:17:00] a little complication it was supposed to
[1:17:02] be a eight nine ten hour surgery it was
[1:17:04] 15 hours and not to mention we lost a
[1:17:06] part of his esophagus inside of him
[1:17:14] this is serious serious business
[1:17:17] and Joyce was talking to Tina and she
[1:17:19] was just elated yesterday
[1:17:22] he ate some mashed potatoes
[1:17:26] he drunk a little fluid
[1:17:28] somebody come up to him and Hobby Lobby
[1:17:31] you think where is the blessings in this
[1:17:33] bird
[1:17:36] How can there be a blessing in watching
[1:17:38] your loved when your child that she bore
[1:17:40] herself and his race from 15 years old
[1:17:42] to now go through surgery and surgery
[1:17:45] and so
[1:17:46] suffering and suffering where is the
[1:17:48] blessings God
[1:17:51] she said somebody out of the blue come
[1:17:52] walking up to her at Hobby Lobby
[1:17:55] and she started crying
[1:17:58] I said I want you to know we've been
[1:17:59] praying for you
[1:18:01] and your faith is stronger than any
[1:18:03] faith I've ever seen and anybody in my
[1:18:05] life
[1:18:07] there's your blessings
[1:18:09] she said it she said it's almost like
[1:18:12] we're celebrities
[1:18:14] and she didn't mean that in a in a
[1:18:16] boisterous way but she said people we
[1:18:18] don't even know come up and they are
[1:18:21] inspired by our level of faith and our
[1:18:24] desire to hold on and to believe that
[1:18:27] through this greatest obstacle my son is
[1:18:29] going to walk out of this hospital and
[1:18:31] he's going to eat and drink again
[1:18:34] God has heard her cries
[1:18:37] she laid her burden down she said I
[1:18:39] could never have done this on my own she
[1:18:41] said it was too much for me to bear I
[1:18:44] had to take it to God
[1:18:49] she goes up to Mayo Clinic
[1:18:52] things go disarray he can't breathe he's
[1:18:56] choking
[1:18:57] she runs two three blocks
[1:19:02] to get to him
[1:19:06] she's by herself
[1:19:09] I think
[1:19:10] God somebody had laid it on their heart
[1:19:11] to send some people up the ethics my
[1:19:13] sister-in-law Sarah and her mom went
[1:19:17] but she was bearing this all alone
[1:19:23] how good is God
[1:19:25] when you think about this overcoming
[1:19:27] obstacle
[1:19:29] and for her to come through it and say
[1:19:30] and admit there's no way
[1:19:34] I could do this by myself
[1:19:37] it was only God
[1:19:42] that's what you call taking your problem
[1:19:44] to the problem solver
[1:19:50] some people believe that
[1:19:52] if you have problems in life
[1:19:54] it's because you don't have enough Faith
[1:19:56] or you're not living right they say you
[1:19:59] know you you get stronger Faith you get
[1:20:01] less problems you'll have and the closer
[1:20:03] you get to Christ the less you'll have
[1:20:05] to overcome
[1:20:07] it didn't work that way for me
[1:20:11] the closer I got the harder it got
[1:20:15] the more faith I had the more more times
[1:20:17] I had to put into action
[1:20:22] Paul says we're all given a Measure of
[1:20:25] Faith
[1:20:27] not that this person's as greater or
[1:20:29] that it puts us all on an equal playing
[1:20:31] field
[1:20:32] each person has a Measure of Faith
[1:20:35] the challenge comes for us as Believers
[1:20:37] when we take that Measure of Faith hey
[1:20:40] what do we do with it
[1:20:43] and it gets
[1:20:44] stronger and stronger and stronger or do
[1:20:47] we just kind of let it go back to the to
[1:20:49] the Wayside there
[1:20:51] and just kind of let it dwindle away and
[1:20:54] watch it just wither away
[1:20:58] it's what you do with your faith
[1:21:00] how do you build that Faith it's when
[1:21:02] you come through challenges
[1:21:05] and you come up to that roadblock you
[1:21:07] come up to that challenge it's how
[1:21:10] you handle it
[1:21:12] do you say I'm not going to worry about
[1:21:15] this I'm going to give it to God
[1:21:19] or you say I'll never overcome this
[1:21:22] there's no need in trying
[1:21:25] you see the difference
[1:21:27] it's all in the verbiage of one sentence
[1:21:28] it's how you approach the problem
[1:21:33] nobody had greater Faith than those
[1:21:34] people that received the Holy Spirit on
[1:21:37] the Pentecost
[1:21:39] but if you look back at the lives of
[1:21:40] them they suffered Untold persecutions
[1:21:44] you look at Paul you look at the
[1:21:45] problems that Paul had
[1:21:47] it wasn't because he didn't have faith
[1:21:50] it wasn't because he was not a Believer
[1:21:52] but God used these trials in Paul's life
[1:21:56] to mold him and
[1:21:58] to be in a
[1:21:59] willing believer and be a stronger
[1:22:01] believer so that he could take the
[1:22:03] message of his hour to the gentile
[1:22:06] people that they could see Christ as a
[1:22:09] savior
[1:22:11] laughs
[1:22:13] many times though we see people that
[1:22:16] they want the blessings
[1:22:18] but they're not willing to Bear the
[1:22:20] burdens
[1:22:21] they're not willing to go the extra mile
[1:22:24] they want the success they want the fame
[1:22:26] they want the riches they want the
[1:22:27] notoriety they want everything but they
[1:22:29] don't want to quite work to get there
[1:22:33] and it's not just in a spiritual you
[1:22:34] know I thought a great type here was
[1:22:36] when I uh I'm thinking about some of
[1:22:38] these pro athletes
[1:22:39] in the natural side everybody wants what
[1:22:42] they got
[1:22:44] you take Tom Brady anybody ever heard of
[1:22:46] him
[1:22:47] okay I'm just making sure
[1:22:52] Tom Brady's been to 10 Super Bowls
[1:22:55] he's got seven championship rings
[1:22:57] five Super Bowl MVP titles
[1:23:00] it's worth over 250 million dollars
[1:23:02] makes 30 million dollars a year
[1:23:05] has over 245 regular season wins 35
[1:23:09] postseason wins for more than 280 season
[1:23:12] wins more than any quarterback in
[1:23:15] history
[1:23:17] but you know what I watched his
[1:23:19] documentary and you know what one of his
[1:23:20] teammates said about him
[1:23:22] he said he's the most hated quarterback
[1:23:24] in history
[1:23:28] you know why he's the most hated
[1:23:29] quarterback in history
[1:23:31] this man said us linemen out there in
[1:23:34] full paths and at a hundred and
[1:23:36] something degrees and we're out there
[1:23:38] practicing for six hours and he's over
[1:23:40] there with no pads on just making passes
[1:23:43] making passes and then when practice is
[1:23:45] over Coach calls practice he says come
[1:23:47] on boys we're going to run plays for
[1:23:48] another two hours
[1:23:53] his work ethics are unheard of his High
[1:23:57] School coaches his car the college the
[1:24:01] college coaches I think it was that was
[1:24:02] mentioning to talk about it said his
[1:24:04] dedication and his work ethics are
[1:24:06] unheard of
[1:24:07] he's willing to put in the time and the
[1:24:09] effort and he's willing to Bear the
[1:24:11] burden that it took to be the best that
[1:24:14] there ever was
[1:24:18] it's the same thing in our Christian
[1:24:20] walk
[1:24:21] are we willing to Bear the burdens that
[1:24:23] it takes to say God I'm an overcomer
[1:24:27] David God I will not be defeated by
[1:24:30] Satan
[1:24:31] are we willing to put in the burden of
[1:24:33] time the prayer the effort
[1:24:37] Paul was one of the most important
[1:24:39] leaders of his day
[1:24:41] he like I said he was going to take the
[1:24:42] gospel to the Gentile church he had a
[1:24:45] purpose and a calling and he was going
[1:24:47] to go back there and he was going to
[1:24:48] take the word at a time when people were
[1:24:50] deviating away from the word
[1:24:53] they were trying to go a different
[1:24:54] direction and Paul comes around he
[1:24:56] begins to to go against the false
[1:24:58] teachers he's bearing the burden of of
[1:25:01] false teachings and he's going in there
[1:25:04] he's confounding these false teachers
[1:25:06] and Paul puts it upon himself he writes
[1:25:08] over one-third of the New Testament
[1:25:11] he'd have a MacBook Pro
[1:25:16] he didn't have office suite
[1:25:19] no
[1:25:20] he had a quill and an ink and some
[1:25:23] parchment
[1:25:25] and maybe he's chiseled on a few Stones
[1:25:27] here or there whatever he could find to
[1:25:28] make his notes and to write the New
[1:25:30] Testament you talking about a burden but
[1:25:32] Paul lived for God
[1:25:34] through all the challenges
[1:25:38] God's greatest Saints through history
[1:25:40] face big challenges Moses David Daniel
[1:25:45] God's chosen people
[1:25:48] face challenges
[1:25:52] the Bride of Jesus Christ is going to
[1:25:54] face challenges
[1:25:57] the preachers around this message are
[1:25:58] going to face challenges
[1:26:01] they're going to face burdens
[1:26:05] and I tell you what
[1:26:08] anybody that wants to preach you've lost
[1:26:10] your mind
[1:26:13] because it's a burden
[1:26:15] it's a it's a burden that's almost
[1:26:17] without God unbearable to bear
[1:26:20] because you're standing here and you're
[1:26:22] handling the word of God and you're
[1:26:24] handling the people of God
[1:26:26] the very bride of Jesus Christ his
[1:26:29] lovely bride and you're handling the
[1:26:31] word and you're trying to help in your
[1:26:32] church but you just hope and pray that
[1:26:34] you don't say one wrong thing
[1:26:39] because you don't want to discourage you
[1:26:42] don't want to diss track you don't want
[1:26:44] to knock anybody off of their path but
[1:26:46] you're trying you're with all your
[1:26:48] effort to get there and that is a burden
[1:26:49] that is so hard to bear
[1:26:54] and like I said you can't really preach
[1:26:56] till you've been through fire
[1:26:59] so life is not always easy for the
[1:27:01] preacher
[1:27:04] I've seen my wife suffer much
[1:27:07] for me
[1:27:10] I've seen my children suffer much for me
[1:27:13] brother Byler has seen his family suffer
[1:27:15] much
[1:27:17] because of him
[1:27:19] because of what God called him to be
[1:27:22] but it is a burden that we bear for
[1:27:25] God's Kingdom
[1:27:28] thank you
[1:27:31] to succeed in our Christian lives we
[1:27:33] must be able to be Overcomers
[1:27:41] Paul's facing these challenges
[1:27:45] just look in the Corinthians second
[1:27:48] Corinthians 4 6 10 and 11. read through
[1:27:51] those chapters
[1:27:54] Paul was perplexed persecuted struck
[1:27:56] down delivered for death
[1:27:58] put in prison faced rice
[1:28:01] nights without sleep hungry thirsty no
[1:28:04] clothes to wear
[1:28:06] he got cold to wear
[1:28:09] he was slandered he was sad he was
[1:28:11] lonely he was whipped as punishment by
[1:28:13] the Jews five different times
[1:28:16] he was beaten with sticks three times he
[1:28:18] was stoned and left for dead he was
[1:28:20] Shipwrecked three times
[1:28:22] he was left floundering in the ocean for
[1:28:24] 24 hours he faced robbers his friends
[1:28:27] left him
[1:28:28] oh
[1:28:30] some of the churches he founded rejected
[1:28:33] him
[1:28:34] his converts backslid
[1:28:37] and went back out into the world
[1:28:40] and we think we've got burdens
[1:28:44] but it says somehow he was over to able
[1:28:47] to overcome all of those obstacles
[1:28:51] how does how was he able to do that
[1:28:54] Paul didn't find it in his own self
[1:28:57] he never did himself and said I'm going
[1:28:59] to make it through this
[1:29:00] you look at the life of Paul and read
[1:29:02] his readings and you begin to look and
[1:29:04] he relied upon the supernatural power of
[1:29:06] God
[1:29:08] the challenges we Face will probably
[1:29:10] never be on the level of what Paul went
[1:29:12] through or those those former Heroes of
[1:29:14] the word of the faith
[1:29:16] but yet we're going to have challenges
[1:29:17] and how are we going to get through them
[1:29:18] just like Paul did relying upon the
[1:29:21] supernatural power of God Almighty Paul
[1:29:25] was so confident brothers and sisters
[1:29:27] and the power of the Holy Ghost that it
[1:29:29] says he took pleasure in the challenges
[1:29:33] listen now took pleasure in the
[1:29:35] challenges for the sake of Christ
[1:29:40] pleasure
[1:29:41] he but how how does a man take pleasure
[1:29:44] when those challenges come how does he
[1:29:46] do that because he knew that the power
[1:29:48] of God would manifest itself and every
[1:29:51] time he went through a challenge God was
[1:29:53] manifest every time trials came God was
[1:29:57] manifest
[1:30:00] Paul prayed and he said I'm anxious for
[1:30:03] nothing but in everything I'll be in
[1:30:05] prayer and supplication I'm going to let
[1:30:07] my requests be known
[1:30:09] to God
[1:30:13] Paul cast his burdens
[1:30:16] on the Lord
[1:30:18] he said cast your burdens on the Lord
[1:30:19] and He will sustain you
[1:30:25] say that's easy to say
[1:30:29] you don't get the answer you're looking
[1:30:31] for it's not that easy
[1:30:34] but Paul says you know you ever get that
[1:30:37] way sometimes you get in a trial in life
[1:30:39] and you're burden and you pray and you
[1:30:40] pray and you think you know how it's
[1:30:42] going to work out and you're getting
[1:30:43] excited and man this is all fixing to
[1:30:45] fall into place just like I wanted to
[1:30:47] and then
[1:30:49] uh not so much
[1:30:55] but Paul kept taking it
[1:30:58] finding pleasure taking it casting his
[1:31:02] cares
[1:31:04] how was he able to do that
[1:31:06] he relied on scripture and it said all
[1:31:10] things
[1:31:11] work
[1:31:12] do good
[1:31:17] it don't matter if it's the outcome you
[1:31:19] were looking for
[1:31:20] I've went through many things in my life
[1:31:22] that the outcome wasn't nowhere near
[1:31:24] what I was looking for
[1:31:26] but it worked out to the good
[1:31:33] no matter what the devil
[1:31:35] throws out at us God could turn us
[1:31:37] around to the good Jesus is not he's not
[1:31:41] uh he's not upset when demons come
[1:31:44] knocking on our door and trying to to
[1:31:45] get us to fall
[1:31:47] Jesus that doesn't intimidate Jesus
[1:31:50] it didn't intimidate Paul
[1:31:53] Paul didn't even dwell on those things
[1:31:54] the Bible says that Paul said we should
[1:31:56] fill our minds with positive thoughts
[1:31:58] from God think on the good things about
[1:32:00] God the noble things the positive things
[1:32:02] worthy things
[1:32:04] that's what Paul said he didn't say
[1:32:06] dwell down here in the gutters where
[1:32:07] things are no good
[1:32:09] and he's writing that in a prison
[1:32:14] unjustly accused
[1:32:18] Paul shows how we can overcome these
[1:32:21] challenges
[1:32:23] and brothers and sisters I want you to
[1:32:25] know we're drawing from an inexhaustible
[1:32:27] Fountain of strength
[1:32:36] I should have had some amens to hear to
[1:32:39] hear y'all right now you think I said El
[1:32:40] Cheapo
[1:32:45] a sufficient one the one who is more
[1:32:49] than enough
[1:32:52] he didn't say here's you a little bit
[1:32:54] and this will get you through he said
[1:32:55] here's your son and here's your son and
[1:32:58] here's you some because I'm the god of
[1:33:00] more than enough I've got more than you
[1:33:02] could ever spend I've got more than you
[1:33:04] could ever give away I'm the god of
[1:33:06] enough
[1:33:09] foreign
[1:33:10] we don't like these challenges
[1:33:14] you ever heard the story of the giraffe
[1:33:17] the mother giraffe her hindquarters
[1:33:20] probably standing around 12 to 14 foot
[1:33:22] tall
[1:33:25] it is another giraffe well she gets
[1:33:27] ready to give birth to a baby
[1:33:29] this is the this is the process that
[1:33:31] happens
[1:33:32] this baby begins to make its Journey
[1:33:34] Down the birth canal
[1:33:36] and this mama giraffe begins to fill
[1:33:39] this taken place
[1:33:41] she doesn't go into the jungle and try
[1:33:43] to find some soft padded bushes or
[1:33:46] somewhere she goes out into the very
[1:33:48] open
[1:33:49] out into the Prairie out into the very
[1:33:51] flat Dusty dirt
[1:33:54] and this baby comes out of the canal and
[1:33:57] it falls to the Earth
[1:34:00] 10 to 12 foot
[1:34:02] welcome to the world
[1:34:10] it's not soft
[1:34:12] it's hard
[1:34:14] it's Rocky it's sticky it's dusty it's
[1:34:18] nasty
[1:34:19] and this little baby's laying there with
[1:34:21] his legs all curled up under it
[1:34:24] and this mother will go over to this
[1:34:26] little baby giraffe that just took the
[1:34:27] tumble of his life
[1:34:30] staring over top of it and kick it
[1:34:34] as hard as she can kick it
[1:34:37] and this little giraffe is sitting there
[1:34:39] and these big long eight foot legs are
[1:34:42] thrusting into this baby giraffe and
[1:34:45] it's rolling and tumbling and rolling
[1:34:47] and tumbling
[1:34:49] and if it don't get up she goes over
[1:34:52] kicks it again
[1:34:57] if this baby doesn't stand up
[1:35:00] she'll kick it again
[1:35:02] and again and again and this baby and
[1:35:05] this will happen over and over and over
[1:35:06] until this baby finally stands up and
[1:35:08] you know what happens
[1:35:10] you got it she kicks him down again
[1:35:15] she is training she's not doing this
[1:35:18] because she's an unfit mother
[1:35:20] she's not doing this because because
[1:35:22] she's not happy because she doesn't love
[1:35:24] this baby
[1:35:25] she's doing quite the contrary she's
[1:35:28] doing it because she loves this baby
[1:35:29] because if this baby does not learn how
[1:35:32] to stand up and get on them big long
[1:35:33] spindly legs it will never outrun the
[1:35:36] line that's chasing its heels
[1:35:39] God sometimes has to let us fall flat on
[1:35:42] our face
[1:35:45] then allow somebody to kick us when
[1:35:47] we're down
[1:35:49] we don't like it let me tell you that
[1:35:51] little giraffe don't like it
[1:35:54] but he knows mama loves me and I'm going
[1:35:57] to tell you God let you fall on your
[1:35:59] face and let you get kicked and let you
[1:36:00] get bruised and let you get beaten
[1:36:02] because God loves you
[1:36:08] you know experience is the best teacher
[1:36:13] best school I ever had was a School of
[1:36:16] Hard Knocks
[1:36:18] you don't forget them
[1:36:21] I don't know who said that but praise
[1:36:23] the Lord
[1:36:24] you don't forget them
[1:36:26] those those kinds of days they begin to
[1:36:29] build up and you remember and you don't
[1:36:32] forget them because when you get through
[1:36:33] those trials you know who you had to
[1:36:35] depend on
[1:36:42] and let me tell you if you don't pass
[1:36:44] the test
[1:36:47] thank you brother
[1:36:50] you'll take it again
[1:36:55] boy God sometimes has a sense of humor
[1:37:00] on me
[1:37:05] I've told you stories where I lose my
[1:37:07] cool at referees
[1:37:09] in ball games my kids are playing they
[1:37:12] get treated unjustly of course you know
[1:37:14] it's always that way
[1:37:17] and you holler and you scream and you
[1:37:19] get mad
[1:37:20] I've had to take that test over
[1:37:24] and over
[1:37:26] and I I finally got the feeling pretty
[1:37:28] good
[1:37:28] I didn't let it get the best of me much
[1:37:30] anymore
[1:37:32] but here you have the same test
[1:37:34] different day different person
[1:37:38] God knows you can handle it

[1:38:00] has held the whole course up so we know
[1:38:01] this is going to be a long day that's
[1:38:03] not fun
[1:38:04] go to the third hole with par three
[1:38:08] all right we all hit our balls none of
[1:38:10] us hit the green it was a pretty tough
[1:38:11] course

[1:38:15] supposed to drive around the greens on
[1:38:17] par threes okay you're just you're
[1:38:19] supposed to stay on the cart path they
[1:38:20] call it so we go on the little golf
[1:38:22] carts
[1:38:23] I'm trying to speed the day up people's
[1:38:25] waiting behind us
[1:38:27] I tell Western I say my balls over there
[1:38:29] just cut across here let's let's get
[1:38:31] over here and get get out of the way

[1:38:37] Joyce and Carson's playing together
[1:38:38] getting ready to hit my ball
[1:38:40] walking up and some guy yells from the
[1:38:43] top of his lungs behind me
[1:38:45] get your card out of the Fairway
[1:38:52] okay
[1:38:55] do you work here
[1:38:59] then with some four letter words back at
[1:39:01] me
[1:39:03] he let me be known he didn't work there
[1:39:05] and it didn't matter if he did or not
[1:39:10] so now I'm trying to put and my hands

[1:39:38] just play
[1:39:39] I hit my drive I tried to kill a car I
[1:39:41] was trying to get the frustration out
[1:39:43] you know I it went right that's just
[1:39:45] compounds for the frustration
[1:39:50] so we're driving down the Fairway
[1:39:53] I thought what am I to do
[1:39:57] what am I to do
[1:39:59] and they just dawned on me what would
[1:40:01] Jesus do
[1:40:03] well it wasn't what I was planning on
[1:40:05] doing
[1:40:09] so we finished a hole and I tell Wes and
[1:40:11] I said turn around we're going we're
[1:40:12] going to sing
[1:40:15] he turned that thing around no he he
[1:40:17] didn't know what was fixing to happen
[1:40:18] but
[1:40:20] we get up there I pull up this one guy I
[1:40:23] say was you holding at me back there
[1:40:25] wasn't me but
[1:40:28] he's like
[1:40:29] I ain't got nothing to do with this is
[1:40:31] that guy right up oh good
[1:40:33] he drove on so we went over this guy and
[1:40:36] In the Flesh it was kind of funny
[1:40:39] because this guy was looking for a ball
[1:40:41] that he lost
[1:40:42] and he wasn't nowhere knew here a cart a
[1:40:46] club
[1:40:47] a ball he couldn't throw a shoe at us
[1:40:51] if we was going after him
[1:40:54] I step out of the car at West the Spells
[1:40:56] up steps out behind me
[1:40:59] That's my boy
[1:41:03] I walk up to him I said I want to tell
[1:41:04] you something
[1:41:06] and he's looking at me and he's he's
[1:41:08] kind of got not a pretty face
[1:41:10] and he's looking at my house said first
[1:41:12] of all I'm a Christian
[1:41:15] well that set him back a little bit
[1:41:17] I said as a Christian I don't appreciate
[1:41:19] you hollering at me
[1:41:21] in front of everybody to try to fix a
[1:41:23] problem that's not really yours to fix
[1:41:26] I said second of all I don't appreciate
[1:41:28] you cussing at me and my family and my
[1:41:30] wife who are Christians
[1:41:32] he said I apologize I said have a nice
[1:41:35] day
[1:41:44] I don't want to take that test no more
[1:41:45] I'm done with that test
[1:41:49] but we will have to take tests over and
[1:41:52] over and over until you overcome it
[1:41:57] I was telling my friend Daryl about who
[1:41:59] Pastors in Hopkinsville Baptist preacher
[1:42:01] and I was telling him about it and
[1:42:03] telling him what the what the what had
[1:42:05] happened there and he said you know if
[1:42:07] he said the greatest thing about it is
[1:42:09] the blessings that come with that
[1:42:12] because when we went back up Carson and
[1:42:15] Joyce was up I didn't let them come down
[1:42:16] there so Carson he was already you know
[1:42:19] he was chomping he wouldn't know what
[1:42:21] was going on what happened what happened
[1:42:22] what happened
[1:42:23] and Weston looks at him and says it was
[1:42:25] handled appropriately
[1:42:29] that's a blessed
[1:42:32] because you know I could have gotten
[1:42:33] really mad
[1:42:35] I could have let the temper get the best
[1:42:37] of me and I could have took a seminar
[1:42:39] bear and raped
[1:42:40] his teeth out
[1:42:42] and I would have been in jail and my son
[1:42:45] would have probably been in jail
[1:42:48] but I bared
[1:42:50] swallowed my pride
[1:42:52] and just let him know hey God's people
[1:42:54] shouldn't be talked to this way
[1:42:57] have a nice day
[1:43:01] foreign
[1:43:05] we think that our burdens he said I
[1:43:08] might inject this right here we think
[1:43:10] our burns are so heavy sometimes that
[1:43:12] there's nothing like it in the world
[1:43:15] you all know those people are y'all do
[1:43:18] you know all those things are good for
[1:43:20] you they're demoed you to make you
[1:43:22] prophets and sages was molded on the
[1:43:24] backside of the desert in the hot
[1:43:25] blazing sun through tribulations Trials
[1:43:27] of persecutions and these things that we
[1:43:30] have today here's nothing happened to us
[1:43:32] that hasn't happened to other Christians
[1:43:37] sometimes we think we're secluded
[1:43:39] because we're the bride but we're
[1:43:40] Christians that things have happened
[1:43:42] he said other Christians have had to
[1:43:44] stand in the hour of Darkness like this
[1:43:46] be fed to the Lions for their testimony
[1:43:50] hmm
[1:43:54] I'm going to read or just go through a
[1:43:55] portion of scripture here I've got two
[1:43:57] more little scenarios and I'm going to
[1:43:58] try to get get through these
[1:44:00] Mark chapter six we look at Jesus
[1:44:03] and Jesus says just come down and and
[1:44:06] he's ready to move on and he's getting
[1:44:08] ready to move and by that time the
[1:44:10] multitude of people come down and they
[1:44:12] see him and they know who he is and he
[1:44:13] had so much compassion on those people
[1:44:15] the burden he had for him he said we got
[1:44:17] to stop here and we got to teach because
[1:44:19] these people are like sheep without a
[1:44:21] Shepherd they need to hear the word of
[1:44:22] God
[1:44:23] and he sits down there and he begins to
[1:44:26] uh uh look at this and the disciples are
[1:44:28] looking at him and they say Lord
[1:44:31] you know we're far spent this is a
[1:44:34] desert place and now time is far past
[1:44:38] in other words his disciples are telling
[1:44:40] him Lord
[1:44:42] there is no restaurants around here and
[1:44:43] you've preached past 12 30.
[1:44:46] the people are tired
[1:44:48] the people are weary the people are
[1:44:50] starting to fall out and I want you to
[1:44:53] look at what a burden this was
[1:44:55] we don't hear this side of the story We
[1:44:57] very rarely go tomorrow Mark we always
[1:44:59] read Matthew but listen to what Mark
[1:45:01] Mark is a good Storyteller he gives
[1:45:03] details
[1:45:04] and he says
[1:45:06] they say should we go into the country
[1:45:08] and shall we go to buy 200 penny worth
[1:45:10] of bread to give them to eat
[1:45:13] that's ten thousand dollars worth of
[1:45:15] bread today
[1:45:20] think of the burden
[1:45:21] now we're starting to put this picture
[1:45:22] into into into reality
[1:45:25] should we go take ten thousand dollars
[1:45:27] and go buy enough rolls to feed these
[1:45:30] people because they're passing out
[1:45:31] everywhere Lord
[1:45:32] and he says well how much do we have
[1:45:35] we got Five Loaves and two fishes
[1:45:40] now watch what he says
[1:45:42] go make them all set down by companies
[1:45:44] on the Green Grass and they sat down in
[1:45:46] ranks by hundreds and 50s
[1:45:49] how would you like to have been the
[1:45:50] person sitting there five thousand men
[1:45:52] five thousand women figure two children
[1:45:54] a piece that's twenty thousand people
[1:45:56] and I'm gonna need you to count to 50.
[1:45:58] when you get to 50 you get in this group
[1:46:01] one two three four five six seven eight
[1:46:03] nine forty five forty six one two three
[1:46:06] four five six
[1:46:08] twenty thousand people have to be
[1:46:10] counted out into groups of one hundred
[1:46:12] and into groups of fifty before they
[1:46:14] ever begin to divide the fish and the
[1:46:16] bread
[1:46:17] do you see the magnitude of this burden
[1:46:19] it's getting big it's getting big and so
[1:46:22] he sits in there and and after that he
[1:46:24] takes him he breaks the loaves
[1:46:28] he's breaking the burden
[1:46:32] just a few loaves
[1:46:33] and he's breaking this bread and he
[1:46:35] begins to give it out and they're eating
[1:46:37] and they're they're having a good time
[1:46:38] they're getting replenished or
[1:46:40] re-nourished
[1:46:42] and that's what they did eat and were
[1:46:44] filled it says they took up 12 baskets
[1:46:47] of fragments
[1:46:51] that 20 000 roughly people
[1:46:54] it took up 12 baskets what a burden
[1:47:00] well Watch What Happens
[1:47:02] and straight away he constrained his
[1:47:04] disciples
[1:47:06] they were filled they're full get in the
[1:47:08] ship we're leaving take the baskets get
[1:47:10] in the ship we're leaving
[1:47:11] and they began to go out onto the sea
[1:47:14] well what happens at night the sea gets
[1:47:16] boisterous Jesus goes off on a Hillside
[1:47:18] and he's over praying and having a long
[1:47:20] time
[1:47:21] and the Sea gets boisterous and it's
[1:47:23] being tossed and it says he looks out
[1:47:25] there and he sees him rowing against the
[1:47:26] waves and they're trying to save the
[1:47:28] ship and he goes walking across the
[1:47:30] water at him
[1:47:33] and it says he was going to pass them by
[1:47:37] he's going to pass them by
[1:47:40] why would he pass them by
[1:47:42] because he knew they should know what
[1:47:44] was rightfully theirs
[1:47:46] they just saw the biggest burden and
[1:47:48] Miracle of their life performed
[1:47:52] and he's over been telling them over and
[1:47:54] over this is for you this is for you
[1:47:55] this is for you
[1:47:58] and can you imagine when they see him
[1:47:59] and call out to him and he steps back in
[1:48:01] the ship
[1:48:03] I don't imagine he had to say a whole
[1:48:04] lot
[1:48:05] but I would say he probably looked at
[1:48:07] that basket and done just like this
[1:48:16] you brethren
[1:48:18] just watch the greatest miracle that
[1:48:21] you've ever seen in your life
[1:48:24] we just had 5 000 20 000 people with a
[1:48:27] few couple of fishes and some loaves of
[1:48:29] bread
[1:48:31] the biggest outpouring of miracle that
[1:48:35] you could ever Witness
[1:48:37] and you don't have faith
[1:48:39] to make it across this water
[1:48:44] and it says when they when they looked
[1:48:46] at that and in the miracle of the Loaves
[1:48:48] and the fishes were brought back to them
[1:48:50] their hearts were hardened
[1:48:53] because they knew
[1:48:56] how could we not believe
[1:48:59] [Music]
[1:49:04] The Greatest Story
[1:49:06] I'm going to get closing with this
[1:49:09] the greatest story of betrayal and
[1:49:11] torture and trial and sentence and
[1:49:13] execution
[1:49:15] is the story of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:49:21] but in the background
[1:49:23] of all of this is happening
[1:49:26] God mentions a man named Simon
[1:49:31] this is not just for a historical
[1:49:33] reference this is not just a benefit to
[1:49:36] go throw into the Bible but God is
[1:49:38] wanting to make sure that this man gets
[1:49:39] credit
[1:49:40] you're going to like this listen close
[1:49:42] from that give me 10 minutes and pay
[1:49:44] attention
[1:49:45] he wants to make sure that this man
[1:49:47] Simon gets credit for carrying the cross
[1:49:50] of Jesus
[1:49:55] because with our heavenly father every
[1:49:57] word has purpose
[1:50:00] we look at this man Simon and the
[1:50:02] circumstances surrounding the cross it's
[1:50:04] a time of execution it's also the time
[1:50:07] of the Jewish feasts and Passover and
[1:50:09] they're they're celebrating the Angels
[1:50:11] passing over back in and Moses's time
[1:50:14] that's what the Passover is they're
[1:50:15] celebrating the the death angel passing
[1:50:18] through and them all making it through
[1:50:19] under the token of the blood so now
[1:50:21] Jesus is here
[1:50:23] and this was an annual Feast that was
[1:50:25] called that called the Jews back to
[1:50:27] Jerusalem at that time
[1:50:29] and so this event Drew Simon of Cyrene
[1:50:32] and his two sons Rufus and Alexander all
[1:50:36] the way back to Jerusalem
[1:50:44] they wasn't there to witness how people
[1:50:46] were tortured
[1:50:48] they knew nothing of Jesus
[1:50:52] they knew nothing of his execution
[1:50:54] coming they're there to celebrate the
[1:50:56] Passover
[1:51:00] but by the powers of this evil world
[1:51:03] they came face to face with what was
[1:51:06] happening Upon Jesus that day
[1:51:10] they've come upon what the procession
[1:51:12] was of leading to galgotha on that day
[1:51:17] it says that Simon was from Cyrene
[1:51:20] which is in North Africa
[1:51:24] and nobody really knows why he was
[1:51:26] chosen out of this crowd of people
[1:51:29] maybe it was because he was big and
[1:51:31] strong and appeared fit enough to carry
[1:51:33] this cross
[1:51:35] and they knew that they could get him up
[1:51:37] to the streets of galgotha it could have
[1:51:40] been that God wanted Simon and Simon
[1:51:42] alone to carry this burden for Jesus
[1:51:45] but Simon is ordered he didn't have a
[1:51:48] choice in this read the word
[1:51:50] it said he was ordered and constrained
[1:51:52] him Carry the Cross take up that cross
[1:51:56] and all of a sudden
[1:51:59] now he has become the primary role
[1:52:02] player of this execution of Jesus Christ
[1:52:10] I wonder what Simon heard as he walked
[1:52:12] through the crowds of people
[1:52:15] did they talk about the miracles of
[1:52:17] Jesus did they talk about the healings
[1:52:20] he performed did they talk about how
[1:52:22] many he fed or did he hear did he hear
[1:52:24] the sounds of hosanna Hosanna
[1:52:28] did he hear uh the the the snares and
[1:52:31] the smirks from the Pharisees and the
[1:52:33] Sadducees
[1:52:35] their accusations their insults towards
[1:52:37] Jesus
[1:52:39] Simon no doubt heard the women as they
[1:52:43] wailed at the punishment that Jesus
[1:52:46] would went through
[1:52:48] and the torture that he had went through
[1:52:52] so here's now
[1:52:54] Simon
[1:52:56] he had to wonder how he's going to be
[1:52:58] viewed by this divided crowd
[1:53:02] you ever been on a place where you got
[1:53:03] to wonder what's what's this side going
[1:53:05] to think and what's this side going to
[1:53:07] think
[1:53:10] did he wonder what it was going to be
[1:53:12] like did he Wonder as he sit there and
[1:53:14] he think am I helping the Romans am I
[1:53:17] helping these guys and am I helping them
[1:53:19] take him to the Cross just to be an
[1:53:21] executioner or am I here offering
[1:53:24] compassion
[1:53:26] to this man called Christ
[1:53:33] the reason they had to pick you get get
[1:53:35] somebody out of the crowd is because
[1:53:36] Jesus has become so weak
[1:53:39] and so frail and so weary and beaten
[1:53:44] that he wasn't going to make it
[1:53:46] he fell under the weight of this cross
[1:53:49] under the weight of this burden he falls
[1:53:51] down to the cobblestone
[1:53:53] the Romans could
[1:53:55] have that
[1:53:57] it goes back into the book of
[1:53:58] Deuteronomy where it says cursed is
[1:54:01] everyone who is hanged from a tree
[1:54:04] Jesus had to die on that tree to fulfill
[1:54:07] scripture
[1:54:11] and so they say you pick up his cross
[1:54:13] and you bear his cross
[1:54:17] to carry that Roman cross was to be
[1:54:19] identified with death and lawlessness so
[1:54:21] when people get the wrong
[1:54:24] idea about Simon Just An Innocent wrong
[1:54:27] idea about him
[1:54:29] the scene of Madness and horror
[1:54:33] there was no escaping it
[1:54:35] this cross he picked up blood covered
[1:54:38] heavy
[1:54:40] no doubt have been used in executions
[1:54:41] before
[1:54:43] Blood Stained can you imagine the smell
[1:54:46] of death
[1:54:47] as he picked that cross up
[1:54:50] and he begins to carry this cross down
[1:54:52] the Trail of Tears
[1:54:54] and no doubt he's thinking what does all
[1:54:56] of this mean
[1:55:01] arriving now at delgatha
[1:55:06] Simon's burden ends
[1:55:10] coming up to the to the to the cross up
[1:55:13] to the hill of Golgotha Simon there now
[1:55:15] the the Jesus had arrived the suffering
[1:55:18] the burden the sin had now left off of
[1:55:21] Simon and been transferred back to Jesus
[1:55:25] and I can almost see Simon stepping back
[1:55:28] into the crowd with his two sons now
[1:55:32] with relief
[1:55:35] happy to be able to finally lay down the
[1:55:37] burden
[1:55:39] and surrender it to Jesus
[1:55:47] sometimes we grow weary
[1:55:50] we grow weary under our burdens
[1:55:53] but just like Simon we have a place to
[1:55:55] lay those balloons
[1:55:58] at his feet
[1:56:00] Jesus may make you pack the cross
[1:56:03] for a little while
[1:56:04] you may have to go to trials and
[1:56:06] tribulations and troubles and burdens
[1:56:08] but there comes a time when you know
[1:56:09] Simon has to step down and transfer all
[1:56:12] of that weight back onto him
[1:56:15] and say I lay it down at your feet
[1:56:20] I give it to you
[1:56:29] there's a blessing for your burdens
[1:56:33] I'm sure that Simon's Sons were
[1:56:38] amazed at the events that were taking
[1:56:40] place and how their father was called
[1:56:42] out of the crowd and and with the things
[1:56:44] that were being said about Jesus and no
[1:56:46] doubt they probably told their father
[1:56:47] that father father the people many of
[1:56:51] them love thee they say he's he's the
[1:56:52] Messiah he's the promised one he done
[1:56:54] Miracles but these other people there
[1:56:56] they hate him
[1:56:59] and then together they watched as Jesus
[1:57:01] was nailed to the cross
[1:57:05] One By One The Nails pierced his hands
[1:57:15] Passover
[1:57:16] it would forever change
[1:57:18] as God's perfect sacrifice of Jesus
[1:57:21] Christ
[1:57:22] would pay the penalty for all sins
[1:57:28] your sin my sin
[1:57:31] failure you're shortcoming your sickness
[1:57:33] your pain your loneliness your suffering
[1:57:36] your anxiety your fear your doubt
[1:57:40] the list goes on and on and on and on
[1:57:42] and on
[1:57:44] because he's all that you have he's out
[1:57:47] more than enough
[1:57:51] we don't have to no longer be slaves
[1:57:54] as suffering under the death penalty
[1:57:57] that we should have suffered on her
[1:58:01] you say well what was the blessing and
[1:58:03] the burden for Simon
[1:58:06] this is where it's good
[1:58:08] this is where God just began to open
[1:58:10] things up
[1:58:12] what was the blessing for Simon's burden
[1:58:15] carrying that cross
[1:58:17] what was it what could have possibly
[1:58:19] benefited him if you look and you dig
[1:58:21] through scriptures you'll find out that
[1:58:23] it played a big part because Simon of
[1:58:27] serene he would become a Christian
[1:58:30] he would take the very message that he
[1:58:32] saw the very death burial and
[1:58:34] resurrection that he witnessed on that
[1:58:35] day and take it back to Africa
[1:58:38] all right
[1:58:39] and the scriptures talk about in the
[1:58:42] book of Acts and the Epistles when they
[1:58:43] write they talk about Rufus and
[1:58:45] Alexander his sons they're mentioned in
[1:58:48] scripture and you say oh that's just
[1:58:50] coincidence
[1:58:52] glad you said that
[1:58:55] listen to what the prophet said
[1:58:57] years ago
[1:58:59] There Was An Old Rugged Cross down
[1:59:01] through Jerusalem
[1:59:06] and I say it's easy to let me back up
[1:59:07] it's easy to contradict because Scholars
[1:59:09] they can't quite put their finger on it
[1:59:12] they know Rufus and Alexander's
[1:59:14] mentioned and they know that that was
[1:59:15] Simon's kids his boys and they know that
[1:59:19] Mark was writing to that that group of
[1:59:21] people when he calls them out so they
[1:59:22] know there's some ties there but they
[1:59:24] can't quite get it
[1:59:25] we got somebody got it
[1:59:29] he said years ago there was an Old
[1:59:30] Rugged Cross that came down through
[1:59:32] Jerusalem dragging out the footprints of
[1:59:35] the bearer
[1:59:36] on the road up to the hill his little
[1:59:39] frail body fell
[1:59:41] Simon of serene came
[1:59:45] he said he helped him bear the cross
[1:59:47] and he remembers that
[1:59:53] he remembers that
[1:59:55] he knows that
[1:59:58] now I don't know about you
[2:00:01] but if God remembers that
[2:00:04] in 1960 1953
[2:00:08] and it revealed it to the prophet that
[2:00:10] God still remembers that there's a
[2:00:12] special place for silence Irene
[2:00:14] somewhere
[2:00:16] let me take it a step further
[2:00:19] prophets on a Prayer meeting
[2:00:22] he's laying hands on the sick
[2:00:25] Discerning the thoughts the healings are
[2:00:27] taking place and then it comes up and
[2:00:29] there's a blank spot on the tape and
[2:00:31] then he answers he cries out says what
[2:00:33] and she said the Healer so pick it up
[2:00:36] with me now
[2:00:38] say that that man from somewhere up in
[2:00:40] Arkansas that had been healed that
[2:00:41] morning the blind shoe cobbler you know
[2:00:43] the story I've been on the radio and I
[2:00:45] said I thought I'm going to play the
[2:00:47] part of a hypocrite and said you don't
[2:00:49] believe that's the truth do you
[2:00:51] he's talking to this woman
[2:00:53] you don't believe that's the truth she
[2:00:55] said yes sir I do and I said do you
[2:00:57] believe in this day when God would do
[2:00:59] something like that she said sir I
[2:01:02] listened to religious programs I'm a
[2:01:04] Christian I listen to the programs I
[2:01:06] heard that man up there was healed this
[2:01:08] morning that blinds you cobbler they
[2:01:10] throwed him out of church because he was
[2:01:12] making so much noise One Church to the
[2:01:14] other with his hat on his Cane wiggling
[2:01:17] around running up and down churches

[2:01:29] Prophet said do you believe that and she
[2:01:32] stood there a little bit and it was
[2:01:33] drizzling rain and she said sir if
[2:01:35] you'll get me in where he's at then I'll
[2:01:37] I'm my father then I felt about like
[2:01:41] that he said said maybe I'm the one

[2:02:09] listen to what happens here
[2:02:11] he said I put my hands over her eyes and
[2:02:13] I said dear Jesus
[2:02:15] one day an Old Rugged Cross came bumping
[2:02:18] down the street the shoulders with blood
[2:02:20] running down out of them a little frail
[2:02:23] body that was packing it fell under the
[2:02:26] load and a colored man by the name of
[2:02:28] Simon of Cyrene came up picked up the
[2:02:31] cross and helped him bear it I'm sure
[2:02:34] you remember it
[2:02:36] he's praying to God
[2:02:38] I'm sure you remember it father
[2:02:41] and one of his children is standing

[2:02:50] serene one of his children was standing
[2:02:52] right there don't tell me he didn't get
[2:02:54] God don't tell me he didn't get through
[2:02:56] the blessings of that burden the burden
[2:02:58] of carrying that cross saved his entire
[2:03:00] family all the way down into 1953 when
[2:03:04] he said here's one of his daughters
[2:03:07] yeah
[2:03:09] and she said
[2:03:12] glory to God I can see
[2:03:15] glory to God I can see and I said you
[2:03:18] can see she said yes sir he said how
[2:03:20] many lights is it she counted the number
[2:03:21] of Lights in the ceiling said what color

[2:03:24] suit with a yellow tie I can see I'm
[2:03:27] Healed
[2:03:32] there's your blessing Simon
[2:03:35] a great great great great great
[2:03:36] granddaughter who was blind and couldn't
[2:03:39] see
[2:03:40] there's your blessings because God
[2:03:42] remembered it
[2:03:46] as the musicians come
[2:03:49] kept you long enough
[2:04:01] God's good brothers and sisters
[2:04:08] sometimes we get to a place when burdens
[2:04:10] are almost more than we can bear
[2:04:13] foreign
[2:04:15] we're living in we see it more and more
[2:04:17] and more the pressure the stress School
[2:04:19] pressure
[2:04:21] our young people going to schools feel
[2:04:24] the pressure and the burden of this evil
[2:04:27] age we're living in
[2:04:28] your work environments your jobs your
[2:04:30] careers feeling the pressure and the
[2:04:33] burdens of this evil age
[2:04:36] he said the slaves of Egypt the task was
[2:04:38] so great their backs was so sore their
[2:04:40] hearts was broken their cries come
[2:04:42] before God
[2:04:45] you ever felt that way
[2:04:49] you ever feel that way that you're under
[2:04:50] so much at you you just cry out to God
[2:04:55] and he said they cried out to God till
[2:04:57] he was forced into a conference
[2:05:02] sometimes I feel like we don't take our
[2:05:04] burdens
[2:05:06] to a conference before God
[2:05:09] he said there's a way of forcing a
[2:05:11] conference you can do it in your life
[2:05:13] it's you can do it in your life it's a
[2:05:15] showdown the burdens are the people that
[2:05:17] cries were so great to God forced this
[2:05:19] conference when God made that decision
[2:05:21] he said it was already before the
[2:05:23] foundation of the world and he said
[2:05:26] that he said he'd done that and there
[2:05:28] was a man named Moses his servant before
[2:05:30] the foundation who was chosen to deliver
[2:05:32] the people but Moses had failed
[2:05:37] and many times we allow our failures
[2:05:40] to allow us to hold on to burdens
[2:05:44] because we're not adequate
[2:05:46] we're not good enough
[2:05:48] we've fallen short we failed God we're
[2:05:50] not good enough so I can't give this to
[2:05:53] you because I'm not worthy
[2:05:56] Simon wasn't Worthy
[2:05:58] he was just a visitor
[2:06:03] he said that should give us confidence
[2:06:06] when he said that Moses
[2:06:08] had failed God
[2:06:11] he said that should give us confidence
[2:06:13] and courage for us who has failed God we
[2:06:16] still have hopes
[2:06:18] we fail him as a church we fail him as a
[2:06:20] people but let's call a conference
[2:06:24] and talk it over
[2:06:28] let's see what he tells us let's see
[2:06:30] what the decision he'll derive at
[2:06:34] foreign
[2:06:35] if you bow your heads
[2:06:39] if you just play he touched me sister
[2:06:41] Becky
[2:06:43] as we get ready to close the service
[2:06:48] as you're sitting there this is not a
[2:06:52] this is
[2:06:53] not a call for the loss this is not a
[2:06:56] call for healing this is just a call to
[2:06:58] simply asked
[2:07:00] and give you an opportunity to go before
[2:07:02] God
[2:07:04] and say God my life
[2:07:07] has been in turmoil
[2:07:09] I've been holding on to things to
[2:07:11] carrying burdens until I can't carry it
[2:07:14] no more I've carried things over and
[2:07:17] over and over in my life
[2:07:21] and I feel like I'm in a place where
[2:07:23] Jesus was when the cross was just too
[2:07:25] much and he failed he fell over onto
[2:07:28] that Cobblestone Road
[2:07:30] I need a Simon to come my way
[2:07:34] I need a Simon that will come my way
[2:07:39] allow me to lift that cross
[2:07:42] and help me to take that cross
[2:07:46] help me to carry that burden and to lay
[2:07:48] it down
[2:07:49] at Jesus I need to transfer God this
[2:07:53] load that I'm carrying this weight the
[2:07:55] stress this pressure
[2:07:57] I need to transfer it over to the cross
[2:08:01] and Lord no matter what happens no
[2:08:04] matter what the outcome
[2:08:06] is whether I like it whether it whether
[2:08:10] whether I agree with it I'm going to
[2:08:13] accept it
[2:08:15] if there's somebody here this morning
[2:08:18] that feels burdened and pressured and
[2:08:20] you just want to stand to your feet
[2:08:23] do your feet
[2:08:25] and show Jesus
[2:08:27] I've been carrying this long enough
[2:08:31] and I'm gonna stand to my feet and I'm
[2:08:33] going to raise this burden up to you
[2:08:36] and I'm going to let it go
[2:08:38] God bless you God bless you
[2:08:42] it's nothing to be ashamed of but this
[2:08:44] is a time of worship
[2:08:46] this is a time of Deliverance a time of
[2:08:48] Freedom a time to be set free
[2:08:54] because you don't have to carry it
[2:08:57] the burden has been born
[2:09:02] I could buy a head
[2:09:06] a heavy burden
[2:09:08] [Music]
