the brad if he'll come do the bible reading this morning psalms 103. if you would uh i just want to just make mention of a little incident happened yesterday just remember if you would i wasn't going to mention it but something just kept nudging me that you know if you're concerned the lord is concerned so there were about we were at a turn or a ball game yesterday for the boys baseball and and we had like five or six vehicles that were the windows were knocked out and they sold uh billfolds purses uh anything that i guess they could grab so my billfold was stolen joyce's and my parents stuff was stolen so uh but out of the five they probably got away with i don't know two or three maybe two thousand dollars a couple of handguns and those kinds of things but that's that's not you know that's neither here or there but we kind of you know everybody's concerned about their social security cards driver's license all that so just just pray that you know nothing would transpire out of that nobody wants identity theft and stuff like that so just remember that in your prayers in the upcoming days we appreciate it psalms 103 bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases who satisfy my mouth was good good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles he made known his ways unto moses and acts unto the children of israel he will not always chide neither will he keep his anger forever for as the heaven is high above the earth so great is his mercy toward them to fear him like as the father pitteth his children so the lord pitteth them that fear him as for man his days are as grass as a flower of the field so he flourished shall flourishing but the mercy of the lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto the unto children's children the lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens and his kingdom ruleth over all bless the lord bless ye the lord all ye hosts ye ministers of his that do his pleasure all together lord all his works in all places and dominion bless the lord o my soul god bless you this morning i i read

young man who had esophagus cancer had a scan this week and the scan came back he was clear he was cancer-free and sister tina wanted to let everybody know thank you for your prayers and god he's an awesome god let's give the lord a hand to praise this morning amen god is good all the time he puts a song of praise in this heart of mind this morning amen let's sing that if we could oh god is good

the bible and she said yes i have i said the bible says make a joyful noise unto the lord she said well you're doing a good job of it i said well i just do our best you know brother branham said if

goodness and his mercy and i'll tell you i don't deserve his mercy but he is good isn't he amen i want to sing this song this morning it's in the red book uh we shall see the king this morning and

bring back a car he can make someone else do something and we don't we don't limit god to just healing but i believe he knows our every care this morning he knows our hearts desire and we just remember our shut-ins brother parish sister perish this morning and just pray that god will be with him and brother i'll continue to raise him up and sister peggy smith and just remember those that

bring the little ones to amen one more time yes bring them in oh bring them in bring them in from the fields of sin bring them [Music] that's a little miracle right there amen that's a beautiful baby amen let's just buy our heads and go before the lord lord jesus we come before you father and remember many years ago lord jesus when parents would bring their children to you to have you bless them lord jesus and and the disciples perhaps didn't want to do it but you said forbid them not to come unto me and so we believe lord jesus is a cow deals lord jesus they want to bring their child a lydian a father to you this morning we just ask god that as we ask lay our hands upon her lord and ask your blessing upon her lord and her whole life lord father we don't know what the future holds but the age in which we are living in we know that she'll certainly need a special blessing father and i pray up and nurture out in the word of god understanding father children we thank you for this wonderful family lord thank you to a closer walk with you father please first of all i'm the prophet of course it's kyle and so for that buried there's a to how the prophet of god wow i wanna so we have that the eagle dust amen and that's another a big wheels perhaps amen let's just wouldn't do it you know you know it wouldn't do it any good it's about get um spreaders above her wings so did lead them it was just down we met down and went took fuzz you know that means there's more amen our eaglets we're to fly high praise me to god we're not praise be to god we know that brother banham's story his entire end of one of the favorite stories that he ever told is the story of the eagle egg that the farmer got and he put it under a chicken hand his nest because there wasn't enough eggs there to make a full nest and then he put an eagle in underneath under there and amen when as he grew up that eagle of course you can only imagine those chickens when it went to flop in his wings sometimes it probably beat him over the head because it was so much bigger and it also this just comes to my mind you forgive me but i imagine it's a time or two that that eagle began to look at them chickens a little bit different whenever he got hungry you know you know i don't know about you being my brother my sister you look more like dinner to me you know but it was just you know the appetite of that eagle was not the same as the chickens that's the way it is with you and i am we're just not happy in a barn yard now the prophet said you know that barnyard typifies a denomination or just your organized religion organize denominations you know because they believe this and they don't never grow they never expand they put a period behind what they believe and they never can't get any further and man and the devil had them so wrapped up until they were teaching in our age that the days of miracles is passed there's no such thing as the holy ghost all you can eat is worms and whatever you can scratch up well that's not good enough for us eagles was it no amen and whenever listen to them eat the sound just the sound of those chickens and the sound of an eagle is not even to be compared now i don't know about you but whenever a hawk or something like that flies over our chicken yard and then those chickens have a god-given sense to go and duck under something to get some shelter get out get away is that right but i can just imagine that eagle amen being in that same yard amen they heard the hog perhaps you know and they probably just stood there and said you know what is it that y'all are afraid of amen because that eagle has something on the inside amen that tells you tells that ego that it is more and greater and that it doesn't have the fear amen the sound of the hawk amen but it just didn't fit in it just wasn't right that's the way it was out of our life amen maybe went from church to church women amen we was in one party we all come out of a different barnyard amen i'm nobody too but i'm thankful to be out of the barnyard it meant that what brought us out of the barnyard was this word of god it was the great eagle that flew over and when that eagle mama great mama eagle screamed amen and he said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of god that amen that was a rebound that came from the mind you said that sounds right because every church and every person in their denominations they only take so much of it they take what they want of it they interpret how they want to you know how they want to interpret it that's why the women have men's clothes on that's why they're wearing makeup that's why they're cutting their hair that's why all they kind of even preaching the gospel when the bible forbids it amen and so you know you know they just like what they want for for you and i we realize that man shall not live but by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god and that was the very foundation of the prophet of god he says it's time to come back to the word of god to the full word of god amen when i begin to hear sound that's why when you listen to that take amen you hear that sound and you know that is correct praise be to god isn't it something how that um you know how did the after the prophet preach a message and then jesus christ would come down and we would discern the thoughts and the intents of the people and when i was listening to it yesterday he would say you know you're praying for something that's wrong with your side and your back and so forth but you're also praying for somebody else how would he know that but you're also praying for somebody else and so forth and you know and it doesn't matter how much he i said you know the very same thing that jesus did 2 000 years ago if he's the same he'll do the same thing again today he would come and he would do that very thing you know right and people don't realize that is exactly jesus christ amen discerning the thoughts and tense of the heart again amen but this time it is in his church body that he's doing it in it made in a humble little kentucky prophet and that's what stumbles people and you know even though god raised about 11 to 13 people from the dead through the william branham's ministry amen it comes to bear that where remember the rich young ruler that died amen in the bosom of abraham and that rich man died and went to hell he says you know you know somebody they told him if somebody would raise from the dead they would still not believe and that's the way this generation was the people even though people raised from the they still don't believe even on the sign of the messiah then right in front of people they still don't believe and isn't that what abraham told me he says no one raised from the dead they will not believe you can have people raised from the dead people still not complete just stay in your seats aren't you thankful that you're one of the ones that believe i'm glad that the lord helped me open my eyes believe that actually god sent a prophet before the destruction of this world and this world is getting wicked amen it is getting to be a bad place amen now one thing i want to bring out and that is that when when you begin to leave that barnyard you hear that call and you go up on higher that it's about atmosphere how many believes it's about atmosphere living in a different atmosphere a better atmosphere amen not be so earthbound not bound by the cares of life not bound by your bills not mine by this that or the other but come up the higher revelations four after the churches ages remember he says i seen a door open amen and a voice coming out and said come up hither come on up higher that's what we want to do this morning come up higher yeah come up a little higher because i'll tell you what we're going higher and higher and higher until one of these days we're our feet are going to lose gravitation and we're going to lift right up on out of here and that's not a fairy tale i think that's really going to happen i really believe that [Music] i hope you can amen that's right that's what we believe that's what we're looking for it's the eagle age this is the soaring age flying above the age all right already a little ready for a little story me and my wife and uh my grandchildren and granddaughters and then our neighbors kids we were all going to airport and we came on the way from the airport we got stuck in a traffic jam i mean there was a wreck up ahead i guess you know we got in this long way long traffic jam and i says all right hang on kids i'm fixing to put this book and we're going to put out like them jets we're going to put them engines down and we're going to read right up all out of here we're going to fly over all of it oh my god he's a little thick but think about it how many knows we're living in a different power than what we used to live people are still driving horse and buggy isn't that right people are still living in the horse and buggy age and i don't know about you but it's everything's manual huh we've got it so nice now that you can push your butt now you got that nice car yet brother david back there does he says i can push a button it drives for me i i could just spit back you know and drive i told my wife i said you know david has a car he just pushed about to drive and the car was passing us and one of the girls said hey that's one of them cars that just drive themselves boy my wife looked at me bro i'll tell you what don't you ever push no button i'll be having well you're gonna you know you ain't gonna have nobody driving for me i wanna control of my handle my wife that's easy one of them kind you know but you know think about it with the horse and buggy you're still in the wind you're still in the air you're still under the elements when you come to a stop you know you got to take the horse and you got to go over there you got to feed them you got to take care of them you know their people are still living in that age they think they have to do this and they have to do that to earn their salvation and oh you better not do this and you better not do that hello they're stealing the horse and they don't realize that it's not about whether you do this or whether you're not it's better whether you accept what he has done amen whether he has come and did not work in you amen and he has brought you to a place to where no more do you have to do anything manual you we're driving an automatic now not a shift just let the holy ghost drive just let the holy ghost of his free reign this morning oh my didn't you get up into a car amen get into a vehicle amen and you talk to what you can cruise bro you all you gotta do is turn the little key there's your engine cranks right up put it down there you got a gas pedal and a brake in that steering wheel that's all you need right everything else you can leave your thermostat and all your temperature control this out of the other it's a whole lot nicer it's kind of like a person in a justified state hey there god pick him up and they come to church but they still have their upstairs they'll have their downs and when it's raining oh they're down and when the sun's shining they're happy one day we're happy one word and we're still under the elements still in a justified state some day is good some days bad oh my when everything's going good you know praise be to god but everything going well bad wows you as you will be and then people go a little higher people get up in the car and guess what boy priest is kind of nice i'm satisfied i know i'm right with god i'm clean i live right i do right i got my dress right i got my hair right i get to go to church the way i should i do all of everything i feel a lot better technification is a whole lot better place to be amen but they're still not that infilling amen not the baptism of the holy ghost to come down there and to keep you clean amen to give you some fire in there i mean that's what we need is we need the holy ghost and fire burn burn holy spirit burn in me set my soul on fire and praise the lord and that's what we want to be amen not just the car but hey i'll tell you what there ain't no red lights up there in the sky there ain't no traffic jams up there in the sky amen right they're throwing for free amen and not only that but when you get into a plane guess what there's somebody else driving all you do is sit back and enjoy the ride that's what the prophet said that's what we hear we're safe we're secured we're in christ amen and we're just enjoying things until god comes and takes us home how many bees that's how it ought to be just smooth sailing no traffic jams this don't bother you and that don't bother you oh god help everybody on evening lane kavanaugh get to the place to where nothing bothers you not even death doctor says you're going to die for you well praise be to god i'm getting my new body whoa huh i'm going home i'm near home than i was yesterday how many know every breath you take you're closer to home but i'll tell you eagles aren't meant to be bound down praise the lord let's see what jesus said about it you want to do that [Applause] jesus says for us not to be bound be earthbound by the cares of life by the things of the world amen if there's ever a person that was not earthbound it was jesus christ amen he had problems paying his taxes all right he had problems with having a big crowd with nothing to feed him but did he worry no he didn't worry there was a coin and the fish's mouth took care of the taxes hey man when he needed some bread and some fish he said bring that little boy over here with that lunch box and if i understand it right there was somebody that had the audacity to try to tell the public god there was nothing that lunchbox would feed them all boy you must be some kind that well never mind that's right ain't no little box gonna feed 70 or more how many was it even seven thousand five thousand people everybody took that bread he took that fish it meant it every time he reached maybe in that lunchbox there was another piece of fish but we had a fish fry over here i have my wife said i'm not my wife but i had my daughter and i said grab me a few of those i like fish huh i'll bet you that was some good fish amen he bypassed the growing of the fish all of that he was already cooked come on people settle down a little bit here that's the kind of god you serve that when you have a need of something he can make it rather but he can take care of that sure can we can we serve the living god not a dead god not a god of history but a god that is here now a living god oh isn't that awesome [Music] praise the lord that's how he lived and even though we live in an hour of prosperity even though we live in an age of plenty we have more than what we need huh i have more than i need i had that great big old house up in elkton right i went out there and moved in the country and built me a little house forget these big houses huh we was living in there and lived up in the upstairs had our bed there before the walls were even in that's right we had a bunch of little smoke bombs and we climbed up a ladder to get up there and put our mat we loved it out there we had fan we had friends from florida diana and all of them came up here and they'd seen how we were living you know what she told me she said i don't feel a bit sorry for you i said i understand that could be up there living in 2 500 square feet with three big bedrooms and all kinds of three-bath lot but here i am living like this he didn't feel me she knew i could do this we enjoyed it though but we have more than what we need for the most part think about it but you know what i'm trying to say here is what jesus said he says therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink for where with all shall be we be close praise the lord oh let me just stop a minute let me talk to you a little bit about a bird amen flying over people's head and they're talking about an eagle that makes its nest in the cleft of the rock amen and brother bam talk about you know when a bird flies over your head and then he puts thoughts in there amen just let it go right on out just shoot a birdie away get rid of those talks amen because amen david said amen that we ought to meditate upon him day and right night even jesus said lord think be careful about what you think about amen because how many knows that's where the nest is made this is where the womb is to the soul amen and so he says no don't worry about your food don't worry about your clothes and all of that because the devil always tries to get in here if he can get it here he can get in there don't make no nouns don't let them birds make no mess but keep your meditation on the lord blessed is the man whose mind is stayed on thee i still don't like how much i don't think about god how busy i get with things so busy with things i'm getting to the place where i just like my hour or i want to have and just play some good gospel music i like to play oh how many was gospel music it does something for you if you've got the holy ghost and just to bathe in some good music and then read your bible listen to a tape pray have fellowship with god folks if you don't do that enough you need to do it more because it's what gives you your strength it's what renews your youth amen it's a renewing all that other stuff it just drags you down this is the only thing that'll pick you up it'll only give you joy amen you pray for me will but i'll take more time out of my schedule to pray and just to bask in the presence of the lord just to love the lord love him how many knows it how many of us be be honest you need to love the lord more we need to love the lord more amen amen praise be to god so shall we slow down a little let's slow down a little bit blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law does he meditate on sunday morning wednesday night once in a while no day and night your mind amen it's nesting in here you want joy let your mind make a nest right here just nest right here make a nest in the cleft of the rock way high above the badgers and the weasels and the opossums and everything else that can get you and bite you amen in other words if you really want to be blessed do this let your light delight be in the law of the lord and in his law meditate day and night and i tell you what you're going to be like a tree planted by the rivers of water fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper amen all right let's go on let's talk about a kite for a second let's talk about the eagle in the air what puts him up there well when i thought about thought about flying a kite go fly a kite let's fly a kite i did the other day with my grandchildren paul fly a kite with me all right i'll quit what i'm doing and go fly a kite with you but it's a little windy so we might have to put this little what do you call them little hooks that snap on little round u-hooks of some kind some little hook i'm gonna have to put some weight on the tail because i used to love to fly kites when i was a little boy at school and at home loved that legging out there as far as i could and it's a little windy so we're gonna have to put this and another time i'd say look there's no wind so we can't play a kite i mean like you gotta have wind to fly okay why what's gonna happen you gotta run right and who wants to run from the one end of the field to the other to try to get the kite up right how about a boys no but it's nice when there's some wind why because somebody knows that that that kite is designed it's engineered to need wind to take it up higher amen that's the same way with eagle how many notes when there's a little wind that comes along am i right when it comes along it learns it don't have to that's what happens whenever you ain't got no you gotta struggle along the climb huh amen so you think about it the the eagle when he has a little bit of wind what does he do even the buzzard out there how many knows they're always turning and their tails going sideways what are they doing setting their wings and sailing and letting that wind do what amen why because that wind is like trials for us it's like winds things that happen they come our way is that right amen and it'll cause us either to take a towel like it does tighten tightness but if you are balanced right if you balance yourself right that wind is glorious because what if it caused you to climb higher those trials those winds that come our way amen don't play make you stronger take you higher praise be to god bad things the power of god is said that god can put on us is a trial it's a test what out there it's called road rage people shoot each other they go crazy he drives them crazy but not an eagle not a child of gods hello yesterday was a dairy queen it took 20 minutes one customer folks i had done order jeff i had done order and i was in law she apologized to them it was another 20 minutes for the next one hey we were thinking about just driving off yeah i crossed my mind that's yours too yeah i ain't tipping that weight just because she didn't bring me an extra tee man i waited for a long time for my extra treat i almost dried up before my tea i ain't giving no eggs come on you think that too don't mean you ought to do it she's a waiter she's got too much on her and everything else if you maybe you kind of understand where she's coming from maybe you just leave her a little bigger tip say but she really needs it she's got it rough huh but anyway what happens when you get into those places hey when you say well praise god i ain't no rush better every day got nowhere to be i ain't got to be nowhere i'll sit right here i got air conditioning right here let me set this down a little bit lower yeah turn van up a little bit so what are we going to talk about we can fellowship here while we're doing this amen the lord must know that i might need a little patience here huh why because something else is going to come up down the road i'm going to need patience so praise be to god just let it climb up a little higher i mean he's with me let those things actually kill them right we could just a lot of trials that come your way let you hire in christ oh my let those things pick you up let me know man we'd have never heard the story we wouldn't still be preaching about it daniel would have never been exalted the way that he was unless first he overcame a trial the wind that we're gonna throw you in the lion's den it was a strong wind but what did he do he put the god down on his knees he set his wings of faith wings of faith in god huh and he carried him right past those lions right past them into being exalted in the kingdom until they made an image of him and had everybody worshipping his image three hebrew children come along and realize hey it ain't right to worship a prophet i don't care how mighty your prophet is you don't worship the prophet you worship the god of the prophet amen and begin to worship him amen man said i am lest you fall down and worship this image will burn you it was another win there are examples amen of winds that come along that can lift you higher god help me get to the place god help you to get to the place where nothing bothers you [Applause] what i mean by that is the devil can't get you because you're back in christ so far until he can't reach you the only way he'll get to you is to come up up higher where you're at huh he's got to come plumb up there he's got to get saved he got to get the baptism of the holy ghost to get where you're at what did the prophet say would make him then that's right class you're good i would make him your brother whoa huh that's right you say well he ain't my brother now he'll never be safe because he went beyond that isn't that right but think about it it's about how many knows it's really about atmosphere getting up into an atmosphere because let me tell you how many knows this earthly atmosphere is contaminated with devils and evil things and homosexuality and now they want to teach our children in school the history of homosexuality at least that's what i heard it might be gossip i don't know but i wouldn't doubt it huh they want to teach them that you don't really know who you are until you get seven years old then you can decide whether you want to be a boy or girl to seven years old isn't it something the only thing you can say is people's mind is completely gone it's completely gone i don't care who hears this you when you have the mindset that your child at seven years old can make that kind of choice boy there is something seriously deficient about you amen oh my well we'll get off that but it's the truth isn't it that's that's the corruption that's the horrible conditions in the atmosphere that this world is getting in and it's getting worse and it's getting worse and it's getting worse but my question to each and every one of you is what atmosphere are you creating what atmosphere are you living in what is the atmosphere of every one of our homes what is the atmosphere with between the parents and the children because i'll tell you whatever your atmosphere is however high heavenly it is or not is how heavenly or not it will be right in here when you come on in here on a sunday morning when tonight go ahead go ahead amen that's the truth because that's where it counts amen ephesians says that blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ jesus i'll tell you what brother bannon he talked about his times with the lord around running around the tree and shouting i'll tell you what you come up and drive down green ridge spa road amen you stand by this road over there as i'm driving my tractor and my tiller and i've got my headsets on and i'm singing with whoever's singing and i'm not in no low key folks i'm in the top key all right i'm just singing away and singing away and i don't know where i hope that neighbors don't mind but i'm having me a good time in heavenly places in christ jesus so good you hardly know what to do with yourself hello you've heard to say boy if i felt any better he may not need two people to share it with amen that's heavenly i believe that's how many beliefs that's where we need to be in heavenly places in christ jesus but what if i know what if i focus on on the negative things in our life huh i'm going to go ahead and preach is that all right never ask an old person how are you doing huh because they're gonna lie to you because they're doing great not aches and pains and this and that the other hello i know that after a while we can't we can't barely walk we can't bear to get nowhere it ain't no fun you know i can't imagine being real old i'm a little old but i'm not real old but we're all going to get real old the older you get the less fun it is amen the more aches and pains you have but you speak by faith hey i'm fine why because this fight aches the pain because i did you know but even i got the same thing i put my pillow under my leg right here because right there in my left knee man he loves to hurt oh the devil loves to tell me i've got arthritis because your mom had bad arthritis sometimes my finger hurts maybe this hurts my toe will hurt but this mostly because i gotta you know knock to the pills i go that's supposed to help you you know and so forth i wouldn't eat so much of that chocolate ice cream might be better off dude but think about it as we get older why you know you have to create that atmosphere and brother bob says you don't want to be a grouchy old man or a grouchy old woman you meet somebody that's old and that has happiness and man it's cheerful you'd be very glad because we got every reason not to be right amen but what is it it's about climbing higher climbing above those things and then it's just a spear a sphere to where the traffic jams don't bother you anymore the things of the world all your problems don't bother you anymore amen all right i didn't finish matthew did i that's right don't take no thought for with all of wherewithal shall we be close for after all these things do the gentiles seek for here heavenly father knoweth that you have need of these things that's our prayer request this morning i mean he knows everything he can fix anything he knows what you have need of he have a heavenly father to take care of it all amen aren't you thankful for that he says but notice don't take don't don't let your mind dwell on all your needs but let it be here amen let your mind be that you seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness that's where our mind should be am i right with the lord lord what is pleasing to you lord how can i live amen to where your lord it's so dear in my heart that i can say that i do only those things that please my heavenly father amen and all these things shall be added unto you therefore take no thought for tomorrow for tomorrow will take shall take thought for the things of itself sufficiency of the day is the evil thereof praise the lord so climbing higher talking about flight we get up there by the wind that comes on our lives by the wings of faith we get a deeper walk and i can look out at everybody's face this morning and i know what a lot of you went through a lot of us went through a lot of things brother troy remember that bite just a symbol old bug bite absolute torment it can come from a simple thing but praise the god you're here sister robin isn't without you and they're awesome martha and irvin have you yet huh you know thinking about this how good god has given it to us and if you're not if you're not thankful for what you have why don't you just start thinking about closing your eyes and being fanny crosby think about being blind huh not being able to get to the fridge hardly not be able to cook for yourself not being able to think of how horrible it is if god just had you to be blind huh how many knows we can be thankful we praise god for his goodness to us amen when we climb higher what about the downed eagle let's talk about the downed eagle a little bit remember brother demands down the eagle story he was up there hunting and he come across as he he hurt his chatter chatter and he looked there was an eagle down there and the storm actually had knocked that eagle down he got into that storm how many knows he should have rode over the storm but he got in the storm a minute the storm was too much and it knocked that eagle down down into them trees and there he was and he was warming his feather in the sunshine isn't that right oh little now he didn't pay no attention to that spine squirrel and all these other things that were chattering and going on he wasn't worried about that but he said he kept his eye on brother branham because he had a gun right there sitting by that tree and so forth and says i could take this gun and i could shoot you before you could take to the skies but he wasn't worried i'm going to say this just while it comes to mind the one thing that an eagle is is crazy all right they're fearless have you ever seen what eagles will attack coyotes wolves sheep still attack just about anything they ain't afraid hardly of anything eagle is fearless isn't that right why because they know that they have the ability that they need but there he was that eagle was down and it was warm in his feathers it was drying it maybe a trial maybe a test gets you down maybe something you could go through i mean it gets you all the way down on the ground and there you are under the weather and under the weather man you're down on earth you're all managed don't know how you're gonna go on but you begin to spread your wings and say god you delivered me from this god you delivered me from that you did this for me back then i know you're still the same god today and you begin to pray maybe you have fallen short of the glory of god maybe you've sinned amen but just get it under confession put it under the blood and let the sunshine begin to warm you back up again amen and i'll tell you when them for feathers when they go dry when they get dry i mean that eagle shakes his head and get all that heaviness off of it amen if you're a son of god and you get down you get all that weight that extra weight lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beside you and that get that all aside hello getting dried in the wind and a little breeze come through there that man says i'll tell you what that eagle he was ready to fly and if i reach for that gun to get it and swinging around he says that eagle would down through the timbers it would try to hit that right there will you huh he was gone before he could ever got that gun guy because he's got confidence in them wings amen how about you this morning those wings of faith that you have proven and tested in times past if you ever get down amen just put your faith in that praise the lord i believe as we climb into the atmospheres of the holy ghost amen let me tell you something i got to thinking about how that that eagle was down amen it's our business if our brother is down to pick him up amen sometimes we get down we get discouraged we get to the place where we couldn't be and the rest of us we can either criticize that person and push him down in the ground a little more been there done that folks somebody do not be just what you think they ought to be and we have a tendency to just jump on top of them and stomp them down rather than somehow pray for them and lend a hand say hey come on up higher come on up higher don't be discouraged come on up high get out of that you're back sliding what areas come on out of there come on up here come on up higher let's go higher amen if our brother's in the way we'll run right over him if our sister's in the way we will run right over her no if the devil's in the way we will go ahead run right over him that's right there's no redemption for him praise be to god but if our brother our sisters in the way we will pick him up we will stop and pick him up we will stop and pick her up that's what we're about that's what the body of christ is to bring us up into a higher atmosphere into a heavy atmosphere until the holy ghost can come down ain't going to saturate our hearts our life changes from what we are or what we used to be to what we're supposed to be brother bam says i haven't got much hopes for a pastor's church that hasn't got any ambitions to better themselves day by day year by year a church that's really a church of the living god will never stop and say well i just got saved well i'm in the message huh no i guess that's all right that ain't the church of god he's got ambitions to press off i mean believes we've got higher ambitions a real ego has high impatience it swelled on that for a little bit it reminded me of the story but the bam said about how did he had a bomb come to his door he says well where where you know where have you been nowhere where are you going nowhere huh let me tell you that's where our country's at they don't know where they come from and they don't know where they're going they're just sailing just go on somewhere they don't know where they're going they don't know where to come from they don't know what they are what a terrible state to be how was it donna said last i love my wife she'll get on that facebook and she'll forget all the funny ones and laugh all by herself in my time we had wonder woman now they wonder if it's a woman ain't that about the truth i thought that's right on it that's right they wonder they don't even know come on folks that's the pathetic contention the world's in but not you and i i like to know i'm a man that you're a woman hello oh my such a terrible state that the world is in amen but the ambition talk about into this bomb he come and didn't know where he come from he had no ambitions to you know ambushing him better himself i mean there's every in this world even you have to have some ambition some goal that you have to have but then brother and goes on to say he says you know he says it's like driftwood he says you know as you find the stream and there's a lot of driftwood but there's also boats that made out of the same material but it's been crafted it's been shaped it's been formed by the master like i told you last sunday man i would be nothing but dirty driftwood i don't know where i would be i would be as bad as everybody else probably if it wasn't for the fact that the master he may god in his hand and i want him to keep me in his hand i want him to keep shaping me keep powering me giving me form giving me power and strength and if i get in some rubbish pile if i get down into amen the blue so to speak if i get in some rut somewhere amen we have the power to get on my knees and pull myself right back out of there praise be to god i don't got to go to church for that i can do that at home you can do it on the way home you can do it at home wherever you are just get on your knees amen say god i need more of your power i need more of your holy ghost and it'll pull you out of that rut it'll change you from what you are you're we're a privileged people today we ought to be the happiest evening our tabernacle we ought to be the happiest church in this whole area because why should we be because it's there for you if you want it how many believe that it's there for you if you want it if we're not it's our own fault now if it wasn't accessible then it wouldn't be your fault but if it's accessible then it's your fault if you're not all right ambitions high ambitions next thing he talked about on that when he talked about that bummer he talked about how he says you know we're going to end up in a destination someplace we're going to wind up somewhere sometime but you know that god comes in he he he shapes that he forms it he makes it into the image that he's looking for amen and life he said this life amen is a lot higher our ambitions i believe it is uh you know not exact quote but he says you know we ought to have higher ambitions than just getting a big bigger house better house or a better car he said or a television or whatever hello or something better it's something better in life it's we ought to have higher ambitions in all of that praise be to god how many is with me this morning i want to have higher ambitions jesus said your ambitions need to be higher than just your food and your clothes god knows that but your ambitions should be that one of these days god is going to come and we are truly going to fly away from here and what we're doing this morning is getting ready for that time we're preparing ourselves our ambition amen is as the prophet said to better themselves day by day are you better than he was yesterday are you better than he was a week ago a year ago huh yearly monthly year by year he says we should always strive to be better amen more than just home because our truly how many knows our higher ambition is to have a new home an eternal home but we won't have no more gray hair won't get old won't have an ache here and ate there no more sin to deal with no trials no temptations to deal with we're truly looking for our glorified body i mean he's looking for a body james that's truly the ambitions that we should have in colossians paul told them he says if you then be risen with christ seek those things which are below thank you that's right that are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god set your affections on things above and not on things on earth how many we all have affection affection we're all affectionate people our affection is somewhere and our affection is either on the things down here or our affection it's on things above the bible says if you're risen with christ then set your affections on things above we have a much higher ambition eagles have high ambitions way above fussing feuding arguing lying cheating stealing sin doubt fear all the way above all of that folks the holy ghost is way above all of that we're seeking a new body a new home what else are we looking for how many know we actually have such high ambitions that we're looking for a new earth and a new heaven where we're indwelleth righteousness a prophet taught us that death does not change your personality how you are and what you are just don't change you one bit if you're sinner over here you die you'd be a sinner over there you'd have that same nature you'd go wherever the sinners go so think about this because god has created even jesus it says that he ascended the fire above all principality and power and is set in heavenly places you and i are setting in heavenly places in christ jesus so what if he was to die drop dead right now remember whatever atmosphere you're in now but you took your last that the atmosphere you'd be in over there it would either not be of god or it would be heavenly it's quite a thought isn't it you'd either be right before god or you wouldn't be right before god and that's what you and i are working for saying lord that's what we want we want to have in our hearts to where we can honestly know and i believe it was uh the prophet mentioned and i'm not sure if it just which message it was but he talked about the pentecostals and the churches is your present condition he talked about their present condition would it actually be pleasing to the lord if he came right now and that's what we have to ask ourselves every day your presence where you are right now where each one of us is right now is it ready for the coming of the lord it's 10 after 12 with that clock 15 minutes after 12 the rapture is going to take place if i told you that's seven minutes it's going to be all over with how many knows there is a time set there is a time set that is going to happen and the great eagle the prophet eagle that came in our generations took us out of all denominations churches to get us to christ to be in love with the word of god to get a bride that is without spot and it is without wrinkle how did peter say it anymore seeing that all the things shall be dissolved what man are persons are we to be in our holy conversation amen and godliness seeing that you see all these things see that you are spotless and without rebuke at the coming of the lord as a pastor brother i'm talking about a pastor that wants to get his church in the cleft of the rock get you to build your nest in the cleft of the rock how many knows jesus really is the cleft of he's the rock and the cleft of the rock is the cleft that he made right here our hope our faith our everything is in what jesus has done our faith is in jesus christ the revelation of jesus christ everybody needs a revelation of jesus christ don't trust in coming to this church to save you church can't do nothing for you it's as dirty as any denomination that's exactly right there's no cleanness in a church not zero not even a tablet only cleanliness that there is is in jesus christ amen how many knows this is why preacher will say now look how about we all focus on each other's faults we would be a busy busy busy busy people very busy because we all have faults you will have as long as you draw breath but in jesus christ there's perfection amen there's perfection in jesus christ and only in jesus christ so let's make our nest and our faith in the cleft of the rock i don't want you to get you just to a church i want to get you to christ i want you to have experiences with god okay i'm going to call those experiences with god revelations but says you know you take up the feather of the eagle the feather of the eagle you just can't hardly pull out you better get you a pair of pliers and lock down on it and pull your piece and put your legs on the body and to be able to pull those feathers out well that's about right because i'll tell you what those things that god gave us that wings of faith they've been planted i mean they have been planted in revelation of god and there's not just anybody that can pull that out of you just like david whenever he met goliath guess what he knew what he had done with that giant amen and that was his feathers and there was nobody going to tell him no david you can't do it no david that was just luck you got lucky with the line and the bit no not no i didn't just get lucky that was his feathers and nobody could pull it out and let me tell you when you have an experience with almighty god i'll tell you what how many beliefs salvation is really really important but when if god ever heals you brother stephen one time with anything he's able to do it again with whatever else we need to have build our faith amen that god is able to heal us because i can lay hands on you and i can put my faith in you now you if you truly believe that the elderly hands on the sticks they shall recover hey you could have it but it'll be according to your faith praise be to god higher ambitions i wrote down here we need to be have higher ambitions to better ourselves i don't know how honest how honest i should be here i know that sounds funny but the truth is sometimes when i think of myself being a pastor i'm like man you ought to let somebody else do it pastor you know because i want to what i want to be a better pastor when you think about your failures hello it saddens you makes you feel like you're not worthy you know that's right and i believe that's the way we all feel i think as a wife we could say that as a wife we could say that as a husband that i wish i was a better wife i wish i was a better husband amen for myself with my wife my wife you know i didn't treat her as good as i should have the earlier parts of our lives but i vowed to myself i said one thing i'm gonna do i'm gonna make her life good from here on out amen by god's grace god's blessings because let me tell you something young people josh leah getting married i was going to tell him this i'm going to have a talk with him maybe i'll just have a consultation right here but when you marry a wife the bible says that your life is not just your own anymore it's your job to see how you can make her happy that's what the bible says the husband is to see how that he can please his wife amen and the wife the same way in that right she is to see how she can please your husband am i right that's what you're there for that's what how it's supposed to be if you want a happy marriage you want to make sure that you please one another live for each other amen praise the lord so we want to better ourselves we want to be a better wife we want to be a better husband we want to be a better father amen we want to be a better neighbor we want to be a better boss go ahead amen all you bosses out there i want to be a better worker if you're a christian you want to be a better worker your boss should be able to serve boy son i like the way you work you know you're a good worker god bless you you know because that's how it should be all of these things are found in the book of ephesians fourth and fifth sixth chapter servants all these things and the teenagers how can i be a better example to the rest of the teenagers amen pastor and a grandpa amen have better grandpa so that we can get ready to leave amen what is a grandpa i wrote down here grandpa and i think i remember just one more sense of humor before we close we was at tractor supply and i remember one time i took one of my grandchildren why are they here yeah they're here and she said she wanted this little toy at walmart you know it was just three dollars there was another one over there about four dollars yeah i can afford four dollars you know she went ahead and she went in there and i got her about everything she wanted that date she come home the mom says papa gets me everything i want that's a good grandpa right there oh my so yesterday it was a tractor supply and getting some some dog food and so forth and she was with me um she comes over there for the box a little box bubble can i have this not just a little yeah put it in there my price jumped from 69 to 99 [Applause] i said nope no i didn't know that much ma'am they take that off i'm sorry that's a powerful for you hey i'm supposed to be paul paul right spoil them you know let the parents straighten them out thirty dollars but i said thirty dollars i said i've been warning everybody toys and tractors to fire expensive man how many wants to be better closer to god let's stand this morning let's bow our heads talk to the master how that we can be better in all of these areas how we can fly higher how we can be eagles and fly above all the things of the world the cares of life the troubles of life even death itself will fly right over it by the help of god when that comes knocking on our door we say well guess what i'm just going through a door this death here it's not you know it's my servant it's going to serve me you know it's my horse and buggy that's going to carry me over into the presence of god lord jesus as we have our heads bowed this morning i wonder how many in here know that you really want a closer and a higher walk with god god bless you god bless you i know i say that a lot but i believe that's what we should be doing it's getting closer to god all the time to be more like him to be a better father better husband better children better teenagers amen to god continue to mold us and shape us skip this that the trials that come your way is the wind that is supposed to pick you up and make you better than you was before the trial come if it isn't if it hasn't then it hasn't had the right effect you haven't taken it in the right way you have to look at it you have to deal with it different you have to call to your knees and say god lift me up above this and help me to have your spirit help me to have you in every aspect of our life lord jesus this morning now we come before you and we ask god that you help lord jesus as we're guaranteed there'll be winds we're guaranteed there'll be pressure in our lives but we ask god that we will you would help us because i truly believe that you have designed us the great architect has designed us to fly higher that we were meant to have pressure we were meant to have and face winds it was to make us be drawn higher and closer to you to make us better christians to be friendlier to love one another more to love everybody more to love you more that no matter where we are whether it's in church singing or whether it's home whether it's no matter where we are lord we'll be able to sing the songs of science uh zion and to

children will fall right into that atmosphere and be able to say dad mom i want what you have i want that sweetness that you all have that love that you have i want more of it father our children be able to fall right into place lord jesus get the holy ghost for we know that that's truly the atmosphere is what brings life it's what hatches an egg it's what brings children to you lord is the atmosphere and we thank you lord jesus for the church here god that you have given us for the atmosphere of the people that loves you lord that comes out lord jesus to worship you and speak truth lord

man god is so good this morning and brother stephen handed me this testimony and i'm going to read it and there's some humor in the last of it i really enjoyed this but stephen says since wednesday night i've had very little knee pain and i've slept like a baby he said i really feel good we want to just thank the lord for that and and then it says on her sister susan hershberger had a follow-up visit tuesday with her doctor he was very happy and this is the funny part he said go home and get you a bottle of wine and celebrate and enjoy life but you know what he didn't realize the wine on the inside the holy spirit that lives in god just and dwells within us and i just had to chuckle when i seen that and because you know they they probably don't understand or maybe their church lets them do that but hey man we're drinking from a heavenly wine this morning aren't you and i just just love him and you know i'm just thankful that he cares for us aren't you and god's been so good to us i
