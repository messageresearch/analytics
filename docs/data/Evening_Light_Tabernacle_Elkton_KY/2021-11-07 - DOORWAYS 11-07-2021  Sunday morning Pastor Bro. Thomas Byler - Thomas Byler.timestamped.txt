[28:34] morning brothers and sisters beautiful
[28:36] day to be in the house of god ask us all
[28:38] to stand please
[28:43] brother joe would you open us in service
[28:45] please
[29:34] amen
[29:35] children can be dismissed for sunday
[29:36] school
[29:38] ask us open our bibles
[29:40] to romans 2.
[29:43] we'll read verses 1 through 14.
[29:47] last one together that's romans 2.
[29:58] therefore thou art inexcusable o man
[30:01] whosoever thou art that judges for
[30:03] wherein thou judgest another thou
[30:05] condemnest thyself
[30:07] for thou that judges doeth the same
[30:09] things
[30:18] and thinketh thou this o man that judges
[30:20] them which do such things and doeth the
[30:23] same that thou shalt escape the judgment
[30:25] of god
[30:36] but after the hardness and impenet heart
[30:39] treasureth up unto thyself wrath against
[30:41] the day of wrath and revelation of the
[30:44] righteous judgment of god
[30:50] through them who by patient containence
[30:53] will do seek for glory and honor
[30:55] immortality eternal life
[31:06] tribulation and anguish upon every soul
[31:08] man that doeth evil of the jew first and
[31:11] also the gentile
[31:21] for there is no respect of persons with
[31:23] god
[31:34] we're not the hearers of the law or just
[31:36] before god but the
[31:38] but the doers of the law shall be
[31:40] justified
[31:42] for when the gentiles which have not the
[31:44] law do by nature things contained into
[31:47] law
[31:48] these having the law
[31:50] are a law unto themselves
[31:52] brother troy
[32:05] god bless you this morning
[32:09] good to be in the house of lord
[32:12] just got uh
[32:14] sprung on real uh not so long ago here
[32:17] so
[32:18] you got the
[32:20] a little spare tire this morning for
[32:22] sunday school so but that's all right
[32:24] maybe we can
[32:26] gather something out of it uh
[32:29] i was just
[32:31] it was really fast and i i couldn't seem
[32:33] to put much together but
[32:35] um just thinking
[32:37] about the different things that we have
[32:38] to go through in life sometimes and
[32:41] how a lot of times we wouldn't choose to
[32:43] go
[32:44] through the things that we have to go
[32:46] through real
[32:47] hard times or real
[32:50] difficult times
[32:52] but it's uh
[32:53] what god usually
[32:55] does with us is he shapes us and molds
[32:57] us
[32:58] and basically breaks us down
[33:01] to uh
[33:02] to uh filter out all that dross like
[33:05] brother bran said how the the beater of
[33:07] the gold be
[33:12] and
[33:13] i was just thinking about
[33:15] everybody probably can reflect in their
[33:16] own lives different times where we
[33:18] didn't
[33:19] really know which way to turn or what to
[33:21] do
[33:23] and how it happened in brother branham's
[33:24] life
[33:25] uh
[33:26] you know when he lost his wife and he
[33:29] lost his little baby
[33:31] and uh
[33:32] and he was very down and he was
[33:36] um did not know which way to go or which
[33:38] way to turn but
[33:40] but as the
[33:41] one guy asked him as you stop there on
[33:43] the side of the road and ask him
[33:45] did you did your religion hold you
[33:47] brother branham
[33:49] brother adam said
[33:51] that
[33:52] that the lord held he didn't hold his
[33:54] religion but that lord held him
[33:55] basically
[33:57] and there's something inside of us the
[33:59] lord places into us when we have a new
[34:01] birth that holds us no matter if we know
[34:04] which way to turn or what to do
[34:06] or which way to go
[34:08] and
[34:09] i was thinking of the different stories
[34:12] brother tommy
[34:13] shared a
[34:15] message with me the other day and it was
[34:17] about how
[34:18] we go through highs and lows
[34:20] and
[34:22] we'll have hill tops and valleys and
[34:25] we'll have hill tops and we'll have
[34:26] valleys
[34:27] and
[34:28] if you look through the scriptures
[34:31] for all of god's people david had very
[34:34] highs
[34:37] in his life and then he'd have highs and
[34:39] he had very low places in his life and
[34:41] uh
[34:42] uh dave is one example
[34:44] uh elijah's another example where he had
[34:47] the mount carmel experience where he had
[34:50] challenged the the
[34:52] bail profits there
[34:55] he had great victories and then a couple
[34:58] uh chapters later he was found in in the
[35:03] cave
[35:05] and
[35:06] it says that he was thinking and
[35:08] contemplating about taking his own life
[35:10] and how god found him there and he said
[35:13] to him what does thou hear elijah he
[35:15] said to him and elijah was down
[35:19] and uh
[35:21] and elijah said well basically he's the
[35:23] only one
[35:24] he tried you know to do his best and
[35:26] he's the only one in all israel that's
[35:28] still for for the true god
[35:31] and
[35:32] and it was just
[35:33] a very low point in his life
[35:36] but uh
[35:38] but it was just
[35:39] to me
[35:41] it's just uh
[35:43] we can look back and see those people
[35:45] how they got through those things but
[35:48] obviously if you're anywhere and being a
[35:51] christian walked in the way a little
[35:53] while you know that you have to go
[35:55] through some hard times
[35:56] and our brother brandon said
[35:58] we weren't called to a picnic
[36:01] so
[36:02] we were called to a battlefield
[36:04] and uh
[36:07] yeah
[36:08] so
[36:10] as i said it was just a really short
[36:11] notice but let's uh if you want to turn
[36:13] with me
[36:14] to romans here
[36:16] romans 8.
[36:20] romans 8 and 35 and paul was another one
[36:23] of those he had a pretty good probably
[36:26] decent thing going there because he was
[36:29] he was uh very smart he was very
[36:31] educated
[36:33] he was persecuting the christians
[36:35] but uh he got
[36:38] put on his face there in there
[36:40] on the road to damascus and
[36:42] and when he met the pillar of fire and
[36:45] uh said
[36:46] paul paul why thou persecuted me and
[36:49] basically it changed paul's whole life
[36:51] and uh and he went there to uh and
[36:56] he went there to i think it was ananias
[36:58] there and he said
[37:00] there
[37:01] he wanted him to pray for him basically
[37:04] and it said that
[37:07] that he'll have to suffer great things
[37:08] for my namesake and paul did suffer
[37:11] great great things
[37:13] for for the namesake of christ
[37:17] but uh in romans 8 here
[37:21] 35
[37:24] paul says
[37:26] this is that thing that holds you when
[37:28] you don't know exactly what to do it's a
[37:29] little
[37:30] like the little voice that it was not in
[37:34] when elijah was in the cave he wasn't
[37:35] answered by fire it wasn't answered by a
[37:37] whirlwind but a still small voice
[37:39] that said
[37:40] to him that
[37:41] that he knew
[37:43] and that's that little thing inside you
[37:45] that says when you don't know what to do
[37:46] and you don't know what to say when you
[37:47] don't know which way to turn there's
[37:49] something that holds you as like brother
[37:51] branson
[37:52] uh
[37:53] he went to say because because the devil
[37:55] was talking to him and saying
[37:57] uh
[37:58] you do all this stuff for the lord you
[38:00] gave your you gave your life you preach
[38:01] you do all these things for the lord but
[38:03] he took your baby and he took your
[38:05] wife
[38:07] and as brother brandon said he
[38:09] the devil was you know
[38:11] pestering him and wanted him to say why
[38:13] don't you just give it all up and don't
[38:15] serve them but there was that little
[38:17] thing that said
[38:18] though just like job when job had the
[38:20] same way
[38:22] the lord you know
[38:24] he just said basically that no matter
[38:26] what
[38:27] there's something inside me that keeps
[38:29] pressing on and keeps knowing
[38:31] and so romans 8 35 here paul says it
[38:36] who shall separate us from the love of
[38:38] christ
[38:40] shall tribulation or distress our
[38:43] persecution our famine our nakedness our
[38:46] peril our sword
[38:49] as it is written for thy sake we are
[38:52] killed all the day long we are counted
[38:54] as sheep for the slaughter they and all
[38:56] these things we are more than conquerors
[38:59] through him that loved us
[39:01] for i am persuaded
[39:03] that neither death
[39:04] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[39:08] nor powers nor things present nor things
[39:10] to come
[39:12] nor height
[39:13] nor depth nor any other creature shall
[39:16] be able to separate us from the love of
[39:18] god which is in christ jesus our lord
[39:21] and that's that small thing inside of
[39:23] every one of us
[39:24] that no matter where we are no matter
[39:27] what happens to us
[39:28] that we know that there's something
[39:30] that's changed in our lives that we're
[39:32] going to be moving
[39:33] to
[39:34] a new body and a new place
[39:37] somewhere that doesn't have all this
[39:39] struggle
[39:40] and tribulation and trials
[39:42] and it's the breaking point that we're
[39:44] in now is the breaking and breaking down
[39:46] of us to to make us into what we need to
[39:48] be to cross over so
[39:50] god bless you brother steve
[40:09] you
[40:28] good to be in the house and lord
[40:31] we do have
[40:33] a number out this morning

[1:09:33] series amen so praise the lord
[1:09:35] we want to speak on something that i was
[1:09:38] going to at first i wanted to kind of
[1:09:40] speak on uh towards the beginning but
[1:09:43] i i mean i didn't get sidetracked but
[1:09:45] the lord just let me kind of in a
[1:09:47] different way with a few different ones
[1:09:48] i may enjoy that here this last time
[1:09:50] about the uh he's the all and you know
[1:09:53] that's what we talked about last time
[1:09:55] amen and how did you can see god he's
[1:09:58] everything
[1:09:59] and he's in everything amen he's all in
[1:10:01] all amen and he's our all in all he's
[1:10:04] our everything he has our all amen both
[1:10:07] great and small so but this morning we
[1:10:10] want to talk about
[1:10:12] uh a doorway
[1:10:14] jesus being the doorway amen
[1:10:16] and so if you will turn your bibles
[1:10:23] to saint john
[1:10:26] and then also i do want to this is the
[1:10:27] first of the month and i'm going to try
[1:10:29] to keep this going
[1:10:30] amen and that is to have communion every
[1:10:32] sunday every first month okay
[1:10:35] so we want to have the lord's communion
[1:10:37] this morning all those that want to
[1:10:38] partake of it amen to remember the lord
[1:10:41] he says this do in remembrance of mate
[1:10:43] amen and we want to obey him and
[1:10:46] certainly want to remember what he did
[1:10:47] for us for if it wouldn't have been for
[1:10:49] what he did we would not be here this
[1:10:51] morning
[1:10:53] so in saint john
[1:10:55] 10
[1:10:57] we want to read
[1:10:59] the first
[1:11:00] [Music]
[1:11:03] verse
[1:11:04] and then jump down to
[1:11:07] verse seven
[1:11:10] okay verily verily i say unto you he
[1:11:12] that entereth not by the door
[1:11:15] into the sheepfold but climbeth up some
[1:11:17] other way the same is a thief and a
[1:11:20] robber
[1:11:22] verse 7
[1:11:23] then said jesus unto them
[1:11:26] verily verily i say unto you
[1:11:29] i am
[1:11:30] the store
[1:11:32] of the sheep
[1:11:34] all that ever came before me are thieves
[1:11:36] and robbers but the sheep did not hear
[1:11:38] them i am the door
[1:11:41] amen tell me at least that's what god is
[1:11:44] he is the door
[1:11:46] by me if any man enter in he shall be
[1:11:49] saved and shall go in and out and find
[1:11:52] pastor amen how many beliefs without
[1:11:55] christ you can do nothing amen you're
[1:11:57] not going to feed you're not going to
[1:11:59] eat right it's just not it's not going
[1:12:01] to work unless you are in christ
[1:12:04] amen the thief cometh not but for to
[1:12:07] steal and to kill
[1:12:09] and to destroy
[1:12:11] i am come that they might have life and
[1:12:13] that they might have it more abundantly
[1:12:15] may god add his blessings to the reading
[1:12:16] the word you can be seated i want to
[1:12:18] touch on something that i don't really
[1:12:20] want to go too far down this road but i
[1:12:22] do want to mention this because i i felt
[1:12:24] like
[1:12:25] like when i was reading this that just
[1:12:26] it just kind of come to me
[1:12:28] and that is that when he talks about a
[1:12:30] thief cometh not
[1:12:32] but to kill him to kill and destroy
[1:12:34] you jump back up to verse
[1:12:36] verse one he says you know
[1:12:39] uh he that climbeth up some other way to
[1:12:42] see same as a thief and a robber right
[1:12:45] so when a person comes to christ perhaps
[1:12:48] wants to be a part of a church
[1:12:50] all right wants to come into christ be
[1:12:52] part of the assembly if you don't get
[1:12:54] into christ right if you don't get the
[1:12:57] baptism of the holy ghost for know this
[1:13:00] all you're going to do is cause
[1:13:01] destruction
[1:13:04] this is where you say amen
[1:13:08] amen how many knows that because you
[1:13:10] can't help it
[1:13:11] if you're not born again you will lean
[1:13:13] to your carnal nature
[1:13:16] notice i says if you come up some other
[1:13:18] way you're nothing but a thief and a
[1:13:20] robber
[1:13:21] you're just here to kill and to steal
[1:13:24] and to destroy that's the only reason
[1:13:26] you're there
[1:13:27] pretty strong isn't it
[1:13:29] amen but you have to be that now
[1:13:31] uh
[1:13:32] when we think about a door
[1:13:34] in a doorway
[1:13:36] amen and i you know how he knows jesus
[1:13:38] is the way
[1:13:41] right and many times we'll call
[1:13:45] that this area here this you know what
[1:13:47] can we you can call it a door right
[1:13:51] or what else is it that we call it
[1:13:55] thank you it's my title right yeah my
[1:13:57] door it's a doorway it's a doorway
[1:14:00] all right it's a way and it's a door
[1:14:03] why and that's
[1:14:05] for a purpose it's to go in and out it's
[1:14:08] either to go in or to come out and as i
[1:14:10] got to thinking about this and i got to
[1:14:12] think about everything that the bible
[1:14:13] talks about the door
[1:14:14] i almost in my own my own philosophy is
[1:14:17] that a door is almost as irrelevant as
[1:14:20] the
[1:14:21] the wheel
[1:14:23] amen because everything when you think
[1:14:26] about everything that encumbers the door
[1:14:28] and what in doorways it's about as about
[1:14:31] as much as what a wheel is you know
[1:14:32] because you can't get anywhere i mean it
[1:14:33] knows that when they invented the wheel
[1:14:35] they invented quite something
[1:14:38] i don't care if it's on a box wagon or
[1:14:40] what it was
[1:14:41] at least they didn't have to have a
[1:14:42] sleigh and drag it
[1:14:43] they could roll it it's pretty important
[1:14:45] so is doorways
[1:14:47] doorways are very very important amen
[1:14:51] and so we want to talk about that and
[1:14:52] then
[1:14:53] through the prophet's message
[1:14:55] we realized that he explained how that
[1:14:57] in the orient over there how that there
[1:14:59] is
[1:15:00] right
[1:15:01] there is an opening
[1:15:03] uh into this they have sheep and they
[1:15:05] call all the sheep through this this
[1:15:07] opening into a shelter perhaps right
[1:15:10] into a shelter and there is no door
[1:15:13] there's no door
[1:15:15] it's only a doorway
[1:15:17] right
[1:15:18] and brother branham describes he said
[1:15:21] that at night the shepherd will lay down
[1:15:25] in that opening
[1:15:26] right
[1:15:28] what does that mean that means that he
[1:15:30] becomes the door
[1:15:33] nothing can come in or nothing can go
[1:15:35] out but through him right and that's why
[1:15:38] jesus said you know there's an opening
[1:15:40] but listen i am
[1:15:42] the door
[1:15:43] i'm not i'm not the frame i'm not just
[1:15:45] the same but i am the actual door to the
[1:15:49] sheepfold
[1:15:50] something else that tells us that is
[1:15:52] there's no other way
[1:15:54] into this sheepfold but through the new
[1:15:56] birth
[1:15:57] but through christ right just becoming a
[1:16:00] church member putting your name on the
[1:16:01] book or whatever it is
[1:16:04] amen that's why you know we don't have
[1:16:07] any membership as far as a book with
[1:16:09] member number no no you become part of
[1:16:12] the body of christ through the new birth
[1:16:14] by one spirit are we all baptized into
[1:16:17] one body
[1:16:19] amen
[1:16:20] so if we're going to cover
[1:16:23] several different areas and you know
[1:16:25] being communion usually i like to quit
[1:16:27] about 12 or 12 15
[1:16:29] but anyway we'll just go as far as the
[1:16:31] holy spirit leads this morning all right
[1:16:33] because there's so much that we could
[1:16:35] talk about in that area
[1:16:37] now if you want to uh uh brother bannon
[1:16:40] he preached a message i think it was in
[1:16:42] 62 called the key to the door
[1:16:44] key to the door amen it's very good
[1:16:47] amen
[1:16:48] and also there's something else we want
[1:16:50] to bring in with the help of the lord
[1:16:52] that is the key amen how many knows most
[1:16:54] doors have a key
[1:16:56] there's always a key going into a door
[1:16:58] so there's a door and then there's a key
[1:17:00] to the door
[1:17:02] right
[1:17:03] nami knows who had the key to the door
[1:17:10] huh
[1:17:11] say it out loud so i can really so you
[1:17:12] can really fail or be right peter right
[1:17:17] i give thee the keys to the kingdom of
[1:17:20] heaven
[1:17:21] you know jesus gave peter the keys to
[1:17:23] the kingdom
[1:17:24] he had the keys he knew how to get in
[1:17:28] because it's one thing to have a door
[1:17:30] that ought to be there but you've got to
[1:17:32] have a key to get in
[1:17:34] amen now let me ask you this what is the
[1:17:38] key
[1:17:44] faith
[1:17:45] are you sure
[1:17:47] well you're right
[1:17:49] that's right
[1:17:50] faith is the key to the lord amen
[1:17:53] because by faith isn't that right
[1:17:55] everything everything is by faith
[1:17:57] according to hebrews 11 by faith we
[1:17:59] understand by faith able by faith all of
[1:18:01] these great people did great things by
[1:18:04] faith without faith it's impossible to
[1:18:07] please god we are through by grace
[1:18:10] through faith right and that not of
[1:18:12] yourselves it's a gift of god so that's
[1:18:14] how we're saved is by grace through
[1:18:16] faith i mean you gotta have that faith
[1:18:19] amen
[1:18:20] my when we think about that it opens up
[1:18:23] an avenue it opens up a channel we know
[1:18:26] that there is a key to science now
[1:18:28] there's many different keys let's just
[1:18:30] talk about science for a little bit but
[1:18:32] i want to get into the spiritual part in
[1:18:34] revelations the fourth chapter and in
[1:18:36] the third chapter we're going to talk
[1:18:37] about a couple doors over there
[1:18:39] but the the key of science
[1:18:43] amen
[1:18:44] i mean another time there was a time we
[1:18:46] didn't have this right here hello hello
[1:18:49] you can hear me good now right
[1:18:52] they had to discover everything that had
[1:18:54] there had to be and thomas edison amen
[1:18:56] he was one of those who you know they
[1:18:59] probably might have thought that he was
[1:19:01] crazy to think that you take lightning
[1:19:03] huh
[1:19:04] like thomas like are like who was it uh
[1:19:07] benjamin franklin thought somehow that
[1:19:08] harness can be power he harnessed that
[1:19:11] thing somehow you know
[1:19:12] well we created our own uh
[1:19:15] lightning so to speak right
[1:19:17] our own electricity and so forth you
[1:19:19] know and and thomas he he thomas said
[1:19:21] he's man he just knew somehow that he
[1:19:24] can convert this
[1:19:26] power into
[1:19:28] making light
[1:19:31] huh
[1:19:32] now how many knows your brain your mind
[1:19:35] is a great door too
[1:19:37] your mind is a door
[1:19:39] that's right it's the womb to this it's
[1:19:41] a channel brethren calls even every one
[1:19:43] of your feelings and i want to go that
[1:19:45] towards the end i want to talk about but
[1:19:46] but every one of your emotions they're
[1:19:48] also they're all doors
[1:19:51] called channels just like that he's a
[1:19:53] channel amen you have to open that
[1:19:55] channel up just like you got to open
[1:19:57] that mind up
[1:20:00] in that right to receive
[1:20:02] whatever you're going to receive and
[1:20:03] that's why how many knows that's why the
[1:20:06] world is in the condition that is in
[1:20:08] because when rock and roll came out it
[1:20:10] opened up the channel of rebellion
[1:20:15] and it let all those swirling demons
[1:20:18] that come out of hell it lets them enter
[1:20:20] into their minds and in their hearts now
[1:20:23] we are where we are because they open up
[1:20:26] the channel they opened up the door of
[1:20:27] their mind and their heart
[1:20:30] amen
[1:20:34] praise the lord
[1:20:36] so that that's even the channel even
[1:20:38] though a channel of our mind and thomas
[1:20:40] edison he went and he worked and he
[1:20:42] worked and he worked
[1:20:43] now i don't know about you can i can
[1:20:45] just about hear
[1:20:47] thomas edison whenever he begin to get
[1:20:49] something that started to light up a
[1:20:50] little bit isn't that right
[1:20:53] i'd imagine he got a little happy
[1:20:57] when he realized hey
[1:20:59] this thing blew you know and this stayed
[1:21:02] on for 10 minutes before it blew if it
[1:21:04] stayed on one minute before it blew he
[1:21:06] probably got real happy because he knew
[1:21:08] he says if i can get it and keep it
[1:21:10] going 60 seconds i'm gonna keep it going
[1:21:14] forever
[1:21:16] huh
[1:21:18] well i don't know about you but hey
[1:21:20] i appreciate those who invented things
[1:21:22] don't you we're enjoying
[1:21:25] how many times do we look at the light
[1:21:27] and say thank you thomas i'm glad you
[1:21:29] had faith you lit up the whole world
[1:21:32] huh
[1:21:33] because one man opened up his mind in
[1:21:36] science and believed something
[1:21:38] that it could be done
[1:21:40] and on and on and on in the realm of
[1:21:42] military
[1:21:44] can you imagine brother if if if i was
[1:21:46] to go and join the military this morning
[1:21:49] and they would give me a muzzle loader
[1:21:53] huh
[1:21:54] how would you like it if you was handed
[1:21:56] a muzzle loader
[1:21:58] right
[1:22:00] i don't know about you i quit
[1:22:03] i quit
[1:22:07] why because i ain't got time i got a
[1:22:10] whole minute to reload your thing when
[1:22:13] they're spraying them at me
[1:22:17] literally spray how many knows that
[1:22:21] just spray they don't just shoot they
[1:22:23] spray him at you
[1:22:25] why because somebody believed that this
[1:22:27] thing can you know wasn't it a great
[1:22:29] thing when they come up with the
[1:22:31] revolver
[1:22:33] yeah the revolver was great when they
[1:22:35] come up with the revolver fish or hey
[1:22:36] guess what i can shoot six people with
[1:22:38] this thing
[1:22:40] now what have we got
[1:22:41] we got these little magazine that's got
[1:22:43] 30 in them they don't like for us to
[1:22:44] have 30.
[1:22:48] all right we're getting political right
[1:22:49] and y'all getting
[1:22:50] quiet but anyway that's right think
[1:22:53] about think about how that people
[1:22:55] believed something and knew that there
[1:22:57] was more whether it's four whether it
[1:22:59] was the engine whether it was the car
[1:23:02] how many knows hey one at one time no
[1:23:05] doubt
[1:23:06] that some of these fast sources could
[1:23:08] outrun that little mechanism you got
[1:23:10] rolling down the street there
[1:23:13] what is that funky looking thing you
[1:23:15] know i can go faster with my hearts you
[1:23:18] might have made fun of it but would they
[1:23:19] make fun of it today
[1:23:21] they hushed up a little bit when it
[1:23:23] comes to roaring roared past them left
[1:23:25] them sitting there
[1:23:28] huh
[1:23:32] i'm sorry
[1:23:33] i'm gonna be just a little bit honest
[1:23:35] whenever i get to push the gas pedal to
[1:23:37] get up there just pass the buggy a
[1:23:39] little bit and go i'm like poor guys
[1:23:43] poor guys they think they still gotta do
[1:23:45] that
[1:23:47] yeah you got to do that i hope you enjoy
[1:23:50] it
[1:23:51] i like a good old-fashioned buggy ride
[1:23:53] but it's just going to be a pleasure
[1:23:54] ride for me
[1:23:59] all right but that's the truth right
[1:24:01] think about the science world look at
[1:24:03] what opened up because of the door of
[1:24:05] science even the prophet talked about
[1:24:07] that it opened up the science of war
[1:24:10] how many know nowadays brother brown he
[1:24:12] said makes a statement that you really
[1:24:14] can't even have war anymore
[1:24:22] that's right
[1:24:24] and you know you know what wars for war
[1:24:27] is for
[1:24:28] for countries
[1:24:30] that don't have nuclear capability
[1:24:34] pretty much
[1:24:36] why because we don't mess with russia
[1:24:39] we don't mess with cuba
[1:24:41] we don't mess with china
[1:24:43] we don't mess with people
[1:24:45] ultimately we know what's going to
[1:24:47] happen if you push too hard right
[1:24:49] you can't have war you can't do it why
[1:24:52] because you don't want to go there
[1:24:54] amen it's only for afghanistan these all
[1:24:56] these countries that don't have that yet
[1:24:58] well you can go push them around a
[1:25:00] little bit and so forth
[1:25:01] but anyway
[1:25:03] so even there look at where that's
[1:25:04] gotten look at where that has went
[1:25:07] to the complete
[1:25:08] you know i can't really imagine but we
[1:25:10] know that especially during ronald
[1:25:12] reagan's time we know that they were in
[1:25:14] a disarmament and getting rid of them
[1:25:16] because
[1:25:17] we they just had too much there was just
[1:25:19] there was enough there to destroy this
[1:25:22] earth
[1:25:23] too many times
[1:25:25] not once but too many times i mean you
[1:25:28] could have burned it over six seven i
[1:25:29] don't know how many times but the man
[1:25:31] says if they let go of that there
[1:25:32] wouldn't be what what did he say brother
[1:25:34] man something about there wouldn't be a
[1:25:35] green blade of grass anywhere
[1:25:40] it didn't fry at all
[1:25:42] amen
[1:25:45] so that's where it is in science because
[1:25:47] they worked at it they believed it could
[1:25:49] be done and it was
[1:25:51] and because even we believe that it
[1:25:52] could be none if y'all ever did the uh
[1:25:56] uh study on how they got to build this
[1:25:59] nuclear bomb and the city they built and
[1:26:01] everything that they went through and
[1:26:02] the scientists until they got it and
[1:26:05] saved a lot of american lives isn't that
[1:26:07] right because we made them jobs give up
[1:26:10] after a couple of bombs dropped
[1:26:13] hey man i'm not sure but i think that's
[1:26:15] probably the only two bombs ever dropped
[1:26:17] right
[1:26:19] isn't that quite something
[1:26:21] you know there's a lot of tests but i
[1:26:23] don't know that anybody ever use them
[1:26:24] again because they know how danger it is
[1:26:27] you know your your mind in my mind can't
[1:26:29] imagine but brother i am talking about
[1:26:31] how to like whenever uh you know if they
[1:26:33] would let some of those gold the hole
[1:26:35] would be about 100 feet deep
[1:26:38] and hundreds of miles wide or whatever
[1:26:40] it put a
[1:26:42] almost cracked the earth open to he
[1:26:44] talked
[1:26:47] and of course of course perhaps bring
[1:26:48] the lava out maybe that's what it'll
[1:26:50] take to make the earth new again because
[1:26:52] we gotta get this all covered up somehow
[1:26:54] don't we
[1:26:55] we gotta get this mess covered up
[1:26:57] someday
[1:26:58] we ain't gonna live in this in the
[1:26:59] millennium
[1:27:01] but the power what i was trying to say
[1:27:03] was is the sheer power of hiroshima and
[1:27:06] nagasaki it's a hundred times from what
[1:27:09] i understand 100 times more powerful
[1:27:12] and if that would take the whole city
[1:27:13] out a hundred times take a whole state
[1:27:15] out
[1:27:17] think about that and then how many of
[1:27:19] those they have
[1:27:22] all hanging in the hangars brother john
[1:27:25] waiting for some guy to just get upset
[1:27:28] had enough
[1:27:29] brother branham called pulling the lever
[1:27:32] i don't know if it's a lever or button
[1:27:34] but whatever it is
[1:27:35] when one goes isn't that right
[1:27:38] china
[1:27:39] huh
[1:27:42] china and
[1:27:43] and if somebody just lets it go and
[1:27:45] because you know we the bride won't be
[1:27:47] here for that
[1:27:49] amen
[1:27:51] but anyway that's in the world and
[1:27:53] that's the door of science and that's
[1:27:54] how far they have went
[1:27:56] everything from radio to television to
[1:27:59] everything that you can imagine that we
[1:28:01] didn't know existed even the band said
[1:28:03] existed back then but she just now
[1:28:05] discovered it
[1:28:11] cars driving by themselves
[1:28:13] amen
[1:28:14] how many i think brother david was
[1:28:16] telling me about his and brother jeff
[1:28:18] probably about you can hit the auto and
[1:28:20] it just drives you down the road
[1:28:23] you know
[1:28:26] good luck with that i like to drive
[1:28:29] myself
[1:28:30] but i'm gonna hurt myself i want it to
[1:28:32] be my own doing
[1:28:35] no i don't say i wouldn't you know if
[1:28:37] there wasn't too much traffic around
[1:28:39] maybe something but i'm telling you but
[1:28:41] look at it you know
[1:28:44] i think brother uh tommy sent me
[1:28:46] something
[1:28:47] of that little thing that they fly like
[1:28:48] a hovercraft
[1:28:51] what did they call that
[1:28:54] the jet
[1:28:57] okay the jet ski or something
[1:29:00] jet son yeah you know the jetson little
[1:29:02] flyer thing while they come up with that
[1:29:03] now
[1:29:04] you know people come you know just all
[1:29:07] all kinds of signs that people thought
[1:29:09] maybe never would happen
[1:29:11] huh
[1:29:13] but yet becoming what would we discover
[1:29:17] now
[1:29:19] i believe if i'm not wrong brother
[1:29:20] branham talked about science
[1:29:23] tapping into
[1:29:25] uh that they're trying to find the
[1:29:27] source of life
[1:29:29] is that right and brother bam says if we
[1:29:31] aren't careful they'll find it before us
[1:29:33] preachers do
[1:29:35] right what really brings life and what
[1:29:37] makes life because we're supposed to
[1:29:39] have that life already we know what
[1:29:41] makes life we know that it's god right
[1:29:44] i believe it was einstein isn't that
[1:29:46] right he was looking for it and he was
[1:29:47] trying to figure it out all
[1:29:49] and he come up with a conclusion is god
[1:29:52] by faith you know we understand that
[1:29:54] worlds were framed by the word of god
[1:29:56] that was pretty much his conclusion from
[1:29:58] what i understand
[1:29:59] he found it he found out hey there's
[1:30:01] only one that's got there's got to be
[1:30:03] god
[1:30:04] i think it's a pretty smart scientist
[1:30:06] whenever they figure out that it takes
[1:30:07] god to do it all
[1:30:10] i don't have too much to say for the guy
[1:30:11] that thinks it evolved okay i don't
[1:30:13] think they're very intelligent to say
[1:30:15] the least
[1:30:17] you should know better than that you
[1:30:18] know it didn't amen all right
[1:30:22] let's go to revelations with me will you
[1:30:27] revelations and we'll go to the third
[1:30:29] chapter
[1:30:31] revelations 3
[1:30:39] verse 7.
[1:30:49] all right remember revelation 3 verse 7
[1:30:52] it says and to the fellow and then to
[1:30:54] the angels of the philip
[1:30:55] philadelphia right he thinks saith he
[1:30:57] that is holy he that is true
[1:31:00] he that hath the key of david he that
[1:31:02] openeth
[1:31:04] and no man shut up
[1:31:06] and shutteth
[1:31:07] and no man openeth
[1:31:10] how many believes that when god opens
[1:31:12] the door it's going to be
[1:31:14] open ain't nobody gonna shout it
[1:31:19] and when he shuts the door
[1:31:21] it's gonna be shut ain't nobody gonna
[1:31:23] open it
[1:31:27] i know thy works behold i have set
[1:31:30] before thee and open
[1:31:33] door
[1:31:34] and no man can shut it for thou has a
[1:31:37] little strength and has kept my word and
[1:31:40] has not denied my name amen now this was
[1:31:44] just before the laodicea age he was
[1:31:48] talking about the door that was going to
[1:31:49] be open in front of him before the head
[1:31:53] of the there's an open door you can go
[1:31:56] back to church agents due to search and
[1:31:58] study of what brother graham all
[1:31:59] explained about what that was but it was
[1:32:01] about christ opening the door and
[1:32:03] bringing us back to himself
[1:32:07] amen
[1:32:08] in other words how many of those martin
[1:32:10] luther and during that right
[1:32:12] during that time era oh they wanted to
[1:32:15] kill martin luther for standing up
[1:32:16] against them
[1:32:18] how many knows back in the dark ages
[1:32:20] folks if you we was sitting here back in
[1:32:22] the dark ages we didn't know when the
[1:32:25] cops were going to come and drag us out
[1:32:27] of here you're not allowed to worship
[1:32:30] like this
[1:32:31] you come and you bow and you kiss the
[1:32:33] crucifix or we'll kill you we'll feed
[1:32:36] you to lions we'll burn you at the stake
[1:32:40] folks i don't even want to go into the
[1:32:41] description how horrible it is with
[1:32:43] pregnant women and everything else they
[1:32:44] did
[1:32:46] folks he was a nightmare it was a
[1:32:48] complete horror
[1:32:49] down through a thousand years the
[1:32:51] catholicism had a thousand years where
[1:32:54] it seemed like the door to religious
[1:32:56] freedom was shut
[1:32:58] but how many know that was the opening
[1:33:00] god says i'm going to open the door
[1:33:03] amen you're going to get out of this and
[1:33:05] i don't care how much the pope brings to
[1:33:07] martin luther in front of him and how
[1:33:08] many others that get killed during that
[1:33:10] time because a lot of them did
[1:33:13] is that right
[1:33:15] that's a headache but god was opening
[1:33:17] the door and there ain't no pope there
[1:33:19] ain't no devil in hell want to shut it
[1:33:23] amen
[1:33:25] and if you no matter how much the devil
[1:33:27] tried no matter how much they tried to
[1:33:28] shut it down they could not shut it down
[1:33:31] and the revival spurred and here it
[1:33:33] comes isn't that right
[1:33:34] because it was time for rev restoration
[1:33:38] amen and openly you talk about opening a
[1:33:41] door are you talking about opening our
[1:33:43] eyes and everything that come along with
[1:33:45] it
[1:33:47] i'm rejoicing because of that scripture
[1:33:49] right there this morning you're
[1:33:50] rejoicing because god opened the door
[1:33:53] that no man can shut
[1:33:58] oh how many knows that in our age
[1:33:59] whenever brother brandon preached the
[1:34:01] seals and he preached a breach and
[1:34:03] talking about there's no mercy once
[1:34:04] those seals are broke
[1:34:06] that he stands up but he takes it it
[1:34:08] sounds like
[1:34:10] hey folks if you want to go to seed on
[1:34:11] something get some false doctrine that's
[1:34:13] a good place to start
[1:34:14] well he said you know when those shields
[1:34:16] are broke there's no more mercy and so
[1:34:18] forth
[1:34:21] and then different ones were saying look
[1:34:23] we don't need preachers anymore do we
[1:34:25] you know there's nobody going to be
[1:34:26] saved anymore should we work anymore
[1:34:29] brother ben says don't you ever quit
[1:34:30] working
[1:34:31] you keep on going you the door is open
[1:34:34] god will close the door amen not you
[1:34:38] amen
[1:34:40] so here we are
[1:34:42] still working
[1:34:44] but when god closes the door
[1:34:46] it's going to be shut
[1:34:48] when that last one comes in it's going
[1:34:50] to be all over with
[1:34:52] i'm going to believe that
[1:34:54] i'm glad that door's still open
[1:34:56] some of us need it isn't that right
[1:34:59] our loved ones need it any of our loved
[1:35:01] ones that aren't in yet
[1:35:03] they need that door to stay open
[1:35:06] amen i was calling come on come on
[1:35:09] come in for the door still well let's
[1:35:11] see why you still can
[1:35:13] praise be to god
[1:35:16] amen anything now i'm going to say this
[1:35:17] when anything that god does
[1:35:20] anything that he does
[1:35:22] the devil can't stop
[1:35:25] you think about
[1:35:27] well back in pharaoh's time perhaps
[1:35:30] how many knows in the days of pharaoh
[1:35:31] they were killing all the male children
[1:35:33] because they had heard that there was a
[1:35:35] deliverer
[1:35:36] born
[1:35:37] right they went and killed all the
[1:35:39] babies they were trying to shut this
[1:35:41] door they don't want no delivery
[1:35:43] airborne
[1:35:44] huh they wanted to try to get him could
[1:35:46] they do it
[1:35:48] no
[1:35:51] one of you all should tell me the story
[1:35:53] but i guess i will since i'm the
[1:35:54] preacher
[1:35:56] well what did god do he took the
[1:35:58] deliverer
[1:36:00] and made pharaoh raise him
[1:36:02] how are you talking about a good one
[1:36:04] brother jim that was a good one
[1:36:08] i mean it wasn't a pharaoh's daughter
[1:36:11] right she was out there bathing or
[1:36:13] something out there in the river and saw
[1:36:14] a little baby come around there and had
[1:36:16] the servants grab that baby now go find
[1:36:18] me a wet mother
[1:36:20] and found the very mother
[1:36:23] oh my god the raised moses right there
[1:36:25] right under pharaoh's nose
[1:36:29] oh my that's god for you
[1:36:36] and then what happened
[1:36:38] poor guy later on there moses grew up
[1:36:41] did they get him no they didn't get it
[1:36:44] he went out there for a while had to be
[1:36:45] out there on the backside of the desert
[1:36:47] and get his good lesson teaching from
[1:36:49] god
[1:36:50] right
[1:36:51] and when god decided here this is the
[1:36:52] time for your deliverance go down in
[1:36:54] egypt
[1:36:55] get in front of pharaoh
[1:36:58] and tell him to tell by tell the pharaoh
[1:37:00] to let my people go
[1:37:04] folks when god says something it's best
[1:37:06] just to fall in line
[1:37:09] because if you don't but you're going to
[1:37:11] be fighting god
[1:37:13] folks i'm here to tell you something
[1:37:14] right now to make a long story show
[1:37:16] there's a lot of people that fight god
[1:37:18] they fight what's right don't even know
[1:37:20] it
[1:37:22] how about the church world how many
[1:37:23] knows the church world wouldn't even let
[1:37:25] people come to brother bannon's meeting
[1:37:26] and where christ himself was coming down
[1:37:29] in the congregation discerning thoughts
[1:37:30] and tense of the heart amen and
[1:37:32] excommunicate they were fighting on
[1:37:34] didn't even realize it
[1:37:36] anybody that fights god's program
[1:37:39] remember this they are fighting god
[1:37:43] trying to shut down what god is doing
[1:37:47] the devil loves to try to shut down what
[1:37:50] god is doing the devil does
[1:37:54] [Music]
[1:37:56] oh my
[1:37:58] but it's
[1:37:59] god's not going to have it is he it's
[1:38:01] not going to happen
[1:38:03] you're only going to find yourself in
[1:38:05] chaos fighting god
[1:38:08] over in the book of acts it happened
[1:38:09] remember
[1:38:16] remember there was a big uproar in the
[1:38:17] book of acts
[1:38:19] and there was a lot of them saying this
[1:38:21] and a lot of them saying that and they
[1:38:22] wanted to
[1:38:23] get peter and all of them you know but
[1:38:26] and get rid of them
[1:38:28] but there stood one up in the council a
[1:38:31] pharisee named gamalia a doctor a real
[1:38:36] scholar a real
[1:38:37] wise guy
[1:38:39] and he was actually smart here right
[1:38:42] because he went to talking about acts 5
[1:38:44] and verse 20 34 he goes to talking about
[1:38:46] all the different people that had come
[1:38:49] and proclaimed themselves to be a
[1:38:51] somebody amen and holiday took and let
[1:38:54] 300 people or 3 000 people out and most
[1:38:57] of them got killed or died or and then
[1:38:59] another one came and they fell apart
[1:39:02] right they came to naught
[1:39:05] in verse 37 after this man rose up judas
[1:39:08] of galilea galilee in the days of the
[1:39:10] taxing and drew away many much people
[1:39:13] after him he also perished and all even
[1:39:16] as many as obeyed him were dispersed and
[1:39:19] now i say unto you refrain from these
[1:39:21] men and let them alone for if this
[1:39:23] council or this work be of men it'll
[1:39:26] come a night
[1:39:28] it'll come to nothing but if it be of
[1:39:31] god you cannot overthrow it
[1:39:35] hallelujah least happily you be fine to
[1:39:39] fight even against god
[1:39:43] oh my
[1:39:46] how many can say this morning you fight
[1:39:48] against the message of the hour you're
[1:39:50] fighting against god's open door
[1:39:53] you're fighting against god
[1:39:58] lord help us right
[1:40:00] was it herald i believe it was that
[1:40:01] killed all the little babies
[1:40:04] thinking he could get rid of the king of
[1:40:05] the jews because he had heard that there
[1:40:07] is a king born among the jews he took
[1:40:10] your caring tried to get rid of him he
[1:40:12] never got rid of him
[1:40:14] can't do it he can't prevail against god
[1:40:18] when he opens the door it's open
[1:40:20] how many knows a lot of times things
[1:40:22] will happen in our lives we don't know
[1:40:24] why
[1:40:26] well i'll tell you sometimes we do know
[1:40:28] why because we did it ourselves right
[1:40:30] but sometimes we don't know why but let
[1:40:32] me tell you something how many knows
[1:40:34] when it seems like completely shut down
[1:40:36] in one place but if god is with you know
[1:40:39] this he will open up another door
[1:40:43] how many believes he does that he
[1:40:44] supplies for us you might get fired but
[1:40:47] guess commit yourself to god god will
[1:40:49] give you another job god will open up a
[1:40:52] door
[1:40:53] he's very intricate about dealing with
[1:40:55] each and every one of us
[1:40:57] about the how many beliefs i don't know
[1:40:59] about you but
[1:41:01] he's opened many a doors for me he's
[1:41:04] closed doors he's open doors
[1:41:07] folks i'm not going to try to make my
[1:41:08] own door
[1:41:10] i know people that try to make their own
[1:41:11] doors and make their own way and it's a
[1:41:14] clam of day
[1:41:15] yeah that's what it is it's a calamity
[1:41:19] but if you'll follow god when he opens
[1:41:21] the door and what he does
[1:41:23] oh it's awesome
[1:41:27] praise be to god this morning aren't you
[1:41:28] glad for that
[1:41:30] that when he opens the door nobody can
[1:41:32] shut it
[1:41:34] how many knows for 2 000 years
[1:41:36] everything's ever since christ came
[1:41:39] even the apostle paul was trying to shut
[1:41:43] down the church
[1:41:45] he was trying to shut it up ain't nobody
[1:41:47] a new bunch of heretics i'm gonna come
[1:41:50] i'm gonna arrest you
[1:41:57] it's like trying to go out there in a
[1:41:59] wheat field that's burning and taking a
[1:42:01] a a a blanket and swashing it out
[1:42:05] and then the sparks fly over the other
[1:42:07] wheat and every time you go like god it
[1:42:09] spreads out ten feet and woof oh my god
[1:42:12] i can't do that again
[1:42:14] right the more they try to put the fire
[1:42:17] out the higher it shoots
[1:42:20] that's the way with the gospel
[1:42:22] amen
[1:42:23] paul he would bring a bunch of prisoners
[1:42:25] in and he found out hey as you hear
[1:42:27] there's a hundred of them got curved
[1:42:29] converted over a glacial over in ephesus
[1:42:33] they're rising up a bunch over there
[1:42:36] huh
[1:42:37] paul was fixing to be a real busy man
[1:42:42] but thank god god got a hold of him
[1:42:47] amen said isn't it hard for you to kick
[1:42:50] against the pricks
[1:42:52] huh
[1:42:53] i don't know about you but kicking
[1:42:56] against the prick
[1:42:58] i don't know the exact interpretation
[1:43:00] but a prick for my understanding is
[1:43:02] something a sticker or something and you
[1:43:04] kick against that
[1:43:05] ouch it's going to hurt
[1:43:08] it doesn't avail
[1:43:10] that's what he was doing
[1:43:13] you know
[1:43:14] jesus said why are you persecuting me
[1:43:17] and paul said who art now lord
[1:43:20] huh
[1:43:22] it was paul's first revelation who food
[1:43:24] a man jesus really was
[1:43:26] wasn't it he never really had the
[1:43:28] revelation how it how paul managed to
[1:43:30] make it through all of the time that
[1:43:32] jesus walked the shores of galilee
[1:43:33] lazarus being raised from the dead
[1:43:35] opening up the blind and all of that and
[1:43:37] all of that and yet none of them at no
[1:43:39] time was he converted
[1:43:41] at no time did he become jesus as
[1:43:42] followers
[1:43:44] not until after he was gone risen again
[1:43:47] amen come back in the pillar fire was in
[1:43:50] his church and then paul began to
[1:43:51] persecute the christians
[1:43:53] began to try to put the fire out
[1:43:56] fighting against the program of god
[1:44:01] and let me tell you something christians
[1:44:02] were scared of him
[1:44:04] they were scared of the man
[1:44:07] when somebody said
[1:44:09] he got saved
[1:44:11] he's one of us
[1:44:15] let me tell you it was a real sticky
[1:44:17] feeling when you come around to walking
[1:44:18] into the church there and father why
[1:44:22] where is he so high i don't believe it
[1:44:25] i'm doubt thomas for sure
[1:44:27] right
[1:44:28] a lot of people didn't believe it
[1:44:31] some of the
[1:44:32] different ones had to
[1:44:35] acknowledge yes god has done a work for
[1:44:37] him
[1:44:38] he had become one of them
[1:44:41] amen
[1:44:44] and after that we find somebody else
[1:44:45] working against him who was it
[1:44:48] saul's or paul's peers
[1:44:52] some of those votes that were helping
[1:44:53] him perhaps and cheering him on is that
[1:44:55] right say what
[1:44:58] but he's one of them
[1:45:00] now what he's a heretic we'll kill him
[1:45:04] right
[1:45:05] 12 men or so quite a 15 men i believe it
[1:45:08] was the bible talks about had
[1:45:10] sworn an oath
[1:45:12] that they would not eat
[1:45:14] until paul was not breathing anymore
[1:45:18] you talk about somebody be hammering
[1:45:19] about stopping the fire
[1:45:22] can we smile this morning and say
[1:45:25] they got pretty hungry probably
[1:45:29] you're gonna get hungry if you start
[1:45:30] fighting against god and say you ain't
[1:45:32] gonna eat until a certain man did
[1:45:35] amen no it's not gonna work didn't work
[1:45:38] did it
[1:45:39] they laid in waiting everything else but
[1:45:41] it didn't work
[1:45:44] amen
[1:45:47] doors
[1:45:48] how many he is the door
[1:45:52] when daniel was thrown into lions then
[1:45:56] what was his way out
[1:46:02] the fire was there
[1:46:14] it was the avenue
[1:46:16] by which he escaped
[1:46:19] how many knows jesus said i am the way
[1:46:22] he's the way
[1:46:24] he's the door
[1:46:25] he's the way he's the direction he's the
[1:46:28] way out
[1:46:29] he's the way of escape
[1:46:31] he himself is the three hebrew children
[1:46:33] when they were cast into the fiery
[1:46:36] furnace
[1:46:37] amen
[1:46:39] who was it that saved him the fourth man
[1:46:42] god himself he was their channel he was
[1:46:45] their doorway he was their way out
[1:46:49] their doorway he was the way he's their
[1:46:51] way out
[1:46:53] amen
[1:46:55] many times
[1:46:57] in the bible you think about the way
[1:46:59] out
[1:47:00] the bible even says he says you know how
[1:47:02] to talk about he says
[1:47:04] you know if you're tempted he doesn't
[1:47:06] tempt anybody or put anything on anybody
[1:47:09] but makes what a way of escape
[1:47:13] he is our shelter he's our
[1:47:16] escape he is our escape route
[1:47:19] another scripture let's go to the next
[1:47:20] one
[1:47:22] chapter four
[1:47:23] after this revelations chapter four
[1:47:25] after this i looked and behold a door
[1:47:30] was open in heaven
[1:47:33] and a voice which i heard was in that
[1:47:35] word a trumpet talking with me which
[1:47:38] said come hither and i will show you
[1:47:41] things which must be hereafter
[1:47:44] how many times the proper guy told us
[1:47:46] that
[1:47:47] the church goes up
[1:47:49] in revelations the third chapter
[1:47:52] she's taken up there
[1:47:54] he's raptured
[1:47:56] but look at what happens here there was
[1:47:58] an open door
[1:48:00] and
[1:48:02] verse two and immediately i was in the
[1:48:05] spirit and behold a throne was set in
[1:48:07] heaven
[1:48:09] and three
[1:48:10] sat on the throne
[1:48:14] the folks out there can't hear you
[1:48:17] no it doesn't say three
[1:48:20] right
[1:48:21] it says one sat on the throne
[1:48:25] and what happened after this read the
[1:48:26] whole chapter read the next few chapters
[1:48:28] what is it it's the opening up of the
[1:48:31] seals
[1:48:33] a door was open
[1:48:35] god began to pull out his revelation and
[1:48:37] show us the mystery of the whole thing
[1:48:40] how many knows when those seals broke
[1:48:43] there was an opening even brother man
[1:48:45] talked about his ministry was being
[1:48:47] those seals and the revelation of those
[1:48:49] because it was in the days of the voice
[1:48:51] of the seventh angel amen he says as it
[1:48:55] was
[1:48:56] today
[1:48:57] hold on
[1:49:00] since happened since i can't remember it
[1:49:01] i'll just go to it
[1:49:04] i should remember it
[1:49:06] getting older
[1:49:08] 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the
[1:49:10] seventh angel when he shall begin the
[1:49:12] sound
[1:49:14] the mystery of god should be finished as
[1:49:16] he has declared unto his servants the
[1:49:17] prophets
[1:49:18] his ministry was to open up those
[1:49:22] mysteries that god had
[1:49:25] amen remember the angel said go back to
[1:49:28] jeffersonville and the seventh hills
[1:49:30] will be open god began to open up and
[1:49:32] show us
[1:49:33] where we come from what the whole plan
[1:49:35] was
[1:49:36] it was a door to open up and even
[1:49:40] to show you your name
[1:49:44] think about it john how many knows john
[1:49:46] the rebel and he says he saw his name
[1:49:48] and begin to rejoice
[1:49:50] how do you see your name
[1:49:52] how do you see your name this morning
[1:49:55] did somebody want to ask me that
[1:49:56] question brother tell me how do you see
[1:49:58] your name there
[1:50:01] you can see your name when your life
[1:50:03] identifies
[1:50:05] with this word
[1:50:07] i don't believe that
[1:50:08] we are identified with this word
[1:50:12] i'm just glad for that
[1:50:14] now if your life doesn't compare
[1:50:16] if it's a hypocrite or if it's not what
[1:50:19] according to the word you can't really
[1:50:20] identify yourself but when you know that
[1:50:22] christ has come down
[1:50:24] and you have went through the door that
[1:50:26] you're supposed to go through
[1:50:29] amen
[1:50:31] and god has honored you god has had
[1:50:34] respect upon your sacrifice upon what
[1:50:38] your repentance
[1:50:40] amen
[1:50:42] you begin to become identified that you
[1:50:44] are a believer that your name is you are
[1:50:47] a part of the bible you are a part of
[1:50:49] god your name is there
[1:50:50] because of who you identify with what
[1:50:52] you identify with
[1:50:54] remember peter was given what the keys
[1:50:58] plural
[1:51:00] keys to the kingdom
[1:51:03] he's
[1:51:04] maybe there's more in one way but i'm
[1:51:06] talking about how that in a key there's
[1:51:08] different little locks different things
[1:51:11] it has to all line up for it to open the
[1:51:12] door right
[1:51:14] certain way
[1:51:15] when peter on the day of pentecost when
[1:51:17] he had the keys to the kingdom and those
[1:51:20] men began to ask
[1:51:23] they were pricked in their hearts right
[1:51:25] after he peter preached to him and told
[1:51:26] him that they had uh killed the only he
[1:51:29] had to kill killed him
[1:51:31] the messiah and so forth
[1:51:32] then their preakness now what shall we
[1:51:35] do in other words which way are we gonna
[1:51:38] go
[1:51:40] what are we supposed to do
[1:51:43] kind of like when you're in a house ever
[1:51:45] been in somebody's house and you say
[1:51:46] well
[1:51:47] which way do i go out
[1:51:50] or which way is the bathroom or which
[1:51:52] door which which door is the exit here
[1:51:56] right
[1:51:57] which door do i take that's what they
[1:51:59] were asking which door do i take what do
[1:52:01] i got to do to be saved
[1:52:03] what did peter say
[1:52:05] number one
[1:52:07] repent
[1:52:08] right
[1:52:10] that's turn around
[1:52:12] and be baptized in the name
[1:52:15] of the lord jesus christ for the
[1:52:17] remission of sins
[1:52:19] and you shall receive the holy oath
[1:52:23] repentance and remissions of sins and
[1:52:26] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:52:28] that is the true entrance to the
[1:52:31] sheepfold
[1:52:32] how many believes that
[1:52:34] you can't come any other way that's the
[1:52:37] only way to come
[1:52:41] anybody tells you come as you are stay
[1:52:44] as you are
[1:52:45] is
[1:52:47] a
[1:52:48] liar
[1:52:53] you're a liar
[1:52:55] you're demon devil inspired
[1:52:58] how many of you don't stay like you are
[1:53:00] you come as you are that's exactly right
[1:53:02] but you don't stay as you are
[1:53:05] you're not willing to repent
[1:53:08] the fire will never consume your
[1:53:09] sacrifice
[1:53:11] you'll never get the holy ghost
[1:53:13] you'll never get born again in your soul
[1:53:17] no you won't
[1:53:18] you've got to come the right way
[1:53:21] you come by him
[1:53:24] how many know if the devil would come
[1:53:25] the right way
[1:53:27] huh if he'd come the right way
[1:53:30] and get saved like you are then he'd be
[1:53:32] your brother you say shake hands say boy
[1:53:35] god really is generous isn't he
[1:53:37] he really is mercy fellaini
[1:53:40] huh
[1:53:42] that's right but we know he's not gonna
[1:53:43] he don't do that
[1:53:45] huh
[1:53:47] praise be to god
[1:53:48] one more scripture let's go and talk
[1:53:50] about the uh
[1:53:52] the way for a minute he is the door
[1:53:55] and he is the way
[1:53:56] let's take a few minutes on this
[1:53:59] in saint john
[1:54:04] 14
[1:54:05] let not your heart be troubled you
[1:54:06] believe in god believe also in me
[1:54:09] in my father's house or many mansions
[1:54:11] if it were not so
[1:54:13] i would have told you isn't that
[1:54:15] something how did jesus begin to tell
[1:54:16] his disciples that you know in his
[1:54:19] father's house there's big big mansions
[1:54:21] i don't want your heart to be troubled i
[1:54:23] don't want you to be afraid
[1:54:26] let me tell you that this morning
[1:54:28] evening like tabernacle don't let your
[1:54:30] heart be troubled and don't let it be
[1:54:33] afraid
[1:54:35] don't don't let it
[1:54:37] you're in the door you're a part of the
[1:54:39] sheepfold lord willing maybe if the lord
[1:54:42] leads me this way wednesday night we'll
[1:54:43] talk about the good shepherd
[1:54:46] the good shepherd
[1:54:48] but listen he's telling them that i've
[1:54:50] got there's a house there's mansions in
[1:54:52] there
[1:54:53] and i go
[1:54:55] in other words this is the first time
[1:54:57] that the disciples begin to get a little
[1:54:59] worried this is where they begin to not
[1:55:01] like so much about what he was talking
[1:55:03] about because if you'll find out later
[1:55:05] he says you keep talking about going
[1:55:06] away
[1:55:07] we don't like the idea of you going away
[1:55:09] how many people didn't like the idea of
[1:55:11] him going away
[1:55:12] he thought they were going to overthrow
[1:55:14] those
[1:55:15] those
[1:55:16] romans you know and set up a kingdom and
[1:55:19] all of that that wasn't the avenue that
[1:55:20] wasn't the channel
[1:55:22] can we say something this morning and
[1:55:23] that is they had a preconceived idea of
[1:55:26] how things were supposed to go and it
[1:55:28] didn't go that way at all
[1:55:30] boy don't we have that a lot of times
[1:55:32] we have a preconceived idea of hide out
[1:55:34] of being
[1:55:36] and when it's not that way we get
[1:55:37] flustered
[1:55:39] don't get flustered
[1:55:40] say god adjust to my mind to what it's
[1:55:43] supposed to be
[1:55:47] but he begin to tell him that he's going
[1:55:49] to leave him you know i go to prepare a
[1:55:50] place for you
[1:55:53] and if i go and i prepare a place for
[1:55:55] you i will come again and receive you
[1:55:59] unto myself that where i am there be you
[1:56:02] may be also
[1:56:04] the disciples ought to have a jumping
[1:56:06] jubilee running around the pulpits in

[2:01:05] so jesus
[2:01:06] is
[2:01:09] the door
[2:01:11] way
[2:01:12] he is the way
[2:01:14] he is the door
[2:01:18] brother brahm says
[2:01:20] there's only one door to healing
[2:01:22] and jesus is that door
[2:01:24] i am the lord that healeth all thy
[2:01:26] diseases
[2:01:30] i don't care how much penicillin i don't
[2:01:32] care how much medicine you take
[2:01:34] it is still jesus
[2:01:36] that heals you
[2:01:38] so when you get better don't you never
[2:01:41] get better
[2:01:42] without saying thank you jesus for
[2:01:44] healing me
[2:01:48] jesus healed me amen how many has been
[2:01:51] healed by jesus
[2:01:53] every hand in here has been healed by
[2:01:55] jesus if you've lived very long because
[2:01:58] even as children we got sick
[2:02:00] amen and we've been healed
[2:02:02] aren't you be glad for that
[2:02:05] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[2:02:07] you can't go in any other way you can't
[2:02:10] come any other way other than by the
[2:02:12] door of jesus christ you got to come
[2:02:15] through what is that the baptism of the
[2:02:17] holy ghost
[2:02:18] that's who jesus christ is
[2:02:20] he that hath the son hath life he that
[2:02:22] had not the son hath not life
[2:02:25] paul said now they that have not the
[2:02:26] spirit of god
[2:02:28] they are none of his
[2:02:31] he is our healing
[2:02:33] as he says i am the lord thy god that
[2:02:35] heals all thy diseases he is the door to
[2:02:37] heaven and there's no other door no
[2:02:40] other way but through jesus christ
[2:02:42] he is the door
[2:02:44] to heaven
[2:02:47] he says and now jesus is the door to all
[2:02:49] of these things and faith
[2:02:51] is the key that unlocks
[2:02:54] the door
[2:02:57] listen to this
[2:02:59] because i'm sure that we've already been
[2:03:01] unlocked the door to salvation but
[2:03:03] listen to this if jesus is the door
[2:03:06] to all these promises of god faith in
[2:03:09] his finished work
[2:03:11] then faith unlocks every door to every
[2:03:15] treasure that is inside the kingdom
[2:03:19] of god
[2:03:27] if any man i am the door by me if any
[2:03:30] man enter in he shall be saved and
[2:03:33] shall go in and out
[2:03:37] and find
[2:03:40] pasture i mean how many knows it's
[2:03:42] important to have your
[2:03:45] cattle or sheep even that they have
[2:03:47] grass that they have plenty of food they
[2:03:48] don't have food they starve to death if
[2:03:51] you don't aren't coming to christ you
[2:03:53] can't find pasture every good thing is
[2:03:56] opened up to you
[2:03:58] whenever you have faith and you come
[2:03:59] into christ
[2:04:01] you love the lord this morning
[2:04:04] amen then the next verse talks about i
[2:04:06] am the good shepherd perhaps we'll get
[2:04:08] into that next lord willing

[2:04:14] because listen the thief doesn't come
[2:04:16] the devil don't come to bless you he
[2:04:18] don't come to make you better and may
[2:04:20] give you a better life

[2:04:24] to steal your joy
[2:04:27] to kill you
[2:04:28] give you a sorrow heartache
[2:04:31] he's he's got a troll of treasure
[2:04:34] himself but his
[2:04:36] treasure is depression
[2:04:39] it's sorrow it's emptiness
[2:04:42] it's death
[2:04:44] amen
[2:04:46] oh not much of a treasure is it
[2:04:50] amen
[2:04:53] praise the lord
[2:04:57] all right let's stand if you will this
[2:04:58] morning
[2:05:08] the last door
[2:05:10] in closing that i want to talk about for
[2:05:11] just a minute
[2:05:13] found in revelations 3
[2:05:18] where jesus said behold
[2:05:20] i stand at the door
[2:05:22] and knock
[2:05:23] if any man hear my voice and open up
[2:05:26] i will come into him
[2:05:28] and will set with him
[2:05:31] and he
[2:05:33] with

[2:05:51] it might be when you're driving down the
[2:05:52] road
[2:05:54] just meditating on something and all of
[2:05:56] a sudden the door will knock the lord
[2:05:58] will say something to you that's you
[2:06:00] know it's only the lord saying something
[2:06:02] to you
[2:06:03] but he'll be knocking
[2:06:04] he comes on knocking on your door
[2:06:07] and it's up to you whether you open up
[2:06:09] to him
[2:06:10] and let him
[2:06:11] into your house
[2:06:13] open up that avenue
[2:06:15] open up the door of your heart the door
[2:06:17] of your mind
[2:06:19] say lord jesus come in
[2:06:21] ask yourself this morning this question
[2:06:23] have you opened every door of your heart
[2:06:26] and open it up and say lord jesus

[2:06:30] doorknock you want to gain entrance to
[2:06:33] ours

[2:06:36] picture
[2:06:38] of a door

[2:06:43] side no doorknob
[2:06:45] and the critic says you know it's a
[2:06:46] great picture of jesus knocking on the
[2:06:48] door but what in the world happened here
[2:06:50] we ain't got no doorknob
[2:06:53] he says no it's meant to be that way
[2:06:56] he don't just push his way in or kick
[2:06:57] the door down he knocks
[2:07:00] and you're the only one that can turn
[2:07:02] that handle

[2:08:17] partake of his communion this morning
[2:08:19] god what an honor it is to be able to
[2:08:21] remember what you did for us on calvary
[2:08:24] lord we would have been out there in the
[2:08:25] world
[2:08:26] we'd have been out in sin and drugs and
[2:08:28] everything else lord there had never
[2:08:30] been a way for us to get free of that
[2:08:33] if it would have been for the door that
[2:08:34] you yourself come and opened
[2:08:38] made available to us
[2:08:40] father we thank you lord jesus for your
[2:08:42] mercy and grace
[2:08:43] we ask god come into our hearts leaving
[2:08:46] us and have your way now and as we
[2:08:48] change the order to service this morning
[2:08:49] we ask god that you'll bless the
[2:08:51] communion that we're about to take
[2:08:53] in the name of jesus christ is remember
[2:08:55] you
[2:08:56] amen and amen open your bibles if you
[2:08:58] will we'll just get into the communion
[2:09:00] part
[2:09:01] over into
[2:09:02] first corinthians
[2:09:14] first corinthians 11.
[2:09:20] verse 23 paul says for i have received
[2:09:22] the lord that which also i delivered
[2:09:24] unto you that the lord jesus the same
[2:09:26] night in which he was betrayed took
[2:09:29] bread
[2:09:30] and when he had given thanks he break it
[2:09:32] and said take eat this is my body which
[2:09:34] is broken for you
[2:09:35] this dude in remembrance of me after the
[2:09:38] same manner also he took the cup and
[2:09:39] when he had subbed
[2:09:41] saying this cup is the new testament in
[2:09:43] my blood this do you as often as you
[2:09:45] drink it in remembrance of me
[2:09:47] for as often as you eat this bread and
[2:09:49] drink of this cup you do show the lord's
[2:09:51] death till he come
[2:09:52] wherefore whosoever shall eat of this
[2:09:54] bread and drink of this cup of the lord
[2:09:56] unworthy shall be guilty of the body and
[2:09:58] blood of the lord but let a man examine
[2:10:01] himself and so let him eat of that bread
[2:10:03] and drink of that cup
[2:10:05] for he that eateth and drinketh
[2:10:06] unworthily eateth and drink of damnation
[2:10:08] to himself not discerning the lord's
[2:10:10] body
[2:10:11] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[2:10:13] among you and many sleep
[2:10:15] for we would judge ourselves we should
[2:10:17] not be judged but when we are judged we
[2:10:19] are chastened of the lord that we should
[2:10:21] not be condemned with the world
[2:10:23] wherefore my brethren when you come
[2:10:24] together
[2:10:26] to eat tarry one for another and if any
[2:10:28] man hunger let him eat at home that you
[2:10:29] come not together
[2:10:31] unto condemnation and the rest i said in
[2:10:33] order
[2:10:35] when i come let's have a more a moment
[2:10:37] of silence
[2:10:38] as you judge yourselves confess all your
[2:10:40] sins and make sure you're right before
[2:10:42] the lord
[2:10:43] before coming and taking of the
[2:10:44] communion
[2:11:06] amen amen
[2:11:07] all those that want to partake of the
[2:11:09] communion come over to our right like we
[2:11:10] usually do the remain can be seated
[2:11:13] if you want to
