[7:59] fire David corset
[8:15] commitment
[8:17] and um
[8:18] Psalms 57
[8:21] I will start with yeah verse one of
[8:24] course
[8:24] be merciful unto me o God be merciful
[8:28] unto me for my soul trusteth in me yea
[8:32] in the shadow of thy Wings well I'm will
[8:35] I make my refuge and until these
[8:38] calamities be overpassed
[8:48] he shall send from heaven and save me
[8:50] from the reproach of him that would
[8:53] swallow me up Salah God shall send forth
[8:58] his Mercy in his truth
[9:06] okay

[9:31] my heart is fixed oh God my heart is

[9:37] right now
[9:43] I will praise thee O Lord among the
[9:46] people I will sing unto thee among the
[9:49] Nations
[9:55] this last one together be thou exalted o
[9:58] God above the heavens let thy glory be
[10:01] above all the Earth
[10:03] Amen brother Brian
[10:15] brothers and sisters
[10:19] you know that Psalm was just read you
[10:21] know what the enemy decides to use his
[10:24] evil against you God turns it against
[10:26] him
[10:27] so
[10:29] isn't that a comforting thought whatever
[10:31] your enemies out there are trying to
[10:33] devise against you God will use their
[10:36] own snare the snare they're trying to
[10:38] use against you be the snare that God
[10:40] will destroy them with if you return
[10:42] with me to uh John the eighth chapter
[10:55] foreign
[10:59] there we go
[11:04] you know I was just thinking there this
[11:06] morning
[11:07] you know you can compare yourself you
[11:09] prepare yourself all your life for a day
[11:12] or whatever you're going to do you can
[11:13] prepare for it
[11:15] but if God ain't in it it doesn't mean
[11:17] anything whatever you think you might
[11:19] say or what you're not going to say it
[11:22] doesn't mean anything unless God
[11:24] I was in it so everything that we do as
[11:27] Christians is individuals serving the
[11:29] lord it depends on one thing and one
[11:31] thing only the spirit of Jesus Christ
[11:33] abiding in our hearts and lives and I
[11:35] was reading here in the eighth chapter
[11:37] of John but I was sitting there thinking
[11:39] you know there's three levels we're at
[11:42] uh right now you're either
[11:44] living below your privileges this
[11:47] morning when you came here you're living
[11:48] at your privileges or you're so embraced
[11:52] the purposes that God gives you that
[11:54] you're living above those privileges
[11:56] right now and
[11:57] only you can tell where you're at
[12:00] whether you're living alone or you're
[12:02] living above them but you don't
[12:04] have to be that way I mean God has made
[12:08] a way for you all this morning to live
[12:09] in the Privileges he's provided for you
[12:12] through Jesus Christ this morning and to
[12:14] even reach out in faith and try to live
[12:15] above those privileges that God has for
[12:17] us but uh this is I was reading this
[12:21] this morning
[12:22] reading a lot of
[12:23] like
[12:25] this morning you know he has series of
[12:28] messages he preaches and I was re you
[12:32] know I've been
[12:33] in my office he's got several messages
[12:36] on investments I was listening to but
[12:39] the thing that struck me about
[12:40] prophetically how he was speaking you
[12:43] know in our day and he was freaking
[12:46] um
[12:47] and I was I just wrote my own note about
[12:49] it and he was telling the people your
[12:51] vices will kill you whatever your vices
[12:54] are this morning if you don't get the
[12:56] victory over them this morning they'll
[12:58] be the thing that destroys you on that
[13:00] day and uh everyone has their own
[13:03] their own weaknesses that they have to
[13:05] struggle with every day but if you don't
[13:07] get a control of them and you don't let
[13:10] Jesus Christ minister to you to remove
[13:12] them from you they'll be the very thing
[13:14] that destroys you and just like I was
[13:16] saying earlier about having snares you
[13:18] don't want those snares that the enemy
[13:20] sets before you to be the thing that you
[13:22] get trapped in but I was I was just
[13:24] listening to what he had to say this
[13:26] morning
[13:27] and you know this is I mean I'm 63 years
[13:31] old and so he's preaching this message
[13:33] almost 60 years ago and he was talking
[13:36] about drunk driving and I'm listening to
[13:39] him you know I wasn't 20 years old in
[13:42] 1959 but if you told a grown man in 1959
[13:46] that if he got caught Punk driving that
[13:48] he needed to be in prison for 10 years
[13:50] I'm sure a 20 year old in 1959 or 1960
[13:55] would have thought that was a horrible
[13:56] thing that he shouldn't be accountable
[13:59] for his bad behavior
[14:00] and then I was listening you know that's
[14:03] prophetic where where we're at today if
[14:05] you get caught drunk driving you're not
[14:08] going to be driving anymore if you
[14:09] accidentally kill somebody while you're
[14:11] drunk driving then you're going to jail
[14:13] for a long time and he was speaking this
[14:15] back in 1959 and 1960 and I was he was
[14:19] also talking about
[14:22] a lot of times let me let me just read
[14:24] before I just spend the whole time
[14:25] talking here let me read what I was
[14:27] reading this morning
[14:29] and he in his eighth chapter of John
[14:31] there's a lot of different areas in this
[14:34] eighth chapter but I'm going to start
[14:37] about the 21st verse of the eighth
[14:40] chapter of John you know no it doesn't
[14:42] mean anything unless you project God's
[14:44] word and he goes on to say here then say
[14:47] Jesus again unto them I go my way and
[14:49] you shall seek me and shall die in your
[14:52] sins whether I go you cannot come and
[14:55] then he's talking about the Pharisees
[14:57] and Sadducees it's no different today
[15:00] for people today and he says then said
[15:03] the Jews will kill himself because he
[15:05] says whether I go you cannot come and he
[15:07] said unto them ye are from beneath and I
[15:10] am from about year of this world and I
[15:13] am not of this world
[15:14] I said therefore unto you that ye shall
[15:17] die in your sins for you believe not
[15:18] that I am he and you shall die in your
[15:21] sins it hasn't changed today it's that
[15:23] scripture means the same thing today as
[15:25] we did two thousand years ago you either
[15:28] embrace the truth of the out and the
[15:30] word of God or the same judgment will be
[15:32] upon you he goes on to say then say they
[15:35] unto him who art thou and Jesus saith
[15:37] unto them even the same I said unto you
[15:40] from the beginning so they just couldn't
[15:42] hear his words
[15:44] um you can say well they weren't
[15:46] predestinated to hear it or whatever it
[15:48] is they just want receiving the seed as
[15:50] he was given it and he goes on many many
[15:53] things I have many things to say and to
[15:56] judge of you but he that sent me is true
[15:59] and I speak to the to the world those
[16:01] things which I have heard of him
[16:03] they understood not that he spake of
[16:05] them of the father then Jesus said unto
[16:07] them
[16:09] when ye have lifted up the son of man
[16:11] then shall ye know that I am he or that
[16:14] I do nothing of myself but as the father
[16:17] hath taught me I speak these things
[16:19] and he that hath sent me is with me and
[16:21] the father has
[16:23] has not left me alone for I do always
[16:26] those things that please him and I know
[16:29] that's where you all want to be this
[16:31] morning everything you do you want to do
[16:32] to please him and he spake these words
[16:34] many believe on him
[16:36] then Jesus said to those Jews which
[16:39] believed on him if you continue in my
[16:41] words then ye are my disciples indeed
[16:44] and you shall know the truth and the
[16:46] truth shall make you free and that's
[16:48] where we're at this morning
[16:49] you if the truth is in your heart
[16:52] turning abiding in you it's made you
[16:54] free this morning doesn't mean that you
[16:56] don't have struggles no it doesn't mean
[16:58] that but you have the earnest of the
[17:01] believing in what God has provided for
[17:03] us this morning and I was just I'll just
[17:05] sit down as if I was listening to those
[17:07] uh
[17:09] to those messages
[17:11] and he was talking about natural
[17:13] business
[17:15] but he really was talking in a spiritual
[17:17] sense and uh I know I don't mean to be
[17:21] funny but you know a lot of times you
[17:23] think you can make a quick Buck or a
[17:25] quick dollar but I just rubbed my it's
[17:28] not as good as it seems you know when
[17:31] someone's trying you sell you something
[17:33] you always got to think in yourself it's
[17:35] not as good as it seems to be on the
[17:38] outside and what he means by that is any
[17:41] good businessman if he's got a
[17:43] perspective or he has an investment or
[17:46] maybe a new business that he's going to
[17:48] open up he'll do a business plan and
[17:51] that business plan and he'll do the
[17:52] research that's required to whether that
[17:56] business will be successful whether that
[17:58] investment will be successful but as
[18:00] Christians you're no different and it's
[18:02] not a business plan but for you to be
[18:05] successful you have to apply the
[18:06] principal that God in his word gave to
[18:09] us to be successful you know like
[18:11] brother Brian said your ABCs you always
[18:13] believe Christ you have to have those
[18:14] principles and that investment will come
[18:17] back to you and then he and he was
[18:20] basically saying there's only one way
[18:22] about it there's only way that you'll be
[18:24] successful in anything you do is if you
[18:26] put the word of God before you and you
[18:28] walk in it but the I'll finish with this
[18:31] thought I don't have a lot to say this
[18:33] morning and I meant not to say that you
[18:35] know everyone when they get to when they
[18:37] grow wherever you're from you'll have
[18:40] acronyms I don't know if that's too big
[18:42] of a word that you find yourself you try
[18:45] not to reuse those things every day in
[18:47] your life but sometimes you can only be
[18:49] what you are but what I thought was
[18:51] funny about what Rhonda Brown was saying
[18:54] and it really speaks to the the day that
[18:57] we're in right now
[19:01] later whatever it is
[19:04] that
[19:05] we would be
[19:08] man of God doesn't steal other sheep and
[19:11] I was just thinking about that you know
[19:14] you don't try to
[19:15] cross our people to your need or to your
[19:18] cause you just present the gospel and
[19:21] you let Jesus Christ pray
[19:23] we're about to change in people's heart
[19:25] and lives you know it's I know it's the
[19:28] world that we live in it's growing
[19:30] churches making they want a thousand
[19:32] people in their Church you know but
[19:34] brother Randall we said I'd rather have
[19:36] three that believe the word of God than
[19:37] have a thousand they don't you know your
[19:40] church reflects basically
[19:43] everything about a church is reflected
[19:45] not on it the pastor of I don't know
[19:48] where I'm going it's not really the
[19:50] pastors the ministry for the church but
[19:53] if you don't have people believing the
[19:55] word of God where Jesus Christ is
[19:56] abiding in the heart and lives of those
[19:59] people that if it's like the pastor's
[20:01] trying to hurt cats basically it's just
[20:04] having a whole bunch of cats there
[20:06] with no purpose they're all gone
[20:09] oh it's in Jesus
[20:11] Jesus Christ everything online correctly

[56:09] shine before

[56:12] and glorify God in heaven Lord now Lord
[56:15] we ask God that you'll bless the
[56:16] meditation of our heart and that which
[56:18] we feel you laid upon our heart and come
[56:20] into exceedingly abundantly above all
[56:21] that we could ask us think in Jesus
[56:23] Christ's name amen and amen amen
[56:28] in Philippians if you want to go to
[56:31] Philippians the third chapter
[56:35] 10.
[56:44] we'll begin with uh verse 7 chapter 3
[56:48] the Philippians
[56:50] Philippians 3 and begin with verse seven
[56:53] but what things were gained to me those
[56:56] I counted lost for Christ yet doubtless
[56:59] I have I count
[57:01] all things but loss for the Excellency
[57:03] of the knowledge of Christ my lord for
[57:06] whom I have suffered the loss of all
[57:08] things and do count them but down
[57:11] that I may win Christ and be found in
[57:14] him having not my own righteousness
[57:15] which is in the law but that which is
[57:17] through the Faith of Christ the
[57:19] righteousness which is of god by faith
[57:21] that I may know him and the power of his
[57:24] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[57:26] sufferings being made conformable unto
[57:28] his death if by any means I might attain
[57:32] unto the resurrection of the Dead I want
[57:34] you to understand what Paul is talking
[57:36] about he's talking about attaining to
[57:38] something isn't that right amen
[57:40] possessing something getting to
[57:42] something receiving something making a
[57:45] goal getting somewhere
[57:47] isn't that right amen if by any means
[57:51] I'm not attaining to the resurrection of
[57:53] the Dead not as though I had already
[57:55] attained amen either were already
[57:59] perfect amen I didn't even realize that
[58:02] what word was in there I see why the
[58:03] Holy Spirit went in there because I'm
[58:05] gonna talk about that for quite a bit
[58:07] already even though I were not yet
[58:09] already perfect but I follow after if
[58:11] that I may apprehend that for which I
[58:14] also am apprehended in Christ Brethren I
[58:17] count myself not as has to having
[58:19] apprehended but there's one thing I do
[58:21] forgetting of things which are behind
[58:23] and reaching forth unto those things
[58:25] which are before I pressed towards to
[58:28] mark for the prize of the High Calling
[58:31] of God in Christ Jesus let us therefore
[58:35] as many as be perfect be thus minded
[58:39] amen and if there be any other things
[58:41] otherwise might have got will reveal
[58:43] even this to you the way I read that is
[58:46] if all those that desire Perfection you
[58:49] need to have this mindset
[58:51] how many believes you got to have a
[58:53] mindset for perfection
[58:55] amen
[58:57] amen so that's one one just one of the
[59:00] things that I really desire and want to
[59:03] have amen and that is to come to that
[59:05] Perfection that Jesus told and wanted
[59:10] and desired of us to have how many
[59:12] believes that Jesus wants us to be
[59:14] perfect amen perfect in Christ and
[59:17] there's a big difference of course we've
[59:18] got to realize amen that in the flesh
[59:21] you'll make mistakes but in the spirit
[59:22] you can walk I believe that a man can
[59:24] walk perfectly with God
[59:26] amen Joshua chapter 1.
[59:34] Joshua chapter 1.
[59:38] I hope you have a tab because I don't
[59:40] have him in my new Bible I'm going to
[59:42] see if they sell those little tabs that
[59:43] I can stick on there and make my make me
[59:46] a set of tabs I gotta have them tapped
[59:47] I'm spoiled
[59:50] amen now after the death of Moses the
[59:53] servant of the Lord wait a minute now
[59:56] after the death of Moses the servant of
[59:58] the Lord it came to pass that the Lord
[1:00:00] spake unto Joshua the son of none Moses
[1:00:03] Minister saying Moses my servant is dead
[1:00:05] now therefore arise and go over this
[1:00:08] Jordan thou and all this people unto the
[1:00:11] land which I give them even to the
[1:00:13] children of Israel every place that the
[1:00:16] soul of your foot shall tread that have
[1:00:19] I given unto you even as I said unto
[1:00:23] Moses amen may God add His blessings to
[1:00:25] reading of the word you can be seated
[1:00:27] this morning amen we all know that this
[1:00:30] was a type amen of uh and a new
[1:00:33] testament promise amen
[1:00:36] amen and that new testament is the
[1:00:38] promise of the Holy Ghost amen the Holy
[1:00:40] Ghost is a Promised Land amen I believe
[1:00:43] it was in Acts 2 38 he talks about it
[1:00:45] you repent and be baptized in the name
[1:00:47] of Jesus Christ amen you shall receive
[1:00:49] the gift of the Holy Ghost for he says
[1:00:52] for the promise is to you to your
[1:00:54] children
[1:00:55] to them that are far off
[1:00:58] amen even as many as the Lord Our God
[1:01:01] shall cause so the New Testament
[1:01:03] promised of course and we talk about
[1:01:05] this a lot and I believe that it's
[1:01:06] essential that we do talk about
[1:01:09] because we really don't emphasize we
[1:01:11] don't really grasp I don't think
[1:01:13] sometimes as I were thinking you know
[1:01:15] that the importance and the greatness of
[1:01:18] the Holy the indwelling Holy Spirit In
[1:01:22] God's people
[1:01:23] in you and in me amen when you don't
[1:01:27] realize how important that is how great
[1:01:30] that is amen and I wanted to say you
[1:01:33] know even even Christ when he was
[1:01:35] speaking of it and then he talks about
[1:01:37] how that you know uh this morning as we
[1:01:40] talk about possessing the land and amen
[1:01:42] to battle and you have to fight and you
[1:01:45] know to get these possessions Amen to
[1:01:47] get the possession that God has promised
[1:01:49] you Amen brother says brother Footprints
[1:01:52] means possession ministering better
[1:01:54] don't be afraid to put Footprints where
[1:01:56] God has told you to go it's possession
[1:01:59] he told Joshua everywhere The Souls of
[1:02:01] your feet said it's yours amen we don't
[1:02:05] back up we take what God said that it's
[1:02:08] the truth no matter what the opposition
[1:02:10] is how great it seems well how difficult
[1:02:13] it seems if God said so it's yours
[1:02:17] amen praise be to God listen when he
[1:02:20] gave it to Joshua he said never said he
[1:02:22] said I'll take all he bites and the
[1:02:24] Palestine and all in our out and so
[1:02:26] forth and give it to your Joshua had to
[1:02:29] fight for every inch of ground amen but
[1:02:32] God was with him and every inch of
[1:02:35] ground you'll cover brother you've got
[1:02:38] to make Footprints you fight for every
[1:02:41] way every go all the way through you'll
[1:02:43] fight for it but take the severe the
[1:02:46] spirit The Sword and the spirit brother
[1:02:47] and move right on praise be to God how
[1:02:52] many believes that I don't care I
[1:02:54] believe that this message this morning
[1:02:56] is for somebody perhaps it's just
[1:02:58] starting in the Lord it could be for
[1:03:00] something that hadn't even started in
[1:03:02] the low but it can be for a person
[1:03:04] that's been going like me for I don't
[1:03:06] know how many years so many I forget how
[1:03:08] many years I've been serving the lord
[1:03:09] now but it
[1:03:17] it one thing I know is that I'm
[1:03:20] forgetting to pass it I'm still trying
[1:03:22] to make go
[1:03:26] come on
[1:03:29] amen praise be to God another thing I
[1:03:33] thought about thinking about
[1:03:35] realized what God has given us the hope
[1:03:38] that we have
[1:03:42] not only the hope that we have but the
[1:03:44] god that we have the promises that we
[1:03:46] have everything that is yours
[1:03:53] amen I listened to the message
[1:03:55] possessing the Gate of the enemy after
[1:03:57] trial and better man was talking about
[1:03:59] and he's talking about how that you know
[1:04:01] uh you know and owner wasn't that one it
[1:04:03] was um
[1:04:04] uh possessing all things I mean listen
[1:04:08] to the other one also but it was in
[1:04:10] possessing all things they talked about
[1:04:11] how that and then you might be a
[1:04:13] powerful you might be poor you may not
[1:04:16] have nothing but the Bible says that all
[1:04:18] things are yours
[1:04:20] amen
[1:04:22] whether things present or whether things
[1:04:25] in the future whether it's Paul or
[1:04:26] whether it's cephas or if it's Apollos
[1:04:28] amen whether things present future amen
[1:04:31] all things are yours
[1:04:34] everything I mean as you both know you

[1:04:44] my
[1:04:45] and I thought people you know people
[1:04:47] think they're rich
[1:04:48] people think they're a billionaire
[1:04:50] they're rich
[1:04:51] and I thought you know I with a whole
[1:04:53] lot it's worth more than a billion
[1:04:56] dollars to me to have peace of mind
[1:05:01] Amen to have peace with God it's worth
[1:05:03] more than the billion dollars it meant
[1:05:06] millions of dollars all of that it don't
[1:05:08] never compare to have peace in your
[1:05:11] heart
[1:05:12] to be able to sleep at night and to know
[1:05:14] where you come from and oh where are you
[1:05:16] going I didn't pay a million billions of
[1:05:18] dollars
[1:05:19] remember brother Bob talked about the
[1:05:21] evil queen one time he says and you know
[1:05:24] she would have guessed that she
[1:05:25] would give her okay
[1:05:26] think how much you could have five more
[1:05:29] minutes of life
[1:05:32] huh
[1:05:33] maybe she was an evil queen maybe she
[1:05:36] needed five more get things right with
[1:05:37] God that's the most horrible thing that
[1:05:40] ever can happen to a human being is to
[1:05:42] leave this world without God
[1:05:44] amen
[1:05:46] it forfeit their whole Kingdom
[1:05:49] so this morning I want you to know amen
[1:05:51] it takes a giving all like brother Brian

[1:05:54] want to get something from God you got
[1:05:56] to give it to you all
[1:06:04] until you make room for him you've got
[1:06:07] to make moon for him

[1:06:46] it's time to have a possession not just
[1:06:49] a confession

[1:07:51] and I am just feeling good in my legs to
[1:07:54] say that God gives you those reset what
[1:07:57] if he didn't give you those resets

[1:08:50] the surface of this when you study you
[1:08:52] realize hey you were just tapping the
[1:08:53] surface of it you know what comes to my
[1:08:55] mind with Thomas Byler my mind I get to
[1:08:58] thinking about how so you know the only
[1:09:01] way that you're ever going to get more
[1:09:03] is is to take more time in it
[1:09:06] because I get so busy with everything
[1:09:07] else
[1:09:09] huh and so Holy Spirit tells me you know
[1:09:12] you got to be less busy
[1:09:14] oh can I just preach the simple gospel
[1:09:17] we need to be more like Walmart
[1:09:22] we need to roll back some things
[1:09:25] it's time to roll back some of the
[1:09:28] things that you're doing and make more
[1:09:29] time for God
[1:09:31] it's rollback time amen roll back the
[1:09:33] things in the world and bring on the
[1:09:35] things that this man

[1:09:57] spirit is just as real
[1:09:59] but you got to want to possess you got
[1:10:01] to go in there comes a time I mean as it
[1:10:03] comes a time like it did there with
[1:10:05] Joshua now look the past
[1:10:07] pass but Joshua When God says go forward
[1:10:10] you go forward

[1:10:24] that it's time to go in and to possess
[1:10:27] the land everything that God has brought

[1:23:04] out about this whole thing
[1:23:07] whenever the prophet had preached on
[1:23:10] possessing the enemy's gate
[1:23:12] he went to the word of God
[1:23:14] and he went to a promise of God
[1:23:17] and God told Abraham
[1:23:19] your seed
[1:23:21] Shout
[1:23:23] possess the gates of its enemies
[1:23:27] you are ordained to take it from the
[1:23:29] devil you are

[1:23:35] I don't know but you can't help it God
[1:23:37] puts it in there
[1:23:38] he ordains you to take the devil's gates
[1:23:41] from it
[1:23:50] well it's nothing but hope and joy think
[1:23:53] about this life is depressing and sorrow
[1:23:55] and sadness
[1:23:56] but this is Hope and joy
[1:24:00] amen
[1:24:02] I see shall listen get possessed the

[1:24:43] God has blessed most of us with good
[1:24:45] businesses
[1:24:46] good finances most of us
[1:24:49] hello
[1:24:50] but you know I think it's time to cut
[1:24:52] back a little bit
[1:24:53] make sure your business doesn't take
[1:24:55] away time from God
[1:24:57] you're smart enough to get rich on
[1:24:58] business this isn't everything else it's
[1:25:00] time to be smart enough to make sure
[1:25:02] that your spirit is ready to meet the
[1:25:04] Lord in 2023 and if that means cutting
[1:25:07] back a little cut back
[1:25:09] we got time to pay for the service time
[1:25:12] climb to pray for the man of God cause
[1:25:14] I'll tell you right now the problem to
[1:25:16] God tell when the man of God back there
[1:25:17] praying the way he ought to pray and
[1:25:19] then expecting of God and you are out
[1:25:20] here expecting from God when he comes
[1:25:22] forth and he speaks it's DNA speaking
[1:25:27] speaking
[1:25:32] to the church
[1:25:42] quick this lollygagging as you might say
[1:25:44] no more Wows you Ozzy wooing
[1:25:47] huh
[1:25:50] oh praise the Lord
[1:25:54] you love the Lord this morning
[1:25:55] [Applause]
[1:25:57] notice this no more wazzy wooing
[1:26:01] he told Joshua
[1:26:03] every place that the soul of your feet
[1:26:05] treads that I have given you
[1:26:09] well let me tell you I think one of the
[1:26:10] greatest things that we can possess of
[1:26:11] course is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:13] if you abide in me and I in you
[1:26:17] you shall what
[1:26:19] ask what you will
[1:26:22] I believe this morning that you and I in
[1:26:25] 2023 we can walk like Enoch walked
[1:26:30] how did he walk the Bible says that he
[1:26:33] had this testimony
[1:26:34] before I left that he
[1:26:37] please God
[1:26:40] please God that's what we want we want
[1:26:42] to be pleasing him we want to walk back
[1:26:45] in our God
[1:26:52] Jesus says Be You perfect
[1:26:55] Paul said you know
[1:26:57] I fail at Birth
[1:26:59] and for you until Christ deformed in you
[1:27:03] is that right
[1:27:04] how many wants more of God listen to
[1:27:06] this
[1:27:08] even
[1:27:11] Paul says he gave some Apostles and some
[1:27:13] prophets and some evangelists and
[1:27:15] pastors and teachers
[1:27:16] for the imperfecting himself for the
[1:27:19] perfecting of the Saints
[1:27:20] I believe now you
[1:27:23] oh my how many knows did you just need a
[1:27:25] closer walk
[1:27:26] you need to be perfectly in Christ
[1:27:30] that's why I believe this morning that
[1:27:32] it'll probably touch each and every last
[1:27:33] one of us and maybe because we can all
[1:27:36] go a little deeper in Christ
[1:27:38] that we need to give more of ourselves
[1:27:40] more surrendered to class than what we
[1:27:43] are every aspect of our life to be
[1:27:45] surrendered to God because that's what
[1:27:48] it takes to be surrendered to be
[1:27:49] pleasing to the Lord It's a complete
[1:27:51] surrender to God
[1:27:55] oh my
[1:27:56] God I have given you Footprints meant
[1:27:59] Victory and it's the same thing tonight
[1:28:01] if you're paralyzed and you can't wiggle

[1:28:06] finger that's right you promised me I

[1:40:56] in sin right after eight consent they
[1:40:59] had a mighty Victory I mean they took
[1:41:01] dereko and not even a scratch not a
[1:41:03] Band-Aid nobody got hurt nobody got
[1:41:04] killed not even a scratch
[1:41:06] and then he says after Aiken took that
[1:41:08] wedge and he wasn't supposed to and then
[1:41:09] 36 men lost their lives they presumed
[1:41:12] they went up to Eli I believe it was AI
[1:41:16] or something like that they went up
[1:41:17] there to fight against them and just a
[1:41:18] small group and they only send a small
[1:41:20] bunch and guess what they came back with
[1:41:21] 36 men dead
[1:41:23] let me tell you something that's sad
[1:41:24] that's sorrow
[1:41:26] that's not victory
[1:41:28] no that's what is in that's boy
[1:41:30] that's a terrible place to be it's a
[1:41:32] living defeat
[1:41:34] amen
[1:41:36] and they had to get that thing cleaned
[1:41:37] out and scouted out
[1:41:40] oh my you better get rid of that thing
[1:41:43] that that hurts you that thing that
[1:41:45] overcomes you better get rid of that
[1:41:47] thing
[1:41:47] huh
[1:41:49] because guess what God didn't listen
[1:41:51] very merciful the Aiken his wife his
[1:41:53] family his children and all that belongs
[1:41:55] to me all that stone
[1:41:58] they killed them all get rid of that
[1:42:00] evil ammonia can we say
[1:42:02] May that Lord give us victory over any
[1:42:04] evil in our life
[1:42:06] anything that's wrong get rid of it
[1:42:09] Hallelujah
[1:42:12] another thing this is kind of for the
[1:42:14] young people
[1:42:16] Brother Band went and seen a stadium
[1:42:18] remember he went into a certain stadium
[1:42:20] and it had a saying over the top he says
[1:42:22] it's not the size of the dog in the
[1:42:23] fight but it's the size of the fighting
[1:42:25] the dog
[1:42:26] folks I'm here to tell you young people
[1:42:32] it isn't your size
[1:42:34] young men it isn't whether you're a real
[1:42:36] tall dark and handsome you might be a
[1:42:38] scruffy looking little fella
[1:42:40] huh but a bam said that David was a
[1:42:43] ruddy looking little fella Sam's in the
[1:42:45] Ruddy little it ain't what she looks
[1:42:46] like
[1:42:47] it's probably what's in here young
[1:42:50] ladies it's not whether you are the most
[1:42:51] beauty queen that's not what it's all
[1:42:53] about
[1:42:53] but it's what's on the inside that
[1:42:55] counts what makes a difference having a
[1:42:57] standard and loving the Lord that's
[1:42:59] worth more than any beauty loving the
[1:43:01] Lord for a young man it's more than
[1:43:03] handsomeness and beauty
[1:43:06] isn't that right
[1:43:09] it's not portion to what you look like
[1:43:11] or what you are it's or or these things
[1:43:13] don't have a complex
[1:43:16] Hallelujah you love the Lord
[1:43:19] oh I'm so happy for that amen
[1:43:22] Glory now notice this aren't you happy
[1:43:24] this morning he got to talk about it
[1:43:26] Christ conquered it all let me just say
[1:43:28] this
[1:43:30] I don't guess I got my paper today
[1:43:33] yeah I did
[1:43:34] I already read it but talking about
[1:43:36] having to fight
[1:43:37] how many believes that deer fight even
[1:43:39] as brother Phil was here when he spoke
[1:43:41] about he says you know the main fight
[1:43:43] that you have is where your battle is
[1:43:45] right here
[1:43:46] so when you gotta fight for every inch
[1:43:49] you don't have to fight some demonized
[1:43:51] some bad Spirit you gotta fight this
[1:43:53] self
[1:43:54] this is where you gotta fat this is
[1:43:56] where you gotta battle
[1:43:57] if you can go overcome that thing and
[1:44:00] you can whip yourself and I do realize
[1:44:02] that till your dying day you're gonna
[1:44:04] have a battle because that thing will
[1:44:05] always want to resurrect and all I
[1:44:08] always want to come back but you can get
[1:44:09] it so whipped under the Holy Ghost until
[1:44:11] the desires of synagogue

[1:44:20] it'll come back on you if you let it
[1:44:22] sure if you're drawn away with your own
[1:44:24] lusts the Bible says to induce and so
[1:44:26] forth in the Lord it brings forth sin
[1:44:28] but if you can oh God help us in the
[1:44:30] property God say you man can't live in
[1:44:32] such a way until God the Devils don't

[1:50:12] right and the Very things that he did

[1:50:28] Hallelujah don't you just love it
[1:50:30] possessing the gates of our enemies
[1:50:33] come
[1:50:35] like Jesus Christ
[1:50:39] I had a thought that I'm going to say
[1:50:42] that you have to be careful about your
[1:50:43] attitude Towers
[1:50:45] so be careful
[1:50:47] yesterday I was just doing things on the
[1:50:49] farm and so forth and
[1:50:51] doing this that or the other and
[1:50:53] staying busy doing whatever and
[1:50:56] think about the Lord and
[1:50:59] the thought came to me
[1:51:01] that if I'm going to do something
[1:51:04] I would want to do it I would ask a
[1:51:05] question what would brother Branham do
[1:51:11] what would brother Branham do
[1:51:15] what would better Brandon do well you
[1:51:16] know we have to say what would Jesus do
[1:51:18] right
[1:51:20] I thought well that's that's strange
[1:51:22] isn't it
[1:51:23] you know if if he wasn't careful might
[1:51:26] offend somebody well because we're
[1:51:28] supposed to see what Jesus would do
[1:51:30] but I went back and I thought you know
[1:51:32] Paul said follow me
[1:51:35] and then another place he says the
[1:51:36] things that you have seen in me the
[1:51:38] thing too
[1:51:39] he told Timothy Paul said
[1:51:43] but you see me
[1:51:45] after Jesus
[1:51:47] Paul said follow me do as I do I believe
[1:51:49] it'd be all right
[1:51:51] well I want to ask about doing this
[1:51:53] situation I believe he'll be all right
[1:51:55] don't you
[1:51:56] that's right because we know where he
[1:51:58] was with God
[1:52:00] amen if I have a goal and I've had the
[1:52:02] mission number one is to be like Christ
[1:52:04] and also if you'll notice he said
[1:52:06] brother random was our leader and you
[1:52:08] look to him and you realize that God was
[1:52:10] so powerful so much in him until he
[1:52:12] could speak to a couple on the front pew
[1:52:16] I promise you he could have spoke them
[1:52:19] out of existence
[1:52:21] I promise you
[1:52:26] and it'll be
[1:52:29] remember
[1:52:31] you know we always waiting for the third
[1:52:33] pull this is some of the goals
[1:52:35] I'm going to close with the third poem
[1:52:38] said you went to third pool again
[1:52:40] talking about speaking things into
[1:52:41] existence we may have to speak food into
[1:52:43] existence whatever that all means hello
[1:52:45] but speaking the word but that's not I
[1:52:48] believe it's not just for them I believe
[1:52:50] it's supposed to be here now he said
[1:52:52] he's proved himself to be here now
[1:52:55] because I'm here to tell you wherever
[1:52:56] Christ is all things are possible at all
[1:52:58] times you ain't got to wait till later
[1:53:00] it may manifest
[1:53:02] Peter like he said
[1:53:04] but even him out hunting how much he
[1:53:06] didn't have to have food
[1:53:08] he wasn't starving but God knows that he
[1:53:11] desire to have some squirrels and he
[1:53:13] says you speak where you want those
[1:53:15] squirrels to come
[1:53:16] and he picked trees and dead trees and
[1:53:18] places that that a squirrel he knewed
[1:53:21] squirrels very well like we know deer
[1:53:23] hunting and you know what trees he go on
[1:53:24] he says I want him to come up here go
[1:53:25] over there and sit there I want the
[1:53:27] other one to come up over here he'll go
[1:53:28] over that's it amen about five of them I
[1:53:30] believe it was and he spoke all of those
[1:53:32] and all of a sudden there they were he
[1:53:35] said he spoke them into existence and
[1:53:37] shot him and ate him
[1:53:39] if he can speak things into existence he
[1:53:41] could have spoke of out of existence if
[1:53:43] God told him and gave him the permission
[1:53:45] but I may notice God had matured the
[1:53:47] prophet to the place that he could trust
[1:53:49] him
[1:53:50] and instead of examine him instead of
[1:53:53] saying you'll drop dead and have another
[1:53:54] ananias and Sapphira but remember says
[1:53:57] he to come back in the church
[1:53:59] he says I forgive
[1:54:01] you for that
[1:54:03] and he said the right thing
[1:54:05] he had the right attitude
[1:54:07] how many would say Lord help me in every
[1:54:10] situation help me to say the rights
[1:54:12] word how many to do the right thing let
[1:54:16] me be like the prophet amen because he
[1:54:18] was like Christ
[1:54:20] amen
[1:54:21] they have that kind of power takes like
[1:54:23] surrendered life how many believes that
[1:54:25] currency created life to God
[1:54:28] Hallelujah I want more of Jesus more and
[1:54:32] more and more I want more of Jesus so
[1:54:35] I'll give him more of me how many is
[1:54:38] with me this morning
[1:54:39] amen
[1:54:41] praise be to God you love the Lord
[1:54:44] isn't he wonderful to come and talk to
[1:54:47] us like that
[1:54:48] have to get a little hard just wake us
[1:54:50] up make us realize hey you're not where
[1:54:52] you need to be
[1:54:55] you haven't detained yet you haven't
[1:54:57] gotten there yet

[1:55:01] what we're here this morning to come to
[1:55:04] better ourselves
[1:55:05] say God I want to possess it this
[1:55:07] morning I want to be there I want to be
[1:55:09] ready
[1:55:11] [Music]
[1:55:13] the only way I can do that is to
[1:55:15] surrender myself let me tell you
[1:55:16] something
[1:55:17] and I I don't want to go along but just
[1:55:19] a couple more minutes I ain't even a
[1:55:21] regular time
[1:55:23] the greatest hindrance
[1:55:26] and stumbling block to people around us
[1:55:28] is it
[1:55:29] a Pharisee
[1:55:31] is that right
[1:55:32] they went to church they had the long
[1:55:34] clothes they had the looks
[1:55:38] but inside they were what Jesus says
[1:55:40] you're inside full of dead men's bones
[1:55:43] your ravening wolves your wolves are
[1:55:45] sheep's clothes
[1:55:47] [Music]
[1:55:50] another scripture just comes to me and
[1:55:52] I'll just repeat it but first second
[1:55:54] Peter first chapter he says you know add
[1:55:56] Faith statue of a perfect man
[1:56:00] and I take my time
[1:56:02] man I'm just going to skip over all of
[1:56:04] this if I don't stop but I wanted to
[1:56:05] speak on this remember the satch of a
[1:56:07] perfect man is following the first
[1:56:08] second Peter the first chapter add to
[1:56:09] your faith virtue and knowledge and
[1:56:11] Temperance and patience and God leads
[1:56:12] our lives are like that pyramid

[1:56:17] he's building and building and a
[1:56:19] building and a building and the building
[1:56:20] in the building until I believe when we
[1:56:21] come up into that perfect love until
[1:56:23] man-made doesn't matter if they come in
[1:56:25] here and shoot me in the head it don't
[1:56:26] matter if they kill me I'll still pray
[1:56:28] for them God forgive them for they don't
[1:56:29] know what they did have perfect love for
[1:56:31] those who do you wrong whatever the
[1:56:33] Capstone be in love and then you're
[1:56:35] ready for speaking squirrels into
[1:56:36] existence or what whatever but our lives
[1:56:39] brothers and sisters Even in our
[1:56:40] Tabernacle you saved our lives are like
[1:56:42] a pyramid God is building upon building
[1:56:44] up in the Most Holy Faith until we've
[1:56:47] come to the full stature of the perfect
[1:56:49] man that's what God how many believe
[1:56:51] that's what God is looking for how many
[1:56:53] believes that's what God is coming for
[1:56:55] that's what I'm interested in what is
[1:56:57] God coming for
[1:56:59] that's my responsibility by the unction
[1:57:01] of the holy spirit is to bring to you
[1:57:03] what it's going to take to have you

[1:57:09] whoever's going to be there's going to
[1:57:10] be some of us making I trust it'll be
[1:57:12] all of us
