[0:48] all an apostle of Jesus Christ by the

[0:59] to the faithful in Christ Jesus
[1:08] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:10] Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us
[1:12] with all spiritual blessings and
[1:14] Heavenly places in Christ
[1:17] foreign
[1:27] having predestinated us to the adoption
[1:30] of children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:32] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:34] will
[1:43] in whom we have Redemption through his
[1:45] blood the Forgiveness of sins according

[1:57] of his will according to his good
[1:59] pleasure which he hath purposed in
[2:01] himself
[2:13] thank you
[2:15] in whom also we have obtained an
[2:18] inheritance being predestinated
[2:20] according to the purpose of him who
[2:22] worketh all things after the counsel of
[2:24] his own will
[2:32] in whom ye also trusted after that ye
[2:34] heard the word of Truth The Gospel of
[2:37] your salvation in whom also after that
[2:39] you believed you were silled with that
[2:42] Holy Spirit of promise and the last one
[2:44] together
[2:44] which in the earnest of our inheritance
[2:47] until the Redemption of the purchased
[2:50] possession unto the praise of his glory
[2:53] brother Brian
[3:03] or after reading them 14 verses what are
[3:07] you worried about this morning
[3:09] if God is faithful to save you and keep
[3:12] you you don't have anything to worry
[3:14] about this morning not to say that in a
[3:17] natural sense you don't worry about
[3:18] things I mean you're human beings I'm a
[3:21] human being sometimes the devil puts
[3:23] tries to put stuff on you but you have
[3:25] to take words this morning and if God is
[3:28] faithful in all his house and we really
[3:31] don't have anything to worry about uh if
[3:34] you return with me
[3:36] to uh Second Corinthians the second and
[3:39] third chapter this morning
[3:41] you know I spent three hours in my study
[3:43] this morning
[3:44] and I have a blind page here so we'll
[3:46] just have to trust the Lord this morning
[3:53] you know I
[3:55] am talking about myself here I find
[3:57] myself I don't I'm you know I'm just
[4:00] about 64. I'll be 64 in a week
[4:02] and you know
[4:04] as you're a young young man I don't know
[4:06] why I'm saying this as a young man you
[4:08] know you see your father your natural
[4:10] father and you see the traits you see
[4:12] his good traits and you see his bear
[4:14] traits and you say I don't ever want my
[4:16] father's bad traits I just want these
[4:18] good traits and then you get to be 64
[4:20] and you realize that if you're not
[4:22] careful you're going to be just like
[4:23] your dad and
[4:25] my father's one of his traits as he got
[4:28] older is that for no reason at all just
[4:31] the littlest things would set him off
[4:32] and I find myself I'm raising my hand
[4:34] I'm telling all myself I don't know why
[4:36] but Pete knows sometimes would just be
[4:39] the littlest things and all of a sudden
[4:41] I I find myself just like my dad I lose
[4:43] lose control and get angry about things
[4:46] that I shouldn't be getting angry about
[4:48] but as you read that scripture those 14
[4:50] verses if God is faithful and more than
[4:53] able to meet your needs he's more than
[4:55] able to keep my anger and my my own
[4:58] nature my this sinful nature in control
[5:01] through his salvation and the grace he
[5:03] gives us each day
[5:05] but I was reading the second chapter
[5:07] this morning you know I I use that
[5:10] devotional every day I'm sure you all
[5:12] have it well I can never I just wind up
[5:15] reading I wind up reading the Bible
[5:18] before you're supposed to finish it at
[5:20] the end of the year so I'm already in
[5:22] Corinthians and I was reading the second
[5:24] chapter this morning
[5:26] and the second chapter goes back to the
[5:28] first book of Corinthians where God was
[5:31] correct in the church through Paul he
[5:34] was correct in all the things that were
[5:36] wrong in the Corinthian Church and then
[5:38] we read the second chapter before we go
[5:41] into the third chapter and I'll just
[5:43] read a few of these I'll probably read
[5:45] this whole chapter like
[5:48] but Paul says here but I've determined
[5:50] this which myself that I would not come
[5:53] again
[5:54] to you in heaviness so he's he's
[5:57] changing here he's already corrected
[5:59] them he sent correction to him and he
[6:01] starts with the second verse for if I
[6:04] make ye sorry who is he then maketh me
[6:07] glad but the same which is made Sorrow
[6:09] by me and I write this same on to you
[6:12] least when I came I should have sorrow
[6:15] for them to whom I ought to Rejoice
[6:18] having confidence in you all
[6:20] that my joy the joy of you all for out
[6:24] of much Affliction and anguish of heart
[6:27] I wrote unto you with many tears not
[6:29] that you should be grieved
[6:31] but you should know the love which I've
[6:33] more abundantly on to you so he's saying
[6:36] the things he wrote were hard in the
[6:39] First Corinthians the things he was
[6:41] doing to correct the church
[6:43] but he's now he's talking to him in love
[6:45] and understanding
[6:46] here and I lost my place but it's fifth
[6:49] verse
[6:51] but if Annie have cause of grief he have
[6:54] not grieved me but in part that I may
[6:57] not overcharge you on sufficient that
[7:00] such a man as this punishment was
[7:02] inflicted of many so they're talking
[7:04] about how we put the young man out and
[7:06] others out of the church for their sins
[7:09] and then he goes on to talk to him and
[7:11] he finishes this chapter with Brotherly
[7:14] Love here he says
[7:17] so that counterwise you ought to rather
[7:20] forgive him comfort him least perhaps as
[7:23] one should be swallowed up without over
[7:25] much sorrow so they're saying
[7:28] once he's corrected you should return on
[7:30] to him in love and understanding for I
[7:33] beseech you that you would confirm your
[7:34] love toward him
[7:36] for this to this end also did I write
[7:39] that I might know the proof of you
[7:41] whether you be obedient in all things
[7:45] to whom you forgive anything I forgive
[7:48] also for if I forgave anything to whom I
[7:51] forgave it for your sakes forgave I it
[7:54] in the person of Christ so he's talking
[7:57] about brotherly forgiveness brotherly
[7:59] love that we have for each other in
[8:01] Christ and he starts at this 11th verse
[8:03] here
[8:04] Lee Satan should get any advantage of us
[8:07] for we are not ignorant of his devices
[8:10] so I was Paul he Paul is saying here
[8:12] when when correction is given as the
[8:15] father gives to a son or daughter or you
[8:18] know as things as you correct
[8:20] to each other
[8:22] after that correction is taken or even
[8:25] yourself when we fuss with each other
[8:27] and have issues with each other and once
[8:29] we make those issues right and those
[8:31] things right when you if something
[8:33] happens in your life and something
[8:35] different happens if your media thought
[8:38] is to go years back to the things that
[8:40] were wrong to you
[8:42] years ago then that's your enemy doing
[8:45] that to you if you've made everything
[8:47] right for the blood of Jesus Christ and
[8:49] you're moving on there shouldn't be any
[8:51] remembrance of those things anymore and
[8:53] if you find yourself or if I find myself
[8:55] always wrong to remember something that
[8:58] had happened 15 20 30 years ago and keep
[9:02] bringing it up again and again the issue
[9:05] is more with me than it was with the
[9:07] other people around me and he finishes
[9:09] here furthermore when I came to my
[9:12] pronunciations are going to be off to
[9:14] True is to preach
[9:16] Christ's gospel and a door was opened
[9:18] unto me of the Lord I have no rest in my
[9:21] spirit because I found not Titus my
[9:24] brother but taking leave of them I went
[9:27] forth hence into Macedonia now thanks
[9:30] beyond the god which always causes us to
[9:32] Triumph in Christ and make Manifest this
[9:35] the savior of his knowledge By Us in
[9:38] every place
[9:39] for we are unto God a sweet savior of
[9:42] God send them better saved and in them
[9:44] that are perished and this is really
[9:46] important
[9:47] Christians should be sweet not better or
[9:50] hard Christians should be loving and
[9:52] careful they shouldn't be deceitful it's
[9:56] total opposite here and for the Finish
[9:59] is here for under god I've read that
[10:01] already the 16th verse
[10:04] to the one we are fear of death unto
[10:07] death to the other the savior of Life
[10:09] onto life and who is sufficient for
[10:12] these things for we are not as many as
[10:14] which corrupt the word of God but as
[10:16] sincerity but as of God in the sight of
[10:18] God speak we in Christ
[10:20] and I was just thinking this morning I
[10:22] don't really have a lot to say I know
[10:24] that's a thing I say all the time I
[10:26] don't mean to
[10:28] but
[10:29] as we were reading in Ephesians as I was
[10:31] reading in these chapters
[10:33] I know one thing
[10:35] as I get older that God is faithful I've
[10:38] said that I say that a lot but I know
[10:40] that God is faithful and what he started
[10:43] in you this morning he's more than able
[10:45] to finish and and I was just thinking
[10:48] the world is a crazy place that we live
[10:50] in and the only only
[10:54] how do I say it the the only uh sanity
[10:57] that you'll have in this world or we
[10:59] live in
[11:00] is in Jesus Christ this morning that's
[11:02] your our only hope is in Jesus Christ
[11:04] all the things that go on in the world
[11:07] all the things that go on in the church
[11:09] I mean it should bring us closer to
[11:12] Jesus Christ this morning and I was
[11:14] listening to a message this morning and
[11:17] I was I was reading also
[11:19] brother Brian I mean even in the
[11:21] devotional was talking about the
[11:23] difference between a real believer and
[11:26] the church were all out there you know
[11:28] your pastor just shouldn't have to
[11:30] coddle you and push you and pry you to
[11:33] do what's right from the relationship
[11:35] that you have in your heart and in your
[11:37] life should make you want to do those
[11:40] things it's it's not law I don't I don't
[11:43] know how to say it's not law but when
[11:45] God gets a hold of your heart and gets a
[11:47] hold of your life to do the things that
[11:50] God wants you to think on a tour anymore
[11:52] it's something you just out of your
[11:54] heart and sweetness want to do or
[11:56] whatever whatever it is you know
[11:59] you know I've all the messages brother
[12:01] Brian I'm taught he said the most
[12:03] important thing
[12:04] for any man or any woman is to learn his
[12:07] place learn what God has desired you to
[12:10] be whether that's a preacher whether
[12:12] that's a Sunday school teacher whether
[12:15] that's a plumber or whatever it is and
[12:17] whatever God has chosen you to be if if
[12:20] you'll be happy in the things that you
[12:22] do if you're doing what God wants some
[12:25] people they never find those things out
[12:27] in their lives are always struggling but
[12:29] in this age that we live in a Christian
[12:31] shouldn't be struggling
[12:33] in the age that we live and not to say
[12:35] that there isn't struggles in the world
[12:36] but if if you're on God's path and
[12:39] you'll walk in his path this morning
[12:40] that should be a comforting thought this
[12:43] morning for a Christian to know that God
[12:45] is leading and guiding you in the world
[12:47] that we live in there there's no Shadows
[12:51] Of Shadows in your walk it's all bright
[12:54] and opening for you this morning and
[12:56] like I said I I say this a lot I can't
[12:58] say it enough
[13:00] as Christians this morning everything
[13:03] that we possess will ever possess has
[13:06] been given to us in the word of God in
[13:08] Jesus Christ and the message of the hour
[13:10] and as you reach for more of it and as
[13:13] you desire more of it God will make you
[13:16] more stable make you more loving make
[13:18] you a better Christian that's the only
[13:20] way you get better is staying in God's
[13:22] word but you know God's word is great
[13:25] but you have to have the very presence
[13:26] of Jesus Christ in your heart and life
[13:29] or it's just words without you got to
[13:32] have both you can't have one or the
[13:33] other it's all balanced in the word of
[13:36] God this morning brother David

[27:11] Michael but I remember when I moved here
[27:13] 17 years ago he's just a little bitty
[27:15] guy
[27:16] and I look at him now and I think wow
[27:18] he's fixing to get married and
[27:20] I thought that means I'm really getting
[27:22] older

[27:27] done to him he's been good to us hadn't

[40:39] some of also some things that Amy man
[40:43] some changes maybe that we want to make
[40:45] to the church here amen structurally
[40:47] amen so I asked brother branches to let
[40:50] me do the
[40:51] financials report on the church
[40:53] so amen
[40:56] we'll start with first of all sister
[40:59] releases no brother John amen
[41:01] he says we would like to say thank you
[41:04] to everyone that came to the shower
[41:06] yesterday and to those that send gifts
[41:09] but couldn't make it as well it was a
[41:13] great turnout and it meant so much
[41:15] a special thank you to our family that
[41:18] worked so hard to make it happen as well
[41:21] they all did an awesome job and we
[41:23] really appreciate it brother John and
[41:25] sister Alicia y'all made me proud to be
[41:28] part of this church family amen
[41:30] everybody God bless you from everyone
[41:33] amen praise the Lord
[41:36] amen would you pray that the Lord if
[41:39] you're traveling mercies to all those
[41:40] that are at Ohio camp and probably
[41:42] traveling back today to God be with them
[41:44] in a special way amen I think we'll
[41:46] probably have maybe some music just
[41:48] before amen turn it over to Brother Brad
[41:51] then but hey man I want to start with
[41:53] just the financial status of the church
[41:55] amen and that is and now just to start
[41:58] from the top here amen
[42:00] uh
[42:02] and I'll come down to the bottom it says
[42:05] uh the total using the total amount of
[42:09] months to pay the loan by eight uh 20 30
[42:14] because that's when our principal would
[42:16] be due amen or that's how long the loan
[42:18] was for till 2030. there could have been
[42:20] as much as 92 400 left to pay if not
[42:24] paying large amounts on the principal
[42:26] the last couple of three years amen and
[42:28] I know I think brother Byron said that
[42:30] for a few years he did pay extra on the
[42:33] church and for some reason I thought I
[42:35] don't know if we were going through a
[42:36] tight spot or what but amen I said I
[42:38] guess we decided just to not pay extra
[42:41] so that was stupid on my part amen but
[42:45] anyway
[42:46] but anyway so the total Principle as of
[42:49] July 2022 which was last year was 71 107
[42:56] 36 dollars
[42:57] amen and from that time to 723 of this
[43:01] year or July July the 23rd the total
[43:04] amount used from the general fund amen
[43:07] was 19 500.
[43:09] amen and of that amount was seven
[43:12] thousand five hundred that we had taken
[43:14] for uh you know and remember we took an
[43:17] offering last year for the to put on the
[43:20] principal amen and so there was 7 500
[43:22] amen included in that amen so we got 19
[43:26] 000 paid there amen
[43:28] also from that same time period total
[43:30] amount of building fund that was used
[43:32] was fourteen thousand two hundred fifty
[43:35] six and then the church sale of six
[43:37] eight Acres uh six acres uh it says that
[43:42] it netted a payment uh on the principal
[43:45] of thirty six thousand amen and then of
[43:47] course the insurance check amen casabus
[43:50] had kind of planned on taking one more
[43:52] loan or one more offering from y'all
[43:55] amen this year but the insurance check
[43:59] that we got from the flood that we had
[44:00] inside of the building here
[44:02] ended up being four thousand eight
[44:04] hundred and eighteen dollars amen and we
[44:06] do appreciate each and everyone that
[44:08] helped amen get it cleaned get it back
[44:10] to normal amen but they uh and so forth
[44:14] um
[44:15] so adding all of the above payments
[44:17] together in the total that we had paid
[44:20] was seventy four thousand five hundred
[44:22] and seventy five dollars so what I'm
[44:24] saying is the church is paid for amen
[44:35] [Music]
[44:38] [Applause]
[44:40] that's good
[44:43] amen so it says the church loan was
[44:45] cleared on 7 21 So within that I guess
[44:48] about a year's time we paid 470 the Lord
[44:52] the Lord blessed us amen the Lord had
[44:54] mercy we credited all to God isn't that
[44:56] right that we could pay within the years
[44:58] time 74 000 and get this paid for amen
[45:02] so that puts us about seven years ahead
[45:05] we could have done better than that if I
[45:07] wouldn't have done what I did or
[45:08] whatever but Amendment we just praise
[45:10] God for that isn't that right so it's
[45:12] paid in full amen so and then I read of
[45:15] course I had read the last part if we
[45:17] wouldn't have done it that way I mean we
[45:19] could still at this point oh ninety two
[45:22] thousand dollars so praise God we don't
[45:24] isn't that right thank everybody for
[45:27] your giving your generous giving and I
[45:29] was thankful that I knew that with that
[45:31] uh the water damage and so forth I knew
[45:33] it wouldn't have to ask another uh
[45:36] another offering from y'all because you
[45:39] all are a very very giving group of
[45:41] people amen and I trust that God and I
[45:44] believe God really blesses you for that
[45:46] amen
[45:47] praise the Lord so amen we're very
[45:50] thankful for what God has done for this
[45:52] church over the last 15 years amen I
[45:54] kind of hesitated on saying this but
[45:56] whenever statements are made or whatever
[45:58] the devil tries to say things you know I
[46:00] believe that when God comes contrary to
[46:03] that I believe it's worthy of saying I
[46:05] know it was said that this church would
[46:07] never be finished
[46:09] it would never be finished
[46:11] if you make a statement like that and
[46:13] God finishes I think that we ought to
[46:14] say you were wrong
[46:16] God finished it amen God finished his
[46:19] church not only finished it but we got a
[46:21] 39 000 Paving that God gives us amen God
[46:26] bless us with pavement I mean I mean
[46:28] remembers coming up in gravel and I was
[46:30] like I don't know if we'll ever get any
[46:31] pavement
[46:34] amen but God it's just good it's all God
[46:36] it's not us not me and you it's all God
[46:39] folks amen and I love God for that amen
[46:42] don't you amen so praise the Lord for
[46:45] what he has done amen and so and I
[46:47] thought about owning my own testimony of
[46:49] myself and amen God given me a farm out
[46:52] there you know and 38 acres and it's
[46:54] paid for amen so praise the Lord now
[46:57] some of that loan is put over on my uh
[46:59] apartments up in town so it's not I'm
[47:01] not all yeah pull the wool over your
[47:04] eyes but
[47:05] amen part of that loan is up there but
[47:07] it's Amen wealth taken well down and
[47:10] God's been good hasn't he amen amen you
[47:13] talk about a testimony I'll tell you
[47:14] what you mean I asked the Lord I said
[47:16] sure be nice to live in the country and
[47:17] have a little you know a little stream
[47:19] about that why it may be of a spring
[47:21] going down through there you know I go
[47:24] down there and give me one with a big
[47:25] old fish and a big old Creek y'all saw
[47:27] it and they got this exceedingly
[47:30] abundantly but all we can ask isn't that
[47:32] right so praise the Lord now brother
[47:34] Brian I I want to give another hand to
[47:36] Brother Brian sister Jeanette amen
[47:38] they've gotten a wonderful job in in in
[47:40] taking care of the finances for the last
[47:42] 15 years thank you brother Brian for all
[47:44] that you do
[47:53] he is an impeccable secretary
[47:57] amen God bless you we sure appreciate it
[48:00] man appreciate all of you amen so it
[48:03] says amen God is faithful and on time in
[48:07] everything his people need and desire
[48:09] for his kingdom amen that's the truth
[48:11] amen amen so here's the note that little
[48:14] red thing up there paid in full paid to
[48:18] phrase the law
[48:22] thank you Lord
[48:25] [Applause]
[48:26] Amen Brother Brad here done a couple
[48:28] weeks ago came to me and he had some
[48:30] ideas amen for them proving The church
[48:33] here and so we talked to the trustees
[48:34] and deacons about it as far as I know
[48:36] everybody I mean he's on board with it
[48:38] amen and so we're going to go over a few
[48:40] of the things that we'd like to make
[48:42] changes with him and one of them is this
[48:44] poll but now we've had this in mind and
[48:46] it was funny he brought that up but Amen
[48:48] to bring this Pulpit out amen about
[48:50] right up even with this uh uh with this
[48:54] communion table Amen to where I'm closer
[48:57] to you amen would that be all right
[48:59] y'all like the effort maybe just having
[49:01] this part coming out of level it so
[49:03] we're a little bit closer to you amen I
[49:05] thought that so might be a good good
[49:07] thing to do and so uh brother back you
[49:09] know mentioned and I thought yeah that's
[49:11] be wonderful and then uh of course we
[49:13] want to get uh all of the
[49:17] Windows darkened tint it amen and I
[49:20] think we've already got a price on it
[49:21] but the Reds at sixteen hundred dollars
[49:23] or something like that amen roughly for
[49:25] doing that because once we get the fast
[49:28] internet here as soon as we get the fast
[49:30] internet here we want to put a camera up
[49:32] there I think and then the camera back
[49:34] there and say get some much better
[49:36] cameras up here so that aiming people
[49:38] can see better and so forth amen so I
[49:40] mean that's going to be you know run
[49:42] into some money for some good cameras
[49:43] and then also lighting we want to do
[49:45] re-lighting brother bed I sure
[49:47] appreciate he can mention some of the
[49:48] thing maybe when he gets up but he's
[49:49] gonna he's already checked into more
[49:51] lighting so whether lighting is just
[49:53] going to be better and and gonna be
[49:55] right I mean also amen for our internet
[49:58] and so forth and then the third thing
[50:00] also I think it was and then we may uh
[50:03] we plan on putting bringing that out and
[50:04] build a little uh uh extension of The
[50:09] Sound Room out there by wherever the
[50:10] Steve is we might have bring it out to
[50:12] where the people in The Sound Room they
[50:14] just really can't get the sound right uh
[50:16] and it'll also make more room back there
[50:18] because and then with uh uh with an
[50:21] operator for our internet system I mean
[50:24] we need a little more room so we may
[50:25] bring that out a little bit right there
[50:28] okay and then if you would Micah put a
[50:31] pull a couple pictures up if you will
[50:32] Brother Brad and them got some uh they
[50:35] trotted out on paper and so he took a
[50:37] picture
[50:39] but I mean not quite as good as it would
[50:40] be on the picture if you saw the paper
[50:42] but this is what we're thinking because
[50:43] this light back here as you can tell
[50:45] this window is still just way too bright
[50:47] amen so we're gonna have we're thinking
[50:50] about maybe putting some rock like that
[50:52] back there with the cross on the back
[50:54] how do y'all like that
[50:56] y'all like that pretty good raise your
[50:57] hand
[50:58] yeah that's good all right so I thought
[51:01] that's really good amen that was a good
[51:03] idea
[51:08] and uh what else
[51:14] on board
[51:17] oh yeah the other picture there you go
[51:20] yeah there it is and I kind of I've been
[51:23] to churches where they had all of these
[51:24] out down here and I'll be honest with
[51:26] you I didn't like it
[51:28] because I don't want a dead shirt I
[51:30] don't want to just so dead that if you
[51:31] sin you can't even hear the congregation
[51:33] saying
[51:34] and I at first I was like well I don't
[51:36] want any because Sherry law fantaine
[51:38] said this is the best acoustic she's
[51:40] ever heard in here I take her as a
[51:43] pretty good source but it does have some
[51:45] rebounds so I don't think some of them
[51:47] would hurt if you did put some of them
[51:49] so we may end up putting some of these
[51:51] uh uh sound boards up against the wall
[51:54] here in the back amen and it would look
[51:56] good don't you think I would be all
[51:57] right if you choose to do that
[52:00] all right
[52:01] so that's kind of what we have in mind
[52:02] Amen Brother Brad I can think of
[52:04] anything else you can mention it but
[52:06] appreciate Brother Brad amen and amen
[52:08] his ideas and so forth and his labor of
[52:11] love here amen how many appreciate you
[52:14] brother Brad God bless you assistant
[52:15] [Applause]
[52:26] yeah man
[52:28] a couple of things maybe we'll mention
[52:29] before we get into the word I guess
[52:31] we'll be done with music how's that
[52:35] but uh
[52:38] brother Byler covered about everything
[52:39] but just the Lord just kind of laid it
[52:41] on it on my heart to
[52:43] to mention those things just just to try
[52:46] the sanctuary uh more accommodating to
[52:49] to the people here
[52:51] um and and I think it would be more
[52:54] um like I said just more accommodating
[52:56] some of the other things maybe we'll
[52:58] look at in the future we've talked to
[52:59] brother Micah and oh I'm not on Emma
[53:03] yeah we'll get that fixed how's that
[53:06] hopefully on now
[53:09] so a couple of things that uh brother
[53:13] Micah you know working the sound it's a
[53:15] constant it's a
[53:16] I've talked to sound men all over you
[53:19] know different churches different events
[53:21] different uh
[53:23] Productions and stuff and and it's a
[53:26] constant battle with sound uh so a
[53:29] couple other things that we may look at
[53:31] in the future and talking to the sound
[53:33] people and and different musicians is in
[53:36] in-ear monitors for our musicians
[53:39] um that'll help with with brother
[53:41] Michael being able to control the sound
[53:43] because they they get
[53:46] if they can't hear themselves they can't
[53:48] play so if uh you know if if the drummer
[53:51] can't hear herself he's gonna hit the
[53:52] drums harder which then over rides the
[53:55] piano and then the piano can't hear
[53:57] herself so she's gonna hit the keys
[53:59] harder and it's just a constant battle
[54:00] so within-ear monitors they'll be able
[54:03] to hear themselves uh and he can adjust
[54:06] what they hear through the through the
[54:08] sound I know it's getting kind of
[54:09] technical I'm not trying to be that way
[54:10] but I think we can get a better uh you
[54:13] know atmosphere or Ambiance with the
[54:16] sound in the sanctuary as you can
[54:18] control it more and that's the whole
[54:20] purpose of the lighting the the windows
[54:22] is is the more control we have in this
[54:26] in the back back there to control the
[54:28] environment you can make it more what
[54:30] you want it to be uh so trying to
[54:33] eliminate some of those things and
[54:35] um you know we're we're looking at maybe
[54:37] doing some uh wireless mic systems and
[54:40] stuff as well
[54:41] uh to kind of update I think some of
[54:43] those mics have probably been here since
[54:45] uh probably the days of Noah
[54:50] does anybody still have a large
[54:52] telephone at home no we're living in a
[54:56] technology age and and we've kind of
[54:58] we've outgrown some of this stuff just
[55:00] time you know creatures of time and we
[55:02] don't think about it but uh it'd be a be
[55:05] real nice to have uh wireless mics on a
[55:08] stand that you can just hand them out or
[55:10] or they're ready to go so those are just
[55:12] little upgrades of things that we're
[55:14] looking at and it'll take time but uh
[55:16] we're thankful for what the Lord has
[55:18] done for us
[55:20] uh what he's doing today and what he's
[55:23] going to do for us in the future so if
[55:25] you would stand with me and we'll get
[55:26] into the word this morning
[55:30] let's just uh let's just go before the
[55:32] Lord and change the atmosphere a little
[55:34] bit if we could and go before the Lord
[55:36] in prayer Heavenly Father we just

[55:52] lead us guide us and direct us to say
[55:55] what you would have said Lord that you
[55:56] would allow me to step myself out of the
[55:58] way and that you would step into shoe

[56:02] our hearts Lord and make our ears

[56:52] go to the word now bless the service in
[56:54] Jesus name amen
[56:56] amen
[56:58] if you would this morning
[57:00] as you turn into your Bibles let's go to
[57:03] the Book of Joshua
[57:06] and I've got notes kind of scattered
[57:08] everywhere but we can get with it go to
[57:09] the Book of Joshua and
[57:11] I'm going to read you a quote while
[57:12] you're turning there and finding that
[57:15] listen to this quote as the prophet
[57:17] speaks here he says that's my desire
[57:20] brethren
[57:21] to see my church cross over into another
[57:25] land
[57:26] that's his desire to see my church cross
[57:28] over into another land a desire to move
[57:32] over to the other side if there's
[57:35] something in you here talking about here
[57:38] calling there is something to respond to
[57:41] that call
[57:43] just settling down to sheep raisin ain't
[57:46] enough for you just to go into some sort
[57:48] of business is not enough for you to
[57:52] just to join a church and put your name
[57:54] on a book it's not enough for you
[57:57] because there's something called on
[58:00] across the ridge Over Yonder across the
[58:02] next Ridge and across the Jordan until
[58:05] you fall into the arms of God
[58:08] and took it can you wait for that day
[58:10] can you hardly wait for that day when
[58:12] you fall into the arms of God Almighty
[58:14] the day when you make it and you finally
[58:17] cross over onto the other side and a
[58:19] translation takes place and you just
[58:21] fall in the arms of your true love he
[58:24] said Yonder there is a deep calling unto
[58:28] the Deep
[58:29] turn with me for Joshua chapter 1
[58:33] we'll begin to read there now after the
[58:36] death of Moses some of these scriptures
[58:37] I've used in the last sermon but uh
[58:40] we'll just kind of go over some of them
[58:41] now after the death of Moses the servant
[58:44] of the Lord it came to pass that the
[58:46] Lord spake unto Joshua the son of none
[58:48] Moses's Minister saying Moses my servant
[58:52] is dead now therefore arise go over this
[58:56] Jordan thou and all this people unto the
[58:59] land which I do give to them even the
[59:02] children of Israel
[59:04] every place
[59:06] every place that the soul of your foot
[59:09] shall tread upon that have I given unto
[59:12] you as I said unto Moses so at this
[59:17] point right here everything that the
[59:19] prophet Moses was promised it's now
[59:22] promised here back to the children of
[59:25] Israel everything that Moses could
[59:27] possess everything that he did all of
[59:29] his works all of them the ministry and
[59:31] the works and the greatness of the hour
[59:33] it's now promised to the children of
[59:36] Israel so for the children of Israel now
[59:38] there will be no surprises of what their
[59:41] expectations should be
[59:44] because it's all been laid out before
[59:46] him
[59:47] and he says from the Wilderness and the
[59:49] Lebanon to this Great River the river
[59:51] Euphrates all the land of the Hittites
[59:53] and into the great sea towards going
[59:55] down of the sun shall be your Coast
[59:57] listen now there shall not be any man
[1:00:00] able to stand before thee all the days
[1:00:03] of thy life
[1:00:04] as I was with Moses
[1:00:07] so will I be with thee
[1:00:10] again
[1:00:12] if he was with Moses he's with the
[1:00:14] children of Israel
[1:00:15] if he was with the prophet in this hour
[1:00:18] he's with the children of God in this
[1:00:21] hour nothing's changed
[1:00:26] I will be with thee I will not fail thee
[1:00:29] nor forsake thee watch what he says
[1:00:32] be strong and of good courage For unto
[1:00:35] this people shall thou divide for an
[1:00:37] inheritance the land which I swear unto
[1:00:39] the fathers to give them only be
[1:00:43] only be thou strong and very courageous
[1:00:46] don't let no hindering spirits come
[1:00:48] amongst you only be strong only be
[1:00:53] courageous
[1:00:55] and thou mayest observe to do according
[1:00:57] to all the laws which Moses my servant
[1:00:59] commanded the etern not from it to the
[1:01:01] right or to the left that thou mayest
[1:01:04] Prosper with orsoever thou goest
[1:01:07] this book of law shall not depart out of
[1:01:10] thy mouth but shall be shalt but Thou
[1:01:13] shalt meditate therein day and night and
[1:01:15] thou mayest observe to do according to
[1:01:17] all that is written therein
[1:01:20] for then Thou shalt make thy way
[1:01:22] prosperous and then shall have good
[1:01:26] success have not I commanded thee
[1:01:29] question mark
[1:01:30] so somewhere down the line where sin be
[1:01:33] strong be courageous be strong be
[1:01:36] courageous and Joshua and his mind must
[1:01:39] have been contemplating how all this is
[1:01:41] going to come together because God says
[1:01:43] it again have I not commanded thee for
[1:01:46] the third or fourth time be strong and
[1:01:49] of good courage Don't Be Afraid why are
[1:01:53] you doubting why do we doubt as
[1:01:54] Believers if there's really going to be
[1:01:56] a Rapture if we can really see Miracles
[1:01:58] why do we doubt these things
[1:02:00] and God is telling Joshua be strong have
[1:02:03] good courage Be not Afraid neither be
[1:02:05] dismayed don't worry
[1:02:08] don't worry
[1:02:10] for the Lord thy God is with thee we're
[1:02:12] so with so ever thou goest you may have
[1:02:15] your seats may the Lord add a blessing
[1:02:16] to the reading of the word
[1:02:19] now we begin to look at this
[1:02:23] and we begin to look at this I want you
[1:02:24] to turn back into your scriptures a few
[1:02:26] pages back into the book of Deuteronomy
[1:02:28] now I'm going to try to slow down I
[1:02:30] don't have a lot of notes and we've
[1:02:31] taken up some time this morning so I'm
[1:02:33] going to try to try to take my time but
[1:02:36] yet still get where we need to be
[1:02:40] the book of Deuteronomy Deuteronomy
[1:02:42] chapter 34.
[1:02:47] in verse 9 I want you to follow here
[1:02:49] what's happening
[1:02:51] and Joshua the son of nine was full of
[1:02:54] the spirit
[1:02:57] was full of the spirit when I look in my
[1:02:59] Bible there's a little asterisk there a
[1:03:01] little note and when it says that was
[1:03:02] the Holy Spirit
[1:03:04] so Joshua now has come into the full
[1:03:07] fullness of the spirit and you remember
[1:03:10] back several Services ago when I
[1:03:12] preached it come to my attention and we
[1:03:14] shared how David stood in the midst of
[1:03:16] his brothers as a boy
[1:03:17] and even even though he was a shepherd
[1:03:19] He was out in the fields and he was
[1:03:21] learning how to be a how to be a a true
[1:03:23] man of God he was learning as a young
[1:03:25] man it wasn't until he was in the midst
[1:03:28] of his brothers and Samuel the prophet
[1:03:30] came down and took the Horn of oil and
[1:03:33] poured it over David's head and that's
[1:03:35] when the next scripture is says and the
[1:03:37] spirit of the Lord was upon David from
[1:03:39] that time forward
[1:03:41] you remember that
[1:03:43] here's Joshua is now full of the spirit
[1:03:46] of wisdom for Moses had laid his hands
[1:03:48] upon him and the children of Israel
[1:03:51] hearkened unto him and did as the Lord
[1:03:53] commanded Moses and watch now there and
[1:03:57] there arose not a prophet since in
[1:03:59] Israel like unto Moses whom the Lord
[1:04:02] knew face to face
[1:04:05] could I say in this hour
[1:04:07] there has never been or never will be
[1:04:09] another Prophet to come on the scene
[1:04:11] that knows the Lord Jesus Christ and God
[1:04:13] Almighty and the way the prophet of the
[1:04:16] hour did face to face
[1:04:19] he preached the word of God he walked
[1:04:21] and everywhere he took and and stood
[1:04:24] there was an angel of the Lord standing
[1:04:26] beside him
[1:04:27] to protect him to watch him to lead him
[1:04:30] to guide him to tell him what to say
[1:04:32] what to do what not to do
[1:04:34] and there will never be another one on
[1:04:36] the face of the Earth to do that
[1:04:40] are you with me
[1:04:42] and all the signs and all the Wonders
[1:04:44] which the Lord sent him to do in the
[1:04:46] land of Egypt to pharaoh and to all his
[1:04:48] servants and to his land
[1:04:51] we seen signs and wonders Time After
[1:04:54] Time After Time we read and we hear and
[1:04:56] we see the witness and the testimonies
[1:04:58] of what happened in the message of the
[1:05:00] hour for the prophet of our day just as
[1:05:02] Moses there were signs and wonders in
[1:05:05] Egypt and everything that happened there
[1:05:07] and here Israel was a witness to all
[1:05:10] this
[1:05:11] and I want to continue my thought from
[1:05:13] last time when I preached on Kingdom
[1:05:15] Builders but this morning I want to take
[1:05:17] and I want to look at the focus more on
[1:05:19] the life of Joshua and the transfer of
[1:05:22] leadership and authority and and I think
[1:05:25] it's important that we realize you're
[1:05:26] gonna have to put on your spiritual
[1:05:28] glasses today
[1:05:29] and because last time when I hit on this
[1:05:32] in the last service I'll be honest I I
[1:05:35] hit a little resistance
[1:05:40] I had a little resistance because we
[1:05:43] don't like it when people begin to uh
[1:05:47] take the profit or and not not the
[1:05:50] critical is not the word but we take the
[1:05:51] prophet or the message and we begin to
[1:05:53] compare it in a contrast and we think
[1:05:56] that we're we're uh putting this down
[1:05:59] that's not what we're doing at all
[1:06:03] we're taking the message of the hour and
[1:06:05] we're going to step into that message
[1:06:07] that he brought
[1:06:08] just as Moses had a message to a people
[1:06:11] of Israel
[1:06:13] when Moses left the scene and he was
[1:06:15] dead that message continued to go on and
[1:06:18] there had to be a group of people that
[1:06:19] would take that message not only take it
[1:06:22] and and and look at it but they would
[1:06:24] live that message
[1:06:25] and we have to in this hour live this
[1:06:28] message and brother baller made a
[1:06:30] statement of last service or go or so uh
[1:06:33] so ago and he said we are becoming the
[1:06:36] bride
[1:06:38] and when I heard him say that I thought
[1:06:40] man that's that's good how simple that
[1:06:42] is but that is so good because we are
[1:06:45] becoming the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:06:48] everything that the message of the hour
[1:06:51] was sent to us for we're beginning to
[1:06:53] step into it
[1:06:55] just like Joshua when he heard the
[1:06:58] message of Moses there was going to be a
[1:07:00] land on the other side of that River and
[1:07:03] the children of Israel will possess it
[1:07:05] and Joshua looked at that and he said I
[1:07:08] can see it and brothers and sisters we
[1:07:11] have to get it into our minds that we
[1:07:12] can step in and see where we should be
[1:07:15] in the message of the hour
[1:07:17] just as Moses and Joshua you can
[1:07:20] undoubtedly see the pattern of the
[1:07:22] message of the hour let me read you this
[1:07:23] quote
[1:07:25] there was an old Pentecostal generation
[1:07:27] that raised up 40 years ago old Fighters
[1:07:30] they was called they organized they beat
[1:07:33] they fussed he said all down through
[1:07:35] there but finally we're at the river now
[1:07:38] how many believes we're at the beyond
[1:07:40] the river now we're we're time to cross
[1:07:42] over something's fixing to happen
[1:07:45] and he says we're at the river now
[1:07:48] and he says
[1:07:51] he is going to raise up a new one with a
[1:07:53] Joshua to take them over the law failed
[1:07:57] Moses went with it Moses failed but
[1:07:59] Joshua took them over we find out that
[1:08:03] the organizations has failed but the
[1:08:05] spirit of God Joshua he says the word
[1:08:09] Joshua means Jesus our savior that the
[1:08:12] holy spirit will come into the church
[1:08:14] not an organization but the holy spirit
[1:08:17] will get among the people
[1:08:21] yeah the holy spirit will get amongst
[1:08:24] the people listen now and make her ready
[1:08:28] to go up
[1:08:30] across the Jordan
[1:08:32] brother sisters the holy spirit is what
[1:08:35] we need more of today we need the Holy
[1:08:37] Spirit to come down and lead us and
[1:08:39] guide us and direct us and walk beside
[1:08:41] us and tell us our do's and don'ts that
[1:08:43] says and not says
[1:08:45] we need the Holy Spirit like like the
[1:08:47] prophets talking about here he says and
[1:08:49] God knows that's what I'm seeking now
[1:08:52] that I might Comfort his people and tell
[1:08:56] them the what is at hand both here
[1:08:59] listen now
[1:09:00] both here this morning and out through
[1:09:05] the lands where these tapes will go
[1:09:08] worldwide he said we're at the end time
[1:09:16] Moses the prophet
[1:09:19] Moses the prophet here
[1:09:23] let the children of Israel of slavery in
[1:09:25] Egypt and brought them to the edge of
[1:09:28] the Promised Land
[1:09:30] and in the Old Testament the Old
[1:09:32] Testament mentions mentions Moses 767
[1:09:35] times making him the most prominent name
[1:09:38] of people in the Old Testament that only
[1:09:40] David is mentioned more than he is in
[1:09:43] the entire book only David and Jesus is
[1:09:46] mentioned more than Moses in the entire
[1:09:48] Bible
[1:09:49] and so here we see how important the
[1:09:51] ministry of Moses was
[1:09:55] are you looking through your spiritual
[1:09:56] glasses
[1:09:58] Abraham we could look and say he's the
[1:10:00] ancestral father of Israel but when you
[1:10:03] talk about Moses he is considered the
[1:10:06] founder of Israel because he was the one
[1:10:09] who established Israel as a nation
[1:10:13] and Moses's Ministry goes out to the to
[1:10:16] a whole large group of people and it
[1:10:19] says you got to come out of her
[1:10:22] you come out of her you come out of
[1:10:24] Egypt your God is calling you to come to
[1:10:26] a higher place
[1:10:28] and the same thing is happening in our
[1:10:31] day there's a message of the hour that
[1:10:33] says come out of her because I am
[1:10:36] forming a bride there is a group of
[1:10:39] people who is going to become a bride of
[1:10:41] Jesus Christ
[1:10:43] Moses you look at it he's the author of
[1:10:45] The Books five books the pizza took and
[1:10:49] he he's got these first five books in
[1:10:51] the Bible the last four of those book
[1:10:53] Exodus Leviticus Numbers and Deuteronomy
[1:10:56] are all about his life
[1:11:00] that's how important Moses was
[1:11:03] a lot of times we hear Moses we think of
[1:11:05] a few simple things but as you begin to
[1:11:06] dig into it you realize that there was a
[1:11:09] whole lot more going on in those books
[1:11:10] that maybe we just didn't fully grasp
[1:11:12] because we read through so fast
[1:11:15] and Moses was so important there and so
[1:11:18] he is an author of these books and while
[1:11:21] Moses didn't write the Ten Commandments
[1:11:25] Moses did bring them down off of Mount
[1:11:27] Sinai
[1:11:30] let me tell you
[1:11:32] there was a prophet in the hour
[1:11:35] he may not have wrote the church A's
[1:11:37] book The Seven Seals marriage and
[1:11:39] divorce serpent seed
[1:11:41] he may not have wrote those from himself
[1:11:44] but I'll tell you heard from one who he
[1:11:46] was able to bring them down to a group
[1:11:49] of people that would change the way we
[1:11:51] walked the way we live the way we Act
[1:11:56] you know people want to contradict they
[1:11:58] want to they want to sometimes confront
[1:12:00] our message
[1:12:03] and they want to know how is this right
[1:12:04] how is that right what's over here
[1:12:07] what's over there what do you mean how
[1:12:08] is serpency show it to me and you try to
[1:12:10] show it to him and they still conflict
[1:12:12] you
[1:12:13] and I I told you before but I want to
[1:12:15] get to I get to the place where I just
[1:12:17] say show me something better
[1:12:19] show me something that makes more sense
[1:12:21] scripturally when you go from Genesis to
[1:12:23] Revelations than what the message of the
[1:12:25] hour says show me something better
[1:12:28] they can't show it to you
[1:12:30] they don't know what they're talking
[1:12:32] they don't know they just can't grasp
[1:12:34] that there was a messenger in this last
[1:12:37] day that brought it forth you know the
[1:12:39] Bible says and speaks about uh you know
[1:12:41] uh Malachi
[1:12:43] Malachi 4 you know there's denominations
[1:12:47] in churches they believe that they read
[1:12:49] that scripture but they don't know who
[1:12:51] it is
[1:12:52] they don't know if it's happened if it
[1:12:54] hasn't happened who it will be where it
[1:12:56] will be they're still looking they're
[1:12:57] still grasping what's going to happen to
[1:12:59] those people when the Rapture takes
[1:13:01] place they're going to be left behind
[1:13:02] because they cannot see
[1:13:05] with the message of this hour is
[1:13:11] so Moses considered one of the most
[1:13:13] important prophets of his day I consider
[1:13:15] ours the most important prophet of the
[1:13:18] hour
[1:13:21] and numbers it tells us that Moses was a
[1:13:24] man that was very meek
[1:13:26] and he was Meek and he was above uh men
[1:13:29] uh uh most humble on the face of the
[1:13:31] Earth
[1:13:33] how many could say that we've seen a
[1:13:34] humble servant in this hour
[1:13:39] we've got a lot that we can type back if
[1:13:41] here and we can continue to go on
[1:13:45] them now listen I thought about this
[1:13:46] here's Moses Moses's job as a mediator
[1:13:49] was to stand before God and Israel
[1:13:52] because the children of Israel at that
[1:13:55] time they had seen all these great
[1:13:56] wonders they had seen all the Miracles
[1:13:58] they had seen power they'd seen fire
[1:14:00] they had seen the demonstration of of
[1:14:02] God in action on the scene
[1:14:05] I mean what would you think if you went
[1:14:06] out there and God tells you to leave and
[1:14:09] pulls you up to a to a seabed and you
[1:14:11] can't cross and all of a sudden walls of
[1:14:13] water to a hundred feet go up on each
[1:14:15] side of you
[1:14:18] and you walk across on dry land
[1:14:22] what would you think would that place a
[1:14:24] little bit of fear in you
[1:14:27] because they didn't know of a savior at
[1:14:29] that time they didn't know of Jesus
[1:14:31] Christ they were just following what God
[1:14:32] was telling to do follow this Pillar of
[1:14:34] Fire follow this Cloud by day of Fire by
[1:14:37] night and they were following this and
[1:14:38] they see all this and magnitude so Moses
[1:14:41] had to stand before the people and God
[1:14:43] because they were afraid to talk to God
[1:14:46] now let me say this we'd have somebody
[1:14:48] come down in this age to tell us that
[1:14:49] there is one mediator
[1:14:51] between man and God and that's Jesus
[1:14:54] Christ he brought a message of the hour
[1:14:56] that told us that no matter how powerful
[1:14:59] God is all the things that God can do
[1:15:01] he's not there to use that power against
[1:15:04] his bride
[1:15:06] but God loves his bride God adores his
[1:15:08] bride God cherishes his bride and that's
[1:15:12] what the prophet of the hour consent was
[1:15:13] sent to mediate between us as far as us
[1:15:15] and Jesus Christ and the bumper between
[1:15:18] God he explained it all when he talked
[1:15:21] about that blood barrier
[1:15:23] and that bumper that stands before us
[1:15:26] Moses was a representative of the people
[1:15:28] of Israel whenever they had disputes
[1:15:31] they turned to Moses to learn the will
[1:15:33] of God
[1:15:36] you ever sit and listened to questions
[1:15:37] and answers on marriage and divorce
[1:15:42] there was somebody there to lay it out
[1:15:45] because people didn't know
[1:15:47] people didn't know what do we do I've
[1:15:49] been married before what do I do what do
[1:15:51] I do here now where do I go how do we
[1:15:53] conduct our lives from this point on and
[1:15:56] the problem said let me tell you how
[1:15:58] this needs to be
[1:16:00] according to God
[1:16:02] this is what we're going to do
[1:16:05] so there was a there was God standing
[1:16:07] there and he was representing the people
[1:16:09] of this hour through a prophet in this
[1:16:12] hour there's a direct connection Moses
[1:16:14] had with God there was a direct
[1:16:17] connection that he knew God will so well
[1:16:21] that Moses could look down and he could
[1:16:23] he could take the will of God and teach
[1:16:26] it to people
[1:16:29] did you ever realize that
[1:16:31] we're talking about slaves
[1:16:34] we're talking about Farmers mud daubers
[1:16:38] that's trying to figure out how are we
[1:16:40] going to get to God's Promised Land
[1:16:43] and Moses stand in such a connection but
[1:16:46] with God that he can begin to explain
[1:16:48] and say hey this is the way God operates
[1:16:51] in our hour
[1:16:53] we've had that in our hour
[1:16:55] that God can tell us exactly how we're
[1:16:58] to operate how we're to act in this hour
[1:17:00] he gives us the word and clarifies it he
[1:17:03] begins to teach and we've got ministers
[1:17:04] that are preaching the message of the
[1:17:06] hour
[1:17:07] in its fullness around the world to
[1:17:10] prepare a bride for a christ
[1:17:17] so here's Moses
[1:17:21] here's Moses now and Joshua
[1:17:25] Moses is getting ready to pass the Baton
[1:17:30] Moses knows because God's told him
[1:17:32] you're nearing your time
[1:17:33] you're not going to see
[1:17:35] you're not going to see what all you've
[1:17:37] preached about
[1:17:38] and you're nearing your time
[1:17:40] it's time for you to pass the Baton
[1:17:44] on to Joshua
[1:17:49] one thing I picked up as a young person
[1:17:50] when I was listening to the message I
[1:17:52] when I first started listening to the
[1:17:54] message I started in the last year there
[1:17:56] and I started and I began to listen
[1:17:58] because I want to hear what what was
[1:18:00] happening at the end of the ministry
[1:18:02] and one thing I picked up on is brother
[1:18:04] random I feel like knew that his time
[1:18:06] was drawn near
[1:18:09] if you've listened to him in the
[1:18:10] messages he'll begin to tell you I'm
[1:18:12] feeling I'm feeling like the time is
[1:18:14] drawing close I need to get this done
[1:18:16] I'm running out of time
[1:18:18] if I just follow through the message
[1:18:20] you'll hear there was something Quince
[1:18:22] there was something on the inside of him
[1:18:23] that was telling him get the people
[1:18:25] ready get all that you need to say out
[1:18:27] there everything that I've told you
[1:18:28] minister to the people and get the word
[1:18:30] out there so that they have it
[1:18:34] Moses had ministered all the word
[1:18:38] and he was getting ready to pass the
[1:18:41] Baton off to Joseph to Joshua and so if
[1:18:44] you've ever watched Olympic runners in a
[1:18:47] relay race
[1:18:48] they've got one on their mind
[1:18:51] it's the guy who was running at the
[1:18:53] beginning he's going to pass the Baton
[1:18:55] off to the guy who's going to what
[1:18:57] finish the race
[1:18:59] they've got one thing in mind and that
[1:19:01] is win that race
[1:19:02] but it's not easy they say passing the
[1:19:05] Baton is one of the hardest things to do
[1:19:07] in sports you've got two Elite athletes
[1:19:09] that are running full speed as fast as
[1:19:11] they can go and getting ready to pass a
[1:19:13] stick
[1:19:15] the guy running away from him
[1:19:17] and it takes communication it takes
[1:19:19] precision
[1:19:22] and so that is why we had such a precise
[1:19:25] message in this hour
[1:19:28] there was such Precision in the message
[1:19:30] of the hour that it leads nothing to
[1:19:32] question
[1:19:37] the scriptures are filled with this
[1:19:39] guidance in this delicate task of of
[1:19:42] passing the Baton Moses we know he
[1:19:45] prepared Joshua to be the leader of
[1:19:47] Israel Elijah he he passed the the
[1:19:53] John the Baptist prepared the Jews for
[1:19:55] the coming of Jesus Jesus the Messiah
[1:19:58] trained up 12 to evangelize the world
[1:20:01] and Paul set writings in place to teach
[1:20:04] Timothy how to preach
[1:20:06] constantly there's a passing down the
[1:20:09] Baton
[1:20:12] and in this hour the prophet opened up
[1:20:15] the word for the bride of Christ in our
[1:20:17] day
[1:20:20] we see that Moses affirms Joshua
[1:20:24] Moses looks at Joshua he says I Believe
[1:20:27] In You Joshua I trust in you Joshua I
[1:20:30] have confidence in you Joshua
[1:20:33] and Moses he looks there God's chosen to
[1:20:36] liver who marched millions of Jews
[1:20:38] across the sandy desert From Slavery to
[1:20:40] Freedom and Moses who took young Joshua
[1:20:43] and prepared it to lead the Jews across
[1:20:45] the Jordan into the promised land he
[1:20:48] instilled confidence and vision
[1:20:51] and Joshua
[1:20:53] how many has a vision this morning
[1:20:58] would you have had that Vision had it
[1:21:00] not been for a Ministry
[1:21:03] now
[1:21:05] but we've had a vision instilled in Us
[1:21:07] in this hour
[1:21:09] of a bride
[1:21:11] of a bride that will be without spot and
[1:21:13] wrinkle of a bride who will prepare
[1:21:16] herself
[1:21:25] Joshua and Caleb back up just a little
[1:21:28] bit they go over and enter in
[1:21:32] spying out the land
[1:21:35] and they set their eyes on what's to
[1:21:38] come
[1:21:40] we've heard about it
[1:21:42] we've heard it preached about we've
[1:21:44] heard it told about we've been listening
[1:21:46] listening to this message for year after
[1:21:48] year after year and they've been telling
[1:21:50] us there's a promised land to come and
[1:21:52] now I've laid my eyes on it
[1:21:55] and they sit there and they lay their
[1:21:56] eyes on and they bring back
[1:21:59] goodness from the land
[1:22:02] and you know how to all the spies and
[1:22:04] all those people Joshua and Caleb were
[1:22:06] the only two that thought that this was
[1:22:08] doable
[1:22:10] they're the only two that thought hey we
[1:22:13] can do this the rest of them saw
[1:22:15] obstacles
[1:22:16] and let me tell you this morning we have
[1:22:19] obstacles all in our path
[1:22:21] but we have to look through our
[1:22:23] spiritual eyes our Supernatural eyes and
[1:22:25] get the vision that the prophet gave us
[1:22:28] that there will be a translation in the
[1:22:30] moment and a twinkling of an eye and
[1:22:33] there will be a group of people that
[1:22:34] will translate out of here before you
[1:22:36] can even blink your eyes that has to be
[1:22:39] your vision this morning
[1:22:41] and there's seriousness that comes
[1:22:43] around that vision
[1:22:46] Moses
[1:22:50] he looks out here and he talks to he's
[1:22:52] he's got Joshua on his mind and he's
[1:22:55] looking and Joshua goes and spies out
[1:22:57] this land and comes back
[1:22:58] well at that time if you look in your
[1:23:00] Bible his name was O'Shea
[1:23:04] Joshua ocean
[1:23:07] and it meant salvation
[1:23:09] and as it began to go on and Moses
[1:23:11] begins to look at him and Moses begins
[1:23:13] to see Joshua's faith and he sees his
[1:23:16] determination and his commitment to the
[1:23:17] cause and he sees this passion that has
[1:23:20] Brewing up any Moses now begins if you
[1:23:22] look in your Bible changes his name to
[1:23:24] Joshua
[1:23:26] which means Jesus is our salvation
[1:23:31] what an amazing thing
[1:23:33] something has happened now Joshua now
[1:23:36] has become something that God has
[1:23:37] prepared to prove to us that there is a
[1:23:40] day coming there is a Salvation there's
[1:23:42] a translation that God is on the move
[1:23:47] and he looks at this and Joshua begins
[1:23:50] to witness firsthand the power and the
[1:23:52] glory of God Joshua was with Moses side
[1:23:55] by side watching and learning and taking
[1:23:57] it all in and he's beginning to see all
[1:24:00] of this and he's he's loving what he's
[1:24:02] seeing he Marvels at Moses's shining
[1:24:05] face when he comes down off the mountain
[1:24:08] and Moses pours into his successor
[1:24:13] I don't know anybody that suffered and
[1:24:15] poured out more than the message Prophet
[1:24:17] messenger of our hour
[1:24:20] he poured it out
[1:24:23] was it for monetary Gain No he could
[1:24:27] have been a
[1:24:28] multi-multi-multi-millionaire and he
[1:24:30] tore up check after check after check
[1:24:33] he could have had a flooded Cadillacs
[1:24:35] more than Elvis ever thought about
[1:24:38] it but he cared not for it
[1:24:40] he had one thing on his mind
[1:24:44] the people that will take a rapture
[1:24:50] Joshua marveled at Moses's face and and
[1:24:54] Joshua he knew when it was time for him
[1:24:57] to come forth and he knew them he began
[1:25:00] to look at that and God began to speak
[1:25:02] to him in a different way now
[1:25:05] here's one of the twists here's where
[1:25:07] the story twists now scripture says
[1:25:09] after the death of Moses the servant of
[1:25:12] the Lord he said unto Joshua Moses my
[1:25:15] servant is dead
[1:25:19] when he looks at Joshua and says that to
[1:25:22] him what he is saying is Joshua you are
[1:25:25] no longer a spectator in my plan
[1:25:29] you're no longer just going to be around
[1:25:31] the goodness of the message of the hour
[1:25:34] I'm now calling you Joshua to be a
[1:25:37] participator
[1:25:39] you're going to be a leader you're going
[1:25:40] to be somebody who takes the message of
[1:25:42] the hour and makes the message of the
[1:25:44] hour live
[1:25:48] all these people are getting ready to
[1:25:50] cross over the river and I'm about to
[1:25:52] give them
[1:25:53] all these people are getting ready and
[1:25:55] they need somebody I want you to know
[1:25:57] that everywhere you set your feet you
[1:25:59] will possess
[1:26:03] Moses had confidence that somebody could
[1:26:06] carry it on and Moses laid his hands on
[1:26:09] Joshua right before he died
[1:26:11] and prayed over him and the Spirit come
[1:26:13] upon Joshua
[1:26:17] brothers and sisters I think sometimes
[1:26:18] we get so focused on what's happened in
[1:26:21] years past
[1:26:23] that we sometimes fail to see
[1:26:27] that God can trust us
[1:26:31] to carry out his work in this present
[1:26:33] day
[1:26:36] we come to church we go to work we go to
[1:26:38] school we go to our jobs we
[1:26:41] we find ourselves
[1:26:44] around the message
[1:26:50] but are we Allowing God to fully use us
[1:26:54] are you doing
[1:26:56] don't raise your hand but ask yourself
[1:26:58] in your heart am I doing all that God
[1:27:01] wants me to do
[1:27:03] am I living the life that God is asking
[1:27:06] me to live to take and make this rapture
[1:27:12] in the message turn on the light
[1:27:15] the prophet said it seems strange to us
[1:27:17] now because we keep looking back through
[1:27:18] a rear view mirror
[1:27:20] he said but did you ever know if you
[1:27:22] keep looking back that way you'll wreck
[1:27:28] pay attention young drivers
[1:27:31] if you continue to look behind you
[1:27:36] see what God is going to do in your
[1:27:37] present day you're going to find
[1:27:39] yourself running off in the ditch and he
[1:27:41] said that's what they're doing he said
[1:27:43] the reason that they did that is because
[1:27:44] we're living in they're living in the
[1:27:46] glare of another light they're living in
[1:27:48] a glare of a light of another day
[1:27:51] the children of Israel had just
[1:27:53] continued to sit there on the banks of
[1:27:55] river
[1:27:56] listen now if they had just continued to
[1:27:58] sit there on the banks of that River day
[1:28:01] after day after day saying God sent a
[1:28:04] prophet named Moses
[1:28:07] don't don't resist
[1:28:09] don't don't resist I mean what I'm about
[1:28:11] to say because this is what they'll take
[1:28:12] to get us through
[1:28:14] what if you what if they just sat there
[1:28:16] day after day and said you know God sent
[1:28:18] a prophet named Moses I remember when
[1:28:20] Moses walked into Pharaoh's Palace
[1:28:23] I'm going to tell my grandkids about
[1:28:25] when Moses called down the plagues
[1:28:29] it was such a joyous occasion when when
[1:28:31] we crossed over the Red Sea with pharaoh
[1:28:34] and Pharaoh's Army was devoured at the
[1:28:36] Red Sea let me tell you brothers and
[1:28:39] sisters if that would have been as far
[1:28:40] as they went and stopped when Moses died
[1:28:44] they would still be sitting on that bank
[1:28:46] at the Jordan River today
[1:28:49] but it took somebody it took a group of
[1:28:52] Believers that would listen to the
[1:28:54] message of the hour Joshua that picked
[1:28:56] up right where Moses left off and said
[1:28:58] I'll take every word that he said I'll
[1:29:00] take every message that he preached I'll
[1:29:02] take every Vision that he had and I'm
[1:29:04] going to look it through my eyes through
[1:29:06] the spirit of God and I'm going to walk
[1:29:08] in those shoes
[1:29:10] God is looking for a group of people
[1:29:12] that will apply the message of this hour
[1:29:15] personally in our homes he's looking for
[1:29:18] a group of people who will have a vision
[1:29:19] to be able to be on the other side of
[1:29:22] that River who will take a translation
[1:29:24] you've got to see it for yourself
[1:29:29] I love the message the message changed
[1:29:32] my life it changed my home it changed my
[1:29:34] children it changed my my relationship
[1:29:36] with people
[1:29:38] the message of the hour teaches us it
[1:29:40] teaches us how to live it teaches us how
[1:29:42] to conduct business it teaches us how to
[1:29:45] live in our homes
[1:29:46] when our wife is in disarray it teaches
[1:29:49] us to put on an apron and wash dishes
[1:29:52] that's the Simplicity of the message of
[1:29:54] the hour
[1:29:56] that teaches us how to live a life
[1:29:58] that's pleasing to my God almighty
[1:30:05] he says that's what's the matter with
[1:30:06] the world today friends
[1:30:08] he said we're trying to live in a glare
[1:30:10] of a light that's shines in another day
[1:30:12] and he says like a mirage on the road he
[1:30:15] said we go down the road and we see the
[1:30:17] Mirage it's just a false conception of
[1:30:19] the Sun
[1:30:21] now stay with me here don't get critical
[1:30:25] I'm not saying the message is a mirage
[1:30:27] that's not what I'm saying but what I'm
[1:30:29] saying is a lot of times we find
[1:30:31] ourselves still to this day living a
[1:30:34] life that the prophet lived instead of
[1:30:36] living the life of God through us
[1:30:42] the preaching of the word is focused in
[1:30:44] One Direction and one time
[1:30:47] 1950s through the 60s
[1:30:51] we've got to come up higher
[1:30:53] not that there's more of the message not
[1:30:55] that there's more to it but we've got to
[1:30:58] accept it and we've got to live it and
[1:30:59] we got to make it our life
[1:31:03] he says let me tell you don't refuse the
[1:31:05] light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:31:07] which is the warming rays of the Holy
[1:31:09] Ghost upon you it makes you a new
[1:31:11] creation in Christ don't walk in the
[1:31:14] glare of some other age he said it may
[1:31:16] have been all right then it might have
[1:31:18] been all right for them and he says I
[1:31:20] say this with reverence and respect
[1:31:22] listen but to bring light because as our
[1:31:25] brother said a while ago we're living
[1:31:26] later than we think
[1:31:29] one of these days something's going to
[1:31:31] happen and it's going to be too late
[1:31:33] the people will take on the mark of the
[1:31:36] beast not even knowing what they're
[1:31:38] doing the blind will lead the blind
[1:31:40] they'll fall in the ditch
[1:31:42] and is living later than we think listen
[1:31:45] now but the hour is at hand when the
[1:31:48] light is shining
[1:31:50] [Music]
[1:31:51] we're living in the hour and it's at
[1:31:53] hand when the light is shining Christ
[1:31:55] and Jesus Christ is fixing to do greater
[1:31:58] things than we've ever seen in our life
[1:32:00] [Music]
[1:32:04] he's going to listen what he says he
[1:32:05] says it's the power of the resurrection
[1:32:07] of Jesus Christ manifesting himself that
[1:32:10] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:32:12] and forever you say well that's simple
[1:32:15] we've heard that do we believe it
[1:32:22] do we still believe that miracles happen
[1:32:26] do we still believe that cancers can
[1:32:28] fall off
[1:32:29] do we still believe that Dad can raise
[1:32:31] do we still believe that deaf ears can
[1:32:33] be opened
[1:32:34] don't don't lie to yourself do you
[1:32:36] believe it
[1:32:38] because God has to have a people that
[1:32:40] stands on that word and said with all my
[1:32:43] heart I know that God is able and that
[1:32:46] no man no Spirit no demon can stand
[1:32:49] before me as I was with Moses as I was
[1:32:52] with brother Brown I will be with my
[1:32:55] people
[1:32:57] foreign
[1:33:00] he said if the church won't accept it
[1:33:03] God is able for these stockings to rise
[1:33:06] up
[1:33:07] and he said he's going to get his
[1:33:08] message over because he's always done it
[1:33:10] and he always will do it
[1:33:17] listen
[1:33:18] we're fixing to get down in some gritty
[1:33:20] here
[1:33:21] because people think they're walking
[1:33:24] people thinking they're walking in the
[1:33:27] light
[1:33:29] the traditions of their fathers uh oh
[1:33:34] uh oh
[1:33:38] my daddy this my daddy was here
[1:33:44] he traveled from
[1:33:46] one side of the country to the other to
[1:33:48] hear the message
[1:33:49] that's what your daddy did
[1:33:52] that's what your granddaddy did
[1:33:54] he allotted this for this day he said
[1:33:57] the first thing you know they're walking
[1:33:59] in the glare of light
[1:34:02] they're not in the same light they've
[1:34:04] rejected the very light that they claim
[1:34:06] to be worshiping
[1:34:08] turn with me in the Book of Numbers if
[1:34:10] you would
[1:34:11] chapter 32.
[1:34:18] I didn't give you my title I guess now
[1:34:20] would be a good time
[1:34:21] while you're turning
[1:34:23] if I was to title this it would be
[1:34:25] Kingdom Builders
[1:34:27] Joshua and the two and a half
[1:34:32] what are you talking about
[1:34:34] I could see that look coming from his
[1:34:36] face what are you talking about Joshua
[1:34:38] and the two and a half
[1:34:41] chapter 32 of numbers
[1:34:44] verse 1. now the children of Reuben and
[1:34:47] the children of God had very great
[1:34:49] multitude of cattle and when they saw
[1:34:52] the land of jezer and the land of Gili
[1:34:54] that behold there was a place for cattle
[1:34:58] the children of God and the children of
[1:35:00] Reuben came and spoke to Moses the elies
[1:35:02] are the priests and unto the princes of
[1:35:04] the congregation saying
[1:35:14] Nebo and Beyond even the country which
[1:35:17] the Lord spoke before the congregation
[1:35:19] of Israel is a land for cattle
[1:35:23] and watch what the request is and thy
[1:35:26] servants have cattle
[1:35:30] wherefore they said if we have found
[1:35:32] Grace in thy sight let this land be
[1:35:35] given unto thy servants for a possession
[1:35:37] and bring us not over Jordan
[1:35:43] wow
[1:35:45] can you imagine
[1:35:48] sitting in a church in the message of
[1:35:50] the hour
[1:35:51] and say I know I'm part of this group
[1:35:54] I've heard the message I've heard the
[1:35:55] word I know all about it I know
[1:35:57] everything there is to know that it's a
[1:35:59] possible and I believe every bit of it
[1:36:01] but because I need to gain my house
[1:36:05] I need personal gain in my house can I
[1:36:09] just settle over here and live like a
[1:36:10] world
[1:36:12] on the other side of Jordan
[1:36:16] the rest of you can go on over two and a
[1:36:18] half tribes
[1:36:20] Manassas again and Reuben's tribe half
[1:36:24] of Manassas two and a half tribes wanted
[1:36:27] to settle on the east side of the Jordan
[1:36:29] River because they wanted to
[1:36:32] raise cattle
[1:36:39] but listen to what they did
[1:36:41] and this is where we get into trouble
[1:36:44] they went across the river
[1:36:47] they promised Moses
[1:36:49] when Moses was living they promised said
[1:36:51] it when the time comes if you'll let us
[1:36:53] possess this land on the east side and
[1:36:55] raise our cattle when the time comes for
[1:36:58] battle and the rest of the children of
[1:37:00] Israel go over to take the land we'll
[1:37:02] fight with you
[1:37:04] isn't that the way the borderline
[1:37:06] believer is
[1:37:11] okay Christians today they want to see
[1:37:14] the Rapture of the church come to pass
[1:37:19] they truly believe that it's going to
[1:37:21] happen
[1:37:23] they've heard it since they were this
[1:37:25] big
[1:37:26] and they know in their hearts that it's
[1:37:28] going to happen but what they want don't
[1:37:29] want to do they want don't want to live
[1:37:31] in the center of God's will
[1:37:33] these two and a half tribes didn't want
[1:37:35] to live in the center of God's will they
[1:37:37] wanted their own way
[1:37:39] they want we want to raise our cattle
[1:37:41] look at the grasses over here look at
[1:37:43] look at how this prosperous look at the
[1:37:44] pastures over here cattle will grow will
[1:37:47] Thrive over here so Moses just let us
[1:37:49] live over here they didn't want to
[1:37:51] sacrifice their Comforts or their
[1:37:53] Pleasures to see the will of God
[1:37:55] accomplished and brothers and sisters
[1:37:57] that's a dangerous place to live
[1:38:02] that is a dangerous place to live
[1:38:05] because as you begin to dig deeper and
[1:38:07] deeper into this and you begin to see
[1:38:09] that the tribe of rube and again and
[1:38:11] Manassas
[1:38:13] they tried to justify this they said we
[1:38:16] will we'll construct a a replica altar
[1:38:21] to God
[1:38:22] we'll have a place of worship
[1:38:25] and we're going to we're going to
[1:38:26] construct this altar over here and we'll
[1:38:28] worship it and we want to construct this
[1:38:30] altar because we don't want the rest of
[1:38:32] the children of Israel to forget about
[1:38:34] us we don't want them to forget that we
[1:38:37] were part of the message of the hour
[1:38:40] we don't want them to to forget that
[1:38:42] we're part of that Covenant people
[1:38:44] and if you find it in the scriptures
[1:38:46] you'll find that there was no rebuke
[1:38:49] nothing nothing was set harsh against
[1:38:51] them
[1:38:52] nobody corrected them Moses didn't rile
[1:38:55] up against them they just said okay
[1:38:58] as long as you'll fight with us you
[1:39:00] could have this land if that's what you
[1:39:01] want here you go
[1:39:05] but brothers and sisters I believe what
[1:39:07] happens to them
[1:39:09] is a warning it's a warning to those of
[1:39:12] us who are those around the message that
[1:39:15] just want to live on the fringes of
[1:39:16] God's will
[1:39:18] they want to live right there on the
[1:39:19] fringes of God as will and they don't
[1:39:21] want to make a full commitment to live
[1:39:23] in the center of where God wants them to
[1:39:26] be
[1:39:27] why did God let you hear the message
[1:39:30] so that you could play around the edges
[1:39:33] oh
[1:39:34] no he let you hear it because he cares
[1:39:36] he loves he wants you to see see you in
[1:39:39] that rapture
[1:39:41] so why are we playing around with it why
[1:39:43] do people play around the borders of
[1:39:45] Jordan
[1:39:49] when you look at the history these two
[1:39:51] and a half tribes you'll find that there
[1:39:52] was no Mighty Works done
[1:39:55] by the by these tribes after this point
[1:39:58] the tribes of Reuben and Manassas and
[1:40:00] gas there was no great works or deeds
[1:40:03] done there was no Mighty Warriors spoken
[1:40:06] of these of these two prophets of these
[1:40:08] tribes no prophets no Warriors
[1:40:14] hmm
[1:40:17] no mention of great events happening in
[1:40:20] their territory
[1:40:22] no words of Miracles
[1:40:25] no words of healings
[1:40:27] no words of Deliverance
[1:40:31] overcoming
[1:40:34] what happens to these people
[1:40:36] they simply begin to fade out of the
[1:40:39] record of God
[1:40:42] hmm
[1:40:44] brothers and sisters that's what will
[1:40:46] happen with the borderline believer
[1:40:49] they worse
[1:40:51] yep they'll pray they'll attend some
[1:40:54] special services when they're announced
[1:40:57] they'll show up and when it's convenient
[1:40:58] they'll acknowledge you God sent a
[1:41:00] prophet they'll say this Destiny for
[1:41:03] them on the border is to dwindle away
[1:41:11] and just like Reuben's tribe gads tribe
[1:41:15] and half of Manassas tribe they simply
[1:41:19] Fade Out of the manifested word of the
[1:41:22] hour
[1:41:25] do you think they still longed for
[1:41:28] the Miracles we're talking about the
[1:41:30] people that saw plagues come down on
[1:41:33] Egypt we're talking about people who who
[1:41:35] saw uh the rod of Moses turned into a
[1:41:38] serpent and devour The Magician's
[1:41:39] serpent we're talking about people who
[1:41:41] who saw the Red Sea part we're talking
[1:41:44] about people who saw fire and lightning
[1:41:46] come down and write and Stone The Ten
[1:41:48] Commandments
[1:41:53] and now they're just dwindling away
[1:41:57] from the message of the hour
[1:42:00] I don't want that to be my legacy
[1:42:03] you and I don't want that to be our
[1:42:05] Legacy I want the devil to know I was
[1:42:07] here
[1:42:08] I want the devil to breathe a sorrow
[1:42:10] relief when I leave here
[1:42:14] I want to get over there and I want to
[1:42:16] hear well done
[1:42:18] not what did you do
[1:42:22] how did you live
[1:42:25] you didn't you didn't inherit all I had
[1:42:27] for you
[1:42:29] um
[1:42:32] and then the funny thing is you watch
[1:42:34] how these borderline Believers are it's
[1:42:36] God's fault
[1:42:38] it says in the scripture they begin to
[1:42:40] blame God for separating them because
[1:42:42] there was a border the Jordan border
[1:42:43] between them and the other children of
[1:42:46] Israel
[1:42:47] God didn't do that
[1:42:49] that wasn't nothing God did God didn't
[1:42:51] come down and say because because of
[1:42:53] this I'm going to put this this River
[1:42:54] here
[1:42:55] God didn't do that they did that to
[1:42:57] themselves when they said we want the
[1:42:59] Comforts of this world we want the
[1:43:00] conveniences of this world we want the
[1:43:02] goodness of what's right here in this
[1:43:05] world
[1:43:09] they made the Border Reuben again they
[1:43:12] lost their identity from the rest of
[1:43:14] Israel
[1:43:15] even though they've been around the
[1:43:17] message their whole life
[1:43:19] and brothers and sisters that's the case
[1:43:21] when a part of a group separates
[1:43:23] themselves from the whole
[1:43:26] you want to know why it's so important
[1:43:27] to fellowship and worship in church
[1:43:30] because your fellowshipping and
[1:43:32] worshiping under the same Ministry
[1:43:34] everybody else
[1:43:37] you're not out here doing your own thing
[1:43:39] and thinking well this is okay or I can
[1:43:41] justify this or I don't have to do this
[1:43:43] because no you're sitting and listening
[1:43:45] under the same anointing and the word of
[1:43:47] God that everybody else is under
[1:43:51] but what you'll find is these people
[1:43:53] that's part of this group they get
[1:43:55] separated they'll develop different
[1:43:58] they start acting different
[1:44:01] they start letting things come into
[1:44:02] their life that they used to wouldn't do
[1:44:04] because they're living on the other side
[1:44:06] of the river
[1:44:09] I've seen this over and over and over
[1:44:12] and I'm sure brother Byler will attest
[1:44:14] to this people who are involved in
[1:44:16] church and commit their whole purpose to
[1:44:18] God
[1:44:19] their Christian walk is different
[1:44:22] than those that just come to church and
[1:44:23] say I'm a good message believer
[1:44:26] it's more than just being a good message
[1:44:29] believer
[1:44:32] there's a lot of good people
[1:44:34] that are not going to take a rapture
[1:44:40] [Music]
[1:44:42] but oftentimes they don't see the
[1:44:43] necessity to walk hand in hand
[1:44:46] with God
[1:44:52] they compromise
[1:44:56] that's the legacy of Reuben Gad and
[1:44:58] manasseth
[1:45:00] well that
[1:45:03] happens
[1:45:04] at least two and a half
[1:45:07] their choice left them with no barrier
[1:45:10] realize this their choice that they made
[1:45:12] left them with no uh
[1:45:16] military barrier between them and the
[1:45:18] enemy
[1:45:20] so here sets two and a half tribes of
[1:45:23] God's chosen people they should be on
[1:45:25] the other side of the river behind the
[1:45:27] walled Fortress they're sitting out
[1:45:29] there in the open for the enemy to come
[1:45:31] in and just take them one by one by one
[1:45:33] by one
[1:45:34] and that's the way the devil does us
[1:45:37] if he can separate us from the group
[1:45:40] and there's no border there's no wall
[1:45:42] there's no hedge that can be placed
[1:45:45] between you and your enemy Satan begins
[1:45:47] to come in and hit against to take your
[1:45:49] joy and your happiness and your peace
[1:45:51] and your marriage and your job and your
[1:45:53] children
[1:45:55] that's how important staying with the
[1:45:57] group and fellowshipping with God and
[1:45:59] being living on the other side of the
[1:46:01] river is
[1:46:04] I don't want to be like a Ruben a god of
[1:46:06] manasseth
[1:46:08] I don't want to settle for life on the
[1:46:09] other side of the Jordan
[1:46:11] there's no peace over there there's
[1:46:13] destruction over there instead I want to
[1:46:16] give all that I've got for God I want to
[1:46:19] sell out and the fullness into the
[1:46:21] presence of God's Will and and and I
[1:46:24] don't want to just look and say how far
[1:46:25] can I go before I'm out of the will of
[1:46:27] God
[1:46:28] because that's what a lot of people do
[1:46:29] they want to be right there I want to be
[1:46:31] in the will of God until he makes me do
[1:46:33] this
[1:46:35] I want to be in the will of God until he
[1:46:37] makes me
[1:46:38] change the way I live
[1:46:41] um
[1:46:43] [Music]
[1:46:47] let me tell you we're living in a Time
[1:46:50] I'm not going to be much longer we're
[1:46:53] living in a Time
[1:46:57] that we should be
[1:46:58] playing to win
[1:47:03] to win
[1:47:05] not playing not to lose
[1:47:08] you know there's a difference between
[1:47:09] playing not to lose and playing to win
[1:47:15] I wasn't going to tie names to this but
[1:47:18] I'm getting it
[1:47:21] we went and played golf
[1:47:24] here a while back okay and brother Josh
[1:47:27] brother Carson and brother Weston
[1:47:30] and we played golf and we paired up
[1:47:32] teams me and Weston took on Josh and
[1:47:34] Carson that's the right foursome right
[1:47:37] that's the way it was Carson said yep
[1:47:41] we pull into the last hole if you know
[1:47:43] anything about golf it's about how many
[1:47:45] strokes you can win how many you how
[1:47:47] many you're up and how many are down we
[1:47:49] pull into the last hole
[1:47:50] man Western pull up and we're one stroke
[1:47:53] down
[1:47:55] that means we got to make up two to win
[1:47:57] one to tie two to win
[1:48:00] and we pull up to the Tee Box and I
[1:48:03] watch
[1:48:04] and Carson's just getting started in his
[1:48:06] golf career so I love these
[1:48:07] opportunities to teach
[1:48:13] he pulls out a club that he hadn't been
[1:48:15] hitting well that day because he thought
[1:48:17] that was the safe safe Club to use now
[1:48:19] he's going to tell you that's not the
[1:48:21] case
[1:48:22] okay he's going to tell you if he used
[1:48:24] his other club he would hit it over the
[1:48:25] green that's what he's going to tell you
[1:48:27] but he pulls out a club
[1:48:30] and when I seen he pulled out I told Wes
[1:48:32] and I sit in my cart I said we got him
[1:48:35] he said what I said we got him I said
[1:48:37] he's playing not to lose and I'm playing
[1:48:40] to win I'm putting my ball on that green
[1:48:42] we're going to two putt for birdie he's
[1:48:44] going to miss his shot and they're going
[1:48:45] to Bogey and we win by one
[1:48:51] lo and behold
[1:48:53] shank to the right
[1:48:56] no pressure I think it was on Josh hit
[1:48:58] second he pulls his out of bounds I
[1:49:00] think into the driving range
[1:49:04] wake up
[1:49:07] Weston hits a ball I don't even know
[1:49:09] where he goes I wouldn't worry about it
[1:49:10] because I knew I was
[1:49:12] plan to win
[1:49:15] I hit my ball and Wesley said yep we got
[1:49:19] them it was flying just to straighten
[1:49:21] it's as pretty as you could a picture
[1:49:23] and it lands in front of the green by
[1:49:25] about a foot it rolls up there about
[1:49:26] between me and that drum set on a par
[1:49:29] four
[1:49:30] that's good if you don't know that
[1:49:32] [Applause]
[1:49:34] I know we don't have a lot of golfers in
[1:49:36] here so I have to help you out
[1:49:38] that's good
[1:49:40] they're hitting on another Tee Box from
[1:49:42] another hole and got about as long as a
[1:49:45] hit from the first shot to the second
[1:49:46] shot
[1:49:50] way one by one
[1:49:52] because I was playing to win
[1:49:55] and we're in a town in a time and a day
[1:49:57] when we don't have time to play around
[1:50:01] I'm not trying to just survive
[1:50:04] I'm going to be the first one in
[1:50:07] I'm going to be the one that's looking
[1:50:08] for the Rapture I'm going to be the one
[1:50:10] that fights every day of my life to make
[1:50:12] sure I make it there I'm not holding
[1:50:15] back any clubs I'm swinging with all
[1:50:17] I've got I'm gonna make that rapture
[1:50:24] we need more Joshua's in this hour
[1:50:27] we need more joshuas in this hour and
[1:50:30] the prophet said Joshua was a warrior
[1:50:32] and he was a commander to lead the Army
[1:50:34] and he said he stepped into a place
[1:50:37] where the great man like Moses stood
[1:50:42] he didn't step back around the edges and
[1:50:44] look and say I wished I could do this I
[1:50:46] wish the days of Miracles what was it
[1:50:48] wasn't passed no he said whatever Moses
[1:50:51] could do I can do
[1:50:54] listen to this he says Josh you're
[1:50:57] standing there that morning talking to
[1:50:58] God and God said I'll not fail thee as I
[1:51:02] was with Moses so shall I be with you he
[1:51:05] said I'll destroy and devour I'll make
[1:51:08] the way clear be strong be courageous be
[1:51:12] don't be dismayed
[1:51:14] listen to this he said
[1:51:18] he said we'll follow you he's talking to
[1:51:21] the children of Israel now he's talking
[1:51:22] about the children of Israel following
[1:51:24] Joseph Joshua like they was going to
[1:51:26] follow Moses he said that ought to be
[1:51:28] the requirement of every born-again
[1:51:30] person today that if we requested to
[1:51:32] follow
[1:51:33] and then let the signs follow the
[1:51:36] believer
[1:51:39] yeah if we're requested to follow this
[1:51:42] message
[1:51:43] then there will be a following of signs
[1:51:46] everywhere we go
[1:51:49] he said that's what Jesus said he said
[1:51:52] now Joshua had to take his command
[1:51:54] listen now he said oh how the church or
[1:51:57] to look this morning and find the spirit
[1:52:00] working amongst the people
[1:52:04] I've Got Confidence in the people in
[1:52:06] this church
[1:52:07] are we perfect no do we have thoughts
[1:52:10] and failures yes but I have confidence
[1:52:13] that if I have a need if I say there's a
[1:52:15] dire need in this situation will you
[1:52:18] pray I have confidence that we can see
[1:52:21] signs and wonders and miracles when this
[1:52:24] group of people pray
[1:52:26] and he says if you want to know it's a
[1:52:28] spirit that raised up Christ from the
[1:52:30] dead the holy spirit that will move
[1:52:32] amongst the people that's the spirit of
[1:52:34] that's what the spirit of God is raising
[1:52:36] up in the last days to take the people
[1:52:39] over and to the other land
[1:52:43] spirit of God is Raising it up he says
[1:52:46] and to the full promise of the blessings
[1:52:48] of God
[1:52:50] to a full commission that he gave and a
[1:52:53] promise
[1:53:00] talking about Kingdom Builders
[1:53:03] what kingdom are you building
[1:53:06] are you building your kingdom here
[1:53:08] are you like the two and a half or are
[1:53:10] you like Joshua which kingdom are you
[1:53:12] building he says we find Joshua takes
[1:53:15] this commission knowing the
[1:53:17] responsibilities
[1:53:19] was leading them through lands now they
[1:53:22] have to go over to the other land
[1:53:24] listen to what he said they have to do
[1:53:26] they'd have to set up their Kingdom
[1:53:31] Joshua has to go over there and set up
[1:53:33] his kingdom they have to divide the
[1:53:36] inheritances amongst them he said he
[1:53:38] knew the commission was tremendous
[1:53:42] we've got we've got a tremendous
[1:53:44] Commission in this last hour
[1:53:47] the words that I do shall you do also
[1:53:48] Greater Works than I do
[1:53:51] you know that that's a commission
[1:53:54] do you know how hard it is
[1:53:57] do you know it's impossible let me put
[1:53:59] it that way do you know it's impossible
[1:54:01] for a man to walk from this Dimension to
[1:54:04] the other dimension without the Holy
[1:54:06] Ghost
[1:54:08] it's impossible
[1:54:10] it cannot be done
[1:54:12] but you've been commissioned to do it
[1:54:17] you have to be like Joshua and grasp a
[1:54:19] hold of that commission he said he knew
[1:54:22] that it was tremendous far more than
[1:54:24] what Moses had done
[1:54:30] um
[1:54:32] okay
[1:54:36] Joshua had to do more than Moses
[1:54:41] had to do
[1:54:44] would you listen to these real quick and
[1:54:46] we're going to close
[1:54:49] Joshua he come to the end of the trail
[1:54:52] through the wilderness
[1:54:57] the prophet said Joshua stood there
[1:54:59] needing a bridge to cross over Jordan
[1:55:01] into the Promised Land
[1:55:04] he said God he needed a bridge
[1:55:07] but God provided a power
[1:55:12] not a bridge
[1:55:16] we will live with power and
[1:55:19] demonstration
[1:55:20] not on our works not what we can build
[1:55:23] ourselves not what our not what our
[1:55:26] social media can build us up
[1:55:28] or or what this or that or Tick Tock and
[1:55:30] all this not what all that stuff builds
[1:55:32] us but we will live and we will build
[1:55:34] our kingdom with power and demonstration
[1:55:37] he said he needed a bridge but God's way
[1:55:39] was power not a bridge he sent power and
[1:55:42] he held the river back and he walked
[1:55:45] across on dry land that was God's
[1:55:47] provided way not a bridge he had a
[1:55:50] better engineer
[1:55:54] he had a better engineer he said God
[1:55:58] likes to muddle things up
[1:56:02] I didn't say that
[1:56:04] he said it
[1:56:06] God likes to muddle things up and he
[1:56:09] likes to muddle things up to show
[1:56:11] himself God
[1:56:15] he said it was right in the springtime
[1:56:18] when summertime would have been so much
[1:56:20] better to cross this River
[1:56:23] sometimes we get in situations and
[1:56:24] predicaments in our life we think man
[1:56:26] why am I going through this at this time
[1:56:27] I I it would have been a whole lot
[1:56:29] better off if it would have been six
[1:56:31] months down the road I would have been
[1:56:32] born financially able I would have been
[1:56:35] healthier I would have had this I would
[1:56:37] have had that but he says
[1:56:39] God likes to muddle things up to show
[1:56:42] who he is
[1:56:45] and he said and and here he come in the
[1:56:48] right in the spring and one place he
[1:56:51] said the banks
[1:56:52] and Joshua was looking saying I got to
[1:56:55] get over there
[1:56:57] I got to get over there on the other
[1:56:58] side of that River he said but God let
[1:57:01] the whole valleys get filled up with
[1:57:04] water and then he come and pulled his
[1:57:06] great power down from heaven and made a
[1:57:09] dry road across it and one place they
[1:57:12] said the waters went back into the woods
[1:57:14] Into the Wilderness and stood up
[1:57:22] God is able
[1:57:24] God is capable
[1:57:26] we've heard testimonies in the last
[1:57:28] little bit we've heard testimonies of
[1:57:30] what God's done in the people here we've
[1:57:31] heard testimonies of what God's done for
[1:57:33] our church
[1:57:35] I like what what uh
[1:57:38] one brother said the lord giveth and the
[1:57:41] Lord give us again
[1:57:45] I never heard a scripture but we'll
[1:57:48] write it
[1:57:48] [Music]
[1:57:50] the lord giveth and the lord giveth
[1:57:52] again
[1:57:55] are you willing to grasp it this morning
[1:57:58] are you willing to take it and say I'm
[1:57:59] going to cross over Jordan I'm not going
[1:58:01] to be like that two and a half I'm not
[1:58:03] going to be like Manassas again I'm not
[1:58:05] going to be like Reuben that stands over
[1:58:07] there and gets comfortable in my own way
[1:58:08] of living
[1:58:10] but I'm going to take the way of the
[1:58:12] despised fear
[1:58:13] let's stand to our feet
[1:58:22] I know it was different this morning and
[1:58:23] and we've just had some really
[1:58:28] ministers coming through and brother
[1:58:30] Byler we've just had some pumped up
[1:58:31] services and it's to prepare you but
[1:58:34] sometimes we have to see where the
[1:58:36] rubber meets the road to make sure we
[1:58:37] check ourselves up
[1:58:39] and what you say well why do you why do
[1:58:41] you build us up and tear us down it's so
[1:58:44] that we make sure you don't miss it
[1:58:47] examine your life examine your heart
[1:58:49] make sure you're living where you need
[1:58:51] to live
[1:58:52] let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father
[1:58:54] we thank you for this day we thank you
[1:58:56] for the word Lord we thank you for the
[1:58:58] examples you placed on our heart we we
[1:59:01] trust Lord with all of our heart that it
[1:59:03] was pleasing to you uh the examples that
[1:59:06] we we used and we felt you leading in
[1:59:09] this direction to draw us closer to you
[1:59:11] to make sure we're not living on the
[1:59:13] outside of that border of that river
[1:59:15] that we've made commitments and we've
[1:59:17] made dedications and we find ourselves
[1:59:19] in the word crossing over into the next
[1:59:22] stage not living in a days gone or a
[1:59:24] days past but in a in a living breathing
[1:59:27] message of this hour this day we're
[1:59:30] living in
[1:59:31] we don't want to be guilty of looking
[1:59:33] back and Wrecking Our Lives on a day's
[1:59:36] gone by
[1:59:37] but we're living in a day when there
[1:59:40] will be a Rapture to take place there
[1:59:42] will be a bride and it's got to become a
[1:59:44] reality to us and the vision has to be
[1:59:46] real and we have to see it with
[1:59:47] spiritual eyes and claim it just as
[1:59:50] Joshua claimed it that he could see on
[1:59:52] the other side and said there's
[1:59:53] something calling me to a to a place on
[1:59:56] the other side of that river that
[1:59:58] I can't be content in this world anymore
[2:00:00] and whatever it takes to get over there
[2:00:02] I'm gonna get there
[2:00:05] Lord make us more like you in this hour

[2:00:29] hand say Lord accept my my plea Lord

[2:07:33] oh praise be to Jesus

[2:07:38] huh
[2:07:39] thank you sister for that song
[2:07:42] I was very good
[2:07:44] well God is good to us isn't he
[2:07:48] all right
[2:07:50] well we were
[2:08:08] our brother was preaching and he was
[2:08:12] talking about
[2:08:14] the science and wonders
[2:08:16] that
[2:08:18] supposed to
[2:08:21] be with the Believers and we can testify
[2:08:24] to that
[2:08:26] um in our
[2:08:28] voting on an assembly in our own home
[2:08:32] we we actually had
[2:08:34] Miracle after Miracle just recently our
[2:08:37] own home uh
[2:08:40] sister Tracy
[2:08:43] my wife she had a tumor for years that
[2:08:47] was just awful
[2:08:49] and I mean that this thing was ugly
[2:08:52] and it was like over 16 pounds
[2:08:56] and
[2:08:59] anyway we um we set the Lord for
[2:09:04] healing
[2:09:07] and uh you know when you pray for
[2:09:09] healing
[2:09:10] you know you can't
[2:09:13] I know this is Elementary but you can't
[2:09:15] tell God what to do
[2:09:17] you pray for healing and you leave it in
[2:09:19] his hands and we're so blessed to have a
[2:09:22] message such as we have because
[2:09:25] it's so balanced right you know some
[2:09:27] people pray for healing God doesn't
[2:09:29] answer their way and they get upset with
[2:09:30] God
[2:09:31] okay not so that's rude and and that's
[2:09:34] immature
[2:09:36] but you know brother Brandon told us you
[2:09:38] know God has different ways to heal
[2:09:41] sometimes he heals by love I understand
[2:09:43] and sometimes he'll send you to a
[2:09:45] surgeon
[2:09:47] and God said that
[2:09:50] um we would go through surgery
[2:09:53] to take care of this thing
[2:09:55] but
[2:09:57] whatever way God
[2:10:00] prepares for you to have he'll open the
[2:10:03] doors and uh God opened so many doors
[2:10:07] for us and and then along the way there
[2:10:10] were Miracles that took place
[2:10:12] and we just give God the glory for that
[2:10:15] because he proves to us over and over
