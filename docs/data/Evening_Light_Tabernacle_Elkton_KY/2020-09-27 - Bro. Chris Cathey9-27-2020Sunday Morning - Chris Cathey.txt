this morning there's a light in the land this morning the prophet that god brought this word of this hour to to write our faith up to to believe that what we have need of in this day he's preparing a bride to get out of here and i'm believing that every day as we get closer i i see like abraham searching for that city i see it coming down church i'll tell you about faith i see what john saw coming down it's it's it's in view this morning coming in plain jew i believe we got to be ready this morning i believe the bride is making herself ready by coming to church and getting in the word of god god bless you this morning it's so good to be here and uh god bless uh brother byler and the brightness and i tell you i most of all want to invite the holy spirit in this place because it's not by me it's not about my might it's by his mind i tell you as you get older you realize you need more of him your back goes out or something goes out and you realize lord i need you more well like brother said the pig was down there and the the apples were hitting the tree they realized finally he looked up and realized where the apples came from this morning i tell you i realize more and every day that my great his grace is sufficient for me we gotta realize that this morning may god bless you god bless you brother byler it's so good to be in the house of god there's no other place i'd rather be than the house of god i tell you the day's approaching there's no safety anywhere else i believe there's safety in god's ark this morning i believe that this morning god bless you musicians as we turn to um the the book of luke i want to turn to the book of luke this morning uh chapter 8 verse we'll go to verse 22. uh luke 20 uh luke 8 chapter 2 20 verse 22. it says now it came to pass of a certain day he said that went into his ship with his disciples and he said unto them let us go over let's go to the other side of the lake and they launch forth he says but as they sailed he fell asleep and there came down a storm of wind on the lake and they were filled with water and were in jeopardy he said and it they and they came unto him and they woke him saying master master we perish then he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and they and they ceased and there was a calm verse 25 i want to speak on this morning and he said unto them where is your faith he said and they've been afraid wandered saying one to another he says one to another saying what manner of man is this for he commandeth even the winds and water and they'd obey them let's pray this morning father we love you father we god we just come to the author this morning father god you are the author father you open the word father may your bride get in this love letter today father may you speak to us this morning god not just be another service but god we come to hear from you today god may if there's some souls that are bound may you unbound them this morning that you bound the spirits father may you speak to our hearts father may we leave a changed person that's closer to you god we come to the word father the word that was hung by the worlds we trust in you this morning bless your saints bless brother bile our father in this this congregation father we're all just striving to get out of here lord we love you in jesus christ's name amen you may be seated you know i want to focus on this morning where is your faith you know as we travel and me and rachel travel all over i i see a i see a fear of bro i'm on the bride this morning i see a fear on the saints just wherever we're at or we're in the gas station no more fear on them but we're living in a day that the brother christ should not have fear all over them we have a prophet in the land that came and brought the word of the god and he come down and reveal the word from genesis to revelation i mean how blessed are we this morning i'll tell you church a little background about me i was in i was raised in a home i broke up home in a baptist church and god pulled me out of the moderate clay i met rachel we've been together almost 14 years now married and and uh i tell you she come from the growing up in the message been raised in the message you know her whole life and here i come and we i met rachel and i'm just kind of going into a little bit about mia just for a minute about god this morning not about me but i tell you god pulled me from a home that was wrecked and didn't have no had no hope or had no way to go but god had a hope that he had had a plan in his life for me god pulled me from the maori clay and you might be sitting here from the baptist or catholic wherever you were but god picked you up this morning i'll tell you if you got a family that believes this message you should be thankful this morning you have a family that you i can't call my dad today and say dad i can't believe this quote i found her the word of god i found he wants to hang the phone up because he's like son i i don't know what you went into i said dad this is the best thing that ever happened to me i tell you once i saw the revelation of god i saw more than just a man i saw i saw god in a man i saw god and a man i know you got to get past the past you know somebody wants to get hung up on the man but it was god in that man i tell you he led just like he led moses he said moses went down the bush in more than five minutes of his whole ministry when he went to the bush he said it changed his life five minutes changed his life and i'll tell you sometimes there's no matter if you've been in that message 50 years or 100 years or whatever it is i'll tell you we need to have something united this morning we need to re-light our candle this morning and say where is your faith this morning i tell you sometimes we want to we want to rely and say uh well you know this virus i'm not saying there's not a virus out here but i'll tell you there's god that's greater than this virus there's a god that i put my trust in and every waking minute i have my breath comes from god i'll tell you guys when you lay down at night and you realize you're one heartbeat away from not waking up i tell you but when you trust in god you just sleep like a baby i tell you why when you when you lay down at night put your head my wife's like man you were out you were gone i couldn't wake you up if someone broke in the house you no one would even know she said i'd have to wake you up i said but you know what because i just i'm resting in god when i'm gone and when i'm in the bed i'm out because i know if i don't wake up i'm in glory i crossed over jordan i it don't matter but i tell you church i think there's a time in our lives where the bride of fight the brother christ the devil is trying to come after the bride as strong as he can two hundred thousand thousand demons just released on this earth and they're chasing the bride this morning they got these churches they got the people they got they got the world i'm not saying to be them because the same person that i was can be witness to and they could by your life or whatever and they could see the message of the hour we're still here this morning we we need someone to keep witnessing not just me or other buyer but you as well because someone in your church places could be that last seed it could be that last seat we're waiting on for us to get out of here and i'll tell you a church there's a pest house out here everywhere you go it's filth everywhere you go every time i get up i kinda just say lord help me this morning we're gonna have to get up in this filthy land but church between that six and nine hours i'm waiting for between that six to nine hour i every morning i get up i say lord this could be it i get in the car and i start to drive and it's still not nine o'clock and i'm still looking yeah i'm rolling down the window i'm nowhere i don't know what's going to happen but church i don't have all the answers but god does i might not know the whole book but i know the author of the book this morning i tell you we gotta get anchored in christ we got the bride of christ going around on earth and we got we we say we believe a message what does that mean we say we carry books and we believe this tape and we quote this quote but do we really believe what we believe i'll tell you church this time get anchored in christ this morning it's time to get the anchor of christ in your life and say i trust god greater is he that's he that's he that's in me that he that's in the world that's just not a scripture this morning that's the truth this morning i'll tell you we got to trust in that but he looked at even the disciples and they were frantic and then here comes the storm i believe storms are everywhere this morning i believe there's a virus in the land and there's this land but god is god sees it all god sees all this you don't thank god before the foundation of the world saw a virus coming in the land i believe it's an old city keeps going keep coming happening but i tell you what the bride is making herself ready she's clothing herself she's clothing herself in the word she's listening to the tapes she's making herself ready not just me but brother byler but you and you yourself not just on a sunday or a thursday or wednesday service but i'm telling you church it's the daily walk with christ i'll tell you i see the bride it's just like brother bram saw him he saw the brothers the end time he saw the bride getting out of line and he started seeing him get that line he started screaming get back in line i believe that's happening this morning i believe i see what brother bram saw when he started seeing the bride just started slipping away or oh well i could just come to church one day and i could go and do this and go do you know what every time the church door is open we should be at church home we should be bringing our kids to church like come on let's get a touch from god this morning not a touch from me but from god this morning i'll tell you a week away the the day we're living in it's dark out there but there's got and there's light in the evening time i'm glad brother brown the last he had to laugh right here he had the last episode a little life for me and you this morning in the last days because he saw lebron that was getting out of here you we might look out number but we're not outnumbered this morning we're not outnumbered if you could just see along these walls or you can see through this place i'm telling you church you'd wake you up this morning it'll put something in you it'll make you walk different active or talk different if you can just see these walls this morning you see the angels they kept them out of them oh by the word of god he says they ain't careful by us that fear god they don't just they're just not you know we're just not coming to church to play churches it's time to make business this morning it's time to come with a seal in your heart and say lord i want more faith i'm tired of living in fear and anxiety and depression i tell you church brother brown talks about you know he has the statue of a perfect man and you got faith at the bottom and you got virtue knowledge timber is patience brotherly kindness and love well i think our our foundation is not built on faith this morning it might be built on something else lost or something of the world this morning but i'm telling you church we got to get our foundation built on faith this morning you know when i'm building a house and they started digging the footers i was building the house the other the other month and they started they called me up said we had to go six foot deeper because we didn't hit solid ground i said oh goodness because then we had more rock and more rock and it cost more and started raising the price up but we didn't know until we got in there they kept digging to the hip solid ground i think this morning we got gotta hit solid ground this morning we gotta dig deep this morning i'll tell you what i don't know we're all scared that you know i see people are talking somebody somebody called me the day minister called me said this and that the people's church and i said well we could we pray for him but i tell you it takes the faith of god that's going to get you out of here it's the faith of god trusting in god that builders maker like abraham his billiard maker was god everything i have now my cars my house everything we have it's it's gonna all burn up but i'll tell you church if we just believe in the author this morning this word he said heavens and earth and will pass away but my word of god will not we gotta get claimed in the world we gotta clothe ourselves i don't i tell you what church i'm not i'm telling you we go through trials and things all the time with with our family or this or that or maybe somebody calls but you know what we need to get a prayer i said we need to get prayer back in the homes we need to have more prayer in the homes and and touch god this morning i think god wants to hear from us but sometimes we don't want to hear from him we want to hear from others or someone that's got a call we call a friend or we say hey what do you got to say about this hey god wants you to call him up and say hey what do you got to say to me this morning what are you speaking to me if it's a relationship or a family matter god wants to hear from you you know we want to call somebody say hey hey listen to this what do you think i'm i'm a bad about it i'll call this or call i'll keep calling until i get the answer that i need but sometimes i just say lord forgive me i need to pray to you because you have the answer you have the answer god has our answers if we just yield to him this morning and trust him and say god i need you this morning i'll tell you it takes faith but i like what he said he said the masterposing in verse 24 and they came to him and he walked him and said master master we perish and then he rose and rebuked the wind and rage in the water and they ceased and they they were calm and he said where is thy faith i believe that's what's happening today that we're kind of like going back like the disciples were we're in this boat and we're all trying to get out of here and we're like the storms start to raging and family problems start to come and the virus comes to the land and you say hey where's our faith where's our faith are we trusting in god this morning are we are we calling on god on the scene this morning saying god oh get me out of here i believe if we could all just join together as a bride this morning and say god i'll tell you why lord please come get us come quickly lord i believe he's waiting for a bride to just keep calling his name calling his name i believe god i believe that god is close to the mercy seats about over he's calling people in i've never seen so many people being baptized and families being brought in and people being saved right here at the end time because he said he'd leave this 99 to go after one this morning hold on church i'll tell you god cares this morning if do you care this morning turn to hebrews chapter 11 this morning everybody's pretty familiar with this he says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for if it by the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god aren't you thankful for that this morning that everything was framed by the word of god so that things which were seen were not made things which they do appear and it goes through and i'm not gonna have time to go through it all this morning but enoch he said by faith enoch was translated he could he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him and that wonderful verse 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him church i think we need to make a note tonight or this morning and say uh it's not just by faith but are you diligently seeking the lord are you searching for a stronger walk in the lord are you searching for something just greater than i just want to be complacent or just be stagnant or do i just i've been in the message for 20 or 30 years or 40 years and i carry a book and i said quote it's more than that church it's more it's a it's a deep walk it's a deep call it's a it's a high calling church i tell you church is a high calling to be children the sons and daughters of the king broadband said one place and i really like it i paraphrased it this morning but he said that sinner or he said he was comparing the angels compared to the sinner and he said which one was higher which was lord he said the sinner's higher than even angels he said because they were already us as we are saved by grace he said the children and he basically said the children of god this morning are higher than the angels this morning the children said the children are going higher than the angels this morning oh they should put a smile on your face that should make you wake up and say greater is he that send me the he that's in the world holy make it when you go to work it should make you put a song in your hearts that should make you say you know what i'm going through a battle but god's in this battle i'll tell you like joshua and all them throughout the battle and they're in the battle and they stop the sun and whatever you have need of this morning hey he's he seemed it yesterday today and forever no matter what you have need of he can do it two thousand years ago whatever it is he he's same yesterday today and forever oh church i'm telling you when you realize that god is on the scene when you when you apply your faith this morning oh sometimes we get stagnated in our faith but i'm here to wake you up this morning and tell you that god is real and this message of the hour has come to wake up the bride and say hey bride we're closing you this morning brother brown preached the message is the second handed robe and i think what he's doing he said i'll put the robe on her i'm putting a robe on the bride this morning and sometimes we want to try to fit in it but we're going to let god put the robe on this morning we gotta let god put the code on this morning you know when you go get signs for a coat they size you up but i tell you god is sizing us up this morning he's got a virus in the land but he's sizing this up this morning saying is he truly who he says he is is he true is his sister truly who she says he is church is the greatest vital but but you know you think about joshua and all them they got we got to possess the land he said it's not you know he didn't say it was a picnic but said it was a battle he said it was a daily battle we gotta fight he said we gotta fight for every inch of ground this morning church we're fighting this morning and we're fighting for every inch and it might not be easy but that church is almost over it's almost over i tell you i see the light shining i see it coming down i every morning i get up i say one day closer to you lord oh if i don't wake up i cross over if i lose everything i still i gain i gain the word of god i gain heaven i tell your church when we realize who our father is we know who our daddy is this morning we're not just talking about him said he would get his son he would get him up in their lap and he would put him in their lap and brother said he would say they would sit up in their lap and he would say daddy show me your muscles my brother said show me your muscle he said it made me feel good he said made me feel good he said think about what the father says when you say show me your muscles think about what the father says when you say god i need you i know i'm he'll bury her this morning i hit the red sea this morning and he makes the red sea he makes the sea stand at attention this morning oh church we realize who our father is we're sons and daughters of a king this morning oh church we were both with a price paid on calvary hold church when you realize that make you shout it'll make you sing this morning it'll make you walk different make you talk different this morning oh church when i look out there i said god i see what you did for me on calvary oh church i'm telling the church it excites me i know i'm not upset this morning i'm excited this morning because god think about it he went down gotham and got on this cross for you and me this morning but you know what when they when they started to black out these they get called 10 the legions of angels all their angels could have came but he saw i believe i believe when he was on that cross he saw millions of miles away and he saw every one of us this morning and he saw a bride this morning that said hey they're going to live for me no matter if they go through a virus or they go through this or they go through that doesn't matter what they go through you know what he's gonna trust me he's gonna walk with me but i'll tell you church where is your faith this morning we gotta raise up hey wait we got a little but remember in one place he said the bride is living below her means she's not asking god what she needs she's telling others what she needs or do i tell my wife this or i come home and say hey this is this but sometimes i say look let's just pray let's just go to the author he knows the answer i don't have the answer i sometimes feel like i had the answer or you know as a husband you always want to fix something or do this or she's like hey just listen to me just just sit down and listen i just want to talk you don't have to fix nothing i think we treat god that way sometimes you know hey let me tell you what i want to tell you no let god tell you what he wants to tell you let him show you your path of life like the word says the path of life i believe he's showing us a path to life and it's the greatest path i could ever live in it's the greatest path i could ever walk in it's the greatest path we could ever see is there is you know like abraham and sarah think about it 65 and 75 he he had faith in god 25 years he kept waiting in the promise imagine how many people looked at him and said you're crazy you've lost your mind oh church it ain't just us it's throughout the whole bible david the goliath think about it brothers they have 14 inches fingers i mean imagine having that big of a hand and fingers and here comes david and here comes paul here comes saul at the time and saul says well i'll just i'll put this on you and it's like brother said he was an old ruddy old fella and he said he put these ar he put his own armor on him he said it was just about to fall off of him but he had faith in god he said i don't care he said i saw what god can do i saw what god can do for me i saw god heal cancer i saw god heal the blinded eyes i tell you god he is still the same yesterday today in favor i'm not just telling you i'm talking about experience this morning i've been in revivals where people's been healed of cancer whatever it is because god is greater than what we can think of i'll tell you when you start thinking with your eyes you don't think you people don't think you in this world you don't think you think logical because of this world you're you're going from the inside what i've said there's the body the spirit and the soul and our church we got to get past the body you know where you feel taste here and in the spirit conscience memory affection reason imagination we got to get into the soul this morning but he said in that soul there's two things there's faith in doubt but church i get past that this morning not just a feeling i got god or oh i just said oh i prayed to god and said god forgive me of my sins but truly meant business with god and said god i'm turning from my ways god i need you to help me but go out late at these altar this morning and i said god you give me faith to never turn back to that again we gotta have an upper room experience this morning more than just a little just a little experience or oh i believe god but the bride of christ i'll tell you what we should be we should be robert said we should be the happiest people brother said we should be the happiest people walk around here and say hey how's your day all well well you know what hey we all have a bad day we all have this and all have trials and tribulations but i tell you what i try my best to come home rachel said how you dance it was great it was good because i could take that negativity and just start going down that road and before long the whole house is depressed the kids are depressed the kids come today and say hey dad are you oh well you know the day will do and then they want to go away they want to run out they weren't in the bedroom and shut the door i'll tell you church just be positive barbara said be positive i'll tell you church try it one time i'll tell you what just go in there and going there you'd be the worst day ever just start talking positive thoughts start claiming that hey he said when you're sick he said to walk into it he said to claim it this morning he said when you're sick you start you so your body obeys your confession this morning i'll tell you i start i start going well i'll sing a song or rachel get on the piano and play a song or i'll be down and out she'll play and she'll be just singing away i get caught up in the atmosphere and i start to realize oh my goodness jesus is in the house i started to realize that that that that doesn't matter any more it might look like a big situation this morning whatever you come in this church with this morning it might look big you know but caleb got his mountain i don't care how big it looks but if you can trust god this morning and have faith in god god will sell you through god will see you through this morning oh but faith the definition of faith complete trust or confidence in something someone or something complete trust i believe we're gonna have complete trust in god this morning not just a little bit of trust but complete trust in our father this morning we're to have trust in god that that if he's all or all then we go to our father this morning say god i need you in this situation but a substance it says that now the faith is the substance of things hoped for but the evidence of things not seen it says substance what's this definition a particular kind of matter it says a intoxicating stimulating drug especially he said a real physical matter on which a person or things consist that has tangible solid presence oh church if we could just get intoxicated in jesus this morning oh if we could just get a substance in you this morning and get intoxicated in jesus this morning it'll change your life oh it'll change your family's life it'll change your kids it'll make you talk different walk different act different i'll tell you what i tell you get around a bunch of believers or go to somewhere or go to a fellowship they call you and they go you know there were some true good i mean i tell you there's something about them people you don't have to say say a whole lot about them there's something about them because the bride of christ they're sons and daughters of the king i mean church i'm not just telling you this more if you haven't met jesus this morning i invite you to to dedicate your life or ask god forgive you and turn from it if you haven't been baptized brother i know brother byler would would turn on the water right now but i tell you what i tell you what when one sinner repents all heaven rejoices i tell you why i rejoice because i'm not here in the battlefield so i told rachel i'm not in it for the money i'm here for one more soul he said one world is one soul's worth 10 million worlds my bank account is looking up into heaven now and what we got on earth because as you see the economy's failing everything's failing i believe they're just they're just i think they're just trying to blind their eyes with how bad it really is how bad the economy really is but church i'm not here to fill you with fear this morning i'm here to fill you with the truth this morning i'm here to fill you that that that it's all going to fail anyway it's going to crash i don't know when it's gonna crash but it's gonna crash but if you have your hope and your faith in jesus christ this morning it don't matter this morning it don't matter because we serve a god that's coming forth for his breath you think about how long he's waiting for his bride think about that you know i met rachel and i was like oh this is the one and we talked to this and that and we went through the courtship process and this and i said rachel you know you've been in the message and this and that you never went in the world you never did this never did this i said rachel you know we might as well not get married i said i was in the world i came from the world but god saved me by grace and she just said no no that's okay i you're the one you're the one god told me you're the one i felt she was the one but by god's grace we never can feel uh big enough for god we never feel like we brought enough to them but but by grace god saved us this morning god stepped on the calvary went to calvary for every one of you this morning when you get up every morning or where you come to church or you're listening to the word you know he told brother i was up about the gym at dawn's church not long ago and brother he just asked for the gym at dawn brother branham he he was very competitive and brother jim don't look at brother branham he said he said how do i be the best christian i can be hey brother brother uh brandon look at brother jimmy dalton he said read your bible and pray pray pray that's all he said it wasn't no deep revelation of well let's go here and let's go there he said read your bible and pray every day i believe that's what we're missing this morning i believe we're missing a truth that this is a love letter this morning to the bride this is a love letter to the bride do you care this morning do we get in enough do we have a true relationship they're starting to sing because we're not in the word of god enough i believe our our families are not i have an alter prayer having a family prayer this morning and say hey hey listen let's pray this through or listen let's not talk about it let's just pray isaac you pray there'll be times sometime in the bed we just get around and say all right everybody's going to pray tonight i'll pray and isaac said we start from the youngest the oldest whatever it is i said it don't matter let's just start praying everybody pray before long we're just all praying the holy ghost comes down i tell you what when you get intoxicated with the substance of jesus christ you want him always to be in your presence i tell you want to always be surrounded by you but i like what it says is the substance of things hoped for the evidence not seen i like i said it's a real a real matter real evidence but evidence is right here i'm reading the evidence uh definition the uh available body of facts of information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid church does god does jesus have enough evidence on us this morning that we can find guilty in jesus this morning does he have enough evidence in us this morning to say are we convicted that we're under jesus christ this morning would he say hey i have enough evidence on that day when we get in front of jesus christ does he have enough evidence to say hey he's on my side that's kind of like had he right she didn't see she saw god and she she saw beyond brother branham and she's sitting there and it blew my mind when i first came the message and heard hey wright's story and my and it got to actually my brother my father-in-law talked to haley wright and all them and it just was it just really really god just off what she said i mean she just said that she just looked at him and they were they were talking hey wright was sitting there and she just sitting there and just off what she said she said that's nothing but the truth he said you can have anything you want you have money i want the salvation of my voice you know i don't care someone said we're boys the other day so whatever here i don't care where they're at there's the salvation is done she got what she needed of i don't care what it's a picture of the day you might look at something that looks different to you but god sees it all different it's all the clouds we might say oh well you know the devil always wants to say well look at this and oh look at her boys now but you know what they're saved this morning because it was just her uh she obeyed the word she she agreed with the word you know i'll tell you church we can realize how much just agreeing with the word of god this morning will do for us i'll tell you it'll save you he said the worlds were formed by the word of god everything we have needed brother said the stars are in place every time we look out the stars are in place the general is in place he said one place he said he's put the five stars on his ride this morning he said he said j-e-s-u-s f-a-i-t-h he gave us the five stars this morning but the great commander-in-chief this morning i was in the military for 12 years i was serving in the army went here went there went all over but i tell you this is the greatest military the greatest army i could ever serve in was when i came and saw this lights when i saw this wonderful light i tell you the rest of the family went one way i went one way i tell you i've been happy and crazy ever since i said dad just leave me alone i love it i said because the more i read this word of god and the more i listen to my tapes the more i realize how much i need them and i realize i realize that i'm just faulty i'm just a place of clay i told someone today i'm just i'm just a piece of clay trying to be formed and shaped in god's image and i'm doing my best that that i could get in the word every day and pray every day and raise up my faith but the word of god says you know it says it says if the to raise your faith is by hearing the word of god it takes hearing the word of god so when i see faith falling in this day there's the only i just go back to the word that we're not in the bible enough we're not listening to the brother by or the minister enough or we're not listening to the word of god that's coming forth enough that we're not we're not listening to what god has to say to us this morning i tell you says it comes by faith it comes by hearing the word of god i believe that with all my heart this morning that that it's by faith that we're gonna make it but in hebrews 12 verse 2 it says looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despised in the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god aren't you thankful this morning that god is sitting at the right hand of god he's sitting there far above the moon's the star he's far above it all and he's on the right hand of the father making an intercession for our confession this morning old church we can realize when we walk we walk in the church or we start to pray who we're speaking to this morning we're just not speaking to somebody this morning we're speaking to the author this morning oh that formed the worlds framed the word of god this morning we're not just speaking to our health or i mean you think about it you're kidding it hits me more every day and i used to get joe and say well i want this and you know what broadband said when you ask god for something he looks at the motive and objective brother said god looks at your motive and objective don't you do the same thing when your child comes to you he says well i need this or i need this i'll say well you know maybe this oh an ipad nah well we started to realize they started to pray what can that lead their minds to or what could that bring them down to where that could mean they already get enough in their little we do a little homeschool group back at home and i don't know there's probably what 50 kids in it and it was always from kindergarten all the way to fifth and every year they had a great trade and we got a building it's nothing all message kids all of them but they're all from all different walks of life kids will come home and tell me this or say a joke and well that ain't right they shouldn't well i know they gotta rub you gotta rub shoulders with the world but they're in these schools and we're in this little what we call message school but they all come from all different walks of life you know the parents might need to read the bible with them they might not even they say they're in the message but not even reading the bible with the kids not even they're they're saying jokes they shouldn't say to him then he gets there and i said all right he can't do that no you shouldn't say and but but god's doing that with his children this morning he we're reading the word and he's taking one thing off of us every day saying hey this is this shouldn't be here or this shouldn't be here or that shouldn't be here he's every day he's taking things away from me and i'm so thankful that he's he's cleaning us up and he's about to present us to the bride you think about the bride she goes away and she prepares months for a wedding that brother chase shop talks about to get married and back at home and repairing months and months for a wedding but i tell you church i'm preparing every day for that true wedding supper that's in the air i'll let you but i'm excited this morning i'm excited i'm looking like abraham saul and john saw that city coming down i got faith this morning it's about to happen it's not just something i'm just sitting here trying to tell you this morning i'll tell you i went back and forth back and forth and what to say and what to preach on and god said hey speak on faith we need more faith this morning not just a a waiver in faith but but a faith that has a root a foundation this morning one that has one that has a foundation and i was looking at joshua joshua this morning verse one chapter one and it said now after the after the death of moses the servant of the lord came to pass and the lord spoken to joshua the son of nun moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore rise go after the jordan now and all the all this people unto the land and i'll give he said i do give to them even to the children of israel every place that your soul of your feet shall tread upon that have i've given them to as i said unto moses from the wilderness and from lebanon he's and he keeps going and just to skip down for time for a spot there shall not any man be able to stand before thee in all the days of thy life as i was with moses i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee aren't you thankful for this morning that we can say god that you said you'll never leave us or forsake us this morning oh don't you make you excited that this morning that he said wherever your souls of your your feet should try i'll be there with you oh church i just believe it this morning if you're a children of god this morning if you had to get to the well this morning oh if you just came back to christ i'm telling you to get into the fountain of living water that will fill you not by me but something that will that will be everlasting that will change your life that'll keep cleansing you it's a process church it don't take one day it takes several days and days and months and years it's a it's a daily cleansing it's like david said that mercy is new every morning i believe that church we got we gotta believe in trusting god more we gotta have faith in god more but verse six he said listen to this he said be strong and of good courage for unto the people shalt thou divine for inheritance the land which i swear to their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee i tell you church we need to be strong and courageous verse 9 had not i commanded thee be strong of good courage be not afraid neither nor be thou dismayed for the lord god is with with either whatsoever thou goest church i believe that this morning i believe god knows where we go you know he sees everything he sees everything he's telling josh hey look you're moses moses is gone but wherever your feet goes i'm gonna be with you you know what the prophet is is gone all of them are gone now think about billy graham all of them even the ones that down for sodom lot you know the ones down through there and that bro that they're all they're all gone all the angels of the earth i mean all it is is the coming of the lord he's preparing a bride but we got to pick up our face but we got it we get we get it by the hearing of the word of god and i i sometimes say well have you listened to a table oh well i listen to one about a month ago well you know my dad told me this quote or the pastor said this quote i made a note on it it's more than that it's a personal relationship with god god you he wants somebody that will commune with him and you commune back he wants somebody that you will talk to and say father i love you i'm going through this but more than just saying hey god i need your help but just why don't you look up to him and say god i love you this morning oh it said just crying out to him and saying what you have need of what you tell him how much you appreciate them this morning oh how much more that a father looks at a son he goes dang i love you i appreciate you well i thank you for serving and what you do for our family i think you leave the house at seven o'clock you might come on my wife gets on to me leave it seven get home at seven every day i think it is it's about that if i'm lucky it's it's to get home to even eat with the kids without telling but but i have to get out to provide for a family i have to get out to provide this to provide for the family i'll tell you what i just do it just get one more soul into the kingdom of god one more soul to get closer to jesus christ and then i get out there and i say but listen what god done for us he he was marred more than any other image any other message he was marred for me and you this morning he wants to have communion with you every day everything you do he wants to talk to you he wants to be quiet enough your home or i'll be at work and we'll build in the house and brother obi does the pain does phenomenal paint paint work and he's in there painting i'll come in he'll have the music on all of a sudden brother always just just intoxicated in the lord and before and all i could have the worst day ever and all of a sudden holy ghost falls on me and then i'm intoxicated i tell you church we got to get intoxicated in jesus today i'm not talking about it peter said they're not drunk like you suppose they're drunk in the lord this morning oh they're filling up on the lord and i believe we got to be what joshua did we got to trust in god that says wherever our souls are wherever we go god's with us god cares for us god just does not we're not just going through the the city or we're going through this dark hour without jesus christ god's cares this morning i tell you when you get hurt and you your back gives out or something goes out you'll realize who's carrying you you realize you start to look up and say you know what god is carrying me he was carrying me the whole time it's like with a little passage where they look back there was two feet printed four free prints and all sudden there was only two and he said i was carrying you i believe god's carrying his bride this morning if we just get in the boat and say god i need you to help me lord and stop going against the current we want to go against the current and say god i need y'all by faith we're going to get there i don't know how i don't see how we're going to make this late hour we got this you're closing churches we live in louisville kentucky we have a curfew now and at night at church you got to close it you got to cut the certain light tonight they said they got to cut the sherman off as quick as they can because the curfew and the the rioting and it's a mess i'll tell you yo you see it everywhere you see the gas stations the way people talk to you wherever you go but i'll tell you i don't want you i'll have a tape on i'll get depressed i'll get back in the car and then i'm back i'm back i'm like praise god thank you i mean thank the lord we have these messages to turn to thank god that i have a bible that i could turn to and say god this world is not my home i'm just a passing through oh i just started singing them old time songs and it just starts to fill me up it starts bubbling inside it's like broadband said he'd go to that well down there we wish him well and we'd go down there by jeffersonville and he said start bubbling and he said why does it make you so happy he said because there's something on the inside there's something on the inside that's bubbling up this morning that's that's rising up abroad that says i got faith in you jesus i got faith in you my faith don't lie in my man i'll let you down but jesus christ won't let you down oh i'll tell you i'll just put you punch you to a man that's paid at all this morning a man that will give you everything you have need of if you come to a depression or anxiety or a family member that needs saved this morning there's somebody that could save them this morning there's still mercy on the mercy seat this morning we just gotta live a life it ain't about what you say this morning or i say this so i gotta say this it's just saying god you have control it's not about what you say they watch your life kids watch your life family members walk my dad will call me today he'll go he'll you can ask rachel he'll say he said about four about four or five years ago maybe he looked at me rachel we were riding down the road been married 10 years and we're about 14 now and he said son he said the very thing i kept you from my your grandmother my grandma was the only one that saw this message he's 83 years old today still believes his message with all our heart my mom got saved she died about five years ago 50 something years old she died about five years about seven years ago and she came lord got re-baptized gave her life and not even within probably a couple years she she wouldn't be with the lord she let me get divorced at a really young age but she lived with my mom most of her her mom most of her life and she got re-baptized and saved and gave her heart back to god but within two years god knows god cares god god's got the program we don't we don't have the program it's god's program i just want to get in the program i just want to get in the wheel and let the wheel just in the wheel in the middle of the wheel this morning but we come home and my dad said he said you know the very thing that i pulled you your mom and our whole family we traveled the world my dad was a corporate controller of like eight plants and he said the very thing that i tried to keep you from my whole life he thought this about five years ago he said the very thing that i tried to keep you from you went into son i said dad why didn't you tell me sooner i said dad why didn't you tell me sooner i was like the guy at the barbershop when he looked at brother billy paul brother billy paul told me this story he said back in jeffersonville he said he said the i think it was the dentist it was the dentist i'm sorry and he said he walked up with a book and he was in the dentist chair and the dinner said he handed him a book and he looks at the book he said what is this it was a book about his dad and his ministry and what he believed in some quotes and he said what's this and he went on to explain he said he said why didn't you tell me why didn't you tell me he said why didn't you tell me and i said dad i'll tell you you can't get me going i'm going now because i tell you why couldn't you tell me sooner why can't you kinda least listen in or pick the word up for yourself and realize that that ain't nothing but the truth this morning but i tell you they talk it takes a little relationship with god more than just saying i'm gonna hide behind a message i'm behind behind a messenger it's more than that it's picking our faith up this morning and saying god i want to read every word of god and i want to be clothed with your words i want to be clothed with your word my family needs it everything else will burn up but your word will not and more than just saying i believe it or i could say a quote but truly truly come in one with the word of god it's becoming one with the word of god this morning i'll tell you brother i'm saying this message time tested faith he said but it's so simple to have faith he said for instance you cannot move out of your seat if you were able to come in and sit down you cannot move from your seat unless you have faith that you'll do it he said you can put your hat on again unless you have faith you can do it he said never can you draw another breath unless you have faith you can do it faith is so common that when you look at it for something a little unusual we go way over the top for it trying to find it's what's right next to us he says old testament when the blood was applied over the lentils of the door i told him they put his my hyssop dipped in the blood and rubbed over the door hips it's just a common weed he says then how appropriate that is tonight to apply hyssop as faith he said put the blood of blood on by faith he said how we've covered by the blood by faith common faith he said well you say but for miracles and for healing brother brahm is some different type of faith no it's the same faith he said there's only one faith in all things he says all things and all things are the original it's fake church you don't believe how much faith you gotta have you get out in your car and you crank it up you have faith that it's going to crank up this morning yeah i had faith that when i get up this morning that we're going to drive whatever two hours and a half that we're gonna have faith even though we know what time to get up that we had faith in the car to crank this morning i had faith that i told my brother hey i'll be there but that was faith this morning that was but but when we realized that we we serve a god that's greater and i serve a god that i put my faith and trust in this morning not in my wife not in my kids but in a god that i trust that god will look down and when i push the button it cranks it's my faith that everything we do we eat we breathe everything we do is by faith but you get the airplane whatever it is whatever you do you know we don't we don't sometimes we don't we don't i don't we don't have to we'll have to check in july and we'll still drive it think about it you'll get in the car and you'll oh well we'll forget about that we'll just keep driving maybe it blows up in five minutes we don't know oh well it's been on for a year it'd be fine but you know what that's sometimes with our lives in christ the engine lights on sometimes the engine lights on i believe some of the engine lights are on we got this virus going around town and the engine light's on in our life and we're all around oh my gosh what are we going to do no you need to have a checkup with jesus and let him cut the engine light off this morning and tell you look greater is he that's in me that he is in the world and you said the world's reformed by the word of god i'm in the word of god i trust you if if something happens to my body well then i'm just going to be with the lord i tell you church we gotta raise up our faith this morning and trust god that that he's our all in all he he feeds us he provides he puts a house shelter over us he gives us a job he puts food on our table i'll tell you church that's faith this morning that's faith when when i say honey i'll be right i'll be back in about ten hours i gotta go to work but i'm gonna bring my food home for you tonight or whatever it is i'm gonna go make the money to bring home the food whatever it is that's faith i tell you every brother abraham said in this message he said everything we do is based on faith the way we breathe the way we act well whatever we do we have to have faith to do it i believe church we're we our world's starving for that he talked about the 25 cent i really like that he said he could have the 25 cent he could have the purchasing power to buy that loaf of bread but hey he was just as content with the 25 cent in his pocket because he knew he had the purchasing power church if we would believe today that there's purchasing power in the blood of christ this morning let's purchase a price for your sin this morning let's purchase the price on the cross that hey we have it this morning that we have we have the purchasing power that died on the cross that was that was the greatest thing we could ever have this morning we have it in our pocket this morning say god i had the purchasing power devil i had the purchasing or you can touch my family oh you can't take my job god gave it to me anyway i'll tell you i had someone tell me what that well this and that well you as well pay you this i said it don't matter i said because i don't get your pay all right pay comes from god everything i do comes from jesus christ and that's what we gotta get into is church we gotta stop relying on someone else and loan our girls girls up and pull our pull our britches up per se and put our belt on and have the faith of god this morning and say god i trust you no matter what i go through no matter what i go through god we've been down this road before i tell you something like down in thomas we go down a road and we go through trials and tribulations and things come in our life and we get all down and we start to doubt again and we've already been through that eight years ago oh we've been in that four yard brother tom might have been through it aren't you thankful that we have older ministers or older people to church or somebody that we could an elder in the church or we could turn to say hey son put his arm around me the other day he said hey chris i've been through that before but god got me through aren't you thankful that you had that this morning that you could turn to somebody and say hey how did you deal with it hey i just put my trust in faith in god you might not be able to see through it you might all by the you kind of see the fog at the per se but god has got his hands on the bride this morning god cares god loves you this morning i'm just pointing you to the to the author this morning to tell you god cares i tell you god cares like when he went to went to the tomb and he went to well he went to the lazarus and he called lazarus out and he's looking for martha and all them where'd you put him what'd you put him where where where's your faith why'd you doubt where's he at i'm i mean uh his body was set in corruption aren't you thankful about that i'm so glad i got that promise this morning that his body was sitting in the grave he was all they buried up hey where's he at i don't care get up lazarus he's always saying he said call he said that he wasn't just saying by name everything would have come out of the grave i'll tell you but aren't you thankful that's coming between that six to nine hour that that your loved one's gonna get out of the grave and the graves gonna break through one morning between that six and nine hours and they come walking through the door and they say everything you have faith in is right here this morning when they walk in the door and say hey pack your bag don't even worry about packing your bags just come on because you don't need nothing here you don't need your car you don't need anything just come on and walk just walk like any walk just come on come on chris when i see my mom come through the door and say hey he said that then christ shall rise first all right you think about it but if my mom walks in the door and you see a loved one and he walks the door i tell you that'll give you a shout in faith right there i'll tell you you want some faith you see it love when you walk in the door you're gonna have some faith oh you might have a little better idea i'm telling you when you see a loved one walk in you're going to walk out of here when you see a loved one walk in hey brother tom hey uh you start looking you realize who they are i tell you why can you imagine how beautiful they're going to be back there around 20 21 years old the prime of their life they walk through there and we have change of body we meet jesus and well i'll tell you church that's going to be a day of shouting and victory this morning you're going to think oh he said all these trials that we've been through and you're not going to see nothing all these trials and this and that you can't my wife my wife's father's been in the hospital seven months he has about he got that virus and he got put in hospital for seven months and the first time they saw him was like last week last week they saw him for the first time in seven months because they couldn't touch him he couldn't see him they couldn't come in close with them then they took them all and put them on this one floor where all the virus places were and finally they saw him rachel sent me out she did a facetime the other day i was driving she said you got a minute i said yeah i do and all sudden i see my father-in-law she's in there i'm like whoa how did that happen like how did that work that what that was faith that was faith that you would get through them doors and go over there and have faith that they would let you in seven months i tell you it's tearing up the land but i tell you what the bride of christ is not moving lebron i'm just here to tell you this my family anything i could tell you this morning faith is our victory faith is our victory this morning it's my victory is not in this thing of the world or the stock market or what the money things can buy it's in jesus christ this morning and i'm telling you you've got to get girded up in faith this morning and you got to put the faith the shelter the helmet of armor this morning and say god i'm going to make it no matter what i'm going to see my family through and so we got scriptures all over the place all over our doors and you know for me and my house we're going to serve the lord i tell you we're going to serve the lord i don't no matter what we go through like we'll have family battles or whatever battles you're going through but you and your family keep pressing on oh keep pressing on i'm telling you it is tough out there but i tell you we serve a god that's greater than that anything we have we serve god that's greater than any that's above the stars the moons that's like i said in hebrews 11 he hung the world like romans 8 well i mean romans 10 verse 17 so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god that's what we're doing here this morning we're the only people want to know have an answer but i'm saying there's always a bible answer if you open it up and just go find it where faith comes it comes by the hearing of the word of god so when your face starts to get a little weak listen to the word of god read the word of god listen to the prophet let it dubs held together and it will raise your faith you think you got weak faith given the word more that's what the word of god says ephesians well here i'm about close here shortly ephesians chapter two we'll skip down to verse four but god who is rich in mercy great love wherein he loved us even when we were dead and sins had quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit in heavenly places in christ jesus all that should excite you this morning that in the ages that come he might show the exceeding riches of his of his grace and his kindness towards us through christ jesus for by grace ye are saved through faith through faith and not of yourselves it is the gift of god church ain't nothing you could do there ain't nothing what you can work up there ain't no emotions you can work out to be saved it's a gift to god this morning it's like me handing the gift to a neighbor it's like me doing this the other day we do this or give this to somebody hey i don't want that i don't care what you want i'm going to give you this god told me to give this to you it's a gift keep it god died on the cross he gave all his whole life for me and you this morning every one of us this morning he gave you breath in your body if you have health in your body whatever it is you walked in this church you should be praising god this morning had a father-in-law hadn't been off the bed in seven months finally started getting back up walking they called rachel last night at one o'clock in the morning and said man this man is strong it's an ox ain't been a bad seven what's that man about to tear the place down he's like get me out of this place but it was faith he he trusted a higher power than what he has it takes faith in god this morning but like i said but before about four by grace we are saved through faith not of ourselves it is a gift of god oh church i tell you it truly is the gift of god if you trust god this morning it's like that it's like lebron said that story i really like where he talks about where he goes some ass asks the slave he asked he asked him he says hey is that why is that slave act different this is what's going on do you feed them different brother said no i don't they don't feed them different we don't feed the seed you know he told the story he said i don't feed that slave any different he said i was wondering the same thing he said he started researching i'll tell you church you should make a shout right here he said i started researching i started looking up and i started realizing where oh he was a child of the king he said that's what made him different he said he started looking down through his heritage and realized his daddy was a child of the king he said he acted different he did everything different he said he acted like the boss he said but he's just a save just like everybody else church when you realize you're a child of the king this morning you realize when you have a prayer this morning it goes beyond these walls this morning it goes beyond the ceiling this morning it goes greater than your faith it goes to jesus this morning that's sitting on the right hand the father this morning saying hey have faith in me this morning you come through these doors you got depression or anxiety or family that's lost or whatever it is god's greater than that this morning i'll tell you you got to trust god this morning to have faith in him you have the purchasing power we just got to claim the purchasing power this morning and realize who our daddy is that we're just not we're just not talking to or just a hell of this imagine like a earthly daddy we're talking to a daddy that formed their world they put the stars in there in the earth we're talking to a daddy that that that paid the ultimate price for our sins this morning that brother brown said one drop of blood is like a thing of clorox and it just wipes it white as snow oh church can't you think about it i'll tell you we we think about our sins and you just put it down there one drop of blood cleanses it all oh sickness whatever it is he's paid that price this morning oh church you don't make it you know he'll put something in you this morning he'll give you zeal it'll make you happy this morning it'll put something in you that make you have a character this morning i tell you church you're gonna change your life it's changing me every day this word of god is i'll tell you every day i wake up i want to just get more of them i want to get more in the word of god because i tell you it's a sharper than any two-edged sword it's just it's cutting everything off of this world that i can have the things that i used to care about the things i used to watch i tell you what back in the world don't have it anymore don't have it don't have it tv none of that stuff grew up with it but i don't have it i'll tell you what he said blow it out with a shotgun don't have any of it because you start to realize that the world starts to become it just becomes a in the distance as you get in the word of god you start listening to these messages things of the world just start you're almost like blinded from it and then when you hear something or on your job and they'll say would you hear this i have what i don't know i said i can show you this scripture i read last night was scared let me tell you this quote i just heard i tell you brother christ is making her she's making herself ready she's clothing herself in matthew chapter 9 verse 18 while he take these things unto them behold there came a certain ruler and worshipped him saying my daughter is even now is dead but come and lay thy hand upon her and shall and she shall live jesus arose and followed him and said to the so did his disciples and behold a woman which was deceased with a blood issue 12 years came behind him and touched the hem of his garment for she said unto herself if i may but touch his garment i shall be whole but jesus turned him about a and when he saw her he said daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thy whole and the woman was made whole from that hour by faith it took faith to say if i could only touches him if i could only just touch the hem of his garment didn't even have to ask for prayer just said if i could touch the master i think today we got to touch the master i think the bride of christ needs to raise up and touch the master this morning if you've come with a need this morning god cares god truly knows what you have need of before you even ask him he just wants you to ask him he just wants you just like picking up the phone or calling your father or whatever it is call your mother they just want you to say hey this is what's going on don't talk about it just call the call call your father up and say god you know what's going on already but god i need your help it might take one year it might take six months it could happen right on the spot it can happen 10 years down the road abraham 25 years he kept searching for that promise that promised son and then he got it because he trusted god he trusted god and it comes down to trust in our father it comes down romans 8 30 now you'll turn to this but romans 8 38 through 39 it says for i'm persuaded this is truly i love this scripture because this is me for i'm persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present or things to come virus whatever you have listen no height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord nothing whatever it is bring it on because nothing will separate the love of christ nothing will once you get anchored in jesus christ nothing will separate us and if you're young and you're looking to get married or whatever it is i'll tell you make sure they have jesus in their life make sure you go through the courtship because you could one decision you have to live with that the rest of your life one decision you have to live with that person the rest of your life one decision could just put you on the wrong road one decision of us not serving god can put us there whatever decision life trying to make it with jesus no matter if it's your job or whatever to have need of even besides marriage is saying god i need you to show me in this situation i need you to i i don't know what to do but god you know what to do god is truly just like noah he was building the ark 120 years building this ark

god is coming on the nation i don't believe i don't see it getting any better i don't see i i i believe like i said the 200 000 000 demons are released from the earth and i tell you the bride is just about ready to get out of here jesus is about to step down off the throne and say it's over i'm going i don't know about you but i could see god's hand slowly coming off the earth he slowly just back

take us quickly from the scene right in the midst of the battle but the angels are encamped about those who fear him and we're so thankful for them yes he says brother brett says and i am so glad for a fresh experience of knowing the reality of his promise aren't you thankful this morning that we can know who who are who our redeemer is he says in god's provided way he said now you know according to the word of god what happened in heaven at this time angels are rejoicing he said the black flags of satan have been defeated he said they're down and chased out and the angels of the white victory flags are flying through heaven tonight and bells of glory are ringing just ringing melodies as one sinner coming to christ the lord be blessed in praise forever oh my god's provided way i tell you he said i think he said the satan's black black flags are defeated this morning and jesus has got his white flags flying them over saying hey i've already paid the price if you just get in the boat and trust me or you like you said the disciples went over there and they were trembled and said hey wake up you know you know go away jesus i believe we just need to wake up jesus said jesus have you spoke to him in a while you know sometimes we won't know where where god is he's waiting to know where you are he wants to know where we are in our life and say hey i've been i've been here the whole time i had left i had left you you left me you left jesus he didn't leave you he's been in the same spot the whole time waiting for his sons and daughters to say he's waiting on that last one to come in and i'll tell you church uh wherever we go i'm praying lord this could be the only service someone could repent and say god i'm sorry forgive me of my sin i want to rededicate my life but i'm saying there's many refillings in the holy ghost maybe you come this morning you want another refilling of the holy ghost i don't know what it is but god knows your heart this morning god knows what you have need another refilling this morning i believe he's here this morning i'll read this and close it as they place them softly he says who has the most power before god he said what is an angel and angel is a servant that's right they're his servants what are you he said his sons and daughter he said who has the most power in heaven then a sinner that's been saved by grace or an archangel that's standing by his right side listen church listen he said the sinner he said that's been saved by grace has more authority in heaven than the archangel that stood by his side without sin because he's a son he said son has more authority than a servant of course he said oh we forget what we are he said we forget many times what made us what we are he said after we become what we are then we forget who we who how we got here oh what precious love the father gave to adam's false race he gave his only son to suffer and redeem us by his grace the kings and redeemer 1962 oh with every head bowed this morning [Music] if there's a need this morning i don't know if you've kind of went drifted off from god or your faith needs to be picked up this morning i believe god's in this place he

should be thankful this morning amen maybe you're part of that bride that he's getting ready because somebody's fixing to leave this world and it would be scary to think that he's not working on you

that his people begin to lean more on him i mean leaning on him more amen less on this world on leaning more on him amen amen can you pull that song up if
