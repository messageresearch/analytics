[50:37] on perfectly eternal life amen perfectly
[50:41] eternal life this is my third service
[50:43] and I still haven't got to my message so
[50:46] Amen to quote amen where I got it so
[50:48] that's just how the Lord's anointed it
[50:51] amen amen so I really like when God does
[50:55] that don't you amen because it just
[50:57] makes a a world of difference amen when
[51:00] he comes when he anoints amen and just
[51:03] opens up so to speak the windows of
[51:05] Heaven amen pours out a blessing amen
[51:09] and so we're trying not to go too fast
[51:11] amen and I'm
[51:14] U amen going to try to uh go to a second
[51:19] part amen I know one Sunday we talked
[51:22] about eternal life amen uh where it come
[51:24] from how far back it goes of course we
[51:27] know a mean towards the end of brother
[51:29] brenham's Ministry he talked about
[51:31] unless you are a seed Gene I mean
[51:34] remembers him talking that way brother
[51:36] man got real specific unless you're part
[51:39] of the seed Gene of almighty God Amen
[51:41] you're not going to have eternal life it
[51:43] takes being a part of God Amen that
[51:46] right amen and that of course we know is
[51:49] his holy ghost that's the seed Gene how
[51:52] many believe that's the seed Gene of God
[51:54] Amen and uh not only that but also you
[51:57] haven't been in his mind is also a part
[52:00] of him because his thoughts are a part
[52:02] of him isin't that right amen and so but
[52:06] specifically trying to be direct is of
[52:08] course A C Gene of almighty God and that
[52:11] means that before the world was ever
[52:13] created you was already
[52:16] there you was already there we'd say
[52:20] we'd like to say he was there from the
[52:21] beginning but no there was no beginning
[52:25] right and amen because there was no
[52:27] beginning in him and so you always was
[52:31] there amen I don't know if that Thrills
[52:34] you but I think I really think that
[52:35] that's going to Thrill me when I've been
[52:37] there 10,000 years could we say a
[52:40] million it doesn't matter how long amen
[52:42] you know and I I I truly believe that
[52:45] amen sometimes what we lack is the
[52:48] thrill of this amen didn't brother bam
[52:52] say don't ever lose your enthusiasm Amen
[52:55] in other words the thrill that comes
[52:57] with it amen and and and what I mean by
[52:59] Thrill is that it it means something to
[53:02] you amen amen it really means something
[53:05] to you and so I'm so glad for that
[53:09] amen can I just say a little more you
[53:12] know you are the mystery you are the
[53:14] mystery of God revealed how many beli
[53:17] that amen Christ in you the hope of
[53:19] glory is the mystery of the whole thing
[53:23] revealed praise the Lord amen
[53:27] amen God is good isn't he all right we
[53:30] prayed Let's uh go if you will to St
[53:32] Matthew amen St
[53:36] Matthew amen we want to basically you
[53:39] know and I got to thinking of this
[53:41] because I thought about eternal life and
[53:43] speaking on eternal life and what it is
[53:46] amen and brother brandom of course
[53:47] talking about Jesus Christ never lived
[53:49] for himself that being perfectly eternal
[53:52] life and so forth and that's where I the
[53:54] core of my message begin to come
[53:57] amen um but as I think about it you know
[53:59] brother bam I think he preached about
[54:01] three messages on uh the Holy Ghost
[54:04] series how remembers that Holy Ghost
[54:06] series am man he also spoke and I never
[54:08] even really thought about that until I
[54:10] got into this but really that's what
[54:12] this kind of more or less is is a holy
[54:13] ghost series since it has to do with
[54:16] eternal life amen and I feel like the
[54:21] Lord is revealing to me are supposed to
[54:23] be dead amen dead and in order for
[54:27] Christ's Life to Live we have to be dead
[54:30] amen it dead to self okay Matthew the
[54:35] 7th
[54:37] chapter and we'll begin with kind of
[54:39] talking about a mixed tree or somebody
[54:42] that claims to be something that they're
[54:44] not it's actually amen somebody
[54:47] professing something that they're not
[54:49] Matthew
[54:51] 7 and we'll begin with verse 15 beware
[54:54] of false prophets which come unto you
[54:57] in sheep's clothing but inwardly they
[55:00] are ravening
[55:03] wolves and then Jesus says ye shall know
[55:06] them by their fruits amen do men gather
[55:12] Grapes of thorns or figs of thistles
[55:14] even so every good tree bringeth forth
[55:16] good fruit but every corrupt tree
[55:18] bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree
[55:21] cannot bring forth evil fruit neither
[55:23] can a corrupt tree bring forth good
[55:26] fruit every tree that bringeth not forth
[55:29] good fruit is heed down and cast Into
[55:31] the Fire wherefore by their fruits ye
[55:35] shall know them may God add His
[55:37] blessings to the reading of the words
[55:38] you can be seated this morning I want to
[55:41] add a verse into this scripture if I
[55:44] could a good tree cannot bring forth
[55:47] evil fruit and neither can a corrupt
[55:49] tree bring forth good fruit but a tree
[55:53] can look like it is a good fruit tree
[55:57] but not be a good fruit tree ain't that
[56:01] right that's why he warned you about
[56:03] false prophets they come you come to you
[56:05] they look like sheep but inside they're
[56:08] not amen how many believes that it's
[56:11] important what you are on the inside
[56:15] amen this is kind of Amen this is this
[56:17] type of preaching this message as I look
[56:19] at it amen is we're conditioning
[56:22] ourselves for the Rapture how many beli
[56:25] that's what we're doing
[56:26] we're conditioning ourselves for the
[56:28] Rapture because we're living so close
[56:31] now we better be getting ready because
[56:33] we realize that how many believes that
[56:35] if you're going to go in the Rapture
[56:37] you're going to be ready to go in the
[56:39] Rapture and if you're not going to go in
[56:41] the Rapture you're not going to be ready
[56:43] to go in the Rapture amen and God is
[56:46] going to have his people ready to go in
[56:49] the Rapture amen therefore I believe
[56:52] that uh the ministers the five-fold
[56:54] ministry amen amen is going to be
[56:57] bringing something that will be for the
[56:59] edifying of until we all come to the
[57:02] knowledge of Christ and to the stature
[57:04] of the fullness of the measure of him
[57:07] amen so praise the Lord now I just
[57:11] wanted to read that looking at a tree of
[57:13] course we realize that we come you and I
[57:15] as we mentioned uh amen Sunday I believe
[57:18] it is we either come from one of two
[57:22] trees one of two trees one of them was
[57:25] Adam and the other one was the serpent
[57:27] amen the only true daddies that there is
[57:29] in the world Amen praise the Lord and
[57:32] one was the son of God and the other of
[57:34] course amen now I want to go with the
[57:38] help of the Lord now let's look at this
[57:39] for just a minute Amen in First Peter no
[57:43] not first Peter but second
[57:45] Peter second

[59:09] great and precious
[59:11] promises that by these you might be
[59:13] partakers of the divine nature having
[59:16] escaped the corruption that is in the
[59:18] world through lust and besides this
[59:22] giving all diligence add to your faith
[59:25] virtue and tot knowledge and we're going
[59:27] to stop there amen like I said I don't
[59:29] want to go too fast on this amen but I
[59:32] want to dwell for a little while tonight
[59:35] with the help of the Lord having escaped
[59:36] I mentioned a little bit already but
[59:38] having escaped the corruption that is in
[59:41] the world through lust amen
[59:47] Ephesians back to Ephesians if you want
[59:50] it's just a very familiar scripture but
[59:54] I want to read it because
[59:56] it's one of our
[59:59] foundational scriptures amen Ephesians 2
[1:00:03] I believe it is two and verse 8 for by
[1:00:07] grace are ye saved through faith and
[1:00:10] that not of yourselves it is the gift of
[1:00:14] God now it says that we have have
[1:00:17] escaped the corruption that is in the
[1:00:20] world now how many knows uh let's first
[1:00:23] of all we know that brother bam taught
[1:00:24] us that the the flesh has what in the
[1:00:28] greatest battle ever fought we have 10
[1:00:31] senses five In the Flesh and five in the
[1:00:34] spirit isn't that right 10 now I want to
[1:00:37] call
[1:00:38] them 10 chains tonight maybe something
[1:00:42] Ain never heard before 10 chains we're
[1:00:45] Bound by 10 chains
[1:00:50] amen amen because if you'll remember
[1:00:52] what he taught in in the battle is that
[1:00:55] you what your the flesh is see taste
[1:00:58] feel hear and smell is that right amen
[1:01:01] he says and if these aren't controlled
[1:01:04] by the Holy
[1:01:05] Ghost isn't that right then they're
[1:01:08] controlled by the devil and they'll
[1:01:10] mislead you first of all those senses
[1:01:12] and all that outside of a regenerated
[1:01:15] person filled with the Holy Ghost that's
[1:01:17] the corruption that is in the world is
[1:01:20] that right because the works of the
[1:01:23] flesh according to Galatians Galatians 5
[1:01:27] we know the works of the flesh is
[1:01:28] adultery fornication uncleanness
[1:01:31] lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft
[1:01:33] hatred variance emulation wrath Strife
[1:01:36] sedition all of these now won't even go
[1:01:38] all of them but all these things are
[1:01:40] manifestations of the Flesh and they're
[1:01:43] chains chains that need to be
[1:01:46] [Music]
[1:01:49] broken amen now Peter said you and I
[1:01:53] have
[1:01:54] escaped the corruption that is in the
[1:01:57] world through us is that right we have
[1:02:00] escaped it we've gotten out of it amen
[1:02:04] it's like we were tied down in
[1:02:06] the the pawn shop ain't that right we
[1:02:09] had chained we were all chained
[1:02:14] up
[1:02:16] amen because believe me if you ain't
[1:02:19] governed by the Holy Ghost you're going
[1:02:20] to be governed by your
[1:02:23] feelings by the things that you see feel
[1:02:26] hear or smell or your conscience or your
[1:02:29] memory or your reason or your affection
[1:02:32] and your
[1:02:33] emotions is actually channels the
[1:02:36] prophet of God call it that you know you
[1:02:38] can't trust and is that right you can't
[1:02:40] trust any of
[1:02:42] those amen because if those aren't
[1:02:45] governed by the Holy Ghost they'll
[1:02:46] mislead
[1:02:47] you mislead you every time we were born
[1:02:50] that way born with those shackles and I
[1:02:52] want to say that God by his grace
[1:02:57] amen how many know it's Amazing Grace
[1:02:59] how sweet this sound amen that gave you
[1:03:02] the key he thought to speak said here
[1:03:05] Tommy catch that right he pitched you
[1:03:10] the key laying on that bed or wherever
[1:03:12] it is in that
[1:03:13] jail he pitch you the key said here is
[1:03:17] the key to unlocking every one of those
[1:03:23] chains amen because we're saved by grace
[1:03:26] through faith Paul said now we have
[1:03:30] access I just got to read it right
[1:03:32] because I can't remember all that good
[1:03:36] but Romans
[1:03:37] 5 Paul said it this way he says by whom
[1:03:42] also we have access by faith into this
[1:03:47] grace
[1:03:49] wo how many know it takes Sav by faith
[1:03:53] and we receive the grace of God through
[1:03:56] the faith of God that he has given
[1:04:00] you something that God gives
[1:04:03] you the world I want to say tonight the
[1:04:06] world has not
[1:04:09] escaped you and I took both that key
[1:04:12] amen oh I can sometimes I can oh when
[1:04:15] we're having a service and the Holy
[1:04:17] Ghost anointing comes down and people
[1:04:20] begin to break free from their feelings
[1:04:22] or amen their bad day that they had or
[1:04:24] their bad week at the head amen and all
[1:04:28] of a sudden people go to scream I can
[1:04:31] almost hear chains
[1:04:33] dropping the chains of Darkness the
[1:04:36] chains of starchiness the S chains of
[1:04:38] lukewarmness Amen it begin to fall off
[1:04:41] because that's what the Holy Ghost does
[1:04:43] the Holy Ghost anointing when it comes
[1:04:45] it breaks the
[1:04:47] chains when the revelation of the word
[1:04:49] comes and hits you anden it breaks the
[1:04:52] chains amen and sets you free
[1:04:58] all because of the key of faith I I
[1:05:01] believe faith is the key that opens the
[1:05:05] door my wife sings that sometimes faith
[1:05:08] is the key to every promise in the word
[1:05:12] without faith it's impossible it's the
[1:05:14] first step it's the first step over here

[1:05:39] God it's his it's a part of
[1:05:46] God my and by this faith that he has
[1:05:50] given us he says we have access by faith
[1:05:54] into this Grace wherein we stand and
[1:05:58] rejoice in Hope of the
[1:06:01] glory of
[1:06:04] God
[1:06:12] Amen I can't think of where I got it
[1:06:14] wrote down right
[1:06:21] now it's not Colossians
[1:06:24] 3
[1:06:26] I think it's somewhere in Ephesians I
[1:06:27] should oh right here it is right in
[1:06:30] front of me it's actually Galatians 2
[1:06:33] and 20 Paul says I am crucified with
[1:06:37] Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but
[1:06:41] Christ liveth in me and the life life
[1:06:45] that I now live in the flesh I live by
[1:06:49] the faith of the Son of
[1:06:51] God Amen how many believe that that
[1:06:54] that's the way to live

[1:06:59] was not just a faith that saves you and
[1:07:03] lift you up and gives you the baptism

[1:07:15] that he now lives every day to us we're

[1:08:20] Faith Of God that you and I
[1:08:23] have we take it for granted we take so
[1:08:27] many things for granted let's not take
[1:08:30] what God has given us for
[1:08:32] granted he has given us his faith the
[1:08:35] very faith that created the worlds by
[1:08:37] faith we understand that the worlds were
[1:08:39] framed together by the word of God God
[1:08:42] spoken and it was it's not hard for a
[1:08:45] Believer to have faith it's not hard for
[1:08:47] a Believer to see God because
[1:08:50] whenever God is on the inside it's not
[1:08:53] hard to have not hard to see not hard to
[1:08:57] have faith oh God will take care of this
[1:08:58] God will take care of that calling those
[1:09:01] things that are not as though they
[1:09:08] are that's how we live makes a different
[1:09:12] person out of

[1:09:16] us oh my when you got this faith and you
[1:09:19] come into Christ let me tell you
[1:09:21] something the Bible says that we are HID
[1:09:25] we get hid it's a hiding place Faith
[1:09:30] takes you to a hiding place how many
[1:09:33] believe
[1:09:34] that
[1:09:36] Colossians way
[1:09:40] back amen let's just read the scripture
[1:09:46] here Colossians
[1:09:49] 3 and verse three it says for ye are
[1:09:54] dead and your life is hid with Christ in
[1:09:58] God when Christ who is our life shall
[1:10:02] appear then shall ye also appear with
[1:10:05] him in
[1:10:08] glory I like
[1:10:12] that let me repeat this when Christ who
[1:10:18] is our
[1:10:22] life
[1:10:24] amen not only does Paul can we say that
[1:10:27] Paul lived by the faith of God but the
[1:10:29] very life of God is in
[1:10:32] you the very life of God is in me if it
[1:10:36] isn't the way it's supposed to be we're
[1:10:39] not dead
[1:10:42] yet we're not As Dead As what we should
[1:10:45] be I'm convinced that we need to dig a
[1:10:48] Little Deeper amen dig some more ditches
[1:10:51] make more room for the Holy
[1:10:54] Ghost
[1:10:57] There's No Limit there what can happen
[1:10:59] and the way that God can lead us if
[1:11:01] we'll just die to ourselves noce he said
[1:11:04] for you are
[1:11:06] dead and your life is hid in Christ you
[1:11:09] get into a hiding place Eve was so
[1:11:11] fortified behind the word the devil
[1:11:13] couldn't come get her at
[1:11:17] all even in James he says you know no
[1:11:20] temptation has taken you and so forth
[1:11:22] but every man is thrown away when it is
[1:11:25] bu amen and tempted when entic he's
[1:11:27] drawn our way of himself if God if the
[1:11:29] Devil comes in if the Devil comes in to
[1:11:33] where you
[1:11:34] are he'll be your
[1:11:39] brother if the Devil comes into where
[1:11:42] you are you'll shake his hand and say
[1:11:44] how you doing brother
[1:11:50] devil how many not my words how many
[1:11:53] know brother bam said if he would come
[1:11:56] into where you are he'd be your
[1:11:58] brother cuz he can't come in there he
[1:12:02] won't come in there cuz he has to come
[1:12:05] through
[1:12:06] repentance he's got to come through
[1:12:09] sanctification sanctification and
[1:12:11] baptism of Holy Ghost he's got to get
[1:12:14] into Christ where you are and that ain't
[1:12:17] never
[1:12:18] happening so brothers and sisters let me
[1:12:20] tell you our problem some
[1:12:23] sometimes and I believe that we get
[1:12:25] sealed amen by the Holy Spirit of
[1:12:27] Promise until the day of our Redemption
[1:12:29] but there's still times that you go out
[1:12:31] there's still time that I go out
[1:12:33] sometimes and it ain't the dev's fault
[1:12:35] he ain't got no power over you it's your
[1:12:40] [Music]
[1:12:42] fault you
[1:12:43] backslide you fall short don't blame the
[1:12:46] devil it wasn't his
[1:12:49] fault
[1:12:51] huh it was your
[1:12:53] fault you went to him that's the only
[1:12:57] way he could ever bother you or do
[1:12:59] anything with
[1:13:05] you amen that's the only way that Eve
[1:13:08] could ever ever ever go out was to open
[1:13:11] up the womb of her mind and look out
[1:13:14] amen reason ain't that right she's the
[1:13:18] one that went out not ad him oh my I
[1:13:21] like that
[1:13:24] fortified praise the Lord so we see
[1:13:26] brothers and sisters how that Faith
[1:13:27] breaks
[1:13:29] chains it breaks your fleshly
[1:13:35] desires
[1:13:36] amen it
[1:13:39] overcomes the corruption of the
[1:13:44] world that is through lust the lust of
[1:13:48] the flesh the lust of the eye the pride
[1:13:51] of life is that right he
[1:13:54] said
[1:13:57] that's what the Bible says the world is
[1:13:59] love not the world neither the things
[1:14:01] that are in the world if any man love
[1:14:03] the world the love of the father is not
[1:14:06] in
[1:14:09] him now what is the world verse 16 for
[1:14:13] all that is in the world the lust of the
[1:14:16] flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride
[1:14:18] of life is not of the father but is of
[1:14:21] the world so if you love the things that
[1:14:24] the flesh has the Desir that it has amen
[1:14:26] it ain't the love of God that you got in
[1:14:29] [Music]

[1:14:47] flesh the love it if God ain't even in
[1:14:50] you if you love this world or the things
[1:14:53] in this world you love it more than you
[1:14:55] love
[1:14:56] God come on you're
[1:15:00] lying huh you better love God more than

[1:15:30] to get as one one of the aspects one of
[1:15:32] the one of
[1:15:34] the natures of God is forgiveness isn't
[1:15:37] that right one of those Natures that
[1:15:39] comes with him is
[1:15:41] forgiveness he was such a forgiving God

[1:15:48] all

[1:23:42] the armies they just hope they're going
[1:23:43] to be there they just hope they're saved
[1:23:47] is that right John they live on a hope
[1:23:50] so amen we hope we hope and that has a
[1:23:53] lot of bearing how many knows that has a
[1:23:54] lot a bearing there's a lot of truth to
[1:23:56] it but also says that if we only have
[1:23:58] hope in Christ Jesus in this life we're
[1:24:01] of all men most miserable
[1:24:03] amen and now notice now back to my story
[1:24:08] hereby know we that we dwell in him amen
[1:24:13] and he in us I like that because they
[1:24:17] just hope hope I says well how you can
[1:24:18] know that you got you're saved you can
[1:24:20] know that Christ is in you because he
[1:24:23] has given us a of his spirit
[1:24:26] amen how many believes that the
[1:24:29] scriptures I want to get to though is
[1:24:31] over in five and verse four chapter 5
[1:24:34] verse4 whatsoever is born of God
[1:24:38] overcometh the world and this is the
[1:24:42] victory that overcomes the world even
[1:24:46] our faith ye of God little children and
[1:24:50] have overcome them because greater is he
[1:24:53] that is in you than he that is in the
[1:24:57] world how many believes when God reveals
[1:25:00] himself to you he said to Peter who do
[1:25:02] you say I am he said Thou Art the Christ
[1:25:04] the son of the Living God anden Jesus
[1:25:06] said Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock
[1:25:09] I'll build my church and the Gates of
[1:25:11] Hell will never Prevail against
[1:25:15] it so faith is a revelation of God that
[1:25:19] anchors you how many's glad to be
[1:25:23] anchored you know we have 10 senses see
[1:25:25] taste feel ha smell and so forth the 10
[1:25:28] senses of the body but brother B said
[1:25:31] there's a Christian has a six
[1:25:34] sense what is that six
[1:25:36] sense Faith amen if God doesn't gr you
[1:25:40] that faith you'll be just as bad off as
[1:25:42] the world I don't care how much claim to
[1:25:45] be a Christian how much Church you join
[1:25:47] and mean how much you say you believe
[1:25:49] the message and so forth if God doesn't
[1:25:52] come down and grant you that Faith he to
[1:25:54] change your nature you're still going to
[1:25:56] be held amen by those 10 senses and
[1:25:59] change amen aren't you glad for that six
[1:26:04] sense that brings all these senses into
[1:26:08] submission otherwise they're just
[1:26:11] wild they're
[1:26:14] crazy all you got to do is look at the
[1:26:16] far left right now and you'll see how
[1:26:18] crazy
[1:26:20] feelings and emotions
[1:26:22] get you know how many of those Democrats
[1:26:25] well and
[1:26:27] Republicans how many of them folks say
[1:26:29] well we need to change this law and that
[1:26:31] law because you know it hurts somebody's
[1:26:35] feeling I don't care about your
[1:26:38] feelings amen if we change the laws for
[1:26:41] all of our feelings my goodness what
[1:26:43] kind of a world will we have and mean I
[1:26:46] know one thing they need to change their
[1:26:47] ways because they're Gras having me to
[1:26:50] having hurt my eyes looking at them you
[1:26:52] know it hurts my feelings get some cloes
[1:26:56] on how many's with me tonight quit
[1:26:59] tattooing yourself all over the place
[1:27:01] those nose rings are a problem to
[1:27:05] me it disturbs
[1:27:09] me
[1:27:11] huh that's right but all about feelings
[1:27:14] and emotions aren't you glad you're not
[1:27:16] governed by feelings and emotions you
[1:27:19] are governed by
[1:27:22] faith faith in the word of God gives you
[1:27:26] access to the
[1:27:29] very nature of God we're going to go
[1:27:32] into it Sunday again but how many
[1:27:34] beliefs like brother Bram says you know
[1:27:35] if you have a watermelon seed it'll
[1:27:37] bring forth
[1:27:38] watermelon amen if I if you have the
[1:27:41] spirit of John Dillinger you'd be a have
[1:27:43] a guns and be Outlaw and everything else
[1:27:45] you beein you'd write music you do
[1:27:49] whatever but if the Holy Ghost is in you
[1:27:51] the works that I do shall you do also
[1:27:54] how many believe that amen that's right
[1:27:59] praise the Lord the very
[1:28:01] Faith Like I said this real genui Faith
[1:28:05] brings something it'll bring it to I
[1:28:07] need it as a young person I needed
[1:28:10] something that caused me to be more
[1:28:12] solid not so
[1:28:15] immature
[1:28:18] huh that's right as young folks
[1:28:22] sometimes it takes more than 20 years to
[1:28:23] get little little of our immaturity out
[1:28:25] of us 25 30 40 boy I've seen some well I
[1:28:31] may be a little bit immature yet myself
[1:28:33] so what can I
[1:28:35] say sometimes it takes a lifetime to get
[1:28:38] some of the immatured into childishness
[1:28:40] and so forth out of us hello takes a
[1:28:43] lifetime sometimes but here for one
[1:28:44] thing for sure amen it gives you
[1:28:46] something solid how many glad that the
[1:28:48] faith of God gives you something solid
[1:28:51] it anchors you
[1:28:55] listen young people I don't care what
[1:28:56] age you are you need an anchor in your
[1:29:00] life that's why they floated and drifted
[1:29:03] as far as they have amen and doing all
[1:29:06] the things that they do because they
[1:29:07] have no anchor I mean know Faith anchors
[1:29:12] only in one thing not in man's tradition
[1:29:14] not in man's idea not in what Thomas
[1:29:16] berer
[1:29:18] thinks
[1:29:19] huh but what that word of God says faith
[1:29:23] anchors in the
[1:29:26] word
[1:29:27] amen what God Said is true let every
[1:29:31] man's word be a lie when God ever
[1:29:35] reveals something to you there ain't
[1:29:37] enough gates in hell to ever Prevail
[1:29:40] against it knowing his day when he got
[1:29:42] God spoke to him he got the Revelation
[1:29:44] going to reain and it didn't matter how
[1:29:46] many Skeptics there were he knew that it
[1:29:48] was going to rain and he built the
[1:29:51] ark how many knows that God is said he's
[1:29:54] going to come and he's going to burn
[1:29:55] this whole world with unquenchable fire
[1:29:59] but he's going to take his wheat into
[1:30:00] the Garner and we see that in front of
[1:30:03] us it's a long range Vision amen and
[1:30:06] that which we are seeing amen and
[1:30:08] believing we don't see it like Abraham
[1:30:10] he he didn't see it but he believed the
[1:30:12] promise Abraham looked for a city whose
[1:30:15] Builder and maker is
[1:30:17] God and when you and I are looking for
[1:30:19] that same
[1:30:20] city Faith causes you to see things that
[1:30:23] are not not yet not here
[1:30:27] yet but it
[1:30:29] brings things into substance faith is
[1:30:34] the substance of things hope for the
[1:30:36] evidence of things not yet seen that's
[1:30:39] what faith
[1:30:41] is well I need healing it's not there
[1:30:44] yet but I see myself
[1:30:46] whole
[1:30:49] huh I can't overcome this I can't
[1:30:51] conquer this but faith says I will overc
[1:30:54] overcome
[1:30:56] it amen I'm maybe I I'm I'm going to
[1:31:00] presume that there's a few Christians in
[1:31:04] uh few Christians here amen that battle
[1:31:07] with things and battle with things amen
[1:31:08] and you have to say I'm going to

[1:31:32] overcome is by through faith and your
[1:31:35] faith is listen your faith is the
[1:31:37] victory that
[1:31:38] overcomes this world of

[1:31:46] overcomes
[1:31:48] it

[1:33:51] you for a lifetime
[1:33:55] it anchors you when you're drawing your
[1:33:57] last
[1:34:00] breath and when you get carried over to
[1:34:04] the other
[1:34:05] side folks I'm telling you we don't
[1:34:08] realize how real that other side is that
[1:34:09] other side is real
[1:34:11] folks heaven is real hell is real the
[1:34:14] regions of the Lost is real don't wait
[1:34:18] till you come down to the door of death
[1:34:21] to decide hey I need to make a few
[1:34:22] things right
[1:34:24] huh I need to make sure that I don't
[1:34:27] love the world more than I love God are
[1:34:30] the things of this world more than I
[1:34:32] love
[1:34:36] God those who live by faith the most had
[1:34:39] the least attachments to this
[1:34:42] world how many knows
[1:34:45] that Jesus just had nothing in this
[1:34:48] world ain't that right he had nowhere to
[1:34:51] lay his head and the next man to him the
[1:34:55] closest I'm going to say the closest
[1:34:57] because he wrote the whole new testament
[1:34:59] and brother Braham said that we use the
[1:35:01] Apostle Paul as an example of a man
[1:35:03] that's preaching the right and the truth
[1:35:05] and that's on the
[1:35:06] word you better pre preach what Paul
[1:35:09] preached if you're an angel from heaven
[1:35:10] you'll be cursed he was he wrote most of
[1:35:14] his new testament in prison in bonds and
[1:35:18] in
[1:35:19] Chains he didn't have it nice he didn't
[1:35:21] have a Jesus didn't have a family
[1:35:24] Paul didn't have a family neither one of
[1:35:26] them was
[1:35:31] married
[1:35:33] amen we'll getting into part of that
[1:35:35] Sunday amen how the wife cares for the
[1:35:40] things of her husband and the husband
[1:35:41] cares for the things of his wife if
[1:35:43] they're married and so
[1:35:46] forth but what was
[1:35:48] it they were so governed and operated by
[1:35:52] faith of all almighty God Amen that
[1:35:56] their grip on this world was very
[1:36:00] loose
[1:36:04] amen
[1:36:06] amen you got your phone with that little
[1:36:09] statement that you sent to the church

[1:36:17] like

[1:36:21] victory over the world because of the
[1:36:23] faith
[1:36:24] amen first it was
[1:36:25] Grace amen but you had to have faith to
[1:36:28] receive that Grace Paul said we have
[1:36:30] access into disgrace by the faith that
[1:36:33] God gave
[1:36:35] you boy if that don't want to make you
[1:36:37] get down on your knees when you think
[1:36:40] about the millions that God is
[1:36:46] bypassing the the thousands of people
[1:36:49] that are dying right now and going into
[1:36:51] the regions of the chains and lost
[1:36:54] lost forever

[1:36:59] into the Pearly Gates

[1:37:05] way and God had mercy on
[1:37:07] you God had mer mercy on you and you and
[1:37:11] you God had mercy on you to put that
[1:37:15] Faith to believe his
