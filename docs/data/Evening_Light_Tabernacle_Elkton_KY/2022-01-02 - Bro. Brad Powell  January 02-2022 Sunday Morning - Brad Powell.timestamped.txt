[0:05] and your father's tempted me proved me
[0:07] and saw my work
[0:18] this one together unto whom i swear in
[0:20] my wrath they should not enter into my
[0:23] rest god bless you
[0:25] you may be seated
[0:37] morning brothers and sisters
[0:39] i'm assuming you don't want to be one of
[0:41] those people that we just read about in
[0:43] the psalms that you want to be the
[0:45] opposite of what we just read about
[0:47] would you
[0:48] turn with me to psalms 121
[0:51] 1.
[0:59] and uh
[1:01] i do a lot of crazy things sometimes i
[1:03] forget to put things in my bible in the
[1:05] morning
[1:08] i said i was going to try to do a
[1:10] financial report
[1:11] next instead of getting one of those red
[1:13] books that i use i've been using
[1:15] it's almost 20 years now i didn't use a
[1:17] red book
[1:18] i just used a regular notepad and did 52
[1:22] weeks worth of entries so
[1:24] it's gonna take me i'm hoping to be done
[1:27] by sunday but i just made myself work
[1:30] harder than i needed to but i'll try to
[1:32] get a financial report by next sunday it
[1:34] might be
[1:35] the following one
[1:38] and then i'll let you know what's left
[1:39] in
[1:40] what's left in the church loan and where
[1:43] we're at financially in the general fund
[1:45] and everything but
[1:47] going to the uh psalm
[1:49] 121
[1:51] i was reading this this morning
[1:53] it's out of a devotional from world war
[1:55] one more of them as we i've said before
[1:58] that if you read the psalms it's
[2:00] repetitive
[2:01] and
[2:02] god told the children of israel to read
[2:05] these
[2:06] words before their children and
[2:09] before the people
[2:11] that that they would put it in their
[2:12] heart
[2:16] my help come
[2:18] from the lord which made heaven and
[2:19] earth
[2:21] he will not suffer thy foot to be moved
[2:24] he keepeth thee the slumber nor sleep he
[2:26] doesn't sleep lord is thy keeper the
[2:28] lord is
[2:30] thy shade upon my right hand the sun
[2:32] shall not move just red
[2:35] and he goes on to say the lord shall
[2:37] preserve thee from all evil
[2:39] and he shall preserve thy soul
[2:42] and the lord shall preserve thy going
[2:43] out so my coming in
[2:46] for this time forth even forever more
[2:56] and it goes back to this psalm and the
[2:58] other psalm if your promises in christ
[3:00] your results are
[3:03] he
[3:04] is sure he shall preserve forever
[3:08] and as a chaplain in the last four
[3:10] remember leaving my wife and three small
[3:13] children at the railroad station
[3:15] you know that's now you don't
[3:17] leave by a train anymore you leave by an
[3:19] aircraft
[3:20] wondering whether i will ever see them
[3:23] again and i sat in the train and i began
[3:26] reading a letter from a friend
[3:28] at the close of what
[3:30] she said may the lord preserve thy
[3:32] goings out my coming in
[3:34] i lifted up my heart to god and said
[3:37] lord do this for me for the sake of
[3:39] those whom i love
[3:41] that i took out my bible and i read this
[3:43] great thing and he read the 121st psalm
[3:46] the lord shall preserve thy goings out
[3:49] my coming in and this last paragraph is
[3:51] what i was thinking about i still
[3:53] remember the joy of it and the wondrous
[3:56] sense of security it brought that of
[3:58] course didn't mean that i was coming
[4:00] back
[4:01] and then you know that you go 120 years
[4:04] forward you know most people would look
[4:06] at the promise of god any promise we
[4:09] have it's in god's hand what happens
[4:11] whatever however that applies
[4:14] promises applied and he says
[4:17] of course it didn't mean i was coming
[4:19] back
[4:20] back but it
[4:22] did
[4:23] mean that god was going to watch over me
[4:25] and care
[4:26] care for me and hold all the if all that
[4:29] affected me to his control
[4:32] it means the same thing for you today if
[4:34] you belong to him every life committed
[4:37] to
[4:39] where you're at in your life where
[4:40] you're at in your experience
[4:42] everything's in god's hands and you just
[4:44] i say this a lot i don't but you just
[4:46] gotta let go to uh
[4:49] i don't know if i mark a spot in the
[4:51] bible
[4:52] this morning but if you return
[4:57] you know it's pretty good shot for
[4:58] romans 8.
[5:00] you know
[5:02] i'm not going to read the whole chapter
[5:05] but i'll
[5:07] just read i'm going to read these verses
[5:09] here if i can find my place i thought i
[5:11] marked it
[5:12] this morning
[5:14] you know you you couldn't read
[5:16] you couldn't read romans 8 enough
[5:21] and i'm all over the place this morning
[5:29] but like i've said before everything we
[5:31] do like this man was saying
[5:33] everything you do
[5:35] is in god's hands and i'll start
[5:38] from about the 25th verse going to about
[5:40] the 32nd verse and for if we hope for
[5:43] what we see not then do we with patience
[5:47] wait for it and that hope is christ i
[5:50] mean and likewise the spirit also helped
[5:52] with our infirmities for we know not
[5:54] what we should pray
[5:55] for as we ought but the spirit itself
[5:57] make intercessions for us with groans
[6:00] which cannot be uttered
[6:02] and he that searches the heart knowing
[6:04] what is the mind of the spirit because
[6:07] he'd make it intercession for the saints
[6:09] according to the will of god
[6:11] and he goes on to say paul goes on to
[6:13] say and we are
[6:14] called according to his purpose i know
[6:16] there's plaques all over the world that
[6:18] have that one scripture written for
[6:21] people but it goes on for whom he did
[6:22] for them who also he did predestinated
[6:25] to be conformed to the image of the son
[6:28] that he might be the firstborn of many
[6:29] brethren
[6:31] moreover when he did predestinated him
[6:33] he also called them
[6:35] whom he called him he also justified
[6:37] whom he justified
[6:39] he also glorified and then he goes on to
[6:41] say here and this is a true statement
[6:43] for what shall we say then to these
[6:45] things
[6:46] if god be forced who can be against us
[6:49] i mean i don't have a lot to say this
[6:51] morning but the one thing i would say is
[6:53] we start a new year
[6:55] it i guess everything depends as a as a
[6:58] person
[7:00] as a christian
[7:02] what you're hoping what your trust is in
[7:04] this morning
[7:05] everyone has their own place their own
[7:07] experience where they're at this morning
[7:09] but as this this man was a presbyterian
[7:12] so when you read this you know he comes
[7:13] from a presbyterian's perspective which
[7:15] is still
[7:16] the word of god and it's sovereignty and
[7:19] god's predestination we all have a
[7:21] purpose god you know no one gets out of
[7:23] this life without god fulfilling his
[7:24] purpose for you and we want to be what
[7:27] god wants us to be we don't want to find
[7:29] ourselves fighting them to the day we
[7:31] die we just want to be able to surrender
[7:33] to the will of god for our hearts and
[7:35] for our lives and the age that we live
[7:37] in and as we go into another year
[7:40] that's every man and every woman's
[7:42] purpose is you got to find out where god
[7:44] wants you
[7:45] to be and what steps he wants you to
[7:48] walk in in the year that's ahead you
[7:50] know i i can't know it for you no man or
[7:52] woman can know it for you it's something
[7:54] that you've got to pray about you've got
[7:56] to read god's word and apply it to your
[7:58] life and god will show you what he wants
[8:00] you to do in the coming months ahead and
[8:02] year brother received
[8:27] amen
[8:29] appreciate that brother brian
[8:31] yeah
[8:33] okay
[8:35] just go on and take our prayer request
[8:41] first thing

[8:45] requests for her sister

[9:31] i know he could use your prayers
[9:34] just pray for the doctors directions and
[9:37] what to do to help him and
[9:40] and uh
[9:42] but he seems like he tries to hold a
[9:44] good spirit
[9:46] that's why that's
[9:48] when when he's
[9:51] when he's not sleeping i guess when they
[9:52] don't have him so drugged up but
[9:55] i just seen a little
[9:57] part there where he was singing

[30:45] have you set
[30:46] uh brother branham he was speaking in
[30:49] 1960 on new year's eve i guess it was
[30:52] and

[30:56] bless us
[30:58] how many want that

[31:03] hopes and bringing new thoughts and new
[31:04] revelations new power and oh everything

[31:10] lord of thy blessings and promises we
[31:13] commit ourselves with our prayer into
[31:15] thy hands in the name of the lord jesus
[31:18] i thought man how fitting is that in the
[31:19] time
[31:20] that we're living in so
[31:23] pray for us we
[31:24] i asked as you pray for us for our some
[31:26] of our personal uh
[31:29] desires that we have or seeking
[31:30] direction for from god and some projects
[31:32] that i've got on my mind that lord laid
[31:34] on my heart and just want to make sure
[31:36] i'm in his will and doing doing doing
[31:38] what he would have me to be and
[31:40] if it is it'll fall in place and if not
[31:42] it'll go by the wayside
[31:45] we won't look back so
[31:47] definitely a time of for everybody
[31:49] personal growth and
[31:50] ambitions we think about that this time
[31:53] of year right a couple weeks or a week
[31:55] or so ago you start thinking about what
[31:56] am i going to do in the new year what's
[31:57] what's it going to lead what am i going
[31:58] to do so
[32:00] we just
[32:02] pray that and and hope that your desires
[32:04] are to be closer to god
[32:06] turn with me this morning if you would
[32:07] as we begin to speak to first chronicles
[32:10] 4.
[32:14] that's
[32:15] right after
[32:17] kings i think there so it's up in the in
[32:19] your old testament there
[32:24] i'll tell you with a computer i was
[32:25] telling somebody my kids they they fly
[32:27] through the bible because with computers
[32:28] you know you can just punch in what
[32:30] you're looking for and bang it's there
[32:31] so
[32:32] you know you i still read out of my
[32:34] bible but my familiarity going from one
[32:36] to the other is not not like it should
[32:38] be so
[32:40] first chronicles four
[32:43] and before we start i just want to say
[32:45] you know brother steve i heard you
[32:46] talking about uh trevor and he's just
[32:48] been just been a great
[32:50] burden on my heart here lately and
[32:53] and uh you know we see the story and
[32:56] and uh you know you talk about him
[32:58] having a good spirit and he does but you
[33:01] know i can't even imagine the the
[33:03] struggle
[33:04] from day to day that he has to go
[33:07] go through so
[33:08] uh and
[33:11] we're praying for him we all are but i
[33:13] just you know i just as a parent
[33:15] you just came you know i can't imagine i
[33:18] just can't imagine
[33:19] uh thinking about it as a parent but i
[33:21] think back to when i was 17 or 18. i've
[33:24] got a 17 year old
[33:26] uh you know how hard that would be so
[33:29] try to put yourself in in their channels
[33:32] chapter 4 verse
[33:34] 9 and 10.
[33:36] now if you're looking at this chapter
[33:37] here and you're beginning to read this
[33:39] chapter and you're reading them through
[33:41] your bible if you look at the very
[33:42] beginning it's one of those begat
[33:44] moments
[33:45] and you just begat this one and this one
[33:47] begat that one and this one's the son of
[33:49] this and and this one's this person's
[33:51] son and over and over and if you're like
[33:52] most people when you're reading the
[33:53] bible and you get to those baguettes you
[33:55] just breeze right through them right
[33:57] if we're honest we breeze right through
[33:59] them but if we're not careful if we
[34:01] don't slow down look at verse 9 we miss
[34:03] a very powerful verse
[34:05] and jabez was more honorable than his
[34:08] brethren
[34:09] and his mother called his name jabez
[34:11] because
[34:13] she's saying because i bear him with
[34:16] sorrow
[34:17] and jabez
[34:19] is called on the god of israel saying oh
[34:21] that thou would has blessed me indeed
[34:23] and enlarge my coast
[34:27] and that thy hand might be with me and
[34:30] that thou would has keep me from evil
[34:32] and that it may not greed my goodness
[34:34] what a verse we have right there and if
[34:36] you go on and look what what does it
[34:38] jump right back into begat begat son of
[34:40] begat be had son of but here's jabez has
[34:43] a special place right here in these two
[34:46] little verses
[34:47] in the bible
[34:49] god may have blessed us to the reading
[34:51] of the word you can have your seats this
[34:52] morning
[34:54] so i want to speak this morning
[34:56] on god's blessings
[34:58] on our lives god's blessings
[35:01] on our lives i mean
[35:03] we definitely want god's blessings
[35:06] on our lives
[35:08] i like how brother brown kind of
[35:09] approaches
[35:13] in the new year's message in 1964 and
[35:16] the message shalom
[35:17] it kind of brings us right down to the
[35:19] beginning of where we're at today and
[35:21] when we listen to this quote
[35:23] it doesn't have a lot to do with jabez
[35:25] you know brother branham i've never seen
[35:26] where he even spoke on jabez and it kind
[35:28] of was astounding to me that he never
[35:30] spoke on this little prayer in the bible
[35:33] but hearing this one message in shalom
[35:36] in 1964 he said we're facing this year
[35:39] with both darkness and light
[35:43] he says the world is in one of the most
[35:44] chaotic times of darkness that has ever
[35:46] stood in and yet it's standing in the
[35:49] most blessed light that it ever did
[35:51] shine in
[35:53] the difference is
[35:54] it's just like it was in the beginning
[35:56] when there was gross darkness upon the
[35:58] earth
[35:58] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[36:00] face of the water and said let there be
[36:03] light
[36:04] so what was god doing there he said god
[36:06] was separating the light from the
[36:08] darkness and he said i believe that now
[36:10] we're living in that hour again when god
[36:12] is separating the light from the
[36:15] darkness and he said he's pressing it
[36:17] into the other side of the world that
[36:20] the light might be manifested so how
[36:22] many of us this morning can can say that
[36:24] you know what he's talking about here
[36:27] because we just come out of this year of
[36:29] panic and
[36:31] fear and anxiety suicidal rates we're on
[36:34] the rise and we see people all around us
[36:37] turn into a socialistic style of
[36:39] government
[36:42] and turning away from god almighty
[36:45] you want to talk about darkness we're
[36:46] living in a world full of gross darkness
[36:48] but yet there is a group of people there
[36:51] is a person there is a people a church
[36:53] that god has called to say your darkness
[36:56] before you leave this place everybody
[36:58] will know that i'm still
[37:00] a god
[37:01] that i still heal that i still give that
[37:04] i still provide why because i'm going to
[37:06] do it through you through you through
[37:08] the vessel sitting here today
[37:11] listen but to the church i say shalom
[37:16] to the church i say shalom because it's
[37:18] god's peace
[37:20] he said that's what i want to bring to
[37:21] you this morning for the new years not
[37:23] looking back but we're looking forward
[37:25] to the break of a new day
[37:30] i don't know about you but i don't
[37:31] really want to look back to 2021.
[37:35] this is your new new
[37:37] year
[37:38] here's my
[37:39] message
[37:40] i don't want to look back to 2021. he
[37:42] says you're looking for a new day i'm
[37:44] looking for a new device where the years
[37:47] has been the joy that we've looked
[37:48] forward to the pressing the coming of
[37:50] the great light and now we see it
[37:52] breaking over the horizon
[37:58] i can't help but to believe we're a
[37:59] little bit beyond that horizon that he
[38:01] was looking at
[38:04] this was in the 60s we're a little bit
[38:06] beyond that horizon so where is that
[38:08] light he said it's breaking between
[38:10] mortal and immortality
[38:14] god's life in us
[38:17] god's life moving in us god's life
[38:18] blessing us he says we see it it's
[38:21] breaking between heavens and earth from
[38:23] earthbound sickness and troubled world
[38:25] into a bright shining day of immortal
[38:28] life and an immortal body and an
[38:31] immortal earth that shall never pass
[38:33] away and i say shalom
[38:37] that gives us a lot to look forward to
[38:39] that gives us a lot to believe in
[38:45] it's no secret
[38:47] this morning that we're living in the
[38:49] darkest
[38:50] of the hours on the face of the earth
[38:54] but when i look at that and if you begin
[38:56] to dwell on that it really gets to you
[38:57] but when you look at isaiah 60 and 1 it
[38:59] says arise and shine for light has come
[39:01] to you
[39:03] who is it talking about it's talking
[39:05] about you who has like come it's come to
[39:07] you and you and you and we've got to be
[39:09] able to accept that light brothers and
[39:11] sisters we all rise and shine this
[39:13] morning
[39:14] brothers and sisters we ought to be
[39:15] there be there because that light has
[39:17] come and the word is vindicated in our
[39:20] lives
[39:21] there was a vindicated word that came
[39:25] but what are
[39:26] you
[39:28] oh you why are you so quiet
[39:31] a vindicated word that came for you and
[39:33] that word is god we've established that
[39:37] that word is god and where is god
[39:40] here
[39:41] so you're the vindicated word for the
[39:44] hour
[39:45] that's deep
[39:47] that's deep
[39:51] so we can see god manifest you say
[39:53] brother brad
[39:54] i'm nobody
[39:57] and we can make all the excuses we want
[40:00] i'm too young
[40:01] i'm too old
[40:03] uh
[40:05] i i i'm just a lay member
[40:07] i'm just a housewife i'm this i'm that
[40:10] i'm uneducated i'm i'm all these things
[40:13] you can you can label whatever you want
[40:17] but god's not requiring that
[40:20] god's not requiring or requiring much of
[40:23] you he said
[40:24] when you look at brothers and sisters
[40:25] there's no age limit
[40:29] there's no age limit to get on this ride
[40:35] you know how disappointed it is for your
[40:36] kids when you go to the
[40:38] to the
[40:39] amusement park
[40:41] and they they walk up there and they're
[40:43] they're 10 9 10 11 years old and it says
[40:45] you got to be 12 to right get on this
[40:46] ride
[40:48] what a letdown it is for him but let me
[40:50] tell you god does not require any age
[40:52] requirements it doesn't matter if you're
[40:53] old or young it doesn't matter god wants
[40:56] us to do something for it there's no
[40:57] degree required you don't have to know
[41:00] anything at all let me tell you just
[41:02] live what you know
[41:05] live what you know live what you know to
[41:07] the fullest and see if it's the truth
[41:09] and keep moving forward and let god move
[41:10] in your life
[41:12] amen
[41:15] you know there was a great light
[41:17] i'm going to get to my message here in a
[41:18] minute but i couldn't help putting this
[41:20] off
[41:21] there was a great light that hung out
[41:22] into the wilderness
[41:24] and that great light hung right there in
[41:26] the wilderness and here comes stuttering
[41:28] and stammering moses
[41:31] and the light fell down into the burning
[41:32] bush and he told moses what to do and
[41:34] you know what he did he recognized that
[41:36] light forsook egypt
[41:39] left out of egypt esteeming the reproach
[41:41] of christ greater than the treasures of
[41:43] egypt
[41:46] there was another time
[41:48] saul was walking on the road to damascus
[41:52] and there was that great light hanging
[41:53] out there
[41:56] and he began to be drawn to that light
[41:58] looking at that same pillar fire that
[42:00] moses looked at and that pillar of fire
[42:03] sitting there hanging in saul being a
[42:04] hebrew he never would have worshipped
[42:07] that fell down and worshiped anything
[42:08] like that
[42:09] or called on it
[42:11] but as he began to look at it he was
[42:13] right there in a position where he
[42:14] looked at it and the light was so bright
[42:15] that it struck him to his knees
[42:18] and what did he say lord
[42:21] who are you
[42:25] lord who are you he says i am come from
[42:29] god and i go to god
[42:31] and that same one has come to manifest
[42:33] to be known to the people on that on the
[42:36] on that day the promises that he had
[42:37] made that day is the manifestation of
[42:39] that day
[42:41] and brothers and sisters i tell you this
[42:43] and sometimes we we have a hard time
[42:45] believing it
[42:47] but i said it's time to rise and shine
[42:51] and if we were to be able you know
[42:52] science has broken into a realm
[42:55] that my childhood didn't see
[42:57] many of your childhood didn't see but
[42:58] it's called virtual reality
[43:02] and science has broken into that realm
[43:05] a westin got one of those oculus virtual
[43:08] realities
[43:09] and if you've seen it it's quite if you
[43:12] see one here it's quite amazing
[43:14] i didn't know anything about it his his
[43:16] grandparents got it for him
[43:19] and he was over there and he was a
[43:21] boxing and
[43:23] carrying on i thought
[43:25] he's dad you got to come look at this
[43:28] he said look at this right and i seen
[43:29] him over there he was doing this
[43:32] so what is this crazy kid doing
[43:35] so i'll go and i'll put it on whoa
[43:38] whoa and i i'm standing on a board above
[43:41] a cliff
[43:45] and i mean anthony was like it was real
[43:48] it's all virtual reality for a reason
[43:52] people are running into walls with these
[43:54] things on their head
[43:56] they're fighting invisible people
[43:57] they're falling they're they're falling
[43:59] down steps because they're in a world
[44:01] that only they can see with those
[44:02] goggles on
[44:04] let me tell you believers if we could
[44:05] just put on the spiritual goggles of
[44:07] virtual reality we would see this
[44:10] morning angels around the banisters of
[44:12] this church we would see the pillar of
[44:14] fire lighting on your shoulder and this
[44:16] shoulder but we fail to see it because
[44:17] we don't look through god's eyes
[44:22] we need the virtual reality of god
[44:27] we'll get to our text here this morning
[44:36] how many this morning would say god
[44:38] i'll do we all we all
[44:40] look at that that way we want we want
[44:42] our life to be blessed we certainly
[44:44] don't want
[44:45] the opposite of that
[44:47] you know you got a good and the bad and
[44:49] you got a
[44:50] uh an evil and a good and
[44:52] and light and dark blessed and cursed
[44:56] so we don't want our lives to be cursed
[44:58] so every one of us sitting here would
[45:00] say i want my life to be blessed
[45:04] and i didn't bring a message i'm not
[45:05] bringing a message this morning of
[45:07] resolutions
[45:11] you know resolutions uh they they come
[45:13] easy
[45:16] resolutions are not absolute
[45:19] we can call them resolutions all we want
[45:21] but they're not absolute
[45:24] you say well
[45:25] i'm pretty good at mine
[45:27] let me ask you about that diet in about
[45:29] three months
[45:31] three weeks
[45:34] maybe three days
[45:38] three hours
[45:39] there you go
[45:41] resolutions are easy calm and easy go
[45:43] they vanish quickly
[45:45] but the message i bring to you this
[45:46] morning is a message of blessings
[45:49] because blessings from god they happen
[45:51] day after day after day after day after
[45:54] day after
[45:55] hey are you with me after day after day
[45:58] after day without failing
[46:00] that's the blessings of god that's what
[46:02] i'm looking for in this hour i'm looking
[46:03] for the blessings of god that are given
[46:05] these blessings that are productive i'm
[46:07] looking for the blessings that i'm
[46:09] talking about will change your life
[46:13] i desire these blessings
[46:17] and i look at this and i think god
[46:18] you're sovereign
[46:20] god you're holy you're wise you're
[46:22] faithful
[46:23] you're gracious
[46:26] that's the god
[46:27] that we have to ask for our blessings
[46:31] god almighty jabez realized this that
[46:33] was his prayer the message he took it to
[46:36] god and it ought to be the message to
[46:38] every believer
[46:41] brothers and sisters
[46:44] the lord
[46:46] god almighty
[46:48] is still in the blessing business
[46:54] can you interact with me this morning
[46:56] repeat after me the lord god almighty
[46:59] is still in the blessing business
[47:04] now you've confessed it
[47:07] now you've confessed it now i want you
[47:08] to go and believe it
[47:11] because upon your confession is what
[47:12] you'll live upon
[47:14] so now that you've confessed that you've
[47:15] spoken you believe in your heart that
[47:17] the lord god almighty is still in the
[47:19] blessing business
[47:22] take a hold of it take a hold of it and
[47:24] grasp a hold of it with all that you've
[47:26] got within you
[47:30] jabez
[47:32] the call the called prayer of jabez
[47:36] chronicles 1 4 9 and 10.
[47:39] but many times we put the emphasis on
[47:41] the wrong person
[47:43] many times the emphasis is is put up on
[47:46] uh
[47:47] jabez and people lift up jabez and they
[47:49] they hold him up with such high esteem
[47:51] for for making this prayer but jabez was
[47:54] just an ordinary man just an ordinary
[47:56] guy just like you and me
[47:58] nothing special about jabez that you
[48:00] ever hear in the bible nothing special
[48:02] did you ever see him do in fact all 66
[48:05] books of the bible at page after page
[48:07] after page after page of scripture and
[48:09] he's a lot of two little verses hidden
[48:11] and begat the gap began began
[48:15] you talk about insignificant one
[48:20] but here's jabez
[48:22] what was different about him
[48:24] why did he get called out of all those
[48:26] begets
[48:28] to have his name mentioned
[48:30] because he saw the light
[48:33] he saw what god could do in his life and
[48:36] he wasn't afraid to address god and to
[48:38] take out and to call out to god in a
[48:40] time of trouble
[48:41] in 2000
[48:43] bruce wilkinson he turned to this little
[48:46] man james
[48:48] he turned him into an international
[48:50] phenom
[48:52] you remember the book the prayer of
[48:54] jabez
[48:55] 2000 you could get t-shirts you could
[48:57] get coffee mugs you get mouse pads you
[48:59] can get
[49:01] everything you could imagine with the
[49:02] prayer of jabez there was a book for the
[49:04] prayer of jabez a prayer a book for the
[49:06] prayer of jabez for women a book for the
[49:07] prayer of jabez for children
[49:11] on and on and on he put this guy up on
[49:14] the map can any of you say that you
[49:16] really had heard jabez before 2000
[49:19] think about
[49:20] think back
[49:23] no
[49:24] but this little prayer without a doubt
[49:26] this little miniscule bible personality
[49:28] is now a bonafide star
[49:31] and bruce wilkinson has done so much to
[49:33] affirm that the blessings of god to his
[49:35] righteous people who are practicing and
[49:38] believing
[49:40] on
[49:41] god
[49:46] we got to remember that the blessings of
[49:48] god though
[49:50] are the blessings of god
[49:54] that means that the prayer jabez is
[49:56] can't be used as some magical
[49:59] event to take place
[50:02] there's more to it than just a few lines
[50:04] in the bible
[50:06] when you begin to look at the prayer
[50:09] of
[50:10] jabez
[50:11] the prayer of jabez must not and cannot
[50:13] be used as magic and it it can't be used
[50:16] as i want you to god to grant me
[50:19] anything i ask anything i desire
[50:22] anything i pursue
[50:25] because it's easy from a natural state
[50:28] we get right there and we get we we get
[50:30] down there and we get ourselves in
[50:32] trouble because we want to take all this
[50:34] stuff to god and next thing you know
[50:35] we're let down
[50:37] we're in discouragement
[50:39] why is that
[50:41] let me ask you what did you really take
[50:42] to him
[50:45] a lot of times i'll find out that we
[50:47] take our wants
[50:49] our greeds
[50:52] our pledge
[50:56] well we got a few honest hearts
[50:59] god give me god give me god i want god
[51:02] bless
[51:03] thank you lord
[51:05] but that's not what we're talking about
[51:08] we're not talking about that kind of
[51:09] relationship
[51:11] god is god
[51:13] and we're not
[51:17] so what we have to do is we have to pray
[51:20] and we have to trust and we have to obey
[51:22] and we have to wait and we have to thank
[51:24] god no matter what
[51:27] happens
[51:33] how many times have you prayed and you
[51:34] prayed you prayed and you you never got
[51:37] an answer
[51:38] to that prayer
[51:42] yeah
[51:43] we've all been there
[51:47] you know why you didn't get an
[51:48] answer because god is god
[51:53] and that hurts us sometimes
[51:56] but god
[51:57] is not a dirty grandfather
[52:02] sometimes my kids very rarely but
[52:05] sometimes they come
[52:07] to me dad can i get
[52:11] and every now and then i have to say no
[52:14] this is
[52:15] desire
[52:17] i know deep down inside
[52:20] that's not what
[52:22] they need
[52:26] that's not
[52:28] going to help them
[52:29] that's not going to lead them to a good
[52:31] relationship
[52:37] you can't know the blessings of
[52:39] the jabez
[52:44] if god is not your father
[52:47] who bled and died on the cross
[52:51] think about that
[52:54] for us today we have to know a god of
[52:56] salvation
[52:59] for us today for the prayer of jabez to
[53:01] work we have to realize that god is our
[53:03] savior that god is our
[53:06] healer that god
[53:07] god is our redeemer
[53:13] he lived in the old testament we're
[53:15] living under the new testament
[53:17] jesus is our savior
[53:19] how many can say that
[53:23] and we sometimes we take that sin given
[53:24] on the face of the earth
[53:31] many times we want blessings but we're
[53:33] not living a life to be blessed brother
[53:36] butler i'm glad somebody's helping
[53:39] y'all you're doing good you're doing
[53:40] fine i i really
[53:42] really hope it blesses us by the end of
[53:44] the days but
[53:46] many times i said we want a blessing but
[53:48] we're not living the life to be blessed
[53:51] you see god blesses a life that is
[53:54] marked
[53:55] with purity
[53:58] purity
[54:01] you notice the first thing in first
[54:02] chronicles 4 9 tells about jabez what's
[54:05] it say jabez was more honorable breaks
[54:07] my christianity
[54:11] what breaks my heart oh and they give
[54:12] their heart to the lord they say they
[54:14] repent
[54:15] they say they're christians
[54:18] but there's never a change
[54:20] that takes place
[54:24] they quit no habits
[54:26] they still go where they always went
[54:28] they still watch what they always
[54:29] watched
[54:30] they still hear what that they always
[54:32] hear
[54:33] they still talk the way they always talk
[54:35] that's one of my first indicators
[54:37] so my cuddles man tell me they're a
[54:38] christian they're cussing like a sailor
[54:41] no that ain't gonna work
[54:43] that's not gonna work in god's plan
[54:47] but they say and that's why it's so sad
[54:49] because it's somewhere inside they think
[54:52] they are
[54:54] saved
[54:58] and it's tough
[54:59] you think about that that's a hard place
[55:01] to be in
[55:03] they don't realize it and they're still
[55:07] blinded to what true repentance is
[55:10] because true repentance says i'm sorry
[55:13] lord forgive me now i'm going to change
[55:15] and turn away
[55:17] from the things i used to do
[55:22] now i'm not asking you to be saints and
[55:24] angels this morning
[55:26] because we all got room to grow
[55:29] but if your daily walk is not getting a
[55:31] little closer or you're dedicating a
[55:33] little more time
[55:36] you need to question yourself
[55:39] i'm not here to question you but i'm
[55:40] here to challenge you this morning
[55:42] [Applause]
[55:43] but let me tell you i'm going to tell
[55:45] you this little story
[55:47] about myself
[55:51] my wife will tell you i'm the world's
[55:53] biggest procrastinator
[55:57] some of you are too huh
[56:00] you've heard your wife say that
[56:05] but i would be for for a long time
[56:07] before services i would meditate just in
[56:09] my mind on the word and things would
[56:11] come to me and i would know what i was
[56:12] going to do and i would know what i was
[56:14] going to preach and i would have
[56:15] inspiration and thoughts
[56:17] but i never would really sit down and
[56:19] really get deep into those things and
[56:21] try to figure out what direction god are
[56:23] you really trying to take me
[56:27] that's a pretty big confession right
[56:28] here
[56:30] so i would wait till about 12 midnight
[56:33] before sunday morning
[56:38] and then study from 12
[56:43] sleep from two to four get back up at
[56:46] four
[56:47] finish
[56:48] from four to six six
[56:52] print my stuff off and then cram reading
[56:54] through it and making underlines and
[56:56] notes and
[56:57] and trying to say that's not doing god's
[56:59] service
[57:01] was all those messages in vain i don't
[57:03] think so
[57:04] but could i have given more of myself
[57:06] could i have dedic if he's willing to if
[57:08] he's if i'm willing to let him use it
[57:09] why don't i
[57:11] let him use me
[57:14] so i made a commitment
[57:17] it's not been easy
[57:19] i set my alarm at five o'clock
[57:22] and from five to seven now i study and i
[57:25] read
[57:27] and i pray i don't say this to lift
[57:29] myself up because i'm going to tell you
[57:30] what it's without him it's not going to
[57:32] happen
[57:35] but you know what i found
[57:39] is i've got a better relationship with
[57:40] god
[57:42] you say well i don't have time oh you
[57:44] can make time
[57:47] you can make time
[57:49] i didn't get up to six maybe maybe you
[57:51] don't have to get up maybe you got to
[57:52] get up at 5 o'clock well you can get up
[57:53] at four
[57:56] but what are we doing with our time
[57:58] that's allotted to us to use
[58:00] for god
[58:03] it's it's changed my my outlook it's
[58:06] changed my daily walk because for the
[58:07] first two hours of the day i've spent
[58:09] with him
[58:11] we sing the song i come to the garden
[58:15] and i feel like now i could go say i've
[58:17] been to the garden
[58:19] and so now in the morning when i get up
[58:21] i feel like i got a better outlook on
[58:23] the day ahead
[58:24] whether it's a good day or a bad day or
[58:26] whether i lose it or whether i don't
[58:28] it's still a good day because i've spent
[58:30] time in fellowship with god
[58:36] and he desires that
[58:38] and he blesses that
[58:41] and now when i go to bed i feel like i
[58:42] got to give at least 30 minutes to say
[58:44] hey let me tell you how the day went god
[58:49] so if you want it it's there
[58:51] he's willing he'll show up
[58:53] i promise you he will show up if you get
[58:56] up at four he'll show up
[58:59] he'll sleep in
[59:03] but what do we do
[59:05] with our life
[59:07] how do we get this pure life and
[59:10] and how do we how we get this blessings
[59:14] through purity
[59:19] i read this story
[59:20] and it's kind of crude but uh you know
[59:23] her brother brother around say quite a
[59:24] few crude things
[59:27] uh from the pulpit but he got his point
[59:29] across
[59:31] so i read this little story and it was
[59:32] talking about a a man who was attending
[59:35] this lavish dinner party
[59:39] and and he's there and this party is to
[59:41] be held in his honor and he's there and
[59:42] there's they're all dressed up and
[59:44] and he's very nice dressed well to do
[59:47] people there
[59:48] and sitting beside him is this elegant
[59:50] sophisticated stylish young woman
[59:54] and she's beautiful
[59:57] and she's elegant
[1:00:00] and i'm gonna have to do more research
[1:00:02] to see who it was but i believe he's a
[1:00:03] christian author that done this but i
[1:00:05] want to find out for sure before i call
[1:00:06] his name because i haven't read the book
[1:00:08] i just read the story
[1:00:11] and at one point during the meal he
[1:00:13] leaned over and whispered in the ear
[1:00:16] of this young lady
[1:00:19] would you sleep with me tonight for 25
[1:00:21] 000
[1:00:24] did you hear what i said
[1:00:26] a few adults called it i'm not saying it
[1:00:27] again
[1:00:31] and the woman smiled and said yeah
[1:00:38] so he leaned over to her again this is a
[1:00:40] true story and whispered to her again he
[1:00:43] said how about fifty dollars
[1:00:46] she jumped up and she was horrified she
[1:00:48] lost her composure she yelled what do
[1:00:50] you think i am
[1:00:53] and he said we've already established
[1:00:54] what you are
[1:00:56] i'm just talking about the price
[1:01:00] let that sink in
[1:01:05] some of us around
[1:01:07] the church world
[1:01:08] around the message
[1:01:10] we need to let that sink in because
[1:01:12] sometimes we put a price
[1:01:15] on things that we think are blessed
[1:01:18] we put a price on the life we're living
[1:01:21] but some of us need to be careful that
[1:01:22] we don't let the price
[1:01:25] deprive us of what the true blessing is
[1:01:28] and we need to not let the devil to to
[1:01:30] get us to compromise
[1:01:32] on our commitment to god
[1:01:35] because people sometimes put the wrong
[1:01:37] emphasis on what a blessing truly is
[1:01:43] some of us need to put a sign around us
[1:01:45] that says not for sale
[1:01:50] because we easily when good things come
[1:01:52] along and it's easily accessible and
[1:01:54] ready to grab
[1:01:55] we jump ahold of it
[1:01:58] thinking that that might be god's
[1:02:00] blessings
[1:02:01] what did it cost you
[1:02:05] now you see the moral of the story
[1:02:07] what did it cost you
[1:02:09] what was it going to cost her
[1:02:16] psalms 139 says search me o god
[1:02:21] search me o god and know my heart try me
[1:02:24] and know my thoughts
[1:02:26] and see if there's any grievous ways in
[1:02:28] me
[1:02:29] lead me to the way that's everlasting
[1:02:32] so god blesses a life
[1:02:35] that's pure
[1:02:36] now when you look at jabez
[1:02:39] and you look at the life he was living
[1:02:41] honorable doesn't mean perfect
[1:02:43] let's don't confuse the two
[1:02:47] so his life was not that of a perfect
[1:02:49] life
[1:02:52] no
[1:02:55] jabez like all saints of god he lived
[1:02:58] both a sinful and a righteous life at
[1:03:00] the same time
[1:03:04] because it's in there
[1:03:07] until we cross over if you feed that
[1:03:09] black dog enough you gonna act like a
[1:03:11] black dog
[1:03:16] so here he was
[1:03:18] both sinful and righteous at the same
[1:03:20] time but yet he's blessed
[1:03:22] you mean god can look down at a person
[1:03:24] like that a person who can
[1:03:27] live both sinful and righteous and still
[1:03:29] bless him you mean god can look at you
[1:03:31] when you're at your best when you're at
[1:03:33] your height as a christian and when
[1:03:34] you're at your lowest as a center and
[1:03:36] say i can bless that person
[1:03:39] that's what happened to jabez
[1:03:41] so being perfect is not a requirement
[1:03:43] for being blessed
[1:03:47] none of us in this world would ever be
[1:03:48] blessed
[1:03:50] there ain't a person standing here that
[1:03:51] would be blessed because none of us can
[1:03:52] live perfect only one that lived on the
[1:03:55] face of the earth was ever perfect that
[1:03:56] was jesus christ
[1:03:59] but the good news is that god's not
[1:04:01] looking for perfection he's in your life
[1:04:03] he's looking for the direction of your
[1:04:04] life
[1:04:06] are you with me
[1:04:07] god wants to know what are you on a
[1:04:09] day-to-day basis what are you doing
[1:04:11] how are you living which direction are
[1:04:13] you going because god will bless you if
[1:04:14] you're going in the right direction
[1:04:16] progressing in christ that's what i was
[1:04:18] talking about people who deceive
[1:04:19] themselves thinking they're living a
[1:04:21] christian life and never giving up
[1:04:22] anything and not doing anything to get
[1:04:24] closer to god
[1:04:27] here's what he's looking for direction
[1:04:30] progressing in the ways of christ
[1:04:32] what does matthew say he says seek ye
[1:04:34] first the kingdom of god and all his
[1:04:36] righteousness and all these things will
[1:04:38] be added to you that is the principle of
[1:04:40] less ability
[1:04:43] brothers we need to be blessable
[1:04:48] ask yourself this morning am i living a
[1:04:49] life before god that's blessable
[1:04:53] can god look down at me and actually say
[1:04:55] i'm going to give my blessings to him
[1:05:00] you know it's a big thing when a
[1:05:02] young man goes up to the
[1:05:05] father of his
[1:05:06] girlfriend
[1:05:08] and is asking for the blessings
[1:05:11] upon this marriage
[1:05:14] why is that such a big deal
[1:05:16] you know a lot of times a lot in the
[1:05:18] world now they don't even they don't pay
[1:05:19] no attention
[1:05:21] the truth of it is it is a big deal
[1:05:24] before that father
[1:05:26] because what he's coming and asking i'm
[1:05:28] asking you for your blessings upon me
[1:05:31] having your daughter as my wife and
[1:05:33] starting a family and what he's actually
[1:05:35] saying is do you think i'm worthy
[1:05:40] to have your daughter
[1:05:42] you can want a lot
[1:05:44] but are you worthy
[1:05:46] he's asking
[1:05:48] am i
[1:05:49] worthy to have her can i have your
[1:05:51] blessings
[1:05:53] we need to be blessable
[1:05:59] in order to be blessed but we have to be
[1:06:00] trusted
[1:06:03] god has to be able to come with a
[1:06:05] million dollars
[1:06:09] because
[1:06:11] i trust him
[1:06:14] i'm gonna bless him with with uh with a
[1:06:16] with a nice home and a farm because
[1:06:19] i trust him
[1:06:20] you think god could just be handing out
[1:06:23] money left and right to people he can't
[1:06:25] trust
[1:06:26] that that are claiming it
[1:06:28] happens in the world we see it all the
[1:06:30] time
[1:06:32] bad people get good things and good
[1:06:33] people at the time but when you're
[1:06:35] standing on faith and you're standing in
[1:06:37] the shoes of a christian as a shoes in
[1:06:39] the
[1:06:40] shoes of a christian
[1:06:42] could god trust you today with a million
[1:06:45] dollars
[1:06:49] oh in your mind we're all thinking yeah
[1:06:52] but boy i remember that new boat that
[1:06:54] new
[1:06:57] and if you don't have those things in
[1:06:58] your mind that's great
[1:07:01] but there's a lot of people god just
[1:07:03] can't trust
[1:07:05] with money
[1:07:08] it will destroy them
[1:07:10] it'll take them down to a place they've
[1:07:12] never been before in their life
[1:07:15] it'll make a man who
[1:07:17] who had a good family walk away from a
[1:07:19] good family
[1:07:21] it'll make a woman who had a good
[1:07:23] husband go out and chase other men
[1:07:27] money
[1:07:30] god's gonna be able to trust you
[1:07:34] listen to this
[1:07:37] this is the kind of person god can trust
[1:07:40] it was said that d.l moody we all know
[1:07:42] d.l moody
[1:07:43] he said his life and ministry
[1:07:47] drastically changed when he overheard
[1:07:49] someone say
[1:07:51] the world has yet to see what god can do
[1:07:54] through the man who is totally
[1:07:55] submissive to him
[1:07:58] let me read that to you again
[1:08:00] the world has yet to see what god can do
[1:08:02] through a man who is totally submissive
[1:08:04] to him
[1:08:06] and you know when d.l moody heard that
[1:08:07] do you know what he said to those people
[1:08:08] when he heard that conversation
[1:08:11] he said by god's grace
[1:08:13] i will be that man
[1:08:18] by god's grace i'll be that man i'll be
[1:08:21] that man i'll be that woman i'll be that
[1:08:23] child that god that will fully submit
[1:08:26] themselves to god and say god i'm all
[1:08:28] yours i'm all in and you can have what
[1:08:31] you want of mine you can do with me what
[1:08:33] you want i'm here that's d.l moody
[1:08:36] we've seen it in the life of the prophet
[1:08:40] how he walked away from so many things
[1:08:43] that he could have had
[1:08:46] he could have had more money at that day
[1:08:48] than we know what to do with
[1:08:51] it was offered to him checks handed to
[1:08:53] him
[1:08:55] but he said no
[1:08:58] no
[1:09:00] so i challenge you this morning to make
[1:09:01] that same commitment commandment and see
[1:09:03] what god does in your life when you say
[1:09:06] god i'm fully submitted
[1:09:09] then you're ready to receive some
[1:09:10] blessings
[1:09:12] fully submitted to god in his word and
[1:09:14] get rid of any of the impurities of your
[1:09:15] life i don't have to list them you know
[1:09:17] what they are
[1:09:18] you know the life you live i don't have
[1:09:20] to get in your living room
[1:09:24] i always found it amazing
[1:09:26] oh it's not amazing amusing
[1:09:28] preachers want to get up and blast this
[1:09:30] this and this
[1:09:32] and forgot to talk about what they they
[1:09:34] they had
[1:09:37] i don't need to tell you what's right
[1:09:38] and wrong
[1:09:40] you've got a still small voice
[1:09:43] that lives deep down in your heart and
[1:09:44] when you know something's going on it's
[1:09:46] not quite right you cringe
[1:09:48] the spirit and god inside oh
[1:09:51] cringes at the side or the sound or the
[1:09:53] vision of it
[1:09:56] but submit yourselves to god
[1:10:01] you know one of the most amazing and
[1:10:02] fascinating things about
[1:10:04] jabez
[1:10:09] is the meaning of his name
[1:10:13] his mother called his name jabez same
[1:10:15] because i bore him in
[1:10:18] pain
[1:10:20] how would you like that name
[1:10:23] i bore him in pain
[1:10:27] they were scripture reading bible toten
[1:10:29] people and they knew that in genesis
[1:10:31] chapter 3 that the pain in childbirth is
[1:10:34] part of a curse on the fall of humanity
[1:10:36] into sin so this wasn't a new concept of
[1:10:39] the birth pains
[1:10:42] but something had to happen there must
[1:10:44] have been something unusually painful
[1:10:46] about the circumstances surrounding the
[1:10:48] birth of jabez so much that while most
[1:10:51] mothers forget the pain within a few
[1:10:52] days right
[1:10:54] because you've got this little bundle of
[1:10:55] joy
[1:10:57] the pain didn't matter anymore
[1:10:59] you've forgotten the pain but here she
[1:11:01] is eight days later at the circumcision
[1:11:06] because that's when they named their
[1:11:07] child back then eight days after at the
[1:11:09] circumcision they would call out a name
[1:11:12] and here she is eight days later after
[1:11:14] she's been holding this little bundle of
[1:11:16] joy and man he's so good he's uh jabez
[1:11:20] can you imagine everybody in that church
[1:11:22] must turn around said what did she say
[1:11:27] pain
[1:11:29] you're going to name your child pain
[1:11:31] you're going to name your child grief
[1:11:34] you're going to name your child sorrow
[1:11:37] wow
[1:11:38] what a statement about his birth
[1:11:41] not
[1:11:42] just his birth but a prediction of his
[1:11:44] life his future
[1:11:46] a prediction of his destiny pain your
[1:11:48] life is full of pain because i bore you
[1:11:50] in pain
[1:11:54] that would be a tough life to live
[1:12:02] this name doomed jabez
[1:12:06] it doomed him
[1:12:10] but now looking through our natural eyes
[1:12:12] we would think
[1:12:14] naturally speaking you hear a name like
[1:12:16] that and you hear what it means and what
[1:12:18] happened to you would think and do
[1:12:20] all the days of his life he's going to
[1:12:21] be failure after failure there's no way
[1:12:25] that he'll ever prosper
[1:12:28] but brothers and sisters the good thing
[1:12:29] is that god doesn't look through those
[1:12:31] same eyes that we look through
[1:12:34] god doesn't look through the same eyes
[1:12:36] that we looked through because even
[1:12:37] though his name was jabez meaning grief
[1:12:39] and misery and pain god looked at him
[1:12:41] differently god had a different
[1:12:44] name for him and that name was blessed
[1:12:50] i want god's blessings
[1:12:52] on my life
[1:12:54] i want god to to take away the pain in
[1:12:57] my life
[1:12:58] how many of you have ever been through
[1:13:00] pain you've been through pain and
[1:13:02] anguish and suffering i want god to take
[1:13:04] that away
[1:13:05] but let's be honest
[1:13:07] pain is not a gift anybody wants
[1:13:11] pain is not something we're looking for
[1:13:13] pain is not something we ask for
[1:13:16] we don't want anybody to inflict pain on
[1:13:18] us
[1:13:19] how many of you have ever stood there
[1:13:20] and said here hit me with that baseball
[1:13:22] bat as hard as you can right in the nose
[1:13:26] you a fool if you if you did
[1:13:31] we don't ask for pain pain is like that
[1:13:33] box of rattlesnakes
[1:13:35] when they're delivered to your door you
[1:13:36] open it up and the first thing you do
[1:13:38] you close that thing back down because
[1:13:39] who wants a box of rattlesnakes and you
[1:13:41] put a stamp back on it and you put
[1:13:42] return to sender
[1:13:44] that's what pain is
[1:13:47] and naturally
[1:13:49] we would think a blessed life
[1:13:51] is a life that's painless
[1:13:54] and carefree
[1:13:55] we think a blessed life is happy we
[1:13:58] define blessings as
[1:14:00] in physical and material and financial
[1:14:02] terms so we we look at blessings as
[1:14:04] pleasure
[1:14:06] and not pain
[1:14:08] what do you hear when somebody's had a
[1:14:10] good week at work oh i was blessed this
[1:14:11] week
[1:14:15] maybe they got a bonus god bless me this
[1:14:17] week
[1:14:20] what does that do to the people that
[1:14:21] didn't get a bonus
[1:14:23] does it tell them god doesn't bless them
[1:14:31] the story of jabez
[1:14:33] it teaches us that the lord does not
[1:14:36] have to
[1:14:37] prevent limit or erase your pain in
[1:14:39] order to bless you
[1:14:41] but he can bless you in and through your
[1:14:43] pain
[1:14:45] because
[1:14:46] it's been said that it's doubtful
[1:14:49] whether god can use a man until he has
[1:14:51] first hurt him significantly
[1:14:55] [Music]
[1:14:56] you didn't wasn't expecting this was you
[1:15:00] you wasn't expecting this when i'm
[1:15:01] talking about blessings
[1:15:03] you mean that god is going to put us
[1:15:04] under a test and under the pressure to
[1:15:06] cause pain in our lives
[1:15:10] god uses the pain to develop us and what
[1:15:12] he wants us to be
[1:15:13] in psalms it says it's good for me that
[1:15:15] i was afflicted
[1:15:18] that i might learn your statutes
[1:15:21] mark it down
[1:15:24] there's purpose in your pain
[1:15:26] there's purpose
[1:15:28] in your pain
[1:15:30] you know sometimes as ministers and
[1:15:31] brother biter will vouch for this and
[1:15:32] just as christians in general sometimes
[1:15:34] we cry out
[1:15:36] for people
[1:15:38] god removed the pain from their life
[1:15:43] because we hate to see anyone suffer
[1:15:46] we hate to see anyone in pain
[1:15:49] but let me say it again there's a
[1:15:50] purpose in the pain
[1:15:54] that's not always easy to swallow
[1:15:57] you say well i don't consider pain a
[1:15:59] blessing you're right pain itself is not
[1:16:00] a blessing
[1:16:02] but there is a purpose behind the the
[1:16:04] pain and that's the blessing that comes
[1:16:06] behind it the pain qualifies us for a
[1:16:08] blessing
[1:16:11] you know there's candle makers
[1:16:14] and they warm that wax
[1:16:17] to just a point to where it's flowable
[1:16:22] and they put it into a mold
[1:16:25] and put a wick in it
[1:16:27] but you'll never know the power
[1:16:29] and what a blessing that candle is
[1:16:32] until it's burnt
[1:16:35] there's a difference between melting and
[1:16:37] burning
[1:16:39] sometimes we have to go through pain in
[1:16:41] our life grapes
[1:16:45] they're good as they are
[1:16:47] but we will never understand
[1:16:49] in bible times how they cherish the
[1:16:52] grape as going into the wine
[1:16:55] you can't make fine wine without grapes
[1:16:58] and you can't make fine wine without
[1:17:00] crushing
[1:17:01] those grapes
[1:17:03] those grapes have to be squeezed they
[1:17:05] would put them in a wine press and
[1:17:06] people would get her
[1:17:08] walk on top of those grapes and squish
[1:17:10] them and squish them and squish them if
[1:17:12] grapes could talk would they want to be
[1:17:13] one
[1:17:18] wheat must be ground in order to produce
[1:17:21] flour
[1:17:22] so all these experiences we bring you
[1:17:24] back to science
[1:17:27] many of you know here i'm i've never
[1:17:29] really spoke about this much in public
[1:17:31] but i'm going to speak about it today
[1:17:33] because it changed my life
[1:17:36] you know here that we
[1:17:38] some years several back years back we
[1:17:40] had some church issues it's no secret
[1:17:44] we had church issues
[1:17:47] i hope we all learned from it
[1:17:52] brother byler was hurt
[1:17:54] i was hurt
[1:17:55] some of you were hurt no doubt it's the
[1:17:58] biggest trial this church ever went
[1:18:00] through
[1:18:03] people left people quit
[1:18:06] there was anger
[1:18:09] and there was hatred well you're quiet
[1:18:11] because it's the truth
[1:18:14] and it was brewing and it was so bad
[1:18:20] it was painful
[1:18:23] it was so painful it was but it was
[1:18:25] during that time period
[1:18:27] that time period and several years it
[1:18:29] followed
[1:18:31] the sum of my what i feel like some of
[1:18:32] my greatest quality godly qualities and
[1:18:35] attributes were formed in me
[1:18:40] and i hope you can look back on that
[1:18:42] scenario that instance and say the same
[1:18:45] thing
[1:18:48] but it was there that i learned how to
[1:18:49] forgive
[1:18:52] i've been a christian for years
[1:18:54] i thought i knew what forgiveness was
[1:18:58] but i didn't
[1:19:01] not till i felt so hurt
[1:19:03] so let down so beat down and i say me
[1:19:06] brother balor was in the same shoes
[1:19:10] he's being honest
[1:19:12] it wasn't until i felt that pain and all
[1:19:14] that that i had to look at people and
[1:19:15] say i have to forgive them or i will
[1:19:17] never be able to move forward in my life
[1:19:22] and so there i had to be able to forgive
[1:19:24] i learned how to put someone and they
[1:19:25] put myself in someone else's shoes
[1:19:29] i learned how to feel for people in pain
[1:19:32] i learned how to have compassion
[1:19:37] i learned how to be patient and
[1:19:38] long-suffering
[1:19:42] you know being a young minister at that
[1:19:43] time i didn't have a lot of patience
[1:19:46] and you see that a lot in young
[1:19:47] ministers
[1:19:49] yeah
[1:19:51] they gonna tell you where the rubber
[1:19:52] meets the road and it's that way or no
[1:19:54] way and
[1:19:58] so i didn't have a lot of patience
[1:20:00] i didn't have a lot of long suffering
[1:20:03] but i learned how to give people time to
[1:20:05] develop
[1:20:09] yeah
[1:20:10] i learned these things in one of my
[1:20:12] hardest trials
[1:20:14] you say that was your hardest trial it
[1:20:15] was probably my family's hardest trial
[1:20:18] if you asked brother byler what was his
[1:20:20] family's hardest trial that was his
[1:20:22] family's hardest trial
[1:20:28] after after leaving here we went further
[1:20:30] on down the road trying to do a work for
[1:20:33] god
[1:20:35] pain in the end
[1:20:40] pain so much that i would watch my wife
[1:20:42] cry days after days after days what is
[1:20:46] going on
[1:20:50] and had a young child western was just a
[1:20:51] just a young toddler then big enough to
[1:20:53] talk
[1:20:55] going to school at the time i think
[1:20:59] wouldn't go to school
[1:21:00] anxiety fear panic what's wrong with you
[1:21:03] son i'm afraid somebody is gonna kill
[1:21:05] you
[1:21:09] that hurts
[1:21:11] that's painful
[1:21:14] but through all of that today i can say
[1:21:16] that was one of the greatest blessings
[1:21:19] of my life
[1:21:21] and i hope the same people that went
[1:21:23] through that experience have looked at
[1:21:25] it and been able to say the same thing
[1:21:26] that they're now able to forgive
[1:21:30] that now they will be able to understand
[1:21:32] and look through the eyes of someone
[1:21:34] with long suffering and patience
[1:21:36] and not give up on everybody just
[1:21:38] because they're not where you're at
[1:21:47] there's a song we all familiar
[1:21:54] with says god will
[1:21:57] make this trial
[1:21:59] a blessing
[1:22:02] though it sends me to my next
[1:22:10] though my tears flow like a river yet in
[1:22:12] him there's sweet relief god will make
[1:22:14] this trial a blessing the whole wide
[1:22:16] world
[1:22:17] we'll see
[1:22:20] you know brother terry tidwell wrote
[1:22:21] that song it was
[1:22:22] by the mckameys i think the next year
[1:22:24] went viral if that's the word we would
[1:22:27] use for today
[1:22:30] and i i never sat down and asked brother
[1:22:32] terry maybe some of you has heard his
[1:22:33] testimony about the song but no doubt
[1:22:35] you can't write a song like that unless
[1:22:37] you've been in that pain
[1:22:40] you can't you can't sing a song like
[1:22:42] that unless you've heard so bad
[1:22:46] that you know what it means for a trial
[1:22:47] to be a blessing
[1:22:50] the story behind that song
[1:22:54] the inspiration behind that song came
[1:22:57] from hurt and pain and anguish
[1:23:02] but from that song
[1:23:04] from the pain in that song that was
[1:23:06] written
[1:23:07] it has blessed and helped
[1:23:10] millions
[1:23:11] i said millions
[1:23:13] of christians
[1:23:15] make it through the day
[1:23:20] what a blessing
[1:23:22] how will god look down at brother terry
[1:23:24] when he when he's when he approaches him
[1:23:27] he said son
[1:23:29] i know that was painful
[1:23:31] i know it hurt for you to share the
[1:23:33] things i know it hurt you to put in
[1:23:34] words what you've been through but i
[1:23:36] want you to look at the millions of
[1:23:38] people that have been
[1:23:40] blessed
[1:23:41] through that ministry
[1:23:44] you see what i mean sometimes they come
[1:23:47] from painful circumstances
[1:23:51] you know
[1:23:53] a hammer
[1:23:56] you take a 16 ounce frame and hammer
[1:24:00] and that's one of the handiest tools you
[1:24:02] can have
[1:24:03] every carpenter's got one they're in
[1:24:05] every drawer and every kitchen of every
[1:24:07] household
[1:24:09] right everybody's got a hammer
[1:24:12] carpenters they treasure this tool they
[1:24:14] treasure this hammer and it and it's
[1:24:16] useful
[1:24:17] it's essential if you're going to drive
[1:24:19] those nails into place
[1:24:22] each blow forces them to bite deeper and
[1:24:24] deeper
[1:24:25] and deeper
[1:24:27] as the head of that hammer pounds and
[1:24:29] pounds and pounds
[1:24:32] on the head of that nail
[1:24:34] but did you ever think
[1:24:36] did you ever stop and think about the
[1:24:38] nail
[1:24:40] if it had reason
[1:24:41] and emotion
[1:24:43] wouldn't it give you a different story
[1:24:46] yeah
[1:24:47] to the nail the hammer is brutal
[1:24:50] it's relentless
[1:24:51] it's a master that doesn't quit it's an
[1:24:53] enemy that loves to beat it into
[1:24:55] submission
[1:24:56] that would be the nail's view of the
[1:24:59] hammer
[1:25:00] and it's correct
[1:25:02] except for one thing
[1:25:05] the nail forgot the most important fact
[1:25:07] of his painful life
[1:25:10] brothers and sisters the nail and the
[1:25:12] hammer are both held by the same
[1:25:14] carpenter
[1:25:17] the same carpenter decides when he
[1:25:20] reaches into his nail pouch of believers
[1:25:24] and holds that nail
[1:25:27] pulls that hammer out of its hoop
[1:25:30] he decides
[1:25:32] the carpenter decides which nail and
[1:25:34] which hammer
[1:25:35] is best to fit the job
[1:25:38] and it's the carpenter who swings the
[1:25:40] hammer
[1:25:42] did you ever think about it that way
[1:25:45] your pain sometimes you're hurt
[1:25:47] sometimes the things you go through it's
[1:25:49] god allowing him to come your way it's
[1:25:51] the decision of a sovereign
[1:25:54] carpenter
[1:25:55] it can be brutal
[1:26:00] verse 9
[1:26:02] tells us the reality of the life of
[1:26:04] jabez
[1:26:05] he was a he was a godly man with painful
[1:26:08] life we've determined that verse 10
[1:26:10] tells us how he responds to that life it
[1:26:13] says he called upon the god of israel
[1:26:15] saying oh that i would be the oh that
[1:26:17] thou would bless me and enlarge my
[1:26:19] border and that your hand might be
[1:26:21] might with me and that you would keep me
[1:26:22] from harm so that i'm so that might not
[1:26:25] bring me pain
[1:26:28] brother and sister you know why the
[1:26:29] prayer of jabez was so popular
[1:26:32] the prayer of jabez became so popular
[1:26:34] because jabez
[1:26:36] was a person that we can relate to
[1:26:40] think about it
[1:26:42] he's not mentioned in the bible of ever
[1:26:44] being wise
[1:26:46] strong
[1:26:47] he didn't have the wisdom of solomon the
[1:26:48] strength of david the riches of the
[1:26:51] kings
[1:26:52] you know i've been studying too on the
[1:26:54] queen of sheba and man you're talking
[1:26:56] about some riches
[1:26:58] when she came to see the the king there
[1:27:00] were some riches exchanged hands there
[1:27:03] this is not japanese no this is this is
[1:27:05] an ordinary guy
[1:27:07] he wasn't celebrated for being gifted or
[1:27:09] talented or accomplished in anything in
[1:27:11] the bible
[1:27:12] find it i'd like to know
[1:27:14] but he's just like you and me
[1:27:17] everyday job
[1:27:21] but the one thing that made him special
[1:27:23] was
[1:27:24] the fact that he knew how to pray
[1:27:27] this one little verse in prayer tells us
[1:27:29] that prayer is all we need to experience
[1:27:31] the blessings of god
[1:27:35] it all happens after your prayer
[1:27:38] spurgeon listen to this this is good
[1:27:41] spurgeon said it this way
[1:27:43] prayer is the slender nerve that moves
[1:27:45] the hand of omnipotence
[1:27:52] in studying anatomy and physiology we
[1:27:53] have nerves running all through our
[1:27:55] bodies
[1:27:56] and these nerves are going through our
[1:27:57] hands through our fingers up our upper
[1:27:59] arms and into our spinal column and up
[1:28:01] into the brain to send the signal to our
[1:28:03] hands to move and it's the slender
[1:28:07] nerve of prayer
[1:28:09] that causes the omnipotence of god
[1:28:12] to move
[1:28:15] you think about that
[1:28:17] god moves when you pray those are god's
[1:28:20] provisions jabez says oh lord that you
[1:28:23] would bless me enlarge my border
[1:28:26] bless me
[1:28:30] that's personal bless me enlarge my
[1:28:33] border
[1:28:35] sometimes we we're afraid to pray to god
[1:28:37] that way
[1:28:39] we're afraid to ask for anything for
[1:28:40] ourself
[1:28:43] why is that
[1:28:45] we're afraid to say god i need you in my
[1:28:48] life i need you to do this
[1:28:50] and increase my borders but not jabez he
[1:28:52] knew who he was he was personal he was
[1:28:54] bold he was confident he was specific in
[1:28:57] his prayer
[1:29:04] he was praying believing that god was
[1:29:06] willing to hear
[1:29:08] he was praying knowing that god cares
[1:29:10] about his pains his needs and his hopes
[1:29:13] he was praying believing that there was
[1:29:14] nothing hard for god
[1:29:19] so why is that
[1:29:22] the book of james tells us you don't
[1:29:24] have because you don't ask
[1:29:29] and yet we wonder where is god in all of
[1:29:31] my life
[1:29:32] did you ask
[1:29:36] i believe this is the number one reason
[1:29:37] god don't answer our prayers when we go
[1:29:38] on and we look this is our sincerity
[1:29:41] our our our our commitment our
[1:29:44] regularity to pray to god our earnest us
[1:29:46] to pray to god because james in in
[1:29:49] chapter four goes on to say in simple
[1:29:51] terms you ask and you do not receive
[1:29:53] because you ask wrongly or spend it on
[1:29:55] your passions
[1:29:57] i like that interpretation of that
[1:30:00] because that brings it personal down to
[1:30:02] us
[1:30:03] and many a christian need an education
[1:30:05] and how to pray
[1:30:07] yep
[1:30:11] i have to be honest and saying sometimes
[1:30:13] i shake my head when people go to pray
[1:30:16] i i scratch my head and
[1:30:19] and and i
[1:30:21] just wonder
[1:30:26] you see these people sometimes start out
[1:30:29] lord bless
[1:30:32] first thing they say lord bless
[1:30:35] lord give
[1:30:38] lord i need
[1:30:42] lord's supply
[1:30:45] and i just kind of like wow that's not
[1:30:48] the way the most
[1:30:50] the lord
[1:30:52] but the bible teaches us to approach the
[1:30:55] father that knoweth all things that we
[1:30:57] have need of before we even ask him
[1:31:00] in this manner pray ye our father
[1:31:04] this is jesus speaking
[1:31:06] our father
[1:31:08] plural jesus was saying he's more than
[1:31:10] just for me he's for you too
[1:31:13] our
[1:31:14] father he's making it social
[1:31:18] here's your first tick tock
[1:31:21] social media
[1:31:24] jesus is saying let's make this thing go
[1:31:26] viral here it is social our father which
[1:31:29] is in heaven acknowledging that he is a
[1:31:31] god of a kingdom
[1:31:33] that he is a god of a kingdom and of the
[1:31:36] domain that he is our lord that he's
[1:31:38] king
[1:31:40] brother mother just preached on all that
[1:31:43] god is he is a king but he is the king
[1:31:47] of kings he is the lord of lords his
[1:31:51] kingdom is a kingdom that we will have
[1:31:53] only come unto us
[1:31:54] there's many kingdoms but it's his
[1:31:56] kingdom and that's what this bible is
[1:31:58] telling us our father which art in
[1:32:00] heaven hallowed be thy name you know
[1:32:02] what hallowed means it means somebody
[1:32:04] who's holy who's revered who is honored
[1:32:07] who is cherished who is consecrated
[1:32:14] so when jesus prays
[1:32:16] that he first off say god don't send me
[1:32:18] to the cross
[1:32:20] no
[1:32:21] our father
[1:32:23] which art in heaven hallowed be thy name
[1:32:25] thy kingdom come thy will be done not
[1:32:28] mine but yours god
[1:32:31] thy will be done on earth
[1:32:33] just like it is in your kingdom in
[1:32:35] heaven
[1:32:37] do you see the difference in how you ask
[1:32:38] and how you approach god
[1:32:41] god give me give me give me give me
[1:32:42] glass blessed bless i need need want
[1:32:45] want
[1:32:46] or god
[1:32:48] of the most high
[1:32:50] that i bow down to that i cherish that i
[1:32:52] adore that i love that save me in my
[1:32:54] sins
[1:32:56] i fall at your face
[1:32:59] my knees bend at the very presence of
[1:33:01] your sight
[1:33:03] could you have mercy on me today
[1:33:08] then you're connecting with a god
[1:33:11] when you fall when you when you go to
[1:33:13] god
[1:33:14] in that presence
[1:33:16] then you find yourself connecting with
[1:33:18] god in a special kind of way
[1:33:22] then you'll start seeing your
[1:33:23] blessings arise
[1:33:25] forgive us of our trespasses as we
[1:33:27] forgive those who trespass against us
[1:33:29] you're acknowledging i'm a sinner
[1:33:34] i'm no better than anybody else
[1:33:38] and i got to forgive them
[1:33:40] so that you'll forgive me
[1:33:46] i like us here where he talks about he's
[1:33:49] called upon god to bless
[1:33:51] him to enlarge his border i'm gonna try
[1:33:53] to finish up here
[1:33:56] but the next thing he says
[1:33:58] and that your hand might be
[1:34:01] with me
[1:34:04] so here jabez is now he's praying that
[1:34:07] god the power of god's hand would be
[1:34:09] with him
[1:34:11] the the prayer request for god's
[1:34:12] powerful presence
[1:34:14] complements the previous request that
[1:34:16] god would bless him
[1:34:18] so think about what i just said there
[1:34:20] jabez was wise enough to know that he
[1:34:22] needed both god's provisions and god's
[1:34:24] presence
[1:34:27] it's not good enough that god just gives
[1:34:28] to you and gives to you
[1:34:32] god can do that to anybody
[1:34:35] but the thing about a blessing is god
[1:34:37] gives it to you and his presence is
[1:34:39] there with you
[1:34:41] can you imagine the misery you would be
[1:34:43] in if all you had was god's provision
[1:34:45] and none of his presence
[1:34:47] god could give you truckloads of money
[1:34:50] but without his presence you wouldn't
[1:34:52] know where to spend it and how to give
[1:34:53] and how to bless and how to give to
[1:34:54] those who have it in the kingdom of god
[1:34:57] god can bless you with all the health in
[1:34:59] the world and if he was healthy and you
[1:35:01] was a a masculine man and you was
[1:35:05] oh man in your majesty and so forth but
[1:35:07] yet you didn't have a family to share
[1:35:09] that health with
[1:35:11] because you walked out on them
[1:35:21] can you
[1:35:23] notoriety
[1:35:25] everywhere you went somebody knows you
[1:35:27] everywhere you got me
[1:35:30] and a guy come up to me he said how you
[1:35:32] doing i said good
[1:35:34] he said i know who you are i said
[1:35:38] okay who who okay who are you
[1:35:40] aren't you that guy that was
[1:35:42] in that movie
[1:35:48] you got the wrong guy
[1:35:52] i didn't know who he was talking about
[1:35:54] he said i'm sorry i got an elevator left
[1:35:57] i should have said well
[1:36:00] but notoriety can you imagine having
[1:36:02] that kind of notoriety but having no
[1:36:03] heavenly home
[1:36:07] because the presence of god didn't come
[1:36:09] along with the provisions of god
[1:36:12] look
[1:36:13] at the prodigal
[1:36:15] son think about that the pro
[1:36:18] political son he foolishly thought he
[1:36:20] could live independent off of his
[1:36:22] father so he goes out into the world he
[1:36:25] says i'm going to live my life the way i
[1:36:26] want to live it bless god bless you
[1:36:29] father i'm out of here
[1:36:31] yeah that worked for a that worked for a
[1:36:33] good a good good wage there it went real
[1:36:35] good for him for a little while but
[1:36:36] eventually he ran out of daddy's money
[1:36:39] eventually he had all that he was good
[1:36:42] as long as he had what god what his
[1:36:43] daddy was giving him as long as the
[1:36:45] provisions of daddy kept flowing through
[1:36:49] but daddy finally said you know what if
[1:36:51] you can't grace me with your presence
[1:36:55] my provisions are cut off
[1:37:00] and it was only then that he recognized
[1:37:01] and remembered the goodness of his
[1:37:04] father
[1:37:05] when he was down there eating with the
[1:37:06] swine
[1:37:08] he's eating with the swine he remembers
[1:37:10] you know what i think this may be a
[1:37:11] better idea because i've come to the
[1:37:13] conclusion that i'm better off to be a
[1:37:14] slave in my daddy's house than a playboy
[1:37:16] on my own
[1:37:18] because i'm living with the hogs
[1:37:23] and jabez was praying here he wanted
[1:37:26] god's hand to be with him jabez didn't
[1:37:28] want to be like this prodigal son
[1:37:30] jabez didn't want that prodigal son
[1:37:32] experience he prayed that the lord would
[1:37:34] keep it
[1:37:35] keep me at your arms length
[1:37:42] we need to be at the
[1:37:43] arms length of god
[1:37:46] that's where i want to live my life at a
[1:37:47] place where no matter what i'm going
[1:37:50] through no matter what what's going on
[1:37:51] in my life that i can say god wrap your
[1:37:53] arms around me and hold me in tight
[1:37:55] don't let nothing pull me away from you
[1:37:59] we heard stories of those people that
[1:38:00] went through the devastation and a
[1:38:02] tornado and they said that at the last
[1:38:04] minute at the last second mamas and
[1:38:06] daddies was grabbing their kids and
[1:38:08] wrapping their arms around as tight as
[1:38:10] they could just so they wouldn't be
[1:38:12] snatched away
[1:38:13] that's where i want to be so close to my
[1:38:15] god that no matter what trial no matter
[1:38:18] what storm no matter what wind comes my
[1:38:20] way he will wrap his arms around me and
[1:38:22] hold me so tight that i can't be
[1:38:26] snatched away
[1:38:36] jabez knew
[1:38:38] the old famous saying that we've heard
[1:38:40] take you further than you want to go
[1:38:42] sin will cost you more than you want to
[1:38:44] pay and sin will keep you longer than
[1:38:46] you want to stay
[1:38:48] brothers and sisters we need
[1:38:50] to pray the distance i'm trying to put
[1:38:52] another
[1:38:53] number to it
[1:38:54] just trying to think maybe i don't know
[1:38:56] from here to the back of the
[1:38:58] back of the vestibule of the foyer there
[1:39:01] and following behind them as a grown man
[1:39:04] just
[1:39:08] and i don't know what he's saying while
[1:39:09] we're on their heels
[1:39:11] and he's just flapping his jaws
[1:39:14] and this goes on he goes i'm watching
[1:39:15] all the way i'm trying to figure out
[1:39:16] what in the world
[1:39:21] from me
[1:39:23] and he said something and it triggered
[1:39:25] weston
[1:39:26] and he turned around
[1:39:28] and i knew right then that pile right
[1:39:29] there before you could blink an eye
[1:39:33] and i asked him who do you think you are
[1:39:35] well i'm the athletic director i don't
[1:39:37] care quit talking to these boys that way
[1:39:40] and this is happening of course in the
[1:39:41] middle of the gym floor
[1:39:43] right on the sidelines
[1:39:47] and i felt like i was pretty cool
[1:39:49] i felt like i was pretty calm
[1:39:54] kind of like the hulk he wouldn't want
[1:39:55] to see me when i'm angry
[1:39:59] joe said
[1:40:01] what happened
[1:40:03] so i began to tell her the story
[1:40:07] she said i've never seen your face that
[1:40:09] red in all my life
[1:40:16] she said you were madder than i've ever
[1:40:18] seen you come to find out other people
[1:40:21] was fixing to come to my support
[1:40:25] i had people fixing to come down out of
[1:40:26] the
[1:40:28] crowd
[1:40:28] pastors of churches
[1:40:32] to come to my one one of the pastors
[1:40:35] wives asked him said what was he going
[1:40:36] to do why was he going he said i don't
[1:40:38] know but i just felt like i needed to be
[1:40:39] there
[1:40:45] and you know i i took they just kind of
[1:40:47] told me to back away that guy walked the
[1:40:49] other way i
[1:40:52] i'm good so i went and sat down
[1:40:54] and i got home i said you know what
[1:40:56] joyce
[1:40:58] i can't be doing that
[1:41:01] i said i'm a minister of the gospel
[1:41:05] i can't let those kinds of things get to
[1:41:08] me
[1:41:09] but what was it was my son
[1:41:13] somebody was mistreating my son
[1:41:16] so can you imagine the wrath of god when
[1:41:18] the devil mistreats you
[1:41:23] that was my son but i told her i said
[1:41:24] i've got to be able to handle those
[1:41:26] things better
[1:41:28] i said what if i would have hit him
[1:41:37] preacher clark's athletic director
[1:41:41] goes to jail
[1:41:45] that's the headline
[1:41:49] but i said we got to do better
[1:41:53] i got to protect me from me
[1:41:57] now i'm being honest with you
[1:42:00] now you point your finger back and say i
[1:42:02] got to protect me from me
[1:42:06] there's a story and i'm closing i
[1:42:08] promise
[1:42:09] there was a story
[1:42:14] duke raynold
[1:42:16] lived in the 14th century you ever heard
[1:42:18] of him
[1:42:19] good
[1:42:21] lived in the 14th century
[1:42:23] he lived a life of indulgence
[1:42:25] and he was extremely overweight
[1:42:30] and so much that they called him
[1:42:31] gracious which means fat the people
[1:42:33] mocked him he was still a ruler he was a
[1:42:36] duke he was had had lordship over this
[1:42:38] place
[1:42:39] and this went on and went on and and one
[1:42:41] of these that one day his brother edward
[1:42:44] and him got into a conflict they got
[1:42:45] into a big battle so edwards leaves and
[1:42:47] he leaves and he comes back and he has a
[1:42:49] revolt against reynold
[1:42:52] and he overtakes them
[1:42:55] so edward now overtakes the city he
[1:42:58] captures reynolds but he promises him
[1:43:00] i'm not going to kill you
[1:43:05] and he thinks about how he can torture
[1:43:07] him and a scheme to get rid of him
[1:43:11] so he says i'm going to let you live in
[1:43:13] the castle
[1:43:15] so he places him in the castle at newark
[1:43:20] and he builds a room around him
[1:43:25] and he builds this room around him just
[1:43:27] a normal ordinary room
[1:43:30] and he says i'm not going to put any
[1:43:31] bars on the windows i'm not going to put
[1:43:32] any locks on the doors
[1:43:35] you're free to go
[1:43:37] anytime you can make it through the door
[1:43:42] remember i said he lived a life of
[1:43:43] indulgence
[1:43:46] he didn't fit through the door
[1:43:49] so you would think a man in his own
[1:43:51] right mind would start cutting back a
[1:43:53] little bit
[1:43:56] edward knew his weakness
[1:44:00] so every morning
[1:44:02] bacon eggs biscuits toast
[1:44:04] sausage gravy
[1:44:08] here brother
[1:44:10] here's your breakfast
[1:44:12] lunch
[1:44:14] mcdonald's wendy's burger king
[1:44:17] have it your
[1:44:18] way have it your way brother
[1:44:21] all you can eat
[1:44:23] supper filet mignon steak baked potato
[1:44:27] eat up brother
[1:44:28] you're free to go
[1:44:30] do you think he could turn it away
[1:44:33] he was a captive to his own self
[1:44:36] and he ate and he ate and he ate
[1:44:40] until there was no hope at all of him
[1:44:43] coming out
[1:44:44] his brother actually ended up dying i
[1:44:46] think in a tragic event and was no
[1:44:48] longer the ruler of him but he couldn't
[1:44:50] get out of the room and he died of
[1:44:51] health issues go figure
[1:44:54] like a year later
[1:44:56] a prisoner captive
[1:44:58] to his own self
[1:45:00] i thought my what a story
[1:45:03] what a story to think that many times
[1:45:04] people get themselves locked up
[1:45:08] they lock themselves away in rooms that
[1:45:10] have open doors there's no reason to be
[1:45:12] locked up we have open doors we have
[1:45:14] freedom we have god
[1:45:17] and we can't break free because of our
[1:45:18] own stubbornness
[1:45:23] because of rebellious attitudes sinful
[1:45:26] ways
[1:45:27] lack of discipline
[1:45:32] i think this morning we need to join
[1:45:34] jabez and ask god to protect us
[1:45:37] from us
[1:45:40] i like what the last verse in verse 10
[1:45:42] says the last sentence in verse 10 says
[1:45:45] and god granted what he asked
[1:45:50] i've been studying the good news
[1:45:52] the gospel
[1:45:54] a little book i got called what is the
[1:45:55] gospel
[1:45:57] i've been reading through it because you
[1:45:58] know i've always said i'm gonna preach
[1:45:59] the gospel and then i got to thinking
[1:46:01] what is the gospel
[1:46:06] who knows what the gospel means
[1:46:08] good news
[1:46:10] it's the good news but there's more to
[1:46:13] the gospel than just the good news
[1:46:15] because in the gospel there's hard times
[1:46:19] there's sinful life and a sinful life
[1:46:21] that has to give to repentance and
[1:46:23] repentance which gives salvation
[1:46:27] that's the gospel
[1:46:29] so here in this text where jabez is
[1:46:31] asking to be blessed he's been through
[1:46:33] the hard times he's been through the
[1:46:34] pain
[1:46:35] and he's now seeing the gospel
[1:46:40] it's the point where god is willing to
[1:46:42] hear and answer his prayers
[1:46:45] jeremiah 33 says call unto me and i will
[1:46:48] answer you i will tell you great and
[1:46:49] hidden things that you have not known
[1:46:53] matthew 7 says i ask and it will be
[1:46:55] given unto you seek and you will find
[1:46:56] knock and it will be open
[1:46:59] hebrews 4
[1:47:02] draw near to the throne of grace that we
[1:47:04] may receive mercy
[1:47:06] and find grace to help in a time of need
[1:47:11] brother sisters god hears and answers
[1:47:13] our prayers
[1:47:15] let's stand to our feet
