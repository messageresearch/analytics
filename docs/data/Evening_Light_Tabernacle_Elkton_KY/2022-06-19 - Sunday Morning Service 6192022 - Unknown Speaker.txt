========================================

this morning brother john this morning me amen if the children can be dismissed for sunday school we'll go in the psalms to psalms 103. happy father's day father's day to all the fathers it's a privilege and an honor to be in our father's house this morning and what a wonderful day he's given us a wonderful weather we know that where two or three gathered he promised that he'd be in our midst so whatever we have need of this morning i hope everybody came expecting psalms 103 and we're going to start in verse 10 and we're just going to read the verse out there psalms 103 verses starting at verse 10. he hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities as far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our transgressions from us where he knoweth our frame he remembered that we are dust where the wind passes over it and it is gone and the place thereof shall know it no more as keep his covenant and to those that remember his commandments to do them bless the lord ye his angels that excel in strength that do his commandments hearkening unto the voice of his word this one together bless the lord always works in all places of his dominion bless the lord o my soul god bless you may be seated brother brian good morning brothers and sisters if you would turn with me to deuteronomy the third chapter i don't know if i've mentioned this before but before i get started the uh we're down to about 71 000 on the on the general fund i don't know if i mentioned it the first week you know confession is good for the soul as you know when it gets hot like this i tend to get a little more busier and i'll just be honest there's twice this week that i've lost my i have an advantage in my business most of the time if i'm on a roof or in a rack room where there's no one around so if you get angry or you get mad no one hears you so you just have to accept the fact that you just we're out of place and there's been twice this week you know we all can lose our composure sometimes where you it's kind of funny when you're yelling at a thousand pieces thousand pound piece of steel for no reason you know that things have gone too far you know what i mean you need to separate you need to step back and think twice and uh and yesterday it was the same the second time and when you spent an hour standing on a ladder working i won't i was about to say i won't say it and then uh you realize that piece of equipment you know you've gone too far so you know we all get to a place in life where you know we have to realize we're not perfect but we do have a god that is perfect and if we cast our cares upon him and we all week you know sometimes we we forget the liberties we have as christians this morning you know you have the right to be happy this morning you have the right through the word of god and prayer and believing to be happy in the word of god and to be happy in the world every living this morning you don't have to be depressed you don't have to be angry you don't have to be none of that you got everything you need in the message of the hour and the word of god to be happy now does your enemy try to steal your happiness and try to steal your purpose you just have you know i've realized in life was the old post back to that psalm we were reading where it talks about we flourish like the flower and there's a lot of truth you know flower starts as a small thing just like we all do and at the end depending on the type of flowers it can be anything from a small plant to a large plant stove but eventually it's going to go back in the ground one day and before you realize it it's all over and the only thing that matters are you reflecting what god made you to be for this age that you're living in that i don't know what that is only you and god know what he wants you to flourish and want you to represent to the world that we're around this morning you know and i don't know what i'm saying it just bugs the heck out of me i i the lack of education in the world that we live in this morning unbelievable people i think it has a lot to do with the technology that people don't they don't have to learn like you used to learn 40 or 50 years ago they don't have to learn that way they've got so much technology that the basics they just they don't have any basics you know this morning and when you get around you know i don't i haven't been a service manager in a long time but when you get around younger younger people and you try to use critical thinking type of skills that's too sometimes it's just too hard they just they want to know the answer up front and stay first and that's not how life is that's not how a christian is sometimes you got to solve the problem to get the answer you got to go through the struggle you got to go through the word of god and you got to go through prayer and fasting and believing to get the answer sometimes sometimes the answer doesn't come first but i was thinking this morning this this was the devotional this morning and i'm totally off my point if you travel with me to the third chapter of deuteronomy you know moses wasn't allowed to go over into the the promised land but uh i'll just read what the scriptures this morning it's at the third chapter starting at about i won't read this long chapter about the 23rd 23rd 22nd verse and you know the preachers have taught bro you know deuteronomy is a book it's got two laws two ways a way of life the other is a way of death and you as a individual this morning are going to choose either way that's going to be your choice no one will make it for you that's a choice you'll have to make for yourself this morning i'll start at the 20s you shall not fear them for the lord your god shall fight for you saying this morning you don't fight your battles for you if you'll just surrender to him this morning let me sought the lord at the time saying oh lord thou has begun to show thy servant my greatness my mighty hand for what god is there in heaven or in earth according to thy works and according to thy might i pray thee let me go over and see the good land that is beyond jordan the goodly mountains in lebanon and uh he's even asking god already told him several years before that he wasn't going to cross over but even at the end he's still asking that god would forgive him and let him cross over jordan and he goes on i lost my place but the lord was wrong with me for your sakes and would not hear me and the lord said unto me let it suffice thee speak no more unto me of this manner and get thee up to the top of pisgah and lift thy westward and northward and southward and eastward behold it was in it was thin eyes for thou shall not go over this jordan but he said by charge uh joshua and encourage him and strengthen him for he shall not ever before this is not so see and i was just thinking about i i was reading what brother brianna had to say about this and sometimes we have to make a choice there's two experiences where moses wasn't allowed to cross over and he had to look for at the good land from the top of the mountain pisgah and look at the land of milk and honey and then joshua was allowed to cross over but we don't we don't want to be like moses was even though he was a great prophet of god we want to be able to cross over we want that experience like elijah had where he was translated before the lord and went up into heaven that way and we all have to make a choice this morning where we're going to remain whether we're going to be on this side of the river or on the other side of the river and your testimony warning is going to determine that but i'll just read what brother random have to say before i digress here uh he there's some nuggets in this the reason that you hear me get the people say believe me and that's really true you know people to believe the word of god there's nothing impossible go see now that the reason i say it's not to believe as him certainly not is to believe that i have told you the truth sorry you sent me to do this now see when that you can get this people to believe and if you can even go back to that psalm we just read you know the bible teachers are spiritual angels god-given angels and then god calls his messengers and his prophets angels through and that was just in the psalm we read this morning to do this now we see what the angel met me he said if you can get these people to believe you peter and don pass and he said look on us is that right and elijah when all of them had come down there and got him kindly all started said if it wasn't i respect that this righteous man of jehoshaphat i wouldn't even look at you see so we can all nations but it's still the same god that leads us he goes on to know that you could send your soul to hell with a divine gift you know brother branham taught many messages about that you know you have to get the word of the lord and you have to be with the spirit of christ sometimes and you do not can't be running out ahead of what god wants you to do sometimes sure you can you have to watch what you're doing you believe moses was god's prophet and it goes back to what we're reading you know everyone knows why he didn't cross over before instead of speaking to the rock he struck the rock and he goes on god's prophets say amen he was god's prophet you know what he's done god told him to go down there and speak to the rock it was already smitten is that right instead of moses doing what god told them to do he went down and smote the rock again is that right and that's the same with you whatever you respect what he said in the beginning just through faith got to believe that god's going to do it for you and i lost my place here and well absolutely broke the entire there christ was spit twice he was meant once we him from now on is that right but when moses smote the rod he broke god's complete program he done exactly what god told him not to do see but he could whether it was god's will or not that seems strange doesn't it but it wasn't god will if he was a prophet he could do whatever he was what his power would permit him to do and i'm not going to finish reading the whole he goes on to talk about advise us he talks about how he cursed those children and the bears ate them up he talks about some other situations and we all have a choice how we're going to use the gifts that god gives us whether we're going to use them to bless the people around us or curse the people around us and we all have to make that choice and it depends on where you are this morning spiritually with jesus christ is going to determine the attitude you had it goes back to what i said earlier you know i didn't have a very good attitude earlier this week when i was screaming at something but i chose that attitude i chose to let myself get angry in the situation that i was in instead of just stepping back and relaxing and not worrying that's that's the hard thing about life anytime you get in hard situations is stepping back and being quiet enough to let god deal with you whether it's a spiritual matter or it's a financial matter whether it's dealing with people sometimes you just got to be willing to stop and step back and let god deal with you let your mind deal with you and maybe there's always a better way to do something brother david you love him this morning let's stand if we couldn't appreciate that and and you know i kind of chuckling brother brian not to make fun of him but uh unfortunately it seems like the older we get we kind of get on the cranky side side every once in a while sister janet's going that way but i i i i'm kind of like brother brian i have to speak for myself sometimes i have to just sit back and say lord what is wrong with me amen that god is good to us in me and i sing that little course isn't he wonderful wonderful amen god bless you this morning well isn't he wonderful wonderful wonderful isn't jesus oh yes four eyes have seen ears have heard what's wrinkled that in god's word is a jesus wonderful once again [Music] [Music] wonderful eyes have seen ears have heard what's recorded in god's word isn't she wonderful can we sing it again [Music] eyes have seen years i've heard what's wrinkled in god's word [Music] wonderful [Music] you believe that with all of your heart amen god bless you may be seated this morning and we've got a lot of folks out this morning but we're happy for our visitors it's good to have david and sister laura with us this morning and the david'll be speaking here after after just a little bit and of course i don't count john michael and emma visitors they're just home folks that's come back home they've been gone for a few days so it's good to have them here this morning and i said we have several gone brother thomas is preaching for the dewey moss this morning so just want to remember him as he's gone this morning and amen and brother steve always picks on me when i wear my musical tie and he said well he said we're gonna be on tap this morning but we've got three specials he said well you won't get to do good since you got your musical tile on he said since we're gonna have so many specials and two this morning and i said i need all the help i can get if it's a tie or most of all prayers and we'll get it done this morning but god is good in me and this song this morning i woke up and this song was on my heart and i got to thinking about it and i thought you know if there's ever a people that ought to be happy this morning it's those that's redeemed let's sing that song it's on page 140 redeemed how i love to proclaim it this morning amen we're just happy this morning

this morning we want to look at a little thought this morning ii chronicles the 12th chapter if you have your bibles this morning second chronicles chapter 12. we look at verse 13. amen how many's got a need this morning by left-hand let's just pray amen heavenly father lord jesus we come to you this morning realizing father that you're still jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and lord we just asked oh god that you just helped us this morning lord may we move ourselves out of the way lord and you do this speaking this morning lord you saw the hands you know what was behind each and every hand it was that before it was raised so father we just asked so god that you just help us this morning lord may we not give up back up stop lord until we're prayed up preached up in everything lord god and when you come you won't have no trouble recognizing us for our banner we'll be clear that's what we want this morning lord our banner to be clear father i pray lord that you just help us this morning there'll be any sick amongst us just touch and heal save the loss fill all with the holy ghost be with our pastor back home this morning the service is there brother tom there lord with brother dewey moss this morning just different ones oh god you're bright around the world lord we love you and we appreciate you lord god now i know what my lips are clay let me say those things you'd help me to say refrain from those things that you would not want me to say lord anoint the hearts and ears of the listeners this morning and we'll give you the glory and the praise for it all in jesus name amen second chronicles the 12th chapter and we'll look at the 13th verse there ii chronicles 12 and verse 13. it says so king rehoboam strengthened himself in jerusalem and reigned for rehoboam was uh 1 and 40 years old when he began to reign and he reigned 17 years in jerusalem the city which the lord had chosen out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there and his mother's name was nemaya and emmanitas and he did evil because he prepared not his heart to seek the lord now the acts of rehoboam first and last are they not written in the book of shema the prophet and of edu the the seer concerning genealogies and there were between rehoboam and jeroboam continually and rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david and abigail now his son reigned in his dead may the lord add a blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated this morning if i put a little thought or a little title to this thought this morning it'd be your heart's not prepared your heart's not prepared so we just look at this for a little while and try not to hold you too long this morning but we just want to uh just look at these things just for a little bit this morning and try to hope that the lord would give us something this morning out of his word this morning amen it's not being prepared and it sit here take my thought and i'm taking my thoughts from uh verse 14 and said and he did evil because he prepared not his heart to seek the lord he did evil because he prepared not his heart to seek the lord and i was thinking about that and you know the sum of his life it said that he did evil in the sight of the lord you know the summary of every one of our lives when it's all said and done when everything is over with and and and and everything is done and everything is over the summary of our life will either be evil or right in the sight of the lord i hope that mine is right in the sight of the lord and only way it can be right is if my heart is prepared to seek the lord see it said there that his heart that he did not his heart was not was uh not prepared to seek the lord and therefore he done evil in his sight now just for a little background maybe rehab he might not have been as half as bad as some others you could talk about a lot of people like that well you know he's not half as bad as this fella or this fellow or she's not half as bad as this sister or that sister whatever it may be but maybe you know they might say well he wasn't not half as bad as some others he wasn't a he was not a ab you remember the sin of abraham he he married up with an unbeliever and the scripture says we not we shouldn't be uh uniquely oak together with uh with unbelievers how many young people you that seek for something because we wouldn't want to be an equipped together so he wasn't an ahab or a manasseh and i looked up manasseh and it says manasseh he turned against god and worshiped every kind of pagan deity so he wasn't this here reborns he just said that he did not prepare his heart therefore he didn't even on the side of god now he like i said he wasn't as bad as as some of the other have his men but he was he wasn't i have or a manasseh it says but and manasseh turned against god worship every kind of pagan deity he was guilty of immorality he practiced every conceivable evil and perversion he devoted himself to witchcraft and was a murderer even sacrificing his sons to a pagan god so here just reborn he wasn't as half as bad as these others but he did not see god's face because his heart was not prepared sometimes he did good and that's even every one of us sometimes he did good the sum was he did evil and so i looked up his mother's name it said there in the scripture we read nemaya and she was a ammonitis and she was one of solomon's wives out of the thousands that he had this was one of solomon's wife and this is one of solomon's this is one that solomon favored a whole lot this nehemiah so i looked up her and did some research and said solomon's wife the my son and his wife who he favored most and ammonites they weren't highly regarded of israel and together with the moabites they hired balaam to curse israel so that's who the ammonites were and so this this woman this wife of solomon this was real boy william's mother and brother madam city like this said that the the mother was the fifth gospel in other words she's the one and let me just read it to you if i can amen out the other message in invasion in the usa and brother brown preached this on mother's day now listen what he says he said to you little mothers here this morning that's been real mothers and i know there's many of you i thank every one of you he said let me tell you something he said god bless you to you that's real mother she's saying god bless you you're the fifth gospel he said let me tell you what that what's in there for your child just a little thing cause bro and he goes on to tell about how that the mother she's the fifth gospel because she teaches her children right to love god and to to to honor god and to serve god he said any good true loyal mother that would take your little babies instead of sending them to picture shows and dances and so forth like that some legs and and and and or her laughing and teaching about the lord jesus christ he said to his mother i've been so and he began to say i've been so deceived by this and this mother and talking about this one man said he said mother i believe you're about the only sweetheart i really have a woman that's true to me and sticks to me that's a mother's love that's a real mother that put her arms around her baby regardless whether he's right or wrong she goes right on to him and if a mother can think that of her baby how much more will god thinking of his you see you stay right with him amen talking about the mother being the fifth gospel so in here you know we we're influenced by uh uh either the the the the mom or the dad whatever you know we could like you you take two couples maybe they're unequally oak together and for some reason and and maybe one's a believer one's not a believer and it depends on how the child which way the the the the child or the children lean to that's the way they'll go sometimes if the mother don't teach them right at home because usually you know usually brethren said this about on influence he said that the mother sometimes it's the one that they they take a first step by and they say their first words by all them and sometimes if they're not influenced right in the beginning they'll go wrong they'll do it wrong and so this woman here this nema rehab's mother that we read about she was an idol worshiper adulteress woman a man she she was one that probably she might have told uh and we know how solomon was how that solomon prayed when he first became king he said lord i don't even know how to come in and go out and you gave me these people to be in charge to be ruler to be king over i don't even know how to come in and go out lord would you would you help me lord would you lead me would you guide me and the bible says because he didn't ask for wealth he didn't ask anything he said god gave him wisdom of how to lead and guide his people israel but usually in a message brother pre-influenced the mother usually there with us to take their first step or their first words or like we said would teach them about jesus sometimes they might teach them about their own thoughts or whatever they think especially if she's not a real true believer and so you know abraham lincoln he said if i can give any credit to anyone that would be my mother said to how she she taught me to love and honor jesus she told me how to pray and to read his word so if any honor would go to anyone it would be my mother that's the words of abraham lincoln in other words and i think mother brother made this statement one time he said a a a real godly woman a real woman that's godly is the backbone to any nation so depends on how she conducts herself hey man how how she acts and how she does hey man i thought about and you you you take many examples and it just depends you know because you get so many you know and it's it's strange how that these things work because we're taught by the prophet of god that the blood comes from the male amen the blood comes from the male but when you get together you know so many chromosomes of the woman so many other men and sometimes they'll look like the mother instead of the dad that god that most my children my two look like her instead of me but i'm just saying it and then they picked up characteristics along the way and maybe it goes way back and many generations they'll pick up and say well you that i remember how that's how grandpa used to act like how grandma used to act but you know we don't have to be like that amen because we're born again brother raven said he realized that hey listen i'm not a child or a son i've got charles and nellie brenham but i'm a child of god this morning amen oh hallelujah and we sometimes we would say well it's just my way that's why i know it's the gadgets they got a temper or it's this or that and that's my but if it's god's your life amen like that brother was saying this morning sometimes we need to just stop back just step a little bit say god i don't know what why everything is going wrong today but lord i know you've got everything under control would you lead me with your guidance help me to say the right things help me to do the right thing say the right words lord amen and so we find out another example in the bible you take you take a you look at isaac and rebecca both of them godly parents amen but in there they had a son that loved the birthright isaac amen and they had one that had despised their birthright and that was esau both of them being born to godly parents so sometimes it's not all together amen the way the dad is or the way the mom is it's sometimes it recalls we did not prepare our hearts to seek after god i wonder this morning when we come here this morning and you say well brother tom ain't here and then we're gonna have a but lord let it not be that way let me come to the house of god let me prepare my heart lord to seek your face lord because of my dog i'll do evil on your side so lord let me prepare my heart let me be right lord let my attitude be right let my thinking be right lord that i can seek your face lord so many examples there was adam and eve in the garden of eden amen and uh and brother branham tells us amen that they taught their boys cain and abel that was fruit of the garden what drove them out of the garden of eden but they had lied to them amen brother said adam and eve they're boys then but abel amen he had a heart that was prepared to seek god and because his heart was prepared to seek god by revelation he knew what it what it was it caused the fall in the garden amen what happened between his mom and the serpent in that way he could offer blood a blood sacrifice why because he prepared his heart to seek god cain on the other hand didn't prepare his heart and even when he'd seen abel's sacrifice being accepted by god the bible says his countenance got kind of rough i wonder sometimes if our catalans don't become that way when we see other people getting blessed amen we see other people getting blessed in the house of god god i want everybody to be blessed i won't i don't know about why i hate to see anybody suffer hey brother david i hate to see anybody hurt i hate to see anybody sick hey man i hate to see anybody else discouraged amen i like to see people blessed amen well there's a lot of that because amen they they they got the right attitude and they didn't prepare this big god amen then they get kind of offended when they see somebody else getting blessed amen oh my and so there was the kings eating because of what he thought because he didn't want to seek god amen he thought what abel's doing that that just a mess he's taking that lamb wrapping a a grape vine around him and bringing them to this altar amen and laying them up on that altar and taking a sharp rock and and beating his neck to the blood is covering his whole body and everything the blood's going down that lamb oh but abel knew that hey it's blood amen that got us in this mess in the first place amen and it's gonna take blood to get us back into life with the father and then it's gonna take blood to get us back in fellowship with the father mccain didn't want to go that route and the bible says his countenance became raw amen so god speaks to him and says hey listen if you do like your brother you'll be accepted if you do like abel did amen you'll be accepted you'll be good you'll do all right but he didn't want to go that way one place the problem god said here it is lord you just take it or leave it and god left it why because heart wasn't prepared oh i hope our hearts prepared this morning because i don't want to i don't want to get in that attitude here lord i'm at the service this morning and suddenly here it's sunday morning i'm coming in lord i'm gonna i'm gonna do what i i'm supposed to do you either take it or leave it and maybe he'll leave it because our heart's not prepared i want my heart to be prepared amen oh oh there's been many times when our heart ain't prepared and the prophet of god said it like this on the message influence he said 98 of the time depends on a certain atmosphere in a certain environment that children live under amen if they live in the right atmosphere in the right environment 98 of the time they'll do right and they'll go right amen i remember many a time and you heard over the course of the years amen here's a young man or an elderly part maybe a middle-aged man or a young woman or a middle-aged woman or whatever kneeling down at the altar and they say there's here's an answer to mom's prayer right here amen an answer to a mom's prayer because a mom would be praying for a kid say man and man and the child finally comes amen and say i need your lord and they said there's an answer to uh a mother's prayer oh help us lord there wasn't now this real boom he said that like i said the psalm but there's some of his his was that he did evil and it wasn't maybe because of his dad or her mother maybe he you know maybe i don't know how his mother taught him or whatever but maybe she said you know you know what uh i love your dad and i'm your favorite that one of your favorite i'm your favorite wife out of all the rest i'm your dad's favorite and he lets me keep these idols and everything and all that and and i i don't have to go to the same church that he's going to i don't have to believe it i don't know if that's what it was but maybe it wasn't because of his dad or because like i said his dad we we started off with he saw he wanted he wanted god's guidance and god gave him wisdom amen to lead god's people but it was maybe not because of his death or his mom's influence but it was because he didn't prepare his heart to seek god you may be here this morning and it might not be because of your dad and mom's influence amen that you're going wrong or doing wrong but it might be because that you're not preparing your heart to seek after god so when i come to the house of god i want to say god here i am i want to prepare my heart lord i want to make sure i'm ready i want to make sure i'm ready i don't know who's preaching lord but i pray oh god that them words that he's preaching i speak to my heart this morning let my heart be prepared let my mind be prepared let my soul be prepared lord let's just look at this for a little bit number one rehoboam he did not begin life with seeking the lord that's the main thing he didn't begin his life with seeking the lord now imagine you know his dad did because he saw the lord as we said and god gave him wisdom whatever you do in life wherever you go and brother ben said even in marriage you need to pray about it amen you need even in choosing your pastor you need to pray about it amen cause your pastor can be a big influence on your whatever amen brother brown called it that way he said you take a church sometimes in a church and they look at the way their pastor you said sometimes you look into other people you know that's how the pastor acts and he's judged his head a certain way he said you want your congregation they'll shake their head that way but i don't want to shake my head the way brother homer shakes his head or not i want to i want to prepare my heart to meet god amen i i remember brother homer would quit today and say i don't believe this message i don't want nothing to do with it god help me to keep pressing on help me to keep pressing lord help me to keep pushing lord help me to keep my faith set on you lord amen so he didn't start out right hey man he didn't start his life like his dad did by seeking the lord amen so whatever we got what if we do you need to seek him he saw counsel without prayer well i'll just get somebody and i i won't pray about the situation i'll just open the senior council and see what they have to say and i won't pray about the situation brothers and sisters young people we better pray more than we ever had amen we look at the hour we're living in look at that look at everything around us amen look at the corruption going on amen if we ever needed to pray we need to pray now if we ever needed to prepare our hearts we need to prepare them now tomorrow may be too late amen so i want to not take up counsel without prayer amen but i want to seek god's counsel with prayer hey man and if i should talk to somebody i'd say god you point me to the right person to talk to let me not talk about somebody that's a wishy-washy that stays out out of church half the time but don't come to church half the time and when they come they ain't really here they don't enter in they don't do anything they don't back up the pastor they don't say they leave it all on the song leader to worship god let us lord let me not seek that counsel but let me find somebody that loves you that honors you that believes you that will do your will lord let me see that kind of counsel not only that but let me do it with prayer lord let me do it with prayer another thing he listen to others i don't want to listen to anybody especially if they ain't saying he he listened to others amen and he commenced his life without god and usually when we do that it always ends in a failure lord let me not commence you amen and he he in the industry he didn't begin life would see he chose the worst counselors he he he he chose the worst of the counselors he chose the younger and the prouder the ones that probably would take his side sometimes that's what we do we don't prepare our hearts right so we take people counsel or we go try to find somebody that will take our side on the situation and take instead of taking god's side on the situation because our hearts not prepared they saw the worst of the counselors the younger and the prouder those that didn't really respect god or his word he chose them oh my and he rejected divine wisdom he rejected the wisdom of the wiser he rejected the wisdom of god and took those who didn't care too much about god's word he committed folly by threatening the people and refusing their just demands because they came to him but people came to rehoboam said hey your your father he taxed us heavy and grievously and we wanted but he he put more demands on them and he made their taxes even more heavier and burdensome he didn't listen to their just demands amen because he didn't have any of his father's wisdom because he didn't start out right by seeking the lord oh and that holy and righteous without being guided by the lord in his word we'll come to church share on sunday morning and wednesday night and we just go through the motions amen i don't want to just go through the motions i want to make sure something's on the inside of the inside i might not raise my hands i may not shout i may not dance but there's something on the inside of me that's raising them and there's something from on the inside that said lord i want more of you lord i want your word to be number one in my life i don't want to act holy and righteous amen and passing all them things without being guided by the lord in his word oh lord help me let my heart be prepared number two he showed no heart in seeking the lord in other words he he he didn't show no uh he wasn't jealous about seeking the lord and he might have could have called back in the day as we all say back in the day maybe he obeyed the prophet's voice and maybe he could remember how it was when he was young and i was thinking about that and i thought you know i can remember some of those days i remember when we first came this message 1969 over 50 years ago my mom and dad was getting some books my mom was getting them from her aunt sister lucy hester and so they decided to go to hardy arkansas get baptized well brother earl martin wasn't there at the time he was gone and so brother herbicide were baptized my mom and dad and so and i remember when you know we come and brother david we get together and then that all they talked about was the word of the lord that's all they talked about now i always remember this i'll remember i was about oh i forget 10 9 10 and when we first came in the message nine years old 1969 and i forget how about a year or so my mom was ordering some clothes out in the den and she goes david i'd be surprised if you see her 12th birthday that's just how close we thought it was and we lived that way we lived that way amen but today we're probably i remember we used to get the records amen first record the red record uh the great harlot and many of the messages that brother brown preached on and then i remember we'd get together my it didn't matter if they had to go to work the next day or what they'd stayed in fellowship talked about the goodness of the lord hey man like that song his goodness is running after me thank god amen i'm glad it's running after me amen oh what i have to worry for what i have to be sad for his goodness has always been there his goodness has always been with me he woke me up this morning he called me in my right mind because his goodness was falling after me [Music] thank you lord amen if i remember all these things we get together i remember one time we had brother cliff newman came by and stayed at our house just different ones how we talk about the lord how we get together playing tape on sunday morning because we didn't know hardly no ministers or not so we just get together somebody's house play tapes now maybe a young man nine years old 10 years old i thought this is kind of strange and if i hadn't prepared my heart to seek god i would still think it was strange amen thank god that i prepared my heart to seek after him i didn't have to wait for my dad or mom amen to do this because there's a lot of a lot of parents back then that they went off the deep end or they ain't serving god now but i thank god that i prepared my heart to seek after him he probably in rehoboam probably could remember these things he'd already could remember his dad solomon telling him the testimonies about his david how about how did he kill that bear and how did he kill that line how did he kill goliath he remembered how all this was but he forsook the word of god himself i wonder what do our children see in us it's been my life what do my children see in my life what do my grandkids see in my life amen oh they might not my grandkids they might not understand why we do some things but i want them to know that there's a living god that there's a reality in serving god there's a reality in getting your heart right with god there's a reality and get your heart prepared to seek after god he didn't prepare his heart and he forsook the word of god he even winked at the most horrible crimes when he ought to be ju when he ought to have judged them and found out what the will of the lord was to do about him oh ain't that about the way he is sometimes with us in this hour that we're living in because we didn't prepare our hearts to seek after god and we hear things we and we just wink at it well that's all right but god he don't weaken ignorance no more at one time he did we get ignorant but now he calls all men under repentance i'm saying lord help me then let me make sure that i'm right with you lord let me not wink at what anybody does but let me pray for him amen let me pray for him lord amen that's what i want to do lord let me let me if i have to judge let me do it according to your word lord what your word says not only that but he failed his father's sins in other words he started marrying all kinds of uh different women and all that and and and failing his father's sins he didn't he didn't see what had happened to his father the way the route that he took by living with about having so many wives but he took the wire out of his father because he didn't prepare his heart to seek after god and finally he visited himself with building and trying to make a name oh that's what we do sometimes we want to bend yourself in other things we're trying to make a name and try to make a name for ourselves and trying to instead of trying to please see what god has for me to do and then my actions and my life be pleasing to god oh that's what he did he began to busy himself with building trying to make a name but what about your worship toward god what about your attitude to god this morning my wife read me a quote the other day where a great preacher said it like this he said and then if if i get on your pet peeve i'm sorry but he said a lot of people may pay more attention to their dogs and cats than their own soul now if you've got a dog in the house or dogs i mean if there's farming country out here i understand all that but what about god what's more important than things that perish and i understand hey don't get me wrong i understand if you got a pet or a dog or whatever you need to take care of it you need to you need to treat it right you need to take care of it you need to feed it but what about your soul sometimes we sometimes we mess around with the trivial things amen how this should do and how this should be how this should go how this woman how this sister should guess how this brother should act and we forget about our own soul amen so what about our worship toward god no matter what anybody else does i'm going to serve the lord no matter what anybody else is doing i'm going to serve god i don't care if anybody quits i don't give the whole church quits i'm going to serve god joshua made this statement one time he said hey what are you going to do are you going to serve the gods that your father served on the other side of the flood are you going to serve the true living god he said you decide he said you're a decision he said for me and my house we're gonna serve god so that's what we gotta do we gotta make up in our minds god i don't care what anybody else does i'm gonna seek your face let my heart be prepared when i come to the house of god so i can seek your face lord let me make that decision that i don't care what anybody else does i'm going to serve you lord i don't care if everybody quits i'm going to serve you lord i don't care if this one gives up this one quits this one throws in the tile i'm going to serve you lord another thing the third thing he wasn't fixed and persevering and seeking the lord he didn't persevere though he might have tried amen i he might have been law for about three years and in that time he might have prospered and got all kinds of things you know got all that kind of things prospered himself did all kinds of things but i remember that that ritual that came to jesus when he ran up to him the bible says he ran you don't see too many people running today he said lord what must i do to be saved and the lord jesus quoted him the commandments defraud not honor thy father and mother don't lie don't bear false witnesses and so we find out in the scripture that this young man that came to jesus he must have been a pretty good boy because he said i've kept all this for my youth up i've done all these things i haven't uh i have i've honored my mom and dad i haven't lied i haven't done all these things i've kept all these commandments from my youth up but jesus been that god prophet looked in his life and said there's one thing that i likest you go and sell what you have and give to the poor and come and take up your cross and follow me and you'll have treasures in heaven he didn't see his treasures in heaven amen he did not prepare to seek god amen all he wanted he must have something must have attracted his attention though or he went and ran but when he found out what he had to do i don't know if the lord would held him to it or not reaction was what his action was going to be on the mission but all he said the scripture says that he bowed his head and walked away because about all these things lord i want to make heaven my home i want to seek your face lord i want to do what you told me to do lord i'll come and i'll sell everything i'll give to the poor i'll take up my cross because taking up the cross back then wasn't like hanging your cross in your rearview mirror today to take up your crossback then meant death to fall of christ meant death even i looked it out in history states at the romans when they before they executed their criminals they made them carry their own cross to be crucified on can you imagine made them the criminals carried their own that they were going to be crucified on especially if you called yourself a christian and said you was a follower of the lord jesus that meant death certain death his heart wasn't right he thought maybe the lord wouldn't ask him to do this you remember naaman in the bible that had leprosy and he got kind of mad when the man of god wouldn't come into the house he said surely if he was a man of god he'd come in here and maybe wave his magic wand over me and everything i'd be all right but all he said was go give him jordan seven times is it hey these other rivers around here better than the river jordan and that servant of his said hey listen master if he'd asked you to do some great thing you'd have done it all he asked you was gonna dip seven times in jordan finally got his heart right in his attitude right and his heart prepared if he had enough he would have never got well that leprosy if he tried to take a shortcut or whatever he would have never got well the story wouldn't end in the way that we know it but because he prepared his heart and got his attitude right he went down there and dipped seven times amen oh god help us this morning to get right have our hearts to be prepared lord hey man so maybe he that's reaborn for three years he might have been low and he prospered he gained all these things hey i understand that everything that i have comes from a god the the the job that i got it comes from god the strength that i got to go on the job it comes from god amen oh i never want to i never want to belittle my god this morning everything that i have my health this morning my strength all comes from him like i said me and you all were were recipients of miracles this morning these are miracles yes sir we woke up this morning clothed in our right mind there's a lot of people that didn't wake up this morning i wonder how they would god so he prospered did all that but he didn't have no stick it no stick to it in him no gumption in him didn't have what it took on the inside to keep pressing the battle can you imagine i wonder this morning about me and you sometimes i wonder about myself no i know brother homer sometimes he he calls he calls me up every now and then said did you hear that so-and-so passed on there's a people that's been his age and maybe he gets kind of worried about you know like when's it gonna be my time or whatever but you know what he don't give up he just keeps pressing on hey man when we see the things around us the way everything's going and people quitting the message and everybody's doing this and everybody doing that god let me have something in me that'll keep me pressing on when the prophet when he lost his baby little sharon rose lost his wife he could i could see my wife but my baby and he done something to him and i remember when sister margie passed away and i thought mom i never did see brother homer i had never seen brother homer like this before because he was always jolly always you know you know how brother homer is if you know him i never had seen him that way and he said every time he start to talk about it he'd just cry and cry and he'd have to apologize i said don't apologize brother homer i said i remember especially 1959 out there in los angeles california i guess the best one i guess that robin told his life story angela's temple los angeles california 1959 and that was the flood was in 37 that was 20 years later and it would became brother man said he just and he started crying at the last he said i can't go home no more he said he said there's something about it and said it seems so real like it was right there happening to him again and remember he went in there and he wanted to tell he wanted to take that took that glove off going to touch that high power line and said i'd just been a greasy spot took that pistol trying to that put it to his head trying to commit suicide wouldn't go out when he did it on the floor and it went off you remember going to that hospital brother the doctor sam and derek wanted to go down there but he went anyway said he blessed your flies from her eyes your eyes crossed he said oh god he began to pray saying it seemed like a black sheep just dropped down said he wouldn't hear my prayer and then that's when satan began to talk said all that you've done all the sick that you prayed for how you left this and then i done all this and now when it comes to your own baby he won't hear your prayer but remember i said yeah everything he was telling was the truth he said yeah i just never said something on the inside why because his heart was prepared god help me to be that way lord amen because if it ain't when something like that happens where'd you say i quit i give it up but brother bram said there's something on the inside about the size of your fingernail on the inside of the inside about the size of your little fingernail that hold hey man when that going gets rough and everything seems like it's falling apart that acre holds and grips that solid rock when they came to them and said billy did you hold your religion he said no it helped me hallelujah we got something that'll hold us hey man but he wasn't fixed this reborn wasn't fixed and persevering and seeking the lord he grew proud because of all that he had [Applause] and he forsook the lord back and forth back and forth back and forth and he stripped the lord's house to buy up the kings of egypt and then he'd get stirred for a little bit but then but then he didn't persevere oh i wondered this morning how many of us get stirred every now and then oh brother tom whoever made me with a message and we get started we say god help us but we don't have no perseverance in us we don't prepare our hearts and therefore we get stirred for a little bit but then we don't persevere and see it through what we need to do we need to be we need to make preparation shoot my woman she made preparation told her husband said listen and maybe her husband didn't see it just like she'd seen it at the time but she said hey this man of god by the name of like he comes by hitch every now and then let's make him a little house a little room that he can come when he's weary on his journey he can lay down an arrest and we'll fix him something to eat he can be rest from this journey maybe at that time her husband didn't see it like that but she began to make preparation her heart was prepared and when that happened to her boy out there in the field that day working with his father and died she went to her husband said settle me ass get one servants to settle me an ass said i'm going to the man of god so why it's neither new moon or sabbath so you don't even know where he's at she said all is well why because her heart was prepared she made preparation because there's a time when he made that when he made a promise her she said don't deceive me because she even had a child all these years she said don't deceive me and then when she when that baby was finally born and then he died out there my brother said probably about 10 11 years old working out in the field with the dead prey had a heat stroke she said i'm going it's neither new our husbands that's all right all is well back to the man of god amen and when the man of god he died you see her hey god's held it from me so there's a woman say i don't know what's wrong said i wonder if everything's all right so they said hey is everything all right with you is everything all is well hey man what preparation oh i hope today that we made preparation and we could say all is well all hell is breaking loose everything's going wrong but all is well all is well hallelujah number four honored maybe the lord with his lips but did jesus say you honor me with your lips but your heart's far from me i don't want to just come into the house of god or it may be it may be tomorrow i don't want to just honor him with my lips and my heart be far from him but i want my heart to be right there lord lord i just don't want to honor you and tell you i love you and just do that and know that the lord let my let my heart be near to you lord let me when i say lord i love you let him let me mean it lord let it come from way down deep in the bottle from the bottom of my soul praises unto thee lord he did not care whether he served the lord or not he just got to a place that he didn't care whether he served god or not whether he went to church or not oh i hope that we ain't in that place this morning that our hearts is not prepared and we don't care whether we serve the lord or not we don't care whether we come to the house of god or not see he didn't prepare his heart he wasn't made to service but he was just there see we could come this morning we could hear the singing we could hear brother david uh uh leading a singing we can hear all these things going on and we can be there maybe in our in our physical being but our hearts not there we can go through all the motion let's raise our hands when he says let's raise our hands we can say the same when he said turn the baits up we could all go there because we went to this service but when he was just there he didn't pray and seek the lord all this don't want to come to the service and just be there on a sunday morning as well it's sunday morning i just went to service because that's what i'm supposed to do no i want to come and see god's face and find out what he'd have for me the lord do you have a word for me this morning you have something that i can take back home with me this morning let's not come just to the house of god and just be there but let us come and pray and seek the lord and say brother tom don't know what i have need of but god if i can pray atmosphere and everybody can have that same kind of attitude speak through and then we can because there's been many times i remember for a testimony that there was one time that me and my wife we sit right there the the second roll from the front right in our churches just got two sections and we were sitting there and things were bothering her just things you know how it is sometimes you get nervous and things start bothering you she leans over to me and says david r just go home because i don't get nothing out of the service and she knew the things that were bothering her how many's ever been there and just things bother you and you this bothers you this per this bothers you nothing nothing big but just about and you say well i ain't never gonna get nothing out of the service well anyway brother homer gets up there and so this is on a sunday night now brother david i don't know if we went out to eat together you know lunch or whatever i can't remember but that's uh but i remember that was the first time i didn't if we did go out to eat that's the only time i seen him until he walked out there that night he came out there that sunday evening to preach he started preaching then all of a sudden he turns and starts going from direction my wife looked over at me because he named the things that she had just got to tell me 30 minutes before service started what was bothering her he began to name him and she looked over me and said did you talk to brother homer i said no that's the first time i've ever seen him since he this afternoon he could but god knew amen oh if our hearts are prepared amen he may make me leave my notes and go to your view just to speak to you this morning because he knows what you have need of hallelujah uh even about the lord's table he didn't have no self-examination he didn't examine himself to make sure that he didn't have no no all against anybody he didn't examine this we have to make sure that he was uh didn't have no ill feelings toward the pastor anybody he didn't just waited he didn't take time in fact he didn't even care about it hey man he didn't care about making his heart right he didn't care about but uh preparing being coming in and making preparation for the lord's table he didn't care about any of that help us lord what we got to do is number one first fill my need for god say lord i know i need you i need you not only today but i'll need you tomorrow amen and not only will i need you uh today uh right now in this service but when i start back home towards alabama i'll lead you lord to watch over me to protect me lord here some about a year or so ago man you know and we know we we hear about coving and all these things you know i ain't scared hey am i my wife that somebody said that she read or her sister told her that they heard or the doctor's medical signs saying that copen's here to stay this is another strain of it every year or whatever i said it may be here to stay but that don't mean i had to get it every time it comes around amen i don't have to get it i can put my trust in almighty god amen or you say well brother no i i we ain't exempt from them things but i think what we just can put our trust in the arms of god god will take care of us amen and so me my wife was fixing to go on a trip go to churches and and preach and everything so we went up there and asked brother homer said lord i told him said lord would you pray for us and we're fixing to go on this trip would you pray that god will keep us from any sickness keep us from any harm in danger amen i believe he done it amen i believe he still can do it amen now i know we are to take precautions i understand all these things where i wash our hands understand all these things i was taught to wash my hands when i was in kindergarten but i'm going to put my trust in almighty god so we first we're going to fill my need for god say god i need you and then we need to cry for help say god come on the scene and help me this morning and then we need to submit to his garden guidance say lord whatever you tell me to do that's what i'll be willing to do lord amen whether you lead me that's where i'll go lord amen oh hallelujah and then serve god with thoughtfulness saying god i thank you that you allow me to serve you this morning i thank you lord that you allow me to be here this morning i thank you lord that you saved me lord lord i thank you for leading me and guiding me now let me read a few quotes here this is what the prophet god said 1953 message called elijah he said heavenly father we come and approach to thee in the name of thy beloved son jesus to ask mercy and guidance that's what we come for that's mercy and guidance we don't know what to say and the audience is waiting but now has always supplied our needs thank god amen said wow lord we're coming we're anticipating we're waiting for you lord we need your guidance amen we're coming the audience is waiting and lord you've always supplied our needs and we know that you will according to the riches in glory when we look forward and see the end time approaching our hearts are leaping for joy that no after a while by and by these old frail bodies will be changed and made like in his own glorious body we forget things sometimes we can't remember sometimes we have aches and pains i remember when i was younger you just get out and play basketball or volleyball with young people you get up the next morning oh where did that pay oh yeah played volleyball yesterday but now you get up and you hurt this joint hurts your neck hurts your back hurts your legs hurt he's like what's wrong well what happened your joints and your nerves and your tendons all got together and said we ain't tormented him in a long time we need to have a little revival in his body oh but i'm looking forward to that glorious body amen well that never bothered me no more no more heartache no more pain so we said was made like his own glory's body we shall see him as it is we'll never pray for each other no more there'll never be no more sick no more old and gray and crippled in sickness hospitals they'll have no need no more undertakers no more funeral possessions but then we'll be like christ live as sons of god and reign for eternity with that time lord prepare our hearts and let us give call to this day and night and i'll be silent that god's great message might wake the people from sin to righteousness for we asked it in jesus name amen oh he said no more sickness no more sin no more problems he said but until then let us prepare our hearts and get called to this great day and night that will awaken the people to the fact that it's almost over with that they got to get their act together hallelujah again 1958 watchmen what of the night he said look you who watch television you who listen to radio you who read your news you who like to hear the news and you once the morning cometh and the night's coming also the morning is coming for those who are ready for the morning and the night is coming for those who are not prepared for that morning he said we look at the news we see our newspapers we listen and we wonder what all this is about he said it's coming he said the morning's coming and the night's coming the morning's coming for those who are ready god help us let me prepare my heart and the night is coming for those who are not prepared for the morning then he goes may god prepare hearts today for the morning shall break eternal bride and fair and as the poet said his chosen one shall get into their homes beyond the sky when the road under i'll be there again 1958 queen of shiva he said thank you brother joseph he said let's just remain standing now i'm willing for prayer lord we want to thank you for your goodness and for sparing our lives and for the privilege that we have of coming to thee on this cold winter night knowing that we are just the dust of the earth but inside us is a spirit that lives forever that tonight that you'll forgive us of our shortcomings and let us prepare our hearts to meet thee in that day these little brittle threads that we're awakened that he said he said forgive us of our shortcomings let us prepare our hearts to meet thee in that day these little brittle threads that we're walking on called the threads of life we don't know just what time they may break and plunge us into eternity but as david of old said evil for they are with me if we go through the valley of the shadow of death you'll or you're sure to meet us keep us in perfect peace lord as our hearts are stayed on you heal the sick and the afflicted get glory out of the service and he goes on he said god thank you lord prepare our hearts lord and these little frail bodies lord these little uh little brutal threats that we're walking off called the threads of life so we don't know just what time it's going to be who would ever dream brother david that some of these people that's been going on that here today would stand here 2022 i mean i could you know name you know everybody that i would have never dreamed but here we are 1961 the easter seal listen what he says we would ask lord that you bless the one now that's undertaken to explain thy word of the resurrection god bless all the men your servants throughout the land throughout the world and come lord jesus quick because we see clouds floating in the air lord and we know that there is a great moving up gird up your people oh my baby take the sword of the truth pull down the helmet take the of faith and move forward grant it lord for we are for lo or for war clouds are hanging low bless us today now for we know that soon as we know we'll we'll see comes may we prepare our hearts and finish that settle it once and for all i wonder if we can do that sell it once and for all amen oh you may conduct your conduct may be so pious and everything and you know you may be that you you you your conduct may be okay you may be at the house of god you you might say hey well you know you're a message believer or i'm a christian because hey listen i got the books i got this and i got that and i go to a message church but that don't make me christian just because you say you believe in uh uh brother branham that don't make you a believer or a christian oh you say well look at my conduit look at all this and all this but you never prepared your heart you never prepared your heart to seek the lord what will you need to do we need to be born again i wonder do you try to serve god do i try to serve god do you try to serve god all like i said your conduct may be all right you may say yes ma'am and no ma'am you may be ever so pious but just because you come in this church don't make you a christian just because you pack a message book and a bible on your arm that don't make you a christian i wonder this morning do you even try to serve god have you prepared your heart did you prepare your heart before you came into the service this morning man maybe you knew your pastor was gonna be gone and you knew somebody was gonna be preaching instead of him he said well i wonder if i should go i wonder what he's got to say or did you prepare your heart say god i know brother tommy there but whoever you got lord would you speak to me through your word will you speak to me do you even try to serve god or is all of it on the outside it's just on the outside you dress right you walk right you may talk the message lingo you may have a bunch of christian cliches that you say but what about on the inside down on the inside of the inside and closing there's a preacher one time but before he was a preacher he's a little boy a little lad i forget how old he was and his dad always asked him or told him said man you ought to be like this other boy over here said look what he's doing he said look he's in church every sunday he's singing in the choir he's doing all this he said you need to be like him he said look he's even going to school trying to get a good education trying to make something out of his life and finally when that boy came back home and he'd seen him and he knew his dad always looked up to that boy said you ought to be like him but you know what when that boy got back into town he got around the wrong crowd and hanging around the wrong environment and he he even stole from the church and all these things and so that boy that man's son came to realize said you know what my dad always wanted to be like him look up to him the way he did the way he acted the way he went to church and just put on the act but his heart was never prepared and so when we got with the wrong crowd the wrong environment he lost it all and so he finally came to the conclusion said i don't want to be like anybody but i want to be like my heavenly father that's what i want to be like this morning i don't want to be like anybody i don't want to preach like anybody else i just want to be like him is that your prayer i stand this morning our hearts not prepared i hope they are this morning with our head bound our eyes closed wondered this morning maybe this was kind of different this morning the way that we brought it out but the lord knows if you're here this morning maybe you didn't come with your heart prepared this morning you thought you know what i'll just go and maybe you know i i i won't enter in and i won't do none of this but i'll just set back and maybe if he says something that it disturbed me or whatever no i just don't want to be stirred and not do nothing about it i don't want to just go through the motions or whatever but every service that i attend i want my heart to be prepared for what god has got for me and i don't want to be like anybody else but i want to be like him i want that your prayer this morning and god bless that hand that hand god sees that hand let's just pray heavenly father lord jesus we love you this morning and lord sometimes we come and our hearts are not prepared lord and therefore we don't receive anything and we walk out these doors and we wonder what was the matter with brother tom or brother david or or what was the matter with brother homer or something no maybe what was the matter what's up us that our hearts wasn't prepared and therefore we didn't get nothing from the service lord let us not be like that this morning but lord from this day on every service that we come to lord [Music] don't let the song leader let us not let the songwriter just sing but let us get behind him and worship you worship the lord with him may we not let the preacher just be preaching to the choir as they say but lord let your words speak to us because our hearts are prepared to receive from you lord [Music] they're prepared to seek your face lord and father don't matter [Music] this person is or what that person is though they may be good examples lord and they may be good christians no doubt lord [Music] they may worship you in every service that they attend [Music] and they may do all these things lord but father i want to be like you lord jesus [Music] because you didn't call me to be like that person you didn't call me to be like brother homer you didn't call me to be like brother tom byler but you caught me to be like you father so lord i hope my heart's prepared this morning lord that these words lord meant something this morning lord that i won't be like rehoboam lord that when the son of my life is over and they right over there he did evil in the sight of this of the lord because his heart was not prepared lord let it not be like that lord but may it be like this lord all he wanted was to be like you great lord you saw the hands this morning you know what was behind each and every hand before it was raised lord i pray lord that you'd help each and every one every young person in this building this morning every child every mom every dad every elderly person because lord like the prophet said these little brutal threads that we call the threads of life we don't know when it all be over with lord and you call us home may we be ready lord may we keep pressing the battle granite lord be with each and every one this morning lord be with their pastors he's up there in indiana preaching lord this morning be with our pastor lord just be with your bride around the world lord and help us lord from this day forward to be more like you we love you and we appreciate you in jesus name let's sing it to like jesus [Applause] to be like jesus [Music] all through our [Music] yes lord [Music] i'm gonna turn it back before we do as we as i turn it back and we're saying that again if anybody needs your prayer we'll be glad to pray with you goodbye sickness prayer we'd be glad to pray for you amen let's sing it again to be like jesus [Music] to be like [Music] [Music] glory i only asked to be like he just to walk like jesus oh just to walk like jesus just to walk like jesus on earth i [Music] all through life's journey [Music] to be like and lord prepare me to be a sanctuary [Applause] [Music] [Music] tried and true [Music] living sanctuary [Music] for you is that your heart's desire once again oh
