tonight good to see everybody out amen praise the lord that'll be all thank you amen appreciate the lord and for his goodness amen and so we want to give a little uh a little report before we get into the message this evening um brother steve langley i he came here this evening uh but he said that sister becky got a text just a few minutes ago that her co-worker had went in she had the sniffles i guess and the cold like symptoms and stuff so she went in and got tested she tested positive for the cobot so that puts brother steven's sister becky pretty much in quarantine for a couple weeks so it's getting pretty close so uh i've got i prayed about it today and i was just kind of trying to feeling the leading the lord and um i thought well maybe we should just have a virtual service tonight you know and so but i didn't i says well we'll have a service tonight and then we'll go from there but uh after brother steve saying that i kind of wondered whether you know i said but anyway so no i think you know uh i know different ones we've got brother brad in them i've got brothers sister hannah and them um you know that are working directly with the patients and everything so it's getting real close if we ever did dismiss services or anything now would be a time amen but i don't want to necessarily dismiss the services but after next week next wednesday and everybody listening on the internet next wednesday we will not have service because i plan on i've wanted to go see brother jewel for a while so i'm going to make a trip down there and see whether jewel probably next week providing they don't have no code right around there but uh anyway so and then after that so there'll be no serve wednesday of service next week but after that and we'll let you know next sunday because this is the kind of thing you just have to kind of play by ear and that's what i've been kind of doing but i think we're at the place to where you know if uh it's okay with everybody on a wednesday night for the next little bit we'll just do the uh the internet service okay so that'll cut our services in half uh but yet we'll have be able to have some kind of service on wednesday because a lot of these a lot of our people is already on on the quarantine and all and so i think that would be a good way to go amen i know when it first went around i disap agreed with it and i wanted to barge on you know and because if you have two or three people or two three thousand in the state of kentucky you know that's not really any reason to cut things back or watch yourself too much but right now as you know it's it's it's out there amen and so is that okay with everybody we'll just plan on doing that we'll uh not have a service next wednesday and then after that we'll go virtual unless i tell you different that's only on a wednesday we will have sunday morning service here okay but again i want to tell anybody if you know you've been in contact with anybody uh be please be courteous it'll be all right the lord will understand if you just stay away a little bit amen you don't want to spread it amen so praise the lord so is that all right all right sounds like a plan so all right let's bow our heads and uh oh another one more thing i don't know the exact uh details yet because we haven't got all the results back but we did get a really good report from sister jeanette and what they found amanda and they didn't say they had found cancer or anything or even that tumor said that there was not that thing down there but she does have a i believe she called it a hernia a hernia that isn't that right that has to be operated on or has to be taken care of but they do have some other stomach lining tests that they've sent vanderbilt i believe to get tests and find out what that is or what they are but uh i mean it's looking good right now so praise the lord amen and so we're rejoicing for that amen and we certainly are praying for sister susan that the lord will just do a miracle for her amen because he is a miracle working god amen everybody doing good good glad to hear it amen so god bless you tonight just have a little thought amen this evening for just a little bit so let's bow our heads be go before the lord kind heavenly father we come before you lord jesus we ask god once again as we meet two or three people that gathered in your name we believe lord jesus that you'll meet in our midst father and that you'll come and that you are here lord and we just pray father that you would give me the ability that's only by the holy spirit to speak to your people to feed them from the word of life we ask god for a special protection for sister becky lord as lord she's been right close to a co-worker father that's had the virus lord you know lord jesus some get it extreme some not extreme that's all in your hands as your prophet has said that all of those things are in your hands lord but we ask god for protection for sister becky and brother steve we ask that you just be with them in a special way father and lord and the others working at the nursing home each one father we ask god you continue to protect them we thank you lord jesus for watching over them so far and we believe that you will continue to do so lord and we just ask god that you just continue to lead us and guide us by your spirit father lord until lord we get to leave this pest house of the world father and we thank you goodness and your mercy we can't tell you how much we love you how great a god you are and as we've heard the prophet say today there's no words in the english vocabulary how do we conform words to express how much we really we just want you to know we really appreciate you father and we ask now father that you just take the words lord jesus i feel you've laid upon my heart to speak on and bless it to somebody's soul father in jesus name amen and amen all right if you will turn to the book of matthew and i will just start with the scripture that i was reading today amen when something kind of struck my heart amen and i begin to just go from there so we want to do a little bible study on what i call secret places secret places amen how many know that god is a secret god amen he is hardly ever seen amen he's hid he hides himself amen and he hides himself in different places and different things we want to look at that and and also tonight's focus is going to be on our hearts and what we are in our secret places amen so in matthew 6 if you want to with me uh i was going to read the whole chapter but i'll probably come back and pick up a few of the scriptures that were spoken of beforehand beforehand here from 1 chapter 6 of matthew 1 to 4 but we'll start on verse 5. when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily verily i say or very i say unto you they have their reward but when but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou has shut thy door all right here you are in a secret place pray to thy father which is in secret amen so he is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly but when thou but when you pray use not vain repetitions as they heathen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask him after this man i therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we as we forgive our debtors lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen notice how jesus picks up on verse 12 for the next verse he says and forgive us of our debts as we forgive our debtors then he talks about being led in temptation delivering for people but he picks it back up in verse 14 for if you forgive not forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you forgive not mend their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses moreover when you fast be not as the hypocrites of a sad countenance for they disfigure their faces that they may appear unto men the fast verily i say unto you they have their reward but thou went thou fast this anoint thy head and wash thy face that thou appear not unto men to fast but unto thy father which is in secret notice there it says it again your father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall lay shall reward thee openly amen reward thee openly may god add his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this evening amen praise the lord no wonder they could in the old testament just read the scrolls and it would get people excited amen how many knows that sometimes just by the reading of the scrolls and the reading of the word the people would get inspired and they would really go to worshiping the lord amen because we know that when i'm speaking well you might have a question about it but when you're reading the word there's absolutely no question am i right it is absolutely the truth you can absolutely count on it so praise the lord for that so i want to look at this for just a minute it talks about how that first of all he's talking about prayer he talks about uh fasting isn't that right he talks about fasting and in verse one he also talks about doing alms talks about several things that he tells us to do in secret because our heavenly father amen he is in a secret place amen there's something about those places those getaway places amen i believe it's where we get molded it's where we get shaped it it is um a molding place you know because most of the time a lot of times if you aren't careful as a preacher amen you'll preach to please the people or you'll be in the public and you'll do it for perhaps whatever reason you know the wrong reason same as if you would ask a person to come up here and pray well most of the time all of us know that person will probably try to pray our good prayer because he's in front of everybody right and everybody's hearing him and so you know sometimes we get that in our mind and automatically you know you get into the mode of you know let me pray a prayer you know maybe that's impressive it's our human nature let me know it's a really prayer prayer that's not not what we're to do brother branham even told us how to pray amen remember he says when you get up i'm not sure if it was in front of the people there in a church might have been what he was talking about in church maybe in church order conduct order and doctrine some of y'all might notice remember this more than me but he just specified he says when you get up when you pray for something especially for your food or whatever don't pray for the governor of the satan for this and that yeah i mean are you with me tonight oh y'all remember that says you know because you don't don't you know you can do that in your closet you know come up and ask the blessing upon the service and this out of the other the needs whatever it is you know you know but it isn't about being drawn out so how many realizes tonight that god doesn't like put on he don't like you know you don't like uh you know uh somebody that's putting on a show he wasn't one to put on a show the prophet of god never put on a show he was all just he was always himself and i'll tell you what any preacher or anybody that really if you're going to be a christian the best the way that's the way to be the your best is to be yourself just be what god made you it isn't about great swelling words it's not about long prayers or you know you know and most of the time you find that people that are like that have pride huh there's pride in there you know and pride really disfigures you you know it just makes you look like a fool a lot of times but i don't do nothing for you humility does i mean god dwells in humility he hides himself in simplicity hides himself in humility hides himself in the secret place he says when you pray you know don't go out there in the streets like the pharisees did the pharisees the hypocrites they went out there and then maybe a bigger be the big drum says everybody we're gonna pray now not in heaven we prayed ideal just get everybody to repent and turn from their wicked ways well maybe you need to turn from your we get way of being an immigrant you know and it's just all hypocrisy it's all just a show and so you know that's what they were doing that's what jesus said they do you know and he says you know whatever you put on a show whenever you do that artificially you got your reward you know and you know how does it say it says i tell you they have their reward and he says that you're that's not even going to give him a reward over there so it's the thing that we do in secret that god sees and so i guess if i was to make a statement tonight it would be you are what you are in your secret place when you're all by yourself nobody else around huh you are what you are at that time you're as strong as you are at that time that's when god's looking because how many knows god never quits looking amen maybe when you do something bad he will but listen he always sees what you do amen there's nothing hidden from god and he loves you know and i might say that god might hear prayers that are said out loud but he especially hears prayers that are even prayed quietly huh because we know that he knows the thoughts of our mind you know he said right there he says you know don't use vain repetition you know and i remember i we always used vain repetition at home the amish there some of the worst for using vain revenue we have a prayer book and my dad and it was always nice i don't care if it's even repetition it's always good to get on your knees and my mom and dad and we'd always have a habit of getting on our knees in the evening and in the morning and dad would read out of the prayer book and it'd be a long prayer um children forgave him and sinners on and on and on and on and it was all german high german you know and i did it's a prayer you know at least you're praying but don't do a good when you do that same one every morning same one every evening and he says don't be written and the prophet even taught us you know what he told us he's not like the catholics that have a repetitious and always reputation but he's brother brahm taught us he says when you pray pray from down here you ain't fully god everybody knows your heart he already knows what you have need of amen so just be real amen i like this because he says listen pray you know in your closet one place it says enter into thy closet amen and you ain't even got to tell anybody you go into the closet just get away somewhere brother venom how many knows brother branham had his secret place called the cave and he would go there and that was his secret place nobody could ever find it and when he went to talk to the lord he'd go spend a day or two let's just soak that in real good brother jeff wouldn't it be nice if we'd say hey i'm gonna be gone for two days you know you won't see me don't never mind where i'm going i'm just gonna be gone you gotta know what i'm doing but i'm going to pray you know just go talk to the lord for a day or two how many believes you do it's good you do is real good i believe you get further with god if you take more time and pray because you know sometimes you know you go and you pray like that and sometimes it'd be a long time before the lord had even come or the angel lord come to brother madam how many believe you ought to have your secret place you ought to have your secret place same as the family altar brother bam says you ought to have your family altar you got to have in the mornings you have your time of prayer and so forth your family other you all have that you ought to have your own secret place in your own secret time that you go with the lord because that's what god is looking for he's looking for the sincerity of our hearts he's looking for how real we are amen in our places of quiet in places of what we call our time me time or rather let that be time that you spent with god and i tell you what you'll be a better person you'll be a better christian because that's where you draw your resources how many believes that that's like you know uh to draw your resources that's where you get your power from it's your prayer life it's your communion life with god it's that secret place god loves secret places amen god made himself so mysterious until guess what even him and his existence was a mystery to people for thousands of years his very being was a mystery to people because he hid himself huh i mean i was about even jesus said talking about revelation says you know i thank thee father for you have hid thee things from the eyes of the wise and prebuden and then revealed unto babes such as would learn the mystery of godliness the mystery of christ all of those things that things even god himself hides himself so now let's look talking about prayer he says you know if you go in there and you pray you ask god some for something he says notice your father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall rework thee openly amen i believe that's when you're really getting somewhere amen nobody knows just you and him all alone by yourself praying of course we know it doesn't hurt other believers around you have a prayer meeting pray god will hear all that sure but some of the most special times according to the scripture is when you are by yourself alone somewhere and you have a talk with god talk it over with him and then watch god answer you not privately but answer you openly praise the lord because you know how many knows there is absolutely nothing hidden from god over in matthew 10 and verse 25 he was talking about it says it is enough for his disciple for the disciple to be as his master and the servant as his lord if they have called the master of the house be aldebar how much more shall they call them of his household fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and hid all right there's nothing here that shall not be made known huh so how many knows that nobody is hiding anything from god no you know even job how many knows that job was accused of being a secret sinner a secret sinner now he believes that probably a lot of those in the world there's a lot of people that claim to be christians but secretly they're sinners huh maybe nobody ever knows about maybe never even finds out about it but god knows you're not fooling god and they'll accuse you because of all the troubles that he had on him amen because of all the bad things that happened to him his friends said hey you know joe you got to have some secrets in somewhere that's why this curse is on you because it looked like a curse right it looked like it i'm the powerful hand of almighty god correcting job but no job knew in his heart right he knew in his heart that he had made sacrifice that he had made prayer that he had done everything that god had required and perhaps more because he would make sacrifices for his children just in case they sin i hope every one of us as parents do that for our children huh if my children lord have sinned please forgive them lord that's making a sacrifice for your children say god forgive them draw them closer to you lord ask for your sin ask for the sins of your son or your daughters or whoever it is make sacrifice for because we want everything clear you know right but job is accused of being a secret sinner but come to find out he wasn't amen it was just that god had a lot of confidence in job amen all right so he says there's nothing hidden that isn't going to be made known and so forth all right let's look at chapter six again a little bit further can we so it says on down it talks about that when you fast amen don't do like the hypocrites he says they actually disfigure their faces wow i don't know what this figure perhaps put sackcloths in the ashes maybe they'll just put ash all over them you know and ruffle their hair all up and just you know see if everybody's looking yeah right well that's what he said they do it for a show they make themselves look like they're oh they're pious huh they're so pious they're so religious but yet they do it they've been seeing a man jesus says no no no no anoint your help your head with oil isn't that right and and smell good huh don't smell like a skunk don't look like a hideous heinous whatever you know by disfiguring your face and looking hideous no but look good look clean you know and don't even let them know you're doing the fast hey brother sister no i can't eat this oh you just lost your reward because you done wanted somebody that well yay brother yay you're awesome you're really wonderful great for you hey you had your reward god says forget it that's not what i'm looking for secretly in your heart to do it for the lord how many believes the lord really really likes it when you do things secretly that nobody else knows about it for him do it for the lord as unto the lord secretly and not for show and not for wanting to be popular or whatever it might be god really likes that how many believe that you can't do anything for the lord that he don't see that he doesn't really appreciate praise the lord so he says they disfigure their faces barely i say unto you they have that their reward but when thou fast anoint on head with oil and wash thy face that thou appear not unto men to fast in other words they can't notice it but unto thy father which is in secret how many believes that that's where god's supposed to be is down in that secret place of the heart right there he's in that secret place a quiet place that's where god is amen and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly praise be to god amen so we see that god is a god that is in secret he dwells in secret place amen in a secret place he is hid god is hid even to the world today you know that he is hid and let me just say this that actually god is hid to everyone that he hasn't revealed himself to huh because as i was saying sunday like like jesus said about peter he says flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you am i right so whenever god begins to show himself he dwells in secret let's follow on that for a little bit god dwells in secret he dwells in places that people don't even recognize that he is but god dwells somehow how maybe god dwells somewhere sure he does but as i was saying he said to peter his flesh and blood has not revealed this to you and moses had a mother that taught him the bible every day he had a mother that would teach him everything about the bible but he didn't have a personal revelation of it did he because his mama was flesh and blood revealing it to him and that right flesh and blood teaching it to him but he needed something more than that am i right sure he needed something more than that and on the back side of the desert brother man said he learned more in five minutes time in the presence of god then he had learned all down in the down his whole life he learned more right there because why revealed himself to him amen moses got a hold of something that he could never be stopped after amen that's just like amen a person that perhaps is raised in a message and you hear it and you hear it you hear about salvation you hear about the new birth you hear about the infilling of the holy ghost but if you ever experience it huh it's no more mama's experience that is experienced it's yours experience it's god making himself known to you and that's where brother brahm said that even the new birth is a revelation how many knows that even the new birth is a revelation god revealing himself to you and he said that's faith faith is a revelation amen because when he reveals him tell you it absolutely builds your faith to know that god is real praise the lord so we see you in acts in the book of acts i'm just going to read something here talking about how did god for how many knows that god for about 4 000 years he was very mysterious to people very mysterious god they see him in the pillar of fire they seen him by a cloud by the day pillar of fire at night moses heard him talking out of the bush and so forth but they really wondered who this was and even even the disciples it was a mystery god was even a mystery to the disciples while jesus was walking with him amen and i want to pick that up here in a minute about the greeks that came and wanted to see jesus and they want to see him but in acts 17 i want to read you where these and like some of these words i can't pronounce so i'm going to try the best i can act 17 let's do a little reading here let me talk about paul at athens in verse 16 now while paul waited for them at athens 17 chapter 17 verse 16. now paul waited for them at athens his spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city holy give it holy give it to idolatry therefore disputed here in the synagogue with the jews and with the devout persons and in the market daily with them that met with him then certain philosophers of the epicreans and of the s stocks encountered him and some said what will this babbler say others some he seemeth to be of some said or fourth of strange gods because he preaches unto them jesus and the resurrection and they took him and brought him unto araga arapagas saying may we know what this new doctrine whereof thou speakest is for that bring us certain strange things to our ears and we know we would know thereof what these things mean notice the parentheses in verse 21 for all the our athens and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else but to either tell or hear some new thing then paul stood in the midst of mars hill and said you men of athens i perceive that all things in all things you are too superstitious for as i passed by i beheld your devotions and i found an altar with this inscription to the unknown god see that's about as much as the people knew about god a new to god somewhere but he's unknown he's a mystery they still don't know who he is what he is what he's like amen whom therefore he ignorantly him declare i am to you in other words let me show you who this unknown mysterious hidden god is amen praise the lord i mean aren't you glad that through jesus christ we can know who god really is amen because he was perfectly expressed in jesus so he says now notice god that made the world and all the things therein seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands neither is worship with men's hands as though he needed anything seeing that he giveth to all life and breath and all things praise the lord i like that the lord of heavens and earth amen notice he describes him as the creator and all things that have made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and has determined the times before appointed predestination and the bounds of the habitation sometimes paul will use great wisdom in the way that he brings it before the people that they should seek the lord if haply they might feel after him and find him amen how many knows the lord wants you to find him he wants you to seek for him and to look for him amen isn't that what we do a lot of times in prayer that's what brother bam says i'm going out to the lord i'm seeking the lord and and i'm going to go out there and just pray and pray until the lord comes you know he was seeking the lord amen and find him though he be not far from every one of us for in him we live and move and have our being let's all read that together for in him we live and move and have our being how many believes that's really being in god in him we live we move we have our being as certain also of our own poets have said for we are also his offspring for as much then as ye are the offsprings of god we ought not to think that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone graven by art and man's devices tell them to get rid of their idolatry and the times of this ignorance god winked at but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent i like that that was paul preaching there at athens saying man right now he's calling on all of you to repent just like what um jonah did at nineveh told him to repent or perish here paul is saying it's now time god's calling you all to repent this unknown god that y'all don't know really who is i'm telling you who he is because he had the point of today into which notice he talks about judgment brings judgment judgment day because he has appointed a day into which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained doesn't really come out and say jesus yet does he by the man whom he has ordained whereof he has given assurance unto all men in that he has raised him from the dead that's right he's been preaching that jesus god raised christ from the dead wrote you so he's saying this is your assurance that he's going to judge the world by jesus christ the one that he has raised from the dead and he has given the assurance of it because he raised him from the dead and when they heard heard of the resurrection of the dead yeah some mocked and others said we will hear thee again of this matter some of them stayed with him and the others departed that was his message to them people right there amen how many knows a plan of god it was also hidden amen and you and i see more of it know more of it than anybody has in any other generation huh because those seven hidden mysteries have been revealed the plan of god is a secret it's been a secret from the foundation of the world it was a secret and even though paul brings out something here that i want to read over in if you go with me in uh let me see which one i want to read first let's go to ephesians 3. ephesians 3 what i want to my thought on this is that god is making everything known through not the political world not necessarily the denominational church world but the manifold wisdom of god is made known by and through the church amen all right let's um let's start with verse 1. for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles if you have heard of the dispensation of grace of god which is given to me to you words in other words if you've heard my story of the grace that god showed me on the damascus road all right how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery where as i wrote before in few words told him a little bit about before whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gentiles and he was letting them know that hey the gentiles are part of this too how many is happy for that tonight because you and i are a gentile we are born gentiles but john we'd be having clubs on our back according to the probably god long-haired clubs on our back beating each other up you know just a bunch of heathens either worshiping huh isn't it something that you know in the old testament and and you know how did he he had chosen israel right he had chosen that was his chosen nation and everybody else was gentiles they were all heathens but god chose that little thing but after the death of christ he opened it up for all of mankind amen i'm thankful for that tonight aren't you if god had mercy on whosoever will let him come amen so god loves all humanity not just the jews but all of humanity he loves amen thank you lord amen thank you lord all right so now let's look at this that the gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body whereof i was made administered according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me who am less than the leaked of all saints how many knows paul had the right spirit he didn't think he was better than everybody else he called himself the least of all saints and yet in that time we all know he was the greatest and there i wrote almost the whole new testament amen he was above peter because he put peter in his place amen all right and lisa to say is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make all men to see what is the fellowship of the mystery in other words that you could look behind and that you could see what was hidden before which from the beginning of the world has been hid in god amen hidden god who created all things by jesus christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of god praise the lord hallelujah people have a hard time identifying themselves who they are where they belong who they want to be the unveiling of god at the end of it brother bam talks about how that the unbeliever doesn't see what where god is veiled they make fun of us and so forth they make fun of the sisters long-haired brothers the way they do and so forth but they're failing to see where god is veiled but you know when i was reading this when i thought about this how that all the mysteries of god all the hidden things of god has been made known not by the us government not by the king of england but by the church of the living god amen how many is thankful to know the manifold wisdom of god whether it's the godhead whether it's serpent seed whether it's predestination whether it's whether your name is on the book or not and so forth all those mysteries have all been made known by the church it's not hidden anymore not here anymore god has made it known it's something that he would hide it for as long as what he did now paul talking here you know he talked about how the gentiles would come in now let me look at another one but let me uh uh let me read this here's quote before i go into my last scripture of the night because people have always wanted to see god even the disciples wondered who this father was isn't that right and then brother bam talked about the greeks that wanted to see him all right they wanted to see god and they came to jesus and he says now notice the very words that jesus reported back to them all right philip and the other ones they got stirred up listen these people they got stirred up they were very i wanted to go into all of that but it was people that were the greeks and so forth they did a lot of studying they had a lot of uh teaching and all of that stuff all the modern stuff but they were had something in their heart stirred because they had heard about jesus and the miracles that he was doing so they wanted to go see him and when they come to jesus he reported back to them for they come to see who he was and they could not see him he says they seem to form huh i mean they looked at jesus they looked at his body they seemed to form but he was in his temple god was in his temple and he was veiled in human flesh in other words he was hid in the human flesh and he tells these greeks what does he say he says unless a corn of fall in the ground it abideth alone now i'd be uh to be totally honest with you i don't believe them greeks had a clue what this man was talking about a corn of wheat falling in the grind and abiding alone huh probably in their mind it was well yeah we're pretty smart we know that hey you got to put a piece of corn in the ground or it'll abide by itself and then it'll bring forth yeah we know that much but they didn't get the true picture of what christ was saying in other words he was saying if you really want to see me here's your parable amen all right let me go on here's your parable and die it abides alone and the hour is come and it will soon be that the son of man will be glorified and he must pass from this earth and except this hour comes you'll never be able to see it amen here why they couldn't understand they couldn't why why he couldn't couldn't to see jesus because he was masked god was masked the greeks wanted to see a god and here he was but they couldn't see him because he was because of the veil but the man says that's the same thing today they can't see him because of the veil it's over their face those greeks were masked or jesus was masked to those greece he said except the corner of wheat fall in the ground it abides alone they couldn't understand how why they couldn't see him they stood there stood a man they come to see god and they seen a man they couldn't see god but god was veiled to them now keep that in your mind god was veiled in a man they could say man no man can do the works except to be of god nobody can do it their sins are man and yet the works were manifested see but they couldn't understand that god was will listen he says he's veiled brother brahm says now he's veiled in a man he as he always was veiled but god was veiled to them he was in his human temple god was in a human temple now be very careful because he's the same yesterday today and forever how many knows that when you listen to the unnailing of god there is nothing [Music] blessed and began veil in human flesh manifesting himself and all they seen was a kentuckian a hillbilly that's all they saw most people but there was so much more because god was veiled in the man amen how many believe that we got to be careful that you don't miss god because you do not see him in the temple that he failed in amen you got to watch what you do how many knows you got to watch how you treat each other because god is in his temple i mean god is in his temple and everybody that has the holy ghost is his temple amen praise the lord the world don't see it and as i was saying a while ago never finished my thought talking about people not wanting and not knowing who they are and what they are i tell you what right now if you know that you're a son of god and this has been revealed to you and showed to you god has made himself known to you you're the most blessed person on the face of the earth there's no greater honor that you can have no greater honor can be bestowed upon you for you to believe that you're a son and daughter of god and this that you are part of the plan of god amen not the bad part so it's not not not not what's predestinated you know uh unto wrath because there's that's that too but you're predestinated to be a son and daughter of god folks i'm telling you what there's no reproach that i won't take there's nothing that i wouldn't do just to be identified with that amen praise the lord but anyway so listen though he says now notice how many knows it was the way that they treated the lord so i got wrote down here watch how you treat each other amen as you have done unto the least of these you have done unto me how many believes that as you do a child of god i believe that's where the squeeze comes i believe that's where the trick is and recognizing that god is still in human flesh in each other amen and if you have the holy spirit you'll be careful amen to always it may treat each other right amen okay so now notice he says god is always veiled amen today and forever god hiding himself in simplicity yet hiding himself from the world yet he was veiled to the world but those around him that were predestinated could see but as he says notice the greek says we would see jesus and he says a corner of wheat has to die and fall you have to die to your own ideas you have to get out of your own thoughts like those disciples they couldn't explain about eating the flesh and blood of the son of god but they were convinced that he was the son of the living god amen so he says listen he has to die we realize that jesus had to die is that right because when he died on the day of pentecost many more he wasn't alone anymore if you really wanted to see jesus it was when he was in his body amen doing the same works he did before praise the lord how many believes that jesus christ the son of god is a secret place the holy ghost is a secret place if you and i are living in a secret place and that secret place is christ amen one more scripture in closing in colossians actually i apologize for that there's two more let me finish this other one paul says in colossians 3 and verse 26 even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of his glory in this mystery among the gentiles the mystery is christ in you the hope of glory amen christ is veiled he's hid in the secret place of your heart and my heart amen in colossians 3 in verse 1 if you then be risen with christ seek those things which are from above where christ sitteth at the right hand god set your affections on things above and not on things on earth for ye are dead here's the quote scripture i want to get to for ye are dead and your life is hidden with christ in god remember one place brother bam talking of the intervale the holies of holies he talked about how that when christ died that veil was rent nobody could go back in that secret place but now every believer is to go back there behind that veil when you get in behind that veil and you're in christ he says the world comes shut off to you amen you don't hear the sounds of all over the world anymore you're any kind of glory in that secret hidden place amen and even the bible says that if you are a new creature and so forth he says that you are dead and your life is hid with christ in god now how many knows that in only the way the holy spirit is what covers us it's what hises is the holy ghost amen because the life it says that you're dead how many knows that i can think of the stuff i used to do all the things i used to do i'm not going to mention them but it wasn't good you know but you know all of those things are covered and i i don't you know the only the only way that i could ever come out whatever that could ever happen is if like brother bam says you know around the tabernacle they had gotten so they had grieved the holy ghost away he said some of those folks out there the least little thing would set them off is that right in other words bring out that old man again how many knows the old man the devil tries to bring that old man alive again sure he does he tries to get that man to be alive again and show himself again i don't i don't know about you but i don't want that i don't want that i want him as dead as midnight i want the old time i don't want you to ever see the old thomas pilot amen didn't that go for every one of us i don't want anybody to see the old you i want that person so buried and dead and that life is gone when you bury something it's hid it's gone amen and the life that we have now it's hidden in christ amen you love the lord god bless you let's stand tonight musicians if you'll come how many thankful for that hiding place the hiding place in christ hidden away and how many knows that there's a secret catching away of the bride even that's going to be a secret when she is taken away huh i trust and hope that when that happens every one of us knows it is that right i don't ever want that to be a secret to me no because i'll be going it's not going to be a secret but to the world it's going to be a secret because like brother brown says man somebody else just become up missing and they'll just say well i guess it's just another one of them things you know but it's to be like a thief in the night it'll be a mystery it'll be a secret catching of his bride taking their way into the skies and the world will just continue on in their riots and their chaos amen but first time he believes that your life has to be hidden god it has to be in that secret place amen let's bow our heads kind of heavenly father we come before you lord jesus and we want to thank you lord for another time we've been able to assemble ourselves together lord and to read your word and to speak of your beauty and your greatness lord jesus and what you've done for us lord and how that you've called us lord in this gentile age god to be your children and to manifest your word father we ask god that you'd help each and every one of us lord as we have looked father at the character of a christian lord jesus how that he's not about show it's not about what people see you do but it's what god sees you do is secret and what we are in secret that's really what we are we ask god that you'd help us lord each one father to find that quiet time if we're too busy lord to find that place of quiet and secret place lord jesus get aside somewhere and to talk to you to have fellowship with you and to speak with you and to make our requests known before your lord jesus and then to see you reward us openly lord to see you answer our prayer father lord we just ask once again lord jesus you draw everybody father both in the service here and those out there father listening lord jesus on the airwaves we ask god that you draw them each day closer to you lord father may they not forget may i not forget let it become dull lord of how they were to get away father and have that time of prayer and what you have told us to do and how you've told us to pray and and how that we're to act lord jesus and realize that you are a god you're a pla you're in a place in a secret place you are you see in secret you hear in secret but you reward openly so help us lord jesus that we might be honest lord jesus in each and every one of our hearts father to be real lord jesus we don't want to be fake we don't want to do anything for show lord we want to do it straightly because it's in our heart to do it lord help us never to be a hypocrite lord never to be a pharisee lord for we want our reward to be over yonder father we just ask god that you just continue to lead and guide us now by your spirit we love you in jesus name amen and amen god bless you
